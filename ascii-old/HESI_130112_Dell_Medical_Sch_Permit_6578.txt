MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Project Description
This report describes the results of archeological and historical investigations conducted
for the proposed Dell Medical School, Phase 1, project on behalf of the Board of Regents (the
Board) of the University of Texas System (UT) under subcontract to Bury + Partners. The
proposed undertaking would include constructing a research building, a medical office building,
a hospital, an academic building, a parking structure, and auxiliary features and landscaping
within an approximately 9.1-hectare (ha) (22.5-acre [ac]) tract in downtown Austin, Travis
County, Texas. The project area incorporates much of the current city block bounded by East
Martin Luther King, Jr. (MLK), Boulevard on the north; Trinity Street on the west; East
15th Street on the south; and East Avenue (i.e., the southbound frontage road of Interstate
Highway [IH] 35) on the east; with 2 small areas extending north of East MLK Boulevard along
Trinity and Red River streets. The project area encompasses Centennial Park; UT’s PenickAllison Tennis Center; the southern overflow parking lot of the Frank C. Erwin, Jr., Special
Events Center (Erwin Center); the current right-of-way (ROW) of Red River Street between East
MLK Boulevard and East 15th Street; the interior courtyard of the Little Campus; and a segment
of Waller Creek between the Trinity Street and East 15th Street bridges. Existing facilities within
the city block described above that are not included within the project area include the Erwin
Center and adjacent parking lots, UT’s School of Nursing, UT’s Trinity Parking Garage, UT’s
Collections Deposit Library, and historic-age structures on the Little Campus. The Area of
Potential Effect (APE) of the proposed undertaking would consist of the entire 9.1-ha (22.5-ac)
tract.
Regulatory Background
The proposed undertaking is being sponsored by the Board, which represents a state
university within the State of Texas, and proposed construction would occur on land owned by
UT; as such, the project falls under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of Texas. At this
time, no federal jurisdiction has been identified for the project. As the project represents a
publicly sponsored undertaking with the potential to impact significant cultural resources, the
Board was required to provide for a cultural resources inventory of the APE and to assess the
significance of any cultural resources located within the APE that potentially may be adversely

affected by proposed construction of the Dell Medical School, Phase I, based on their eligibility
for designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs) under the Antiquities Code of Texas.
Historic Map Research
Prior to initiating fieldwork, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon),
subcontracted the services of Kathryn St. Clair, architectural historian, and Sarah Kobetis,
preservation specialist, of CP&Y, Inc. (CP&Y), to assist with historical and archival research.
The first goal of this historical research was to develop the 19th- and 20th-century historic
background of the project area, to identify the locations of any previously recorded historic-age
and prehistoric resources within and near the project area, and to identify any previous cultural
resources studies that may bear on the cultural resources potential of the project area. The
second goal was to develop a series of historic map overlays of the current city block that
incorporates the project area to identify the locations of former historic-age structures and
related features to be used as a baseline for targeting likely locations for historic-age
archeological deposits during the field survey. Upon completion of the historic overlay maps,
Horizon met with archeological and historical reviewers at the Texas Historical Commission
(THC) to develop and approve a field methodology for the archeological survey.
The project area currently occupies a large city block that is bounded by East MLK
Boulevard on the north, Trinity Street on the west, East 15th Street on the south, and East
Avenue (the southbound frontage road of IH 35) on the east. Historically, this area was
composed of 16 individual city blocks, and the ROWs of the city of Austin’s gridded city streets
crisscrossed the tract. North-to-south-oriented streets included, from west to east, Trinity
Street, Neches Street, Red River Street, Sabine Street, and East Avenue. East-to-west
oriented streets included, from north to south, East MLK Boulevard (also known as 19th Street
and, historically, as Magnolia Street), 18th Street (historically Chestnut Street), 17th Street
(historically Linden Street), 16th Street (historically Cherry Street), and 15th Street (historically
North Avenue). The city of Austin town plan was originally laid out in 1839 by Edwin Waller;
however, Waller’s town plan extended only as far north as North Avenue (now 15th Street), and
the current project area therefore does not appear on Waller’s 1839 town plan map. Augustis
Koch’s 1873 “Bird’s Eye” map of Austin shows that limited residential development had occurred
within the project area by 1873, though large portions remained undeveloped. Residential and
limited commercial development progressed within the project area throughout the late 19th and
20th centuries, and the area remained largely residential until it was acquired by UT in the
1970s. By 1977, all of the residential buildings formerly located within the project area had been
demolished; all of the crisscrossing street ROWs had been removed with the exception of Red
River Street, which was rerouted from its original straight alignment to its current curvilinear
route; and the UT facilities that currently characterize the project area had been established.
Finally, Centennial Park was dedicated to UT in 1983 on the occasion of the 100th anniversary
of the university’s founding. Centennial Park incorporates all of the park-like portions of the
project area located west of Red River that are not covered by built facilities, such as the
Penick-Allison Tennis Center, the Trinity Parking Garage, and the School of Nursing.

Historic Structures Survey Results
On June 26, 2013, Jeffrey D. Owens, Horizon Principal Investigator, accompanied by
Kathryn St. Clair, CP&Y architectural historian, and Sarah Kobetis, CP&Y preservation
specialist, conducted a walkover of the project area to identify historic-age structures and
objects. During the historic structures inventory survey, 5 bridges (the 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th,
and Trinity street bridges), 3 of which are of historic age (the 16th, 18th, and Trinity Street
bridges); 1 historic-age house (the Arthur P. Watson House); and 1 historic property listed on
the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and designated as an SAL (the Little Campus)
were identified within and adjacent to the boundaries of the project area.
The 15th Street bridge is a modern concrete arch bridge with a 5-lane roadway and
sidewalks on either side, most likely constructed circa 1970 to replace an earlier, smaller bridge
over Waller Creek. The bridge, abutments, and adjacent retaining walls have undergone
numerous repairs and reconfigurations. The 16th Street bridge is a historic-age masonry and
concrete double-arch bridge built circa 1920 that is currently primarily used for pedestrian traffic,
though it may have been used for automobile through-traffic as recently as the 1970s. The
17th Street Bridge is a recently built wooden footbridge constructed circa 1980. This bridge
replaced an earlier bridge within the same location, as indicated by 2 concrete piers that remain
underneath (though not supporting) the current bridge. A photograph dated 1972 indicates that
the earlier bridge in this location was a metal truss bridge supported on the concrete piers. This
earlier bridge likely supported vehicles, as indicated by the truss design, though the only
remaining vestiges of the earlier bridge are the 2 concrete supports. The 18th Street bridge is a
masonry and concrete double-arch bridge built circa 1925 that is primarily used for pedestrian
traffic, though it may have been used for automobile through-traffic as recently as the 1970s.
The Trinity Street bridge is a pre-stressed I-beam bridge with a 4-lane roadway and sidewalks
on either side constructed in 1962 that replaced an earlier bridge. In addition to the bridges,
there are historic-age retaining wall remnants located north and south of the 16th Street bridge
and south of the 18th Street bridge as well as a masonry storm water outfall located on the
southern bank of Waller Creek east of the Trinity Street bridge.
In addition to the bridges discussed above, 1 historic-age residence, the Arthur P.
Watson House, is located just outside the northeastern boundary of the APE in the area
between UT’s Trinity Parking Garage, Collections Deposit Library, and School of Nursing. Built
in 1852, the Watson House is a private home located at 500 East 18th Street and has stood
vacant since it was donated to UT in 1993. This 2-story house is built of limestone with a
mansard roof, and it is one of the oldest standing homes in Austin and also the closest historicage building to the project area boundary.
One historic property listed on the NRHP and designated as an SAL, the Little Campus,
was located within and adjacent to the current project area. The Little Campus is located in the
northeastern portion of the project area and is bounded by East MLK Boulevard on the north,
Red River Street on the west, East Avenue (the southbound IH 35 frontage road) on the east,
and by the Erwin Center on the south. At the time of its NRHP nomination in 1974, the Little
Campus had 6 contributing buildings built between 1857 and 1912 by Abner H. Cook, who also
built the Pease Mansion, the Texas Governor’s Mansion, and the Neil-Cochran House (though

Management Summary

some additional buildings on the campus had been demolished prior to 1974). The stucco,
limestone, and brick main building had a metal roof and was built in an Italianate style. The
corresponding 5 buildings were constructed in brick in a similar style. The original main building
of the Little Campus was built as the Texas State Asylum for the Blind, a state hospital for the
blind that was the first of its kind in Texas. It operated from 1857 to 1865, when its services
were disrupted by the Civil War. Since that time, the main building has been used as a military
residence, again as an asylum for the blind from 1866 to 1915, a World War I air training
institute, a university building, a state hospital, and a World War II military facility before being
acquired for permanent use by UT. The main building currently serves as UT’s Freshman
Admissions Center, and the ancillary buildings house a variety of other university-related
functions. Between the NRHP nomination in 1974 and the SAL designation of the campus in
1981, several buildings on the Little Campus had been razed. The SAL designation covers only
the extant buildings—the Arno Nowotny Building (formerly Building C) and John W. Hargis Hall
(formerly Buildings H and K).
Archeological Survey Results
Archeological field investigations were conducted between July 1 and 3, 2013. Mr.
Owens served as Horizon’s Principal Investigator; Jennifer Cochran served as archeological
field supervisor; Jared Wiersema and Chris Carrel served as trackhoe operators on different
days; Chris Lamon and Mr. Wiersema assisted with monitoring the excavation of trackhoe
trenches on different days; and Briana Nicole Smith conducted shovel testing on the third and
final day of fieldwork. The archeological survey consisted of a pedestrian walkover of the
project area, excavation of trackhoe trenches in the limited areas of the project area in which
trenching was feasible and permitted by UT guidelines and city ordinances, and excavation of
shovel tests in several portions of the project area where trenching could not be conducted.
The locations of trackhoe trenches were based on the mapped locations of former historic-age
structures depicted on historical maps of the project area. Horizon excavated a total of
8 trackhoe trenches and 20 shovel tests within the proposed project’s 9.1-ha (22.5-ac); as such,
the Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) were exceeded for a
project area of this size.
Due to the presence of tennis courts, parking lots, sidewalks,
numerous subsurface utility lines, Heritage Trees, a sculpture garden, and other urban facilities,
subsurface investigations were restricted to limited portions of the overall project area.
Trenching efforts were constrained to 2 clusters of trenches, including (1) 5 trenches in an open
city park area in the southwestern portion of the project area bounded by East 15th Street on
the south, Waller Creek on the east, UT tennis courts on the north, and Trinity Street on the
west, and (2) 3 trenches in a contoured terrace area on the east side of Waller Creek bounded
by Waller Creek to the west and a sculpture garden containing 3 Charles Umlauf sculptures,
sidewalks, and associated landscaping to the east. The northern half of the project area was
inaccessible for trenching efforts due to the narrowness of the extant landforms present
between constructed facilities and the steep banks of Waller Creek and the large number of
subsurface utilities traversing the area; consequently, 20 shovel tests were excavated to
complement the trenching efforts. The archeological survey was conducted under Texas
Antiquities Permit No. 6578.

Proposed Dell Medical School Phase 1 Project, Austin, Travis County, Texas

During the archeological survey, an extensive multiple-component historic-age and
aboriginal archeological site was documented within the project area that has been recorded as
site 41TV2440. The historic-age component consists of an extensive, low- to moderate-density
surface and subsurface scatter of early to mid-20th-century domestic debris, construction
materials, and cultural features. The aboriginal component consists only of a very sparse
subsurface scatter of aboriginal lithic debris, including a few chert flakes and pieces of angular
debris manufactured from Edwards chert, mixed together with the historic-age cultural
resources in shallow, disturbed sediments overlying limestone bedrock. No temporally
diagnostic artifacts, preserved organic remains, or cultural features associated with the
aboriginal component were observed. The site boundaries incorporate the majority of the
project area located west of Red River Street, excluding only those areas in which urban
development has completely obscured the modern ground surface with facilities such as
sidewalks, the tennis center, the Red River Street ROW, the Umlauf sculpture display, and
landscaping. Horizon excavated 20 shovel tests and 8 trackhoe trenches on the site. West of
Waller Creek, limestone bedrock occurs at a relatively uniform depth of 30 centimeters (cm)
below surface, and overlying sediments generally consist of disturbed gravelly clay loam that
contains a low to moderate density of historic-age artifacts. The artifact density is actually
rather low considering the large number of historic-age structures that have been demolished in
this area, which suggests that most of the materials resulting from the demolished houses were
removed from the site. Archeological deposits east of Waller Creek are much more sparse
overall, though 1 trench in this area uncovered a dense deposit of construction debris and
domestic artifacts extending to a depth of 150 cm below surface that appears to reflect the
collected contents of 1 or more demolished households that were used as artificial fill materials
to build up the eastern terrace of Waller Creek. A small number of archeological features were
encountered, including a buried concrete wall anchored on bedrock that appears to represent
the remains of a house foundation, a curvilinear alignment of bricks that may represent a
collapsed well, numerous remnants of abandoned metal pipelines and ceramic sewer pipelines,
as well as a thick historic-age fill deposit composed of construction debris and household
artifacts noted above. Historic-age materials are indicative of the early to mid-20th-century
residential occupations within the project area. A very few artifacts, including solarized glass
shards and square nails, are indicative of late 19th- to early 20th-century dates of manufacture;
however, as the vast majority of the observed cultural materials are clearly of early to mid-20thcentury origin, it is probable that the scant artifacts with earlier manufacture dates were simply
still in use during the 20th-century occupation.
Recommendations
During the historic structures inventory survey, 5 bridges (the 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, and
Trinity street bridges), 3 of which are of historic age (the 16th, 18th, and Trinity street bridges);
1 historic-age house (the Arthur P. Watson House); and 1 historic property listed on the NRHP
and designated as an SAL (the Little Campus) were identified within and adjacent to the
boundaries of the project area. Of the 5 bridges within the project area, only 3 are of historicage—the 16th Street bridge, originally constructed circa 1920; the 18th Street bridge, originally
constructed circa 1925; and the Trinity Street bridge, constructed in 1962. While the 16th and
18th street bridges retain some elements of their original construction, including remnants of

HJN 130112 AR

vii

Management Summary

nearby retaining walls, both bridges have been significantly altered and lack integrity of
materials, design, workmanship, and setting, and both bridges are recommended as ineligible
for designation as SALs. According to the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), the
Trinity Street bridge is not eligible for designation as an SAL.
The Arthur P. Watson house is located just outside the northeastern boundary of the
project area. Built in 1852, the Watson House is one of the oldest standing homes in Austin and
also the closest historic-age building to the project area boundary. The Watson House was not
systematically evaluated during the current study as it is located outside the boundaries of the
project area, and UT has stated that the house will be completely avoided during construction of
the proposed Dell Medical School, Phase 1. As such, it is considered to be of undetermined
eligibility for designation as an SAL.
One NRHP-listed and SAL-designated historic property, the Little Campus, is located
within and adjacent to the current project area. The Little Campus is located in the northeastern
portion of the project area and is bounded by East MLK Boulevard on the north, Red River
Street on the west, East Avenue (the southbound IH 35 frontage road) on the east, and the
Erwin Center on the south. At the time of its NRHP nomination in 1974, this historic property
had 6 contributing buildings built between 1857 and 1912 that served a broad range of functions
over the years, including an asylum for the blind, World Wars I and II military facilities, a state
hospital, and university buildings. Between the NRHP nomination in 1974 and the SAL
designation of the campus in 1981, several buildings on the Little Campus had been razed. The
SAL designation covers only the extant buildings—the Arno Nowotny Building (formerly
Building C) and John W. Hargis Hall (formerly Buildings H and K). Currently, the Little Campus
is owned and operated by UT. In connection with the proposed construction of the Dell Medical
School, Phase I, UT proposes to utilize the interior courtyard of the Little Campus as a parking
lot to accommodate overflow parking from the Erwin Center after the current overflow parking
lot, which is located south of the Erwin Center off the north side of 15th Street within the current
project area, is removed. None of the contributing buildings of the Little Campus would be
modified during the construction and use of the temporary parking lot. The temporary parking
lot will be removed and the Little Campus courtyard will be restored to its current park setting in
the future after the functions of the Erwin Center have been relocated elsewhere. No
investigations were conducted by Horizon in the vicinity of the Little Campus as the proposed
temporary parking lot facility was added to the proposed project design after Horizon’s field
investigations were completed. UT has retained the services of ARCHITEXAS, a preservation
architecture firm, to oversee the construction of the temporary parking lot and future restoration
of the Little Campus courtyard in consultation with the THC; as such, this portion of the project
area was not included within the scope of Horizon’s current investigations.
One new archeological site, 41TV2440, was recorded within the project area during the
archeological survey. As delineated based on current investigations, site 41TV2440 is a
multiple-component aboriginal and early to mid-20th century historic-age site. The aboriginal
component consists only of a very sparse subsurface scatter of lithic flakes and angular debris
mixed together with the 20th-century historic-age cultural materials in shallow, disturbed
sediments overlying limestone bedrock. No temporally diagnostic artifacts, preserved organic

Archeological and Historical Investigations for the
Proposed Dell Medical School Phase 1 Project, Austin, Travis County, Texas

remains, or cultural features associated with the aboriginal component were observed, and the
aboriginal cultural materials on the site are attributable only to an undetermined prehistoric
timeframe. Based on the sparseness of aboriginal cultural materials and the lack of integrity of
the archeological deposits, the aboriginal component on site 41TV2440 possesses no research
value and is recommended as ineligible for designation as an SAL.
The primary cultural component of site 41TV2440 consists of an extensive surface and
subsurface scatter of early to mid-20th-century domestic debris, construction materials, and
cultural features associated with the multiple historic-age residences known to have once
existed within the project area based on historical map research. Within the portion of the
project area west of Waller Creek, archeological deposits are confined to shallow, disturbed
sediments overlying limestone bedrock and measure no more than 30 cm in depth.
Archeological deposits east of Waller Creek are of comparable depth for the most part, though
1 trackhoe trench uncovered a thick historic-age fill deposit composed of construction debris
and household artifacts extending to a depth of 150 cm that likely represents the remains of 1 or
more demolished households that were used as artificial fill material to build up the elevation of
the eastern terrace of Waller Creek. Site 41TV2440 is not associated with events that have
made a significant contribution to broad patterns of history and is not associated with a
particular cultural or ethnic group, and no historic-age structures are currently standing within
the project area that would represent the work of a significant architect, builder, or architectural
style. While it was not feasible within the scope of the current study to obtain chains of title for
each of the dozens of individual residential house lots that comprised this city block throughout
the 19th and 20th centuries prior to UT’s acquisition of the property in the 1970s, no persons of
particular historical significance are known to be associated with the site based on the limited
historical research that has been conducted. Due to the overall low density of cultural materials,
the late date of occupation reflected by the archeological deposits, and somewhat typical nature
of the cultural features and artifacts found on site 41TV2440, the historic-age component is
recommended as ineligible for designation as an SAL.
No cultural resources were identified within the APE that meet the criteria for designation
as SALs according to 13 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) 26. While it was possible to conduct
subsurface archeological investigations in only limited, accessible portions of the overall project
area, it is Horizon’s opinion that archeological deposits are substantively similar across the
entire project area. Given the relatively shallow depth of bedrock (30 cm) across the vast
majority of the investigated portions of the project area, it is Horizon’s opinion that areas that
have been more extensively disturbed via construction of the Erwin Center parking lot, the
current Red River Street ROW, and the UT Penick-Allison Tennis Center have effectively no
potential for intact subsurface archeological deposits underneath the constructed facilities.
There are small areas east of Waller Creek in which deeper layers of historic-age construction
debris and artificial fill materials have been deposited, likely to build up the elevation of the
eastern terrace of the creek; however, gauging from the disturbed character of archeological
deposits examined and the extent of modern landscaping east of Waller Creek, it is Horizon’s
opinion that any uninvestigated archeological deposits in this area would not meet the criteria of
eligibility for designation as SALs. Additional archeological survey investigations would not be
feasible prior to the initiation of construction activities as Horizon was able to access all portions

HJN 130112 AR

ix

Management Summary

of the APE permitted by current access restrictions. While it is possible that a program of
limited archeological monitoring during construction may result in the documentation of
additional archeological deposits and features associated with the early- to mid-20th-century
residential development and occupation within the project area, the disturbed character of
archeological deposits investigated during the survey leads Horizon to believe that any as-yet
undocumented archeological deposits would be similarly disturbed. As such, it is Horizon’s
opinion that no further archeological work is warranted in connection with the proposed
undertaking.
Horizon’s historical research indicates that the original 14 city blocks encompassed
within the current project area consisted entirely of residential and limited commercial
development and that no cemeteries were ever located here. However, it should be noted that
human burials are protected under the Texas Health and Safety Code. In the unlikely event that
any human remains or burial objects are inadvertently discovered at any point during
construction, use, or ongoing maintenance in the project area, even in previously surveyed
areas, all work should cease in the discovery of the find until a qualified archeologist can assess
the inadvertent discovery and the THC should be notified immediately.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This report describes the results of archeological and historical investigations conducted
for the proposed Dell Medical School, Phase 1, project on behalf of The Board of Regents (the
Board) of the University of Texas System (UT) under subcontract to Bury + Partners. The
proposed undertaking would include constructing a research building, a medical office building,
a hospital, an academic building, a parking structure, and auxiliary features and landscaping
within an approximately 9.1-hectare (ha) (22.5-acre [ac]) tract in downtown Austin, Travis
County, Texas. The project area incorporates much of the current city block bounded by East
Martin Luther King, Jr. (MLK), Boulevard on the north; Trinity Street on the west; East
15th Street on the south; and East Avenue (i.e., the southbound frontage road of Interstate
Highway [IH] 35) on the east; with 2 small areas extending north of East MLK Boulevard along
Trinity and Red River streets (Figures 1-1 and 1-2). The project area encompasses Centennial
Park; UT’s Penick-Allison Tennis Center; the southern overflow parking lot of the Frank C.
Erwin, Jr., Special Events Center (Erwin Center); the current right-of-way (ROW) of Red River
Street between East MLK Boulevard and East 15th Street; the interior courtyard of the Little
Campus, and a segment of Waller Creek between the Trinity Street and East 15th Street
bridges. Existing facilities within the city block described above that are not included within the
project area include the Erwin Center and adjacent parking lots, UT’s School of Nursing, UT’s
Trinity Parking Garage, UT’s Collections Deposit Library, and historic-age structures on the
Little Campus. The Area of Potential Effect (APE) of the proposed undertaking would consist of
the entire 9.1-ha (22.5-ac) tract.
The proposed undertaking is being sponsored by the Board, which represents a state
university within the State of Texas, and proposed construction would occur on land owned by
UT; as such, the project falls under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of Texas. At this
time, no federal jurisdiction has been identified for the project. As the project represents a
publicly sponsored undertaking with the potential to impact significant cultural resources, the
Board was required to provide for a cultural resources inventory of the APE and to assess the
significance of any cultural resources located within the APE that potentially may be adversely
affected by proposed construction of the Dell Medical School, Phase I, based on their eligibility
for designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs) under the Antiquities Code of Texas.
To meet its responsibilities under applicable state statutes, UT’s engineering contractor,
Bury + Partners, subcontracted Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon), to conduct

historical and archeological investigations for the proposed project. The cultural resources
investigations consisted of background historical research; a reconnaissance-level historic
structures inventory survey; an intensive archeological survey consisting of a pedestrian
walkover with systematic shovel testing and trackhoe trenching in accessible portions of the
project area; and the production of a report suitable for review by the State Historic Preservation
Office (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice
and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council of Texas Archeologists’ (CTA)
Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports. The archeological survey was
conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 6578.

2.0 DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT AREA

The project area incorporates much of the current city block bounded by East MLK
Boulevard on the north; Trinity Street on the west; East 15th Street on the south; and East
Avenue (i.e., the southbound frontage road of IH 35) on the east; with 2 small areas extending
north of East MLK Boulevard along Trinity and Red River streets (see Figures 1-1 and 1-2).
Historically, this area was composed of 16 individual city blocks (Blocks 57 to 71), and the
project area incorporates all or portions of 14 of these individual city blocks (Blocks 59 to 67, 70,
and 71). This includes the block formerly bounded by 17th and 18th streets and by Neches and
Trinity streets, which did not have a numerical designation. Historically, the ROWs of the city of
Austin’s gridded city streets crisscrossed the tract. North-to-south-oriented streets included,
from west to east, Trinity Street, Neches Street, Red River Street, Sabine Street, and East
Avenue. East-to-west oriented streets included, from north to south, East MLK Boulevard (also
known as 19th Street and, historically, as Magnolia Street), 18th Street (historically Chestnut
Street), 17th Street (historically Linden Street), 16th Street (historically Cherry Street), and 15th
Street (historically North Avenue). The city of Austin town plan was originally laid out in 1839 by
Edwin Waller; however, Waller’s town plan extended only as far north as North Avenue (now
15th Street), and the current project area therefore does not appear on Waller’s 1839 town plan
map. The earliest historic map of the project area found during historic research is Augustis
Koch’s 1873 “Bird’s Eye” map of Austin, which shows that limited residential development had
occurred within the project area by 1873, though large portions remained undeveloped.
Residential and limited commercial development progressed within the project area throughout
the late 19th and 20th centuries, and the area remained largely residential until it was acquired
by UT in the 1970s. By 1977, all of the residential buildings formerly located within the project
area had been demolished; all of the crisscrossing street ROWs had been removed with the
exception of Red River Street, which was rerouted from its original straight alignment to its
current curvilinear route; and the UT facilities that currently characterize the project area had
been established. Finally, Centennial Park was dedicated to UT in 1983 on the occasion of the
100th anniversary of the university’s founding. Centennial Park incorporates all of the park-like
portions of the project area located west of Red River that are not covered by built facilities,
such as UT’s Penick-Allison Tennis Center, the Trinity Parking Garage, and the School of
Nursing.

photographic overview of the project area and its immediate surroundings at the time of
Horizon’s archeological and historical investigations.
While the overall design of UT’s proposed Dell Medical School, Phase 1, project has not
been completely finalized, current plans propose to substantially modify the current
configuration of the project area (Figure 2-22). UT’s Penick-Allison Tennis Center, which runs
along the eastern side of Trinity Street approximately between 16th and 18th streets, would be
removed and replaced with, from north to south, a proposed research building, a medical office
building, and a parking garage. The current ROW of Red River Street, which currently runs
within a curvilinear ROW between Centennial Park and the Erwin Center complex, would be
straightened to align with its original ROW. The southern overflow parking lot of the Erwin
Center, which is currently located northeast of the current intersection of Red River and East
15th streets, would be removed. Following the completion of the realignment of Red River
Street, a proposed hospital would be constructed northwest of the intersection of Red River and
East 15th streets, and an academic building would be constructed at the northeast corner of the
same intersection. Much of the current park of Centennial Park, including a display of 3 Charles
Umlauf sculptures and various sidewalks, would be replaced with the abovementioned facilities.
Several large pecan and oak trees within the project area that have been designated as
Heritage Trees (i.e., those with a diameter of 24 inches or more) under City of Austin Heritage
Tree Ordinance No. 20100204-038 would be relocated. Other existing UT facilities, including
the Trinity Parking Garage and Collections Deposit Library (located off the south side of East
MLK Boulevard between Trinity and Red River streets), the Nursing School (located off the west
side of Red River Street between 17th and 18th streets), and the Erwin Center (located between
Red River Street and the southbound frontage road of IH 35), would not be affected during the
current phase of the proposed undertaking.
The Little Campus, a historic property listed on the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) and designated as an SAL, is located in the northeastern portion of the project area and
is bounded by East MLK Boulevard on the north, Red River Street on the west, the southbound
IH 35 frontage road on the east, and the Erwin Center complex on the south. At the time of its
NRHP nomination in 1974, the Little Campus had 6 contributing buildings built between 1857
and 1912 that served a broad range of functions over the years, including an asylum for the
blind, World Wars I and II military facilities, a state hospital, and university buildings. Between
the NRHP nomination in 1974 and the SAL designation of the campus in 1981, several buildings
on the Little Campus had been razed. The SAL designation covers only the extant buildings—
the Arno Nowotny Building (formerly Building C) and John W. Hargis Hall (formerly Buildings H
and K). Currently, the Little Campus is owned and operated by UT. In connection with the
proposed construction of the Dell Medical School, Phase I, UT proposes to utilize the interior
courtyard of the Little Campus as a parking lot to accommodate overflow parking from the Erwin
Center after the current overflow parking lot, which is located south of the Erwin Center off the
north side of 15th Street within the current project area, is removed. None of the contributing
buildings of the NRHP-listed Little Campus would be modified during the construction and use
of the temporary parking lot. The temporary parking lot will be removed, and the Little Campus
courtyard will be restored to its current park setting in the future after the functions of the Erwin
Center have been relocated elsewhere. No investigations were conducted by Horizon in the

vicinity of the Little Campus as the proposed temporary parking lot facility was added to the
proposed project design after Horizon’s field investigations were completed. UT has retained
the services of ARCHITEXAS, a preservation architecture firm, to oversee the construction of
the temporary parking lot and future restoration of the Little Campus courtyard in consultation
with the THC; as such, this portion of the project area was not included within the scope of
Horizon’s current investigations.

In addition, 2 small portions of the project area that extend north of East MLK Boulevard
were not included in Horizon’s cultural resources investigations as these areas were added to
the overall project area subsequent to the completion of Horizon’s field investigations.

3.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

3.1

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The proposed project’s APE is located in downtown Austin, Travis County, Texas, near
the boundary of 3 significant physiographic provinces—the Blackland Prairie, the Edwards
Plateau, and the Gulf Coastal Plain. The Blackland Prairie, within which the project area is
situated, is a narrow physiographic zone between the Edwards Plateau to the west and the Gulf
Coastal Plain to the east. It is a low, rolling land that extends in a narrow band along the
eastern edge of the Balcones fault zone from the Red River Valley in northeastern Texas to the
southern edge of the Edwards Plateau. This is an area of low topographic relief and poor
drainage in which water often ponds after rainstorms and streams flow at very gentle gradients.
The Edwards Plateau and Balcones Escarpment are associated with a great fault system that
arcs across Texas to form a distinct boundary between uplands composed primarily of
limestone bedrock and lower plains composed mostly of softer rocks. In places, this boundary
is marked by an abrupt scarp (the Balcones Escarpment) and in others by a more gradational
ramp, but the entire length of this transition zone is a major ecotone in terms of topography,
bedrock, hydrology, soil, vegetation, and animal life. The project’s APE is situated in a heavily
developed urban setting along the terraces of Waller Creek, a tributary of the Colorado River.
The project area slopes downward toward Waller Creek. Elevations within the project area
range from approximately 146 to 158 m (480 to 520 ft) above mean sea level (amsl), with the
majority of the topographic variability being accounted for by the deeply incised channel of
Waller Creek. The landscape west of Waller Creek is relatively flat and appears to have been
repeatedly cleared and graded throughout the historic past. Modern park landscaping has
produced heavily contoured, hummocky surface elevations east of Waller Creek, though this
topographic variability is largely artificial.
Hydrologically, the proposed project’s APE is situated within the Colorado River basin.
Waller Creek enters the northwestern corner of the project area at the Trinity Street bridge and
flows generally south-southwestward, exiting the project area along its southern boundary at the
15th Street bridge, continuing south-southwestwards to discharge into Town Lake, an
impounded lake along the Colorado River. The Colorado River in turn flows southeastward
across the Blackland Prairie and the Gulf Coastal Plain, ultimately discharging into the Gulf of
Mexico a short distance northeast of Matagorda Bay.

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

The proposed project’s APE is underlain by a thick sequence of Cretaceous-age,
sedimentary rock strata. In Travis County, soils formed primarily over sedimentary deposits of
Upper Cretaceous age, and soil parent material consists of chalk, marl, limestone, and marly
limestone (Fisher 1974). In the central part of Travis County, the area that includes the current
project area, soils formed over the Upper Cretaceous Austin Chalk (Kau) formation (Fisher
1974). Late Pleistocene- and Holocene-age alluvial deposits are mapped adjacent to some of
the more prominent streams, creeks, and rivers in Travis County; however, no alluvial
sediments are mapped within the current project area. Geomorphologically, soils within the
project area are characterized as Urban Land (Ur), indicating that existing topsoil is mixed with
various urban fills (NRCS 2013) (Figure 3-1).
While aboriginal cultural resources are commonly encountered in deep alluvial
sediments adjacent to major streams in Central Texas, the relative antiquity of the preHolocene-age limestone formation that characterizes the current project area, taken together
with the disturbed urban context of the project area, suggests that any cultural resources would
be constrained to the modern ground surface or in shallowly buried, disturbed contexts that lack
integrity. Intact, buried aboriginal archeological deposits may occur within alluvial sediments
near major streams, though no Holocene-age alluvial sediments are mapped within the current
project area. The soils within the project area consist of various gravelly sandy, clayey, and
loamy sediments that developed in situ from the underlying Austin Chalk formation and have
been mixed with various urban fills throughout the historic past. As historic-age urban
development within the project area has been ongoing since the mid-19th century, historic-age
cultural resources may be expected to occur within the project area; however, any historic-age
archeological deposits would be expected to be mixed with various urban fills and to lack
integrity.

3.3

CLIMATE

Evidence for climatic change from the Pleistocene to the present is most often obtained
through studies of pollen and faunal sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins 1995).
Bryant and Holloway (1985) present a sequence of climatic change for nearby east-central
Texas from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.) through the Late Glacial
period (14,000 to 10,000 B.P.) to the Post-Glacial period (10,000 B.P. to present). Evidence
from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period suggests that the climate in east-central Texas was
considerably cooler and more humid than at present. Pollen data indicate that the region was
more heavily forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods (Bryant and Holloway
1985). The Late Glacial period was characterized by slow climatic deterioration and a slow
warming and/or drying trend (Collins 1995). In east-central Texas, the deciduous woodlands
were gradually replaced by grasslands and post oak savannas (Bryant and Holloway 1985).
During the Post-Glacial period, the east-central Texas environment appears to have been more
stable. The deciduous forests had long since been replaced by prairies and post oak savannas.
The drying and/or warming trend that began in the Late Glacial period continued into the midHolocene, at which point there appears to have been a brief amelioration to more mesic

conditions lasting from roughly 6000 to 5000 B.P. Recent studies by Bryant and Holloway
(1985) indicate that modern environmental conditions in east-central Texas were probably
achieved by 1,500 years ago.
Travis County is located within the south-central climatic division. The modern climate is
typically dry to subhumid with long, hot summers and short, mild winters. The climate is
influenced primarily by tropical maritime air masses from the Gulf of Mexico, but it is modified by
polar air masses. Tropical maritime air masses predominate throughout spring, summer, and
fall. Modified polar air masses are dominant in winter and provide a continental climate
characterized by considerable variations in temperature.
On average throughout the past century, precipitation and temperature in Texas
manifest regional clines with mean annual precipitation totals declining fairly regularly from east
to west and mean annual temperature declining equally evenly from northwest to southeast
(Larkin and Bomar 1983). In Central Texas, climate has fluctuated from subtropical humid to
subtropical subhumid. Average annual precipitation totals 81 cm (32 in) and temperature
averages 19°C (67°F) annually, ranging from 36°C (96°F) in August (the warmest month) to
15°C (59°F) in January (the coldest month). During this time, however, drier periods lasting
from 3 to 7 years, when total annual rainfall ranged from 30 to 64 cm (12 to 25 in), were
followed by abnormally wet years with 114 to 127 cm (45 to 50 in) of rainfall.
Two annual precipitation peaks, which typically occur in May and September, are
associated with frontal storms that form when southward-moving cool air masses collide with
warm, moist air masses moving inland from the Gulf of Mexico (Bomar 1983; Carr 1967). The
topographic discontinuity along the Balcones Escarpment lies directly in the path of the Gulf
storm trace and increases the lift in convective storms to produce extreme amounts of rainfall.
Two extreme examples are the excess of 91 cm (36 in) of rain that fell within an 18-hour period
in the vicinity of Thrall, Texas, in September 1921, and the 56-cm (22-in) deluge that fell in less
than 3 hours near O’Harris, Texas, in May 1935. Lower rainfall amounts are characteristic of
winter and late summer. In winter, frontal storms pass so frequently that there is little time for
moisture to increase, and prevailing upper-level winds from west to east often dominate over
meridional flow, meaning that much of the available moisture is derived from the Pacific rather
than from the Gulf of Mexico. In summer, cool fronts rarely penetrate into the region, and
rainfall occurs primarily as localized, thermal convective storms.

3.4

BIOTA

The project area is situated in the southwestern portion of the Texan biotic province
(Blair 1950), an intermediate zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian
provinces and the grasslands of the Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces (Dice 1943).
Some species reach the limits of their ecological range within the Texan province. The
boundary, characterized as “approximate,” between Blair’s (1950) Texan and Balconian
provinces passes through western Williamson County, northwest of the project area. Rainfall in
the Texan province is barely in excess of water need, and the region is classified by Thornwaite
(1948) as a C2 (moist subhumid) climate with a moisture surplus index of from 0 to 20%.

Proposed Dell Medical School Phase 1 Project, Austin, Travis County, Texas

Edaphic controls on vegetation types are important in the Texan biotic province, which is
located near the border between moisture surplus and moisture deficiency. Sandy soils support
oak-hickory forests dominated by post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Q. marilandica),
and hickory (Carya buckleyi). Clay soils originally supported a tall-grass prairie, but much of this
soil type has been placed under cultivation. Dominant tall-grass prairie species include western
wheatgrass (Agrophyron smithii), silver beardgrass (Andropogon saccharoides), little bluestem
(Andropogon scoparius), and Texas wintergrass (Stipa leucotricha). Major areas of oak-hickory
forest include the Eastern and Western Cross Timbers, and major tall-grass prairie areas
include the Blackland, Grand, and Coastal prairies. Some characteristic associations of the
Austroriparian province occur locally in the Texan province, such as a mixed stand of loblolly
pine (Pinus taeda) and blackjack and post oak in Bastrop County and a series of peat and bog
marshes distributed in a line extending from Leon to Gonzales counties.
The fauna associated with this region are represented by a mixture of species from the
Austroriparian, Tamaulipan, Chihuahuan, Kansan, Balconian, and Texan biotic provinces. At
least 49 species of mammals occur in the Texan province, including Virginia opossum
(Didelphis virginiana), eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus), fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), desert
pocket gopher (Geomys breviceps), fulvous harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys fulvescens),
white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), eastern
cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), striped skunk (Mephitis
mephitis), white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), black-tailed jackrabbit (Sylvilagus
californicus), ground squirrel (Citellus tridecemlineatus), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus
virginiana), hispid pocket mouse (Perognathus hispidus), deer mouse (Peromyscus
maniculatus), pygmy mouse (Baiomys taylori), 9-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus),
and jaguar (Felis onca).
Both species of Terrapene known from the Austroriparian province—eastern box turtle
(T. Carolina) and desert box turtle (T. ornata)—occur in the Texan. Sixteen species of lizards,
including 7 grassland and 9 forest species, are also found, including green anole (Anolis
carolinensis), eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus undulates), common ground skink (Leiolopisma
laterale), glass snake (Ophiosaurus ventralis [grassland species]), collared lizard (Crotaphytus
collaris), Texas spiny lizard (Sceloporus olivaceous), Texas horned lizard (Phrynosoma
cornutum), and Great Plains skink (Eumeces obsoletus [forest species]). Only 5 species of
urodele fauna are known from this area, including small-mouthed salamander (Ambystoma
texanum), tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum), and eastern lesser siren (Siren intermedia),
and the Texan province acts as a barrier to urodele distribution between the endemic Balconian
province fauna to the west and the Austroriparian fauna to the east.
Anuran fauna is composed primarily of Austroriparian or otherwise widely distributed
species, including eastern spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus holbrookii), Gulf Coast toad (Bufo
valliceps), Woodhouse’s toad (Bufo woodhousii), southern cricket frog (Acris gryllus), southern
chorus frog (Pseudacris nigrita), gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor), green treefrog (Hyla cinerea),
North American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana), northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens), and narrowmouthed toad (Microhyla carolinensis). Additional anuran species that fail to cross from the

Chapter 3.0: Environmental Setting

Texan into the Austroriparian province include pacific tree frog (Pseudacris clarkia), Strecker’s
chorus frog (Pseudacris streckeri), and striped whipsnake (Microhyla olivacea).
Other reptile and amphibian species common to this biotic zone include 6-lined
racerunner (Aspidoscelis sexlineata), rat snake (Ptyas mucosus), eastern hognose snake
(Heterodon platirhinos), rough green snake (Opheodrys aestivus), copperhead (Agkistrodon
contortrix), western diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox), Blanchard’s cricket frog (Acris
crepitans), diamondback water snake (Nerodia rhombifer rhombifer), and Houston toad (Bufo
houstonensis). Common bird species include northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), eastern
meadowlark (Sturnella magna), mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), killdeer (Charadrius
vociferus), field sparrow (Spizella pusilla), red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), turkey vulture
(Cathartes aura), belted kingfisher (Ceyrle alcyon), and mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos). Small
herds of bison and antelope were common during the late prehistoric and early historic periods,
but these species are no longer native to this region (Jurney et al. 1989:13-14).

4.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The project area is located within Prewitt’s (1981, 1985) Central Texas Archeological
Region. Prewitt (1981, 1985) demarcated the southeastern boundary of the Central Texas
Archeological Region at the town of Bastrop in Bastrop County, which borders Travis County on
the southeast. The indigenous human inhabitants of Central Texas practiced a generally
nomadic hunting and gathering lifestyle throughout all of prehistory, and, in contrast to much of
the rest of North America, mobility and settlement patterns do not appear to have changed
markedly through time in this region.

4.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (CA. 12,000 TO 8500 B.P.)

The initial human occupations in the New World can now be confidently extended back
before 12,000 B.P. (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990;
Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans
were present in Eastern North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al.
1990), while more recent discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for
human occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer
et al. 1997). Most archeologists presently discount claims of much earlier human occupation
during the Pleistocene glacial period.
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Central Texas is represented
by the PaleoIndian period (12,000 to 8500 B.P.) (Collins 1995). This stage coincided with
ameliorating climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that witnessed the
extinction of herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing various
periods within this stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often fluted,
lanceolate projectile points. These points are frequently associated with spurred end scrapers,
gravers, and bone foreshafts. PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized
into egalitarian bands consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic
subsistence and settlement pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence
patterns in Central Texas are known primarily through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence
focused on the exploitation of plants, small animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the
PaleoIndian period. There is little evidence in this region for hunting of extinct megafauna, as
has been documented elsewhere in North America. Rather, a broad-based subsistence pattern
appears to have been practiced throughout all prehistoric time periods. In Central Texas, the
PaleoIndian stage is divided into 2 periods based on recognizable differences in projectile point

27

Chapter 4.0: Cultural Background

styles. These include the Early PaleoIndian period, which is recognized based on large, fluted
projectile points (i.e., Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Big Sandy), and the Late
PaleoIndian period, which is characterized by unfluted lanceolate points (i.e., Plainview,
Scottsbluff, Meserve, and Angostura).

4.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 8500 TO 1200 B.P.)

The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend marks the beginning of the Archaic period
(8500 to 1200 B.P.) (Collins 1995). This climatic trend marked the beginning of a significant
reorientation of lifestyle throughout most of North America, but this change was far less
pronounced in Central Texas. Elsewhere, the changing climatic conditions and corresponding
decrease in the big game populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a diversified
resource base composed of smaller game and wild plants. In Central Texas, however, this
hunting and gathering pattern is characteristic of most of prehistory. The appearance of a more
diversified tool kit, the development of an expanded groundstone assemblage, and a general
decrease in the size of projectile points are hallmarks of this cultural stage. Material culture
shows greater diversity during this broad cultural period, especially in the application of
groundstone technology.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods.
Changes in projectile point morphology are often used as markers differentiating these
3 subperiods, though other changes in material culture occurred as well. Perhaps most
markedly, burned rock middens appear during the Middle Archaic subperiod, continuing into the
Late Archaic subperiod, and large cemeteries appear during the Late Archaic subperiod. In
addition, the increasing density of prehistoric sites through time is often considered to constitute
evidence of population growth, though differential preservation probably at least partially
accounts for the lower numbers of older sites.

4.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 1200 TO 350 B.P.)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period (1200 to 350 B.P.) (Collins 1995) is defined by
the appearance of the bow and arrow. In Central Texas, pottery also appears during the Late
Prehistoric period (though ceramics appear earlier in Southeast Texas). Use of the atlatl (i.e.,
spearthrower) and spear was generally discontinued during the Late Prehistoric period, though
they continued to be used in the inland subregion of Southeast Texas along with the bow and
arrow through the Late Prehistoric period (Patterson 1980, 1995; Wheat 1953). In Texas,
unifacial arrow points appear to be associated with a small prismatic blade technology. The
Late Prehistoric period is generally divided into 2 phases, the Austin and Toyah phases. Austin
phase sites occur earliest to the north, which has led some researchers (e.g., Prewitt 1985) to
suggest that the Austin-phase populations of Central Texas were migrants from the north, and
lack the ceramic industry of the later Toyah phase.

4.4

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 350 B.P. TO PRESENT)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas was in 1519, when
Alonso Álvarez de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Álvar

Núñez Cabeza de Vaca crossed South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast
near Galveston Bay. However, European settlement did not seriously disrupt native ways of life
until after 1700. The first half of the 18th century was the period in which the fur trade and
mission system, as well as the first effects of epidemic diseases, began to seriously disrupt the
native culture and social systems. This process is clearly discernable at the Mitchell Ridge site,
where burial data suggest population declines and group mergers (Ricklis 1994) as well as
increased participation on the part of the Native American population in the fur trade. By the
time that heavy settlement of Texas began in the early 1800s by Anglo-Americans, the
indigenous Indian population was greatly diminished.
The Tonkawa and the Lipan Apache Indians were well established in Central Texas by
the 14th century, and Comanche and Kiowa tribes arrived in the area by the 18th century1. The
first European known to have crossed the region was Domingo Terán de los Ríos, who made an
inspection tour to East Texas in 1691. When the Spanish moved their missions out of East
Texas in 1730, they relocated the missions of San Francisco de los Neches, Nuestra Señora de
la Purísima Concepción de los Hasinai, and San José de los Nazonis to locations near Barton
Springs. In 1827, the Mexican government granted Stephen F. Austin his third colony, Little
Colony, which was located east of the Colorado River and north and west of the Old San
Antonio Road. Mina (later Bastrop) became the headquarters of the colony, and Travis County
developed as an offshoot of Mina. Settlers moving into the area in the early 1830s included
Josiah and Mathias Wilbarger, Reuben Hornsby, Jacob M. Harrell, and John F. Webber. The
onset of the Texas Revolution delayed further settlement activity, and the news of the fall of the
Alamo prompted those settlers already in residence to flee.
Settlement resumed after the revolution, but it proceeded slowly because of the constant
threat of raids by the Comanche Indians. During the 1830s, a chain of small forts extended
from Bastrop northwest along Wilbarger’s Bend, Coleman Branch, Webber’s Prairie, and
Gilleland Creek, to Fort Colorado or Fort Prairie, 8 km (5 mi) east of the site of present-day
Austin. In June 1835, Thomas Jefferson Chambers surveyed part of an 8-league grant covering
the present-day site of Austin and the capitol. Sometime before 1837, William Barton settled
near the springs that were to bear his name. In 1837 or 1838, President Mirabeau B. Lamar
was on a buffalo hunt in the area and commented on its possibilities as a permanent site for the
capital. In 1838, the community of Waterloo (later Austin) consisted of 4 families, and about
20 families established homes at nearby Montopolis in 1839. When the Congress of the
Republic of Texas chose Waterloo as the site of the new capital, opponents were quick to point
out the disadvantages—the site's proximity to the frontier, the lack of timber, the poor soil, and
the threat of Indian raids. In spite of this opposition, however, the new capital—renamed Austin
in honor of Stephen F. Austin—was approved on 19 January 1840. A few days later, the
Congress established Travis County, naming it in honor of William Barret Travis and making
Austin its county seat. An election for county officials was held in February 1840, at which time
the population was reported to be 856. The initial boundaries of Travis County included roughly
40,000 square miles. Counties that were later carved from Travis County include Callahan

(1858), Coleman (1858), Comal (1846), Gillespie (1848), Hays (1848), Burnet (1852), Brown
(1856), Lampasas (1856), Eastland (1858), Runnels (1858), and Taylor (1858). Sam Houston
moved the government of the Republic of Texas from Austin to Houston when Mexican troops
invaded San Antonio in March 1842. When he tried to have the government archives removed
as well, Austin citizens resisted with the Archives War. The Texas Congress held sessions at
Washington-on-the-Brazos from 1842 to 1845, but the convention that drafted the Constitution
of 1845 met in Austin in July 1845, and by October the rest of the government had returned to
the capital city. The first legislature of the new state convened in Austin in February 1846.
The late 1840s and early 1850s were building years for Austin and Travis County, with
much of the growth fed by the presence of the state government—the Governor's Mansion,
office buildings, hotels, new homes, and newspapers. In 1850, Travis County had a population
of 3,138, of whom 2,336 were white, 791 were slaves, and 11 were free blacks; by 1860, the
number of residents had more than doubled to 8,080, with 4,931 of them white, 3,136 slaves,
and 13 free blacks. Although the city of Austin grew faster than the county as a whole—its
population rose from 629 in 1850 to 3,494 in 1860—most county residents lived in small
communities. Pflugerville and Del Valle were the most prominent of these communities, but
rural post offices were also established at Bluff Springs, Webberville, Merrilltown, Gilleland,
Cage’s Mill, and Hornsby Bend. During the 1850s, the amount of land in farms in what was
then Travis County increased from 73,300 acres to 1,363,500 acres. Corn was the primary field
crop, while cattle and sheep were the principal livestock. In 1860, farmers produced
137,700 bushels of corn and 27,900 bushels of wheat and had 58,000 cattle and 11,800 sheep.
The earliest schools in Travis County were private institutions that usually met in private
homes or in space donated by a church or Masonic lodge. More elaborate private facilities
began to appear by the late 1840s, including Colorado Female College in 1848, Austin Male
and Female Academy in 1849, Austin Female Academy in 1850, and Austin Collegiate Female
Institute in 1852. By 1850, Travis County also had 6 public schools serving a scholastic
population of 183. The county was divided into 19 common school districts in 1852. The state
established the Texas State Asylum for the Blind in Austin in 1856 and the Deaf and Dumb
School in 1857. Travis County became a center for higher education in the 1880s with the
establishment of the University of Texas in 1881, Tillotson Collegiate and Normal Institute in
1881, and Saint Edward's University in 1885. Samuel Huston College began holding classes in
the 1890s. The Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary opened in 1902, Texas Wesleyan
College Academy in 1912, Concordia Lutheran College in 1926, and the Episcopal Theological
Seminary of the Southwest in 1952. Austin Community College began operations in 1972. The
availability of schools resulted in a high level of education for a large portion of the county’s
population. In the 1940s, while more rural areas of the state reported that less than 10% of their
population over the age of 25 had high school diplomas, nearly 20% of Travis County residents
had graduated. By 1980, that number had jumped to 75%.
The earliest churches in Travis County were the Catholic missions relocated to the area
by the Spanish in 1730, but these were moved to San Antonio in 1731, and it was more than a
century before any organized religious practices were firmly established. In the 1830s, a variety
of religious groups began to appear—Methodist circuit riders held services along Gilleland

Creek in 1837 or 1838; Presbyterians organized a church in Austin in October 1839; Mormons
settled near Fort Coleman, Webberville, and Hornsby Bend in the late 1830s; and Catholic
priests, among them Jean Marie Odin, returned to the area in 1840. A Baptist church and a
Church of Christ were organized in Austin in 1847, a Lutheran church was established in New
Sweden and a Jewish synagogue in Austin began in 1876, and a Christian Science church
formed in Austin in 1889. In the early 1980s, Travis County’s 266 churches had an estimated
combined membership of 194,194; Catholic, Southern Baptist, and United Methodist were the
largest denominations.
In spite of the rapid growth that Travis County experienced during the 1850s, the area
was at that time still very much at the edge of the frontier. The absence of railroads meant that
goods had to be shipped by wagon to and from Houston and Port Lavaca, and poor roads
meant that goods sometimes could not be shipped at all. In 1852, the Austin Railroad
Association was established to encourage railroad construction to the area, and considerable
progress had been made by the late 1850s; however, the Civil War intervened, and work on
railroad acquisition was postponed. The Secession Convention convened in Austin on
28 January 1861. Although a group of Austin citizens staged a demonstration in favor of
secession, Unionist sentiment was high, and Travis County residents voted against secession,
704 to 450. Nevertheless, when the Civil War began, Travis County provided several hundred
volunteers, among them the Travis Rifles, the Tom Green Rifles, the Capitol Guard, and the
Austin City Light Infantry. In the 2 months between the end of the war and the arrival of federal
troops in the county, looting of farms and businesses was common. Although the inevitable
clashes between the Unionist forces and the former rebels resulted in the arrest of as many as
30 people per day, the presence of federal troops served to curb much of the lawlessness. By
early 1866, most of the federal soldiers had been mustered out of service, leaving only about
200 men to police the Austin area until the end of the military occupation in 1870. Austin was
the site of the constitutional conventions of 1866 and 1868-69 and witnessed both the removal
of Governor James W. Throckmorton in 1867 and the Coke-Davis Controversy in 1874. In the
gubernatorial election of 1869, Travis County residents favored Andrew J. Hamilton to Edmund
J. Davis by a margin of 798 to 593.
Like most areas in the south, Travis County suffered considerable economic hardship
immediately after the Civil War and throughout the Reconstruction period. Between 1864 and
1866, the county as a whole experienced a 49% loss in property tax receipts. Roughly 2/3 of
this property loss was in slaves, with the rest coming from declines in farm and livestock values,
each of which fell 25 to 40%. The county began to show signs of recovery by 1880. The overall
population rose from 13,153 in 1870 to 27,028 in 1880, and the 1880 census reported
1,912 farms, an increase of 656 over the 1870 totals. The amount of improved land rose from
83,200 acres in 1870 to 139,800 in 1880. Field crops such as corn, cotton, wheat, and oats
took up nearly half of the improved farmland, while livestock dominated the rest.
Economic recovery was facilitated by the arrival of the Houston and Texas Central
Railway, which completed its track to Austin in 1871, and the International and Great Northern
Railroad, which was built between Rockdale and Austin in 1876 and completed from Austin to
Laredo in 1881. The Austin and Northwestern Railroad laid track between Austin and Burnet in

1882, and the Missouri, Kansas and Texas line arrived in 1904. Communities besides Austin
that benefited directly from easy railroad access included Pflugerville, Manor, Oak Hill, and
Manchaca.
After the war, many former slaves remained in the area. In the year after the war, the
black population increased by 60%, while the white population rose by only 12%. By 1870,
black residents numbered 4,647, comprising 35% of the county's total population. Clarksville,
Kincheonville, Masontown, and Wheatville were among the communities established by former
slaves. The number of black residents in Travis County continued to increase steadily, reaching
13,299 in 1900. It fluctuated between 13,000 and 15,000 from 1900 to 1930, but increased
rapidly thereafter, rising to 22,493 in 1950, 32,270 in 1970, and 63,173 in 1990. Because other
segments of the population grew at an even faster rate, the percentage of black residents, with
respect to the total population, declined significantly, falling to 20% by 1930 and 11% by 1990.
Contributing to the shift in the ethnic makeup of the county was a variety of immigrant groups,
the most prominent of which were German, Swedish, and Mexican. By the turn of the century,
8% of the population was composed of natives of 1 of these countries. Although the early
Swedish and German settlers contributed to the diversity of Travis County through their religious
and educational institutions, the Mexican influence was also reinforced by the continued arrival
of large numbers of new immigrants fleeing the unrest of the Mexican Revolution in the early
20th century. The 1930 census reported that 10,225 residents, or 13% of the county’s total
population, were of Hispanic descent; by 1990, the number of Hispanic residents had risen to
121,689, or 21%.
In 1890, Travis County had 36,322 residents. Of these, 14,575 lived in Austin, which
was fast outgrowing its efforts to become a modern city. Innovations and improvements in
progress at that time included a trolley system and water-generated electricity, but most of its
streets remained unpaved. By the turn of the century several hundred assorted businesses
filled the needs of the 22,000 Austin residents. Yet, in spite of this rapid increase in Austin’s
population, the majority of the county’s residents lived on farms or in smaller towns, and
agriculture dominated the area economy. Cotton became the principal field crop in the late
1880s and remained so for more than 60 years. The 1890 census reported 65,000 acres—
nearly 30% of the county's improved farmland—planted in cotton; by the turn of the century, the
amount of land devoted to cotton had increased to 113,300 acres, or 56% of the improved
farmland. However, as more marginal land was used and the soil became depleted, production
levels fell; in 1930, 143,000 acres produced only 19,000 bales. By the late 1950s, cotton
accounted for only 26% of the total cropland harvested, and by 1980 it had fallen to only 8%.
Farm tenancy had increased steadily since the 1890s and peaked in 1930, with tenants
operating 2/3 of the 3,642 farms. The number of farms fell by more than 1,000 in the 1930s, as
many tenant farmers either moved away or turned to other occupations. Farmers who remained
in the area began to devote more of their resources to crops other than cotton and to livestock.
The number of cattle increased from 32,000 in 1920 and to 51,000 in 1950; the number of
sheep and goats increased as well, boosting wool and mohair production from 23,600 and
4,292 pounds, respectively, in 1920, and to 127,800 and 183,600 pounds in 1959. By the late
1960s, hay and sorghum combined to account for 60% of the cropland harvested.

Proposed Dell Medical School Phase 1 Project, Austin, Travis County, Texas

The Great Depression was slow to hit Travis County, but, by the mid-1930s, many
people were unemployed and very glad of the New Deal programs that resulted in work paving
streets; building bridges, sewers, and parks; and constructing the tower of the University of
Texas campus. In part because of the job opportunities made available through relief projects,
state government, and the university community, the population increased by 43% in the 1930s,
rising from 77,777 in 1930 to 111,053 in 1940. One major job-producing project in the 1930s
was the construction of a series of dams on the Colorado River. Austin and Travis County had
begun efforts to tame the Colorado as early as 1869, when the army built a pontoon bridge
across the river. In 1893, the City of Austin completed a dam designed to provide power for its
water and electrical systems. By 1899, the city was already experiencing power shortfalls, and
a major flood in 1900 destroyed the dam. Another flood in 1915 washed out the repairs that
were underway, and the project was abandoned. The flood of 1935 put much of downtown
Austin under water, and the area’s interest in a lasting flood-control system was renewed. The
Lower Colorado River Authority was established and a series of dams was built, forming Lake
Austin, Lake Travis, Lake Buchanan, Lake Lyndon B. Johnson, Inks Lake, and Lake Marble
Falls.
Travis County also profited from the establishment of several military bases. Camp
Mabry in northwest Austin, established as the main Texas National Guard facility in 1890,
served as an army training center during World War I. After the US became involved in World
War II, the Del Valle Army Air Base, soon renamed Bergstrom Army Air Field, was established
in southeast Travis County. After the war was over, the presence of military personnel
continued to bring changes to the county. Thousands of returning veterans enrolled in the local
colleges and universities, greatly increasing the student population as well as intensifying the
demand for housing and the growth of service industries.
In the 1950s and 1960s, Travis County underwent 2 significant developments. The first
of these was desegregation. The Sweatt v. Painter decision in 1950 pushed the University of
Texas to the forefront in the fight for civil rights, leading it to become the first southern university
to admit blacks as undergraduates, although it was not until 1962 that all of the university’s
facilities were fully integrated. Public schools in Travis County began to follow suit in 1955.
Local Mexican-American organizations also achieved a measure of success against
discriminatory practices. Some local businesses resisted these changes, prompting strikes and
protests in the 1960s, but in the end desegregation was accomplished without the violence
prevalent in other urban areas of the country. The change became even more visible as blacks
and Hispanics were elected to public office—Wilhelmina Delco to the school board in 1968 and
to the Texas House of Representatives in 1976; Berl Handcox to the Austin city council in 1971;
Richard Moya to the Travis County commissioner’s court in 1970; and Gonzalo Barrientos to the
Texas House of Representatives in 1974.
The second major development was the
establishment of several high-tech industries. In 1951, a small, local company became Texas
Instruments, and in 1955 Tracor, Incorporated, made Austin its base of operations.
International Business Machines opened an Austin branch in 1967, followed by Motorola in
1974. These companies, along with Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation
(1983), Dell Computers (1984), and Sematech (1988), became the county’s largest employers.

Chapter 4.0: Cultural Background

From the end of Reconstruction to the present, most Travis County residents chose to
support Democratic presidential candidates, with exceptions in 1896, 1928, 1952, 1956, 1972,
and 1984. Occasionally, a third-party candidate drew a sizable portion of the vote, but only 3 of
them—the Greenback-Labor candidate in 1880, George Wallace in 1968, and John Anderson in
1984—garnered sufficient support to affect the county’s overall election results. In state
elections, Travis County residents were staunchly Democratic. In the early 1980s, 63% of the
land in Travis County was devoted to farms and ranches. About 23% of the farmland was under
cultivation, with sorghum, hay, wheat, and cotton accounting for nearly 70% of the 94,000 acres
harvested; other crops included potatoes, sweet potatoes, peaches, and pecans. Sixty-six
percent of the county’s $32 million in agricultural receipts came from livestock and livestock
products, the most important ones being cattle, milk, sheep, wool, and hogs. Although
agriculture remained an important aspect of the local economy, farm receipts were greatly
surpassed by the income generated by non-agricultural industries. Professional and related
services, manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, and government administration involved
70% of the work force in the 1980s; of the rest, 7% were self-employed and 3% employed
outside the county.
Since shortly after the turn of the century, the majority of Travis County residents had
resided in the City of Austin. The jobs made available by the growth of the high-tech industries
reinforced that trend, and, by 1970, 85% of the 295,516 residents lived in the capital city. In the
1970s and 1980s, however, residential development near Lake Travis encouraged many people
to move away from the city, and although Austin continued to grow at a rapid pace, the number
of residents choosing to live near the lake and in northern and southern suburbs increased at an
even faster rate. By 1990, Lago Vista (2,199), Jonestown (1,250), Briarcliff (335), Lakeway
(4,044), and Pflugerville (4,444) in Travis County, as well as Round Rock and even Georgetown
in Williamson County, had become popular alternatives to living in Austin. Like the rest of
Texas, Travis County weathered a serious economic downturn in the mid-1980s; newly-built
office space sat empty, and many people lost their jobs. Added to this was news that Bergstrom
Air Force Base was scheduled to close. In the early 1990s, however, plans were underway to
convert the Bergstrom site into a new municipal airport, and the county was looking forward to a
period of growth. The population of Travis County was reported at 576,407 in 1990, an increase
of 37% from 1980. Among the area’s most prevalent concerns was that future growth should
not destroy the ecological balance of environmentally sensitive areas in the western hills.

5.0 RESEARCH OBJECTIVES AND METHODOLOGY

The archeological survey described in this report was undertaken with 3 primary
research goals in mind:
1. To locate and record historic-age and aboriginal cultural resources occurring within
the designated project area
2. To provide a preliminary assessment of the significance of these resources regarding
their potential for designation as SALs
3. To make recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their SAL
assessments
The first of these goals was accomplished by means of a review of documentation on file
at the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC) online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas), the
National Park Service’s (NPS) online National Register Information System (NRIS), the Texas
State Historical Association’s (TSHA) Handbook of Texas Online, the Austin History Center, the
Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), the Texas State Library and Archives
Commission (TSLAC), and UT’s online Perry-Castañeda Library Map Collection, as well as a
program of reconnaissance-level historic structures survey and intensive archeological survey.
The assessment of significance, evaluation of SAL eligibility, and recommendations concerning
the management of cultural resources documented during this project are presented in
Chapter 6.0, Results of Investigations, and Chapter 7.0, Summary and Recommendations. The
rest of this chapter presents the results of archival and historic map research, the
methodological background for the current investigations, and the specific survey methods used
in the field.

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Prior to initiating fieldwork, Horizon personnel reviewed existing information on the
THC’s online Atlas and the NPS’s NRIS database for information on previously recorded
archeological sites and previous archeological investigations conducted within a 305-m (1,000ft) radius of the project area. Based on this archival research, 7 previously recorded
archeological sites (2 of which are archeological site trinomials assigned to the NRHP-listed

35

Chapter 5.0: Research Objectives and Methodology

Little Campus and City Cemetery), 3 historic properties listed on the NRHP, and 2 historic
districts listed on the NRHP have been documented within the archival review area (Table 5-1).
Five previously recorded archeological sites are present within the archival review area
that are not listed on the NRHP (i.e., excluding site 41TV1706, the City Cemetery Historic
District, and site 41TV611, the Little Campus). Of these 5 sites, site 41TV2304 consists of an
extensive scatter of mid-20th-century historic-age trash and fill deposits recorded on the city
block south of East 15th Street during a cultural resources survey conducted for the Waller
Creek Tunnel Project by Ecological Communications Corporation, Inc., in 2010 (Feit and Rose
2010). Site 41TV2304 was determined to be ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and for
designation as an SAL. However, no site forms are on file on the THC’s online Atlas for the

remaining 4 sites, and no information about the type, date, or NRHP eligibility of these 4 sites is
available. None of these 5 previously recorded sites are located within the current project area,
and these sites would have no potential to be disturbed by the proposed undertaking.
In addition, 3 historic properties and 2 historic districts are present within the archival
review area that are listed on the NRHP. One of these NRHP-listed properties, the Little
Campus (also designated as site 41TV611) falls partially within the northeastern portion of the
current project area. At the time of its NRHP nomination in 1974, this historic property had
6 contributing buildings built between 1857 and 1912 that have served a broad range of
functions over the years, including an asylum for the blind, World Wars I and II military facilities,
a state hospital, and university buildings. Between the NRHP nomination in 1974 and the SAL
designation of the campus in 1981, several buildings had been razed. The SAL designation
covers only the extant buildings—the Arno Nowotny Building (formerly Building C) and John W.
Hargis Hall (formerly Buildings H and K). Currently, the Little Campus is owned and operated
by UT and the buildings house various university offices. In connection with the proposed
construction of the Dell Medical School, Phase I, UT proposes to utilize the interior courtyard of
the Little Campus as a parking lot to accommodate overflow parking from the Erwin Center after
the current overflow parking lot is removed. None of the contributing buildings of the NRHPlisted Little Campus would be modified during the construction and use of the temporary parking
lot. The temporary parking lot will be removed and the Little Campus courtyard will be restored
to its current park setting in the future after the functions of the Erwin Center have been
relocated elsewhere. No investigations were conducted by Horizon in the vicinity of the Little
Campus as the proposed temporary parking lot facility was added to the proposed project
design after Horizon’s field investigations were completed. UT has retained the services of
ARCHITEXAS, a preservation architecture firm, to oversee the construction of the temporary
parking lot and future restoration of the Little Campus courtyard in consultation with the THC; as
such, this portion of the project area was not included within the scope of Horizon’s current
investigations. The remaining 2 NRHP-listed historic projects and 3 NRHP-listed historic
districts are located outside the boundaries of the project area and would have no potential to
be adversely affected by the proposed undertaking.
Several previous cultural resources surveys have been conducted in downtown Austin
surrounding the project area, but no previous cultural resources surveys have been conducted
within the project area.

5.2

HISTORIC MAP RESEARCH

The City of Austin was officially founded in 1839 as the result of a search for a
permanent seat of government for the Republic of Texas initiated by Mirbeau Lamar, then the
President of the Republic of Texas. The community already existed as the small town of
Waterloo, but was renamed to honor Stephen F. Austin and chosen as the seat of the Texas
government. The town was planned and plotted by Judge Edwin Waller. The east-to-westoriented streets were named after trees, except for Water Street, which ran along the Colorado
River, and the north-to-south-oriented streets were named after rivers corresponding to their
relative geographic positions within the territory Lamar aspired to claim for Texas, with the

westernmost street named Rio Grande and the easternmost street named Red River. East and
West avenues framed the eastern and western limits of the town, respectively. Waller’s town
plan included regularly spaced public squares, a capitol square near the north end of town, and
an arsenal block located in the southeastern corner of town, and even included land set aside
for a college (Figure 5-1). The majority of Austin’s early development was centered around
Waller Creek. Waller’s town plan extended only as far north as North Avenue (now 15th Street),
and the current project area therefore does not appear on Waller’s 1839 town plan map.
Because of its isolated location, Austin’s growth was unsteady until after the US
annexed Texas in 1846. Through the 1850s, several prominent buildings were constructed,
including the capitol complex (although a new capitol building was constructed in 1888 after a
fire destroyed the original), the General Land Office, the Travis County Courthouse, and the
Governor's Mansion. In 1871, the Houston and Central Texas Railroad came through Austin,
increasing access to larger cities like San Antonio, Houston, and Galveston and thereby
growing Austin’s economy and population in the process. In 1881, The Tillotson Institute for
black education opened on East Avenue and Mesquite Street (now 11th Street), making it the
first university in the city. It was quickly followed by UT in 1883, and the first portion of the
campus that was opened bordered Waller Creek.
The earliest historic map showing the current project area in any detail is a topographic
map of the City of Austin dated 1872 (Figure 5-2). By 1872, the gridded town plan of the City of
Austin had been expanded 4 additional blocks northward from Waller’s original 1839 town plan
as far north as Magnolia Street, now known as MLK Boulevard (formerly 19th Street). At this
time, the current project area was located in the northeastern corner of town and incorporated
all or portions of 14 individual city blocks (Blocks 59 to 67, 70, and 71). This included the block
formerly bounded by Linden and Chestnut streets (now 17th and 18th streets) and by Neches
and Trinity streets, which did not have a numerical designation but which seems to have been
included within Block 57 to the north.
By 1873, Augustis Koch’s “Bird’s Eye” map of Austin shows that limited residential
development had expanded into the current project area, though several blocks remained
largely or entirely undeveloped (Figure 5-3). Specifically, Blocks 57, 58, 60, and 66 contained
up to 6 or 7 structures each; Blocks 65 and 67 contained 1 or 2 structures each; and
construction of several of the buildings that composed the Texas State Asylum for the Blind
(now known as the Little Campus), had been completed in Block 71. This map depicts Waller
Creek flowing more or less within the ROW of Neches Street, though it is not clear whether or
not any permanent bridges had been constructed over Waller Creek along major street
crossings at this time.
While not particularly informative, a plat map of the City of Austin dated 1886 derived
from the Texas Historic Overlay map database (Foster et al. 2006) shows that development was
beginning to spread north of Magnolia Street (now MLK Boulevard; formerly 19th Street) and
east of East Avenue (Figure 5-4).
By 1887, the second edition of Augustis Koch’s “Bird’s Eye” map of Austin shows that
residential development had progressed substantially within the current project area, with most

blocks having filled in with residential development with the exception of Block 61, which
remained undeveloped (Figure 5-5). Construction of the remaining buildings that composed the
Asylum for the Blind (now known as the Little Campus) appears to have been completed in
Blocks 64 and 71. Also, bridges crossing Waller Creek on Cherry Street (now 16th Street) and
Chestnut Street (now 18th Street) had been constructed. The Cherry Street (16th Street) bridge
appears to have been a relatively substantial structure, whereas the Chestnut Street (18th
Street) bridge was somewhat smaller. Waller Creek apparently continued to flow within or
immediately adjacent to the Neches Street ROW, and it is possible that the segment of Waller
Creek between Linden and Chestnut streets (17th and 18th streets) had been somewhat
rechannelized, possibly to assist with flooding, though it is also possible that the apparently
modified course of the creek is simply an artifact of varying degrees of accuracy between the
1873 and 1887 Bird’s Eye maps.
Austin’s infrastructure was poor through the early 1900s—many of the city’s roads, even
those downtown, remained unpaved until the 1930s. There was no sewer system, and waste
was dumped in backyard trash pits and privies, and also directly into Waller Creek, as late as
the 1930s and 1940s. Citywide garbage collection did not begin until the 1930s and 1940s.
Lyndon Baines Johnson’s election to the US Senate played a large role in the modernization of
Austin and Central Texas, in the form of millions of federal dollars for large-scale civil
engineering projects. In 1938, Johnson referred to the homes in the area around Waller Creek
as “shanties” and “hot beds of crime.” Houses built close to the creek were prone to flooding,
and were often more haphazardly built than those farther from the creek’s banks. In 1915, flash
floods caused 12 deaths along Waller Creek and washed away numerous homes (Figures 5-6
and 5-7). Flooding made the area less and less desirable for residential development, and
eventually the neighborhood was overtaken by commercial, municipal, and educational
interests.
The neighborhoods surrounding Waller Creek have historically been home to a diverse
population. Between the 1840s and 1870s, the lower Waller Creek area, between Water Street
(now Cesar Chavez Street) and Pecan Street (now 6th Street), was home to large houses
belonging to the area’s wealthiest families. However, as infrastructure improvements remained
stagnant, frequent flooding, dirty streets, and a lack of electricity led the wealthier white
residents to move west and north of downtown, leaving the lower Waller Creek area as a
predominantly working class area through the end of the 19th century (Table 5-2). The more
northerly Waller Creek neighborhoods, including the current project area, were not heavily
developed until the 1870s.
A Sanborn Fire Insurance Map dated 1900 (Figure 5-8) shows that the project area was
composed mainly of houses, with the exception of the Texas State Asylum for the Blind, and the
locations of specific structures largely mirror those shown on Augustis Koch’s 1887 “Birds’ Eye”
map (see Figure 5-5). The homes became progressively smaller the closer they came to Waller
Creek, and often seemed to disregard standard lot designations. Block 61 remained
undeveloped at this time, possibly as a result of flooding along Waller Creek. By 1900, the eastto-west-oriented streets, originally named after trees, had been renamed according to the
current numbered system, with street numbers increasing from south to north.

By 1935, as shown on the Sanborn Fire Insurance map of that year (Figure 5-9), many
of the smaller creekside houses visible on the 1900 map had disappeared, likely lost to flooding,
and been replaced with more substantial structures. The blocks located immediately east of
Waller Creek (Blocks 60, 61, and 62) were much more densely populated by 1935, and this is
the first map to show any development whatsoever within Block 61. The 1935 map also shows
an influx of commercial storefronts and industrial buildings in the area, particularly along the
Red River Street corridor. There was a paper factory next door to a tile shop at the
southwestern corner of Red River and 16th streets, a furniture shop on the west side of Red
River Street between 17th and 18th streets), and a Baptist church at the southeast corner of
Red River and 16th streets. The church does not appear to have had any affiliated graveyard or
cemetery. Concrete bridges are shown at the crossings of 15th and 16th streets over Waller
Creek, a footbridge is shown at the 17th Street crossing, and a bridge of unspecified type is
shown at the 18th Street crossing. UT had acquired the former Texas State Asylum for the
Blind property, renamed as the Little Campus, and several university offices had been relocated
to these buildings, including the Bureau of Economic Geology, the Division of Extension, and
several dormitories. The US Department of Agriculture also had an office on the Little Campus.
The segment of Neches Street located north of the westward bend of the Waller Creek channel
between 18th and 19th streets is noted as “impassable” at this time.
Even after the structures closest to Waller Creek began to clear out, flooding continued
to be a problem throughout the area, particularly for UT. After a flood in 1951 severely
damaged several university buildings, the administration decided to straighten and deepen the
Waller Creek channel in 1954, when they also added 2 new pedestrian bridges (Kelsey 1961).
Historic aerial photographs show that the city blocks within the project area remained largely
residential until the 1970s, though the resolution of the available images is too low to distinguish
the trajectory of development on any individual lots (Figures 5-10 and 5-11). By 1973, UT had
built its School of Nursing off the west side of Red River Street between 17th and 18th streets,
replacing the residential structures that had formerly occupied this block (Figure 5-12).
In 1975, local urban planners, architects, and landscape architects began formulating
long-range plans for redeveloping Waller Creek. Since then, numerous efforts have been made
to improve the area in terms of land use, beautification, transportation, and flood control. By

1988, UT had acquired the remainder of the city blocks that formerly composed the project area,
removed the ROWs of all of the interior east-to-west-oriented streets (except for limited areas
located adjacent to the bridges over Waller Creek on 16th and 18th streets), and removed all of
the interior north-to-south-oriented street ROWs except for Red River Street. Red River Street
was rerouted from its original straight alignment to its current curvilinear alignment. UT’s
Penick-Allison Tennis Center was constructed in Blocks 57, 58, and 59 off the east side of
Trinity Street between 16th and 18th streets, the Erwin Center was constructed in the area
between the eastern project area boundary and the southbound frontage road of IH 35, and a
parking lot was constructed in Block 67 at the northeastern corner of 15th Street and the
rerouted Red River Street. In 1983, Centennial Park was dedicated to UT on the occasion of
the 100th anniversary of the university’s founding, and the remaining residential blocks within
the project area that were not already the sites of UT buildings and facilities were transformed
into a park. By 1988, the project area had assumed its current configuration (Figure 5-13). At
the present time, none of the original residential structures are standing within the project area.

ARCHEOLOGICAL SURVEY METHODS

Prior to initiating archeological fieldwork, Horizon met with Mark Denton, program
coordinator, and Brad Jones, terrestrial archeologist, of the THC’s archeology division, and
Sarah Birchet, historian—federal programs, of the THC’s history programs division to discuss
and approve of the investigative methods to be utilized during the archeological fieldwork, and a
program composed of a combination of limited trackhoe trenching and shovel testing was
settled upon. The 1935 Sanborn Fire Insurance Map was used as a template to target the
locations of former structure locations during trenching efforts (Figures 5-14 and 5-15) to
determine if any subsurface structure foundations and cultural features associated with the late
19th- to mid-20th century residential occupations were extant within the project area.
However, numerous factors constrained the number of locations in which trenches could
be excavated. Subsurface investigations were precluded across large portions of the project
area due to the presence of built facilities, including UT’s Penick-Allison Tennis Center, the
current Red River Street ROW (which had been realigned from its original historic ROW), a
parking lot located south of the Erwin Center complex, remnants of paved roadway areas
adjacent to the 16th and 18th street bridges across Waller Creek, and numerous sidewalks and
subsurface utility ROWs. In addition, numerous large pecan and oak trees designated as
Heritage Trees (i.e., those with a diameter of 24 inches or more) under City of Austin Heritage
Tree Ordinance No. 20100204-038 are located throughout the project area, and subsurface
excavations within the drip-line of these trees was not permitted. As a result of these
considerations, trenching efforts were constrained to 2 clusters of trenches, including
(1) 5 trenches in an open park area in the southwestern portion of the project area bounded by
East 15th Street on the south, Waller Creek on the east, the UT tennis courts on the north, and
Trinity Street on the west, and (2) 3 trenches in a contoured terrace area on the east side of
Waller Creek bounded by Waller Creek to the west and a sculpture garden containing 3 Charles
Umlauf sculptures, sidewalks, and associated landscaping to the east (Figures 5-16 and 5-17).
The northern half of the project area was inaccessible for trenching efforts due to the
narrowness of the extant landforms present between constructed facilities and the steep banks

of Waller Creek and the large number of subsurface utilities traversing the area; consequently,
this area was investigated via a combination of inspection of the modern ground surface and
shovel testing. A total of 20 shovel tests were excavated during the survey to complement the
trenching efforts (see Figures 5-16 and 5-17).
Archeological field investigations were conducted between July 1 and 3, 2013. Jeffrey
D. Owens served as Horizon’s Principal Investigator; Jennifer Cochran served as archeological
field supervisor; Jared Wiersema and Chris Carrel served as trackhoe operators on different
days; Chris Lamon and Mr. Wiersema assisted with monitoring the excavation of trackhoe
trenches on different days; and Briana Nicole Smith conducted shovel testing on the third and
final day of fieldwork. For block-area projects, the Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey
Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 1 subsurface probe per 2 acres for projects
measuring between 10 and 20 acres in size. Thus, a total of 12 subsurface probes would be
required within the approximately 9.1-ha (22.5-ac) project area. Horizon exceeded the
TSMASS minimum requirements by excavating a total of 8 trackhoe trenches and 20 shovel
tests. Three of the 20 shovel tests were excavated just beyond the boundaries of the project
area on the northern bank of Waller Creek just south of UT’s Trinity Parking Garage to
investigate the archeological potential of this area. The archeological survey was conducted
under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 6578.
Shovel tests measured 30 centimeters (cm) in diameter and were excavated to a target
depth of 1.0 m (3.3 ft) below surface, to the top of pre-Holocene deposits, or to the maximum
depth practicable. In practice, shovel tests were terminated at depths ranging from 15 to 35 cm
below surface (cmbs) due to the presence of a shallowly buried stratum of decomposing
limestone bedrock. All sediments were screened through 6.35-millimeter (mm) (0.25-inch)
hardware cloth. Standard shovel test logs were completed noting the sediment characteristics,
depths, and presence or absence of cultural materials, and each shovel test was refilled with
excavated sediments upon completion of recording. The Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)
coordinates of all shovel tests were determined using a hand-held Garmin ForeTrex Global
Positioning System (GPS) device based on the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83).
Specific shovel test data for all 20 shovel tests excavated during the survey are summarized in
Appendix A.
Trackhoe trenches were excavated using a 0.3-m- (1.0-ft-) wide bucket to minimize the
damage to the landscape. Trenches varied in length from 2.1 to 20.7 m (6.9 to 67.9 ft) in length.
Seven of the 8 trenches were excavated to depths ranging from 40 to 90 cmbs due to the
presence of shallowly buried decomposing limestone bedrock across the majority of the project
area, though 1 trench located east of Waller Creek was excavated to a depth of 150 cmbs
through a deep deposit of historic-age fill before encountering bedrock, terminating at a final
depth of 170 cmbs. Standard trench forms were completed noting the sediment characteristics,
depths, and presence or absence of cultural materials, and sketch profiles and plans of any
notable features within each trench were drawn. Each trench was refilled with excavated
sediments upon completion of recording, and the landscape was restored as close as possible
to its original condition using a combination of geotextile fabric and bermudagrass seed and
sod.

Archeological and Historical Investigations for the
Proposed Dell Medical School Phase 1 Project, Austin, Travis County, Texas

A ubiquitous scatter of early to mid-20th-century construction materials, domestic debris,
and remnants of a small number of subsurface structural remains associated with the 20thcentury residential occupations within the project area, as well as a very small number of
aboriginal lithic artifacts, was observed throughout the portions of the project area not covered
by built facilities. These archeological deposits were recorded as site 41TV2440. During the
survey, a standard site recording form was used to record pertinent information on location,
physiographic setting, and local environmental characteristics; types and quantities of artifacts
observed; distribution and densities of artifacts; artificial and natural impacts; and the condition
of surface and any subsurface archeological deposits. The site was thoroughly photodocumented using color digital photography, and a photographic log was maintained of all
photographs taken. Based on the information recorded on the standard archeological site
recording form used in the field, a Texas Archeological Data Site Form was completed using the
most recent version of the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory’s (TARL) TexSite
archeological data collection software, and the form was submitted to TARL.
TARL
subsequently provided a permanent archeological site trinomial.
A representative sample of cultural materials observed during the shovel testing and
trenching efforts were collected, including all of the small assemblage of aboriginal lithic artifacts
and a small but representative sample of historic-age artifacts. Collected artifacts were placed
in resealable plastic bags labeled with relevant provenience information and transported to
Horizon’s laboratory facilities in Austin, Texas, for cleaning, sorting, and classification.
Appendix C presents a tabulation of the sample of historic-age and aboriginal artifacts collected
during the survey. Due to the relatively common nature of the collected sample of artifacts and
their minimal potential to contribute to any future research endeavors, it is Horizon’s opinion that
the sample collection does not warrant permanent curation at an approved curation facility. As
such, Horizon proposes to return the cultural materials to UT, the project sponsor and current
landowner, for disposal.
On June 26, 2013, Jeffrey D. Owens, Horizon Principal Investigator, accompanied by
Kathryn St. Clair, CP&Y, Inc. (CP&Y), architectural historian, and Sarah Kobetis, CP&Y
preservation specialist, conducted a walkover of the project area to identify historic-age
structures and objects. During this reconnaissance-level historic structures inventory survey,
5 bridges (the 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, and Trinity street bridges), 3 of which are of historic age
(the 16th, 18th, and Trinity Street bridges); 1 historic-age house (the Arthur P. Watson House);
and 1 historic property listed on the NRHP and designated as an SAL (the Little Campus) were
identified within and adjacent to the boundaries of the project area. These historic resources
were thoroughly photo-documented. Ms. St. Clair and Ms. Birchet subsequently evaluated each
historic-age resource based on its eligibility for designation as an SAL and provided the written
descriptions and assessments presented in the following chapter.

6.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

As a result of a reconnaissance-level historic structures inventory survey, 5 bridges (the
15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, and Trinity street bridges), 3 of which are of historic age (i.e., 45 years of
age or older)—the 16th, 18th, and Trinity Street bridges; 1 historic-age house (the Arthur P.
Watson House); and 1 historic property listed on the NRHP and designated as an SAL (the Little
Campus) were identified within and adjacent to the boundaries of the project area (Figure 6-1).
During the archeological survey, an extensive multiple-component historic-age and aboriginal
archeological site was documented within the project area that has been recorded as site
41TV2440. The historic-age structures and archeological resources documented during the
survey are described in the following sections of this chapter.
Two of the 5 bridges located within the project area are modern (i.e., 45 years of age or
less). The first of the 2 modern bridges, the 15th Street bridge, is a concrete arch-bridge with a
5-lane roadway and sidewalks on either side, that was most likely constructed circa 1970 to
replace an earlier, smaller bridge over Waller Creek (Figures 6-2 and 6-3). TxDOT records
indicate that a bridge was originally constructed at this location in 1916 and later widened in
1931. The first mention of a bridge at this location encountered during the historic map
research occurs on the 1935 Sanborn Fire Insurance Map (see Figure 5-9). The bridge,
abutments, and adjacent retaining walls have undergone numerous repairs and
reconfigurations. According to TxDOT, this bridge is considered ineligible for designation as an
SAL (Mark Brown, personal communication with Kathryn St. Clair, June 6, 2013).
The second modern bridge, the 17th Street bridge, is a wooden pedestrian footbridge
built circa 1980 (Figures 6-4 and 6-5). This bridge replaced an earlier bridge within the same
location, as indicated by 2 concrete piers that remain underneath, though which do not support,
the current footbridge (Figure 6-6). The earliest mention of a bridge at this location encountered
during the historic map research occurs on the 1935 Sanborn Fire Insurance Map (see Figure 59). A photograph from the Austin History Center dated 1972 indicates that the earlier bridge at
this location was a metal truss bridge that was supported on the concrete piers (Figure 6-7).
This earlier bridge likely supported vehicles, as indicated by truss design. While the 2 concrete
piers that remain underneath, though not supporting, the modern footbridge at this location likely
are of historic age, no other remnants of the earlier bridge are extant, and the concrete piers are
recommended as ineligible for designation as SALs.

HISTORIC-AGE STRUCTURES AND OBJECTS

6.1.1

16th Street Bridge and Retaining Walls

The 16th Street bridge is located at the crossing of the former ROW of 16th Street over
Waller Creek (Figures 6-8 and 6-9). This bridge is a double-arch bridge that was originally
constructed from rough-cut limestone bricks, although it has since been encased in concrete
(Figures 6-10 and 6-11), and remnants of limestone brick retaining walls are still visible on the
banks of Waller Creek on both the northern and southern sides of the bridge (see Figure 6-9).
The original arch brickwork is still visible from the creek bed and in scattered areas adjacent to
the sidewalks atop the bridge where the concrete coating has chipped off (see Figures 6-10 and
6-11). The former ROW of 16th Street proper has been removed and no longer provides
through-passage across the project area between Trinity Street to the west and Red River
Street to the east, though remnants of pavement and curbing remain atop and immediately
adjacent to the bridge that may date from a time when the bridge still supported vehicular traffic
(Figure 6-12 to 6-14).
The earliest evidence of a bridge at this location encountered during the historic map
research occurs on Augustis Koch’s 1887 “Bird’s Eye” map of Austin (see Figure 5-5). It has
not been verified if any of the remaining limestone masonry visible within the bridge structure
itself or the adjacent retaining walls are remnants of the original late 19th-century bridge, though
the bridge shown on Koch’s 1887 map appears to have been relatively substantial, so it is
possible that some of the visible limestone brick remnants are original to the structures.
However, according to TxDOT, limestone masonry continued to be used for aesthetic effect for
bridge construction in Austin well into the 20th century; as such, an early 20th-century
construction date for the bridge is considered to be the most likely:
While stone masonry construction was most widespread on work-relief projects, some
cities also used the material for aesthetic effect during the early part of the twentieth
century, into the Depression period. The most notable use of stone as a construction
material for non-work-relief municipal projects was as a component of Austin's city
beautification program. Considered the most "artistic" choice for small or medium spans,
a number of stone arches were constructed on principal streets crossing Shoal Creek
and Waller Creek (Jensen 1992, p. 73).

The original bridge at 16th Street likely fell into this category of small-span stone arch
bridges built in Austin in the early 20th century. The original bridge appears to have consisted
of only a single stone arch over the creek; however, an additional, smaller masonry arch was
added immediately east of the original arch, most likely when the creek was straightened and
widened in the early 1950s. The current bridge has metal parapets and 2 sidewalks on either
side as well as a small center roadway used by university vehicles (see Figures 6-12 to 6-14).
As the original 16th Street ROW has been removed between Trinity and Red River
streets, the bridge at this location in its current incarnation is used primarily by pedestrians and
by university vehicles, though the bridge may have supported vehicular traffic as late as the
1970s, at which time UT removed most of the major cross-streets within the project area (see
Figure 5-12).

The 16th Street bridge and retaining walls are associated with early flood-management
efforts in the City of Austin. The bridge and retaining walls are linked visually and functionally to
other, similar bridges along Waller Creek; however, the 16th Street bridge and retaining walls
have been significantly altered and lack integrity of materials, design, and workmanship. There
are much better extant examples of the early Waller Creek bridge crossings, including the
stone-arch bridges at 6th and 7th streets. As such, the 16th Street bridge and adjacent
retaining walls are recommended as ineligible for designation as SALs.
6.1.2

18th Street Bridge and Retaining Wall

Approximately 2 blocks north of the 16th Street bridge is another historic-age, singlearch concrete masonry bridge located at the crossing of the former ROW of 18th Street over
Waller Creek (Figure 6-15). This bridge originally may have been configured with a smaller
limestone arch similar to the 16th Street bridge, though it has been significantly altered. The
current configuration was likely widened in the 1950s when Waller Creek was straightened and
widened to incorporate a larger concrete arch (Figure 6-16), though the decorative balustrade
was retained (Figure 6-17). Similar to the retaining walls observed adjacent to the 16th Street
bridge, remnants of retaining walls are visible to the south of the 18th Street bridge that are
constructed from limestone bricks (Figure 6-18). However, the 18th Street bridge retaining
walls’ bricks are less roughly cut, dry-laid, and likely more recent. The bridge has a decorative
concrete masonry parapet and balustrade that is deteriorating in several places, exposing steel
rebar (see Figure 6-17). There are concrete stairways at the southeastern and southwestern

corners that lead from the bridge down to the adjacent terrace. A metal railing has been
installed at the approach to the bridge, and wire mesh has been placed over the crumbling
masonry to stabilize it (see Figure 6-17). Remnants of what appear to be lamppost settings, or
settings for some other type of electric lighting, are visible near the eastern corner of the
concrete parapet (Figure 6-19). The bridge supports a paved, 2-lane throughway that likely
represents the road surface of the former 18th Street ROW, though concrete pylons have been
constructed within the ROW that currently prevent vehicular access (Figure 6-20). The bridge
may have supported vehicular through-traffic as late as the 1970s, at which time UT removed
most of the major cross-streets within the project area (see Figure 5-12).
The earliest evidence of a bridge at this location encountered during the historic map
research occurs on Augustis Koch’s 1887 “Bird’s Eye” map of Austin (see Figure 5-5), though
the bridge configuration appears to have been widened in the 1950s when the channel of Waller
Creek was straightened and widened. The 18th Street bridge in its current configuration is likely
associated with Austin’s City Beautification Program as it exhibits stylistic details in the
balustrade and end posts. The bridge and retaining wall remnants are also associated with the
flood and channel management of Waller Creek. However, the bridge has undergone
numerous rehabilitation efforts, and the decorative balustrade is in poor condition. Whereas
there once were prominent houses perched along 18th Street, these have since been replaced
with UT’s Trinity Parking Garage, Penick-Allison Tennis Center, and Nursing School. The
bridge is no longer utilized for vehicular traffic and lacks integrity of design, workmanship,
materials, and setting. The 18th Street bridge and retaining walls are recommended as
ineligible for designation as an SAL.
6.1.3

Trinity Street Bridge

The Trinity Street bridge over Waller Creek is a pre-stressed, I-beam bridge (National
Bridge Inventory No. 142270B01470002) that spans Waller Creek along the western boundary
of the project area between 18th Street and East MLK Boulevard (Figures 6-21 to 6-23). The
bridge supports a 4-lane roadway with 2 sidewalks that is currently in use as part of the ROW of
Trinity Street.
According to TxDOT, the bridge was constructed in 1962 and represents the first bridge
built at this location (Mark Brown, personal communication to Kathryn St. Clair, June 6, 2013).
While Trinity Street was included in Edwin Waller’s original town plan of the City of Austin and
was (see Figure 5-1), Trinity Street actually ended at 17th Street and did not provide access
between 17th Street and MLK Boulevard (formerly 19th Street) until after 1952 (compare
Figures 5-10 and 5-11; also see earlier historic maps presented in Chapter 5.0). The first
historic map on which the ROW of Trinity Street can be seen to connect all the way through to
East MLK Boulevard is the historic aerial photograph dated 1964 (see Figure 5-11). Prior to
1964, Trinity Street ended at 17th Street, and the blocks between 17th and 18th streets and
between 18th Street and East MLK Boulevard (formerly 19th Street) were continuous residential
blocks that extended from Neches Street on the east to San Jacinto Street on the west.
According to TxDOT, the Trinity Street bridge is considered ineligible for designation as an SAL
(Mark Brown, personal communication to Kathryn St. Clair, June 6, 2013).

Miscellaneous Historic-Age Objects
Trinity Street Bridge Storm Water Outfall

As the Trinity Street bridge represents the original mid-20th-century bridge over Waller
Creek, no remnants of any earlier retaining walls are evident along the banks of Waller Creek
east of the bridge within the current project area. However, the remnants of a storm water
outfall constructed of dry-laid limestone bricks are evident on the southern bank of Waller Creek
approximately 10 m (33 ft) east of the Trinity Street bridge (Figures 6-24 and 6-25). This outfall
would have provided drainage from the residential neighborhood formerly located south of
Waller Creek, though none of the historic-age structures that once characterized this
neighborhood remain standing within the project area. Currently, UT’s Penick-Allison Tennis
Center and a sidewalk are the only features located south of the location of this outfall. No
corresponding storm water intakes were observed in the surrounding area during the survey,
and this outfall does not currently appear to be functional. The original construction date of this
outfall structure is unknown, but it may have been built during an earlier episode of flood
management modifications made to Waller Creek during the 1920s or 1950s. While the storm
water outfall is associated with flood management efforts in the City of Austin, the structure
lacks integrity of materials, design, workmanship, and association and is recommended as
ineligible for designation as an SAL.

Limestone Property Boundary Wall
The remnants of what appears to be a historic-age property boundary wall are located
on the western terrace of Waller Creek in the open park area that characterizes the
southwestern corner of the current project area (Figures 6-26 and 6-27). In its current
configuration, the wall is roughly L-shaped, with its longer northwest-to-southeast-oriented
segment measuring approximately 8.0 m (26.2 ft) in length and its shorter segment measuring
approximately 1.5 m (5.0 ft) in length. The wall is approximately 1.0 m (3.5 ft) in height and is
composed of roughly 5 to 6 courses of limestone bricks and field stones cemented with mortar.
A large live oak tree has grown through part of the longer wall segment near its intersection with
the shorter segment, and several large chunks of the wall are visible in the Waller Creek
channel to the east that were likely knocked over when the remainder of this block was cleared
in the 1970s or 1980s to make way for the current park. This wall remnant is aligned with the
original northeast-to-southwest-oriented street grid that characterized Block 59, and it is located
approximately mid-way between the former ROWs of 15th and 16th streets. As such, the wall
remnant appears to represent the back corner of one of the residential parcels that faced
northeastward toward 16th Street and likely fronted onto the alley that ran between the 2 rows
of residential parcels that fronted onto 15th and 16th streets, respectively.
This wall remnant represents the only aboveground structural remnant associated with
the early to mid-20th-century neighborhoods that once characterized the project area observed
during the survey. The earliest residential development within Block 59 is observable on
Augustis Koch’s 1887 “Bird’s Eye” map of Austin (see Figure 5-5), and structures are visible on
this parcel on both the 1900 and 1935 Sanborn Fire Insurance maps, though the nearest
primary residential structure appears to have been located on the adjacent parcel to the west as
late as 1935 (see Figures 5-8 and 5-9). While the date of construction is unknown, the wall was
likely build during the early to mid-20th century. As no other features of this historic-age parcel
are extant, the wall remnant lacks integrity of materials, design, workmanship, and association
and is recommended as ineligible for designation as an SAL.
Stacked Limestone Edging around Base of Heritage Oak
A large live oak Heritage Tree edged with a low wall composed of stacked limestone
brick fragments and limestone nodules, which may represent fossilized oyster shells collected
nearby from Waller Creek, is located in the northeastern corner of the park that currently
characterizes the southwestern corner of the current project area (Figures 6-28 and 6-29). The
tree with the limestone edging is located in the northeastern corner of Block 59 just south of the
southeastern corner of the southernmost of the 4 tennis courts that compose UT’s PenickAllison Tennis Center and was likely an element of a historic-age parcel that fronted onto the
south side of 16th Street. While the date of construction is unknown, the ornamental limestone
edging was likely built during the early to mid-20th century. As no other elements of this
historic-age parcel are extant, this feature lacks integrity of materials, design, workmanship, and
association and is recommended as ineligible for designation as an SAL.

Arthur P. Watson House

The Arthur P. Watson House is located just north of the current project area’s boundary
in a wooded area between UT’s Trinity Parking Garage, Collections Deposit Library, and
Nursing School (Figure 6-30). The house is located just west of Red River Street at 500 East
18th Street, though the former ROW of 18th Street was removed from within the project area
during UT’s construction efforts in the 1970s and 1980s. Constructed in 1853, the Watson
House is a 2-story house built in limestone with a mansard roof. The house was donated to UT
in 1993. Since then, it has been vacant. It is one of the oldest standing homes in Austin, and is
also the closest historic-age building to the project area boundary. The 18th Street pedestrian
bridge is located adjacent to the southwestern corner of the Watson House property. The back
yard of the Watson House exhibits extensive landscaping in dry-laid and mortared limestone
masonry, and a limestone wading pool and surrounding patio (Figure 6-31) and an outbuilding
and greenhouse (Figure 6-32) are also located on the property.
The Watson House represents a unique example of early, high-style influenced
architecture in Austin. However, as the parcel on which the Watson House and its associated
features are located falls outside the boundaries of the current project area, the property was
not systematically investigated or assessed during the current survey and is considered to be of
undetermined eligibility for designation as an SAL at the present time. UT has stated that the
Watson House property will be completely avoided during construction of the proposed Dell
Medical School, Phase 1.
6.1.6

Little Campus

One NRHP-listed and SAL-designated historic property, the Little Campus, is within and
adjacent to the current project area (Figures 6-33 and 6-34). The Little Campus is located in the
northeastern portion of the project area and is bounded by East MLK Boulevard on the north,
Red River Street on the west, the southbound IH 35 frontage road (formerly East Avenue) on
the east, and by the Erwin Center on the south. At the time of its NRHP nomination in 1974, the
Little Campus had 6 contributing buildings and was built between 1857 and 1912 by Abner H.
Cook, who also built the Pease Mansion, the Texas Governor’s Mansion, and the Neil-Cochran
House (though some additional buildings on the campus had been demolished prior to 1974).
The stucco, limestone, and brick main building has a metal roof and was built in an Italianate
style. The corresponding 5 buildings were constructed in brick in a similar style. The original
main building of the Little Campus was built as the Texas State Asylum for the Blind, a state
hospital for the blind that was the first of its kind in Texas. It operated from 1857 to 1865, when
its services were disrupted by the Civil War. Since that time, the main building has been used
as a military residence, again as an asylum for the blind from 1866 to 1915, a World War I air
training institute, a university building, a state hospital, and a World War II military facility before
being acquired for permanent use by UT. The main building currently serves as UT’s Freshman
Admissions Center, and the 5 ancillary buildings house a variety of other university-related
functions. Between the NRHP nomination in 1974 and the SAL designation of the campus in
1981, several buildings on the Little Campus had been razed. The SAL designation covers only
the extant buildings—the Arno Nowotny Building (formerly Building C) and John W. Hargis Hall
(formerly Buildings H and K).

None of the buildings on the Little Campus would be modified during the construction
and use of the temporary parking lot. A temporary Erwin Center parking lot would be utilized
within the Little Campus courtyard during construction of the overall project, and the courtyard
would be restored after the functions of the Erwin Center have been relocated elsewhere.
No investigations were conducted by Horizon in the vicinity of the Little Campus as the
proposed temporary parking lot facility was added to the proposed overall design after Horizon’s
field investigations were completed. UT has retained the services of ARCHITEXAS, a
preservation architecture firm, to oversee the construction of the temporary parking lot and
future restoration of the Little Campus courtyard in consultation with the THC; as such, this
portion of the project area was not included within the scope of Horizon’s current investigations.

ARCHEOLOGICAL RESOURCES

6.2.1

Site 41TV2440
General Description

Site 41TV2440 is an extensive multiple-component historic-age and aboriginal
archeological site that covers a large portion of the project area (Figures 6-35 and 6-36). The
historic-age component consists of an extensive, low- to moderate density scatter and
subsurface scatter of early to mid-20th-century domestic debris, construction debris, and a few

remnants of cultural features. The historic-age component is associated with the residential
neighborhoods that characterized the project area prior to the 1970s, when UT began to replace
the residential neighborhoods with university facilities. The aboriginal component consists only
of a very sparse scatter of aboriginal lithic debris, including a few chert flakes and pieces of
angular debris manufactured from local Edwards chert, mixed together with the historic-age
cultural resources in shallow, disturbed sediments overlying limestone bedrock. The site
boundaries incorporate the majority of the project area located west of Red River Street,
excluding those areas in which urban development has completely obscured the modern ground
surface by built facilities, including UT’s Penick-Allison Tennis Center, the current Red River
Street ROW, a display of Charles Umlauf sculptures, a network of sidewalks, and modern
landscaping.
Vegetation across the majority of the project area consists of planted
bermudagrass dotted with pecan and live oak trees, some of which have been designated as
Heritage Trees (i.e., those with a diameter of more than 24 inches). The banks of Waller Creek
support a more native community of mixed live oak, pecan, and hackberry trees with a sparse
understory of mixed grasses, vines, and forbs. West of Waller Creek, the bermudagrass cover
is somewhat patchy and the modern ground surface is exposed in many areas, resulting in
visibility between 50% and 100% in areas not covered by built facilities. East of Waller Creek,
the grass is apparently watered more regularly and the growth is correspondingly denser,
reducing ground surface visibility to below 25% in most areas. Elevations across the site
parallel those that characterize the overall project area, ranging from 146 to 158 m (480 to
520 ft) amsl.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Cultural materials are visible on the modern ground surface more or less continuously
throughout the portion of the project area west of Waller Creek where the modern ground
surface is visible, whereas visibility of the modern ground surface has been obscured on the
east side of Waller Creek by more extensive landscaping and a denser cover of bermudagrass.
As documented during the current survey, the site measures approximately 325 m (1,066 ft)
northeast to southwest by 135 m 443 ft) northwest to southeast. The site is bounded on the
south by East 15th Street, on the east more or less by Red River Street, and on the west by
UT’s Penick-Allison Tennis Center. Where Waller Creek turns to the west between the northern
end of UT’s Penick-Allison Tennis Center and Trinity Parking Garage, cultural materials were
observed on the modern ground surface and in shovel tests only on the south back of the creek.
It is undetermined whether or not the site extends into portion of the project area located east of
Red River Street. The portion of the project area located on the Little Campus were not
investigated during Horizon’s field surveys as this portion of the project area was added to the
overall project design following completion of Horizon’s field investigations. The portion of the
project area that extends east of Red River Street along the north side of East 15th Street is
covered partially by the southern overflow parking lot of the Erwin Center and a steep grassy
slope that contained a dense network of subsurface irrigation lines; as such, no subsurface
investigations could be conducted here.
Horizon excavated a total of 8 trackhoe trenches and 20 shovel tests within the
proposed project’s 9.1-ha (22.5-ac).
Due to the presence of tennis courts, parking lots,

Chapter 6.0: Results of Investigations

sidewalks, numerous subsurface utility lines, Heritage Trees, a sculpture garden, and other
urban facilities, subsurface investigations were restricted to limited portions of the overall project
area. Trenching efforts were constrained to 2 clusters of trenches, including (1) 5 trenches
(Trenches 1 to 5) in an open city park area in the southwestern portion of the project area
bounded by East 15th Street on the south, Waller Creek on the east, UT tennis courts on the
north, and Trinity Street on the west, and (2) 3 trenches (Trenches 6 to 8) in a contoured terrace
area on the east side of Waller Creek bounded by Waller Creek to the west and a sculpture
garden containing 3 Charles Umlauf sculptures, sidewalks, and associated landscaping to the
east (see Figures 5-16 and 5-17). The northern half of the project area was inaccessible for
trenching efforts due to the narrowness of the extant landforms present between constructed
facilities and the steep banks of Waller Creek and the large number of subsurface utilities
traversing the area; consequently, 20 shovel tests were excavated to complement the trenching
efforts.
West of Waller Creek, decomposing limestone bedrock occurs at relatively shallow
depths ranging from 15 to 75 cmbs, with most commonly at a depth of approximately 30 cmbs,
and overlying sediments generally consist of disturbed gravelly clay loam composed
predominantly of historic fill that contains a low to moderate density of historic-age and
aboriginal cultural materials. The artifact density is actually rather low considering the large
number of historic-age structures that have been demolished within the project area (see
discussion of historic map research in Chapter 5.0), which suggests that most of the materials
resulting from the demolished houses were removed from the site. Archeological deposits east
of Waller Creek are much more sparse overall, and bedrock was encountered at depths of
30 and 60 cmbs in 2 of the 3 trenches excavated in this area (Trenches 6 and 7), though
1 trench in this area uncovered a dense deposit of construction debris and domestic artifacts
extending to bedrock at a depth of 150 cm below surface that appears to reflect the collected
contents of 1 or more demolished households that were used as artificial fill materials to build up
the eastern terrace of Waller Creek (Trench 8). Sediments observed in shovel tests and
trackhoe trenches were extensively disturbed via decades of construction-related clearing,
demolition, and landscaping activities. Bedrock was reached in all shovel tests and trackhoe
trenches excavated within the project area, and no intact sediments were encountered, not even
immediately adjacent to the banks of Waller Creek. Figures 6-37 to 6-48 provide photographic
overviews of each of the trackhoe trenches excavated during the survey. Appendix A presents
specific shovel testing data, Appendix B provides data on each of the trackhoe trenches
excavated during the survey, and Appendix C presents a tabulation of a sample of cultural
materials observed in trackhoe trenches.
Observed Cultural Materials
Historic-age cultural materials on site 41TV2440 consists of a low- to moderate-density
surface and subsurface scatter of construction materials and domestic debris associated with
shallow, disturbed sediments overlying limestone bedrock. Construction materials, including
chunks and slabs of concrete; ceramic and limestone bricks and brick fragments; chunks of
mortar and asphalt; sherds of ceramic sewer pipes; clear window pane glass shards; ceramic
roofing and marble decorative tile fragments; metal nails, tacks, bolts, screws, and door hinges;

copper tubing; sprinkler heads, rebar fragments; fragments of wood trim or stakes; and
unidentified fragments of metal, are by far the most common type of historic-age artifact on the
site. The banks of Waller Creek are lined with large chunks of concrete, apparently the
remnants of structure foundations, and other construction debris along the entire length of the
creek within the project (Figures 6-49 and 6-50). Furthermore, construction debris was by far
the most common type of material encountered in subsurface contexts in trackhoe trenches,
and construction debris was observed in all of the trackhoe trenches (Figures 6-51 to 6-58).
The observed construction materials represent the remains of the dozens of historic-age
residences that comprised the residential neighborhoods that characterized the project area
until UT began to clear out the residential structures to make way for university facilities
throughout the 1970s and 1980s.
Historic-age domestic debris observed on the site consists of clear, brown, green, and a
few solarized bottle and drinking glass shards; a variety of decorated and undecorated
whiteware, stoneware, and earthenware sherds; a porcelain doll fragment; a plastic comb; metal
food can fragments, bottle caps; a metal gardening hoe blade; and several pieces of butcher-cut
faunal bone (Figures 6-59 to 6-67).
Modern trash, including aluminum cans, bottle caps, plastic electrical conductors,
sprinkler heads, porcelain and plastic insulator fragments, are also abundant within the shallow
historic fill deposits. The site boundaries are more or less co-extensive with Centennial Park, a
UT-owned and maintained park that is open to public access and which is also used seasonally
for tailgating parties during UT sporting events. While UT facilities maintenance personnel
regularly clean the park, some smaller items of modern trash have become incorporated into the
mixed historic-age fill deposits that characterize the shallow sediments within the project area.
The vast majority of temporally diagnostic historic-age cultural materials are indicative of
the early to mid-20th-century residential neighborhoods that characterized the project area prior
to the 1970s, when UT began to clear the project area to make way for the current university
facilities that are now sited here. A very small number of artifacts, including a few square nails
and shards of solarized bottle glass, are indicative of late 19th- to early 20th-century dates of
manufacture; however, as the vast majority of the observed cultural materials are clearly of early
to mid-20th-century origin, it is probable that the scant artifacts with earlier manufacture dates
were simply still in use during the 20th-century occupation.
Overall, the density of historic-age construction materials and domestic debris is actually
rather low considering the large number of historic-age structures that have been demolished in
this area, which suggests that most of the materials resulting from the demolished houses were
removed from the site.
The aboriginal component of site 41TV2440 consists only of a very low-density scatter of
lithic flakes and chunks of angular debris manufactured from locally available Edwards
Formation chert (Figure 6-68). One small piece of possibly burned limestone may represent a
burned rock associated with the aboriginal use of this locality; however, considering the vast
quantities of decomposing limestone bedrock the crop out across the site, it is possible that this
item is not of cultural origin. No temporally diagnostic artifacts, preserved organic remains, or

formal tools associated with the aboriginal component were observed. While the small
quantities of lithic debris are generally indicative of an aboriginal presence within the project
area, the aboriginal occupation can only be dated to a generically prehistoric timeframe.
Cultural Features
Several structural remnants associated with the early to mid-20th-century residential
neighborhoods that once characterized the project area are extant within the project area.
The remains of several concrete foundation slabs are visible on the modern ground
surface in the open park area located in the southwestern portion of the project area.
Designated as Block 59, this area historically was bounded by East 15th and 16th streets on the
south and west, respectively, and by Trinity and Neches streets on the west and east,
respectively. The ROWs of 16th and Neches streets have been removed from the project area,
so this park area is currently bounded by East 15th Street on the south, Trinity Street on the
west, Waller Creek on the east, and the southernmost of the 4 tennis courts that comprise UT’s
Penick-Allison Tennis Center on the north. Several sidewalks are located along the edges and
traversing this area, and several large Heritage Trees dot an otherwise open, grassy park
setting. The concrete slab fragments are set flush with the modern ground surface or are
shallowly buried under a few centimeters of topsoil (Figures 6-69 and 6-70). A segment of
1 such concrete foundation remnant was exposed in Trench 3 and revealed to consist of a
northeast-to-southwest-oriented concrete wall measuring approximately 15 cm (6 in) in width by
25 cm (10 in) in height and anchored on the underlying stratum of limestone bedrock (Figure 671). Remnants of several abandoned subsurface metal pipelines were also observed in the
park in the southwestern portion of the project area that appear to have been left in place when
the lot was cleared of residential structures (Figures 6-72 and 6-73).
A curvilinear alignment of limestone bricks was observed set flush with the top of
limestone bedrock in Trench 4, a long east-to-west oriented trench excavated in the park just
south of the southernmost tennis court and an adjacent sidewalk (Figure 6-74). This feature
may represent the remains of a small wall or other residential landscaping feature, though a
void was detected along the western side of the brick alignment that may suggest this is the
remnant of a collapsed well.
While the densities of historic-age construction materials and domestic debris were of
low to moderate density across the majority of the project area, a dense deposit of historic-age
fill was observed in Trench 8, excavated east of Waller Creek, extending to a depth of 150 cmbs
overlying limestone bedrock (Figure 6-75). This fill deposit was composed of a dense matrix of
construction materials and domestic debris that contained relatively little soil and appears to
represent the remains of 1 or more historic-age structures that were subsequently used to build
up the elevation of the Waller Creek terrace.
No cultural features associated with the aboriginal component on site 41TV2440 were
observed on the modern ground surface or in any of the shovel tests or trackhoe trenches
excavated during the survey.

Summary
As delineated based on current investigations, site 41TV2440 is a multiple-component
aboriginal and early to mid-20th century historic-age site. The aboriginal component consists
only of a very sparse subsurface scatter of lithic flakes and angular debris mixed together with
20th-century historic-age cultural materials in shallow, disturbed sediments overlying limestone
bedrock. No temporally diagnostic artifacts, preserved organic remains, or cultural features
associated with the aboriginal component were observed, and the aboriginal cultural materials
on the site are attributable only to an undetermined prehistoric timeframe. Based on the
sparseness of aboriginal cultural materials and the lack of integrity of the archeological deposits,
the aboriginal component on site 41TV2440 possesses no research value and is recommended
as ineligible for designation as an SAL.
The primary cultural component of site 41TV2440 consists of an extensive surface and
subsurface scatter of early to mid-20th-century domestic debris, construction materials, and
cultural features associated with the multiple historic-age residences known to have once
existed within the project area based on historic map research. Within the portion of the project
area west of Waller Creek, archeological deposits are confined to shallow, disturbed sediments
overlying limestone bedrock and typically measure approximately 30 cm in depth, though some
variations were observed. Archeological deposits east of Waller Creek are of comparable depth
for the most part, though 1 trackhoe trench uncovered a thick deposit of historic-age fill

110

composed of construction debris and household artifacts extending to a depth of 150 cmbs that
likely represents the remains of 1 or more demolished households that were used as artificial fill
material to build up the elevation of the eastern terrace of Waller Creek. Site 41TV2440 is not
associated with events that have made a significant contribution to broad patterns of history and
is not associated with a particular cultural or ethnic group, and no historic-age structures are
currently standing within the project area that would represent the work of a significant architect,
builder, or architectural style. While it was not feasible within the scope of the current study to
obtain chains of title for each of the dozens of individual residential house lots that composed
this city block throughout the 19th and 20th centuries prior to UT’s acquisition of the property in
the 1970s, no persons of particular historical significance are known to be associated with the
site based on the limited historical research that has been conducted. Due to the overall low
density of cultural materials, the late date of occupation reflected by the archeological deposits,
and somewhat typical nature of the cultural features and artifacts found on site 41TV2440, the
historic-age component is recommended as ineligible for designation as an SAL.

7.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

7.1

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The archeological investigations documented in this report were undertaken with
3 primary management goals in mind:



Locate all historic and prehistoric cultural resources that occur within the designated
survey area.



Evaluate the significance of these resources regarding their potential for designation
as SALs.



Formulate recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their SAL
evaluations.

At the survey level of investigation, the principal research objective is to inventory the
cultural resources within the APE and to make preliminary determinations of whether or not the
resources meet one or more of the pre-defined eligibility criteria set forth in the state and/or
federal codes, as appropriate. Usually, management decisions regarding archeological
properties are a function of the potential importance of the sites in addressing defined research
needs, though historic-age sites may also be evaluated in terms of their association with
important historic events and/or personages. Under the Antiquities Code of Texas, cultural
resources are evaluated according to criteria established to determine the significance of
archeological resources for designation as SALs.
Regarding archeological resources, analyses of the limited data obtained at the survey
level are rarely sufficient to contribute in a meaningful manner to defined research issues. The
objective is rather to determine which archeological sites could be most profitably investigated
further in pursuance of regional, methodological, or theoretical research questions. Therefore,
adequate information on site function, context, and chronological placement from archeological
and, if appropriate, historical perspectives is essential for archeological evaluations. Because
research questions vary as a function of geography and temporal period, determination of the
site context and chronological placement of cultural properties is a particularly important
objective during the inventory process.

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR LISTING AS A STATE ANTIQUITIES LANDMARK

The criteria for determining the eligibility of a prehistoric or historic cultural property for
designation as an SAL are presented in Chapter 191, Subchapter D, Section 191.092 of the
Antiquities Code of Texas, which states that SALs include:
Sites, objects, buildings, artifacts, implements, and locations of historical, archeological,
scientific, or educational interest including those pertaining to prehistoric and historical
American Indians or aboriginal campsites, dwellings, and habitation sites, their artifacts
and implements of culture, as well as archeological sites of every character that are
located in, on, or under the surface of any land belonging to the State of Texas or to any
county, city, or political subdivision of the state are state archeological landmarks and are
eligible for designation.

For the purposes of assessing the eligibility of a historic property for designation as an
SAL, a historic site, structure, or building has historical interest if the site, structure, or building:
1. [W]as the site of an event that has significance in the history of the United States or
the State of Texas;
2. [W]as significantly associated with the life of a famous person;
3. [W]as significantly associated with an event that symbolizes an important principle or
ideal;
4. [R]epresents a distinctive architectural type and has value as an example of a period,
style, or construction technique; or,
5. [I]s important as part of the heritage of a religious organization, ethic group, or local
society.

The Antiquities Code of Texas establishes the THC as the legal custodian of all cultural
resources, historic and prehistoric, within the public domain of the State of Texas. Under Part II
of Title 13 of the Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26), the THC may designate a historic
structure as an SAL if it (1) is publicly or privately owned and listed on the NRHP and (2) meets
one of the following 6 eligibility criteria:
A. Is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad
patterns of our history;
B. Is associated with the lives of persons significant in our past;
C. Is important to a particular cultural or ethnic group;
D. Is the work of a significant architect, master builder, or craftsman;
E. Embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction,
possesses high aesthetic value, or represents a significant and distinguishable entity
whose components may lack individual distinctions; or
F. Has yielded or may be likely to yield information important to the understanding of
Texas culture or history.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

During the historic structures inventory survey, 5 bridges (the 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, and
Trinity street bridges), 3 of which are of historic age (the 16th, 18th, and Trinity street bridges);
1 historic-age house (the Arthur P. Watson House); and 1 NRHP-listed and SAL-designated
historic property (the Little Campus) were identified within and adjacent to the boundaries of the
project area (Table 7-1). Of the 5 bridges within the project area, only 3 are of historic-age—the
16th Street bridge, originally constructed circa 1920; the 18th Street bridge, originally
constructed circa 1925; and the Trinity Street bridge, constructed in 1962. While the 16th and
18th street bridges retain some elements of their original construction, including remnants of
nearby retaining walls, both bridges have been significantly altered and lack integrity of
materials, design, workmanship, and setting, and both bridges are recommended as ineligible
for designation as SALs. According to TxDOT, the Trinity Street bridge is ineligible for
designation as an SAL.
The Arthur P. Watson house is located just outside the northeastern boundary of the
project area. Built in 1852, the Watson House is one of the oldest standing homes in Austin and
also the closest historic-age building to the project area boundary. The Watson House was not
systematically evaluated during the current study as it is located outside the boundaries of the
project area, and UT has stated that the house will be completely avoided during construction of
the proposed Dell Medical School, Phase 1. As such, it is considered to be of undetermined
eligibility for designation as an SAL. UT has stated that the Watson House property will be
completely avoided during construction of the proposed Dell Medical School, Phase 1.
One NRHP-listed and SAL-designated historic property, the Little Campus, is located
within and adjacent to the current project area. The Little Campus is located in the northeastern
portion of the project area and is bounded by East MLK Boulevard on the north, Red River

Chapter 7.0: Summary and Recommendations

Street on the west, East Avenue (the southbound IH 35 frontage road) on the east, and the
Erwin Center on the south. Currently, the Little Campus is owned and operated by UT. In
connection with the proposed construction of the Dell Medical School, Phase I, UT proposes to
utilize the interior courtyard of the Little Campus as a parking lot to accommodate overflow
parking from the Erwin Center after the current overflow parking lot, which is located south of
the Erwin Center off the north side of 15th Street within the current project area, is removed.
None of the contributing buildings of the NRHP-listed Little Campus would be modified during
the construction and use of the temporary parking lot. The temporary parking lot will be
removed and the Little Campus courtyard will be restored to its current park setting in the future
after the functions of the Erwin Center have been relocated elsewhere. No investigations were
conducted by Horizon in the vicinity of the Little Campus as the proposed temporary parking lot
facility was added to the proposed project design after Horizon’s field investigations were
completed. UT has retained the services of ARCHITEXAS, a preservation architecture firm, to
oversee the construction of the temporary parking lot and future restoration of the Little Campus
courtyard in consultation with the THC; as such, this portion of the project area was not included
within the scope of Horizon’s current investigations.
One new archeological site, 41TV2440, was recorded within the project area during the
archeological survey. As delineated based on current investigations, site 41TV2440 is a
multiple-component aboriginal and early to mid-20th century historic-age site. The aboriginal
component consists only of a very sparse subsurface scatter of lithic flakes and angular debris
mixed together with the 20th-century historic-age cultural materials in shallow, disturbed
sediments overlying limestone bedrock. No temporally diagnostic artifacts, preserved organic
remains, or cultural features associated with the aboriginal component were observed, and the
aboriginal cultural materials on the site are attributable only to an undetermined prehistoric
timeframe. Based on the sparseness of aboriginal cultural materials and the lack of integrity of
the archeological deposits, the aboriginal component on site 41TV2440 possesses no research
value and is recommended as ineligible for designation as an SAL.
The primary cultural component of site 41TV2440 consists of an extensive surface and
subsurface scatter of early to mid-20th-century domestic debris, construction materials, and
cultural features associated with the multiple historic-age residences known to have once
existed within the project area based on historic map research. Within the portion of the project
area west of Waller Creek, archeological deposits are confined to shallow, disturbed sediments
overlying limestone bedrock and measure no more than 30 cm in depth. Archeological deposits
east of Waller Creek are of comparable depth for the most part, though 1 trackhoe trench
uncovered a thick fill of construction debris and household artifacts extending to a depth of
150 cm that likely represents the remains of 1 or more demolished households that were used
as artificial fill material to build up the elevation of the eastern terrace of Waller Creek. Site
41TV2440 is not associated with events that have made a significant contribution to broad
patterns of history and is not associated with a particular cultural or ethnic group, and no
historic-age structures are currently standing within the project area that would represent the
work of a significant architect, builder, or architectural style. While it was not feasible within the
scope of the current study to obtain chains of title for each of the dozens of individual residential
house lots that comprised this city block throughout the 19th and 20th centuries prior to UT’s

116

acquisition of the property in the 1970s, no persons of particular historical significance are
known to be associated with the site based on the limited historical research that has been
conducted. Due to the overall low density of cultural materials, the late date of occupation
reflected by the archeological deposits, and somewhat typical nature of the cultural features and
artifacts found on site 41TV2440, the historic-age component is recommended as ineligible for
designation as an SAL.
No cultural resources were identified within the APE that meet the criteria for designation
as SALs according to 13 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) 26. While it was possible to conduct
subsurface archeological investigations in only limited, accessible portions of the overall project
area, it is Horizon’s opinion that archeological deposits are substantively similar across the
entire project area. Given the relatively shallow depth of bedrock (30 cm) across the vast
majority of the investigated portions of the project area, it is Horizon’s opinion that areas that
have been more extensively disturbed via construction of the Erwin Center parking lot, the
current Red River Street ROW, and the UT Penick-Allison Tennis Center have effectively no
potential for intact subsurface archeological deposits underneath the constructed facilities.
There are small areas east of Waller Creek in which deeper layers of historic-age construction
debris and artificial fill materials have been deposited, likely to build up the elevation of the
eastern terrace of the creek; however, gauging from the disturbed character of archeological
deposits examined and the extent of modern landscaping east of Waller Creek, it is Horizon’s
opinion that any uninvestigated archeological deposits in this area would not meet the criteria of
eligibility for designation as SALs. Additional archeological survey investigations would not be
feasible prior to the initiation of construction activities as Horizon was able to access all portions
of the APE permitted by current access restrictions. While it is possible that a program of
limited archeological monitoring during construction may result in the documentation of
additional archeological deposits and features associated with the early to mid-20th-century
residential development and occupation within the project area, the disturbed character of
archeological deposits investigated during the survey leads Horizon to believe that any as-yet
undocumented archeological deposits would be similarly disturbed. As such, it is Horizon’s
opinion that no further archeological work is warranted in connection with the proposed
undertaking.
Horizon’s historical research indicates that the original 14 city blocks encompassed
within the current project area consisted entirely of residential and limited commercial
development and that no cemeteries were ever located here. However, it should be noted that
human burials are protected under the Texas Health and Safety Code. In the unlikely event that
any human remains or burial objects are inadvertently discovered at any point during
construction, use, or ongoing maintenance in the project area, even in previously surveyed
areas, all work should cease in the discovery of the find until a qualified archeologist can assess
the inadvertent discovery and the THC should be notified immediately.
