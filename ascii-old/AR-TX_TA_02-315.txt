Abstract
AARCHER, Inc., of Annapolis, Maryland contracted with Tierras Antiguas Archaeological
Investigations to conduct a cultural resources survey of the footprint of a proposed cellular tower
in southeastern San Angelo, Tom Green County, Texas. The Federal Communications
Commission’s Nationwide Programmatic Agreement (PA; 47 CFR Part 1) requires that a cultural
resources survey be conducted prior to such an undertaking. No Antiquities Permit was required,
but subsequent review of this archaeological report was provided by the Texas Historical
Commission’s Archeology Division. The total area to be impacted is 5,625 square feet (0.13
acres).
Tierras Antiguas conducted the survey on June 22, 2014. A thorough pedestrian survey of the
surface area was conducted before six shovel tests were excavated. No cultural material was
observed either on the surface, or in any of the six shovel tests.
As such, Tierras Antiguas Archaeology recommended that AARCHER, Inc. be allowed to
oversee development of the tract as planned. However, Tierras Antiguas further recommended
that if any previously undiscovered cultural resources were encountered during development,
work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds could be examined and
evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the Texas
Historical Commission.
No artifacts were collected or curated during this project.

Acknowledgments
The individuals who are greatly appreciated, and whose efforts contributed to the successful
planning, organization, and completion of this project are Ms. Jayne Aaron, Architectural
Historian and Senior Environmental Planner at AARCHER, Inc., and Mr. Bill Martin, Federal
Programs Reviewer at the Texas Historical Commission’s Office of Historic Preservation.

funding was involved in the proposed development of the property, the Federal Communications
Commission’s Nationwide Programmatic Agreement (PA; 47 CFR Part 1) requires that a cultural
resources survey be conducted prior to such an undertaking.
In June 2014, TAAI conducted a review of cultural resources documented either on, or within
one mile of the PA, as well as other documents that may be relative for significant cultural
resources to exist within the PA. The research by TAAI included:
1) A review of the most current literature documenting the prehistory and history of the
immediate area
2) A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas to identify
what cultural resource surveys have been conducted, and what archaeological sites have been
documented within one mile of the project area

undisturbed.

Project Environment
The Project Area lies within the central portion of Tom Green County, at the southern edge of
the Rolling Plains (Osage Plains), an undulating plain with sometimes steeply eroded canyons
(Fenneman 1931:54). Bordering the project area on the south is the Edwards Plateau in Central
Texas’ “Hill Country”, so named for its rugged, stream-eroded topography. The Rolling Plains,
with its silty clay loams and stony clays in the valleys overlying Permian-age silt and sandstone
beds, covers about 80 percent of Tom Green County, gradually changing into fine sandy loams
on the eroded slopes of the Edwards Plateau. Geologically, the area provides abundant outcrops
of limestone and gravels from the Edwards limestone and San Angelo conglomerate formations.
Physiographically, the region falls in the Northwest Margin of the Edwards Plateau Section of the
Great Plains province (Fenneman 1931). Elevation in Tom Green county ranges from 1,717 feet
in the north to 2,480 feet in the south.
Modern and Historic Climate
The modern climate of the San Angelo area is classified as semi-arid, though humidity, often in
excess of 40%, is high for such a characterization. Large fluctuations in temperature occur
throughout the year, with average daily maximum temperatures ranging from 97.5 degrees during
August to around 59 degrees in January, and average daily minimums ranging from a July high
of 72.7 degrees down to 34.3 degrees in January (Weidenfeld and Flores 1976:56-57). The
average precipitation over the last 30 years is 20.45 inches (National Weather Service 2014)
though significant fluctuations are common. Over 64% of the yearly precipitation occurs in the
period between May and October, with the driest period being the late fall, winter, and early
spring months of November through February.
Although the growing season averages around 232 days a year (Weidenfeld and Flores 1976:55;
Henderson 1996:522-524), the number of days per year between freezing temperatures has
fluctuated significantly. The combination of variable rainfall and temperature patterns results in
frequent droughts as well as periods of abundant moisture.
Hydrology
A variety of major drainages and springs are present in close proximity to the Project Area.
Three major drainages that make up the Concho River watershed converge within Tom Green
county; the North Concho, Middle Concho, and South Concho join near San Angelo to form the
Concho, which ultimately empties into the Colorado River to the northeast. A few of the major
tributaries flowing into the rivers include Spring, Dove, Burks, Pecan, and Kickapoo creeks
(Handbook of Texas Online 2014).
The surface water provided by rivers and creeks are supplemented in the area by springs. Among
the many springs that have attracted people to the region for millennia are Good Springs (also
3

known as Seven, Headwater, or Spring Creek Springs ), located near the Mertzon community in
Irion County, the Dove Creek Springs southeast of Mertzon, Government, or Main Springs, in
nearby Schleicher County, Mill Spring south of Christoval, Lipan Spring southeast of Wall, and
Kickapoo Spring south of Vancourt (Brune 1975:46-47,68,71-72). While long term data on
spring discharge rates are not available, Brune (1975) notes several examples of historically
documented springs in Irion, Schleicher, and Tom Green county which no longer flow, probably
as a result of a lowered water table.
Soils
As shown in Figure 4, the G. Washington Tower is to be constructed in Angelo clay loam (AnA),
commonly found on the lower, gently sloping lowlands in this area of Tom Green County. Angelo
soils are primarily a clay loam with a calcareous substratum subject to high degrees of shrinking
and swelling, causing vertical cracking in severe droughts. Typically, the texture is a clay loam
in the upper 6 inches, grading to a reddish-brown clay to 22 inches, followed by 30 inches of pink
silty clay loam, smoothly transitioning to a reddish-yellow clay loam (Weidenfeld and Flores 1976;
WebSoil Survey Online 2014).

Cultural Chronology
The location of the G. Washington Celluar Tower survey area presumes cultural affinities both
indigenous to the western edge of the central Texas region as well as intrusive influences from
south Texas and the Southern Great Plains (Figure 5). Several scholars have offered sound but
differing arguments for cultural chronologies for central and south Texas, and the Southern Great
Plains extending into northern Texas, just north of the Project Area. Using the earlier works of
Suhm (1960), Johnson et al. (1962) and Sorrow et al. (1967) as a springboard, Weir (1976) and
Prewitt (1981, 1985) sorted through the archaeological data from central Texas and established
a chronology defined by
phases. Although some
of their data has been
criticized as unreliable
an d t h e i r phases
critiqued as actual
patterns, chronological
markers, and intervals
(e.g. Collins 1995;
Johnson 1987), they
energized fellow
colleagues to investigate
empirical methods for
inferring cultural
behavior. Black (1989a,
b) synthesized the data
of high validity available
at the time and offered a
synthesis of prehistoric
intervals which were
widely accepted. Collins
(1995) reviewed the
archaeological and
palynological evidence
for central Texas and

human occupation from the Paleoindian through Historic periods.
Refining a cultural chronology for south Texas is much more problematic, due to the compressed
nature of the archaeological record and limited excavations conducted in the region (Hester
1995:433). Hall et al. (1982:463; 1986:393-406) analyzed radiocarbon dates and artifact
assemblages from Choke Canyon sites in western Live Oak and eastern McMullen counties to
establish a local chronology. Black (1989c:39-62) synthesized available data from south Texas
5

and offered a chronology similar to that of Hall and others (1982). Both chronologies were
considered by Turner et al. (2011), who offer slightly different chronological periods based on
evidence found more recently in south Texas. Supported by data retrieved from Loma Sandia in
Live Oak County, Black (1995:31-44) updated his south Texas chronology, again confirming that
of Hall et al. (1982). Also considering Hall’s scheme, Hester (1995:433) acknowledges the
paucity of information that exists for south Texas and as such offers only a general framework
for prehistoric periods particular to the region. The cultural chronology, defined by complex (in
lieu of the terms phase, interval, or period) of the North American High Plains has been
synthesized by Hofman et al. (1989), and more recently, the Southern High Plains in Texas by
Johnson and Holliday (1995) and Boyd (1995). It should be noted that the Southern Great Plains
complexes are defined by shifts in climatic conditions and subsistence more so than changes in
point style, which are indicators of change in central and south Texas. The following discussions
are primarily derived from Black (1995), Collins (1995), Hester (1995), Johnson and Holliday
(1986, 1995), Boyd (1995), and Hofman et al. (1989), and adapted from Nickels' (2000) synthesis
of the literature. A brief discussion of the Transitional Archaic as defined by Turner et al. (2011)
and Hester (1995) is also presented. All dates are approximate and given as years before present
(B.P.).
Pre-Clovis
Although humans may have inhabited the landscape before 11500 B.P, solid evidence does not
support their existence. The argument that artifacts recovered from Levi Rockshelter in Travis
County are older than Paleoindian (Alexander 1983:133-145) is not supported by clustered
radiocarbon dates or distinct artifact and extinct fauna assemblages within well-defined
stratigraphy (Collins 1995:380-381). Although human behavior is inferred on stone artifacts from
Friesenhahn Cave (Krieger 1964) and mammoth bones at the Waco Site (Fox et al. 1992:51-73),
all are problematic for the same reasons given for Levi Rockshelter. Although several skulls of
"pre-sapien ancestry with low sloping foreheads, a pronounced supra-orbital torus, and a marked
postorbital construction" were found in Hitzfelder Cave in northeast Bexar County, no
radiocarbon dates are available to substantiate their surmised antiquity. The Middle Archaic points
found with the burials suggest the skeletons are more likely 5,000 to 6,000 years old (Givens
1968a:219). At Lewisville Lake on the Southern High Plains of north-central Texas, radiocarbon
dates initially believed to be from burned charcoal in human campfires, and approximating an
antiquity of 40,000 years were later disproved as dates on natural coal (Stanford 1982:208-209).
As Collins (1995:380-381) offers, eroded landforms are not likely to yield solid stratigraphic
proof of human occupation earlier than late Pleistocene, and if we do find earlier occupations on
stable landforms, what comprises the signature of a Pre-Clovis culture? The Gault Site in Bell
County, Texas has provided by far the largest Clovis assemblage in all of North America, and
with artifacts stratigraphically beneath the known Clovis component, likely has the best chances
of providing conclusive evidence for a pre-Clovis culture in Texas (Adavasio and Page 2002:292294; Collins and Brown 2000; Gault Site 2014).
Paleoindian
The Paleoindian period began toward the close of the Pleistocene. This phase spans the period
estimated at between ca. 11500-8800 B.P. in central Texas (Collins 1995:381-383) and between
6

11200-7950 B.P. in south Texas (Hester 1995:433-436), although a few claims to older sites exist
(Alexander 1963, 1983; Fox et al. 1992; Givens 1968a, 1968b; Krieger 1964). The Southern
Great Plains were occupied by Clovis (Llano), Folsom and other complex peoples between
approximately 11500-8000 B.P. (Hofman 1989:29-45). During the Paleoindian interval, Hurt
(1980) suggests an association with the Southern Plains and Trans-Pecos regions. Diagnostic
artifacts include Clovis and Folsom projectile points. Certainly the wide distribution of
Clovis-type points across most of North America and even into Central America suggests a wide
dispersal of the people who made them (Kelly 1993; Wenke 1990:201). Within Texas' political
boundaries, Meltzer and Bever (2007) have documented the presence of over 500 Clovis points.
Other artifacts associated with the Clovis culture include bifaces and prismatic blades, engraved
stones, bone and ivory points, stone bolas, ochre, and shaft straighteners.
In general the Paleoindian adaptation has been considered to be one of small bands of nomadic,
big-game hunters following herds of Late Pleistocene fauna, including mammoth, mastodons,
bison, camel, and horse, across North America (Black 1989a). More recently, emphasis has been
placed on the wide diversity of plants and animals used for subsistence by these early Americans
(Black 1989a; Hester 1983), such as turtles and tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers, and raccoons
(Collins 1995:381), although they undoubtedly hunted the large animals as well (Dibble and
Lorraine 1968). Known Clovis sites include killsites, quarries, caches, open campsites, ritual sites,
and burials (Collins 1995: 381-383; Hester 1995:433-436). A Folsom interval follows the Clovis,
except perhaps in the Southern Great Plains where a transitional complex of artifacts with dart
points called "Goshen" may be present (Hofman 1989:34; Irwin et al. 1973). Folsom artifacts are
fairly common in central and south Texas; however, no campsites or killsites have been found
south of Pavo Real in Bexar County (Hester 1995:434-435).
Most Paleoindian finds in central and south Texas have consisted of surface lithic scatters on
upland terraces and ridges (Black 1989b:25, 1989c:48). A few Paleoindian components deeply
buried in alluvium have been discovered, such as the Berclair Terrace site (Sellards 1940), the
Berger Bluff site (Brown 1987; 2006), Kincaid Rockshelter (Collins et al. 1989), the
Wilson-Leonard site (Collins et al. 1993), and at excavations of the Richard Beene site (Thoms
et al. 1996). A well-documented Paleoindian Clovis site in the southern Great Plains just
northeast of theProject Area is the McLean site in Taylor County, west of Abilene (Ray and
Bryan 1938; Sellards 1952). Folsom sites in the area include the Scharbauer site in northwestern
Midland County (Wendorf et al. 1955), and the Adair-Steadman site in north central Nolan
County (Tunnel 1977). A fourth site nearby containing a Milnesand component is Lone Wolf
Creek in northeastern Mitchell County (Wormington 1957). Collins (1995:Table 2) recognizes
three sites that have high-integrity Paleoindian components resting on stable landforms: Kincaid
Rockshelter, Horn Shelter, and Wilson-Leonard. In addition, a late Paleoindian component with
apparent high integrity has also been reported at the St. Mary's Hall site in Bexar County (Hester
1990:14-17; 1995:435). By far, the most robust collection of Paleindian artifacts has been
recovered at the Gault Site in Bell County, Texas. Archaeologists estimate that over 2.3 million
Paleoindian artifacts have been recovered, with only about 3% of the site professionally excavated
thus far (Gault Site 2014).

As the warming that marks the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene climates began to take
effect in Texas, prehistoric inhabitants adapted with changes in lifestyle. This climatic shift is also
marked by the decline and extinction of mammoth, mastodon, horse, camel, and giant bison
(Bison antiquus). With the possible exception of the Berclair Terrace site (Sellards 1940),
archaeological evidence suggests that after 8000 B.P., large gregarious game animals were either
extinct or otherwise extricated from Texas. Human hunters were forced to concentrate on deer,
antelope, and other medium-size or smaller game. Changes in the subsistence base required
technological shifts that mark the beginning of a new cultural period known as the Archaic.
Early Archaic
Collins (1995:383) dates the Early Archaic from 8800 to 6000 B.P. in central Texas, with three
divisions based on projectile point types, while Hester (1995:436B438) identifies the Early
Archaic with Early Corner Notched and Early Basal Notched dart points roughly dating between
7950 to 4450 B.P. The Early Archaic on the Southern Great Plains is approximated at 8000-5000
B. P. (Hofman 1989), although Johnson and Holliday (1986) offer more fine-grained dates for
the Llano Estacado from the Lubbock Lake site of 8500–6400 B.P. The extinction of large herds
of megafauna and the changing climate at the beginning of the Holocene stimulated a behavioral
change by the Prehistoric inhabitants of South Texas (McKinney 1981). While the basic
hunter-gatherer adaptation probably remained intact, an economic shift away from big game
hunting was necessary. In general, more intensive exploitation of local resources in central Texas,
such as deer, fish, and plant bulbs is indicated by greater densities of ground-stone artifacts,
fire-cracked rock cooking features, and more specialized tools such as Clear Fork gouges and
Guadalupe bifaces (Turner et al. 2011). Weir (1976) speculates that Early Archaic groups were
small and highly mobile, an inference from the fact that Early Archaic sites are thinly distributed
and that diagnostic types are seen across a wide area, including most of Texas and northern
Mexico. Hurt (1980) suggests that the decline in the number of bison on the plains forced the
inhabitants to broaden their diets to pursue plants and animals which would produce the same
amount of calories and protein with the same or slightly more effort expended. Using projectile
points as temporal markers, Hurt (1980:vi) argues that the Tom Green County area was used
more frequently in the Early Archaic than in the Middle and Late Archaic, probably due to
"decline of bison and other game animals on the Southern Plains." Story (1985), however,
believes that population densities were low during this period, and that groups consisted of
related individuals in small bands with "few constraints on their mobility" (Story 1985:39). Their
economy was based on diffuse utilization of a wide range of resources, especially such year-round
resources as prickly pear and lechugilla, as well as rodents, rabbits, and deer (Story 1985:38).
Middle Archaic
Collins (1995:383) defines this intermediate interval of the Archaic as lasting from about
6000-4000 B.P. in central Texas, but Hester (1995:438-441) suggests that the period between
4450 and 2350 B.P. more correctly reflects the Middle Archaic in south Texas. The Southern
Plains Middle Archaic complex as derived from changes in climate and subsistence is recognized
generally as the period between 5000–3000 B.P. (Hofman 1989:45-47), and more specifically as
6400–4500 B.P. on the Llano Estacado (Johnson and Holliday 1986:46). The Middle Archaic
appears to have been a time of increased population, based on the large number of sites from this
8

period in south and central Texas (Story 1985:40; Weir 1976:125, 128). The reasons for this
increase are not known, but the amelioration of a very dry period (Altithermal) during the Early
Archaic is often seen as the prime mover (Sollberger and Hester 1972:338; Story 1985:40). A
wide variation in projectile point styles at the Jonas Terrace site suggest "a time of ethnic and
cultural variety, as well as group movement and immigration." (Johnson 1995:285). Hurt (1980)
posits that the quantity of diversified game animals on the Southern Great Plains decreased, and
thus lead to an intensified, less broad diet. On the South Texas Plains, exploitation of widely
scattered, year-round resources such as prickly pear continued (Campbell and Campbell
1981:13-15), as did hunting deer and rabbit. However, a shift to concentrated, seasonal nut
harvests in the riverine environments of the Balcones Escarpment seems to have occurred (Black
1989a). Weir (1976) believes that an expansion of oak on the Edwards Plateau and Balcones
Escarpment led to intensive plant gathering and acorn processing. He also believes that the widely
scattered bands prevalent in the Early Archaic now began to coalesce, at least during the
acorn-gathering season, into larger groups who shared the intensive work of gathering and
processing the acorn harvest (Weir 1976:126). Many researchers believe burned rock middens
are a result of this endeavor (Creel 1986; Prewitt 1991; Weir 1976). Other investigators doubt
this conclusion (Black et al. 1993; Goode 1991), but the exact processes which formed the
burned rock middens are still a matter of controversy (Black 1989b:28; Black et al. 1997; Hester
1991a; Leach and Bousman 1998).
On the Edwards Plateau, they may have come together to gather acorns, and then built large
cooking ovens to steam the tanic acid out of them to make them edible (Weir 1976). The large
cooking ovens were apparently used over and over again. Whether they were repeatedly used
within just a few years or over several hundred years is still being debated, but the consensus
seems to be that they were used to cook not only deer, but also a great deal of tubers and other
plants (Black et al. 1997; Mauldin et al. 2003). These large cooking ovens which contain mounds
of accumulated firecracked rocks are called “burned rock middens” in the archaeological
community, but are sometimes referred to as “Indian mounds” by artifact collectors.
The common presence of deer remains in burned rock middens encourages the view that deer
processing took place at burned rock midden sites (Nickels et al. 2001; Black and McGraw
1985:278; Weir 1976:125). Bison bone is encountered in archaeological sites in central and south
Texas, at least occasionally, during all but the earliest part of the Middle Archaic (Dillehay 1974).
There has been a tendency to equate presence of burned rock middens with absence of bison
(Prewitt 1981); however, examinations of several recent faunal reports show that after about
4500 B.P. bison and burned rock middens are contemporaneous, though not at the same sites,
at least in the southern Edwards Plateau and northern South Texas Plain (Meissner 1993). Collins
(1995:Table 2) recognizes only one site in central Texas that has a high integrity Middle Archaic
component resting on a stable landform: Landslide.
Late Archaic
Collins (1995:384) dates the final interval of the Archaic in central Texas to approximately 4000
- 800 B.P. Hester believes the Late Archaic in south Texas may better be defined as between
2350 - 1250 B.P., while Hofman's (1989:45) synthesis of the data places the Late Archaic on the
9

Southern Plains as 3000–2000 B.P., and possibly later. Johnson and Holiday (1986:46) specify
4500–2000 B.P. as the Late Archaic period on the Llano Estacado. Some researchers believe
populations increased throughout the Late Archaic (Prewitt 1985), while others feel populations
remained the same or fell during this period (Black 1989b:30). Prewitt (1981b:80-81) asserts that
the accumulation of burned rock middens nearly ceased during the course of this period; however,
excavations at the Blue Hole site in Uvalde County (Mueggenborg 1994:1-74), the Honey Creek
midden at 41MS32 (Black et al. 1997), the Jonas Terrace site in Medina County (Johnson 1995),
a series of middens at Camp Bowie in Brown County (Mauldin et al. 2003), and the Mingo site
in Bandera County (Houk and Lohse 1993:193-248) provide evidence that large cooking features
up to 15 m in diameter were still very much in use (see also Black et al. 1996). Subsistence is
assumed to have become less specialized and focused on acorns, in favor of a broad spectrum
subsistence base (Black 1989b:30). Hurt (1980) asserts that bison began returning to the
Southern Great Plains area, and we see an increase in intensive processing of bison, as well as
mussel shells during the Late Archaic. However, by about 1450 B.P., bison had again disappeared
(Dillehay 1974).
The proliferation of distinguishable human cemeteries has been attributed to this period, with the
earliest occurrences dating to the south Texas Middle Archaic (Hester 1995:439-440). At Loma
Sandia, these date between ca. 2550 and 2750 B.P. (Taylor and Highley 1995). Story
(1985:44-45) believes the presence of cemeteries at sites such as Ernest Witte (Hall 1981),
Hitzfelder Cave (Givens 1968b), and Olmos Dam (Lukowski 1988) indicates that Late Archaic
populations in central and south Texas were increasing and becoming more territorial. Hurt
(1980) further posits that population in the Tom Green County area peaked during the Late
Archaic with groups moving into the area from Central Texas; before that the complex of artifacts
found in the region were more closely associated with those of the Trans-Pecos region.
Although inhabitants of the South Texas Plain near Brownsville and Rockport had begun to make
pottery by about 1750 B.P., the northern part of the plain was still "pre-ceramic" until 1,000 years
later (Story 1985:45-47). Late Archaic points tend to be much smaller than Middle Archaic
points. The most common are Ensor and Frio types (Turner et al. 2011), both of which are short,
triangular points with side notches. The Frio point also has a notched base (Turner et al. 2011).
Collins (1995:Table 2) recognizes three sites within central Texas with high-integrity Late Archaic
components resting on stable landforms: Anthon, Loeve-Fox, and 41GT91.
Transitional Archaic
A late subperiod or interval of the Late Archaic is frequently referred to as the Terminal Archaic
or Transitional Archaic. Weir (1976) defines the Terminal Archaic as 1650-1150 B.P., while
Turner et al. (2011) cite data placing the Transitional Archaic as 2250-1250 B.P. Although Hester
may lump current data into a Late Archaic period, he cautions that more evidence will likely result
in what may be termed as a “Terminal Archaic” period during the latter part of the Late Archaic
in south Texas. This Terminal Archaic period is represented by diagnostics such as Ensor, Frio,
and Matamoras points which appear to overlap the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods
(Hester 1995:442). Weir (1976) believes this marked a transition period to localized area sites,
a disappearance of burned rock middens and bison, and a reappearance of highly mobile hunters
10

and gatherers. Others (Black and McGraw 1985; Peter 1982; Skelton 1977) argue that in some
locations burned rock middens did not disappear and sites were more intensely occupied during
the Transitional Archaic period. During the Early Neo-Indian period on the Southern Great Plains
(ca. 950–1450 B.P.), Hurt (1980) presents evidence for perhaps a decrease in bison processing;
consistent with Dillehay's (1974) contention that there are now less bison available in the area due
to climatic changes, which also lowered water tables to alkalinity levels.
Late Prehistoric/Plains Woodland
The term “Late Prehistoric” is commonly used to designate the period following the Late Archaic
in central and south Texas, while the term “Plains Woodland or Woodland” is commonly used
on the Southern Great Plains. Collins (1995:385) recognizes that the commonly used date of 1200
B.P. for the end of the Archaic and beginning of the Late Prehistoric in central Texas is arbitrary,
and Hester (1995:442) acknowledges the problematic issue of selected tools appearing at both
Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric sites. A series of distinctive traits marks the shift from the
Archaic to the Late Prehistoric period, including the technological shift to the bow and arrow and
the introduction of pottery to central Texas and the northern South Texas Plain (Black 1989b:32;
Story 1985:45-47). Two complexes following the Late Archaic in the Southern Great Plains
region are the Plains Woodland from about 2000-1150 B.P., and the Plains Village from
1150-450 B.P. (Hofman 1989:61-90). Most researchers agree the early Late Prehistoric period
was a time of population decrease (Black 1989b:32). Though small burned rock middens
associated with Scallorn and Edwards points have been found (Goode 1991:71; Houk and Lohse
1993:193-248), they are rare. Settlement shifts into rockshelters such as Scorpion Cave in Medina
County (Highley et al. 1978) and Classen Rockshelter in northern Bexar County (Fox and Fox
1967) have been noted (Shafer 1977; Skinner 1981). Cemeteries from this period often reveal
evidence of conflict (Black 1989b:32). For example, an excavation of a burial just north of San
Antonio (41BX952) revealed an Edwards point between two lumbar vertebra (Meissner 1991).
Sites from the Austin phase include Quinta Medina (Guderjan et al. 1992, 1993) and Panther
Springs Creek, 41BX228 (Black and McGraw 1985). Collins (1995:Table 2) recognizes eight
central Texas sites with high integrity Late Prehistoric components resting on stable landforms:
Loeve-Fox, Frisch Auf!, Smith, Rush, Mustang Branch, Rocky Branch B, and Currie.
Beginning rather abruptly at about 650 B.P., a shift in technology occurred. This phase is
characterized by the introduction of blade technology, the first ceramics in central Texas
(bone-tempered plainwares), the appearance of Perdiz arrow points, and alternately beveled
bifaces (Black 1989b:32; Huebner 1991:346). Prewitt (1985) and Black (1989b) suggest this
technology encroached from north-central Texas. Patterson (1988), however, notes the Perdiz
point was first seen in southeast Texas by about 1350 B.P., and was introduced to the west some
600-700 years later. Hester (1995:444) recognizes this phase as the "best documented Late
Prehistoric pattern" throughout south Texas, with dates ranging between ca. 650/700 to 300/350
B.P.
Steele and Assad Hunter (1986) argue for the occurrence of a distinct change in diet between the
Late Archaic and the Late Prehistoric components in two sites in the Choke Canyon Reservoir
area in south Texas. Analysis of the number of identified specimens (NISP) shows a marked
11

increase in artiodactyl elements present during the late Late Prehistoric, an increase largely due
to the addition of bison to the "menu" (Steele and Assad Hunter 1986:468). Huebner (1991)
suggests that the sudden return of bison to south and central Texas resulted from a more xeric
climate in the plains north of Texas, and increased grass in the Cross-Timbers and Post Oak
Savannah in north central Texas, forming a "bison corridor" into the South Texas Plain along the
eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau (Huebner 1991:354-355). Sites from this period frequently
have associated bison (Black 1986; Black and McGraw 1985; Henderson 1978; Hulbert 1985;
Prewitt 1974). However, according to Hurt (1980), the Late Neo-Indian period on the Southern
Great Plains (ca. 950 – 450 B.P.) is mirrored in the archaeological record by an absence of bison
and vegetal matter, most likely due to the increased alkalinity in the region's water sources. “It
is interesting to note that a Neo-Indian site characterized by Perdiz points is known from the
South Concho, but do not occur here (Middle Concho). This might suggest that the Middle
Concho received scant visitation during this period, and insufficient use as to leave detectable
archeological evidence” (Hurt 1980:107).
The only archaeological evidence that domesticated plants were ever introduced in south or
central Texas is a single corncob found in Late Prehistoric context in Timmeron Rock Shelter
(Harris 1985), one found during excavations in Kyle Rockshelter in Hill County (Jelks 1962:113114), and Zea mays remains at the Wild Turkey Midden (41MI8) in Mills County (Holloway
1988:4,8). There is simply not enough to postulate there was ever a significant presence of maize
in the area. Only the arrival of the Spanish brought significant cultivars to south and central
Texas.
Historic Period
The end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic period in both central, south, and
the Southern Plains in northern Texas should be characterized by written accounts of European
contact with indigenous groups. Collins (1995:386-387) offers that the Historic period then
begins ca. 260 B.P. in central Texas. However in south Texas, Hester (1995:450-451) agrees with
Adkins and Adkins (1982:242) when he suggests that the indigenous groups may have been
affected by European influence but we are only able to observe the materials in the archaeological
record because the written accounts simply are not available. He would rather label this largely
unknown period “Protohistoric”. Hofman (1989:91) agrees that "The Protohistoric period is
encompassed by the time when there were limited European contacts with the area and brief
records of these journeys, but no proper history." The cultural context for the historic groups in
the area of study is largely conditioned by the presence of outside ethnic groups and regional
power struggles. The numerous small groups of Jumanos and Coahuiltecans encountered by the
early explorers and later Spanish intrusions are addressed in many sources (Campbell 1983;
Campbell and Campbell 1985; Hester 1989; John 1975; Newcomb 1961; Swanton 1952). The
various later intrusive groups, such as Tonkawa, Lipan Apache, and Comanche, are also
described by numerous researchers (Ewers 1969; Hester 1989; Jones 1969; Kelley 1971;
Newcomb 1961, 1993; Sjoberg 1953a, 1953b).
At the beginning of the seventeenth century, many south Texas Indian groups were being pushed
northward by continual Spanish expansion. By the mid-seventeenth century, a new pressure on
12

the Indians indigenous to the area began to come from the north: a nomadic group, the Apache
adapted to a more Plains-lifeway style of bison hunting once they acquired horses from the
Spaniards (Campbell and Campbell 1985:27). Later, the Apaches were to be displaced by another
group of nomadic, bison-hunting Indians - the Comanches - from the high-lands of central Texas
(Campbell 1991:111).
A combination of migration, demoralization, inner-group conflict, disease, and death due to
warfare fragmented the native Indian groups, and forced continual mixing and remixing among
them (Bolton 1915; Campbell 1975, 1991:345; León et al. 1961). Most of the native languages
have been lost, although recent attempts at reconstruction are enlightening (e.g. Johnson 1994a;
Johnson and Campbell 1992). The establishment and relocation of Spanish Catholic missions
along the Concho, San Saba, and San Antonio Rivers in the late 1600s and early 1700s induced
many groups to seek the relative comfort and protection offered by a sedentary, apparently
well-fed, and peaceful coexistence (Campbell and Campbell 1985; Chipman 1992; de la Teja
1988; Habig 1968a, 1968b; Hard et al 1995; Inglis 1964). Although fear of the invading Apache
and Comanche pressured many of the Indians to seek the protection of missions, they were now
exposed to the exploitation of the Spanish (Campbell 1975:2, 1991:346-347).
In the autumn of 1785, a peace treaty with the Comanches signaled the opening of a period of
peaceful coexistence in which Comanches brought hides, meat, and tallow to the area to trade for
goods and services not available elsewhere, such as blacksmithing and gun repair (Poyo and
Hinojosa 1991:125-126). The few Comanche who entered the missions were apparently women
and children who were captured during punitive raids by Spanish soldiers (Campbell and
Campbell 1985:26).
Apaches continued to range over the area between San Antonio and Laredo until the early 1800s,
pushed southward by the invading Comanche who had moved into the Hill Country of central
Texas (Campbell and Campbell 1985:27). Weary of warfare with the Comanche, a few Apache
were beginning to seek asylum in the missions (McGraw and Hindes 1987:367; West 1904:50).
However few landowners dared to live on their outlying lands until about 1840, when a treaty
with the Apaches brought peace for a while (de la Teja 1988:167).
The newly formed government of Texas gave land grants that were large, consisting of around
5,000 acres for each property, and Spanish cattle ranching became prevalent south and southeast
of San Antonio (Jackson 1986), however the vast expanse west of San Antonio toward the
Concho River region was not settled until the late 1800s. Around 1840, settlers from Germany
and Alsace-Lorraine and from other regions of the United States began to move into the Hill
Country to the north, settling into communities such as Boerne, and raised sheep or cattle
(Freeman 1994:5-9). Although the Fisher-Miller land grant contract with the Republic of Texas
was not entirely successful, it did provide the impetus for John Muesebach to initiate a peace
treaty with the Comanches occupying the region (King 1967:111-118; Tiling 1913:100). Finally,
the arrival of pioneer ranchers such as Richard F. Tankersley signaled a foothold on Anglo
settlement in the Tom Green County area (Barton 1998).

Archaeological Atlas Site Results
A review of the Texas Atlas indicated that the G. Washington Tower site had not been subjected
to a cultural resources survey. As shown in Figure 3, the closest cultural resources survey was
conducted by Texas Department of Highway and Public Transportation (TDHPT) archaeologists
along Highway 87 in 1975. During that survey, no archaeological sites were discovered within
one mile of the proposed G. Washington Cell Tower site (Atlas 2014).
There are over 500 documented archaeological sites in Tom Green County, and together they
begin to convey a glimpse of how the landscape may have been exploited over the past several
millennia in the area. It is evident that humans have lived in the area from the Paleoindian interval,
perhaps as long ago as 11,500 years ago.
Previous archaeological investigations in the vicinity were undertaken by Tom Kelly on the North
Concho River in 1946 (Stephenson 1949). Two years later, members of the Smithsonian River
Basin Survey (Stephenson 1949) recorded 13 sites which would be impacted by the construction
of the San Angelo Reservoir (later named O. C. Fisher Lake). None of the 13 were considered
significant at the time and thus no further work was recommended. Willis (1958) and members
of the West Texas Museum at Texas Technological College (now Texas Tech University,
Lubbock) conducted a survey of the Spring Creek channel just above the proposed Twin Butte
Reservoir dam and documented 5 sites. One of those was 41TG109, excavated by Green (1959).
Little professional archaeology was conducted in the county until Southern Methodist University
tested four possible prehistoric quarry sites on the Willow Creek Watershed in the northeast
portion of the county in the mid 1970s (Banks and Bagot 1975). A few years later, Mayer-Oakes
(1977) documented a site on O.C. Fisher Lake (San Angelo Reservoir) with a petroglyph of a
human stick figure utilizing a bow and arrow carved into a boulder.
Darrel Creel conducted a survey along a portion of the South Concho River, upstream from the
Twin Buttes Reservoir, and tried to correlate archaeological sites with macro environmental
zones (Creel 1978). Creel documented 41TG91, a site excavated in 1978 by the Texas State
Department of Highways and Transportation (Luke 1978; Creel 1990), and located in a levee
deposit of the South Concho River nearly in the center of Tom Green County. The site held a
Toyah complex assemblage consisting of at least five slab-lined hearths, two mussel shell
concentrations, and one chert debitage concentration. Human remains of perhaps 2 individuals
were found, and probably most significant were the 447 sherds representing at least 18 vessels.
Hurt’s (1980) evaluation of landscape usage through time is quite thorough. During his
systematic survey in transects along the Middle Concho and its tributaries in western Tom Green
and eastern Irion counties, he recorded 48 prehistoric sites, mostly open campsites. In 1985, a
survey of the potential borrow areas for the reworking of the Twin Buttes Reservoir dam was
completed by Meeks Etchieson, which concluded with the discovery of 10 prehistoric sites. Of
these 10 sites, seven were lithic scatters, two were burned rock accumulations/middens, and one
was a lithic procurement site (Etchieson 1985).
14

In 1990, James E. Warren headed two investigations for the City of San Angelo. One
investigation was concerned with revisiting 41TG280, 41TG282, and 41TG283. The other was
a survey of 1,200 acres of the San Angelo City Farm. Testing at the three sites (41TG280,
41TG282, and 41TG283) revealed that they were badly disturbed due to cultivation and therefore
no additional work was warranted (Warren 1991).
Thirteen previously unrecorded sites were documented during the San Angelo City Farm Project.
Eight of these sites were open campsites with lithic workshop areas. The remaining five were
lithic procurement/testing areas, one of which included a burial (41TG291). One was a river
terrace camp, and the last was a historical farmstead. Site 41TG289, an open campsite/lithic
workshop contained several diagnostics that included Perdiz, Martindale, Travis, Frio, Ensor,
Catan, Edgewood, Darl, Kent, Pandale, Lange, Scallorn, Bulverde, and Uvalde points (Warren
1991). Other cultural material documented included Leon Plain ceramic fragments (41TG289),
Olivella shell beads (41TG286), metate fragments (41TG288), and a limestone mano (41TG298).
41TG351 is an open campsite dating to the Early, and perhaps Middle to Late Archaic found
during a survey for the proposed Rio Vista sewer main, and later tested by McCulloch (1995,
1997). While surveys were in progress for the installation of a pipeline from O.H. Ivie Reservoir
in 1993, two sites (41TG346 and 41TG347) were discovered along the planned pipeline route.
Excavations were immediately begun to avoid interrupting pipeline installation progress.
41TG346 was characterized as being an open campsite that contained many campfire features.
Twenty identifiable Late Prehistoric arrow points were recovered, including 16 Perdiz, 2 Harrell
(tri-notched),1 Garza (basal notched) and 1 Cliffton; (Quigg 1995). 41TG347 is believed to be
a possible Late Prehistoric campsite with hearth clusters and a few manuports. Many bison bones
were found here along with one biface knife fragment.
During 1993 and 1994, A City of San Angelo Wastewater Improvement Project survey was
conducted and excavations of 41TG307 and 41TG309 were conducted by Quigg and others
(1996) in 1993 and 1994. 41TG307 is an open campsite, with an unknown occupation period.
The site contained a possible hearth, although it was badly scattered down the slope of a cutbank.
41TG309 appears to be an Archaic open occupation site. It contains several hearth features, a
lithic scatter, a probable dart point preform, and a mano fragment.
In May 1997, the City of San Angelo, Department of Public Works requested a cultural resources
investigation of a proposed pipeline route east of the city. The route was to cross over the
previously recorded Concho Mortar Site (41TG308), an open campsite and lithic workshop with
chert knapping debris and bedrock mortars (McCulloch and Warren 1998).
In November 1998, the Center for Archaeological Research (CAR) of The University of Texas
at San Antonio (UTSA) contracted with the United States Department of the Interior, Bureau
of Reclamation to conduct a Class III archaeological survey of just over 10,000 acres (4047 ha.)
of mostly undisturbed land at Twin Buttes Reservoir, a flood control and irrigation facility near
the city of San Angelo in west central Tom Green County, Texas. The purpose of this project
was to identify and map archaeological sites on Bureau of Reclamation lands in the reservoir area.
15

The Twin Buttes archaeological project involved a 100% pedestrian survey of 10,195 acres . The
survey identified a total of 178 new sites, and 21 previously recorded sites were revisited. In
conjunction with the survey, CAR also conducted a limited surface collection strategy focused
on temporally diagnostic artifacts, field analysis of 21,769 artifacts on 97 selected sites, 1058
shovel tests and 57 auger tests on 187 sites, 48 shovel tests off-site, five 1 x 1 meter handexcavated units on four sites, and 10 backhoe trenches. The backhoe trenches were excavated
in conjunction with a geomorphic study, designed to accompany the archaeological work
(Mauldin and Nickels 2003).

Project Goals and Methods
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with shovel testing. The topics addressed were site
type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The theoretical framework was structured
around patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems for the region.
The goals of the project were to (1) locate and record any cultural artifacts in the project area
using a systematic survey methodology, (2) quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy,
and (3) place any
diagnostic
artifacts within
the regional time
frame.
Methods
Prior to the
archaeological
survey, the area
to be impacted
had been clearly
delineated with
survey pin flags
and an iron
survey rod in the
site’s centroid
(Figure 6). In
Accordance with
Texas Historical
C o m m i s s i o n Figure 6. The cell tower footprint was clearly delineated with pin flags
( T H C ) a n d (facing southeast).
16

Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Archaeology Survey Standards, a systematic, 100%
pedestrian survey of the delineated tract was conducted. Soils matrices from the six shovel tests
were screened through 1/4-inch wire mesh. In accordance with a designed research plan, all
redundant artifacts recovered from shovel tests were not to be collected, but were to be placed
in the upper 10 cm of the backfilled shovel test. Excavation of the shovel tests were terminated
at 60 centimeters below the surface (cmbs).

Results of the Investigations
Surface Examination and Shovel Testing
The immediate area of the tower footprint area was heavily disturbed due to plowing, discing, and
planting of cash crops. During our June 2014 examination, it was apparent that the land had
recently been worked, and cotton plants were growing in rows (see for example, Figure 7). On
the surface were widely scattered, angular and fragmented white limestone pieces to baseball size.
Six shovel tests placed within the tower’s footprint (Figure 8) revealed grayish brown (10YR5/2)
clay loam with fragmented limestone roughly < 1-centimeter in size in the upper 20-22
centimeters (cm). This upper portion was apparently the often plowed zone. Between 22 and 60
cm below the surface, there was an increase in clay content, a subtle change in color to lighter
grayish brown (10YR6/2), accompanied by rough-edged limestone nodule inclusions <2% by
volume. Despite the moistened soils at the time, evidence of vertical cracking was apparent to 30
cmbs.

shovel testing

Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
A thorough pedestrian survey of the surface that offered up to 100% visibility within the Project
Area was conducted, and six shovel tests were excavated, but no evidence of neither prehistoric
nor historic occupation was found. Therefore, we recommend that the project should proceed as
currently designed by the project sponsor. The project should be considered as having “no effect”
on any properties considered as eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places
or inclusion in the State Archeological Landmarks Program. As such, the project should proceed
without further archaeological work. However, if any cultural resources are encountered during
construction within the APE, work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds
are examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant,
and by the Texas Historical Commission.
