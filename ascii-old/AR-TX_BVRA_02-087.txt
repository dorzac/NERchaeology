ABSTRACT
A "desk top" study of existing literature regarding the site of a proposed visitor
center at Block 51 in Bryan, Texas was performed by Brazos Valley Research
Associates (BVRA) in September 2001 at the request of the City of Bryan. This study
confirmed the presence of two extant 19th century structures, a residence (circa 18671870) and a carriage house (circa 1888) as well as the footprint of a 1903 residence.
Although others may have occupied the original house, it was mainly the residence of
John William Coulter, a prominent businessman in the community who moved with his
family into the "big house" constructed in 1903 on the same lot. Block 51 was the site of
historic occupation from the 19th century through the latter part of the 20th century
when the 1903 house was moved to its current location in Fayette County, Texas. The
original house occupied by John William Coulter has been determined to be eligible for
listing in the National Register of Historic Places by the Texas Historical Commission.
The review was conducted by Chief Historian Jim Steely (see his letter in Appendix I).
The records for this project have been placed in permanent curation at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory on the campus of The University of Texas at Austin.

INTRODUCTION

The City of Bryan proposes to construct a visitor center on Block 51 that contains
two standing structures dating to the 19th century and the footprint of a more recent
house that was constructed in 1903 by John William Coulter, a prominent Bryan
business man. Funding will be provided by the Statewide Transportation Enhancement
Program through the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). It is the intent of
the City of Bryan to integrate the standing structures into the visitor center complex.
The original house and the carriage house have already been restored by descendants
of the Coulter family. The carriage house will be an integral part of the visitor center as
it will contain displays that will interpret modes of transportation from 1880 to the
present. The purpose of the museum will be to educate visitors as to the part that the
carriage house played in the surface transportation system and how that system
evolved. Other transportation related displays would also be utilized to enhance this
central theme. The footprint of the 1903 house built by Mr. Coulter will be preserved,
and a dry rock wall will be placed along the footprint in order to define the limits of this
house. The site of the project area and its location within Brazos County is depicted in
Figure 1.
It is important to note here that the city block with its two 19th century structures
have been deemed eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places by the
State Historic Preservation Officer, Texas Historical Commission (Appendix I). Since
state funding is being made available for this project, it must be determined if the
proposed construction will adversely affect this National Register property. In order to
satisfy this requirement, the City of Bryan contracted with Brazos Valley Research
Associates (BVRA) to perform a preliminary assessment of the project area and make
recommendations regarding any future work that may be necessary prior to construction
of the visitor center.

METHODS
The methods employed during this assessment are essentially those that are
commonly described as a "desk top" survey. Virtually all of the information presented in
this report was obtained from reading several reports that have been produced by
various researchers interested in the history of the buildings that once occupied Block
51 in the City of Bryan. These reports contain information taken from the County
Courthouse (deed records), City of Bryan library archives, Texas A&M University
archives, Brazos County Appraisal District, Brazos County Tax Assessor's Office, and
interviews with Brazos County Heritage Society members. Soil data on the site were
obtained from a geotechnical investigation of the proposed construction area by
Buchanan/Soil Mechanics, Inc. of Bryan, Texas. In addition, the project area was
examined by the Principal Investigator and draftsperson in order to collect data used (in
conjunction with other maps drafted by previous researchers) to provide the project area
map depicted in this report (Figure 2).

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The early history of Block 51 is somewhat confusing. According to Hawthorne
(1991), the Coulter house began as a seven-room structure built by Thomas D. Harrison
who apparently paid taxes on this property in 1869. This description of the house
conflicts with that provided by Grots et al. (1991) in that they state the house began as a
two-room structure. It is known, however, that John William Coulter was living there by
the early 1870s with his family. According to Grots et al. (1991), this structure was
expanded, probably in the 1870s, as a room was added to the north creating a threeroom building. Sometime in the 1890s, the one room addition and half of the original
dog run was demolished leaving the enclosed breezeway and the other half of the dog
run (Grots et al. 1991). Thus, the integrity of this significant structure, now referred to
as a remnant house, has been compromised. The original house as it appears today
following restoration by the descendants of the Coulter family is depicted in Figure 3.
A carriage house was constructed to the northwest of the original house about
1888 on the northwest corner of the property. No information was found regarding the
history of this structure. In a detailed study of this building by Hawthorne et al. (1991)
the hypothesis was made that some of the wood used in its construction may have
come from the original 1860s house, possibly about the time it was moved to make
room for the 1903 house discussed below. Figure 4 depicts the carriage house as it
appears today following restoration by the descendants of the Coulter family.
The Coulter family outgrew the small residence, and a new house was
constructed by the architectural firm Wemyss-Smith in Waco. To make room for the
new house, the original structure was moved "back, out of the way of the new house
under construction" (Hawthorne 1991:8) where it continued to house servants. It seems
likely that the original house was located within the current footprint of the 1903 house.
This argument seems to be supported by the presence of a cistern within the footprint of
the 1903 structure (Figure 2). Alternately, it is possible that the cistern was built to
serve the 1903 house. In this instance the cistern would have underlain the floor of the
home and water would have been accessed by a hand pump.
The 1903 house is much better documented than the original dog run building.
Several photographs of it are on file at the Bryan Public Library, and the lot is depicted
on the 1912 Sanborn Insurance Map. According to a study conducted by the
Department of Architecture and the Historic Imaging Laboratory, Texas A&M University
(1992:4), the 1903 house had three cisterns. This structure was moved from its original
location (Block 51) to the Gay Hill community in Fayette County, Texas in 1975 where it
remains today.
Following the restoration of the remnant house by a local firm at the expense of
the Coulter family descendants, a cistern was located and capped (Figure 2). Also, the
location of a recently demolished privy adjacent to the remnant house (Figure 2) has
been identified (Hawthorne et al. 1991:2).

The extensive research conducted for this project has not revealed any evidence
of historic utilization of the area that will be affected by construction of the visitor center.
A verbal description of the block by an earlier resident of the area states that after the
1903 house was built the smaller house was occupied by a servant with fence lines
separating the block into quadrants. The quadrant on the northeast corner was used as
pasture for a cow that was milked in the stall on the north side of the carriage house.
There was a small pond in the pasture area, but its location has not been identified.
Following the removal of the 1903 house, City Block 51 has remained idle until
renovation of the remnant house by the Coulter family.
A geotechnical investigation of the proposed construction area was conducted by
Buchanan/Soil Mechanics, Inc. of Bryan, Texas on July 18, 2001. Three cores were
bored in the area. The logs of these borings reveal essentially undisturbed natural soil
at the surface and offer no evidence of fill deposition at the site. The absence of
evidence for extensive near-surface disturbance suggests that there is reasonable
potential for intact archaeological deposits. The core boring localities are depicted on
Figure 2.
There are two areas of Block 51 to be considered prior to construction of the
visitor center. These are the site of the remnant house, existing carriage house, and
footprint of the 1903 house (Area A) and the unimproved section outside the fence line
of the 1903 house that will house the museum and parking lot (Area B). Area A will be
affected by construction of foot paths, historical markers, trees and shrubs, and a dry
rock wall outlining the footprint of the 1903 house site.
Area B, however, will be permanently altered through construction of the
museum (including restrooms) and parking lot. Based on the archival work that has
been conducted to date it is my opinion that Area A is the only portion of Block 51 that
contained standing structures. It is likely that all cisterns and privies are located in this
area as well. Therefore, it is hypothesized that there is a moderate probability that pre1870 features exist within Area B. An example of a class of feature that may be found
at a greater distance from the residences and within Area B are trash pits. It seems
probable that the presence of any previous structures in either Area A or Area B would
have been identified through the archival work conducted by the various researchers.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Although there appears to be only a moderate probability of pre-1870 features
within the area to be affected by construction of the visitor center as currently planned,
this cannot be stated with any degree of certainty without subsurface investigation.
Early features that may be present include privies, cisterns, and trash pits. It is,
therefore, recommended that the proposed construction area be examined by stripping
away the surface layer using a trackhoe or gradall. This procedure will guarantee that
all subsurface features (if any exist) will be identified. These features will be mapped
and photographed, and their significance will be assessed.
