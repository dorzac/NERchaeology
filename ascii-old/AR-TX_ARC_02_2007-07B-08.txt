ABSTRACT
Excavation at the Sonntag Family Cemetery was carried out by AR
Consultants, Inc. after the North Texas Tollway Authority learned that
genealogical records showed that a child by the name of Ireba Kelsay had
been buried in the cemetery is 1902. Previous records had shown that the
cemetery was abandoned in 1974 when the Sonntag Family moved the
known graves and headstones prior to the sale of the property. The
roadway that had subsequently been built over the cemetery area was
removed in anticipation of the construction of the northerly extension of
the Dallas North Tollway between SH 121 and US380 west of Frisco,
Texas. Once the recently built roadway was removed, a bulldozer and a
road grader were used to remove the blackland topsoil and cut into the
underlying limestone. This resulted in the discovery of a small grave shaft
stain and an adjacent disturbed area. Burial 1, a young child, was found
inside a small hexagonal-shaped wooden casket at the bottom of the grave
shaft. Artifacts in the grave indicate burial at about AD 1900.The child
was young enough to have been Ireba Kelsay and this may be confirmed
by DNA testing. A trench in the disturbed area located a pair of nested
caskets that contained the skeleton of a teenager. This burial is believed to
have been a Sonntag family child. The metal handles and other casket
parts which include a large viewing window date this burial to about AD
1915. Bone and wood were not well preserved in either burial Both burials
will be reinterred in a local cemetery. The investigation was done under
the authority of Texas Antiquities Permit 4231. Records will be curated at
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Numerous people and companies assisted in the excavation and in the research that were
carried out as part of this investigation. First and foremost we want to thank Ben
Beckelman of Frisco for contacted the North Texas Tollway Authority about the
genealogical records he had reviewed. Secondly, we want to thank NTTA for pursuing
their stated position with regard to historic preservation. In particular we want to thank
Mark Bouma, Chris Anderson, and Donna Huerta for their involvement in the project.
We also want to thank Halff Associates, Inc. for providing engineering information and
aerial photographs of the project area. In particular, David Morgan, Vice President for
Environmental Studies and Robert Haney, Survey Party Chief, were most helpful in the
planning and carrying out of the investigation.
The Sonntag family members in North Texas and elsewhere provided valuable
information about their memories of the cemetery and of its being moved in 1974.
Geo-Marine, Inc. of Plano, Texas allowed Angela Tiné the time to conduct excavation of
both graves and then to carryout the analysis of the bones and artifacts found in the
graves. Duane Peter is to be thanked for his interest and support of this investigation.
The initial clearing of the construction area could not have been done so quickly without
the help of Rocky Wisely, Superintendent of the H.B. Zachry Company. Time and again
he provided the men and equipment to do the scraping and trenching needed during the
project. Also of particular help was Gerald Waltman, Project Coordinator for
Management & Engineering Services of KBR, for his help in coordinating equipment
availability and helping to contact various sources during the excavation.
Other people who participated in the investigation include Randy Moir, PhD of Frisco
who was contacted by Mr. Beckelman and who assisted in the excavation of Burial 1 and
in the profiling of the backhoe trench which discovered Burial 2. Robert Laughon, Jr. of
the Collin County Office of the Medical Examiner provided information about the
treatment of the skeletons recovered and about DNA testing.

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
The Sonntag Cemetery (41COL185) is a small family graveyard located in Collin
County, Texas near the southwestern edge of the City of Frisco (Figure 1). The cemetery
is plotted on the Hebron, Texas 7.5’ USGS map which was published in 1960 and photorevised in 1981 even though the family sold the property in the mid-1970s and had the
graves and headstones moved to the Sonntag family section of the Bethel Cemetery in
Frisco (Pitts et al. 1975).
During the planning of the first extension of the Dallas North Tollway, AR Consultants
conducted an archaeological evaluation of the proposed right-of-way (Skinner 1996). At
the time, it was understood that the graves and headstones had been moved to Bethel
Cemetery and it also appeared that the plotted cemetery location was just to the west of
the proposed tollway corridor. At the conclusion of the survey and after report review, the
Texas Historical Commission (THC) agreed that no additional archaeological
investigations were needed along this section of the proposed tollway route.

Not long before construction began on this section of the Dallas North Tollway, a
collection of family genealogical records were passed on to Mr. Benjamin Beckelman of
Frisco due to the death of an older relative. After review of the records, he realized that
his maternal great aunt, Ireba Kelsay, who had died at birth in 1902, was shown on the
genealogical records as having been interred in the Sonntag Cemetery. Mr. Beckelman
advised the North Texas Tollway Authority (NTTA) of this genealogical discovery and
asked what they had done with regard to the exploration of the cemetery. Ultimately,
NTTA contacted Halff Associates, Inc. and they discussed this finding with AR
Consultants, Inc. (ARC) who in turn coordinated with the Texas Historical Commission
(THC) about this previously unreported burial.
NTTA, ARC, and Halff Associates then did further records research and family
interviews to determine if any other evidence of the unreported grave could be verified.
No information was forthcoming but ultimately the location of the cemetery was plotted
on an aerial photograph (Figure 2). This process took the mapped boundaries from the
Hebron, Texas 7.5’ USGS map and applied them to an ortho-photo because no other
cemetery plotting was available. The reliability of the plotting was unknown in part
because the cemetery size was unsure and because of the map scale. This plotting
indicated that the cemetery was situated in part under the southbound access road west of
the proposed construction area but extended in an easterly direction into the construction
area.

Based on the available information, it appeared that the cemetery was 112 feet long eastwest by 75 feet and that the cemetery had been fenced in some way. Thus the family
cemetery covered an area of 0.192 acres. No information was obtained from the records
or the Sonntag Family descendents about the location and arrangement of the graves
within the cemetery. We were unable to locate any photographs of the cemetery when it
was in use or after it was decertified.
Based on this research and the fact that construction of the Lebanon Road bridge over the
tollway was going to remove the bedrock and that destruction was imminent, ARC
recommended that the area between the two existing access roads be scraped down to the
top of the shallow limestone bedrock for the purpose of locating the tops of burial shafts.
At that time, an arrangement was made with Geo-Marine, Inc. of Plano, Texas to
excavate burials if they were uncovered.

BRIEF HISTORY
Details about the Sonntag and Kelsay family histories are limited. Two written accounts
(Anonymous n.d.; Sonntag 1976) of the early history of the Sonntag family in northeast
Texas were available for examination. Both narratives—one of which appears to be an
obituary—however, are brief and tend to conflict on key details. Mr. Beckelman
provided the information about the Kelsay family. The information, however, is secondhand and based on family history, entries in a family Bible, and a family tree compiled by
a relative in the 1970s.

THE SONNTAG FAMILY AND CEMETERY
Fredriech Hermann Sonntag and Augusta Emalie Demier were both born in Germany,
respectively, on July 14, 1846, and August 10, 1850 (Anonymous n.d.; Sonntag 1976).
The two were married in 1871 after Fredriech completed his service in the PrussianFranco War as a member of the Prussian army. By 1877, the couple had four sons and
presumably decided to move to the United States to avoid future mandatory conscription
of their sons into the German army. Fredriech, Augusta, their four sons, and two of
Fredriech’s brothers arrived in Dallas in early 1877. Apparently one brother soon moved
away and was never heard from again. The other worked briefly as a baker in Dallas
before joining Fredriech on his farm (Sonntag 1976). In July 1877, Fredriech purchased
1,078 acres of property in what was then Lebanon, Texas (presently Frisco, Texas), and
settled there with his family. He and Augusta had five more sons and three daughters
(Anonymous n.d.; Sonntag 1976). According to the Sonntag (1976) narrative, one of the
daughters, Minnie, died at the age of 15. Conversely, the anonymous (n.d.) account
indicates that she died in infancy, but also claims that a son named Benjamin died at age
15. The Sonntag (1976) narrative only mentions Benjamin as being one of the Sonntag
children and he is not mentioned again. The lives of the remaining 10 Sonntag children,
however, are summarized in the narrative.

In 1905, Fredriech and Augusta moved to Valles, Mexico, and purchased and settled on
4,200 or 4,400 acres of property, although they periodically returned home to visit their
children (Anonymous n.d.; Sonntag 1976). The Sonntag 1976 narrative indicates that
they took their youngest daughter, Elsie, with them but returned to Frisco three years
later. Fredriech fell ill and died in Mexico on December 14, 1815 (Anonymous n.d.;
Sonntag 1976). Presumably he was buried in Mexico, as well, because there is no
mention of returning his body to Texas. His death occurred at the time of the Mexican
Revolution, and upon receiving a message from their mother and becoming concerned
about her safety, two of the sons, Gottfried and Herman, left to return her to Texas. All
three arrived home on January 10, 1916; however, Augusts soon fell ill and died on
January 26. She was buried in the family graveyard the following day (Anonymous n.d.;
Sonntag 1976). The 10 surviving Sonntag children all married and had children;
however, over the years, many of the family members have left the Frisco area (Sonntag
1976).
THE KELSAY FAMILY
The history of the Kelsay family is even less complete. John George Kelsay was born in
Kentucky in 1870 and moved to Texas in 1888. On July 28, 1895, John married Fannie
Rosella Mayfield in Denton, Texas. Fannie was born July 11, 1877, in Georgia. By
1896, the Kelsays resided in Lebanon, Texas, much of which is now part of Frisco
(Benjamin Beckelman, personal communication 2007). It is uncertain if at this time the
family was residing on the Sonntag farm, as the property would have been in what was
considered Lebanon at the time. John Kelsay worked as a farmer, carpenter, and
blacksmith throughout his life, and he and Fannie had six daughters and four sons. Ireba,
the fourth child and first daughter, was born and died December 14, 1902. She was
reported to have been buried in the Sonntag family cemetery. It is possible that the
Kelsay family moved to the newly incorporated town of Frisco in the early 1900s because
most of residents of Lebanon abandoned the town between 1902 and 1905 after the St.
Louis, San Francisco and Texas Railway bypassed it in 1902 in favor of Frisco, formerly
named Emerson (Minor 2001a, b).
SONNTAG CEMETERY
No one is certain when the cemetery began. The Sonntag matriarch, Augusta, is the only
member of the family whose burial in the cemetery is mentioned in any written accounts,
although her burial, in 1916, appears to have been the last interment. The following three
entries are listed for the cemetery in the first volume of Collin County (Texas) Cemetery
Inscriptions (Pitts et al. 1975):
Sonntag, Fred Herman

The entry also mentions that the cemetery was moved to the Sonntag family section of
Bethel Cemetery in 1974. Any existing grave markers apparently were not moved
because a listing of inscriptions for Bethel Cemetery in Frisco differs in that it uses
initials (F. H.) for Fred(riech), Augusta is listed as “Mrs. F. H.,” and one “n” is missing
from Alfred Benjamin’s last name (Collin County Genealogical Society 2002). The
survey also lists a Minnie Sonntag who was apparently born February 28, 1883, but only
survived 3½ months. Written narratives of the Sonntag family history mention a
daughter, Minnie, who died. One states that she died in infancy (Anonymous n.d.), while
another claims she died at 15 (Sonntag 1976). The latter seems unlikely because the
Sonntags had only lived on the property since 1877 and, at the time, had only four sons.
Her age might have been possibly confused with that of her brother Alfred Benjamin (or
Benjamin, according to the narratives), who according to the death date died at 16,
although one account states that he died at 15 (Anonymous n.d.). Assuming the 1883
death date is correct; Minnie may have been the first interment in the family graveyard.
No mention has ever been made of a gravestone in the family cemetery bearing her name
or that she was in fact buried there, although the latter would seem a logical inference.
Fredriech Sonntag died in Mexico in 1915, and all accounts suggest that he was buried
there because no mention is made of his body having been moved back to Frisco
(Anonymous n.d; Sonntag 1976.). Also, given that Augusta Sonntag reported to her
family the unstable social/political environment shortly after the death of her husband,
she might not have been able to send the body home. Furthermore, had she been able to,
she probably would have taken advantage of the opportunity to leave as well. Therefore,
any marker for Fredriech Sonntag is most likely a memorial with no associated grave.
An additional possible burial is that of Ireba Kelsay, an infant with no relation to the
Sonntags, who died at birth in 1902 while the family was living on the Sonntag property
(Benjamin Beckelman, personal communication 2007). If she was, in fact, interred in the
cemetery, she could have been either the first or second interment, depending on whether
Minnie Sonntag was buried in the cemetery. It, however, seems unlikely that a family
would first donate land for the burial of a nonrelative and later establish their own family
cemetery in the same area.
It is uncertain why the Sonntag Cemetery ceased to be used. Possibilities include family
members moving elsewhere, greater convenience using a local community cemetery, and
changes in the funerary industry and burial practices. Another practical reason is to be
considered. During the investigations, archeologists quickly discovered that a layer of
limestone bedrock occurred not too far below the ground surface, and that it was
necessary to cut or chip through the bedrock to accommodate the graves. The family
burial ground may have simply been abandoned in favor of an area that did not require
such a tremendous effort.

GENERAL MORTUARY TRENDS OF THE LATE 1800S AND
EARLY 1900S
Prior to discussion of the burials and their contents, a brief summary of mortuary trends is
presented, as an understanding of them provides aids both in estimating the dates of
individual interments and in comprehending how these individuals both reflect and were
reflected by their culture.
During the nineteenth century in the United States, an interrelated series of changes in
technology and ideology was under way. The technological result was the mass
production of items and improvements in their marketing and transportation.
Ideologically, Romanticism was adopted into many aspects of American life, including
death—referred to as the “beautification of death” movement (Bell 1990). By the 1850s,
American attitudes regarding death and burial began to change from that of gloom and
formality to one that favored beauty and expressiveness. This change is reflected in the
emergence of the mortuary industry and corresponding tremendous increase in varieties
and elaborateness of burial receptacles and trimmings (Habenstein and Lamers 1995).
BURIAL CONTAINERS
During the latter half of the nineteenth century, the rectangular casket (a term originally
used for a jewelry box) began to replace the traditional hexagonal coffin in popularity.
The appearance of the coffin, which simulated the human outline, grew distasteful to
many because of the morbid image it conveyed. An 1849 advertisement for Boston
undertaker William Cooley that offered “Coffins, caskets, and robes of every description
. . .” is the earliest known appearance in the United States of the casket as an alternative
type of burial container. Yet, it was not until the period of 1858–1862 when Crane,
Breed & Co. began to offer the straight-sided casket on a mass-produced basis
(Habenstein and Lamers 1995:169). According to Lang (1984:46), the coffin became
obsolete by 1927. This change in burial receptacle shape is temporally significant
primarily for larger, typically adult-sized, burial receptacles. Infants and small children
were buried in rectangular containers much earlier (Davidson 2000), although burial of
these smaller individuals in hexagonal coffins likely persisted into the twentieth century
in some areas due to factors including affordability, availability, and, whether due to
personal preference or local custom, adherence to more traditional burial practices.
Nonetheless, by the last decades of the 1800s, more variety in color and casket materials
(including wood, glass, and metal) became available for both child and adult burial
containers (Habenstein and Lamers 1995).
During the nineteenth century, it was also a common burial practice to have some type of
separation of the body and burial receptacle from the immediate grave environment
(Habenstein and Lamers 1995). An earlier method consisted of digging a hole
approximately the size of the burial container into the bottom of a larger grave shaft,

placing the coffin or casket in the smaller hole, and covering it by laying boards, slabs of
sandstone, or any other available resource across the opening (Condon et al. 1998; Craig
and Larsen 1993; Davidson 2000; Fox 1984). By the latter half of the century, the burial
receptacle was often placed in a wooden exterior container, which was a precursor to the
metal and concrete burial liners used today. Initially, the outer box was merely the
shipping box for the coffin or casket, and it was buried with the inner container as a
means of disposal. However, finer, more visually appealing wooden outer boxes to
protect the coffin or casket from both the burial environment and would-be grave robbers
were manufactured and sold by the late 1870s or early 1880s (Habenstein and Lamers
1995).

VIEWING WINDOWS
During the second half of the nineteenth century and into the early twentieth century, it
was possible to obtain a burial receptacle with a glass window in the lid that allowed
viewing of the deceased, often the head and shoulders area, with the lid closed. This
more expensive option (Blakely and Beck 1982) likely was a result of the “beautification
of death” movement of the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in which the deceased
individual became the focus of the funeral ritual. Also, prior to 1880, embalming,
particularly injected, chemical embalming, was not commonly practiced in the United
States, and it was not until the 1920s that deceased individuals were routinely embalmed
(Habenstein and Lamers 1995; Iserson 1994). Therefore, in order to view the body
without the unpleasant odor of decomposition, a window in the coffin or casket lid would
be advantageous. The introduction date for viewing windows is uncertain, although a
viewing window from a marked burial from the Brunson-Sisson Cemetery (1836–1892)
in northern Illinois with an 1857 date of death (Cobb 1999) indicates that these windows
were available somewhat prior to this time.

HANDLES
Handles on burial containers became more common in the United States after 1850 when
coffin trimmings began to be mass-produced and thus became more affordable to the
general populace. During this time, the swing-bail handle, composed of a metal handle
(the bail) inserted into one or two lugs that attached to the side of the burial container,
was commonly used. The swing-bail handle began to be replaced in popularity by the
short-bar handle between 1880 and 1890. The short-bar handle consisted of two lugs
with arms, through which a wooden or metal dowel handle was inserted. Metal pieces,
usually ornamental, capped the ends of the bar. Although available as early as 1877,
extension bar handles, in which a rail handle extended along the entire side of the casket,
did not become popular until around 1912 (Hacker-Norton and Trinkley 1984). These
are still commonly used on modern caskets.

CAPLIFTERS
Caplifters are implements, often knob-like in appearance, that were used for lifting
sections of a coffin or casket or the viewing window cover. The earliest appearance of
these implements in a catalogue is 1877, and they seem to have disappeared by the midtwentieth century (Hacker-Norton and Trinkley 1984).
LID CLOSURES
During the early half of the nineteenth century, coffin lids were typically secured with
nails or screws, and for those who could afford them, coffin screws specifically designed
for the purpose (Davidson 2000:238). These screws consisted of a slotted, knob-shaped,
cast white metal head attached to an iron shank. The head could be plain or decorated
along the perimeter with a filigree design (Hacker-Norton and Trinkley 1984). Likewise,
the head could be silver-plated or plain. Although it is known that they were
manufactured and sold as early as 1853, it is likely that they were produced for some time
prior to this date (Davidson 2000:238). At that time, dummy screws, which consisted of
the same slotted, white metal heads attached to a tack rather than a screw, were used both
to create the illusion of additional coffin screws and as ornaments in their own right
(Davidson 2000; Hacker-Norton and Trinkley 1984). Although offered by wholesalers
and more regional companies up to the turn of the twentieth century, the coffin screw was
gradually replaced by the thumbscrew in most areas between the 1870s and early 1880s
and was being dropped from mainstream catalogs by this time. Davidson (2000) has
identified three phases in the evolution of the thumbscrew in which it changes from
closely resembling a coffin screw to a knob-like, urn-shaped fastener, and, finally, to the
broad, flat-bodied form that became the typical type. This latter form first appeared in
catalogues in 1875 and was manufactured into the 1960s (Davidson 2000; Hacker-Norton
and Trinkley 1984).

PLAQUES AND ORNAMENTATION
Decorative metal studs made of thin metal, often stamped with an elaborate design,
provided inexpensive ornamentation for a burial receptacle. Studs were offered in
catalogues from the 1870s to the 1920s, although as early as 1888 such items were
advertised as examples of “relics” and other advertisements applied a cheap and oldfashioned connotation to them (Hacker-Norton and Trinkley 1984:47). It is uncertain
whether these advertisements actually reflect waning popularity of decorative studs or if
they were merely ploys by hardware manufacturers to lure customers into buying more
expensive items.
Plaques and other metal ornaments secured on caskets and coffins, often on the lid over
the chest or pelvic area, were also not uncommon during the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries. These ornaments could be manufactured from either cast metal or
from less durable, and less expensive, stamped metal. Plates could be custom engraved

at extra cost, but many bore manufactured inscriptions such as “Mother” or “At Rest”
(Hacker-Norton and Trinkley 1984).
NAILS
During the last few decades of the nineteenth century, the wire nail slowly replaced the
machine-cut nail as the preferred type of construction fastener. Wire nails were first
manufactured in France in the early nineteenth century and were being made by hand in
the United States as early as the 1850s (Fontana and Greenleaf 1962:55; Nelson 1968).
In 1879, the H. P. Nail Company of Cleveland, Ohio, began to successfully manufacture
wire nails from Bessemer steel wire (Fontana and Greenleaf 1962:47). Wire nails
became popular in the construction industry in the United States by the 1890s when they
became relatively inexpensive (Nelson 1968) and had become the predominant type by
1900 (Wells 1998). When exactly manufacturers switched from using machine-cut nails
to wire nails in the construction of coffins and caskets is less clear, although recent
archeological investigations (e.g., Davidson 2000, 2006; Garrow and Symes 1987)
suggest that wire nails were introduced into the mortuary industry in the 1890s—and
most likely the later half of that decade—but did not completely replace cut nails until

METHODOLOGY
The investigation began when the existing Lebanon Road pavement and median were
removed by heavy equipment. This process took several days and resulted in the crude
exposure of areas where shallow deposits of topsoil were present overlying the limestone
bedrock. No evidence of graves, grave shafts, fences or tree lines was uncovered during
this process. The next step was the systematic removal of thin 2-3” thick lifts of topsoil
and decomposing limestone bedrock. This was begun with a D4C Caterpillar bulldozer
but was concluded using a road grader provided by the Zachry Company. In this process,
which was extended easterly from the western access road to the eastern access road, the
upper surface of the underlying limestone was exposed. Ultimately a relatively small
grave shaft stain was located and was designated as Burial 1 (Figure 3). At the same time,
a disturbed area was located just to the south and was judged to be where the graves and
gravestones had been before they were removed by the Sonntag family. A single broken
piece of an unmarked marble slab was recovered from this disturbed area.

On the adjacent cleared limestone plane, the holes and bases of three fence posts were
found in an east-west row west of Burial 2. It is possible that this fence row represents the
property line that is shown as intersecting the center of the western edge of Sonntag
Cemetery as shown on the Hebron, Texas 7.5’ USGS map. The abandoned water line was
apparently placed outside the western edge of the cemetery and the eastern section of the
line may have been outside the northwest corner of the cemetery. The presence of the
several power pole bases shown on the map as being within the apparent limits of the
cemetery are unexplained. The meaning of their apparent pairing is unexplained but it is
possible that they were all installed after the cemetery was abandoned and thus their
placement had no direct bearing on the cemetery.
While Burial 1 was being excavated by Ms. Tiné, a ten foot long north-south oriented
backhoe trench was placed in the center of the disturbed area and it confirmed that a hole
had been excavated into the bedrock and had been filled with an upper zone of black
(10YR2/1) rocky clay that dipped as deep as two feet in places and rested on a layer of
dark yellowish brown (10YR4/4) mottled clay fill that was slightly more than a foot
thick. This rested on a thinner layer of brownish yellow (10YR6/8) fill composed of sand,
clay, and limestone fragments. The trench extended to a depth of more than four feet and
exposed bedrock in the south end at less than two feet. No evidence of headstones or of
other caskets was found in this area. Subsequently, the entire remaining disturbed area
was cleared of fill and backhoe teeth marks were discovered in the bedrock. These are
attributed to the use of a backhoe to remove the graves and headstones in the 1970s since
backhoes were not available in the early twentieth century and the marks were not left by
the backhoe that we were using.
Troweling the west wall profile at the north end of the trench resulted in the discovery of
an unexpected dart brown stain that was determined to be the edge of another wooden
coffin (Burial 2). The trench had been ended just outside what turned out to be the
southern side of a casket that had not been removed when the cemetery was abandoned.
On the suspicion that the wood might represent the container of a second burial, both
investigators examined the area first by hand-troweling the walls around the wood but
eventually brought in a backhoe to dig a second trench perpendicular to the first above
the wood observed in the wall. Gradual exposure through backhoe excavation and shovel
and trowel skimming of the area defined the lid of a wooden receptacle of a much larger,
adult-size burial. When bone from the skull and a femur was exposed, it was clear that
the burial was intact and represented a burial that had been missed during the original
removal and relocation of the graves. Between September 14 and 16, 2006, the two
burials were exposed, documented, and removed.

BURIAL REMOVAL
Excavation of both burials followed a similar protocol in that both were photodocumented in black-and-white film and color digital formats, and data were in detailed
field notes and on a standardized burial excavation form. Information collected on the

burial form included soil color and consistency; burial orientation; below-surface depth
of the burial container measured from a datum; dimensions of the burial shaft and
container; container shape and material; presence and location of associated artifacts;
disposition, condition, and position of the skeletal remains; and any other noteworthy
features (e.g., presence and color of paint on the burial container). A sketch of the burial
container and, when applicable, skeleton was included on each burial form to
demonstrate skeletal position, artifact location, and disturbances, and to provide other
pertinent descriptive and provenience information. Over a meter of soil had been
removed from the area where the burials were identified, and a datum was positioned
near each burial at the highest possible point to establish vertical control of the burials.
Consequently, all vertical measurements—measured with a string, line level, and metric
tape or ruler—were recorded as centimeters (cm) below datum (bd). Depth of the datum
below grade was visually estimated with the aid of a metric ruler.
Despite these similarities, removal methodology for the two burials differed in several
ways due to the differences in the sizes of the burials, observed preservation quality, and
time restrictions. Burial 1 was initially indicated by a small (124 cm east-west by 69 cm
north-south), dark gray rectangular stain in a white silty clay subsoil. When the
excavation began, it was thought to be the only burial within the area. Because of the
size of the burial, soil conditions, and known delicateness of infant skeletal remains,
excavations were conducted with extreme care. In most instances when historic burials
are involved, it is possible to mechanically scrape away the burial fill with a backhoe or
gradall until the top of the burial case is encountered, at which point excavation by hand
commences. However, because this interred individual possibly represented a stillbirth, it
was uncertain whether a burial receptacle would have even been used and all excavation
was performed manually. It was decided to first determine the depth of the burial, which
had been estimated to extend no more than 50 cm deep based on probing the east end of
the shaft with a coring probe. However, it was uncertain whether the compactness of the
soil prevented the probe from extending deeper or if a change in the consistency of the
soil indicated the bottom of the grave. Trenches were hand-excavated along the south
side and west end of the burial shaft stain. Because of the compactness of the soil and
underlying limestone bedrock, it was necessary to chop through the soil with a mattock
and remove the loosened overburden with a shovel. Although a backhoe would have
been faster, it was feared that it would tear out most of the burial because of the small
burial size and the soil compactness.
Wood was encountered in the south side of the burial shaft at 42 cm bd and, because
several cm of limestone bedrock had already been cut through, the wood was interpreted
as representing the bottom of the burial container. The burial was divided into four
quarters, and starting with the southwest quarter, the western quadrants were excavated
by hand, and the contents were placed in bags labeled according to level and quadrant to
be later water-screened at a GMI facility. The upper half of each quadrant was shovel
skimmed; however, the bottom half, which was thought to represent burial fill, was handtroweled, although no signs of human remains were observed. After the western half was
excavated to the wood, represented by planks perpendicular to the long axis of the grave,
part of a smaller rectangular depression was observed within the wood covering. It was
______________________________________________________________________________________

SONNTAG FAMILY CEMETERY ARCHAEOLOGY

13

clear that the wood thought to have represented the bottom of a burial receptacle in which
the sides either had collapsed inward or disintegrated in the acidic soils was, in fact,
either the top of a vaulted burial or the lid of an outer box. The overburden of the east
half was removed more expeditiously with a mattocks and shovel. The 10 cm directly
above the wood, however, was removed by quadrant with a trowel and bagged for further
screening. When the wooden boards were fully exposed, a 102-x-58-cm depression was
evident in the center, and into which several of the boards had collapsed. This smaller
depression was also hand-troweled by quadrant and bagged by level and quadrant. At 65
cm bd, the outline of a wooden hexagonal coffin was encountered. Due to the small size
of the coffin (67 cm long by 18 cm at its widest point), the contents were hand-excavated
by western and eastern halves. Although nails and an ornamental tack were observed and
collected, no indication of human remains was observed. However, based on results of
previous excavations of subadult burials, the fill from each half was collected and bagged
so the contents could be water-screened in the hopes that bone fragments or developing
tooth crowns would be recovered. The bottom of the burial (at 77 cm bd) was obvious
when the bedrock floor was encountered.
Burial 2 was identified in the north end of a backhoe trench that had been excavated in a
disturbed area roughly 3 m south of Burial 1. The disturbance was interpreted as the
former location of the Sonntag family burials that had been relocated in 1974, and a
backhoe trench was excavated across the disturbance along the north-south axis to
confirm the hypothesis. Old marks made by a backhoe bucket were observed on the
surface of a limestone shelf in the more recent trench, and these indicated that the area
had been previously excavated, most likely to remove one or more burials. Nevertheless,
wood was observed in the wall at the north end of the trench, and an additional burial was
suspected. A second trench was slowly excavated perpendicular to the first directly north
of the end of the first trench, and the lid of a wooden adult-size burial container was
encountered at 77 cm bd. Exposure of the cranium and femora indicated a complete, insitu burial—apparently overlooked when the burials where removed and relocated in the
1970s—rather than the empty casket of an individual who had been removed. A datum
was established to the northwest of the second trench.
Unlike Burial 1, excavation of Burial 2 followed a more typical recovery protocol. Once
the lid of the burial container was exposed, mechanical activities ceased and exposure
proceeded by hand—first by shoveling the overburden off the burial container to fully
uncover it, then using a trowel and other small hand tools to expose the skeleton and any
associated artifacts. While the hand excavation was taking place, surveyors from Halff
Associates were able to map the grave, portions of the skeleton, and several burial
artifacts with a total station. When the skeleton was completely exposed, it was
photographed, and a scaled drawing was made of the burial that demonstrated skeletal
position and location of artifacts, as well as any disturbances or other pertinent
descriptive information.
Most of the skull and long bones could be removed individually. Many skeletal
elements, however, were friable and difficult to remove without breaking or totally
disintegrating. Most of the vertebrae, ribs, and bones from pelvis, hands, and feet were

extremely deteriorated. In addition to the poor preservation of these elements, heavy
rains had been forecasted, and the excavation had to be accelerated to a less than ideal
pace. Consequently, a method similar to the one used by the Arkansas Archeological
Survey at the Cedar Grove Cemetery (Rose 1985) was employed. The burial was divided
into five excavation zones consisting of the cranial area, upper right and left, and lower
right and left. Upper and lower were defined as being superior or inferior, respectively,
to the superior-most portion of the pelvis. The more delicate and poorly preserved
skeletal elements were removed with the surrounding soil matrix and were bagged and
labeled according to excavation zone. Artifacts were also collected and labeled by zone;
however, the larger, more intact bones were bagged individually and labeled according to
anatomical location (e.g., left femur). Once the skeleton and artifacts had been removed,
the sides and bottom of the burial were scraped and the fill was collected and labeled
according to excavation zone.

BIOARCHAEOLOGICAL EXAMINATION
Following their removal, the remains and associations were processed at the Geo-Marine
laboratory. Bagged burial fill was water-screened to locate small artifacts and human
remains (e.g., teeth and bone fragments) that may have been overlooked in the field, and
larger skeletal elements and artifacts were cleaned to permit detailed observations.
Bioarcheological studies consisted of a thorough osteological examination of the human
remains, an analysis of the funerary hardware and other grave goods, and a photographic
record of the remains and grave goods.

SKELETAL ANALYSIS
Skeletal analyses followed the guidelines established in Standards for Data Collection
from Human Skeletal Remains (Buikstra and Ubelaker 1994). Osteological observations
included inventory of skeletal elements, sex assessment, age estimation, skeletal metrics,
and pathological observations. Inventory was recorded in numerical code according to
the completeness of the bone or portion of the bone. Sex was estimated osteologically
only for individuals past the onset of puberty because most skeletal features (particularly
those that preserve well) that distinguish males from females do not manifest on the
skeleton until this time. Adult sex is typically determined on the basis sexually
dimorphic differences in pelvic and cranial morphology and skeletal robusticity (see
discussions in Angel 1969; Bass 1995; Krogman and Iscan 1986; Stewart 1979; Ubelaker
1989).
Metrical indicators of sex are generally utilized as a supplement to the morphological
indicators. Although they offer the advantage of providing quantifiable data,
measurements are generally less reliable indicators of sex than pelvic morphology
because they are not directly related to reproductive functioning (i.e., women typically
have wider hips to facilitate childbirth), the primary criterion for sex distinction in the
field of biology and in most cultures. Also, sex differences in size and robusticity are
population specific. Poor skeletal preservation of the Sonntag Cemetery remains limited
metrical analysis to univariate discriminant functions, in this case circumference of the
femoral midshaft (Black 1978; DeBennardo and Taylor 1979) and circumference of the
tibia at the nutrient foramen (Symes and Jantz 1983).
Both burials consisted of pre-adult individuals who had not attained complete skeletal
maturity or full dental development and eruption. Therefore, ages were derived from
stages of dental development and eruption (Anderson et al. 1976; Fanning and Brown
1970; Haavikko 1970; Liversridge et al. 1993; Moorrees et al. 1963; Shour and Massler
1941; Ubelaker 1989) and epiphyseal union (Bass 1995; Brothwell 1981).
Skeletal measurements were taken in accordance with guidelines established by MooreJansen and Jantz (1989). Pathological observations were recorded in numerical code and
were described in narrative form. When possible, ethnicity was assessed from

morphological observations of the facial bones (see Bass 1995; Krogman and Iscan 1986;
Rhine 1990; Stewart 1979; Ubelaker 1989), dentition (Rhine 1990), and femora (Stewart
1979).
Dental data were also collected according to the guidelines of the Standards. Most data
were collected through gross observation, although a 10x hand lens was utilized when
necessary.
Dental inventory, including premortem and postmortem tooth loss;
development/eruption; location and degree of calculus deposits; presence and location of
all observable caries and abscesses; degree of attrition; and the presence of enamel
hypoplasias were documented both numerically and visually.
All pathological and anomalous dental and skeletal conditions were digitally
photographed as were all skeletal features diagnostic of age or sex. Occlusal and
buccal/labial views of the dentition were routinely photographed as well as diagnostic
mortuary and personal artifacts. All images were recorded digitally.
ANALYSIS OF ARTIFACTS
After being processed in the Geo-Marine laboratory, the artifacts found in association
with the remains were examined and documented. The analysis included identifying and
recording basic information about each item (material; function; style/design; and, when
possible, date of manufacture or introduction to the marketplace) and photographic
documentation.
CURATION OF MATERIALS
The remains will be remanded to interested descendent for reburial. All artifacts
collected were associated with graves and will be reinterred with the associated remains.
All field and laboratory records and maps have been prepared for curation, including the
placement of these items in archival quality containers. Field notes, burial forms,
photographs, and other data gathered during these investigations will be curated at Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin.

BURIAL DESCRIPTIONS

The following chapter presents the descriptive information for each burial. Included are
details about burial depth, orientation, and body position; an inventory of artifacts; an
osteological inventory; demographic and pathological information; a dental inventory;
and data for dental pathology.
BURIAL 1
Burial 1 consisted of the coffined remains of an infant. The burial was oriented east to
west and was identified by a dark gray stain 124 cm east-west by 69 cm north-south
(Figure 4). Wood was first encountered at 42 cm bd (datum estimated at 108 cm below
grade) and consisted of a series of planks oriented perpendicular to the long axis of the
grave (Figure 5). Two machine-cut nails were also collected at this level. A layer of
limestone bedrock was observed in the walls surrounding the grave shaft, and it was
evident that the gravediggers had to cut through the limestone in order to get the burial to
a sufficient depth. A smaller, rectangular depression measuring 84 cm east-west by 30
cm north-south was present in the center of the boards, and excavation of the depression
indicated that the boards had collapsed into the depression (Figure 6). The wooden
outline of a hexagonal coffin was encountered at 65 cm bd (Figure 7), and the bottom of
the grave, indicated by limestone bedrock, occurred at 77 cm bd. The head board and
shoulders had a rounded appearance and possibly represent a kerfed coffin, in which the
sideboards are scored at the shoulders and bent to produce the hexagonal outline.
However, preservation of the wood was extremely poor, and no scores were observed
that would confirm whether the coffin was kerfed or if the burial environment had simply
distorted the outline. No paint or other external treatment was visible, and no coffin lid
was encountered. The coffin measured 67 cm long, and the widest point extended 18 cm
at the shoulder. The head board was approximately 11 cm wide, and the foot board was
12 cm wide. No human remains were observed during the excavation, although several
machine-cut nails, tacks, and an ornamental tack that mimics the appearance of a coffin
screw were observed. Fill from the coffin was water-screened, as was the fill between
the coffin and upper level of wood, and the approximately 10 cm above the wood.

No personal artifacts were recovered and the coffin hardware was relatively simple.
Ornamental hardware consisted of at least one coffin screw with a domed white metal
(lead alloy) head (Figure e). Four decorative white metal tacks, or dummy screws, were
also recovered. Like the coffin screw, these tacks have a slot in the head. The dummy
screws from this particular burial differ from the actual recovered coffin screw in that
they are flanged at the base of the head. Two iron screw shanks were recovered.
However, the head ends are corroded and it is difficult to determine if they represent
coffin screws missing the decorative heads or if they are utilitarian screws used to secure
the lid but were covered with the dummy screws to create the illusion of additional coffin
screws. At least 119 small, machine-cut iron tacks (Figure f) were recovered from the
burial fill. These tacks indicate that the interior of the coffin had been lined. At least 53
machine-cut nails represented by both whole nails and nail fragments (Figure g), were
collected and were likely used to construct the coffin. Several thin fragments of iron
were also observed, two of which are rounded and demonstrate projections that are
possibly the remnants of nails or tacks (Figure h). Their function is unknown, although
they appear similar to a piece of hardware described by Davidson (2006) that was
frequently used in coffin construction to secure the sides to the head and foot boards. In
addition to the coffin and associated hardware, several bones and teeth of a small rodent
were recovered from the water-screened burial fill. No doubt, the skeleton represents an
animal that burrowed into the burial and later died.

Human bone was recovered from the coffin fill, although it typically was in poor
condition. Recovered human remains consisted of small portions of the squamosal,
lateral, and basilar portions of the occipital; the petrous portions of both temporals;
several small fragments of cranial bone; neural arches of the first and second cervical
vertebrae; two left cervical neural arch fragments; one left neural arch fragment from a
cervical or thoracic vertebra; five right thoracic neural arch halves; four left thoracic
neural arch halves; one left lumbar neural arch half; 17 miscellaneous neural arch
fragments; portions of the left and right first ribs; right eleventh rib; portions of five left
and two right ribs; 11 unsided rib fragments; approximately two-thirds of both femoral
shafts; and several small long bone, postcranial, and miscellaneous bone fragments. The
developing crowns of four deciduous teeth were also recovered and consisted of the
mandibular central incisors, the right maxillary first molar, and the left mandibular first
molar. Absence of fusion of the vertebral neural arches indicated that the individual was
under three years of age (Bass 1995), and extent of dental development demonstrated a
maximum age range of birth to six months, with a central tendency toward the birth-tofour-month range (Liversridge et al. 1993; Moorress et al. 1963; Schour and Massler
1941; Ubelaker 1989). Sex could not be ascertained because of the young age of the
individual, and no pathological conditions were observed. The petrous portions of the
temporals and basilar portion of the occipital were porous, and plaque-like woven bone
was observed on the exterior surface of a parietal fragment near the squamosal suture.
However, these manifestations appear to be more indicative of developing bone rather
than a chronic infection.
With regard to biological affinity, determination for young children, particularly infants,
is a difficult undertaking even when the skeleton is complete and well preserved. Burial
1 is in too poor condition to even attempt such an assessment. However, both the
Sonntag and Kelsay families were of European origin, and this individual most likely
belongs to one of these families.
BURIAL 2
Burial 2 consists of the remains of an adolescent who was most likely male. The burial
was first identified in the wall of the north end of a trench excavated in a disturbed area
(Figure 3) believed to represent the original burial location of Sonntag family members
who were exhumed and relocated in 1974. The burial consisted of a rectangular wooden
casket approximately 209 cm long by 50 cm wide inside a 214-cm-long-x-61-cm-wide
rectangular wooden outer box. The burial was oriented east-west, with the head at the
west end. The top of the outer box was encountered at 77 cm bd (datum estimated at 100
cm below grade), and the burial extends to 104 cm bd where a limestone bedrock floor
was encountered. A limestone shelf surrounds the grave (Figures 11, 12, and 15) and
indicates that this layer had to be cut or chopped through to attain a satisfactory depth for
the grave. Depth of the top of the limestone shelf varies from 49 cm bd to 63 cm bd.

Three iron single-lug handles (Figure 16) and five large iron fan-shaped thumbscrews
(Figure 17) associated with the outer box were recovered. Evidently, the fourth and
handle and sixth thumbscrew were too deeply embedded in the wall of the grave shaft to
be observed or recovered. Fragments of wood from the casket demonstrate white paint
over red primer, and 17 small, domed, white metal tack heads (Figure 18) indicate that
the interior of the casket had been lined. A larger, domed tack head of a cuprous material
was identified on a piece of wood, although its location relative to the grave is uncertain.
Several fragments of glass (Figures 13-14) of varying size were recovered from the head
and chest area and indicate the presence of a viewing window in the lid of the casket. It
was difficult to ascertain the shape of the window in the field, and the high degree of
fragmentation rendered reconstruction in the lab extremely difficult. Nevertheless, the
window appears to have been ovoid or teardrop-shaped with the ends truncated and the
corners rounded or canted. Several small, flat pieces of iron (Figure 19) were located on
and near the viewing window and likely represent pieces of the latch apparatus for the
viewing window cover or the window itself. A caplifter (Figure 20) for the viewing
window cover was also recovered from the top of the glass. The caplifter is mushroomshaped with a pointed top, and curved lines along the sides of the cap create a spiraled
appearance. Several other pieces of ornamental casket hardware were recovered. A
white metal plate embossed with the words “REST IN PEACE” (Figure 21) was
recovered from the top of the casket near the abdominal region. Six matching sets of
white metal thumbscrews and escutcheons with a floral design (Figures 22 and 23) were
recovered, as were six swing bail casket handles (Figure 24). The handles have two lugs
with an acorn and oak leaf design. The bails of the handles have a rope-like appearance
with a drape design at the ends where the bail attaches to the lugs.

Utilitarian hardware consists of wire nails (Figure 25), screws, and fragments of
corrugated metal (Figure 26). Approximately 78 of the nails are 10d in size and were
more likely used to construct the outer box. Several are also bent at right angles.
Fragments from about 30 nails are finishing nails or common nails of a smaller penny
weight, and these were more likely used to construct the casket itself. At least 19 iron
screws are represented. One screw is intact and demonstrates a flattened head with a
Phillips slot. The remaining screws are represented by the distal tips. The screws may
have been used to attach the handles to the casket. The corrugated strips most likely
reinforced the corners of the casket.

Very few personal artifacts were recovered, and these consist primarily of pieces of about
six metal buttons (Figure 27) recovered from the torso and pelvic area. Based on their
composition and location, the buttons were likely attached to a jacket and a pair of
trousers. Several small pieces of flat and rounded metal were collected that might
represent parts of suspenders or other buckles; however, these are too fragmented and,
often, too corroded to permit positive identification.

Preservation of the skeletal remains was fair. The skull had been crushed by collapse of
the burial fill into the casket; however, most of the cranial vault was complete and the
individual bones could be cross-mended. The shafts of the larger long bones were
typically intact, although the articular surfaces rarely preserved. The ribs and vertebrae
were mostly present but were fragmented and incomplete. Skeletal inventory included
the following: complete frontal, parietals, occipital, temporals, and zygomatics; less than
25 percent of the sphenoid; 25–50 percent of the maxillae and mandible; left clavicle; 50
percent of the right clavicle; 50 percent of the scapulae; left patella; less than 25 percent
of the ilia; all cervical vertebrae; fragments of 10 thoracic vertebral centra; fragments of
10 thoracic neural arches; fragments of four lumbar neural arches; less than 25 percent of
the sternal body and manubrium; 50 percent of the left second rib and right eleventh rib;
left twelfth rib; fragments of eight left and seven right ribs; 50–75 percent of the left

proximal two-thirds of the left ulnar diaphysis, missing the olecrannon process and 75
percent of the semi-lunar notch; proximal one-third of the right ulnar diaphysis, missing
the olecrannon process and semi-lunar notch; left lunate and navicular of the hand; four
unsided metacarpal shaft fragments; fragments of eight proximal or middle hand
phalanges; over 75 percent of the left femoral diaphysis; 50–75 percent of the right
femoral diaphysis; less than 25 percent of the left and right distal femoral epiphyses; 50
percent of the left proximal tibial epiphysis; less than 25 percent of the right proximal

Skeletal pathology consists of healing cribra orbitalia in the superior portions of the eye
orbits of the frontal. Well-healed pores were also evident on the occipital squamous and
near the lambdoidal suture of the posterior left parietal. No abnormal thickening was
observed on any of the cranial bones.
The complete permanent dentition was recovered for this individual. The third molars
have not completely formed and development ranges from completion of the crown to
initial root cleft formation. Most of the erupted teeth demonstrate mild to moderate
accumulations of dental calculus and dental caries were evident on five teeth. The right
mandibular first and second molars each exhibit a small carious lesion on the occlusal
surface, and two additional lesions occur on the buccal surface of the first molar. Large
cavities are present on the mesial surface of the left maxillary first molar and on the distal
surface of the right maxillary second premolar. The latter lesion likely spread from the
neighboring right maxillary first molar. Decay has destroyed the entire crown of this
tooth, leaving only the roots. The alveolar bone is too poorly preserved in this area to
determine whether the tooth abscessed. Sufficient amounts of alveolar bone are only
present for observation of the right maxillary I1–P2 and left mandibular P2–M3. No
abscesses were observed.
The developing third molars and several unfused skeletal epiphyses indicated that the
individual was an adolescent. The proximal epiphyses of the metatarsals are completely
fused and indicate that the individual was probably over 12 years old. However, all other
observable epiphyses are not fused and would indicate a maximum age of about 19 years
(Brothwell 1981). Age inferred from the development of the dentition was similar. The

34

roots of most of the third molars were only beginning to form when the individual died,
and the apices of the roots of the second molars had not yet closed. Dental aging
methods applied to this individual (Anderson et al. 1976; Fanning and Brown 1971;
Haavikko 1970; Schour and Massler 1941; Ubelaker 1989) produced an age range of 12–
18 years, with a central tendency of around 15 years.
Sex determination of adolescents is problematic. The primary elements of the pelvis may
not have yet fused, and other secondary sex characteristics, such as pronounced
development of the brow ridges in males, may not have manifested at the time the
individual died. The pelvis of Burial 2 did not preserve well and was of no use for sex
determination, and features of the skull often used for sex determination were sometimes
ambiguous. Development of the nuchal crest and external occipital protuberance is
somewhat rugged but not heavily developed. The glabellar region of the frontal did not
preserve, and the brow ridges are not well developed. The supraorbital margins of the
frontal are also ambiguous, being neither particularly sharp nor blunt, and although a
fragment of the mandible suggests that the mental eminence may be squared, it is broken
in such a way as to render this observation speculative. However, the mandibular angle
is more of a right angle than obtuse, as is more common in females, and mastoid
processes of the temporals are relatively large, a more commonly masculine characteristic
(Bass 1995; Krogman and Iscan 1986; Stewart 1979; Ubelaker 1989). The overall
skeleton is robust in size, even though most of the muscle attachment sites are not well
developed. The skeleton measured over 180 cm long. This translates to 70.87 inches or
about 5 feet and 11 inches—a height not unheard of for females but far less common than
for males. It should be remembered that the individual’s long bone epiphyses had not yet
fused; therefore, maximum height had not been attained at the time of death.
Circumferences of the femoral midshaft (94 millimeters) and the tibia at the nutrient
foramen (110 mm) were well within the range for males (Black 1978; DiBennardo and
Taylor 1979; Symes and Jantz 1983). Based on the above observations, a sex of probable
male was assigned to the individual.
The condition of the skull of Burial 2 precluded measurements that could be applied to
statistical formulae to assess biological ancestry, and the facial bones, which tend to be
the best morphological indicators of ethnicity, did not preserve well. However, the
femora demonstrated the anterior curvature more commonly observed in individuals not
of African ancestry (Stewart 1979). The small amount of maxilla recovered did not
demonstrate alveolar prognathism, also more common in individuals of African origin
(Bass 1995; Krogman and Iscan 1986; Rhine 1990; Stewart 1979; Ubelaker 1989), and
remnants of a nasal sill and developed nasal spine, more indicative of European ancestry,
were observed. The incisors also lacked the shoveled appearance often seen in
individuals of Asian descent. Though inconclusive, the few observable skeletal and
dental features are more consistent for a person of European ancestry.

INTERPRETATIONS

Due to the size of the skeletal sample at the Sonntag Cemetery, most interpretations will
focus on the two excavated individuals with only limited comparison to other local
contemporary burial samples.
While more ambitious investigations have been
undertaken by burial samples as small as three individuals (e.g., Tiné and Boyd 2003),
these samples were typically part of a much larger burial population, and supplementary
information, such as gravestone data from others interred in the cemetery, provided
additional insight into the larger population to which the disinterred individuals belonged.
Conversely, the Sonntag Cemetery only consisted of three or four individuals, who may
or may not have been representative of the local community. Interpretations are also
somewhat complicated by the present uncertainty of the identity of the individual interred
in Burial 1.
ARCHAEOLOGY
Of the two burials, Burial 2 is the most straight-forward to interpret. The burial consists
of a wooden casket and outside box. The casket, itself, possessed six handles, a set of six
thumbscrews and escutcheons, a plaque on the lid, and a viewing window. It also
demonstrated evidence of having had a lined interior and painted exterior. Overall, the
casket complex is what one would expect from an interment from the late 1800s or early
1900s when these styles of burial containers and associated hardware were popular. A
few mortuary associations, however, suggest that the interment took place after 1900. No
trade catalogues were readily available to identify the introduction date of the handles,
but the thumbscrew is identical to Thumbscrew Type 7 from the Freedman’s Cemetery
artifact assemblage. Freedman’s Cemetery in Dallas, Texas, is a burial ground that was
established by emancipated slaves and that served the local African American community
from 1869 to approximately 1907 (Condon et al. 1998; Peter et al. 2000). Through
examination of mortuary trade catalogues, Davidson (2000:385) identified 1901 as the
earliest known catalogue appearance for this style of thumbscrew. This is not to say that
the style was not available prior to this date, but its first observed presence in a catalogue
suggests that the early 1900s is when it first became accessible to a large market.
Materials employed in the construction of the casket complex are also of temporal
significance. The first patents for the corrugated fasteners recovered from Burial 2 date
as early as the 1880s. However, an actual machine to manufacture the devices was not
patented until 1890, and the fasteners do not appear in general hardware catalogues until
1900. The earliest known catalogue to offer the product provides a one-page layout with
a detailed description of the function of the item, suggesting that it was a fairly new
introduction into the market (Davidson 2006). The nails used to construct the casket and
outer box are exclusively wire nails. As discussed in a previous chapter, wire nails were
probably not widely used in the mortuary industry until the late 1890s, and probably not
exclusively until after 1900 (Davidson 2000, 2006). Again, it is possible that either of the

36

two fasteners discussed might have been utilized in the manufacture of burial containers
prior to 1900, but the general trend suggests common use did not occur until the early
twentieth century. Multiple examples of items that typically postdate 1900 associated
with Burial 2 further strengthen the argument for a post-1900 interment date.
The casket complex can also indicate the individual’s (or individual’s family’s) economic
resources, as well as his status within the family and community. The wide array of
casket accessories implies a certain amount of material investment in the burial. The
mortuary accouterments reflect styles that were popular, or at least common, at the turn
of the twentieth century, and the materials were of a durable quality. For example, the
escutcheons and plaque were made from cast white metal rather than less expensive
pressed tin. A comparison of price lists by Hacker-Norton and Trinkley (1984:36–37)
indicated that handles tend to be the most expensive accessories, and a full compliment of
six can account for well over half the total cost of accessories for a well-trimmed burial
container. The number, style, material, and finish can greatly influence the cost;
nevertheless, they still exceed the prices of other adornments. The handle type (swing
bail) for the Burial 2 casket was not the most expensive type available nor was the white
metal it was constructed of the most expensive material. Nevertheless, the bail and lugs
of the handles are decorated with elaborate designs, and the casket was adorned with the
traditional set of six handles rather than four.
The casket, itself, indicates a significant material investment. In another comparison of
mortuary catalogues and price lists, Davidson (2006:112–113) demonstrated waning
popularity of the coffin at the turn of the twentieth century by noting the price differential
between coffins and caskets. In the early 1880s, the price of a casket could cost 50–100
percent more than a coffin of identical size and material offered by the same
manufacturer, and by the 1900s, a casket typically cost at least twice as much as its
identical coffin counterpart. In the same study, Davidson (2006) also determined that the
presence of a viewing window and type of window significantly increases the price of the
container. It could not be determined whether the viewing window in Burial 2 was of the
static or more expensive sliding type. However, based on the type and style of burial
container and associated ornamental hardware, it can be inferred that the survivors of the
individual interred in Burial 2 were aware of and adhered to contemporary funerary
aesthetics, and had the means to furnish a burial for their loved one that reflected these
ideals.
Little can be said regarding the personal artifacts associated with Burial 2, primarily
because so few were recovered and these were limited to utilitarian, clothing-related
items. However, evidence exists that socio-economic status is not easy to infer based on
personal artifacts, particularly among smaller (<20 individuals) burial samples. Fifteen
turn-of-the-twentieth-century burials excavated from the Odd Fellows section of Pioneer
Cemetery in Dallas, Texas, indicated that even members of the middle and upper classes
were reluctant to bury valuable personal belongings. Recovered personal artifacts tended
to be mundane items such plain metal and porcelain buttons associated with the clothing
of adults, and safety pins and porcelain buttons associated with infants and young
children (Cooper et al. 2000). A comparison of the Pioneer Cemetery burials with 14

37

burials removed from a contemporary Dallas paupers’ cemetery revealed only subtle
differences in the personal artifact assemblages that might not be detected without prior
knowledge of the social classes of the two burial samples (Tiné et al. 2002).
No personal artifacts were recovered from Burial 1. The mortuary complex is almost the
opposite of Burial 2 and interpretation is confounded by possible temporal and socioeconomic factors. Burial 1, an infant, was interred in a hexagonal coffin. All nails and
tacks recovered from the burial were machine cut, and a slotted coffin screw and four
dummy tacks were also removed from the burial fill. Also, the small depression in the
center of the wood above the burial suggests that the burial had been vaulted, another
typically temporally earlier burial tradition. Fragments of two nails were recovered from
the top of the wood when it was encountered during excavation. These may indicate the
lid of an outside box; however, only two were recovered from this level, and they might
represent taphonomic processes. The bones of a rodent were recovered from the burial
fill, and a recently displaced live rat took up residence near the burial at the time of
excavation. Therefore, underground rodent activity could have displaced a few nails.
None of the nails or nail fragments recovered was bent or “clinched.” Davidson (2006)
notes that clinched nails are typical in the construction of an outer shipping crate and,
while the absence of such nails does not necessarily mean that an outer box was not used,
it strongly suggests the possibility.
Such a burial program is consistent with, but not necessarily indicative of, a pre-1890
interment. The older style coffin, coffin hardware, and vaulting practice could also
reflect limited economic resources. The coffin might have been locally made, hence the
absence of an outside shipping box, or perhaps purchased at a reduced price due to its
waning popularity by the turn of the twentieth century. Likewise, anachronistic hardware
could provide adornment at a lower cost. Factors including regional availability and
retention of older burial traditions must also be considered.
Although technological changes occurred in the late 1800s, particularly in the funerary
industry, typically these changes were not abrupt and the transition could last several
decades. For example, while caskets gradually replaced coffins, both were available and
used contemporaneously into the early 1900s (Davidson 2000; Habenstein and Lamers
1995).
White metal coffin screws and dummy screws were generally out of style by the 1880s.
By 1888 in Dallas, at least one of the city’s undertakers ceased to purchase coffin screws
in favor of the more popular thumbscrews (Davidson 2000:245). Also, at Freedman’s
Cemetery in Dallas, only three of the 1,049 burials that dated later than 1884 had coffin
screws and only five had dummy screws. However, the coffin screw burials and one of
the burials with dummy screws at Freedman’s occurred around the turn of the twentieth
century (Davidson 2000).
In more rural areas, the coffin screws and dummy screws might have been available to
local undertakers and sellers of mortuary hardware through regional catalogues, company
salesmen, or jobbers, who were wholesale dealers who purchased items in bulk (Hacker______________________________________________________________________________________

38

Norton and Trinkley 1984). Local undertakers or merchants might have also
accumulated a large back-stock of such items and offered them for sale for years after
they were no longer available from manufacturers. Two burials recovered from a
cemetery in McMullen County, Texas, during the Choke Canyon Reservoir investigations
contained white metal coffin screws (Fox 1984). The individual in one of the coffin
screw burials was identified with a strong degree of confidence, and he was known to
have died in 1894. Therefore, use of much older styles of mortuary hardware in remote
areas did occur. Indeed, this appears to have been one of the nicer burials in that his
coffin had an outside box, suggesting commercial manufacture, and 18 of the 20 burials
excavated contained no hardware other than nails.
Another example of retention of anachronistic hardware is the Hacker-Norton and
Trinkley (1984) study of nineteenth-century hardware. The examination is based
primarily on the A. L. Calhoun collection, which consists of a stock of mortuary
trimmings recovered from a general store in rural South Carolina that burned in 1926.
Although the proprietor re-built and continued to operate the store, he no longer sold the
funerary hardware salvaged from the fire on a regular basis. A few white metal coffin
screws, although no dummy screws, were present in the collection. Thus, although no
longer a common or popular item, these less expensive lid closures were available for
sale well into the 1920s in some areas.
The differences in the two burials, therefore, can be explained by a number of
possibilities. The first is that Burial 1 occurred significantly earlier than Burial 2.
Assuming that this is the case, the transition in burial programs might reflect changes in
the relative wealth of a single family or changes in tastes and availability of a wider
variety of mortuary items to the region.
A second possibility is that the opposing burial types might reflect status differences
associated with age. Among burials excavated from the Cedar Grove Cemetery, a rural
African American cemetery in southwest Arkansas dating to the turn of the twentieth
century, researchers observed a trend of little to no ornamental hardware and personal
items in child burials, particularly infants, whereas these were much more common in
adolescent and adult burials. The researchers hypothesize that the lack of material
investment in the subadult burials reflects a lack of emotional investment that is often
observed in cultures with high rates of infant mortality, such as the Cedar Grove burial
sample. It is not until the individual survives a critical age that he or she is afforded this
type of investment (Rose and Santeford 1985:135). Therefore, while Burial 1 died very
young, as did many people at that time, and was buried with minimal accouterments,
Burial 2 survived to an age that he was considered a full member of society. Although an
adolescent, he had likely assumed at least some of the duties and status of an adult and
was accordingly given a burial appropriate to that stature. While less relative material
investment is not uncommon among historic infant burials (e.g., Freedman’s and Pioneer
cemeteries in Dallas), the disparity between Burials 1 and 2 at the Sonntag Cemetery is
too great to be explained by age alone. If a family can afford the type of burial given
Burial 2, it seems rational that a baby would still be given a burial that, though perhaps
not as elaborate, still reflects the tastes and trends of the time. Consequently, the two
______________________________________________________________________________________

SONNTAG FAMILY CEMETERY ARCHAEOLOGY

39

interments are likely separated by a temporal gap in which a significant transition in
familial wealth, product availability, and/or social norms occurred. Otherwise, a final
explanation for the differences exists. The individuals interred in the two burials either
are not related or are only distantly so, and the immediate relatives differ demonstrably in
financial means and/or beliefs and traditions regarding treatment of the dead.
OSTEOLOGY
Both individuals removed from the Sonntag Cemetery died before reaching biological
adulthood. As such, they exemplify the hardships of life toward the turn of the twentieth
century. Examination of headstone, census, and osteological data for Collin and Dallas
counties indicates that infant mortality was a common phenomenon at this time. In
particular, the high proportion of infant burials observed through both headstone dates
and excavated skeletal remains at Pioneer Cemetery in Dallas demonstrates that not even
the more affluent classes were immune to this tragedy (Cooper et al. 2000). Regardless
of socio-economic status, Burial 1 from the Sonntag Cemetery, who survived at the most
no longer than a few months after birth, is highly representative of the times. No chronic
infection, injury, or obvious congenital conditions were observed on the few human
remains recovered from this burial, and cause of death could be any number of illnesses,
stresses, or mishaps.
Burial 2 demonstrates two types of pathological lesions. The first type discussed is
dental pathology and it manifests in three interrelated forms: carious lesions, abscesses,
and antemortem tooth loss. Though they do not represent a strict cause-and-effect
phenomenon, these disorders tend to be related in a progressive fashion and together
provide a comprehension of diet, oral hygiene, and dental trauma for a given population.
Dental caries is a process in which acid is produced by bacterial fermentation of
carbohydrates from the diet. This acid destroys the hard tissues of the tooth and forms a
cavity in the crown or root of the tooth (Hillson 1996; Larsen et al. 1991). Abscesses
result in the localized destruction of alveolar bone. Periodontal abscesses are the
consequence of infection outside the pulp cavity of the tooth (Ortner and Putchar 1981;
Ruben et al. 1970), whereas periapical abscesses are the result of infection and the
subsequent formation of pus in the root canal (Hillson 1996). The latter is associated
with destruction of the tooth and exposure of the pulp cavity through carious activity,
trauma, or rapid attrition. Tooth loss results from several causes: traumatic exfoliation;
intentional extraction; or destruction of the alveolar bone and/or surrounding soft tissues
(periodontal disease). This tissue destruction may be due to irritation or to certain
metabolic deficiencies such as scurvy (Ortner and Putschar 1981). Age is another factor
that affects periodontal bone loss, although it is not necessarily the primary cause
(Hillson 1996).
Dental pathology is indicative of poor oral hygiene, a diet rich in carbohydrates, the
absence of professional dental care, or any combination of these. The presence of
abscesses or unfilled caries in an individual indicates that the condition was not treated,
usually because of the lack of financial resources, the availability of a professional dentist
to the region, or the typical human avoidance of the dentist.

The dentition of Burial 2 demonstrates carious lesions on five teeth. The most severe
expression occurs at the right first maxillary molar where decay was apparently so
extensive that the entire crown was destroyed, leaving only the roots. The decay seems
to have spread to the adjacent distal surface of the right maxillary second premolar. The
missing crown might also represent an attempt to extract the tooth after the crown was
already weakened by extensive decay (as indicated by the carious lesion on the
neighboring premolar) and the crown simply broke from the roots, which, once exposed,
would have been subjected to carious processes. The associated alveolar bone did not
preserve sufficiently to determine if the tooth had abscessed, although it likely would
have, had the individual survived longer. No abscessing was observed on the few areas
of alveolar bone that had preserved. However, all 32 teeth were recovered, indicating
that no antemortem tooth loss had yet occurred.
Dental pathology was commonly observed among most contemporaneous historic
cemetery samples, particularly in the Dallas area, and Burial 2 appears to follow this
pattern. Though available, specific data for dental disease were not within the scope of
the Freedman’s Cemetery study (Tiné 2000); however, cursory observation indicated that
dental pathology was frequent and, often, extensive within the African American
community. Two of three observable dentitions from the middle to upper class white
Pioneer Cemetery sample indicated at least one carious lesion, and more than one tooth
was affected per dentition (Cooper et al. 2000). Four individuals had sufficient alveolar
bone to observe abscessing and antemortem tooth loss. One individual exhibited an
abscess, and all four indicated antemortem loss of at least one tooth. Three lost more
than one tooth. All four individuals were estimated to have been greater than 30 years of
age at the time of death, possibly explaining the high frequencies. A sample of white
paupers from turn-of-the-century Dallas also demonstrated high frequencies of dental
pathology, even among younger adults (Tiné et al. 2002). All eight observable adult
dentitions indicate multiple carious lesions. One of five individuals exhibited alveolar
abscesses, and six of seven dentitions exhibited antemortem tooth loss. Four had lost
more than one tooth prior to death.
Burial 2 did not possess any dental restorations, and professional dental care may have
been limited in, if not unavailable to, the Frisco area at the time. Dental restorations and
prosthetic devices, however, are not common in historic cemetery populations, regardless
of socio-economic status. Though a small sample, none was present among the Pioneer
Cemetery dentitions despite the presence of several dentists listed in the city directories
(Cooper et al. 2000). It is likely that much of the dental care at the time was limited to
extractions, and this would explain the frequency of antemortem tooth loss. It is also
possible that many chose to avoid the dentist.
The other pathological disorder observed on the skeleton of Burial 2 is a condition called
cribra orbitallia. Cribra orbitalia and porotic hyperostosis are similar conditions
characterized by cranial thickening and pitting, and they are frequently associated with
childhood anemia (Huss-Ashmore et al. 1982; Stuart-Macadam 1989, 1991). Factors that
contribute to iron-deficiency anemia include blood loss, diarrhea, inadequate absorption
______________________________________________________________________________________

41

of iron, increased demands for iron, and insufficient amounts of bioavailable iron in the
diet (Stuart-Macadam 1989). Symptoms include fatigue, weakness, headaches, and
various gastrointestinal disorders (Fairbanks and Beutler 1972; Stuart-Macadam 1989).
Furthermore, the individual is weakened immunologically (Baynes and Bothwell 1990;
Goodman 1994) and, therefore, is vulnerable to other debilitating conditions. In addition
to reduced endurance and compromised immunity, clinical studies have indicated that
cognitive abilities can be adversely affected (Baynes and Bothwell 1990; Goodman 1994;
Liebel et al. 1982). Baynes and Bothwell (1990:142) have noted that impaired
neurological functioning resulting from iron deficiency anemia in children is not entirely
reversible.
Only one individual from the six observable Pioneer Cemetery crania indicated a possible
instance of porotic hyperostosis, and neither of the two individuals with observable eye
orbits demonstrated cribra orbitalia (Cooper et al. 2000). No evidence of porotic
hyperostosis or cribra orbitalia was present among the white pauper sample, either (Tiné
et al. 2002). Without a larger skeletal sample from the area, it is not possible to
determine if the condition observed in Burial 2 is an isolated occurrence or if it reflects
the availability of certain food products or presence of certain illnesses unique to the
Frisco area. The condition, however, appeared to be healing, and no enamel hypoplasias
that would indicate chronic childhood metabolic stress were observed on the dentition.
Nevertheless, chronic anemia may have compromised the individual biologically, and left
him more vulnerable to pathogens or other environmental stressors that may have
resulted in his early death.

RECONSTRUCTION OF BURIAL IDENTITY
The history of the Sonntag family cemetery is cloudy at best. Little information is
available and some data are in conflict. Three names are listed for this cemetery in the
first volume of Collin County (Texas) Cemetery Inscriptions (Pitts et al. 1975): Fred
Herman Sonntag, Augusta Emily Sonntag, and Alfred Benjamin Sonntag. The only
available written sources (Anonymous n.d.; Sonntag 1976) indicate that Fred (or
Fredriech), the family patriarch, died in Mexico in 1915 and was buried there. Therefore,
any marker observed at the family graveyard was likely a memorial or cenotaph but no
body was present. No adult female was encountered during the present investigations,
and it appears that Augusta is the only individual who was moved to Bethel Cemetery in
1974, unless other unmarked individuals were also encountered and removed. The
skeleton in Burial 2 is most probably that of Alfred Benjamin. The no longer extant
grave marker indicated that he died in 1905 at the age of 16. The recovered skeleton
appears to be male and is of an adolescent who most likely was in his mid-teens. The
burial container and hardware are also consistent for a burial in the early 1900s.
The identity of Burial 1 is much more difficult to discern. Based on family oral history, a
family Bible, and a family genealogical compilation, Mr. Benjamin Beckelman, a Frisco
resident, believes the remains may belong to his maternal great aunt, Ireba Kelsay.
According to some of the family sources, she was interred in the Sonntag family
cemetery (Benjamin Beckelman, personal communication 2007). Ireba was born and
died on December 14, 1902, possibly stillborn. Presumably, the Kelsay family resided on
the Sonntag property and the two families were neighbors, and the Sonntags provided
property for the burial of the Kelsay infant.
Another possibility, however, is that the infant is Minnie Sonntag, one of Fredriech and
Augusta’s children. According to one account (Sonntag 1976), Minnie died at the age of
15. Another (Anonymous n.d.) states that she died in infancy. A 2002 survey of
gravestones in Bethel Cemetery (Collin County Genealogical Society 2002) lists an
inscription for Minnie Sonntag that states she was the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. F. H.
Sonntag. The listing provides a date of February 28, 1883, that is presumably her birth
date, because the date precedes the phrase “lived abt 3 ½ months.” Inscriptions for F. H.,
Mrs. F. H., and Alfred Benjamin are also listed, although Alfred Benjamin’s last name is
spelled “Sontag.” It is uncertain whether these names occur on individual markers or a
communal marker. It is also unknown whether any actual human remains are associated
with the markers. If Minnie died in 1883, she could not have been 15 years of age
because when the Sonntags settled five or six years previously in the Frisco area, then an
extension of Lebanon, Texas, they only had four sons (Sonntag 1976).
The age of the infant in Burial 1 is determined to be between birth and four months of
age, and this range would match either child. The coffin and associated hardware are
more consistent with a burial that predates 1900. Indeed, they are more common for
burials earlier than 1880 in most areas. Nevertheless, the Frisco post office was not

established until 1902, and the town was incorporated during the first decade of 1900
(Minor 2001a). Therefore, in the 1880s, the area that was to become Frisco may have
been more remote, and selection and availability of mortuary items may have been more
limited. Conversely, if the Kelsay family was living on Sonntag property, they might
have had modest economic resources that would have limited their choice of funerary
items to less expensive, out-of-style items. They may have also observed more
traditional burial practices. Also, Ireba’s father, John George Kelsay, was a carpenter
(Benjamin Beckelman, personal communication 2007) and he might have constructed the
coffin himself. A homemade coffin would explain the absence of an outside shipping
box. The North Texas Tollway Authority is currently investigating the feasibility of
DNA studies to attempt to resolve this question. Presently, the identity of Burial 1 cannot
be determined on the osteological and archeological data.

CONCLUSIONS
Although the Sonntag Cemetery was assumed to have been relocated over 30 years ago,
concerns of a local resident about an unknown grave resulted in the re-examination of the
area prior to a massive construction project. Only one possible burial was expected;
however, two were encountered, including one who was presumed to have been moved.
The situation certainly exemplifies the need for more thorough examination of a cemetery
to ensure that all burials have been located and exhumed before the cemetery dedication
is removed and the property can be legally used for purposes other than human burial.
Examination of the burials indicated that the two individuals interred in the graves
provided more examples of fragility of human life at the turn of the twentieth century,
particularly in an area that was in many ways still the frontier. One individual died at or
shortly after birth; the other never reached full adulthood and had suffered biological
stress. Both, however, were mourned and given respectful burials.
The investigations also demonstrated how a number of variables affect one’s
interpretation of available data. Because of adequate preservation, specific timediagnostic artifacts, and rudimentary understanding of the family and cemetery history,
the identity of Burial 2, the older individual, could be established with a reasonable
degree of confidence as Albert Benjamin (or simply Benjamin) Sonntag. Burial 1, the
infant, is much more complicated because the two possible matches are so close together
in age, and the mortuary materials are too ambiguous to establish a maximum or cut-off
date. Better preservation of the remains might have permitted identification of more agediagnostic elements to refine the age-at-death. The mortuary program, although it
appears to represent an earlier burial, can be explained by a number of factors including
economics, product availability, and personal beliefs and traditions. Although a
considerable amount of information was learned about the infant (approximate age range,
type of burial container used, type of hardware and ornamentation present), an identity
still cannot be established. DNA studies offer a possible solution, but that remains to be
determined. The outcome may prove to be ironic, in that in trying to protect the remains
of one individual, the remains of two others escaped the bulldozer. Regardless, because
of the interest and alertness of one individual, two burials that would have otherwise been
destroyed and nothing learned of them, have, even if in a small way, contributed to a
slowly growing pool of knowledge about North Texas history.
