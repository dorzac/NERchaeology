ABSTRACT

Enercon Services, Inc. (ENERCON), in support of Salt Creek Midstream, LLC, conducted an intensive
archeological survey for the proposed 4 Points Pipeline Project. The proposed pipeline is approximately
2.2 miles (3.5 km) in length, located near Pecos, Texas in Culberson and Reeves Counties. This report
encompasses one State of Texas Lands property administered by the Texas General Land Office (TGLO),
which includes approximately 1,200 feet (355 m) in Reeves County. The State of Texas Lands segment of
the project area is mapped on the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Derrick Draw, Tex. (1973) 7.5
minute quadrangle map. The construction corridor consists of a 50 foot (15 m) wide permanent pipeline
right-of-way (ROW) and a 50 foot (15 m) wide temporary workspace corridor. The cultural resources
survey corridor and area of potential effect (APE) was 100 foot (30 m) wide for the entire 1,200 foot (365
m) length of the pipeline segment through the State of Texas Lands, for a total of 2.75 acres (1.11 hectares).
The survey of the State of Texas Lands property was completed under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 9016.
The cultural resources field investigation of the 4 Points Pipeline Project on State of Texas Lands was
conducted on November 1, 2018 by ENERCON archeologist J. Matthew Oliver and Gary Edington, an
ENERCON archeologist who meets the U.S. Secretary of the Interior’s Professional Qualification
Standards for archeology as set forth in 36 CFR 61, and consisted of intensive pedestrian survey utilizing
transects spaced no greater than 15 m apart, with shovel tests in areas which had the potential for buried
cultural resources. The field investigation was conducted in accordance with the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) Archeological Survey Standards for Texas. The entire project was supervised by
Michael Margolis, an ENERCON archeologist who meets the U.S. Secretary of the Interior’s Professional
Qualification Standards for archeology as set forth in 36 CFR 61.
The cultural resources survey did not result in finding any historic or prehistoric artifacts, features, cultural
lenses, or sites over 50 years of age on State of Texas Lands. No archeological sites were encountered, and
no artifacts were collected. Therefore, it is recommended that the project will have no effect on any cultural
resources that may qualify for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on State of
Texas Lands. No further cultural resources investigations are recommended prior to the proposed
construction of the 4 Points Pipeline Project on State of Texas Lands. If cultural material, including sites,
features, or artifacts that are 50 years old or older are encountered within the ROW during construction of
this project, work in the area must cease and the Texas Historical Commission must be immediately
notified.

INTRODUCTION

Enercon Services, Inc. (ENERCON), in support of Salt Creek Midstream, LLC, conducted an intensive
archeological survey for the proposed 4 Points Pipeline Project. The proposed pipeline is approximately
2.2 miles (3.5 km) in length, located near Pecos, Texas in Culberson and Reeves Counties (Figure 1). This
report encompasses one State of Texas Lands property administered by the Texas General Land Office
(TGLO), which includes approximately 1,200 feet (355 m) in Reeves County. The State of Texas Lands
segment of the project area is mapped on the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Derrick Draw, Tex.
(1973) 7.5 minute quadrangle map (Figure 2). The construction corridor consists of a 50 foot (15 m) wide
permanent pipeline right-of-way (ROW) and a 50 foot (15 m) wide temporary workspace corridor. The
cultural resources survey corridor and area of potential effect (APE) was 100 foot (30 m) wide for the entire
1,200 foot (365 m) length of the pipeline segment through the State of Texas Lands, for a total of 2.75 acres
(1.11 hectares).
The survey of the State of Texas Lands property was completed under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 9016.
The cultural resources field investigation of the 4 Points Pipeline Project on State of Texas Lands was
conducted on November 1, 2018 by ENERCON archeologist J. Matthew Oliver and Gary Edington, an
ENERCON archeologist who meets the U.S. Secretary of the Interior’s Professional Qualification
Standards for archeology as set forth in 36 CFR 61, and consisted of intensive pedestrian survey utilizing
transects spaced no greater than 15 m apart, with shovel tests in areas which had the potential for buried
cultural resources. The field investigation was conducted in accordance with the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) Archeological Survey Standards for Texas. The entire project was supervised by
Michael Margolis, an ENERCON archeologist who meets the U.S. Secretary of the Interior’s Professional
Qualification Standards for archeology as set forth in 36 CFR 61. Pursuant to 13 TAC 26.17,
correspondence, field records, and photographs generated during field investigations have been prepared
for permanent curation at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, Austin, Texas.
The cultural resources survey did not result in finding any historic or prehistoric artifacts, features, cultural
lenses, or sites over 50 years of age on State of Texas Lands. No archeological sites were encountered, and
no artifacts were collected. Therefore, it is recommended that the project will have no effect on any cultural
resources that may qualify for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on State of
Texas Lands. No further cultural resources investigations are recommended prior to the proposed
construction of the 4 Points Pipeline Project on State of Texas Lands. If cultural material, including sites,
features, or artifacts that are 50 years old or older are encountered within the ROW during construction of
this project, work in the area must cease and the Texas Historical Commission must be immediately
notified.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

The study area is situated within the Chihuahuan Basins and Playas sub-ecoregion of the Chihuahuan
Deserts ecoregion (Griffith et al. 2007). The Chihuahuan Basins and Playas are part of the larger
Chihuahuan Deserts which extend from the Madrean Archipelago of Arizona in the west to the Edwards
Plateau of west-central Texas. The boundaries of this area are defined by an arid climate with some of the
lowest precipitation rates in Texas, with annual rainfall recorded at eight to fourteen inches (20 to 36
centimeters [cm]), which support desert scrub-shrub vegetation dominated by creosote bush on the alkaline
or gypsiferous soils (Griffith et al. 2007). The elevation of the Chihuahuan Basins and Playas range from
1,200 to 4,500 feet (366 to 1,372 m) above mean sea level (amsl) with local relief varying from 25 to 500
feet (8 to 152 m) (Griffith et al. 2007:10). The major drainage of the approximately 12,625 square mile
(32,699 km2) ecoregion is the Pecos River which carries runoff from New Mexico to the north (Griffith et
al. 2007:8-9). Otherwise, the ecoregion is primarily internally drained, resulting in alkaline soils, but an
efficient recharge rate of local aquifers.
The presence of the quality groundwater did not go unnoticed by settlers and early 20th century inhabitants
who made use of the abundant groundwater with irrigation wells with flow rates between several hundred
to 2000 gallons per minute (Griffith et al. 2007:9). The primary crops on these irrigated agricultural fields
have included cotton, pecans, alfalfa, tomatoes, onions, chili peppers, and the famous melons, particularly
cantaloupe from Reeves County (Griffith el al. 2007; Geiser 2010). Prehistoric and protohistoric
populations made use of irrigation in the region in the past (Long 2010, Dethloff and Nall 2010). The
ranching and irrigation based agricultural practices developed from the late 19th to 20th century in the region
have altered the native environment. In the El Paso area to the west aquifer drawdown has resulted in an
over a 100 foot (30 m) decline in ground water levels from those recorded at the turn of the 20 th century
and salt build up in soils has led to the abandonment of Pecos Valley agricultural fields which were
previously productive farmlands in the 1900s (Griffith et al. 2007:9). The agricultural and industrial uses
of the Pecos River in New Mexico and Texas have reduced the river, which was described by early
observers as being 4 to 15 feet (1 to 5 m) deep, and up to 100 feet (30 m) wide, and as fast, deep and wide
(Griffith et al. 2007:9; Hayter 2010), into a gentle, slow, shallow and narrow channel. As an example, the
early history of settlement in the region of modern Pecos, Texas was related to the encampments of cowboys
in the region due to the safe ford for cattle across the mighty Pecos River to the east of the modern town
site (Smith 2010a). The historic to modern grazing practices in the region have also altered the environment.
The former grasslands which supported cattle have been reduced by overgrazing to desert shrub lands
suitable only for sheep and goats (Griffith et al. 2007:8).
The desert setting of the study area results in relatively sparse vegetation and excellent ground surface
visibility (GSV). The dominant creosote bush is an example of the resilient regional flora which can tolerate
the diurnal temperature range, low moisture conditions, and high evapotranspiration rates of the region.
Additional ecotones include the high saline environments of the playas where saltbush and alkali sacaton
may be found along the margins of these dry saltpans and playas (Griffith et al. 2007:8). Honey mesquite,
yucca, and mixed grasses are found intermittently in the region.
The study area ranges from approximately 3,248 feet to 3,261 feet (990 to 994 m) amsl. The eastern segment
of State of Texas Lands has the lowest elevation, with the highest point occurring near an existing lease
road in the southwestern segment of State of Texas Lands.
According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the proposed project on State of Texas
Lands crosses one mapped soil unit, the Holloman-Reeves association, gently undulating (USDA 2018).
The Holloman-Reeves association, gently undulating soils consist of loamy alluvium and residuum derived
from decomposed gypsum which is not considered prime farmland. The soil association can be very shallow
Cultural Resources Report: Proposed 4 Points Pipeline Project State of Texas Lands Segment

Page 4

with gypsiferous bedrock between nine (23 cm) and 40 inches (102 cm) in depth (USDA 2018). Overall,
the mapped soil unit has a relatively shallow depth to bedrock suggesting a low potential for deeply buried
cultural deposits.
Reeves County has a subtropical-semi desert climate with relatively short mild winters and long hot
summers. The average daily temperature is 46 degrees Fahrenheit (°F) in the winter and 83°F in the summer
(Orton 1975). Annual rainfall averages about 12 inches (29.5 cm) or less and is distributed evenly
throughout the year, with a long growing season for crops from April through September (Jaco 1980). The
average humidity ranges from 40 to 70 percent due to a general paucity of thunderstorms and heavy rainfall
and the fact that only one-third of winters averaging any measurable snowfall (Orton 1975).

ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND

Based on the archeological record, people have inhabited Texas for at least the last 12,000 years. The
prehistory of the Southern High Plains has been commonly broken into five temporal periods. The dates
assigned to those periods differ between authors but generally include the Paleoindian Period (ca. 11,5008,500 B.P.), Archaic Period (ca. 8,500-1500 B.P.), and Late Prehistoric Period (ca. 1,500 B.P. to 500 B.P.).
The Protohistoric Period (ca. A.D. 1500-1700) is followed by the Historic Period (ca. A.D. 1700-1950)
(adapted from Boyd 2004).
A summary of the culture history of the region is summarized below. For additional information on the
cultural history of the region and a more detailed review than is possible here, the reader is directed to the
works by Patterson (1995), Ensor (1991), Perttula (2004), and Turner, Hester, and McReynolds (2011).
Paleoindian Period
Evidence for prehistoric occupation of the area is relatively scarce in the Paleoindian Period (ca. 11,5008,500 B.P.). It is highly likely that earlier sites have been lost to erosion due to the geological context of the
area (Boyd 1997). Paleoindian sites are more common on the eastern Edwards Plateau, although sites and
isolated artifacts have been recorded. Although there is growing evidence for earlier human presence in the
Americas, the Clovis is the first well-defined cultural horizon in the region. The remains of large herbivores
are often found in association with Clovis artifacts but there is a growing body of evidence for the
procurement of smaller animals and plants during this time. The Clovis projectile points are lanceolate in
shape and have fluted bases. Subsequent Paleoindian projectile points include Folsom and Plainview
(Turner, Hester, and McReynolds 2011:45). These projectile points were typically hafted to spears, which
were often thrown with the aid of atlatls.
Archaic Period
With the extinction of megafauna, the Archaic Period (ca. 8,500-1,500 B.P.) is generally defined by broader
subsistence practices and an increase in intensity of resource exploitation. The climate transitioned from
relatively wet in the Early Archaic Period to relatively dry in the Late Archaic Period. Additionally,
temperatures appear to have increased which resulted in changes to the biotic community. Fire cracked rock
(FCR) and oxidized rock is relatively common during this period and likely results from hearths and ovens
(Collins 2004). Although resource exploitation is inferred to be more intense, subsistence appears to be
focused on seasonal mobility tied in part to bison hunting (Boyd 1997). Campsites and rock shelters have
been identified from this period, mostly from the Late Archaic. Projectile points are normally barbed spear
and dart points, and plant-processing tools increase through time (Johnson and Holliday 2004).

Late Prehistoric Period
The Late Prehistoric or Ceramic Period (ca. 1,500 B.P. to 500 B.P.) is marked by the presence of ceramics
and smaller projectile points indicating the switch from atlatl and spear to the bow and arrow (Johnson and
Holliday 2004). Due to further drying of the climate, bison appear to become scarcer in this region. Trading
is inferred to have occurred with Southwestern groups including the Jornada Mogollon (Boyd 1997).
Brownware pottery was imported from the Puebloans and habitation structures from this period include pit
houses. Campsites were still likely used during parts of the year and would be representative of seasonal
mobility. Subsistence practices included the introduction of corn. In the latter part of the period, prestige
goods like Olivella shell beads, turquoise, non-local pottery, and obsidian become more common.
Protohistoric Period
The Protohistoric Period (ca. A.D. 1500-1700) begins with direct and indirect European influences in the
region. The end of the period coincides with an increase in European presence and their effects on traditional
lifestyles. Limited access to Europeans goods begins but there is relatively minimal change from the Late
Prehistoric. Trade goods include bells, spikes, glass beads, and nails. European settlement did not begin to
seriously disrupt aboriginal habitation until after A.D. 1700 (Patterson 1995:249). European diseases,
probably introduced by explorers and early traders, did begin to have impacts as early as A.D. 1528. At
least seven epidemics were recorded among the tribes of the study area between that date and A.D. 1890
(Ewers 1974). The Tonkawa appear to have been joined by the Ervipiame from northern Mexico (Hester
1980). Subsequent immigration by the Lipan Apache, Kiowa, and Comanche appear to change control of
the area.
Historic Period (A.D. 1700 to 1950)
Spanish explorers began expeditions in the Gulf of Mexico beginning in the early 1500s followed by
Catholic missionaries accompanied by Spanish soldiers. The Spanish, while teaching locals Christianity
and farming, attempted to make loyal Spanish citizens. The first missions were established in Mexico, but
were later built in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas (Campbell 2003:36-38). The French,
partially to stem the advance of the Spanish, wanted to increase their fur trading territory and gain control
of the Mississippi River valley. By 1682, LaSalle, a Frenchman, launched an expedition down the
Mississippi River that claimed all of the lands drained by the river for France followed by a colonization
effort to settle the mouth of the Mississippi River. Subsequent to the French incursion into the region, the
Spanish increased the rate of establishing settlements in Texas (Campbell 2003:41-45, 48).
The Spanish mission system did not expand during the eighteenth century. Native American attacks and a
lack of colonists contributed to the decline of Spanish settlement in Texas. In 1762, the Spanish acquired
Louisiana from the French, which slowed the need to settle east Texas. In 1800, Spain ceded Louisiana to
France, who then sold it to the U.S. From 1800 to the 1820s, the population of Texas decreased as a result
of the effects of the Mexican Revolution. In 1821, Mexico finally became an independent nation, separate
from Spain. This newly independent country encouraged Anglo-American settlement within Texas; this
effort was led by Stephen F. Austin. Austin came to an agreement with the Mexican government in which
he would bring settlers to Texas and, in return, he would be rewarded with land and money. By 1830, ten
thousand Anglo-Americans, mostly from the American southeast, had settled in Texas (Campbell
2003:105-110).
Texas operated as an independent nation for 10 years (1836 to 1846) and during this time, the Mexican
government never truly recognized its independence. In 1846, Texas was annexed by the U.S. and it was
now up to the U.S. government to settle the border dispute with Mexico. The Mexicans claimed the

international border as the Nueces River, while the U.S. claimed the Rio Grande River as the demarcation
line. After two years of skirmishes and an attack on Mexico City, the U.S. succeeded in its efforts; with the
treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Mexico recognized the Rio Grande as the border and ceded the entire
southwest to the Pacific Ocean to the U.S. (McComb 1989:57).
At the time of annexation by the U.S., west Texas was unexplored territory, home to various Native
American groups. Settlers began slowly pushing into this territory in the mid-19th century. In 1848, the
U.S. army stationed troops in west Texas and created travel routes through this new territory, which would
become corridors for pioneers traveling to California. These included the Chihuahua Trail, which led from
Mexico to Indianola, Texas, and Horsehead Crossing and Castle Gap in Crane County, all of which were
utilized as trade networks during the prehistoric period as well as forming part of a historic transportation
corridor linking Mexico, the U.S. and Canada. Castle Gap functioned as a primary route for the U.S. Cavalry,
California Forty-niners, cattle drives, and stage coach/wagon trains.
During the Civil War, Texas was a large contributor to the Confederacy, but differed significantly from
other southern states. Texas was a frontier state, with a diversified population of Mexicans, AngloAmericans, and Native Americans. The state also had a large European immigrant population, many of
whom were small farmers. Two-thirds of the farmers in the state were non-slave holding, which meant that
the agricultural economy was maintained following the Civil War. In addition, cattle ranches were a large
industry, resulting in economic diversity. Thus, Texas was not as negatively impacted economically as other
southern states during post-Civil War Reconstruction (Campbell 2003:209, 213).
The Native American groups of Texas saw the defeat of the Confederacy and the weakening of Texas as a
chance to regain lands they had lost. During this period, the Comanche and Apache occupied the areas of
west Texas. In response to this increase of Native American attacks, the U.S. sent troops to reoccupy several
forts. By 1874, a major campaign was initiated in Texas that took away Native Americans’ horses,
destroyed their villages and forced them to return to their reservations. The consolidation of Native
Americans on reservations allowed for Anglo-Americans to settle permanently in west Texas (Campbell
2003:291, 295).
Following these campaigns, the military sent troops to conduct detailed expeditions of the former Native
American lands. By 1876, several of the counties northeast of the project area were surveyed by parties
from Fort Concho. Ranchers moved into these areas and began raising large herds of cattle, as the demand
for beef had risen after the Civil War. New cattle trails developed throughout west Texas, where large herds
were driven hundreds of miles north to the mid-western railroad routes. In 1881, the Texas and Pacific
Railway extended their rail lines through west Texas; up to this point, rail transportation was only available
in east Texas. Between the 1870s and 1890s, 8,000 miles of railway track were laid, connecting the entire
state. The new railroads significantly reduced the time and distance it took the cattle industry to transport
their herds to market (Campbell 2003:297, 306).
The expansion of the railroad connected the rural communities of west Texas with the booming cities to
the east. Towards the end of the 19th century, cattle ranchers began to fence off their herds and create small
communities on the frontier. In 1895, a law was passed that broke up these larger ranches, allowing farmers
to purchase smaller tracts of land. This led to the end of open-range ranching and attracted additional
settlers. West Texas communities grew slowly due to poor soil conditions and the difficulty of accessing
water. People began to farm corn and cotton on the newly settled land, but ranching was still the dominant
economic activity of west Texas at the end of the 19th century.
Reeves County is located in the Trans-Pecos region of Texas on the southwest side of the Pecos River from
Ward County and totals 2,538 square miles (6,573 km2) of primarily flat to undulating lands, with
mountainous areas found in the southern point of the county (Smith 2010b). The Texas and Pacific Railway
Cultural Resources Report: Proposed 4 Points Pipeline Project State of Texas Lands Segment

Page 7

was constructed through the area in 1881 with railway section houses at Pecos and Toyah, and in 1883
Reeves County was separated from Pecos County to the southwest, and Pecos was designated the county
seat in 1884 during the formal organization of the county (Smith 2010b). By 1885, the community of Pecos
reported 150 residents and the community of Toyah reported 75 residents, and by 1890, Reeves County had
a population of 1,290 persons (Smith 2010b). The census of 1900 counted 1,847 residents in the county,
with 63 farms being reported totaling 900,000 acres of farmland and 51,000 head of cattle (Smith 2010b).
Intermittent droughts affected the region, as noted above, and the acres of farmland and size of the cattle
herds in the county fluctuated over the next 20 years, yet the population still increased to 4,457 residents
(Smith 2010b). The discoveries of oil in the county in the 1920s contributed to the economy, but the large
boom experienced in the Hendrick Field to the east did not extend into Reeves County. It was not until the
1930s that oil fields in Reeves County brought significant economic and population growth, and by 1940
the population had increased to 8,006 residents (Smith 2010b). The 1950s discoveries of the Toyah Gas
Field and the Geraldine-Ford field were significant in the county, but again did not compare to the “giant
fields” discovered elsewhere in the region. Nevertheless, the population of the county enumerated in 1960
was 17,644 and has declined since to 16,526 residents in 1970, and 15,801 residents in 1980. The decline
in population numbers is interesting, as the area experienced a significant oil boom in the 1970s and early
1980s (Smith 2010b). The 1990 census counted 15,852 residents, and in 2010, 13,783 residents were
counted with the current July 1, 2017 estimated population is at 15,281 residents (Smith 2010a; USCB
2018a). Since inception in 1883, the economy of Reeves County has been based on agriculture and mineral
extraction, with oil and gas development being the primary economic activity over the last nine decades,
while crops have included cotton, hay, wheat, barley and fruits and vegetables such as onions, peppers,
pecans, peaches, and cantaloupes (Smith 2010b, Jaco 1980).
Pecos, Texas has had a colorful history since the 19th century inception of the town on the east side of the
Pecos River as a cattle camp. Later, the Texas and Pacific Railway constructed Pecos Station in 1891 on
land George A. Knight offered the railroad, and the community of Pecos Station evolved, later to be called
Pecos City and finally, Pecos (Smith 2010a). In the 1890s Pecos was known for some famous gunfights
which took place there (Smith 2010a). Nevertheless, growth and opportunity developed in Pecos in the
1890s. In 1900 the three room school at Pecos, which opened in 1883, had 111 students and three teachers,
which caused expansion to two schools, with 148 students and four teachers for the subsequent 1900-1991
term (Smith 2010a). In 1885, the population of Pecos was 150 residents, which grew to 4,000 by 1929 when
the residents voted to incorporate their town (Smith 2010a). By 1940, Pecos had 4,800 residents, and the
construction of the Pecos Army Airfield during World War II increased the population to 6,500 in 1943,
with continued growth indicated by 8,054 residents noted in 1952, until the population peaked in 1970 with
14,200 residents (Smith 2010a). In 1990, the population was 12,069 and in 2000, 9,501 residents were
enumerated, with a decline to 8,780 residents listed in the 2010 census, and a current estimate of 9,922
residents for July 1, 2017 (USCB 2018b).

BACKGROUND RESEARCH

Prior to field investigations, an address-restricted records search was conducted online at the Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (the Atlas) to locate previously recorded archeological sites, archeological
surveys, NHRP properties, and State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs) near the project area. This research
was conducted to determine if any known resources could be affected, as well as the types of resources in
the area, and the probability of encountering the resources during fieldwork. A site file check was conducted
by Michael Margolis, an ENERCON archeologist who meets the U.S. Secretary of the Interior’s
Professional Qualification Standards for archeology as set forth in 36 CFR 61, which resulted in the
determination that no previously recorded sites are within the APE, or within 1-mile of the APE on State
of Texas Lands. Based on the Atlas, there is one mapped project within 1-mile of the APE on State of Texas
Cultural Resources Report: Proposed 4 Points Pipeline Project State of Texas Lands Segment

Page 8

Lands. There are no structures depicted within or adjacent to the APE on the USGS Derrick Draw, Texas
7.5 minute quadrangle map (USGS 1973). Additionally, no cultural features are visible on aerial
photographs of the area.
The previous archeological study within 1-mile of the project is designated as THC Atlas Number
8500080410. However, there is no information regarding the previous survey in the Atlas database. The
overall background research of the region suggests that the study area is located within a larger area where
climatic conditions, burrowing rodents, and the effects of ranching and oil and gas exploration have each
affected the cultural landscape leading to two types of general settings. Wind erosion and extensive
bioturbation from rodent burrowing, and sheep and cattle grazing have exposed the upper surface of the
landscape within the Chihuahuan Basins and Playas. With the exception of a few geomorphological
locations, archeological sites of all ages may be located on the exposed ground surface and/or were never
buried (Hall 2006:2-7). The majority of archeological sites are located on eroded surfaces and therefore
lack vertical integrity and stratigraphy (Hall 2006:2-15). While intact archeological deposits may be
encountered where there are depositional processes, such as (a) colluvial; (b) eolian sand deposits associated
with the playa margins; (c) upland playa and lake fill deposits; and (d) within and adjacent to extant and/or
extinct draws and/or drainages of Late-Pleistocene to early Holocene age (Hall 2006:2-7, 2-11; Johnson
and Holliday 2004:285, 290, 294). Within the State of Texas Lands segment of the proposed 4 Points
Pipeline Project the former setting is predominant, and many sites would be expected to be resting on the
surface, or ephemerally exposed by shifting sand dunes.

METHODOLOGY
The cultural resources field investigation followed the THC’s Archeological Survey Standards for Texas.
The project area was surveyed by using parallel pedestrian transects spaced no more than 15 m apart. The
entire 100 foot (30 m) wide survey corridor within the proposed 4 Points Pipeline Project survey area on
State of Texas Lands was subjected to pedestrian survey for cultural resources.
Shovel testing density within the survey followed minimum standards outlined by the THC and the Council
of Texas Archeologists’ practices and procedures, which call for 16 shovel tests per mile in settings which
have potential for buried deposits. Shovel testing was not required in areas where ground surface visibility
(GSV) was greater than 30 percent, or areas with slopes greater than 20 percent, or which did not exhibit
potential for buried deposits. Shovel test pits are not excavated in areas with standing water, or in areas in
which underground utilities are present.
Shovel tests generally measure 30 cm in diameter and are excavated by hand digging to bedrock, a
stratigraphic deposit (e.g. subsoil) that was determined to be below Holocene aged deposits, or to 80-100
cm (dependent on soil matrix consistency and hardness). All shovel test pit fill was passed through ¼ inch
mesh screen or gone through by hand if the soil would not pass through the screen. Shovel test pits were
excavated in arbitrary 10 cm levels unless stratigraphic changes were observed.
The cultural resources field investigation of the 100 foot (30 m) wide survey corridor exceeded the
minimum standards outlined by the THC and the Council of Texas Archeologists’ practices and procedures
(13 TAC 26.5 and 26.20).

RESULTS

The cultural resources field investigation on the State of Texas Lands property was conducted on November
1, 2018 by ENERCON archeologist J. Matthew Oliver and Gary Edington, an ENERCON archeologist
who meets the U.S. Secretary of the Interior’s Professional Qualification Standards for archeology as set
forth in 36 CFR 61. The entire project was supervised by Michael Margolis, an ENERCON archeologist
who meets the U.S. Secretary of the Interior’s Professional Qualification Standards for archeology as set
forth in 36 CFR 61. The cultural resources survey corridor was 100 foot (30 m) wide for the entire 1,200
foot (365 m) length of the pipeline segment through the State of Texas Lands (Figure 3). The total area
inspected during the cultural resources survey was 2.75 acres (1.11 hectares).
During the fieldwork, the weather was generally mild with low temperatures in the upper 40s°F and daily
high temperatures in the 60s to lower 70s°F with clear to partly cloudy skies and relatively low winds. The
State of Texas Lands property is located northeast of Farm Road 2119 and extends north across Derrick
Draw and has flat to gently sloped upland terrain with vegetation dominated by typical desert scrub-shrub
vegetation including creosote bush, mesquite, intermittent thin mixed grasses, and occasional narrow leaf
yucca with GSV averaging over 90 percent (Figures 2 to 6). The APE parallels and crosses existing pipeline
ROWs throughout the State of Texas Lands segment of the APE (Figures 3 to 6). Additional disturbances
to the project area are from the construction and maintenance of unpaved roads.
The overall setting of the APE within State of Texas lands exhibited a low probability of prehistoric sites
due to the combination of distance from water being over 2,620 feet (800 m) and shallow or deflated soils.
Due to the observed deflated soils, high ground surface visibility and previous disturbances observed in the
APE (Figures 3 to 6) no shovel tests were placed within the APE.
The cultural resources investigation of the proposed 4 Points Pipeline Project on State of Texas Lands did
not result in the observation of any cultural materials over 50 years of age within the ROW.

RECOMMENDATIONS

ENERCON, in support of Salt Creek Midstream, LLC, conducted an intensive archeological survey for the
proposed 4 Points Pipeline Project. The proposed pipeline is approximately 2.2 miles (3.5 km) in length,
located near Pecos, Texas in Culberson and Reeves Counties. This report encompasses only the State of
Texas Lands administered by the TGLO segment of the proposed 4 Points Pipeline Project which is
approximately 1,200 feet (355 m) in length. The State of Texas Lands segment of the project area is mapped
on the USGS Derrick Draw, Tex. (1973) 7.5 minute quadrangle map. The construction corridor and APE
consist of a 50 foot (15 m) wide permanent pipeline ROW and a 50 foot (15 m) wide temporary workspace
corridor. The cultural resources survey corridor and APE was 100 foot (30 m) wide for the entire 1,200 foot
(365 m) length of the pipeline segment through the State of Texas Lands, totaling 2.75 acres (1.11 hectares).
The survey of the State of Texas Lands property was completed under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 9016.
The survey of the State of Texas Lands property was completed under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 9016.
The cultural resources field investigation of the 4 Points Pipeline Project on State of Texas Lands was
conducted on November 1, 2018 by ENERCON archeologist J. Matthew Oliver and Gary Edington, an
ENERCON archeologist who meets the U.S. Secretary of the Interior’s Professional Qualification
Standards for archeology as set forth in 36 CFR 61, and consisted of intensive pedestrian survey utilizing
transects spaced no greater than 15 m apart, with shovel tests in areas which had the potential for buried
cultural resources. The field investigation was conducted in accordance with the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) Archeological Survey Standards for Texas. The entire project was supervised by
Michael Margolis, an ENERCON archeologist who meets the U.S. Secretary of the Interior’s Professional
Qualification Standards for archeology as set forth in 36 CFR 61.
The cultural resources survey did not result in finding any historic or prehistoric artifacts, features, cultural
lenses, or sites on State of Texas Lands. Therefore, it is recommended that the project will have no effect
on any cultural resources that may qualify for inclusion in the NRHP on State of Texas Lands. No further
cultural resources investigations are recommended prior to the proposed construction of the 4 Points
Pipeline Project on State of Texas lands. If cultural material, including sites, features, or artifacts that are
50 years old or older are encountered within the ROW during construction of this project, work in the area
must cease and the Texas Historical Commission must be immediately notified.
