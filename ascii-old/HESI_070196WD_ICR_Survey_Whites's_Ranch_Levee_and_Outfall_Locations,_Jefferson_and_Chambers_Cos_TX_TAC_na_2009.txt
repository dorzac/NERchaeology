MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

White’s Ranch is proposing to reconstruct 15 existing earthen levee segments and to
reconstruct and expand the levees at 4 outfall locations along the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway
(GIWW) in Jefferson and Chambers counties, just east of High Island, Texas. White’s Ranch,
the local landowner, is proposing to reconstruct 15 separate earthen levee segments along
approximately 3.1 kilometers (km) (1.9 miles [mi]) of the northern side of the GIWW, covering a
total of approximately 3.91 hectares (ha) (9.64 acres [ac]), in areas where the old dredged
material has been eroded below an elevation of 1.5 m (5.0 ft) above mean sea level (amsl). In
addition, White’s Ranch is proposing to reconstruct and expand existing levees at 4 outfall
locations, including approximately 2.73 ha (6.74 ac) of existing levees and 3.3 ha (8.08 ac) of
levee expansions. The intent of the proposed project is to restore an effective barrier to salt
water intrusion, which should help to reverse the salinity of the landward wet prairies over time
and provide benefits to all wildlife in the area, as well as facilitate the landowner’s use of the
land for seasonal grazing and hunting.
The proposed project would entail reconstruction of 15 earthen levee segments and
reconstruction and expansion of levee segments at 4 outfall locations along the north bank of
the GIWW. The levee system begins at the confluence of the North Prong of Mud Bayou and
the GIWW and extends eastward approximately 9.2 km (5.7 mi) in isolated segments. The
proposed reconstructed levee segments would measure approximately 12 m (40 ft) in width
from toe to toe and 0.6 to 0.9 m (2.0 to 3.0 ft) in height above existing grade to achieve the
previous levee height of 1.5 m (5.0 ft) amsl. The Area of Potential Effect (APE) of the proposed
undertaking therefore consists of approximately 3.91 ha (9.64 ac) along the 15 existing levee
segments, 2.73 ha (6.74 ac) of existing levees at the 4 outfall locations, and 3.3 ha (8.08 ac) of
levee expansions at the 4 outfall locations, for a total APE of 9.92 ha (24.46 ac).
The proposed construction activities would impact approximately 1.6 ha (3.9 ac) of
“waters of the US” through placement of fill materials to facilitate construction of the proposed
levee segments, and an application to the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to impact
“waters of the US” under Nationwide Permit (NWP) No. 27 is currently being prepared. As a
federal permit would be required for the proposed action, the project would fall under the
jurisdiction of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as
amended. As the project represents a federally permitted undertaking with the potential to
impact significant cultural resources, White’s Ranch was required to provide for a cultural

resources inventory and assessment of the project’s APE and to assess the project’s possible
impacts on any significant cultural resources in the APE.
Horizon conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the 15 earthen levee
segments proposed for reconstruction on July 1, 2008, and of the 4 outfall locations on
March 30, 2009, to locate any cultural resource properties that potentially would be impacted by
the proposed construction project. All segments of the APE consisted of artificially elevated
ridges on the north bank of the GIWW composed of redeposited dredge spoil excavated
previously from the GIWW. The APE was traversed by Horizon’s archeologists and the modern
ground was thoroughly inspected for evidence of historic and prehistoric cultural resources.
Horizon excavated a total of 65 shovel tests within the APE, thereby exceeding the Texas State
Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) requirements for a project area of this
size.
At the time of the survey, the private property on which the APE is situated consisted of
rural agricultural land, primarily cattle pastures, and GIWW frontage. Cutbanks observed along
the north bank of the GIWW show deep profiles of dense, clayey sediments. Vegetation
consisted of various short to tall grasses, weeds, and reedy marsh understory as well as
scattered deciduous hardwood trees. Moderately extensive erosion was evident in most
segments of the APE. Furthermore, soils in this area are typically poorly drained, and standing
water was relatively common on the modern ground surface. Aside from impacts associated
with the original construction of the dredge spoil piles that comprise the levee system, the
natural landscape appeared to be largely intact overall.
No cultural resources, historic or prehistoric, were identified within the APE as a result of
the survey.
Based on the results of the survey-level investigations on the White’s Ranch project area
documented in this report, no potentially significant cultural resources would be affected by the
proposed undertaking. No new cultural resources were identified in the remainder of the project
area as a result of intensive survey activities, and no previously documented cultural resources
are present in the vicinity of the project area that would be adversely affected by the proposed
undertaking.
In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, Horizon has made a reasonable and good faith effort
to identify historic properties within the APE. As no cultural resources were identified that meet
the criteria for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) according to 36 CFR
60.4, no further archeological work is recommended in connection with the proposed
undertaking. It is recommended that the proposed project be cleared to proceed. However, in
the unlikely event that any human remains or burial furniture are inadvertently discovered at any
point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance in the project area, even in previously
surveyed areas, all work should cease immediately and the USACE and Texas Historical
Commission’s (THC) should be notified of the discovery.

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of 15 Levee Segments and
4 Outfall Locations on White’s Ranch, Jefferson and Chambers Counties, Texas

1.0 INTRODUCTION

White’s Ranch is proposing to reconstruct 15 existing earthen levee segments and
reconstruct and expand the levees at 4 outfall locations along the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway
(GIWW) in Jefferson and Chambers counties, just east of High Island, Texas, for purposes of
restricting salt water intrusion and restoring freshwater wet prairie systems inland of the GIWW
(Figure 1). When the GIWW was originally constructed in this area, dredged material from the
excavation was piled along the banks of the channel on both sides, presumably for ease of
disposal, but also effectively forming a barrier to intrusion of salt water from the GIWW into the
freshwater marshes and wet prairies that were dominant in this area. The dredged material
mounds formed a near-continuous levee 15 to 61 meters (m) (50 to 200 feet [ft]) wide with
elevations of 5 m (15 ft) or more that precluded all but tropical storm tides from entering the
freshwater systems. Periodic “windows” of natural grade openings were left in the dredged
material levee to allow for the back drainage of tropical storm tides that might overtop the
barrier. Over the years of operation of the GIWW, wakes and turbulence from frequent barge
traffic have caused lateral erosion of the GIWW banks of 30 m (100 ft) or more on each side. In
many areas, this erosion has eliminated the previously existing dredged material barrier and
allowed high tides to enter the wet prairie systems with relative frequency, resulting in a
transition to more saline and less diverse prairie and wetland habitats. Maintenance dredge
material from the GIWW is currently disposed of in containment cells on the Gulf side of the
GIWW, and replenishment of the former barriers on the north side of the GIWW is no longer
occurring.
White’s Ranch, the local landowner, is proposing to reconstruct 15 separate earthen
levee segments along approximately 3.1 kilometers (km) (1.9 miles [mi]) of the northern side of
the GIWW, covering a total of approximately 3.91 hectares (ha) (9.64 acres [ac]), in areas
where the old dredged material has been eroded below an elevation of 1.5 m (5.0 ft) above
mean sea level (amsl). In addition, White’s Ranch is proposing to reconstruct and expand
existing levees at 4 outfall locations, including approximately 2.73 ha (6.74 ac) of existing levees
and 3.3 ha (8.08 ac) of levee expansions. The intent of the proposed project is to restore an
effective barrier to salt water intrusion, which should help to reverse the salinity of the landward
wet prairies over time and provide benefits to all wildlife in the area, as well as facilitate the
landowner’s use of the land for seasonal grazing and hunting.

Chapter 1.0: Introduction

The proposed construction activities would impact approximately 1.6 ha (3.9 ac) of
“waters of the US” through placement of fill materials to facilitate construction of the proposed
levee segments, and an application to the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to impact
“waters of the US” under Nationwide Permit (NWP) No. 27 is currently being prepared. As a
federal permit would be required for the proposed action, the project would fall under the
jurisdiction of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as
amended. As the project represents a federally permitted undertaking with the potential to
impact significant cultural resources, White’s Ranch was required to provide for a cultural
resources inventory and assessment of the project’s APE and to assess the project’s possible
impacts on any significant cultural resources in the APE.
To meet its responsibilities under the NHPA, White’s Ranch contracted with Horizon
Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon), to conduct a cultural resources survey of the APE. The
purpose of the survey was to determine if any archeological and/or historical sites are located
within the project area, and, if any exist, to determine their eligibility for inclusion in the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The cultural resources investigation consisted of an
archival review, an intensive pedestrian survey of the defined APE, and the production of a
report suitable for review by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with
the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26,
Section 27, and the Council of Texas Archeologists’ (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources
Management Reports.
Fieldwork was conducted during 2 separate episodes. Horizon conducted an intensive
cultural resources survey of the 15 earthen levee segments proposed for reconstruction on
July 1, 2008, and of the 4 outfall locations on March 30, 2009. Jeffrey D. Owens served as the
Principal Investigator for the project, Michael Mudd served as project archeologist, and Jared
Wiersema served as field technician. The purpose of the survey was to locate any cultural
resource properties that potentially would be impacted by the proposed construction project.
The survey was conducted by Horizon under subcontract to White’s Ranch.
This report presents the results of the cultural resource survey. Following this
introductory chapter, Chapters 2.0 and 3.0 present the environmental and cultural backgrounds
of the project area, respectively. Chapter 4.0 describes the research objectives, results of
archival research, and cultural resource survey methods implemented during the survey.
Chapter 5.0 presents the results of the survey, and Chapter 6.0 presents cultural resource
management recommendations for the project. Chapter 7.0 lists the references cited in the
report, and Appendix A presents data collected from shovel tests excavated during the survey.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The project area is located east of the community of High Island in southwestern
Jefferson County and southeastern Chambers County, Texas. The project area is situated on
the Gulf Coastal Plain in southeastern Texas about 5.0 km (3.1 mi) northwest of the Gulf of
Mexico shoreline. The Gulf of Mexico represents a structural basin formed by lithosphere
deformation. The Texas Coastal Plain, which extends as far north as the Ouachita uplift in
southern Oklahoma and westward to the Balcones Escarpment, consists of seaward-dipping
bodies of sedimentary rock, most of which are of terrigenous clastic origin, that reflect the
gradual infilling of the basin from its margins (Abbott 2001). The Houston area is underlain by
rocks and unconsolidated sediments that are quite young in a geological sense, ranging from
modern to Miocene in age. These consist predominantly of a series of fluviodeltaic bodies
arranged in an offlapped sequence, with interdigitated and capping eolian, littoral, and estuarine
facies making up a relatively minor component of the lithology. Major bounding disconformities
between these formations are usually interpreted to represent depositional hiatuses that
occurred during periods of sea level low stand. The oldest rocks in this fill are of Late
Cretaceous age. As a result of the geometry of basin filling, successively younger rock units
crop out in subparallel bands from the basin margin toward the modern coastline.
The project area runs along the northern bank of the GIWW and is situated entirely on
marshy lowlands abutting the Gulf shoreline. The GIWW is a channelized canal that roughly
parallels the Gulf of Mexico shoreline. Local topography is extremely flat and near sea level.
The only notable topographic variation in the area is that provided by the artificial levee system,
which provides up to 1.5 m (5.0 ft) of elevation depending on the extent of local levee erosion.

2.2

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

The project area is underlain by Holocene-age alluvial deposits, which constitute the
majority of the marshy lowlands and barrier islands abutting the Gulf of Mexico, though
surrounding uplands slightly farther inland are underlain by the Beaumont Formation (Crout et
al. 1965; Fisher 1982; Shelby et al. 1968). The Beaumont, or Prairie, terrace is the youngest
continuous coastwise terrace fronting the modern Gulf (Abbott 2001). The Beaumont Formation
consists of clay, silt, and fine sand arranged in spatial patterns that reflect the distribution of

HJN 070196 WD

7

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

fluvial (e.g., channel, point bar, levee, and backswamp) and mudflat/coastal marsh facies (Van
Siclen 1985). Sandy deposits associated with littoral facies are also frequently considered part
of the Beaumont. Many investigators (cf. DuBar et al. 1991; Fisk 1938, 1940) have correlated
the Beaumont terrace with the Sangamon Interglacial (ca. 130 to 75 thousand years ago [kya]),
although age estimates range from Middle Wisconsinan (Alford and Holmes 1985) to 100 to
600 kya (Blum and Price 1994). While debate about the temporal affiliations of and correlations
among the deposits that underlie the major coastline terraces remains active, they are of little
direct geoarcheological relevance because virtually all investigators agree that these deposits
considerably predate the earliest demonstrated dates of human occupation in North America.
The project area is situated on the Beaumont-Morey soil association, a nearly flat, very
poorly drained soil association that comprises approximately 46% of Jefferson County.
Topographic variation is relatively minor across this soil association, few natural drains occur,
and water stands for long periods after heavy rains. The fine-textured, clayey Beaumont soils
occur in wider and more nearly level areas of the association, whereas the silty Morey soils are
located on slightly higher areas (Crout et al. 1965).
As mapped, the project area is underlain by 2 separately mapped soil units—Ijam soils
(Im) and Neel clay, 2 to 5% slopes, occasionally flooded, tidal (NeA) (Crout et al. 1965). In
reality, these 2 soil series designations refer to the same soil type, dredge spoil banks situated
on lagoons, as mapped in 2 different soil surveys.
While aboriginal cultural resources are commonly encountered in deep alluvial
sediments adjacent to major streams in Texas, the relative antiquity of the fluviodeltaic clayey
sediments that constitute the soils on the coastal plain, such as those that comprise the area
surrounding the project area, and the extent of disturbance associated with original deposition of
the artificial dredge soils that underlie the project area proper, suggest that any cultural
resources would be constrained to the modern ground surface, rather than in buried contexts, in
erosional settings lacking integrity or be situated within disturbed, redeposited soil matrices.
Intact, buried archeological deposits may occur within intact alluvial sediments near major
streams, though no intact sediments are mapped within the current project area, and the only
streams in the vicinity of the APE are channelized canals. Historic-age cultural resources may
occur in any physiographic setting, though they are comparatively rare in the frequently flooded,
marshy environs of Southeast Texas.

2.3

CLIMATE

Evidence for climatic change from the Pleistocene to the present is most often obtained
through studies of pollen and faunal sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins 1995).
While the paleoclimatic history of the coastal region remains unclear, Bryant and Holloway
(1985) present a sequence of climatic change for nearby east-central Texas that includes
3 separate climatic periods—the Wisconsin Full Glacial Period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.), the Late
Glacial Period (14,000 to 10,000 B.P.), and the Post-Glacial Period (10,000 B.P. to present).
Evidence from the Wisconsin Full Glacial Period suggests that the climate in east-central Texas
was considerably cooler and more humid than at present. Pollen data indicate that the region
was more heavily forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods (Bryant and

8

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of 15 Levee Segments and
4 Outfall Locations on White’s Ranch, Jefferson and Chambers Counties, Texas

Holloway 1985). The Late Glacial Period was characterized by slow climatic deterioration and a
slow warming and/or drying trend (Collins 1995). In east-central Texas, the deciduous
woodlands were gradually replaced by grasslands and post oak savannas (Bryant and Holloway
1985). During the Post-Glacial Period, the east-central Texas environment appears to have
been more stable. The deciduous forests had long since been replaced by prairies and post
oak savannas. The drying and/or warming trend that began in the Late Glacial Period continued
into the mid-Holocene, at which point there appears to have been a brief amelioration to more
mesic conditions lasting from roughly 6000 to 5000 B.P. Recent studies by Bryant and
Holloway (1985) indicate that modern environmental conditions in east-central Texas were
probably achieved by 1,500 years ago.
The modern climate of the upper Texas coast is classified as subtropical humid (Abbott
2001; Larkin and Bomar 1983), forming a transitional zone between the humid southeastern US
and the semiarid to arid west. The climate reflects the influences of latitude, low elevation, and
proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, which combine with the urban heat islands formed by the
tremendous concentrations of asphalt and concrete in the larger cities, such as Houston and
Beaumont, to create a notorious modern climate that is oppressively warm and moist throughout
much of the year. As a result of proximity to the Gulf and the abundance of surface water,
humidity in the early morning can approach 100% even on cloudless summer days, and it often
exceeds 50% even on the warmest afternoons. Largely as a consequence of the relatively high
humidity characteristic of the region, temperature patterns exhibit a moderate annual range and
a modest diurnal range that increases slightly with distance from the coast. Average monthly
high temperature ranges from a low of 17 to 19°Celcius (°C) (59 to 63°Fahrenheit [°F]) in
January to a high of 38 to 40°C (89 to 96°F) in August. Average monthly lows range from 4 to
9°C (38 to 47°F) in January to 25 to 29°C (72 to 79°F) in July and August. Annually, average
low temperatures range from 15 to 21°C (56 to 65°F), and average high temperatures range
from 27 to 29°C (75 to 79°F) (Abbott 2001; Larkin and Bomar 1983).
The region experiences 2 precipitation peaks throughout the year (Abbott 2001; Crout et
al. 1965). The first occurs in the late spring (i.e., May to June) due to the passage of infrequent
cold fronts that spawn chains of powerful frontal thunderstorms. The second occurs in the late
summer to early autumn (i.e., August to September) due to the incidence of tropical storms and
hurricanes from the Atlantic and, occasionally, Pacific oceans. In contrast, winter and early
spring are relatively dry, and high summer rainfall is dominated by convectional thunderstorms
that are relatively brief and localized, albeit frequently intense. Average annual precipitation
varies from a low of approximately 100 cm centimeters (cm) (40 inches [in]) to a high of more
than 132 cm (52 in). Average monthly precipitation varies from less than 5 to 8 cm (2 to 3 in) in
March to more than 19 cm (7.5 in) occurring locally on the coast during September. Almost all
of the measurable precipitation falls as rain—snowfall is extremely rare, occurring in measurable
amounts in only 1 in 10 years.

2.4

FLORA AND FAUNA

Jefferson County is situated near the southeastern edge of the Texan biotic province
(Blair 1950), an intermediate zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

provinces and the grasslands of the Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces. Some
species reach the limits of their ecological range within the Texas province. McMahan et al.
(1984) further define 4 broad communities that characterize that portion of the Texas biotic
province that lies on the Gulf Coastal Plain: (1) coastal marsh/barrier island, (2) coastal prairie,
(3) coastal gallery forest, and (4) pine-hardwood forest (cf. Abbott 2001:24-26).
The coastal marsh/barrier island category includes well-drained, sandy, coastal
environments and saline and freshwater wetlands in the coastal zone (Abbott 2001:24). Marsh
vegetation is typical of areas that are seasonally wet and have substrates composed primarily of
sands and silts, clays, or organic decomposition products. Vegetation assemblages are
strongly controlled by texture, salinity, frequency and duration of inundation, and depth of the
seasonal water table. Sandy, relatively well-drained, freshwater environments are typically
dominated by little bluestem, switchgrass, Florida paspalum, and brownseed paspalum. Wetter
environments are often dominated by marshhay cordgrass, seashore saltgrass, saggitaria,
bulrushes, smooth cordgrass, seashore paspalum, seashore dropseed, olney bulrush,
saltmarsh bulrush, saltmarsh aster, longtom, sprangletop, burhead, arrowhead, coastal
waterhyssop, needlegrass rush, and other sedges and rushes. Slightly higher, better-drained
environments are characterized by such taxa as seashore saltgrass, seashore paspalum,
gulfdune paspalum, shoregrass, gulf cordgrass, red lovegrass, bushy sea-oxey, and glasswort.
A variety of fauna are characteristic of the shore zone. Important larger taxa include raccoon,
nutria, alligators, turtles, swamp rabbit, and many birds, including ducks, geese, herons, and
many smaller species. Aquatic taxa, including a wealth of fish and shellfish adapted to brackish
to hypersaline conditions, are also important in the coastal zone.
The coastal prairie category consists primarily of grasses with minor amounts of forbs
and woody plants in areas that are not saturated on a seasonal basis (Abbott 2001:24-26). This
community is characteristic of upland areas and grades into the pine-hardwood forest to the
north and east and into the coastal marsh/barrier island to the south. A wide variety of grasses
are found in the prairie environments, but the principal taxa include big bluestem, little bluestem,
indiangrass, eastern grama, switchgrass, brownseed paspalum, sideoats grama, silver
bluestem, buffalograss, threeawn, and Texas wintergrass. Common forbs include Maximilian
sunflower, Engelman daisy, blacksalmon, penstemon, dotted gayfeather, bundleflower, yellow
neptunia, snoutbean, prairie clover, tickclover, wildbean, western indigo, paintbrush,
bluebonnet, ragweed, croton, milkweed, vetch, verbena, and winecup. Woody plants occurring
in the coastal prairie include mesquite, honey locust, huisache, eastern baccharis, sesbania, live
oak, elm, hackberry, bumelia, and coralberry. The frequency of trees increases dramatically as
the coastal prairie grades into the pine-hardwood forest, forming an open woodland
environment with common stands of hardwood trees and occasional pines. The coastal prairie
is home to a diverse fauna, including coyote, white-tailed deer, skunks, cottontail rabbit, many
small rodents, amphibians, reptiles, and a variety of permanent and migratory birds. Bison and
pronghorn were also present at various times in the past.
The coastal gallery forest consists of diverse, principally deciduous trees and associated
understory in floodplains and streams that traverse the outer coastal plain (Abbott 2001:26).
Important taxa include water oak, pecan, poplar, American elm, cedar elm, sugarberry, ash,

loblolly pine, post oak, cherrybark oak, mulberry, swamp chestnut oak, willow oak, sweetgum,
hawthorn, dogwood, hickory, bois d’arc, sassafras cypress, willow, cottonwood, and sumac.
Shrubs and vines such as mustang grape, greenbrier, yaupon, coralberry, possumhaw,
elderberry, honeysuckle, dewberry, and blackberry are common in the understory, as are
grasses such as little bluestem, big bluestem, and indiangrass. The fauna of the gallery forest
include white-tailed deer, opossum, raccoon, squirrel, turkey, a variety of small mammals and
rodents, turtles, snakes, and many birds. Black bears were also present at various times in the
past, and a number of fish and a few varieties of shellfish are present in the streams.
The pine-hardwood forest is characterized by a mix of coniferous and deciduous trees,
including longleaf pine, shortleaf pine, loblolly pine, post oak, red oak, white oak, blackjack oak,
willow oak, and live oak (Abbott 2001:26). Riparian environments often support larger
deciduous trees like pecan, cottonwood, hickory, beech, and American elm. Understory
vegetation varies from relatively open to quite dense, and consists of shrubs, vines, forbs, and
young trees. Common shrubs include acacia, yaupon, mayhaw, wild persimmon, myrtle,
greenbrier, Virginia creeper, blackberry, dewberry, trumpet vine, gourd, and poison ivy. A
variety of fauna is also present, including white-tailed deer, opossum, raccoon, squirrel, rabbit,
mink, skunk, various small rodents, turtles, reptiles, and many different birds. Black bears were
also present at times in the past, and bison and pronghorn were occasionally present in the
transition zone to the coastal prairie environment.

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The project area is located within the Southeast Texas Archeological Region, a 21county area extending from the Colorado River on the west to the Sabine River on the east and
measuring about 200 km (124 mi) inland from the Gulf of Mexico coastline. Much of the
archeological record in Southeast Texas represents an interface between the Southern Great
Plains and the Southeastern Woodlands (Aten 1983, 1984; Patterson 1995; Story 1990).
Further distinctions are often made between the inland and coastal margin subregions of
Southeast Texas. These 2 subregions are somewhat culturally distinct, and the inland
subregion has a much longer chronological record. The coastal margin of Southeast Texas
comprises a zone about 25 km (16 mi) inland from the coast that covers the area influenced by
Gulf tidal flows on the salinity of streams, lakes, and bays. Considerable ecological variability
characterizes this subregion, including woodlands, coastal prairie, lakes, wetlands, marine
coastline, and barrier islands. The inland subregion also encompasses considerable ecological
diversity, including mixed woodlands, coastal prairies, and dense piney woods.
The human inhabitants of Southeast Texas practiced a generally nomadic hunting and
gathering lifestyle throughout all of prehistory. While many of the same labels are used to
denote Southeast Texas cultural/chronological periods, the timeframe and cultural
characteristics of Southeast Texas culture periods are often different than in neighboring
regions. For instance, the Archaic and Late Prehistoric time periods are different in Central and
Southeast Texas, and Central Texas lacks the Early Ceramic period that has been defined for
Southeast Texas.
Mobility and settlement patterns do not appear to have changed markedly through time
in Southeast Texas. Inland sites are usually found near a water source, usually exhibit
evidence of reoccupation through time, have well-defined intrasite activity areas, tend not to be
associated with satellite activity sites or separate base camps, and exhibit a range of
subsistence-related activities. Inland sites also tend to contain modest pottery assemblages,
fired clay balls (at some sites), abundant lithic material, and an absence of shell tools. Coastal
sites tend to consist of multicomponent Rangia shell middens that contain oyster shell tools,
large quantities of pottery (in later cultural components), numerous bone tools, and only a few
lithic artifacts.

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (10,000 TO 5000 B.C.)

The initial human occupations in the New World can now be confidently extended back
before 10,000 B.C. (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990;
Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans
were present in Eastern North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al.
1990), while more recent discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for
human occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer
et al. 1997). Most archeologists presently discount claims of much earlier human occupation
during the Pleistocene glacial period.
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Southeast Texas is
represented by the PaleoIndian period (10,000 to 5000 B.C.) (Patterson 1995). This stage
coincided with ameliorating climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that
witnessed the extinction of herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing
various periods within this stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often
fluted, lanceolate projectile points. These points are frequently associated with spurred endscrapers, gravers, and bone foreshafts.
PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized into egalitarian bands
consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic subsistence and settlement
pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence patterns in Southeast Texas
are known primarily through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence focused on the
exploitation of small animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the PaleoIndian period. There is
little evidence in this region for hunting of extinct megafauna, as has been documented
elsewhere in North America; rather, a broad-based subsistence pattern appears to have been
practiced during all prehistoric time periods.
In Southeast Texas, the PaleoIndian stage is divided into 2 periods based on
recognizable differences in projectile point styles (Patterson 1995). These include the Early
PaleoIndian period (10,000 to 8000 B.C.), which is recognized based on large, fluted projectile
points (i.e., Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Big Sandy), and the Late PaleoIndian
period (8000 to 5000 B.C.), which is characterized by unfluted lanceolate points (i.e., Plainview,
Scottsbluff, Meserve, and Angostura).

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (5000 B.C. TO A.D. 100)

The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend signaled the beginning of the Archaic stage
(5000 B.C. to A.D. 100) (Patterson 1995). This climatic trend marked the beginning of a
significant reorientation of lifestyle throughout most of North America, but this change was far
less pronounced in Southeast Texas. Elsewhere, the changing climatic conditions and
corresponding decrease in the big game populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a
diversified resource base composed of smaller game and wild plants. In Southeast Texas,
however, this hunting and gathering pattern is characteristic of most of prehistory. The
appearance of a more diversified tool kit, the development of an expanded groundstone
assemblage, and a general decrease in the size of projectile points are hallmarks of this cultural

14

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of 15 Levee Segments and
4 Outfall Locations on White’s Ranch, Jefferson and Chambers Counties, Texas

stage. Material culture shows greater diversity during this broad cultural period, especially in
the application of groundstone technology.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods.
In Southeast Texas, the Early Archaic period (5000 to 3000 B.C.) is marked by the presence of
Bell, Carrollton, Morrill, Trinity, Wells, and miscellaneous Early Stemmed projectile points. The
Bell point is the only type in this period that is closely associated with the Southern Plains.
Many of the latter point types continue into the Middle Archaic period (3000 to 1500 B.C.) and
several new types appear, including Bulverde, Lange, Pedernales, Williams, Travis, and
probably the Gary-Kent series.
The Late Archaic period (1,500 B.C. to A.D. 100) is
characterized by Gary, Kent, Darl, Yarbrough, Ensor, Ellis, Fairland, Palmillas, and Marcos
points.
In the western part of inland Southeast Texas, a Late Archaic mortuary tradition
developed in the lower Brazos and Colorado river valleys and in the intervening area (Hall 1981;
Patterson 1995). Organized burial practices actually started during the Middle Archaic period
but reached full development in the Late Archaic with the use of exotic grave goods such as
boatstones and bannerstones (probably used as atlatl weights), stone gorgets, corner-tang
knives, stingray spines, shark teeth, and marine shell beads and pendants. Other burial
practices included the systematic orientation of burial direction, body position, use of red ochre,
and use of locally made grave goods, such as longbone implements and bone pins. Most
burials are found in extended supine position, though some extended prone and bundle burials
are also known. Burial direction is usually consistent within single sites but varies from site to
site. Patterson et al. (1993) report that at least 11 sites are associated with this mortuary
tradition in Austin, Fort Bend, and Wharton counties.

3.3

EARLY CERAMIC PERIOD (A.D. 100 TO 600)

The use of pottery did not start uniformly throughout Southeast Texas. Pottery
manufacture appears to have diffused into this region from adjacent regions, primarily from the
east along the coastal margin. Aten (1983:297) argues that pottery was being manufactured on
the coastal margin of the Texas-Louisiana border by about 70 B.C., in the Galveston Bay area
by about A.D. 100, in the western part of the coastal margin by about A.D. 300, and in the
Conroe-Livingston inland area by about A.D. 500. The practice of pottery manufacture appears
to have progressed first along the coastal margin and then moved inland (Patterson 1995).
Southeastern Texas ceramic chronologies are best known in the Galveston Bay area, where
Aten (1983) established a detailed chronological sequence.
The earliest ceramic periods in the Galveston Bay and neighboring Sabine Lake areas
appear to be approximately contemporaneous with the earliest ceramic periods of the lower
Mississippi Valley (Aten 1984). Early assemblages contain substantial quantities of Tchefuncte
ceramics. In the Sabine Lake region, grog-tempered varieties of Baytown Plain and Marksville
Stamped are common, while grog-tempered ceramics do not occur in the Galveston Bay area
129 km (80 mi) to the west until several hundred years later. With the principal exception of a
few Tchefuncte ceramic types, other southern Louisiana ceramics are not found on the Gulf
coast west of the Sabine Lake area.

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Goose Creek sandy-paste pottery was used throughout Southeast Texas and somewhat
farther north in the Early Ceramic, Late Prehistoric, and the early part of the Historic periods
(Aten 1984; Patterson 1995; Pertulla et al. 1995). The Goose Creek series is the primary utility
ware throughout the prehistoric sequence in Southeast Texas, though it gives way to Baytown
Plain for about 200 years during the transition between the Late Prehistoric and Historic periods
before once again becoming predominant into the Historic period (Aten 1984). A minor variety,
Goose Creek Stamped, occurs only in the Early Ceramic period (Aten 1983). Three other minor
pottery types—Tchefuncte (Plain and Stamped), Mandeville, and O’Neal Plain variety Conway
(Aten 1983)—were used only during the Early Ceramic period. The Mandeville and Tchefuncte
types are characterized by contorted paste and poor coil wedging. Mandeville has sandy paste
(like Goose Creek), while Tchefuncte paste has relatively little sand. Given their technological
similarities, Mandeville and Tchefuncte may represent different clay sources rather than distinct
pottery types (Patterson 1995). The bone-tempered pottery that characterizes ceramic
assemblages elsewhere in Texas is not common in Southeast Texas.

3.4

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 600 TO 1500)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 600 to 1500) (Patterson 1995) is defined
by the appearance of the bow and arrow. Elsewhere in Texas, pottery also appears during the
latter part of the Late Prehistoric period, but, as already discussed, ceramics appear earlier in
Southeast Texas. Along the coastal margin of Southeast Texas, use of the atlatl (i.e.,
spearthrower) and spear was generally discontinued during the Late Prehistoric period, though
they continued to be used in the inland subregion along with the bow and arrow through the
Late Prehistoric period (Ensor and Carlson 1991; Keller and Weir 1979; Patterson 1980, 1995;
Wheat 1953). In fact, Patterson (1995:254) proposes that use of the bow and arrow started in
Southeast Texas as early as the end of the Middle Archaic period, using unifacial arrow points
that consisted of marginally retouched flakes. In contrast, Prewitt (1981) argues for a
generalized date of adoption of the bow-and-arrow hunting system at about the same time (ca.
A.D. 600) in Central and Southeast Texas. In Southeast Texas, unifacial arrow points appear to
be associated with a small prismatic blade technology. Bifacial arrow point types include Alba,
Catahoula, Perdiz, and Scallorn. A serial sequence for these point types has not been
established in Southeast Texas, though Scallorn points appear to predate Perdiz points
throughout the rest of Texas.
Grog- (i.e., crushed-sherd-) tempered pottery was used in the Late Prehistoric and
Protohistoric periods in Southeast Texas. The grog-tempered varieties include San Jacinto
Plain and Baytown Plain variety Phoenix Lake. San Jacinto pottery contains a relatively small
proportion of small-sized temper, while Baytown Plain has larger amounts of sherd pieces that
are often visible on vessel surfaces. As previously mentioned, sandy-paste Goose Creek
pottery remained in use throughout the Late Prehistoric period. Rockport Plain and Asphalt
Coated pottery from the Central Texas Coast (Ricklis 1995) are found at a few sites in
Southeast Texas during the Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric periods.

3.5

PROTOHISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 1500 TO 1700)

For the most part, Protohistoric and early Historic Indian sites in Southeast Texas have
not been articulated with the ethnographic record (Story 1990:258). Similarly, reconciling the
ethnographic record to prehistoric Indian groups in this region is problematic. Late Prehistoric
and Historic population movements further complicate this issue.
Aten (1983) has
reconstructed the territories of native groups present in this region in the early 18th century,
including the Akokisa, Atakapa, Bidai, Coco (possibly Karankawa), and Tonkawa. The
presence of the Tonkawa in Southeast Texas may be due to their rapid expansion from Central
Texas in the 17th and 18th centuries (Newcomb 1993:27). The Karankawa Indians are thought
to have occupied the coastal margin of this region as far east as Galveston Island and the
corresponding mainland (Aten 1983). Judging by the scarcity of Rockport pottery on sites east
of the San Bernard River, the ethnic association of the Karankawa Indians with the Coco tribe
may be in doubt.
Protohistoric and Historic Indian sites may not be systematically recognized as such
because few aboriginal artifact types changed from the Late Prehistoric to the Historic periods
(Patterson 1995). Only a few non-European artifact types are useful in identifying Historic
Indian sites, including Bulbar Stemmed and Guerrero arrow points and possibly Fresno and
Cuney points after A.D. 1500 (Hudgins 1986). Historic period Indian sites are usually identified
by the presence of glass and metal artifacts, gunflints, and European types of pottery.

3.6

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. A.D. 1700 TO PRESENT)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas occurred in 1519, when
Álvarez de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Álvar Núñez
Cabeza de Vaca crossed South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near
Galveston Bay; however, European settlement did not seriously disrupt native ways of life until
after 1700. The first half of the 18th century was the period in which the fur trade and mission
system, as well as the first effects of epidemic diseases, began to seriously disrupt the native
culture and social systems. This process is clearly discernable at the Mitchell Ridge site, where
the burial data suggest population declines and group mergers (Ricklis 1994), as well as
increased participation on the part of the Native American population in the fur trade. By the
time heavy settlement of Texas began in the early 1800s by Anglo-Americans, the indigenous
Indian population was greatly diminished. The Alabama/Coushatta Indians who currently reside
in Southeast Texas are migrants who were displaced from the east in the late 18th to early
19th centuries (Newcomb 1961).
The French and Spanish disputed ownership of the future county during the
18th century 1 . Spanish claims were based on the 1528 expedition of Álvar Núñez Cabeza de
Vaca, and French involvement began with La Salle in 1685. By 1730, French fur traders had

crossed the lower Sabine to trade with the Orcoquizas on the Trinity River; however, the area
that became Jefferson County was rarely visited by EuroAmerican traders because it was
bounded on the east by unfordable rivers and bayous and on the north by the Big Thicket. To
prevent French penetration, the Spanish established the San Agustín de Ahumada Presidio and
Nuestra Señora de la Luz Mission near the mouth of the Trinity in 1756. In 1777, Antonio Gil
Ibarbo conducted an expedition to investigate the English presence in Spanish territory, and, in
1785, José de Evia camped at Sabine Pass and mapped Sabine Lake and the Sabine and
Neches rivers. By 1803, when the US acquired Louisiana, the area of Jefferson County was
under Spanish control as part of the Atascosito District. In conjunction with filibustering efforts
to discourage Spanish shipping after 1816, the area provided a path for slave smuggling
between Louisiana, Point Bolivar, Jefferson County, and the Sabine River until the 1830s. The
pirate Jean Laffite maintained a slave barracks on the Sabine River 16 km (10 mi) north of the
present site of Orange to house black slaves in transit. In 1821, filibustering efforts ceased
when the Treaty of Córdova ended Spanish ownership in the region and made it part of Mexico.
Anglo-American colonization subsequently met both hostility and encouragement from the
Mexican government, as settlement efforts brought new families to the area from 1821 to 1836.
The first settlement within the confines of the present county, established at Tevis Bluff in 1824,
became the City of Beaumont. The area that became Jefferson County was included in the
Mexican Department of Nacogdoches as part of the Liberty Municipality in Lorenzo de Zavala’s
empresario grant of 1831. It later became part of the Jefferson Municipality. The Cow Bayou
settlement in this municipality, organized in 1835 and later known as Old Jefferson, became the
first county seat and the focal point of future growth in the county. Local volunteers took part in
the Texas Revolution, and other residents provided troop support.
Jefferson County, formed in 1836 and organized in 1837, was one of the original
counties in the Republic of Texas. It was named for the municipality that preceded it, which was
in turn named for Thomas Jefferson. The county’s boundaries, as delineated on 21 December
1837, included all of the future Orange County, a part of what later became Hardin County, and
the extreme eastern part of the future Chambers County. The first county seat, Jefferson, or
Old Jefferson, on the east bank of Cow Bayou, was replaced by Beaumont in 1838 and had
disappeared by 1845, when the site of Orange was surveyed. Orange was first called Jefferson
or New Jefferson. In 1836, Claiborne West, a signer of the Texas Declaration of Independence,
served as first postmaster and merchant at Old Jefferson. Another chief town was Sabine Pass,
laid out in 1839 with the backing of Sam Houston and Philip A. Sublett. Early settlers, primarily
from the lower South, were joined by Cajuns in the 1840s and by immigrants from the North and
from Europe in the 1850s. The area became an ethnic conglomerate. The Cajuns settled near
Taylor Bayou, and the Germans settled in the center of the county.
By the 1840s, shingle manufacture and timber exports supplemented a domestic
economy based on spinning, leatherwork, and soap and candle making. Shipbuilding, which
grew from the lumber industry before 1850, took place next to the lumber mills in Sabine Pass
and Beaumont. Steam-driven industry developed in 1846, and the first steam sawmill in
Beaumont was established in 1856. Jefferson County’s land was better suited to livestock
raising than to a cotton-based plantation economy. By 1820, Louisiana cattlemen drove herds
across the Sabine and Neches to graze on Gulf Coast saltgrasses, and a system of roads and

18

ferries running from east to west across the county was slowly put in place to support movement
of the herds. In the antebellum period, some cattlemen settled permanently and pursued their
livelihood alongside small farmers. Leather shops and tanneries developed in Beaumont in the
1840s, and shoe shops, saddleries, and exporters of hides and tallow followed in the 1850s.
Cotton-buying and ginning began by 1850 and increased with the arrival of the Eastern Texas
Railroad, though production in 1859 was only 84 bales and not much of the potential agricultural
land had been improved. Stephen L. Smith, the county’s most diversified planter in the 1840s,
raised corn, sweet potatoes, and rice. Early rice agriculture, the forerunner of the county’s
largest farm enterprise, produced 1,000 pounds in 1859. The Texas and New Orleans Railroad
from Houston to Orange and the Eastern Texas Railroad from Sabine Pass to Beaumont were
completed by 1861, but insufficient rail transportation and high freight rates limited antebellum
growth. Sabine Pass became a boomtown, stimulated by the Morgan Lines, which established
operations there before the Civil War. Four firms at Sabine shipped 20,000 bales of cotton
annually, and 300 vessels cleared the Sabine customhouse in 1859. Though the county was
prosperous in the 1850s, and resolution of the (Orange County) Regulator-Moderator War in
Jefferson County courts stabilized growth in that decade, Beaumont had only 4 commission and
forwarding houses, 4 dry-goods stores, 2 groceries, 2 hotels, and a population of 400 by 1858.
During the Civil War, Jefferson County residents voted 256 for and 15 against
secession. The county court voted to garrison a fort at Sabine Pass, Beaumont became a
concentration point for Confederate troops, a cantonment was established at Spindletop
Springs, and the county courthouse served as a hospital. Among the county’s several volunteer
groups, the Sabine Pass Guard was organized at Sabine Pass in April 1861 under the Texas
legislative act of 1858 that authorized the state militia. Beginning in 1862, federal troops burned
cavalry barracks near Sabine Pass, along with a railroad depot, sawmills, a planing mill, a sash
and door factory, and the palatial homes of D.R. Wingate and John Stamps. They also shelled
Sabine City, then suffering an epidemic of yellow fever. The Confederates reoccupied Sabine
Pass in January 1863, and the battle of Sabine Pass in September of that year ended federal
efforts to penetrate the interior via the Sabine. The war caused considerable losses, and farm
acreage and value declined, cotton exports fell, and the number of cattle in the county dropped
from 51,600 in 1862 to 40,000 in 1865.
Recovery from the war was slow. Jefferson County exports in 1867 of cotton, cattle,
beef hides, lumber, cypress shingles, and lumber products, including resin and turpentine,
constituted only about 1/4 of their prewar total. Sugar production between 1860 and 1880 was
limited, and significant agriculture did not develop again until after 1890. By 1876, however, the
county was once again a lumber and shipping center, as loggers used the Neches and Sabine
rivers to float logs to mills at Orange and Beaumont, where mills manufactured 82 million
shingles and 75 million board feet of timber by 1880. Exports, including pine for cross-ties and
bridges, made these towns major lumber centers by 1900. Four canal systems for irrigating rice
were built between 1898 and 1902, including the Port Arthur Rice and Irrigation Company,
McFaddin Canal Company, Jefferson County Irrigation Company (later renamed Beaumont
Irrigation Company), and Treadaway Canal Company (later renamed Neches Canal Company).
By 1904, 50,000 ac were under cultivation as mule power replaced ox teams.

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

After 1880, rail transportation increased significantly. The Texas and New Orleans (now
the Southern Pacific Transportation Company) built from Houston to Orange in 1860,
abandoned its Orange County track in 1863 and the line in 1867, and then rebuilt in 1876. This
railroad was linked to the Louisiana and Western, and through service was provided to New
Orleans in 1881. By 1881, service had also been reestablished by the East Texas Railway,
which was renamed the Sabine and East Texas and later became part of the Texas and New
Orleans. The Gulf, Beaumont and Kansas City Railway, constructed between 1893 and 1896,
ran at first neither to the Gulf nor to Kansas City, but only from Kirbyville to Beaumont. The Gulf
and Interstate developed in 1895, and the Beaumont, Sour Lake, and Western Railway between
1903 and 1904. Port Arthur, founded in 1895 by Arthur Edward Stilwell, was linked in 1895 by
the Kansas City Southern to Beaumont. Service to Kansas City finally came in 1897, when the
Sabine River bridge was completed. The Sabine-Neches or Port Arthur Ship Canal was
excavated in 1897 and 1898 from Sabine Pass to Port Arthur. It opened in 1899 and was
gradually extended to the mouths of the Neches and Sabine Rivers. The first oceangoing
vessel to call at Beaumont and Orange was the Nicaragua, which arrived in 1906. River depths
were increased to around 8 m (25 ft) by 1920, by which time the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway had
crossed the southern part of the county. Interurban service from Nederland to Beaumont and
Port Arthur linked those communities in 1913, and, by 1916, completion of the channel to
Beaumont from Port Arthur and the mouth of the Neches had further increased lumber exports.
Between 1900 and 1910, the population grew from 14,329 to 38,182. A major influx
followed the Spindletop oilfield’s opening in 1901, and the growth in the decade came almost
exclusively from the white population of Hardin, Tyler, Jasper, and Newton counties. Significant
Cajun French movement to Jefferson County began in 1910 when the boll weevil destroyed
cotton crops in parishes adjacent to Lafayette, Louisiana. Also, a small influx of Mexicans
reached Jefferson County beginning in 1917 and 1918 as refinery workers were drafted in
World War I. By 1920, the county’s population reached 73,120, nearly double the 1910 figure.
Spindletop transformed Beaumont into a major industrial center. Refineries, including
the Texas Company refinery of Joseph S. Cullinan and Arnold Schlaet (1902) and the Gulf Oil
Corporation (now Chevron) refinery were built at Port Arthur, Port Neches, and Beaumont.
During World War I, shipbuilding increased, and the Magnolia Petroleum Company (now
ExxonMobil) refinery on the Neches at Beaumont played an active role as a supplier for the war.
Between 1955 and 1960, the Texaco and Gulf refineries employed 5,000 to 6,000 workers, and,
by World War II, the Gulf refinery was the 14th largest refinery in the world. Farm tenancy,
which increased significantly in Jefferson County in the first decade of the 20th century, declined
briefly, but increased so much during the Great Depression that owners and tenant farmers
achieved almost equal numbers. By 1930, the average farm size had fallen to roughly 250 ac.
In the 1930s, however, despite the hardships experienced in many areas, Jefferson County was
one among several Texas counties that continued to prosper.
The county shipped
29,022,201 tons of materials through Beaumont, Sabine Pass, and Port Arthur in 1934 and in
the next year produced 1,304,495 barrels of crude petroleum, crops valued at $1,866,873, and
livestock valued at $1,511,061. In 1930, the county had 141 manufacturing establishments with
products valued at more than $297 million. In 1938, the county produced clay and shells and
raised 2.2 million bushels of rice on 40,000 ac of irrigated land as well as 1,000 bales of cotton,

corn, other feed crops, figs, and truck crops. Livestock totals included 100,000 beef cattle as
well as dairy cattle, hogs, poultry, sheep, and goats. In foreign and coastal trade, Beaumont
and Port Arthur shipped oil, cotton, lumber, and other products. Industries included oil refining,
ship building, rice milling, food processing, and the manufacture of machinery, chemicals,
garments, and crates. The Rainbow Bridge over the Neches River from Port Arthur to Orange
was completed in 1938; with a vertical clearance of 54 m (176 ft) over the water, it was the
South’s tallest highway bridge.
In the 1940s, 26% of Jefferson County’s farmers were tenant farmers. Because of the
importance of the rice and beef crops, the Texas Rice Improvement Association, Texas A&M
College, and the US Department of Agriculture established an experiment station for the
improvement of rice and pasture cultivation as a joint project at Pine Island. The world’s largest
synthetic rubber plant, Neches Butane Products Company (now Texaco Chemical), was built at
Port Neches in 1942. By 1949, the county had become highly industrialized and urbanized, with
6 oil refineries producing total daily capacities of more than one-half million barrels, 3 rice mills,
11 tank farms, and 14 producing oilfields. New industry arrived as plants were established for
the production of chemicals and petrochemicals. During World War II, the growth of
shipbuilding in the Sabine-Neches Waterway brought in such firms as Bethlehem Steel,
Gulfport, Weaver, Burton, and Jones and Laughlin. In the 1950s, the Spindletop field was still
active, Gulf Oil laid pipelines, oilmen developed a new field at Hillebrandt Bayou, and sulfur
mining began. The nickname applied to Orange, Port Arthur, and Beaumont, the “Golden
Triangle,” symbolized the close relationship that had grown up among the cities. Gulf State
Utilities Company supplied electric power for much of Southeast Texas and southern Louisiana.
In 1956, roughly 26 million tons of materials were shipped from the county’s inland ports,
including rice, cotton, rubber products, steel, sugar, flour, oil, and oil products. In 1960, the
economy continued to be based on significant agricultural production but was dominated by
Beaumont and Port Arthur, which together had become a commercial banking center and major
chemical and petroleum products manufacturer. Port Neches was the site of Atlantic, Gulf, and
Texaco refineries. By the 1970s, rice and cattle were the chief agricultural products, soybeans
had been introduced, and residents were employed in the petrochemical, shipbuilding, and
rubber industries.
In the 1980s, the county was one of the most densely populated in the state. Ninety-four
percent of its roughly 250,900 residents lived in urban areas. Manufacturing establishments
made products valued at more than $2 billion in a single year, and a total of 5,318 business
establishments operated countywide. In the early 1990s, Lamar University and Lamar
University-Port Arthur provided higher education in Jefferson County. A new county jail and a
new state prison, the Mark Stiles Unit, opened, and a new unit of the federal prison system was
under construction. The South Texas State Fair was held annually in October. Duck hunting
and saltwater fishing attracted sportsmen to the area. Tourists visited a restored boomtown at
Spindletop in Gladys City, a monument commemorating Richard Dowling’s Confederate victory
during the Civil War in Sabine Pass Battleground State Historical Park, and the Tex Ritter park
and memorial in Nederland. Annual events include the Heritage Festival at Nederland in March,
the Neches River Festival in Beaumont in April, the Beaumont Jazz Festival in July, Spindletop

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of 15 Levee Segments and
4 Outfall Locations on White’s Ranch, Jefferson and Chambers Counties, Texas

4.0 RESEARCH OBJECTIVES AND METHODOLOGY

The cultural resource survey described in this report was undertaken with 3 primary
research goals in mind:
1. To locate and record cultural resources occurring within the designated APE
2. To provide a preliminary assessment of the significance of these resources regarding
their potential for inclusion in the NRHP
3. To make recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their
NRHP assessments
The first of these goals was accomplished by means of a review of documentation on file
on the THC’s online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas, the National Park Service’s (NPS’s) online
National Register Information System (NRIS), the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL), the General Land Office (GLO), and the Texas State Historical Association’s and the
General Libraries at The University of Texas at Austin’s Handbook of Texas Online, as well as a
program of intensive survey of the project area. No cultural resources were documented as a
result of this survey, so the second and third of these goals were not pursued. The rest of this
chapter presents the methodological background for the current investigations and the specific
survey methods used in the field.

4.1

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Prior to conducting the archeological fieldwork, Horizon personnel reviewed existing
archival documentation to acquire information on (1) previous cultural resource investigations
conducted in the vicinity of the project area, and (2) any previously documented cultural
resource properties in or near the survey area. Based on this archival research, no previously
recorded archeological sites, shipwrecks, historic cemeteries, or listed NRHP historic properties
have been documented in the vicinity of the project area, and no prior cultural resource surveys
have been conducted within the APE.

4.2

SURVEY METHODS

Horizon conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the 15 earthen levee
segments proposed for reconstruction on July 1, 2008, and of the 4 outfall locations on

HJN 070196 WD

23

Chapter 4.0: Research Objectives and Methodology

March 30, 2009, to locate any cultural resource properties that potentially would be impacted by
the proposed construction project. All segments of the APE consisted of artificially elevated
ridges on the north bank of the GIWW composed of redeposited dredge spoil excavated
previously from the GIWW. Three channelized tributaries of the GIWW discharge into the
GIWW in the vicinity of some of the APE segments. At the time of the survey, the private
property on which the APE is situated consisted of rural agricultural land, primarily cattle
pastures, and GIWW frontage. Cutbanks observed along the north bank of the GIWW show
deep profiles of dense, clayey sediments. Vegetation consisted of various short to tall grasses,
weeds, and reedy marsh understory as well as scattered deciduous hardwood trees.
Moderately extensive erosion was evident in most segments of the APE. Aside from impacts
associated with the original construction of the dredge spoil piles that comprise the levee
system, the natural landscape appeared to be largely intact overall. Figures 2 to 6 present
representative images of the APE.
The APE was traversed by Horizon’s archeologists and the modern ground was
thoroughly inspected for evidence of historic and prehistoric cultural resources. As the majority
of the APE was covered in moderately dense undergrowth, the modern ground surface was
partially obscured in many areas, and ground surface visibility typically ranged from
approximately 30% to 50%. Furthermore, soils in this area are typically poorly drained, and
standing water was relatively common on the modern ground surface. Where present,
erosional gullies and stream cutbanks were examined for cultural resources, evidence of buried
paleosols, and other stratigraphic anomalies that might be indicative of past cultural activity.
The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) for block-area
cultural resource surveys state that 1 shovel test per 2 acres be excavated within project areas
of the size of the current project’s APE. The shovel testing density may be increased in areas
with higher probabilities to contain cultural resources, such as stream terraces, and decreased
in areas with low probabilities for cultural resources, such as heavily disturbed areas or upland
settings with minimal soil cover. For the current project, a minimum of 12 shovel tests would be
required in the approximately 9.92-ha (24.46-ac) APE. Horizon excavated a total of 65 shovel
tests within the APE, thereby exceeding the TSMASS requirements (Figures 6 to 11; Table 2).
In general, shovel tests measured approximately 30 cm (12 in) in diameter and were excavated
to a target depth of 1.0 m (3.3 ft) below ground surface, to the top of pre-Holocene deposits, or
to the maximum depth practicable, and all sediments were screened through 6.35-millimeter
(mm) (0.25-in) hardware cloth. In practice, all shovel tests were terminated at depths of 5 to
40 cm below surface (cmbs) due to the presence of dense shrink-swell clay sediments on and
near the modern ground surface. Specific shovel test data are summarized in Appendix A.
The TSMASS also require backhoe trenching in stream terraces and other areas with
the potential to contain buried cultural materials at depths below those that shovel tests are
capable of reaching (approximately 1.0 m [3.3 ft] below surface). The project area is located in
a marshy coastal setting setting, no alluvial sediments are mapped within the APE, and none
were observed during the field survey. Sediments encountered in shovel tests excavated during
the survey revealed extensive deposits of dense clay sediments composed of mixed, mottled
dredge spoil in surface and near-surface contexts. All sediments observed within the APE

exhibited clear signs of extensive prior disturbance and possess effectively no potential to
contain intact archeological deposits. Shovel testing is therefore considered to constitute an
adequate survey technique for identifying cultural resources within the APE. Stream crossings
within the APE are relatively ephemeral and consist of channelized canals and bayous. No
settings conducive to preservation of deeply buried cultural deposits were identified in the
project area.
During the survey, field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, landforms,
survey methods, and shovel test results. Digital photographs were taken, and a photographic
log was maintained. Horizon employed a non-collection policy for cultural resources.
Diagnostic artifacts (e.g., projectile points, ceramics, historic materials with maker’s marks) and
non-diagnostic artifacts (e.g., lithic debitage, burned rock, historic glass, and metal scrap) were
to be described, sketched, and/or photo-documented in the field and replaced in the same
location in which they were found. As no cultural resources were observed during the survey,
the collections policy was not brought into play.

4 Outfall Locations on White’s Ranch, Jefferson and Chambers Counties, Texas

5.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

White’s Ranch is proposing to reconstruct 15 existing earthen levee segments and
reconstruct and expand the levees at 4 outfall locations along the GIWW in Jefferson and
Chambers counties, just east of High Island, Texas, for purposes of restricting salt water
intrusion and restoring freshwater wet prairie systems inland of the GIWW. White’s Ranch, the
local landowner, is proposing to reconstruct 15 separate earthen levee segments along
approximately 3.1 km (1.9 mi) of the northern side of the GIWW, covering a total of
approximately 3.91 ha (9.64 ac), in areas where the old dredged material has been eroded
below an elevation of 1.5 m (5.0 ft) amsl. In addition, White’s Ranch is proposing to reconstruct
and expand existing levees at 4 outfall locations, including approximately 2.73 ha (6.74 ac) of
existing levees and 3.3 ha (8.08 ac) of levee expansions. The intent of the proposed project is
to restore an effective barrier to salt water intrusion, which should help to reverse the salinity of
the landward wet prairies over time and provide benefits to all wildlife in the area, as well as
facilitate the landowner’s use of the land for seasonal grazing and hunting.
The proposed project would entail reconstruction of 15 earthen levee segments and
reconstruction and expansion of levee segments at 4 outfall locations along the north bank of
the GIWW. The levee system begins at the confluence of the North Prong of Mud Bayou and
the GIWW and extends eastward approximately 9.2 km (5.7 mi) in isolated segments. The
proposed reconstructed levee segments would measure approximately 12 m (40 ft) in width
from toe to toe and 0.6 to 0.9 m (2.0 to 3.0 ft) in height above existing grade to achieve the
previous levee height of 1.5 m (5.0 ft) amsl. The APE of the proposed undertaking therefore
consists of approximately 3.91 ha (9.64 ac) along the 15 existing levee segments, 2.73 ha
(6.74 ac) of existing levees at the 4 outfall locations, and 3.3 ha (8.08 ac) of levee expansions at
the 4 outfall locations, for a total APE of 9.92 ha (24.46 ac).
Horizon conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the 15 earthen levee
segments proposed for reconstruction on July 1, 2008, and of the 4 outfall locations on
March 30, 2009, to locate any cultural resource properties that potentially would be impacted by
the proposed construction project. All segments of the APE consisted of artificially elevated
ridges on the north bank of the GIWW composed of redeposited dredge spoil excavated
previously from the GIWW. The APE was traversed by Horizon’s archeologists and the modern
ground was thoroughly inspected for evidence of historic and prehistoric cultural resources.
Horizon excavated a total of 65 shovel tests within the APE, thereby exceeding the TSMASS
requirements for a project area of this size.

Chapter 5.0: Results of Investigations

At the time of the survey, the private property on which the APE is situated consisted of
rural agricultural land, primarily cattle pastures, and GIWW frontage. Cutbanks observed along
the north bank of the GIWW show deep profiles of dense, clayey sediments. Vegetation
consisted of various short to tall grasses, weeds, and reedy marsh understory as well as
scattered deciduous hardwood trees. Moderately extensive erosion was evident in most
segments of the APE. Furthermore, soils in this area are typically poorly drained, and standing
water was relatively common on the modern ground surface. Aside from impacts associated
with the original construction of the dredge spoil piles that comprise the levee system, the
natural landscape appeared to be largely intact overall.
No cultural resources, historic or prehistoric, were identified within the APE as a result of
the survey.

6.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The archeological investigations documented in this report were undertaken with
3 primary management goals in mind:

•

Locate all historic and prehistoric archeological resources that occur within the
designated survey area.

•

Evaluate the significance of these resources regarding their potential for inclusion in
the NRHP.

•

Formulate recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their
NRHP evaluations.

At the survey level of investigation, the principal research objective is to inventory the
cultural resources within the APE and to make preliminary determinations of whether or not the
resources meet one or more of the pre-defined eligibility criteria set forth in the state and/or
federal codes, as appropriate. Usually, management decisions regarding archeological
properties are a function of the potential importance of the sites in addressing defined research
needs, though historic-age sites may also be evaluated in terms of their association with
important historic events and/or personages. Under the NHPA and the Antiquities Code of
Texas, archeological resources are evaluated according to criteria established to determine the
significance of archeological resources for inclusion in the NRHP.
Analyses of the limited data obtained at the survey level are rarely sufficient to contribute
in a meaningful manner to defined research issues. The objective is rather to determine which
archeological sites could be most profitably investigated further in pursuance of regional,
methodological, or theoretical research questions. Therefore, adequate information on site
function, context, and chronological placement from archeological and, if appropriate, historical
perspectives is essential for archeological evaluations. Because research questions vary as a
function of geography and temporal period, determination of the site context and chronological
placement of cultural properties is a particularly important objective during the inventory
process.

Chapter 6.0: Summary and Recommendations

6.2

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION IN THE NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC
PLACES

Determinations of eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP are based on the criteria presented
in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) in 36 CFR §60.4(a-d). The 4 criteria of eligibility are
applied following the identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of
location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and:
a. [T]hat are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history; or,
b. [T]hat are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or,
c.

[T]hat embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose
components may lack individual distinction; or,

d. [T]hat have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory
or history.

The first step in the evaluation process is to define the significance of the property by
identifying the particular aspect of history or prehistory to be addressed and the reasons why
information on that topic is important. The second step is to define the kinds of evidence or the
data requirements that the property must exhibit to provide significant information. These data
requirements in turn indicate the kind of integrity that the site must possess to be significant.
This concept of integrity relates both to the contextual integrity of such entities as structures,
districts, or archeological deposits and to the applicability of the potential database to pertinent
research questions. Without such integrity, the significance of a resource is very limited.
For an archeological resource to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, it must meet legal
standards of eligibility that are determined by 3 requirements: (1) properties must possess
significance, (2) the significance must satisfy at least 1 of the 4 criteria for eligibility listed above,
and (3) significance should be derived from an understanding of historic context. As discussed
here, historic context refers to the organization of information concerning prehistory and history
according to various periods of development in various times and at various places. Thus, the
significance of a property can best be understood through knowledge of historic development
and the relationship of the resource to other, similar properties within a particular period of
development. Most prehistoric sites are usually only eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under
Criterion D, which considers their potential to contribute data important to an understanding of
prehistory. All 4 criteria employed for determining NRHP eligibility potentially can be brought to
bear for historic sites.

6.3

SUMMARY OF INVENTORY RESULTS

The APE was traversed by Horizon’s archeologists, the modern ground surface was
thoroughly inspected for cultural resources, and a total of 65 shovel tests were excavated within
40

070196_arch_survey_report.docx

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of 15 Levee Segments and
4 Outfall Locations on White’s Ranch, Jefferson and Chambers Counties, Texas

the approximately 9.92-ha (24.46-ac) APE, thereby exceeding the TSMASS requirements for a
project area of this size. No cultural resources, historic or prehistoric, were identified within the
APE as a result of the survey.

6.4

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the results of the survey-level investigations on the White’s Ranch project area
documented in this report, no potentially significant cultural resources would be affected by the
proposed undertaking. No new cultural resources were identified in the remainder of the project
area as a result of intensive survey activities, and no previously documented cultural resources
are present in the vicinity of the project area that would be adversely affected by the proposed
undertaking.
In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, Horizon has made a reasonable and good faith effort
to identify historic properties within the APE. As no cultural resources were identified that meet
the criteria for listing on the NRHP according to 36 CFR 60.4, no further archeological work is
recommended in connection with the proposed undertaking. It is recommended that the
proposed project be cleared to proceed. However, in the unlikely event that any human remains
or burial furniture are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing
maintenance in the project area, even in previously surveyed areas, all work should cease
immediately and the USACE and Texas Historical Commission’s (THC) should be notified of the
discovery.
