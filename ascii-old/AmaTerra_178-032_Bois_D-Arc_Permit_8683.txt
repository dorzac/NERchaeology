Abstract
Cultural resource specialists from AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra), working
on behalf of the North Texas Municipal Water District (NTMWD) and their environmental
compliance subconsultant, Freese and Nichols, Inc. conducted intensive archeological
and historic resource surveys for proposed modifications to the Bois d’Arc Lake Raw
Water Pipeline portions of NTMWD’s previously surveyed and coordinated Bois d’Arc
Lake Project (BDL) just west of the community of Leonard in Fannin County, Texas. The
cultural resource survey was conducted to meet the BDL’s National Historic Preservation
Act (NHPA) and Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) compliance obligations. Cultural resource
staff surveyed a 4,500-foot-long reroute of the previously-surveyed and coordinated Raw
Water Pipeline that diverges from the original corridor. Archeologists, working under
Antiquities Permit 8683 conducted surface inspection and dug 31 shovel tests through
largely open, agricultural fields with shallow, upland-variety soils. Backhoe trenching was
not conducted due to the shallow nature of soils within the construction corridor. Two
historic-age archeological sites (41FN269 and 41FN270), both structural complexes with
minimal artifact assemblages, were recorded. These sites have archival and structural
indications that they have been occupied and used by various individuals at least back to
a 1936 Fannin County Highway map (the first depiction of structures) but both are in poor
condition, particularly within the impact footprint. Architectural historians evaluated the
project’s potential visual impacts within a 400-foot-wide indirect effects Area of Potential
Effects (APE). Along with the structural components of archeological Sites 41FN269 and
41FN270, portions of the Missouri-Kansas-and-Texas Railroad do lie within the indirect
effects APE. A structural complex within the impact corridor was determined to have
been built or brought to the area after 1996. None of these resources is recommended as
eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places or for designation as State
Antiquities Landmarks (SAL). The Principal Investigators recommend that the proposed
Raw Water Pipeline reroute will have no adverse effect on Historic Properties and/or
SALs and should proceed with no further cultural resource coordination required under
the NHPA or the ACT. All project-generated notes, forms, photographs, and other materials
will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas.
This report is offered in partial fulfillment of TAC Permit 8683.

Introduction
This report summarizes the results of an intensive cultural resource survey associated
with North Texas Municipal Water District’s (NTMWD’s) proposed changes to the Raw
Water Pipeline component of the Bois D’Arc Lake Project (BDL) west of the community
of Leonard in Fannin County, Texas (Figures 1 and 2). The current survey investigated a
relatively small segment of the project’s Raw Water Pipeline near its western terminus
at the BDL’s Terminal Storage Reservoir (TSR), where engineers have selected a revised
installation corridor that diverged from the previously evaluated and coordinated
corridor. At less than a mile in length, the revised Raw Water Pipeline corridor is very
small when compared with the previously surveyed and coordinated overall project (see
Davis et al. 2016). The results of this survey are intended to supplement the findings
from the previous investigation and contribute to Clean Water Act and Antiquities Code
of Texas (ACT) regulatory coordination. Cultural resource investigators recommend that
the proposed reroute design will not likely impact significant cultural resources and
therefore should proceed with no Historic Properties or State Antiquities Landmarks
(SALs) impacted.

Description of Proposed Project

Engineers have elected to modify a 4,500-foot (1,370 meters (m)) segment of the previously
surveyed and coordinated new raw water inlet pipeline that leads from the original
corridor’s crossing at the Missouri-Kansas-and-Texas (MKT) Railroad northwest then
west to a new terminus at the project’s previously-surveyed—but not constructed—TSR.
Current designs indicate the new inlet pipeline will be 90–96-inch (2.3–2.4 m) diameter
pipe. The large-diameter pipe will be installed primarily using open-cut trenching
to a bedding (bottom) depth of 13–23 feet (3.6–7.0 m) below the ground surface. The
proposed revised pipeline corridor is located on NTMWD-owned property (or privatelyowned properties that NTMWD intends to own) with a proposed 120-foot-wide limit of
construction (100-foot permanent easement and 20-foot temporary easement).

Area of Potential Effects

The Area of Potential Effects (APE) for direct effects is defined as the final proposed
120-foot-wide limit of construction along the full 4,500-foot reroute length. This
calculates to approximately 12.4 acres of proposed direct impacts extending to the
maximum trench depth of 23 feet (approximately 383,000 cubic yards/293 cubic meters
of total impact volume). Though the pipeline will be installed entirely below the ground
surface, AmaTerra evaluated a 400-foot-wide potential indirect effects APE, centered on
the pipeline centerline (200 feet on either side).

As stated above, the Raw Water Pipeline reroute is part of a larger, previously-coordinated,
and surveyed project (TAC Permit 6626; Davis et al. 2016), portions of which overlap
the currently-proposed reroute corridor. Of particular note, the westernmost 125 meters
(410 feet) of the proposed pipeline corresponds with the project’s TSR, the projectrelated effects of which have already been assessed and coordinated relatively recently.
Accordingly, that segment was not evaluated again.

Regulatory Framework and Management Summary

The pipeline reroute is part of the larger Bois D’Arc Lake Project, which includes Clean
Water Act permitting through the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE; Tulsa
District). Accordingly, it is subject to Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation
Act of 1966 (as amended; Section 106). In addition, the pipeline will be constructed on
lands owned by NTMWD, a political subdivision of the State of Texas, making the project
also subject to the ACT. Archeological and historic resource surveys were completed
for compliance with both ACT as well as Section 106 with all archeological fieldwork
conducted under Antiquities Permit 8683. No artifacts were collected during the course
of the field survey; however, all forms, photographs, notes, and other field-generated
materials will be permanently curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL) in Austin in compliance with the requirements of Antiquities Permit 8683.

Administrative Matters

Mason D. Miller served as the project’s archeological Principal Investigator with Mary
Galindo serving as the Field Director and Project Archeologist. Additional archeological
survey crew included William Pratt, Megan Veltri, and Robert Beckwith. Non-archeological,
historic-age resources were photographed during the archeological survey then
interpreted by Kurt Korfmacher. Vanessa Cragle and Joel Butler assisted with GIS analysis
and map production. Amy Goldstein interpreted archival real estate and census records
to expand on site interpretations. Margo Gregory completed all document production
and formatting. The field survey was conducted during the week of December 17, 2018.

Environmental Setting
The project runs through Fannin County, which falls within the Northern Blackland Prairie
ecoregion (Omernik and Griffith 2009). The Northern Blackland Prairie is characterized
by rolling hills and flat plains underlain by limestone, chalk and shale beds of Cretaceous
age (Omernik and Griffith 2009, Stahl and McElvaney 2012). The average annual rainfall is
approximately 35–45 inches (Stahl and McElvaney 2012). The Blackland Prairies region
was historically characterized as a prairie consisting of tall grasses, productive soils, and
gentle topography, however currently much of the region is comprised of crop land and
other agriculture activities (Texas Parks and Wildlife 2018).

The Northern Blackland Prairie ecoregion is dominated by mid to tall grasses such as
little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii), Indian
grass (Sorghastrum nutans), tall dropseed (Sporobolus asper), eastern gamagrass
(Tripsacum dactyloides), and switch grass (Panicum virgatum), which are the natural
vegetative species for this environment (Omernik and Griffith 2009). In addition, pecan
(Carya illinoinensis), hackberry (Celtis laevigata), elm (Ulmus sp.), eastern cottonwood
(Populus deltoides), and bur and Shumard oak (Quercus macrocarpa and shumardii) are
often observed within the low flat woodlands along streams located within the Northern
Blackland Prairie. Since the nineteenth century, human land modifications along with
ranching/grazing activities have resulted in a dramatic increase in other flora species
(e.g., mesquite, ash juniper and eastern red cedar) (Stahl and McElvaney 2012). Today
the area is associated most strongly with cropland (Frye et al. 1984).

According to Collins (1995), geographically the region is characterized as an area of low
topographic relief and poor drainage that is prone to frequent flooding, conditions that
were prevalent at the time of the current survey (see Chapter 5). Archeologists observed
fallow and active croplands throughout the survey corridor and very little topographic
relief. Standing water observed particularly within the western half of the survey corridor
was a testament to the dense, sticky clays and poor drainage of the area.
Richard B. Thomas, who owned one of the parcels on which the current cultural resource
survey took place, wrote a series of letters between 1852 and 1853 shortly after emigrating
to the area that have been transcribed on the Fannin County Historic Commission’s
website (FCHC 2019). The letters enthusiastically describe the landscape, vegetation,
crops, and wildlife of the area. In a letter dated August 8, 1852, that he wrote from nearby
Bonham, Richard Thomas boasted of beautiful lands and abundant water in the area.
Included among the animals he reported were “...bear, panther, wolves, wild horses, foxes,
and [a] number of Prairie chickens and turkeys.” He would go on to say, “We have far the
best crops of corn this year… Wheat and oats very good and sweetpotatoes [sic]… grow so
large that a person can sit on one end and roast the other with convenience…”

Soils and Geology
The proposed survey area is centered along the north/south-trending Lee Creek just south
of the MKT Railroad where it meets US Highway 69. According to the Geologic Atlas of
Texas (USGS 2018), the entire project footprint overlies Late-Cretaceous-era Gober Chalk
and Roxton Limestone (Kgc) geology. Recorded soils (USDA-NCSS 2018) primarily consist
of a broad sheet of ancient, dense, upland clays derived from chalk residuum including
Fairlie-Dalco (FdB), Fairlie (FaA), and Howe-Whitewright (HwC) varieties (Figure 3).
Each of these soils consists of a shallow (generally 20-50 centimeters) Holocene zone
overlying dense subsoils. A band of Tinn clay (Tc) follows the Lee Creek channel that
traverses the APE.
Waterways (such as Lee Creek) typically correspond with deeper, Holocene soils
generated from erosion in the channels’ upper limits that are carried downstream and
re-deposited in floodplains. Topographic maps indicate that the Raw Water Pipeline’s
crossing at Lee Creek is within an erosional and not a depositional context. Archeological
survey confirmed that all of the soils in the channel vicinity were in situ and often scoured
by drainage rivulets leading to Lee Creek (Figure 4). Backhoe trenching would not be
necessary in this context to fully assess cultural resource-bearing deposits.

Cultural Background
Prehistoric Cultural Background
The project area is situated within the North-central Texas Archeological Region (Perttula
2004:7). Although still poorly understood because of the lack of excavations conducted
on well stratified and intact archeological sites within the region, there are three
periods that have most succinctly been defined by Dan Prikryl (1990) in his synthesis
of geomorphology and archeology along the Elm Fork of the Trinity River. They are the
Paleoindian period, the Archaic, and the Late Prehistoric, described in further detail
below.

Paleoindian Period

The first undisputed evidence of human habitation in North America is known as the
Paleoindian period and dates from 11,500–8000 BP in north-central Texas and the
Southern Great Plains (Prikryl 1990; Hofman 1989:29–45; Story 1990). Similarly, the
Paleoindian period dates from 11,500–8500 BP in central Texas (Collins 1995) where a
higher number of well-stratified sites have been recorded. The close of the Pleistocene
period is characterized by small bands of nomadic big game hunters with a lithic
technology consisting of Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, Scottsbluff, Golondrina, and Plainview
projectile points (Black 1989). Several sites dating to the Paleoindian Period are found
throughout north-central Texas. One of the oldest Paleoindian sites in this region is
arguably the Aubrey Clovis Site (41DN479), located in Denton County, Texas. The Aubrey
Clovis Site has been carbon dated to 11,550 BP (Ferring 2001). A wide variety of lithic
material, which originated in distant locations, was found at 41DN479 under roughly
eight meters of alluvium on the Elm Fork floodplain.

Archaic

The Archaic Period immediately follows the Paleoindian Period and is typically divided
into the Early, Middle, and Late Archaic subperiods. Generally, the Archaic Period is
characterized by a more intensive reliance on local floral and faunal resources. The
Archaic period in north-central Texas is tentatively dated between 8500–2700 BP
(Prikryl 1990). The Archaic period saw an increase in the number of projectile point
styles (Collins 1995). The archeological record also suggests a heavier reliance on food
processing and a wider variety of site functions, as well as more localized geographic
distributions of artifacts. Increasingly complex settlement systems, increased population
sizes, gradually decreasing mobility, and development of distinct group territories define
the Archaic period in north-central Texas (Prikryl 1990). These circumstances may have

Cultural Resource Survey of Proposed Reroutes to the No. Texas Municipal Water District’s

compelled Archaic populations of the Cross Timbers and prairie areas of north central
Texas to diversify hunting and gathering strategies based on bottomland resources of the
rivers and tributaries, and bison hunting along the plains (Hofman 1989). Archeological
endeavors along the West Fork of the Trinity River suggest that primary contexts for Early
and Middle Archaic sites are likely to be identified only under deeply buried deposits of
floodplain alluvium (Peter and McGregor 1988; Yates and Ferring 1986).

Early Archaic

Prikryl (1990) dates the Early Archaic from approximately 8500–6000 BP and suggests
a lack of regional differences in terms of adaptive patterns during this time. In the North
Texas region, subsistence data during the Early Archaic is scarce (Ferring and Yates 1997)
and of high integrity. Early Archaic projectile point styles in north-central Texas included
early split-stemmed varieties and possibly Angostura (Prikryl 1990; Story 1990). The
dwindling megafauna populations led to a shift in focus from large game to smaller game
such as deer, fish, and plant material (Black 1989).

Middle Archaic

The Middle archaic dates roughly from around 6000–3500 BP and the climate shift to a
warmer drier climate that began in the Early Archaic continued to persist into the Middle
Archaic, although as the Middle Archaic continued conditions became more mesic (Albert
and Wyckoff 1984), leading to the development of the Cross Timbers physiographic
region (Prikryl 1990). Prikryl’s (1990) research into the archeological data from the
lower Elm Fork of the Trinity River reveals that all Middle Archaic sites recorded prior to
1990 were situated on the first terrace above stream flood plains, with 55 percent along
the Elm Fork itself. This settlement pattern suggests that Middle Archaic peoples utilized
terraces along major drainages. Additionally, Prikryl’s studies revealed a complete lack
of burned rock middens in the lower Elm Fork region. Projectile points commonly found
in the lower Elm Fork region include Carrollton, Wells, and the Basal-Notched group that
includes Calf Creek, Bell, and Andice points (Prikryl 1990). The climate may have been
drier, and that the homogeneity of artifact types with adjacent regions might indicate that
Middle Archaic groups participated in broader cultural interactions (Ferring and Yates
1997:305).

Late Archaic

Prikryl places the Late Archaic period from 3500–1250 BP and observes at least three
increases in site frequency relative to the Middle Archaic period (1990). The Late Archaic
in the north central Texas region is characterized by an increase in the number of sites, a
greater distribution of sites over the landscape, and decreased mobility (Prikryl 1990).
Ferring (1986) suggests that the climate during the Late Archaic was even more mesic
than in the previous Early and Middle Archaic periods. It has also been hypothesized
that population densities increased dramatically during the Late Archaic, possibly due to
10

changing environmental conditions, new subsistence strategies, technological innovations,
reduced group mobility, or the increased accumulation of cultural knowledge. However,
as groups began to specialize in the procurement of resources available, mobility and
cultural interactions with neighboring groups may have decreased. This may be indicated
in the more diverse tool technologies and subsistence patterns. Projectile point style
varieties show an increase. Projectile points characterizing a Late Archaic component
include Ellis, Ensor, Palmillas, Yarbrough, Kent, and Gary points. Other styles include
Castroville, Elam, Dallas, Edgewood, Godley, Marshall, and Trinity points (Prikryl 1990;
Story 1990).

The lithic material used for tool manufacture in the Late Archaic suggests a decrease
in group mobility as compared to earlier periods (Skinner 1981; Prewitt 1983). Prikryl
(1990) found that 62 percent of the projectile points found within his area of study
(the Lower Elm Fork) were made from materials obtained locally, specifically Ogallala
quartzite. Smaller game and plant materials continued to be an important component
to Late Archaic subsistence strategies (Brownlow et al. 1999). Late Archaic deposits
along the Denton Creek drainage indicate an increased reliance on freshwater shellfish,
suggesting a possible decreased availability of large game, decreasing territory size, or
resource specialization (Anthony and Brown 1994).

Late Prehistoric

The beginning of the Late Prehistoric period in the upper Trinity River basin falls roughly
between 1300–250 BP. Research at Lake Ray Roberts suggests that regional exchange
of technological information, rather than environmental change, likely explains the
shift from Late Archaic lifeways to Late Prehistoric (Ferring and Yates 1997:305). Both
Lynott (1977) and Prikryl (1990) agree on the division of the Late Prehistoric into an
early and late phase based on arrow point and ceramic technologies. The early phase
dates from 1300–800 BP and reflects a continuation of the foraging subsistence system
of the preceding Late Archaic. Assemblages are characterized by sand and grog tempered
ceramics and by Scallorn, Steiner, Catahoula, and Alba arrow points (Lynott 1977;
Prikryl 1990). The introduction of the bow and arrow enabled prehistoric hunters to
harvest prey from greater distances more safely, and required less room to maneuver
than atlatls so hunters could conceal themselves in brush. Similarly to other temporal
periods, known sites appear to have occurred on terraces, although roughly one-third
are known to be situated on the floodplain. The climate is also believed to have become
drier around 1000 BP (Prikryl 1990). Climate stress and the presence of ecotones may
have contributed to the large numbers of sites located on the Cross-Timbers/Blackland
Prairie boundary. Prikryl argues that the regionalization observed during the early phase
of the Late Prehistoric shifts to one of greater mobility or trade with neighboring groups
(Prikryl 1990).
The late phase reflects Southern Plains influences and occurred from 750–250 BP
(Prikryl 1990). It is associated with the appearance of Nocona Plain ceramics of the
Henrietta focus, unstemmed triangular points (Fresno, Maud, Washita, and Harrell), and

the Perdiz point (Lynott 1977; Prikryl 1990). This period also exhibits some evidence
of horticulture and bison procurement. As bison herd sizes increased, hunter gatherers
became more reliant on them for subsistence (Baugh 1986; Prewitt 1981; Suhm 1957;
Yates 1982). In north-central Texas, this phase demonstrates prominent influence from
settled agricultural peoples to the north and east. House structures, roasting pits, Alba
points, burned corn, and grog-tempered ceramics were documented at sites in the region
indicating significant adaptive transitions during the middle of the Late Prehistoric period
(Peter and McGregor 1988).

Historic Background

Europeans entered Texas starting around AD 1528, but visited only sporadically, and did
not settle there until around AD 1700 (Webb 1952). In response to the continuous threat
of Apache and Comanche raiders, as well as the French incursion into East Texas, the
Spaniards erected a series of missions and presidios in Texas during the eighteenth century.
Eventually, the newly independent Mexican government began granting impresario
contracts to allow more prominent Anglo settlement to facilitate development. Stephen
F. Austin, one such settler, eventually spearheaded a movement by Anglo and Mexican
settlers against Mexican authority and towards independence.
Anglo American settlers first came to present-day Fannin County in the mid 1830s to
lay claim to land grants offered by the Mexican - and later the Texas - government. Two
colonies were formed in these early years: one on the Red River and another on Bois d’
Arc Creek near what would become Bonham (Pigott 2019). In December 1837, Fannin
County was formed by the Texas legislature, though its present-day boundaries were not
drawn until 1846. Early settlers often clashed with local Native Americans. Continuous
Indian raids in the late 1830s and early 1840s forced many settlers into or nearby one of
three protective forts in the county: Fort Warren, Fort Inglish, and Fort Lyday (Strickland
1930). The Treaty of Bird’s Fort, signed in 1846 largely ended hostilities (Pigott 2019).
In the decades leading up to the Civil War, Fannin County remained relatively sparsely
populated, reaching a population of 9,217 by 1860. The local economy relied on agriculture,
particularly cattle, corn, and cotton (Pigott 2019). Fannin County grew quickly from the
end of the Civil War to the beginning of the twentieth century. Immigration from other
states (particularly southern states), increased during this time, especially after the first
railroad was built in Fannin County in 1873. This was the Transcontinental division of
the Texas and Pacific Railroad that extended from Texarkana west to Fort Worth (Hymer
2019).

The current project is located in southwestern Fannin County, which was very sparsely
populated until the late nineteenth century. This area was historically surrounded by
Wildcat Thicket to the south and Bois d’ Arc Thicket to the north, which made the prairie
between difficult to access. Moreover, the thickets attracted fugitives and outlaws (Hymer
2010). The railroad’s arrival in southwestern Fannin County in the 1870s and 1880s
made it much more accessible and attractive to settlers. Construction on the Denison and
12

Southeastern Railroad began in 1877 in Denison and reached its terminus in Mineola in
1880 (Hymer 2019). This passenger rail line, which was sold to the Missouri, Kansas, and
Texas Railroad in 1889, became southwest Fannin County’s connection to larger Texas
cities and to the rest of the country.

The town of Leonard, which lies approximately one mile east of the project area, was
founded in 1880 to be a stop on the new Denison and Southeastern Railroad. The heirs
of Solomon L. Leonard, who owned the property where the town was to be located,
negotiated with the railroad to auction off part of their land as town lots. The auction
took place at the newly established town square on July 22; within a week Mark Daniels
opened the first business in Leonard, a saloon (Hymer 1986). By 1885 the town had 350
residents and a number of thriving businesses and social institutions, including nine
stores, three blacksmiths, two hotels, two doctors, two lawyers, a gin, a school, and a
church (Hymer 2010). The town’s first newspaper, the Leonard Graphic was established
in 1890 and continues to publish on a weekly basis today (LPL 2005).

By the turn of the twentieth century, Leonard had grown to around 1,000 people and
included several businesses, churches, and even a small college that operated from 18941914 (Figure 5). Throughout the twentieth century the economy remained centered
around agriculture, especially cotton. By the mid 1970s, however, cotton crops began
to fail and by the late 1980s wheat, grain, sorghum, and cattle ranching had become
the mainstays of local economy (Hymer 2010). The author (Miller) remembers his
grandfather, a Leonard resident in life, harvesting such crops with a combine in many
fields surrounding the community and off loading the yield at grain elevators in town in
the mid-1980s.

In the summer of 1875, Elders S. Marshal, N.A. Rogers, and T.P. Reece organized the
Thomas Glade Church, the first Baptist church in the vicinity, approximately one mile west
of Leonard within the Thomas Glade School House. By 1882 the church and the school
house building were moved into the new town of Leonard, becoming the community’s
first school (LPL 2005:33). According to a map included in The History of Leonard, Texas
Volume II (LPL 2005:rear inside cover), the original school house site was located roughly
opposite the MKT railroad from the current project corridor between the rail line and
present-day US 69 (roughly in the vicinity of the “Yahweh Street” label on Figure 1). A
review of aerial photographs and maps going back to 1936 did not result in identifying
any references to the church or the school in this location, therefore it is unclear if this
was located elsewhere. A mid-to-late twentieth-century housing development now
occupies the depicted church and school site and no remnants of such an occupation
were observed within the survey corridor.

Previously Recorded Cultural Resource Information
Previously Recorded Sites and Surveys

According to the Texas Historical Commission’s Online Sites Atlas (Atlas 2018), no
National Register-listed properties or districts, Official Texas Historical Markers (OTHMs),
or historic-age cemeteries are located within 500 meters of the current survey footprint
(Figure 6). A recorded historic-age cemetery and two markers are, however, located
in the western outskirts of Leonard, 1,000 meters from the project area. Atlas records
indicate that archeologists from AR Consultants surveyed a large area in the immediate
vicinity of the currently-proposed survey in 2014 for the main Lower Bois D’Arc Creek
Reservoir Pipeline Project (Antiquities Permit 6626). This survey also included evaluating
the original raw water pipeline corridor, the western terminus of which is now being
revised under the currently-proposed survey. In addition, the Atlas depicts a 1976 survey
on behalf of the Soil Conservation Service along the lowlands surrounding Lee Creek,
while two isolated area surveys were also conducted on behalf of the SCS to the southeast
in 1984. Finally, one segment of a 1982 EPA/Texas Department of Water Resources
survey extends northeast of the project footprint toward US 69, while the remaining two
segments skirt the eastern edge of a 1,000-meter project buffer. No other surveys have
been conducted nearby.
Three archeological sites were recorded in the currently-proposed project vicinity
(1,000 m) during the 2014 AR Consultants investigation (41FN172-41FN174; see
Figure 6). Each of the sites is historic-aged with no prehistoric components with most
composed of surface scatters of equipment and minimal historic-age artifacts, cisterns,
and outbuilding remnants typical of late nineteenth to early twentieth century farmsteads.
All of the sites were recommended as Not Eligible for listing on the National Register of
Historic Places.

Historic-Age Map and Aerial Imagery Interpretation
Although general due to the significant scale discrepancy between the proposed
survey corridor and its original size, a 1936 Fannin County Highway map does depict
two structures south of County Road (CR) 4960 near the proposed pipeline’s midpoint
(Figure 7). These structures likely correspond with Sites 41FN269 and 41FN270, recorded
during the current survey. An aerial photograph and a USGS topographic map dating to
1964 depict a survey footprint that is largely devoid of structures, with the exception of
two possible structures and structural complexes south of and adjacent to CR 4960, within
the proposed raw water pipeline APE (Figure 8). These complexes correspond with the
same archeological sites recorded during this survey. Of particular note, one structural
complex north of CR 4960 appeared to potentially be of historic age from modern aerial
photography. The complex, a mobile home and surrounding outbuildings (see Chapter
5), was investigated during the current survey but was found through post-field aerial
photograph review to have been brought to the area some time after 1996 (Figure 9).

Field Methods
Cultural resource investigations generally followed the prescribed minimum standards
for linear projects of this type. Archeologists conducted an intensive linear survey along
the proposed impact corridor, supplemented with subsurface shovel tests. Because the
archeological survey overlapped virtually all of the project’s indirect effects APE, and
because so much of that corridor was open, agricultural fields, architectural historians
utilized field data gathered by the archeology crew to view the potentially-affected nonarcheological resources, then evaluated the project’s effects on those cultural resources
separately from the archeological analysis.

Archeological Pedestrian Survey Methodology

During the archeological component of the investigations, archeologists adhered to the
Council of Texas Archeologists’ (CTA’s) minimum standards for 100% intensive survey of
linear projects with a 120-foot-wide corridor, surveying along two linear transects and
excavating a shovel test at opportune locations along the corridor at roughly every 100
meters (Figure 10). Shovel test frequency was increased or decreased depending on field
conditions, archeological probability, and evidence of previous disturbance. For instance,
additional tests were placed on either terrace of the pipeline’s crossing at Lee Creek. Each
shovel test was excavated by hand in roughly 20-centimeter levels to: 1) the predetermined
maximum depth of 80 centimeters, 2) to clearly visible, sterile subsoil or bedrock, or 3) to
evidence of disturbance; whichever was reached first. Soils were screened through ¼-inch
hardware cloth whenever possible, though recent heavy rains, coupled with dense sticky
clays dictated that most soils were hand-sorted instead. Non-site shovel test locations
and observations were recorded on standardized logs and mapped using handheld GPS
units. Each test record included observations for topographic location, soil stratigraphy,
evidence of disturbance, and any artifacts observed. Once recording was complete, each
test was immediately backfilled.

Archeological Site Recording
Once identified, archeological field crews recorded sites following standard recording
protocols outlined in the THC’s Archeological Survey Standards within the framework
of on-site conditions. Field notes and photographs were collected while site data was
recorded on standardized TexSite forms. Site boundaries (both horizontal and vertical)
were defined through subsurface tests, extent of surface deposits, and/or topographic
observation. Sites were ‘chased’ outward beyond the survey corridor in an effort to
identify boundaries or estimated by property lines if the site was largely a structural
complex. Locational information (features, fencelines, shovel tests, etc.) were recorded
within sites using a combination of compass and pace, hand-drawn maps and the handheld GPS units.
In accordance with the accepted research design, no artifacts were collected during
field survey. When observed, all artifacts (or a representative sample thereof) were
recorded through field notes, drawings, and/or photographs then returned to their find
location. Historic-age sites recorded along the proposed Raw Water Pipeline were further
investigated through archival research and historic aerial photograph overlays.

Historic Structures Analysis Methods

Using standards accepted by the THC, AmaTerra staff established a cut-off date for historic
age resources (determined as those being 50 years or older) of 1966. The archeological
survey team photographed all structures and structural complexes within the 400-footwide indirect effects APE from at least two perspectives and took additional representative
photographs of the surrounding landscape and viewshed at various locations along the
corridor. With no above-ground project components proposed as part of this specific
reroute corridor, no additional viewshed analysis was conducted. All recorded resources
and resource photographs were reviewed and analyzed by the Principal Investigator
following field survey.

Resource Evaluation Criteria
NRHP Evaluation Criteria

In order to be considered for listing in the NRHP, buildings, structures, objects, sites,
and districts must meet standards of significance defined by the Keeper of the National
Register (36 CFR 60). Each property must be evaluated within the framework of its
historic context and it must retain characteristics that make it a good representative of
properties associated with that aspect of the past. The NRHP Criteria for Evaluation state
that:

22

AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Chapter 4

The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology,
engineering, and culture is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and
objects that possess integrity of location, setting, design, materials, workmanship,
feeling, and association, and:
a) Are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history; or
b) Are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or

c) Embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high
artistic values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity
whose components may lack individual distinction; or
d) Have yielded or may be likely to yield information important in prehistory
or history.

Criterion A

A resource that is representative of an important trend or event may be eligible for the
NRHP under Criterion A. This broad definition provides flexibility when determining the
kinds of significant historical associations. However, a property is not eligible for inclusion
in the NRHP simply because it was built during an important era in history or if it fulfilled
its historic role. In order for a property to be eligible for Criterion A, it must be significant
under one or more defined historic context(s), convey a sense of the past, and remain
recognizable to the period in which it was first constructed or achieved significance.
Criterion B

Criterion B applies to properties associated with individuals whose specific contributions
to history can be identified and documented. However, it is important to determine
not only what contributions are associated with the individual and how they compare
with those of other persons, but also how the property represents or is linked to that
individual and his or her accomplishments. The extent and duration of that association is
particularly important for determining NRHP eligibility. Moreover, the significance of that
person must be associated with the contextual themes defined in this report. Properties
significant under NRHP Criterion B should be those most closely associated with a person
who has made important contributions to the past, be associated with the person during
the time he or she achieved significance, and convey a strong sense of the past and remain
recognizable to the period in which the person achieved significance.
Criterion C

Properties eligible for the NRHP under Criterion C derive significance from the physical
qualities of their design, construction, and/or craftsmanship, including such elements as
architecture, landscape architecture, engineering, and art. To be eligible under Criterion
C, a property must embody distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction; represent the work of a master; possess high artistic value; or represent a
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

23

Cultural Resource Survey of Proposed Reroutes to the No. Texas Municipal Water District’s
Bois d’Arc Lake Raw Water Pipeline, Leonard, Fannin County, Texas

significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction
(a historic district). A property significant under Criterion C is one that clearly represents
a noteworthy example of a defined property type, dates from the period of significance
of one or more historic context(s), and exhibits the character-defining features of its
property type. Therefore, a property must retain a high degree of physical integrity, as
well as having a relation to the historic context.
Criterion D

The last of the four NRHP Criteria deals with the significance of resources that have the
potential to yield important information about the past. Criterion D is applied most often
to archeological resources, but it also may be used to evaluate the significance of extant
buildings and structures. Properties significant under this criterion are those that have
the ability to yield important historic information, such as a rare type of construction. In
order for these types of properties to be eligible under Criterion D, they must themselves
be, or must have been, the principal source of the important information, such as how
construction expertise affected the evolution of local building development. Due to the
nature of the reconnaissance level survey, evaluation under Criterion D is generally
excluded unless historians feel a particular property warrants additional investigation or
consideration. Alternatively, Criterion D is most often used by archeologists to evaluate
prehistoric and historic-age archeological sites for thier NRHP eligibility.
Criteria Considerations

On occasion, certain types of resources are also evaluated that are not normally considered
eligible for the NRHP. These resources include religious properties, structures moved
from original locations, birthplaces and graves, cemeteries, reconstructed buildings,
commemorative properties, and properties achieving significance within the last fifty
years. These properties can qualify for inclusion in the NRHP if they meet specific Criteria
Considerations, in addition to meeting the regular requirements.
a) A religious property deriving primary significance from architectural or
artistic distinction or historical importance; or
b) A building or structure removed from its original location but which is
significant primarily for architectural value, or which is the surviving
structure most importantly associated with a historic person or event; or
c) A birthplace or grave of a historical Figure of outstanding importance if
there is no appropriate site or building directly associated with his or her
productive life; or

d) A cemetery which derives its primary significance from graves of persons
of transcendent importance, from age, from distinctive design features, or
from association with historic events; or
24

e) A reconstructed building when accurately executed in a suitable
environment and presented in a dignified manner as part of a restoration

master plan, and when no other building or structure with the same
association has survived; or

f) A property primarily commemorative in intent if design, age, tradition, or
symbolic value has invested it with its own exceptional significance; or
g) A property achieving significance within the past 50 years if it is of
exceptional importance.

Seven Aspects of Integrity

In addition to being significant under one or more of the criteria listed above, a NRHPeligible property must also retain historic integrity of those features necessary to convey
its significance (US Department of the Interior 1998:3). The Keeper of the National Register
has identified and defined seven aspects of integrity by which potential candidates for
the NRHP must be measured (US Department of the Interior 1998:44-45):
• Location is the place where the historic property was constructed or the
place where the historic event occurred.
• Design is the combination of elements that create the form, plan, space,
structure, and style of a property.
• Setting is the physical environment of a historic property.

• Materials are the physical elements that were combined or deposited during
a particular period of time and in a particular pattern or configuration to
form a historic property.

• Workmanship is the physical evidence of the crafts of a particular culture of
people during any given period in history or prehistory.
• Feeling is a property’s expression of the aesthetic or historic sense of a
particular period of time.

• Association is the direct link between an important historic event, person, or
period and a historic property.

Determining which of these aspects of integrity are most important to a particular property
requires knowing why, where and when the property is significant (US Department of the
Interior 1998:48). For Criteria A or B eligibility, the aspects of location, feeling, setting, and
association take on greater importance in determining a property’s integrity. To be eligible
under these criteria, a property must be able to clearly convey its significant associations
with the historic context. This often requires that a property’s overall environment remain
relatively unaltered from its period of significance. Properties eligible for the NRHP under
Criterion C must retain a high degree of physical integrity, as well as retain some relation
to the historic context. The most important aspects of integrity for Criterion C eligibility
are location, design, materials, workmanship, and feeling.
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

25

Cultural Resource Survey of Proposed Reroutes to the No. Texas Municipal Water District’s
Bois d’Arc Lake Raw Water Pipeline, Leonard, Fannin County, Texas

At a minimum, a property eligible under Criteria A or B must retain its basic original
form that identifies its property type and must be generally recognizable to its period of
significance. However, the significance of properties under Criteria A or B is not derived
mainly from their design or construction value. Therefore, a greater amount of alteration
to a building’s historic physical features is allowable when compared to the more stringent
standards set for Criterion C eligibility. Some minor alterations to the physical fabric of
the building do not necessarily preclude Criterion C eligibility, although they may result
in some loss of integrity. Such acceptable alterations could include replacement of roof
materials or replacement of a minority of exterior doors and windows within the original
fenestration pattern of the building. In some cases, non-historic outbuildings or landscape
features could also be considered acceptable modifications to the property, if they are
visually unobtrusive and compatible in design and scale with the original building and
its setting. Major changes to a building’s roofline, form, or overall massing are generally
considered unacceptable, and would render a building not eligible under NRHP Criteria
A, B, and C.

Rural Historic Landscapes

The Department of the Interior defines a rural historic landscape as “a geographical
area that historically has been used by people, or shaped or modified by human activity,
occupancy, or intervention, and that possesses a significant concentration, linkage, or
continuity of areas of land use, vegetation, buildings and structures, roads and waterways,
and natural features.” They commonly reflect the lives of those engaged in agricultural
pursuits such as farming, ranching, or fishing, but not necessarily so. Rural historic
landscapes are defined by eleven characteristics:
• Land use and activities are the major human forces that shape and organize
rural communities.
• Patterns of spatial organization define the relationships among major physical
components, predominant landforms, and natural features.

• Responses to the natural environment are reflected in the siting of buildings,
construction materials, and the location of clusters of buildings and structures,
as well as traditions in land use, construction methods, and social customs.
• Cultural traditions in the form of religious beliefs, social customs, ethnic
identity, and trades and skills may be evident today in both physical features
and uses of the land.
• Circulation networks are systems for transporting people, goods, and raw
materials from one point to another, varying in size from footpaths to railroad
lines.

26

AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Chapter 4

• Boundary demarcations delineate areas of ownership and land use through
the use of fences, walls, tree lines, hedgerows, drainage or irrigation ditches,
roadways, creeks, and rivers.
• Vegetation related to land use includes not only crops, trees, or shrubs planted
for agricultural and ornamental purposes, but also trees that have grown up
incidentally along fence lines, beside roads, or in abandoned fields.
• Buildings, structures, and objects are the various types of buildings, structures,
and objects serve human needs related to the occupation and use of the land.
• Clusters are groupings of like features resulting from function, social tradition,
climate, or other influences, cultural or natural.

• Archeological sites may provide valuable information about the ways the
land has been used, patterns of social history, or the methods and extent of
activities such as shipping, milling, lumbering, or quarrying.

• Small-scale elements such as foot bridges, sign posts, or hay bales add to the
historic setting of a rural landscape, and may be characteristic of a region.

Rural historic landscapes follow the same general guidelines for evaluation as other
properties under the criteria, although due to their complex nature they are commonly
significant under more than one of the criteria and may have to meet one or more of the
Criteria Considerations depending on the composition of contributing elements. Rural
historic landscapes must also retain sufficient integrity to convey their significance. While
no landscape will appear exactly as it did during the historic period due to their variable
and mutable nature, the landscape must retain the general character and feeling of the
historic period. Which aspects of integrity must be retained will vary depending on the
reasons behind the landscapes’ significance, but in general the aspects of setting, feeling,
and association are particularly important.

SAL Evaluation Criteria

In addition to the National Register evaluation criteria outlined above, the ACT allows
for archeological resources to be evaluated for significance at the state level as SALs.
According to the ACT, any site located on state-owned land may be considered a SAL if it
meets any of the formal designation criteria (13 Texas Antiquities Code [TAC] 26.8):
1. the site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory
and/or history of Texas by the addition of new and important information;

2. the site’s archeological deposits and artifacts within the state are preserved and
intact, thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the
site;
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

27

Cultural Resource Survey of Proposed Reroutes to the No. Texas Municipal Water District’s
Bois d’Arc Lake Raw Water Pipeline, Leonard, Fannin County, Texas

3. the site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or
history

4. the study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of
preservation, thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge;
5. the high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur
and official landmark designation is needed to insure maximum legal protection, or
alternatively further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism
and relic collecting when the site cannot be protected.

Laboratory

All artifacts observed in the field were recorded on site and returned to their find location.
All field-generated forms, notes, photographs, and other materials were organized and
curated at TARL in Austin.

In accordance with the accepted research design, no artifacts were collected during
field survey. When observed, all artifacts (or a representative sample thereof) were
recorded through field notes, drawings, and/or photographs then returned to their find
location. Historic-age sites recorded along the proposed Raw Water Pipeline were further
investigated through archival research and historic aerial photograph overlays.

Results Of Investigations
During the course of two days of field survey archeologists surveyed the entirety of the
project’s direct effects APE and documented two historic-age archeological resources
(Sites 41FN269 and 41FN270; Figure 11). Along with the structural components of
41FN269 and 41FN270, architectural historians further documented the project’s
potential effects to the historic-aged MKT railroad, which the proposed pipeline corridor’s
eastern half parallels. A general summary of the intensive linear cultural resource survey
is presented below.

Archeological Survey

Pedestrian Survey and Shovel Testing
Thirty-one shovel tests were placed along the alignment, all of which were negative for
cultural resources (Appendix; see Figure 11). Soils within the APE were generally clay or
clay loam. Shovel tests were strategically placed along the APE and ranged in depth from 7
to 65 cmbs, averaging 34.1 cmbs. The color and texture of the soil was generally very dark
grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay or clay loam overlying brown (10YR 4/3) or dark gray
(10YR 4/1) basal clay subsoil or decaying limestone bedrock, with the calcium carbonate
content of the soils tending to increase with depth. The water table was shallow and was
encountered in some excavations; much of the APE was saturated from recent rains.
About 120 meters of the corridor south of and along CR 4960 was wooded, otherwise
the APE was comprised of open agricultural fields and pasture (Figure 12), with some
vegetation along the fence lines. Three former residential areas and Lee Creek are also
within the APE. About 450 meters of the APE is adjacent to the MKT Railroad. The terrain
is mainly level with slopes ranging from zero to three percent, although the creek is
deeply incised (about 3.5 meters [11.5 feet]; see Figure 4; Figure 13). Ground surface
visibility ranged from about 90 percent in the recently cut cotton field (Figure 14) to
nearly zero in grassy pastures or fallow agricultural fields (Figure 15). Shovel tests were
placed within the APE to investigate three residential areas, resulting in the recordation
of two new sites (41FN269 and 41FN270). Texas Archeological Survey Standards require
16 shovel tests per mile for linear surveys along two transects, or 28 for this APE. The 31
shovel tests excavated within the APE exceed this minimum requirement.

The prefabricated residence, barn, and outbuildings on the north side of CR 4960 were
investigated, but were not recorded as an archeological resource based on a post-field
review of aerial photography that determined they were constructed or moved here some
time after 1996 (Figure 16). The barn and carport initially appeared older because they
were clad using repurposed corrugated tin (multiple rows of old nail holes were visible
upon closer inspection).

Site 41FN269
Field Site 41FN269 is a historic-age (early-to-mid-twentieth century) farmstead remnant
measuring approximately 65 x 60 meters (north-south by east-west; 197 x 213 feet) and
extending to the south beyond the 120-foot-wide APE, while remaining confined to the
400-foot-wide corridor for indirect effects (Figure 17). Site 41FN269 is situated east of,
and adjacent to, the open and active agricultural field within a wooded area with numerous
saplings and a few mature deciduous trees. The remnants of a machine-made-brick-lined
well (Figures 18 and 19) and a wooden pole barn (Figure 20) were the only features
observed, while a surface scatter of burned household and farm refuse (landscaping
timbers, rubber tires, modern glass bottles, a flattened metal lubricant barrel, etc.;
Figure 21)—a likely former burn pile—was located adjacent to the barn. One doublerolled, unsoldered, sanitary food can was the only clearly temporal diagnostic observed
(Figure 22). According to a historic can typology developed by the California Department
of Forestry and Fire Protection (2019), this type of can dates from 1904-present.

The well, although damaged, has 14 visible courses of unmarked red brick (4 x 8 x 3-inch)
rising approximately three feet above the ground surface. The well is approximately 32
inches in diameter and extends to an unknown depth (it was full of water at the time
of survey). Additional red-paste bricks with no maker’s marks were scattered on the
surface around the well and were consistent with those comprising the intact portions of
the well. The pole barn stands approximately 30 meters to the southwest and measures
approximately 15 x 30 feet and 10 feet tall. It was constructed of modern milled lumber
and clad with corrugated tin. It had a wide door (about 2.5 meters [8 feet]), and may
have been used as an equipment shed. Additional structures were depicted within the
site boundary in a 1964 aerial photograph (Figure 23), but none of those structures is
extant. Six shovel tests were excavated to delineate the site (Table 1). All were negative
for cultural material. Besides modern trash, no diagnostic historic-age artifacts were
encountered on the surface of the site, much of which was covered by tall grass, leaf litter,
or duff, affording little visibility.
41FN269 Archival Summary

Deed research suggests that the property containing Site 41FN269 is associated with the
Key and Thomas families. In 1847 William H. Hunt and John D. Black received a land
patent from the State of Texas for 640 acres that included the land within 41FN269. Hunt
and Black owned a land company with vast holdings throughout Texas and it is unlikely
that either lived on or even saw the property. In 1852 Richard B. Thomas purchased 640
acres from Hunt and Black (Fannin County deed records F/149). It is likely that Thomas
and his family lived on the property. U.S. Census records indicate that the nearest post
office to the family home in 1860 was Oak Hill, which was located in Grove Hill (Hymer
1986), four miles northeast of 41FN269. In 1861 Richard B. Thomas sold 150 acres of the
property to the duplicately-named Thomas Thomas, who was probably his brother (1870
U.S. Census; Fannin County deed records N/428). In 1894 Thomas and his wife, Mary
Ann, deeded 35 (?; specific umber was difficult to read on document) acres to their son
J.R. (Fannin County deed records 54/411).

J. R. Thomas and his wife, Jesse, owned the land until 1916 when they sold 49 acres that
includes the location of 41FN269 to John T. Key (Fannin County deed records 139/705).
John Key owned and probably lived on this property until his death in 1958 (LPL
2005:155). As part of the settlement of John Key’s estate, his son, Thomas, purchased
the 49 acres (Fannin County deed records 417/538). Thomas Key died in 1966, and his
widow deeded the property to their three children: Billy J., Thomas W., and Lowell G. Key
(Fannin County deed records 488/683). According to Thomas Key’s obituary, he had been
living in Fort Worth for a few years, as did two of his children (findagrave.com 2019). Billy
J. Key still owns the property today but does not live there.
Based on deed records, census data, and the early-to-mid-twentieth-century age of most
of the structures and artifacts at the site, 41FN269 is probably most closely associated
with John T. Key and his immediate family.
Summary

Overall, 41FN269 is an early-to-mid-twentieth-century archeological site centered
around a brick-lined with an associated wooden barn/shed. No significant historic-age
diagnostic artifacts were encountered in any shovel test or on the surface besides a metal
can whose form has been in use for more than 100 years. Push piles of modern household
and farm refuse are indicative of the disturbances associated with the demolition of
the former structures. The well may date to the early twentieth century, but it is not a
particularly unique feature and was associated with a former historic-age residence and
outbuildings that have since been almost entirely removed. Thus, the integrity of the
well’s context has been permanently altered and further investigation would not likely
result in additional new information important to the history of Texas. The barn itself has
no known association with important historic events, trends, or persons under Criteria
A and B, and is a common building type that does not rise to a level of architectural
significance required under Criterion C.

Finally, archival research suggests that the site is most likely attributed to John T. Key and
his descendants, who have owned the property from 1916 to the present. The 1936 Fannin
County Highway map depicts two structures in the general vicinity of Sites 41FN269
and 41FN270, the westernmost being 41FN269 (see Figure 7). Accordingly, the earliest
components of 41FN269 date at least as early as the Great Depression, a period when
the land was owned by John Key. While remarkable that the property has been owned by
one family (Richard B. Thomas) for 64 years followed by the current owner’s family for
the past 103 years, neither family was known to be associated with an important historic
event, person, or property.
The former residence has been demolished or removed, negatively affecting the integrity
of the remaining features (well and barn) because the site’s context has been permanently
altered. The barn and well lack sufficient significance to be considered individually
eligible for NRHP listing. Lacking research potential or association with individuals
of historical significance, Site 41FN269 is recommended as not eligible for listing in
the NRHP or for designation as an SAL. For the same reasons, site 41FN269 does not
constitute a rural historic landscape because it does not retain the general character and
feeling of the historic period, and it lacks sufficient integrity to convey any significance as
an agricultural property. No further work is recommended at this site.

Site 41FN270

Within the pipeline project’s impact corridor, Site 41FN270 consists of a historic-age
storm shelter, and animal shed with no substantial complement of artifacts associated
with a recently-functioning, historic-age ranching complex on a terrace west of Lee Creek
(Figure 24). The site, whose boundaries were defined by the property line due to the
paucity of artifacts within the survey corridor, measures approximately 140 x 125 meters
(north-south by east-west; 459 x 410 feet) and is adjacent to (east) 41FN269. Only a
small portion of Site 41FN270 is situated within the 120-foot-wide APE, and it extends
well beyond the 400-foot-wide corridor for indirect effects to the south. Two features
are situated within the APE, including a semi-subterranean storm shelter (Figures
25–26), and a modern milled-lumber and plywood animal shed and adjacent lightpole
(Figure 27). Modern trash was noted in the corral near the animal shed.
The semi-subterranean storm shelter was made of formed concrete with only the opening
to a set of stairs, about two feet of the walls, and a flat roof with vent pipes visible above
ground. Below ground, the room had a set of shelves to one side that had canned goods and
other items stored on them. A relatively common feature on the surrounding landscape,
the semi-subterranean shelter was probably constructed in the 1950s or 1960s and
associated with the presumed residence near CR 4960 depicted in a 1964 aerial photo
(Figure 28), but that has since been demolished or removed. Recent aerial photographs
depict these same structures (see Figure 23), indicating that they were removed within
the last few years.

The 1964 aerial photo also documents several outbuildings associated with the residence,
but none of these structures is extant (Figure 29). Conversely, the main barn, a side barn,
and a cow pen (Figure 30) associated with them in the 1964 aerial photo remain standing
well south of the project’s APE.
Of note: the plywood animal shed west of the storm shelter is not depicted on this image,
suggesting it was added after that date. Only three shovel tests (RB11, MG7, and MM3;
Table 2) were excavated to delineate the site, since overall ground surface visibility
exceeded 30 percent and the majority of the site components were located south of the
current impact corridor. Areas with poor surface visibility (such as in the vicinity of the

animal shed [MG7, RB11]) and just east of the marked boundary (Test MM3) were tested.
These tests contained shallow, upland clays with minimal deposition and no subsurface
artifacts.

A concrete cap on a former well was noted nearby during the survey. A highly fragmented
historic-age artifact scatter encountered on the surface (some melted) consisted of
plain whiteware, gilded-rim whiteware, and embossed whiteware sherds, milk glass
and cobalt-colored shards, brown-glazed ceramic insulators, and a light green glass
marble (Figure 31). The artifact scatter was mostly visible on the scraped ground where
a structure formerly stood, but also extended into grassy areas nearby. All of these
components were limited to areas outside of the pipeline project’s impact footprint and
were therefore noted for the site record but were not intensively investigated.

The artifact scatter is outside of the 120-foot-wide APE, but within the 400-foot-wide
corridor for indirect effects. Within the portion of the site that extends beyond the artifact
scatter to the south (and beyond the 400-foot-wide corridor for indirect effects) are the
main barn, a side barn, and a cow pen. Although beyond the indirect effects corridor, these
site features were briefly investigated because they are related to the occupation and use
of the land, as well as being potential components of a broader rural historic landscape.
Site 41FN270 Archival Summary

Deed research revealed a lengthy and complex chain of title for the property on which
41FN270 is located. It was first part of a 640-acre tract patented to the above-referenced
William Hunt and John Black in 1852. Since then the property, or parts of it, have been
bought and sold over two dozen times. In 1921 Byron Benjamin Braly purchased a 57-acre
tract that includes the site from G. P. Rhodes and his wife (Fannin County deed records
158/83). Through Ethel Braly Arnold (Figure 32), daughter of Byron Braly, a portion of
the property stayed in the family until 1949 when Ethel Arnold sold the land (one of six
tracts sold) to Weldon Jaco (Fannin County deed records 304/525-526).

Ten years later, Weldon and his wife, Carol Jaco sold the property, along with six other
parcels, to C. E. Gray. Gray sold the same seven parcels along with the the 57-acre Site
41FN270 property to Ben Smithson and his wife in 1963 (Fannin County deed records
465/317). The property stayed in the Smithson family until Donald Spurgin bought it from
Ben Smithson’s heirs in 1998 (Fannin County deed records 863/383). The structures and
artifacts found at 41FN270 indicate that the farmstead dates to the early to mid-twentieth
century, meaning that early site components (if extant, most likely located outside of the
current survey corridor) are more closely associated with the Braly occupations, while
later additions are attributed to the Jaco, Gray, and/or Smithson families.

Chapter 5

Of all of the property owners of note associated with Site 41FN270, only the Braly name
was included in the Leonard Preservation League’s History of Leonard, Texas Volume II
(2005:71). The Braly’s are described as a long-tenured family name in Fannin County
and Leonard in particular, with the first Fannin County Braly (Hugh Lee Braly; Byron’s
father) arriving from Ireland in 1844. According to the History of Leonard, Texas Volume II
(LPL 2005:71), H. L. Braly supplied much of the lumber and building supplies used in
the earliest construction of Leonard. At various times in his life, Byron Braly, who owned
the property from 1921 until his death in 1938 operated a cotton gin and bred Hereford
cattle, potentially using this tract for some of those activities (LPL 2005:71). Even Ethel
Braly Arnold’s passing in 1978 was noted in the History of Leonard, Texas Volume II (LPL
2005:71) as “... of special importance to Fannin County and Leonard Historians. Her death
signified the first time since 1844… that the county no longer had representation by
residency of a Braly family member.”
Summary

Overall, 41FN270 is an early-to-mid-twentieth-century archeological site whose presumed
main residence and a smaller dwelling or outbuilding have been recently demolished.
Features remaining within the 120-foot-wide APE for direct effects include a semisubterranean storm shelter made of formed concrete and an animal shed constructed of
modern lumber. Scraped earth and a surface scatter of modern and historic-age artifacts
were noted on the surface where a small dwelling or outbuilding is depicted in historic
aerial photography. The surface scatter is south of the APE for direct effects, but within
the 400-foot-wide corridor for indirect effects. Finally, the main barn, a side barn, and
an adjacent cow pen are features of the site that are farther south and outside of the
400-foot-wide corridor for indirect effects.

The highly fragmented historic-age artifacts encountered on the surface outside of the
survey footprint in a disturbed context, consisted of twentieth-century ceramic sherds,
glass shards, and other household refuse. No evidence was encountered during the
survey of the larger residence depicted closer to the road in the 1964 aerial photograph.
The 1936 Fannin County Highway Map (see Figure 7) depicts two structures adjacent to
one another in roughly the mapped location of Site 41FN270, suggesting that the earliest
components of this site date at least to this period. Lacking surface artifacts within the
impact corridor, it is difficult to discern which portions of the site originated first.
The storm shelter likely dates to the mid-twentieth century, and similar ones were
apparent in other yards in and around Leonard. Thus, it is not a particularly unique feature
and was associated with a former historic-age residence and outbuildings that have since
been removed. The integrity of the storm shelter’s context has been permanently altered
and further investigation within the impact corridor would not likely result in additional
new information important to the history of Texas.

Finally, archival research suggests that the property is attributed to two members of the
Braly family: Byron and his daughter Ethel, who owned the property from 1921 through
1949. The depiction of a structure on the 1936 Fannin County highway map suggests
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

47

Cultural Resource Survey of Proposed Reroutes to the No. Texas Municipal Water District’s
Bois d’Arc Lake Raw Water Pipeline, Leonard, Fannin County, Texas

that some of the structures on the property are likely attributed to them, but the largest
structure (presumably the residence) is no longer extant. Those structures that are
present, the storm shelter and the plywood shed (particularly the latter), are more likely
attributed to later owners. Only the Braly family is specifically listed in local histories,
but the family’s local historical significance is derived from their association with the
founding of Leonard itself and not by the now-missing residence or the agricultural
activities carried out at Site 41FN270.

The former residence has been demolished or removed, negatively affecting the
integrity of the remaining features (storm shelter and barns) because the site’s context
has been permanently altered. While possessing nominal significance under Criterion
A for association with farming practices in the region, the storm shelter and barn as
individual resources lack sufficient integrity of setting, materials, workmanship, feeling,
and association and are recommended not eligible for individual NRHP listing. Lacking
research potential or association with the significance of individuals of historical import,
Site 41FN270 is recommended as not eligible for listing in the NRHP or for designation
as an SAL. Likewise, site 41FN270 does not constitute a rural historic landscape because
without the primary residence associated with the remaining features, it does not retain
the general character and feeling of the historic period. No further work is recommended
at this site.

Assessment of Non-Archeological Cultural Resources

Along with assessing the significance of the structures within the archeological sites
recorded during the archeological survey, AmaTerra architectural historians documented
two individual above-ground resources along the NTMWD Raw Water Pipeline reroute
corridor (Figures 33, 34, and 35). These include the MKT railroad bed, a circa 1996
prefabricated house (with modern outbuildings) and a circa 1996 horse barn associated
with the modern house. Below is a summary of the resources documented within the
400-foot indirect effect APE.

The MKT Railroad

The MKT railroad parallels the eastern/southern half of the proposed Raw Water Pipeline
corridor within the indirect effects APE. The line is typical of most modern railroad
corridors with a raised white stone gravel bed and standard track. No components of the
rail line were visible within the installation corridor and the line itself was largely obscured
by a dense line of trees and scrub that grows along the property boundary (Figures 36
and 37). Though this rail line was a vital artery that was a significant catalyst to founding
the community of Leonard (see Chapter 3), the line is still in use today and presumably has
been routinely updated and modified over the decades. In addition, because the proposed
Raw Water Pipeline reroute includes no above-ground components, it is unlikely that
any construction would result in significant visual impacts to this resource. With no
other character-defining features of the railroad within the project area (maintenance
buildings, track switches, significant bridges, etc.), the railroad does not rise to a level of
significance required for consideration under Criteria A, B, and C. It is recommended not
eligible for NRHP listing.

1996 Structure Complex
North of CR 4960 is a structural complex that was moved to the site or constructed after
1996. It contains a circa 1996 prefabricated house (Figure 38) with modern outbuildings
and a barn. Located just north of CR 4960, the house has an attached carport on the
northwestern end. On the same property are two modern outbuildings (Figures 39 and
40). The house is a manufactured home that is not of historic age and not a permanent
structure. The outbuildings are modern as well. Due to their recent age, they are not
eligible for NRHP listing.

Northwest of and associated with the structure complex is a horse barn. The building is
a simple wood-frame structure with repurposed telephone poles, and corrugated metal
roofing and siding (Figure 41). The driveway from CR 4960 provides access to both the
house and barn. As a modern building possessing no exceptional historical significance,
it is not eligible for NRHP listing.

Conclusions and Recommendations
AmaTerra investigators found the proposed revised NTMWD Raw Water Pipeline
corridor to be devoid of significant cultural resources despite extensive shovel testing,
and pedestrian survey, and historic resource survey. None of the 31 shovel tests excavated
along the reroute contained cultural material. Two archeological sites were recorded
based on encountering above-ground features and surficial scatters of historic-age
artifacts.
Site 41FN269 is an early-to-mid-twentieth-century archeological site centered around a
brick-lined well and a barn. No historic-age diagnostic artifacts were encountered in any
shovel test or on the surface. Disturbances were noted associated with the demolition
of the former residence at this location. The well is not a particularly unique feature and
was associated with a former historic-age residence and outbuildings (besides the extant
barn) that have since been removed. Thus, the integrity of the site’s context has been
permanently altered and further investigation would not likely result in additional new
information important to the history of Texas.

Archival research suggests that the site is most likely attributed to John T. Key and his
family who have owned the property from 1916 to the present. While remarkable that
the property has been owned by one family for the past 103 years, neither the site nor
the family was associated with an important historic event, person, or historic property.
Lacking research potential or association with individuals of historical significance, Site
41FN269 is recommended as not eligible for listing in the NRHP or for designation as an
SAL. For the same reasons, site 41FN269 does not constitute a rural historic landscape
because it does not retain the general character and feeling of the historic period. No
further work is recommended at this site.

Site 41FN270 is an early-to-mid-twentieth-century archeological site whose remaining
features include a semi-subterranean storm shelter, an animal shed, a surface scatter of
modern and historic-age artifacts, the main barn, a side barn, and an adjacent cow pen.
The former residence and a smaller dwelling or outbuilding have been demolished or
removed from the site, negatively affecting the integrity of the remaining features (storm
shelter and barns) because the site’s context has been permanently altered. Lacking
research potential or association with individuals of historical significance, site 41FN270
is recommended as not eligible for listing in the NRHP or for designation as an SAL.
Likewise, site 41FN270 does not constitute a rural historic landscape because without the
primary residence associated with the remaining features, it does not retain the general
character and feeling of the historic period. No further work is recommended at this site.

Construction in this area is unlikely to impact significant archeological or nonarcheological cultural resources. Therefore, the Principal Investigator requests the THC’s
concurrence that project activities associated with the above described corridor revision
will not likely impact Historic Properties and/or SALs and should proceed with no further
cultural resource coordination.
