Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

Abstract
This report details excavations at the Kitchen Branch site (41CP220) in Camp County,
Texas. Working on behalf of the Texas Department of Transportation and Federal Highway
Administration, archeologists from AmaTerra Environmental, Inc., Archeological and
Environmental Consultants, LLC, Hicks & Company Environmental, Archeological, and
Planning Consultants, Inc, and Coastal Environments Inc., completed National Register
of Historic Places and State Antiquities Landmark eligibility testing and later data
recovery investigations of components of the Kitchen Branch site. Work was conducted
for compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (as amended) and
the Antiquities Code of Texas (13 TAC 26) between 2004 and 2007 when portions of
the site were proposed to be impacted by expansion of Farm to Market Road 557 at its
crossing of the Kitchen Branch of Prairie Creek. Testing phase investigations (Antiquities
Permit 3609) included excavation of 23 1 x 1-meter and 40 x 40-centimeter test units
and 13 Gradall trenches, documenting artifacts and features attributed to Middle-Late
Archaic, Woodland, and Late Caddo Titus phase occupations along with a small, minor
historic (late nineteenth and early twentieth century) component. Archeologists, citing
intact, buried features, lithics, ceramics, and faunal and floral materials, determined
that the Titus phase site components were eligible for inclusion in the National Register
of Historic Places and as a State Antiquities Landmark. Subsequent data recovery
investigations (Antiquities Permit 4473) targeted the Titus phase component of the
Kitchen Branch site and included geophysical survey (magnetometer, ground-penetrating
radar, and electrical resistivity), block test unit excavations (167 1 x 1s in three main
blocks), and mechanical and hand scraping. Approximately 4,000 prehistoric ceramic
sherds, 4,400 lithic flakes, 137 projectile points, numerous other tools, and various faunal
and floral materials were recovered and analyzed during both phases of investigations
while archeologists documented 236 prehistoric features (and unnumbered possible post
holes). To supplement the basic qualitative and quantitative data from artifact analysis,
researchers collected and processed a variety of other samples including organic residue,
petrographic, neutron activation, thermoluminescence dating of prehistoric ceramics and
radiocarbon assays of ceramic residue and burned plant remains from the site. In addition
nearly 1,000 historic artifacts were also recovered and interpreted as part of the field and
analysis effort.
Based on the various analyses, the primary investigated component at the Kitchen Branch
is a single, small, Titus phase domestic farmstead occupied for a relatively short time
during the 15th century AD.
To complement the discussion of the Kitchen Branch site, this report includes brief
analysis and interpretation of Titus phase ceramic vessel photographs from the Horton
site (41CP20) and a small assemblage of artifacts, field notes, and photographs from
the Keering site (41CP21). Both sites were investigated in 1974 by State Department
of Transportation and Public Transportation archeologists in association with roadway
projects and never formally reported.

Introduction

Introduction
This report serves as the culminating summary of two phases of excavations at the
Kitchen Branch site (41CP220), a multi-component prehistoric and historic archeological
site located along the banks of Prairie Creek in Camp County, Texas (Figure 1-1, Appendix
A: Figure 1). On behalf of the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) through their
Environmental Affairs Division (TxDOT-ENV) and their Atlanta District office, archeologists
performed limited testing investigations at the site (first recorded by TxDOT archeologists
in 1989) during the winter of 2004/2005, then revisited the site during the spring and
summer of 2007 for data recovery efforts. Data recovery focused on the siteâs Titus phase
Late Caddo component. All work was conducted for National Historic Preservation Act of
1966 (as amended; NHPA) and Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) compliance associated
with the then-proposed replacement of the Farm-to-Market (FM) 557 bridge, which spans
the Kitchen Branch of Prairie Creek near Pittsburg, Texas. During the two phases of
investigations, archeologists excavated 167 1 x 1-meter units, conducted magnetometer,
soil resistivity, and ground-penetrating radar survey, recorded 236 prehistoric and historic
archeological features, and unearthed some 4,044 prehistoric ceramic sherds, 137
dart and arrow points, and 985 historic-period artifacts, as well as abundant data in the
form of faunal material, charred organics, and matrix samples. Along with the artifacts
themselves, site interpretation drew also from a variety of chemical analyses including
thermoluminescence and radiocarbon dating, neutron activation and petrographic
analysis, sherd residue analysis, as well as macrobotanical and faunal identification. This
report summarizes these broad data sets and presents an overall interpretation of the
archeological history of the site, focusing on its Titus phase occupation.
To complement the analysis and discussion from the Kitchen Branch site, this report also
includes brief summaries of earlier excavations and artifact collections from the B. J.
Horton (41CP20) and Keering (41CP21) sites whose records and artifact assemblages
have not been thoroughly investigated until this effort. Below is a brief overview of the
various components of the investigations and the bridge replacement itself.

Project Description
The Kitchen Branch site is located within the Area of Potential Effects (APE) for a bridge
replacement over Prairie Creek along FM 557 south of Pittsburg, Texas. Prior to the
replacement, the existing FM 557 right-of-way (ROW) was 80 feet wide at the Prairie
Creek crossing. The bridge replacement involved expanding the ROW to the east by an

additional 125 feet at Prairie Creek from approximately 1,000 feet north of Prairie Creek
to approximately 1,300 feet south of County Road (CR) 451, for a total distance of about
3,200 feet. The expanded ROW is now 205 feet with the centerline shifted approximately
80 feet to the east. Over its full length, the expansion required a total area of approximately
15 acres (5.9 acres of existing public ROW and 9.1 acres of proposed expanded ROW).
The APE for archeological resources, therefore was defined horizontally as the 15-acre
existing and proposed new ROW, while its vertical extent was defined as the maximum
depth of the bridge piers, which extend 30-40 feet into the subsurface.

Management Summary for Excavations at the Kitchen Branch Site
Archeological investigations associated with the FM 557 bridge replacement project were
conducted for both state and federal regulatory compliance. While the project included
state funding through TxDOT, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) also financially
contributed to the bridge construction effort, making it a federal undertaking. Because
the project is considered a federal undertaking, it falls under the provisions of Section
106 of the NHPA (Section 106). This law requires that all federal agencies must âtake
into accountâ the impacts that their actions would have on historic properties, which can
include archeological sites, structures, objects and districts that have historic significance
at a national, state, or local level and that are eligible for listing on the National Register
of Historic Places (NRHP). According to National Park Service regulations (36 CFR 60.4),
a property is considered eligible for listing in the NRHP if it possesses integrity of location,
design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association and
a) is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history; or
b) is associated with the lives of persons significant to our past; or
c) embodies distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or that represents the work of a master, or that possesses
high artistic values, or that represents a significant and distinguishable
entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
d) has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or
history
The process by which historic properties are identified and accounted for is outlined
in Section 106 of the NHPA and 36 CFR 800. Through this process, the Kitchen
Branch site was identified both within and beyond the proposed expanded TxDOT ROW
while subsequent NRHP-eligibility testing (described in this volume) concluded with
recommendations that portions of the Kitchen Branch site within the project APE were
NRHP-eligible under Criterion D (the most common listing criterion for archeological sites).
The Texas Historical Commission (THC; Texasâ State Historic Preservation Office) concurred
with this recommendation on September 12, 2005 (see Appendices 1-1 and 1-2).

Chapter 1

The bridge replacement project took place on land that would eventually become TxDOT
ROW and owned by the State of Texas. Consequently, the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT)
also applied to this project. This law protects sites, objects, buildings, pre-twentieth century
shipwrecks, and locations of historical, archeological, educational, or scientific interest
that are eligible for listing as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs) that are located on State
owned land. Like NRHP listing, sites are considered eligible for SAL-listing if they meet any
of the following criteria:
1. The site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory
and/or history of Texas by the addition of new and important information;
2. The siteâs archeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved
and intact, thereby supporting research potential or preservation interests of
the site;
3. The site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/
or history;
4. The study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of
preservation, thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge;
5. The high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could
occur, and official landmark designation is needed to insure maximum
protection, or alternatively further investigations are needed to mitigate the
effects of vandalism and relic collecting if the site cannot be protected.
Those portions of the site within the project APE were considered NRHP and SAL-eligible
under Criteria 1â3.
All work was conducted in accordance with the Programmatic Agreement (PA) among the
Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), the FHWA, the THC, and TxDOT, and the
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between TxDOT and the THC.
The testing work was completed by Coastal Environments, Inc. and Archeological &
Environmental Consultants, LLC (David B. Kelley and Timothy K. Perttula, Co-Principal
Investigators), while the data recovery field work was done by Hicks & Company
Environmental, Archeological and Planning Consultants, Inc., and Archeological &
Environmental Consultants, LLC (James W. Karbula, Principal Investigator), under TxDOT
Contracts 573-XX-SA008 and 577-XX-SA006, respectively. Subsequent data analysis and
reporting were completed by AmaTerra Environmental Consultants, Inc. and Archeological &
Environmental Consultants, LLC. under Contract 571-XX-SA002. All phases of investigations
on the site were completed under antiquities permits issued by the THC. Antiquities
Permit 3609 (David B. Kelley, Principal Investigator, Coastal Environments) was issued for
NRHP/SAL-eligibility testing at the Kitchen Branch site while data recovery efforts were
completed under Antiquities Permit 4473 (James W. Karbula, Principal Investigator, Hicks
& Company). Subsequent to field investigations both permits were transferred to Mason

the results of field investigations and report production.

Management Summary for Excavations at the Horton Site and the Keering Site
As mentioned above, this report includes summary and analysis of two additional sites
in the vicinity of the Kitchen Branch site. The B. J. Horton site, was identified near Big
Cypress Creek first in the 1950s, then was found within a U.S. 271 borrow area used by
TxDOT (then called the State Department of Highways and Public Transportation [SDHPT])
in 1974. It is unclear if the borrow activities were associated with federal actions (and
therefore NHPA compliance requirements); however, the siteâs location within a borrow
area owned by TxDOT does make it subject to the ACT. The site was considered eligible for
SAL listing under Criteria 1â3, and 5. While excavation details are published in several
regional archeological summaries (Hunt et al. 1996; Turner 1978), detailed artifact
photographs generated from the 1970s site investigation housed in TxDOTâs archives had
not been previously analyzed or published. This volume serves to publish these data and
supplement the current interpretation of the site for ACT compliance.
Located some 12 kilometers to the south, the Keering site1 was identified by an avocational
archeologist after blading activities occurred during construction of U.S. Highway 271
near Prairie Creek (the site was not identified during initial field survey). The highway
construction project likely did include a federal component (either funding or permitting)
and, therefore, was likely subject to Section 106 requirements. Additionally, being located
directly within the then-proposed TxDOT ROW, construction in the vicinity of the Keering
site was also subject to ACT compliance. The summer of 1974 excavations were part of
an emergency recovery effort that occurred after construction began, and, therefore, no
permit was issued. While detailed notes and photographs were taken and the artifact
assemblage was prepared for publication and curation, all site-related materials were kept
in TxDOTâs archives without a final report being produced. Like the Horton site, this volume
is an effort to publish the Keering site data for ACT compliance.

Contents of Report
Following this introduction, Chapter 2 provides a discussion of the environmental and
cultural setting of the Northeast Texas region, focusing on the Big Cypress Creek basin of
which the Prairie Creek basin is a part. A brief discussion of the testing investigations at
the Kitchen Branch site is included as Chapter 3. Chapter 4 presents the final research
design that was developed and implemented for the analysis of the archeological features
and material culture remains from the site. As the last of the introductory chapters,

In its various field notes and forms, the site is also referred to as the Keeling site and the Kerring site.
With âKeelingâ already assigned to another late Caddo site in the county and âKerringâ likely a typographical
error on a form, the authors have elected to use âKeeringâ as the preferred site name.

Chapter 1

Chapter 5 provides a detailed discussion of the data recovery investigations, including
quantitative descriptions of the level of effort, general observations, and basic field and
post-field analysis.
Following these initial chapters, the report moves into more detailed interpretive discussions
for the Kitchen Branch siteâs various collected data sets including its features (Chapter 6),
radiometric and thermoluminescence (TL) dating results (Chapter 7), and organic remains
(Chapter 12). Detailed analyses and discussion related to the siteâs prehistoric ceramic
assemblage is included in Chapters 8 and 9 while the recovered lithics are described in
detail in Chapter 11.
As a complement to the prehistoric ceramic discussion, Chapter 10 describes the
experimental production of Late Caddo, Titus phase, vessels by Chase Earles, a member of
the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma and a self-trained traditional Caddo potter. The experimental
production of Titus phase vessels using temper and paste recipes identified in the study
of the prehistoric sherds from the Kitchen Branch site, as well as traditional vessel forms,
firing conditions, surface treatment, in addition to the use of slips and pigments, was
designed to gather controlled information on vessel production, as well as provide specific
data on these attributes to compare with the detailed analysis of the Kitchen Branch
sherds.
Chapters 13 and 14 present the results of limited 1974 archeological investigations at the
B. J. Horton and Keering sites, respectively, completed by the SDHPT. Both sites primarily
have Late Caddo Titus phase components, and the ceramic and/or lithic artifacts from
them are discussed in detail in those chapters.
In Chapter 15, the archeological remains from the late nineteenth- and early twentiethcentury historic component at the Kitchen Branch site is reviewed while the associated
archival record is summarized in an effort to place this assemblage in a historical context
associated with the individuals who lived there then. Of key importance to this discussion,
the chapter estimates what (if any) adverse impacts the siteâs historic-period components
may have had on the character of the prehistoric occupational components and, in turn,
the interpretations we draw from them.
The concluding chapter (Chapter 16) synthesizes the archeological findings from the
various analyses that have been completed as part of the study of the Kitchen Branch,
B. J. Horton, and Keering sites. We conclude with a review of the research issues and
problems posed in the research design in light of these archeological findings.
To supplement the main narrative, we have included a number of appendices on
electronic disk related to regulatory correspondence and the initial testing interim report
(Appendices 1-1 through 1-4), feature (Appendix 6-1), and ceramic inventories and analyses
(Appendices 8-1 to 8-5, and 9-1) associated with the Kitchen Branch site. Radiometric

and thermoluminescence reports are included in Appendices 7-1 and 7-2, respectively.
Ceramic residue analysis data are included in Appendix 12-1. Appendix 14-1 provides
a ceramic analysis of the sherds from the Keering site while Appendices (6-1 through
16-3 are digital photographs of select artifacts from the Kitchen Branch and Keering site
analyses.

Administrative Matters
Testing excavations took place at the Kitchen Branch site from December of 2004 through
January 2005 under Antiquities Permit 3609. Completed as a joint project between
archeologists from Coastal Environments, Inc. and Archeological & Environmental
Consultants, LLC, fieldwork was directed by David B. Kelley (Coastal Environments, Inc.)
and Timothy K. Perttula (Archeological & Environmental Consultants, LLC.; co-Principal
Investigators) with the assistance of Bo Nelson (Project Archeologist). Additional field crew
working during the testing phase included Roger Bergstom, Melissa Brand, Jonathan
Decker, John Hogg, and Joanne Ryan. Aboriginal ceramics and lithics were analyzed by
Timothy K. Perttula while organic remains were investigated by Katherine M. Roberts
(floral) and David B. Kelley (faunal). Historic materials were analyzed by Joanne Ryan.
Data recovery excavations occurred on the site from May through June of 2007 under
Antiquities Permit 4473 Dr. James Karbula served as the projectâs initial Principal
Investigator (PI), working closely with Timothy K. Perttula who served as the excavations
co-PI with the assistance of Bo Nelson and Mason Miller (Project Archeologists). Additional
field crew included Brennan Bajdek, David Yelacic, Mark Walters, Matthew Stotts, Matthew
Cuba, Robert Lassen, Chris Kugler, James B. Harrison III, and Anthony Clay Newton.
Chester Walker, a subcontractor from Archaeo-Geophysical Associates, LLC., directed
geophysical investigations at the site prior to block excavations and completed post-field
data processing, analysis, and reporting. Macrobotanical identification was completed
by Leslie Bush while faunal analysis was conducted by LeeAnna Schniebs. Michael
Glascock and Jeffrey Ferguson of the University of Missouriâs Archaeometry Laboratory
directed instrumental neutron activation analysis of ceramic sherds from the site while
Leslie Cecil of Stephen F. Austin State University conducted petrographic interpretation of
ceramic thin sections. Coloradoâs PaleoResearch Institute, under the direction of Linda
Scott Cummings, completed absorbed and surficial residue analysis on an assortment of
ceramic sherds from the Kitchen Branch site assemblage. University of Texas at Austinâs
Texas Archeological Research Laboratoryâs (TARL) Marilyn Shoberg completed limited use
wear analysis on a selection of the Kitchen Branch siteâs lithics. All radiocarbon assays
were completed by specialists at Beta Analytic, under the direction of Darden Hood while
TL dates were provided by the University of Washingtonâs Dr. James Feathers.
All project-generated notes, forms, photographs, etc., and all collected artifacts from all
sites will be permanently curated at Texas State Universityâs Center for Archaeological
Studies in San Marcos in accordance with rules of procedure outlined in the ACT and in
compliance with Antiquities Permits 3609 and 4473.

Environmental and Cultural Setting
Timothy K. Perttula

Physiographic and Ecological Setting
The Kitchen Branch, Keering, and B. J. Horton sites are situated in the western portions
of the Piney Woods physiographic region of East Texas (see Diggs et al. 2006), but not far
(between 2â12 kilometers [km]) from the eastern boundary of the Post Oak Savannah
(Figures 2-1 and 2-2). More specifically, the Kitchen Branch site is on an alluvial terrace
remnant (276 ft. amsl) that is two meters (m) above Prairie Creekâs left (north) bank, a
major eastward-flowing tributary of Big Cypress Creek. The Keering site is located near
the headwaters of Prairie Creek, on an upland slope landform on the north side of the
creek. The B. J. Horton site, near the Post Oak Savanna and Piney Woods ecotone, is on an
upland landform on the north side of Walkers Creek, another important eastward-flowing
tributary of Big Cypress Creek.
The Piney Woods cover large parts of East Texas, characterized by medium-tall to tall
broadleaf deciduous forests in more mesic habitats. Shortleaf and loblolly pines are
common on upland fine sandy loam soils with adequate moisture. Small areas of tall grass
prairie may be present in upland and lowland communities throughout the region (e.g.,
Jordan 1981:Figure 4.1), though this is particularly the case in more xeric, sandy lands.
Bottomland communities along the major river and creek drainages, such as Big Cypress
Creek, contain a diverse hardwood and swamp forest (including cypress, tupelo, and sweet
gum), with natural levees and alluvial terraces, point bar deposits, old stream channels,
oxbow lakes, and backwater swamps. A less diverse bottomland hardwood community is
present along the smaller creeks and their tributaries.
The Post Oak Savannah is a narrow southwest-northeast trending woodland that marks
an ecotone between the more xeric Blackland Prairie to the west and south (Diggs et al.
2006:Figure 2) and the more mesic Piney Woods to the east. The woodlands in the Post
Oak Savannah consist of broadleaf deciduous forests, primarily including several species
of oak as well as hickory and pecan. Small areas of tall grass prairie are present in this
physiographic province (see Diggs et al. 2006:Figure 5) that run from the Colorado River
on the west to near the Trinity River on the east. Prehistorically, the closest prairie areas
would have been ca. 30 km to the northwest in the White Oak Creek valley. Bottomland
communities along the rivers and major tributaries in the Post Oak Savannah have a diverse
hardwood and/or swamp forest, including cypress, sweet gum, and other hardwoods that
tolerate periodic flood waters. These are found on natural levees and alluvial terraces,
point bar deposits, old stream channels and oxbow lakes.

The climate of the East Texas region is humid subtropical with a mean annual precipitation
in modern times of at least 100â125 centimeters (cm) across the region as a whole. There
are warm summers and mild winters. Periods of maximum rainfall occur in the spring
and fall seasons. The growing season is about 260 days or more, with the last freeze
occurring in March and the first freeze in late November. Droughts are also not uncommon
in the modern era, and dendrochronological analyses of tree rings for the last 1,000 years
suggest there were numerous wet and dry spells during that time (Stahle and Cleaveland
1994, 1995), including several lengthy droughts. Principal plants and animals in the region
are listed in Table 2-1.

Mid-nineteenth century (dating from 1837â1854) General Land Office records from
various parts of East Texas suggest that upland settings with very deep and well-drained
sandy soils supported an overstory consisting of a mixture of pine and oaks, including blue
oak, blackjack oak, post oak, and red oak. Some portion of these landform-soils settings
(probably with deep sandy sediments) in the Piney Woods probably also had pure stands of
pine. In the eastern and southern parts of the region, much of the steeply sloping uplands
in the Piney Woods had pines or pine-oak overstories, as would southern and steeper
upland slopes. However, as indicated by Perttula (2005:14â15 and Table 2-2) northern
and more gently sloping valley landforms appear to have been dominated by oaks.

12

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

In upland settings with thinner poorly-drained sandy sediments, the overstory in the Piney
Woods probably consisted of a variety of oaks (post oak, red oak, blackjack oak, bluejack
oak, and chinquapin oak) and hickory. Abundant nut mast would have been available
in these upland habitats on an annual basis. On landforms with deep and well-drained
loamy fine sand, such as more mesic lower valley slopes, toe slopes, and elevated alluvial
landforms, the vegetational overstory in mid-nineteenth century times across the region
had red oak and post oak trees, along with other hardwoods that are tolerant of periodic
flooding. At the time of the archeological investigations, vegetation at these sites was
primarily small to mature hardwoods and pine trees in the overstory, with understories of
small trees, bushes, and briars, along with grasses.

Soils and Geology
The Kitchen Branch site is situated in the Besner-Talco soil complex, with 0â2 percent
slopes (see Figure 2-1; Roberts 1990). The Besner-Talco complex sediments occur on
well-drained alluvial terraces adjacent to the larger streams in this area. Besner sediments
are deep and well-drained, with fine sandy loam A and E horizon sediments overlying BE1
and BE2 fine sandy loam sediments. In a typical Besner solum, these horizons are about
80 cm in thickness overlying loam and sandy clay loam Bt horizons (Roberts 1990:80).
Nahatche loam to silt loam soils occur in the Prairie Creek and Kitchen Branch floodplains,
and Iuka fine sandy loam sediments are present in the floodplain of smaller tributaries and
branches in the Prairie Creek valley. Upland sediments on both sides of the valley include
Kullit very fine sandy loam with 1â3 percent slopes, and Bowie fine sandy loam with 2â5
percent slopes, and these contain ferruginous sandstone and hematite concretions. Caddo
agricultural fields were likely established in the immediate proximity to the Kitchen Branch
site, because they were well-drained, and other fields may have been placed in the nearby
and relatively fertile Bowie and Kullit sandy loam soils, since they were also well-drained.

Holocene Environmental Change in East Texas and the Larger Caddo Area
The climate in East Texas has changed dramatically over time, which has affected the
biodiversity and carrying capacity of the region. This, in turn, likely influenced the
adaptations of Native American groups like the Caddo and their ancestors that lived in this
broad region, especially as they became more dependent upon cultivated plants after ca.
AD 1200â1300 (see Perttula 2008; Wilson 2011, 2012) and thus also more dependent
on sources of water and arable soils in what is a risky and occasionally drought-prone
environment.
Pollen data from Ferndale Bog (Holloway 1994) in the Ouachita Mountains of southeastern
Oklahoma, and from several bogs in Central Texas (Bousman 1998; Karbula et al. 2007),
indicate that the Late Pleistocene climate (ca. 11,000â14,000 years ago) was cool and
dry, and probably supported a grassland steppe. By 11,000 years ago, as the climate
became warmer and wetter, oak woodlands or oak savanna habitats would likely have been

Chapter 2

present throughout much of eastern Texas (and north into Oklahoma). These woodlands
were maintained for several thousand years: perhaps until 7,500 years ago, although
Bousman (1998:Figure 4) notes a period of open, grassland vegetation in Central Texas
between 9500â8750 BP. The Ferndale Bog pollen diagram (see Ferring 1994:Figure 4.5)
also points to a more open and grassy setting, based on decreasing oak pollen and a lower
pollen influx between ca. 8,000â9,200 years ago. Whether such a setting characterized
East Texas at that time is not known.
Between ca. 7,500â5,000/4,500 years ago, the Middle Holocene climate was quite
warm and dry, and Ferring (1995:24) suggests this was a period of significant reduction in
available biomass for Native American hunter-gatherers in the region. In the Ferndale Bog
area of southeastern Oklahoma, the vegetation was an oak-hickory-pine woodland, while
farther to the south and west in Central Texas, grasslands were dominant. Bousmanâs
(1998:210) palynological analyses led him to conclude that the grass cover was greatestâ
and the climate the driestâbetween 5500â4500 BP, while Ferring (1995:24) places the
very dry and warm episode between ca. 6500â5000 BP. The Late Holocene period after
ca. 4,500â5,000 years ago appears to have been one of fluctuating climatesâmoist or
dry cyclesâthat were generally wetter than during the preceding Middle Holocene period,
and more like modern climatic conditions. Ferring and Yates (1996:Figure 7.5) propose
that there were wetter years between ca. 5000â2000 BP and after 1000 BP, with a drier
cycle between 1,000â2,000 years ago when grassier conditions prevailed, but detailed
pollen analyses from cores in the upper Neches River basin have identified a significant
xeric phase between 3,000â4,000 years ago, and there was an expansion of grassland
vegetation from west to east in this part of East Texas (Albert 2007, 2011). With these
fluctuating climatic and rainfall conditions, oak-hickory-pine woodlands were probably the
principal vegetation in upland habitats in much of the East Texas lands (as they are today)
with a well-developed riverine forest in major floodplain settings like Big Cypress Creek and
its principal tributaries.
Supporting the drier and warmer cycle in the middle portion of the Late Holocene, the
Ferndale Bog pollen record indicates that the peak in pine pollen was between ca. 800â
1800 BP (Holloway 1994:Table I.2), while Bousman (1998:207) notes one grass spike or
peak in the Weakly Bog in Central Texas that dates about 1500â1600 years ago in the
Woodland period, with another between 400â500 BP. Stable carbon and oxygen isotopes
from mussel shells along Denton Creek in North Texas, however, point to a warm/dry peak
at ca. 2850 BP, and then again after 1500 BP (Brown 1998:164). Stable carbon isotope
values from humate samples in the Cooper Lake area of the upper Sulphur River basin in
Northeast Texas have C4-enriched peaks (i.e. higher C4 grasses in the biomass) around
2000 BP and 4000 BP (see Perttula 1999:Figure 2-4).
For the last 1,000 years or more, the broad period of relevance to the Caddo settlements
of the Kitchen Branch, B. J. Horton, and Keering sites, dendrochronological records (from
cypress trees and logs) are the most accurate and temporally sensitive data available
on Late Holocene environmental change (e.g., Stahle 1996). Fortunately, recent

dendrochronological research in Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana, as well as the Southeast
and Midwest U.S., by Stahle and Cleaveland (1988, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995) and Benson
et al. (2007, 2009) has compiled significant information on subtle but changing climatic
and rainfall conditions and trends for the general Trans-Mississippi South region, of which
East Texas is a part (see Schambach 2002:Figure 5.1).
Droughts are not uncommon in the region in modern times, and dendrochronological
analysis suggests there were numerous wet and dry spells between ca. AD 1000â1700,
just as there were between 5,000â1,000 years ago. Some of the worse droughts may have
occurred around AD 1555, 1570, 1595, and 1670, and the period between AD 1549 and
1577 has been suggested to have had the worse droughts in the past 450 years (Stahle et
al. 1985), at least in parts of the mid-continent. Another severe droughty period appears to
have taken place between about AD 1440â1475, around the beginning of the Titus phase.
Fields and Gadusâ (2012:Figure 1.6) review of a broad-ranging data base on droughts
in this part of Northeast Texasâand their severity based on the Palmer Drought Severity
Indexâindicates that the worst droughts took place in the AD 1440sâ1450s and the AD
1560s. Other significant periods of drought (listed by decreasing severity) occurred in the
AD 1340sâ1350s, AD 1640s, AD 1360sâ1380s, ca. AD 1510, the AD 1760sâ1770, ca.
AD 1530, and the AD 1720s.
More detailed dendrochronological analyses from bald cypress tree-ring chronologies
on spring rainfall between AD 1002â1988 from Big Cypress State Park in northwestern
Louisiana indicate the wettest years were between AD 1053â1057, 1168â1176, 1178â
1180, 1265â1268, 1323â1328, 1553â1555, 1584â1586, 1718â1719, 1797â1800,
1810â1812, and 1866â1873 (Figure 2-3 and Table 2-2). These wetter years as a block
of time would likely have been optimal growing years for prehistoric and early historic
Caddo agricultural groups dispersed across a wooded landscape, assuming a correlation
between crop production and spring precipitation values (cf. Anderson et al. 1995:265).
Generally warmer and wetter conditions are optimal for increasing âthe net yield and
predictability of the maize crop, raising the economic potential of this resource relative to
othersâ (Greenlee 2006:222). The wetter rainfall conditions would also likely have led to
an increase in the extent of swamp and wetland habitats in the major stream basins, and
a concomitant expansion in the carrying capacity of woodland plants and animals in the
area.
Conversely, the driest years in prehistoric and early historic times in East Texasâbetween
AD 1014â1016, 1215â1217, 1444â1447, 1455â1460, 1529â1533, 1653â1655, and
1697â1699âmay well have led to periods of stressed food supplies, as well as lessened
the ability of Caddo groups to produce sufficient and predictable food reserves from the
cultivation of tropical cultigens across the region, to maintain seed stock for future crops,
and would have hindered the success of any maize harvests during these extended periods.
The drier periods did not influence the character of Caddo settlement systems, which
remained dispersed in character throughout the prehistoric and early historic periods, but
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

it did influence their distribution across the landscape, as Caddo agricultural populations
began to concentrate in the Piney Woods and along certain major streams (i.e. the Red, the
lower Sulphur, the middle Sabine, and certain parts of the Neches-Angelina river basins).
The very dry years between AD 1444 and 1460 correlate well with the grass spike/drier
episode noted by Bousman (1998) from the Weakly Bog pollen record. These more significant
droughts probably also affected the constancy of flow in the numerous upland springs in
the area, as well as the volume of flow in the major and minor stream basins. This in turn
would have influenced the relative quantity of animal and plant foods in floodplain and
upland forested habitats. The very droughty years between 1841â1846 correlate closely
with the final abandonment of East Texas by the Caddo, though increasing settlement of
this area by Europeans and Americans surely also played a role in the regionâs indigenousâ
abandonment. Stahle and Cleavelandâs (1988) drought reconstruction for North Texas
indicates that three of the driest years between 1698â1980 occurred in 1855, 1857,
1859, and 1855 was the driest year in that 282 year record.
For the period of wet and dry spells from ca. AD 1000â1650, the wetter years (>1400
standard ring width indices [sri]) were more than two times as frequent as the driest and
droughty (<560 sri) years (see Figure 2-2). After ca. AD 1430, the wetter years occurred
less often, some 55 percent less between AD 1600â1700 than in the ca. AD 1200â1400

period. These very different paleoenvironmental conditions over long periods of
time surely must have played an important role in East Texas in human adaptations.
These conditions may also have influenced changes to the landscape brought
about by significant erosion (and the transportation of sandy sediments), stream
down-cutting, and the formation, preservation, or degradation of landforms that
contain, or once contained, traces of human occupation.
When the Kitchen Branch site was first occupied in a substantial manner by
Caddo groups, ca. the early 15th century AD, conditions were relatively equitable,
with a mesic climate and abundant precipitation. It is likely that Caddo farmers in
this region created larger cleared areas through their horticultural practices, and
also used deliberately-set fires to open forest lands (cf. Wagner 2003:133â138).
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Chapter 2

By AD 1444, droughty conditions ensured for much of the next 16 years (until AD 1460).
During this time it was generally drier and colder, with much drier and colder climatic
minima at ca. 500 and 300 years ago as identified by changes in reconstructed solar
radiation (Bradley et al. 2003:Figure 6-13; Perttula and Nelson 2004:Figure 4). There
were mesic (warmer and wetter) intervals particularly after 410 years ago (see Table 2-2),
but the driest conditions during this period (and indeed over the last 1,000 years) occurred
between AD 1446â1460.

Cultural Setting
The main purpose of this section of Chapter 2 is to summarize the current state of
knowledge concerning the prehistoric and early historic archeological record of the Big
Cypress Creek basin and Northeast Texas regions (Figure 2-4). Much attention is given
to the Late Caddo period (ca. AD 1450â1680) archeological record, particularly the Titus
phase in the Cypress Creek basin, because knowledge of this span of Caddo prehistory
is reasonably well-developed (e.g., Fields and Gadus 2012; Thurmond 1985, 1990a;
Turner 1978, 1992; Perttula 1992, 1998, 2005, 2012; Perttula et al. 1998; Perttula and
Sherman 2009; Rogers et al. 2003), the Kitchen Branch, B. J. Horton, and Keering sites
were occupied almost exclusively in the Titus phase, and because a focus on the Titus
phase provides the best opportunity to understand what prehistoric Caddo culture was like
immediately before, and after, Europeans invaded the area.
Native Americans settled in the Big Cypress Creek basin of Northeast Texas some 12,000
years ago or more, and ranged through its forests, grasslands, and broad floodplains and
wetlands as mobile hunter-gatherers-fishers. The Native American settlement of Northeast
Texas is a story that began over 11,000 years ago, and according to Schambach (1993:1),
âis long, complex, and endlessly fascinating.â From the archeological record of this region,
one may grasp bits and pieces of the tale: the mobile Paleoindian and Archaic foragers; the
long-distance trade and exchange of goods (i.e. lithic raw materials); the development of
sedentary communities of foragers and possibly pre-maize cultigen users (e.g., Fritz 1994);
the adoption of ceramics and the bow and arrow; the development of complex Caddo
horticultural and agricultural societies; the use of earthen mounds; and the seemingly
rapid abandonment of much of the region in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries due
in large measure to the effects of European-introduced diseases as well as the European
colonization of traditional Caddo territory, followed by the permanent expulsion of Caddo
groups. Many of the archeological details of these events and developments are wellknown (see especially Story 1990; Perttula 1995, 2004).
About 2000â2500 years ago, these Native Americans, ancestral to Caddo peoples living
there in historic times (e.g., Bolton 1987; Swanton 1942), began to settle down within
distinct territories, began to use native seeds and tropical cultigens, and developed the art
of ceramics. From this hunting-gathering-horticultural milieu, the vibrant and sophisticated
prehistoric Caddo culture developed after ca. AD 800 (e.g., Story 1990) across Northeast
Texas, Northwest Louisiana, Southwest Arkansas, and eastern Oklahoma. The prehistoric
18

Caddo people were prosperous horticulturists and traders who lived in dispersed sedentary
hamlets and villages, and built temples and burial mounds that marked the ceremonial
and religious places of important priests and chiefs. The Caddo continued to live in this
part of Northeast Texas (particularly in the vicinity of Caddo Lake) until as late as 1842,
until they moved to the Brazos River in the 1840sâ1850s, and then were removed to
Oklahoma in 1859 (Smith 1995, 1996).

Figure 2-4. Study area within Texasâ Archeological Regions (Turner and Hester 1999:Figure 4.2).

The cornerstone of our knowledge of the prehistoric use of the region is based in large
measure on the 1920â1930s excavations of aboriginal sites and cemeteries (Pearce
1920, 1932; Jackson 1933, 1934) in the Cypress, Sabine, and Sulphur basins by the
University of Texas. Since then, most of the information about the Paleoindian, Archaic,
Early Ceramic, and Caddoan archeological record in the region comes from avocational
archeological investigations (see for example, Harris et al. 1980; Jones 1957, 1968;

1969), along with extensive professional archeological work in a number of state and
federally-funded or permitted reservoirs and associated facilities in the Sulphur, Sabine,
and Cypress stream basins (Bruseth and Perttula 1981; Cliff 1994; Cliff and Beene 1996;

1991, 1993; McCormick 1973, 1974; Nash et al. 1995; Perttula et al. 1998; Perttula and

Fields and Gadus 2012; Gadus et al. 2006), Oak Hill Mine (Rogers et al. 2001; Rogers and
Perttula 2004); and the Leesburg Mine (Sherman et al. 2004a, 2004b, 2011). TxDOTsponsored archeological projects have also contributed important information on Archaic
to Titus phase components in the region (see Cliff and Perttula 2002; Lohse 2005; Ricklis
2004; Rogers et al. 2003). Hunt et al. (1996) completed the cultural resources evaluation
for the Pilgrimâs Pride Corporation of a 90 acre tract in Camp County, and west of U.S. 271.
A Late Caddo Titus phase cemeteryâthe B. J. Horton siteâwas located within the tract (see
Chapter 11, this volume), while Perttula (2005) completed data recovery excavations at
a large Titus phase village at the Pilgrimâs Pride site prior to planned plant construction.

Paleoindian and Early Archaic Periods
For the period prior to about 7,000â8,000 years ago during the Early Archaic, and extending
back as long ago as ca. 13,000 years BP (Waters and Stafford 2007), the Northeast Texas
archeological record primarily consists of surficial, mixed, or isolated finds of temporally
diagnostic projectile points (cf. Johnson 1989; Story 1990), based on comparisons with
well-dated stratified sites to the east and west of the region (cf. Anderson et al. 1996:15;
Collins 2004; Waters et al. 2011). Discrete archeological components are present in the
region, as shown by the spatially discrete Late Paleoindian John Pearce site (Webb et al.
1971), and the extensive buried Early to Middle Archaic settlement at the Conly site along
Loggy Bayou in the Red River basin (Girard et al. 2011), but they have proven to be quite
difficult to define and recognize (Fields 1997). In East Texas, no intact Early Archaic sites
are even known.
Paleoindian materials have been recovered at a number of archeological sites in the
Cypress Creek basin of Northeast Texas (see Johnson 1989:Figures 3, 10, 16; Story
1990:Figures 26â29). The early Paleoindian (ca. 11,500â10,500 years BP, corrected
but not calibrated) archeological materials include Clovis and Folsom fluted lanceolate
points, commonly manufactured on high-quality non-local lithic raw materials, along with
scraping tools (Story 1990:Table 44). Unfluted lanceolatesâcommonly resharpened and
beveledâdominate the Late Paleoindian period (ca. 10500â9500 years BP) material
culture record in the region, including Dalton (Johnson 1989:Figure 7), Plainview, San
20

Patrice, and Scottsbluff points, as well as early side-notched points and Albany beveled
bifaces or knives (see Webb et al. 1971; Johnson 1989:Figure 13), Quince-style scrapers,
and bifacial adzes. Sites of this age throughout the Trans-Mississippi South tend to occur
near major drainages (such as the Red River) or in resource-rich areas, along Ouachita
Mountains and Ozark Mountains escarpments (Anderson 1996b). Locally, at the Forrest
Murphey site (41MR62), Clovis, Plainview, Dalton, and other lanceolate projectile point
forms and tools were found in several discrete concentrations on a high terrace above Big
Cypress Creek at the Lake Oâ the Pines dam site; faunal remains from extinct elephants
were also recovered in apparent association (Story 1990), which is rather rare (see Meltzer
and Bever 1995).
Anderson (1996a:Figure 3.2) has postulated that the initial and most intensive Paleoindian
settlement of the Southeast took place in the resource-rich valleys of the Mississippi, Ohio,
Tennessee, and Cumberland rivers. From there, Paleoindian groups settled throughout
the wooded Southeast and East, with concentrations at 250â400 kilometer intervals,
indicating the scale of movement of these highly mobile foragers. As with much of the
Southeast, the distributions of Paleoindian artifacts within the Cypress Creek basin
suggests that these early occupations were principally situated within the valleys of major
stream basins (Anderson 1996a; Thurmond 1990a:Table 53 and 54; Perttula 2004). The
relatively sparse Paleoindian archeological record, as well as the dispersion of artifacts
on many landforms (but especially alluvial terraces and upland projections) and different
settings within the region, seems to indicate that the Paleoindian groups occupying this
part of Northeast Texas were very mobile hunters and gatherers of a variety of resources
rather than specialized hunters of extinct megafauna (Fields and Tomka 1993:82).
Johnson (1989:53â54) also suggests that some of the Paleoindian archeological remains
(particularly Plainview and Scottsbluff projectile points and Cody knives) from the region
are a result of Plains Late Paleoindian (ca. 10,000â9,000 years ago) groups that moved
into (or âinvadedâ according to Johnson [1989:53] in the case of the Cody people) parts
of Northeast Texas during periods when grassland habitat spread eastward to exploit the
plains resources (such as bison) found there.

Middle and Late Archaic Period
The Middle Archaic period begins at ca. 8000 years BP, based on research conducted in
the Caddo area, especially in Louisiana (Girard et al. 2011) and Arkansas (Trubitt 2009).
What have we learned about the Archaic populations who lived in Northeast Texas after ca.
8,000 years ago? Recent paleoenvironmental research summarized by Ferring (1995:26)
suggests that much of the Archaic period, particularly the period between about ca. 8000â
4000 BP, was drier than today, with apparent reductions in biomass as well as the local
expansion of prairie habitats along the western margins of Northeast Texas. Nevertheless,
drier conditions and changing vegetation conditions âclearly did not preclude occupationsâ
(Ferring 1995:33) during these periods. While the archeological data are still rather limited,
it appears that group mobility remained high for these hunting-gathering foragers during
the Early Archaic (ca. 8000â6000 years BP), and group territories were large and poorly

defined, with most sites conforming to what Thurmond (1990a:41) called âheavyâ and
âlimited-useâ areas; that is, repeated and recurrent occupations by small groups. Anderson
(1996b) has suggested that such Archaic groups had highly mobile foraging adaptations
along the Red River, the central Sabine River, and in interior uplands away from major
drainages, with expedient lithic technologies. Most sites of this age were briefly used, but
tended to concentrate in the larger drainages within the region.
By the Middle Archaic period (ca. 8000â5000 years BP) in the Sabine River and Cypress
Creek drainages, fairly substantial and extensive occupations are recognized within the
major basins, with a rather limited use of smaller tributaries and headwater areas (see
Thurmond 1990a:Figure 9), where Middle Archaic âheavy useâ sites occur along Big and
Little Cypress Creek, or on tributaries near their confluence with Big Cypress Creek. Burned
rock features (possible hearths, ovens, and cooking pits?) and burned rock concentrations
are present in dated Middle Archaic contexts (a calibrated date of 4040â4161 BC has
been obtained on a burned rock feature at the Unionville site [41CS151]) at a few sites
(see Gadus et al. 1992; Cliff et al. 1996a), suggesting the cooking and processing of
plant foods was an important activity by this time, but mainly by small groups for shortterm use (Fields et al. 1997:90). Lithic raw material data from a possible Middle Archaic
assemblage at Lake Fork Reservoir suggests that the exchange of non-local materials
(particularly finished tools) was common place (Perttula 1984), although âpatterns in raw
material use were not uniform across Northeast Texasâ (Fields and Tomka 1993:92), and
in general, the use of non-local raw materials was not common. At Cooper Lake in Archaic
contexts, the non-local lithics that are present primarily originated to the north in the Red
River basin (Fields 1995; Fields et al. 1997).
Late Archaic sites (ca. 5000â2500 years BP) are widely distributed in the Cypress Creek
basin and adjoining river basins, occurring along the major streams, near springs, on springfed branches, upland ridges, and on tributary drainages of all sizes (cf. Thurmond 1990a;
Cliff and Peter 1992; Cliff and Hunt 1995; Dixon et al. 1995; Cliff et al. 1996a). Indeed,
the distribution of Late Archaic sites suggests these groups moderately to extensively used
almost every part of the region. Anderson (1996b) notes major site concentrations of Late
Archaic sites along the Red and Little Rivers in Arkansas and Louisiana, as well as in the
Ozarks and Ouachita Mountains. Aboriginal populations apparently remained generalized
foragers, and there was evidence of apparent population growth. In fact, the most intensive
use of the Northeast Texas Piney Woods and Post Oak Savannah was by Woodland and
Late Archaic hunter-gatherers. The intensity of use increased substantially between the
Late Archaic and the Woodland period, suggesting that population size (and numbers of
sites) continued to increase in the region after 2500 years BP. There are only a few welldated Late Archaic period components known in the region, unfortunately.
A few Late Archaic occupations in the Piney Woods and Post Oak Savanna of Northeast Texas
are known that contain earthen middens (i.e. the Yarbrough site along the Sabine River),
but in general sites of this period contain burned rock features, and/or concentrations of
burned rock, as well as small pits. The Late Archaic occupation in area C at the Unionville

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

site (41CS151) had a buried anthrosol, or buried surface, that had been darkened or
stained by cultural activities (Cliff et al. 1996a); within the anthrosol were two clusters
of burned rock features. Large pits and rock hearths in a Late Archaic component at the
Herman Ballew site (41RK222) have calibrated dates that range from 380â1590 BC. At
the Mockingbird site (41TT550) on Hayes Creek in the Big Cypress Creek basin, the Late
Archaic period component dated between 410â830 BC contained only scattered burned
rocks and low amounts of stone tools and projectile points, suggesting it was used only
as a temporary encampment or âlimited-useâ area (see Dixon et al. 1995). A much more
extensive Archaic use of the Tankersley Creek drainage basin has been documented in
Middle and Late Archaic period components at 41TT373 (Kotter et al. 1993), where burned
rocks from hearth construction and use were relatively abundant, along with projectile
points, tools, and bifacial and flake debris. These settlement data are compatible with
higher population densities, limited group mobility but a wide dispersion of camp and
foraging areas, the possible establishment of definable territorial ranges, and a welldeveloped foraging economy based on the hunting and gathering of local food resources.
By the onset of the Late Archaic, changes in the distribution of prairie and forest areas, due
to generally wetter conditions after ca. 5000 BP than was the case during the preceding
Middle Archaic period, were much as they are in modern times. The known distribution,
availability, and predictability of food resources in the region at this time apparently led
to a substantial increase in American Indian population sizes that continued through the
Woodland period and into the post-AD 800 Caddo periods.
No paleobotanical evidence is available that indicates the Late Archaic populations in
Northeast Texas cultivated native plant species (i.e. such as sumpweed, sunflower, and
chenopod), as was the case by the first millenium BC. in many parts of Eastern North
America (Fritz 1994:25â27). Nutshells and Psoralea sp. (prairie turnip) are documented
in Late Archaic components at the Unionville site (Cliff et al. 1996a; Cliff and Hunt 1995).
The relatively high use of local lithic raw materials (typically upland gravel sources) during
the Late Archaic in the Sabine, Sulphur, and Cypress basins speaks to a more confined
interregional interaction at this time (Fields and Tomka 1993; Perttula and Bruseth 1998).
By contrast, in the Mississippi River basin of northern Louisiana, Late Archaic sites are
marked by extensive quantities of non-local lithic raw materials, particularly novaculite and
Ozark cherts (Saunders and Allen 1997:19).

Woodland Period
The Woodland period (ca. 2500â1150 years BP) in this part of Northeast Texas is recognized
primarily by plain and relatively thick ceramic bowls and âflowerpotâ-shaped jars (although
ceramics, especially Williams Plain ceramics, are not abundant on Woodland period sites
outside of the Red River and lower Sulphur River areas), double-bitted axe heads, the
smaller and thinner Gary projectile points and Kent points, and later in the period by small
corner-notched arrowpoints (Schambach 1998, 2001; Thurmond 1990a). North of the
Sulphur River and in contiguous areas in southwestern Arkansas, northwestern Louisiana,

AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Chapter 2

and southeastern Oklahoma, such Woodland cultures have been called Fourche Maline by
Schambach (1998, 2001).
In several instances, as at the Resch (41HS16), Bert Davis, Herman Ballew (41RK222),
Tankersley Creek (41TT108), and Folly (41RK26) sites, Lower Mississippi Valley (LMV)
related ceramics (such as Tchefuncte Stamped, Churupa Incised, Marksville Incised,
Troyville Stamped, and Marksville Stamped) occur with some frequency in Woodland
period components in the Sabine River and Big Cypress Creek drainages (Rogers et al.
2001; Story 1990:246, 303, 312; Thurmond 1988, 1990a; Webb et al. 1969; see also
Young 1981). Later LMV Coles Creek period ceramics (and expanding stem arrowpoints
similar to the Colbert and Friley types) are present in notable quantities in several sites
along the Sabine River, particularly at James Pace in a context dated between ca. 1300â
1000 years BP (Girard 1994) as well as in ca AD 1000 contexts at the Mound Pond site
(41HS12) on Big Cypress Creek. Likely similar dated contexts in the Upper Sabine River
basin have ceramic assemblages dominated by horizontally incised decorative motifs, and
Friley arrowpoints occur in association (see Bruseth and Perttula 1981).
While there is much archeologists do not know about the Woodland period peoples of
Northeast Texas, what has been learned over the last 40 years or so is that they were
still primarily hunter-gatherers who lived in increasingly larger groups and resided for
longer periods of time at certain sites. The fact that some Woodland period sites in the
area have relatively substantial midden deposits, and some evidence for structures
(probably daubed pole and thatch structures), suggests more intensive occupations and a
decreased residential mobility, but the degree of permanence is still less than that seen in
the subsequent long-term Caddo settlement of Northeast Texas (Perttula, Fields, Corbin,
and Kenmotsu 1993:99), and considerably less than documented by Schambach (2001,
2002) at Fourche Maline sites in the Red River basin. On the basis of available information,
Woodland period groups may have cultivated squash, and used native seeds and tubers/
roots, as well as a wide variety of woodland and aquatic animal resources.
Thurmondâs (1990a) analysis of prehistoric sites in the Big Cypress Creek basin suggests
that Woodland period sites are not very common, perhaps because the area received only
limited use during this time period (e.g., Story 1990:310. As Story (1990:310) points out,
however, most known Woodland period components in the basin were âlimited use sites
(i.e. rather short term camps) and that only a few...were small settlements.â The Woodland
period components that are known tend to occur on upland projections and upland
slopes along both major and minor streams (Thurmond 1990a; see also Cliff 1994). One
such Woodland period component (three calibrated dates at 1-sigma ranging between
AD 600â880; another calibrated date of AD 140â260 hints at an earlier use of the site
during the Woodland period as well) has been investigated at 41TT372, situated on the
top of an upland ridge above the Tankersley Creek floodplain (Dixon et al. 1995), as well
as at 41TT370 in the same drainage (Kotter et al. 1993). Particularly notable about the
occupation at 41TT372 were several burned rock features and quantities of burned rock
from the apparent cooking and processing of plant foods, and the absence of ceramics.
24

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

Burned rock features, including a concentration of burned rocks covering an area of ca.
120 m2, were also identified in an Woodland period component at 41TT409 that dates
about 1650â1800 years BP (Kotter et al. 1993). This site is on an upland ridge at the
headwaters of Piney Creek, a tributary to White Oak Creek.
By contrast, Woodland period settlements are common throughout the Sulphur River basin,
and several archeological components of this age have been extensively investigated
at Cooper Lake in the upper Sulphur River basin (Fields et al. 1997)âincluding the
Spike (41DT16), Tick (41DT6), Luna (41DT52), Johns Creek (41DT62), and Hurricane
Hill (41HP106) sites, as well as at the Snipes site (41CS8) in the lower Sulphur basin
(Jelks 1961). Spike, Tick, and Hurricane Hill have middens and burials, while burials
(flexed, bundle, and cremation) in a small cemetery, pits, post holes, and a hearth were
excavated on the Southwest rise at Hurricane Hill (Perttula 1997, 1999; see also Fields
et al. 1997:91â92), suggesting this part of the site was intensively used for domestic and
mortuary purposes during the early part of the Woodland period.
No Woodland period burial mounds have been definitively documented in Northeast
Texas (Story 1990:310), although they have been found in bluff top and alluvial valley
settings on the Red River in Northwestern Louisiana and Southwest Arkansas (Schambach
1982, 1997; Webb 1984), and on the Angelina, Neches, and Sabine rivers in Deep East
Texas (Story 1990; see also Jensen 1968). The two or three mounds at the James Pace
site on the Sabine River did not, however, apparently serve as platforms for burials or
structures, or as caps for these features, and their functional significance is equivocal
(Girard 1994:15). The appearance of burial mounds (and mounds covering crematoria)
at sites like Coral Snake in the broader region around Northeast Texas does suggest that
more complexly organized local groups did develop during the Woodland period in these
localities (Schambach 1997, 2002).

Formative to Middle Caddo period
During the Formative (ca. AD 800â1000), Early (ca. AD 1000â1200), and Middle (ca. AD
1200â1400) Caddo period occupation of Northeast Texas, Caddo archeological sites of
these ages are quite common throughout the Big Cypress Creek basin and adjoining river
basins (Thurmond 1990a; Story 1990; Cliff et al. 1996b; Fields et al. 1997). Furthermore,
the Cooper Lake area on the south Sulphur River appears to have been âused most
intensively by Native Americansâ between ca. AD 800 to 1300 (Fields et al. 1997:75).
Formative to Middle Caddo period sites are situated primarily on elevated landforms (alluvial
terraces and rises, natural levees, and upland edges) adjacent to the major streams, or in
the stream valleys themselves, as well as along minor tributaries and spring-fed branches.
Proximity to arable sandy loam soils were preferred for settlement locations, presumably
because of good drainage for habitation, and for cultivation purposes. The majority of
these Caddo sites are:

permanent settlements that have evidence of the structures, including posts, pits,
and features marking their residency, along with the cemeteries and graves where
the dead were buried; the middens where the animal and plant food refuse was
discarded amidst broken stone tools and pottery vessels; and the material remains
of tools and ceramics used in the procurement and processing of the bountiful
resources of the region. They represent the settlements of Caddoan communities
and sociopolitical entities, and the civic-ceremonial centers that were their focus
(Perttula 1993:125).
The distribution of Caddo settlements across the landscape suggests that all habitats
were used to some extent, either intensively as locations for the dispersed sedentary
communities, households, and farmsteads, or periodically by groups in logistical camps
where specific natural resources could be procured by the Caddo in bulk. The many
resources that were needed by sedentary Middle Caddo populations living in the region
could best be exploited by dispersing the groups in a variety of settings. Along the Red
River, and probably on the other large streams or rivers in the region, a particular focus
of settlement was along natural levees in recently abandoned meander belts, and these
habitats âserved as an ideal context for a dispersed communityâ in a major floodplain
landscape (Girard 1997:156).
The most common types of Caddo settlements in the region during these periods appear
to be small hamlets and farmsteads (Cliff 1997; Cliff et al. 1996a; Largent et al. 1996;
Perttula et al. 1986; Thurmond 1990a), sometimes in association with small household
cemeteries (see Goldschmidt 1935). In the Monticello B-2 Mine area, for example, Early
and Middle Caddo period components at 41TT372 are interpreted as a âseasonal campsite
or a small family-based agricultural farmstead, at least on a periodic basisâ (Dixon et al.
1995:235), principally because of the lack of middens or structural features. Similar
and generally contemporaneous small (but mainly Middle Caddo period in age based
on the frequency of brushed ceramics) settlements have been investigated at 41TT392,
41TT396, 41TT400, 41TT406, and 41TT409 (Nash et al. 1995) in the headwater areas of
Piney Creek, at 41TT154 in the Tankersley Creek drainage (Kotter et al. 1993), and at the
Hickory Hill site (41CP408) in the Little Cypress Creek drainage (Perttula and Ellis 2012).
At Lake Bob Sandlin on Big Cypress Creek, more than 10 percent of all the components
(n=245) identified in this area have Middle Caddo components (Nelson and Perttula
2003:Table 7). With respect to the number of components per 100 years from Paleoindian
times to the late seventeenth century AD, only Late Caddo components have a higher
value (14.64 sites per 100 years) than does the Middle Caddo period (11.00 sites per
100 years). Gadus et al. (2006:132â133) note that there was intensive Middle Caddo
domestic settlement in the Starkey Creek area of the middle Sabine River basin, indicating
that the Caddo peoples âlived in small hamlets or on single farmsteads located on
productive agricultural soils.â Many of the +1200 radiocarbon dates available from East
Texas archeological sites pertain to occupations of Middle Caddo period age (Perttula and
Selden 2011). Using calibrated ages and median calibrated age ranges, the largest number
of Caddo radiocarbon dates fall within the AD 1201â1300 interval (Perttula 1998). While
26

AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

the number of dates in this period is probably inflated to some degree by the extensive
series of dates from the George C. Davis site (see Story 1997, 2000), it does appear to
be the case that Middle Caddo period occupations are rather commonplace throughout
much of East Texas (Middlebrook and Perttula 1997) and in the Big Cypress Creek basin,
supporting the broad findings of the radiocarbon dates from the region.
Early and Middle Caddo period components at the Unionville site (41CS151), Area C,
41CS150, 41CS155/156, Area B, 41BW553, and 41TT670 along White Oak Creek had
well-preserved middens, hearths, post holes, and other features (Cliff et al. 1996a; Cliff
and Hunt 1995; Largent et al. 1996). Similar kinds of Early Caddo components have been
identified at the Spike, Thomas (41DT80), Doctorâs Creek (41DT124) and Spider Knoll
(41DT11) sites at Cooper Lake. The latter site had numerous post holes (from two possible
structures and drying racks or arbors), pits, and a large midden deposit (Fields et al.
1997:93â96). The North rise at Hurricane Hill had a similar array of features and extensive
midden deposits dating from ca. AD 1000â1200, including portions of two structures,
several middens, hearths, burials, and pits (Fields et al. 1997:99â101), while the South
rise had three structures, middens, burials, a dog burial, features, and an extensive Caddo
ceramic assemblage from a Middle Caddo period component dated about AD 1250â1375.
The Middle Caddo Tigert site (41TT36) on Hart Creek had a small midden and an associated
burial with grave goods (Brown 1975), while the Middle Caddo period component at the
Griffin Mound (41UR142) in the Little Cypress Creek drainage contained a dense midden
and a large (+ 2 m in diameter and 1 m in depth) storage pit feature, probably associated
with a Caddo structure (Nelson et al. 1994). At the Bensonâs Crossing site (41TT110) on
an alluvial terrace along Big Cypress Creek, occupied perhaps during the latter part of the
Middle Caddo period (ca. AD 1300â1400), Driggers (1985:96) suggests that the Caddo
occupation/midden there was the product of at least two extended families living in a
farmstead or small hamlet for more than 20â30 years.
Larger communities (covering more than 10 acres) have also been recognized that occur in
association with mound centers, such as the large settlements at George C. Davis (41CE19,
see Story 2000; Walker 2009; Schultz 2010), Hale (41TT12), Boxed Springs (41UR30, see
Perttula 2011, ed.), Hudnall-Pirtle (41RK4; see Bruseth 1991; Bruseth and Perttula 2006),
and Pine Tree Mound (41HS15) (Fields 2008; Fields and Gadus 2012). These mound
centers have extensive habitation areas, plazas, and spatially restricted temple and burial
mound locales. Shaft burials of high status individuals have been documented in mound
contexts at the George C. Davis site (Story 1997, 1998, 2000) and a few other mound
centers (such as Washington Square [41NA49)], Boxed Springs, and Sanders [41LR2];
see Corbin and Hart 1998; Hamilton 1997; Jackson et al. 2000; Perttula 2009a, 2011,
ed.), and they also occur in non-mound contexts at several sites along the Red River during
earlier Caddo times (see Bruseth 1998), at the Charlie Crews site (41WD371; see Perttula
et al. 1987) in the Sabine River basin, and at the Pine Tree Mound site.

Certainly the most thoroughly studied large Caddo community in the region that was
occupied in the Middle Caddo period is the George C. Davis site, a large village and mound
center on the Neches River. Recent remote sensing investigations indicate that there are
more than 150 structures in the village areas around the three mounds on site (Creel et al.
2005; Walker 2009, 2011). Calibrated radiocarbon dates from village contexts establish
that the site was occupied beginning by the mid-ninth century AD in the Formative Caddo
period, and then was continuously settled until the end of the 13th century AD (Story
2000). A large number of structures were built on, and adjacent to, Mound A, and the
extensive structure rebuilding there indicates the area was preferred for settlement by the
Caddo. Calibrated dates from a few contexts suggest that the site was inhabited to some
degree as late as ca. AD 1350 (see Story 1997). There were three mounds at the Davis
site, including Mound A (a flat-topped platform), Mound C (burial mound) built over a large
pre-mound burial pit in the latter part of the Formative Caddo period and containing an
estimated 25â30 elite burial pits, and Mound B (a second flat-topped platform) constructed
about AD 1200 or slightly earlier (Story 1997, 1998).
One of the more significant Middle Caddo sites investigated in the Piney Woods, the Oak
Hill Village (41RK214), estimated to date between ca. AD 1150â1450 and including three
temporally discrete villages, has at least 42 circular and rectangular structures. Some
of the structures had been rebuilt and some overlapped earlier structures, particularly
at the northwestern end of the ridge and plaza, and they were arranged over the 3.5
acre village in a circular pattern around a central plaza area (Rogers and Perttula 2004;
Perttula and Rogers 2007). Several small structures on the eastern side of the plaza have
been identified as possible granaries for the storage of harvested corn; a similar granary
feature was identified at the Musgano site (41RK19) by Clark and Ivey (1974) and the
Whelan site (41MR2, Davis et al. 2010:27). A small mound (covering a burned circular
structure) is at the north end of the Oak Hill Village site, and several midden deposits
have been identified that appear to be associated with individual structures. Two large
circular structures have extended entranceways that pointed towards the plaza, and their
special form and orientation suggests they are probably public buildings used by the Oak
Hill Village community for special purposes; such structures are relatively common in
East Texas in Middle and Late Caddo contexts (Perttula 2009b:Figures 3, 5 and Table 1).
Ceramic analyses and radiocarbon dating indicate these structures were built after ca. AD
1350 during the extensive Late Village (Rogers and Perttula 2004).
Although farther afield, another important Middle Caddo period site is Tyson (41SY92)
in the Attoyac River basin, dating between cal AD 1336â1490. This settlement contains
evidence for structures and cooking and storage pit features, has extensive midden
deposits and well-preserved plant and animal remains, and a small cemetery of children.
Middlebrook (1994, 1997) suggests that the Tyson site represents the residence of a
caddi or chiefly elite. One of the calibrated dates from the Tyson site was on mussel shell
included as grave goods with Feature 14, the burial of two young children accompanied by
many grave goods (Middlebrook 1994:16). Among the burial offerings were eight ceramic
vessels near the head and feet of the child, two large paired deer antlers over the childâs
28

head (perhaps as part of a head dress), carved shell inlays near the head, two carved bone
ear spools, 32 Olivella shell beads, three columnella beads from a necklace, a turtle rattle,
a cache of mussel shell, smoothed stones, two pitted stones, a cache of six deer ulna awls
and two beaver teeth, and a cache of lithic pebble cores, flakes, preforms, and a notched
shell point (Middlebrook 1994:16).
These Formative-Middle Caddo groups seem to have been horticulturists, cultivating some
maize and squash, along with several kinds of native seeds (Perttula and Bruseth 1983),
gathered nuts and tubers/storage roots, and were proficient hunters of deer, fish, and
many other animal species. The available paleobotanical and bioarcheological evidence
from Northeast Texas (and elsewhere in the Caddo area, see Rose et al. 1998; Perttula
2008; Rogers 2011; Wilson 2011, 2012) does not indicate, however, that Caddoan groups
became dependent upon maize and other domesticated crops until after about AD 1300;
by ca. AD 1450, maize comprised more than 50 percent of the diet of many Caddo groups
(see Rose et al. 1998; Burnett 1990). In the Sulphur River basin in particular, however,
the use of cultivated plants appears to have been rather limited throughout the Formative
to Middle Caddo periods (Cliff 1997; Fields et al. 1997), with only small amounts of maize
and squash being recovered from the flotation of feature contents.
Both temple and burial mounds were built by these Piney Woods Caddo groups. The larger
sites are important civic-ceremonial centers containing multiple mounds and associated
villages. The multiple mound centers are rather evenly spaced along the Red River,
Sabine River, and Big Cypress Bayou, and those that are contemporaneous may represent
hierarchical systems of an âintegrated...regional network of interaction and redistributionâ
(Thurmond 1990a:234). The Jamestown (eight mounds and village), Boxed Springs (four
mounds, village, and large cemetery), and Hudnall-Pirtle (eight mounds and 60 acre village)
multiple mound centers appear to represent the apex of postulated local Early to Middle
Caddo networks or political communities in the Sabine River basin, along with that of the
Pine Tree Mound (41HS15) community, established in the 14th century AD farther down
the river (Fields and Gadus 2012). The McKenzie (41WD55) site in the middle Sabine
River drainage has a single sub-structural mound that dates between cal AD 1298â1470
(see Granberry 1995), and there are contemporaneous mounds covering structures with
extended entranceways at the Redwine (41SM193) and Bryan Hardy (41SM55) sites (see
Walters and Haskins 1998, 2000), also in the middle Sabine. The 14th century AD Middle
Caddo occupation at Redwine also included an extensive midden deposit, hearth and pit
features and a small cemetery with extended supine burials. A Middle Caddo component
at the Frank Benson site (41TT310) (Perttula and Nelson 2002) on Big Cypress Creek had
a ca. 12 x 11-m clay-capped mound built over a burned wattle and daub-covered structure.
The distribution, number, and spacing of mound centers, particularly the sites with
multiple mounds, in East Texas and adjoining parts of southwestern Arkansas (Lockhart
2012) and northwestern Louisiana (Girard 2011) clearly indicates that the Caddo peoples
who built and used these mounds were integrated into societies of considerable sociopolitical complexity. The premier mound centers in the Neches-Angelina river basins

includes George C. Davis and Washington Square (Story 1997; Corbin and Hart 1998).
The Washington Square mound complex is well-dated, with pooled radiocarbon dates
on charcoal, hardwood nutshells, and charred corn from features that range between
cal AD 1268 and 1302 (Corbin and Hart 1998:74 and Table 4); the overall range of the
calibrated dates at 2-sigma from the site suggest it was occupied by the Caddo between
ca. AD 1250â1450 (Hart and Perttula 2010). Extensive excavations documented a circular
structure under Mound 1/2, an assortment of pits and post holes in non-mound contexts,
and several large burial pits in a mortuary mound (the Reavely-House Mound). No clear
evidence for on-site permanent Caddo habitation was identified at Washington Square,
however, although an interesting assortment of large sherd-filled pits (representing many
vessels) were encountered in one area between Mound 1/2 and the mortuary mound
(see Corbin and Hart 1998:Figure 14). These may represent deposits from public feasting
activities led by the Caddo elite (e.g., Scott and Jackson 1998) that used the Washington
Square mound site as a ceremonial center in the 13th and 14th centuries.
The radiocarbon dating of the Washington Square and George C. Davis sites suggest that
the Washington Square Mound center began to flourish about the same time (after ca.
AD 1250) the George C. Davis site was diminishing in power and social authority. This
suggests that the Caddo community that built and used the Washington Square Mound
siteâmore advantageously located eastward at the nexus of north-south (later to be known
as the Caddo trace) and east-west (later known as the Camino Real de los Tejas) aboriginal
trailsâachieved pre-eminence at the expense of the long-lasting polity on the Neches River.
The George C. Davis site was abandoned by the early 14th century (Story 2000).
The Formative, Early, and Middle Caddo period groups possessed a rich material culture.
Well-made, corner-notched and rectangular-stemmed arrow points were common, as were
contracting stem Perdiz points (see Rogers and Perttula 2004; Shafer 2008). Other tools
included siltstone and greenstone celts, perforators and borers, large Gahagan bifaces
and other large chipped stone bifacial tools, and a variety of more expedient stone tools
(unifacial flake scraping and cutting implements). Ground stone manos, pitted stones,
abraders, metates, and grinding slabs were used for a variety of processing tasks on these
Caddo sites.
With respect to the archeological material culture remains present on Caddo sites of these
ages, the most distinctive of these Caddo groups were the ceramics they made for cooking,
storage, and serving needs (see Perttula et al. 1995). Petrographic analyses of the pastes
of Caddo ceramics from the Sabine River, Cypress Creek, and Sulphur River drainage
basins suggests that most of the ceramics were made locally, but there is evidence from
the paste inclusions that ceramics may have been traded between Caddo groups in the
Sabine and Sulphur river basins (Reese-Taylor 1995:23, 25). These vessels were made in
a variety of forms, including: carinated bowls, simple bowls, compound bowls, bowls with
collared rims and rim tabs, bottles with tall and tapered necks, and jars with short to tall
necks or rims and cylindrical to spherical bodies; Turner (1997) notes the lack of large
cooking vessels or jars in four Middle Caddo period sites in the Dry Creek and Greasy Creek

areas of Camp and Upshur counties. Many of the utility vessels were plain, but those that
were decorated usually were decorated with incising, punctuation, fingernail impressions,
neck banding, and applique; brushing of vessel bodies (mainly Pease Brushed-Incised)
is a form of surface treatment that is notable after ca. AD 1300 in the middle and lower
portions of the Cypress Creek basin (Nelson and Turner 1997) and the lower Sulphur River
basin (Cliff 1997). Effigy vessels are present in Middle Caddo period sites in the western
portions of the Cypress Creek basin.
The Caddo made ceramics in a wide variety of vessel shapes with an abundance of wellcrafted and executed body and rim designs and surface treatments. There is an impressive
diversity of vessel forms among the Caddo fine wares. This includes carinated bowls,
deep compound bowls, double and triple vessels (joined bowls and bottles [Suhm and
Jelks 1962:Plates 38k, 51e, 59d]; Perttula et al. 2010), bottles, ollas, zoomorphic and
anthropomorphic effigy bowls and bottles, ladles, platters, peaked jars, gourd and boxshaped bowls, and chalices. From the archeological contexts in which Caddo ceramics
have been found, as well as inferences about their manufacture and use, it is evident
that ceramics were important to the prehistoric Caddo in several ways. They were used
for cooking and serving of foods and beverages, in the storage of foodstuffs, as personal
possessions, as beautiful works of art and craftsmanship (i.e. some vessels were clearly
made to never be used in domestic contexts), and as social identifiers; that is, certain
shared and distinctive stylistic motifs and decorative patterns marked closely related
communities and constituent groups.
The Caddo manufactured both fine wares (with very finely crushed temper), bottles and
many bowls, and utility wares (some of the simple bowls, as well as the jars that were
made in a variety of sizes). Almost without exception, Caddo ceramics were tempered with
grog (crushed sherds) or bone, although burned and crushed shells were used as temper
after ca. AD 1300 among most of the Red River Caddo groups (Perttula et al. 2012). In
some cases, the use of bone temper was substantial in Middle Caddo contexts (i.e. Nelson
et al. 1996; Parsons 2011; Perttula and Ellis 2012; Sherman et al. 2011). After adding
the temper to the clay, the kneaded clay was formed into clay coils that were added to flat
disk bases to form the vessel, and the coils were apparently smoothed with a round river
pebble to create the finished vessel form. Decorations and slips were added before, as
well as after, baking in an open fire, and commonly the vessels were then burnished and
polished; red ochre and white kaolinite clay pigments were often added to or painted on
to the decorations on bottles and carinated bowls. These kinds of ceramics were designed
to serve different purposes within Caddo communities and family groupsâfrom that of
a cooking pot to the mortuary function of a ceremonial beakerâand this is reflected in
differences in paste, surface treatment, firing methods, decoration, and vessel form
between the two wares.
The use of a red hematite slip on interior and/or exterior surfaces of carinated bowls
and bottles (plain and engraved vessels) occurs with some regularity in Early and Middle
Caddo ceramic assemblages, especially in the upper portions of the Big Cypress Creek

basin (Nelson and Turner 1997; see also Driggers 1985), and in the case of Maxey
Noded Redware, the squat, long-necked bottles also have appliqued and/or punctated
designs below the neck of the bottle (cf. Krieger 1946). Engraved curvilinear, scroll, ladder,
pendant triangles (solid and cross-hatched) and horizontal and/or diagonal motifs were
commonly employed on the carinated bowls and bottles. This includes such defined
types as Hickory Engraved, Holly Fine Engraved, Spiro Engraved, Sanders Engraved, and
Haley Engraved (Suhm and Jelks 1962; Turner 1995). A distinctive engraved motif that
appears to characterize Middle Caddo period fine wares in the Big Cypress Creek basin
is an engraved rattlesnake on bottles and beakers (Turner 1997; Nelson and Turner
1997; Walters 2006). Engraved vessels (or sherds with engraved rattlesnake motifs, see
Driggers 1985) with the rattlesnake motif are known from several Middle Caddo period
sites in the Big Cypress Creek basin (Nelson and Turner 1997:Figure 1; Walters 2006).
Incised and incised-punctated decorated ceramicsâincluding Crockett Curvilinear Incised
and Crockett and Pennington Punctated-Incised âhybridsââdominate the Formative and
Early Caddo ceramic assemblages at Caddo sites in the upper Sulphur River basin (Fields
et al. 1997:81 and Figure 29), while the Middle Caddo period component at Hurricane
Hill (calibrated radiocarbon dates ranging from AD 1250â1375) has red-slipped plain
and Maxey Noded Redware in small amounts, Sanders Engraved, sherds with engraved
pendant triangles and ladders, cross-hatched and diagonal incised and incised-punctated
sherds, and Haley variety long-stemmed Red River pipes.
Other types of ceramic artifacts manufactured by prehistoric Formative to Middle Caddo
groups include ceramic ear spools and disks, figurines, and a variety of pipe forms (Jackson
1933:71). The earliest types of Caddo clay pipes were plain, tubular and cigar-shaped
forms, followed by the long-stem âRed Riverâ pipes (Hoffman 1967) with burnished and
polished stems and bowls; rectangular or L-shaped platform pipes and some elbow pipe
forms have also been recovered in several Caddo sites dating to the latter part of the
Middle Caddo period (see Bruseth and Perttula 1981; Rogers and Perttula 2004:Figure
120; Perttula 2011).

Late Caddo Period
The Late Caddo Titus phase (ca. AD 1430â1680) represents the archeological remains
of a number of affiliated Late Caddo period groups who lived between the Sabine and
Sulphur rivers in the Northeast Texas Piney Woods (Figure 2-5). These Caddo peoples lived
in dispersed year-round settlements where they farmed and hunted, buried their dead
in planned cemeteries, and manufactured culturally distinctive ceramics of considerable
stylistic and functional diversity. Their dispersed communities were comprised primarily of
individual to multiple farmstead compounds, and they were active traders. These Caddo
groups were amongst the most populous and socially complex of the many Caddo societies
living at that time in the Caddo archeological area (e.g., Early 2004:573), and they were
also the westernmost aboriginal group in Texas that was in any sense socio-politically
akin to middle and late Mississippian polities living in the southeastern United States
and the Midwest (Milner et al. 2001; Butler and Welch 2008). The Caddo communities

living in the main part of the Big Cypress Creek basin in the Piney Woods experienced
rapid and sustained population growth from the 15th to the 17th century during times
of fluctuating climatic conditions. These dynamic farming communities dealt with local
climatic and subsistence stresses by effecting new means of holding their societies
together, successfully and boldly forming several stronger communities within a larger
regional political system than had existed before in the region that were centered around
the establishment of a series of small mound centers, community cemeteries, and villages
at key landscape nexuses in the Big Cypress Creek basin.
Several hundred Titus phase components have been identified in the Piney Woods of
Northeast Texas. The largest concentration of Titus phase components is found in the Big
Cypress Creek valley (Thurmond 1990a:Figure 35; Perttula 2004, 2012), with a seemingly
lower number of sites throughout the Little Cypress Creek valley, the middle portions of
the Sulphur River, the middle and upper portions of the White Oak Creek drainage, and

the upper and middle reaches of the Sabine River drainage; in this latter area, the Titus
phase community is centered around the Pine Tree Mound political and community center
on Potterâs Creek, near its confluence with the Sabine River (Fields and Gadus 2012). In
the Monticello B-2 area mine, along the interfluve between the Cypress Creek and Sulphur
River drainages, several important Titus phase settlements and the Mockingbird site
(41TT550) cemetery have been identified over the years (Kotter et al. 1991, 1993; Nash
et al. 1995; Dixon et al. 1995; Galan 1998; Perttula et al. 1998).
The locations that these Caddo peoples chose to permanently settle and build structures
and other facilities (i.e. granaries) at had to be situated in habitats where suitable sandy
soils were nearby that could be worked with simple wood and bone digging tools, and that
the land they built and maintained their homesteads and communities on had to be welldrained and elevated above the annual floods along Big Cypress Creek and its tributaries.
They also had to be in areas where wood and grass was plentiful for house construction
and refurbishing, as well as near fresh drinking water. The fact that the vast majority of the
Titus phase settlements are not usually found in any notable spatial clusters or aggregated
farmstead compounds (as is seen on the Red River at this time, cf. Perttula et al. 2008)
suggests that the many resources that were needed by the sedentary Caddo populations
to successfully live and sustain themselves in the Big Cypress Creek valley could best be
exploited by dispersing the groups in a variety of settings.
This dispersed settlement arrangement would have helped lessen the competition
for available plant, animal, and mineral resources, and would not have allowed for the
environmental degradation of suitable habitats by a single large community. This would
have been of critical concern in droughty periods for Caddo peoples living along the
margins of the Piney Woods, in environmentally risky areas. It would also have permitted
the Caddo peoples to take advantage of the diversity in habitats to exploit a number of
them from season to season and year to year, thus insuring that the overall community
of interacting farmsteads and individuals living in those farmsteads could survive if there
were economic difficulties or failures (i.e. local droughts, flooding, fires) in some habitats
but not in most of the others.
In Late Caddo Titus phase times, when the Caddo peoples had a diet that primarily (i.e.
possibly as much as 50 percent of the diet) consisted of cultivated plants like maize, beans,
and squash (see Wilson 2012; Perttula 2008), agricultural pursuits must have been of
particular importance in determining the location of individual farmsteads and hamlets,
more so than they were in the Early or Middle Caddo periods (ca. AD 1000â1400) when
Caddo peoples were not apparently quite so dependent upon cultivated plants for their diet
(or at least that was the case until ca. AD 1300/1350, see discussions in Perttula [1996,
2008] and Dering [2004]). How are these constraints reflected in the spatial distribution of
Late Caddo Titus phase sites? What is seen in this part of the Big Cypress Creek is that the
overall settlement pattern was dispersed, and this dispersion occurred in conjunction with
a heightened emphasis on situating sites along the secondary streams and the spring-fed
branches. These areas may have had more dependable water, or more accessible water,
34

at least at that time, and it is also likely that fields would have been easier to clear along
the more open upland forests than if fields had to be located in the more mesic and thickly
wooded valleys.
There are more Late Caddo Titus phase sites in this part of the Big Cypress Creek basin
than sites found during earlier periods of Caddo occupation. This suggests that the regional
population was quite a bit higher during the Late Caddo period (all things being equal,
especially the length of time each different community may have been occupied), and there
are several clusters of settlements that apparently represent parts of contemporaneous
small communities based on archeological evidenceâprimarily ceramic vessels from
burial features and sherd assemblages. A political community as used here is a cluster
of interrelated settlements and associated cemeteries that are centered on a key site or
group of sites distinguished by public architecture (i.e. earthen mounds) and large domestic
village areas (Figure 2-6). The key sites within these Titus phase political communities on
Big Cypress Creek include places such as Lower Peach Orchard (41CP17) on Big Cypress
Creek in the vicinity of the Sandlin Dam community cemetery; Pilgrimâs Pride (41CP304)
on Walkers Creek; Tom Hanks (41CP239), Harold Williams (41CP10) and Tuck Carpenter
(41CP5) on Dry Creek (Turner 1978, 1992); Sam Roberts (41CP8), P. S. Cash (41CP2),
and the Shelby (41CP71) sites on Greasy and Prairie creeks; Harroun (41UR10), Dalton
(41UR11), Chastain (41UR18), and Camp Joy Mound (41UR144) on Big Cypress Creek and
Meddlin Creek; and the Whelan (41MR2), H. R. Taylor (41HS3), and Pea Patch (41HS825)
sites on Big Cypress Creek and Arms Creek (see also Perttula 2004:Figures 13.30â13.31).
In the upper part of the Big Cypress Creek basin, there are several clusters of Titus phase
settlements within suggested political communities. The Lower Peach Orchard site (41CP17)
is probably one of the most important one in the mid-reaches of the valley since it had a
number of deep shaft tombs as well as extensive settlement deposits (Thurmond 1990a;
Perttula 1998, 2004), and appears to be a village nexus comparable to that documented
around the Pilgrimâs Pride site, about 10 miles downstream. Other concentrations of Titus
phase sites in this area are noted along Brushy Creek upstream from its confluence with
Big Cypress Creek, and in upland/valley margin settings (Perttula and Nelson 2003c).
There are other important villages in different Titus phase political communities in the
Titus phase heartland, and they appear to be situated in similar topographic settings,
namely along tributary streams near their confluence with Big Cypress Creek. They are
marked by a higher density of permanent settlements around one premier community.
In the case of the Shelby site on Greasy Creek, the social and political center of the community
stretches for several hundred meters along Greasy Creek and a small tributary, with an
earthen mound at the northern end of the village and a large cemetery at its southern
end. Domestic village areas are between the mound and the cemetery and cover at least
10â15 acres (Perttula et al. 2004). The Titus phase earthen mound covered a burned
structure at the base of the mound, and a second structure had been built that stood on
the mound itself, and was then burned and capped with a final sandy fill. The arrangement

of mound, domestic areas, and planned cemetery here is essentially duplicated at the
Pilgrimâs Pride site (Perttula 2005:Figure 11-2), although the village areas and the size of
the cemetery at the Shelby site are considerably larger. Based on work at the site in 2002,
the north levee area at the Shelby site has thick midden deposits and evidence for several
burned structures, implying the existence of an intensive occupation here during the life
of the community.
Another important community nexus in the Titus phase heartland includes the Tuck
Carpenter and Harold Williams community cemeteries (see Turner 1978, 1992; Turner
and Smith 2003) and various domestic settlements (marked by midden deposits and
habitation debris) on the lower part of Dry Creek and Swauano Creek. No Titus mounds
have been found in this area yet, although the Tom Hanks mound site (41CP239) is
located in the upper part of the Dry Creek basin, and may be part of this particular political
community. This area is on the first important set of eastward-flowing tributaries to Big
Cypress Creek that are downstream from Walkers Creek. The next downstream Titus phase
village community may be centered at the afore-mentioned Greasy Creek community at
the Shelby site; there are numerous Titus phase settlements and large cemeteries on
Greasy Creek and its tributaries. Also probably part of this particular Caddo community are
the Titus phase mound sites (single mounds) on Prairie Creekâonly a few miles away from
the Shelby siteâat the P. S. Cash and Sam Roberts sites.
The next community nexus is in the Meddlin Creek and Big Cypress Creek areas, midway
between Greasy Creek and Arms Creek. It includes three or four mound sites, namely Harroun
(41UR10), Dalton (41UR11), Chastain (41UR18), and Camp Joy (41UR144), various small
domestic settlements in valley and upland settings, along with several large community
cemeteries. As evidence of the integration of these mound centers, there are extended
entranceway structures at the Harroun site that point towards each other (in the case of
Mounds B and D), and another (on Mound C) is oriented to face an extended entranceway
structure at the nearby Dalton site (Thurmond 1990a:Figure 27). In turn, the extended
entranceway structure at the Dalton site points southwest towards a mound platform (with
burned structures and burials) at the nearby Camp Joy Mound site (41UR144, Perttula
and Nelson 2001). Here, the community cemeteries are not found in close association
with the mound centers, as they are in the Greasy Creek Caddo community, but instead
they are situated along Big Cypress Creek and its tributary streams, presumably in general
proximity to the many farmsteads that must have been dispersed across the countryside.
The last recognizable Titus phase political community in the Big Cypress Creek heartland
is along Arms Creek and Big Cypress Creek, and includes the community nexus at the
Whelan (41MR2) mound site. The Whelan site is on the floodplain of Big Cypress Creek,
and there are farmstead settlements along the creek as well as on Arms Creek. The larger
community cemeteries at the H. R. Taylor (41HS3) and Pea Patch (41HS825) are situated
a few miles from the Whelan site, near the headwaters of Arms Creek.

Other than the village centers, how were other Titus phase domestic settlements organized
and laid out spatially? Fortunately, excavations at two Titus phase settlementsâthe
Earspool and Rookery Ridge sites (see Galan 1998; Parsons 1998; Perttula and Sherman
2008)âhave provided solid archeological evidence of their character. The settlements
appear to have been composed of one to several family units with house midden/daub
concentrations and trash midden deposits; many activities occurred outside the house
areas, resulting in trash-filled pits, hearths, and posts in these areas. At the Earspool
site (41TT653) there were four different circular structures (probably thatched and daubcovered), one with an extended entranceway that pointed towards the other three houses,
that may have been from two temporally different and sequential Titus phase occupations
(see Perttula and Sherman 2009:Figure 6-1). There was a broad, open area between the
houses that may have been a small plaza, as there are marker poles at its center, and
there were clusters of pits along its margins. Three burials were present at the site, one
child burial inside Structure 2 and adults in two widely separated areas; there apparently
was no large family cemetery (i.e. 10â20 burials) at the Earspool site.
The Rookery Ridge site (41UR133) excavations exposed two circular structures and
extensive midden deposits. The middens were about 15 m south of the one structure
with an extended entranceway; the entranceway faced to the north, suggesting that other
habitation features besides those excavated by Parsons (1998, 2011) were present on
the northern part of the alluvial landform along Kelsey Creek. Child and adult burials were
present either inside a structure or immediately outside, along the structure walls, but
again, there was no larger family cemetery at the site.
At the Pine Tree Mound site, domestic areas were comprised of clusters of structures,
many apparently rebuilt one or more times. Outside the structures were outdoor activity
areas marked by pits, post holes, and broken ceramic and lithic artifacts, as well as nearby
family cemeteries (Fields and Gadus 2012).
Perttula and Nelson (2003c:34) have noted that Late Caddo Titus phase sites are more
common south of Big Cypress Creek than they are on the north side of the basin, or in
other stream valleys (such as Little Cypress Creek, White Oak Creek, or streams in the
Lake Fork Creek basin) in the Big Cypress, Sulphur River, and Sabine River basins. Poorly
drained and steeper, rockier landforms on the east side of Big Cypress Creek were also
apparently not heavily settled by these Caddo peoples. Regional settlement data for the
Titus phase does suggest that this pattern in the spatial distribution of sites may be part
of a much broader trend in the overall density of Late Caddo sites between the Titus phase
âheartlandâ and outlying areas also occupied by Titus phase Caddo peoples (see Perttula
1998, 2004; Nelson and Perttula 2003a). That trend indicates that Titus phase sitesâas
well as Titus phase sites with mounds and large community cemeteriesâare more common
across the landscape from the Brushy Creek to Lake Bob Sandlin dam area downstream
along Big Cypress Creek than they are in the Post Oak Savannah immediately north and
northwest of Big Cypress Creek.

38

This distribution of settlements, mounds, and community cemeteries strongly suggests
that the density of Caddo peoples during the Titus phase was more concentrated in the
Big Cypress Creek heartland, including its many southward-flowing and eastward-flowing
tributaries, than it was elsewhere across the landscape. Nevertheless, other parts of the
Titus phase Caddo homeland were also well settled: two such areas are the Dry Creek
and Caney Creek valleys in the upper Lake Fork Creek valley in the Post Oak Savanna
(see also Bruseth 1987; Bruseth and Perttula 1981; Perttula et al. 1993). Here, at sites
like Burks (41WD52), Steck (41WD529), Spoonbill (41WD109), or Goldsmith (41WD208),
the farmstead occupations have house and trash midden deposits, apparently from two
to four structures and nearby family cemeteries with roughly 5â15 individual interments
(Perttula 2004:Figure 13.28).
The density of Titus phase settlements along Caney Creek is impressive, with more than
50 components on a ca. 7 km stretch of the creek and the adjacent upland landforms.
The majority of the sites are in the uplands, rather than in the Caney Creek valley, situated
along the upland edge or on smaller tributaries of Caney Creek (Perttula 2005, ed.:Figure
11-6).
Habitation sites are well dispersed across the landscape, as are the habitation sites with
reported cemeteries. The village-mound-large cemetery association noted for Titus phase
heartland community centers, however, seem to be absent in the Caney Creek cluster,
and other non-heartland settings, although overall population densities from one locale to
another may have been comparable.

Studies in the Lake Fork Creek basin (Bruseth and Perttula 1981; Bruseth 1987; Perttula
et al. 1993a), and investigations in portions of the Big Sandy Creek (Perttula et al. 1986)
and Little Cypress Creek basins (Parsons 2011; Horizon Environmental Services, Inc.
1993, 1995; Glander et al. 1993; Sherman et al. 2004a), as well as at Caddo Lake in the
Big Cypress Creek Watershed (Cliff and Peter 1994:141), are similar to Thurmondâs overall
results for the Cypress Creek Basin in confirming the high frequency of Late Caddo period
occupations. Clearly, regional Caddo populations were extensive throughout much of the
Piney Woods after ca. AD 1350. Nevertheless, certain areas within Northeast Texas, such
as the upper portions of the Sulphur River basin (cf. Fields et al. 1994; Cliff et al. 1996b),
were not apparently regularly occupied on a permanent basis by Late Caddoan groups,
and Fields et al. (1997:115) suggest that after ca. AD 1400, the upper Sulphur River basin
area was the scene of ânon-intensive, presumably limited-purpose use.â
In a general summary of mound-building in prehistoric times by Caddo peoples, Barnes
and Perttula (1999:6) noted that construction of ceremonial mound centers by the
Caddo began about AD 800, and over the next 900 years âthese mound centers became
increasingly larger and more complex, under the apparent direction of a Caddoan [sic]
chiefdom elite.â During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, population losses due to
the introduction of European epidemic diseases may have led to the gradual cessation of
ceremonial constructions, and by ca. AD 1700, the vast majority of the Caddo ceremonial
mound centers were either abandoned, or at least mounds were no longer being built and
used by the Caddo peoples.
Caddo mounds were apparently erected usually near or at the center of the larger villages
or political communities, and on the larger rivers (such as the Red River) the mounds were
integral parts of what Perttula (1992) called Caddo âtowns.â As Early (2000:126) notes,
the mounds and the community centers they were found on were the focus of mortuary
and ritual activities for Caddo peoples. The mounds became permanent markers on
the cultural landscape, because they were associated with specific rituals, events, and
peoples, and they made âa powerful social and political statement. They serve equally well
to reinforce the positions of important people and social groups, to mark territories, [and]
to underscore common group identityâ (Milner 2004:305).
How the mounds were constructed and used in Late Caddo times among Caddo
communities on smaller streams and tributaries to the larger rivers, such as Big Cypress
Creek, particularly among the Titus phase Caddo, is not as well known because it was once
thought that mound-building in the Piney Woods and Post Oak Savanna of northeastern
Texas had ceased between roughly AD 1400 and AD 1500/1550 (Thurmond 1990;
Perttula 1989, 1993, 1994, 1995). With continued archeological research, and the
expanding dating of mound features and archeological deposits, there are currently 11
known Titus phase mounds in the Big Cypress Creek basin and the heartland of the Titus
phase (Perttula 2004:Figure 13-30). The Pine Tree Mound site (41HS15) on Potters Creek
in the Sabine River basin (see Figure 13-2) appears to be another Titus phase ceremonial

center and village with at least three mounds, a plaza, five associated habitation areas,
shaft tombs, and at least one cemetery (Fields 2008; Fields and Gadus 2012).
The radiocarbon dates from the Harroun, Dalton, Sam Roberts, Shelby, Pilgrimâs Pride, and
Camp Joy mounds cover a broader span of time, however, than AD 1400â1500/1550, but
fall into two clusters, one (at 1-sigma) ranging from cal. AD 1385â1520, and the other
between cal AD 1444â1668 (see Perttula 1997, 1998; Perttula and Selden 2011). It is
suspected that most of the mound-building activities represented in the various mound
sites took place during most, if not all, of the Titus phase.
In general, the calibrated radiocarbon ages from these Titus phase mounds indicate they
are broadly contemporaneous with the construction of the other known mounds. At the
Harroun site, for instance, House 4 (Mound D), the most probable calibrated age ranges
of this burned house (Jelks and Tunnell 1959:Figure 10) are cal AD 1386â1515 and AD
1479â1641. The uppermost burned structure at the Shelby Mound has a calibrated age
range of AD 1465â1631, approximately the same age range as the burned structure in
the mound at the Pilgrimâs Pride site. The calibrated age ranges from the Dalton and Sam
Roberts sites are comparable to the others.
Only one date (Tx-240) from Mound C at Harroun, on woody charcoal from mound fill
(Thurmond 1990a:Table 59), suggests that the mound was built prior to the initiation of
the Titus phase. It may be significant that Mound C is the only one of the four mounds at
Harroun that has evidence of two sequent structures, suggesting a lengthier period of
use than the other mounds, and a period of construction and use that perhaps began in
the late fourteenth-early fifteenth century. However, the other assay from Mound C has a
calibrated range of AD 1444â1668, solidly in the Titus phase.
The small number of Titus phase mound sites known in the region are unlike the types of
mound complexes typically constructed in the major river valleys at this time (Story 1990).
Mounds built by the Caddo that lived in the Piney Woods were sub-structural mounds; no
pyramidal platform or burial mounds are known for this time period. Sub-structural mounds
are restricted to mounds that cap a burned circular structure that was constructed on the
ground surface or in a small, shallow pit. In at least two instances, the mounds contained
sequent structures, but the âstructures originated at higher levels in the mound[s] due to
occupational accumulations of soil and ash, and not the result of any deliberate cappingâ
(Thurmond 1990a:168). At the Camp Joy Mound, the 2.3 meter high mound apparently
had two tiers (Turner 1993), the latest tier capping a burned structure (marked by a 7 cm
thick charcoal lens) dated to cal AD 1495â1605 (see Perttula and Nelson 2001).
The structures that were capped by the mound, or built at higher levels in the mound itself
(as at Harroun), were circular, with extended entranceways facing west, and with central
hearths. They were partially dismantled and burned, then capped with sediments. Again at
the Harroun site, the structures were built inside large circular pits, and there were obvious
soil berms around the enclosing pit and the structure. A standing structure with berms

around would look like the structure was literally buried (or partially buried) in the mound
itself (cf. Schambach 1996). At the Dalton site, two temporally sequent circular structures
(with clay-lined floors) of slightly different sizes were both built and used within the same
shallow pit; when the second one was burned and destroyed, it and the surrounding pit
were buried by a sandy mound fill to a depth of 80 cm (Davis and Gipson 1960:17â19;
Thurmond 1990a:210). At the Whelan site, one of the mounds had four temporally sequent
structures that ranged from 5.2â6.4 m in diameter (Thurmond 1990a:168).
Exactly what triggered the dismantling and burning of the structures, or their capping with
mound sediments, at the Titus phase community centers is not clear. However, given the
generally close association between the mound places and the community cemeteries
(many of which held the burials of members of the social elite, including lineage heads),
it seems plausible that the house destruction and mound building episodes occurred
after the death and burial of a leader or a member of the social elite. However, these
elite individuals were buried with their peers and kin-affiliated relations in the community
cemetery, not in the mound itself, and thus in essence the mound-building rituals of the
Titus phase Caddo consisted of âpublic building-oriented ceremonialismâ (Schambach
1996:41), such that the mounds âcontain the remains of important buildings rather than
important people.â
Thurmond (1990a:234â235) suggests that the locations of Late Caddo period mounds in
the Big Cypress Creek basin appear to be associated with clusters of contemporaneous
settlements, cemeteries, and limited use areas, âand it is therefore possible that these
concentrations of components represent the archeological manifestation of...Cypress
cluster constituent groups during the [preceding] Whelan phase.â A similar association
has been noted for Late Caddo period mounds and settlements in the middle Sabine
river basin (Perttula 1989, 1994; Rogers and Perttula 2004). As was discussed above
with respect to the identification of different political communities within the Titus phase,
Thurmondâs (1990a) suggestion is a good one, with the exception that the mound-building
in the Big Cypress Creek basin primarilyâif not exclusivelyâtook place in Titus phase times
rather than in the Whelan phase (ca. AD 1350â1450).
With respect to the different political communities or constituent groups that may have
existed among the Caddo after ca. AD 1430 in the Big Cypress basin (see Figure 2-4),
there are several key differences in the mound sites in the âheartlandâ of the Titus phase
that hint at the socio-political diversity that was present in the various communities that
existed at the time. The first obvious difference is in the number of mounds on a site: the
Harroun and Whelan sites each have four mounds, while the other sites have only one.
We should note, however, that the proximity of the Chastain, Dalton, and Camp Joy Mound
sites to each other on a prominent upland landform (the three mound sites are each within
250â500 m of each other) overlooking Meddlin Creek and Big Cypress Creek probably is
evidence of a single large Titus phase mound and community center, not three disparate
and unrelated sites.

42

It is especially notable that the only multiple mound centers known in the Titus phase are
all situated in the lower reaches of Big Cypress Creek, in the Lake Oâ the Pines area (see
Figure 2â4), while the other single mound sites are found some distance upstream in
different political communities. These differences in the complexity of the various mound
sites are likely to be a reflection of differences in the power and authority that each political
community had within the Titus phase heartland, as the construction of earthen mounds
express that power and authority in visible and tangible ways (cf. Payne 2002:195). It may
well also be the case that the Lake Oâ the Pines area, with its most important centers,
was also home to the highest densities of Titus phase Caddo peoples, as the size of each
political communityâs population would also be evidence of their chiefly power.
Another difference between the mound centers, as alluded to in earlier discussions
of political communities, is whether or not the mound center was a discrete part of a
larger planned village. In the case of the Pilgrimâs Pride and Shelby mound sites, the one
earthen mound at each site was situated at the northern end of a large (+10 acres) village
community.
At the P. S. Cash site, the one mound was 400 m north of a small associated cemetery,
and no obvious habitation areas were noted by Jackson (1931), but there are extensive
Titus phase habitation deposits immediately across Greasy Creek at the E. S. Dooley Farm
(41CP4) (see Thurmond 1990a:139 and Figure 17). The Sam Roberts site had a single
1.1 m tall mound that capped a burned circular structure (Tunnell 1959:4â7). There was a
ca. 200 m2 midden deposit on the northeastern side of the mound, but there were much
more extensive habitation areas 200 m east of the mound itself. According to Thurmond
(1990:144), these habitation areas had âdark brown greasy soilâ¦[and large dark outlines
associated with concentrations of wattle-impressed daub [that] may mark the locations of
structures.â The two habitation areas were each 70â100 m in diameter.
In the immediate area of the Dalton, Chastain, and Camp Joy mound sites, there are
extensive Titus phase habitation areas. These occur either on the mound sites themselves
(as with the Chastain site, with a 15,000 m2 habitation area, see Thurmond 1990:212),
or in nearby and associated domestic settlements. These include Sam Gray #1 (41UR9),
Jake Martin (41UR12, Titus phase burials had been looted from the site in recent years),
Watkins (41UR13), Sam Gray #2 (41UR14), Cunliffe (41UR15), and Mosquito Hollow
(41UR16) sites (Thurmond 1990:Figure 27; Burson and Cliff 2000).
The single mound at the Tiddle Lake mound site has no obvious associated habitation
deposits, although there are numerous Titus phase settlements on nearby upland
landforms (Perttula 2005:Table 11-1). The only habitation area at the Whelan site was
a ca. 2000 m2 archeological deposit southeast of Mound A and near Big Cypress Creek
(Thurmond 1990a:16). The other three mounds lay to the east and northwest. The small
habitation area contained one 7.9 m household structure and an elevated 3.1 m granary
structure. No habitation deposits were identified at the Harroun site, but rather only four

Chapter 2

small mounds spread out along Big Cypress Creek (Jelks and Tunnell 1959; Thurmond
1990a:Figure 27).
This dichotomy between mound and habitation associations on Titus phase mounds,
with the main multi-mound centers at the Harroun and Whelan sites having little if no
associated habitation debris, while most of the other mounds did, leads to the suspicion
that there were fundamental and measurable differences in the complexity (if not wealth
and prestige) of the different political communities in the heartland. For most of the
communities, the ritual, power, and authority of the elite leaders had not been divorced
from the populations living in the communities, especially those living in and near the
largest villages. This intimate relationshipâas seen by the placement of mounds across
the landscapeâbetween the community and its leaders was not duplicated in Titus phase
Caddo communities living along the lower Big Cypress Creek basin and near the eastern
margins of the settlement distribution of the Titus phase (see Figures 2-3 and 2-4). Here,
the community mound centers were basically kept separate from domestic affairs and
were focused more exclusively on ritual activities and the control of ritual knowledge.
Those leaders that lived at the Harroun and Whelan sites may have gained their prestige
and authority through their control of ritual affairs (cf. Potter 2000:301).
Although the Whelan site had only a small habitation area, a very large assemblage of
pottery sherds (more than 14,000 in all) were recovered in the excavations, including a
dense midden with thousands of sherds and numerous animal bone fragments inside
the one non-mound structure (Davis 1958:42â48, 65â66; Thurmond 1990:168). This
particular structure (Structure 2) was just southeast of Mound A, and next to a probable
granary perhaps under elite control. Thurmond (1990a:168) suggests that the midden
âderives from use of the structure for trash disposal after its abandonment (but while it
was yet standing), as the deposit was entirely within its perimeter.â These archeological
deposits have the markings of public feasting activities (see Hayden 2001:Table 2.1), and
ritual feasting events have been noted at Early and Middle Caddo period mounds in East
Texas and southwestern Arkansas (Perttula 2004:386; Scott and Jackson 1998). A series
of repetitive rituals centered on communal feasting took place here (with the end result
being a large midden refuse deposit filled with broken ceramic vessels and animal bones),
and probably also in the series of four structures eventually buried in nearby Mound A.
Such feasting activities would certainly have served to help establish and preserve Titus
phase inter-community alliances and integration, at least at this political community.
Furthermore, the Caddo community that was hosting the public feasting activities could
well have âgained a measure of prestige that could be translated as a source of political
influence for individual village headmenâ (Knight 2001:327). Visualized in this matter, it
would seem to be no coincidence that the scene of repeated public feasting activities by
the Titus phase Caddo would be situated in the largest community mound centers.
There are a minimum of 133 known Titus phase cemeteries in northeastern Texas. These
cemeteries range in size from less than five individuals to as many as 200 burials, as far
as can be determined from the available evidence, and they occur in a variety of settings
44

within the Titus phase area, with a considerable diversity in burial treatment and mortuary
offerings (see Perttula and Nelson 1998:328â401; Rogers et al. 2003:19â22). The
majority of the known Titus phase burials are from large community cemeteries; these all
had more than 70 interments (Perttula 2012:Table 13-3).
Cemeteries represent distinctive and socially significant places on the prehistoric Caddo
landscape. They are places where past Caddo societies created and renewed a sense of
place and developed a sense of social memory (e.g., Goldstein 2006:380), leading to an
appreciation of the social and spatial dimensions of mortuary practices. Ashmore and Geller
(2005:87â88) have noted that burial places are appropriate places for transforming the
dead kin people through life and death cycles and commemorating ancestral continuities
through ritual action. Burials, and cemeteries, whether small family cemeteries or the
larger community cemeteries, reflect a continuity of kin and community in their location
relative to the inhabited and habitable landscape and in their location relative to other
deceased Caddo peoples. Chesson (2001:110) has noted that:
On a regional scale, the people who buried their deadâ¦followed a particular set of
standards in their mortuary rites, forging a sense of similarity between people in
[the] region, as well as nurturing a sense of tradition in the treatment of [the] dead.
These communities shared a set of principles and local knowledge that instructed
them how to treat their dead, where to commemorate them, and the importance
of maintaining these practices. This knowledge, and the resulting practices, may
reflect a regional identity. [emphasis added]
From this perspective, mortuary practices of the prehistoric Titus phase Caddo peoples
are believed to be guided by the cultural and social ideas and traditions of the living Caddo
people concerning the afterlife as well as the relationship of the living with their ancestors.
These ideas and relationshipsâessentially social ties expressed in shared mortuary ritualsâ
can endure for generations. Shared ritual mortuary practices among the prehistoric Caddo
living in the Big Cypress Creek basin in the Piney Woods lasted as least 250â300 years
(10â15 generations). Because these mortuary practices are based on the active beliefs
of the living Caddo who laid the deceased in graves in certain sacred areas, with specific
burial pit forms and orientations, as well as certain kinds and quantities of grave furniture,
mortuary practices provide key insights into Caddo cosmology and ideology, particularly
beliefs on the afterlife, the nature of the soul, and steps necessary to protect and save the
souls of the deceased.
The setting of cemeteries across the Big Cypress Creek basin region is not haphazard, but
has a spatial and historical context that can be related to traditions and beliefs shared
by Caddo peoples about universal orders and the structure of the cosmos (e.g., Carr
1995:Table XIV; Charles 2005:23â24; Kay and Sabo 2006). The demographic dispersion
of agricultural Caddo peoples, and the apparent belief that the dead needed to be kept
near to the living, led to the accompanying dispersion of cemetery sites in proximity to
habitation areas and settlements. These Caddo households, or groups of households
comprising a community of kin-related groups, defined their own sense of place and who
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

45

Chapter 2

they were by the unique juxtaposition of the living and the dead in circumscribed areas
within larger farming communities. An emphasis on affinity and kinship within and between
different households that created these sacred cemetery places was more important to
household members than were their broader ties to the larger communities of which they
were a part. Although these Caddo shared similar views on social memory and the place
of the dead in their lives, it was their households and associated cemeteries (i.e. their
ritual space) that were the center of their universe, not the larger and socially more diverse
communities that they shared cultural traditions with.
Titus phase cemeteries are particularly common in sites located along Big Cypress Creek
itself, followed by other cemeteries on a series of tributaries to Big Cypress Creek. The
principal tributary creek settings for Titus phase cemeteries are Swauano Creek, Boggy
Creek, Dry Creek, Arms Creek, Meddlin Creek, and Greasy Creek (see Figure 2-4). With the
exception of the Boggy Creek cemeteries, the Titus phase communities living on the other
tributaries appear to represent recognizable concentrations of settlements, mounds, and
community cemeteries that constitute distinct political communities.
The average Titus phase cemetery contained about 26 individuals, arranged in a number
of rows, with little if any overlapping of graves (Perttula and Nelson 1998:375). Titus phase
burials were interred in an extended supine position with the head of the deceased facing
west, and usually accompanied by a variety of grave goods, including ceramic vessels
to hold food and liquids on the six day journey to the House of Death, stone tools, as
well as perishables such as baskets and wooden implements. In early eighteenth century
observations of Hasinai Caddo mortuary practices by Fray Espinosa (Hatcher 1927:162),
he noted that âas soon as the souls leave the body they travel towards the west and from
there they rise once more into the air and go close to the presence of the great captain
whom they call Caddi Ayo. From there they go to wait in a house located towards the south,
called the House of Death.â For the Caddo, the soulâs travel to the west is also associated
with the setting of the sun. An east-west body orientation was likely primarily due to a near
universal belief in the direction of the afterlife and the soulâs journey to the afterlife.
There is a considerable variation in the size of the cemeteries, which must relate not only
to the length of time they were used by different families and lineages as places for burial
of the dead, but also apparently depending upon if the cemeteries were used by a larger
community and not just extended family members. More than 40 percent of the Titus phase
Caddo cemeteries with reliable information on the numbers of burials they contained had
less than five interments, and another 24 percent had between 6â20 separate burials.
Approximately 17 percent had between 21â40 burials, and 9 percent had 41â80 graves.
Finally, almost another nine percent were very large cemeteries with either 81â160 or
160+ separate Caddo burial features. The two largest known Titus phase cemeteries are
the Shelby site on Greasy Creek (Thurmond 1990a; Mitchell 2000; Perttula et al. 2004)
and the Henderson-Southall site (41UR3) on Meddlin Creek (Perttula et al. 1998); both
cemeteries are situated a few miles above the confluence of tributary streams with Big
Cypress Creek, not far south of the Kitchen Branch site on Prairie Creek.

Titus phase Caddo cemeteries fall readily into two groups: the community cemetery and
the family cemetery (see Perttula and Nelson 1998). The community cemeteries are large
and well-planned, with more than 70â80 individuals, and often times must have been the
final resting place of individuals of higher social status or rank within various communities.
These very large cemeteries appear to be the result of burials from a number of farmsteads
and small village compounds within each of the political communities mentioned above,
and their existenceâand persistence in use for a number of generationsâshow that there
was a broad community-wide participation in ceremonial and mortuary rituals.
There are 13 known Titus phase community cemeteries, 12 on Big Cypress Creek and its
principal tributaries (i.e. Arms, Meddlin, Greasy, Boggy, and Dry creeks), and the 13th on
Walnut Creek, a tributary to Little Cypress Creek (see Figure 2-4). From north to south,
the community cemeteries include the Sandlin Dam; Tuck Carpenter; Harold Williams
(41CP10); W-S (41TT741, no. 124); Shelby/Tracy; Gold Star Ballroom (41UR107); Pleasure
Point (41MR63); Henderson-Southall; Big Oaks (41MR4); Sandy Creek (41MR122); Pea
Patch (41HS825); H. R. Taylor (41HS3); and Spider Lilly (41UR143) on Walnut Creek.
The community cemeteries are internally organized by space. They may also be differentiated
by the placement of high status or socially ranked individuals near the center of various
clusters of burials, or in the central part of the cemetery itself (see Perttula 2004:Figure
13.33), as if that individual was a founding member of one of the important Caddo families
in the larger community that created and maintained the large cemeteries.
At the W-S community cemetery site on Swauano Creek, there were two different periods
of time when the cemetery was apparently being used. This is evident by the different
orientation of certain burials and burial rows; the burials from each period did not overlap.
Ripley Engraved vessels are common throughout the cemetery, including a few with
the post-AD 1600 pendant triangle motif, and other recognizable vessel forms include
Simms Engraved and Taylor Engraved (primarily from the northern area), as well as Cass
Appliqued, again, mainly in the northern cemetery area. One distinctive vessel (Burial 68)
in the northern cemetery area was a double-tiered engraved vessel with suspension holes.
This vessel form (complete with double rows of suspension holes) may be a variety of
Natchitoches Engraved; similar vessels have been documented in a collection from the
J. M. Riley site (41UR2) and from a Titus phase site in the Little Cypress Creek basin
(Perttula 2006a). In the southern part of the cemetery (south of the dashed line), probably
the earliest episode of cemetery use, the burials were oriented northeast-southwest. The
remainder of the younger burials in the cemetery are in rough and closely-packed eastwest aligned rows.
Information on the range of funerary offerings from the two different periods of cemetery
use does shed some light on differences in mortuary ritual at a large Titus phase community
cemetery. First, the earlier burials in the southern part of the W-S cemetery tended to
have more ceramic vessels and caches of Talco arrow points than did the later and larger
northern part of the cemetery. Three different burials had more than 14 vessels placed as

offerings with the deceased); none of the burials on the northern part of the cemetery had
that many vessel offerings. Three other burials each had more than 30 Talco arrow points
in the graves, compared to only one burial in the northern part of the cemetery. However,
Talco points themselves are found in more graves in the youngest part of the cemetery,
whether they occurred in large caches or not. Second, the one burial with marine shell
beads and ceramic ear spools is also found in the southern and earlier cemetery area.
Third, five burials at the W-S cemetery had clay pipes as funerary offerings, and 80 percent
of them are in the northern cemetery area. Finally, four burials had large chipped blades,
probably Galt bifaces, and three of these are in the northern and younger cemetery area.
These large bifacially chipped blades may represent warrior symbols, used as badges or
items of display (cf. Hally 2008:465).
At the Shelby site, the available documentation (see Mitchell 2000; Perttula et al. 2004)
indicates that the many burial rows of interments had a roughly east-west orientation,
similar to the youngest burials in the northern part of the W-S site community cemetery.
Four burials are more northeast-southwest in orientation. A total of 119 burial pits had
been mapped by one of the diggers when the Shelby site was being looted, and apparently
more burials had been excavated in the cemetery, but the spatial patterning in this large
community cemetery is clear.
Mitchell (2000) indicates that not all the burials at the Shelby site were single, extended
interments. Some apparently held multiple individuals, and several of the Caddo burials
had been placed in deep and probable shaft tombs; signs of the looted shaft tombs
were still visible at the cemetery in 2004 (Perttula et al. 2004). Notes on file at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory at The University of Texas at Austin also indicate that
there was a large concentration of daub in the area of the later plotting of Burial 117, and
it is possible that this particular burial had been placed in the floor of a deliberately burned
and wattle and daub-covered Caddo structure. This burial is also significant because in
it were two 9-ft. long red cedar poles, a rare find indeed. The cedar poles may be the
preserved remnants of a wood litter upon which Burial 117 would have rested. One cannot
think of a wood litter on a prehistoric Caddo site without considering the cedar pole burial
litters in the Great Mortuary at the Spiro site (see Brown 1996), as these were among the
most laden in mortuary contexts there with exotic marine shell artifacts, embossed copper
plates, and other rare Southeastern ceremonial complex artifacts. While not as spectacular
in that sense as the litter burials from Spiro, this litter burial at the Shelby site was said to
contain five whole ceramic vessels, 22 arrow points, and many sherds from an uncertain
number of other vessels (Mitchell 2000). One of the vessels was described as a unique
tri-colored (red, yellow, and tan) bowl, which may be a Hatinu Engraved vessel, similar to
those seen in vessel collections from the Hatchel (41BW3), Clements (41CS25) (Gonzalez
et al. 2005:30 and Figure 4.5), and Foster (3LA27) (see Weinstein et al. 2003:Figures 106
and 107) sites in the Red River basin.
Other notable burials at the Shelby site had ceramic ear spools, rarely found in contexts
other than those associated with the social elite, and at least three large (20 cm) black

Big Fork chert bifacially blades came from burials (Mitchell 2000). Finally, one burial (not
identified by burial no.) was accompanied by a very large cache of 120 arrow points, 117
of which were of the finely-chipped Talco type, along with celts, hammerstones, axes, and a
probable heir-loomed bannerstone (Mitchell 2000). These kinds of funerary objects placed
by the Caddo with the deceased at the Shelby site are very much indicative of high-status
Titus phase burials (see Perttula 2004:401; Thurmond 1990a:235).
The family cemeteries on Titus phase sites are generally found in the immediate proximity
to a farmstead or hamlet, and they contain far few interments by comparison to the
much larger community cemeteries. They seem to have had about 10â20 individuals
in cemeteries along the western margins of the Titus phase area and between 20â40
individuals in the Titus phase heartland along Big Cypress Creek, suggesting that there
were intra-areal differences in population densities and the social organization of extended
families and lineages.
Burials within the family cemeteries generally included single extended inhumations
within a patterned arrangement of burials in rows, sometimes aligned east-west and other
time in roughly north-south rows. Burial pit sizes, funerary offerings, and preserved human
remains suggest the majority of the burials in the family cemeteries are adult males and
females.
Grave good associations and burial treatment of Caddo peoples in Titus phase family
cemeteries do not show much evidence among these individuals for differential status
or social rank. According to Thurmond (1990a:235â236), artifact associations in family
cemeteries differed primarily only by age and sex: adolescents tended to be buried with
more funerary offerings than either children or infants, but would have had fewer funerary
offerings than would the adults, whether they were male or female. The graves of males
often had clusters of arrow points in patterns suggesting they represented quivers of
arrows, and females commonly had polishing stones or more numerous pottery vessels.
Items of non-local origin (either vessels or stone tools) were extremely rare in burials of
either sex. Finally, graves with very large numbers of funerary offerings were quite limited
in Titus phase family cemeteries. This limited diversity in burial treatment is part of the
evidence preserved in the mortuary practices of these Caddo peoples that strongly hints
that there were not any considerable social organizational differences between affiliated
and kin-related farmsteads that created these cemeteries (cf. Carr 1995:157 and Tables
XIII and XIV). Carr (1995:Tables XI and XIV) further suggests that body treatment, body
preparation, and body orientation closely track beliefs about the soul and the afterlife
more than they do the social position of the deceased.
An example of a large family cemetery at the Pilgrimâs Pride village had a total of 30
interments (Perttula 2005:221â294). Its planned location within the village community,
and its internal character, suggest that the Pilgrimâs Pride site cemetery was probably used
for several generations by the different families and lineages that lived throughout the
large village. Although all the Caddo burials in the cemetery are single individuals placed

in an extended supine position, with their heads facing west, six different burial groupings
were recognized in the cemetery. These were defined on the basis of burial treatment (i.e.
distinct burial fills), grave pit size, and the kind and amount of funerary offerings placed
with the deceased (Perttula 2005:Table 11-5).
The six burial groupings sorted readily by character as well as spatially (see Perttula
2005:Figure 6â26) into two larger groupsâbased primarily on the use of red clay for burial
fill only in Groups IâIII. More important adult family members or lineage heads are included
in Groups I and IV, and they had the highest numbers of burial offerings, including celts,
arrow points, and other chipped and ground stone tools. Based on the relative position of
the different burial groups in the several rows of burials at the Pilgrimâs Pride site, the Group
IVâVI burials were later in time (perhaps more than a generation later) than the Group IâIII
burials. In other ways, however, the mortuary rituals used by the different groups were
very much the same through time. That is, the deceasedâwhether adult or juvenileâwere
placed on their back in a burial pit that was excavated into the red clay B-horizon, with their
heads facing west, towards the sunset (Perttula and Nelson 1998:378; Turner 1978:105).
The burials were accompanied primarily by ceramic vessels, placed by the head and along
one or both sides of the body (bowls, carinated bowls, jars, and bottles), that probably held
foods and liquids. A few individualsâprobably adult males and senior family membersâ
had caches of stone-tipped arrow points also placed with them in the grave, along with an
occasional ground stone celt or a clay elbow pipe. Other funerary offerings included clay
pigments and a few chipped stone tools (such as a beveled knife made from Florence A
chert that originated in southern Kansas) and caches of lithic debris from non-local raw
materials.
The 19 burials in the Pilgrimâs Pride cemetery had a mean of 8.3 funerary objects per
burial. Approximately 80 percent of these offerings were ceramic vessels. The frequencies
of funerary objects at this cemetery is on the lower end of the scale of burial furnishings
when compared to the other well-documented Titus phase cemeteries. Those cemeteries
include those at the R. L. Cason (41MX1), W. A. Ford (41TT2), Thomas P. Caldwell (41TT6),
and Alex Justiss (41TT13) sites, and they had between 16.8â24.5 funerary objects per
burial, with numerous distinctive caches of arrow points accounting for about 50â60
percent of the items placed with the deceased.
Ceramic vessels generally comprise 60â90 percent of the funerary offerings, and the
absolute quantity of funerary offerings is as much as four times lower than has been noted
at the four cemeteries dominated by offerings of arrow point caches/quivers. Pilgrimâs
Pride is at the low end of the scale of total specimens per burial, and it also has one
of the lowest number of arrow point cache/quiver offerings, only slightly higher than at
the Culpepper (41HP1) and J. E. Galt (41FK2) cemeteries, and about the same as at the
Mockingbird (41TT550) cemetery.
There are a number of burials found in Titus phase cemeteries that are clearly those of
important people, either adult members of the social elite, individual community leaders,
50

or even heads of paramount lineages (as suggested by Rogers et al. 2003:21â22). They
received special treatment at death, including having unique and rare artifacts placed
with them in the burial pits, just as they must have during their lives. It does appear to
be the case with Caddo burials in Titus phase sites that only a few individuals in these
communities had access (either in life or death) to the kinds, numbers, and variety of
funerary offerings that have been documented in Caddo cemeteries and individual burial
features in mound contexts, in shaft tombs, or in other special mortuary contexts from
East Texas where individuals had distinctive exotic and non-local funerary offerings. These
burial features appear to be those of individuals of high social status ranking, probably
adult males, that are found in contextually unique settings, with high numbers of ceramic
vessels and/or arrow point quivers and pipes, as well as a diverse array of other sorts of
funerary offerings. These individuals may represent those with a higher social position,
likely the heads of different lineages or extended kin groups that resided in farmsteads
comprising the community, and ended up being interred in associated cemeteries amidst
their kin relations.
Notable Caddo burials in Titus phase contexts include shaft tombs at four sites, two on
Big Cypress Creek, a third on Greasy Creek, and the Pine Tree Mound site in the Sabine
River basin; burials placed in two mounds on Big Cypress Creek; at least seven sites on Big
Cypress Creek and its tributaries with large chipped Galt-style bifaces; 17 burials at nine
different sites on tributaries of Big Cypress Creek with individuals buried with large numbers
of grave goods; and four burials from three different sites on tributaries to Big Cypress
Creek and White Oak Creek that had double extended supine burials with quantities of
grave goods. Taking into account the fact that cemeteries contain the burials of both adult
men and women, as well as some children, it is likely that this diversity in the absolute
quantity and kinds of funerary offerings in Titus phase Caddo sites represent the existence
of social differences among the Caddo communities that created and maintained these
cemeteries, particularly differences between adult men and women.
These unique burials are from Caddo peoples in different Titus phase political communities
that must have had considerable power and authority, at least in their own community. Such
burials are rare, certainly comprising less than 2 percent of the Titus phase population
at any one time, and probably less than that given the spotty record of complete burial
documentation on many of the Titus phase cemeteries.
Some 20 Titus phase sites have notable burials. Of those 20, quite a few are large
community cemeteries, including the Pleasure Point, Shelby/Tracy, H. R. Taylor, Spider
Lilly, Tuck Carpenter, and the Harold Williams sites (see Figure 2-4). Others are in the same
general area as the various political community centers already discussed along the larger
eastward and southern-flowing tributaries to Big Cypress Creek.
These important burials are found concentrated along Big Cypress Creek and its tributaries
in the Piney Woods, from near the headwaters of Brushy Creek to the lower reaches of Big
Cypress Creek in the Lake Oâ the Pines dam area. Two of the sites with notable Titus phase
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Chapter 2

Caddo burials are on tributaries to Little Cypress Creek, another is on Hawkins Creek in the
Sabine River basin, and one other is on a northward-flowing tributary to White Oak Creek.
Only 10 percent of these particular sites are in the Post Oak Savanna, with the remaining
90 percent occurring in the Piney Woods. This focused distribution across the cultural
landscape of the burial places of notable Caddo peoples is a further reminder that this
particular area had a regionally complex socio-political organization during Titus phase
times (Perttula 2004:401; Story 1990:339-340).
Seriation analysis of ceramic vessels and arrow point styles from Titus phase burials and
cemetery sites (see Perttula 1992:Appendix A; Turner 1978) suggest that most of the
notable Caddo burials, and the large community cemeteries, date after the early sixteenth
century, and lasted in regular use until at least the early to mid-seventeenth century. This
abandonment may have been âa reflection of reduced social complexity and the scope of
community integration, perhaps accompanied by a spatial coalescence and/or decrease
in settlement densityâ (Perttula 1998:82).
The prehistoric and early historic Titus phase Caddo cemeteries found in the Big Cypress
Creek basin represent archeological evidence of the social, material, and religious-symbolic
beliefs about death, the soul, and the afterlife among a series of related communities and
affiliated farmsteads. The adults and children buried in these cemeteries are believed to
have been lineally related, perhaps in some form of corporate descent group or lineage.
In these situations, the placement of burials in cemeteries (areas used exclusively for
the dead) are expected to reflect these lineal relationships, with burials with the same
orientation and proximity in rows likely to represent distinctive groups of related individuals.
The placement of burials one to another, and the kinds of funerary offerings placed with
the dead, are intimately tied to each personâs life, their ties to others in the community,
and to their social memories within that community.
At a broader spatial scale, the distribution of Titus phase Caddo cemeteries across the Big
Cypress Creek basin represent tangible evidence of the Caddoâs past in the landscape, as
also do the abandoned farmsteads and farmstead compounds of different communities.
The burials themselves, and the consecration of each cemetery as sacred ground, gave
each place a long-lasting meaning and cultural significance in everyday life.
In summary, the communities of Caddo peoples that lived in the Big Cypress Creek basin
in the fifteenth to seventeenth century AD comprised a series of groups that were tied
together by social, political, and religious beliefs embodied in the creation and use of
large community cemeteriesâseveral of which contain the graves of more than 80â100
individuals from several generations of useâand the construction of small earthen
mounds at key locations within the basin. These mound centers appear to have been the
ceremonial and political facilities of at least four political communities (see Figure 2-4),
or politically integrated social groups of Caddo peoples, with another political community
centered around Pine Tree Mound in the Sabine River basin. The development of these
social institutions, unique to these agricultural Caddo societies in the Northeast Texas
52

Piney Woods, in times of climatic fluctuations created the context for different forms of
social life and interaction that were in turn sustained for 10 or more generations among
these different Titus phase groups.
These Big Cypress Creek basin Caddo groups had leaders that apparently promoted social
solidarity and the incorporation of diverse groups and communities into a number of linked
polities. Based on comparisons with other contemporaneous small-scale agricultural
societies in the Mississippian world, âpower and political decision making [was] diffused
across many elements of society and individual wealth and status [was] de-emphasized.
These kinds of polities are united by ideologies that stress the corporate solidarity of
societyâ (King 2008:76).
Each of these polities had at its heart a newly created larger and community-centered
Caddo mound and village settlement, places where the most important and life-giving
ceremonies, rituals, and decisions were made by the social and political elite that guided
and organized the changing Titus phase societies living along Big Cypress Creek and its
many tributaries; each had their own distinctive social identity. Smaller farming households
were dispersed for several miles around the mound centers and community cemeteries.
Life for these Caddo was organized around the rhythm of planting and harvesting the
cultivated plants, men hunting large game, the rituals and ceremonies of the seasons, and
daily life in the households and village settlements.
At death, these Caddo peoples were laid to rest in sacred cemetery plots used by related
families or in large community cemeteries set up and maintained for several generations
near the seat of political authority in each of the political communities. These cemeteries
were usually established at some distance, both symbolically and in life, from the domestic
compounds. Caddo children that died at a young age were kept close to the living, as they
were buried beneath and/or near the household they had probably been born and raised
in. The deceased men, women, and adolescents, as well as the social and political elite,
were buried in ceremonies that lasted several days, and they were accompanied by various
offerings placed in the graves that were mean to help them in their journey to the afterlife.
The Caddo peoples that lived in the Big Cypress Creek basin thrived for ca. 250 years, âwell
into the protohistoric periodâ (Early 2004:573). However, by the time Europeans began
to regularly explore Northeast Texas in the first quarter of the eighteenth century, these
Caddo peoples and their communities had abandoned the region an unknown number of
years before.
A reconsideration of Titus phase chronologies, in combination with assessments of the
route of the de Soto-Moscoso 1542â1543 entrada through Northeast Texas (Bruseth
1992; Kenmotsu et al. 1993; Schambach 1989; Thurmond 1990b), suggests that: (a)
the Spanish entrada encountered the Titus phase peoplesâprobably the Lacane province
(see Hudson 1997)âand (b) that within 150 years of that encounter the area occupied by
the Titus phase had been virtually abandoned. There was a considerable length of time
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

53

Chapter 2

between the initial European-Caddo encounters in the Piney Woods and when the region
was ultimately abandoned by the Titus phase Caddo groups. While it is likely that some
Titus phase peoples moved to live with either the Red River Kadohadacho, or among the
Hasinai Caddo south of the Sabine River, current explanations for the demise of the Titus
phase hinge on the introduction and, more importantly, the continued exposure of Caddoan
groups to European epidemic diseases (Thurmond 1990a:233, 1990b; Perttula 1992),
which lead eventually to substantial depopulation among these Piney Woods groups.
Subsequent to the discontinuation of community cemeteries in the early to mid-seventeenth
century, most of the upper Sabine River, Cypress Creek, and Sulphur River basins were
abandoned (Thurmond 1990b; Perttula 1992). The only post-1680 Caddo occupations
that can be related to earlier use of the region are to be found in the lower Sulphur River
and Sabine River at known trade portages or along trail crossings of these major streams
(Harris et al. 1980; Jones 1968; Perttula 1992:172â177). None of the Caddo communities
in the Cypress Creek/upper Sabine basins appear to have been ethnographically described,
and what is known from ethnographic and archival documents pertains principally to the
Nadaco or Anadarko Caddo. This groupâs prehistoric antecedents are poorly known, and
they appear to have only settled in the Sabine River basin after ca. 1770 (Smith 1995:74).

Previous Test Excavation Investigations
at the Kitchen Branch Site
Timothy K. Perttula and Mason Miller

In 2004â2005, test excavations were completed at the Kitchen Branch site for TxDOT
(Perttula et al. 2005) as part of the proposed FM 557 expansion project. This included test
excavations on the southern knoll, the northern knoll, the northern sector, and the western
sector of the site (Figures 3-1 through 3-3). Late Archaic-Woodland and Late Caddo, Titus
phase, archeological remains and deposits were documented on the southern knoll, the
northern knoll, and the western sectors of the site, while minimal late 19th to mid-20th
century archeological deposits were documented on the southern knoll, the northern knoll,
and the northern sector.
The test excavations included the excavation of 14 shovel tests, 19 1 x 1-m units, three
40 x 40-cm fine screen sample units, and four gradall trenches on the southern knoll; two
1 x 1-m units were excavated on the northern knoll, as well as two shovel tests; nine shovel
tests and nine gradall trenches (ranging from 6.5 to 19.2 m in length and 1.55â1.65 m
in width) were excavated in the northern sector of the site; and two 1 x 1-m units and a
single shovel test were excavated in the siteâs very narrow western sector (see Figures
3-1, 3-4 through 3-6). The work in the different sectors of the site demonstrated that only
the southern knoll and the northern knoll contained archeological deposits with preserved
cultural features: those in the southern knoll were associated with an apparent Late Caddo
Titus phase domestic occupation, and those on the northern knoll were associated with a
late 19th early 20th century historic farmstead.
Since the southern knoll was the subject of more intensive investigation during the
mitigation phase of work at the site, it will be discussed in more detail below, a brief
summary is offered for investigations on other parts of the site as well. Within the northern
knoll area, a prehistoric site component was identified that was very sparse and disturbed
by intrusion by the siteâs historic component. Among the recovered prehistoric artifacts
were seven Caddo ceramic sherds and 42 pieces of lithic debris within two test units (Units
8 and 9). Two late 19th- to early 20th-century historic features were encountered in this
area as well (see Chapter 15) along with a complement of historic artifacts (primarily in the
upper 30 cm of sediments).
Though previous survey suggested that the northern sector of the Kitchen Branch siteâs
investigation area lacked significant, intact archeological deposits (Perttula and Nelson
2002), nine shovel tests and nine Gradall trenches were completed in this area to insure

that site components were not missed. None of the excavations revealed intact, significant
archeological deposits, confirming initial interpretations that the main occupation was
limited to landforms closer to the creek.
Two test units were also excavated across the highway in the siteâs western sector (Units
11 and 16; Figure 3-6), the portion of the site first identified by TxDOT archeologists in
1989. Excavations in this area revealed disturbed upper sediments (0â20 cm) filled
with road gravels and modern trash. Below this elevation, artifacts within the units were
indicative of Woodland and/or Late Archaic site components that were diffuse and of only
a peripheral nature relative to the much better-preserved components on the southern
knoll to the east.
On the southern knoll (Figure 3-7), the test excavations identified relatively thick E-horizon
sediments, including a 5â20-cm thick and compact, dark yellowish-brown, fine sandy
loam (Zone 2) deposit (Figure 3-8) that covered a ca. 50 m2 area. Cultural features (post
holes and pits) appeared to originate from this zone, suggesting that Zone 2 represented
a distinct deposit likely associated with the construction, use, and abandonment of a Titus
phase Caddo structure, or an associated occupational deposit. E-horizon deposits below
Zone 2 contained both Caddo and earlier archeological remains (i.e. Woodland and Late
Archaic in age), and these deposits extended to at least 70â80 centimeters below surface
(cmbs).
A number of prehistoric cultural features were identified in the southern knoll archeological
deposits during the test excavations (Figure 3-9). This included three possible smudge
pits between 24â57 cmbs, four post holes from a Caddo structure (identified between
25â68 cmbs), another 11 possible post holes that had been identified in either the floor
or profiles of excavated units, and a circular area of compact dark brown fine sandy loam
(not categorized as a formal feature) adjacent to one of the three smudge pits (Feature 7,
see Figure 3-3). The features, as a group, contained charcoal and charred plant remains
(including charred maize fragments), animal bones, ceramic sherds, and lithic debris.
Prehistoric artifacts were abundant in the southern knollâs archeological deposits. This
includes plain and decorated ceramic sherds (ca. 790), a clay elbow pipe sherd, lithic
debris (ca. 980), chipped and ground stone tools, burned clay, and fire-cracked rock, as
well as faunal and paleobotanical remains. The ceramic sherds include Ripley Engraved
bottle and bowl (simple, carinated, and compound bowls) sherds, and one possible Hodges
Engraved bottle sherd. The engraved and red-slipped sherds in the assemblage account for
13 percent of the decorated sherds, and the remaining sherds (87 percent) are from utility
wares. The utility ware sherds are from jars with a wide variety of decorative elements and
motifs on the rim and the vessel body. Identified types include Bullard Brushed, Harleton
Appliqued, La Rue Neck Banded, Maydelle Incised, McKinney Plain, and Pease BrushedIncised; these utility wares are common in Titus phase ceramic assemblages across
the region. Sherds with brushed decorative elements comprised more than 73 percent
of all the utility ware decorated sherds in the test excavation assemblage as well as 64

percent of all the decorated sherds from the site. Rims from plain vessels accounted for 23
percent of the rim sherds in the assemblage. The character of the Kitchen Branch ceramic
assemblage recovered from the archeological deposits on the southern knoll is broadly
consistent with the eastern Titus phase ceramic tradition in the Big Cypress Creek basin
(Perttula 2005; Perttula and Sherman 2009), and at the Kitchen Branch site the diversity
of ceramic vessel sherds was considered indicative of the fact that vessels were made at
the site in different sizes and shapes to âmeet the every day and ritual needs of the Caddo
peoplesâ (Perttula et al. 2005:51).
The ceramic sherds were recovered primarily from 10 to 70 cmbs, with peaks in frequency
between 30 and 60 cmbs. The Late Caddo component is represented primarily by the
archeological deposits above 70 cmbs (but even in that case, the principal occupational
deposits occur above 40 cmbs; the materials from depths below that may have come from
unrecognized pit and post features as well as bioturbative processes), while the Woodland
and Late Archaic material remains are best identified below 70 cmbs, and extending to
depths of 100 cm.
The chipped stone tools from the Kitchen Branch site test excavations included arrow points
and preforms, dart points and preforms, bifaces, gouges, flake tools, and a scraper, while
the ground stone tools were represented by pitted stones, manos, grinding slabs, grinding
basins, abraders, and hammerstones. By depth, the arrow points (Bassett and unidentified
stemmed forms) were restricted to 0â60 cmbs in the Titus phase archeological deposits,
but the dart points (Gary, var. Camden, Kent, Yarbrough, and a fragment of a Calf Creek
point from 70â80 cmbs) were found from 30â90 cmbs. The majority of the ground stone
tools were found from 40â80 cmbs, likely Woodland and Late Archaic deposits in the
main, although well mixed with Late Caddo archeological remains. No good evidence was
obtained for the presence of discrete Woodland or Late Archaic archeological deposits at
the site, because dart points of different ages did not appear to occur in stratigraphically
distinct or vertically separable contexts; there was no depositional separation between the
different Archaic and Woodland materials.
Lithic debris on the southern knoll was dominated by local quartzite raw materials in all
levels (74 percent in the deposits as a whole), with moderate to very low amounts of both
non-local and local cherts (13.1 percent), non-local novaculite (3.4 percent) and quartz
(0.1 percent), and local ferruginous sandstone (8.1 percent) and petrified wood (1.4
percent). No vertical patterning in raw material preferences were noted in the southern
knoll archeological deposits.
Fire-cracked rock was relatively abundant on the southern knoll in deposits below 40â70
cmbs. Three clusters of fire-cracked rockâincluding a concentration of fire-cracked rocks
and ground stone tools between 68â79 cmbs in Unit 10ââsuggests that several areas
were used for hot rock cooking in Archaic and Woodland times, most notably the crest and
southern slopes of the knollâ (Perttula et al. 2005:71).

Animal remains were poorly preserved at the Kitchen Branch site. They included remains
from white-tailed deer and from unidentified large mammals. A freshwater mussel shell
fragment was recovered from one of the smudge pits (Feature 7). Charred plant remains,
on the other hand, were generally well-preserved in archeological deposits on the southern
knoll (Perttula et al. 2005:74â79). These remains included wood charcoal, hickory and
walnut nut shell, acorn nutshell, corn (including cob fragments, kernel fragments, and
cupules and glumes), and possible tuber pieces and rhizome fragments. Seeds found in
the deposits were from grape and persimmon, or were unidentified to taxon, and there
were also cucurbit rind fragments.
Archeological investigations on the northern knoll had only sparse prehistoric archeological
deposits and remains, as previously mentioned. This area did have a substantial historic
component, including features from a rock chimney (rocks from a chimney fall, and a pit
below the chimney fall), as well as late 19th century to early 20th century domestic and
architectural remains (ceramic sherds, bottle glass, tin can fragments, wire nails, brick
fragments, and window glass), primarily recovered from 0â30 cmbs.

Summary
The highest densities of prehistoric artifacts and the only locus of prehistoric features at
the Kitchen Branch site were confined to the southern knoll (see Figure 3-1, and Perttula
et al. 2005:Figure 3). The prehistoric features and the majority of the recovered artifacts
were from a Titus phase occupation that may date from cal AD 1420â1510 based on the 2
sigma age ranges of two calibrated radiocarbon dates from Features 4 and 7 (Perttula et al.
2005:79). The ceramic artifacts from the site suggested that the Titus phase occupation took
place between ca. AD 1450â1550, in the earlier part of the phase. The 16 OCR dates from
the site have pedogenic markers that range from AD 1509â1552, also dating to the early
part of the Titus phase (Perttula et al. 2005:80). The analysis of the artifacts and features
on the southern knoll indicated that the best preserved archeological deposits, including a
localized dark brown sandy loam deposit (Zone 2), were from the Titus phase occupation;
the excavation of these anthropogenic deposits became one of the principal focuses of
the data recovery excavations in 2007 (see Chapter 5). From the test excavations, this
component had well-preserved features and archeological deposits that were apparently
part of the remnants of a shallowly buried prehistoric Caddo structure (or structures) and
associated outdoor activity areas marked by spatially discrete concentrations of ceramic
sherds, lithic debris and tools, burned clay, and charred plant remains.
Several dart points, and two other radiocarbon dates from the deepest part of the
archeological deposits (70â80 cmbs in Units 10 and 23) that were obtained in the test
excavations (cal 2-sigma age ranges of 880â780 BC and 3340â2930 BC), indicated
that there were earlier Archaic and Woodland period occupations on the southern knoll.
These were marked by an assortment of dart points, chipped and ground stone tools,
and small clusters of fire-cracked rocks. However, intact Archaic and/or Woodland period
archeological deposits were difficult to recognize, even below the depths at which the Late

Caddo materials were concentrated, and no features dating to these two periods were
defined during the test excavations.
On the basis of these archeological findings the Late Caddo component of the Kitchen
Branch site, located on the southern knoll, was considered to have research significance
and was recommended as eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places
under criterion D of 36 CFR Part 60.4. TxDOT and the Texas Historical Commission
concurred with this determination. Because of its research significance as a site with a
well-preserved Late Caddo, Titus phase, domestic farmstead or household occupation,
and the fact that the Kitchen Branch site could not be avoided by the proposed FM 557
construction activities, data recovery excavations were recommended as being warranted
on this component. The earlier Archaic and Woodland deposits and artifacts were not
recommended as having research significance, because of contextual integrity issues, and
these deposits were recommended as not warranting data recovery investigations.

Research Design for the Archeological
Analysis and Reporting of the Kitchen Branch
Site Excavations, and the Existing Collections
from the Horton Site and the Keering Site
Timothy K. Perttula, Mason D. Miller, and Rachel Feit
with contributions by Chase Earles
The purpose of this chapter is to present the full and comprehensive research design that
guided the analysis and write-up for publication of this technical report of the 2005 and
2007 excavations at the Kitchen Branch site (Perttula et al. 2005, 2007) sponsored by
TxDOT, as well as to complete the analysis of existing collections and records from the
Horton and Keering sites, the latter being obtained by TxDOT archeologists in 1974. Each
of the sites contain evidence of occupations by Caddo groups that are affiliated with the
Late Caddo, Titus phase (ca. AD 1430â1680) in the Big Cypress Creek basin (see Figure
2-3). This research design includes a discussion of the overall research perspective
we have proposed to take to complete the analysis and report writing, along with the
specification of relevant Titus phase-research issues for the three sites. We also include a
discussion concerning our approach to the analysis of Woodland and Archaic period lithic
artifacts from the Kitchen Branch site and the Keering site, as well as potential applicable
research problems these data could address, should certain contextual criteria be met at
both sites.

Introduction
This research design calls for the analysis of the recovered archeological data from the
testing and data recovery excavations at the Kitchen Branch site, the test excavations at
the Keering site, and an analysis of notes and photographs of collections from the Horton
site. For the Kitchen Branch site, this includes: (1) the full integration of the geophysical
data, (2) relevant information in field notes and records from features and archeological
deposits, (3) detailed analysis of the different recovered artifact categories, including
ceramic vessel and pipe sherds, chipped and ground stone lithics, burned clay, daub, firecracked rocks, late 19th-early 20th century historic artifacts, animal bones, and charred
plant remains, and (4) the analysis of the horizontal and vertical character of these
remains, whether in features or non-feature archeological deposits. The analysis includes
the preparation of all relevant illustrative materials, including but not limited to plans,
profiles, artifact density maps, artifact illustrations, etc. Relevant archeological data from

the test excavations at the Kitchen Branch site (Perttula et al. 2005)âincluding recovered
ceramic and lithic artifacts, as well as information on the character and distribution of
featuresâis fully analyzed and integrated with the 2007 data recovery information, as
will the archeological data from test excavations at the Keering site and analysis of
the limited available information from the Horton site. This research design includes a
discussion of the specific methods of analysis of recovered archeological materials, along
with recommendations concerning the samples collected in 2007 from the archeological
deposits at the Kitchen Branch site, and samples collected in 1974 from the Keering site,
that we believe warranted submission for special analyses: i.e. radiocarbon samples, fine
screen and flotation samples for paleobotanical analysis, sherds for thermoluminescence
(TL), instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) and petrographic analysis of selected
sherds, and absorbed and visible residue analyses of selected sherds.
Finally, this document proposes the content of a public outreach component for the Kitchen
Branch site data recovery project. The public outreach component is to be implemented in
coordination with, and based on input from, TxDOT and the THC.

Overall Research Perspective
The research perspective we have developed for the analytical investigations of the
Kitchen Branch site, the Horton site, and Keering site is based on the notion of houses
occurring in a landscape, the recognition of households, and a community of practice that
have material, temporal, and spatial expressions in the archeological record (e.g., Hendon
2010a:59â62, 2010b:260â261; Joyce 2008:28). The use of space becomes transformed
into âplacesâ on the landscape through human activity (Pluckhahn 2010a:100).
âPracticeâ is a social theory whose intent is to focus on the activities of individuals during
the course of undertaking their daily routines, and how those activities help define or
subvert broader social structures at any given moment (Bourdieu 1977). In archeological
terms, practice ârefers directly to what people doâ¦and their various interests, needs,
capabilities, and structural opportunities and constraintsâ (Hegmon 2003:220â221);
it is culturally constituted and âis used in the reproduction of social behaviorâ (Eckert
2008:10). By practice, then, we mean the routine and everyday things that people did in
the pastâspecifically in this case, the Titus phase Caddo peoples in the past and routines
such as pottery production, cooking, lithic tool manufacture, house construction, etc.âhow
these practices and actions represent historical processes (political, religious, gendered,
technological, etc.), and how people lived, reproduced, and transformed the culture around
them, contributing to short and long-term changes in cultural behavior and traditions (see
Johnson 2010:108â109; Pauketat 2001:80; Shennan 1993:55). It is the cumulative
tempo and rhythm of daily life that gives direction and structure to daily practices, as
well as the patterning in material culture that can be documented in the archeological
record, and as such constitutes their historically contingent or contextual meaning (i.e. as
documented as a variety of choices) within communities in particular environmental and
social situations.

Distinctive kinds of artifacts (especially decorated pottery) in Caddo contexts at sites like
the Kitchen Branch and Keering sites were circulated within or among specific cultural
and historical milieus; they have a social significance, and thus artifacts have a âsocial
lifeâ (Habicht-Mauche 2006:7). That is to say, the material culture of Caddo peoples have
a social significance and a social history, in that there are meanings inscribed in their
form and style that have been derived by people (potters included) as a result of âmaterial
transactions and performances that make up the day-to-day, rough-and-tumble of human
social lifeâ (Habicht-Mauche 2006:7). Examining the social history of that materiality and
the community of material culture practice through 1) a consideration of the wide range of
ceramic vessel sherds and lithic tools and debris at both sites, as well as 2) architectural
preferences (as best they can be reconstructed from the kinds and distribution of post
holes and other features at the Kitchen Branch site), and 3) the spatial organization of
households among the Caddo peoples that lived at the Kitchen Branch and Keering sites,
is expected to lead (through regional comparisons) to the identification of other Caddo
peoples that held similar symbolic, structural, and aesthetic beliefs about material culture
and how the world worked. The histories of how artifacts and house structures were made,
shaped, and used reflect technological, functional, and stylistic domestic practices, beliefs,
and ideas shared by different groups of people within households and communities of kinaffiliated Caddo peoples, a community of practice. Hendon (2010a:61) suggests that the
use of the community of practice idea is a more effective way to approach the significance
of everyday life in the archeological record because it emphasizes the central role of
practice as âthe means through which day-to-day reality is produced and changed over
time.â
In sum, to understand the history and use of the Titus phase households at the Kitchen
Branch and Keering sites, our focus is on materiality, use of space, and the history of
place in the archeological record of these Prairie Creek Caddo peoples. The importance
of space, place, and practice in this context is that they allow the examination of âthe
relationship between the actions of individuals and broader social phenomenaâ (Wilson
2008:3), namely the everyday actions of Caddo peoples in households that shared
domestic space and participation in the activities of daily life; and as identified through
architecture, artifact assemblages, and the size and scale of their spatial layout (including
indoor and outdoor space).

Research Design Issues
The development of pertinent research issues in this research design is predicated on
several archeological findings about Titus phase Caddo farming communities in the Big
Cypress Creek basin of the Northeast Texas Pineywoods, including the Kitchen Branch
site, the Horton site, and Keering site. These revolve around the archeological character
of Titus phase households, that is, the focus on the material outcome of a myriad of
shared practices by household members in a larger community (composed of households
occupied by a single nuclear or extended family). The intention is to investigate their
materiality (i.e. practices and experiences that have a material dimension and shape the
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

human experience within different social contexts, see Mills and Walker [2008:3, 12];
Pauketat and Meskell [2010:195]) as adduced from the detailed analysis of the spatial
organization of houses, features (including burial features at the Horton site), and use of
space (indoor as well as outdoor), in conjunction with the material culture assemblages
(particularly the pottery) when viewed as the cumulative practices of daily life:
â¢ First, the investigation area at the Kitchen Branch site contains a 15th to 16th
century Titus phase settlement, probably a farmstead or single household based on
the generally small area covered by intact archeological deposits and features on
the southern knoll. There may well be other households present in uninvestigated
areas of the site, given that it covers ca. 3.75 acres (Perttula et al. 2005:8â9). The
Keering site likely contains at least one domestic household.
â¢ Second, farmsteads or single households constitute âthe most fundamental
building blocks of the Caddoan [sic] settlement systemâ (Story 1990:336) because
they represent the basic constituents of Late Caddo period communities.
â¢ Third, the archeological study of well-preserved habitation contexts at individual
sites can lead to a broader appreciation of their functional and adaptive character,
as well as their spatial and social organization, and the nature of the tools and
domestic goods made on the sites;
â¢ Fourth, comparisons between the Kitchen Branch and Keering sites with other
contemporaneous Caddo settlements and political communities in the Big Cypress
Creek basin (see Figure 2-4) can be made, providing the opportunity to develop a
better understanding of the socio-political character and relationships of ancestral
Caddo peoples and how they lived in the region.
â¢ Fifth, despite these kinds of sites being recognized as fundamental building blocks
in furthering our understanding of Caddo prehistoric archeology, as Story (1990)
pointed out, few such Titus phase habitation sites other than the Kitchen Branch
site have ever been extensively examined in the Big Cypress Creek basin, and
none have been thoroughly investigated in the Prairie and Greasy Creek valleys.
â¢ Sixth, the age and functional character of the Kitchen Branch site, as well as
the preservation of charred plant remains from multiple features, indicates that
it contains archeological information on the development and intensification of
prehistoric agriculture and Caddo agricultural societies in Northeast Texas after ca.
AD 1300 (an agricultural tipping point in the region), which is important because
the development of agricultural lifeways by the prehistoric Caddo peoplesâeven
with evidence from a single site (or a single household within a larger site)âis
an event of considerable, if not paramount, significance in their native history
(Perttula 2008; Wilson 2012).
â¢ and Seventh, the evolution of Caddo agricultural lifeways contributed to broad
changes in patterns of social and community organization from the single household
to villages and community centers, long-distance exchange relationships between
70

elite groups, distinctive mortuary practices (at sites like Horton), the construction
of monumental earthen architecture, and elaboration in ritual behavior, material
culture character, technology, and practices, and any of these changes may be
manifest in the archeological record of sites such as Kitchen Branch or Keering.

Household Structure and Organization
Most of the known Titus phase sites are cemetery sites situated in the Big Cypress, Little
Cypress, and upper Sabine River basin settings (Perttula 2005:Figure 11-1). Habitation
sites of various kinds and sizes are known, but only a few have been studied in any detail
to recover evidence of Caddo architecture, their intra-site spatial organization, or the
character of their material culture. No Titus phase domestic settlements have been studied
in the Prairie Creek area until the excavations at the Kitchen Branch site (see Figure 2-4).
In general, Titus phase habitation sites like the Kitchen Branch site are apparently part
of residentially mobile communities, where much of the community lived in dispersed
farmsteads that recurrently moved from place to place every generation, but the community
itself remained strongly anchored to a particular part of the Big Cypress Creek basin.
Most of the known components appear to be like the Kitchen Branch site in that they
apparently represent permanent, year-round, settlements or households of agricultural
peoples, and thus they can tell us a great deal about domestic life and household/
community organization. We consider households to be âan activity group engaging in one
or more of the following practices: production, consumption or distribution, reproduction,
co-residence, and transmissionâ (Pluckhahn 2010b:334). Households would be
recognized archeologically in the Caddo area by a material definition: at least the presence
of one domestic wood structure, indoor and outdoor activity areas that are reflective of
the repeated use of domestic space (for food preparation and consumption, sleeping,
or various craft activities, as well as corn grinding and animal skin tanning, along with
food preparation in warmer months that probably occurred in outdoor space immediately
adjacent to structures) for ca. 1â2 decades, and the discarded artifacts from material
culture assemblages that reflect the creation of a long-term spatial history.
To better understand the character of such Titus phase settlements, we will employ the
analysis of archeological information from the Kitchen Branch site from several perspectives
to look at the actions and interactions of people within households âthrough household
co-membership and cooperation in a set of practicesâ (Pluckhahn 2010b:334) that have
material consequences in the archeological record. This includes the investigation of
settlement permanence and local land use (as seen in plant and animal use, use of local
clays, procurement of lithic raw materials); household and community configuration/social
interrelationships and the use of both indoor and outdoor space (i.e. household size and
function); feature types present and their use; the development of specialized storage
facilities (i.e. elevated granaries or storage pits); and the distribution and character of
associated artifact assemblages (Nash 2009:224).

We will also consider, employing the recovered material remains and their distribution
across the site, how gender played a role in daily activities there, being mindful of the
spatial dimensions of domestic activities and gender relations as they were expressed
at the small scaleâthat of the archeology of a householdânot at the larger scale of the
community of which it was a part. This engendering of the archeological record at the
Kitchen Branch site proceeds foremost from the available ethnographic record (cf. Roth
2010:5â6) of the division of labor among Caddo peoples to correlations with gendered
activities in the archeological record, in that men were said in 1691 to make the arrows
and tools used in agricultural activities, while women made baskets and reed mats, and
pottery vessels and âother clay utensils for domestic useâ (Casanas 1927:215). Casanas
also noted that women and men dressed deerskins and buffalo hides, and presumably
used stone scrapers and expedient flake tools in completing those tasks.
What these analyses are geared to is answering the following questions: what is the
temporal age and organizational character of a Titus phase household at the Kitchen
Branch site? How were traditional and new practices employed in the creation of household
and community identities, and how were they passed on generationally? It is essential,
therefore, to gather solid evidence on the range of activities carried out there as well as
the duration of the occupation. Archeological evidence that can be brought to bear on
understanding Caddo domestic household organization and task activities in Titus phase
times at the site include: (1) the identification and distribution of features, structures,
outdoor work areas, work platforms (i.e. ramadas), burials (if present), and spatial clusters
of artifacts across a strategically-placed block excavation and a remote sensing grid
on the southern knoll, namely the domestic spatial organization of the household and
its activities, as dictated by social rules and interaction; (2) the estimation of wall post
replacement through an examination of the original number of post holes associated with
individual domestic structures as well as the total number of post holes used to replace
rotten posts during the siteâs occupation (Marcoux 2010:119â120); was the occupation of
sufficient duration that all of the wall posts were replaced in individual structures? (3) the
form and function of material culture remains, as they relate to the subsistence economy,
time, and social interaction in a community of households as well as regional ceramic
traditions; and (4) the number, size, and volume of storage pits, as well as their possible
use-life (e.g., Wesson 1999). The evidence for storage may be interpreted âas evidence for
close attachments and significant investments by a group or groups of people in particular
points within a landscapeâ (Rodning 2010:186).
For the prehistoric Caddo, with a delayed-return economy that relied upon crop plants
(and where the yield from such resources were delayed for some amount of time), there
should be evidence for planned storage facilities as well as the use of storage containers
(i.e. large ceramic storage vessels and/or baskets). Storage facilities should be sufficiently
large in volume to contain at least a yearâs worth of food stuffs (see Schroeder 1999) as
well as seed stock. We will examine the character of the large pits at the Kitchen Branch
site (especially their volume and contents) to attempt to determine if they may be storage
features.

The distribution of features and the artifact assemblage from spatially discrete contexts
within the large block excavation will be used to define the Titus phase Caddo households
on the southern knoll at the Kitchen Branch site, if in fact there is more than one household
represented in the mass of post holes documented in the excavations (see Chapter 5).
The absolute dates from features, along with the spatial distribution and character of the
recovered artifacts (especially decorated ceramic vessel sherds) can be used to determine
the age and intra-site relationship of key site areas, features, and their associated material
culture remains: in other words, the occupational history of the Caddo settlement on the
southern knoll. Essentially, our efforts are intended to establish âthe ways in which spaces
are made âsocial placesâ through daily practice and, conversely, the ways that these places
influence practiceâ (Marcoux 2010:108).
Titus phase domestic households or farmsteads appear to be comprised of one to several
family units or households with house midden/daub concentrations and trash midden
deposits, and the Kitchen Branch site is apparently no exception, although no clear midden
deposits were identified there. We will attempt to determine what activities (cooking and
food processing, tool manufacture, etc.) occurred outside the house area at the Kitchen
Branch site using the artifact and feature data, also determine what other activities took
place inside the domicile, and relate them to the trash-filled pits, smudge pits, posts, work
platforms, and discarded artifact concentrations recognized in the block excavations and
scraping work. Individual structures will be recognized by regular patterns of post holes and
interior support posts, probably a central hearth, interior pits, along with interior benches
and racks for sleeping and above-ground storage.
Since calibrated 2 sigma (95 percent confidence level) radiocarbon dates will have a
60â150 year resolution for any one dated context (given typical standard error ranges),
they will considerably overlap in time or extend temporally beyond the occupational range,
even on a site occupied for a generation or less. Consequently, estimates of the duration of
the Caddo household occupation at Kitchen Branch will have to depend on more indirect
measurements, such as the longevity (estimated at less than 20 years) of wood pole and
thatch-covered structures before needing repair or replacement (see Good 1982:69;
Pauketat 2003;246; Smith 1995:236â241) given insect infestations and the rotting of
wood posts.
An indirect measurement of occupation duration that will be employed at the Kitchen
Branch site, and at Keering site, can also be derived from ceramic sherd accumulation
rates (see Varien 1999; Varien and Ortman 2005). Varienâs (1999:Table 4.2) compilation
of information on the accumulation of utility ware sherds from generationally mobile
but sedentary farmers, like those who lived at the Kitchen Branch site and Keering site,
suggests that 4,000â8,000 grams of cooking pot sherds would be accumulated per year
on a site occupied by Native American farmers through breakage and use in a domestic
context. We can obtain reliable estimates of the number and proportion (an estimated 87
percent in the test excavation ceramic assemblage at Kitchen Branch, for example; the
proportion of utility ware sherds from the data recovery work is comparable; see Chapter
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

73

Chapter 4

8) of utility ware sherds (and their average weight, estimated at ca. 4.3 g per sherd, see
Perttula et al. 2007:Table 3) on the southern knoll at Kitchen Branch because of our
extensive excavations and the results of the test excavations. Then we can apply Varienâs
utility ware sherd accumulation rate to propose a hypothetical occupation span for any
particular household that can be evaluated with available data from features and absolute
dates, keeping in mind that the excavations at Kitchen Branch were confined to only a
small part of the site, and that the total duration of the site as a whole may have been
different.

Place of the Site in the Local Political Community
This research issue is concerned with determining the place of a site like Kitchen Branch
within the local Prairie and Greasy Creeks political community. Specifically, how were Titus
phase households like those at Kitchen Branch situated within a larger community held
together by domestic, ceremonial, and community-based affairs and practices?
Titus phase political communities are represented by known concentrations of settlements,
mounds, and large cemeteries (see Figure 2-5). These political communities comprise a
cluster of interrelated household settlements and associated cemeteries (both family and
community-based, see Perttula 2005:370â388) that are centered on a key site or group
of sites distinguished by public architecture or built monuments (i.e. earthen mounds) and
large domestic village areas with multiple households. The Titus phase mounds became
permanent markers on the cultural landscape, because they were associated with specific
rituals, events, and peoples, and they made âa powerful social and political statement.
They serve[d] equally well to reinforce the positions of important people and social groups,
to mark territories, [and] to underscore common group identityâ (Milner 2004:305). The
construction of mounds over the structures of important peoples and places represent a
âcarefully contrived practice remarkable and memorable because of the objects involved
(famed, tainted, or potent) and the spatial and temporal context of its enactmentâ (Meskell
2008:238). At the other end of the continuum of community of practice is the deposition
of material remains at sites, like Kitchen Branch and Keering site, during the course of
daily life.
To investigate the scale of community organization of Titus phase Caddo people living in the
Prairie and Greasy Creek basins (see Figure 2-6), and determine the Kitchen Branch siteâs
place in it, we propose to identify contemporaneous Caddo settlements of comparable
as well as varying sizes and organizational complexity, apparent functions, and levels of
social importance in nearby communities through (a) collections and records research at
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, (b) examination of avocational archeological
collections and records from this part of the Big Cypress Creek basin (particularly the
collections and records of Robert L. Turner and Tommy Johns) (see Perttula et al. 2010a,
2010b, 2010c), and (c) an evaluation and synthesis of the published literature on the
nature and diversity of Titus phase communities. Several of the sacred Caddo places and

74

monuments of a postulated Titus phase political community in the Prairie Creek and Greasy
Creek area are already known (Perttula et al. 2004; Thurmond 1990a; Tunnell 1959).
Because these Caddo groups were apparently sedentary farmers with a basically stable
group composition and prescribed social relations, social encounters and interactions (i.e.
many-to-one cultural transmissions) are expected to have been highly predictable over the
long-term, but within circumscribed social boundaries. The social arrangement of these
dispersed settlements likely emphasized household, lineage, and clan, in that order.
Comparisons of ceramic decorative styles and technological styles from contemporaneous
Titus phase sites in the Prairie and Greasy Creek drainages within the Big Cypress Creek
basin, including Kitchen Branch, Horton, and Keering site, are also proposed, along with
geostatistical comparisons of ceramic attributes (i.e. similarity matrices, see Hart and
Brumbach 2009), to recognize and define distinct geographic areas of Caddo people
that were affiliated by kinship, marriage, and highly bounded social interaction. These
comparisons are designed to determine the level of inter-household and intercommunity
ceramic variability, and whether that variability is a product of a collection of potters
practicing distinct ceramic traditions at the household or community levels.
Perttula et al. (2005:54â57) have previously noted that the Kitchen Branch site ceramic
assemblage appears to belong to an eastern Titus phase ceramic tradition. The assemblage
shares similarities in utility wares, various Ripley Engraved motifs (this type being the
principal fine ware pottery), and in other engraved fine wares (such as Simms Engraved,
Taylor Engraved, and Bailey Engraved), with Titus phase sites on Prairie and Greasy creeks
and on Big Cypress Creek downstream in the Lake Oâ the Pines area. To extend and
refine these ceramic tradition comparisons further employing the larger assemblage of
decorated vessel sherds from the data recovery excavations, and establish the stylistic,
social, and community affiliations of the Caddo people that lived at the Kitchen Branch
site, we propose to document the diversity in decorative styles and technological attributes
of both wares in the Kitchen Branch and other contemporaneous Titus phase sites through
the examination of decorated sherd collections from them. These sites include P. S. Cash
(41CP2, sherds at TARL), George W. Rumsey (41CP3, sherds at TARL, vessels in private
collections, Perttula et al. 2010a), Sam Roberts (41CP8, sherds at TARL), Johns (41CP12,
vessels in private collections, Perttula et al. 2010b), Shelby Mound (41CP71, sherds and
vessels in private collections; see Perttula et al. 2004), Richard Watson (41MX6, sherds at
TARL), W. O. Reed (41UR1, sherds at TARL), and J. M. Riley (41UR2, sherds and vessels in
private collections), all in the Prairie and Greasy Creek basins (Figure 4-1).
Another means of examining the social character and social identity of Titus phase
political communities is the instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) of a sample
of both fine ware and utility ware ceramic sherds from the Kitchen Branch site, as well as
a broader sample from contemporaneous Titus phase sites in this part of the Big Cypress
Creek basin. We will also draw upon the extensive (+1,000 sherds) Caddo INAA database,
including more than 150 sherds from 27 different Titus phase sites (Perttula 2005:Table
11â12; Perttula and Ferguson 2010), at the University of Missouri Research Reactor.

These analyses will address three related questions concerning social interaction and
exchange practices among local Caddo groups as measured by ceramic data from Titus
phase domestic and civic-ceremonial sites. First, what kinds of ceramic vessels (and
possibly their contents?) were traded and exchanged between neighboring Titus phase
groups? Second, how frequently did such exchange and trade take place and what factors
were involved in the movement of pottery vessels? And third, which Titus phase political
communities in the Big Cypress Creek basin (based on the larger sample of INAA from other
locales in the basin, Perttula and Ferguson 2010), if any, were most intensively involved in
the exchange of vessels with the proposed Prairie and Greasy Creek political community
(see Figure 2-5), including the Kitchen Branch site? The answers to these questions should
demonstrate if exchange with near and far societies was central to Titus phase economies,
and if new ties and economic arrangements occurred during the life of the Prairie-Greasy
Creek communities.
We propose to submit 20 fine ware and utility ware sherds (with identifiable decorative
elements and motifs on them) from the Kitchen Branch site for INAA to obtain a measure
of the chemical composition of the ceramic vessels (and some indication of their
manufacturing locale) found there. Since daub and burned clay from the site are very likely
unaltered from their original composition, a small sample (n=2â5) of the daub and burned
clay fragments will be included in the 20 ceramic INAA analyses from the site to obtain a
natural âbaselineâ for comparison with the ceramic assemblage. To provide a somewhat
broader regional context for understanding the occurrence of INAA-defined and chemically
distinct ceramic wares made and used on Titus phase sites, we will submit an additional 10
samples from the excavations at Keering site for INAA analysis. GIS analyses of sites in the
MURR databaseâand these new INAA samplesâalong with the development of a chemical
compositional data layer in the GIS based on the specific geographic location of each INAA
sample (currently in progress by MURR on other Pineywoods Caddo INAA projects) and the
parts per million data from INAA sherds for key chemical elementsâshould allow for the
recognition of discrete chemical compositional groups within the Prairie and Greasy Creek
locale and other locales within the Big Cypress Creek basin. This, in turn, should provide
a basis for evaluating the extent and direction of local exchange, the existence of craft
specialists, and trade.
The INAA approach for the sherds from the sites selected for analysis will follow that of
Ferguson and Glascock (2010), namely the definition of internal chemical compositional
groups at the Kitchen Branch site in lieu of attempting to assign sherds and clay samples
to existing sub-regional chemical groups, and then make comparisons with other sites in
the Prairie and Greasy Creek basins as well as the current and large (+1000 samples)
Caddo INAA database. This approach will be able to establish if different clays with different
compositions were used to manufacture ceramic vessels that were eventually discarded
at the Kitchen Branch site and Keering site in the Prairie Creek basin. This approach will
be followed up by analyses of other key Caddo sites with large INAA samples (Perttula and
Ferguson 2010:Table 21), with the goal to define internal compositional groups, rather
than focus on refinements in the sub-regional chemical compositional groups previously

defined by MURR. Then, statistical analysis can be employed to discern the statistical
overlaps and compositional distances between each independently defined internal group
from the key sites, and examine the chemical and archeological relationships that are not
linked so closely to sub-regions defined on geographic and archeological terms. These
statistical comparisons between internal compositional groups from these other sites
may use the 12 most precise elements, as Ferguson and Glascock (2010) did with the
definition of internal chemical compositional groups at another East Texas Caddo site,
rather than relying on all 31 elements.

Local Subsistence Practices and Caddo Farming
Available archeological information suggests that Titus phase Caddo peoples had a diet
that primarily consisted of cultivated plants like maize, beans, and squash (Dering 2005;
Perttula 2008), supplemented by meat from game animals and wild plant foods like
hickory nuts and acorns. Agricultural pursuits were apparently of particular importance in
determining the location and eventual movement of individual farmsteads and hamlets,
factoring in suitable sandy soils that could be worked with wood and bone digging tools,
but also locations that were well-drained and elevated above the annual floods along Big
Cypress Creek and its tributaries, and had dependable/accessible water. How are these
agricultural constraints reflected in the spatial distribution of Late Caddo Titus phase sites
in the Prairie Creek and Greasy Creek basins? What we seem to see with sites like Kitchen
Branch is that these permanent settlements were dispersed in a variety of settings/
landforms around the important villages and community centers that were on tributary
streams near their confluence with Big Cypress Creek, such as Shelby (41CP71), P. S.
Cash (41CP2), E. S. Dooley (41CP4), and Sam Roberts (41CP8) (see Figures 6â7; see also
Perttula et al. 2004; Thurmond 1990a:135, 139, 144â146).
Subsistence practices were diverse across the Caddo archeological area in the reliance
on both wild plant and animal resources and cultivated plants. Dering (2005:344â346)
provides the most current summary of Titus phase subsistence as seen from preserved plant
remains. In general, these Caddo groups were food producers based on cultivated plants
(maize, beans, and squash), but foraging remained a significant part of the subsistence
regime. Hardwood nutshell collection and processing was particularly important, probably
for the production of carbohydrate and protein-rich hickory nut oil. The test excavations
and the data recovery investigations recovered archeological evidence for hardwood mast
processing at the Kitchen Branch site (see Perttula et al. 2005, 2007), including pitted
stones and cobbles for nutshell cracking, grinding stones for pounding or grinding nut
meats and shells, and masses of charred hardwood nutshells left over from the production
of the oily hickory food product in ceramic vessels.
What were the subsistence practices of the Titus phase peoples who lived at the Kitchen
Branch site? How important was plant food production in the Caddo subsistence
strategy at the site? Paleobotanical analysis of preserved plant remains in features and
archeological deposits at the site recovered in the data recovery workâin conjunction with

the paleobotanical results from the test excavations (see Perttula et al. 2005:74â79)â
should be able to provide key information on the contribution of domesticated plants in
the diet (as seen in the diversity of cultivated plant food remains that are present in the
paleobotanical assemblage, and the measured ubiquity of domesticates; i.e. the percent
occurrence of domesticated plants in fine screen and flotation samples) as well as the
reliance on wild plant foods, especially the collecting of hardwood mast. Animal remains are
poorly preserved at the Kitchen Branch site, however, but the detailed analysis of animal
remains may contribute useful information on the character of Titus phase subsistence
practices, particularly the hunting of game animals for meat and hides.
Other archeological evidence that will bear upon establishing the character of local
subsistence and Caddo farming at the Kitchen Branch site includes the following: (1)
residues, both visible and absorbed (Reber 2006:235), on pottery sherds; (2) phytoliths of
economic plants in organically-enriched pit features and anthropogenic deposits, as well as
in the analyzed residues; and (3) maize ubiquity and the ubiquity of other cultigens (Dering
2005:343â344 and Table 9-12). The analysis of residues on and in the paste of ceramic
sherds (see Beehr and Ambrose 2007; Reber 2006; Reber et al. 2004), and in organic
residues and phytoliths preserved in organically-enriched sediments in features, would
also provide direct evidence for the use of maize, wild plant foods, and animal products.
Charred organic residues (i.e. visible residue analysis, see Reber 2006) recovered from
ceramic sherds should represent residue of foods cooked in the vessel, which constitutes
useful information about the use of a vessel, as well as contributes empirical evidence of
what range of foods were used at a particular site. Absorbed residue analysis of sherds
also provides direct information on the use of these vessels by determining through lipid
analysis what was processed in a particular ceramic vessel (Reber 2006:238).
Although no Titus phase burials with preserved human remains were identified at the
Kitchen Branch site during data recovery investigations, stable carbon and nitrogen isotope
values from other nearby Titus phase sites with human remains can contribute relevant
proxy information on Titus phase Caddo subsistence practices at the Kitchen Branch
site. Current information from other stable isotope studies suggests that maize was an
important part of the Titus phase Caddo diet (ca. 50 percent of the diet was comprised of
maize) after ca. AD 1450 (Perttula 2005:Figure 11-20; Wilson 2011).

Chronology-building
To better understand the development and florescence of Titus phase Caddo societies in
the Big Cypress Creek basin as approached in the archeological investigation of a single
Titus phase site, chronology building is basic (see Story 1990:320). With respect to Titus
phase chronology-building, it is important that we have better temporal resolution for the
local sequences that have been developed for the Big Cypress Creek basin (see Thurmond
1990a; Perttula 2005:Table 11-2), as only a few Titus phase sites (less than 25) are
reasonably well-dated (i.e. have more than four or five radiocarbon dates). This will depend
upon more intensive dating of habitation and/or mortuary contexts at well-preserved Titus

phase sites through radiocarbon dating of features, and thermoluminescence (TL) dating
of ceramic sherds from key features and deposits.
From the data recovery excavations, we have established that the Kitchen Branch site
contains well-preserved habitation features with C14 datable plant remains from a number
of features (Table 4-1). Possible smudge pits and pits tend to have the highest densities
and ubiquities of charred plant remains that can be used for dating purposes after the
paleobotanical analyses have been completed. Based on our initial inspection of special
samples, we propose to select 15 samples from features for radiocarbon dating (standard
or AMS, depending upon the quantity of available charred materials) of charred plant
remains, particularly samples from annuals: namely charred nutshells and charred maize
remains. This includes plant remains from Features 2, 9A, 10, 12, 18, 19, 28, 30, 33, 34,
39, 40, 48, 53, 59, 63, 82, 87, 102, 119, 122, 156, 163, 165, 176, 180, 192, 202, 204,
209, 215, 219, 227, 235, and 236 all of which as currently assumed to relate to the Titus
period occupation (see Table 4-1).
Up to 15 additional radiocarbon assays will be collected from sherds in the Kitchen Branch
siteâs ceramic assemblage. Associated carbon within the paste of sherds during vessel
firing and use, or accumulated in surficial or absorbed residue, can be subjected to the same
radiocarbon analysis as charcoal and other direct plant-based carbon from the site. While
there are some risks of decreased resolution resulting from a sample containing multiple
âstrainsâ of carbon (naturally dissolved materials in the paste combined with intentionally
introduced temper elements and residues), such sampling has great potential in directly
dating the occupation, particularly when sherds are cross-sampled with other assays. For
the purposes of this study, wherever practical, we will select sherds for radiocarbon dating
that are also selected for TL, residue, petrographic, and/or INAA analysis (see below).
The Kitchen Branch site also has well-fired ceramics suitable for TL or luminescence
dating that are abundant in the archeological deposits. The luminescence dating of
ceramics (see Feathers 1997, 2000, 2003) has been applied with some considerable
success in a variety of settingsâand on different ceramic waresâin North America (Lipo
et al. 2005; Dykeman et al. 2002; Feathers 2009). Given the abundance of ceramics
of several different kinds and styles at all Caddo sites, the luminescence dating of both
plain and decorated sherds recovered from these many sites has begun to be explored at
Caddo sites (see Feathers 2010; Perttula and Feathers 2011) as a credible chronological
dating method. It has been suggested that the accuracy of TL dating is less (7â15 percent
standard error generally, or roughly + 40â80 years in a site of this age) when compared
to radiocarbon dates, comparison to previously collected radiocarbon and TL assays from
other Caddo sites indicate that this is not the case. The use of TL dating of ceramic sherds
is relatively new in East Texas Caddo archeological studies, and only three sites have had
TL dating: Pine Snake (41CE467), Tuinier Farm (41HP237), and Lang Pasture (41AN38).
Nonetheless, the standard error of the TL dates that have been obtained are statistically
comparable to the standard error on radiocarbon dates from the same sites: (a) with the
exception of three outliers from Lang Pasture (with a standard error of 21.0 percent), the

other 28 radiocarbon dates from these sites have mean standard errors that range from
4.8â12.1 percent; and (b) with the exception of three TL outlier dates with a mean standard
error of 19.3 percent from the Lang Pasture sites, the other 25 TL dates from these sites
have mean standard errors that range from 7.2â10.5 percent Furthermore, since it is a
method âthat dates the manufacture and use ofâ¦ceramic objects [that] provide a closer
relationship between the target event [when a site is occupied] and the dated event [the
age determined by the luminescence on a sherd]. Luminescence is particularly well suited
for the dating of ceramics since the method measures the time elapsed since vessels were
last heated, usually corresponding to manufacture or useâ (Lipo et al. 2005:535).
Because of some redundancy in the kinds of decorated sherds collected for TL dating
from the site (Table 4-2), 20 TL samples have been selected for dating purposes from the
53 TL samples that were originally collected from the site during the data recovery work.
The sherds available for TL sampling include both fine wares and utility wares in roughly
the proportions of the larger TL sample (i.e. approximately 25 percent fine wares and
75 percent utility wares) as well as in proportions seen in the overall sherd assemblage.
Obtaining TL dates from these samples (and radiocarbon dates from sherd split samples),
which include both fine ware sherds (i.e. engraved and red-slipped) and utility ware sherds
(i.e. brushed, brushed-appliqued, brushed-punctated, brushed-incised, incised, punctated,
incised-punctated, and appliqued) recovered from 15â62 cm bs (that is, from Zone 2C
through the upper part of Zone 4), should provide an excellent means to establish the
absolute age of the Late Caddo occupation at the Kitchen Branch site (as well as the age
of the one possible pre-AD 1300 sherd in the TL samples, see Sample 41 in Table 4-2), as
well as the ages of certain common ceramic wares made by the Late Caddo in the Prairie
Creek drainage.
A total of nine OSL samples of coarse quartz grains were taken from one stratigraphic
column at the Kitchen Branch site. These were taken from the west wall profile of Unit
18 in the North Block. At this time, these samples are available for formal analysis and
dating, but such investigations are not included in the current research design nor has any
funding been made available for such assays. Radiocarbon and TL samples will provide
sufficient temporal resolution of the principal occupation at the site. If more detailed OSL
investigation is found to be warranted, such additional analysis will be coordinated through
TxDOT.
Although unlikely, chronometric assays that do not support the working hypothesis about
site age and integrity would significantly alter our understanding of the site and change
the direction of further analyses. Should the various chronometric analyses ultimately
contradict the working hypothesis that a discrete Titus phase occupation can be identified
and interpreted, then we would reduce the level of effort proposed for other artifact class
analyses. The resulting effort will focus on inventory and description and further research
questions will be identified and pursued in consultation with TxDOT.

Analytical Methods
This section of the research design first presents the analytical methods we will employ
in the analysis and assessment of the features identified in the field work at the Kitchen
Branch site, as well as their supporting field notes, plans, and profiles. This is followed
by a detailed consideration of the analytical methods proposed for the analysis of the
recovered ceramic sherds, lithic artifacts, and other materials, among them daub/burned
clay, fire-cracked rock, and preserved plant and animal remains.

Feature Review, Identification, and Interpretation
We propose, as a basic part of the analysis of the archeological deposits at the Kitchen
Branch site, to conduct a thorough review of the data collected during the excavations for
each recorded feature to aid in their final interpretation. In particular, a more thorough
evaluation of the identified post holes will be a part of the analysis. An evaluation of post
hole patterning at the Kitchen Branch siteâincluding examining the depth, size, shape,
and character (i.e. color, texture, and inclusions) of the fill for each post hole, as well as the
spacing between individual post holesâwill be completed as part of the analytical effort
to refine the architectural character of any domestic structures. This analysis will permit
the identification of rebuilding episodes, allow us to examine the range of post holes and
other features in the interior of any structure; and determine what these post holes and
other features represent and what their placement implies about the use of any structure
and its internal spatial divisions.
To aid in this analysis, we will apply various digital graphic applications to refine
stratigraphic relationships, as well as horizontal patterning of artifacts and features at
the Kitchen Branch site. The graphic rendering of such data will highlight critical patterns
in the distribution of features so that ultimately those features can be linked together
functionally and temporally with reasonable confidence. In combination with a review of
field notes, and special analyses we propose, we aim to establish not only a final feature
database and their spatial configurations, but also apply functional interpretations of their
use.
Ultimately, an internal comparison of the features from the Kitchen Branch site, and
comparison of them with other Titus phase domestic settlements (including Pilgrimâs Pride
[41CP304], Ear Spool [41TT653], and Rookery Ridge [41UR133]), will refine interpretation.
Since it is postulated that the structural features attributed to the Titus phase occupations
at the Kitchen Branch site likely represent a single family household occupation spanning
no more than 10â15 years, it is essential to produce the most accurate representation of
those features. Such a representation will, in turn, allow for more refined analysis of the
site and the daily activities of its Caddo occupants, which is ultimately the intent of the
overall site analysis.

Analysis of the Recovered Artifacts
Not including the historic artifacts recovered from the southern knoll block excavations,
which are from a late 19th-early 20th century residential occupation centered on the
northern knoll (see Perttula et al. 2005:86), more than 10,000 prehistoric artifacts were
recovered in the block excavations at the Kitchen Branch site during the data recovery
work. The majority of the prehistoric artifacts come from 0â40 cm bs, especially between
20â40 cm bs. Approximately 2,000 more prehistoric artifacts had been found at the site
during the test excavations (Perttula et al. 2005:39â79). This is an average of about 80
artifacts per m2 across the block excavations. This section outlines our approach to the
analysis of the various categories of artifacts recovered in the test excavations and data
recovery work at the Kitchen Branch site.

Ceramic Sherds
In the data recovery work, 3,805 ceramic sherds were recovered from both fine ware,
utility ware, and plain ware vessels; the test excavations recovered another 792 vessel
and pipe sherds, as well as burned clay, and pieces of daub. There is one unique ceramic
artifact (Unit 56, 30â35 cm bs): a rectangular-shaped and incised-punctated piece with
suspension holes that was probably used as a simple ornament hung around oneâs neck.
Based on an inspection of the ceramic sherds from feature contexts in the data recovery
work (roughly 160 sherds) at the Kitchen Branch site before the detailed ceramic
analysis discussed in Chapter 8 was initiated, approximately 50 percent of the sherds
have decorations on them. At the Keering site, the proportion of decorated sherds in
the assemblage is a comparable 48 percent (Thurmond 1990a). This high proportion of
decorated sherds is completely consistent with a Late Caddo (i.e. post-AD 1430) ceramic
assemblage in the Big Cypress Creek basin, where vessels were commonly decorated on
both the rim and the body, the latter usually with brushing marks. The ceramic assemblages
from the Kitchen Branch, Horton, and Keering sites are stylistically affiliated with the Titus
phase, in that the engraved fine wares are dominated by sherds from Ripley Engraved
carinated bowls and bottles, while the decorated utility wares include many brushed vessel
sherds (probably from Bullard Brushed jars) or at least vessels brushed on their exterior
body surfaces (but not necessarily on the vessel rim), Harleton Appliqued, Maydelle Incised,
Pease Brushed-Incised, and McKinney Plain (see also Perttula 2005:47â51). There are
also several plain rims from well-made plain bowls at the Kitchen Branch site.
There are a few incised-punctated sherds from the site that resemble Crockett Curvilinear
Incised, including one proposed TL sample from 62 cm bs in the Middle Block (Perttula et
al. 2007:Figure 34). Such vessels are found in pre-AD 1300 Early Caddo period contexts
across much of northeastern Texas (cf. Suhm and Jelks 1962:31â34). However, recent
analyses of a mid-15th to mid-17th century Titus phase cemetery and midden deposit at
the Henry Spencer site (41UR315) has identified similar incised-punctated vessels and
vessel sherdsâwhich have been typed as Spencer Incised-Punctatedâand it is possible

85

Chapter 4

that the sherds at Kitchen Branch are from that Late Caddo type instead, and thus are
not culturally or temporally associated with a pre-AD 1300 use of the Kitchen Branch
site. TL dating of such sherds, as well as conventional dating of their contexts can provide
important data regarding cultural and temporal affiliation.
Our analytical approach to the study of the Caddo ceramic sherds and vessels (three
vessels from the Horton site) from the three sites is derived directly from and will adhere
to relevant provisions of a recently prepared CTA Ceramics Protocol Committee document
that details the nature of ceramic studies that are geared to regional cultural research
problems/questions that can be approached with ceramic analysis on prehistoric and
early historic aboriginal ceramic vessels and sherd assemblages in East and Northeast
Texas (Perttula 2010). Certainly a principal consideration of the ceramic analysis to be
done on this Northeast Texas Caddo project includes first refining or bracketing the age
and intra-site chronological relationships of the ceramics at each of the sites, starting with
the acquisition of radiocarbon and luminescence/TL dates (e.g., Feathers 2003, 2009)
from features or archeological deposits, and investigating differences and similarities in
ceramic decoration and manufacture.
With chronological determinations in hand, analysis of selected attributes of the ceramics
will then be employed to establish each siteâs occupational history as reconstructed from
ceramic stylistic analyses (i.e. variation in decorative elements and motifs in both the utility
ware and fine ware), and then determining structure and feature relationships through
time by defining single or temporally distinct ceramic assemblages. Utility ware vessels
were used for cooking, storage, and probably other culinary activities; they tend to have a
coarse paste, thick body walls, have smoothed interior surfaces, and are decorated with
wet-paste designs (i.e. decorations were made with tools and fingers prior to the vessel
being fired, when the vessel had a wet exterior surface). Fine wares are engraved and
red-slipped vessels that were used for food service and to hold liquids, as well as for other
purposes (effigy vessels). They tend to have fine pastes, with finely crushed tempers, are
frequently burnished on interior and/or exterior vessel surfaces (except the bottles, which
were burnished on exterior surfaces only), and have relatively thin body walls compared to
the utility wares.
Our approach to the analysis of Caddo ceramic vessels and sherds from the Kitchen
Branch, Horton, and Keering sites is based on the concept of ceramic practice. By ceramic
practice, we mean the decorative, technological, and formal attributes of sherds and
whole vessels that were chosen and employed by a potter or group of potters when they
made pottery vessels within a distinctive social community or network of socially related
individuals (see Eckert 2008:2â3, 10â13), as in the Prairie and Greasy Creek political
community. These practices as a whole form the âtechnical choices [that are] selected
in a rich context of tradition, value, alternatives, and compromisesâ (Rice 1996:140). As
Stark (2006:22) puts it, âpeople reproduce their cultural and social positions through daily
practice, that daily practice is structured by basic organizational principles,â and that daily
practice is expressed through tendencies and trends (habitus) âthat develop as a practical

solution to a particular demand within the framework of certain environmental and cultural
conditionsâ (Eckert 2008:10; see Bourdieu 1977).
These choices and tendencies exhibited in the manufacture and decoration of ceramics by
Titus phase potters indicate that the consideration of ceramic practice is a useful medium
for the study of technical systems (the tools and technical capabilities), social interaction,
style, and social identity, as well as the dissemination of relevant behaviors between
individuals (cf. Chilton 1999:2; van der Leeuw 2002:241; Rogers and Ehrlich 2008). Thus,
the particulars of ceramic practice and technical choice that are identified in a temporally
(and socially) related group of Titus phase Caddo sites are a means to recognize socially
defined groups that closely interacted, and transmitted âknowledge among individuals
creating potteryâ (McClure 2007:486) as a means of social learning; this knowledge of
manufacture and decoration choices was inherited by other descendant potters in that
group. In this context, then, ceramic practices shared or not shared by potters (who
were generally women in the community) reflect the learning of their craft from other
women in the community, and that âpatterns in local pottery styles, both technological
and decorative, result from potters making different decisions throughout the production
process but using a similar set of tools and techniques available to other potters within an
areaâ (Eckert 2008:2).
Such an approach as applied here will identify the key choices and trends in the character
of the production of domestic ceramics from these Caddo sites, including: use of raw
materials; temper; methods of manufacture; production areas; vessel forms and functions;
vessel size; and firing. Next, we will examine issues of style and social identity and changes
in culinary traditions as possible manifestations of changes in ceramic practice that
occurred in this particular region. Mortuary ceramics from nearby Caddo sites (Perttula
et al. 2010a, 2010b) may illustrate broad continuities in ceramic practice, particularly in
terms of vessel decoration and vessel form, but also they can demonstrate patterns in
technical choices that are very different from those that may be documented in domestic
Caddo ceramic assemblages of the same age and made by the same social group of
potters. We are also concerned with determining the character and frequency of the utility
ware vessel forms in Caddo households and components at these particular sites. The
proportion of utility wares, and their composition at the vessel (or minimum number of
vessels as determined from the analysis of the rim sherds) assemblage level, may be
related to (and influenced by) differences in culinary and plant food storage traditions as
well as the postulated intensification of maize consumption by Caddo groups that occurred
around AD 1300 and continued through the 17th century (see Wilson 2010; Wilson and
Perttula 2013). Finally, the disparate and variable ceramic practice data (i.e. decorative,
technological, and formal)âfrom both domestic and mortuary contexts, if possibleâmay
be employed to posit the existence of distinctive Titus phase, ceramic traditions within this
part of East Texas.
Stylistic expressions and variations in that expression, in material culture, dress, body
ornamentation, food practices, etc. can be a measure of social identity. However, the

recognition of style in archeological materials is more than âthe material correlateâ
[emphasis in the original] of social affiliationâ (Wobst 1999:120). Patterns of style reflect
variability in both individual choices as well as social group membership, and therefore
the existence and pervasiveness of styles in material cultureâour concern here being the
existence of local styles of ceramic decoration at the Kitchen Branch site, the Horton site,
and the Keering siteâreflect the strength of interaction between individuals (individual
potters), the form of cultural transmission (i.e. from parent to child; from a teacher to a
pupil; from older to younger members of a social group; or between unrelated individuals,
see McClure 2007:Table 1; Lipo and Eerkens 2008), and the ability of styles to be inherited
from one generation to the next (OâBrien and Lyman 2003:19). Styles âshare a common
developmental history and are from the same traditionâ (OâBrien and Lyman 2003:19). Style
in ceramics as used here simply mean the characteristic patterns of pottery decoration that
when applied to the rim and/or body of vessel in certain combinations and elements result
in a unique set of visually represented design motifs and attributes. The combinations may
be innumerable, as the choice âbetween certain kinds of design elements on ceramics
is not a functional consideration but rather is historically determined and selectively
âneutral,â because there is no inherent advantage between one element and the nextâ
(Meltzer 2003:140). In fact, ceramic practice among Caddo potters in Late Caddo period
times would have dictated the range of acceptable variation (a rather impressive variation,
particularly among the fine wares) in stylistic choices that were maintained for generations.
Styles are expected to change rapidly, more rapidly than functional forms of tools and
pottery vessel forms (see Rogers and Ehrlich 2008:3418). This follows from the idea that
stylistic traits have a relatively rapid turn-over because of their use in generating and
reinforcing cultural identity, their selectively neutral character (i.e. stylistic elements have
no differential effect on survival), and the potential high variation between individuals
and groups in learning and replicating specific shared styles, particularly (in the case
of ceramics) if Late Caddo potters were producing vessels largely independent of one
another, or had pottery craft specialists in different communities, that together comprised
a ceramic tradition at any one moment in time.
This focus on detailed stylistic analyses will be employed to answer broader questions of the
social and cultural affiliation of the Caddo groups that lived at the Kitchen Branch, Horton,
and Keering sites, and the place of these particular sites within a specific community of
Caddo people, through stylistic and vessel morphological comparisons with collections
from other broadly contemporaneous Caddo sites in the local area. These same analyses
will identify specific motifs on Titus phase fine ware vessels that may have iconographic
content (Gadus 2010, 2013), which if present, will be employed to examine certain
previously unrecognized aspects of Titus phase Caddo belief systems and social identity
within this community.
The stylistic analysis of Caddo ceramics from the Kitchen Branch, Horton, and Keering sites
will focus on the definition of recognizable decorative elements in the fine wares (i.e. the
engraved and red-slipped vessels, including carinated bowls and bottles) and utility wares,
88

AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

usually cooking or storage jars and simple bowls. These wares are known to have been
made and used differently, based on functional, technological, and stylistic analyses on
numerous Caddo sherd assemblages in the broader East Texas region, with uses ranging
from food service, cooking of food stuffs, as containers for liquids, and for plant food/seed
crop storage.
The ceramic analysis will be completed in conjunction with formal and technological
analyses of a robust sample of plain and decorated rim and body sherds (larger than
1.5 cm in length and width). The analysis emphasizes paste characteristics, non-plastic
inclusions, surface treatments, and firing environments of the decorated and plain sherd
assemblages, beginning first with the consideration of the rim sherds. The sorting of rims,
and their analysis to determine how many different vessels/vessel batches (and their forms)
are represented by the rims in the assemblage, will establish the number and proportion of
different kinds of fine wares, utility wares, and plain wares in the assemblagesânamely the
composition of day-to-day household ceramics. This approach of identifying the minimum
number of vessels is more representative of household use than a strict focus on sherds
sorted by surface treatment.
In specific terms, the detailed analysis of the Caddo ceramic sherds from the Kitchen
Branch site and the Keering site will first be based on the type of sherd (i.e. rim, body, or
base), and differences in their temper, rim, and lip form (cf. Brown 1996: Figure 2-12).
The orifice diameter of the rim sherds will also be established, as the orifice diameters of
vessels, used for cooking, food service, and the storage of food stuffs and liquids, provide
some indication of the scale of food preparation and food serving in a Caddo vessel
assemblage, and whether vessels were intended for individual or communal use.
Sherd analysis will continue with the documentation of decoration (if present, including
the identification of motifs and elements), surface treatment (smoothing, burnishing, or
polishing; see Rice 1987), and firing conditions. Sherd cross-sections will be inspected
macroscopically and with a 10X hand lens to determine the character of the paste and its
inclusions. Determining the firing conditions will be based on the identification of the firing
core in the sherd cross-sections and the identification of oxidation patterns as defined in
Teltser (1993:535â536 and Figure 2aâh; see also Perttula 2005:Figure 5-30iâl).
In conducting the detailed sherd analysis of the Kitchen Branch site and Keering site
assemblages, all the sherds will be examined at a basic level of detail to determine via the
tabulation of rim sherds the number of different vessels in the assemblages, as well as to
obtain comprehensive information on the decorative motifs and elements that are present
at both sites, and establish a plain/decorated sherd ratio for the assemblage as a whole. At
the Keering site, 40â50 percent of the plain and decorated sherds in the collection (n=924)
will be selected for detailed analysis, thus obtaining sufficient information (ca. 400 sherds
analyzed in detail) from that assemblage to characterize its stylistic and technological
diversity and insure that a representative sample has been subjected to analysis. At the
Kitchen Branch site, with an assemblage of approximately 4,650 sherds, a 25 percent
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

89

Chapter 4

sample of the plain body and base sherds, 25 percent of the decorated body sherds, and
100 percent of the rim sherds (both plain and decorated) will provide a reasonable sample
for detailed analysis. The goal is to obtain sufficient information from the assemblage to
characterize its stylistic and technological characteristics and insure that a representative
sample of plain and decorated rim and body sherds are subjected to analysis. Although
information was not currently available at the time the research design was prepared on
the number of plain vs. decorated sherds in the data recovery assemblage, if the ratio of
plain to decorated sherds in the test excavations (0.97) is representative, then the total
number of plain and decorated sherds at the Kitchen Branch site is 2,290 plain sherds
and 2,360 decorated sherds. A 25 percent sample of these sherd categories would lead
to the detailed analysis of approximately 1,160 sherds, providing an analytically detailed
sherd assemblage.
Attributes to be employed in the detailed analysis of the Late Caddo ceramic sherds from
these two sites will include: (a) temper, the deliberate and indeterminate materials found in
the paste (Rice 1987:411), including a variety of tempers (grog or crushed sherds, burned
bone, etc.); (b) although most of the sherds may be small and thus from indeterminate
vessel forms, where sherds are large enough, vessel form categories that may be identified
would include carinated bowls, bowls, jars, and bottles; (c) other form attributes will
include rim profile (i.e. outflaring or everted, direct or vertical, and inverted) and lip profile
(i.e. rounded, flat, or folded to the exterior, among others); (d) Observations on ceramic
sherd cross-sections permit consideration of oxidation patterns (Teltser 1993:Figure
2), namely the conditions under which a vessel was fired and then cooled after firing;
and (e) wall thickness will be recorded in millimeters (mm), using a vernier caliper, along
the mid-section of the sherd. With respect to interior and exterior surface treatment on
Caddo sherds, the primary methods of finishing the sherds are smoothing, and burnishing.
Smoothing creates âa finer and more regular surfaceâ¦[and] has a matte rather than a
lustrous surfaceâ (Rice 1987:138). Burnishing creates an irregular lustrous finish marked
by parallel facets left by the burnishing tool (perhaps a smoothed pebble or bone).
An Experimental Approach to Caddo Vessel Manufacture as Window into Titus Phase
Ceramic Practices
As an aspect of the analysis of the Caddo ceramics from the Kitchen Branch, Horton,
and Keering sites, we propose the incorporation of an experimental approach to Caddo
vessel manufacture as well as sherd analysis (based on the breakage of the vessels that
would be made in this experimental approach). That approach would consist of having
Chase Earles, a Caddo Nation of Oklahoma member who lives in Ada, Oklahoma, and
an artist who is currently creating traditional Caddo pottery (and the only known Caddo
member that is making traditional Caddo pottery), manufacture seven or eight Titus phase
vesselsâa range of both decorated utility ware jars and bowls and fine ware carinated
bowls and bottles known to be present in the Kitchen Branch sherd assemblageâunder
controlled and documented conditions, using local Prairie Creek clays. Each vessel would

90

AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

take between 9â15 hours to manufacture and decorate, along with time needed to process
the Prairie Creek clays.
This approach should provide a detailed framework into what 15th and early 16th century
Titus phase ceramic practices may have consisted ofâincluding what types of clay bodies
may have been used (e.g., gray alluvial clay, or red clay with iron or manganese in the
clay), how mature the firing was, including how vitrified the clay body becomes or if it was
low fired, etc.âbecause the conditions of manufacture and firing will be recorded and
each step carefully documented for further analyses in conjunction with the analyses of
the archeological ceramic samples (e.g., Harry 2010). The manufacture and firing of the
replicated vessels will take place in Ada, Oklahoma, at Mr. Earleâs residence and workshop.
Ancillary investigations will look at what kind, and how thick, of a slip was put on the vessel,
and if there were pigments, what was their composition, by trying various slip and pigment
compositions on the replicated vessels.
Tools to be used in the replication will likely include a board to roll out clay coils, smooth
polishing stones and/or mussel shells to smooth and/or burnish the surface of the pots
as they dry, and old corncobs and a wooden paddle to help with the rough shaping of the
vessel. A bowl may be used as a press mold to form the base of the vessel as a solid disk.
In general, replication steps by Mr. Earles will include the following (cf. Miller 2011):
1) prepare the clay and tempering materials, using both alluvial clay from the
Prairie Creek floodplain as well as an upland clay obtained in proximity to the
Kitchen Branch site. The tempering materials will include both grog and burned
bone, as these are the most common tempering materials used by Titus phase
potters. The proportions of temper to clay in the paste will be based on the results of
the petrographic analysis; previous petrographic analyses of Titus phase ceramics
indicate that temper inclusions comprise between 30â39 percent of the clay paste
(Skokan and Perttula 1998; Rogers 2009). The clay will be dried and crushed, as
will the temper (bone temper will be burned, then crushed and screened to obtain
the proper particle size), and any large inclusions (pebbles or vegetal material) will
be removed;
2) the clay and temper will be thoroughly mixed together in a dry state, then
covered with water over night to thoroughly moisten the clay particles. The excess
water is then poured off along with the organics that have floated to the top. The
mix is allowed to dry to a point where it can be kneaded. The kneading is done by
hand, thoroughly, so that a homogeneous mix is obtained;
3) the forming process is done by hand, and the base will be formed in a press
mold. The vessel walls will be at a consistent thickness, being built up by adding
flattened coils (ca. 7 cm wide and 10 mm in diameter when rounded) to the base by
pinching, using the data on vessel wall thickness obtained in the detailed analysis
of the rim, body, and base sherds from the Kitchen Branch site ceramics. The coils
will be welded together with a wet corncob and various scrapers, and a wood paddle

will be employed to shape the vessel and thin the body walls. Vessel forms for the
replicated utility wares and fine wares will be based on documented Titus phase
examples from the nearby Johns site (41CP12) (Perttula et al. 2010b);
4) when the vessels are completed, they are decorated (with fingers, smoothed
pebbles, wood, or bone tools, or flakes when the design is to be engraved) and dried,
then smoothed and burnished beginning at the leather-hard stage and continuing
until the vessel is dry. The decorations will follow examples of the 7â8 main Titus
phase ceramic types represented at the Kitchen Branch site (see Perttula et al.
2005);
5) the pottery will be fired in an uncontrolled open ground fire. The vessels will first
be pre-heated (to about 100 C) over a bed of coals to remove atmospheric water.
Next, oak wood fuel will be placed over the vessels and set on fire; the fire will be
allowed to burn down, in a reducing or partially reducing environment (a fire with a
lot of carbon or a smoking, smothering fire, as has been previously documented for
Titus phase ceramics, see Perttula [2005]), and no additional fuel is added. The
firing temperature will be relatively low (500â700 C), and the duration of firing will
be recorded. When the fire is cooled down, the vessels will be removed from the fire
and allowed to cool; and
6) since Titus phase potters occasionally used a clay slip as a decorative method
on fine wares, and/or rubbed either a red or white clay pigment into the engraved
lines on fine wares, the replication process will include the preparation of a redslipped vessel and engraved vessels with added pigments. The clay slip will be
prepared by adding crushed red ochre to a watery slip clay, then applied by finger
or brush in a thin (1â2 mm) layer. The pigments will be made by adding ground up
white kaolin clay or crushed pieces of red ochre to a clay paste, and adding a binder
(fat or grease, or perhaps Bois dâarc tree sap) to the clay mixture. In Titus phase
pottery, most vessels with slips were fired in an oxidizing environment to turn the
slip red. Vessels with pigments were fired primarily in a reducing environment, and
pigments (either red or white) were rubbed into the engraved lines after firing.
After the vessels have been made, they will be documented in Oklahoma through various
photographic, video, and written methods. Vessel form, decoration, and other qualitative
data will be among the information recorded. Included in the photographic documentation
of each vessel, the recording team will take numerous (approximately 75â100) photographs
of each vessel from multiple vantages, then use AutoDeskâs Photo Scene Editor (http://
labs.autodesk.com/utilities/photo_scene_editor/) to generate a detailed and accurate
three-dimensional virtual model of each vessel that can be used for post-breakage (see
below) measurements and interpretation, virtual preservation and digital archiving,
and illustration. Such techniques have been used in the lower Pecos region of Texas
to document archeological features in the field (John Campbell personal communication
September 12, 2011), and imagery posted online of other usersâ target objects suggest
that this will prove an excellent tool for virtual preservation.

Once they have been fully recorded in their intact state, the vessels will be broken into
sherds, but kept together by vessel. Vessels will be broken by dropping onto a hard surface
(with the vessel enclosed in a bag to keep the sherds together) rather than by smashing
with a tool such as a hammer, in an effort to better replicate inadvertent breakage on site,
although vessel breakage in and of itself is not considered an important element to the
analysis of the subsequent sherds. Rim, body, and base sherds from the replicated vessels
will then be analyzed in detail using the sherd analysis approach employed on this project
(which, in turn, is based upon the CTA ceramic analysis protocol for East Texas ceramics),
and the results compared to the manufacturing data during the replication to then be able
to extend the comparisons to the archeological samples, where manufacturing practices
can only be inferred on the basis of observed physical and petrographic data.

Ceramic Special Samples
The regional analysis of the chemical compositional make-up of Late Caddo, Titus phase,
pottery has the potential to help with the reconstruction of âhow people created, modified,
or moved items within a particular landscapeâ (Kantner 2008:54). It is likely that the
vast majority of the Caddo pottery made in East Texas was produced at the household
or community level, and then distributed and used locally, with an unknown quantity of
that pottery being made for trade or exchange with neighbors, both near and far-flung.
Continued INAA analyses on both utility wares and fine wares from the Kitchen Branch
site (n=20 sherds) and 10 sherds from the Keering siteâwill be important in establishing
production locales and their spatial scope, as well as delimiting both the kinds of pottery
made in each core production locale and the extent to which they made have been traded
and exchanged amongst neighboring Caddo groups. Additional review of published INAA
assays from other sites in the area will serve to enhance our understanding of regional raw
material procurement practices (Perttula and Ferguson 2010: Table 14). The most useful
INAA has been conducted on individual Caddo sites that have more than 10 sherds from
both fine ware and utility wares, as that sample size provides an opportunity to investigate
with larger and more representative samples the chemical variation in Caddo ceramics
at specific sites, and then make broader comparisons with Caddo INAA results at other
specific sites in the Big Cypress Creek and other parts of East Texas (Perttula and Ferguson
2010).
Given that quartz sands are a primary constituent of the paste of Caddo pottery over
much of East Texas, but that there are other mineral constituents that may have distinctive
proveniences in alluvial and upland clays, petrographic analysis of sherd pastes (Stoltman
2001) and local natural clay samples (n=2) from the Kitchen Branch site (n=18 sherds)
and the Keering site (n=5 sherds) will also be done to shed light on vessel provenance and
local vs. non-local manufacture. All proposed petrographic analysis sherds will be selected
from INAA samples (each sherd broken in half) , with one half to be submitted to MURR
for INAA, and the other half to be submitted to Dr. Leslie G. Cecil (Stephen F. Austin State
University) for petrographic analysis. Where the sherds are large enough, the may also be
selected for other (radiocarbon, residue, TL, etc.) analyses as well. Such complementary
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

93

Chapter 4

analyses may produce more robust (and perhaps better interpretable) results than can
be obtained from one method or another in isolation with respect to questions of paste
composition and identification of likely local vs. non-local pastes/sherds. INAA as well as
petrography are important in defining groups of sherds of likely local manufacture from
those that are not. Only the considerable sampling of sherds from sites across East Texas
through both petrography and INAA may allow for the identification of non-local vessel
sherds/pastes, and their provenance within the region.
There are sherds in the collection from the Kitchen Branch site that have visible residues;
we propose to submit a sample (n=20) of these sherds, from vessels of identifiable form,
size, and decoration, for visible residue and phytolith analysis. We also propose to submit
these same 20 ceramic sherds for absorbed residue analysis; in both cases, the analysis
will identify lipids preserved in these residues. Reber (2006) suggests that the most useful
and analytically comparable approach is to conduct both visible and absorbed residue
analysis on the same set of sherds from a particular set of sites, and this is how we propose
to proceed with the Kitchen Branch sherds selected for residue analysis. The samples will
be selected based on stratigraphy, feature context, and other chronometric indicators of
the Titus Phase component to maximize the analysis. As stated above, the visible and
absorbed residues from sherds can be radiocarbon dated (Hart and Lovis 2007).

Lithic Artifacts
Lithic artifacts are abundant in the Kitchen Branch archeological deposits. They include
from test excavations and data recovery investigations more than 5,150 pieces of lithic
debris and cores, chipped stone toolsâincluding projectile points and point preforms
(n=137), bifaces (n=43), unifacial flake tools (n=47), and chipped unifacial gouges
(n=12)âand a wide variety of ground stone tools (n=71), namely pitted stones, manos,
grinding slabs and basins, hammerstones, and abraders. Although the sample of lithic
artifacts is much smaller at the Keering site (n=422, Thurmond 1990:Table 28), the same
range of chipped and ground stone tools and debris are in the assemblage, including both
Archaic and Late Caddo lithics.
The dart points from the Kitchen Branch site run the gamut from Late Paleoindian
Dalton points; Middle Archaic side-notched and expanding stem forms and Late Archaic
Yarbrough points made from local quartzite; to Woodland period Gary and Kent points. The
Woodland and Late Archaic points are predominant, especially the Gary and Yarbrough
darts. The distinctive technological practice of dart point production in East Texas Archaic
and Woodland period times, regardless of the lithic raw material used in point production,
appears to have led to points that are thick compared to their width, with some points made
from small cobbles having unworked or cortical-covered bases. The technology suggests
the use of a punch that led to the removal of short curved flake scars on bifaces and points
reduced directly from pebbles and small cobbles. This East Texas technology represents
a distinctive technological tradition with an Eastern Woodlands character (Harry Shafer,
August 2010 personal communication).
94

AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

These points are found throughout the archeological deposits, strongly suggesting that the
southern knoll was fully formed and stabilized well before the Late Caddo occupation atop
it. The knoll was intermittently used for thousands of years, with more recurrent usage
after ca. 2500 years ago and lasting until ca. 1250 years ago. By depth, the majority of the
dart points were recovered between ca. 30â90 cm bs, and it may be the case that below
ca. 50 cm, there is a relatively undiluted pre-Caddo component.
Other chipped stone tools that almost certainly are part of these earlier occupations include
most, if not all, of the bifaces, biface preforms, and biface fragmentsâincluding several
large ferruginous sandstone bifacesâmany of the cores, and the unifacially chipped and
polished gouges. By depth, some of the unifacial flake tools were probably made, used,
and discarded in Archaic and Woodland times, although expedient flake tools and scrapers
are also present in Caddo chipped stone assemblages.
The arrow points from the site are diverse. There is one series of expanding stem arrow
point forms that may have been made and used by Caddo peoples between roughly AD
900â1300. These particular points actually outnumber the Late Caddo arrow points found
at the Kitchen Branch site, suggesting the landform may have been occupied in earlier
Caddo times, probably mainly for hunting and tool refurbishing activities, because there
may be only a handful of sherds that may date to this period in the ceramic assemblage,
implying very minimal domestic activities took place here during that time.
Titus phase arrow points found in the excavations at the Kitchen Branch site include Maud,
Bassett, and Perdiz types. The absence of Talco arrow points is notable, because these
are most commonly recovered in 17th century Titus phase components in the Big Cypress
Creek basin, suggesting that the Kitchen Branch site was abandoned sometime before AD
1600.
The recovery of ground stone tools at the Kitchen Branch site testify to the importance
of plant food processing during the prehistoric occupations of the site. Plant processing
tools include grinding slabs, metates, a mortar basin, manos, mano/pitted stones, pitted
stones, and pitted stone/abraders; most of these ground stone tools were made from local
ferruginous sandstone. There are also abraders and hematite pigment stone fragments
(probably used to create the pigment smeared in the engraved lines on pottery vessels and
for personal decoration), a partially grooved axe, and several cobble-sized hammerstones
of a coarse-grained quartzite.
Based on these findings, it is clear that there is a relatively robust chipped and ground
stone lithic assemblage at the Kitchen Branch site. Because of the fact that the site
was occupied at several different times by peoples that used chipped and ground stone
tools, the possibility is considerable that these artifacts may have become mixed together
through bioturbation and cultural activities on what was essentially a stable natural rise at
the time of the Titus phase occupation.

It is important to establish analytically that Titus phase and pre-Caddo lithic assemblages
(tools and lithic debris) can be usefully separated based on their vertical and spatial
distributions at the Kitchen Branch site and the Keering site. Contextual and component
associations of these tools will be unraveled during the proposed analyses by examination
of their provenience and technological characteristics, and comparison with results of the
various chronometric analyses proposed. That will be the first step of the proposed analysis
of the Kitchen Branch and the Keering site lithics. If analytically discrete assemblages
of lithic artifacts can be identified, such that clusters of tools and debris are apparent
in vertical and spatial dimensions, and their distributions can be correlated with the
distribution of ceramic sherds (in the case of the Titus phase occupations at the Kitchen
Branch and Keering sites) or fire-cracked rock (in the case of the pre-Caddo materials
at Kitchen Branch), then we propose to carry out a detailed analysis of these artifacts
and employ that data to investigate specific research issues that concern the practice
of chipped and ground stone production and use at the sites (see below). If, however,
the analysis of the vertical and spatial distribution of lithics indicates that no coherent
clusters of tools and debris can be identified at either site, then our focus will switch
to defining the temporal lithic diagnostics in combination with a more basic analysis for
inventory purposes of the remainder of the tools and debris that will at least be useful
for comparative studies of East Texas Archaic, Woodland, and Titus phase, chipped and
ground stone tools.
Fortunately for the analysis of the Titus phase lithic artifacts from the Kitchen Brach and
Keering sites, recent excavations at the Ear Spool site (41TT653), a single component
Titus phase site in the Sulphur River basin (Perttula and Sherman 2009:279â334),
provides an unusually detailed view of the character of a lithic assemblage on a fifteenth
to late sixteenth century habitation site. That assemblage includes the following kinds of
chipped stone tools: (a) arrow points of several types, including Perdiz, Bassett, Maud,
and Talco, with Perdiz points the oldest Titus phase arrow point form, and the Talco point
being the youngest; (b) oval and triangular arrow point preforms; (c) small flake or corederived bifaces used as cutting tools, scraping implements, or knives; (d) large bifacially
chipped and ovoid-shaped knives; (e) chopping tools; (f) flake scrapers; (g) unifaces and
utilized flakes; and (h) pebble and small cobble cores, with minimal flake removals, edge
abraded areas, and bipolar flaking. Ground stone tools of Late Caddo age that may be
present at the Kitchen Branch site and the Keering site include, based on the assemblage
of ground stone tools from the Ear Spool site, pitted anvil stones, grinding slabs, paint
pallets, abraders, manos (including pitted manos), mullers, polished stones, pestles, celts,
hammerstones, and battered pebbles/cobbles.
Information on the kinds of stone tools placed as grave goods in Titus phase burials, where
the age and sex of the individuals are known (see Turner 1978, 1992:Appendix; Perttula
et al. 1998:Table 3), also will be employed to discern if specific kinds of Late Caddo tools
are present in the Kitchen Branch site and the Keering site collections. In burials from the
Tuck Carpenter site (41CP5), virtually the only well-studied Titus phase cemetery with fairly
well-preserved human remains where bioarcheological studies of these human remains
96

AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

were conducted, tools placed with the deceased include: arrow points, large bifaces, celts,
abraders, gouges, and polished pebbles. It is likely that these are the tools that the living
Caddo believed the deceased should take, or need, with them on their journey to the
House of Death in the Sky (Parsons 1941:37): namely, bow and arrows, clothes, etc. for
the men, and cooking utensils, serving vessels, foodstuffs, etc. The Tuck Carpenter data
indicates that chipped and ground stone tools were placed with both adult men (mean=7.7
tools per burial), adult women (mean=5.0 tools per burial), adolescents (mean=10.9 tools
per burial), older children (mean=1.5 tools per burial), and younger children (mean=0.5
tools per burial) (Perttula et al. 1998:Table 3). From these data, we may surmise that both
men and women, and adolescent men and women, worked with tools during their lifetime,
with none of these tools necessarily confined to one age group or sex.
Preliminary evidence suggests that the Kitchen Branch site is located on a stable landform
that has moved and mixed artifacts through pedogenesis over time through repeated
occupations. In turn, the lithic assemblage at the Kitchen Branch site exhibits a moderate
amount of vertical variability that is likely the result of debris from earlier occupations
being dug up and redeposited onto later ones, and younger debris becoming mixed with
earlier ones by bioturbation. Since virtually all of the lithic debris from sites in these types
of contexts are non-temporally diagnostic, it may not be possible to conclusively identify
functional patterning of contemporaneous tools and debris for some of the lithics at
the site. Analysis in non-discrete contexts will most likely target basic quantitative and
qualitative data that will serve as a supplement to the more detailed ceramic analysis from
the Titus phase component. Therefore, lithic debris from non-discrete contexts may be
analyzed according to TxDOTâs draft protocol for Lithic Analysis.
There are likely pockets of intact lithic artifacts (particularly associated with the later Titus
phase occupation) that could yield significant information regarding lifeways and practices
at the Kitchen Branch site. For Analytical Units (AUsâhorizontally and/or vertically isolated
segments of a site that contain similar functional attributes) that can be confidently
isolated, analysis methods for the Kitchen Branch and the Keering site lithic assemblages
will follow TxDOTâs draft protocol for Lithic Analysis. Additionally, there are several research
issues regarding the analysis and interpretation of the Kitchen Branch and the Keering
site lithic artifacts that would warrant consideration should interpretable lithic assemblage
contexts be identified in the archeological deposits (including from features). They include:
â¢ What kinds of tools were made and used during the Late Caddo occupation? What
do the recovered lithic debris samples from Late Caddo contexts tell us about
the manufacturing and tool refurbishing and maintenance activities that occurred
there? The domestic lithic artifacts found on the Kitchen Branch and the Keering
sites that are from recognizably Caddo archeological deposits are a testament
to their use to hunt, butcher, and process animal and plant foods in household
contexts. They also have a social component, in that the histories of how they
were made and shaped are reflective of technological, functional, and stylistic
practices, beliefs, and ideas shared by different groups of related peoples within
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

97

Chapter 4

households and communities of kin-affiliated Caddo peoples. The proportions of
projectile points, expedient and formal flake tools (e.g., Tomka 2001), and ground
stone tools in any discrete Late Caddo tool assemblages at the sites will define
the nature of various animal hunting processing, and plant food processing, tasks
conducted in these domestic households. Specific use wear analysis of a sample
of these tools will help to substantiate functional interpretations of identified tools
and tool use at the sites.
â¢ Did Caddo lithic assemblages in the Kitchen Branch and the Keering site
households rely on the reduction of small pebbles of local cherts, petrified wood,
and quartzite to obtain flakes of sufficient size and shape to manufacture tools? We
will employ the overall character of lithic debris size grade dataâfour size classes,
6.3 mm (up to 6.3 mm in size), 12.7 mm (between 6.4â12.7 mm in size), 19.2
mm (between 12.8â19.2 mm), and 25.4 mm (between 19.2â25.4 mm in sizeâ
and the frequency of cortical pieces by raw material and size grade, to determine
whether the entire sequence of lithic tool production and maintenance took place
at the sites, and whether the principal activity was flake tool production from small
flake cores and unshaped pebbles. If tool production on site was important, then
we would expect that a considerable number of the pieces of lithic debris at these
Caddo sites would be representative of the initial shaping and cortex removal from
pebble raw materials, and less the product of tool resharpening and maintenance.
â¢ Are there non-local lithic raw materials (tools and debris) present in the
archeological deposits at the Kitchen Branch site and the Keering site, and what
does their procurement and use imply about social and trade relationships with
other contemporaneous Titus phase Caddo groups? Did these Titus phase Caddo
groups have regular access to non-local lithic raw materials for tool manufacture,
or was such access seen only at specific households? The consideration of this
research issue depends upon the quantification of local (i.e. quartzite, petrified
wood, and ferruginous sandstone, earth-toned chert pebbles) vs. non-local (i.e.
novaculite, Red River and Bowie gravel cherts, and quartz among the chipped
stone, and quartzitic sandstone, diorite, and tuff among the ground stone) lithic
raw materials in the chipped and ground stone tools and lithic debris (e.g., Banks
1990).
We will compare lithic data from the Kitchen Branch site and the Keering site to those
from published mortuary assemblages such as Tuck Carpenter (see above) to assess how
household and mortuary assemblages may differ from or conform to one another. It may
be possible to infer information about age and gender at the Kitchen Branch site from these
analyses. However, detailed use-wear analysis of Titus phase mortuary assemblages have
not been previously conducted. Therefore, it may not be possible to compare use-wear of
the two types of assemblage from published data. Additionally, in the case of mortuary
assemblages, the tools themselves would not likely have been extensively used prior to
interment; rather, many would have been purpose-made for the burial and for perpetual
use in the afterlife. Nonetheless, use-wear will be evaluated for both the Kitchen Branch

98

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

site and the Keering site assemblages (or samples of the assemblages) and these data
will be compared and used to interpret functional and social patterning.
If the analyses of the spatial distribution of Woodland and Archaic temporally diagnostic
artifacts (i.e. primarily the dart points, but also chipped stone gouges, and bifacial preforms
for dart point manufacture) confirm that there are discrete clusters or concentrations of
pre-Caddo lithics in the archeological deposits below the Late Caddo occupation, then
our analyses will be geared to characterizing these clusters by their tool composition,
technological parameters, and the use and relative proportion of non-local lithics as one
proxy for determining the mobility range of these pre-AD 700 peoples. With regard to
the composition of any identified tool assemblage, we will establish the proportions of
projectile points, multi-purpose tools (e.g., Merrill and Read 2010:441â443), expedient
and formal flake tools (e.g., Tomka 2001), and ground stone tools to define the nature
of various animal hunting/processing, and plant food processing tasks conducted by the
mobile hunter-gatherers that occupied the Kitchen Branch site and the Keering site.
For any discrete pre-Caddo lithic assemblages in the Kitchen Branch and the Keering
sites, we will seek to characterize the technology of tool production. Did it rely on the
reduction of small pebbles of local cherts, petrified wood, and quartzite to obtain flakes of
sufficient size and shape to manufacture tools or was the technological strategy oriented
to the production of bifaces? Since opportunistic flake reduction tends to be associated
with more sedentary groups while biface-based technology is more indicative of mobility
and portability (Sullivan and Rosen 1985), identifying the prevalence of one or the other
preferred method can provide a good deal of information regarding the character of
site occupations in pre-AD 700 contexts. This will be done by examining the discarded
remnants of tool production (cores and bifaces, as well as fragments of bifaces), and the
character of lithic debrisâsize grade data, the frequency of cortical pieces by raw material
and size grade, and flake categoriesâto determine what sequence of lithic tool production
and maintenance took place at the sites, and what the principal tool manufacturing
activities were. Additionally, a sample (approximately 5 percent) of any of the identified
biface preforms from the siteâs earlier assemblages will be examined for evidence of usewear, as their production and possible use may be a technological adaptation that bridges
the gap between opportunistic and mobile tools.
Non-local lithic raw materials (tools and debris) are expected to be present in the preCaddo archeological deposits and artifacts at the Kitchen Branch site and the Keering
site, and our research will quantify the proportions of local (i.e. quartzite, petrified wood,
and ferruginous sandstone, earth-toned chert pebbles) vs. non-local (i.e. novaculite, Red
River and Bowie gravel cherts, and quartz) raw materials among the chipped stone tools
and debris, and quartzitic sandstone, diorite, and tuff among the ground stone lithic raw
materials in the ground stone tools. These data on the procurement and use of non-local
lithic raw materials will be informative about the scale of movement of these pre-Caddo
groups across the landscape, as well as any existing social and trade relationships with
other contemporaneous hunting-gathering groups that moved more frequently through

lithic raw material source areas? Did the hunter-gatherers that encamped at the Kitchen
Branch site and the Keering site have regular access to non-local lithic raw materials for
tool manufacture, or was such access episodic and spatially biased?

Other Recovered Materials
Other archeological materials found in the excavations include fire-cracked rock (n=568),
burned clay (n=1066), daub (n=37), animal bone (n=492), and charred plant remains (an
estimated 58.9 grams from the sorting of 1/4-inch screening, 1/16-inch fine-screening, and
the heavy fraction of flotation samples. In the case of the fire-cracked rock, burned clay, and
daub, our particular focus will be to determine their spatial and vertical distributions, and
their possible co-association with other Late Caddo or pre-Caddo archeological deposits.
These materials are indicative of domestic practices, including house construction and
use (daub), use of hearths, ovens, and other features where heating was essential (burned
clay), and hot rock cooking (fire-cracked rock). Establishing their occurrence and density in
the archeological deposits are an integral part of determining the character of the different
occupations at the Kitchen Branch site.
Analysis of Recovered Plant and Animal Remains
Plant remains at the Kitchen Branch site appear to be well-preserved, based on the
analysis of the charred plant remains recovered in the test excavations (Perttula et al.
2005:74â79). Materials recovered included wood charcoal, thick-shelled hickory nutshell,
black walnut nutshell, acorn nutshell, and corn cob fragments, along with seeds of wild
plants (grape and persimmon), cucurbit rind, and pieces of a root tuber. There are charred
plant remains to be analyzed from a number of features excavated in the data recovery
investigations, and Dr. Leslie Bush of Macrobotanical Analysis (Mancahaca, Texas) will
conduct the analysis of these charred plant remains from the Kitchen Branch data recovery
investigations.
The fine-screen (n=29) and flotation samples (n=11, both light and heavy fractions) from
feature contexts represent the best contexts by which to obtain additional information
on the use of cultivated and wild plants by the Caddo inhabitants of the site, and thus
information useful to the consideration of âLocal Subsistence and Caddo Farming.â These
samples will be size-sorted through geologic mesh, following the protocol developed by
Macrobotanical Analysis. A full stack of graduated geologic meshes will be used for the fine
screen and flotation samples. Materials that do not pass through the No. 10 mesh (2 mm)
will be completely sorted, and all botanical remains will be counted, weighed, recorded,
and labeled. Weights will be measured on an Ohaus Scout II 200 x 0.01 g electronic
balance. Materials that fall through the 2 mm mesh (âresidueâ) will be examined under
a stereoscopic microscope at 7â45 X magnification for carbonized botanical remains.
Identifiable botanical material other than wood will be removed from the residue, counted,
weighed, recorded, and labeled. Partially carbonized wood, bark, and pine cones is to be
treated in the same manner as fully carbonized material in the laboratory, although they

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

are interpreted as modern. Samples will be handled only with gloves to retain suitability
for radiocarbon dating.
Botanical materials will be identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level by comparison
to materials in the Macrobotanical Analysis comparative collection and through the use
of standard reference works. Wood charcoal identification will be attempted for up to
20 randomly selected specimens from each sample. Wood charcoal fragments will be
snapped to reveal a transverse section and examined under a stereoscopic microscope at
28â180 X magnification. When necessary for identification purposes, tangential or radial
sections will be examined for ray seriation, presence of spiral thickenings, types and sizes
of inter-vessel pitting, and other minute characteristics that can only be seen at the higher
magnifications of this range.
The end result will be the identification of the plants in each of the samples, the context
of the plant materials and their ubiquity and abundance of the resources at the Kitchen
Branch site. Ubiquity measures will be employed to evaluate the Caddo use at the Kitchen
Branch household of weeds for their seeds, the cultivation of tropical cultigens, and the
overall reliance on nuts.
The recovery and analysis of preserved animal bones from the Titus phase component at
the Kitchen Branch site, even though the sample is small (n=492 individual specimens),
also provides an opportunity to obtain relevant data on local Caddo subsistence practices by
determining the range of faunal species taken by hunting, as well as the relative importance
of particular faunal species for food, furs, and tools. The bone collected from the site
excavations is variably preserved, with some elements containing clearly-distinguishable
morphology and others comprised only of small fragments, but overall the condition
of the bone is considered moderate to good. Standard zooarcheological identification
techniques will be employed by LeeAnna Schniebs of ArchaeoFaunas (Sanger, Texas) who
is an experienced analyst of prehistoric and early historic Caddo faunal assemblages in
East Texas. While the state of preservation dramatically affects the level of analysis, for
this study, the zooarcheologist will strive to identify animal species and genera (if possible),
using comparative skeletal collections. Attributes that are to be examined for each of the
bone fragments include taxon, element and portion of that element, symmetry, burning,
and weight.
The end result of this analysis will be a tabular and textual description of the animal bone
recovered from the site along with an interpretation of how that assemblage reflects the
dietary and technological practices of the Late Caddo occupants at the Kitchen Branch site.
If such elements as seasonality are discernable in the faunal materials, such discussions
will likewise be included.

Analysis of Historic Period Artifacts
There is a low density of late 19th-early 20th century historic artifacts (mainly bottle
glass and pieces of metal: including nails, hinges, bullet casings, etc.) across the site
excavations (n=985, about 5.5 historic artifacts per m2). This includes ceramics (n=43),
glass (n=1003), metal (n=306), synthetic-made (n=10), and cut lumber fragments (n=4).
No historic features were found in the block excavations, and no historic artifacts were found
in the defined prehistoric features that contain contemporous prehistoric artifacts, and
thus it is likely that these remains represent trash discarded from the historic occupation
on the nearby northern knoll where structural features were excavated during the testing
(Perttula et al. 2005:35â38).
While not the primary focus of the interpretive effort, we will complete basic analysis of the
historic artifact assemblage as part of the overall research effort. This analysis will include
identification of temporal and functional diagnostics (makerâs marks, bottle seams, etc.)
among the items collected and any discernable patterns in non-diagnostic items that may
reflect material or style preferences, occupation characteristics, or other cultural activity.
Brief archival research will be conducted as part of this analysis to create a general
summary of the siteâs historic period use.
One specific element of the siteâs historic componentâmetal artifactsâwill be of primary
analytical focus as it directly relates to the results of the geophysical investigations
conducted on the southern knoll. Over 94 percent of the metal artifacts were recovered
from the blockâs upper 25 cm (approximately 1.6 items per m2), with additional items
found only to depths of 35 cm bs. We will prepare a detailed distribution map of the
metal artifact finds for the entire excavation block. This map will be overlaid and compared
to the variable magnetometer readings across the block to assess whether, or to what
extent, the shallow metal artifacts may have influenced the magnetometer data and our
interpretations there from.
The analysis of the historic period artifacts will inform a discussion of how historic-period
land use and activities may have affected the integrity of the site. Our analysis will evaluate
whether historic-period land use has truncated elements of the Titus phase occupation,
for instance, and examine to what degree there may have been a blending of chronological
contexts.
Integration of the Geophysical Results
The full integration of the geophysical results into the overall archeological findings from
the Kitchen Branch site will necessitate the close collaboration of AmaTerra archeologists
and the geophysical specialist (Chester P. Walker, Archaeo-Geophysical Associates,
LLC). This integration of the geophysical and archeological data should start with the
construction of a GIS that includes layers of the distributions and densities of the various
artifact classes (particularly the Late Caddo ceramic sherds and the late nineteenth-early
twentieth century historic artifacts), archeological features, and geophysical data. Spatial

overlays of the different archeological datasets (distributions of features, artifacts, etc.)
and the geophysical data will allow for the detailed analysis of their interrelationships,
including establishing the effects, if any, that the various archeological data have on
the magnetic character of the geophysical data. This includes the consideration of the
following questions:
âAre
â archeological features legible in the geophysical data?
âDoes
â
the presence of archeological material create any trends in the geophysical data
that can beâby the preponderance of the archeological and geophysical dataâbest
accounted for in terms of interpretable archeological explanations?
âFinally,
â
if the answer to the first two geophysical questions is in the affirmative,
specifically what can then be said about the character of the site, and its archeological
record from the geophysical data? In essence, this will establish how we are able
to ascribe archeological meaning to geophysical anomalies. If there are no definitive
spatial relationships between geophysical anomalies, defined cultural features, and
the distribution of material culture remains at the Kitchen Branch site, then we will
establish the underlying reasonsâwhether geophysical, archeological, or a combination
of the nature of both datasetsâfor the spatial discordance.

Investigations Specific to the Horton and Keering sites
The Horton site is on an upland ridge overlooking the Big Cypress Creek floodplain, in the
north central part of the Titus phase heartland in the Big Cypress Creek basin; Walkers
Creek lies a short distance to the south (Hunt et al. 1996:Figure 1). The site is primarily
a 15th to early 16th century Titus phase cemeteryâcontemporaneous with the Kitchen
Branch occupationâwith at least 19 excavated burials (Turner 1978:Figure 33). The burials
were first exposed in a 1950s borrow pit adjacent to U.S. 271.
Ralph Nicholas, Ed German, and Robert L. Turner, Jr. excavated 15 burials at the site
in 1958, and several others were known to have been excavated by Alan Young in the
late 1960s (Hunt et al. 1996:15). Available notes and records from several of the burials
(Burials 1â5, 8â12, and 15) compiled by Turner have been reproduced by Hunt et al.
(1996:Appendix F). These indicate that the following funerary offerings were placed with
the burials: 83 ceramic vessels, one ceramic pipe, two Perdiz points, one Maud point, 23
Bassett points, two Talco points, nine unidentified points, and two ground stone celts.
Perttula et al. (2010a:275â303) have documented in detail a total of 30 Caddo vessels
from the site in the Robert L. Turner, Jr. collection, several more than were mentioned in
Hunt et al.âs (1996:Appendix F) summary of the Turner collections from the Horton site.
These vessels are from Burial 1 (n=1), Burial 2 (n=8), Burial 4 (n=7), Burial 10 (n=10), and
Burial 15 (n=4). The documented vessels include both utility wares (n=7, 23.3 percent)
and fine wares (n=20, 66.7 percent), as well as plain bowls (n=1), compound bowls (n=1),
and jars (n=1); plain wares comprise 10 percent of the vessel assemblage. Among the
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. 103

Chapter 4

utility wares are Karnack Brushed-Incised jars (n=1), Pease Brushed-Incised jars (n=1),
La Rue Neck Banded jars (n=1), Mockingbird Punctated jars (n=1), and currently untyped
brushed-punctated (n=1), incised (n=1), and punctated (n=1) jars. The fine wares include
several stylistic varieties of Ripley Engraved carinated bowls and compound bowls (n=9),
a Simms Engraved carinated bowl (n=1), a Turner Engraved compound bowl (n=1; this is
a new type defined by Perttula et al. [2010a]), a Hood Engraved effigy bowl (n=1), a Wilder
Engraved bottle (n=1), a Ripley Engraved bottle (n=1), other engraved carinated bowls and
compound bowls (n=4), and unidentified engraved bottles (n=2).
There are black and white negatives of three vessels in the TxDOT files from the Horton site
apparently taken by Milton Bell in 1974 with the permission of an unknown artifact collector.
These photographs have been delivered to the archeological research team at AmaTerra
and Archeological & Environmental Consultants, LLC, for more detailed documentation
and comparison with the other vessels from the Turner collection from the site (Perttula
et al. 2010a), and integration of these vessel data into the larger research themes of the
data recovery effort.
Along with the photographs from the Horton site, AmaTerra has taken possession of a
small collection of artifacts associated with the Keering site for analysis, reporting, and
integration into the larger research goals of the data recovery investigations. This site,
situated on an upland slope in the upper part of the Prairie Creek stream basin, was
tested by TxDOT in 1974 as part of a U.S. 271 right-of-way expansion project (Thurmond
1990a:149â152). A final report on those investigations has not been written, although
Thurmond (1990a:Table 28) completed a cursory examination of the artifacts from a
donated surface collection, TxDOT gradall trenches, and eight 5 x 5-ft units. His initial
analysis of the recovered artifacts suggests that the Keering site was occupied during
the Middle-Late Archaic and Woodland periods, as well as during Titus phase times. The
Late Caddo occupation represents by far the most intensive use of the site, based on the
amount of sherds recovered in the work (n=911), and numbers of arrow points (n=10)
compared to the dart points (n=10), along with a small number of chipped and ground
stone tools (n=34) of uncertain temporal attribution. No cultural features were identified.
Given the Late Caddo period of occupation for both the Kitchen Branch and Horton sites,
the contemporaneous Titus phase component at the Keering site will be the focus of our
ceramic and lithic analytical efforts.
While we will incorporate as much comparative data from the earlier investigations at the
Horton site and the Keering site into the interpretation and analysis of the Kitchen Branch
site, there are certain site-specific data that will be investigated in a site-specific manner.
These data include:
â¢ Direct comparison of the TxDOT-prepared plan view of five burials from the Horton
site with other published maps of the site in an effort to better identify which
burials are represented by the three vessels in the TxDOT imagery.

â¢ Conduct interviews with former TxDOT archeologist, Milton Bell, to elicit any
background information that he may recall regarding the Horton site and the

notes of the excavations) to provide a broader understanding of the nature and
results of the excavations at each site.

Public Outreach Component for the Kitchen Branch Site
It is important that the archeological excavations, artifact analysis, and the preparation
of a final report of the findings from the work at the Kitchen Branch site, provide a public
benefit. We recognize that with respect to the cultural resource management investigations
that were completed at the Kitchen Branch site (as well as the Horton site and the Keering
site), in accordance with both federal and state historic preservation laws, a public outreach
component is warranted to âensure that the nation [or the state] could benefit, over the
long-term future, from the active preservation and management of the countryâs heritage
of archaeological and historical propertiesâ (Lipe and Sebastian 2010:284).
There are a variety of materials that could constitute the public outreach component of the
Kitchen Branch data recovery project, based on the archeological information obtained
in the 2007 excavations, such as brochures, exhibits, videos, and public presentations
(Lipe and Sebastian 2010:292). We have recommend to TxDOT that the results of recent
archeological field investigations and related research at the Kitchen Branch site be used
to develop a public outreach effort that spotlights new engagement potential in dynamic,
interactive electronic book (E-Book) media.
As is well known, electronic media - such as web pages, email, and Adobe Acrobat PDF
documents - have revolutionized the accessibility of information. In many instances, this
content is broadly-engaging with appeal to a wide range of consumers, from schools and
students to professionals to the average individual. A perfect example of the utility and
varied applicability of electronic media is Texasâ own Texas Beyond History (http://www.
texasbeyondhistory.net), a website published (as of this publication) by the University
of Texas at Austin. On this website, a visitor can virtually dive into a large number of
topics associated with Texas history and prehistory from Kincaid Rockshelter to La Belle
shipwreck and beyond. The content, though, is mostly intended to be accessed and used
from a computer.

Proposed Project eBook
EBooks , however, are intended to be viewed using the rapidly increasing number of handheld tablet computers and smart phones. Much like standard PDFs, eBooks are contentrich electronic documents containing text and images, but unlike PDFs, eBooks are
dynamic, meaning their content remains the same on a variety of devices but the format
of that content changes to best fit the device and orientation of that device on which it is
being viewed. eBooks also offer opportunities for the viewer to interact with the material
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. 105

Chapter 4

they are reading. eBooks can allow users to pinch and zoom into maps and photos, call
out sidebar information, and view videos (among many other elements) directly from their
device. Additionally, eBooks are largely distributed through central virtual bookstores,
some of which include Appleâs ITunes and Googleâs Play stores as well as the websites of
more traditional booksellers such as Amazon and Barnes and Noble. These large, central
bookstores allow a larger number of potential viewers to find the content and load it easily
onto their preferred device.
For the public outreach portion of this project, the project team will produce a significantly
condensed and simpler version of the Data Recovery report that covers a brief summary of
Caddo archaeology and the work conducted at the Kitchen Branch site. It will specifically
focus on the ceramics at the site, the experimental archeology work conducted, and the
modern analog vessels produced and analyzed. Two similar versions of the document will
be prepared: one for Appleâs IBooks format and one in the more universal ePub format.
Both versions will be the equivalent of approximately 30 pages in a traditional paper
document.
The primary eBook will be prepared using Appleâs iBooks Author program, which creates a
dynamic electronic document to be consumed on Appleâs iPad tablets and Mac computers.
The program generates a broad array of interactive elements and dynamic formatting
options in a visually appealing manner. Along with the document text, the produced iBook
will include zoom in areas to learn about the Caddo region and interactive call-outs of
typifying ceramic vessel types and design elements. Chase Earlesâ description of his
methods for creating the pots used in the experimental archaeological investigations for
this project (see Chapter 10) will also be included, using photo slideshows and videos of
the vessel-production process. Additionally, the user will be able to virtually manipulate
(rotate, zoom, etc.) a sample of the digitally-produced three dimensional ceramic vessel
models (see Chapter 10) to get a closer look at them.
Along with the Apple-proprietary iBook, the team will produce a similar eBook using the
more universally-accessible ePub format. Whereas the iBook can only be accessed on
Apple devices (and for that matter only the iPad and Mac computer), ePubs are viewable
on virtually any electronic device that can open and view a PDF. There is, however, a
trade-off in the formatâs interactive functionality. Though the general content will be the

Data Recovery Investigations and
Findings from Kitchen Branch Site
Timothy K. Perttula and Mason D. Miller
with contributions by Chester P. Walker

Introduction
Data recovery investigations in 2007 at the Kitchen Branch site consisted of three phases:
(1) block set up and geophysical remote sensing; (2) block excavations of contiguous
hand-excavated 1 x 1 m units; and (3) mechanical and manual scraping of areas adjacent
to the block excavations. This chapter discusses these different phases of work and the
methods used in completing them.

Block Setup and Geophysical Investigations
Data recovery block excavations began in the spring of 2007 with remote sensing
investigations within a 425 m2 area along the southern knoll (Figures 5-1 through 5-3). This
geophysical investigation area was defined by the distribution of artifact concentrations and
features identified during the testing phase investigations (see Perttula et al. 2005:Figure
38; Perttula et al. 2007:Figure 5). After the geophysical survey grid had been identified
and cleared, archeologists conducted a brief metal detector sweep of the site area to
recover all objects that may impact the remote sensing data. The metal detector sweep
was conducted using Whites Electronics Prizm III and IV model metal detectors (n=2).
Over the course of several hours, archeologists of mixed proficiency with the equipment
worked in pairs and conducted regular linear transects spaced roughly two meters apart
across the study area. When the detector indicated metal, the archeologists swept the
ground surface and manually dug small holes in an attempt to identify and remove the
object. Both detector models included depth indicators which guided the archeologists
to the anticipated object depth. Excavations generally were limited to the upper 10-15
centimeters within a hole roughly 20 centimeters in diameter. Upon removal, the crews
checked the excavated hole for additional metal and expanded their excavated area as
necessary then resumed their linear sweeps, eventually investigating the full excavation
block. Crews did encounter a relatively large number of âemptyâ test holes during their
investigations but most often expanded them to find the object and remove it. At the time
of the metal detector work, archeologists were confident that they had identified the vast
majority of the ferrous objects on the site and moved into the next phase of geophysical
investigations. It was only after the subsequent magnetometer data was collected (see
below) and the 247 ferrous objects were recovered from test units (see Chapter 15) was
this error identified.

A detailed geophysical survey was conducted using a GeoScan Research RM15 resistivity
meter, a Bartington Grad 601-2 dual sensor fluxgate gradiometer, and a GSSI SIR-2000
Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) with a 400 MHz dipole antenna (Perttula et al. 2007:12â
19). The geophysical survey included the proposed block excavation area, but extended
over a larger area (see Perttula et al. 2007:Figure 5) to examine areas outside the block
that would eventually be machine-scraped for feature identification and documentation.
Thus, the geophysical investigations were performed to supplement the information
gained during the siteâs testing (as well as the data recovery work to come), but its purpose
was not to guide the excavations. Ongoing rains at the time of geophysical survey had a
marked, negative effect on the GPR and resistivity readings from the site and the resulting
data from those tools was compromised by the water suspended in the sediments.

data within the geophysical survey grid.

Initial impressions from the field suggested that the best geophysical results came from
the magnetometer data, as it showed two areas of magnetic enhancement (magneticallyhigh areas that typically correlate to artifact-rich site areas and features, especially areas
with ceramics, daub, and clay-lined hearths) and two possible smaller circular features
that were interpreted as possible magnetic signatures for special use structures (Figures
5-4 and 5-5). Similar areas of magnetic enhancement have been noted in several
magnetometer data sets on small prehistoric Caddo hamlets or farmsteads in East Texas
that are shallowly buried in sandy to sandy loam soils. The best examples to date of
magnetically enhanced areas identified in geophysical data on Caddo sites come from the
Leaning Rock site (41SM325) as well as the Beech Ridge (41NA242) and Tallow Grove
(41NA231) sites (Walker and Perttula 2008). In the case of the Kitchen Branch site, the
two areas of magnetic enhancement (see Perttula et al. 2007:Figure 14) correlated well
with artifact density maps produced during the site testing investigations (Perttula et al.
2005:Figures 24â25 and 34â35), while the smaller, circular features were of interest due
to their apparent circular shape and small size (estimated at 3 m in diameter), as they
were thought to be associated with likely Caddo granaries as identified from other sites in
East Texas (Perttula and Rogers 2007).

Despite the crewâs early efforts to collect all metallic objects from the site prior to
magnetometer survey (through the initial metal detector sweep) a large amount of iron
(247 pieces weighing 1.8 kg) remained buried within the excavation block area. While
user error is likely a contributor to the incomplete metallic object recovery on the site,
equipment sensitivity could also have been a significant cause as well. Whites Electronics
suggests the units can detect to depths of up to approximately 10 inches (25 cm), but
University of Nebraska anthropology professor and metal detecting specialist, Dr. Douglas
Scott (2011) suggests units such as these have a realistic and practical detecting depth
of approximately 4-5 inches (10-12 centimeters). This reduced, practical detecting depth
likely accounts for the significant amount of ferrous ânoiseâ that was displayed in the
subsequent magnetometer composites (see below). Subsequent analysis, including the
addition of historic iron artifacts identified and collected during block excavations (see
Chapter 15) has made some of these earlier feature-related conclusions more tentative
(Figure 5-6). According to Walker (see Appendix 5-1), âthe strong dipolar signatures in the
magnetometer data are the result of metal debrisâ¦ Given the high number of metal historic
artifacts recovered from the site it is highly possible that these magnetic patterns are the
result of metal debris and not prehistoric Caddo archeological features. The magnetic data
from the Kitchen Branch site is extremely noisy due to the high concentrations of metal
artifactsâ¦â While the magnetometer results could reflect magnetic signatures from the
prehistoric Caddo use of the site, which makes sense given the spatial correlation between

the identified features, the

artifacts, and the larger

magnetic
enhancement data, the
extent of metallic noise
makes this impossible to
discern, and more likely it is
the siteâs historic occupation
that is overwhelming any
prehistoric signature.

Block Excavations
The data recovery work at
the Kitchen Branch site in
2007 consisted of hand
excavations in a large block
on the southern knoll,
followed by a combination of
hand-dug shovel skimming
and mechanical scraping of
a considerable contiguous
area around the block. The
hand excavations in the large
block, when completed,
covered a 152 m2 area,

on the site to areas of magnetic enhancement.
divided into a North Block (8
x 11 m), a Middle Block (6 x
6 m), and a South Block (4 x
3 m); the Middle and South Blocks were connected by a 1 x 6 m trench of 1 x 1-m units.
Two 1 x 3-m trenches and a 2 x 2 m unit were also excavated along the edge of the North
and Middle blocks (Figure 5-7). Some of the hand-excavated units from the 2004-2005
test excavations were included within these block excavations and the backfill from these
units was removed prior to initiating the block excavations (see Figures 5-2 and 5-3).
Excavations in the block were completed using a combination of natural and arbitrary
levels in hand-excavated 1 x 1-m units generally extending to either 50 or 60 cm bs, the
general depth in which Caddo features were expected to be identified below the 40 cm
thick archeological deposits on the southern knoll. Unit excavations focused on recovering
archeological materials in controlled contexts and exposing and documenting features
in the block, they being primarily exposed in hand excavations and by shovel skimming.
Approximately 78.91 m3 of archeological deposits were removed from the large block
during our investigations.

In the block, the hand excavations were by natural levels in the upper zones (Zones 1-3, see
below), using arbitrary subdivisions of the natural levels where deemed appropriate (Figure
5-8). These arbitrary subdivisions were either by 5-cm, 10-cm, or 20-cm subdivisions,
depending upon the character and thickness of each of these natural zones that comprised
the archeological deposits at the Kitchen Branch site. Each natural zone was traced out
as closely as possible across the block excavations before proceeding to the next zone
or arbitrary level within a zone. When each of these zone/levels within a zone excavation
were completed within a block, especially at the top of Zone 2, during the removal of Zone
2, and at the upper part of Zone 3, they were cleaned with a trowel so that any apparent
features or culturally-stained archeological deposits would be apparent, and information
could be gathered on the likely top elevations or first exposure elevations of such features.
Then, that level in the block excavations was photographed from an overhead or elevated
oblique angle before excavation of the next zone or level began (Figures 5-9 to 5-11).
In those parts of the block excavations where Zone 2 deposits were not present, hand
excavations were in 5 cm and 10 cm levels as employed across the remainder of the
blocks.
Four units (Units 164-167) in the western end of the North block (see Figure 5-8) were
excavated in 5-cm levels from the modern ground surface to 60 cm bs. This was an area
where Zone 2C (an anthropogenically-stained cultural deposit, see below) was wellpreserved. Excavations of these units in 5-cm levels were designed to obtain controlled
and fine-scale data on the vertical distribution of artifacts and features in these deposits
in this part of the North block.

The archeological deposits are found in
four different sandy loam zones (Zones
1â4) overlying a sterile clay B-horizon
subsoil (Zone 5). While artifacts
are present in Zones 1â4, they are
proportionally more abundant in Zone
2 (subdivided into Zones 2C and 2N)
and Zone 3. Representative profiles
of the sediment zones documented
in the excavation blocks are shown in
Figures 5-12â5-15. While intensive
geomorphological investigations were
not part of the data recovery effort, these
artifact-rich deposits were likely buried at
these depths primarily through natural
action (bioturbation, tree fall, etc.) and
historic activity. Zone descriptions are as
follows:
Zone 1: brown (10YR 4/3 and 10YR 5/3)
sandy loam A-horizon; a thin organic
horizon is present at the top of Zone 1;
there is a clear boundary to Zone 2C
or Zone 2N. In some portions of the
North Block, Zone 1 and 2 could not be
differentiated, and thus were identified in
profiles as Zone 1/2. The Zone 1/2 sandy

2C ranges from ca. 5â20
cm thick. The majority of the
cultural features identified
at the Kitchen Branch site
appear to have originated in
either Zone 2C or Zone 2N,
and they extend downwards
into Zone 3 and occasionally
reach as deep as Zone 4.

South Block to as much as 130 cm bs in the central portion of the North block (roughly
corresponding to the knollâs crest) and south of the Middle block (Figure 5-17).

Machine and Hand Scraping
At the conclusion of the data recovery block excavations, approximately 515 m2 of
additional site area surrounding the block was excavated by hand (40.5 m2), or with the
aid of a backhoe (474.5 m2; see Figure 5-1). This work was done to identify and excavate
any cultural features that occurred outside the block excavations (Figure 5-18). The shovel
scraping and machine scraping was done in such a manner so as to carefully remove the
archeological deposits in fairly thin slices to recognize cultural features such as post holes,
pits, or any burial pits. Hand scraping and shovel skimming was done in those areas of the
southern knoll outside of the blocks that were not accessible with the backhoe without
destroying archeological deposits. Exposed features were mapped in plan view and then
excavated in the same manner as the features encountered in the block excavations (see
below); special sediment samples were taken from the features as appropriate.
All portions of the landform that could not be accessed by the backhoe were handscraped and/or shovel-skimmed. These areas were eventually all scraped down to the
clay B-horizon (Zone 5), anywhere from ca. 60 to 120 cm bs across the scraped areas.
When the machine scraping was completed and all exposed features were documented
and excavated, the block excavations and machine-scraped areas were carefully backfilled
using the backhoe.

Features
When possible feature stains were identified in the block excavations or the later hand/
machine-scraping work, they were mapped and drawn in plan view and digitally recorded
using the on-site Total Station (Figure 5-19). Then they were cross-sectioned in profile
to definitively establish if the stain was of cultural origin (based upon its regular shape in
profile and the distinguishing character of its fill). At that point, the feature was assigned
a feature number and the feature profile was drawn. If the features had visible charcoal
flecking and/or bone flecks in the fill, then the entire feature fill was collected for flotation
processing, using any feature fill zones or strata to guide the sample collection. If a feature
was large and was estimated to contain more than 100 liters of sediments, only 100 liters
was collected for flotation samples, while the remainder of the feature fill was collected
for fine screening to recover charred plant materials, animal bones, and material culture
remains. In the case of post holes of prehistoric age, the matrix was generally screened
through Â¼-inch mesh, unless there were visible charcoal or bone flecks in the fill.

The Identification, Definition, and
Description of the Cultural Features
from the Kitchen Branch Site
Timothy K. Perttula and Bo Nelson

Introduction
It is well-recognized that feature identification in sandy sediments at East Texas Caddo
archeological sites can be challenging. Such proved to be the case at the Kitchen Branch
site. The combination of varying thicknesses of sandy sediments, only moderate differences
in the color of Zone 2 and 3 sedimentsâthus not offering much in the way of color contrasts
in identifying feature anomaliesâabundant roots, root casts, krotovina, and other natural
disturbances, all contributed to the in-field challenges that existed in the identification
and documentation of cultural featuresâespecially post holesâat the site. Nevertheless,
despite the challenges faced during the data recovery work, numerous cultural features
were identified, and their character and distribution, together with an associated artifact
assemblage, are a testimony to the existence of ancestral Caddo habitation remains at
the Kitchen Branch site. This chapter will discuss the cultural features from the site, and
provide our interpretation of what they represent in an archeological and cultural sense.

Feature Identification
The features identified at the Kitchen Branch site were primarily first identified near the
base of Zone 2C or 2N, and they extended into Zones 3 and 4. However, in some cases,
features were not initially identified until Zone 3 or Zone 4 were reached in the excavations.
When possible feature stains were identified in the block excavations or the later hand/
machine-scraping work through a combination of troweling and shovel skimming, they
were mapped, marked with a pin flag, and drawn in plan view on 1 x 1-m level forms at
the elevations they were first encountered (Figure 6-1). The term âpossible feature stainsâ
did not carry a presumption that all mapped stains were features, but simply that the
stainsâespecially post hole-sized stainsâhad the requisite shape and color to warrant
investigation to determine whether they were indeed of cultural and archeological origin,
and not a product of natural disturbances. To do this, each of the marked stains were
cross-sectioned in profile to definitively establish if the stain was of cultural origin (based
upon its shape in profile, especially its side and basal shape, and the character of its fill). At
that point, the feature was assigned a feature number and the feature profile was drawn.
No feature numbers were assigned to marked stains that were determined to be of noncultural origin.

Many long hours of cross-sectioning, troweling, and profile scrutiny by the field crew took
place, and many of the flagged âpossible feature stainsâ were determined to be natural
stains and disturbances (see Figure 6-1), and thus accorded no future attention. In the
text that follows in this chapter, only the physical stains in the archeological deposits at the
Kitchen Branch site that have been identified as cultural in shape, size, and nature of the
fill are discussed as features that warrant further attention.
When features had visible charcoal flecking and/or bone flecks in the fill, then the entire
feature fill was collected for flotation processing, using any feature fill zones or strata to
guide the sample collection. If a feature was large and was estimated to contain more
than 100 liters of sediments, only 100 liters was collected for flotation samples, while
the remainder of the feature fill was collected for fine screening to recover charred plant
materials, animal bones, and material culture remains. In the case of post holes of
prehistoric age, the matrix was generally screened through Â¼-inch mesh, unless there
were visible charcoal or bone flecks in the fill.

Types of Features
Several different types of
features have been defined
in the archeological deposits
at the Kitchen Branch site.
These include post holes,
possible post holes, small
and large pits, and one firecracked rock concentration.
Including possible post
holes, a total of 243
prehistoric cultural features
were
documented
and
excavated during the course
of the data recovery work
at the Kitchen Branch
site, including portions
of Features 1 and 2 from
the 2005 test excavations
(Perttula et al. 2007). This is
in addition to Features 3â5
and 7â8 totally excavated
during the 2005 work
(Perttula et al. 2005) on the
southern knoll (Figures 6-2
through 6-4).

Post holes

Figure 6-2. Distribution of all identified
features at the Kitchen Branch site.

One hundred and ninetyseven of the features have
been interpreted as post holes associated with a wooden (and probably grass-thatched)
Caddo structure or structures (Figure 6-5). Approximately 90 percent of the post hole
features were recognized between 35â51 cm bs as their top elevation (Figure 6-6a),
although their actual point of origin could not be determined (their origin was almost
assuredly in or immediately below Zone 2). Only 12 post hole features were first recognized
between 20â33 cm bs, and nine post hole features were only first recognized between
55â60 cm bs (well below Zone 2). Most of these were in the area of the South Block or
north and west of the main part of the North Block (Figure 6-6b), where they probably had
been more deeply buried from an unknown amount of slope wash off of the crest of the
southern knoll. The features recognized between 20â33 cm bs appear to have originated
in or immediately below the Zone 2 deposits, and may mark the approximate bottom
depth of the cultural occupation surface on the knoll at the Kitchen Branch site, though

this was no way apparent during the
excavations themselves. We suspect
that bioturbation processes have
obscured the top portions of most of
the post holes, and these post holes
did not become apparent until Zone 3
yellowish-brown sandy loam sediments
were reached in the excavations.
Plotting the distribution of the post
holes with top elevations between
35-51 cm bs (see Figure 6-4b) and
bottom elevations between 44â59
cm bs (see Figure 6-6d) best resolve
the location, size, and shape of the
ancestral Caddo structure in the North
block (see below). Other post holes
occur in extra-mural contexts primarily
south of the structure itself.
The bottom depth of post holes indicate
that 86 percent bottomed out between
44â59 cm bs (see Figure 6-6câd), with
the base of the remainder of the post
holes reached at either 36â43 cm (6
percent) or 60â72 cm bs (8 percent)
(see Figure 6-4c). If the top elevation
depths of 20â33 cm can serve as an
approximation for the likely origin of
Figure 6-5. Distribution of post holes in the
the majority of post holes, then the
excavations at the Kitchen Branch site.
bottom depth of most of the post holes
at 44â59 cm bs suggests that the post
holes were placed in holes between ca. 24â26 cm in depth from their origination, although
some were more shallowly set and others were set ca. 39â40 cm in depth. None of the
post holes were set into the Zone 5 clay horizon.
The many likely post holes in the block excavations (as well as those documented from
the scraping areas) suggest the construction of domestic Caddo structures and possible
ancillary and special purpose features (i.e. ramadas, granaries, or arbors) using wood
posts (Figures 6-7 and 6-8). Post holes were relatively uniform in size, generally ranging
between 15â20 cm in diameter (Figure 6-9), except for the several post holes identified
as roof supports, which tend to be slightly larger (ca. 24â25 cm in diameter) than the wall
posts and extend deeper into the sediments than do wall posts. More than 76 percent of
the identified post holes range between 15â20 cm in diameter.

Our interpretation of the post hole patterning in the block excavations is as follows: The
North Block has at least one apparently circular Late Caddo, Titus phase, structure about
6.0 m in diameter with a possible entrance (based on gaps in the post holes along the
walls) facing either southeast or southwest (Figure 6-16; see also Figure 6-6b, d). Several
larger posts (Features 2, 5, 53, and 142) may represent roof and wall support posts within
the structure itself. The number of post holes in the North Block suggests that the structure
may have been rebuilt and/or that a number of the posts had to be replaced. Additionally,
many of the additional post hole features within the structure itself are likely attributed to
internal post structural features or furniture such as racks, screens, and benches.
The estimated floor area is 28 m2. Based on different estimates of the size of a household
population (e.g., Casselberry 1974; Cook 1972; Smith 1978), a residential structure of this
size was probably the home to a nuclear family of four or five individuals.

Chapter 6

Figure 6-16. Post hole pattern for the Late
Caddo structure in the North block.

Many of the wall and interior
posts associated with the
structure in the North block have
a dark yellowish-brown sandy fill.
However, a significant number
of posts associated with the
structureâand with a number of
posts in extra-mural contextsâ
have a darker fill (ranging from
dark brown, very dark brown,
black, and brown (Figure
6-17a-d), indicating that higher
amounts of organically-stained
deposits have been incorporated
in the fill of numerous post
holes. That many of these post
holes with darker fill occur in
interior posts and support posts
suggests that the source of
these organic materials is likely
to have been activities that took
place inside the structure, such
as the generation of charcoal
and ash from cooking and
heating, hearth clean-up, and
charcoal-stained
sediments
from smudge pits.

Posts in extra-mural contexts with darker fill sediments are confined primarily to facilities
in the North block, in proximity to the Caddo structure, or in area just west of the Central
block (see Figure 6-17a, c). These were areas where significant amounts of organicallystained sediments accumulated from site use. Of the post holes with brown fill, 52 percent
are associated with either the wall, interior posts, or support posts to the structure, while
the remaining 48 percent occur in extra-mural contexts widely dispersed across the block
excavations (see Figure 6-17b, d). Post holes with dark brown, very dark brown, or black
feature fills have approximately the same spatial distribution: 54 percent are associated
with either wall, interior, or support posts, and the remainder are in extra-mural contexts.
The virtual absence of preserved pieces of daub or frothed silica suggests that the structure
was probably thatch-covered, and was either not covered with wattle and daub, or that the
structure was not deliberately burned down and buried, which would have preserved the
daub or created silica froth. There are daub-covered Titus phase structures known in this
part of the Big Cypress Creek drainage, but they tend to be structures on, or covered by,
mounds (Figure 6-18), see also Perttula 2012). It is noteworthy that these structures at

the Harroun (41UR10) and Dalton (41UR11) sites have entrances that open to the west
and southwest, as might the Kitchen Branch structure. Structures 1 and 4 at the Ear Spool
site (41TT653) also open to the southwest and west (Perttula and Sherman 2009:Figures
7-1 and 7-4).
There are several possible ancillary structural features in the North, Middle, and South
blocks (see Figure 6-5). South of the apparent main structure in the North block, three
roughly rectangular post hole patterns (measuring 2 x 2.5 m, 1 x 2 m, and 2.5 x 2 m)
are interpreted as elevated work platforms or ramadas. The first of these is represented
by a cluster of 19 post holes immediately south of the house structure. Two pit features
(Features 102 and 122) are associated with this ancillary feature. The second possible
ancillary feature, to the immediate southwest of the house structure, and about two meters
to the west of the aforementioned ancillary feature, includes eight post holes; two small
pit features (Features 19 and 176) may be associated. The third rectangular area of post
holes is about 1 m south of the first, and includes nine post holes (see Figure 6-5). Kelley
(1997:32 and Figure 15) identified a similar set of post holes (2 x 3 m in area) as a ramada
at the contemporaneous McLelland site (16BO236) along the Red River in northwestern
Louisiana.
There are also two other possible ancillary features in the Middle block that are marked
by single rows of a few post holes: Features 13, 55, 58, and 85 about 2 m south of the
southernmost rectangular ancillary feature, and Features 11, 37, 39, 40, and 41 ca. 3 m
to the south of the first row of post holes (see Figure 6-5). These post hole rows are about
2-3 m in length, and may represent screens or racks in outdoor work areas.
Finally, there is a circular concentration of post holes in the South block that is ca. 3 m in
diameter, and is marked by 11 post holes (Features 17, 21, 22, 25, 27, 29, 31, 135, and
Possible post holes 12 and 13 and two pit features (Features 23 and 28). Their distance
from the domestic structures, and the small size of the post hole concentration, suggests
that these post hole features may mark an elevated or above-ground granary. At the Oak
Hill Village site (41RK214) in Rusk County, Texas, possible above-ground granaries about
1.6â3.0 m in diameterâmarked by widely-spaced post holes forming a circle without an
obvious entranceâwere identified in the ca. AD 1350â1450 Caddo occupation (Perttula
and Rogers 2007:78 and Figure 4d). This possible elevated granary feature is ca. 5-10 m
east and southeast of a concentration of large pit features (Features 209, 219, and 236)
that may have been below-ground storage features.

Possible Post Holes
There are 15 possible post holes identified in the Kitchen Branch site excavations (Figure
6-19). These are stains that either by size or shape cannot confidently be identified as post
holes, although this is the most likely interpretation. Several of the possible post holes were
only incompletely defined during the test excavations (Perttula et al. 2005), being visible

primarily only in profile. Subsequent
data recovery excavations were not
able to confirm their status as post
holes.
Four of the possible post holes
occur in the immediate area of the
identified Caddo structure (Possible
post holes 6 and 10, Feature 162,
and Feature 198) (see Figure
6-19). The other 11 possible post
holes are widely distributed across
the block excavations, with no
particular spatial concentration or
spatial patterning.
These possible post holes were
detected at shallower depths than
the larger sample of post holes
that likely represent wall supports.
Almost 47 percent of the possible
post holes had top elevations
between 17-33 cm bs, compared to
only 6 percent of the post holes (see
Figure 6-6). Similarly, approximately
47 percent of the possible post holes
had top elevations between 38-50
cm bs, compared to 90 percent of
the post holes. The bottom elevation

holes, as 21 percent had bottom
elevations between 30-42 cm bs;
only 6 percent of the post holes had
bottom depths that shallow. Another 64 percent of the possible post holes had bottom
elevations between 44-59 cm bs compared to 86 percent of the identified post holes. These
differences in top and bottom elevations suggest that the possible post holes represent
posts of various sizes, mainly in extra-mural contexts, that were set in shallow post holes.
These may represent posts used in screens and racks set up in primarily outdoor activity
areas.
Possible Post Hole 1 (Unit 14) is a 26-cm diameter stain with a mottled dark brown and dark
grayish-brown fill. The stain extends from 33â46 cm bs, with sloping sides and rounded

Pit features
There are 30 pit features identified and excavated at the Kitchen Branch site. They
are divided into small (<40 cm in diameter, n=21; see feature descriptions for formal
dimensions) and large (>40 cm in diameter, n=9; see feature descriptions below for formal
dimensions). The distribution of the pit features is shown in Figure 6-21.

The small pits probably
represent the locus of
activities by the Caddo
that took place outside,
including several smudge
pits (for the generation of
smoke, either for smudging
hides
or
controlling
insects) and pits probably
used for cooking. One of
the small pits is inside the
Caddo house structure,
while the remainder occur
in
extra-mural/outdoor
activity areas south and
west of the structure
itself (see Figure 6-21).
Top elevations for the
small pits ranged from
26â60 cm bs, except for

Two of the three large pit features (Features 209, 219, and 236) situated in the area south
of the Middle block and west of the South block were originally encountered in the 2005
test excavationsâalthough they were interpreted at the time as natural features or gullies
(Perttula et al. 2005:24â25 and Figures 9â10) rather than cultural features (Features
209 and 219). However, hand scraping during data recovery allowed a clearer plan view of
each anomaly. They were found to be distinct pits rather than parts of a linear gully feature.
These large pit features are more than 150 cm in diameter and were excavated to depths
greater than 1.0 m bs, approaching or extending slightly into the Zone 5 clay.
Except for Feature 209, these large pit features contained a very small complement of
artifacts, or at least no notable concentrations or distinct zones comprised of densely
packed archeological materials. It is suspected that these large pit features probably were
used for storage, and then gradually became filled in with sediments and an occasional
load of trash discarded by the Late Caddo occupants of the site. Since these pits are
large enough to have held a yearâs worth or more of plant foods like maize for one family
(cf. Schroeder 1999), namely between 26 and 40 bushels of corn or other storable plant
foods, the occurrence of three pits suggests they may have been used by more than one
family living at the site, or that the pits were serially used and then filled in by one family
over the course of an occupation that may have lasted one or two generations. The fact
that storage took place in extramural pits, rather than in less accessible elevated granaries
or in pits located within the confines of a structure, may have implications for the social
place of the household within the larger community (cf. Hendon 2000), as well as for
possible temporal changes in the use of below-ground or above-ground storage facilities
(i.e. Perttula and Sherman 2009:113).
The smaller and shallower pit features, including possible smudge pits (Features 4, 10,
122, and 227), tend to occur in the area of the domestic structure, either inside the
structure itself (Feature 4), or in the vicinity of ancillary features in the North and Central
blocks. These have sloping sides and rounded to flat bottoms, with darker sediments than
the surrounding matrix (usually Zone 3 or Zone 4). Their function has not been established
with certainty, but they may have been used for food preparation and cooking, as smudge
pits (their purpose of which was to produce smoke to keep insects and pests away), for
hide smoking (although it is unlikely that this activity took place inside a structure, Skibo
and Schiffer [2008:58â66]). The materials burned in the smudge pits were consumed
in âan oxygen-starved environment. As a result, the materials were uniformly carbonized
rather than reduced to ashâ (Trinkley 1995:126). The remainder of the small pits occur in
extra-mural contexts, where they may have been used for cooking activities, nut meal or oil
processing, small-scale storage, refuse disposal, or some combination of these different
functions.

Fire-cracked
Rock Feature
There is one feature north
of the Caddo domestic
structure that consists
of a small pile of firecracked rock (Figure
6-35). Feature 180 (Unit
43) is a concentration of
10 burned ferruginous
sandstone rocks (0.7
kg) in a single layer (or
possibly at the bottom
of an undetected pit?)
that covers a 24 x 27 cm
area (Figure A5-2.13).
Top elevations of the

rocks range from 56â60
cm bs, while the bottom
elevations range from
60â64 cm. The burned rocks range from 4â9 cm in length, 2â6 cm in width, and 2â4 cm
in thickness. Contents: one lithic fragment; 0.01 g of wood charcoal; 0.01 g of nutshell.
These rocks were lying between 56â64 cm bs in Zone 3 or 4 sediments, below later
prehistoric Caddo occupational deposits. As there was no evidence of a pit, it is
possible that these rocks were discarded well before the deposition of the Late Caddo
archaeological materials or the development of the Zone 2 sediments, possibly in Late
Archaic or Woodland period times. It is also
possible that evidence of a pit in which the fireTable 6-1. Small Fire-cracked Rock

Although not defined as features in this report, there are eight small clusters (>3 rocks) of
fire-cracked rock recorded on the level forms in the archaeological deposits (Table 6-1).
These may represent the discard of hot rocks from one or more cooking features. Seventyfive percent of these small fire-cracked rock clusters occur between 42â67 cm bs (bottom
elevation depths)âin Woodland and/or Archaic depositsâwhile the other two clusters are
found from 26â33 cm bs and 33â38 cm bs.

Feature Artifact Content
The features from the Kitchen Branch site contain a variety of archaeological materials,
particularly lithic artifacts (primarily lithic fragments), ceramic sherds, charred plant
remains, and burned clay/daub (Table 6-2). Proportionally, the pit features, including the

smudge pits, tend to have more artifactsâand a more diverse range of different classes
of artifacts (especially bone and charred plant remains)âthan do the post hole or small
pit feature types. The small pit feature type ranks second behind large pit features in the
relative occurrence of archeological materials, especially the proportion of sherds and
charred plant remains. The features with the highest proportion of charred plant remains
and animal bone are the large pits. These pit features obviously contain more discarded
trash, especially the remains of plant and animal foods. Fire-cracked rocks are most
common in the pit features and the one fire-cracked rock concentration.
Overall, the fact that nearly 30 percent of the features contain Caddo pottery sherds (see
Table 6-2) certainly suggests that the majority of the features identified and excavated at
the Kitchen Branch site are associated with the Caddo use of the site. This in turn suggests
that the majority of the recovered animal bone and plant remains recovered from features
(especially the pit features) are also associated with Caddo site use.

Summary and Conclusions
The more than 240 cultural features identified in the sandy sediments at the Kitchen
Branch site during the test excavations and the data recovery work are the product of a
relatively intensive Caddo occupation. Although feature identification was a considerable
challenge because of the thick sandy sediments, extensive shovel skimming, troweling,
and cross-sectioning under various weather conditions of all soil stains that differed from
the surrounding soil in color and/or texture led to the documentation of almost 200 post
hole features, 15 possible post holes, 30 small and large pits, and a single fire-cracked
rock concentration.
The contents of the features, as well as their spatial arrangement, suggest that the
vast majority of them can be associated with an ancestral Caddo occupation, one that
apparently took place in the early to late 15th century AD. However, the radiocarbon dates
from charred plant remains recovered in features tell a more complicated story of the
occupational history of the Kitchen Branch site. At first glance, they call into question the
argument that much of the archeological record here can be associated with this particular
ancestral Caddo component. The next chapter of this report takes up the chronological
issues regarding the presumed age of the cultural features, and the occupational history
of the site.

Radiocarbon and TL Dates from
the Kitchen Branch Site
Timothy K. Perttula, Robert Z. Selden, Jr., and James Feathers

Introduction
This chapter presents the results of the radiocarbon dating of charred organic remains and
the dating of bulk organics in the paste of ceramic sherds, as well as the thermoluminescence
(TL) dating of 20 decorated ceramic sherds from the Kitchen Branch site. Several of the
sherds selected for bulk dating of organics were split so that samples have also been
submitted for TL dating, thus obtaining radiocarbon and TL cross-referenced dates.

Radiocarbon Dates
There are 31 radiocarbon dates available from the Kitchen Branch site, four obtained
from features and archeological deposits identified during the test excavations (Perttula
et al. 2005; see also Perttula and Selden 2011) and 27 additional dates from contexts
encountered in the data recovery work (Appendix 7-1aâc). These dates from one site
constitute one of the largest samples of radiocarbon assays obtained from any one East
Texas site, as the East Texas Radiocarbon Database (Perttula and Selden 2011) indicates
that only five sites in the region besides the Kitchen Branch site have as many as 31 dates
(Selden and Perttula 2012), namely: George C. Davis (41CE19, Story 1997, 1998; Story
and Valastro 1977), Pine Tree Mound (41HS15, Fields and Gadus 2012), Oak Hill Village
(41RK214, Rogers and Perttula 2004), George E. Richey (41TT851, Hatfield et al. 2008),
and William A. Ford (41TT852, Hatfield et al. 2008).
The 31 radiocarbon dates from the site include three samples of charred maize from
three different features; 16 samples of charred hickory nutshell from 14 features and two
subsurface nutshell concentrations (70 and 80 cm bs); one sample of charred hickory
wood charcoal from one feature; and 11 dates on the bulk organics in the paste of 11
different decorated ceramic sherds (Table 7-1). One of these sherds is from near a feature
(Feature 236), while the other 10 are from general habitation contexts (0â50 cm bs) in the
archeological deposits.
For this discussion and because of the development of the East Texas Radiocarbon
Database employing OxCal, the 31 radiocarbon dates from the Kitchen Branch site have
also been calibrated in version 4.1.7 of OxCal (Bronk Ramsey 2012) using IntCal09 (Reimer
et al. 2009). Summed probability distributions of radiocarbon group clusters were also
produced using OxCal.

Radiocarbon Group Clusters at the Kitchen Branch Site
There are several different groups and/or clusters of radiocarbon dates from the Kitchen
Branch site (Table 7-2). These include the following 12 groups, as indicated by similar
median calibrated ages and 2 sigma age ranges with probabilities greater than 80 percent
(either singly or as a sum, see Table 7-2):
â¢ Median calibrated age: 3153 BC (3339â3008 BC age range)
â¢ Median calibrated age: 1482 BC (1536â1421 BC age range)
â¢ Median calibrated age: 812 BC (896â773 BC age range)
â¢ Median calibrated age: AD 167 (AD 85â235 age range)
â¢ Median calibrated age: AD 300 (AD 234â389 age range); AD 389 (AD 321â436); AD
447 (AD 382â539 age range)
â¢ Median calibrated age: AD 561 (AD 435â491 and AD 529â623); AD 618 (AD 566â655
age range); AD 623 (AD 574â657 age range)
â¢ Median calibrated age: AD 724 (AD 661â780 age range); AD 789 (AD 689â882 age
range)
â¢ Median calibrated age: AD 933 (AD 862â994 age range); AD 939 (AD 880â1014 age
range); AD 964 (AD 894â1018 age range)
â¢ Median calibrated age: AD 1076 (AD 993â1155 age range); AD 1108 (AD 1034â1189
age range)
â¢ Median calibrated age: AD 1225 (AD 1166â1267 age range); AD 1265 (AD 1221â
1287 age range); AD 1287 (AD 1261â1310 age range)
â¢ Median calibrated age: AD 1347 (AD 1297â1409 age range); AD 1347 (AD 1297â
1409 age range); AD 1348 (AD 1295â1404 age range); AD 1348 (AD 1300â1419 age
range); AD 1396 (AD 1310â1435 age range)
â¢ Median calibrated age: AD 1435 (AD 1396â1489 age range); AD 1435 (AD 1409â
1457 age range); AD 1435 (AD 1409â1457 age range); AD 1460 (AD 1413â1522
age range); AD 1468 (AD 1430â1522 age range); AD 1488 (AD 1441â1524 and AD
1571â1631 age ranges)
Only two of the groups are represented by more than three calibrated radiocarbon dates,
the AD 1347â1396 (n=5 dates, with age ranges that extend from AD 1297â1435) and
AD 1435â1488 groups (n=6 dates, with age ranges that extend from AD 1396â1524)
(based on the range of median calibrated dates and overlapping age ranges). These two
groups of calibrated dates may represent the best approximation for the age range of the
principal ancestral Caddo component at the Kitchen Branch site, although the analysis
of the stylistic elements on the recovered ceramic sherds (see Chapter 8, this volume)
strongly suggests that the AD 1435â1488 age range based on calibrated median dates is
most consistent with the range of ceramic decorations.

Evaluation of the Radiocarbon Dates and Group Clusters
The range of calibrated median dates and their age ranges would seem to indicate that the
Kitchen Branch site has been episodically used by American Indian groups from at least as
early as 3339 BC (in the Middle Archaic) to as late as the early to mid-16th century AD (in
the Titus phase). The recovered temporally diagnostic dart points and arrow points from
the site (see Chapter 11, this volume) appear to corroborate this long-term and episodic
use, while the recovered ceramic artifacts appear to pertain to the very latter periods of
use. However, the range of dates of different materials from features with Caddo ceramics,1
especially Late Caddo ceramic styles, and the range of dates on bulk ceramic sherd
pastes from sherds of clear post-AD 800 Caddo affiliation as well as Late Caddo affiliation
(Figures 7-1 and 7-2) suggest that some analytical hygiene is in order in reconstructing
the temporal relationships of features and associated material culture remains from the
Kitchen Branch site (i.e. an assessment of the reliability of the dates, see [Rieth and Hunt
2008:1905-1906; Nolan 2012:185]).
The three calibrated radiocarbon dates on maize from features are internally consistent
and tightly clustered temporally (see Figure 7-1 and Table 7-2), with median calibrated
ages of AD 1435 and AD 1488, and calibrated two sigma age ranges of AD 1396â1489
(0.94 probability), AD 1409â1457 (0.95), and AD 1441â1524 (0.69). The 15th century
age of the maize from the Kitchen Branch site is consistent with the recovered Caddo
ceramics found in the features as well as associated deposits (see Chapter 5, this volume)
and with the known intensification of maize use in East Texas Caddo diets after ca. AD
1300 (see Wilson 2012; Wilson and Perttula 2013).
Radiocarbon dates from features with charred hickory nutshells and hickory wood charcoal
ranges from as early as 1482 BC (median calibrated date, with an 1536â1421 BC age
range [0.93]) to as late as AD 1468 (AD 1430â1522 age range [0.83]) (see Figure 7-1 and
Table 7-2). Of the 15 dates on nutshell and wood charcoal from features, 12 of the features
have post-AD 800/850 Caddo ceramics in their fill, indicating that they cannot date any
earlier than that time. Five of the nutshell/wood charcoal dates from features with Caddo
ceramics (including Caddo ceramics that are considered to be of Late Caddo age) have
calibrated median dates and age ranges that well predate ca. AD 800/850 (Features 10,
19, 63, 215, and 236), and must be excluded as inaccurate as far as their association
with a Caddo occupational episode. The dated features may contain old carbon that was
exhumed and then reintroduced as packing sediments. The calibrated date on nutshell
from Feature 12 (median date of AD 939 and age range of AD 880â1014 [0.95]) is also
chronologically suspect given the maize median calibrated age of AD 1488 (age range,
AD 1441â1524 [0.69]) from the same feature deposits. Furthermore, Features 102 and
227, with median age ranges on nutshell of AD 964 (AD 935â1018 age range [0.69])
and AD 1225 (AD 1166â1267 age range [0.95]) may also be excluded as chronologically
inaccurate because both features contain brushed Caddo pottery, which is present in
radiocarbon-dated Big Cypress Creek basin Caddo sites only after AD 1280 (Perttula and
1
It is possible that in some cases, the Caddo ceramic sherds are intrusive in Archaic or Woodland
period features, although no temporal diagnostics of these periods were found in features.

Ellis 2012:Table 8-24). In sum, eight of the 15 radiocarbon dates of nutshell and hickory
wood charcoal from features can be confidently excluded as unreliable for establishing
the chronological age of the Caddo occupation(s) at the Kitchen Branch site. Those that
cannot be excluded on the basis of temporal comparisons and feature material culture
associations have median calibrated ages that postdate AD 1287 (see Table 7-2).
Two other hickory nutshells come from non-feature contexts deep in the archeological
deposits (70â80 cm bs) at the site. The median calibrated ages of these nutshells are
812 BC and 3153 BC, with age ranges of 896â773 BC (0.95) and 3339â3008 BC (0.89
probability at 2 sigma), respectively. There is no reason to think that these dates are not
accurate, based on the recovery of abundant Late Archaic dart points and several Middle
Archaic dart points from the Kitchen Branch site. In this case, they testify to episodic use
by Middle and Late Archaic hunter-gatherers of this alluvial landform in the Prairie Creek
valley.
There are significant issues of chronological reliability regarding the radiocarbon dating of
bulk ceramic sherd pastes from 11 sherds recovered in the archeological deposits at the
Kitchen Branch site. The calibrated results (see Table 7-2 and Figure 7-2) indicate that the
calibrated median ages on these directly dated sherds range from AD 623â1435, a period
of more than 800 years, with age ranges from as early as AD 574â657 (0.95) to as late as
AD 1409â1457 (0.95), a period of almost 900 years.
The sherds that were selected for C14 dates have recognizable post-AD 800/850 East
Texas ceramic decorative styles. Thus, two of the dates (Beta-322674 and Beta-322670)
on Caddo engraved fine ware sherds from the site can be rejected out of hand as not
accurate because the median calibrated ages on these sherds (AD 623 and AD 724)
predate the accepted age of engraved Caddo ceramics by at least 100â200 years (see
Story 2000), if not more (see Figure 7-2). Furthermore, the decorated ceramic sherds
that were dated by radiocarbon analysis have stylistic and decorative elements that have
been generally accepted through years of detailed ceramic analysis and cross-dating of
ceramics from a wide range of sites as occurring on post-AD 1250 Caddo sites in East
Texas, and they are not found in earlier pre-AD 1250 contexts. If this contention holds
any weight for chronological purposes, then several other bulk ceramic sherd paste dates
from the Kitchen Branch site can be evaluated as chronologically unacceptable, including
dates on sherds with median calibrated ages of AD 933, AD 1076, and AD 1108 (see
Table 7-2). This means that five of the 11 bulk ceramic sherd paste dates from the site
are inaccurateâ45 percentâcompared to 53 percent of the calibrated dates on hickory
nutshell. The calibrated radiocarbon dates from bulk ceramic sherd pastes that cannot
be excluded on the basis of temporal comparisons and ceramic style associations have
median calibrated ages that postdate AD 1265 (see Table 7-2), and the median calibrated
ages range from AD 1265â1435.
This discussion indicates that the generally acceptable (i.e., that cannot be excluded on
several criteria) calibrated median radiocarbon dates from the Kitchen Branch site range

from 3153 BC and 812 BC for Archaic material remains encountered in the deeper part of
the archeological deposits to ancestral Caddo features and sherds that have median dates
of AD 1435â1488 (maize), postdate AD 1287 (hickory nutshell and wood charcoal), and
postdate AD 1265 (bulk ceramic sherd pastes). We will return to a consideration of the likely
age or ages of the primary Caddo component(s) at the site following: (1) a consideration
of the East Texas Radiocarbon Database, and the contemporaneity of other sites in the
vicinity of the Kitchen Branch site, and (2) an evaluation of the thermoluminescence
dates on 20 decorated Caddo ceramic sherds, 11 of which have radiocarbon dates (see
Feathers, below).

Archeological Contemporaneity of East Texas Sites and the Kitchen Branch Site Using
the East Texas Radiocarbon Database
Through a variety of academic, avocational, and cultural resource management pursuits,
the East Texas Radiocarbon Database (ETRD) as it currently stands (Perttula and Selden
2011) consists of 74 14C dates that predate 500 BC from 34 sites, 127 14C dates from 51
sites that range from ca. 500 BC to AD 800, and 893 14C dates that range from ca. AD
800â1680 from 150 Caddo sites across East Texas. The bulk of these dates were collected
with the intention of exploring locally-based research questions and they are employed
here within a discussion of possible contemporaneity between sites, using a descriptive
analysis of the results from date combination, summed probability distributions, and
statistics (see Bernard 2006).
The ETRD represents a sizeable sample of dates produced within a relatively small
geographic region. The temporal and spatial distributions of calibrated radiocarbon ages
are useful in exploring the development and geographic continuity of cultures that lived in
the region, leading to an improved comprehension of the existing chronological framework.
From these data, it is possible to establish temporal associations that correlateâpotentiallyâ
with such events as site abandonment, decreases or increases in local populations, and
an intensification of landscape use.
Through the use of median dates produced via OxCal as a proxy (see Selden 2012),
archeological components with median ages of Â± 100 cal. 14C years were identified in the
ETRD) and plotted using ArcGIS10. Radiocarbon dates were synthesized, then recalibrated
with OxCal 4.1.7 (Bronk Ramsey 2012) using IntCal09. The completed database was
analyzed using a variety of statistical processes (histograms, bar plots, box plots, kernel
density, and hierarchical cluster analysis) within version 2.14.1 of R, and summed
probability distributions (SPD) were produced using version OxCal. Statistical calculations
were made using negative numbers to represent BC and positive numbers to represent AD
(Sirkin 2006).
Radiocarbon determinations judged to be contemporary with Beta-204253 (median age
3153 BC) from the Kitchen Branch site include a date from the Finley Fan site (41HP159)
(GX-15878) and a date from 41UR77 (UGA-12977) (Table 7-3). Both sites are over 25 miles

from Kitchen Branch, the closest being 41UR77âaround 27 miles to the southwestâthen
Finley Fan, around 55 miles west-northwest. These sites are located near major streams
(the Sabine River and south Sulphur River) in the region (Figures 7-3 and 7-4).

All radiocarbon determinations judged to be contemporary with Beta-319978 from the
Kitchen Branch site come from the Late Archaic period and include three dates from
41UR77 (UGA-12981, UGA-12892, UGA-12980), another from the J. Simms site (41NA290)
(Beta-151114), one from 41RK268 (Beta-239707), and another from the Herman Ballew
site (41RK222) (Beta-72779) (Table 7-4; see Figure 7-4); the latter are farther removed
from Kitchen Branch.
Radiocarbon determinations judged to be contemporary with Beta-204252 from Kitchen
Branch are of Late Archaic period age (Table 7-5). They include two dates from the Weaver
Creek site (41BW692) (UGA-13423, UGA13421) in the Sulphur River basin, two dates from
the Winston site (SMU-657, SMU-656) on the Trinity River, one date from the Hidden Barn
site (41NA240) (Beta-151100) in the Attoyac Bayou basin, and several others, including
one date from 41DT59 (Beta-81670), one from the William A. Ford site (41TT852), one
from 41HE139 (UGA-12889), one from the Mockingbird site (41TT550) (Beta-70992), and
one from 41UR77 (UGA-12974).
There are a number of sites with Woodland period dates in East Texas (Figure 7-5) that are
contemporaneous with the apparent Woodland period dates from the Kitchen Branch site
(Figure 7-6). Summed probability distributions for the Kitchen Branch dates have several
apparent temporal peaks, primarily at ca. AD 400 and in the early 7th century AD.

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

Among the many important Woodland era sites that have contemporaneous dated
occupations include several midden sites on the south Sulphur River at Cooper Reservoir
(Fields et al. 1997), as well as the Hurricane Hill site (41HP106, Perttula 1999), the Herman
Ballew site (41RK222) in the Sabine River basin (Rogers et al. 2001), and the Broadway
site (41SM273) in the Angelina River basin (Perttula and Nelson 2004) (Tables 7-6 and
7-7). Although not included in the tables, recently obtained dates from the Hawkwind site
(41HS915) span much of the Woodland era (Ellis et al. 2012). Woodland components with
a few radiocarbon dates in proximity to the Kitchen Branch site (see Figure 7-5) include
sites in both the Big and Little Cypress Creek basins (41CP245, 41CP408, 41TT372,
41TT409, and 41TT847), but the Woodland occupations are not substantial.
There are many ancestral Caddo sites (dating from ca. AD 800/850-1680) with radiocarbon
dates in East Texas, as previously mentioned, including at least 20 sites within 25 miles
of the Kitchen Branch site (Figure 7-7). Most of these Caddo sites have dated Middle and
Late Caddo components, and are contemporaneous with the post-AD 1265 calibrated
dates from the Kitchen Branch site that cannot be excluded as inaccurate in the entire
corpus of radiocarbon dates from the site (see above). There are a number of dates with
summed probability distributions from the Kitchen Branch site that have ranges that are
earlier than median calibrated dates of AD 1265 (Figure 7-8).
There are only a few East Texas Caddo sites within 25 miles of the Kitchen Branch site that
have any calibrated radiocarbon dates that fall in the AD 800/850â1000 range, or the
Formative Caddo period (Figure 7-9). These are primarily concentrated in the Tankersley
Creek area of Big Cypress Creek basin (Hatfield et al. 2008) and in the Kelsey Creek/Lake
Gilmer area (Parsons 2011) (Table 7-8).
Dated components of probable Early Caddo period age (calibrated median ages that fall in
the AD 1000-1200 interval) in the vicinity of the Kitchen Branch site are more numerous
(Figure 7-10). They are distributed in the Sulphur River basin, the Tankersley Creek
drainage in the Big Cypress Creek basin, and in the Little Cypress Creek basin. The best
dated of the 10 sites is a small habitation area at the Mockingbird site (41TT550) (Table
7-9).
Sites of probable Middle Caddo age (ca. AD 1200â1400) based on radiocarbon dates have
a wider distribution around the Kitchen Branch site than do sites of probable Formative
Caddo and Early Caddo period ages, but they are still concentrated in the Sulphur River
basin, along tributaries flowing south into Big Cypress Creek, and in several areas in the
Little Cypress Creek basin (Figure 7-11). The better dated Middle Caddo components
include the Hickory Hill site (41CP408) in the Little Cypress Creek basin (Perttula and Ellis
2012), 41TT851 and 41TT852 in the Tankersley Creek drainage (Hatfield et al. 2008), and
the Rookery Ridge site (41UR133) on Kelsey Creek (Parsons 2011) in the Little Cypress
Creek basin (Table 7-10). Several of these probable Middle Caddo sites have summed
probability distributions that peak in the 13th century AD (Figure 7-12), and most have

peaks in the 14th century and early part of the 15th century, as do a number of calibrated
dates from the Kitchen Branch site.
Post-AD 1400 dated Caddo components are relatively common within 25 miles of the
Kitchen Branch site (Figure 7-13). This includes sites in the Tankersley Creek drainage,
eastern-flowing tributaries to Big Cypress Creek, including sites such as Sam Roberts
(41CP8) and Johns (41CP12) on Prairie Creek, sites on Big Cypress Creek itself, and
several sites on tributaries to Little Cypress Creek. The local manifestation of the Late
Caddo period is the Titus phase (with calibrated radiocarbon dates ranging from ca.
AD 1430-1680), and the phase is particularly well-dated (see Fields and Gadus 2012;
Perttula 2012) compared to other Caddo phases defined in East Texas. Well-dated Late
Caddo, Titus phase components in the Kitchen Branch site vicinity include the Shelby site
(41CP71), a large village, mound center, and community cemetery (Perttula et al. 2004);
41CP88, a habitation site in the Little Cypress Creek basin (Sherman et al. 2011), the
Pilgrimâs Pride large village, mound center and cemetery (Perttula 2005), the Mockingbird
site cemetery (41TT550, Perttula et al. 1998), the Ear Spool mound center and habitation
site (41TT653, Perttula and Sherman 2009); 41TT852 and 41TT853, habitation sites

*All probabilities rounded to the nearest hundredth.

(Hatfield et al. 2008), Rookery Ridge (41UR133), a mound center and village (Parsons
2011), and Henry Spencer (41UR315), a large cemetery (Perttula et al. 2012) (Table 7-11).
Summed probability distributions for Late Caddo sites within 25 miles of the Kitchen
Branch site suggest that the area was continuously occupied by Caddo peoples to the
late 17th century AD, with slight temporal peaks in the mid-15th century AD and then in
the early 17th century AD (Figure 7-14). The Late Caddo, Titus phase occupation at the
Kitchen Branch site falls almost exclusively in the early part of the Titus phase, as do
components at 41UR118 and 41TT672, but most of the other Titus phase occupations in
the area have broader temporal spans, with calibrated ages that range throughout much
of the 16th and 17th centuries (Figure 7-14). Nearby Prairie Creek Titus phase sitesâSam
Roberts (41CP8) and Johns (41CP12)âdate later, based on calibrated median ages of AD
1567 and AD 1681 from Sam Roberts and AD 1558 from the Johns site (see Table 7-11).
These dates do have broad two-sigma age ranges (AD 1436â1678, AD 1465â1891, and
AD 1461â1635), suggesting that they may have been occupied contemporaneously to
some extent with the Kitchen Branch Late Caddo component.

Concluding Thoughts on Summary Comparisons
With the decreasing cost of attaining accurate 14C determinations from increasingly small
samples, archeologists are becoming increasingly mindful of the research potential that
14C dates can offer (see Kuzmin and Keates 2005; Rick 1987; Steele 2010; Williams
220 AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

2012). This is particularly the case in the recent push toward highlighting fluctuations in
prehistoric demography via analyses of large samples of radiocarbon assays from sites
across a region (Bamforth and Grund 2012; Buchanan et al. 2008; Faught 2008; Hinz
et al. 2012; Peros et al. 2010). Such analyses have yet to be fully completed employing
radiocarbon dates from ancestral Caddo sites, but Selden and Perttula (2013) is a recent
attempt for East Texas.
Advancements in combining the analysis of radiocarbon dates and data from other sourcesâ
stratigraphic (Bronk Ramsey 1995, 2007; Michczynski and Pazdur 2003); development
and recognition of cultural phases (Buck et al. 1991; Ziedler et al. 1998); architecture
(Bayliss et al. 2007; Whittle et al. 2011); paleoenvironmental records (Gearey et al. 2009);
tephrochronology (Buck et al. 2003); specific climatic episodes (Kidder 2006); and even
ceramic data (Buck et al. 1992)âcan provide an integral toolkit for exploring potential
associations between 14C determinations and archeological datasets, providing testable
hypotheses that can be validated or falsified with the addition of more data (Bayliss and
Ramsey 2004). Bayesian models of radiocarbon dating analysis have been employed for
over 15 years in Great Britain (Bayliss 2009; Bronk Ramsey 2008, 2009; Buck et al. 1996),
and are widely employed within cultural resource management endeavors (Bayliss 2009;
Bayliss et al. 2005; Buck et al. 1994) with great success. Within the context of a broaderbased consideration of the Caddo occupation of East Texas, and the place of the Kitchen
Branch site within that native history, which is well beyond the scope of this chapter, what
would be needed first are analyses of temporal trends in Caddo occupational history and
social interaction and the concurrent development of more substantive and empiricallysupported theories within the region.

Luminescence Analysis of Ceramics from the Kitchen Branch Site
James K. Feathers
This section of Chapter 7 presents the results of luminescence analysis on 20 ceramic
sherd samples from the Kitchen Branch site (41CP220) in Camp County, in East Texas.
Most of the samples were anticipated to date between AD 1430â1680, based on ceramic
decorative styles (see Chapter 8, this volume), but there are a very few earlier (i.e. pre-AD
1200â1300) ceramics present as well. Radiocarbon dates have also been obtained from
three samples (see discussion, below). Table 7-12 lists the samples and provenience
information. Laboratory procedures are provided in Appendix 7-2.

Dose Rate
The dose rate was measured on each ceramic sherd and on its associated sediment.
Dose rates were mainly determined using alpha counting and flame photometry. The beta
dose rate calculated from these measurements on the ceramics was compared with the
beta dose rate measured directly by beta counting. Moisture content was estimated as
222 AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

80 Â± 20 percent of saturated value for
the ceramic sherds, and 16 Â± 5 percent
for the sediments. Table 7-13 gives the
radioactivity data and comparison of
the beta dose rate calculated in the two
ways mentioned. For only two sherds
(UW2691 and UW2694), marked in
italics, do the beta dose rates differ
significantly. Table 7-14 gives all dose
rates for each sample. The samples had
similar radioactivity dose rates varying
from 2.4 to 4.3 Gy/ka. The radioactivity
of the sediments was not too different
from that of the samples, suggesting
most samples were made locally.

for TL. Half the samples showed a
sensitivity change with heating. TL
anomalous fading was evident in all but UW2685. Anomalous fading rates, or g-values,
ranged up to 33 percent per decade, and 11 had values higher than 7 percent, which is
untypically high. Values higher than about 14 percent cannot be accurate because if they
were the samples would have no signal. Only three were so high that a fading correction
could not be made. Fading rates for these samples must have changed through time,
which also might be the case for all samples with high g-values, again reducing the TL
reliability. Where possible the TL age was corrected for fading following Huntley and
Lamothe (2001).
OSL/IRSL was measured on 3-10 aliquots per sample (Table 7-16). Scatter was high
(more than 10 percent over-dispersion) on six samples and it would have been high on
two others but an outlier was removed. The IRSL signal on all samples was weak, 8 to 40
times less intense than the OSL signal. This is not uncommon for ceramics. IRSL stems
from feldspars, which are prone to anomalous fading. A relatively large IRSL signal may
suggest the OSL signal partly stems from feldspars and therefore may fade, so the weak
IRSL suggests the OSL is dominated by quartz. The average OSL b-value, which is a
measure of alpha luminescence efficiency, is 0.50 Â± 0.15, which is also typical of quartz.

The OSL b-value was not measured on four samples, so the average was used. Given that
all but three were within this range, the error in using the average should be negligible.
The weak IRSL signal and the low OSL b-value make it likely the OSL signal stems mainly
from quartz and does not fade. As a test of the SAR procedures, a dose recovery test was
performed. The recovered dose was nearly the same as the given dose for all samples,
except for UW2690, where there was some over-estimation. Equivalent dose and b-values
are given in Table 7-17.

Table 7-18 gives the derived ages for each sample. They are discussed in the following
groups:
(1) Agreement between OSL and the fading-corrected TL. There are four samples in this
category, UW2687, UW2689, UW2695, and UW2697 (Table 7-18), and these should be
the most reliable dates. However, UW2687, which dates quite old, deserves comment. The

TL plateau was narrow for this sample and the fading rate quite high. Neither lends much
confidence in the TL results. The OSL data were also scattered, although the youngest
aliquot still gave a seventh century age. The uncorrected TL age was young (fifteenth
century), but the signal clearly suffers from anomalous fading, even if not as high as
measured. Thus, there is little evidence that this sample is very young.
(2) Agreement between OSL and uncorrected TL. There are six samples in this category.
For the ages to be correct, an argument must be made why the fading correction is not valid.
UW2695 was the only sample with a usable IRSL signal. The IRSL age also agreed with the
OSL and the uncorrected TL. Because IRSL is more likely to fade than TL, the agreement
suggests little fading. The g-value was high but based on only two points, providing little
confidence in its accuracy. Therefore, this should be a reliable date. Four other samples,
UW2686, UW2688, UW2698, and UW2699, in this category also had high fading rates.
The fading corrected age for UW2686 was not significantly different from the uncorrected
age, due to high scatter in the fading data. The correction is likely overestimated, because
by removing a few high points, the calculated g-value is close to zero. The corrected TL age
for UW2699 also was insignificant and also based on high scatter, as well as on few data
points. Little confidence can be placed in the corrected age, and the OSL data had strong
signals and no scatter. The g-value for UW2688 was somewhat high, but scatter cannot
account for it. The plateau was narrow for this sample, lending less confidence in the TL

data. The OSL data had strong signals and no scatter, so while the uncorrected TL age
probably reflects some fading, it is probably not much. UW2698 had a high g-value based
on only four points, while the OSL signal had no scatter. Again there is little evidence for
strong fading. The fading rate for the final sample in this category, UW2683, is not as high
(g=5.7), and the TL data are of reasonable quality in terms of plateau breadth and lack of
scatter. The OSL data, on the other hand, has the highest scatter (over-dispersion of 26.5
percent) of any sample. The oldest aliquot yields an age that is statistically similar to the
corrected TL age, but both are quite old (AD 200â500). I have listed the OSL/uncorrected
TL age as the best estimate, but with the understanding that it could be underestimated
by 200 years or so.
(3) TL age older than OSL age. Three samples, UW2682, UW2693, and UW2696, fall
into this category. This might be expected if the samples were not fired too high, zeroing
the OSL signal but not the TL signal. At least one of the samples, UW2693, had a very
narrow plateau, only 30Â°C, so the TL signal may contain a geological residual. With an OSL
b-value typical of quartz, the OSL age is the best estimate for this sample. The other two
had reasonable plateaus of 70â80Â°C. Fading corrections, on the other hand, placed both
TL ages more than 2000 years old, which does not seem reasonable, although the fading
rate for UW2682 was very high and probably overestimated. The TL data for UW2682
had high scatter, several points having to be removed as outliers. There was less scatter
for UW2696 but it was still higher than usual for TL. Both OSL ages, on the other hand,
showed no significant scatter, and the OSL b-value was typical of quartz, so these ages
remain the best estimates.
(4) TL age younger than OSL age. This is the largest group, with seven members. A younger
TL age can be explained by insufficient fading correction, and this indeed seems to be the
case for three of the samples, where fading could not be corrected because of an overestimated g-value: UW2691, UW2692, and UW2700. The OSL age is the best estimate,
but it should be noted that the OSL data for UW2700 had high scatter, so the error on this
date is high. Also, the UW2691 sample had a large discrepancy in beta dose rate between
beta counting and alpha counting/flame photometry. The beta counting results were used,
but the possibility that the age is overestimated cannot be ruled out. Data were too poor
for UW2690 to determine a g-value, so this sample also likely fades. In addition, the TL
suffered from high scatter and narrow plateau. The OSL is the best age estimate, but it
could be overestimated, because the dose recovery was overestimated for this sample.
No fading was evident for UW2685, although the data were somewhat scattered. The OSL
showed a strong signal and little scatter, so it is listed as the best estimate, although it
could be overestimated. TL gave a young age of AD 1660 Â± 60. The final two samples,
UW2684 and UW2701, had quite old OSL ages. The TL ages were both corrected for fading
but still were more than a thousand years younger than the OSL ages. The OSL data were
both scattered, but otherwise there is no good explanation for their old ages. TL gave
more reasonable ages and are thus considered the best estimates, although they could
be underestimated, and they have high error terms.

Kitchen Branch Site Ceramic Analysis
Timothy K. Perttula

Introduction
The analysis of the recovered ceramic sherds and pipes from the Kitchen Branch site
(41CP220), as well as other generally contemporaneous prehistoric Caddo sites in the
Big Cypress Creek basin, emphasizes the acquisition of information on the stylistic and
technological character of the prehistoric Caddo ceramic assemblage. Chronology, social
relationships, culinary traditions, the context of ceramic manufacture and production, and
exchange/interaction between Caddo groups are each to be addressed in this chapter,
which employs the abundant ceramic vessel sherds recovered from the Kitchen Branch
site during 2004â2005 and 2007 excavations. The goal is to contextualize the pottery
made and used at the site within the larger regional ceramic traditions and practices.
Certainly a principal research issue includes first refining or bracketing the age and intrasite chronological relationships of the ceramics at the site, starting from the available
radiocarbon (Chapter 7, this volume) and TL dates (Chapter 7, this volume) from features
and selected sherds at various depths and contexts, and investigating differences and
similarities in ceramic decoration and manufacture. Attributes of the ceramics are then
employed to establish the occupational history of the site as reconstructed from ceramic
stylistic analyses (particularly variation in decorative elements and motifs in both the utility
ware and fine ware), and then determining structure and feature relationships through
time by defining distinct ceramic assemblages.
These same stylistic analyses are employed to answer broader questions of the social
and cultural affiliation of the post-AD 1300 Caddo groups in the Big Cypress Creek basinâ
specifically in the heartland area of the Late Caddo Titus phaseâand the place of the
Kitchen Branch site within this community of Caddo people, through stylistic and vessel
morphological comparisons with collections from other broadly contemporaneous Caddo
sites in the local area. These include TARL collections of sherds and whole vessels from
Caddo sites in the local area, building on the comparative analyses already completed by
Thurmond (1990a), Perttula and Sherman (2009), Fields and Gadus (2012), and Perttula
(2012) (Figure 8-1). In this chapter, we are also concerned with determining the character
and frequency of the utility ware vessel forms in any prehistoric Caddo households and
components at the site, and how their composition at the assemblage level may be related
to (and influenced by) the postulated intensification of maize consumption by Late Caddo
groups in northeastern Texas (see SU 9 in Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:140), as well as
differences in culinary and plant food storage traditions.

The stylistic analysis of the Kitchen Branch site ceramics will focus on the definition of
recognizable decorative elements in the fine wares (i.e. the engraved and red-slipped
vessels, including carinated bowls and bottles) and utility wares (i.e. the coarse paste
decorated vessels), usually cooking or storage jars and simple bowls. These wares are
known to have been made and used differently, based on functional, technological, and
stylistic analyses on numerous Caddo sherd assemblages in the broader East Texas region,
234 AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

with uses ranging from food service, cooking of food stuffs, as containers for liquids, and
for plant food/seed crop storage. The ceramic analysis will be completed in conjunction
with formal and technological analyses of vessel sherds based on the detailed macroscopic
analyses of the cross-sections of more than 1050 plain and decorated sherds (see
Appendix 8.1 and 8.3), emphasizing paste characteristics, non-plastic inclusions, surface
treatments, and firing environments of the decorated and plain sherd assemblages.

Theoretical and Methodological Perspectives
As outlined in the research design that guided the project and the analysis of artifacts
recovered in the archeological deposits at the Kitchen Branch site (Chapter 4, this volume),
the particular theoretical focus is on a community of practice that has material, temporal,
and spatial expressions in the archeological record. By âpractice,â there is a focus on
the activities of individuals during the course of undertaking their daily routines, and how
those activities help define or subvert broader social structures at any given moment.
Thus, we mean the routine and everyday things that people did in the pastâspecifically
in this case, the Caddo peoples that lived at the Kitchen Branch site in the past and their
routines such as pottery production and decorationâand how these practices and actions
represent historical processes, as well as how people lived, reproduced, and transformed
the culture around them, contributing to short and long-term changes in cultural behavior
and traditions. It is the cumulative tempo and rhythm of daily life that gives direction and
structure to daily practices, as well as the patterning in the ceramic material culture that
can be documented in the archeological record, and as such constitutes their historically
contingent or contextual meaning (i.e. as documented as a variety of choices) within
communities in particular environmental and social situations.
The sherds from vessels found in Caddo contexts at the Kitchen Branch site were the
product of specific cultural and historical milieus; they have a social significance. That is,
the ceramics made and used by Caddo peoples have a social significance and a social
history, in that there are meanings inscribed in their form and style that have been derived
by people (potters included) as a result of âmaterial transactions and performances
that make up the day-to-day, rough-and-tumble of human social lifeâ (Habicht-Mauche
2006:7). Examining the social history of that materiality and the community of material
culture practice through a consideration of the wide range of ceramic vessel sherds can
lead (through regional comparisons) to the identification of other Caddo peoples that
held similar symbolic, structural, and aesthetic beliefs about material culture and how
the world worked. The histories of how ceramic vessels were made, shaped, and used
reflect technological, functional, and stylistic domestic practices, beliefs, and ideas shared
by different groups of people within households and communities of kin-affiliated Caddo
peoples, a community of practice.
To understand the Caddo history and history of use of the Kitchen Branch site through
the ceramic analysis, our focus is on materiality, use of space, and the history of place in
the archeological record. The importance of space, place, and practice in the context of
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. 235

Chapter 8

ceramic analysis is to examine of the everyday actions of Caddo peoples in households
that shared domestic space and participation in the activities of daily life as seen in the
character and composition of the ceramic assemblage(s), and their spatial distribution
(including indoor and outdoor space).
Furthermore, studies of prehistoric ceramic assemblages also provide valuable information
about Native American cultural adaptations, and offer a means of addressing chronology
and cultural-temporal frameworks as well as technological and stylistic attributes particular
to the assemblage itself. To speak to the broad range of issues pertinent to the ceramic
assemblage at the Kitchen Branch site, an analysis must be comprehensive enough to
capture the array of stylistic and technological diversity found on any one group of ceramics.
When sherds large enough to exhibit overall design motifs are present in the assemblage,
typological classifications are possible. In the absence of whole vessels or vessel sections
large enough to discern typologically distinct decorative motifs, another way to distinguish
subtle differences between relatively similar ceramics is to look at the technological
variations found on individual sherds or groups of sherds from discrete contexts. Variations
in key technological attributes such as temper, surface treatment, and thickness in Caddo
pottery in East Texas, and across the Caddo area, bear a direct relationship to the desired
use of the pot (see Perttula 2000). Accordingly, sherds recovered from the Kitchen Branch
site can be characterized according to a suite of key technological attributes, as well as key
decorative methods, motifs, and decorative elements. Each of these attributes provides
information about the technical knowledge and the stylistic choices specific to the ceramic
tradition(s) present at the Kitchen Branch and contemporaneous sites in the Big Cypress
Creek basin and the raw materials components of the pottery making process, which in turn
is informative about the different technical and stylistic choices made at various stages in
that process. These differences, in turn, provide a basis for comparing the technological
and stylistic variability of this specific ceramic assemblage to the technological and stylistic
variability found in other contemporaneous Caddo ceramic assemblages in this part of
East Texas.
Detailed analysis of the decorated and plain ceramic sherds from the Kitchen Branch
site (Appendix 8.1â8.3) is based on differences in temper, type of sherd (i.e. rim, body,
or base), rim and lip form (cf. Brown 1996:Figure 2-12), decoration (if present), surface
treatment (smoothing, burnishing, or polishing; see Rice 1987), and firing conditions (cf.
Teltser 1993). Sherd cross-sections were inspected macroscopically and with a 10X hand
lens to determine the character of the paste and its inclusions. Determining the firing
conditions is based on the identification of the firing core in the sherd cross-sections and
the identification of oxidation patterns as defined in Teltser (1993:535â536 and Figure
2aâh; see also Perttula 2005, ed.).
More specifically, the following attributes were employed in the analysis of the ceramics
from the Kitchen Branch site:

236 AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

a) temper, the deliberate and indeterminate materials found in the paste (Rice
1987:411), including a variety of tempers (grog or crushed sherds, burned
bone, and hematite) and âparticulate matters of some size;â
b) vessel form, although most of the sherds are small and thus from
indeterminate vessel forms, where sherds were large enough, vessel form
categories that could be identified include open containers (bowls and
carinated bowls) and restricted containers, including jars and bottles. Other
form attributes include rim profile (outflaring or everted, direct or vertical,
and inverted) and lip profile (rounded, flat, or folded to the exterior, among
others);
c) firing conditions, observations on ceramic sherd cross-sections permit
consideration of oxidation patterns (Teltser 1993:Figure 2aâh), namely the
conditions under which a vessel was fired and then cooled after firing;
d) finally, wall thickness was recorded in millimeters (mm), using a vernier
caliper, along the mid-section of the sherd.
With respect to interior and exterior surface treatment on the sherds, the primary methods
of finishing the surface of Caddo vessels includes smoothing, burnishing, and polishing,
although a few sherds may still have scraping marks from initial surface treatment work
by the potter. Brushing, a popular method of roughening the surface of Middle, Late, and
Historic Caddo cooking jars in the Big Cypress Creek basin with stiff bundles of grasses, is
considered a decorative treatment here rather than solely a functional surface treatment
(cf. Rice 1987:138). A roughened and brushed pot would certainly have been easier to pick
up and carry than would an unroughened or smoothed vessel, but because the brushing
was applied as an integral part of the decoration of both rim and body vessel surface,
we de-emphasize it as a surface treatment. Smoothing creates âa finer and more regular
surfaceâ¦[and] has a matte rather than a lustrous surfaceâ (Rice 1987:138). Burnishing
creates an irregular lustrous finish marked by parallel facets left by the burnishing tool
(perhaps a smoothed pebble or bone). A polished surface treatment is marked by a
uniform and highly lustrous surface finish, done when the vessel is dry, but without âthe
pronounced parallel facets produced by burnishing leather-hard clayâ (Rice 1987:138).
The application of a hematite-rich clay slip, black after firing in a reducing environment,
is another form of surface treatment noted in this assemblage, although it is very rare.
The clay slip was typically applied to the vessel exterior or both surfaces, and then was
burnished or polished after it was leather-hard or dry; when the vessel was fired, it created
a thin red slip. In other instances, a kaolin-rich clay (i.e. white pigment) or a hematite-rich
clay (i.e. red pigment) was applied as a pigment to engraved ceramic vessels.
Decorative techniques present in the Kitchen Branch site ceramic sherd collections
include engraving, incising, punctation, brushing, pinching, applique, and neck banding,
and on certain sherds, combinations of decorative techniques (i.e. brushed-incised and
brushed-appliqued, or incised-punctated sherds) created the decorative elements and
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. 237

Chapter 8

motifs. Engraving was done with a sharp tool when the vessel was either leather-hard or
after it was fired, while the other decorative techniques were executed with tools or fingers
(incising, punctations, and pinching with wood or bone sticks or dowels), by adding strips
of clay to the wet body (applique), using frayed sticks or grass stems (brushing) across the
vessel surface, or corrugating vessel coils when the vessel was wet or still plastic to create
a series of neck bands. Excising is considered a form of engraved decoration, where the
clay is deliberately and closely marked/scraped and carved away with a sharp tool, usually
to create triangular elements or crescent-shaped elements separating or defining scrolls.

Kitchen Branch Ceramic Assemblage
During the test excavations and
data recovery investigations at the
Kitchen Branch site, a total of 1873
plain and 2178 decorated sherdsâa
total of 4051 sherds in allâwere
recovered from various excavation and
recovery contexts (Table 8-1); about
90 percent of the sherds are from
the test and block excavations. The
plain to decorated sherd ratio is a low
0.88, generally consistent with post15th century AD Late Caddo ceramic
assemblages in the Big Cypress Creek
basin, as will be discussed below.

Given the extent of the block excavations at the site, the density of ceramic sherds in the
archeological deposits is quite low, suggesting that the Caddo occupation on this part of
the landform was not intensive or long-lasting. The density of plain sherds in the block
ranges by level from only 1.37â2.78 sherds per m2, with a peak in density between 0â40
cm bs (Figure 8-2a). For the decorated sherds, the density by level per m2 ranges from only
1.35â2.91, with a peak in density between 0â50 cm bs (see Figure 8-2a). Overall, the total
density of all sherds by m2 ranges only from 2.72â5.69 by level, with the highest densities
occurring between 0â40 cm bs.
With respect to the density of sherds by level per m3, peak densities for the plain sherds
(20â40 cm bs) and decorated sherds (20â50 cm bs) are much the same, with densities
ranging from 20.58â23.50 by level per m3 for the plain sherds and 21.11â24.62 by level per
m3 for the decorated sherds (see Figure 8-2b). The overall density of all the ceramic sherds
in the block excavations at the Kitchen Branch site ranges by level from 20.31â48.12 per
m3, with peak densities between 20â40 cm bs (see Figure 8-2c).

The spatial and vertical distributions of both plain and decorated sherds in the block
excavations are depicted in Figures 8-3a and 8-3b. Both the plain and decorated sherds
are rather equally distributed across the block excavations both spatially and vertically,
albeit in generally low numbers. From 0â20 cm bs, plain and decorated sherds cluster
primarily to the south and west of the house structure, although the sherd densities in
these clusters are low (less than 10 sherds in peak areas; Figure 8-3aâb). Concentrations
of both and decorated sherds from 20â40 cm bs are limited to three or four small clusters
situated either in proximity to the house structureâbut outside the structure itself to
the east and southeastâor are in extra-mural outdoor activity areas 5â9 m south and
southeast of the house structure (Figure 8-3aâb).
In the 40â50 cm and 50â60 cm bs levels, plain and decorated sherd densities occur in
several clusters in extra-mural activity areas both south and east of the house structure
area (see Figure 8-3aâb), with several clusters of decorated sherds 6â9 m to the south of
the house structure area. There is one spatial peak in both the plain and decorated sherds
in the 60+ cm bs levels: it is located in the northern part of the block in archeological
deposits underneath what is the house structure area (see Figure 8-3aâb). These sherds
may occur in unidentified pit features, or perhaps they represent a temporally earlier
accumulation of ceramic sherds although this seems unlikely given that the decorated
sherds do not appear to be from a stylistically earlier ceramic tradition.
A detailed technological and stylistic analysis was conducted on 589 decorated sherds,
and 467 plain rim, body, and base sherds (along with two ceramic pipe sherds). This
comprises a 26 percent sample of the decorated and plain rim, body, and base sherds,
and the decorative methods and elements were defined for each of the decorated sherds
in the assemblage.

Sherds from Experimental Archeology Vessel Study
Chase Earles manufactured eight different ceramic vessels for the experimental archeology
study (see Chapter 10, this volume). Four of the vessels (Pots 1â4) are utility ware jars and
the other four are: an engraved and/or slipped fine ware bottle (Pot 5); carinated bowls
(Pots 6â7); and a compound bowl (Pot 8). The vessels were made from either alluvial
clays gathered along Prairie Creek at the Kitchen Branch site (an olive gray clay, Pots
1â2, 5, and 8) or a weak red (7.5R 4/4, Pots 3â4, 6â7) upland clay at the Keering site in
the upper part of the Prairie Creek basin. Tempers employed included burned bone and
crushed sherds (grog); the latter derived from plain sherds in the Kitchen Branch and
Keering ceramic assemblages. In addition to the technological analyses discussed below
concerning the sherds from the broken vessels, sherds from four of the vessels (Pots 1,
4, 5â6) were subjected to instrumental neutron activation analysis (Appendix 8-4) and
petrographic analysis (Appendix 8-5).

Rim, body, and base sherds from the replicated vessels are analyzed in detail using
the sherd analysis approach employed on this project (see below). The technological/
manufacturing data obtained are used to make comparisons to the archeological samples
from the Kitchen Branch site, where manufacturing practices can only be inferred on the
basis of observed sherd physical and petrographic data. This approach should provide
a detailed framework into what Late Caddo Prairie Creek ceramic practices may have
consisted of, including what types of clay bodies may have been used (e.g., gray alluvial
clay, or red clay with iron or manganese in the clay), and how the firing conditions are
expressed in sherd cores, because the conditions of manufacture and firing were recorded
and each step carefully documented for further analyses in conjunction with the analyses
of the archeological ceramic samples (e.g., Harry 2010).
Basic details of the sherds from Pots 1â8 are presented in Table 8-2. The number of sherds
from the different vessels range from 46â102 per vessel, with a mean of 69.1 sherds per
vessel. If we apply the number of sherds from these vessels to the ancestral Caddo sherds
in the Kitchen Branch assemblage, this suggests that the archeological assemblage of
sherds could represent the fragments from approximately 60 different vessels.

The number of rims on the experimental vessels range from 11â17 percent of the sherds
from the jars, 11 percent of the bottle sherds, 15 percent from the one compound bowl,
and from 30â41 percent of the carinated bowls. Taken together, approximately 17 percent
of the sherds from the eight experimentally produced vessels are rims (a mean of 11.8
rim sherds per vessel). In the archeological assemblage from the Kitchen Branch site, only
8 percent of the sherds are from rims (n=322), suggesting that the sherd assemblage is
highly fragmented. If we apply the number of rim sherds from these vessels to the ancestral
Caddo sherds in the Kitchen Branch assemblage, this suggests that the archeological
assemblage of rim sherds could represent the fragments from approximately 30 different

Vessel forms were readily apparent based on rim profiles, visible vessel carina on sherds
from carinated bowls and compound bowls (Pots 6â8), and an interior roughened surface
of one bottle (Pot 5). The four everted rim vessels (Pots 1â4) are jars of varying sizes.
Measured orifice diameters from rim sherds were roughly comparable to the actual
measured diameters (see Chapter 10, this volume), with a mean difference between the
measured rim sherd and the measured vessel diameter of 1.2 + 0.47 cm, and differences
in ranges between 13â18 cm for measured rim sherds and 11.5â18 cm for actual vessel
diameters. This suggests that the orifice diameters of the measured rim sherds from the
Kitchen Branch site (see below) accurately portray the diameters of vessels made and
used by the Caddo at the site.
We know that the experimentally produced vessels were fired in a pit fire to around 1300
degrees F (see Chapter 10, this volume). According to the sherd core profiles, three of the
vessels in one batch (Pots 1â4) were clearly fired and cooled in an oxidizing environment
(firing condition A), and another was primarily fired in an oxidizing environment, but had
patches of the core that had been incompletely oxidized, leaving oxidized zones at the
surfaces, but a dark reduced core (firing condition A and F) (see Table 8-2). The second
batch of firing (Pots 5â8) had a wider range of firing conditions (see Table 8-2), indicating
that the firing was not well controlled, and certainly not as well controlled as ancestral
Caddo potters were able to accomplish (see below). In the latter group of pots, two
were incompletely oxidized during firing (firing condition C), although one of these had
wider zones of reduced paste (firing condition F). The other two pots in this batch were
apparently fired in a reducing environment, and then cooled in an oxidizing environment,
leaving thin oxidized zones at either one or both surfaces (firing conditions F and G). All
of the pots have fire clouds on either one or both vessel surfaces. Another pot (Pot 5) had
discernable carbon accumulations or sooting on the interior surface at the neck/rim and
upper body, suggesting the vessel was standing up when fired (and perhaps when the pot
was smothering with carbon materials), allowing carbon to accumulate at the open neck
and on the upper vessel body.
One vessel (Pot 6) had a recognizable, although thin, red slip on both interior and exterior
surfaces. Another vessel (Pot 5) had a red organic pigment smeared in a band over and
adjacent to the engraved lines. Ancestral Caddo potters carefully used a pigment of
unknown composition, and had sufficient control over the painting (and/or the clean-up
of the pigment after it was applied) that the pigment was basically confined only to the
engraved lines.
The identification of the tempers used in the sherds from the experimentally produced
vessels was relatively straightforward. Two tempers were used: burned bone and grog, in
varying combinations: Pot 1 (coarse bone and grog); Pot 2 (grog); Pot 3 (coarse bone and
grog); Pot 4 (coarse grog); Pot 5 (grog); Pot 6 (coarse grog); Pot 7 (grog); and Pot 8 (fine
bone and grog). Although the size or proportions of the temper in the paste of the vessels
was not quantified in the detailed analysis of sherds from the various vessels, three of the
vessels identified as having a coarse temper (Pots 1, 3â4) were the only modern vessels
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. 243

Chapter 8

produced where the temper additives comprised 30 percent of the paste (see Chapter 10,
this volume). The other vessel sherd identified as having a coarse temper (Pot 6) was from
a pot with 20 percent temper. The one vessel sherd identified as having a fine temper (Pot
8) was one of the two pots made by Chase Earles that had the lowest temper proportions
in the clay paste (8 percent, see Chapter 10, this volume). These analyses of the sherds
suggest that it would be analytically useful in future detailed sherd analyses of ancestral
Caddo pottery to identify and specify the size and texture of the temper additives.
Sherds from three of the pots (Pots 2, 5, and 8) were identified as having a sandy paste.
All three of these pots were made from a Prairie Creek alluvial clay collected at the
Kitchen Branch site. These results lend credence to the identification of paste groups
with a sandy paste in the sherds from the ancestral Caddo ceramic assemblage from the
Kitchen Branch site (see Chapter 9, this volume). However, since sandy paste sherds only
comprise between 26â41 percent of the sherds by vessel ware (see Table 8-3 below) in the
assemblage, this suggests that more than one source of clay (i.e. a non-sandy paste clay)
was used in vessel manufacture in the Late Caddo occupation. None of the experimentally
produced vessels made from a red upland clay from the Keering site had sherds that were
identified as having a sandy paste, perhaps indicating that a mixture of both alluvial and
upland clays were selected for vessel manufacture, depending upon the intended form
and function of the vessel to be produced by Caddo potters.
The range in vessel wall and base thickness in the experimentally produced vessels is
considerable, particularly with the thickness of body and base sherds (see Table 8-2) from
vessels of different forms. This may speak to a basic difference in the controlling of the
shape and form of clay coils, as well as vessel finishing before firing, between ancestral
Caddo potters with considerable experience (as part of a long regional tradition of ceramic
manufacture and use) in the manufacture of vessels suitable for domestic serving,
cooking, and storage needs (see Table 8-4, below), and the less rigid requirements of
this experimental pottery-making study. Nevertheless, the sherd thickness data from the
experimentally produced vessels do fall within the 1â2 standard deviation range of the
mean of measured fine ware, utility ware, and plain ware sherds from the Kitchen Branch
site.

Instrumental Neutron Activation and Petrographic Analyses
Produced Sherds from Modern Vessels

of

Experimentally

The instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) of sherds from Vessels 1 (KIT 31),
Vessel 4 (KIT 32), Vessel 5 (KIT 33), and Vessel 6 (KIT 34) indicate that the samples from
Vessels 4â6 are chemically quite similar to the INAA results from sherds from the Kitchen
Branch and Keering sites (see Appendix 8-4 and Chapter 9, this volume), which in turn
suggests that most, if not all, of the sherds from these Late Caddo sites were made with
local clays, since the experimentally produced vessels were made from local Prairie Creek
clays. Ferguson and Glascock (Appendix 8-4:Table 1) indicate that the chemical signature
of the sherds from these three vessels are consistent with sub-region Group 4, which
244 AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

covers sites in the middle and upper Big and Little Cypress creeks in East Texas. Both the
Kitchen Branch and Keering sites occur in sub-region Group 4.
Vessel 1 (KIT 31) stood out from the others in the INAA (see Appendix 8-4). This particular
vessel had a substantial amount of bone temper added to the paste (30 percent, and
coarse in texture), and Ferguson and Glascock suggest this difference âmay be due to
either different raw material from the other samples or a calcium adjustment that did not
adequately remove the diluting effects of the large amount of calcium-based temper.â
Since Vessel 1 (KIT 31) was made from the same clay as Vessel 5 (KIT 33), a local alluvial
clay gathered at the Kitchen Branch site, it is likely that the calcium adjustment employed
is the principal factor in its apparently different chemical composition.
Finally, the INAA results did not differentiate between the two different clay sources used
in vessel manufacture: alluvial clay at the Kitchen Branch site (KIT 31 and KIT 33) and
the upland clay at the Keering site (KIT 32 and KIT 34). Although this is not addressed
in Appendix 8-4, it is possible that the grog temper additives in the vessels has had a
confounding effect on more specific identifications of different clay sources in the Prairie
Creek basin, as well as in East Texas as a whole (see Chapter 9, this volume).
The petrographic analysis of sherds from the same four vessels identified two basic pastes
in the experimentally produced vessels: sandy paste with bone and grog temper (KIT 31,
KIT 33, and KIT 34), and Sandy paste with grog (KIT 32) (see Appendix 8-5). Any differences
in the vessels made from two different clay sources was not apparent in the analyses,
as âthey appear remarkably similar: a coarse, sandy paste with biotiteâ (Appendix 8-5).
These pastes are much the same as were defined by Cecil in the petrographic analyses
of archeological sherds from the Kitchen Branch and Keering sites (see Chapter 9, this
volume). The petrographic analysis of the modern sherds identified rare bone temper (<1
percent of the counted grains in the thin sections) from KIT 33 and KIT 34, although no
bone temper was added to the clay paste by the modern potter (see Chapter 10, this
volume). One likely source of the identified bone is the grog generated from ceramics from
the Kitchen Branch and Keering sites. The one vessel with a coarse bone and grog temper
(KIT 31) is characterized in the petrographic analysis as having a high frequency of bone
temper, which comports to the Pot 1 manufacturing specifications (see Chapter 10, this
volume).
The petrographic analyses suggest that quartz sand was ground up and deliberately added
to the clay in the KIT 33 sample. This sherd sample had a bimodal distribution of quartz
grain sizes, with angular and large pieces apparently having been created by crushing the
sand before it was added to the clay (see Appendix 8-5). This result is intriguing because
the potter that produced the experimental vessels did not crush and deliberately add sand
to the paste in any of the eight vessels (see Chapter 10, this volume). This is turn suggests
that the identification of larger and angular pieces of quartz in petrographic thin sections
of the archeological specimens may not correlate with the use of sand as a deliberate
temper. Such a conclusion calls into question the petrographic analysis interpretation that
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. 245

Chapter 8

many of the sherd paste groups (Paste Groups 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10, or 60 percent of
the paste groups) identified at the Kitchen Branch and Keering sites (and even a burned
clay sample from the Kitchen Branch site) had sand grains deliberately added to the clay
paste as a temper (see Chapter 9, this volume). Instead, the sand in the paste more likely
represents variation in size and angularity of the natural sand content of Prairie Creek
clays, and Caddo potters recognized this variation when they selected clays for vessel
manufacture. Similar differences in the interpretation of sand as a temper were noted in
the Pine Tree Mound site (41HS15) ceramic and petrographic analysis (Fields and Gadus
2012:533). It should not be discounted, as well, that these experimental sherds were
generated using grog from archaeological context. In turn, this could have introduced an
undetermined amount of quartz as well.

Technological Characteristics
The examination of the technological character of the Kitchen Branch site ceramics
focuses on the use of temper, differences in the paste of the vessels, sherd thickness,
firing conditions, and surface treatment. These comparisons are made between the fine
wares (i.e. engraved and red-slipped), utility wares (wet paste decorations), and plain wares
(plain rims and plain body sherds; the latter admittedly can be from plain vessels as well
as the undecorated portions of fine wares or utility wares, but the comparisons between
these three categories still prove useful).
The Caddo potters at the Kitchen Branch site had a number of different temper and paste
recipes they employed in the manufacture of the different wares that were used (and
eventually discarded) by families and the community. In general, grog (or crushed sherds)
was the preferred temper, and this temper was added to the paste, which ranged from silty
to clayey in texture but also included a sandy paste (Table 8-3).
Other important tempers include burned bone, especially in the utility wares, and hematite/
ferruginous sandstone fragments. Both the utility wares and plain wares consistently
used more hematite/ferruginous sandstone fragments in vessel manufacture than is the
case with the fine wares (see Table 8-3). Between 0.4â1.9 percent of the sherds have
an abundance of charred plant remains and charcoal pieces in the paste (i.e. organics
in Table 8-3). These pieces probably represent fragments of charred and uncarbonized
materials that were in the clay when it was collected, and probably had not been winnowed
or cleaned from the clay when it was worked, or were not oxidized during firing (either
because some vessels were not well-fired, or were not fired for a suitable duration to
combust the organics in the paste).
The high frequency of grog tempering in the ceramic assemblages, and in each ware,
represents a specific attempt on the part of Caddo potters at the site and the local community
to produce strong and durable ceramic vessels. Firing would have created darker-colored
vessels in a reducing firing environment (or lighter tan, orange, and brown colors in

oxidizing environments, depending
upon the amount of iron naturally
occurring in the clay), while
allowing them to be fired longer,
and producing a harder ceramic
vessel (Rice 1987:354; Teltser
1993:532, 540). Since grog has
expansion coefficients comparable
to the coefficients of the clay paste
most commonly seen in Caddo
pottery vesselsâespecially with
the finely crushed grog pieces
noted in the fine waresâthis would
have contributed further to the
ability of fired vessels to withstand
heat-related stresses, as well as
increasing their flexural strength
(Rice 1987:362). It would have
been important that sources of
grog temper would be abundant
at the site, at least after the first
few vessels were broken there,
as would the fact that including
grog in the paste (especially finely
crushed pieces) would have helped
minimize the likelihood of vessel
failure form either mechanical
and thermal stress (Steponaitis
1984:94â95,

Hematite/ferruginous sandstone
may have been added to the paste
of certain vessels strictly as a matter of personal choice by individual Caddo potters,
but it may have served a useful purpose nonetheless. That is, like feldspar (often also
found in microscopic quantities in the paste of Caddo vessels, see Perttula 2000), the
occurrence of crushed grains of hematite/ferruginous sandstone in the paste would likely
have enhanced a vesselâs ability to melt and fuse the paste constituents during firing, thus
resulting in a dense, hard body, and a reduced vessel porosity (Rice 1987:96). Similarly,
the addition of a coarse temper like hematite/ferruginous sandstone pieces would have
aided a vesselâs ability to withstand thermal shock.
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. 247

Chapter 8

Crushed and burned bone may have been added to a vesselâs paste for the same reason:
namely that crushed and burned bone produces with little effort an angular particle shape
whose coarseness and size gave vessels tempered with it the ability to withstand thermal
shock (e.g., Whittlesey 2004:287). Such attributes would have been particularly sought
after in the manufacture of utility wares, since most of them are jars used for cooking.
The majority of the vessel sherds from the Kitchen Branch site have a clayey to silty paste,
although a significant number of the sherds have a sandy paste. Clays used for vessel
manufacture were probably gathered from nearby alluvial settings along Prairie Creek,
but certainly within a short (1â7 km away, at most) distance from the settlement (Arnold
2000:343; Arthur 2006:52), so that an inordinate amount of time and energy was not
expended by potters in hauling clay back to the site. The local clay along Prairie Creek by
the site is olive gray (5Y 5/2) in color. Arthur (2006:52) points out that potters are likely
to select lower quality clays for vessel manufacture than high quality clays if the latter are
farther away. It is assumed that the pottery found at the site was very likely to have been
made on site by potters who lived there. Available chemical and petrographic analyses of
vessel sherds only suggests that the sherds were made from local clays, not specifically
clays procured in the immediate vicinity of the Kitchen Branch site (see Chapter 9, this
volume).
Depending upon the type of ware, about 26.9â41.5 percent of the vessel sherds examined
in detail have a sandy paste (see Table 8-3), suggesting that a naturally sandy clay was
regularly selected by Caddo potters for use in making particular kinds of vessels. The
highest frequency of sandy paste sherds are found in the plain wares, but a sandy clay was
also commonly used among both the fine wares and utility wares. The use of a sandy paste
may have facilitated the resistance of vessels to thermal shock or mechanical breakage.
Another aspect of the vessels made and used at the Kitchen Branch site that can be
measured is body wall thickness. The fine ware vessel sherds are consistently from vessels
made thinner than the decorated utility ware or plain ware sherds, particularly when
measured along the rim (Table 8-4). These variations in vessel wall thickness are likely
related to functional and technological decisions made by Caddo potters in how these
different wares were intended to be used in local Caddo households. The less substantial
vessel walls in some of the utility wares would be well suited to the cooking and heating of
foods and liquids and, because heat would have been conducted efficiently while heating
rapidly, would have contributed to their ability to withstand heat-related stresses; also,
the much thicker utility ware vessels (with rim thicknesses greater than 9 mm and body
wall thicknesses greater than 10â11 mm) would have created stronger and more stable
vessels, and would have been well suited for use as long-term storage containers (Rice
1987:227). Fine wares were probably intended for use in serving foods and liquids, and
thinner and less porous vessel walls would have helped to maintain the temperature of
served food and liquids; thinner and lighter vessels would have also contributed to the ease
with which serving vessels could be handled, used, and transported. Plain wares probably
had a mixture of uses, including both food serving as well as cooking and storage. The
248 AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

thickness of the plain ware sherds are
closely comparable to the utility wares
(Table 8-4).
Another factor that would have
influenced vessel body wall thickness
would have been the sequence in which
a vessel was constructed (Krause
2007:35), of which there are a wide
variety of choices available to potters
(cf. van der Leeuw 2002:243â256).
Vessels constructed from the bottom
up, as these Caddo vessels likely
were, would tend to have thinner walls
moving up the vessel body towards
the rim, with the lower portion of the
vesselâespecially the base, likely
made separately, and thus available to
serve as a support during later vessel
constructionâusually
significantly
thicker (i.e. 3â4 mm thicker, see Table
8-4) than the upper portions of the
vessel.

The Kitchen Branch vessel sherds
are from vessels fired in a variety of
different ways (Table 8-5), presumably
reflecting personal preferences in firing,
the desired vessel color, the kind of
clays that were used, and the functional
and technological requirements of the
kinds of vessel forms that were being
manufactured at the site. Vessels and
pipes were fired in an open fire, with the
vessels and pipes either set atop the
fire or nestled in the coals and ash.

Most of the sherds at the Kitchen Branch site are from vessels from all three wares that
were fired in a low oxygen or reducing environment (78.6â81.4 percent). A particular firing
method was to fire a vessel in a low oxygen environment, but then pull it from the fire to
cool in the open air (see Table 8-5, firing conditions FâH). This left either one or both vessel
surfaces a lighter reddish-brown to brown oxidized color, probably a preferred color for
plain wares and fine wares, along with occasional vessels that were fired to a gray, black,
or dark grayish-brown color. In general, there are no significant differences in how utility
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. 249

Chapter 8

ware, plain ware, and fine ware vessels were fired. Fine ware and plain wares were better
made and better fired (at least in terms of regulating the firing temperature), however,
and they were probably fired longer in a low oxygen environment than the utility wares.
The Caddo potters likely exerted more control over the end product of fine ware and plain
ware vessel manufacture than they did with the utility wares, primarily to produce a harder
ceramic. Firing conditions tend to be only slightly more heterogeneous among the utility
wares, likely the product of the multi-purpose nature of these vessel forms, as they were
used for cooking pots and storage containers. As long as the porosity of the utility wares
was not excessive, and there was a good balance between clay plasticity and temper
constituents, they did not need to be fired for as long a time as the harder fine wares to be
quite serviceable vessels without being subject to diminished strength from cumulative
thermal fatigue as well as cracks and fractures.
A few sherds among the plain wares and utility wares in both ceramic components have
distinctive cores, with a dark exterior/light exterior cross-section or lighter cores than their
surfaces (I and K on Table 8-5). These sherds are restricted to the utility wares (1.4 percent)
and plain wares (0.4 percent). Aten and Bollich (2002:54â55) suggest that vessels with
this kind of firing may have been placed in a fire with the âorifice [of the vessel] facing into
the fire.â Furthermore, the sherds with cores lighter than the surfaces may have come
from vessels where âafter extended firing that burned off all organics, the fire may have
been smothered to cause reduction and darkening of the exterior surface.â Sherds with
the X firing condition (0.9â1.0 percent)âwith multiple oxidized and reduced zones in the
coreâare also restricted to the utility wares and plain wares (see Table 8-5).
When a ceramic vessel reaches its final shape during manufacture, modifications are typically
made to the surface. These modifications are supplemental to the basic manufacture of
the vessel and are performed after the vessel has attained its final shape. Techniques that
affect the vesselâs basic surface are carried out during all stages of pottery manufacturing,
but for analytical purposes this analysis differentiates between surface modifications that
are carried out on wet pliable clay (i.e. smoothing) from those that are part of the finishing
of leather-hard or dry vessels (i.e. burnishing)(see Rice 1987:136â141).
Between 20.4â36.5 percent of the sherds in the detailed sherd analysis sample from the
Kitchen Branch site have no apparent surface treatment (Table 8-6). The most prevalent
form of surface treatment on the remainder of the sherds is smoothing, especially on the
interior surface of utility wares, and on the exterior surface of both the fine wares and
the plain wares. The burnishing of vessels is particularly notable in the fine wares, most
commonly on the exterior sherd surface. Less than three percent of the utility ware sherds
are burnished, compared to 7.8 percent of the plain ware sherds.
The use of smoothing was likely done to lower the permeability and increase the heating
effectiveness of particular vessels (see Rice 1996:148), particularly the utility wares
used for cooking. The plain sherds, as well as the utility ware sherds, are frequently
smoothed on interior vessel surfaces, while the fine wares and plain wares are more
250 AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

commonly smoothed and burnished
on exterior vessel surfaces. Since
the fine wares were not used for
cooking purposes, but to hold and
serve foods and liquids, a smooth or
burnished surface would have been
advantageous in the repeated use
of such serving vessels. The exterior
smoothing and burnishing may also
have been intended for stylistic and
display purposes, creating a flat
and lustrous surface well suited to
highlight engraved and/or slipped
surfaces of the fine ware vessels.
The regular occurrence of exterior
burnished plain ware sherds (4
percent) and exterior smoothed
sherds (51.2 percent) (see Table
8-6) suggests that some of the plain
wares were treated as fine waresâ
being well smoothed or burnishedâ
and probably were also used for the
serving of foods and liquids.

Smoothed and burnished grog-tempered pottery made at the Kitchen Branch site combines
strength, thermal shock resistance, resistance to breakage, and low permeability, and,
thus, vessels may have lasted for a considerable length of time, especially if the vessels
being used were large in size (see Arthur 2006:93). Vessel breakage, by whatever means,
nevertheless, occurred with regularity at the site because they were used on a daily basis,
particularly so in the case of the cooking vessels, and this resulted in a large accumulation
of pottery sherds primarily outside the house structure.

Plain Ware Sherds
The 1873 plain sherds in the ceramic assemblage include 93 rims, 1589 body, and 191
base sherds. Technological characteristics of the plain ware sherds (plain rim, body, and
base sherds) have already been discussed, but in this section of Chapter 8, I focus on the
rim and lip profiles of the plain wares, as well as estimations of the orifice diameters of the
plain wares. For comparative purposes, I also consider the rim and lip profiles of the fine
wares and utility wares in the Kitchen Branch ceramic assemblage. Plain rims account for
approximately 29 percent of all the rims in the sample, indicating that plain ware vessels
of various forms were relatively abundant and widely used at the site.

Chapter 8

Where information is available, plain rims (Figure 8-4a, dâf) primarily have direct or vertical
profiles (88 percent). Five, from jars, have everted or outflaring profiles (10 percent), and
one plain bowl rim (2 percent) has an inverted profile (Figure 8-5). Lip profiles are rounded
(66 percent) and rounded, exterior folded (29 percent) (Figure 8-6); the latter are probably
from plain carinated bowls or jars. Other lip treatments include scalloped (n=1), interior
beveled (n=1), rounded and exterior folded lip and interior thickened (n=1), and rounded
lips from a rim peaked vessels (n=1). One plain rim with a direct rim and a rounded,
exterior folded lip has been well flattened, resembling the distinctive Redwine mode (see
Walters 2010).
The few large plain ware rim sherds (n=9) have orifice diameters that range from 4â27 cm,
with several clustering between 14â25 cm, indicating the common manufacture and use
of medium-sized vessels. The smallest rim (4 cm orifice diameter) is from a bottle, while
the others are from bowls and jars; no obvious plain carinated bowl rim was identified in
the plain ware rim assemblage.
In addition to the many plain rims, there is a section of a small plain bowl (grog-tempered,
with a sandy paste) from Unit 83, 30â35 cm bs. The bowl stands 5.6 cm in height, has
a direct rim and a rounded lip, and a flat and thick base (11.7 mm). The rim part of the
vessel is 7.9 mm thick, while the body part is 10.0 mm. The bowl has been fired in a
reducing environment, and cooled in the open air.
Fine ware rims either have direct (74 percent) or everted (26 percent) rim profiles (see
Figure 8-5); the everted rims are likely mainly from compound bowls. Lip profiles are more
commonly rounded and exterior folded (40 percent), as is common on many Late Caddo
carinated bowls in the Big Cypress Creek basin, along with rounded lips (51 percent) (see
Figure 8-6). One lip is flat, one is interior thickened and another exterior thickened (the
thickened lips are likely from bowls), and two are from engraved bowls or carinated bowls
with rim peaks. Rims where the orifice diameter could be measured ranged from 13â29
cm (medium to large sizes), with a mean of 18.9 cm.
Utility ware rim profiles are either direct (59 percent) or everted (41 percent) (see Figure
8-5), with many everted rim jars. Lips are most commonly rounded (65 percent), with
a significant proportion of rounded, exterior folded lips (27 percent), about the same
percentage as the plain rims (see Figure 8-6). Eight percent of the lips are flat, and one is
from a jar with a rim peak. Utility ware rims where the orifice diameter could be measured
ranged from 8â26 cm (small to large sizes), with a mean of 19.3 cm.

Stylistic Characteristics
There are 19 different decorative methods identified in the Kitchen Branch site ceramics,
including appliqued (alone and in combination with punctated, brushed and incised
elements), brushed, brushed-incised, brushed-punctated, brushed-incised-punctated, and

brushed-punctated-incised, engraved (from bowls, carinated bowls, ollas, and bottles),
engraved-appliqued, incised incised-punctated, neck banded, punctated (including tool
and fingernail), pinched, and red-slipped (Appendix 8-2). Within these general decorative
methods, a number of specific ceramic decorative elements are defined that represent
distinct kinds of decorations or decorative combinations. These decorative elements,
discussed and tabulated in more detail below, are based only on sherds larger than 1.5 cm
in length and width (any sherd smaller than that was considered a sherdlet; the sherdlets
are not discussed further in this chapter).
Ceramic style elements defined and recognized on sherds and vessels from the Kitchen
Branch site simply represent one classification of different ways of decorating a vessel by
ancestral Caddo peoples, and there is general consensus that shared styles are âthe result
of direct cultural transmission once chance similarity in a context of limited possibilities is
excludedâ (Dunnell 1978:199). If the decorative elements are truly stylistic in character,
they allow the measurement of time as well as interaction/cultural transmission between
different but contemporaneous groups of people (Lyman et al. 1997:10), along with an
assessment of a potterâs place within a larger tradition of ceramic practice. Because the
lionâs share of the ceramics are sherds rather than vessels or sherd vessel groupings,
the most accessible stylistic information from the Kitchen Branch site is the rim and body
decorations (often different on the same vessel), even though differences in Caddo vessel
forms through time appear to be stylistic as well. According to Sadie Bedoka, a CaddoDelaware woman interviewed by historians employed by the Works Progress Administration
254 AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

in the 1930s, âeach [Caddo] clan had its own shape to make its pottery. One clan never
thought of making anything the same pattern of another clan. You could tell who made the
pottery by the shapeâ (La Vere 1998:92).
I am interested, however, in determining not only the broad trends in changing ceramic
styles, but also in exploring more-fine-tuned synchronic and diachronic differences in
stylistic composition and diversity within the archeological deposits at the Kitchen Branch
site. This dictates a more detailed consideration of ceramic stylistic variability and diversity,
focusing on decorative elements (also termed modes). These represent distinct designs or
design combinations (i.e. the breakdown of individual decorations within an overall design,
as in a hatched triangle,
circle, or tick marks) that can

five percent of the decorated sherds (n=108) are from feature contextsâparticularly from
Feature 209âwhile the remainder are from habitation deposits in and around the domestic
structure and associated extra-mural activity areas situated in the vicinity of the structure
(see Chapter 6, this volume). The majority of the decorated and plain sherds at the site
are from outdoor contexts, where it is likely most cooking and food serving activities took
place, as well as trash discard activities.
A total of 45 features (18.5 percent of all the features) have decorated sherds from utility
wares and/or fine ware vessels (Table 8-8). Fourteen of these features (31 percent) have
fine ware sherds, primarily engraved vessel sherds, while 91 percent of the features have

utility wares that appear to be from one coherent decorated sherd set. The proportion
of fine wares versus utility wares in the features is 13 percent versus 87 percent, not
much different than in the Kitchen Branch assemblage as a whole (16 percent versus 84
percent), suggesting that the same occupational activities are likely responsible for the
distribution of decorated sherds in features as well as non-feature contexts (i.e. general
breakage and discard). None of the features have any identified earlier Caddo decorated
ceramics.		
Brushed sherds are the most common in the feature decorated sherd assemblage,
accounting for 37 percent of the sample (see Table 8-8). Brushed utility ware sherds also
occur in the highest proportion of features with decorated sherds (56 percent), followed
by incised (29 percent of the features), and punctated (18 percent of the features) sherds.
Further emphasizing the ubiquity of utility ware sherds with brushing, sherds with brushing
and other decorative elements (i.e. brushed-incised, brushed-punctated, and brushedappliqued) are found in 69 percent of the features with decorated sherds.

Fine Wares
The fine ware sherds from the Kitchen Branch site include sherds from vessels that
have engraved decorations, engraved-red slipped decorations, and engraved-appliqued
decorations. Also included in the fine wares are red-slipped sherds, as these primarily are
from burnished bowls, bottles, and carinated bowls, typical fine ware surface treatment,
and vessel forms, rather than from utility ware jars.
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. 257

Chapter 8

Engraved
The engraved sherds from the Kitchen Branch site include sherds from bowls, carinated
bowls, compound bowls, and bottles, the full repertoire of vessel forms used by the
Caddo in food service and to contain liquids. Engraved sherds are relatively abundant
in all excavated areas at the site, indicating the Caddo peoples that lived on the site and
used each of these areas (and discarded broken vessels in these areas) had a roughly
comparable access to fine wares.
There are 60 engraved bottle body sherds in the fine wares. This comprises 17 percent of
the fine wares at the site, and 2.8 percent of all the decorated sherds in the assemblage
(see Table 8-1). A number of the bottle sherds have a red pigment rubbed in the engraved
lines (n=12 or 20 percent of the bottle sherds), and 10 percent of the bottle sherds are
from vessels that were red-slipped before they were fired and engraved. There is a wide
range of engraved decorative elements represented in the bottle sherds (Table 8-9), from
straight, horizontal, and parallel lines (typically found near the top and bottom of the bottle
bodies) to circles (Figure 8-8d), cross-hatched zones, sets of curvilinear lines, concentric
lines, excised elements (Figure 8-7a), hatched elements (Figures 8-7bâc and 8-8b, j), and
negative ovals (as outlined by cross-hatched zones, Figures 8-7d and 8-8g).
The various engraved elements identified on the bottle sherds resemble the intricate
decorative elements on both Ripley Engraved and Wilder Engraved bottles, especially
the former. As described by Suhm and Jelks (1962:127), Ripley Engraved bottles âhave
concentric circles with ticking or pendant triangles on the linesâ¦plain circles with a cross
in the central oneâ¦and scrolls with a circle-and-cross in the center.â The bottle sherds from
the Kitchen Branch site have circles (included rayed or excised circles) and concentric
circles (many of the curvilinear engraved sherds represent portions of these concentric
elements), although none of the sherds have crosses or circle-and-cross elements. Large
pendant triangles are also present in the bottle sherds, along with hatched triangles,
zones, and nested triangles; these are secondary elements to the primary circle elements.
One of the more distinctive elements in the bottle assemblage is a negative S-shaped
element (see Table 8-9), more frequently seen in some carinated bowl varieties of Ripley
Engraved. Fields and Gadus (2012) and Gadus (2013) label this the SZ element.
One bottle sherd can be definitively linked with the Wilder Engraved type. This particular
sherd has a curvilinear scroll element that is wider at one end than the other, which is a
classic part of the scroll motif on Wilder Engraved bottles. Suhm and Jelks (1962:155)
describe the scroll motif as follows: [w]here the two scroll arms pass above and below
this circle [the primary element in the motif], they are widened considerably by excising
[or hatching or cross-hatching]..[t]hese swellings may occur even when there is no circle
joining the two scroll arms.â
Most of the engraved sherds from the Kitchen Branch site are from carinated bowls or
bowls. This includes 40 rims and 177 body sherds (Table 8-10), representing 61.6 percent
258 AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

of all the fine wares, and 10 percent of all the decorated sherds in the assemblage (see
Table 8-7). Only a few (2.3 percent) of these engraved sherds are from vessels that have
had a pigment (either white, n=1, or red, n=4) rubbed in the engraved lines, and only one
sherd (0.5 percent) is from a vessel that was red-slipped before it was fired and engraved.
While the full motifs are not apparent on the many engraved sherds from carinated bowls
and bowls, the constellation of engraved elements are nevertheless fairly clear in that
most of the sherds are associated with scroll designs from Ripley Engraved vessels, in
particular, slanting scroll motifs associated with var. Gandy, var. Galt, var. Caldwell, and
var. Carpenter (Figure 8-9bâd, f). As best as can be determined, the primary element
associated with the slanting scrolls is either a circle (sometimes excised, with rays, see
Figure 8-8d) or a semi-circle (see Figures 8-11b and 8-8h); no diamond-shaped elements
(var. McKinney), circle-and-cross elements (var. Galt and var. Cash), or nested triangle

there are also cross-hatched and excised

the lip (possibly from a Ripley Engraved,
var. McKinney vessel), or associated
with slanting scrolls (cf. Ripley Engraved, var. Gandy or var. Galt, see Table 8-10). There are
also large hatched triangle elements in the assemblage (see Figure 8-8i), but they appear
to be a primary element rather than a secondary element associated with central circles
or diamonds.
More unique engraved sherds are apparently not from Ripley Engraved vessels. One
rim has concentric semi-circles, and this may be from an engraved effigy vessel, where
the semi-circles would have been situated on the rim under either the effigy head or an
associated tab tail. One rim has a hooked arm element (see Figure 8-8a), more common
in Taylor Engraved carinated bowls, bowls, and compound bowls (see Suhm and Jelks
1962:Plate 75aâo), while two body sherds have horizontal engraved lines with rows of
cross-hatched engraved triangles whose apexes point towards each other (see Figures
8-8d and 8-10c). One large rim has an irregular stacked set of open and cross-hatched
rectangles (see Figures 8-10c and 8-8m).
Compound bowls with two rim panels comprise 30 percent of the engraved rims (n=18) in
the Kitchen Branch ceramic assemblage, suggesting they were a regular part of the fine
ware vessels in use at the site. Two of these rims have rim peaks (Figure 8-12), and another
has a suspension hole on the upper panel. Almost 90 percent of the compound bowls have
widely-spaced horizontal engraved lines on the upper panel. Another has horizontal and
diagonal engraved lines between sets of horizontal lines, and one has a Ripley Engraved
slanting scroll motif.
Few lower panel compound bowl sherds (n=7) were identified in the assemblage, likely
because it is difficult to distinguish between carinated bowl and compound bowl sherds
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. 263

Chapter 8

without the rim or carination being present. One
has a Ripley Engraved slanting scroll element, and
two others have circles or ovals. The remainder
have only horizontal or parallel engraved lines.
Three of the engraved sherds are from ollas, large
short-necked bottles. The decoration is on the
neck of three different vessels. One has a straight
engraved line, another has parallel engraved lines
and an open triangle, while the third has a crosshatched engraved zone.

Engraved-Appliqued

Figure 8-12. Engraved compound
bowl sherd with rim peak.
Provenience: Unit 5, 35â40 cm bs.

There is a single body sherd (probably from a
bowl or carinated bowl) in the decorated sherd
assemblage that has a unique engraved-appliqued
decorative element. The decoration consists of a curvilinear engraved line adjacent to a
straight appliqued ridge. It is likely that the appliqued ridge serves as a divider, probably
repeated four times, between engraved motifs on the rim panel.

Slipped and Red Washed
Red-slipped and/or red washed sherds comprise approximately 13 percent of the fine
wares in the assemblage, and 2.1 percent of all the decorated sherds from the Kitchen
Branch site (see Table 8-7). None of the red-slipped sherds are rims, although one carinated
bowl sherd is present in this group, along with 13 identifiable bottle sherds.
The bottle sherds have a red slip only on the exterior sherd surface. Another 16 body sherds
also have a red slip on their exterior surfaces, but they cannot be identified as deriving
from bottles. Fourteen sherds have a red slip on both interior and exterior surfaces, and
they are from bowls and carinated bowls.
Three body sherds have an interior red slip and/or red wash. These may be from bowls
and/or jars. Sherds with a red wash have been identified in Middle and Late Caddo
ceramic assemblages in the Little Cypress Creek basin (Perttula and Ellis 2012:178â179;
Sherman et al. 2011:77â78). The red washed sherds are differentiated from red slipping
by its fired appearance (a dull red, as opposed to a dark red color among the red-slipped
sherds) and a thin wash, slurry, film, or coating of clay visible in the core cross section
along one vessel surface.

Utility Wares
Utility ware sherds are from vessels used for cooking and storage tasks at the Kitchen
Branch site, almost always jars; there are two sherds with incised lines that may be from
ollas, however. These vessels are more coarsely tempered, and have thicker and more
durable walls than most of the fine wares. They often have extensive areas of charred
organic residues and sooting for use over an open fire.
There are 16 different decorative methods represented in the utility ware rim and body
sherds from the Kitchen Branch site. The decorative methods are all wet paste, meaning
they were done before the vessel was fired or was leather-hard. The most common
decorative methods include sherds with brushing (53 percent of the utility ware decorated
sherds), incised sherds (21 percent), sherds with brushed-incised elements (6.7 percent);
and sherds with tool punctated elements (6.4 percent). Comparing the frequency of
decorative methods in the utility ware rim sherds (n=164), more than 28 percent of the
rims are from incised vessels; 20 percent are from punctated vessels; 12 percent are
from incised-punctated vessels; 10 percent are from brushed-punctated vessels; and 22
percent are from brushed vessels. The disproportion of brushed rim and body sherds (53
percent of all the utility ware sherds) to brushed rim sherds (only 22 percent of the utility
ware rims) suggests that a considerable number of vessels in the Kitchen Branch site
assemblage were decorated on their bodies with brushing marks, but many of these same
vessels were decorated on the rim with one of the other decorative methods.

Appliqued
The appliqued sherds in the assemblage include three rims and 19 body sherds (1.2
percent of the utility wares). The rims have vertical appliqued ridges (n=2) or an appliqued
node at the mid-rim (n=1). The body sherds include one with an appliqued lug and another
with an appliqued node, as well as straight or curvilinear appliqued ridges or fillets.
Straight (n=8) or parallel (n=1) appliqued ridges are common, as these served to divide
the vessel body into panels, usually decorated with incised or brushed decorations (cf.
Pease Brushed-Incised); there are also three straight appliqued fillets. The remaining five
sherds have curvilinear or circular appliqued ridges (n=3) or fillets (n=2) from Harleton
Appliqued jars. One Harleton Appliqued body sherd has a circular appliqued fillet with an
inner appliqued node (Figure 8-13a).

Appliqued-Incised
The nine appliqued-incised body sherds have straight or vertically oriented appliqued fillets
(n=7) or straight appliqued ridges (n=2). The incised elements adjacent to the appliqued
fillets include straight or parallel lines (n=5), vertical incised lines (n=1), or diagonal incised

lines to one side of the ridge.

straight or vertical appliqued
fillets. Tool punctations
occur in either straight or curvilinear rows adjacent to the appliqued fillets.

Brushed
Sherds from brushed vessels are by far
the most abundant of the utility wares
at the Kitchen Branch site, accounting
for 22 percent of the utility ware rim
sherds and 53 percent of all the
decorated utility ware sherds. Including
the brushed sherds that have other
decorative methods in combination with
brushing, 66.4 percent of all the utility
ware sherds (and 55.6 percent of the
decorated sherds) have brushing marks,
as do 38 percent of the utility ware rims
(see Table 8-7).
The majority of the rims (78 percent)
have horizontal brushing marks, and
most of the body sherds have parallel
brushing marks (89 percent), Figure
8-14b) (Table 8-11). Although the
orientation of the parallel brushed body
sherds is not known with certainty, it is

Brushed-Appliqued
All of the brushed-appliqued
sherds from the site (n=54)
are body sherds (see Table
8-7). This indicates that this
combination of decorative
methods was restricted to
the body of utility ware jars,
particularly Pease BrushedIncised jars (Suhm and
Jelks 1962:Plate 60aâb, h).
Approximately 65 percent
of the brushed-appliqued
sherds have straight or
vertical appliqued fillets (see
Figure 8-15bâc and Figure
8-16f), and the remainder
have straight or vertical
appliqued ridges.

elements and motifs: a, d, incised; b, brushed-incised; c,
gâh, j, l, incised-punctated; e, brushed-punctated; f, brushedappliqued; i, brushed-incised-punctated; k, punctated.

In most cases, the brushing
marks are aligned parallel
to the appliqued fillet (86
percent of the sherds) or appliqued ridges (47 percent of these sherds), or are oriented
vertically, with the presumption being that both the appliqued fillets/ridges and brushing
marks are oriented vertically on the vessel body. There are other brushing elements,
however, as there are parallel-overlapping (n=1), vertical (n=2), opposed (n=1), and parallelopposed (n=1) brushed decorations associated with the appliqued filets. These alternative
brushing elements are more commonly noted on the appliqued ridge sherds: horizontal
(n=1), opposed (n=4), vertical (n=2), opposed-vertical (n=1), vertical-diagonal (n=1), and
diagonal (n=1). These suggest more complicated decorative motifs on utility ware jars,
with diagonal and chevron-shaped appliqued elements and surrounding brushing marks
(see Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 60f).

Brushed-Incised
Sherds with brushed-incised decorative elements are relatively common at the Kitchen
Branch site (see Table 8-7). They are represented by seven rims and three lower rim-body
sherds (five percent of the utility wares), as well as 113 body sherds (6.8 percent of the
utility wares). Brushed-incised decorations appear to be a more prevalent decorative
treatment on the bodies of utility ware jars than on the rims, although both instances are
present in the assemblage.

268 AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

The few rim sherds include various combinations of brushed and incised decorative
elements (Table 8-12). The rims typically have either horizontal and/or or diagonal brushing
marks with horizontal incised lines that either parallel to or are offset from the brushing
itself. In two cases, incised lines (diagonal or vertical in orientation) cross-cut or overlie the
brushing marks, and in another rim, diagonal brushing overlies sets of diagonal incised
lines. Lower rims illustrate this same dichotomy of either brushed or incised decorations
on the rim, and the reverse on the vessel body (see Figure 8-16b), while the third lower
rim-body sherd has diagonal brushing marks overlying diagonal incised lines (Table 8-12).
Most of the body sherds with brushed-incised decorative elements have parallel brushed
marks and incised lines (91 percent) (see Table 8-12). A few others have horizontal brushing
(n=2), diagonal brushing (n=2), vertical brushing (n=1), overlapping brushed (n=1),
opposed brushing (n=3), and parallel-opposed brushing (n=1) that occurs in combination
with incised lines of the same orientation. Some 11 percent of these body sherds have

brushing marks in certain directions that are cross-cut by incised lines added to the vessel
decoration while the brushing marks were still wet on the vessel body. Most of the crosscutting incised lines are parallel or straight in orientation (see Table 8-12).

Brushed-Punctated
There are 17 brushed-punctated
rim sherds, three lower rim-body
sherds, and 33 body sherds.
These comprise 11 percent of the
utility ware rims and lower rimbody sherds (see Table 8-7), and
2 percent of the utility ware body
sherds. The relative proportion of
rim to body sherds suggests that
most of the brushed-punctated
decorative elements are probably
confined to the vessel rims (Figure
8-17aâc) of Bullard Brushed and
Pease Brushed-Incised vessels.

a, Unit 165, 60â70 cm bs; b, Stain #100, 36 cm bs;
c, General scrape area; d, Unit 82, 60 cm bs.

There are a variety of rim decorative elements (Table 8-13). Most of them (76 percent)
have horizontal brushing on the rim with tool punctated rows under the lip (see Figure
8-17a), a tool punctated row near the top of the rim, or mid-rim (see Figure 8-17c). A few
others have diagonal brushing (18 percent) or vertical brushing (six percent) marks on
the rim. The rims are about equally divided between those where the tool punctated rows
have been pushed through the brushing and those where the tool punctated row has been
placed above or adjacent to areas of rim brushing.
The lower rim-body sherds each have tool punctated rows at the rim-body juncture.
Brushing on the body ranges from diagonal to horizontal on these few examples (see Table
8-13). Body sherds have an equally diverse range of brushed and punctated decorative
elements; most would not be amiss on Pease Brushed-Incised jars. Fully 46 percent of the
body sherds have parallel brushing marks with either rows of tool punctations or fingernail
punctations pushed through the brushing (see Figure 8-17d). Another body sherd has
parallel brushing marks adjacent to a row of tool punctations. Two other parallel brushed
sherds have zones of brushing on either side of an open panel with a single central row
of tool punctations (see Table 8-13 and Figure 8-16e). Nine (27 percent) body sherds
have horizontal brushing marks, with punctations either pushed through the brushing or in
adjacent rows. Approximately nine percent have diagonal brushing marks, with an adjacent
row of tool (see Figure 8-15e) and circular punctations. Finally, three brushed-punctated
body sherds have opposed, overlapping, or vertically-oriented brushing marks, with a row
of tool punctations either pushed through the brushing (n=2) or in a row adjacent to the
brushing (n=1).

Brushed-Punctated-Incised
The seven brushed-punctated-incised sherds are from Pease Brushed-Incised jars; they
comprise only 0.4 percent of the utility wares from the Kitchen Branch site. They include
two rims, three lower rim-body sherds, and two body sherds.

Chapter 8

One rim is horizontally brushed, with a tool punctated row under the vessel lip, and with
diagonal incised lines cutting through the brushing. The second rim is also horizontally
brushed, but with tool punctated rows pushed through the brushing and vertical incised
lines cutting through the brushing marks (see Figure 8-16i).
Two of the lower rim-body sherds have diagonal incised lines on the rim, but their body
decorations vary. The first has a tool punctated row at the rim-body juncture and diagonal
brushing on the body. The other is horizontally brushed on the body, with a row of tool
punctations pushed through the brushing. The third lower rim-body sherd has rows of
punctations on the rim and vertical brushed-incised lines on the body. The two body sherds
have parallel brushed-incised lines with a row of tool punctations pushed through the
brushing (see Figure 8-14d).

Brushed-Incised-Appliqued
The brushed-incised-appliqued sherds are from the body of two different jars, likely of the
Pease Brushed-Incised type. One of the body sherds has a straight (vertically oriented?)
appliqued fillet adjacent to parallel brushed-incised marks and lines. The other body sherd
also has a straight appliqued fillet, adjacent to parallel brushed marks and curvilinear
incised lines.

Brushed-Appliqued-Punctated
There are only two brushed-appliqued-punctated sherds in the assemblage. One lower-rim
body sherd is horizontally brushed on the rim, has a row of circular tool punctations at the
rim-body juncture, and appliqued ridges on the upper part of the vessel body (see Figure
8-13b). This is likely from a Pease Brushed-Incised jar (see Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate
60). The other is a body sherd with vertical appliqued ridges with horizontal brushing marks
between the ridges. Although the rim decoration is not known, this sherd is also likely to be
from a Pease Brushed-Incised vessel (cf. Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 60h).

Tool Punctated
Utility ware vessels decorated with tool punctates are a common feature of the Kitchen
Branch site ceramic assemblage. There are 30 rims (18 percent of the utility ware rim
sherds) and 86 body sherds (5 percent of the utility ware body sherds) (see Table 8-7).
None of the sherds from the site are large enough to determine if utility ware vessels were
decorated strictly on the rim (as seen on Mockingbird Punctated jars, Perttula et al. 1998),
or if vessels were decorated on both the rim and the body strictly with punctated elements.
Nevertheless, the common occurrence of tool punctated body sherds as well as some of
the decorative elements suggest that the bodies of some utility ware jars had punctated
designs on them.

The tool punctated rims include
oblong and triangular-shaped
elements made with tools (93
percent of the rims) (Table 8-14
and Figure 8-18bâd). The linear
tool punctated rims have closely
spaced lines or end-on-end narrow
rows of tool punctations (one of
the linear tool punctated rims also
has diagonal lip notches), while
the other tool punctations on the
rims are more widely spread. The
remainder have large circular tool
punctations (Figure 8-18a).
It is common for tool punctations
to be placed in a row under the
vessel lip (see Figure 8-18c),
and these rims also have rows of
tool punctations at mid-rim and
at the rim-body juncture. Other
tool punctated rims have several
continuous rows of punctations,
perhaps four or more rims covering
the rim surface. In addition to
horizontal rows of tool punctations
on the rim, there are three rims
with diagonal rows, and another
rim where tool punctates form
elements in a scroll and bracket
motif, otherwise a common fine
ware motif (see Table 8-14 and
Figure 8-16k). A very similar
tool punctated rim sherd has
been recovered in a Titus phase
domestic context at the Pilgrimâs
Pride site (41CP304) on Walkers
Creek, several miles north on Big
Cypress Creek from the Kitchen
Branch site (Perttula 2005).
Almost all of the tool punctated
body sherds have rows of
punctations (98 percent) (see

Table 8-14). These are the most problematic of the utility wares as to whether they
represent punctated decorations on the body of utility ware jars, or are simply from the
lower rim of jars. Two tool punctated body sherds seem likely to be from the body of jars:
one with V-shaped rows of tool punctations (perhaps part of a appliqued-fillet design on
a Pease Brushed-Incised jar, see Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 60f), and the other with a
triangular-shaped zone of tool punctations.

Fingernail Punctated
Utility wares decorated with fingernail punctations are rare in the Kitchen Branch ceramic
assemblage (0.3 percent of the utility wares), including only two rim sherds and four body
sherds. All six sherds have rows of fingernail punctates, typically on the rim of jars, but
possible also covering the vessel body to an unknown extent.

Pinched
Fourteen body sherds from Killough Pinched jars are in the utility ware assemblage (0.8
percent). These have straight and parallel pinched ridges (n=10) (see Figure 8-9e), as well
as curvilinear pinched ridges (n=3, see Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 46g) and straight and
diagonal pinched ridges.

Incised
Rim and body sherds with incised decorative elements (n=389) are one of the more
common utility ware decorations in the Kitchen Branch site ceramic assemblage. The
incised sherds are most likely from Maydelle Incised vessels, or Karnack Brushed-Incised
jars, although short-rimmed vessels (e.g., Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 43a, e) are not
represented in this set of rims. Overall, incised sherds represent 21.3 percent of the utility
wares, including 28.6 percent of the rims, and 17.9 percent of all the decorated sherds.
This is second in overall utility ware representation in the collection, after brushed sherds
(see Table 8-7).
There are several different decorative elements on the jar rims of incised sherds, although
most are diagonal (43 percent) and horizontal (32 percent) (Figure 8-19aâc and Table
8-15). Cross-hatched (Figure 8-10d), diagonal opposed (see Figure 8-16d), vertical,
vertical-diagonal, and horizontal-diagonal motifs are also represented in the Kitchen
Branch site assemblage, along with two rims from ollas that have diagonal incised and
opposed incised lines. One of the vertical incised rims is also lip notched.
The two lower rim-body sherds have different incised decorative elements. One has
diagonal opposed incised lines on the rim, while the body is plain, while the other also has

diagonal opposed incised lines on the rim, with a bordering horizontal incised line at the
rim-body juncture (see Table 8-15).
Incised body sherds are almost exclusively geometric in design, with straight, parallel,
diagonal, opposed, cross-hatched lines, etc. (see Table 8-15). Most have straight or
parallel incised lines (n=255, see Figure 8-19i), but a number also feature cross-hatched
(see Figure 8-19f, h) and diagonal opposed incised lines (see Figure 8-10e); several of
these are from Pease Brushed-Incised jars (see Figure 8-16a; see also Suhm and Jelks
[1962:Plate 60i, k]). About only 2 percent of the incised sherds have curvilinear elements,
either as the sole element, or in combination with horizontal, parallel, or straight lines.
Finally, one distinctive body sherd has an incised triangle filled with hatched lines (see
Figure 8-19g).
One of the more distinctive incised sherds is a jar handle (19 mm in width) from Unit 82,
35â40 cm bs. It has diagonal opposed and cross-hatched incised lines across the width
of the handle.

Incised-Punctated
There are a total of 52 utility ware rim and body sherds in the Kitchen Branch assemblage
that have incised-punctated decorative elements. Most, but not all, of these sherds are
from Maydelle Incised vessels (see Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 52). This includes 19 rims,
eight lower rim-body sherds, and 25 body sherds (see Table 8-7), accounting for 10 percent
of the utility rims in the sample, 38 percent of the lower rim-body sherds, and 1.5 percent
of the body sherds. Incised-punctated sherds are particularly well represented among the
utility ware jar rims.
More than 73 percent of the rims have diagonal incised lines on them, with a row of tool
punctations as a border under the vessel lip (Figure 8-20d-e and Table 8-16; see also
Figure 8-16g). Other rims have rows of tool punctates and diagonal incised lines (Figure
8-20a), horizontal and/or diagonal incised lines with zones filled by punctations (see Figure
8-16j), incised triangles filled with tool punctations (see Figure 8-16h), and a rim with a row
of circular punctations under the lip as well as horizontal and alternate diagonal incised
lines (Figure 8-20b; see also Figure 8-16l).
Lower rim-body sherds have diagonal incised lines on the rim and a row of tool punctations
at the rim-body juncture, along with others that have vertical or diagonal incised lines on the
vessel body (see Figure 8-20c), below a row of tool punctates at the rim-body juncture. Most
of the incised-punctated body sherds (84 percent) have a row or rows of tool punctations
associated with simple diagonal, opposed, parallel, or straight incised lines (see Table
8-16). The four sherds with opposed and diagonal opposed incised lines on one or both
sides of a row of tool punctations (see Figure 8-16c) are from Pease Brushed-Incised jars,
where there are panels of incised lines and vertical rows of punctations on jar bodies. The

Vertical Distribution of Utility Wares and Fine Wares
The utility ware and fine ware sherds from the Kitchen Branch site have a distinctive
vertical distribution throughout the archeological deposits. Examining that distribution
level by level, from 0â20 cm bs to 60+ cm bs, indicates that virtually the same proportions
of decorative methods occur from one level to another in both the utility wares and fine
wares (Table 8-17 and Figure 8-21).
Sherds with brushed decorations (and brushing in combination with other methods,
including incising, appliqued, or punctations) represent between 52â59 percent of all the
decorated sherds in each level from the top to the bottom of the archeological deposits
(see Table 8-17). This is indicative of the essential decorative homogeneity of the ceramics
in the block excavations at the Kitchen Branch site. Sherds with incised linesâanother
common utility ware decorative method at the siteâaccount for 13.3â21.1 percent of the

decorated sherds by level, and the limited differences in the relative proportion of the
other utility ware decorative methods by level is apparent: appliqued (0.5â2.2 percent),
tool punctated (3.2â7.6 percent), and incised-punctated (2.2â3.3 percent).
Fine wares with the same decorative elements comprise between 11.7â19.8 percent of
the decorated sherds at the Kitchen Branch site by level (see Table 8-17). Red-slipped
sherds, a distinctive aspect of some Late Caddo decorated sherd assemblages in the
Big Cypress Creek basin, account for between 1.2â4.4 percent of the decorated sherds
(see Table 8-17). There is a similar proportional range in the engraved wares by depth
(10.5â17.0 percent).
That the same proportion of stylistic distinct decorative methods has been documented
from what have been identified as a suite of Late Caddo fine ware and utility ware types
throughout the archeological deposits strongly suggests that the decorated sherds at
the Kitchen Branch site are part of a single coherent ceramic assemblage, despite its
considerable vertical distribution. There is no indication from the vertical distribution of
the utility wares and fine wares to suggest that there is an identifiable earlier assemblage
of decorated ceramics in any of the arbitrary levels in the block excavations.
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. 279

Chapter 8

Spatial Distribution of Utility Wares and Fine Wares
The decorated sherds from the Kitchen Branch site also have a distinctive spatial
distribution in the block excavations, which provides insights into the use, breakage, and
discard of fine ware and utility ware ceramic vessels at the site during its Late Caddo
occupation. Even though utility wares are much more common at the site than are the fine
wares, there are several small clusters of fine ware sherds in several parts of the block
(Figure 8-22a). These peaks occur primarily outside the house structure defined in the
main block, in several different extra-mural outdoor activity areas to the immediate north
and east, and then from 5â15 m southeast of the structure. There are two small clusters
of fine ware sherds within the boundaries of the structure, in contexts that appear to be
along or near the structure walls, perhaps sherds from broken pots that were brushed or
swept under bedding or other internal elevated structure features (Figure 8-22a).
Utility ware sherds have a broader distribution across the block excavations than do the
fine wares, with a number of spatial clusters in the central and north blocks (see Figure
8-22b). Several of the clusters of utility ware sherds occur within the confines of the house
structure in the north block, in the same areas as the fine ware peaks within the structure
(see Figure 8-22a), as well as in a number of extra-mural outdoor activity areas. These
extra-mural peaks in utility ware sherds are apparent immediately outside and to the east
of the structure (on the opposite side of the structure from what may be the structure
entrance in the western part of the main block), as well as 5â10 m or more south and
southeast of the structure walls (see Figure 8-22b). Between these two areas (i.e. within
structure and extra-mural outdoor activity), there is a ca. 14 x 10 m area of the block with
a more or less continuous distribution of sherds from discarded and broken utility ware
vessels.

Clay Pipe Sherds
Clay pipe sherds are rare in the Kitchen Branch site archeological deposits. The first is an
elbow pipe stem rim from Unit 14, 30â40 cm bs. The rim is direct, with a flat lip, and has
a 3.0 cm orifice diameter (see Figure 8-4b); the stem is 7.4 mm thick. The pipe has been
tempered with grog and bone, smoothed on the exterior surface, and fired and cooled in a
reducing or low oxygen environment.
The second clay pipe sherd is from Unit 108, 22â25 cm bs. It appears to be part of a small
bowl rim (see Figure 8-4c) from a long-stemmed Red River style pipe (cf. Hoffman 1967).
The pipe has been tempered with bone, has a sandy paste, is only 3.0 mm in thickness,
and has been fired in a reducing environment and cooled in the open air. The bowl also
has been smoothed on its exterior surface, and there is an organic residue on the bowlâs
interior.
The occurrence of both long-stemmed Red River pipes and elbow pipes at the Kitchen
Branch siteâif from contemporaneous contextsâsuggests the use of smoking pipes after
ca. AD 1350. Red River style pipes were made in East Texas Caddo sites from ca. AD
900â1400, and were eventually replaced by elbow pipes after the mid-14th century AD,
based on findings at the Oak Hill Village site (41RK214) (Rogers and Perttula 2004). By the
early 15th century AD, elbow pipes of various forms were the only style of clay pipe made
and used by East Texas Caddo peoples.

Clay Ornament
A single rectangular-shaped clay ornament that would have been suspended on a string
around a personâs neck was recovered from Titus phase archeological deposits (Unit 56,
30â36 cm bs) at the Kitchen Branch site. The ornament is made with a naturally sandy
paste clay and no temper additives, and all surfaces of the ornament are unsmoothed. The
ornament is 38.0 mm in length, 30.0 mm in width, and 12.6 mm in thickness.
There are two small (3.3 mm in diameter) suspension holes in lobes at the top of the
ornament, and the front and oxidized surface is filled with diagonal and straight rows of
small circular punctations (Figure 8-23a). There is one triangular-shaped punctation in
the lower left part of the piece, on one of the bottom lobes. The back side of the piece
is blackened from lack of exposure to oxygen when it was fired, and it has a rough ovalshaped incised element centered below the two suspension holes, as well as a single
diagonal incised line with two small incised spur lines (Figure 8-23b).
One of the sides of the clay ornament is also decorated, while the other side is plain. The
decorated side has two closely-spaced vertical incised lines in the center of the piece, with
short opposed incised lines at the top.

Clay Coil
Incidentally fired and preserved clay coils provide direct evidence for the on-site manufacture
of ceramic vessels at the Kitchen Branch site. Two clay coil fragments (23â23.5 x 14
mm in length and width and 9 mm in thickness), with grog temper inclusions, have been
recovered from Unit 56, 30â36 cm bs. The principal technique used in the manufacture
of local ceramics was the building of vessels using coils, beginning at the flat base and
working up the vessel body. Using the coiling method, coils of clay, in the form of ropes,
rolls, or fillets, were built up to create the desired size and height of the vessel. Coiling is
a technique especially suited to the construction of large, sturdy vessels, such as storage
jars (Rice 1987:128), but in the case of the Prairie Creek Caddo potters, coiling of plastic
clays led to the manufacture of a wide variety of vessel forms.

Burned Clay and Daub
During the two phases of archeological investigations at the Kitchen Branch site,
approximately 1,039.1 grams of burned clay (approximately 1,170 pieces) and an
additional 83.9 grams of daub (n=47) were recovered in the archeological deposits.
Burned clay concentrations across the block excavations increase gradually to their peak
at 30â40-cm bs, then decline abruptly (with the understandable increase in the 60+
cm bs elevation range being a product of multiple levels rather than an actual increase
in quantity) (Table 8-18). When examined horizontally across the main excavation block,
burned clay quantities are highest in the south block, with approximately 8.7 grams per
m2. The Middle Block, alternatively, is the lowest in burned clay quantity, with 3.8 grams
per m2 or 166.4 grams total. Finally, in the largest, North Block, a total of 577 grams
of burned clay was recovered, at a density of approximately 5.9 grams per m2. Burned
clay piece sizes remained relatively consistent throughout the vertical soil column with
calculated mean fragment weights ranging from 0.7 grams (20â30 cm bs) to 1.1 (60+
cm bs) grams per fragment.

As mentioned above, daub quantities were relatively low within the Kitchen Branch site
excavation area. Daub counts gradually increase with depth, reaching their peak in the
40-50 cm bs level before dropping precipitously to 0 below 60+ cm bs. In a pattern that
generally follows the burned clay observations, daub densities across the blocks overall
were highest in the South Block (0.84 grams/m2), significantly lower in the Middle Block
(0.06 grams/m2), and middling in the North Block (0.5 grams/m2). Unlike burned clay,
daub sizes increase with depth, reaching 2.2 grams per piece in the 40â50 cm bs level
and increase to 12.3 grams for the single fragment collected in the 50â60 cm bs elevation
range (see Table 8-18).
This density is more likely a result of the simple area/volume excavated as the North Block
contained the largest amount of daub overall (see below). Daub/burned clay concentrations
are highest near the house structure in the North Block, with distinct peaks noted between
0â20 cm bs and 20â40 cm bs toward the structureâs east and along the apparent northern
and southern walls (Figure 8-24). There is a particularly dense concentration in the
easternmost edge of the North Block at 30-40 cm bs. This may indicate that the area
was more intensively used for the kinds of activities that produce burned clay and daub,
perhaps outdoor cooking in pits and the burning of a thatch and mud-covered structure.
Overall, the very low density of daub across the excavations indicate that the Caddo house
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. 283

Chapter 8

structure in the North Block did not burn down before it was abandoned. The one peak
in the quantity of burned clay in and near the South Block is most likely attributed to a
particularly dense cluster observed in the uppermost 20 cm bs of Unit 122 as counts
decline steadily with depth from that point. In the disturbed upper elevations, it is unlikely
that this peak is an indication of cultural activity (unless it is the product of the historic use
of the site) and is more likely a remnant of disturbance as a result of soil disturbance and
shifting such as push piles.

Figure 8-24. Daub/Burned Clay Distribution at the Kitchen Site.

Specifically from feature contexts, burned clay distributions vary significantly, with some
containing as little as 0.1 grams (Features 163, 164, and 192) and others yielding
significantly more (150 grams in Feature 209, 80.4 grams in Feature 219, and 28.6 grams
in Feature 12 (Table 8-19). The majority of features with burned clay have only a light
to moderate accumulation, with most containing 1â5 grams each. Pits accounted for
the largest proportion of the feature-related burned clay, averaging 4.2 grams per feature
while post holes were less than a quarter of that, with 0.95 grams/feature. When applied
to average feature volume, however, the proportion reverses with post holes containing
approximately 0.19 grams of burned clay per liter versus 0.05 grams per liter within pits.
These low densities of burned clay and daub are consistent with a relatively short-duration
Caddo occupation at the site, as a more intensive use accompanied by repeated fires and
midden creation would likely have dramatically increased the quantity of burned clay and
more broadly distributed it across the site.

Recognizable Earlier Caddo Decorated Sherds
There are six decorated sherds in the Kitchen Branch decorated sherd assemblage whose
stylistic character suggests they are the product of the manufacture, use, and discard of
Caddo vessels sometime prior to ca. AD 1200. All are found below 30â35 cm bs in the
archeological deposit, with 50 percent found from 50â62 cm bs.
Two sherds have overhanging parallel or horizontal incised lines, and are probably both
from Coles Creek Incised barrel-shaped jars (Unit 73, 40â45 cm bs and Unit 89, 30â35
cm bs). One has overhanging incised lines on a collar, and has been identified as coming
from a Coles Creek Incised, var. Chase vessel (Figure 8-25a, see Phillips 1970). This
particular sherd may have been discarded between ca. AD 850â1000, based on its regular
occurrence in dated contexts at the Crenshaw site (3MI6) on the Red River in southwestern
Arkansas (John Samuelsen, personal communication, 2012).
The other four possible earlier Caddo decorated ceramics in the assemblage have incised
zones filled with punctations. The first is a cf. Crockett Curvilinear-Incised bowl sherd (Unit
110, 62 cm bs) with incised scrolls and a central incised circle filled with small triangularshaped punctations (Figure 8-26a; cf. Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 17c, g). There also is
a drilled suspension hole at the base of the rim. Two other probable Crockett Curvilinear
Incised body sherds (Unit 130, 50â55 cm bs and 1 m south of Feature 209, 45 cm bs;
these sherds may be from the same vessel) have circular and curvilinear incised zones
filled with small circular punctations (Figures 8-25câd and 8-26c). The last of these earlier
sherds is a probable Pennington Punctated-Incised rim (Figures 8-24b and 8-25b) with
diagonal incised zones that are filled with cane punctations. Both the Crockett Curvilinear

Incised and Pennington Punctated-Incised sherds are commonly found in pre-AD 1300

Local and Regional Comparisons
To assess the stylistic and cultural affiliations of the ancestral Caddo component at the
Kitchen Branch site within the Big Cypress Creek basin (Figure 8-27), the presence and
relative proportions of the principal decorated types (both the engraved and slipped fine
wares and the utility wares, which have different kinds of rim and body decorations) are
examined in funerary wares as well as decorated sherd assemblages from domestic
contexts. The most common Late Caddo Titus phase ceramic types in the Big Cypress
Creek basin include Ripley Engraved (mainly carinated bowls, compound bowls, and
bottles) (Figure 8-28aâd) and Wilder Engraved (Figure 8-29aâd) among the fine wares,
and Bullard Brushed, Harleton Appliqued, Pease Brushed-Incised, and Maydelle Incised
(Figure 8-27eâh) among the utility wares. Plain ware vessels, primarily bowls and carinated
bowls, are also well represented in Late Caddo ceramic assemblages.

Close stylistic similarities in funerary and domestic vessel and sherd assemblages imply
close social interaction. Close social interaction represents âintermarriage, economic
exchange, [and] joint participation in ceremonies and visitationâ between different Caddo
groups (Thurmond 1990a:222). Fields and Gadus (2012:674) nicely state the case that:
the similarities in the pottery represent a single shared ceramic tradition among
multiple closely related groups of people. The differences relate to variable
preferences for how to construct motifs that reflected widely held beliefs, with
some apparently intended to convey information about identity at the community,
lineage, or family level.
Titus phase ceramic assemblages in the Big Cypress Creek basin are quite diverse, with a
wide range of both engraved fine wares and utility ware vessels of many shapes and sizes
to meet everyday and ritual needs of the Caddo peoples. This diversity also extends to
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. 289

Chapter 8

the range of stylistic motifs employed on the most prevalent typeâRipley Engravedâas 11
distinct rim motifs have been defined just on the carinated bowls, bowls, and compound
bowls (see Figure 8-9aâk). It is likely that concerted study of documented vessel collections
in the basin will identify other distinctive rim motifs. Furthermore, Ripley Engraved bottles
may have even more diverse body decorations than the bowls, but specific decorative
varieties have yet to be comprehensively defined (but see Gadus 2013), due at least in
part to the stylistic complexity and uniqueness of many of the engraved motifs on bottles.
This stylistic and functional diversity in Titus phase ceramics is a counterpoint to the social
and cultural diversity that probably existed among these ancestral Caddo groups. The Titus
phase itself is of sufficient geographic area (see Figure 8-1) and time depth (ca. 250
years, from ca. AD 1430â1680) that it must encapsulate a number of distinctive sociocultural groups, not a single Caddo group. These groups or local communities were likely
related and/or affiliated by kinship, marriage, and social interaction. Thus, the ceramics
from generally contemporaneous Titus phase sites in the heart of the Big Cypress Creek
basin (i.e. a Big Cypress Creek heartland, see Fields and Gadus 2012:Figures 9.11â9.14)
provide an excellent avenue for addressing questions of interaction and social affiliations
among the many likely different Late Caddo groups, including those that lived at the
Kitchen Branch and Keering sites. The vessel and sherd data to be considered next rather
firmly establishes the character of the cultural and material culture landscape that existed
after ca. AD 1430 in much of the Big Cypress Creek basin.
The vessel assemblages (n=1243 vessels) from nine different Titus phase cemeteries in
the local region around the Kitchen Branch site (Table 8-20), as well as a broader range
of 13 other cemeteries (with 1341 vessels) in Franklin, Hopkins, Harrison, Morris, Titus,
and Upshur counties (see Perttula and Sherman 2009:Table 17-4) indicate that there are
clear spatial differences in the types and proportions of both fine wares, utility wares, and
plain wares from east to west across the better part of the Big Cypress Creek basin (Figure
8-30a). Although there are some spatial overlaps in vessel assemblages, the primary
spatial division in vessel assemblage character apparently lay along the Prairie Creek and
Greasy Creek basins. The westernmost Titus phase ceramic assemblages (A and B on
Figure 8-29a) includes the area along Big Cypress Creek and its tributaries from Prairie
Creek north and west to the headwaters of the basin in the Lake Bob Sandlin area, and
likely includes the upper reaches of the White Oak Creek basin. Sites that are part of these
western Titus phase ceramic traditions include J. E. Galt (41FK2) and Mattie Gandy (41FK4)
in Franklin County; Tuck Carpenter (41CP5), Johns (41CP12), Harold Williams (41CP10),
Lower Peach Orchard (41CP17), Horton (41CP20), and Pilgrimâs Pride (41CP304) in Camp
County; and A. P. Williams (41TT4), Thomas Caldwell (41TT6), Mockingbird (41TT550), and
Ear Spool (41TT653) in Titus County; and the W. O. Reed (41UR1) site in Upshur County.
The eastern ceramic tradition within the Titus phase based on the proportion of different
types of funerary vessels includes sites south of Prairie Creek and in the Big Cypress Creek
basin downstream to the Lake Oâ the Pines area (area C on Figure 8-29a). Important sites
include P.S. Cash (41CP2) and Shelby (41CP71) in Camp County; H. R. Taylor (41HS3) in

Harrison County; Ben McKinney (41MR12) in Marion County; R. L. Cason (41MX1), Joe
Justiss (41MX2), and the Harold Nix sites in Morris County; the W-S site (41TT741) in Titus
County; and the J. M. Riley (41UR2) site in Upshur County (see Table 8-18 and Perttula and
Sherman 2009:Table 17-4). The Russell Brothers Farm (41TT7) on Big Cypress Creek has
features of both the western and eastern ceramic traditions (see Perttula and Sherman
2009:Table 17-4).
The two broad ceramic traditions of the Titus phase within the Big Cypress Creek basin are
dominated by Ripley Engraved, as it accounts for between 37â61 percent of the vessels
from these 23 cemeteries; most of these are carinated bowls and compound bowls, but
there are also bottles and jars. Other important fine wares include Wilder Engraved vessels
(principally bottles) and Taylor Engraved carinated bowls and bottles. Avery Engraved
vessels account for just under 1 percent of the vessels in these cemeteries, but these
trade wares from McCurtain phase Caddo groups are found primarily in the western sites
(see Table 8-19 and Perttula and Sherman 2009:Table 17-4). Conversely, other trade fine
wares like Glassell Engraved, Belcher Engraved, Bailey Engraved, and Bowie Engraved
from Belcher phase and Texarkana phase Caddo groups to the east (cf. Webb 1959; Kelley
2012) comprise 2 percent of the vessels, primarily from eastern ceramic tradition Titus
phase sites (see Table 8-19 and Perttula and Sherman 2009:Table 17-4).
Among the utility wares, untyped utility jars (those with an assortment of simple punctated,
incised, brushed, and appliqued decorations on the rim and/or the body of vessels) are
abundant, accounting for 10 percent of the vessels, while other common types include
Harleton Appliqued (4.3 percent), Bullard Brushed (4.4 percent), La Rue Neck Banded
(2.3 percent), Maydelle Incised (1.9 percent), and Karnack Brushed-Incised (1.3 percent).
Plain vessels in a variety of forms, but most notably bowls and carinated bowls, comprise
a significant portion (7 percent) of the vessels from these Titus phase cemeteries. The
highest proportions of plain wares (14.2â28.1 percent) are in the Harold Williams (41CP10)
and Pilgrimâs Pride (41CP304) vessel assemblages in the western part of the Big Cypress
Creek basin (see Table 8-18 and Figure 8-30a).
In the most basic of terms, the western ceramic traditions of the Titus phase Caddo groups
in the Big Cypress Creek basin are marked by higher proportions of plain wares, untyped
utility ware jars (including rim punctated Mockingbird Punctated vessels, see Perttula et al.
1998; see also Suhm and Jelks [1962:Plate 79dâk] for other minimally decorated jars in
Titus phase sites), and La Rue Neck Banded in the utility wares, and Ripley Engraved vessels
with the scroll, continuous scroll, scroll and semi-circle, horizontal diamond, and bisected
diamond motifs. Titus phase sites outside of the Big Cypress Creek basin (e.g., sites in the
upper Sabine and White Oak Creek basins) also have many attributes of the western Titus
phase ceramic tradition. Eastern Titus phase ceramic tradition sites in the Big Cypress
Creek basin, downstream from Prairie Creek, have proportionally more Harleton Appliqued
vessels in the utility wares, as well as more Bullard Brushed and Karnack Brushed-Incised
jars. In the Ripley Engraved vessels, the principal motifs include the pendant triangle (which

also appears to occur in post-ca. AD 1550/1600 sites in much of the basin and in the Little
Cypress Creek basin, see Perttula [2006b] and Perttula et al. [2012aâb]). At the Shelby
site in the Greasy Creek basin (see Mitchell 2000; Perttula, Marceaux, and Nelson 2012),
the pendant triangle motif is the principal engraved motif on Ripley Engraved vessels,
accounting for at least 35 percent of the vessels with identifiable motifs. By contrast, at
the Johns site in the Prairie Creek basin, Ripley Engraved vessels with the pendant triangle
motif comprise only 7.7 percent of the vessel assemblage (Perttula et al. 2010b:Table 12).
Other important fine wares in the eastern tradition sites include Taylor Engraved and Bailey
Engraved (see Table 8-18 and Perttula and Sherman 2009:Table 17-4). In general, the
eastern ceramic tradition Titus phase sites contain more trade wares from Belcher phase
Caddo groups that lived to the east along the Red River below the Great Bend (including
Belcher Ridged utility wares), while trade wares in the western ceramic tradition Titus
phase sites are more commonly from McCurtain phase Caddo groups living along the
middle reaches of the Red River.
Within the Big Cypress Creek basin, the east-west dichotomy in the character of vessel
assemblages runs between the Prairie and Greasy Creek valleys (see Figure 8-30a), and
two different spatial clusters of assemblages (A and B on Figure 8-30a) are recognizable
in the western part of the basin. These differences, although subtle, are apparent in
several different respects. First, Bailey Engraved vessels are found in funerary contexts
in spatial cluster C on Figure 8-30a, as well as at the Johns site (see Table 8-19), but in
no other western ceramic tradition cemetery. Second, spatial trends in the proportion of
Ripley Engraved carinated bowls basically follow the AâC clusters, with an ever increasing
proportion from west to east, with the highest proportions in the Greasy Creek valley
sites and the J. M. Riley cemetery (see Table 8-19). Third, the relative proportions of
Ripley Engraved compound bowls follow the Prairie Creek-Greasy Creek dichotomy, but
with the highest proportions in cemeteries north and west of Prairie Creek. Fourth, the
highest proportions of Wilder Engraved vessels occur in spatial cluster A, with a gradual
diminishment in cemeteries to the east and southeast (spatial clusters B and C). Fifth,
in the case of other engraved wares in Big Cypress Creek basin sites (see Table 8-18),
many of them trade wares, the highest proportions (>6.7 percent) occur in Greasy Creek
cemeteries (spatial cluster C), while these other engraved wares comprise less than 5.8
percent of the vessel assemblages in the western spatial clusters A and B. Sixth, special
vessels (i.e. effigy bowls, noded bowls, and chalices) are relatively abundant only in spatial
cluster B cemeteries, particularly at the Harold Williams (6.1 percent) and Tuck Carpenter
(3.8 percent) cemeteries in the Dry Creek valley (see Table 8-18). Seventh, while utility
wares are relatively common in cemetery vessel assemblages across the Big Cypress Creek
basin, the highest proportions occur in two cemeteries in spatial cluster A (29.7â31.7
percent in the P. S. Cash and Shelby sites) and in one cemetery in spatial cluster C (34.3
percent at the Lower Peach Orchard site at Lake Bob Sandlin). Lastly, there is a clear
spatial dichotomy between cemeteries west and north of Prairie Creek and cemeteries in
the Greasy Creek valley in the overall proportion of plain vessels, with the greatest relative
frequency of plain ware funerary offerings (>6 percent) to the west and north of Prairie

Chapter 8

Creek (spatial clusters A and B on Figure 8-30a), and less than 3 percent in the Greasy
Creek valley (spatial cluster C on Figure 8-29a).
Decorated sherd assemblages across the Big Cypress Creek basin (Table 8-21), and in
a broad suite of assemblages from the upper Sabine and White Oak Creek basins (see
Perttula and Sherman 2009:Table 17-5) also have considerable differences from east
to west (see Figure 8-30b), with some additional diversity gleaned from the large sherd
samples. These differences are particularly evident in the proportions of brushed pottery,
neck banded wares, red-slipped fine wares, and the percentages of wet paste decorated
pottery between spatial clusters A, B, C, and D in the Big Cypress Creek basin. As with
the vessels, the basic spatial dichotomy in decorated sherd assemblage character runs
between the Prairie and Greasy Creek valleys.
Brushed pottery is much more common in eastern ceramic tradition sites in the Big Cypress
Creek basin than it is in the western Titus phase ceramic tradition, accounting for more
than 70 percent of all of the decorated sherds in sites such as Isadore Segal (41MR1),
Whelan (41MR2), Sam Gray #2 (41UR14), and Chastain (41UR18) in the lower reaches of
Big Cypress Creek at Lake Oâ the Pines (see Table 8-19) in spatial cluster A on Figure 8-30b.
At the Isadore Segal site, more than 85 percent of the decorated sherds are brushed.
Other Titus phase sites in the Prairie Creek and Greasy Creek valleys (see spatial cluster
B on Figure 8-30b) have assemblages where brushed sherds range from 43â61 percent
of the decorated wares: Sam Roberts (45.6 percent), Keering (42.6 percent), and Kitchen
Branch (55.6 percent) in the Prairie Creek valley, and Shelby Mound (60.7 percent) in the
Greasy Creek valley (see Table 8-19). In sites such as Ear Spool; Pilgrimâs Pride; Linebarger
(41CP493); Lasco (41UR106); and 41UR118 on Little Cypress Creek (see Parsons 2011);
and sites on Big Cypress Creek at Lake Bob Sandlin (i.e. Underwood, Turtle Pond, and
Gopher Run, see Perttula and Sherman 2009:Table 17-5), brushed sherds account for
35â48 percent of the decorated wares. On the other hand, in the very upper reaches
of the Big Cypress Creek basin and in Titus phase sites in the upper Sabine River basin,
brushed pottery represents no more than 1â14 percent of the decorated sherds, while
neck banded La Rue Neck Banded pottery is quite a bit more abundant in these western
ceramic tradition sites than it is in eastern ceramic tradition sites (see Table 8-19 and
Perttula and Sherman 2009:Table 17-5).
In sites such as 41WD51 and Steck (41WD529), 14.5â25.5 percent of all the decorated
pottery in Titus phase components is neck banded, and 4.3 percent of the sherds at the
Burks site (41WD52) are neck banded (Perttula 2005:Table 1), compared to less than
1 percent in Lake Oâ the Pines sites such as Dalton, Sam Gray #2, Whelan, and Isadore
Segal (see Table 8-19). Even in the western ceramic tradition sites, neck banded pottery is
not always that common however. Neck banded sherds account for only 0.2 percent of the
decorated sherds from the Kitchen Branch site, and there were no neck banded sherds in
the Keering site ceramic assemblage. Sites at Lake Bob Sandlin, the Tom Hanks mound
site (41CP239), and the Pilgrimâs Pride site have neck banded sherd percentages that
range from only 0.4 to 5.5 percent of all the decorated pottery (spatial clusters C and D on

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

Figure 8-30b). At the Ear Spool site in the White Oak Creek basin to the north, 1.3 percent
of the decorated sherds are neck banded. In fact, outside of the upper Sabine River basin
sites and the Underwood site (41CP230) at Lake Bob Sandlin (see Table 8-19 and Perttula
and Sherman 2009:Table 17-5), neck banded pottery is rare in other Titus phase domestic
contexts.
Simple appliqued vessels (probably of the McKinney Plain type) are also uniquely well
represented in the upper Sabine River basin sites, accounting for 5.2â24 percent of the
decorated sherds at 41WD51, Steck, and Burks (see Perttula and Sherman 2009:Table
17-5), as well as seven percent of the decorated sherds at 41UR136 in the upper basin
of Little Cypress Creek. Elsewhere in Titus phase sites in the Big and Little Cypress Creek
basins, appliqued sherds from domestic contexts comprise only between 0.1â4.4 percent
of the decorated wares (see Table 8-19 and Perttula and Sherman 2009:Table 17-5). The
highest concentrations of appliqued vessel sherds occur in sites in the upper Dry Creek
and Prairie Creek valleys, in spatial cluster C on Figure 8-29b. Among other utility wares,
incised and punctated wet paste utility ware sherds are more prevalent in spatial clusters
C and D (see Figure 8-29b) in western Titus phase ceramic tradition sites in the Big Cypress
Creek basin, particularly in sites throughout the Prairie Creek valley like Keering and Sam
Roberts (see Table 8-19).
Plain red-slipped vessels (typically bowls and carinated bowls) are another distinctive
aspect of many of the sites in the western Titus phase ceramic tradition. It accounts for
16.9â24.3 percent of the decorated sherds from sites along Dry and Little Dry Creek in the
upper Sabine River basin (see Perttula and Sherman 2009:Table 17-5), 13.4 percent of the
sherds from the Underwood site at Lake Bob Sandlin on Big Cypress Creek, and 5.8â7.2
percent of the decorated sherds at the Ear Spool and Pilgrimâs Pride sites, respectively
(see Table 8-19). In Middle Caddo period times, sites in these same areas had red-slipped
wares in abundance (see Nelson and Turner 1997; Perttula and Cruse 1997). None of
the eastern Titus phase ceramic tradition sites listed in Table 8-19 have more than 3â5.4
percent red-slipped sherds, and usually much less than 5 percent. No more than 3 percent
of the decorated sherds in Titus phase components at Lake Oâ the Pines are from redslipped vessels. The Prairie Creek Titus phase sites have only between 2.0â2.6 percent
red-slipped sherds (see Table 8-19). The highest proportions of red-slipped pottery sherds
are found in spatial cluster D sites on Figure 8-30b.
Because the same pottery types and methods of decorative treatment are represented
in the Titus phase sites, and all are seemingly dominated by Ripley Engraved vessels,
the decorated sherd assemblages from different Titus phase sites in the Big Cypress
Creek basin look at first glance relatively homogeneous from one to another. However,
detailed comparisons of the proportions of the different types and the different decorative
methods belie that homogeneity, and point instead to considerable local and intra-areal
diversity in: (1) the use of brushed and neck banded utility wares from east to west by
contemporaneous Caddo peoples; (2) the reliance on wet-paste decorations in western
tradition Titus phase sites, especially those on Little Cypress and White Oak creeks and
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. 299

Chapter 8

sites west and north of Prairie Creek (spatial clusters C and D on Figure 8-30b); and (3)
the manufacture of red-slipped vessels as another kind of distinctive fine ware for some
western tradition Titus phase Caddo to use in the serving of foods and liquids. All these
differences as well as similarities, in conjunction with similar information from whole vessel
assemblages, provide good clues to the stylistic and cultural affiliations of the different
Titus phase communities in East Texas.
In summary, the decorated sherd assemblages from Titus phase sites and components
in the Big Cypress Creek basin in East Texas (see Figure 8-30b) manifest local and intraareal diversity in the manufacture and use of brushed utility wares, a reliance on certain
kinds of wet paste decorations (i.e. incised, punctated, incised-punctated, appliqued,
etc.), and the manufacture of red-slipped fine wares, but they share many aspects of a
recognized and overarching ceramic tradition. Much of this diversity has east-west and
north-south trends, and there may be temporal trends as well in the manufacture and use
of the different wares (including the plain wares, see Table 8-18). The ceramic attribute
information compiled in Table 8-19 suggests that the Kitchen Branch Caddo component
is most closely affiliatedâon ceramic terms, and probably just as likely on socio-political
termsâwith Caddo peoples that lived in the Prairie and Dry Creek valleys within the Big
Cypress Creek basin (see area C on Figure 8-30b).
These basic differences within and between the eastern and western ceramic traditions of
the Titus phase in the Big Cypress Creek heartland in the kind and proportion of fine wares,
utility wares, and plain wares in funerary contexts strongly suggests a dichotomy in belief
and cultural practices between the eastern and western Titus phase Caddo groups, as well
as in styles of expression, that was of long standing (i.e. 150â200 years or more, and at
least 7â10 generations). That dichotomy further implies that there were well-defined social
boundaries between the different Titus phase political communities in the Big Cypress
Creek basin (and other parts of Northeast Texas inhabited by Titus phase groups), and
that the cultural landscape was complex and dynamic. The spatial differences in vessel
assemblages and domestic sherd assemblages (see Figures 8-30aâb) closely track the
spatial distribution and extent of the different Titus phase political communities (defined
on the basis of mound sites, community cemeteries, and cemeteries with the burial of
individuals of presumed high social rank) defined in the Big Cypress Creek basin (see
Figure 2-5). Nevertheless, the sharing of a variety of Ripley Engraved motifs on bowls and
bottles across the many different communities, and the basic similarity in much of the
utility wares from one area to another, point to considerable inter-areal interaction and
contact between each of the Titus phase communities.
In the Big Cypress Creek basin, the plain to decorated sherd ratios (P/DR) and proportion
of brushed sherds in decorated sherd assemblages further situate the Caddo occupations
at both the Kitchen Branch and Keering sites both temporally and geospatially, as did
the consideration of decorated sherd assemblages summarized above in Table 8-20. The
assemblages listed in Table 8-22 (see also Figure 8-27) indicate that through time, brushed
pottery becomes an important decorative component in the utility wares, the proportion
300 AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

of brushed pottery appears to increase through time, and greater proportions of sherds in
different assemblages tend to be decorated versus those that are plain: this suggests that
through time more Caddo vessels become decorated on both the rim and the body.
Pre-AD 1200 components in the Big Cypress Creek basin have decorated ceramics where
brushed surfaces are virtually absent (see Table 8-20). P/DR ratios range from 2.59â5.96,
with a mean of 4.28. After ca. AD 1200, and perhaps not until after ca. AD 1250 or a
bit later (see discussion in Perttula and Ellis 2012:201â208 and Table 8-24), brushing
of vessel bodies and rims becomes one of the more dominant decorative techniques,
occurring in frequencies between 10â43 percent. P/DR ratios on Middle Caddo sites in
the Big Cypress Creek basin range from 0.98â2.61, with a mean of 1.89 (see Table 8-21).

Continuing with the trend in manufacture and use of brushed pottery as an important part
of Caddo ceramic assemblages, after ca. AD 1400, in Late Caddo assemblages in this
part of the Big Cypress Creek basin brushed pottery comprises between 41â76 percent of
the decorated sherds (see Table 8-21), with an east to west spatial trend in the frequency
of brushing. P/DR values range from 0.57â1.48, with a mean P/DR value for these sites
and components of 0.95. Given the aforementioned spatial trends and the location of
the Keering and Kitchen Branch sites in different parts of the Big Cypress Creek basin
(Keering being situated well to the west of the Kitchen Branch site and farther removed
from the main channel of Big Cypress Creek), both the Keering and Kitchen Branch sites
have P/DR values and relative proportions of brushed sherds consistent with Late Caddo
period components, although one component may be earlier than the other, or they belong
to different local communities. These findings overall find further support in the character
of the identified decorative elements and motifs in each siteâs utility wares and fine wares
(see above for the Kitchen Branch site, and Chapter 14, this volume).
Prairie Creek Caddo Ceramic Tradition
As the previous discussion of local and regional similarities and differences in ceramic
vessel and domestic sherd assemblages from the Big Cypress Creek heartland of the
Titus phase have made clear, there are east to west differences in the character of fine
wares, utility wares, and plain wares across the basin. In spatial terms, these differences
lie between the Prairie Creek valley and contemporaneous sites to the north and west and
Titus phase sites in the Greasy Creek valley and points to the south and southeast in the
Lake Oâ the Pines area (see Figure 8-29a-b). More specific characterizations of the kinds of
utility wares and fine wares from both domestic and funerary contexts in the Prairie Creek
valley suggest that there is a 15th-17th century Prairie Creek Caddo ceramic tradition
that can be distinguished from the ceramic traditions of its Late Caddo neighbors in the
Big Cypress Creek basin. By ceramic tradition, I mean a single, coherent, community of
technological and stylistic practice (specific to both domestic and funerary contexts of use)
specific to the Caddo peoples of this area. This tradition is considered to be consistent with
a broad unity in culture and material culture production, as well as a shared native history,
one developed through centuries of intermarriage, trade, transmission of learning, and
other kinds of reciprocal relationships.
The domestic assemblages of ceramics from Prairie Creek Late Caddo sites are
characterized by the tempering of local clays with grog (crushed sherds), with between
85.5â97.0 percent of the sherds from the Keering, Kitchen Branch, and Sam Roberts
sites derived from vessels made with grog temper. The clay-temper recipes employed
by Prairie Creek Caddo potters also relied on other temper mixtures with grog, including
burned bone (5.0â30.4 percent, with higher proportions in the utility wares and plain
wares) and hematite (4.6â14.1 percent, also with higher proportions of its use seen in the
utility wares and plain wares), and the various recipes were apparently selected for use in
the manufacture of vessels of different forms, sizes, and functions that were employed in
cooking, storage, food serving, holding liquids, as well as more esoteric uses (i.e. pigment
302 AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

vessels and effigy vessels). Some vessels have rim peaks and strap handles. The vessels
from funerary contexts at the Johns site (41CP12) in the upper Prairie Creek valley exhibit
the same temper-clay practices as the assemblages from domestic contexts, with a reliance
on grog temper (88.9â96.8 percent by ware), with secondary but important selection of
burned bone (32.1â44.4 percent) and hematite (8.3.â16.7 percent) as tempers (Perttula
et al. 2010b).
The use of sandy alluvial clays were an important feature of Prairie Creek Caddo ceramic
manufacture, based on the considerable proportion of sandy paste sherds in the domestic
sherd assemblages from the Keering and Kitchen Branch sites: 26.9â45.2 percent of
the sherds, with the highest relative frequencies in the utility wares and plain wares.
Petrographic analysis and instrumental neutron activation analysis indicate that the sandy
clays frequently used in vessel manufacture were locally obtained in the Prairie Creek valley,
most likely within a short distance from farmsteads and hamlet compounds dispersed
throughout the valley. Other kinds of clays were also selected for vessel manufacture,
based on the proportions of sherds with a clayey to silty paste, and in fact in the Johns site
funerary vessels, only 8.3â16.7 percent were made with a naturally sandy alluvial clay.
Prairie Creek Caddo potters likely fired their vessels in an open surface fire with a fire break
around itâregardless of the wareâin a low oxygen or reducing environment, probably at
temperatures exceeding 700 degrees F, and in a well-controlled and predictable manner.
This produced hard and rather durable vessels, either with a dark grayish-brown to black
color (when fired and cooled in a reducing environment) or vessels with thin oxidized
brown to yellowish-brown colors at the surface and in thin lens in vessel cores (when fired
in a reducing environment, but cooled in the open air). Between 18.0â31.3 percent of
the sherds from the Keering and Kitchen Branch assemblages are from vessels fired and
cooled in a reducing environment, compared to 55.7â60.6 percent of the sherds deriving
from vessels fired in a reducing environment, and then cooled in the open air. In all, between
74.5â90.7 percent of the sherds in these two domestic assemblages were from vessels
fired in a reducing environment. In the Johns site funevrary vessel assemblage, more than
78â87 percent of the vessels by ware were fired in a reducing environment. Vessels fired
in an oxidizing or incompletely oxidizing environment comprise a distinct minority of the
sherd and vessel assemblages in the Prairie Caddo sites, and less than three percent
evidence poorly controlled firing or vessel sooting/smudging/refiring.
The stylistic character of the Late Caddo Prairie Creek ceramic assemblages is also
distinctive with a wide variety of decorative methods and elements on utility wares and
fine wares. Relying on the proportion of rims from the different wares, in domestic contexts
utility wares comprise between 46â52 percent of assemblages from the Keering and
Kitchen Branch sites, followed by plain wares (29â36 percent, including bowls, bottles,
and jars), then fine wares (18â19 percent). At any one time, perhaps 20â30 different
vessels of these three wares were in use in domestic farmstead compounds.

AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. 303

Chapter 8

Utility wares include many different combinations of decorative methods, including
brushing, punctation, applique, incision, neck banding, pinching, and noding. Rarely does a
utility ware vessel only have one form of decoration, either on the rim and/or on the vessel
body. Vessels with brushing (either as the sole decorative method or in combination with
other decorations) are predominant in the Prairie Creek utility wares, along with vessels
having punctated, appliqued, or incised decorations. The relative frequency of brushed
ceramic vessels is intermediate between sites in the Greasy Creek valley and points south
in the Big Cypress Creek basin and sites in the Dry Creek valley and points west in the
basin (see Figure 8-29b). The principal utility ware types include Bullard Brushed, La Rue
Neck Banded, and Harleton Appliqued, with moderate amounts of Pease Brushed-Incised,
Mockingbird Punctated, and Maydelle Incised. It is likely that these five types are resident
utility wares for the Caddo communities living in the Prairie Creek valley. Karnack BrushedIncised, Moore Noded, and Belcher Ridged, var. Byram Ferry, may be trade wares from
Belcher phase Caddo groups that lived to the east along the Red River below the Great
Bend (Webb 1959; Girard 2007).
The fine wares on Prairie Creek Caddo sites are dominated by a number of varieties
of Ripley Engravedâno one variety predominantâand this type comprises much of the
engraved fine wares from the sites. Other resident engraved types include varieties of
Turner Engraved, a new type, Wilder Engraved, and Johns Engraved. Three other engraved
fine ware typesâBailey Engraved, Simms Engraved, and Taylor Engravedâmay be trade
wares from Belcher phase Caddo groups that lived to the east along the Red River below
the Great Bend. It is not clear if Hood Engraved, defined from Frankston phase vessel
assemblages in the upper Neches River basin in East Texas (Perttula et al. 2011), is a
local and resident engraved fine ware type in the Prairie Creek Caddo sites; no chemical or
petrographic analyses have been conducted to determine this.
The Ripley Engraved motifs that are best represented in the Prairie Creek Caddo sites
include those with slanting scrolls, circles, semi-circles, and continuous scrolls, with
hatched and cross-hatched scroll dividers and brackets in scroll fill zones (see Figure
8-9bâd, f). Nested triangle, pendant triangle, and interlocking horizontal scroll motifs (see
Figure 8-9a, e, g) are present in low frequencies.
In an iconographic sense, as elaborated by Fields and Gadus (2012:505â520), the fine
ware vessels made by the Prairie Creek Caddo for food service in domestic contexts as
well as funerary offerings in burial rituals were apparently intended to convey through
symbolic messages beliefs in the cosmos and the structure of the world, as well as the
communityâs distinct social identity. The Prairie Creek Caddo apparently believed in
a world with multiple realms (i.e. the lower or below World realm, the middle realm of
everyday life and actions, and the upper world or celestial realm), defined by sacred poles
or axis mundi that connected the realms, and where vessel motifs were repeated four
times to represent the four quarters of the world (Fields and Gadus 2012:507). The scroll
motif on engraved vessels âtakes on the structure of a center with four quartersâ (Fields
and Gadus 2012:507), with the central element of the scrollâsuch as a circle or a cross
304 AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

within a circleârepresenting that center of the world. Much of the action expressed in the
engraved motifs on vessels, both carinated bowls, compound bowls, and bottles on Prairie
Creek Caddo sites is taking place in the upper world or the middle world of everyday life,
coming from the suggestion that scrolls with central circle elements are âan analog for the
ground line or Caddo dance ground, i.e. the path around the axis mundiâ (Fields and Gadus
2012:509). Some of the engraved motifs, including pendant triangles, serpentine bars, and
cross-hatching âmay represent actors or actions taking place in the middle worldâ (Fields
and Gadus 2012:514), but these motifs are relatively rare in Prairie Creek Caddo ceramic
assemblages compared to those in the Greasy Creek valley not far to the south, where
Ripley Engraved vessels with the pendant triangle motif (Ripley Engraved, var. McKinney)
are very common. Furthermore, representational images of engraved rattlesnakes, closely
linked with the underworld realm (Hart and Perttula 2010:219â222), are found in Late
Caddo Titus phase contexts in the Greasy Creek valley and other sites south and southeast
of the Prairie Creek Caddo communities (see Hart and Perttula 2010:Figure 2), but none
are known in any investigated Late Caddo Prairie Creek sites. These differences point to
different symbolic emphases and beliefs between Titus phase communities in the Big
Cypress Creek basin, and they further solidify the character of the post-early 15th century
Prairie Creek Caddo ceramic tradition.

Summary of the Kitchen Branch Ceramic Analysis
The analysis of the ceramic sherds from the Kitchen Branch site, as well as the consideration
of ceramic sherd and vessel assemblages from a number of sites in the Big Cypress
Creek basin, have identified the geo-spatially distinctive character of the 15th century
AD ceramics found in the Prairie Creek valley. The ceramics from these Late Caddo sites
in the Big Cypress Creek basin can be distinguished from each other in stylistic terms
(i.e. in the choices made in the decorations of utility wares and fine wares), and thus are
expressions of social identity and agency (i.e. marking the boundaries between different but
related populations or cultural lineages that shared certain levels of cultural transmission)
(Cochrane 2011:47), as well as in relations between Caddo peoples and material things.
This materiality (cf. Robb and Pauketat 2013:20, 22) can be seen in the kind and range
of ceramic vessels chosen or made to be placed as funerary offerings in the burials of
Caddo adults and children, as these vessels (from their crafting to their interment) lead to
a âweb of material things possessing a certain unity, directing the action of people within
it, and extending through space and time at a different scale from any individualâ (Robb
and Pauketat 2013:23) potterâs actions.
From these considerations, a distinctive Prairie Creek ceramic tradition has been identified
in the central part of the Big Cypress Creek basin (see Figures 8.29aâb). The Prairie Creek
ceramic tradition means a single, coherent, community of technological and stylistic
practices specific to the Caddo peoples of this area at a particular time, namely from ca.
AD 1430 to AD 1680. The predominant and key practice of Caddo potters living in this
part of the Big Cypress Creek basin was to make grog-tempered plain wares, utility wares,
and fine wares through time. Caddo potters in the region, and at the Kitchen Branch site,
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. 305

Chapter 8

had discovered centuries earlier the advantages of grog-tempered pastes through trial and
error, experience, and learned cultural behaviors. Using local clays tempered primarily with
grog, a wide variety of plain ware, utility ware, and fine ware vessels were manufactured,
including bottles, carinated bowls, compound bowls, simple bowls, and jars, with different
sizes, volumes, and uses. A significant proportion of the wares in domestic contexts are
from utility wares (46â52 percent of assemblages from the Keering and Kitchen Branch
sites), followed by plain wares (29â36 percent, including bowls, bottles, and jars), then
fine wares (18â19 percent).
There are clear decorative systems or design structures (cf. Rice 2013:21â23) evident in
the Late Caddo ceramic assemblages in the Big Cypress Creek basin, of which the Prairie
Creek ceramic tradition is a part, namely that âpottersâ¦had a fairly uniform and widely
shared set of ideas about what constituted pottery decoration regardless of their different
clay and temper resourcesâ (Rice 2013:21). Utility vessels tended to be decorated on
both the rim and body of jars, usually with different wet paste decorative methods on the
rim versus the body. Vessels with brushing (either as the sole decorative method or in
combination with other decorations) are predominant in the Prairie Creek utility wares,
especially as a form of body decoration, along with vessels having simple geometric or
straight lines/rows of punctated, appliqued, or incised decorations usually repeated on
the rim. Fine ware vessels are dominated by a number of varieties of Ripley Engravedâ
no one variety predominant. The Ripley Engraved motifs, with iconographic or ideational
meanings (cf. Fields and Gadus 2012; Gadus 2013), best represented in the Prairie Creek
Caddo sites include those with slanting scrolls, circles, semi-circles, and continuous scrolls
repeated four times around the vessel, with hatched and cross-hatched scroll dividers
and brackets in scroll fill zones. Other resident engraved types include varieties of Turner
Engraved with distinctive upper and low panel motifs on compound bowls, as well as
bottles of Ripley Engraved, Wilder Engraved, and Johns Engraved styles.

Research Design Issues
This section considers the broad findings of the Kitchen Branch ceramic analysis with
respect to issues developed in the research design for the project (see Chapter 4, this
volume). These issues concern the material, temporal, and spatial expressions of a
community of practice represented by the ceramic sherds and vessels in the Big Cypress
Creek basin archeological record generally, as well as more specifically at this one site
along Prairie Creek.
â¢ Refining or bracketing the age and intra-site chronological relationships of the
ceramics at the site, starting with the acquisition of radiocarbon and luminescence/
TL dates from features or archeological deposits, and investigating differences
and similarities in ceramic decoration and manufacture.
The distinctive stylistic character of the decorated ceramic sherds from the Kitchen Branch
site is consistent with a post-AD 1430 Late Caddo ceramic assemblage in the Big Cypress

Creek basin. This conclusion is predicated first on the importance of brushed utility ware
jars, and other utility wares decorated with incised, punctated, and appliqued rim and/or
body elements, from the Kitchen Branch site that are commonly recovered in domestic and
mortuary contexts at a wide range of sites in the basin, and secondly on the identification
of a number of rim and body sherds from Ripley Engraved in the fine wares from the site.
Ripley Engraved in its many varieties is recognized as the principal fine ware in Late Caddo,
Titus phase sites in the Big Cypress Creek, portions of the Sulphur River (e.g., Perttula and
Sherman 2009), and much of the upper and middle Sabine River basin in East Texas (see
Perttula 2012:Figure 13-1aâb).
There is nothing in the ceramic assemblage to suggest that there are multiple Late Caddo
period components at the Kitchen Branch site, or for that matter any pre-Late Caddo
occupations (other than six decorated sherds, see above), nor do the features argue
for multiple occupations during the Caddo era (i.e. ca. AD 800/850â1680). Rather, the
ceramic assemblage in the excavated areas appears to represent the product of a single
and short-term occupation by a Prairie Creek Caddo household. The radiocarbon dating of
organic remains as well as bulk organics in the paste of ceramic sherds from the Kitchen
Branch site are temporally wide-ranging and ambiguous at best (see discussion in Chapter
7, this volume). Nevertheless, the dates that fall in the median calibrated AD 1435â1488
group (n=6 dates, with age ranges that extend from AD 1396â1524 based on the range
of median calibrated dates and overlapping age ranges) are argued to represent the best
approximation for the age range of the principal ancestral Caddo component at the Kitchen
Branch site. This age range is most consistent with the stylistic character of the decorated
utility wares and fine wares from the site.
The TL dates from a sample of 20 ceramic sherds from the Kitchen Branch site are also
generally supportive of the previously mentioned radiocarbon dating results and the
ceramic stylistic analyses, in that a significant portion of the TL dates fall in a group with
a median age of AD 1461 + 52. These TL dates are indicative of the likelihood that the
age of the principal ancestral Caddo component at the site falls within the Late Caddo
period Titus phase. The other TL dates from the site are more ambiguous, given that one
of the dates is as early as AD 350, other dates are under- or overestimates, and others are
considered unreliable because of anomalous fading.
â¢ Place of the site in a local political community, based on comparisons of ceramic
decorative styles and technological styles from contemporaneous Titus phase
sites in the Prairie and Greasy Creek drainages within the Big Cypress Creek basin,
including Kitchen Branch, Horton, and the Keering site, along with geostatistical
comparisons of ceramic attributes.
Ceramic sherd and vessel assemblage comparisons between a number of Late Caddo Titus
phase sites in the Big Cypress Creek basin have made clear that there are distinctive spatial
differences in their composition (see Figure 8-29aâb), with a basic east-west dichotomy
in utility ware and fine ware decorative styles and in the kinds of vessel associations in
burial interments. These spatial differences in ceramic sherd and vessel assemblage
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. 307

Chapter 8

composition between contemporaneous sites has been suggested earlier in this chapter
to represent the spatial extent of socially distinct Caddo populations who nevertheless had
considerable interaction and cultural transmission.
This east-west ceramic spatial and stylistic dichotomy runs between the Prairie Creek
and Greasy Creek valleys. The western Caddo sites include both Prairie Creek sites like
Kitchen Branch, Sam Roberts (41CP8), and Johns (41CP12), as well as sites to the west
on Big Cypress Creek as far west as Lake Bob Sandlin, as well as sites on Dry Creek (i.e.
Tuck Carpenter and Harold Williams) and Walkers Creek (Pilgrimâs Pride and Horton sites).
Eastern Titus phases include those in the Greasy Creek valley and on Big Cypress Creek
and tributaries as far east as Lake Oâ the Pines (see Figure 2-5).
Perttula (2012:371; see Figure 2-5, this volume) had argued that one of the five Titus
phase political communities in the Big Cypress Creek basin was centered on the large
mound center, village, and community cemetery at the Shelby site (41CP71) on Greasy
Creek, and that âalso probably part of this particular Caddo community are the Titus phase
mound sites (single mounds) on Prairie Creekâ and Greasy Creek, including the P. S. Cash
(41CP2) and Sam Roberts site. The results of the ceramic sherd and vessel assemblage
comparisons discussed earlier in this chapter suggest instead that the Prairie Creek and
Greasy Creek sites are better interpreted as parts of separate political communitiesâeven
though they are only a few miles apart. In this scenario, the Shelby site is considered
the social and political center of the Greasy Creek political community, with a subsidiary
mound at the P. S. Cash site, and community cemeteries at the Shelby and Gold Star
Ballroom (41UR107) sites. Conversely, the social and political center of the Prairie Creek
political community is the Sam Roberts mound center and village (and probably the locus
of an as yet identified community cemetery). The Kitchen Branch site is only a few miles
upstream from the Sam Roberts site on Prairie Creek, and it represents one of likely many
permanent settlements that comprise part of clusters of contemporaneous small domestic
communities.
â¢ Identify the key choices and trends in the character of the production of domestic
ceramics from the site, including: use of raw materials; temper; methods of
manufacture; production areas; vessel forms and functions; vessel size; and firing.
Local alluvial and upland clays, often with a natural sandy paste, were selected by Caddo
potters that lived in the Prairie Creek valley for ceramic vessel manufacture of three different
wares: plain ware, utility ware, and fine wares. The clays were cleaned and refined, and
then various combinations or recipes of crushed grog, bone, and hematite pieces were
added to the clay. In most cases, grog was the preferred temper, but the different recipes
(i.e. kind of clay, as well as the coarseness and amount of temper added to the clay)
that were employed were specifically employed for vessels of different apparent uses and
sizes. Vessels were made with coils of clay that were built up on a foundation of a clay disk
base, with progressively thinner walls proceeding to the rim and lip, both of which received
different treatments depending upon the intended use of the vessels. Vessels that were
decorated were either decorated while the vessels were still wetâthe utility wares with
308 AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

incised, punctated, appliqued, and brushed decorations on rim and/or bodyâor after the
vessel was either leather-hard or fired (i.e. slipped and engraved fine wares). About 75
percent of the vessels made and used at the Kitchen Branch site were decorated. Given
the domestic context of the ceramic sherds found at the site, it is no surprise that almost
75 percent of the sherds are from utility ware vessels.
It is suspected that Caddo potters made and fired the vessels on-site, although there is
no direct evidence for production areas or pit fires at the Kitchen Branch site. Certainly it
would have been more labor-effective to gather suitable clays from the nearest clay sources
to the site that would have been found along Prairie Creek. Manufacture of the vessels
on-siteâperhaps in a less well used or trod part of the siteâwould also have allowed ready
space for vessels to dry after manufacture, the ability to check and observe the vessels
while they were drying, and also contribute by regular monitoring and observation to a
successful firing of vessels. Most of the sherds at the Kitchen Branch site are from vessels
from all three wares that were fired in a low oxygen or reducing environment, especially the
firing of a vessel in a low oxygen environment, but then pulling it from the fire to cool in the
open air. There are no significant differences in the conditions in which utility ware, plain
ware, and fine ware vessels were fired. Fine ware and plain wares were better made and
better fired (at least in terms of regulating the firing temperature), however, and they were
probably fired longer in a low oxygen environment than the utility wares. The Caddo potters
at the Kitchen Branch site likely exerted more control over the end product of fine ware and
plain ware vessel manufacture than they did with the utility wares, primarily to produce a
harder ceramic, although firing conditions were only slightly more heterogeneous among
the utility wares. Even so, this was likely the product of the multi-purpose nature of these
vessel forms, as they were used for cooking pots and storage containers. Utility wares
did not apparently need to be fired for as long a time as the harder fine wares to be quite
serviceable vessels.
The utility ware jars were well suited to the cooking and heating of foods and liquids. The
much thicker utility ware vessels (with rim thicknesses greater than 9 mm and body wall
thicknesses greater than 10â11 mm) would have created stronger and more stable vessels,
and would have been well suited for use as long-term storage containers. Fine wares were
probably intended for use in the serving of foods and liquids, and because they have
thinner and less porous vessel walls than the utility wares, this would have helped to better
contain served food and liquids; thinner and lighter vessels would have also contributed to
the ease with which serving vessels could be handled, used, and transported. Plain wares
probably had a mixture of uses, including both food serving as well as cooking and storage.
Residue studies (see Chapter 12, this volume) suggest that both domesticated and wild
plant foods were cooked and served in these ceramic wares.
Measurable orifice diameters for the different wares at the Kitchen Branch site suggest
that medium-sized plain jars and bowls were made and used, as well as plain bottles.
Fine ware rims are from carinated bowls and compound bowls, in a ratio of 3:1. Orifice
diameters ranged from 13â29 cm, indicating that medium to large sizes of these vessels
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. 309

Chapter 8

were made for both individual and multiple person communal food serving. Utility ware
vessels at the site range from small to large jars, which presumably relate to both family
and communal cooking needs; the mean diameter of these jars suggest the principal use
of these vessels was for family or individual household cooking needs.
â¢ Examine issues of style and social identity and changes in culinary traditions
as possible manifestations of changes in ceramic practice that occurred in this
particular region. Determine the character and frequency of the utility ware
vessel forms in Caddo components at the site. The proportion of utility wares,
and their composition at the estimated vessel (or minimum number of vessels as
determined from the analysis of the rim sherds) assemblage level, may be related
to (and influenced by) differences in culinary and plant food storage traditions as
well as the postulated intensification of maize consumption by Caddo groups.
In the Caddo household at the Kitchen Branch site, there would have been an impressive
diversity of vessel forms among both the fine wares and utility wares as well as the plain wares.
These kinds of ceramics were designed to serve different purposes within communities
and family groupsâfrom a cooking pot to the mortuary function of a ceremonial vesselâ
and this is reflected in differences in paste, surface treatment, firing methods, decoration,
and vessel form between the two wares. Ceramic vessels were important to the prehistoric
Caddo in the cooking and serving of foods and beverages, in the storage of foodstuffs,
as personal possessions, as beautiful works of art and craftsmanship (i.e. some vessels
were clearly made to never be used in domestic contexts), and as social identifiers; that
is, certain shared and distinctive stylistic motifs and decorative patterns marked closely
related communities and constituent groups. Utility wares are by far the most common
ware at the Kitchen Branch site, and this is also the case in domestic contexts at other Late
Caddo Titus phase sites throughout the Big Cypress Creek basin. At the Kitchen Branch
site, for example, more than 53 percent of the rim sherds are from utility wares, and more
than 85 percent of the decorated body sherds are from utility wares. There are 185 rim
and lower rim sherds from separate vessels in the assemblage.
Brushed utility wares in the Big Cypress Creek basin began to be manufactured by Caddo
potters after ca. AD 1200â1250, and came to dominate utility ware assemblages in this
region (and in many other parts of East Texas, including Caddo sites in the middle Sabine
River basin and the Neches-Angelina river basins) by the early 15th century AD. In locales
where brushed utility wares were made and used, their proportions continued to increase
through time, such that decorated sherd assemblages are known where more than 80
percent of all the decorated sherds are from jars with brushing on the vessel body and/
or the rim. Varying proportions of brushed utility ware sherds and vessels are one of the
primary ways in which we have been able to distinguish different Caddo population groups
and communities in the Big Cypress Creek basin, with the proportions of brushed wares
in assemblages in the Prairie Creek sites intermediate between Titus phase sites to the
east and downstream in the Big Cypress Creek basin and those to the west and upstream
in the basin.

After ca. AD 800â1000, in East Texas, domesticated plant foods and meats were probably
prepared with a cooking technology where foods were cooked and boiled in ceramic
vessels that set directly over or nestled in a fire. Ceramic jar sherds have charred residues
and sooting on them, evidence that they came from vessels placed directly in a fire during
cooking activities. Archeological evidence from Caddo sites in East Texas suggests that
these domesticated plant remains were nowhere common until after ca. AD 800, and in
the case of beans, they were not commonly grown until after ca. AD 1250. These Caddo
successfully grew maize and other cultigensâbeans and squash, with beans apparently
becoming important after ca. AD 1300âin varying quantities, and an important meal that
surely would have been prepared in the utility ware cooking vessels, at least after ca. AD
1250, was hominy. This was a gruel prepared with crushed corn kernels mixed with wood
ash, meat, and/or beans (Myers 2006:511). To make hominy, corn kernels were pounded
with wood ashes in a mortar, then sifted through a basket to winnow away chaff and corn
hulls, then mixed in a cooking jar with water and other ingredients for flavoring, and then
boiled for several hours to make a gruel or stew.
Stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes obtained from East Texas Caddo sites indicate that
that there was a considerable increase in maize and bean consumption beginning in
the Middle Caddo period (ca. AD 1200â1250), and the consumption of these cultigens
increased and intensified through time, even into the post-AD 1680 Historic Caddo period
(see Wilson 2012:112â115). The same trends are apparent in the manufacture and use
of brushed utility ware cooking jars in many parts of East Texas, including among many of
the Big Cypress Creek Caddo populations.
Given the importance of cooking jars in the cooking and boiling of cultigens like maize, and
the virtually ubiquitous decoration of cooking jars with brushed decorations on rims, but
especially on vessel bodies, a co-association can be suggested between increased maize
use by Caddo populations and the increased manufacture and use of brushed cooking jars;
in essence, it is possible to view brushed cooking jars in East Texas Caddo sites as a proxy
for maize use. Essentially, in addition to the distinctive stylistic characteristics of brushed
jars in post-15th century AD Caddo sites in the Big Cypress Creek basin (and elsewhere),
the manufacture of these exterior textured jars represented a significant technological and
performance improvement (cf. OâBrien et al. 1994; Pierce 2005) as cooking jars. With an
increased emphasis on cooking practices that featured extended boiling, textured cooking
jars would have made them easier to handle when hot, brushing on the body and rim
would have improved control over cooking by limiting boil overs, and body brushing would
have reduced thermal stresses associated with cooking use, thereby increasing their
durability and use-life (Pierce 2005:152â153). These same performance benefits may
also have pertained to neck banded pottery or other significant exterior textured vessels
used by other Titus phase groups (especially in the upper Big Cypress and upper Sabine
River basins).

â¢ Identify specific motifs on Titus phase fine ware vessels that may have iconographic
content, as a means to examine aspects of local Late Caddo belief systems and
social identity.
Ascribing ideational or iconographic meaning to the motifs on Caddo fine ware vessels is a
analytical practice in its infancy in Caddo ceramic studies (Dowd 2011; Early 2012; Fields
and Gadus 2012; Gadus 2010, 2013; Hart and Perttula 2010; Walters 2006), especially
when compared to studies of engraved shell and copper objects found on Caddo sites, most
notably at the Spiro and Sanders sites in the Arkansas and Red River basins (e.g., Brain
and Phillips 1995; Brown 2007, 2010; Brown and Kelly 2012; Brown and Rogers 1989;
Sievert et al. 2011). What can be said about the engraved motifs crafted for fine ware
vessels made by the Prairie Creek Caddo is that they were apparently intended to convey
through their symbolic messages the communityâs beliefs in the cosmos and the structure
of the world, as well as represent through material practice the communityâs distinct social
identity. The contents of these vessels, although unknown, may well have also represented
the relationships that existed between a network of people, life-sustaining foods, ritual use
(as in the consumption of the black drink or a peyote tea), and material things.
Previous research on Caddo iconography (as referenced above) suggests that Prairie
Creek Caddo believed in a world with multiple realms (i.e. the lower or below World realm,
the middle realm of everyday life and actions, and the upper world or celestial realm),
defined by sacred poles or axis mundi that connected the realms, and where vessel motifs
were repeated four times to represent the four quarters of the world. The scroll motif on
engraved vessels have a central element, with the quarters repeated four times, and the
central element of the scrollâsuch as a circle or a cross within a circleârepresented the
center of the world. The engraved motifs on vessels, both carinated bowls, compound
bowls, and bottles on Prairie Creek Caddo sites are suggested to take place in the upper
world or the middle world of everyday life, with is consistent with the use of many of the fine
ware vessels as food serving vessels. Other engraved motifsâincluding pendant triangles,
serpentine bars, and cross-hatchingâhave been suggested by Fields and Gadus (2012:514)
to be representations of actors or actions in the middle world, but such motifs are relatively
rare in Prairie Creek Caddo ceramic assemblages compared to those in the Greasy Creek
valley to the immediate south, where Ripley Engraved vessels with the pendant triangle
motif (Ripley Engraved, var. McKinney) are very common. Representational images of
engraved rattlesnakes, closely linked with the underworld realm, are found in Late Caddo
Titus phase contexts in the Greasy Creek valley and other sites south and southeast of
the Prairie Creek Caddo communities, but none are known in any investigated Late Caddo
Prairie Creek sites. These iconographic differences point to diverse symbolic emphases
and beliefs among Titus phase communities in the Big Cypress Creek basin.
â¢ The implications of ceramic sherd accumulation rates (see Varien 1999; Varien
and Ortman 2005), specifically the accumulation of utility ware sherds at the
Kitchen Branch site, given the suggestion that 4,000â8,000 grams of cooking
pot sherds would be accumulated per year on a site occupied by Native American

312 AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

farmers through breakage and use in a domestic context (see Varien 1999:Table
4.2).
At the Kitchen Branch site, a total of 1825 utility ware sherds have been recovered in
the testing and data recovery investigations. It is also estimated that 52 percent (n=926)
of the 1,780 plain body and base sherds found in the excavations are from utility ware
vessels, given the proportion of utility ware rims (52 percent) among all the rims recovered
at the site. Together, this indicates that there are approximately 2,751 utility ware sherds
in the Kitchen Branch ceramic assemblage. With a mean sherd weight of 3.80 g, the
total estimated weight of the utility ware sherds in the excavated area at the Kitchen
Branch is 10,454.0 g. This total weight, given Varienâs accumulation rate of utility ware
sherds, suggests that the utility ware sherds from the Kitchen Branch site accumulated in
approximately 1.3â2.6 years, during a residential/domestic occupation.
Is this a reasonable estimate for the length of the 15th century Caddo occupation at the
Kitchen Branch site? It is important to keep in mind that this estimate is not specific to the
length of the occupation at the Kitchen Branch site as a whole, given that the site is large
and much of it has never been investigated in more than a minimal reconnaissance fashion.
That being said, the estimated 1.3â2.6 years of occupation sometime in the 15th century
AD would pertain only to the one concentrated area of Caddo occupation that has been
investigated by testing and data recovery block excavations along the southeastern part of
the overall site. In this case, I find the estimate reasonable on several grounds, and thus,
the quantification of utility ware sherd weights appears to be a useful analytical method.
First, there appears to have been only one wood house structure built and occupied in
this part of the site, with little evidence of structure rebuilding and/or post replacement
because of rotting (see Chapter 6, this volume), and such wood structures likely would
have had at most a use-life of more than 10â20 years (see Good 1982:67â69; Fields
and Gadus 2012:278â279). And second, the density of ceramic sherds across the block
excavations is very low per square meter and cubic meter, much lower than from many
other Late Caddo domestic contexts in the Big Cypress Creek basin, suggesting an overall
low rate of vessel breakage and discard during the Kitchen Branch occupation. That in
turn is most likely the product of the short span of time in which this part of the site was
occupied as well as its likely use intensity. The reason or reasons the site was used for
such a short period of time is unknown.
â¢ Extend ceramic tradition comparisons by employing the decorated vessel sherds
to establish the stylistic, social, and community affiliations of the Caddo people
that lived at the Kitchen Branch site, and documenting the diversity in decorative
styles and technological attributes of both wares in the Kitchen Branch and other
contemporaneous Titus phase sites.
Comparisons made between ceramic sherd assemblages from contemporaneous Late
Caddo domestic contexts in the Big Cypress Creek basin as well as between the kind
and range of vessels placed in burials in Big Cypress Creek cemeteries has led to the
identification of a series of spatially distinct ceramic assemblages within the basin (see
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. 313

Chapter 8

Figure 8-30aâb). This in turn led to the identification of a 15thâ17th century Prairie Creek
Caddo ceramic tradition that can be distinguished from the ceramic traditions of its Late
Caddo neighbors in the Big Cypress Creek basin; the Kitchen Branch site is one of the
sites in this ceramic tradition. This ceramic tradition is the product of a community of
technological and stylistic practice specific to the Caddo peoples of this area, one that
developed through centuries of intermarriage, trade, transmission of learning, and other
kinds of reciprocal relationships.
In technological terms, the domestic assemblages of ceramics at Kitchen Branch and
other Prairie Creek Late Caddo sites are characterized by:
1. the tempering of local clays with grog (crushed sherds). The clay-temper
recipes employed by these Caddo potters also relied on other temper mixtures
with grog, including burned bone and hematite, and various paste-temper
recipes (at least eight different paste-temper groups, see Chapter 9, this
volume) were apparently selected for use in the manufacture of vessels of
different forms, sizes, and functions that were employed in cooking, storage,
food serving, holding liquids, as well as more esoteric uses (i.e. pigment
vessels and effigy vessels);
2. sandy alluvial clays were an important feature of ceramic manufacture.
Petrographic analysis and instrumental neutron activation analysis indicate
that the sandy clays frequently used in vessel manufacture were locally
obtained in the Prairie Creek valley, most likely within a short distance from
farmsteads and hamlet compounds dispersed throughout the valley; and
3. local Caddo potters generally fired their vessels in an open pit fire in a low
oxygen or reducing environment. This produced hard and rather durable
vessels, either with a dark grayish-brown to black color (when fired and
cooled in a reducing environment) or vessels with thin oxidized brown to
yellowish-brown colors at the surface and in thin lens in vessel cores (when
fired in a reducing environment, but cooled in the open air). Vessels fired in an
oxidizing or incompletely oxidizing environment comprise a distinct minority
of the sherd and vessel assemblages in the Prairie Caddo sites, and very few
evidence poorly controlled firing or vessel sooting/smudging/refiring.
On stylistic terms, the Kitchen Branch Caddo component is most closely affiliated with
Caddo peoples that lived in the Prairie and Dry Creek valleys within the Big Cypress Creek
basin or that lived in the valley itself. (see area C on Figure 8-29b). The stylistic character
of these ceramic assemblages is distinctive because of their wide variety of decorative
methods and elements on utility wares and fine wares:

314 AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

1. Utility wares include many different combinations of decorative methods,
including brushing, punctation, applique, incision, neck banding, pinching,
and noding. Rarely does a utility ware vessel only have one form of decoration,
either on the rim and/or on the vessel body. Vessels with brushing (either as
the sole decorative method or in combination with other decorations) are
predominant in the Prairie Creek utility wares, along with vessels having
punctated, appliqued, or incised decorations. The principal utility ware types
include Bullard Brushed, La Rue Neck Banded, and Harleton Appliqued, with
moderate amounts of Pease Brushed-Incised, Mockingbird Punctated, and
Maydelle Incised. It is likely that these five types are the resident utility wares
for the Caddo communities living in the Prairie Creek valley;
2. The local fine wares are dominated by a number of varieties of Ripley Engraved.
The Ripley Engraved motifs that are best represented in these Caddo sites
include those with slanting scrolls, circles, semi-circles, and continuous
scrolls, with hatched and cross-hatched scroll dividers and brackets in scroll
fill zones. Nested triangle, pendant triangle, and interlocking horizontal scroll
motifs are present in low frequencies. Other resident engraved types include
varieties of Turner Engraved, Wilder Engraved, and Johns Engraved; and
3. The fine ware vessels made by the Prairie Creek Caddo were for domestic use
as well as funerary rituals. They convey through symbolic messages beliefs
in the cosmos and the structure of the world, as well as the communityâs
distinct social identity. The Prairie Creek Caddo apparently believed in a
world with a lower or below World realm, the middle realm of everyday life
and actions, and the upper world or celestial realm. Fine ware vessel motifs
were repeated four times to represent the four quarters of the world, and
the central element of scroll motifs (i.e. a circle or a cross within a circle)
represented that center of the world. Much of the action expressed in the
engraved motifs on vessels, both carinated bowls, compound bowls, and
bottles on Prairie Creek Caddo sites is taking place in the upper world or the
middle world of everyday life. Representational images on engraved vessels
in Prairie Creek sites are restricted to bird imagery on Johns Engraved
vessels. Gadus (2013) suggests these birds, likely turkeys, represent middle
world imagery.
â¢ The recognition of discrete chemical compositional groups within the Prairie and
Greasy Creek locales and other locales within the Big Cypress Creek basin as the
basis for evaluating the extent and direction of local exchange, the existence of
craft specialists, and trade.
The instrumental neutron activation analysis of 18 ceramic sherds from the Kitchen Branch
site and 10 ceramic sherds from the Keering site (see Chapter 9) suggest that between
78â80 percent of the sherds are from vessels made with local Prairie Creek clays, and
conversely that 20â22 percent of the sampled sherds were from vessels made from clays
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. 315

Chapter 8

found outside of the Big Cypress Creek basin. These particular sherds are suggested to
have come from vessels made with clays in the middle and upper Sabine River basins as
well as the middle Red River basin.
The majority of the paste groups (paste groups 1â3, 5â9) defined in the petrographic work
(see Chapter 9) suggest that almost all of the sherds from the Kitchen Branch site and
the Keering site were from vessels made with local clays. These clays have a sandy paste
and the vessels were tempered with grog and/or bone; some of the paste groups have
detrital chert (78 percent from the Kitchen Branch site and 60 percent of the sherds from
the Keering site), a natural inclusion in many clays in the Big Cypress Creek basin (Perttula
et al. 1998:285). The petrographic analysis identified, however, several sherds from the
Kitchen Branch site (11 percent) and one from the Keering site (20 percent), as well as
a piece of daub, with igneous-derived materials in paste groups 4 and 10 (microline and
chlorite). Typically this would suggest that the paste groups are from non-local ceramic clay
sources, such as the widely outcropping Paleozoic rocks of the Llano Uplift of Central and
West Central Texas, or less commonly, perhaps, clays with stream-transported volcanic
rocks that may be found in deposits of the Brazos and Red rivers; both streams drain
sections of the Tertiary Ogallala formation in far western Texas and the Texas Panhandle,
which yields some igneous cobbles in its abundant unconsolidated deposits. Cecil (see
Chapter 9, this volume), however, suggests that these sherds may have come from vessels
whose clay had been processed with tools made from igneous stones, such that derived
igneous particles would become incorporated in the clay. No such igneous tools have been
identified in the ground stone tool assemblage from the Kitchen Branch site (see Chapter
11, this volume), and no clay processing igneous tools have been identified in any Caddo
sites in the Big Cypress Creek basin. Paste group 4 sherds also have feldspar particles,
which suggests that they may have come from vessels made in the Sulphur River basin,
since previous petrographic work by Reese-Taylor (1993, 1995) has commonly identified
feldspars in sites in the upper part of the basin, but not in contemporaneous ancestral
Caddo ceramic assemblages in the Big Cypress Creek basin.
Casting some doubt on the identification of some of the sherds as coming from non-local
clay sources is the fact that burned clay pieces from the Kitchen Branch site have been
identified in the INAA as coming from a non-local region: region 1 in the middle Red River
basin. Since it is expected that clay used to line hearths or pits, as well as to cover wall
thatching, would have been obtained from clay sources within the immediate proximity
to domestic areasâso as to limit the effort in obtaining and carrying back to the site
substantial amounts of clay for non-vessel useâit is dubious that the source of the clay in
the analyzed burned clay samples is the middle Red River basin, more than 70 miles to
the north of the Kitchen Branch site. This leaves other region 1 provenance identifications
(n=2 sherds) doubtful. The petrographic analyses of a burned clay sample linked it with a
local clay paste group (paste group 2).
Seldenâs (2013:Figures 2-34) recent reanalysis of the East Texas INAA database has
documented that there is considerable spatial diversity and variability in the proportions
316 AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

of rare earth elements in the clays used to manufacture Caddo ceramic vessels found
in the broader region, and within sherds found in sites in the Big Cypress Creek basin. In
comparisons between element concentrations, Prairie Creek ceramics can be spatially
differentiated readily between Greasy Creek, Lake Oâ the Pines, and upper Big Cypress (i.e.
Lake Bob Sandlin sites) sites based on the majority of elements (i.e. aluminum, antimony,
arsenic, barium, calcium, cerium, dysprosium, europium, hafnium, lanthanum, lutetium,
manganese, neodymium, nickel, potassium, samarium, sodium, strontium, tantalum,
terbium, titanium, ytterbium, zinc, and zirconium). Cerium, for example (Figure 8-31),
as well as samarium and terbium, has high concentrations in the Lake Oâ the Pines and
Greasy Creek areas, with increasingly lower concentrations from the Prairie Creek sites
north and west in the Big Cypress Creek basin, while exactly the opposite spatially discrete
distributions of rare earth elements is apparent in the case of titanium (Figure 8-32). These
differences point to the existence of clays with spatially different chemical compositions
between those in distinct tributary creek basins and clays in the main Big Cypress Creek
basin, with a principal spatial distinction resting between the Prairie Creek, Greasy Creek,
and Lake Oâ the Pines (mainstream Big Cypress Creek) localities. These are part of distinct
geospatial patterns that are now evident in the East Texas INAA (see further discussion in
Chapter 9).

Introduction
This chapter presents the findings of both instrumental neutron activation analysis
(INAA) and petrographic analysis of a select sample of decorated sherds from the Caddo
occupations at the Kitchen Branch site (Figure 9-1) and the Keering site (Figure 9-2). The
concluding section of the chapter provides a comparison of the results of both analyses,
as well as a discussion of the implications of the occurrence of apparently non-locally
obtained ceramic vessels at the site.

Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis of Ceramic and Burned Clay Samples from
the Kitchen Branch (41CP220) and Keering (41CP21) sites, Camp County, Texas
Jeffrey R. Ferguson and Michael D. Glascock
This section of Chapter 9 describes the preparation, analysis, and interpretation of 18
pottery and two burned clay samples from samples from the Kitchen Branch site and an
additional 10 ceramic samples from the Keering site (see Appendix 9-1 for elemental data
from all 30 INAA samples). The limited number of samples from these sites and lack of
patterned internal variability limits a detailed internal comparison, so the samples are
compared to the existing Caddo reference groups from East Texas and the entire University
of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR) ceramic database. All but three of the samples are
relatively uniform in composition and all fit the general pattern of the main core chemical
compositional group from the region.

Sample Preparation
Pottery samples were prepared for INAA using procedures standard at MURR. Fragments
of about 1cm2 were removed from each sample and abraded using a silicon carbide burr in
order to remove glaze, slip, paint, and adhering soil, thereby reducing the risk of measuring
contamination. The samples were washed in deionized water and allowed to dry in the
laboratory. Once dry, the individual sherds were ground to powder in an agate mortar to
homogenize the samples. Archival samples were retained from each sherd (when possible)
for future research.
Two analytical samples were prepared from each source specimen. Portions of approximately
50 mg of powder were weighed into clean high-density polyethylene vials used for short
irradiations at MURR. At the same time, 200 mg of each sample was weighed into clean
high-purity quartz vials used for long irradiations. Individual sample weights were recorded
to the nearest 0.01 mg using an analytical balance. Both vials were sealed prior to
irradiation. Along with the unknown samples, Standards made from National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) certified standard reference materials of SRM-1633a
(coal fly ash) and SRM-688 (basalt rock) were similarly prepared, as were quality control
samples (e.g., standards treated as unknowns) of SRM-278 (obsidian rock) and Ohio Red
Clay (a standard developed for in-house applications).

Irradiation and Gamma-Ray Spectroscopy
Neutron activation analysis of ceramics at MURR, which consists of two irradiations and a
total of three gamma counts, constitutes a superset of the procedures used at most other
INAA laboratories (Glascock 1992; Neff 1992, 2000). As discussed in detail by Glascock
(1992), a short irradiation is carried out through the pneumatic tube irradiation system.
Samples in the polyvials are sequentially irradiated, two at a time, for five seconds by a
neutron flux of 8 x 1013 n cm-2 s-1 The 720-second count yields gamma spectra containing
peaks for nine short-lived elements aluminum (Al), barium (Ba), calcium (Ca), dysprosium
(Dy), potassium (K), manganese (Mn), sodium (Na), titanium (Ti), and vanadium (V). The
samples are encapsulated in quartz vials and are subjected to a 24âhour irradiation at a
neutron flux of 5 x 1013 n cm-2 s-1. This long irradiation is analogous to the single irradiation
utilized at most other laboratories. After the long irradiation, samples decay for seven
days, and then are counted for 1,800 seconds (the âmiddle countâ) on a high-resolution
germanium detector coupled to an automatic sample changer. The middle count yields
determinations of seven medium half-life elements, namely arsenic (As), lanthanum (La),
lutetium (Lu), neodymium (Nd), samarium (Sm), uranium (U), and ytterbium (Yb). After an
additional three- or four-week decay, a final count of 8,500 seconds is carried out on each
sample. The latter measurement yields the following 17 long half-life elements: cerium
(Ce), cobalt (Co), chromium (Cr), cesium (Cs), europium (Eu), iron (Fe), hafnium (Hf), nickel
(Ni), rubidium (Rb), antimony (Sb), scandium (Sc), strontium (Sr), tantalum (Ta), terbium
(Tb), thorium (Th), zinc (Zn), and zirconium (Zr). The element concentration data from the
three measurements are tabulated in parts per million.

Interpreting Chemical Data
The analyses at MURR, described above, produced elemental concentration values for 33
elements in most of the analyzed samples (see Appendix 9-1). Data for nickel (Ni) in many
samples was below detection limits (as is the norm for most New World ceramics) and
was removed from consideration during the statistical analysis. Two of the five samples
in this study had calcium concentrations exceeding one percent, which justified a calcium
adjustment. The analysis here uses calcium-adjusted reference groups. The following
mathematical correction was used as it has been proven to be effective in other calciumrich datasets (Cogswell et al. 1998:64):

e' =

106 e
106 â 2.5c

where eâ² is the corrected concentration of a given element in ppm, e is the
measured concentration of that element in ppm, and c is the concentration of
elemental calcium in ppm. After the calcium correction, calcium and strontium
were removed from the statistical analyses. Sodium and manganese were also
eliminated during the calcium correction process. Titanium was not included in
the statistical analysis due to potential data shifts resulting from the use of a new
standard. Statistical analysis was subsequently carried out on base-10 logarithms
of concentrations on the remaining 26 elements.
Use of log concentrations rather than raw data compensates for differences in magnitude
between the major elements, such as calcium, on one hand and trace elements, such as
the rare earth or lanthanide elements (REEs). Transformation to base-10 logarithms also
yields a more normal distribution for many trace elements.
The interpretation of compositional data obtained from the analysis of archaeological
materials is discussed in detail elsewhere (e.g., Baxter and Buck 2000; Bieber et al.
1976; Bishop and Neff 1989; Glascock 1992; Harbottle 1976; Neff 2000) and will only
be summarized here. The main goal of data analysis is to identify distinct homogeneous
groups within the analytical database. Based on the provenance postulate of Weigand et al.
(1977), different chemical groups may be assumed to represent geographically restricted
sources. For lithic materials such as obsidian, basalt, and cryptocrystalline silicates (e.g.,
chert, flint, or jasper), raw material samples are frequently collected from known outcrops
or secondary deposits and the compositional data obtained on the samples is used to
define the source localities or boundaries. The locations of sources can also be inferred
by comparing unknown specimens (i.e. ceramic artifacts) to knowns (i.e. clay samples);
or by indirect methods such as the âcriterion of abundanceâ (Bishop et al. 1992); or by
arguments based on geological and sedimentological characteristics (e.g., Steponaitis et
al. 1996). The ubiquity of ceramic raw materials usually makes it impossible to sample all
324 AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

potential âsourcesâ intensively enough to create groups of knowns to which unknowns can
be compared. Lithic sources tend to be more localized and compositionally homogeneous
in the case of obsidian or compositionally heterogeneous as is the case for most cherts.
Compositional groups can be viewed as âcenters of massâ in the compositional hyperspace
described by the measured elemental data. Groups are characterized by the locations
of their centroids and the unique relationships (i.e. correlations) between the elements.
Decisions about whether to assign a specimen to a particular compositional group are
based on the overall probability that the measured concentrations for the specimen could
have been obtained from that group.
Initial hypotheses about source-related subgroups in the compositional data can be derived
from non-compositional information (e.g., archeological context, decorative attributes,
etc.) or from the application of various pattern-recognition techniques to the multivariate
chemical data. Some of the pattern recognition techniques that have been used to
investigate archeological data sets are cluster analysis (CA), principal components analysis
(PCA), and discriminant analysis (DA). Each of the techniques has its own advantages
and disadvantages which may depend upon the types and quantity of data available for
interpretation.
The variables (measured elements) in archeological and geological data sets are often
correlated and frequently large in number. This makes handling and interpreting patterns
within the data difficult. Therefore, it is often useful to transform the original variables
into a smaller set of uncorrelated variables in order to make data interpretation easier. Of
the above-mentioned pattern recognition techniques, PCA is a technique that most easily
transforms the data from the original correlated variables into uncorrelated variables.
PCA creates a new set of reference axes arranged in decreasing order of subsumed
variance. The individual PCs are linear combinations of the original variables. The data
can be displayed on combinations of the new axes, just as they can be displayed on the
original elemental concentration axes. PCA can be used in a pure pattern-recognition
mode (i.e. to search for subgroups in an undifferentiated data set), or in a more evaluative
mode (i.e. to assess the coherence of hypothetical groups suggested by other criteria).
Generally, compositional differences between specimens can be expected to be larger for
specimens in different groups than for specimens in the same group, and this implies that
groups should be detectable as distinct areas of high point density on plots of the first few
components. It is well known that PCA of chemical data is scale dependent (Mardia et al.
1979), and analyses tend to be dominated by those elements or isotopes for which the
concentrations are relatively large. This is yet another reason for the log transformation of
the data.
One frequently exploited strength of PCA, discussed by Baxter (1992), Baxter and Buck
(2000), and Neff (1994, 2002), is that it can be applied as a simultaneous R- and Q-mode
technique, with both variables (elements) and objects (individual analyzed samples)

displayed on the same set of principal component reference axes. A plot using the first two
principal components as axes is usually the best possible two-dimensional representation
of the correlation or variance-covariance structure within the data set. Small angles between
the vectors from the origin to variable coordinates indicate strong positive correlation;
angles at 90 degrees indicate no correlation; and angles close to 180 degrees indicate
strong negative correlation. Likewise, a plot of sample coordinates on these same axes
will be the best two-dimensional representation of Euclidean relations among the samples
in log-concentration space (if the PCA was based on the variance-covariance matrix) or
standardized log-concentration space (if the PCA was based on the correlation matrix).
Displaying both objects and variables on the same plot makes it possible to observe the
contributions of specific elements to group separation and to the distinctive shapes of
the various groups. Such a plot is commonly referred to as a âbiplotâ in reference to the
simultaneous plotting of objects and variables. The variable inter-relationships inferred
from a biplot can be verified directly by inspecting bivariate elemental concentration plots
(Note that a bivariate plot of elemental concentrations is not a biplot.)
Whether a group can be discriminated easily from other groups can be evaluated visually in
two dimensions or statistically in multiple dimensions. A metric known as the Mahalanobis
distance (or generalized distance) makes it possible to describe the separation between
groups or between individual samples and groups on multiple dimensions. The Mahalanobis
distance of a specimen from a group centroid (Bieber et al. 1976; Bishop and Neff 1989)
is defined by:

where y is the 1 x m array of logged elemental concentrations for the specimen
of interest, X is the n x m data matrix of logged concentrations for the group to
which the point is being compared, with being its 1 x m-centroid, and Ix is the
inverse of the m x m variance-covariance matrix of group X. Because Mahalanobis
distance takes into account variances and covariances in the multivariate group it
is analogous to expressing distance from a univariate mean in standard deviation
units. Like standard deviation units, Mahalanobis distances can be converted into
probabilities of group membership for individual specimens. For relatively small
sample sizes, it is appropriate to base probabilities on Hotellingâs T2, which is the
multivariate extension of the univariate Studentâs t.
When group sizes are small, Mahalanobis distance-based probabilities can fluctuate
dramatically depending upon whether or not each specimen is assumed to be a member
of the group to which it is being compared. Harbottle (1976) calls this phenomenon
âstretchabilityâ in reference to the tendency of an included specimen to stretch the group
in the direction of its own location in elemental concentration space. This problem can be
circumvented by cross-validation; that is, by removing each specimen from its presumed
group before calculating its own probability of membership (Baxter 1994; Leese and Main

326 AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

1994). This is a conservative approach to group evaluation that may sometimes exclude
true group members.
Small sample and group sizes place further constraints on the use of Mahalanobis
distance: with more elements than samples, the group variance-covariance matrix
is singular, thus rendering calculation of Ix (and D2 itself) impossible. Therefore, the
dimensionality of the groups must somehow be reduced. One approach would be to
eliminate elements considered irrelevant or redundant. The problem with this approach is
that the investigatorâs preconceptions about which elements should be discriminate may
not be valid. It also squanders the main advantage of multi-element analysis, namely the
capability to measure a large number of elements. An alternative approach is to calculate
Mahalanobis distances with the scores on principal components extracted from the
variance-covariance or correlation matrix for the complete data set. This approach entails
only the assumption, entirely reasonable in light of the above discussion of PCA, that most
group-separating differences should be visible on the first several PCs. Unless a data set
is extremely complex, containing numerous distinct groups, using enough components to
subsume at least 90 percent of the total variance in the data can be generally assumed
to yield Mahalanobis distances that approximate Mahalanobis distances in full elemental
concentration space.
Lastly, Mahalanobis distance calculations are also quite useful for handling missing data
(Sayre 1975). When many specimens are analyzed for a large number of elements, it is
almost certain that a few element concentrations will be missed for some of the specimens.
This occurs most frequently when the concentration for an element is near the detection
limit. Rather than eliminate the specimen or the element from consideration, it is possible
to substitute a missing value by replacing it with a value that minimizes the Mahalanobis
distance for the specimen from the group centroid. Thus, those few specimens which are
missing a single concentration value can still be used in group calculations.

Results
Comparison with MURR database
The samples from the two sites were projected against the entire MURR ceramic NAA
database containing over 55,000 samples and there were no clear close matches.
Samples from the Caddo region tend to be generally similar across broad areas (Ferguson
et. al 2008) and these samples clearly fit this pattern. There is no reason to believe that
these samples were produced outside the Caddo region.
Comparison with Caddo and Central Texas Compositional Groups
The MURR Caddo database (consisting of approximately 1200 ceramic samples, mostly
submitted by Timothy K. Perttula) is one of the largest samples from any region in the
world. It is also one of the most complicated. Over the past decade the compositional
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. 327

Chapter 9

group structure has undergone numerous modifications and, more recently, reanalysis
(Ferguson et al. 2008). The most recent interpretation of the East Texas Caddo database
divides the region into 11 sub-regions. Each of these sub-regions is then treated as an
individual dataset, and for most sub-regions, a core group has been isolated. Unfortunately,
most of these core groups consistently overlap chemically, making the determination of
the specific location of production very problematic.
The current samples were compared to each of the sub-regional groups, and all but two of
the samples fit well into the Region 4 Core and Region 5 Core groups. The Kitchen Branch
and Keering sites are located in Region 4, but the Regions 4 and 5 Core groups are almost
identical in chemical composition. Figure 9-3 is a map of the Caddo INAA regions. Figure
9-4 is a plot of the new samples against the two matching reference groups. Table 9-1 lists
the probabilities of membership in the larger Caddo reference groups. We have analyzed
bivariate plots and statistical projections of these samples against all of the other Caddo
regional reference groups and not found any other matches.
A few new samples show some slight variability from the Region 4 Core Group in just
one or two elements that indicate a very similar chemistry, but this variation reduces
the Mahalanobis distance based probability of membership in large groups such as the
Region 4 Core Group. Sample KIT006 might be an exception to this. It is quite different in
its concentration of a number of elements. This sample does not match any of the other
groups identified for the Caddo region. This sample is a burned clay sample and may
reflect a sample of clay that was not intended for ceramic production.
The two sites (only 9 km apart, see Figure 1-1) show little variability in ceramic composition,
reflecting the broader patterns in the region. Figure 9-5 is a plot of the samples from this
study separated by site. The two burned clay samples are plotted separately. The samples
from the two sites do not reveal a compositional profile that could be used to identify
specific locales of ceramic production in this portion of the Big Cypress Creek basin. This
can be a result of significant movement of ceramics (and possibly raw material) throughout
the region, broadly similar composition of raw materials and production recipes across the
region, or quite likely, both.

Conclusions
All of the ceramic samples in this study from the Kitchen Branch and Keering sites fit well
within the compositional variability expected for ceramics from the East Texas portion of
the Caddo area. Smaller-scale variability has been difficult to define for most of the Caddo
region, and the samples in this study fit the general pattern for ceramics recovered in
Regions 4 and 5 (with significant overlap in other regions as well). One of the burned clay
samples (KIT006) shows clear separation from the other samples in the study, possibly
indicating it was not intended for ceramic production. These samples will further expand

Petrographic Analysis of Pottery and Burned Clay/Daub Samples from the Kitchen
Branch (41CP220) and Keering (41CP21) Sites, Camp County, Texas
Leslie G. Cecil

Introduction
This section of Chapter 9 describes the petrographic analysis of 23 sherd samples and
two burned clay/daub samples excavated from the Kitchen Branch and Keering sites. All
thin section images were taken in plane, polarized light with 5X magnification. Each image
is a portion of one of the two fields that was counted for this analysis. Following the point
count/temper group section is an interpretation of the instrumental neutron activation

analysis (INAA) data generated by Ferguson and Glascock (see above, this chapter) and
these petrographic data. While there is not a one-to-one correlation between the chemical
and mineralogical data, there are some interesting results that highlight the need for
combining chemical and petrographic data to better understand Caddo potting (and
possibly exchange) behavior.

Methodology
Petrographic analysis allows the analyst to identify minerals that are present in the
clay pastes of different vessels. Petrography allows analysis of many clay materials
and inclusions at one time. One can study âthe clay itself, natural inclusions in the clay,
purposefully added inclusions, and glazes or slips on the clay surfaceâ (Childs 1989:24).
Petrographic analysis has been adapted from geological techniques of analysis for the
study of soils and rocks and it is useful for archeological ceramics because, to a large
extent, geological sources differ enough regionally to allow for comparison of different
clays (Blatt 1992). These methods are applicable to pottery analysis because pottery
can be regarded as metamorphosed sedimentary rock due to the composition of a sherd
consisting of clastic grains imbedded in a clay paste that has been transformed to ârockâ
through the process of firing (Bishop and Rands1982; Rice 1987:376). Understanding
these basic principles of geology, plus other principles of optical mineralogy, allow the
description of pottery pastes and clays.
Although petrographic analysis is important to the analysis of ceramics, there are some
limitations. Thin-sectioning may not produce the full mineralogical composition of a pottery
sample due to sampling error and because the method of producing thin-section slides
involves grinding and polishing of the sample (Orton et al. 1993). In addition to problems
with sample preparation, petrographic analysis alone cannot determine the type of clay
mineral in the sherd because of the refractive characteristics of clay minerals. Because of
these limitations, petrography is often combined with (1) x-ray diffraction in order to obtain
a full mineralogical complement and (2) INAA to obtain a full elemental complement.
The 25 samples were cut with a wet saw for the preparation of thin section slides. The
sherds were sent to Spectrum Petrographics where they were embedded in an epoxy block.
The most fragile sherds were vacuum impregnated and then embedded in an epoxy block.
The block was cut in such a manner that a thin section measuring 0.03 mm thick resulted.
The resulting thin section allowed the identification of minerals in the clay paste with the
use of a polarizing microscope.
The polarizing microscope is composed of a light source, a polarizer, a condenser, a
rotatable stage, objective, slots for a quartz wedge, an analyzer, and a Bertrand lens.
Light originates from a light source at the base of the microscope and passes through the
polarizer that aligns the light waves in a single plane or direction. The polarized light then
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. 333

Chapter 9

passes through minerals on the rotatable stage and bends them according to the mineral
structure, because each mineral and inclusion transmits light differently and is thus
identifiable (McLaughlin 1977). The objective magnifies the resulting light waves and the
light passes through an analyzer. Analyzers allow light to vibrate in a plane perpendicular
to that of the first polarizer. When the analyzer is in place (crossed nicols), birefringence
colors appear and can then be compared to published charts to identify the mineral. If
the crossed nicol color, angle of extinction, and other mineralogical characteristics are not
sufficient in the identification of the mineral, the Bertrand lens and condenser produce
interference figures that determine the mineralâs sign (uniaxial or biaxial). Interference
colors, in addition to the techniques described above, allow identification of most minerals.
Thin-sectioning provides one objective means of classifying pottery pastes through the
analysis of mineral size, shape, roundness, and frequency. Mineral size, shape, and
roundness are established through a comparison of various graphs and tables (Figures
9-6 to 9-8) (Shackley 1975:44-51). The most common geological method of determining
the quantity of minerals in a thin section is point counting. Point counting determines the
number of different minerals along a predetermined area (for example, 10 mm) of the length
and width of the section (Chayes 1956). Various studies have employed different methods
for counting the frequency of inclusions: Peacock (1973) uses a random grain selection;
Middleton et al. (1985) use a variation of systematic sampling along linear transects with
tests of accuracy for different thin-section samples; and Dickenson and Shutler (1979) use
an area point count (all minerals, inclusions, and voids are counted in the field of view).
Middleton et al. (1985) compared area counting to standard geological point counting and
determined that the number of minerals counted was equal and the only difference was
that area counting resulted in a smaller mean mineral diameter. Because mean diameter
of minerals was not critical and I obtained similar point counts with standard point counts
and area point counts (tested on 25 sherds of different matrices), I implemented area
counting for a field of view with 4X magnification (all thin section images were taken at 5X
magnification).
Before conducting an area count, I scanned the sherd to determine the range of minerals
and mineral sizes as well as to note any details of manufacturing techniques and slip
thickness. After determining the types of minerals present, I counted two standard image
areas to ensure that each area was representative of the sherds as a whole and to detect
changes in the clay paste. The first counted area was located at the end of the slide
farthest from the rim and the second was determined by rolling a die and moving the slide
the corresponding number of centimeters. For example, if I rolled a 5, I moved the slide
5 cm and centered the microscope in an area that filled the standard image. For each
mineral type, I measured the range of mineral sizes (the smallest and the largest), the
relative frequency as determined by Figure 9-6, the degree of sorting as determined by
Figure 9-7, the mineral roundness as determined by Figure 9-8, the number of minerals in
the standard image, the frequency of all of the minerals in the clay paste as determined by
Figure 9-6, and the clay birefringence. Other abnormalities were also noted.

Results
As a result of the point counts, three paste variants (Sandy Paste with Bone and Grog,
Sandy Paste with Grog, and Sandy Paste with Chert) were identified (see below) (Table
9-2). Each paste group has subgroups because of inclusion variations. In addition to the
differences in pastes, I observed two general clay paste categories: a dense homogenous
clay fabric (oxidized samples with many organic inclusions) and a sandy, coarser sand clay

fabric. These differences could be the result of a silt-based clay and a sand-based clay
and/or the potters sieving the clays to obtain different fabrics. In general, small quartz
minerals, biotite, iron, and organics most likely occur because they are part of the clay
body. They are also not too angular, which may be the result of weathering from the parent
material. The presence of K-feldspar, microcline, and chlorite in a few of the samples and
a daub sample suggest the presence of igneous rock weathered into the clay bed. Obvious
culturally-added inclusions include the angular, larger quartz, bone, and grog.

Sandy Paste with Bone and Grog Variants
One of the main paste groups that exist in this sample (and other Caddo pottery) is the
co-occurrence of quartz (sandy paste) with bone and grog. While this is a main paste
group, I have divided this larger group into four subgroups because of varying inclusions
that may represent culturally-intended decisions by the potters.
Paste Group 1: Sandy Paste with Bone and Grog (Figure 9-9)
This sherd was separated from the other
sherds with a sandy paste due to the lack
of other inclusions besides quartz, bone,
and grog. The majority of inclusions are
angular, suggesting that they are culturallyadded. This sherd also represents a paste
that is denser with many small organics
still present, indicating that it was not fired
completely at a higher temperature to get
rid of the organic inclusions.

Paste Group 2: Sandy Paste with Detrital Chert, and Bone and Grog (low iron) (Figure 9-10)
Six sherds from both sites comprise this sandy paste group. This is the group with the
second highest number of members. It is different from the other sandy, bone, and grog
paste groups because of the presence of chert. There are two size categories of quartz (fine
and coarse), suggesting that the fine quartz that is less angular is a result of weathering
into/with the clay and the larger quartz that is angular is a result of tempering.
For this paste group, the larger quartz inclusions occur at a frequency of 13â25 percent of
the total quartz counts. The bone and grog inclusions also are culturally added. In general,
the chert inclusions are more round than they are angular, suggesting that the chert is a
natural inclusion to the clay. Many of the pastes were very dark in color so the organics
count is skewed to those sherds that were either fired at a higher temperature or fired in
an oxidizing environment.

Figure 9-11. Thin Section Images of Paste Group 3 sherds: a, 41CP220-PET-3; b, 41CP220-PET-8.

These two sherds from the Kitchen Branch site look very similar in texture to those of Paste
Group 1 (and those of Paste Group 2 that have been fired in an oxidizing environment).
The only petrographic difference between these sherds and those of Paste Group 2 is the
presence of iron. The difference between these sherds and those of Paste Group 1 is the
presence of chert and iron. Iron could be explained by the existence of a ferrous vein in the
clay. There is no reason to believe that the iron was intentionally or culturally added. While
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. 341

Chapter 9

the chert also is most likely not culturally added, it is important to make the distinction of
sand with chert because the sands in this group contain detrital chert (loose fragments
that have been worked away from the parent rock). This could indicate a different/distinct
parent material from which the clays formed.

Paste Group 4: Sandy Paste with Bone, Grog, and Chert with Feldspar and Microcline (Figure

Figure 9-12. Thin section images of Paste Group 4 sherds: a, 41CP220-PET-18; b, 41CP21-PET-3.

While this is a subgroup within the larger Sandy Paste, Bone and Grog paste group, it is
very distinct from the others because of the presence of minerals from igneous rocks
(K-feldspar and microcline). A distinction was made between K-feldspar and microcline
based on extinction angles and polysynthetic twinning present in the microcline minerals.
K-feldspar and microcline do occurs in sands as detrital minerals from an igneous and/
or metamorphic source rock. However, because the K-feldspar and microcline are angular
and fairly large in size, it is suggested that these are minerals that were added in the
clay manufacturing process and are not natural to the clay. It could be that the potters
were grinding igneous rock, although no igneous rocks were identified in the ground
stone tool assemblages at both sites, or that the stones (unidentified in the ground stone
tool assemblage) that they were using to process the clay or tempering materials were
composed of igneous rock and as a result of grinding and crushing of the clay or temper,
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. 343

Chapter 9

the minerals were introduced into the clay body. Therefore, their presence may not be
intentional, but it is most likely not natural. As with Paste Group 2, two size categories of
quartz (fine 65 percent and coarse 35 percent) are present, suggesting naturally occurring
quartz (fine) and culturally-added quartz (coarse). Is chert an intentional additive? Unlike
Paste Group 3, the chert inclusions are large in size and angular suggesting that these
inclusions were culturally-added and not natural detrital chert present in the sand.

Sandy Paste with Grog Variants
The second main paste group that exists in this sample (and in other Caddo pottery) is the
co-occurrence of quartz (sandy paste) with grog, but without bone inclusions. Again, this
paste variant is divided into three smaller groups because of varying inclusions that may
represent culturally-intended decisions by the potters.
Paste Group 5: Sandy Paste with Detrital Chert with Grog (Figure 9-13)
This group represents the second largest paste group in the sample from the Kitchen
Branch and Keering sites. It also represents the base group for the second variant. No
sample in this group has bone inclusions. Sample 41CP220-PET-10 has grog of two
different colors (tan and dark), suggesting that two different pieces of pottery were used
to temper this vessel. The pastes of the grog are not qualitatively different from those of
the ceramic pastes so the difference in the grog may represent differences in oxidized and

reduced pottery. This paste group also contains the one red-slipped sample (41CP220PET-16). This slip is 0.6 mm in thickness and contains quartz inclusions. This same sample
(41CP220-PET-16) was the only one in the group that had biotite and it was included in this
paste group instead of any of the others because of the presence of chert. Not all samples
had organic inclusions that were able to be counted because some samples were not fired
in an oxidized environment so as to leave visible signs of organic inclusions.

Paste Group 6: Sandy Paste with Grog (iron rich) (Figure 9-14)
These two samples have a high quartz content that is bimodal in size, suggesting that the
fine quartz that is less angular is a result of weathering into/with the clay and the larger
quartz that is angular is a result of tempering. In addition to the quartz inclusions, these
sherds have iron and a high frequency of organic inclusions. The pastes look very similar
to those of Paste Group 3, but without the bone and chert inclusions. The lack of bone is
an intentional choice made by the potter. While this paste group looks very similar to that
of Paste Group 3, there are no chert inclusions. This suggests a different sandy clay source
or a different location in the same clay bed.

Paste Group 7: Sandy Paste with Grog (iron
poor) (Figure 9-15)
This sample was separated from the other
Sandy Paste with Grog samples because
of the small size and high frequency of
the grog inclusions. No other sample from
the two sites in this study had these grog
characteristics. There may have been
organic inclusions in the paste; however,
due to the incomplete oxidation of the sherd
it was impossible to count those inclusions.

Sandy Paste (with Chert) Variants
This is the third main paste group. It is different from the other two in that the samples do
not have grog inclusions, but they have naturally occurring detrital chert. Variation does
exist within the main group, resulting in three different paste groups (paste groups 8â10).
Paste Group 8: Sandy Paste with Detrital
Chert (Figure 9-16)
The rounded nature of the chert suggests
that it is a natural inclusion in the clay
source. The smaller size category of quartz
(81 percent) also is a natural inclusion
in the clay; however, the larger and more
prominent quartz (19 percent) inclusions
were culturally-added. The paste was too
dark to determine the presence of organics.

The sample is very similar to the one in Paste

result of an intentional cultural decision.
The bone in this sample is redder than the

Paste Group 10: Sandy Paste with Detrital
Chert, and Bone and Chlorite (Figure 9-18)
This sample is different from the other
sherd samples in this study because of the
presence of chlorite inclusions in the clay
paste. Give the sphericity of the chlorite, it
is most likely present as a natural inclusion.
Chlorite occurs most often in igneous rocks
and can be associated with hydrothermal
ore deposits. It can also co-occur with
quartz in pelitic schist. The only other
sample in this study with chlorite inclusions
Figure 9-18. Paste Group 10 thin section image.
is the daub sample (41CP220-PET-20).
Again, there are two size categories for the
quartz inclusions, suggesting that some
quartz occurs naturally (small in size with a frequency of 31 percent) and some quartz (i.e.
larger in size and more angular) occurs as the result of a cultural decision.

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

Summary
Ferguson and Glascock (this chapter) analyzed 28 pottery samples and two burned clay
samples from the Kitchen Branch and Keering sites using INAA. According to their analysis,
there are no clear matches to the MURR database, but the samples fall into East Texas
Region 4 Core and Region 5 Core (see Figure 9-3). They also state that the samples âshow
little variability in ceramic composition, reflecting the broader patterns in the regionâ
(Ferguson and Glascock, this chapter). Given the petrographic data, this may be a result of
the grog temper in the sherd samples. Inclusion of grog temper (pieces of other pottery with
a similar or different chemical composition) will interfere or cloud chemical data because
one is essentially analyzing two or more pieces of pottery as one.
While the INAA data could determine that the pottery and clay samples were the result
of local manufacture, petrographic data add some cultural insights. All of the pastes are
dominated by quartz inclusions (sandy paste), but there are three basic paste variants
from the sherds at the Kitchen Branch and Keering sites: (1) Sandy Paste with Bone and
Grog, (2) Sandy Paste with Grog, and (3) Sandy Paste with Detrital Chert. At least the
bone and grog inclusions represent intentional choices made by the Caddo potters. Chert
inclusions could occur in the sherd pastes because of an intentional potterâs choice or,
more likely, because they are a natural component of the clays of the Big Cypress Creek
basin, as demonstrated from previously analyzed sherds from other sites in the basin
(e.g., Skokan and Perttula 1998). This suggests the presence of three basic paste recipes.
Within each of the basic paste recipes also exists variation: (1) Sandy Paste with Bone and
Grog has four groups, (2) Sandy Paste with Grog has three groups, and (3) Sandy Paste
with Detrital Chert has three groups.
The most interesting occurrence in the sherd (and daub sample) is the presence of
inclusions from an igneous rock source: K-feldspar, microcline, and chlorite. The size,
shape, and frequency of the K-feldspar and microcline suggest that they were culturallyadded to the Caddo pottery. As stated above, this could have been an intentional act or
the result of preparing clays and tempers with an igneous rock. The chlorite minerals most
likely are a result of clay weathering.
The data set from the Kitchen Branch and Keering sites is a perfect example of the need for
petrography to supplement chemical (INAA) research. Ferguson (Ferguson and Glascock
2009; Ferguson et al. 2008) admits that the Caddo chemical data set is a challenge to
interpret and those interpretations have yet to produce any isolated production regions.
Because of the petrographic variability in the sherd pastes and the lack of obvious
chemical distinctions, this may be an area (similar to the Southwest U.S.) where extensive
petrographic research is as fruitful as, or more fruitful than, chemical data research.
While I am not advocating doing away with chemical compositional research, to better
understand the regional variability in ceramic paste composition, additional petrographic
research also needs to be conducted on Caddo ceramic assemblages across East Texas.

Instrumental Neutron Activation and Ceramic Petrographic Analysis Comparisons
Timothy K. Perttula and Robert Z. Selden, Jr.
Interpretations Based Solely on MURR INAA Analyses and Petrographic Findings
As part of the analysis of the Caddo ceramic assemblage from the Kitchen Branch and
Keering sites, a small sample of sherds from fine wares (n=16), utility wares (n=13),
and burned clay/daub (n=3) were subjected to instrumental neutron activation analysis
(INAA, Ferguson and Glascock, this chapter) and/or petrographic analysis (Cecil, this
chapter). Each set of analyses provided a modicum of useful information on the paste
composition of the sherds, and led to the identification of a variety of chemical and paste
groups. These identifications in turn have led to the partitioning of the analyzed sherds
into those thought to be of local manufacture (i.e. manufactured from clays and tempers
obtained within near proximity to the site) as well as sherds thought to be of non-local
manufacture (i.e. manufactured from clays and tempers not available within a nearby
local, sub-region, or region of this part of East Texas). To compare the findings from both
analyses, we review the combined results of those analyses, which have often been found
to produce complementary as well as conflicting interpretations for a variety of reasons
(see Stoltman 2001; Stoltman et al. 2005; Neff et al. 2006; Stoner et al. 2008; Wallis
2011). In the case of the INAA data and the identification of possible non-local vessel
sherds, we relied upon probabilities of membership for individual sherds in the East Texas
chemical groups identified by Ferguson et al. (2008), focusing on sherds that had less
than a one percent membership in the East Texas INAA chemical groups as listed in Table
9-1. For the petrographic analysis, we relied on the identifications made by Cecil of sherds
with igneous particles in the paste (i.e. feldspar, microline, and chlorite); igneous particles
are not expected to occur in clays in East Texas, other than perhaps as lag and streamtransported materials that are constituents of Red River or Brazos River clays.
What these results suggest is that between 10â22 percent of the INAA and petrographic
analysis sherds from the Kitchen Branch and Keering sites may be from non-local sources;
the higher percentage of non-local sherds (22 percent) has been identified in the INAA and
petrographic work (20 percent) from the Kitchen Branch and Keering sites, respectively.
Only one of the sherds in the analyzed samples can be suggested to represent a nonlocally made ceramic vessel from both the INAA and petrographic work; none of the other
possible non-local sherds have both INAA and petrographic evidence to support that
possibility. Also calling into question the non-local attribution of some of the sherds in the
samples from the two sites is the fact that analyzed pieces of burned clay and daub from
the Kitchen Branch siteâwhich almost certainly were gathered from clay sources in the
immediate vicinity of the site since these are likely clay gathered in bulk to cover structure
thatching and/or to line hearths or cooking pits, and thus likely not transported any great
distanceâhave been identified as deriving from non-local sources (see discussion below).
These sherds from vessels from apparent non-local sources would seem to reflect the
consideration that they fall outside of INAA sub-regional group 4 (see Figure 9-3), which
358 AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

represents the general source area (i.e. the Big Cypress Creek basin) argued by MURR of the
local clays used for most of the vessels manufactured at the two sites. The apparent nonlocal sherds from the sites include grog and bone-grog-tempered parallel brushed and tool
punctated-vertical incised sherds from the Kitchen Branch site from INAA region 1 (middle
Red River); a grog-tempered Ripley Engraved sherd with a scroll motif from INAA region 5
(upper Sabine River basin) and paste group 4; and grog-tempered red-slipped sherd and
a grog-tempered sherd with engraved triangles from the Kitchen Branch site and a tool
punctated grog-tempered sherd from the Keering site from INAA region 6 (middle Sabine
River basin). Simply from the petrographic work, two sherds from the Kitchen Branch site
are from vessels of apparent non-local manufacture: a cf. Taylor Engraved sherd from
paste group 4 and a Ripley Engraved bottle sherd from paste group 10. These various
sherds would seem to indicate that the movement of ceramic vessels at the sites was
not confined to fine wares, or occurred in a limited amount, but instead that all manner
of ceramic wares were made in several sub-regions of East Texas by Caddo potters and
regularly traded and exchanged to other Caddo peoples living in other sub-regions for
various goods and services.
Regarding âareas of production,â it seems fairly evident at most Caddo sites where large
numbers of INAA sherds are analyzed that the sherds fall into 1-2 chemical groups at most
(see Perttula and Ferguson 2010). Proportionally, just on the basis of abundance, the most
dominant chemical group sherdsâsuch as INAA region 4 sherds at the Kitchen Branch (78
percent) and Keering (80 percent) sitesâvery likely came from a local clay, ca. 0-3 km
away, even if that clay source cannot be pinpointed. It is the less common compositional
groups, sherds with low probabilities of membership in the main INAA chemical groups, or
even the unassigned sherds in larger analyzed sample, that may need to be scrutinized
in more detail because this is where the non-local sherds/clays likely reside in analyzed
samples.
The wide number of paste groups detected in the petrographic analysis in the Kitchen
Branch and Keering site ceramic assemblages is completely consistent with what is known
about the kinds of Caddo ceramics that occur across East Texas. Caddo potters creatively
used a variety of clays and tempers to manufacture ceramic vessels, likely a result of local
preferences and family traditions, as well as to meet the functional and stylistic demands
of the kinds of vessels being made in local communities and individual sites. To build on
these findings at these Prairie Creek Caddo sites and other East Texas Caddo sites, it will
be important to look at paste diversity in time, space, and cultural context (mound center
vs. habitation sites) as part of understanding the development and evolution of Caddo
ceramics among the different prehistoric and early historic groups.
The analysis of the chemical and petrographic data from the Kitchen Branch and Keering
sites may have produced more robust (and perhaps better interpretable) results than may
have been obtained from one method or another, although it is possible that petrographic
data may in the end be the far more useful of the two methods for questions of paste
composition and identification of likely local vs. non-local pastes/sherds (cf. Stoltman et al.
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. 359

Chapter 9

2005). The one disconcerting finding in both the MURR INAA analysis and the petrographic
analysis is the fact that the burned clay and daub samples from the Kitchen Branch site
(KIT 06, KIT 016 and PET-20) have chemical characteristics and distinct mineral grain
composition that suggest these materials have a non-local provenance. While it is possible
that distinct clays from non-local contexts may have been traded or exchanged between
different potters in different communities for the production of specific kinds of ceramic
vessels, it is difficult to conceive of a reason why clays used for such utilitarian tasks as
covering house thatching or lining hearths or pit ovens would have been the product of
long-distance exchange when the quantities needed for these tasks would have been much
more readily met with local clays of variable and non-specialized qualities. It seems more
likely that several kinds of clays occurred in proximity to the Kitchen Branch siteâclays that
may or may not have been used for vessel productionâthat derived from chemically and
mineralogically distinctive sources in the Prairie Creek valley that cannot be discriminated
at present through INAA or petrographic analysis.
Interpretations of Provenance Based on a Reinterpretation of the INAA Data from the Kitchen
Branch and Keering Sites as well as from Contemporaneous Sites in the Big Cypress and
Sulphur River Basins
Due to the vagaries of Texas geology, traditional geochemical techniques, instrumental
neutron activation analysis (INAA) in particular, have not achieved the degree of analytical
success that they have within other regions. This final section of Chapter 9 examines
the results of Caddo INAA efforts at the Kitchen Branch (41CP220) site, from a different
perspective (i.e. element by element spatial distributions) than that employed by MURR.
The focus remains the delineation of local vs. non-local vessel sherd provenance in the
assemblage within the context of the regional distribution of other INAA samples from
contemporaneous Caddo sites in the Big Cypress Creek basin within a 25 mile radius of
the Kitchen Branch site (Figure 9-21).
A recent reanalysis of the Caddo INAA database (Selden 2013a) has noted that among
those sites with a large number of samples (>33 sherds), the chemical composition is not
nearly as homogenous as previous MURR analyses of East Texas samples have concluded.
In fact, there are three or more contributing geochemical groups within each of these sites
(Figure 9-22), indicating the Caddo use at each site of geochemically distinct clay sources
for ceramic vessel manufacture.
Twenty INAA samples from the Kitchen Branch site were processed at the MURR (see
Ferguson and Glascock, this chapter), and those geochemical data were transferred into
the Caddo INAA database for analysis (see Selden 2013a). In an attempt to better illustrate
the variability in geochemical signatures across the southern Caddo landscape, and to
highlight general trends that appear within the data, the INAA results for 1192 sherds from
164 sites (mainly in East Texas)âparticularly 191 sherds from 37 sites within a 25 mile
radius of the Kitchen Branch siteâare employed within the subsequent discussion.

A standard suite of multivariate statistics are employed in this analysis,1 augmented
with 3D graphs and geographic representations that illustrate the distributions of the
geochemical data across space. The log-10 of each element was calculated for each
sherd, adding a value of one to each sherd/element in the database, effectively replacing
all missing values with a zero. Subsequently, the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic in ArcGIS10 was
employed to calculate a z-score for each log-10 value, illustrating the spatial distribution
and z-score values per element for each site using the formula:

The Gi* statistic is a z-score, so no further calculations are required (ESRI 2012). Following
the calculation of log-10 values for each element, these data were then used to calculate
the deterministic statistic of inverse distance weighted (IDW) in ArcGIS10 for each element
to better illustrate whether discrete geochemical signatures in the sherds exist close to
one another, or in the same location (Selden 2013:Figures 2-34).
In reviewing the results of the geochemical data from the Kitchen Branch site for general
trends, all 33 elements were found to be nearer the median range of those values seen
at other Caddo sites in the database. In considering the geographic distribution of each
of the elements within a 25-mile radius, it appears that the Kitchen Branch site may be
located between an area defined by low elemental values to the northwest in the upstream
part of the Big Cypress Creek basin and middle reaches of the Sulphur River basin, and
another by high elemental values to the southeast in the Big and Little Cypress Creek
basins. Employing the Geologic Database of Texas via by the Texas Natural Resources
Information System as a proxy, these data were plotted atop several geologic maps, and it
appears that cerium (Ce), dysprosium (Dy), europium (Eu) (Figure 9-23), lanthanum (La),
lutetium (Lu), neodymium (Nd), samarium (Sm), tantalum (Ta), terbium (Tb), ytterbium
(Yb) and zinc (Zn) (Figure 9-24) correlate with a spatial division between the Wilcox Group
to the immediate northwest of the site in the Big Cypress Creek basin and the Claiborne
Group at the site and downstream to the southeast in the Big Cypress; all but tantalum
and zinc are lanthanides.
In particular, it appears that Claiborne Group components, including the Queen City Sand
(a fine to locally medium-grained quartz sand with ironstone concretions), the Weches
Formation (glauconite and quartz sand), and the Sparta Sand (a light to brownish-gray

quartz sand) possess higher values for these nine elements than the silty and sandy
clay of the Wilcox Group to the northwest. Contributing to the fact that the geochemical
data plottings from many of the sherds from the Kitchen Branch site are associated with
the Claiborne Group is that the Kitchen Branch site is situated atop Quaternary alluvium
adjacent to the Queen City Sand.
The division of these data based upon real measures of geologic variability makes it
possible to demarcateâon a broad scaleâbetween those sherds from vessels of local
manufacture at the Kitchen Branch site in the Claiborne Group (i.e. made from clays likely
obtained in the Prairie Creek valley), and those that were manufactured from clays within
the Wilcox Group (i.e. located possibly at some remove from the Prairie Creek valley to the
north and west) within clusters that only minimally overlap (Figure 9-25 and Table 9-3).
There is a high degree of local geochemical variability within the region associated with the
Kitchen Branch site and other contemporaneous Late Caddo ceramic-bearing sites.
Looking only at those sherds found to be associated with the Claiborne GroupâGroup 2
in Table 9-3âfurther separation of the sherds is possible. These divisions may represent
the addition, perhaps in the form of temper or potentially from runoff accumulating in
downstream clay sources, of elements associated with the Weches and Sparta Sand
formations (Figure 9-26 and Table 9-4). Four of the 13 sherds from the Kitchen Branch
site that appear to be from vessels produced locally include elements that point to these
additions (Figure 9-26:Blue), and the remaining 13 sherds are from vessels made from
clays more representative of the Quaternary alluvium and Queen City Sand Formation that
are more dominant in the area surrounding the Kitchen Branch site (Figure 9-26:Green).
The concentration of zinc and cerium found in Caddo ceramics increases to the southeast
of the site (see Figures 9-23 and 9-24), but more work will be necessary to highlight which
of the formationsâWeches or Sparta Sand Formationsâis contributing the bulk of this
dynamic.

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

In summary, this reanalysis of the INAA data, while purposefully limited in geographic
coverage due to the high degree of geochemical variability within the area, suggests that
seven sherds from the Kitchen Branch site were from vessels that had been manufactured
with exotic clays from the neighboring Wilcox Group (Figure 9-28). Of those seven, one
was found to statistically group more closely to sherds from sites located on the Carrizo
Sand Formation: the Pilgrimâs Pride site (41CP304) in the Big Cypress Creek basin and
41UR99 in the Little Cypress Creek basin. The remaining six sherds of possible nonlocal provenance from the Kitchen Branch site were found to have originated within the
larger undivided Wilcox Group, represented in this sample by the B. J. Horton (41CP20),
Underwood (41CP230), Polk Estates (41CP245), Poole (41TT47), Mockingbird (41TT550),
Crabb (41TT650), Ear Spool (41TT653), and 41TT718 sites in the Big Cypress and White
Oak Bayou basins to the north and northwest of the Kitchen Branch site (Figure 9-28;
see also Figure 9-21). Locallyâwithin the Claiborne Groupâfour of the 13 sherds were
found to have a geochemical signature that is likely associated with the addition or natural
inclusion of elements from either the Weches or Sparta Sand Formations that occur more
regularly just to the southeast of the Kitchen Branch site.
At the Keering site, both Wilcox (60 percent) and Claiborne (40 percent) clays appear to
have been used on the manufacture of vessels. The majority of these sherds are from
vessels made from undivided Wilcox Group clays and Queen City sandy clays, and given
the location of the site in the upper Prairie Creek valley, these sherds may well be from
vessels made from locally accessible clays.

End Note
1. The shell and bone-tempered sherds (n=47) in the database were subject to a calcium correction, which
deviates from MURRâs current method of applying the calcium correction (see Steponaitis et al. 1996:559)
to the entire Caddo INAA dataset (e.g., Ferguson 2010:6; Ferguson and Glascock 2010:93, 2012). Since the
number of shell and bone-tempered sherds is small, that process is unwarranted due to the overwhelming
majority of Caddo sherds deriving from grog-tempered vessels, and âsuch correction is unnecessary because
the grog itself is made of clay, presumably the same clay that comprises the rest of the pasteâ (Steponaitis
et al. 1996:559).

Experimental Production of Late
Caddo Pottery Vessels
Chase Earles, Timothy K. Perttula, and Mason D. Miller

Vessels
The eight ceramic vessels made by Chase
Earles for the experimental archeology portion
of the Kitchen Branch site project were inspired
by design motifs and forms from the Kitchen
Branch site assemblage and eight vessels
recovered in a nearby Late Caddo, Titus phase,
cemetery at the Johns site (41CP12) on Prairie
Creek (Perttula et al. 2010b), a few miles
upstream from the Kitchen Branch site (see
Figure 1-1).
Four of the vessels are medium to large-sized
utility ware jars. They include a Mockingbird
Punctated jar (Figure 10-1), a Harleton
Appliqued vessel (Figure 10-2), a Bullard
Brushed jar (Figure 10-3), and a Pease
Brushed-Incised jar (Figure 10-4).

The other four vessels from the Johns site are
fine wares, vessels decorated with engraved
lines and often burnished to polished on
one or both vessel surfaces. They include a
Ripley Engraved bottle (Figure 10-5), a Ripley
Engraved, var. Galt carinated bowl (Figure
10-6), a Ripley Engraved, var. Gandy carinated
bowl (Figure 10-7), and a Turner Engraved
compound bowl (Figure 10-8).

Experimental Vessel Specifications
The final specifications for the vessels (Pots 1-8) made by Chase Earles were based on
the size and shape of the vessels from the Johns site (see Figures 10-1â10-8), and the
use of both raw clay sources obtained at the Kitchen Branch site and at the Keering site.
The range in the quantity of temper (grog and bone in different combinations) added to
the pots was based on previous petrographic analysis of Late Caddo Titus phase ceramics
from the Sabine and Big Cypress Creek basins, and the fact that fine wares tend to have
finely-ground temper inclusions, while utility wares do not. All vessels were fired in the
same manner in an open fire.
The authors proposed to use animal bone (burned cow bones) and grog (crushed sherds)
as temper for the experimental vessels, as these are the most common tempering
materials used by Titus phase potters. Approximately 7,500 grams of temper were needed
to complete the eight vessels, according to Earles, or approximately 940 grams per vessel.
With the approval of the THC and TxDOT (see Appendix 1-1), archeologists used a sample
of plain sherds (Table 10-1) from the Kitchen Branch site ceramic assemblage as well as
certain proveniences (surface or unknown proveniences) from the Kerring site, another
Titus phase site, as the primary source of temper for the experimental vessels. The plain
sherds from both sites had been analyzed in detail (i.e. information gathered on sherd type,
temper, paste, firing conditions, surface treatment, thickness, vessel form, if known, and
presence of organic residues) according to the protocol specified in the research design
(see Chapter 4, this volume). With an average weight of 3.8 grams per sherd, the 1,974
sherds listed in Table 10-1 weigh 7,500 grams.

Grog was produced in a relatively simple manner by gathering the approved sherds from
the Kitchen Branch and Keering site assemblages, dividing them into arbitrary groups
of roughly 500â1,000 grams, then manually pounding those sherds on concrete with a
drilling hammer (small hand-sledge) until the sherds were broken down into a fine powder
roughly equivalent to coffee grounds. To retain as much material as possible, the sherds
were kept inside two pillowcases during processing. Each load required 10â15 minutes
of hammering to be broken down sufficiently for use as grog. The material was then
collected into plastic bags and ultimately shipped to Earles for use in the production of the
experimental vessels.

The following discussion written by Earles focuses on the methods he used in his vessel
reproduction and observations made during that process. To preserve Earlesâ âvoiceâ in the
process, the primary authors have elected to keep his discussion as close to his original
manuscript as practical; retaining his informal, first-person writing style and highlighting
his unique contributions to the investigation.

Processing Clay
After receiving the clay I noticed there were two different types from two different sites.
The first was a grayish clay gathered from the Kitchen Branch site and the second clay was
a light tan/brownish clay from an upland setting at the Keering site (Figure 10-9). Upon
initial inspection I noticed what I thought was a very nice clay body in the gray clay. I was
wrong. Both clays tended to be a very sandy and the gray clay did not hold together very
well after processing. The amount of sand in the clay, as it was determined by making a
pot without temper, acted as the temper, so this was what I call a pre-tempered clay that
was very lean. Lean clay means that there are less actual clay particles in the clay body
than would be ideal.
I laid all the clay out and broke it up into the smallest clumps that I could by hand. I spread
it out on an absorbent piece of wood and then let it sit and dry out over the course of a few
to several days. Then I took the clumps and crushed them down into clay-sized particles.
There are many ways to do this. I think using a mano and metate would be very slow as
would a wood log grinding mill. There are also many ways to crush clay down, by either
using a cinder block manually, a ball mill, or a hammer mill. I sometimes put it in bags in my
driveway and drive over it for a few days. Usually I just put the dry small clumps in my corn
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. 377

Chapter 10

grinder. This works the best. I grind
up the particles and sieve them to a
window screen size (Figure 10-10),
which is around 2 or 3 mm. I just
keep repeating the process until
I have enough. I keep it in gallon
buckets.
Once I have the clay crushed down
(Figure 10-11), I can mix it by
proportion with the appropriate
temper, according to the vessel
specifications.
To make the
different tempers I just crush them
up in the corn mill as well, whether
it is burned cow bone or pre-fired
ceramic grog. In these examples
I divided the clay and temper
proportions based on tablespoons.
For example, three cups of dry clay
is the perfect amount to make a
small pot. That is 48 tablespoons.
So 14 tablespoons of grog or bone
(Figure 10-12) is roughly 30 percent
temper and 34 tablespoons of the
crushed clay is roughly 70 percent
clay. Once the clay and temper are
mixed thoroughly in the dry state, I
add just enough water to make the
mix a thick viscous state, like very
thick mud, but not runny at all. I roll
it into a ball, and bag it in airproof
plastic bags and let it sit for ideally a
month, but more often than not, only
a week. This âagesâ the clay, which
ensures that every particle is wet
and incorporated into the clay body.
It makes the clay more workable and
plastic.

Making Pots
After the clay is ready to be used I
started making the pots by rolling a

ball (Figure 10-13) and then flattening it
in my hand so that I can put it into a premade bowl (Figure 10-14). Ideally this bowl
is made of wood so it absorbs water and
the clay does not stick to it. This pancake
is the beginning in manufacturing pots
(Figure 10-15). Then depending on the
type of pot being made, I either roll out a
thick or thin coil (Figure 10-16a) and add
it, or I pre-flatten the coil (Figure 10-16b)
to get the right thickness to the coil. This
makes it easier with poorer clay to get a
thin walled clay pot. The coil is attached to
the pancake and blended together usually
with a corn cob, which is perfect and holds
water to aid in the blending. I smooth out
the joints in the coils with a wood stick
(Figure 10-17). Care has to be taken not
to collapse the walls. I continue to add
coils until I have the right size of pot.
The shape of the pot is determined by the
coils and the paddling (Figure 10-18ab). The pot is paddled with a flat piece
of wood to help control the shape. The
temper within the clay body is hidden on
the outside by using a floating method.
The wood stick rubbed over the surface of
the clay raises the finer particles of clay to

the surface, which forms a thin layer of pure
clay which then hides the temper below.
Once the piece is built the lip or rim of the
pot is treated with special care and water,
using the fingers to control the shape all the
way around the pot (Figure 10-19). Then the
surface texture treatments and decoration
are done according to what type of pot it is.
If it is punctated, this is done when the clay
is wet, so I simply use a wood stick to carve
the clay (Figure 10-20). Appliqued elements
are added by rolling very small coils of clay

and fixing them to the pot (Figure 10-21) by
using a thin wet slip of clay. Once they are
attached the appliquÃ©s can also be incised or impressed. If the pot is to be burnished
to a high shine, first the pot has to dry to a leather hard state. Then the thin red ochrebased slip is applied to the pot wet, and before it dries completely, it is rubbed down,
burnished, to the pot with a smooth stone. This slip burnish can then be incised before
firing or engraved afterwards.

Firing
After the pots dried for at least one week,
they were ready to be fired. Because of the
handmade clay and the heavy tempering,
these traditional pots do not need to be prewarmed before being subjected directly to
the fire. This is contradictory to everything
most ceramic people understand, but I
think it is what makes them unique.
First I make a small bed of coals by piling
some pine straw and small pieces of
hardwood (Figure 10-22). While this fire is
making the coals (Figure 10-23), I do place
the pots around the fire to warm them up a
little and âsmokeâ out the molecular water.
This is not always 100 percent necessary,
but I usually do it each time to make sure
that I do not get any cracks or blow-outs.
Once the pots have warmed sufficiently by
the fire and I have a good bed of coals, I
scrape out the circle of the fire coals and
put the pots in the middle (Figure 10-24a).
Then I scoop the coals around the pots
and start adding small pieces of kindling.
I use all hardwood as softwood will leave a
pitch on your pots. After the small kindling
catches, I start adding bigger and bigger
pieces of wood until I get to pieces that are
about 2 or 3 inches in diameter.

Figure 10-19. Adding the rim to the vessel.

Figure 10-20. Punctations added with a wood stick.

After a large bonfire is going for about 20
to 30 minutes, and I have measured the
temperature of the fire (Figure 10-24b),
I decide whether I want the pots to be
oxidized or reduced. Oxidized pots will be
given air as they fire and never smothered.
They will turn the natural color of the clay.
Reduced pots will be smothered with a
carbon material, in this case ash of pine

straw and wood mixed in with sand and dirt
from my pile. Once I smother the pots they
âbreatheâ in the burned carbon smoke and become reduced. This is what turns them dark
brown or black.

Figure 10-24. Vessel firing: a, vessels set in the fire; b, measuring the temperature of the firing.

After the pots are either reduced or
oxidized they are pulled from the pile
and cooled (Figure 10-25). If the pot is
to have engraving, as with Pots 5-8, it
can be engraved with an engraving tool
directly after the pot is cool enough to
handle. Usually engraving a reduced
pot results in the lighter clay body
showing through the locally reduced
outer wall.

Experimental Pigment
Figure 10-25. Fired vessels, Pots 5-8.
In this experiment I was looking for a
way to use primitive natural materials
to produce a pigment for one of the
vessels (Pot 5). My definition of a pigment is simply a mineral colorant with some sort of
binder. In this experiment I used crushed pieces of pure red ochre or hematite (Figure
382 AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

10-26). For the binder I used a common
Native American binder known as hide
glue. Hide glue is a nasty amalgamation
of different animal parts and hide that is
boiled to produce a very sticky substance
that, once dried, becomes hard like glue.
Boyd and Dering (n.d.) indicate that Native
Americans used a variety of organic
materials for binders, including blood, egg
whites, sap from plants, animal fat, and
bone marrow. Bone marrow from deer was
preferred because it is white to colorless
and almost pure fat, excellent qualities for
a binder.

The only issue I saw with hide glue as
a binder is that I am not sure that it is
waterproof. I think moisture over time
undoes the glue. I read that adding alum
to the hide glue makes it waterproof, but
I heard no mention of how much, so I just
added a tablespoon of the alum to what
would be around a cup of hide glue and
red ochre. This âpigmentâ was easier to use
when it was very warm and almost hot, but
still very sticky and hard to use. As it cooled

with this method there was no real way to
control the pigment going into the engraved
lines only. It would require a very precise brush that lent itself to this sticky material. It
definitely was not as easy as rubbing the wet red ochre/clay slip into the lines and then
cleaning away the excess. After I finished the pot with the pigment (Figure 10-27), in my
opinion I do not think this was the type of pigment used for the pots by Caddo potters. I
think that the pigment might not stay âwater proofâ and I am not sure about the viability of
painting this into the lines with accuracy.

Digital Three-Dimensional Modeling
of Vessels
In an effort to virtually preserve
the vessels produced by Mr. Earles,
AmaTerra used new technology to
generate a digital three dimensional
(3d) model of each specimen prior to
its destruction. These virtual models
are now preserved in digital format
as .obj files, which can be viewed
and interpreted. While the results of
modeling were not perfect (in some
Figure 10-35. Pot 8, engraved compound
cases, unfortunately, far from it) and
bowl with suspension holes.
dedicated three-dimensional scanning
tools would have invariably produced
better representations truer to their
original form, the models provide an excellent glimpse into some of the new tools available
to the archeology field for virtual reproduction. Below is a brief summary of the results of
this effort, and suggestions for future applications.

123d Catch Summary
Offered by Autodesk as a free downloadable and online program, 123d Catch is a digital
photogrammetry tool that generates digital 3d models from standard 2d digital photographs.
To generate a model, the user selects a series of photos (at least 20) taken of an object,
building, or person and uploads them to Autodeskâs servers. The servers, in turn, crunch
the mathematical numbers using the photosâ metadata (camera model, aperture, etc.)
to calculate the cameraâs shooting angle and, in turn, the shape of the target object.
The calculations also âdrapeâ the photos themselves over the virtual model, providing
the texture of the actual object. Once the servers have finished their interpretation, the
user downloads the resulting model for preview on their desktop (Figure 10.36). In most
instances, the resulting model is good, but a small sample of the images often would be
errantly placed, or were un-placeable by the servers. In those instances, the user has the
option to manually âstitchâ the images into the model by linking points on the unmatched
photo with points in the model (Figure 10.37). From there, the user can scale the object
by telling the program the actual distance between two known points on it. At that point,
the object is scaled to real-world dimensions. The object can be exported to other, more
robust, 3d modeling programs or printed in three dimensions if access is available to such
equipment (Figure 10.38). The program has been used previously to document burned
rock features (Campbell 2012) and to great success in recording a Civilian Conservation
Corps water fountain at Mother Neff State Park Coryell County, Texas (Miller 2012).

Observations from Application to the Experimental Archeology Vessels
Three-dimensional models were generated of every vessel Earles created for this project.
Due to a variety of factors, however, the resulting models were of differing quality. While
most models were very good to excellent (such as the Harleton Appliqued jar presented in
Figure 10.38), others (despite the best efforts of the team) bore odd miscalculations and
inaccurate results. Regardless, the author of this section (and 3d modeler for this project)
finds the resulting data very useful and simply using the tool provides for an excellent
learning opportunity (lessons of which are presented briefly below).
Due to logistical constraints, the 3d modeler did not photograph the vessels himself and
relied on Earles to do so prior to breaking them. Earles took great pains to generate good
quality images that would produce excellent resulting models. There was, however, no
way to correct problems in the images since the 3d modeler was not able to manipulate
the data until after the vessel had been broken. As such, if problems were noted, there
was little that could be done to correct them. Future projects should check the models
before the vessels are broken, though this (in the field of archeology) is not likely to be a
common occurence as many objects that might be virtually modeled will not subsequently
be broken.
Second, some of the photos were taken indoors and some were taken outdoors. It is
apparent that the resulting model quality was higher for those taken in softer, indoor
light as the bright sun washed out some of the details that were to be used in the model
calculations. Additionally, outdoor photos have relatively busy backgrounds with trees,
building walls, and other âdistractionsâ for the server, which may also have reduced model
quality somewhat.

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

Past experience and suggestions from the makers of 123D Catch suggest using a complex
background on which to place the modeled object. We used two decorated placemats as a
base for the objects (see Figures 10.36 and 10.37) to account for this. While they worked
very well, the modeler learned from others that sheets of a newspaper make excellent
backgrounds. The large, text-laden material provides numerous, fixed locations to link
images together. Utilizing such a tool could dramatically improve the results.
One problem that could not be surmounted was the depiction of the void inside the vessels.
While the large, wide bowls were easily modeled correctly, the narrow-necked bottle and
jars with their dark, black interiors were problematic for the calculating servers. These
vesselsâ exteriors would render correctly but the necksâ void left holes in the vesselsâ
necks through which one could see right through the model. The dedicated 3d Modeling
programs available for manipulation can correct this problem by filling those holes, but the
resulting image would not be completely true to the original object.
Finally, the program is new to the marketplace and, though impressive, is prone to crashes
(Figure 10.39). Continued improvements that invariably will come with this program will
increase stability and, in turn, the quality of the calculated models.

The issues experienced and presented here should not give the reader an impression
that the tool is not useful; far from it. Indeed, in most instances, the models were quite
easily generated and of excellent quality. When used with detailed static photographs,
these models, digitally preserved, provide an excellent opportunity for future observation
and interpretation. Digital files are provided to TxDOT of each model and may be loaded
onto a server online for access by the public or loaded into a CADD program for replication
through 3d printing or another medium.

Kitchen Branch Site Lithic Artifact Analysis
Timothy K. Perttula with contributions by Marilyn Shoberg

Introduction
A substantial assemblage of prehistoric lithic artifacts have been recovered in the test
excavations and data recovery investigations at the Kitchen Branch site (41CP220). This
includes both chipped and ground stone tools (primarily projectile points and a variety of
ground stone tool forms such as manos, pitted stones, and grinding slabs), debris from
the manufacture and resharpening of chipped stone tools, as well as a considerable
number of fire-cracked rocks. This chapter focuses on the analysis of these lithic artifacts
through an examination of their stylistic and technological characteristics, as well as
their horizontal and vertical distributions in the archeological deposits, with the goal of
identifying analytically discrete assemblages of lithic artifacts from this multi-component
prehistoric site. Research issues identified in the project research design (see Chapter
4, this volume) for the analysis and interpretation of the Kitchen Branch site are also
reviewed and discussed at the conclusion of this chapter.

Analytical Approach
Standard morphological, functional, and stylistic analyses were employed in the analysis
of the recovered prehistoric lithic artifacts from the Kitchen Branch site, along with the
use of TxDOTâs (n.d.) analytical protocol for chipped lithic artifacts. The burned rocks of
ferruginous sandstone, quartzite, and sandstone found at the site were counted and
weighed (in kg) in the field, then discarded. The remainder of the artifacts discussed in this
chapter are to be curated, along with records, photographs, etc. in the facilities at TARL at
The University of Texas at Austin.
The lithic artifacts were first separated by class of artifact: tool or tool preform, core, or
lithic debris, the latter two being the by-products of tool manufacture. Then, they were
separated by raw material (i.e. cherts of various colors, some of local provenance and
others from non-local sources, novaculite, quartzite, petrified wood, ferruginous sandstone,
and quartz), some of which appear to be available in local stream gravels and limited
upland bedrock sources.
The presence or absence of cortex (and the amount of cortex) and heat-treating was
noted for the tools as well as each piece of lithic debris that was subjected to detailed
analysis. The tools or tool preforms were identified morphologically (i.e. projectile point,
biface, [in various stages, see TxDOT n.d.]), scraper, uniface or expedient flake tool, etc.),

AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. 391

Chapter 11

and characteristics of flaking, edge finishing, breakage, and presence of use wear were
determined, along with applicable measurements of size and shape.
The lithic debris was sorted by size into four size classes: 6.3 mm (up to 6.3 mm in size,
S1), 12.7 mm (between 6.4â12.7 mm in size, S2), 19.2 mm (between 12.8â19.2 mm, S3),
and 25.4 mm (between 12.8â25.4 mm in size, S4); the few pieces of lithic debris larger
than 25.4 mm in length and/or width were measured to determine their actual size (S5).
This size grading is designed to investigate patterned differences in lithic technological
activities in the different components at the site as size differences in assemblages of lithic
debris have been shown to be useful in characterizing reduction and tool maintenance
activities (see Andrefsky 1994:127â131; Shott 1994:83-100).

Local Lithic Raw Materials
East Texas geologic formations are poor in lithic raw materials (Banks 1990: Figure
2.1), or at least knappable lithic materials; tool stone for ground stone manufacture,
especially ferruginous sandstone, appears to have been relatively common. Consequently,
lithic materials suitable for tool manufacture would have been a precious and carefully
conserved resource for the more sedentary aboriginal Caddo populations that lived in
the Prairie Creek and Big Cypress Creek areas after ca. AD 800, but less so for more
mobile populations whose living area encompassed a broader swath of territory. This
rarity in knappable stone undoubtedly contributed to the relative infrequency of knapping
debris and finished chipped stone tools from the site, and the extensive resharpening
and re-tooling efforts made to extend the life of finished tools. The prehistoric occupants
were lithic raw material consumers when it came to the use of any high-quality lithic raw
materials that may have come their way.
In the general East Texas area, only the Pisgah Ridge chert in the Trinity River basin,
Manning fused glass in the Manning Formation (part of the Jackson group of Eocene age),
and various cherts and quartzites in the Catahoula Formation (exposed in the Neches River
basin) are in âgeological formations that contain in situ rocks suitable for the manufacture
of stone toolsâ (Banks 1990:49). There are also upland stream gravels that are relatively
widespread in parts of East Texas, including the Sulphur, Big Cypress, and Sabine River
basins (Banks 1990:56â57). High quality and knappable cobbles of chert, novaculite,
and jasper are present in the Red River gravels in northeastern Texas (as well as in the
Bowie gravels in the Red-Sulphur River interfluve, see Cliff et al. 1996a; Dowd 2011), and
these are ultimately derived from chert-bearing formations in the Ouachita Mountains of
southeastern Oklahoma (Banks 1990:Figure 1.20).
There are redeposited gravels on stream terraces in the Big Cypress and Sabine River
basins that contain small cobbles and pebbles of petrified wood, fine-grained quartzite,
and various cherts. The local cherts tend to be red, tan, yellowish-brown, and brown in
color. Non-local cherts found on sites in this part of East Texas are apparently from both
392 AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

Central Texas Edwards Plateau and Ouachita Mountains sources. The former are lustrous
gray, blue-gray, and dark brown in color, and will have (if present) a light brown or white
cortex, sometimes chalky in appearance. Ouachita Mountain source materials in gravels
include various dark brown, gray, and black cherts, and several colors of novaculite.
Local lithic raw materials include coarse- and fine-grained quartzite, petrified or silicifed
wood, ferruginous sandstone, and several varieties of earth-toned cherts: yellowish-brown,
gray, red, light brown, brown, greenish-brown, and a reddish-brown color. Non-local raw
materials are white, yellow, gray, and red novaculite, black chert, dark brown chert, dark
gray chert, dark grayish-brown chert, white chert, bluish-gray chert, a yellowish-red chert,
and quartz.
To assess the availability of knappable lithic raw materials in the Prairie Creek area, a
reconnaissance of upland and valley landforms was made for raw material sources from
the Kitchen Branch site area to the east and the Keering site (41CP21) area to the west
(Figures 11-1 and 11-2). A total of nine areas were identified where locally available and
identifiable knappable lithic raw materials were present in surface contexts.
These areasâin both upland and valley settingsâeach contain quartzite pebbles and
cobbles, both fine-grained and/or coarse-grained (Table 11-1). Petrified wood pebbles
were present in five of the areas, while earth-toned (yellowish-brown, red, reddish-brown,
and brown) chert pebbles were noted in four areas. Finally, ferruginous sandstone cobbles
were present in an upland setting in Area 7 (see Figure 11-1). The analyzed material was
not retained, but an equivalent collection is being permanently held at TxDOT-ENV in Austin
for future research purposes.
These raw materials vary in size from pebbles to cobbles. Weights obtained from the raw
materials range from: 0.01-6.4 kg (fine-grained quartzite); 0.02â2.7 kg (coarse-grained
quartzite); 0.01â0.03 kg (chert); 0.015â0.42 kg (petrified wood); and 0.40 kg (ferruginous
sandstone). The largest source materialsâboth kinds of quartziteâare in Area 1 by the
Kitchen Branch site (see Figure 11-1). This was the only area that had cobbles that weighed
more than 1.0 kg each (ranging in size from 170-290 mm in length, 10-230 mm in width,
and 40-190 mm in thickness, with the largest cobble weighing 6.4 kg). None of the lithic
raw materials in any of the other areas weighed more than 0.5 kg.
Insights into the character of the locally available lithic raw materials in the Kitchen Branch
site area are also provided by the occurrence of several unmodified and stream-rolled
cobbles recovered in the siteâs archeological deposits (Table 11-2). These cobbles, ranging
from 90.6â215.6 mm in length and 60.0â155.6 mm in width (about half the size of the
largest cobbles in Source Area 1), are a coarse-grained quartzite, ranging from pale brown,
white, to weak red in color. The largest of the cobbles weighs 6.67 kg. None of the cobbles
have been heat-treated, but it is likely they would need to have been to facilitate chipped
stone knapping of this coarse-grained raw material. Coarse-grained quartzite was noted in
eight of the nine Prairie Creek source areas.

Other locally available lithic raw materials include hematite and ferruginous sandstone
cobbles and slabs. These materials were used in the production of chipped and polished
gouges as well as a variety of ground stone tools. Such materials could have been collected
from nearby stream gravels as well as upland bedrock exposures.

Nature of the Lithic Assemblage and Its Horizontal-Vertical Character
More than 5,150 lithic artifacts comprise the Kitchen Branch assemblage recovered during
both test excavations and the data recovery work, and primarily consist of lithic debris
(85 percent) and fire-cracked rock (8 percent), additional items of smaller proportions
of chipped stone tools (4 percent), ground stone tools (1.2 percent), and cores/tested
cobbles-pebbles (0.9 percent).
396 AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

By level in the archeological deposits, the greatest numbers of lithic artifacts occur between
20â40 cm bs (Table 11-3), and the artifacts from these two levels comprise approximately
50 percent of the site sample. The 0â20 cm bs and 40â50 cm bs levels comprise another
33 percent of the assemblage. Slightly more than 6 percent of the lithic artifacts are from
features. Overall, however, the density of lithic artifacts at the site is quite low, with a range
of only 4.0â7.75 artifacts per m2 (estimated as an average of all 10-centimeter levels
within all excavated units - primarily the main excavation block), and only 36.32â59.66
lithic artifacts per m3 The highest densities per m2 and m3 are in the 20â40 cm bs levels:
7.00â7.75 per m2 and 59.28â59.66 per m.3

There are differences in the vertical distribution of the lithic artifact categories when the
absolute numbers by level are converted to densities per m2 and m3. Although overall, the
density of lithic artifacts is rather low across the site and in all depths, these differences
are most pronounced between the 0â40 cm bs and 50â60+ cm bs archeological deposits,
suggesting that these differences may have both stratigraphic and temporal implications.
In the case of the chipped stone tools (gouges, bifaces, flake tools, dart points, and arrow
points), the highest densities in m2 (0.38â0.41) and m3 (2.96â3.13) are in the 40â50
cm bs and 60+ cm bs levels (Figure 11-3a), the levels dominated by Woodland and Late
Archaic dart points.
The density of ground stone tools is much the same (see Figure 11-3b). The highest density
of ground stone tools is in the 60+ cm bs levels, at 0.19 per m2 and 1.41 per m3. However,
there are secondary peaks in ground stone tool density in the 40â50 cm bs and 20â30
cm bs levels (0.09 per m2 and 0.71â0.73 per m3). The frequency of ground stone tools in
the 20â30 cm level certainly leaves open the possibility that some of these tools are the
product of the ancestral Caddo occupations at the Kitchen Branch site although ground
stone tools other than celts are generally infrequent on East Texas Caddo sites.

Cores and tested cobbles/
pebbles occur in all levels in
the archeological deposits
(see Table 9-3), but their
highest relative densities
occur in the 40â60 cm bs
levels. In these levels, cores
and tested cobbles/pebbles
have densities of 0.07â0.13
per m2 and 0.61â1.0 per m3,
while the 0â40 cm deposits

Finally, fire-cracked rock is
present in varying amounts
in the archeological deposits
(see Table 9-3). The highest
densities (by count) are in
the 40â50 cm bs and 60+
cm bs levels (see Figure
11-3e). These densities
range from 0.64â1.22 per
m2 and 5.0â9.22 per m3.
Fire-cracked rock densities

only range from 0.32â0.42 per m2 and 1.93â3.53 per m3 in the 0â40 cm bs archeological
deposits, two to three times less in frequency when compared to the deeper archeological
deposits at the Kitchen Branch site.
The spatial and vertical distribution of arrow points at the Kitchen Branch site block
excavations is depicted in Figure 11-4. The uppermost deposits (0â30 cm bs) have a range
of arrow point types distributed across the northern and central block areas in proximity to
clusters of post holes marking at least one Caddo structure, and in extra-mural or outdoor

activity areas to the south of the post hole clusters. Although the number of arrow points is
less in the 30â40 cm bs level, they have basically the same spatial distribution across the
block excavations (see Figure 11-4).
In the 40â50 cm bs and 50â60 cm bs levels, the few arrow pointsâprimarily those of
Late Caddo temporal affiliationâare found in the northern part of the block excavations
(see Figure 11-4). Finally, two of the three arrow points in the 60+ cm bs levels are in the
southern part of the block excavations.
Flake tools are widely distributed across the block excavations, particularly in the 20â30,
30â40, and 40â50 cm bs levels (Figure 11-5). In levels likely associated with clusters
of post holes marking at least one Caddo structure (i.e. 20â30 cm bs and 30â40 cm bs
levels), flake tools are found primarily in proximity to the structures in the northern block,
and their occurrence in the central block probably marks extra-mural activity areas where
flake tools were used and eventually discarded. There are several clusters of flake tools in
the 40â50 cm bs level, in both the northern and central parts of the block (Figure 11-5).
In the upper levels (0â40 cm bs) in the archeological deposits, bifaces have much the same
spatial distribution as the flake tools, with the exception that several bifaces are found in
the far southern part of the block (see Figure 11-5). This may signify a tool manufacturing
area. There are several clusters of bifaces in the 40â60+ cm bs levels, primarily in the
northern and central parts of the block, where they occur in proximity to clusters of flake
tools (see Figure 11-5).
Gouges are present in the 20â30, 30â40, and 40â50 cm bs levels in the Kitchen Branch
site block excavations (see Figure 11-5). In the uppermost level, they occur only in the
northern block. In the 30â40 cm bs level, the one gouge was recovered in the central
block, while they are more widely distributed in all block areas in the 40â50 cm bs level
(see Figure 11-5). Three of the gouges are clustered in the northern part of the north block
(see Figure 11-5).
Dart points of a number of different types are well represented throughout the archeological
deposits at the Kitchen Branch site (Figure 11-6), especially in the 20â30, 30â40, and
40â50 cm bs levels. The most common dart point type, the Gary point (of Woodland
period age) is present in all levels, clustering in the northern and central parts of the block
excavations at all depths.
Yarbrough points, the most common of the Late Archaic dart points at the site, is present
from 20â60+ cm bs in the block excavations, but there are no notable spatial clusters
(see Figure 11-6). The few Middle Archaic and Late Paleoindian/Early Archaic dart points
occur in low numbers from 20â60+ cm bs in the northern and central parts of the block
excavations (see Figure 11-6).

Ground stone tools are distributed throughout the Kitchen Branch site block excavations
(Figure 11-7). In the upper levels (0â40 cm bs), the ground stone tools are found primarily
in both the northern and central parts of the block, in and in proximity to clusters of post
holes that represent the location of at least one Caddo structure. Most of these tools are
in what is best characterized as extra-mural or outdoor activity areas, the main one being
to the south of the structure areas in the central block area (see Figure 11-7, 20â30 cm bs
level).

In the deeper levels, there are clusters of ground stone tools in the northern (40â50 cm bs
and 50â60 cm bs) and central (40â50 cm bs) block areas (see Figure 9-7). Ground stone
tools are clustered in the southern block area in the 60+ cm bs levels.
Cores and tested cobbles/tested pebbles are widely dispersed across the excavation block
both spatially and vertically (Figure 11-8). In the upper levels (i.e. 0â30 cm bs), they are
found primarily in the northern part of the block, in the vicinity of the cluster of post holes
marking at least one Caddo structure. In the 30â40 cm bs level, the cores and tested
cobbles/pebbles are more widely distributed in the central and northern block areas,
again in proximity to at least one Caddo structure, a which of which appear to have been
discarded within the structure itself.
Cores and tested cobbles/pebbles are more concentrated and numerous in the 40â50
cm bs level (see Figure 11-8), being confined to the southern part of the northern block and
across the central part of the block excavations. In the lowest depths of the excavations
(50â60+ cm bs levels), the cores and tested cobbles/pebbles are found mainly in the
central and southern block areas, suggesting a locus of pre-Caddo archeological deposits.
The distribution of lithic debris at the Kitchen Branch site is not notably clustered spatially
across the block excavations. There are small peaks in density in the northern and central
block in the 0â20, 20â30, and 30â40 cm bs levels (Figure 11-9), in areas in proximity
to at least one Caddo structure, but primarily in what may e interpreted as extra-mural or
outdoor activity areas. Conversely, below 40 cm bs, clusters of lithic debris occur primarily
in the central and southern parts of the block excavation, in the same areas as peaks in
the distribution of core and tested cobble/pebbles (see Figure 11-8).
Low densities characterize the distribution of fire-cracked rocks in the 0â40 cm bs levels at
the Kitchen Branch site (Figure 11-10), except for small peaks in several areas in the 0â20
cm bs and 30â40 cm bs levels. Densities of fire-cracked rock are much more pervasive in
the 40â50 and 50â60 cm bs levels across all parts of the block excavations, while there
are several peaks in the 60 cm+ bs levels in the northern and central part of the block
(Figure 11-10).

Arrow Points
A total of 44 arrow points and arrow point preforms have been recovered in the test
excavations and data recovery investigations at the Kitchen Branch site (Table 11-4). This
includes eight preforms, 10 unidentifiable fragments (i.e. tip, medial, and stem/blade
fragments), and 26 arrow points that can be identified as a specific defined type with a
known geographical distribution and temporal range (i.e. Turner et al. 2011).
The arrow points are found throughout the archeological deposits, from 0â70 cm bs, as
well as in two features (Table 11-5). About 60 percent of the arrow points are from 0â30

and 40â50 cm bs (11 percent).

The distribution of arrow points vertically does not substantiate the notion that there
are stratigraphically distinct archeological deposits at the Kitchen Branch site that are
characterized by stylistically distinct arrow point forms. The Late Caddo, Titus phase, arrow
point types from the site occur from 0â70 cm bs, as do earlier arrow point types, although
they are concentrated from 0â20 cm bs; possible Middle Caddo cf. Bonham-Perdiz points
occur from 0â70 cm bs, with no vertical concentrations in the archeological deposits; and
stemmed and notched arrow point types thought to date from ca. AD 800â1300 occur from
0â60 cm bs. The latter points are concentrated between 0â30 cm bs (Table 11-5). The ca.
AD 800â1300 arrow points are most common, comprising 54 percent of the typologically
identifiable points (see Table 11-5). The frequency of these earlier arrow point typesâin
the absence of more than a handful of ceramic sherds that can be identified of this age in
the assemblage (see Chapter 6, this volume)âsuggests that the Kitchen Branch site was
used by early Caddo groups primarily for hunting and tool refurbishing activities, rather
than much in the way of generalized domestic activities.

gray cherts, brown jasper,
and novaculite (orange).
The points are primarily unifacially-flaked (80 percent), and several have blade serrations
(Figure 11-12a-b). In Big Cypress Creek sites, contracting stem Perdiz arrow points are
most commonly found in post-AD 1300 Middle and Late Caddo sites, notably so in ca. AD
1450â1550 Titus phase sites in the region (see Turner 1978).
Three arrow points are classified as the Bonham-Perdiz or cf. Bonham-Perdiz type (see
Figure 11-12câd). This nomenclature follows Shafer (2008:57), the purpose being to
differentiate the tapered contracting stem of the Perdiz point from the parallel and then
tapered stems of the Bonham-Perdiz point. Such points have been found in 14th and 15th
century Middle Caddo period contexts in East Texas sites. The examples from the Kitchen
Branch site are unifacially flaked, have no blade serrations, and are made from non-local

The single cf. Homan corner-notched arrow point is made from a heat-treated quartzite.
It is unifacially flaked, with blade serrations and wide barbs, and a short expanding stem
(see Figure 11-13e). These arrow points likely date to the earliest Caddo settlement of the
region, from ca. AD 850â1000.

Both the Steiner and Catahoula arrow points are some of the earliest arrow point forms
found in East Texas archeological sites. Shafer and Walters (2010; see also Turner et al.
[2011:185, 211]) suggest these points may have been made after ca. AD 700, and prior
to AD 1100, from the latter part of the Woodland period to the Early Caddo period.
The Steiner arrow points (n=3) from the Kitchen Brach site are made from local chert and
quartzite, as well as a non-local pinkish-gray (likely heat-treated) gray chert. They are both
unifacially and bifacially flaked, with serrated blades and barbed shoulders, an expanding
stem, and the points that have been bifacially flaked also have upward-pointing barbs on
the blade (Figure 11-14aâc).
One of the distinctive
attributes of the Catahoula
arrow points (n=3) from
the Kitchen Branch site are
their broad blades and large
projecting barbs (see Figure
11-14dâe). These points are
made from local chert and
quartzite, and 67 percent
have been bifacially flaked;
these
bifacially
flaked
points also have serrated
blades.
The
unifacially
flaked Catahoula point lacks
serrations, and has cortex
on the blade (see Figure
11-14e).

Arrow Point Preforms
The arrow point preforms are ovoid-shaped
unifacial (n=6) and bifacially (n=2) chipped
flakes (Figure 11-15) that were intended for
the manufacture of arrow points, but were
discarded before knapping was completed.
The preforms range between 18.0â22.5 mm in
length, 10.9â18.0 mm in width, and 2.2â4.6
mm in thickness. One preform has cortex on
the blade (Figure 9-8a), but the other selected
flakes were non-cortical. All of the preforms
were made from either local quartzite (62.5
percent) or local brown and red chert (37.5
percent).

Dart Points
There are 93 dart points, dart point fragments, and dart point preforms recovered from
the test excavations and data recovery work at the Kitchen Branch site (Table 11-6). This
includes 10 fragments (tip and medial fragments, and unidentifiable pieces), four preforms,
and 79 typologically identifiable dart points that can be assigned to Woodland (ca. 2500â
1200 years BP), Late Archaic (ca. 5000â2500 years BP), Middle Archaic (ca. 8000â5000
years BP), and Late Paleoindian (ca. 10,500â10,000 years BP) periods (cf. Story 1990;
Perttula 2013f:34 and Figure 2). Of the typologically and temporally identifiable dart points
in the assemblage, 67 percent are considered to be of Woodland period age, another 24
percent are of Late Archaic age, five percent are Middle Archaic in age, and four percent
are of Late Paleoindian age.

Our proposed temporal ordering of dart points in the East Texas Archaic and Woodland
periods draws first upon the few available absolute dates from East Texas on Archaic sites,
as well as the known sequences of dart points in surrounding regions, such as Southwest
Arkansas (Schambach 1998; Trubitt 2009), Northwest and Northern Louisiana (Girard
2000; Girard et al. 2011; Rees 2010; Saunders 2010), the Missouri Ozarks (Ray et al.
2009), and Central Texas (Collins 1998; Collins et al. 2011), and chronological periods of
use offered by Turner et al. (2011). A recent cladistics study (see OâBrien and Lyman 2003;
Lipo et al. 2006) of 93 Texas dart point types that has plotted the statistical affinities
among the various types (Carpenter and Paquin 2010:158 and Figures 2 and 3) was
also relied upon for estimating temporal ages of dart points. From these relationships,
Carpenter and Paquin (2010:Figure 4) proposed hypothetical relationships between dart
point types âbased on overlap in temporal, spatial, and formal attributes.â
Based on these various lines of evidence, as well as the suggested chronological
sequences for East Texas dart points proposed by Story (1990:Figure 32) and Thurmond
(1990:Table 8), the Early Archaic dart point sequence begins with Dalton and San Patrice
points, although both point types were first made sometime prior to 10,000 years BP
(Koldehoff and Walthall 2009: Ray et al. 2009) and are often considered to be diagnostic
of the Late Paleoindian period in the broader region. Recent radiocarbon dates from the
Big Eddy site in southwest Missouri indicates both points were made and used until ca.
9800 years BP (Ray et al. 2009:160), in the early years of the Late Paleoindian-Early
Archaic technological, subsistence, and settlement/mobility transition. Later Early Archaic
points (ca. 9800â9000 years BP) include the Breckenridge, Scottsbluff, and Keithville
416 AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

types (Webb 2000:4), as well as later Pelican, Graham Cave, and Rice Lobed points (ca.
8500â8000 years BP).
Proposed early Middle Archaic points in East Texas include the Hidden Valley and Kirk types,
as well as the Palmer type, although these are points that are not particularly common in
East Texas dart point assemblages (e.g., Jones 1957; Rogers and Perttula 2004; Furman
and Amick 2006; Turner 2006:Table 7). Between 6500â5000 years BP, Middle Archaic
points are suggested to include the Cossatot, Johnson, Jakie Stemmed, White River sidenotched points (sometimes referred to as Big Sandy points, see Ray and Lopinot 2003),
Bell and Andice (or Calf Creek), and the distinctive blade-notched Evans point.
In the early part of the Late Archaic period (ca. 5000â4000 years BP), East Texas dart point
assemblages may be expected to include Bulverde, Carrollton, Wells, Williams, and Trinity
types, as well as Palmillas and Neches River. Dart points posited to date primarily to the
latter part of the Late Archaic (ca. 3800â2500 years BP) include Yarbrough (although the
dating evidence for this point type is contradictory on East Texas sites), Pontchartrain, Ellis,
and Marshall types, as well as Dawson, Epps, and Motley types. The ubiquitous contracting
stem Gary point appears to have been made and used beginning at the end of the Late
Archaic (cf. Schambach 1998), but fully flourished as a dart point/knife throughout the
later Woodland period, along with the Kent and Godley dart point types.
The dart points are found from 0â90 cm bs in the archeological deposits, and are also
present in two features (Table 11-7). The greatest frequencies of dart points occur
from 20â50 cm bs, but the dart points of different ages do not occur in vertically or
stratigraphically discrete contexts at the Kitchen Branch site.
The Woodland period dart points are most abundant between 20â50 cm bs, while Late
Archaic dart points are most common between 30â50 cm; Middle Archaic points are
found only between 20â50 cm bs. The few Late Paleoindian Dalton points are distributed
from 40â80 cm bs (see Table 9-7). Woodland period dart points are most frequent in each
of the arbitrary levels between 0â70 cm bs. They account for 71 percent of the dart points
from 0â50 cm bs, 50 percent of the dart points from 50â60 cm bs, and 89 percent of the
dart points from 60â70 cm bs.
Not including preforms, contracting stem Gary dart points account for 58 percent of the
typologically identifiable dart points at the Kitchen Branch site (Figure 11-16). They are
primarily bifacially chipped and generally have resharpened blades (see Table 11-6),
suggesting their use as knives or cutting tools as well as refurished projectile points. About
11 percent of the Gary points are unifacially flaked, and the remainder were shaped and
thinned through bifacial soft hammer and pressure flaking. More than 23 percent of the
Gary points have cortex at the base, indicating they were made on flakes rather than being
reduced from a pebble mass. About 80 percent of the Gary points at the Kitchen Branch
site were made from local quartzite and cherts, but the remainder were manufactured from

width at the shoulder, and are relatively thin along the blade or stem (Table 11-8). In
Schambachâs (1982:Tables 7.3â7.4) consideration of Gary points, he defines var. LeFlore
(ca. 2300â1700 years BP) and var. Camden (ca. 1700â1200 years BP) based in part
on the blade thickness and stem width, as Gary points apparently became narrower and
thinner during their manufacture through the Woodland period. Gary, var. LeFlore dart
points tended to be 7â8 mm in thickness and had a stem width that ranged between
16â17 mm. Gary, var. Camden points were the same blade thickness on average (7 mm),
but had narrower stem widths of 13â15 mm. More than 50 percent of the Gary dart points
at the Kitchen Branch site had stem widths less than 13.0 mm, and 74 percent had blade
thicknesses less than 7 mm (Table 11-8).

On this basis, 12 of the Gary points from the site are classified as Gary, var. Camden and
another four points as Gary, var. LeFlore. None of the Gary points can be classified as
the pre-2300 BP. Gary, var. Gary points, which have very wide stems (22â23 mm) and
thick blades (10â11 mm). The other contracting stem Gary pointsâwith narrow stems
less than 13 mm in width and thin blades less than 7.0 mm in thicknessâmay represent
the latest temporal stage in the manufacture of contracting stem dart points, perhaps
falling at the latter end of the Woodland period, ca. 1250 years BP. These small Gary
points, which comprise 50 percent of the more complete contracting stem dart points in
the assemblage, have been called Garyito points by Webb et al. (1969:44).
Another Woodland period point style in
the Kitchen Branch tool assemblage is
a stem fragment of a Godley point from
80â90 cm bs in Unit 10. The Godley
point is made from a fine-grained and
heat-treated local quartzite and has
an expanding stem, a convex base,
and corner notches.
The Kent dart points (n=6) are also
included among the Woodland period
series of points from the Kitchen
Branch site. These points are made
on both local quartzites as well as a
greenish-gray Ouachita Mountains
quartzite, a non-local gray chert, and
an orange novaculite. The Kent points
are bifacially flaked, with resharpened
blades, squared stems, and flat bases
(Figure 11-17câd).

For our purposes, the Ellis and Edgewood dart points are included with the Late Archaic
series of dart points from the site, although these points are not well-dated by radiocarbon
assays in the region, and they could just as readily be assigned to the Woodland period
dart point series. Turner et al. (2011:91, 93) suggest that the Ellis point dates from the
Late to Transitional Archaic, while the Edgewood point is thought to date to the Transitional
Archaic. Turner et al. (2011:47) date the Transitional Archaic to the period between 300
BCâAD 700, which in East Texas falls squarely in the Woodland period. The one Edgewood
point is from a scrape area at the northern part of the excavation area. It is made from a
fine-grained quartzite, is bifacially chipped, has a resharpened blade, barbed shoulders,
and a wide expanding stem (see Figure 11-17a). The Ellis dart points are both made from
non-local lithic raw materials, including a grayish-brown chert and a gray novaculite. These
dart points have shallow corner notches, barbs, and an expanding stem; the blades on
both had been resharpened (see Figure 11-17b).

Yarbrough dart points
represent 58 percent
of
the
identifiable
Late Archaic points in
the assemblage (see
Tables 11-6 and 11-7).
These dart points have
expanding stems that
are sometimes beveled,
non-barbed shoulders,
bifacially
worked
blades, and a flat base
(Figure 11-18); none
of the stems have
edge grinding. More
than 90 percent of the

The Morrill point has a
wide rectangular stem
and small barbs (Figure 11-19a), while the Williams points have a broad blade and an
expanding stem with a convex, rounded base (Figure 9-19bâc).
Other Late Archaic dart point types at the Kitchen Branch site include one Carrollton
point and one that compares favorably to the Neches River, or Neches (see Turner et al.
2011:141), type. The Carrollton point is made from a non-local brownish-gray chert, is
bifacially chipped, with resharpened blades, prominent shoulders and small barbs, and a
relatively long and narrow stem. The Neches point, from Unit 157, 15â20 cm bs, is made
from a coarse-grained heat-treated quartzite. It is bifacially flaked, resharpened on the
blade, with a rectangular stem and a rounded basal edge.

The likely Middle Archaic dart points in the Kitchen Branch
site include one Cossatot point, along with a broad-bladed
side-notched dart point of unknown type. The Cossatot
side-notched dart point, made from a gray novaculite, has
a concave base and a resharpened blade (Figure 11-20a).
The other side-notched dart point has a broad resharpened
blade, which had been previously damaged by an impact
fracture (Figure 11-20b). The point may be related to both
Big Sandy and White River side notched points that have
been dated to 7150â6450 years cal. BP (see Trubitt 2009).
Dart points with more prominent side notching tend to be
of Middle Archaic (ca. 8000â5000 years BP) age in the
Trans-Mississippi South region.
Both Wells points have been made from heat-treated local
quartzite. They are bifacially flaked, with resharpened and/
or beveled blades, and have long contracting stems (Figure
11-21aâb). One of the two points has edge grinding on the
long stem.
Three Dalton lanceolate points of Late Paleoindian age
are in the collections from the Kitchen Branch site (Figure
11-22aâc). Each is made from a bifacially worked non-local
chert (gray, dark gray, and yellowish-gray). They have edge
and basal grinding, noticeable basal concavities (2.8â5.5
mm), and pronounced ears at the end of the stem. The
blades have been resharpened and/or beveled from heavy
use, and one of the Dalton points has been resharpened
into a final stage drill.

Dart Point Preforms
The dart point preforms from the Kitchen Branch site were thick (9.4â13.9 mm), bifacially
flaked pieces of heat-treated quartzite with broad contracting stems (see Figure 11-16b).
These preforms were intended for the manufacture of Gary points. Three of the four
preforms have cortex on the blade and/or the stem.

Use of Lithic Raw Material in Arrow and Dart Points
Several different kinds of lithic raw materials were used in the manufacture of arrow points
and dart points at the Kitchen Branch site. This included local quartzite (both coarse and
fine-grained), local earth-toned cherts, non-local cherts (likely from Ouachita Mountains and
Red River gravel source areas), non-local jasper (from Red River gravels, see Dowd 2011),
and non-local novaculite from Ouachita Mountains and Red River gravel source areas
(Table 11-9). The proportions of local versus non-local lithic raw materials in these tools is
direct evidence for the kinds of raw materials that were preferred for point manufacture at
different times during the occupation of the site, as well as the accessibility (either through
trade/exchange or direct procurement) of these materials through time.

Among the arrow points, local raw materials account for 77.2 percent of the sample. About
70 percent of the arrow points made from local lithic raw materials are made on quartzite
(see Table 11-9), with the remainder on local cherts. However, only the Maud, cf. Homan,
and Scallorn points are made exclusively from local quartzite, while only the Colbert arrow
points are made exclusively from local chert.
Non-local lithic raw materials account for 22.7 percent of the arrow points, primarily cherts
(50 percent of the arrow points made from non-local raw materials are made from cherts)
and novaculite (30 percent). Non-local lithic raw materials are represented in the arrow
point fragments (10 percent), Perdiz (100 percent), cf. Perdiz (100 percent), BonhamPerdiz (100 percent), cf. Bonham-Perdiz (100 percent), and Steiner (33 percent) arrow
points.
In the case of the dart points, 75.3 percent of them are made from local lithic raw
materials. In contrast to the arrow points, where a substantial proportion of the local raw
materials used in arrow point manufacture were earth-toned cherts, the locally-made dart
points are almost always on quartzite (97 percent of the dart points are made of locally
available raw materials). The only dart points made from local cherts are two Woodland
period Gary points. It is likely that local chert pebbles were generally too small for dart
point manufacture. Non-local cherts and novaculite are about equally represented in the
dart points, at 11.8 percent and 12.9 percent, respectively (see Table 11-9).

424 AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

By temporal period, non-local lithic raw materials are best represented in the Late
Paleoindian period, as 100 percent of the Dalton points have been made from Ouachita
Mountains/Red River gravels cherts. The proportions of non-local lithic raw materials in
the dart points from Middle Archaic, Late Archaic, and Woodland periods are 50 percent,
14 percent, and 21 percent, respectively. Non-local cherts and novaculite were readily
and consistently available (whatever the mechanism of procurement was) to the huntergatherer groups that used the Kitchen Branch site between ca. 8000â1200 years BP.

Other Chipped Stone Tools
Other chipped stone tools in the Kitchen Branch lithic assemblage include bifaces (n=43),
flake tools and scrapers (n=45), and gouges (n=12). These tools occur throughout the
archeological deposits (i.e. from 0â80 cm bs) and in one feature.

Bifaces
There are 43 bifaces in the Kitchen Branch chipped stone assemblage (Table 11-10).
These are found from 0â70 cm bs in the archeological deposits as well as in one feature,
but are concentrated between 30â50 cm bs (see Table 9-3). Almost 12 percent of the
bifaces are made from non-local lithic raw materials.

The bifaces are categorized in terms of stages, following the TxDOT (n.d.) protocol for lithic
analysis. Stage 1 bifaces represent the initial reduction of a raw material mass and the
beginning steps of tool manufacture. Stage 2 bifaces represent blank preparation, namely
the âproduction of a less generalized form with a limited set of possible final trajectoriesâ
(TxDOT n.d.:13). Stage 3 bifaces represent preform shaping and thinning, with the goal
he production of a limited number of morphological forms (i.e. projectile points or knives).
Stage 4 bifaces are finished tools with final edge trimming and resharpening, as well as
ânotching, edge grinding, and final stem preparationâ (TxDOT n.d.:14). Stage 5 bifaces
are rejuvenated forms. In a few instances, bifaces at the Kitchen Branch site could not
be confidently assigned to one or another of the biface stages, either because they were
fragmentary pieces (i.e. Stage 3/4 bifaces), or it was not clear if the biface form represented
a completed tool or a tool whose final form was not clear (a Stage 4/5 biface), although the
biface in question was heavily
use worn (see Shoberg, below).
The Stage 1 bifaces (n=3) are
found from 30â70 cm bs in
the archeological deposits.
They all have cortex-covered
surfaces, from both streamrolled and bedrock sources.
These bifaces range from
33.0â43.9 mm in length,
29.4â34.9 mm in width, and
15.0â16.4 mm in thickness.
They are also on local lithic
raw materials, including heattreated quartzite (n=2) and
brown chert (n=1) (Figure
11-23).

The 11 Stage 2 bifaces occur from 20â80 cm bs, but are concentrated between 30â60
cm bs in the archeological deposits. They are all on local lithic raw materials: heat-treated
quartzite (n=8), ferruginous sandstone (n=2), and brown chert (n=1). About 36 percent of
the Stage 2 bifaces have cortex (including smoothed and roughened surfaces, indicating
raw material procurement from stream gravels and bedrock sources). Complete Stage 2
bifaces range from 29.9â58.9 mm in length, 26.1â39.0 mm in width, and 8.0â28.2 mm
in thickness (Figure 11-24).
The Stage 3 bifaces (n=14) occur throughout the archeological deposits (0â70 cm bs), but
are concentrated between 0â20 cm bs, and 30â50 cm bs (see Table 11-10). These bifaces
(Figure 11-25) are on local lithic raw materials: heat-treated quartzite (n=9), non-heattreated quartzite (n=2), ferruginous sandstone (n=1), red chert (n=1), and yellow chert
(n=1). Approximately 21 percent of the Stage 3 bifaces have cortex (stream-rolled and

3 heat-treated quartzite
bifaces has evidence of use
wear on its proximal end.
The larger of the complete
Stage 3 bifaces range from
43.1â48.6 mm in length,
26.0â26.2 mm in width, and
10.7â14.9 mm in thickness;
another complete Stage
3 biface may be an arrow
point preform; it is 18.1 mm
in length, 15.0 mm in width,
and 3.6 mm in thickness).
There are three fragmentary
(distal and medial) Stage
3/4 bifaces in the Kitchen
Branch lithic tools (see Table
11-10). They occur from
0â40 cm bs, and are made
from local heat-treated
quartzite. None have cortical
remnants.

The fragmentary Stage
4 bifaces (n=3) are from
20â40 cm bs (see Table
Figure 11-25. Bifaces, Stage 3: a, west of northwest
11-10). They are made from
corner of Block #1, 62 cm bs; b, Unit 138, 50â60 cm bs;
local heat-treated quartzite,
c, Unit 157, 37 cm bs; d, Unit 10, 50â60 cm bs.
and none of the pieces have
cortical remnants (Figure
11-26). One of these Stage 4 bifaces has evidence of use wear along one lateral edge.
There is one Stage 4/5 biface, found between 20â30 cm bs (see Table 11-10). It is made
from a non-local grayish-brown chert. The biface has extensive evidence of use wear (see
Shoberg, below), but no cortical remnants. This complete biface is 64.3 mm in length,
30.7 mm in width, and 11.3 mm in thickness.
There are eight indeterminate biface fragments (see Table 11-10). These occur from 0â60
cm bs. Half of the indeterminate biface fragments are made from non-local lithic raw
materials: gray novaculite (n=2), dark brown chert (n=1), and black chert (n=1). These
fragments are likely from completed tools that were brought to the site, and were eventually
discarded there when they were broken during use.

Microwear Analysis of
Three Bifacial Stone
Tools, Marilyn Shoberg
Three stone tools from the
Kitchen Branch site were
submitted for microwear
analysis by Mason Miller of
AmaTerra Environmental,
Inc. to Marilyn Shoberg
(Figure 11-27). The three
artifacts were cleaned
by brief agitation in an
ultrasonic water bath, each
suspended individually in a
plastic bag with water and
a few drops of ammonia,
and rinsed in distilled
water. Freehand drawings
were made of both faces of
the artifacts for recording
microwear
observations
and the locations of
photomicrographs. After
initial examination at 10X,
microwear attributes such
as edge flaking, polish, and
striations were recorded
and
photographed
at
magnifications from 50X to
500X using a reflected-light
differential-interference
Olympus BH-2 microscope
with Nomarski optics.

Artifact Bag 953 (Unit 105, 40â50 cm bs; Figure 11-27a) is an end fragment of an early
stage biface (Stage 2, see Table 9-10) made of metaquartzite. This raw material is
particularly challenging for microwear analysis because of the density of reflective crystals
on all surfaces which masks small areas of polish (Appendix 11-1). However, the bifacial
edge, fracture edges, and ridges were carefully examined at high magnification and there
is no microwear evidence in the form of polish, striations, or micro-flaking to indicate that
this fragment was used.

Artifact Lot 150 (Unit 5, 60â70 cm bs; Figure 11-27b) is an early stage biface (Stage 1, see
Table 11-10) made of metaquartzite. Cobble cortex remains on one end and one lateral
edge. One sharp bifacially flaked lateral edge has been created. This sharp potentially
usable edge was examined at high magnification on both faces and there is no evidence
that the edge was used. There are small flake scars on the irregular surfaces at the distal
end of the biface, but there is no evidence at high magnification of polish anywhere on this
edge. This biface was not used.
Artifact Bag 1301 (27 cm bs, w. hand-scraped area, west of Unit 123; Figure 11-27c) is
a large complete and late stage triangular biface (Stage 4/5, see Table 11-10) with a
straight base made of high quality grayish-brown chert. At low magnification the edges are
rounded and polished (Figure 11-28).
Invasive polish is very well-developed on flake scar ridges on all edges, and multi-directional
striations, parallel and oblique to the edge, are visible (Figures 11-29 and 11-30). Invasive
polish on the high and low microtopography of the chert surface
is from contact with soft animal
tissue.

Figure 11-28. Image 1301 side 1c @ 50X;
the edge is rounded and polished.

Figure 11-29. Image 1301 side 1c @ 200X. Deep striations originating
at the edge of the biface are direct evidence of the edge having been
used to cut soft animal tissue in the presence of grit particles.
430 AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Polish on the central ridge has
long, deep, coarse striations
roughly parallel to the long axis
that are likely from thrusting
motions (Figure 11-31). Every
surface on this biface has welldeveloped invasive polish from
contact with soft animal tissue,
and multidirectional striations that
reflect multiple cutting motions
(Figure 11-32). This is a very
well used butchering tool.
In sum, the high magnification
microwear analysis of three
bifacial artifacts from the Kitchen
Branch site indicates that the
two early stage biface fragments
made of metaquartzite were
not used. The large complete
late stage chert biface is a very
well used butchering tool with
evidence of cutting animal tissue
on all edges and surfaces.

Flake Tools
A total of 45 flake tools are in the Kitchen Brach site chipped stone tool assemblage
(Table 11-11). They are found from 0â80 cm bs in the archeological deposits, but are
concentrated between 20â50 cm bs (see Table 11-3).
The flake tools include one perforator, six scrapers, and 38 tools with varying combinations
of unilateral, bilateral, and distal retouch/use wear (Figures 11-33 and 11-34). The
retouched flake tools occur throughout the archeological deposits, but the scrapers and
perforators have been recovered only from 0â40 cm bs, suggesting they are associates

cm bs are on non-local raw materials (73 percent), while only 44 percent of the flake tools
from 40â80 cm bs are on non-local lithic raw materials.
The retouched flake tools include those with distal (n=4), unilateral (n=21), bilateral (n=7),
bilateral-opposed edges (n=3), distal and unilateral (n=1), and bilateral retouch on a
bifacial edge (see Table 9-11 and Figures 9-32 and 9-33). About 37 percent of these flake
tools have cortical surfaces (primarily smoothed and stream-rolled, although one unilateral
flake tool has a roughened cortical surface). Use-wear lengths on the unilateral retouched
flake tools range from 7.2â22.9 mm (these ranges include only tools without broken use
wear edges); use wear lengths on bilateral retouched flakes range from 19.4â59.8 mm;
distal retouched flake tools have use wear lengths that range from 6.2â11.0 mm; and the
one unilateral-distal retouched flake tool has a 27.0 mm use wear length.
The retouched flake tools are primarily made from non-local lithic raw materials, as 55
percent of these tools are from non-local sources (i.e. Red River gravels and Ouachita
Mountains sources). These include various fine-grained cherts (gray, black Big Fork chert,

yellow, gray-red, and dark gray), and brown and red jasper. The non-local cherts represent
26 percent of the retouched flake tools, the novaculite 21 percent, and the jasper 8
percent of the retouched flake tools. Local raw materials used for retouched flake tools
include quartzite (32 percent, including both heat-treated and non-heat-treated flakes),
brown chert (8 percent), and petrified wood (5 percent).
The perforator is on a cortical flake of Big Fork chert, a non-local Ouachita Mountains
raw material source. The perforator has bilateral-opposed working edges, with a use wear
length of 24.3 mm.
The scrapers in the Kitchen Branch site chipped stone tools include one side scraper, two
end scrapers, two end-side scrapers (see Figure 11-32e), and a scraper-graver (see Figure
11-32g). Only one of the scrapers is on a cortical flake. Scraper use wear lengths range
from 26.2â79.7 mm (see Table 11-11). Eighty-three percent of the scrapers are on nonlocal raw materials, including gray novaculite, brown-dark brown chert, dark gray chert,

Gouges
The 12 gouge and gouge fragments in the Kitchen Branch archeological deposits are made
from ferruginous sandstone (n=10), jasper (n=1), and petrified wood (n=1). Those with a
specific vertical provenience have been recovered from 20â50 cm bs, with 50 percent
recovered between 40â50 cm bs (see Table 11-3).
The gouges are unifacially flaked tools with a working edge with steep edge angles (50â
90 degrees), and often the opposing ventral face is well polished (Figure 11-35) from
extensive and repetitive use, perhaps in woodworking. Where present (and not removed
during edge rejuvenation), the working edge itself ranges from straight (n=2) to concave
(n=1) to convex (n=4), and they are unifacial-distal
(n=3), unifacial-distal-bilateral (n=1), and unifacialcircumferential (n=3).
The largest of the ferruginous sandstone gouge/
gouge fragments is 74.0 mm in length (see Figure
11-34a), with widths that range from 35â88 in
width and 11â31 mm in thickness. The jasper
gouge (see Figure 11-34b) is 36.9 mm in length,
26.2 mm in width, and 8.8 mm in thickness, while
the petrified wood gouge is 33.5 mm in length,
23.5 mm in width, and 7.6 mm in thickness. These
latter two gouges weigh only 7.4â8.6 g, and would
have been less extensively used than the thick
edged and durable ferruginous sandstone tools
(weighing between 14.7â299.7 g).

Ground Stone Tools
Ground stone tools of several kinds are relatively

interpreted as probable pre-Caddo deposits of Woodland and Late Archaic age. The 40â80
cm bs deposits are considered of pre-Caddo age for purposes of comparative analyses of
ground stone tool manufacture and use between the different components at the Kitchen
Branch site. It is not certain to what component or analytical unit the 30â40 cm bs ground
stone tools belong.
The ground stone tools (n=27) from the upper Late Caddo component (0â30 cm bs) are
dominated by grinding slabs (41 percent) and manos (37 percent), along with grinding
basins (11 percent). Pigment stones are present in this component as well. Grinding slabs
(30 percent) and manos (26 percent) are also common in the lower component (40â80
cm bs, n=27), along with pitted stones (15 percent), but there is a considerable range and
diversity in the ground stone tools from the earlier pre-Caddo occupations. Other ground
stone tools that are more common in the earlier occupations include mano-pitted stones
and pitted stones, while other ground stone tools occur only in the earlier occupations:
metates, mortar, notched pebble, pestle, and pitted stone/abrader (see Table 11-12).
The fact that grinding slabs, grinding basins, metates, and mortars (i.e. stationery platform
tools) are common throughout the archeological deposits at the Kitchen Branch indicates
that the grinding, crushing, and/or pulverizing of plant food remains using hand-held tools
was a particular focus of ground stone tool use. The emphasis of this kind of grinding
in the upper Caddo component appears to have been geared towards the processing of

small seeds and grains (including maize kernels), while the processing of small seeds and
grain was also important in earlier contexts, supplemented by the crushing, grinding, and
pulverizing of harder plant substances on metates and in mortars and grinding basins.
Pitted stones were also used more frequently in the pre-Caddo occupations to crush and
pulverize plant remains such as hickory nutshells.
The one abrader is from an unknown depth in the southernmost scrape area (Figure 11-36).
It is made from a ferruginous sandstone and has three deep U-shaped grooves (4â8 mm
in width and 2â3 mm in diameter) cut on one surface. It is 72.2 mm in length, 75.0 mm
in width, and 35.4 mm in thickness. The wear on abraders is the product of the abrasive
use of the stone to grind, smooth, shape, or sharpen
a variety of implements, including grinding the base
of a projectile point, straightening and polishing an
arrow shaft, and/or sharpening the tip of a bone awl.
The abrader is small enough to be held in the hand,
thus serving as a stationary platform that absorbed
the pressure of rubbing an object across the surface
of the tool.
Three of the four grinding basins from the
Kitchen Branch site occur in the likely Late Caddo
archeological deposits, while the other is from the
pre-Caddo sediments (Table 11-13). All four of the
grinding basins are made from a local coarse-grained
ferruginous sandstone, and have pronounced
concave grinding surfaces (Figure 11-37). The one
complete grinding basin is 111.2 mm in length, 65.3
mm in width, and 29.1 mm in thickness.

Figure 11-36. Abrader from
the southern scrape area.

The grinding basins are analogous to mortars in that they have definite concave grinding
areas on one surface, although not covering as large an area, but there is no evidence

from the grinding to suggest the basin
was confining as was the case for the
one mortar in the assemblage. Manos
and pestles were likely used to grind in
a rotary motion, as well as crush and
pound, specific plant food remains in
the relatively small grinding basins.
Grinding slabs are the most common
ground stone tool in both apparent Late
Caddo and Woodland/Archaic contexts
at the site, accounting for 33 percent
of the ground stone tool sample (Table
Figure 11-37. Grinding basin fragments:
11-14). Grinding slabs are relatively

thickness; the thicker slabs [>29.9 mm]
are restricted to what is interpreted as
the Woodland/Archaic deposits), with
relatively large, flat, and smoothed grinding surfaces that do not extend completely across
the surfaces. Four slabs (18 percent) have concave or flat to concave grinding surfaces,
and 14 percent have polished grinding surfaces, which constitutes evidence of extensive
grinding wear (Figures 11-38 to 11-40). All except for one slab are on otherwise unmodified
ferruginous sandstone rocks; the one exception is a hematite slab from probable and what
are presumed to be Late Caddo deposits.
Hand-held manos are as common as grinding slabs in the Kitchen Branch Late Caddo
and Woodland/Archaic archeological components, likely because they were used together
(i.e. upper hand-held mano and lower stationary platform grinding slab) with slabs to
grind plant remains (Table 11-15). The manos are made primarily from a coarse-grained
ferruginous sandstone (82 percent) or a coarse-grained quartzite (18 percent); the latter
are more loaf-shaped while the others are ovoid in shape (Figures 11-41 and 11-42). Both
materials were used in Caddo and pre-Caddo archeological components. The complete
manos range from 78.4â130.2 mm in length, 52.3â109.4 mm in width, and 10.2â65.4
mm in thickness.
All but two of the manos has only a single grinding surface (see Table 11-15). The manos
with two grinding surfaces were flipped over to continue, or extend the grinding life, the
grinding activities. Grinding surfaces tend to be flat, but several are convex (23 percent)
or concave (9 percent), and smoothed, but 23 percent have a polished grinding surface
from extensive and heavy plant grinding activities. This wear suggests that the substances
being ground were either relatively hard and warranted considerable pressure applied to
a slab or metate during the grinding process, or pressure was applied evenly in a circular
motion, leaving smoothed surfaces with shallow depressions. The manos with concave and
centrally located grinding surfaces suggest they were used with different stroke directions

site have abraded edges, which are commonly seen in manos whose edges were used to
crush pliable plant material.
Manos/pitted stones are made on local hematite and ferruginous sandstone (Table
11-16). They have flat to convex grinding surfaces (one or two surfaces) that range from
smoothed to polished (Figure 11-43). In three instances, the grinding surface has a
centrally-placed pit (16â25.2 mm in diameter and 1â3 mm in depth) worked into the
surface, while the other two mano/pitted stones have a pecked pit on the opposite side
of the tool from the grinding surface. These pits range from 20.5â26 mm in diameter and
2â4 mm in depth, and are evidence of use for the crushing and pounding of hard-surfaced
plant foods. Mano/pitted stones were used for grinding, crushing, and pounding activities,

(Adams 2002:103). The concave grinding
basins are otherwise unmodified except
for grinding areas in the central part of the

from ferruginous sandstone, and has a
concave 90 mm basin area where plant
food remains were ground and pulverized with a stone hand tool (i.e. pestles) (Figure
11-45). The tool itself is 153.0 x 140.1 x 84.8 mm in length, width, and thickness. The
mortar has a distinct confining basin in the central part of the grinding area. The basin
âconfines an intermediate substance [presumably plant foods] that is worked with a pestle
in some combination of crushing, stirring, or pounding strokesâ (Adams 2002:127).

The notched pebble (Unit 50, 50â60 cm bs) is
a ferruginous sandstone pebble (76.9 x 57.0 x
30.0 mm in length, width, and thickness). with
opposing percussion-flaked notches (14â16
mm wide) on the piece; the pebble is otherwise
unmodified (Figure 11-46). The notches were
slightly smoothed to probably keep the lashing
around each notch from fraying or being cut.
This tool may have been used as a net sinker
or weight, or it may represent the early stages
of manufacture of a chipped double-bitted axe
(see Turner 2006:Figure 8iâp).
The one pestle tool (Unit 19, 42 cm bs) is a
stream-rolled cobble of a coarse-grained
quartzite. It has battering on both ends of the
cobble as it was used in a pounding motion
to crush and pulverize plant remains or other
relatively hard materials in a mortar or other
stationery platform type (Figure 11-47); the
cobble is otherwise unmodified. The width of
the main battered end is 44.0 mm.

The first of the pigment stones is a small
hematite or red ochre pebble (Unit 125,
25â30 cm bs) that has one polished surface.
There are a series of narrow and shallow crosshatched grooves on the polished surface that
are evidence of the removal of ochre powder
for the manufacture of a red pigment (Figure
11-48, left). This piece is 26.0+ mm in length,
24.6+ mm in width, and 7.8 mm thick. The
other pigment stone (Unit 74, 30â35 cm bs)
is a flake fragment ( that has been removed
from the smoothed surface of the tool) (Figure
9-47, right); there are no scratched lines on
the small flake (13.0 x 7.5 x 7.4 mm in length,
width, and thickness, and 0.9 grams in weight).
The pitted stones, all made from ferruginous
sandstone, have either a single pecked pit on
one surface (Table 11-18 and Figure 11-49),
or two pits on one unmodified surface. The
pecked pit is commonly centrally placed on

one surface (60 percent), but the pits may
be found in different locations on the working
surface.
The pits range from 18â29.4 mm in diameter
and 2â4 mm in depth, indicating they were
used at varying intensities. The pits are
probably the remnants of the regular crushing
and cracking of nutshells or other small plant
foods with thick shells.
A single pitted stone of ferruginous sandstone
in the collection (Units 121/127, 47 cm bs)
also has an abraded groove on another tool
surface (Figure 11-50). There are three pits
or depressions on two different surfaces,
and a 60 x 2 mm (length and width) abraded
groove on another surface. The pits range from 30 x 3 mm in diameter and depth to 34 x

There is a single smoothed to polished stone with one
flattened surface from one of the Kitchen Branch site
features (Feature 209, 108 cm bs). It may have been used
for hide processing during the Titus phase occupation,
being rubbed across the hide to remove extraneous
materials and smooth the surfaces of the hide themselves.
It has been noted that such a pattern of polishing on a flat
surface may be common on tools used on soft materials,
such as hide or a fibrous material (see Adams 1988,
1996), perhaps to even up a hide, soften lumpy places in
the hide, or to rework and soften prepared buckskin. The
tool is a coarse-grained quartzite cobble with one flat to
slightly concave smoothed to polished surface. The tool
is 49.9 x 53.2 x 47.0 mm in length, width, and thickness.

Cores/Tested Cobbles and Lithic Debris
The 36 cores from the Kitchen Branch site include single platform (n=11), multiple
platform (n=20), and bipolar (n=1) types, as well as indeterminate core fragments (n=4)
(Table 11-19). Cores as a group have been recovered from 0â70 cm bs in the archeological
deposits as well as in one feature; the highest densities of cores occur between 30â50
cm bs (see Table 11-3).

More than 80 percent of the cores are on pebble-sized pieces of raw material (Figure
11-51aâe), while the remainder are cobble-sized pieces of local raw material (Figure
9-50fâg). More than 97 percent of the cores have a stream-rolled cortex, indicating that
the raw materials selected for reduction were gathered from local stream gravels. One
ferruginous sandstone core has a roughened cortex, suggesting a cobble was gathered
from a nearby bedrock source. The one bipolar core is from the upper Caddo archeological
deposits, and it is on a pebble-sized piece of brown chert. Single and multiple platform
cores of both pebble and cobble size are also present in the upper Caddo archeological
deposits (see Table 11-19).
The single platform cores have a range of 2â6 flake scars, with a mean of 3.9 flake scars
per core. The multiple platform cores have a range of 4â10 flake scars, and a mean of 5.9
flake scars per core.

Almost 88 percent of the tested cobbles/pebbles are on local raw materials, including
quartzite (n=10, usually heat-treated) and local red (n=1) and brown chert (n=3). The

pebbles have between 1â6 flake scars on them (mean number of flake scars is 2.8 per
pebble/cobble), evidence of their being knapped in a limited way to obtain flakes for tools,
or to evaluate the knapping characteristics of each particular pebble/cobble.

Lithic Debris
A sample of 400 pieces of lithic debris (approximately 9 percent of the total sample of
4,399 pieces of lithic debris in the assemblage) from key units and contexts in the block
archeological deposits at the Kitchen Branch site (Figure 11-53) were examined in detail.
The purpose of this detailed analysis, as agreed to by TxDOT, was to determine if there were

differences in lithic debris attributes that could be correlated to technological changes in
the manufacture of chipped stone tools through time at the site. The sample of lithic debris
includes 126 pieces from 20â30 cm bs in 13 different 1 x 1 m units (see Figure 11-52);
164 lithic debris from 30â40 cm bs in 19 1 x 1 m units; 72 lithic debris from 50â60 cm bs
in 5 1 x 1 m units; and 38 pieces of lithic debris from 60â90 cm bs in 4 1 x 1 m units.
Several attributes were examined on each of these 400 pieces of lithic debris. This included
raw material (including local raw materials as well as non-local cherts and novaculite;
whether a piece of lithic debris had a platform or not, and what type of platform (following

weight (in grams).
A wide variety of lithic
raw
materials
are
represented in the lithic

Kitchen Branch site,
including nine different
local raw materials and
15 different non-local

(Table 11-21), including
several different cherts

local raw materials are
available
in
stream
gravels and in upland
settings, as shown in
our examination of lithic
raw material areas in the
Prairie Creek valley (see
Table 11-1). The nonlocal lithic raw materials

the Ouachita Mountains
in southeastern Oklahoma (e.g., Banks 1990; Dowd 2011), or the same distance to the
northeast in the Bowie gravels (e.g., Cliff et al. 1996a).
Local raw materials dominate the lithic debris from each part of the archeological deposits,
comprising between 78.1â86.5 percent of the lithic debris sample (Table 11-22). In
particular, non-chert lithic raw materials are pervasive, especially quartzite (both finegrained and coarse-grained), but with the regular occurrence of ferruginous sandstone and
petrified wood (see Table 11-21); ferruginous sandstone, in particular, is most abundant in
the deepest part of the archeological deposits (60â90 cm bs).

Local cherts account for 5.3â11.0 percent of the lithic debris sample, with peaks in the
30â40 and 50â60 cm bs levels (see Table 11-22). Brown chert is the most common local
chert in all the levels.
Non-local lithic raw materials are present in each of the unit/level contexts, ranging from,
7.2â10.4 percent of the lithic debris sample (see Table 11-22); there are no significance
differences in the acquisition and access to non-local lithic raw materials detected in the
lithic debris sample. Non-local cherts (particularly gray and dark gray cherts) are slightly
more common in the 50â90 cm bs levels, while novaculite (particularly white, yellow, and
gray colors) is slightly more common in the 20â40 cm bs levels (see Table 11-22). Jasper

is uncommon in all contexts, and quartz lithic debris is very rare in the sample, being
represented by a single flake in the 20â30 cm bs sample.
Size grade data indicates some differences in the lithic debris sample, particularly between
the 20â30 cm, 30â40 cm, and 50â60 cm samples and the sample from 60â90 cm bs
(Table 11-23). In the 20â60 cm levels, the preponderance of the lithic debris are S2
and S3 pieces, as they account for 88.1â90.3 percent of the samples from these levels;
furthermore, the majority of the lithic debris in these levels is S2. In the 60â90 cm bs
sample, S3 pieces are most abundant, almost 50 percent more abundant than is the case
for the 20â60 cm bs samples (see Table 11-23). S4 lithic debris are even more abundant
in the 60â90 cm bs than in other contexts, between 3â16 times more abundant than in
the 20â60 cm bs samples. S5 lithic debris are rare in all contexts.

In general, the 20â30 cm bs, 30â40 cm bs, and 50â60 cm bs have virtually identical
size array of lithic debris pieces, dominated by S2 and S3 pieces. Larger pieces of lithic
debris characterize the 60â90 cm bs sample, especially in the proportions of S3 and S4
pieces (see Table 11-23). This difference between samples suggests that larger pieces of
lithic raw material (proportionally more cobble-sized pieces?) were available for reduction
to the earliest prehistoric occupants of the Kitchen Branch site, while uniformly smaller
(and pebble-sized pieces?) pieces of raw material were available for reduction during later
occupations at the site.

Almost 50 percent of the lithic debris sample by context and depth have evidence of heat
treatment, with the highest percentage in the 20â30 cm bs level and the lowest percentage
in the 30â40 cm bs level (Table 11-24). The percentage of lithic debris pieces with cortex
ranges from 33.3â55.3 percent by context. The overall high percentage of cortical pieces
in the sample is consistent with the reduction of generally small pieces of cortex-covered
raw material, particularly pebbles of raw material present in local source areas. Lithic
debris of local raw materials have cortical percentages that range from 35â59 percent by
vertical contexts, with the highest proportion of local cortical flakes in the 60â90 cm bs
levels. Cortical flakes from the non-local lithic raw materials comprise only 20â23 percent
of the non-local lithic debris, with generally comparable percentages regardless of depth
(see Table 11-24).

The mean weight of the lithic debris samples ranges from 0.86â1.63 g (see Table 11-24).
The heaviest flakes by mean weight are also in the same levels (20â30 cm bs and 60â90
cm bs) with the highest percentage of cortical flakes, suggesting a slightly higher emphasis
on initial pebble/cobble reduction in those levels when compared to the 30â40 cm and
50â60 cm bs levels.
A number of different flake platform types are represented in the lithic debris sample
from the Kitchen Branch site. Approximately 46 percent of the lithic debris sample have
platforms (n=185), and this ranges from 39 percent in the 20â30 cm bs level; 48 percent
in the 30â40 cm bs level; 51 percent in the 50â60 cm bs level; and 53 percent of the
60â90 cm bs level contexts.
The most diverse range of platform types occurs in the 20â30 cm bs sample, with single
examples of flat/cortical and abraded types present, along with flat, multi-faceted, faceted,
and cortical (Table 11-25). Flat platforms are generally more common in the 20â30 and
30â40 cm bs samples than in the deeper levels, while faceted and multi-faceted platforms
on flakes are more abundant in the 20â30 cm bs (48.9 percent) and 50â60 cm bs (51.3
percent) samples. Conversely, cortex platforms are proportionally more frequent in the
30â40 cm and 60â90 cm bs samples (see Table 9-25).
According to TxDOT (n.d.:36), cortical and flat platform types are produced during early
stages of decortification and raw material package reduction. These types of platforms

represent 48.9â70.9 percent of the flakes with platforms in the Kitchen Branch lithic
debris sample, with the highest percentages in the 30â40 and 60â90 cm bs samples.
These kinds of platforms would be expected in lithic reduction strategies that had to rely
on the reduction of small cortex-covered raw material sources, primarily pebbles from
stream gravels. This kind of reduction strategy was pervasive throughout the several
prehistoric occupations that took place at the Kitchen Branch site. Faceted platforms âare
generally produced in early stage blank productionâ (TxDOT n.d.:36), and these occur on
between 12.7â29.7 percent of the flakes with platforms (see Table 11-25). The highest
percentages of this platform type are in the 20â30 and 50â60 cm bs samples. Finally,
multifaceted platforms âare generally associated with later stages of biface reduction but
can also be present in early stage biface reductionâ (TxDOT n.d.:36). Between 16.5â26.5
percent of the flakes with platforms have multi-faceted platforms (see Table 11-25), with
the highest proportion in the 20â30 cm bs sample.

Fire-Cracked Rocks
A total of 422 fire-cracked rocks weighing
44.6 kg were recovered from the
archeological deposits, including 44 pieces
from 12 different features. These rocks are
the remains of hot rock cooking activities
that took place at the site, primarily in the
deeper (below 40 cm bs) deposits.
In the block excavations, there are 378
pieces distributed from 0â100 cm bs
(Table 11-26). By count and weight, the
largest numbers of fire-cracked rocks occur
in the 30â60 cm bs levels, especially in the
40â50 cm bs level. Where raw material was
specified, approximately 80 percent of the

Summary and Conclusions
A diverse array of lithic artifacts have been recovered in the test excavations and data
recovery investigations at the Kitchen Branch site. These include arrow points, flake tools
and scrapers, dart points, several stages of bifaces, chipped stone gouges, cores and
tested cobbles/pebbles, ground stone tools, lithic debris, and fire-cracked rocks. Although
the assemblage is substantial (5,100+ artifacts), most of the lithic artifacts are pieces
of lithic debris from chipped stone tool manufacture and maintenance activities, and the
overall density of lithic artifacts is low across the block excavations (4.0â7.75 artifacts per
m2) and by depth in the archeological deposits (27.5â59.66 artifacts per m3).
The recovered projectile points from the site indicate that the slightly elevated landform
adjacent to Prairie Creek was used from as early as the Late Paleoindian period (i.e. several
Dalton points) to as late as the Late Caddo period Titus phase (i.e. Perdiz and Maud arrow
points). The vast majority of the dart points are types known to date from the Late Archaic
(ca. 5000â2500 years BP) and Woodland (ca. 2500â1150 years BP) periods, while
pre-AD 1300 stemmed arrow points are the most common of the arrow point forms in the
archeological deposits. Dart points and arrow points occur together from 0â70 cm bs in
the archeological deposits, and only in the 0â20 cm bs level do the recovered arrow points
actually outnumber dart points. The distributions and frequency of the projectile points
indicate that there is no stratigraphic integrity to the archeological deposits, as there are
no spatial or vertical clusters or concentrations of contemporaneously-aged projectile
points.
Because of the spatial and vertical mixture of dart point and arrow point types of widely
divergent ages in the archeological deposits at the Kitchen Branch, it is not possible to
do more than speculate about the co-associations of specific chipped stone and ground
stone tool categories with projectile points of known age. It does appear to be the case
that bifaces, gouges, and flake tools, dart points, cores and tested cobbles/pebbles,
ground stone tools, and fire-cracked rocks are more common in the deeper archeological
deposits (below 40 cm bs), while arrow points and lithic debris are more frequent in the
shallower depths. Although geoarcheological evaluation of the archeological deposits
were not a focus of the investigations at the Kitchen Branch site, it is suspected that these
apparent vertical differences in the distribution of lithic artifacts is primarily the product
of their movement down the sandy soil profile through biomantle (i.e. bioturbation and
pedoturbations) processes (cf. Ahr et al. 2012, 2013). In this situation, older artifacts
discarded on the surface of a stable sandy landform such as the elevated sandy landform
at the Kitchen Branch site have had a longer time in which to move down the soil profile
than have the progressively younger lithic artifacts. These younger artifacts (i.e. arrow
points primarily) thus tend to occur in the upper part of the soil profile. Another process that
has likely affected the vertical distribution of the lithic artifacts is the excavation of posts
454 AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

and pits by the aboriginal occupants of the site, as such digging (especially in the larger
and deeper pits) tends to encounter and bring up artifacts from deeper buried contexts
and redeposit them in and around features that originated higher in the soil profile or even
from near the present ground surface.

Research Issues
Several research issues concerning the chipped and ground stone artifacts recovered from
the Kitchen Branch site were identified in the project final research design (Chapter 3, this
volume). These research issues are addressed in this concluding section of this chapter.
What kinds of tools were made and used during the Late Caddo occupation?
The only lithic tools that can be confidently identified as being made and used during the
Late Caddo occupation at the Kitchen Branch site are Maud and Perdiz arrow points (n=9).
These points occur from 0â70 cm bs in the archeological deposits, with 67 percent recovered
from 0â40 cm bs. Because of the nature of the relatively deep sandy archeological deposits
at the site, and the mixture of artifacts of different ages both spatially and vertically, it is
not possible to identify other tool forms that can be securely associated with the Late
Caddo occupation. Small petaloid celts are a common Late Caddo tool form in East Texas
sites, but such tools are absent in the lithic tool assemblage. Other kinds of tool forms
occur throughout the archeological deposits, and none of them possess specific attributes
or characteristics that can link them with the Maud and Perdiz arrow points, although it is
considered likely that some of the flake tools, scrapers, and the one perforator were used
during the Late Caddo occupation, based on the kinds of flake tools recovered from other
contemporaneous Late Caddo sites (e.g., Fields and Gadus 2012; Perttula et al. 1998;
Perttula and Sherman 2009; Turner 1978).
What do the recovered lithic debris samples from Late Caddo contexts tell us about the
manufacturing and tool refurbishing and maintenance activities that occurred there?
Again, because of the nature of the archeological deposits in relatively deep sandy contexts,
no specific non-feature Late Caddo contexts with a discrete lithic debris assemblage can
be identified with certainty at the Kitchen Branch site. Even the lithic debris from the
shallowest deposits (i.e. 20â30 cm bs level)âin what might otherwise be thought to be by
the preponderance of the evidence (i.e. frequency of ceramic sherds and the origination
of most of the features) to be of Late Caddo ageâare associated with 14 dart points and
several different kinds of arrow points.
Did Caddo lithic assemblages in the Kitchen Branch site households rely on the reduction
of small pebbles of local cherts, petrified wood, and quartzite to obtain flakes of sufficient
size and shape to manufacture tools?

AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. 455

Chapter 11

It does appear to be the case that local lithic raw materials of quartzite, local earth-toned
chert, and petrified wood are present in the Prairie Creek valley, and the majority of these
materials are pebble-sized. These local raw materials were used to manufacture more
than 77 percent of the Caddo arrow points recovered at the Kitchen Branch site. Only the
Perdiz and Bonham-Perdiz arrow points were predominantly manufactured from non-local
lithic raw materials, and it is likely that these points were made elsewhere and traded/
exchanged with the Caddo occupants at the site. Flake tools, especially the scraping tools,
were also made predominantly from non-local lithic raw materials, and these also are most
likely to have been made elsewhere and the completed tool form traded/exchanged, or
non-local lithic raw materials of pebble and cobble size were traded/exchanged with the
Caddo residents of the Prairie Creek valley. It is also possible that dart points of non-local
lithic raw materials found in local contexts were broken and recycled for use by Caddo tool
knappers.
Are there non-local lithic raw materials (tools and debris) present in the archeological
deposits at the Kitchen Branch site, and what does their procurement and use imply about
social and trade relationships with other contemporaneous Titus phase Caddo groups?
Did these Titus phase Caddo groups have regular access to non-local lithic raw materials
for tool manufacture, or was such access seen only at specific households?
Non-local lithic raw materials are present among the chipped stone tools and lithic debris
found in all levels of the archeological deposits at the Kitchen Branch site. For example,
23 percent of the arrow points and 25 percent of the dart points are made from non-local
lithic raw materials, along with 12 percent of the bifaces, 55 percent of the flake tools, 12
percent of the cores and tested cobbles/pebbles, and nine percent of the lithic debris.
The non-local lithic raw materials appearâin the absence of chemical analysis to pinpoint
source areasâto be almost exclusively from raw material sources ca. 80 km or more to
the north (in Red River gravels) or northeast (Bowie gravels), and these raw materials
ultimately derived from Ouachita Mountains formations in southeastern Oklahoma. In the
case of diagnostic Late Caddo lithic artifacts, these materials were thus likely obtained
through trade/exchange relationships between contemporaneous McCurtain phase (who
lived in the area of abundant Red River gravel sources), Texarkana phase (Caddo groups
who lived in the area of the Bowie gravels), and Titus phase Caddo groups.
The Titus phase Caddo use of non-local lithic raw materials at the Kitchen Branch site can
best be gauged by examining the frequency of non-local arrow points (Maud and Perdiz).
Approximately 56 percent of these points, all Perdiz points, are made from non-local lithic
raw materials, which suggests a regular access to non-local lithic raw materials controlled by
McCurtain phase and/or Texarkana phase Caddo groups or to completed tools made from
non-local lithic raw material sources. The Maud arrow points are made from local quartzite
raw materials. More than 7 percent of the lithic debris from the uppermost archeological
deposits (20â30 cm bs) are from non-local raw material sources, including various high
quality cherts, novaculite, and Red River jaspers, which also speaks to the likelihood
that Titus phase Caddo groups, as well as earlier Caddo groups that used the Kitchen

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

Branch site, had regular access to non-local lithic raw materials for tool manufacture and
refurbishing activities.
Can Woodland and Archaic lithic assemblages be characterized by their tool composition,
technological parameters, and the use and relative proportion of non-local lithics as one
proxy for determining the mobility range of these pre-AD 800 peoples?
Woodland and Archaic lithic assemblages can be characterized by their tool composition
at the Kitchen Branch site in only the most general way because of the great difficulty
in identifying and defining spatially and vertically discrete tool and lithic debris clusters
in the relatively deep sandy deposits in the block excavations. It is fair to say based on
past archeological research in East Texas, that both the Woodland and Archaic lithic
assemblages at the site in their broadest sense are characterized by one or more kinds of
dart points of differing ages, bifaces in various stages of reduction and manufacture, flake
tools, chipped gouges of ferruginous sandstone cores and tested cobbles/pebbles, and an
assortment of ground stone tools (grinding slabs, manos, manos/pitted stones, and pitted
stones). The technology was based on both the challenging reduction of mainly pebblesized pieces of quartziteâwhich was heat-treated to facilitate knappingâand other local
raw materials (petrified wood and earth-toned cherts), and the intensive use of whatever
larger pieces of non-local lithic raw materials (or completed tools) that could be obtained
by direct procurement or through exchange/interaction networks in existence.
The fact that almost 25 percent of the dart points recovered at the Kitchen Branch were
made from non-local lithic raw materials (from Red River and Bowie gravels) indicates that
Woodland and Archaic groups that used the site had a ready access to non-local lithic
raw materials and/or completed tools of non-local lithic raw materials. As only 12 percent
of the discarded bifaces, 6 percent of the cores, and 12 percent of the tested cobbles/
pebbles are on non-local lithic raw materials, compared to 25 percent of the dart points,
this would suggest that this disproportion is the product of the fact that the majority of
the non-local lithic raw came to the site in the form of completed or near-completed tools
or bifaces. However, roughly 20 percent of the pieces of non-local lithic debris from the
site has cortical remnants, indicating that masses of this material (including early stage
bifaces with cortical remnants) were reduced on site. By contrast, 43 percent of the lithic
debris on local raw materials have cortical remnants.
The decreasing percentages through time of non-local lithic raw materials in the dart point
assemblagesâfrom 100 percent of the Late Paleoindian/Early Archaic points, 25 percent
of the Middle Archaic darts, 16 percent of the Late Archaic dart points, and 21 percent of
the Woodland dart pointsâsuggests that as the intensity of use of the East Texas landscape
increased over time along with population sizes, the mobility ranges of hunter-gatherer
groups decreased accordingly. These broad trends in the use of the East Texas Pineywoods
and Post Oak Savannah by hunter-gatherer groups over a 7,500 year period, as tracked
by projectile point frequencies and differing raw material usage, likely reflect cultural and
demographic changes as well as technological adjustments and adaptations associated
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. 457

Chapter 11

with major climatic changes in the region, particularly in temperature and available
precipitation, just as they do in other parts of North America (e.g. Collins et al. 2011;
Munoz et al. 2010). By the onset of the Late Archaic, changes in the distribution of prairie
and forest areas, due to generally wetter conditions after ca. 5000 years BP than was the
case during the preceding Middle Archaic period, were much as they are in modern times.
The known distribution, availability, and predictability of food resources in the region at
this time apparently led to a substantial increase in American Indian population sizes in
smaller territorial ranges that continued through the Woodland period and into the post-AD
800 Caddo periods.
Did pre-Caddo lithic assemblages rely on the reduction of small pebbles of local cherts,
petrified wood, and quartzite to obtain flakes of sufficient size and shape to manufacture
tools or was the technological strategy oriented to the production of bifaces?
Local lithic raw materials of quartzite, local earth-toned chert, and petrified wood are in
the Prairie Creek valley are predominantly pebble-sized (see Table 11-1 and 11-2). These
local raw materials were used to manufacture more than 75 percent of the dart points
recovered at the Kitchen Branch site. Both bifaces, gouges, cores, tested cobbles/pebbles
are considered to be part of pre-Caddo lithic assemblages, and these chipped pieces
are overwhelmingly on local raw materials (88 percent of the bifaces, 92 percent of the
gouges, 94 percent of the cores, and 88 percent of the tested cobbles/pebbles). Thus,
the technological strategy of pre-Caddo knappers was focused on efforts to expediently
reduce pebbles and small cobbles primarily to manufacture bifaces for tools.
Is the presence of non-local lithic raw materials (tools and debris) in the pre-Caddo
archeological deposits and artifacts at the Kitchen Branch site informative about the scale
of movement of these pre-Caddo groups across the landscape, as well as any existing
social and trade relationships with other contemporaneous hunting-gathering groups that
moved more frequently through lithic raw material source areas? Did the hunter-gatherers
that encamped at the Kitchen Branch site have regular access to non-local lithic raw
materials for tool manufacture, or was such access episodic and spatially biased?
Non-local lithic raw materials of pre-Caddo age, as based on the presumed ages of a series
of Woodland and Archaic dart points found at the Kitchen Branch site, appear to come
from gravel sources along the Red River and in the Red River-Sulphur River interfluves (i.e.
Bowie gravels) ca. 80+ km north and northeast of the site. If these lithic raw materials were
directly procured by occupants of the Kitchen Branch site, it does provide a measurable
scale of some of the movement of these hunter-gatherer groups in their obtaining of these
high-quality lithic raw materials. That 25 percent of the pre-Caddo dart points at the site
are made from non-local cherts and novaculite is indicative of a ready access to these raw
materials, either by direct procurement or trade/exchange. At the same time, decrease
in the proportion of non-local lithic raw material use in dart points of Late Paleoindian/
Early Archaic (100 percent), Middle Archaic (25 percent), Late Archaic (16 percent), and
Woodland (21 percent) period age suggests a commensurate decrease through time in

the scale of movement and size of territorial range for these East Texas after ca. 8000
years BP, at least with respect to the procurement and use of non-local lithic raw materials,
most noticeably in the period between ca. 5000â2500 years BP.

Floral and Faunal Remains from the Kitchen
Branch Site and the Results of Organic
Residue Analysis of Ceramic Sherds
Leslie L. Bush, LeeAnna Schniebs, and Timothy Perttula
This chapter provides analyses of the recovered floral and faunal remains from the Kitchen
Branch site (41CP220) archeological deposits. Also discussed in this chapter are the
results of the analysis of organic residues preserved on a sample of Caddo ceramic sherds
from the site.

Plant Remains from the Kitchen Branch Site (41CP 220), Camp County, Texas
Leslie L. Bush
Flotation and fine-screen samples from the Kitchen Branch site were submitted for
identification and analysis of macrobotanical remains. Samples were selected so that
each feature was represented in the analysis with a preference for flotation samples when
both flotation and fine screen were taken from the same feature. Additional samples were
analyzed from the large pits (Features 12, 209, and 219), smudge pit Feature 10, and the
support post Feature 2. The analyzed samples represent 35 features and 266.3 liters of
soil matrix. Ninety-three liters of analyzed matrix were flotation-processed; the remaining
173.3 were fine-screened through 1/16â mesh.

Methods
Flotation samples from the Kitchen Branch site were processed at Archeological &
Environmental Consultants, LLC offices in Pittsburg, Texas, in a manual, bucket-to-bucket
flotation system. Light fractions were caught in chiffon fabric, and heavy fractions were
passed through a 1/16-inch (1.6 mm) mesh. Carbonized botanical material was picked
from the heavy fractions and sent to Macrobotanical Analysis along with the light fractions.
They were combined for analysis and reporting here.
In the laboratory, all samples were subject to full radiocarbon protocols to retain suitability
for radiocarbon dating. Samples were sorted on freshly cleaned glassware and handled
only with latex gloves and metal forceps. Screens used to size-sort material were cleaned
between samples. Contact with paper and other plant products was avoided. Only one
sample was open at a time in the laboratory. Writing instruments used for data recording
of samples were plastic mechanical pencils.
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. 461

Chapter 12

Flotation samples were sorted according to standard procedures at the Macrobotanical
Analysis laboratory in Manchaca, Texas (e.g., Pearsall 2000). Each sample was weighed
on an Ohaus Scout II 200 x 0.01 g electronic balance before being size-sorted through a
stack of graduated geologic mesh. Material that did not pass through the No. 10 mesh (2
mm square openings) was completely sorted, and all carbonized botanical remains were
counted, weighed, recorded, and labeled. When more than approximately 150 items of the
same type were present, counts were estimated from the weight of 50 randomly-selected
specimens. Uncarbonized botanical material larger than 2 mm (roots and rootlets) was
weighed, recorded, and labeled as âcontamination.â Material that fell through the 2 mm
mesh (âresidueâ) was examined under a stereoscopic microscope at 7-45 X magnification
for carbonized botanical remains. Any identifiable plant material that had not been
previously identified in the material larger than 2 mm was removed from residue, counted,
weighed, recorded, and labeled. Uncarbonized macro-botanical remains were recorded on
a presence/absence basis on laboratory forms.
Fine screen samples were treated as flotation samples except that they were not sizesorted unless a great deal of material smaller than 2 mm was present. In addition, the
few uncarbonized botanical remains in the fine screen samples were sorted, counted,
weighed, and labeled in the same manner as carbonized and semi-carbonized remains.
Botanical materials were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level by comparison
to materials in the Macrobotanical Analysis comparative collection and through the use
of standard reference works (Core et al. 1979; Davis 1993; Hoadley 1990; Martin and
Barkley 2000; Musil 1963; Panshin and de Zeeuw 1980). Botanical nomenclature follows
that of the PLANTS Database (USDA, NRCS 2012).

Results
Tables 12-1 and 12-2 show carbonized botanical material from flotation samples by
count and weight respectively. Uncarbonized seeds from flotation samples are given on a
presence/absence basis in Table 12-3. Tables 12-4 and 12-5 show all botanical material
identified from the fine screen samples by count and by weight.

Archeological versus modern plants
Uncarbonized seeds were present in all flotation samples and in five fine screen samples
(see Tables 12-3â12-5). The ubiquity of carpetweed in the flotation samples (present
in 11 of 14) is notable since it indicates that flotation techniques were sufficient to
routinely recover this small seed (0.7 mm diameter). Uncarbonized seeds are a common
occurrence on most archeological sites, but they usually represent seeds of modern plants
that have made their way into the soil either through their own dispersal mechanisms
or by faunalturbation, floralturbation, or argilliturbation (Bryant 1985:51-52; Miksicek
1987:231-232). In all except the driest areas of North America, uncarbonized plant material

on open-air sites can be assumed to be of modern origin unless compelling evidence
suggests otherwise (Lopinot and Brussell 1982; Miksicek 1987:231). Uncarbonized seeds
at Kitchen Branch consist of weedy annuals and trees common in the area. Further, the
deepest samples, those with uppermost sample depths of 90 or 100 cm bs, have the
fewest seed taxa per liter (excluding the very small sample that contained no uncarbonized
seeds). Uncarbonized seeds from Kitchen Branch are therefore interpreted as modern
here.
Semi-carbonized plant remains are more difficult to interpret. Some especially tough semicarbonized plants such as the dogwood seed may have survived from the relatively recent
Late Caddo occupation. The presence of semi-carbonized pine wood in an ecosystem
where pine dominance is maintained by fire (Abrahamson 1990; Albert 2007; Frost
1993), however, argues the use of caution in interpretation of semi-carbonized plants. In
addition, the presence of grape seeds in semi-carbonized and uncarbonized forms (but
not carbonized form) suggests a modern origin for those plants as well.

Wood charcoal
A total of 1102 fragments of wood charcoal weighing 11.10 g was recovered from Kitchen
Branch. Identification was attempted for 400 specimens, of which 328 were identifiable to
genus or species (Figure 12-1). The wood taxa recovered indicate exploitation of upland
and streamside habitats near the site. Oak, hickory, and pine represent the uplands while
black walnut, hop hornbeam, dogwood, and holly would have been common along Kitchen
Branch and Prairie Creek.

Nutshell
Nutshell was common on the site, appearing in 13 of 14 flotation samples and 27 of 29
fine screen samples. In total, 935 fragments weighing 13.03 g were identified from the site.
Thick-shelled hickory was the most common nut resource, but black walnut, acorn, and
chinkapin were also identified. As noted above, hickory, walnut, and oaks were identified
in the wood charcoal assemblage, indicating the presence of those trees in the immediate
site vicinity.
Despite its thick, tough nutshells, walnut is generally less common on archeological sites
than hickory, in part because the trees are more patchily distributed on the landscape
(Simpson 1999), but also because walnuts are not as easily processed. Traditional hickory
processing methods used by Iroquois, Choctaws, Cherokees, and many other peoples
involve pounding hickory nuts into small pieces and then heating them in water, where the
oil can be skimmed off, the nutmeat retrieved from suspension, and the shells allowed to
sink to the bottom (Fritz et al. 2001; Moerman 1998). Experiments by archeologists show
that this process yields a much larger number of calories per labor invested than does
cracking and picking (Talalay et al. 1984:353). Other common nuts cannot be processed
in this manner because either their meats float (acorn, hazelnut) or the nuts become bitter
(walnut).

Agricultural products
Corn was the only definite agricultural product recovered at the Kitchen Branch site, with
six kernel fragments, seven cupule fragments, and one glume identified. Corn was present
in samples representing eight features and one unit level.
The two maygrass seeds recovered from the Kitchen Branch flotation samples may represent
plants that were cultivated or less formally encouraged by site inhabitants. Maygrass is of

Chapter 12

particular interest to archeologists because they are part of a complex of native starchy
seeds that were cultivated in parts of the Eastern Woodlands of North America prior to the
advent of corn agriculture (Fritz 2000). Maygrass grows wild in many parts of the Eastern
Woodlands, including modern Camp County (Turner et al. 2003). Maygrass is also present
in Ozark rock shelter caches (Gilmore 1931; Fritz 1984). Its status as a possible cultigen is
inferred from the quantities of seed present on such sites; no changes in seed attributes
associated with intensive cultivation have been identified.
The cultigen status of the maygrass at Kitchen Branch is uncertain. Although maygrass
appears sporadically on East Texas sites along with other potential cultigens, it is typically
neither abundant nor ubiquitous (Table 12-7). The seeds are easy to dismiss on any single
site as accidental inclusions, but taken together, the pattern is suggestive, especially given
the low abundance and ubiquity of small wild seeds on East Texas Caddo sites in general.
In addition to maygrass, 10 small seeds were recovered from the site in carbonized form.
Seven of these are pine seeds, all from Feature 122. The feature is likely a smudge pit
that also contained 0.61 g of pine cone parts. It is likely that the pine cone seeds were
burned along with the cones. A unidentified grass seed was recovered from Feature 19,
and Feature 209 produced an indeterminable seed and a cherry pit. The cherry pit is
broken, but it is almost certainly black cherry (Prunus serotina). Cherry fruits are edible
raw or cooked, and they are especially valuable because they can be dried and stored
for consumption out of their peak season of availability (early summer) or during travel
(Moerman 1998). Cherry bark also has numerous medicinal uses; the cherry flavoring
ubiquitous in modern cough medications and analgesics is a vestige of these former uses.

Geophytes
Four small bulb scale fragments were recovered from Features 18 and 167. Both features
are post holes and, like other posts at the site, they appear to be filled with general site
debris rather than structural material. Wild onion or garlic (Allium spp.) and false wild
garlic (Nothoscordum bivalve) are common in East Texas today, and camas (Camassia sp.)
was probably more common in the past (Diggs et al. 2006). All three plants prefer open
woods and prairies and would likely have thrived on the sunny stream banks and terraces
near Kitchen Branch.

Flotation versus fine screen recovery
Table 12-8 compares weights of plant remains from the three features from which both
flotation and fine screen samples were analyzed. Approximately equal amounts of fill are
represented by each method (52 liters of flotation and 57 liters of fine screen). Metrics
derived largely from carbonized plant material larger than 2 mm (plant weight per liter and
wood taxa per liter) show the two methods are comparable for recovery of larger material.
Flotation almost certainly yields more carbonized plant material per liter, but a significant
portion of this is small charcoal included in the âresidueâ that passed through a 2 mm
mesh in the laboratory.

In this study, only flotation samples produced small seeds: this is no surprise given the
1.6 mm openings of the fine screen mesh. Although corn parts were recovered by both
methods, only flotation samples produced cob fragments (cupules and glumes). The
reason for this is not immediately clear. It is possible that the longer, more linear shape of
corn cupules allows them to pass through fine screen mesh more easily than the rounder
kernel fragments.

Summary
Macrobotanical remains recovered in fine screen and flotation samples from the Kitchen
Branch site consist of wood charcoal, nutshell, corn, maygrass, bulb fragments, and a
few small seeds of plants. They reflect agricultural practices as well as exploitation of wild
plants in the immediate site area.

Analysis of Faunal Remains
County, Texas

from the

Kitchen Branch Site (41CP220)

in

Camp

LeeAnna Schniebs
Data recovery excavations at the Kitchen Branch site resulted in the recovery and analysis
of 311 faunal specimens. Additionally, approximately 75 small bone fragments were
recovered from flotation samples taken in features but were not included in the collection
subjected to analysis because the specimens were too small to be identifiable, therefore
elevating counts from feature contexts and leading to misleading faunal quantity.
Total weight of the collection is 148.4 grams, and 47 (15.1 percent) bone fragments are

general, the sample is fragmented and these small pieces are not very well preserved.

The high rate of fragmentation is likely due in part to laboratory or processing damage,
neglect, and/or unsuitable storage, as well as poor archeological preservation. Table 12-9
provides the number of specimens (NISP) in the data recovery faunal collection from the
Kitchen Branch site, as well as the minimum number of individuals (MNI) by taxon, their
preferred habitat, the percent of the sample represented by each taxon, and the number
of burned bone fragments.

Standard zooarcheological identification techniques were employed in this analysis, using
comparative skeletal collections. Attributes that were examined for each of the bone
fragments include taxon, element and portion of that element, symmetry, burning, and
weight. This analysis was concerned with identifying the general preferences of animal
exploitation by prehistoric Caddo peoples in the East Texas Pineywoods, specifically
those of the Late Caddo Titus phase (ca. AD 1430-1680) occupational component, which
included a possible structure location, several smaller exterior structures, smudge pits,
storage pits, and/or post holes.
The faunal remains were recovered from 56 units and 10 features at the Kitchen Branch
site. Quantities from each provenience range from one to 47 specimens but most units
had less than 10 fragments (Table 12-10).
Despite the high quantity of unidentifiable faunal remains and severe fragmentation, a
few inferences can be made about the Kitchen Branch site sample. The seven turtle shell
fragments are from small individuals and compare favorably in size to box turtle and/or
musk/mud turtle rather than the larger pond slider turtles. The box turtle prefers woodlands
and bottomlands, and the musk/mud turtle is found in aquatic habitats. Since the site is
located on a terrace overlooking Prairie Creek, utilization of an aquatic water source to
procure the turtle is suggested. The single tooth fragment from dog or coyote could be

evidence of domesticated dog since the Caddo were known to use dogs for hunting or
as subsistence in times of stress. If it is from a coyote. it is suggestive of scavenging. The
armadillo bone is not related to Late Caddo dietary debris, since it is a recent intrusion in
Northeast Texas and thus is a recent deposit. The deer is found in wooded edges, and the
recovery of 38 fragments demonstrates the Caddo hunting of the wooded edges in the
Pineywoods. There are a minimum of four individuals based on four right astragali (a very
dense ankle bone). The deer tooth is from a mature individual approximately three to five
years old at the time of death.
The faunal collection is dominated by unidentifiable large mammal bone fragments (n=159,
51.1 percent) and most if not all are probably the remains of deer. The unidentifiable
mammal (n=61) and indeterminate vertebrate (n=44) could be the remains of just about
any animal such as the beaver, opossum, raccoon, bobcat, cottontail, squirrel, pocket
gopher, turtles, or fish as these animals are common in Caddo faunal assemblages and
frequent the various habitats of East Texas (Newcomb 1993; Schmidly 1983). Hunting
was probably done as needed in all seasons throughout the year to supplement the
diet. The high rate of burning suggests subsistence preparation and subsequent debris
disposal.

Further investigations at the Kitchen Branch site in areas outside the TxDOT right-of-way
could provide additional information as to the subsistence preferences and animal hunting
activities of the Late Caddo period peoples that lived at the site. A larger sample of faunal
remains from temporally validated (through chemical dating of some kind) portions of the
site would also offer the opportunity to compare and contrast the subsistence practices of
the Caddo that lived here with faunal assemblages from other contemporaneous Caddo
sites in East Texas and other parts of the Caddo area.

A number of sherds have organic residues that can be matched with specific food stuffs
(Table 12-12). This includes beans (in raw form), maize (charred, baked, oven boiled, and
raw), gourd/pumpkin/squash (raw and dried), wild onion (cooked and raw), and crustacean
(baked, likely crawfish from Prairie Creek).
Organic residues from beans were especially common in the utility ware sherds (91
percent), as well as on the plain body and base sherds (57 percent); these latter sherds
probably are from the undecorated portions of utility ware jars. Maize in a variety of forms
were present as organic residues on the plain sherds (71 percent), utility ware sherds (55
percent), and fine ware sherds (50 percent). The one fine ware sherd with FTIR markers
for maize has organic residues that correlate with both raw and baked maize, suggesting
the fine ware sherd is from a serving vessel. Utility ware sherds also have FTIR markers for
gourd/pumpkin/squash and wild onion (see Table 12-12), while one plain body sherd has
organic residue.

The Horton Site (41CP20)
Timothy K. Perttula

Introduction
The B. J. Horton site (41CP20, see Figure 1-1) is on the crest of an upland ridge overlooking
the Big Cypress Creek floodplain to the north (Figure 13-1); Walkers Creek lies a short
distance to the south (Hunt et al. 1996: Figure 1). The site is primarily a Late Caddo Titus
phase cemetery with at least 19 excavated burials (Turner 1978: Figure 33).

Chapter 13

Previous Archeological Investigations at the B. J. Horton Site
Ralph Nicholas, Ed German, and Robert L. Turner, Jr. excavated 15 burials at the site in
September and October 1958 (Figure 13-2). The cemetery was discovered by Ed German
after soil was removed from a TxDOT borrow area in the 1950s for construction of the U.S.
271 bridge over Big Cypress Creek. The soil removal âscraped the top off some pots and
left them [the pots and burials] exposedâ (Robert L. Turner, Jr., January 21 and 23, 2012
e-mail communications). The remainder of the burials were located through use of a soil
probe by Ralph Nicholas. Several other burials were known to have been excavated by Alan
Young and Donny Cochran when they were high school students in Mount Pleasant, in the
late 1960s (Hunt et al. 1996:15). These particular burials (see Figure 13-2) were located
about 25â30 m east-northeast of the center of the 15 burials excavated by Nicholas et al.
(Robert L. Turner, Jr., January 21, 2012 e-mail communication). Robert L. Turner, Jr. is of
the opinion that these 20 burials represent all of the burials that were present originally
at the B. J. Horton cemetery, although the possibility remains that shallow burials may
have been scraped away
during soil removal, but he
considers this possibility to
be unlikely (Robert L. Turner,
Jr., January 23, 2012 e-mail
communication).
Available notes and records
from several of the burials
(Burials 1â5, 8â12, and
15) compiled by Turner have
been reproduced by Hunt et
al. (1996:Appendix F). The
burials were placed in an
extended supine position in
graves that were oriented
roughly east-west, with the
head of the deceased facing
towards the west (Figure
13-3). These burial plan
drawings indicate that the
following funerary offerings
were placed with the burials:
83 ceramic vessels, one
ceramic pipe, two Perdiz
points, one Maud point, 23
Bassett points, two Talco
point, nine unidentified
points, and two ground stone
celts.

Figure 13-3. Burial 2 from the B. J. Horton site.

A total of 30 Caddo vessels from the B. J. Horton site are in the Robert L. Turner collections,
several more than were mentioned in Hunt et al.âs (1996:Appendix F) summary of the
collection. The vessels are from Burial 1 (n=1), Burial 2 (n=8), Burial 4 (n=7), Burial 10
(n=10), and Burial 15 (n=4) (see Figure 13-2).
The vessels documented by Perttula et al. (2010a:275) from the Horton site include both
utility wares (n=7, 23.3%) and fine wares (n=20, 66.7%), as well as plain bowls (n=1),
compound bowls (n=1), and jars (n=1). Among the utility wares are Karnack BrushedIncised jars (n=1), cf. Pease Brushed-Incised jars (n=1), La Rue Neck Banded jars (n=1),
Mockingbird Punctated jars (n=1), brushed-punctated jars (n=1), incised jars (n=1), and
punctated jars (n=1). The fine wares include several decorated varieties of Ripley Engraved
carinated bowls and compound bowls (n=9), a Simms Engraved carinated bowl (n=1),
a Turner Engraved compound bowl (n=1), a Hood Engraved effigy bowl (n=1), a Wilder
Engraved bottle (n=1), a Ripley Engraved bottle (n=1), other engraved carinated bowls
and compound bowls (n=4, including one that may be a Turner Engraved vessel), and
unidentified engraved bottles (n=2).
The range and number of funerary offerings found with the burials excavated by Young and
Cochran is unknown, but Milton Bell (January 21, 2012 e-mail communication) remembers
that âmost of the material was crushed and scattered but they found at least one intact
vessel, a large red-slipped water bottle,â as well as a fragmentary carinated bowl, a small
bowl, and a large jar (see below).
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. 491

Chapter 13

Some years later, after the
borrow pit had been abandoned
by the TxDOT contractor, Milton
and Martha Bell found the
remains of one more burial at
the B. J. Horton site in the same
area (perhaps slightly west of)
as the Young/Cochran burials
(see Figure 13-1). The burial
was seen because a portion of
a carinated bowl rim was visible
at the surface. Associated with
the burial were parts of two or
Figure 13-4. Brushed-punctated jar from

carinated bowl and a small
brushed-punctated jar (Figure
13-4). According to Bell (January 21, 2012 e-mail communication),
âthe carinated bowl that Martha and I found was about 35-40 cm in diameter with
no bottom. The motif was what I call âFishâ since it resembles a small fish and was
repeated four times. The general pattern was very âRipley-like.â (The fish was an
elongated triangle with an eye and gill plate at the large end.)â

TxDOT Records of Three Vessels from the B. J. Horton site
The TXDOT files for the B. J. Horton site contained negatives of three vessels that had been
recovered at the site. Discussions with Milton Bell, who took the photographs, indicate that
these vessels are from the limited excavations done by Alan Young and Donny Cochran in
the late 1960s. The analysis of the vessels is based strictly on an examination of a black
and white print of each vessel.
The first vessel is an inverted rim bowl
with a single horizontal engraved line
just below the vessel lip, along with
a series of diagonal engraved lines
(pitched from the left to the right)
that encircle the vessel, and extend a
short distance below the rim (Figure
13-5). The vessel is ca. 2.5 cm in
height and 10.1 cm in orifice diameter.
Although this vessel is not identified
to a currently defined Caddo ceramic
type, the simple engraved design
bears some resemblance to Simms

Engraved, whose decoration is usually confined to a narrow rim zone and have repetitious
series of vertical and near vertical engraved lines. Simms Engraved vessels generally also
have inverted rims (see Suhm and Jelks 1962:141).
The second vessel is a large carinated bowl (ca. 13.9 cm in height and 21.2 cm in orifice
diameter) that has an engraved scroll and circle motif on the rim panel (Figure 13-6); the
motif is likely repeated four times around the vessel. It is classified as Ripley Engraved,
var. Galt (Perttula et al.
2010a). The motif has a
central circle, with a smaller
inner circle. The inner circle
has crossed arms. The upper
and lower scroll fill zones
or arms have elongated
triangular-shaped areas with
cross-hatched or hatched
lines, as well as separate
single small engraved circles
with crossed arms. The
addition of small engraved
circles within the scroll fill
zones is an unusual element
on Ripley Engraved, var. Galt
vessels from the Big Cypress
Creek basin.
The last vessel from the B.
J. Horton site is a large (ca.
26.8 cm in height) Bullard
Brushed jar that has vertical
brushing marks that extend
from the rim to within 3.5 cm
of the vessel base (Figure
13-7). The rim appears to
be slightly everted, with a
rounded lip. The base is flat,
and probably circular. There
is evidence of fire clouding
and organic residues on the
rim and upper body.

Summary
The B. J. Horton site (41CP20) is a Late Caddo (ca. AD 1430-1680), Titus phase cemetery
that was discovered by local avocational archeologists in the 1950s after soil was removed
from an upland knoll for use in the construction of the U.S. 271 bridge over Big Cypress
Creek. There is a record of 20-21 Caddo burials having been excavated from the cemetery,
which is of the size expected to be found in association with a local community of Titus
phase Caddo farmers. The range of decorated vessel types, and the number of Bassett
arrow points placed in the burials (Hunt et al. 1996; Perttula et al. 2010a), suggests that
the B. J. Horton site was primarily used in the 16th century, from ca. AD 1500â1550. The
photographs of the three vessels in TxDOT files from the site, believed to be part of the
ceramic vessels found by Young and Cochran during their investigations, are stylistically
and temporally consistent with the other vessels found and previously documented from
the B. J. Horton site.

The Keering Site (41CP21)
Timothy K. Perttula

Introduction
The Keering site (41CP21, see Figure 1-1) is a multi-component prehistoric site
(see Thurmond 1990a:152) that was investigated by archeologists from the Texas
Department of Highways and Public Transportation (now TxDOT) in the summer
of 19741. The site was located in the proposed right-of-way of U.S. 271, situated
on an upland ridge and south-trending upland slope (330â360 ft. amsl) on the
north side of Prairie Creek; this is an eastern-flowing tributary to Big Cypress Creek.
According to Milton Bell (January 21, 2012 e-mail communication), the site:
was found and reported by Tommy Johns. Tommy is an old friend who grew up in
Camp County. He called me one day to say that he had found a large number of
pottery sherds on a new highway location, improvements to U.S. 271. I reported this
to Frank Weir and we put a small crew together to go to Camp County and check it
out. The site had been cleared and grubbed [Figure 14-1] and it was totally missed
in our initial survey. I would estimate that the clearing was done at least a year
before we found it so there was some erosion and small bits of brush were taking
root again. We put in several test pits and found the clay to be usually a foot below
the surface. It was hard to estimate how much soil was removed by the clearing but
I think it took out most of the cultural material. We recovered flakes, sherds, and
a few pieces of worked local chert/gravel, usually small. Most of the site was very
disturbed and we found very little intact deposition.
The midden area had been totally bull-dozed. I canât say with any certainty that the
midden and hill-top site were one in the same site since there was no âphysicalâ
connection. They were separated by 40â50 m. Since the hillside was relatively
steep, gravity and erosion may have deposited materials artificially. The greatest
concentration of sherds was near the top of the hill. Just a thought. I canât remember
many flakes showing on the surface but that was close to 40 years ago. The black
earth and deposit was pushed off to the side of the right-of-way near the bottom
of the hill and near the creek. I donât remember finding any artifacts in the midden
remains but I spent most of my time near the hill top where Tommy collected the
sherds. We found several small artifacts of a type I had not seen before. It was a
small but thick, rounded biface with a very small flaked blade-like extension that
could have been used as a perforator. If so, it would have been the smallest Iâve ever

seen. It would have made a hole only about 2 mm max! As I say, I remember seeing
four or five recovered in the Â¼-inch screen. Some would have passed through.
From the amount of disturbance to the site, the people in Austin decided we should
end the tests. I think we were on-site for about a week. Not really sure about that, but
it was disappointing
to find what was likely
a good site missed by
our surveyor and then
bladed off by the C&G
activities.

1974 Investigations
Other than two surface
collections,
one
by
Tommy Johns when the
site was first found and a
later collection by Milton
Bell, the summer 1974
investigations at the
Keering site consisted
of the hand excavation
of eight 5 x 5-ft. units (a
Figure 14-1. The eastern slope of the Keering site (41CP21)
total of 200 ft.2) and the
showing clearing and grubbing of the U.S. 271 right-of-way.
machine excavations of
three gradall trenches
(Figures 14-2 and 14-3). The work was done by Milton Bell, Jack Keller, Joe Denton, and
Marshall Eiser.
The hand-excavated units were centered in the central part of the site, between N400-515
and E450-500. The units were excavated in arbitrary 0.5-ft. levels.
The archeological deposits were shallow, overlying a clay B-horizon, no more than 1.5 ft (ca.
46 cm) in thickness. They consisted of a sandy loam (color not specified) A-horizon of the
Cuthbert fine sandy loam soil, 8â25 percent slopes (Roberts 1990). The disturbed midden
area along the southern slope of the landform (N and E grid coordinates not provided) was
not investigated with hand-excavated units, but a profile cut indicated that a dark sandy
loam 1.0â1.5 ft. in thickness overlay a 0.5-ft zone of light tan sandy loam, which rested on
the clay subsoil. According to the field notes: â[s]ome cultural materials were recovered but
they were not numerousâ (Jack Keller field notes, July 31, 1974).
Though specific dimensional information was not recorded in the original field notes, site
photographs of trenching underway suggest the gradall utilized a four-foot-wide (1.2 m)

bucket, excavating to a depth of approximately 1.0â1.5 feet (0.3â0.45 m). The trenches
were cut between N325-520 E475-495, N445-520 E500, and at ca. N600 E500 (see
Figure 14-2). A possible midden area with dark soils was noted in one the gradall trenches,
covering a ca. 20 x 20-ft. area around N460 E500, but no further investigations of this
deposit were carried out by the crew.
Neither the hand-excavated units nor the gradall trenches encountered any evidence of
cultural featuresâother than the possible midden area around N460 E500âat the Keering
site. Given the limited nature of the investigations, however, and the character of the
artifacts found in the archeological deposits, it is likely that there were prehistoric Caddo
habitation features (i.e. post holes and pits) from a domestic farmstead compound.

Artifact Assemblage
The artifact assemblage from the Keering site consists of 849 ceramic sherds, three pieces
of burned clay, and 433 stone artifacts, primarily pieces of lithic debris from chipped
stone tool manufacture, as well as chipped and ground stone tools. The artifact totals
are the product of our recent analyses, not the earlier tabulations provided by Thurmond
(1990a:Table 28).

Ceramic Sherds
There are 849 sherds and 75 sherdlets in the Keering site ceramic assemblage (Table
14-1; see also Appendix 14-1); other than being counted, the sherdlets from the site have
received no further analysis. The sherds include 56 rims, 755 body sherds, and 38 base
sherds. Approximately 41 percent of the sherds (n=343) have decorations, and the plain
to decorated sherd ratio is 1.48. Decorated rims comprise 64 percent of the rims, but
the relative frequency of plain rims (36 percent) indicates that plain ware vessels were a
notable part of the ceramic assemblage from the site.
A total of 301 sherds (36 percent) are from surface collections (Lots 0â1), another 15
(1.9 percent) are from collections with no provenience (Lot 2â3), and 0.7 percent are from
gradall trenches (Lot 22). The remainder of the sherds are from the hand-excavated units,
and densities range from 22â138 sherds per unit (ca. 9.5â60 sherds perm2). The highest
densities are in N420 E475 (Lots 8â9, n=139) and N430 E455 (Lots 10â12, n=136) in
the central part of the investigated area (see Figure 14-2).
Plain and decorated jars, carinated bowls, bowls, compound bowls, and bottles are
represented in the sherds from the Keering site. Plain ware rims are primarily direct or
vertical in profile, with rounded and rounded, exterior folded lips (Table 14-2 and Figure
14-4a-b), although one rim has an everted profile and another has a flat lip.

Utility ware vessels are almost exclusively jars. They have direct as well as everted rim
profiles with either rounded or rounded, exterior folded lips. Fine ware vessels have direct
rimsâexcept for one everted rim compound bowlâand mainly rounded, exterior folded lips
(see Table 14-2).
Only about 23 percent of the rim sherds from the assemblage are large enough to permit
estimations of vessel orifice diameter. These estimations range from greater than 11 cm
in diameter to as large as 27 cm in orifice diameter (Table 14-3).

With the exception of the one large utility ware jar with a 27 cm orifice diameter, the other
vessels represented at the site are small to moderately-sized. They were probably intended
for individual and individual family use, rather than vessels that would have held multiple
servings of foods or liquids for communal food serving or feasting, or were intended for
storage purposes.

Information on these attributes,
as specified in the CTA Ceramics
Protocol for East Texas, serve to characterize both the technological character of the Caddo
assemblage present at the site, and permit comparisons with other Prairie Creek Caddo
sites in the Big Cypress Creek basin.
On average, the ceramic wares from the site are relatively thin-walled, with a sturdy, flat,
and thick base. The mean thickness for rim and body sherds from the wares of the site
varies only from 6.44â7.03 mm in width (Table 14-4), with a one standard deviation range
in the mean of 5.8â7.8 mm. The relatively thick bases, constructed to be flat and diskshaped for stability, have a mean thicknesses of 10.57 mm.
The fine ware rim and body sherds are consistently thinner than the plain wares or the utility
wares, but not by a significant amount (less than 30 percent of one standard deviation).
These variations in vessel wall thickness are likely related to functional and technological
differences in how these different wares were intended to be used by Caddo potters. The
more substantial vessel walls in the utility wares and plain wares would be well suited to
the cooking and heating of foods and liquids and would have contributed to their ability to
withstand heat-related stresses. Fine wares were probably intended for use in the serving
of foods and liquids.
Another factor that would influence vessel body wall thickness would be the sequence in
which a vessel was constructed (Krause 2007:35). Vessels constructed from the bottom
up, as these prehistoric Caddo plain and decorated vessels likely were, would tend to have
thinner walls moving up the vessel body towards the rim, with the lower portion of the
vesselâespecially on the baseâusually significantly thicker than the upper portions of the
vessel.
Vessel sherds in the archeological deposits at the Keering site are generally grog-tempered,
whether they are from plain wares, utility wares, or fine wares. A small percentage of
the grog-tempered sherds are also from vessels tempered with combinations of bone,

hematite, and charred organic
remains. Approximately 96 percent
of the sherds have grog as the
principal temper (Table 14-5), with a
range of 93.5â97.0 percent among
the three vessel wares.
Crushed and burned bone was added
to between 9.7â30.6 percent of the
sherds from the site, with similar
ranges (9.7â12.4 percent) in the
plain wares and fine vessel wares,
but the utility wares are much more
commonly tempered with bone.
Hematite was consistently used as
a temper in 6.5â8.4 percent of the
sherds, with the highest proportions
in the plain wares. A small percentage
of the plain ware and utility ware
sherds have charred organic remains
in the paste (0.5â2.4 percent),
indicating certain vessels were not
well-fired and the firing did not reach
temperatures sufficient to combust
organic materials that had been
incorporated in the paste.

*percentage

The Caddo ceramics at the site were
also commonly made with a naturally
occurring sandy clay, probably procured as alluvial clays along Prairie Creek. Between
30.6â45.2 percent of the sherds in the three wares have a sandy paste (see Table
14-5). The majority of the vessel sherds from the Keering site have a clayey to silty paste.
Clays used for vessel manufacture were probably gathered from nearby alluvial settings,
most likely within a short (1â7 km away, at most) distance from the settlement (Arnold
2000:343; Arthur 2006:52). This insured that potters hauling clay back to a site did not
expend an inordinate amount of time and energy on that task, limiting their production
effort. Arthur (2006:52) points out that potters are likely to select lower quality clays for
vessel manufacture than high quality clays if the latter are farther away.
Given the sherd sample size, there is substantial variability in the use of different temperpaste combinations at the Keering site, as there are 15 temper-paste combinations (see
Table 14-5). This number of temper-paste combinations suggests that the ceramics from
the site are a product of a well-developed but relatively heterogeneous ceramic vesselmaking tradition, probably reflecting the importance of individual choice in paste ârecipesâ

ceramic wares at the site were

apparently fired in a regular or wellcontrolled fashion inside a bed of
coals from an open wood fire. Most
of the sherds are from vessels that were also cooled in the open air (55.7â59.4 percent
of all the sherds), having been pulled away from the fire to cool, leaving a thin oxidized
zone visible in the core on either one or both vessel surfaces. Another 18.8â31.3 percent
of the sherds, especially the fine wares, are from vessels fired and cooled in a reducing
environment.
Sherds that are from vessels fired in an oxidizing environment or are from vessels that were
incompletely oxidized represent between 9.4â20.3 percent of the sherds. The highest
percentages of sherds fired in this way are in the plain wares (20.3 percent) and utility
wares (16.4 percent) (see Table 14-6); only 9.4 percent of the fine ware sherds are from
vessels fired in either oxidizing or incompletely oxidized ways.
A few sherds were from plain ware and utility ware vessels apparently not fired under wellcontrolled situations, as they have multiple reduced and oxidized zones in the vessel core
(firing condition X, see Table 14-6; evidence of multiple firings, see Perttula 2008:428).
Several other sherds have a distinctive core, with thin dark exterior zones and a lighter
core (firing condition I-L, see Table 14-6). Aten and Bollich (2002:54-55) suggest that this
manner of vessel firing may have been the result of the fact that vessels with this kind of
firing my have been placed in a fire with the âorifice [of the vessel] facing into the fire.â
Furthermore, the sherds with cores lighter than the surfaces may have come from vessels
where âafter extended firing that burned off all organics, the fire may have been smothered
to cause reduction and darkening of the exterior surface.â
Many of the vessel sherds from the Keering site retain evidence of the dry smoothing
or burnishing of interior and/or exterior surfaces (Table 14-7). These surface treatments
were done to thin and even out the vessel surfaces, strengthen them by melding coil
joins, and even to create a surface appearance that enhanced the vessel decoration. In all
likelihood, smoothing (especially smoothing on vessel interior surfaces) was consistently
done to lower the permeability and increase the heating effectiveness of particular vessels
(cf. Rice 1996:148).

are well represented
in the fine wares (see
Table 14-7). With the
fine wares, the well burnished interior surfaces may have been advantageous in the
repeated use of these wares as food serving vessels. The purpose of exterior smoothing
and burnishing (which are more common surface treatments in the fine wares) may have
been for stylistic and display purposes, creating a flat and lustrous surface well-suited to
highlight the engraved exterior surfaces of the fine ware vessels.
There are 343 decorated rim
and body sherds in the Keering
site ceramic assemblage (Table
14-8). Utility ware sherds
dominate both the rims (72
percent) and body (78 percent)
sherds from the site, especially
sherds with brushed, incised,
and tool punctated decorative
elements; these three groups
comprise 90 percent of the
utility ware rim sherds and 79
percent of the utility ware body
sherds. There are a total of 13
utility ware decorative methods
or combinations of methods
represented in the collection.
Fine ware sherds include
engraved, red-slipped, and
trailed decorative methods (see

including 28 percent of the rim
sherds.

The appliqued sherds, all body sherds, account for approximately 5 percent of the utility
wares from the site. Two with curvilinear appliqued fillets (Figure 14-5a) may be from
Harleton Appliqued jars, as these vessels tend to have more complicated appliqued designs
on vessel bodies (see Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 33). The other appliqued sherds have a
single straight appliqued ridge or fillet on the vessel body; the rim decoration associated
with these ridges and fillets is not known, but the appliqued elements were presumably
oriented vertically on the vessel body. The appliqued designs were likely intended to
quadrate vessel bodies into panels that were either undecorated (which seems most
likely) or were filled with incised or brushed decorative elements, as seen on some Pease
Brushed-Incised vessels (see Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 60).
The one appliqued-incised body sherd has a single straight appliqued fillet adjacent to
a set of parallel incised lines. This sherd may have come from a jar with four vertical
appliqued fillets on the body between panels with vertical incised.
Sherds with brushed decorations are abundant at the Keering site. More than 23 percent
of the utility ware rims and 47 percent of the body sherds have brushed decorations;
45 percent of all the utility ware sherds are brushed (see Table 14-9). Jars are brushed

horizontally or diagonally along the rim, and body sherds have both parallel and overlapping
brushing marks (see Figure 14-5b). The orientation of the parallel brushed sherds is
uncertain, but it is probable that the brushing on the utility ware jars was vertically oriented
on the body. Most of these sherds are probably from Bullard Brushed jars, but brushed
decorations occur on the rims and/or bodies of other utility ware types found in Late
Caddo, Titus phase contexts.
The brushed-appliqued sherds represent 1.1 percent of the utility wares. Two of the sherds
have panels on the vessel body defined by straight appliqued fillets or ridges, and the
panels were filled with either parallel (i.e. vertical) or diagonal brushing marks. A third
sherd has more closely spaced appliqued ridges with parallel brushing marks between the
ridges (see Figure 14-5c). This sherd is probably from the body of a Harleton Appliqued jar.
About 7 percent of the utility ware sherds have brushed-incised decorative elements (see
Table 12-9). The tools used to create the brushed-incised decorations must have been a
stick as well as a frayed stick or bundle of grass. Both were seemingly dragged along the
vessel body surface when it was wet, or the incised tool was dragged across the surface
after the brushing marks had been laid down, but parallel to the brushing. In one case,
after the vessel body surface had been brushed, incised lines were cut in an overlapping
manner across the brushing.
One sherd from a surface context (Lot 0) has a brushed-incised-pinched decoration. The
decoration consists of vertical brushed-incised marks adjacent to vertical pinched ridges.
The pinched ridges were likely placed to divide the vessel body into panels filled with the
brushed-incised marks.
There are three brushed-punctated sherds in the Keering site ceramic assemblage. The
one rim sherd, probably from a Bullard Brushed jar, has a row of tool punctations under the
vessel lip, and diagonal brushing marks cover the remainder of the rim.
Sherds with incised decorations account for about 17 percent of the utility ware sherds,
including 23 percent of the utility ware rims (see Table 12-9). The incised vessels are
decorated on the rim with horizontal incised lines (n=3) (see Figure 14-5d), cross-hatched
incised lines (n=1) (see Figure 14-5e), diagonal-curvilinear lines (n=1), and diagonal
opposed incised lines (n=1) (see Figure 14-5f). The latter three rims are from Maydelle
Incised jars; the body decoration on these jars is unknown. The horizontal incised rims
are from an unknown Late Caddo ceramic type. The incised body sherds have simple
geometric decorative elements, including sets of parallel and opposed incised lines (see
Table 12-9).
There are a few sherds (n=6) from the Keering site that have incised-punctated elements;
these represent 2.3 percent of the utility wares. The one rim sherd, from a Maydelle Incised
jar, has horizontal and diagonal incised lines adjacent to a triangular zone filled with tool

punctations. Body sherds have diagonal, straight, and parallel incised lines with either
tool punctated zones between the sets of incised lines (n=1), or rows of tool punctations
between or adjacent to straight, diagonal, or parallel incised lines (n=4, see Figure 14-5gh). It is likely that some of the rows of tool punctations mark the rim-body juncture, with the
incised decorative elements on some portion of the rim.
Sherds with pinched ridges (n=5, 1.9 percent of the utility wares) are from Killough Pinched
jars (see Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 46). The pinched ridges were most likely oriented
vertically on both the rim and the vessel body (see Figure 14-5k).
The punctated sherds from the site are almost exclusively decorated with tool punctates
(98 percent) (Figure 14-5j); one body sherd has fingernail punctates (see Figure 14-5i).
Almost 43 percent of the utility ware rim sherds have a punctated decoration, and overall,
punctated sherds represent 17 percent of the sample of utility ware sherds (see Table 14-9).
The rim sherds have rows of tool punctations on them, usually as three rows, one under
the vessel lip, a second midway down the rim, and a third row at the rim-body juncture.

Vessels decorated solely with tool punctations on the rim (and with an undecorated body)
are likely Mockingbird Punctated jars. But it is not uncommon in Titus phase contexts for
rim punctated jars to have a variety of non-punctated decorative elements on the body,
especially brushing marks, appliqued ridges and fillets, and incised lines. Vessels with
punctated decorations on vessel bodies include horizontal or vertical rows of punctations
covering the body surface, or punctations that are freely or randomly placed on the body
(see Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 79).
One body sherd from a surface collection has a faint stamped decoration. This consists of
two rows of dentate stamps. The sherd may be from the body of a post-AD 1500 Cowhide
Stamped jar (see Webb 1959:128â131), a Red River Belcher phase utility ware, although
it is not shell-tempered.
The fine wares include sherds from bottles, carinated bowls, and compound bowls. About
87 percent of the fine wares have engraved decorative elements and motifs, another 11.5
percent have red-slipped decorations, and there is one Keno Trailed bottle sherd (Table
14-10).
Among the engraved sherds from the Keering site, almost 96 percent are from carinated
bowls and compound bowls, with the remainder coming from bottles (see Table 14-10).
Bottles have engraved, red-slipped, and trailed designs, while the fine ware bowls are both
engraved and red-slipped. However, none of the engraved rims from the site have redslipped surfaces.
The majority of the engraved sherds from the Keering site have non-descript decorative
elements consisting of straight lines, curvilinear lines, and parallel lines (see Table 14-10);
one of these sherds had a black slip. Sherds with widely-spaced horizontal engraved lines
are from the upper rim panels of compound bowls, while the other horizontal engraved
sherds are probably from the rim panel of carinated bowls; the main motif on these vessels
is unknown. There are six sherds that have portions of Ripley Engraved scroll motifs,
as well as other elements on three sherds (i.e. cross-hatched zone, excised triangles,
excised pendant triangles) that occur on fill zones or arms that are part of scroll motifs
(see Table 12-10). One rim sherd with a scroll and circle motif (Figure 14-6a) is from a
Ripley Engraved, var. Galt carinated bowl. The central circle is a swastika in circle element,
a decorative element commonly associated in iconography with the Caddo underworld.
Another rim sherd has an interlocking horizontal scroll motif from a Ripley Engraved, var.
Pilgrims carinated bowl (Figure 14-6b). Red pigment had been smeared in the engraved
lines on this vessel rim.
Sherds from engraved bottles and ollas account for only 6 percent of the engraved
fine wares (see Table 14-10). The bottle and olla sherds have straight, horizontal, and
curvilinear lines, sometimes with a red pigment smeared in the lines (see below), and
one Ripley Engraved bottle sherd has a straight engraved line with an elongated pendant
triangle (see Figure 14-6c).

The red-slipped sherds are from both bowls (slipped on both surfaces) and bottles (slipped
only on the exterior surface) (see Table 14-10). The absence of red-slipped rims suggests
that plain red-slipped vessels other than bottles are likely rare at the site, and that the
red-slipping on vessel bodies may have accompanied engraved decorations on bowl rims.
The one trailed sherd from the site (N405/E465) has a single broad trailed line on the
exterior surface of a black (reduced fired) burnished and grog-tempered bottle (see Figure
14-6d). This sherd is from a Keno Trailed bottle (see Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 44).

Chapter 14

Keno Trailed vessels are rare in Titus phase contexts, accounting for less than 1 percent
of the vessels in a sample of more than 2000 vessels documented from 17 Titus phase
cemeteries (Perttula 2005:Table 11-10), and when they do occur, it is in what apparently
are post-AD 1600â1650 burials and/or occupations. This one Keno Trailed sherd at the
Keering site implies some use of the site by Caddo peoples in the 17th century AD.
Late Caddo period, Titus phase fine ware vessel assemblages commonly have red or white
pigments rubbed in the engraved lines, and this is the case at the Keering site, where 16.2
percent of the engraved sherds have pigments on them (Table 14-11). Red pigments were

more commonly used on bottles, but bowls and carinated bowls also have red pigment.
White pigments are confined to carinated bowls and compound bowls.
Hart and Perttula (2010:208) have argued that the differences in pigment use on
Caddo ceramic vessels symbolize the cosmological underpinnings of Caddo worldviews.
Specifically, these colors may
have significance in social,

order. The dominance of red
pigment use in Titus phase
contexts is consistent with
red pigments on vessels being the predominant practice. Evidence of the regular use of
white pigments after the late 15th century (Perttula et al. 2012) suggests, however, that
new cosmological and world views came to dominate Caddo beliefs and mortuary ritual
usage after that time.

Burned Clay
Three small pieces of burned clay were recovered in three of the 5 x 5 ft. excavation units,
one each in N420 E475, level 1; N430 E455, level 3; and N450 E450, level 1. Because
of the very low densities, the burned clay from the site likely represents the incidental
burning of soil exposed to heat from hearths or earth ovens, and is not a product of the
burning of structures.

Lithic Artifacts
The lithic artifacts from the Keering site consist of 33 chipped stone tools (arrow points,
dart points, a gouge, and flake tools), 14 non-tool bifaces, three ground stone tools, a
hammerstone, seven cores, 373 pieces of lithic debris, and two fire-cracked rocks. The
occurrence of several different kinds of arrow points and dart points in the assemblage
suggests the site was occupied prehistorically at several different times, most notably
during the Woodland period (ca. 2500â1150 years BP) and the early part (ca. 500â400
years BP) of the Late Caddo period.

Arrow Points
The arrow points from the Keering site include three preforms, three tip and blade
fragments, five Perdiz or cf. Perdiz points, a cf. Bonham-Perdiz point, and a Colbert point
(Table 14-12). These are from surface contexts (n=3, Lots 0 and 1), unknown provenience

(n=1, Lot 3), and hand-excavated units (n=9). There are single arrow points from N400
E505 (Lot 4) and N445 E450 (Lot 13), two points from N430 E455 (Lot 11) and N515
E505 (Lot 21), and three points from N420 E475 (Lot 8).
The arrow point preforms, including one with a contracting stem that appears to be a
preform for a Perdiz point, are made from fine- and coarse-grained quartzite (Figure 14-7f).
Two are bifacially-flaked, but the Perdiz preform is unifacially flaked, as are the majority
of the Perdiz points in the assemblage. Eighty percent of the Perdiz and cf. Perdiz points
are unifacially flaked (Figure 14-7a-c). They are made from a mixture of local (40 percent,
quartzite) and non-local (60 percent, quartz, black chert, and yellow novaculite from the
Red River or Bowie gravels) lithic raw materials. In Big Cypress Creek sites, contracting
stem Perdiz arrow points are most commonly found in post-AD 1300 Middle and Late
Caddo sites, notably so in ca. AD 1450â1550 Titus phase sites in the region (see Turner
1978).
One arrow point is classified as a cf. Bonham-Perdiz arrow point (see Figure 14-7d). This
nomenclature follows Shafer (2008:57), its purpose being to differentiate the tapered
contracting stem of the Perdiz point from the parallel and then tapered stems of the
Bonham-Perdiz point. Such points have been found in 14th and 15th century Middle Caddo
period contexts in East Texas. The example from the Keering site is unifacially flaked and
made from a local fine-grained quartzite.
A Colbert arrow point (see Figure 14-7e) was found in a surface collection at the site. This
point, typically thought to date from ca. AD 1000â1200, has an expanding stem, a slightly
convex base, and was bifacially flaked on a fine-grained quartzite.
514 AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Dart Points
The 11 dart points at the Keering site are bifacially-flaked tools and tool fragments from
both surface (n=5) and hand-excavated unit (n=6) contexts (Table 14-13). They occur from
0.0â1.0 ft. bs in the archeological deposits.
Seven (54 percent) of the dart points are of the contracting stem Gary type (Figure 14-8bd), and another is a very small Gary or Garyito (Figure 14-8e), as described by Webb et
al. (1969:44). The seven Gary points include six var. Camden specimens and one var.
LeFlore (see Schambach 1982:Tables 7-3 and 7-4). The thicker (8.6 mm) and wider (19.1
mm stem width) var. LeFlore Gary, made from a brown chert, is considered by Schambach
(1982) to have been made and used between ca. 2350â1750 years BP, and the thinner
(5.2â6.3 mm) and narrower (11.0â15.0 mm) var. Camden was made and used between
1750â1250 years BP. The Garyito probably falls temporally at the end of this temporal
range, ca. 1250 years BP, in the Late Woodland.

+=blade resharpening is present

The Gary points are on local quartzites and a local brown chert. They are bifacially chipped
and generally have resharpened blades (see Table 12-13), suggesting their use as knives
or cutting tools as well as projectile points.
Another Woodland period point style in the Keering tool assemblage is a Godley or Ensor
(see Turner et al. 2011) point from a surface collection (see Figure 14-8a). The point is
made from a fine-grained quartzite and has an expanding stem, a convex base, and corner
notches.
One of the dart points from N515 E505 has shallow side notching and a convex base,
as well as a distal impact fracture (see Figure 14-8f); it is made from a local coarsegrained quartzite. The age of this point is not known, but dart points with more prominent
side notching tend to be of Middle Archaic (ca. 8000â5000 years BP) age in the TransMississippi South region.
The one dart point made from a non-local chert is a tip fragment from unit N515 E505.

Bifaces
There are 14 bifaces in the Keering site lithic assemblage (Table 14-14). Nine are from
surface contexts (Lots 0 and 1), one is from an unknown provenience (Lot 3), and the other
four are from hand-excavated units: N420 E475 (0.0â0.5 ft. bs), N420 E475 (0.5â1.0 ft.
bs), N450 E500 (0.5â1.0 ft. bs), and N515 E505 (1.0â1.25 ft. bs).
One of the bifaces is an initial package reduction biface, five represent blank preparation,
and the other eight are shaped and thinned (to some extent) biface preforms; none have
any evidence of use-wear from a macroscopic examination but detailed microscopic

use-wear analysis was not conducted. The bifaces are produced from pebbles of mainly
local lithic raw materials (86 percent), but two bifaces (14 percent) are made from nonlocal novaculite (see Table 14-14).
The initial reduction package biface (on a local fine-grained quartzite) is on a 37.8 x 38.6
mm (length and width) pebble of fine-grained quartzite. Cortex is present on 40 percent
of the piece. The blank prepared bifaces (on local quartzite and petrified wood), four from
hand-excavated units, all have cortex remnants (5â40 percent) and range from 8.1â
17.8 mm in thickness, with lengths of 33.1â49.7 mm. The biface preforms have been
significantly thinned (ranging from 6.9â9.4 mm) compared to the biface blanks, and 63
percent of the preforms have no cortical remnants, and those that do have cortex have only

a range from 5â20 percent (see Table 14-14). The preforms tend more often to be broken
fragments than the other bifaces in the assemblage. One of the preforms is only 3.3 mm
thick (from Lot 0) and may be a fragment of an arrow point preform, but the others are
likely discarded dart point preforms. Local raw materials were the preferred raw material
in the preforms (75 percent)âincluding fine and coarse-grained quartzite, petrified wood,
and yellow chertâbut 25 percent are on non-local gray and red novaculite.

Gouges
A single thin (19.8 mm) hematite cobble from surface contexts (Lot 1) has one modified
edge shaped with chipped hard hammer flakes. This piece may represent the beginnings
of the shaping of a chipped stone gouge, but it was discarded before it was fully shaped or
a working tool edge created. The cobble is 89.6 x 68.9 mm in length and width.

Flake Tools
Five of the eight flake tools from the Keering site are from surface contexts (Table 14-15,
Lots 0â1). The others are from units: N400 E505 (0.0â0.5 ft. bs); N405 E465 (0.0â0.5 ft.
bs); and N515 E505 (0.5â1.0 ft. bs).

The flake tools are on medium to large-sized flakes (S3 and S4 size grades), primarily
cortical, from local (88 percent) and non-local (12 percent) lithic raw materials. Coarsegrained and fine-grained quartzite raw materials account for 75 percent of the flake tools,
and 86 percent of the local raw materials selected for use. The one flake tool on a nonlocal lithic raw material is a grayish-brown chert, probably procured from Red River gravels
well to the north of the site.
The flake tools have evidence of use-wear/retouch (i.e. small step fractures) on one (n=4)
or two (n=2) lateral flake edges, or use-wear/retouch along the distal edge of the flake
(n=2). Use-wear lengths range from 7.7â21.0 mm for unilateral flake tools, 16.7â30.9 mm
for bilateral tools, and 10.0â12.0 mm for distal flake tools (see Table 12-15). These tools
were likely used for light scraping, cutting, and shredding activities on plant materials and
wood.

Cores
There are three different kinds of cores (n=7) at the Keering site: tested pebble (n=1),
single platform (n=1), and multiple platform (n=5) (Table 14-16). The cores are from the
surface (n=5, Lots 1 and 3) and two test units: N420 E475 (0.0â0.5 ft. bs, Lot 8) and
N430 E455 (0.5â1.0 ft. bs, Lot 11).
The cores are on pebbles that were apparently reduced to obtain flakes for tool manufacture.
Other pebbles were directly reduced into bifaces and dart points. The cores range from
28.4â64.3 mm in length, 19.0â37.9 mm in width, and 11.6â21.5 mm in thickness. The
tested pebble and single platform cores have 2â3 flake removals, while the multiple
platform cores have between 5â14. The extent of cortex on the cores ranges from 40â95
percent.

Six of the cores (86 percent) are on local quartzite and earth-toned chert, and the single
platform core is on a non-local yellow novaculite (see Table 14-16). This raw material would
have been available in either Red River or Bowie (interfluvial landforms between the Red
and Sulphur River basins) gravels.

Lithic Debris
Lithic debris from chipped stone tool manufacture (and possibly ground stone tool
manufacture) is represented by 373 flakes and flake fragments of varying size grades from
a wide variety of local and non-local raw material sources (Table 14-17). The vast majority
of the lithic debris is Size Grade 2 (S2, 6.4â12.7 mm, 50.7 percent) and S3 (12.7â19.2
mm, 29.5 percent), with moderate amounts of S4 (19.2â25.4 mm, 15 percent) lithic
debris. Small (S1, less than 6.4 mm) and Large (S5, >25.4 mm) pieces of lithic debris only
account for 1.1-3.5 percent of the sample.
In addition to the generally small size of the lithic debris from the Keering site, a considerable
percentage (60 percent) of it has cortical remnants. The percentage of cortex increases
exponentially by size grade, from 25 percent in S1, 43 percent in S2, 71 percent in S3, 88
percent in S4, and 100 percent in S5 (see Table 14-17). The generally small to medium
size of the lithic debris, and the considerable proportions of cortical flakes in all size grades
(but especially the larger debris sizes), suggests that the chipped stone tool knapping on
this site in general was primarily the result of the regular initial reduction and thinning (with
soft and hard hammer percussion flakes) of pebbles and small cobbles that were cortexcovered, along with some further shaping and thinning of pebbles, cores, and bifaces, as
well as the production of flakes for tools.
Lithic raw material from controlled contexts is concentrated in two units 20â30 ft. southwest
of the possible midden area (see Figure 14-2): N430 E455 and N420 E475 (Table 14-18).
Much smaller densities of lithic debris occurred in the possible midden itself, and in units
50â65 ft. to the north, south, and west.

and S3 size grades, represent 11.2 percent of the Keering site lithic debris (see Table
14-19).
The percentage of cortex by raw material class in the lithic debris is not significantly
different. In the local cherts, quartzite, and other local raw materials (mainly petrified
wood), cortical flakes account for 60 percent of the lithic debris. Almost 55 percent of the
non-local chert, novaculite, and quartz raw material lithic debris are cortical pieces (see
Table 14-19). These high proportions of cortical pieces certainly seem to suggest that the
knapping of cortex-covered pebbles and cobbles took place on the site amongst all lithic
raw materials.
How do we account for the similarities in cortex percentage in materials from local vs.
geographically dispersed non-local raw materials? One possibility is that the raw materials
that have been identified as non-local in the Keering site assemblage may not actually
be from non-local sources, but this seems unlikely since no non-local looking cherts
(non-earth-toned colors), novaculite, or quartz have been identified in any of the nine raw
material source areas identified in the Prairie Creek basin (see Chapter 11). It is possible,
however, that materials such as these may now lie buried in the Prairie Creek floodplain, but
were exposed in gravels at the time the Keering site was occupied by aboriginal peoples.
Extensive geoarcheological investigations would be necessary to evaluate the likelihood of
this possibility. It may be the case instead, and we lean towards this third possibility, that
cortex-covered pebbles and cobblesârather than tools or nearly completed toolsâof these
distinctive materials from other locales were obtained as raw material through trade/
exchange (after the establishment of sedentary communities) or direct procurement (in
earlier times, when populations were not sedentary). These pebbles and small cobbles
were then reduced on the Keering Site rather than at some other location to obtain the
necessary bifacial and flake tools.

Hammerstone
The one hammerstone (Lot 0, from the surface) is on a stream-rolled coarse-grained
quartzite pebble. It has battering on one flat surface on the end of the cobble. The
hammerstone is 46.8 x 35.2 x 22.0 mm in length, width, and thickness.

Ground Stone Tools
All three ground stone tools from the Keering site were collected from surface contexts.
They include a mano/pitted stone, a pitted stone, and a grinding slab fragment (Table
14-20).
The grinding slab fragment has a grinding surface that is flat, with evidence for back and
forth grinding with a hand-held tool, leaving the grinding surface both smoothed and
polished from extensive use. The slab is otherwise unmodified for use.

Both surfaces of the mano have flat and smoothed grinding surfaces: a 57 x 62 mm area

centrally-placed pit or depression (17 mm in diameter and 2 mm in depth) that has been

The pitted stone is an otherwise unmodified ferruginous sandstone cobble that has a

and 6 mm in depth.

Fire-Cracked Rocks
Two small pieces (weighing 13.9 g) of coarse-grained quartzite fire-cracked rocks are in the
Keering artifact assemblage, testifying to the occasional use of hot rock cooking during
one or more of the prehistoric occupations. The pieces are from the surface (Lot 0) and
N450 E500, 0.5â1.0 ft. bs (Lot 18).

Summary and Conclusions
The Keering site (41CP21) in the upper Prairie Creek stream basin in Camp County received
limited test excavations by the Texas Department of Highways and Public Transportation in
1974 as part of the U.S. 271 project. The site was discovered by an avocational archeologist
after the survey of the U.S. 271 right-of-way had been completed and the area cleared of
brush and trees by heavy equipment. The test excavations consisted of 8 5 x 5 ft. handexcavated units and several gradall trenches.
During the work, no archeological features such as pits or post holes were identified,
although a possible darkly-stained midden area was defined in the area of N450 E500
(see Figure 14-2). Archeological deposits were shallow in the sandy loam sediments at the
site, no more than 46 cm thick across the site, and because these deposits occur on a
stable upland surface, artifacts of different ages (ranging from at least Woodland to Late
Caddo period times) are found together in the same levels and sediments. These materials
are concentrated in units N420 E475 and N430 E455.

Chapter 14

A wide variety of prehistoric ceramic and lithic artifacts were recovered from the Keering
site during the archeological investigations. Although no radiocarbon or TL dates have
been obtained from the site, the temporally diagnostic artifacts (i.e. decorated ceramic
sherds, arrow points, and dart points) found there indicate that it may have been occupied
as early as the Middle Archaic period (ca. 8000â5000 years BP), but its main periods
of use were during the Woodland period (ca. 1750â1250 years BP) and the early part
of the Late Caddo Titus phase (ca. 500â400 years BP). One Colbert arrow point in the
assemblage suggests a limited use as well between ca. 750â950 years BP, and a Keno
Trailed bottle sherd is consistent with a very limited use by the Caddo after 350 years BP.
Thurmond (1981, 1990a:149â152) had previously analyzed the artifacts recovered by
Texas Department of Highways and Public Transportation archeologists from their 1974
work at the Keering site. He concluded that there were three prehistoric components at
the site: â1) a Middle Archaic limited use area; 2) an Early Ceramic limited use area; and 3)
a late Whelan phase small settlementâ (Thurmond 1990a:152). Thurmond did not offer an
absolute date range for the latter component, though, given his estimated temporal span
for the Whelan phase, it can be inferred that he meant an age range of ca. AD 1400â1500.
Thurmondâs (1990a) findings about use of the Keering site in Middle Archaic and Early
Ceramic period timesânow commonly referred to as the Woodland periodâare in basic
agreement with the current study in that temporally diagnostic artifacts indicate the site
was used to a limited extent during both the Middle Archaic and the Woodland/Early
Ceramic periods. We did not identify any Williams Plain pottery in the assemblage, which
may have been important in Thurmondâs identification of a Woodland period component
at the site, although that is unstated in Thurmondâs analysis. Instead, we relied on the
prevalence of Woodland period contracting stem Gary dart points. Our identification of one
of the arrow points from the site as a Colbert type also indicates a third limited use here,
one not identified by Thurmond, in the Early Caddo period.
The Whelan phase was first recognized during the 1950s when the University of Texas
undertook work at Lake Oâ The Pines (Davis et al. 2010). It was defined as a local
Late Caddo archeological culture known from a few sites with an apparently distinctive
ceramic assemblage in the middle reaches of the Big Cypress Creek basin (Thurmond
1985, 1990a:228), particularly âcarelessly executed, curvilinear hatchuresâ along several
varieties of Ripley Engraved. Thurmond (1990:Table 8) later estimated that the best
known sites of the Whelan phase were at Lake Oâ the Pines (41MR2 and 41UR11) and
date to AD 1400â1500. However, the chronological span of the Whelan phase was always
poorly developed. At the time of Thurmondâs analysis for the Late Caddo period sequence
(Thurmond 1990a:Table 60; Story 1990:Table 81) few absolute dates were available. The
few calibrated radiocarbon dates known for the Whelan phase indicate it began no earlier
than AD 1387 (Perttula 2010:Table 1). Since Thurmond completed his artifact analyses at
the Keering site, no new Whelan phase radiocarbon dates have been obtained.

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

More recent excavations in the Big Cypress Creek, White Oak Creek, Sabine River, and
Sulphur River basins in East Texas, however, have aggressively pursued Late Caddo
dating strategies, and more than 200 calibrated radiocarbon dates from Titus phase
contexts suggest that it dates from ca. AD 1430â1680 (Fields and Gadus 2012; Perttula
2005:Tables 11-2 and 11-3, 2012; Perttula and Selden 2012), if not a tad earlier in the
fifteenth century AD.
The dates from Whelan phase contexts from Lake Oâ The Pines sites fall into two clusters:
one spanning the period from cal AD 1387â1483 (three dates), and the other spanning the
period from cal AD 1444â1666 (eight dates). The latter cluster of dates, with three dates
from Harroun (41UR10) and two dates from Sam Roberts (41CP8), is contemporaneous with
those obtained in recent years from Titus phase domestic and mound-building contexts;
the earlier calibrated cluster of dates also overlaps with the beginning years of the Titus
phase. This strongly suggests that the components at the Whelan phase sites at Lake Oâ
The Pines in the Big Cypress Creek basin can best be included in the early part of the Titus
phase. In fact, Fields and Gadus (2012:673) argue that the Whelan phase âis a construct
that probably should be discarded.â The material culture record at the Lake Oâ The Pines
Whelan phase sites (see Thurmond 1990a:Table 8; Perttula 1992:Table A-1) suggests that
they were mainly occupied during what is now known to be the early part of the Titus phase
(see Fields and Gadus 2012:673), with a variety of motifs of Ripley Engraved fine ware that
continued to be made by Caddo potters until the seventeenth century, Other characteristic
artifact types include Maydelle Incised, Bullard Brushed, and Pease Brushed-Incised utility
wares and noded jars, along with Perdiz and Bassett arrow points.
Taking these findings into consideration, especially the overlapping calibrated radiocarbon
dates between what Thurmond considered Whelan phase occupations and more recent
well-dated Titus phase components, our conclusion that the Keering site was occupied
in the early part of the Titus phase (ca. AD 1450â1550) is consistent in taxonomic and
chronological usage with Thurmondâs now out-of-date terminological use of the Whelan
phase. Finally, the one Keno Trailed bottle sherd in the Keering site ceramic assemblage
points to a finalâbut previously unrecognizedâlimited use by the Caddo after ca. AD 1600.
Based on our analysis, the ceramic assemblage from the Keering site is characteristic
of a domestic Titus phase assemblage based on the occurrence of sherds from small
to medium-sized plain wares, utility wares (mainly brushed, incised, and tool punctated),
and fine wares (engraved and red-slipped). Among the rims, 36 percent are from plain
vessels, 46 percent are from utility ware jars, and 18 percent are from fine ware bowls
and carinated bowls. The sherds are from grog-tempered vesselsâwhich is consistent with
Titus phase ceramic practices in much of the Big Cypress Creek basinâoften with sandy
paste, indicating the regular use of naturally sandy alluvial clays. Bone temper was also
regularly added to the vessel paste, particularly in utility wares. The vessels were fired
most frequently in a reducing or low oxygen environment, but then they were cooled in
the open air, leaving one or both vessel surfaces with a thin oxidized brown and yellowishbrown lens in the vessel core.
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. 529

Chapter 14

The decorated sherds are dominated by utility wares (77 percent of the 343 decorated
sherds in the ceramic assemblage) from Harleton Appliqued, Bullard Brushed, Maydelle
Incised, Killough Pinched, and Mockingbird Punctated jars. Fine wares are primarily from
Ripley Engraved (several varieties) carinated bowls and bottles. Both red and white pigments
were commonly added (16 percent of the fine wares) to the engraved decorations of the
Keering site fine ware sherds. These locally-made ceramics at the site are supplemented
with sherds from non-locally made Cowhide Stamped and Keno Trailed vessels.
The chipped stone assemblage from the Keering site includes arrow points and arrow point
preforms, dart points, bifaces, flake tools, one gouge, several cores, and 373 pieces of lithic
debris. The most common arrow points are of the Perdiz type, and these are associated
with the early Titus phase occupation; Bonham-Perdiz and Colbert arrow points are likely
from an unrelated Caddo occupation(s). The dart points are primarily of Woodland period
age, including Gary, var. Camden and var. LeFlore, a Garyito, and a Godley. Bifaces are
primarily associated with this component at the site, given that they represent blanks and
preforms intended for dart point manufacture.
Cores in the assemblage are multiple and single platform flake cores on pebbles and small
cobbles. The analysis of the lithic debris noted its generally small to medium size, and the
considerable proportions of cortical flakes in all size grades (but especially the larger debris
sizes). This suggests that the chipped stone tool knapping on this site was primarily the
result of the regular initial reduction and thinning (with soft and hard hammer percussion
flakes) of pebbles and small cobbles that were cortex-covered, along with some further
shaping and thinning of pebbles, cores, and bifaces, as well as the production of flakes for
tools. Cortex-covered pebbles and small cobbles of these distinctive materials from Bowie
Gravels (ca. 60â70 miles to the northeast) or from Red River gravels below the confluence
of the Kiamichi River (70â80 miles to the north), were either obtained through trade/
exchange or direct procurement. These pebbles and small cobbles were then reduced on
site to obtain the necessary bifacial and flake tools.
The aboriginal peoples that occupied the Keering site relied heavily on the use of locally
available lithic raw materials in the form of pebbles and small cobbles for the production of
stone tools, including coarse- and fine-grained quartzite, petrified wood, and earth-toned
cherts; these materials are present in several raw material source areas in the Prairie
Creek stream basin. Locally available lithic raw materials account for 77 percent of the
arrow points, 91 percent of the dart points, 88 percent of the flake tools, 86 percent of
the bifaces, 86 percent of the cores, and 89 percent of the lithic debris. The slightly higher
use of non-local lithic raw materials in the arrow points indicates a more ready access to
non-local raw material sources during the Late Caddo Titus phase occupation. The nonlocal lithic raw materials at the Keering site have their ultimate derivation in the Ouachita
Mountains of southeastern Oklahoma, but Red River and Bowie gravels more than 60
miles from the site were the most accessible source areas to obtain a variety of cherts,
different colors of novaculite, and quartz.

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

A few ground stone tools were recovered from the Keering site, namely grinding slabs,
manos, and pitted stones of locally available hematite and ferruginous sandstone. These
were used to grind, pound, and pulverize plant foods, most likely during the Woodland
period occupation, although these kinds of ground stone tools were in use during the Titus
phase occupation at the Kitchen Branch site (see Chapter 11).
One of the bifaces is an initial package reduction biface, five represent blank preparation,
and the other eight are shaped and thinned (to some extent) biface preforms; none have
any evidence of use-wear. The bifaces are produced from pebbles of mainly local lithic raw
materials (86 percent), but two bifaces (14 percent) are made from non-local novaculite
(see Table 14-14).
The initial reduction package biface (on a local fine-grained quartzite) is on a 37.8 x 38.6
mm (length and width) pebble of fine-grained quartzite. Cortex is present on 40 percent
of the piece. The blank prepared bifaces (on local quartzite and petrified wood), four from
hand-excavated units, all have cortex remnants (5â40 percent) and range from 8.1â
17.8 mm in thickness, with lengths of 33.1â49.7 mm. The biface preforms have been
significantly thinned (ranging from 6.9â9.4 mm) compared to the biface blanks, and 63
percent of the preforms have no cortical remnants, and those that do have cortex have only
a range from 5â20 percent (see Table 14-14). The preforms tend more often to be broken
fragments than the other bifaces in the assemblage. One of the preforms is only 3.3 mm
thick (from Lot 0) and may be a fragment of an arrow point preform, but the others are
likely discarded dart point preforms. Local raw materials were the preferred raw material
in the preforms (75 percent)âincluding fine and coarse-grained quartzite, petrified wood,
and yellow chertâbut 25 percent are on non-local gray and red novaculite.

Gouges
A single thin (19.8 mm) hematite cobble from surface contexts (Lot 1) has one modified
edge shaped with chipped hard hammer flakes. This piece may represent the beginnings
of the shaping of a chipped stone gouge, but it was discarded before it was fully shaped or
a working tool edge created. The cobble is 89.6 x 68.9 mm in length and width.

Flake Tools
Five of the eight flake tools from the Keering site are from surface contexts (see Table
14-15, Lots 0â1). The others are from units: N400 E505 (0.0â0.5 ft. bs); N405 E465
(0.0â0.5 ft. bs); and N515 E505 (0.5â1.0 ft. bs).
The flake tools are on medium to large-sized flakes (S3 and S4 size grades), primarily
cortical, from local (88 percent) and non-local (12 percent) lithic raw materials. Coarsegrained and fine-grained quartzite raw materials account for 75 percent of the flake tools,
and 86 percent of the local raw materials selected for use. The one flake tool on a non-

local lithic raw material is a grayish-brown chert, probably procured from Red River gravels
well to the north of the site.
The flake tools have evidence of use-wear/retouch (i.e. small step fractures) on one (n=4)
or two (n=2) lateral flake edges, or use-wear/retouch along the distal edge of the flake
(n=2). Use-wear lengths range from 7.7â21.0 mm for unilateral flake tools, 16.7â30.9 mm
for bilateral tools, and 10.0â12.0 mm for distal flake tools (see Table 12-15). These tools
were likely used for light scraping, cutting, and shredding activities on plant materials and
wood.

Cores
There are three different kinds of cores (n=7) at the Keering site: tested pebble (n=1),
single platform (n=1), and multiple platform (n=5) (see Table 14-16). The cores are from
the surface (n=5, Lots 1 and 3) and two test units: N420 E475 (0.0â0.5 ft. bs, Lot 8) and
N430 E455 (0.5â1.0 ft. bs, Lot 11).
The cores are on pebbles that were apparently reduced to obtain flakes for tool manufacture.
Other pebbles were directly reduced into bifaces and dart points. The cores range from
28.4â64.3 mm in length, 19.0â37.9 mm in width, and 11.6â21.5 mm in thickness. The
tested pebble and single platform cores have 2â3 flake removals, while the multiple
platform cores have between 5â14. The extent of cortex on the cores ranges from 40â95
percent.
Six of the cores (86 percent) are on local quartzite and earth-toned chert, and the single
platform core is on a non-local yellow novaculite (see Table 14-16). This raw material would
have been available in either Red River or Bowie (interfluvial landforms between the Red
and Sulphur river basins) gravels.

Lithic Debris
Lithic debris from chipped stone tool manufacture (and possibly ground stone tool
manufacture) is represented by 373 flakes and flake fragments of varying size grades
from a wide variety of local and non-local raw material sources (see Table 14-17). The
vast majority of the lithic debris is Size Grade 2 (S2, 6.4â12.7 mm, 50.7 percent) and
S3 (12.7â19.2 mm, 29.5 percent), with moderate amounts of S4 (19.2â25.4 mm, 15
percent) lithic debris. Small (S1, less than 6.4 mm) and Large (S5, >25.4 mm) pieces of
lithic debris only account for 1.1-3.5 percent of the sample.
In addition to the generally small size of the lithic debris from the Keering site, a considerable
percentage (60 percent) of it has cortical remnants. The percentage of cortex increases
exponentially by size grade, from 25 percent in S1, 43 percent in S2, 71 percent in S3, 88
percent in S4, and 100 percent in S5 (see Table 14-17). The generally small to medium

size of the lithic debris, and the considerable proportions of cortical flakes in all size grades
(but especially the larger debris sizes), suggests that the chipped stone tool knapping on
this site in general was primarily the result of the regular initial reduction and thinning (with
soft and hard hammer percussion flakes) of pebbles and small cobbles that were cortexcovered, along with some further shaping and thinning of pebbles, cores, and bifaces, as
well as the production of flakes for tools.
Lithic raw material from controlled contexts is concentrated in two units 20â30 ft.
southwest of the possible midden area (see Figure 14-2): N430 E455 and N420 E475
(see Table 14-18). Much smaller densities of lithic debris occurred in the possible midden
itself, and in units 50â65 ft. to the north, south, and west.
The archeological deposits at the Keering site are shallow, and lithic debris was recovered
only from 0.0â1.5 ft. (0â46 cm bs) (see Table 14-18). More than 85 percent of the lithic
debris is from only 0.0â1.0 ft. bs (0â30.5 cm bs), and almost all of the lithic debris from
30.5â46 cm bs is from N430 E455.
The lithic debris from the Keering site is dominated by Size Grade S2 flakes of local raw
materials, particularly coarse and fine-grained quartzite. These two raw materials account
for 75.8 percent of the lithic debris sample (see Table 14-19). Local earth-toned cherts
comprise 5.9 percent of the debris assemblage, followed by other local raw materials
such as petrified wood, hematite, and ferruginous sandstone (7.0 percent). S4 pieces
of lithic debris are more common among these latter lithic raw materials; the hematite
and ferruginous sandstone flakes may be the product of ground stone tool shaping and
rejuvenation.
Lithic raw materials that have been identified as of non-local origin includes various cherts
(6.4 percent), novaculite (4.3 percent), and quartz (0.5 percent) raw materials whose
ultimate origins lie in source areas in the Ouachita Mountains of southeastern Oklahoma,
and Red River and Bowie gravels. These non-local lithic raw materials, predominantly S2
and S3 size grades, represent 11.2 percent of the Keering site lithic debris (see Table
14-19).
The percentage of cortex by raw material class in the lithic debris is not significantly
different. In the local cherts, quartzite, and other local raw materials (mainly petrified
wood), cortical flakes account for 60 percent of the lithic debris. Almost 55 percent of the
non-local chert, novaculite, and quartz raw material lithic debris are cortical pieces (see
Table 14-19). These high proportions of cortical pieces certainly seem to suggest that the
knapping of cortex-covered pebbles and cobbles took place on the site amongst all lithic
raw materials.
How do we account for the similarities in cortex percentage in materials from local vs.
geographically dispersed non-local raw materials? One possibility is that the raw materials
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. 533

Chapter 14

that have been identified as non-local in the Keering site assemblage may not actually
be from non-local sources, but this seems unlikely since no non-local looking cherts
(non-earth-toned colors), novaculite, or quartz have been identified in any of the nine raw
material source areas identified in the Prairie Creek basin (see Chapter 11). It is possible,
however, that materials such as these may now lie buried in the Prairie Creek floodplain, but
were exposed in gravels at the time the Keering site was occupied by aboriginal peoples.
Extensive geoarcheological investigations would be necessary to evaluate the likelihood of
this possibility. It may be the case instead, and we lean towards this third possibility, that
cortex-covered pebbles and cobblesârather than tools or nearly completed toolsâof these
distinctive materials from other locales were obtained as raw material through trade/
exchange (after the establishment of sedentary communities) or direct procurement (in
earlier times, when populations were not sedentary). These pebbles and small cobbles
were then reduced on the Keering Site rather than at some other location to obtain the
necessary bifacial and flake tools.

Hammerstone
The one hammerstone (Lot 0, from the surface) is on a stream-rolled coarse-grained
quartzite pebble. It has battering on one flat surface on the end of the cobble. The
hammerstone is 46.8 x 35.2 x 22.0 mm in length, width, and thickness.

Ground Stone Tools
All three ground stone tools from the Keering site were collected from surface contexts.
They include a mano/pitted stone, a pitted stone, and a grinding slab fragment (see Table
14-20).
The grinding slab fragment has a grinding surface that is flat, with evidence for back and
forth grinding with a hand-held tool, leaving the grinding surface both smoothed and
polished from extensive use. The slab is otherwise unmodified for use.
Both surfaces of the mano have flat and smoothed grinding surfaces: a 57 x 62 mm area
on one side, and 40 x 26 mm on the other. The smaller grinding surface has a single
centrally-placed pit or depression (17 mm in diameter and 2 mm in depth) that has been
pecked in the grinding surface.
The pitted stone is an otherwise unmodified ferruginous sandstone cobble that has a
single large pecked pit or depression along one lateral edge. The pit is 32 mm in diameter
and 6 mm in depth.

Fire-Cracked Rocks
Two small pieces (weighing 13.9 g) of coarse-grained quartzite fire-cracked rocks are in the
Keering artifact assemblage, testifying to the occasional use of hot rock cooking during
one or more of the prehistoric occupations. The pieces are from the surface (Lot 0) and
N450 E500, 0.5â1.0 ft. bs (Lot 18).

Summary and Conclusions
The Keering site (41CP21) in the upper Prairie Creek stream basin in Camp County received
limited test excavations by the Texas Department of Highways and Public Transportation in
1974 as part of the U.S. 271 project. The site was discovered by an avocational archeologist
after the survey of the U.S. 271 right-of-way had been completed and the area cleared of
brush and trees by heavy equipment. The test excavations consisted of 8 5 x 5 ft. handexcavated units and several gradall trenches.
During the work, no archeological features such as pits or post holes were identified,
although a darkly-stained possible midden area was defined in the area of N450 E500
(see Figure 14-2). Archeological deposits were shallow in the sandy loam sediments at the
site, no more than 46 cm thick across the site, and because these deposits occur on a
stable upland surface, artifacts of different ages (ranging from at least Woodland to Late
Caddo period times) are found together in the same levels and sediments. These materials
are concentrated in units N420 E475 and N430 E455.
A wide variety of prehistoric ceramic and lithic artifacts were recovered from the Keering
site during the archeological investigations. Although no radiocarbon or TL dates have
been obtained from the site, the temporally diagnostic artifacts (i.e. decorated ceramic
sherds, arrow points, and dart points) found there indicate that it may have been occupied
as early as the Middle Archaic period (ca. 8000â5000 years BP), but its main periods
of use were during the Woodland period (ca. 1750â1250 years BP) and the early part
of the Late Caddo Titus phase (ca. 500â400 years BP). One Colbert arrow point in the
assemblage suggests a limited use as well between ca. 750â950 years BP, and a Keno
Trailed bottle sherd is consistent with a very limited use by the Caddo after 350 years BP.
Thurmond (1981, 1990:149â152) had previously analyzed the artifacts recovered by
Texas Department of Highways and Public Transportation archeologists from their 1974
work at the Keering site. He concluded that there were three prehistoric components at
the site: â1) a Middle Archaic limited use area; 2) an Early Ceramic limited use area; and 3)
a late Whelan phase small settlementâ (Thurmond 1990:152). Thurmond did not offer an
absolute date range for the later component, though, given his estimated temporal span
for the Whelan phase we infer that he meant an age range of ca. AD 1400â1500.
Thurmondâs (1990) findings about use of the Keering site in Middle Archaic and Early
Ceramic period timesânow commonly referred to as the Woodland periodâare in basic
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. 535

Chapter 14

agreement with the current study in that temporally diagnostic artifacts indicate the site
was used to a limited extent during both the Middle Archaic and the Woodland/Early
Ceramic periods. We did not identify any Williams Plain pottery in the assemblage, which
may have been important in Thurmondâs identification of a Woodland period component
at the site, although that is unstated in Thurmondâs analysis. Instead, we relied on the
prevalence of Woodland period contracting stem Gary dart points. Our identification of one
of the arrow points from the site as a Colbert type also indicates a third limited use here,
one not identified by Thurmond, in the Early Caddo period.
The Whelan phase was first recognized during the 1950s when the University of Texas
undertook work at Lake Oâ The Pines (Davis et al. 2010). It was defined as a local
Late Caddo archeological culture known from a few sites with an apparently distinctive
ceramic assemblage in the middle reaches of the Big Cypress Creek basin (Thurmond
1985, 1990:228), particularly âcarelessly executed, curvilinear hatchuresâ along several
varieties of Ripley Engraved. Thurmond (1990:Table 8) later estimated that the best known
sites of the Whelan phase were at Lake Oâ the Pines (41MR2 and 41UR11) and date
to AD 1400â1500. However, the chronological span of the Whelan phase was always
poorly developed. At the time of Thurmondâs analysis for the Late Caddo period sequence
(Thurmond 1990:Table 60; Story 1990:Table 81) few absolute dates were available.
The few calibrated radiocarbon dates known for the Whelan phase indicate it began no
earlier than AD 1387 (Perttula 2010:Table 1). Since Thurmond conducted his work at Site
41CP21, no new Whelan phase radiocarbon dates have been obtained.
More recent excavations in the Big Cypress Creek, White Oak Creek, Sabine River, and
Sulphur River basins in East Texas, however, have aggressively pursued Late Caddo
dating strategies, and more than 200 calibrated radiocarbon dates from Titus phase
contexts suggest that it dates from ca. AD 1430â1680 (Fields and Gadus 2012; Perttula
2005:Tables 11-2 and 11-3, 2012; Perttula and Selden 2012), if not a tad earlier in the
fifteenth century AD.
The dates from Whelan phase contexts from Lake Oâ The Pines sites fall into two clusters:
one spanning the period from cal AD 1387â1483 (three dates), and the other spanning the
period from cal AD 1444â1666 (eight dates). The latter cluster of dates, with three dates
from Harroun (41UR10) and two dates from Sam Roberts (41CP8), is contemporaneous with
those obtained in recent years from Titus phase domestic and mound-building contexts;
the earlier calibrated cluster of dates also overlaps with the beginning years of the Titus
phase. This strongly suggests that the components at the Whelan phase sites at Lake Oâ
The Pines in the Big Cypress Creek basin can best be included in the early part of the Titus
phase. In fact, Fields and Gadus (2012:673) argue that the Whelan phase âis a construct
that probably should be discarded.â The material culture record at the Lake Oâ The Pines
Whelan phase sites (see Thurmond 1990:Table 8; Perttula 1992:Table A-1) suggests that
they were mainly occupied during what is now known to be the early part of the Titus phase
(see Fields and Gadus 2012:673), with a variety of motifs of Ripley Engraved fine ware that
continued to be made by Caddo potters until the seventeenth century, Other characteristic

artifact types include Maydelle Incised, Bullard Brushed, and Pease Brushed-Incised utility
wares and noded jars, along with Perdiz and Bassett arrow points.
Taking these findings into consideration, especially the overlapping calibrated radiocarbon
dates between what Thurmond considered Whelan phase occupations and more recent
well-dated Titus phase components, our conclusion that the Keering site was occupied
in the early part of the Titus phase (ca. AD 1450â1550) is consistent in taxonomic and
chronological usage with Thurmondâs now out-of-date terminological use of the Whelan
phase. Finally, the one Keno Trailed bottle sherd in the Keering site ceramic assemblage
points to a finalâbut previously unrecognizedâlimited use by the Caddo after ca. AD 1600.
Based on our analysis, the ceramic assemblage from the Keering site is characteristic
of a domestic Titus phase assemblage based on the occurrence of sherds from small
to medium-sized plain wares, utility wares (mainly brushed, incised, and tool punctated),
and fine wares (engraved and red-slipped). Among the rims, 36 percent are from plain
vessels, 46 percent are from utility ware jars, and 18 percent are from fine ware bowls
and carinated bowls. The sherds are from grog-tempered vesselsâwhich is consistent with
Titus phase ceramic practices in much of the Big Cypress Creek basinâoften with sandy
paste, indicating the regular use of naturally sandy alluvial clays. Bone temper was also
regularly added to the vessel paste, particularly in utility wares. The vessels were fired
most frequently in a reducing or low oxygen environment, but then they were cooled in
the open air, leaving one or both vessel surfaces with a thin oxidized brown and yellowishbrown lens in the vessel core.
The decorated sherds are dominated by utility wares (77 percent of the 343 decorated
sherds in the ceramic assemblage) from Harleton Appliqued, Bullard Brushed, Maydelle
Incised, Killough Pinched, and Mockingbird Punctated jars. Fine wares are primarily from
Ripley Engraved (several varieties) carinated bowls and bottles. Both red and white pigments
were commonly added (16 percent of the fine wares) to the engraved decorations of the
Keering site fine ware sherds. These locally-made ceramics at the site are supplemented
with sherds from non-locally made Cowhide Stamped and Keno Trailed vessels.
The chipped stone assemblage from the Keering site includes arrow points and arrow point
preforms, dart points, bifaces, flake tools, one gouge, several cores, and 373 pieces of lithic
debris. The most common arrow points are of the Perdiz type, and these are associated
with the early Titus phase occupation; Bonham-Perdiz and Colbert arrow points are likely
from an unrelated Caddo occupation(s). The dart points are primarily of Woodland period
age, including Gary, var. Camden and var. LeFlore, a Garyito, and a Godley. Bifaces are
primarily associated with this component at the site, given that they represent blanks and
preforms intended for dart point manufacture.
Cores in the assemblage are multiple and single platform flake cores on pebbles and small
cobbles. The analysis of the lithic debris noted its generally small to medium size, and the
considerable proportions of cortical flakes in all size grades (but especially the larger debris
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. 537

Chapter 14

sizes). This suggests that the chipped stone tool knapping on this site was primarily the
result of the regular initial reduction and thinning (with soft and hard hammer percussion
flakes) of pebbles and small cobbles that were cortex-covered, along with some further
shaping and thinning of pebbles, cores, and bifaces, as well as the production of flakes for
tools. Cortex-covered pebbles and small cobbles of these distinctive materials from Bowie
Gravels (ca. 60â70 miles to the northeast) or from Red River gravels below the confluence
of the Kiamichi River (70â80 miles to the north), were either obtained through trade/
exchange or direct procurement. These pebbles and small cobbles were then reduced on
site to obtain the necessary bifacial and flake tools.
The aboriginal peoples that occupied the Keering site relied heavily on the use of locally
available lithic raw materials in the form of pebbles and small cobbles for the production of
stone tools, including coarse- and fine-grained quartzite, petrified wood, and earth-toned
cherts; these materials are present in several raw material source areas in the Prairie
Creek stream basin. Locally available lithic raw materials account for 77 percent of the
arrow points, 91 percent of the dart points, 88 percent of the flake tools, 86 percent of
the bifaces, 86 percent of the cores, and 89 percent of the lithic debris. The slightly higher
use of non-local lithic raw materials in the arrow points indicates a more ready access to
non-local raw material sources during the Late Caddo Titus phase occupation. The nonlocal lithic raw materials at the Keerng site have their ultimate derivation in the Ouachita
Mountains of southeastern Oklahoma, but Red River and Bowie gravels more than 60
miles from the site were the most accessible source areas to obtain a variety of cherts,
different colors of novaculite, and quartz.
A few ground stone tools were recovered from the Keering site, namely grinding slabs,
manos, and pitted stones of locally available hematite and ferruginous sandstone. These
were used to grind, pound, and pulverize plant foods, most likely during the Woodland
period occupation, although these kinds of ground stone tools were in use during the Titus
phase occupation at the Kitchen Branch site (see Chapter 11).

Historic-Age Archeological Materials
Mindy Bonine, Rachel Feit, Mason Miller, and Chester P. Walker
During the survey and test excavations at the Kitchen Branch site (41CP220), two historic
components were investigated and recorded: a late nineteenth to early twentieth century
component, and an early to mid-twentieth century components (Perttula et al. 2005).
Historic-period artifacts were found on the southern knoll, the northern knoll, and the
northern and western sectors (see Figures 3-1 and 3-2). In addition, two historic-period
features were recorded on the northern knoll, which appeared to be the remains of a
farmstead. At the conclusion of these investigations, the historic components were deemed
to contain minimal research potential and were not recommended as eligible for inclusion
in the NRHP. Thus, the data recovery investigations concentrated on the NRHP-eligible
prehistoric Caddo components of the site on the southern knoll.
However, a quantity of historic period artifacts were recovered from the excavation block
and the mechanical scraping surrounding the block on the southern knoll; these were
collected and analyzed as part of the data recovery investigations. This chapter compiles
all of the historic period archeological data from the survey, testing, and data recovery
investigations, which includes recovered artifacts, features, and archival research
information. Then, a brief interpretation of the historic components of the Kitchen Branch
site is presented, which is followed by a discussion of the historic-period archeological
materialsâ (particularly the ferrous artifacts) effect on the remote sensing interpretations
from the investigations at the site.

Historic-age Components at the Kitchen Branch Site
The survey and testing investigations at the Kitchen Branch site recorded two distinct
historic-age components. The northernmost component at the site consisted of early to
mid-twentieth century artifacts (plastic and clear glass) found in a disturbed context in
three shovel tests (ST 17, 19, and 64). One clear bottle base fragment bore one of the
makerâs marks for the Illinois Glass Company which dated from 1915â1929 (Toulouse
1971). No features were found associated with these sparse artifacts, and no further work
was conducted in this area of the site (See Appendix 5-1).
The second component appeared to be the remains of a late nineteenth to early twentieth
century habitation area, possibly a farmstead. Several shovel tests during the survey (ST 1,
6, and 9â11) and units from the test excavations (Units 1, 3â4, 6â20, and 24â26; also BHT
2004-9 and ST 50) contained related historic-period artifacts. The test excavations at the
Kitchen Branch site determined that the main loci of this occupation was situated on the
northern knoll, where two features, a sandstone rock chimney fall (Feature 6) and adjacent
pit feature with historic artifacts (Feature 9), were located (Perttula et al. 2005). Much
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. 539

Chapter 15

larger quantities of artifacts per
excavated volume were recovered
on this knoll than anywhere else
at the site. Although no additional
investigations took place on the
northern knoll during the data
recovery work, the excavations
on the southern knoll uncovered
additional historic-period artifacts
that appear linked with those from
the northern knoll.
The excavation of Unit 8 uncovered
two features, Features 6 and 9.
Feature 6 was a chimney fall,
apparently from a domestic structure,
and consisted of large unmodified
slabs and pieces of sandstone and
ferruginous sandstone (Perttula et
al. 2005:35â38). The top of the
rock pile was barely exposed at the
ground surface, and the base of the
chimney was uncovered at 33 cm bs
(Figure 15-1). The sandstone slabs
extended beyond the excavated area
of Unit 8, and the size of the feature
was not determined. Artifacts found
with this feature included window
glass, bottle glass, wire nails, and
tin can fragments. Feature 9 was
also exposed in Unit 8 adjacent to
(or perhaps within) the chimney
fall, and consisted of a pit feature
containing ashy, yellowish brown fine
sandy loam as well as sandstone
fragments, charcoal flecks, burned
clay, window glass, wire nails, and
clear bottle glass (Figure 15-2). This
pit extended to a depth of 64 cm bs.

scatter, were also analyzed and included in the discussion.

percent of the total; Figure
15-3). Subsequent observations were made of each material type that were appropriate
to that material, such as the kind of metal (iron, zinc, brass, etc.) or the color of glass
(clear, amethyst, brown, etc.). The specific observations for each material type are defined
below. The overall intent of this historic artifact analysis was to determine as accurately
as possible the period in which these artifacts were manufactured and used, to support
or refute the archival evidence discussed below that the site was primarily used as a
farmstead, and to assess how much, if any, the historic-period occupation impacted the
preserved prehistoric deposits.

Metal
During the analysis, metal artifacts were additionally classified into the kind of metal (if
that could be determined), the type of item (nail, cartridge case, crown cap, etc.), or, if
indeterminate, the basic form (sheet, bar, wire, etc.), and finally any specific observations
about the artifact. As the distinction between iron and steel can be difficult to determine
with rusting and degrading metals, if the object was known to be ferrous but no other

Nails were by far the most abundant metal artifact
found in the historic assemblage at the Kitchen
Branch site, comprising 61.8 percent (n=189) of
the total number of metal artifacts (Figure 15-4).
All were ferrous and categorized as iron/steel.
They are first classified by type of manufacture;
being either machine-made cut nails or machinemade wire nails. The nails were also analyzed for
attributes which would indicate a hand forged nail,
although this nail type was not expected in this
assemblage. Indeed, none were found. In addition,
the nails were also lumped into general categories
of function, which included âcommon,â âfinish,â
âbrad,â âtack,â and âfragment.â These terms
conform to the current vernacular definitions of nail
types, with the size of the shank and head as well

distinction could be made, the category iron/steel
was used. Non-ferrous metals were identified to the
extent possible, but some artifacts appeared to be
an alloy that exhibited attributes of two (or more)
different types of metal. In these cases the most
prevalent metal type was determined. The types
of artifacts observed and recorded in the historic

from excavations at the Kitchen Branch site.

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

Common nails have a head that is two to three times bigger than the shank and are the
most versatile type of nail; they are used primarily in wood frame construction. Finish
nails are smaller, have a head only slightly larger than the shank, and are designed to
be countersunk for a smooth finish. These nails are often used for trim work. Brads are
similar to finish nails, but smaller, and are used for more delicate work. Alternatively, tacks
have a much larger head in relation to the shank, and are generally small. The last metric
recorded in the nail analysis was the total length of complete specimen. The âpenny sizeâ
classification was not used in this analysis due to its controversial definition and limited
historical value (Wells 1998:88).
Twenty-four machine-made cut nails were found in the historic artifact assemblage, most
of which were found mixed with other later-age artifact types, including machine-made
wire nails (Figure 15.3b). Only nine were complete and could be measured for length.
The remaining examples were fragments, many with just the head removed. One of these
fragments was a possible brad cut nail, based on its size. Of the nine complete cut nails,
seven were of the common type, varying in length from 2 to 3Â½ inches. Two complete
finish nails were also recorded, both 1Â½ inches in length.
In contrast, 165 machine-made wire nails were collected and recorded in the historic
artifact assemblage. Most of the fragments were complete. Of the complete nails, 112
were of the common type, ranging in length from 2â6 inches (nine were more like spikes
as their length exceeded 4 inches). Three of these nails, each 1.75 inches in length, also
included a non-ferrous (either zinc or lead alloy) metal grommet attached to the head
of the nail. This addition adds support for the head and more holding power. Also in the
assemblage, 30 finish nails were recorded, ranging in size from 1Â¼ to 1Â½ inches in length.
Finally, one tack, Â¾ inch long, was also observed and recorded.
Machine-made cut nails have been in production in America since the late eighteenth
to early nineteenth century, and were gradually replaced by machine-made wire nails.
Although first seen as early as the 1820s, production of wire nails did not really take
off until the 1880s. However, since it took some time for the inventory of cut nails to be
replaced across the country, some archeologists studying Western sites use ca. 1890â
1900 for the introduction of wire nails to historic artifact assemblages (Adams 2002;
Wells 1998). Indeed, about 17 percent of the entire American nail production were cut
nails in 1900 and that number did not decrease to below five percent until 1916 (Adams
2002). Cut nails are still the preferred choice for attaching wood to concrete, and can be
seen in small quantities today. For general construction, however, wire nails dominated
the market around the turn of the twentieth century, based on a nail inventory of historic
archeological sites from Texas and other Western states (Adams 2002; Davidson 2000).
Cut nails did not entirely disappear from these assemblages, but they were found in much
smaller quantities.
Other Construction Related Artifacts
A small number of other types of construction related artifacts were also recorded in the
historic artifact assemblage (Figure 15-5). These artifacts include two large iron/steel screw

bolts: one exhibited a sheared-off
head and was attached to a square
nut with a round flange; and the
other was a 4.5-inch long bolt with a
square head. In addition, a ferrous
âzâ-shaped bracket with a nail
attached to one end was observed,
as well as a large tack-like artifact
with a head made of two pieces of
sheet metal; a square nut 9/16th
inches in diameter; a triangular
strap hinge with attached nail; a
large brass grommet 1â inches in
diameter that may have been part
of a tarp; a steel âoâ ring Â¾ inch in
diameter; two small iron/steel caps
â inch in diameter; a âDâ shaped
tie-down made of twisted wire; and
two small wire hooks. The only tool
recovered from the assemblage
was a portion of a steel file with
the handle missing. The remaining
identifiable construction related
artifacts were two ferrous wire
staples like those seen attaching
barbed wire to wooden posts.

were recovered, but three different
types of gun are represented. The
smallest example found was one
.22 caliber rimfire cartridge case, with a rimmed base, straight sides, and no markings or
headstamp. No other information could be located on this case.
One shotgun shell casing was present with a headstamp that reads âRemington UMC No.
12 New Clubâ with a star in the center. This type of shotgun shell was manufactured by
Remington Arms Company between 1911-1934, when it was combined with Union Metallic
Cartridge Company (U.M.C.). In 1933 (or 1934, depending on the source), Remington was
bought by E. I. DuPont de Nemours & Co., Inc. (DuPont). The headstamp on cartridges

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

changed quickly with the merger between U.M.C. and Remington, but some evidence
suggests that the headstamps did not change with the DuPont buyout until the 1940s
(Barnes 2006; Remington Arms Company 2012; Seinhauer 2012).
There was one Smith and Wesson .38 caliber centerfire pistol cartridge case with a rimmed
base, straight sides, and measuring about 19.1 mm in length. The headstamp reads âU.S.
38 S. & W.â
Lastly, two rifle cartridge cases with the headstamp âW.R.A. Co. 38 W.C.F.â were recorded,
which appears to date from 1874â1937 (Ashmore 2010; Barnes 2006). This .38 caliber
cartridge case was manufactured by the Winchester Repeating Arms Co. and exhibits a
centerfire mechanism, rimmed base, straight sides, and measures 33.0 mm in length.
Only one bullet was in the historic artifact assemblage. It was fired and very distorted. The
amount of lead indicated a caliber closer to a .38 than a .22, but this cannot be confirmed
by any measurements.
Domestic Items
This is a broad category used to include items that would be used in food preparation and
storage, garments, or other personal items (Figure 15-7). This includes one stud button
made of iron or steel, as in the type usually seen on denim garments, with a thin brass
covering containing a wreath and star design on the surface of the button. Additionally, a
small ferrous rivet like those used on denim was also recovered. The metal portion of a
corkscrew was also recovered, consisting of the screw end and ring that attached to the
now missing wooden handle. The artifact measures about three inches in length. Four
crown caps were recovered, but
unfortunately all were heavily
corroded and did not retain any
markings on the surface. One of
these did exhibit a small triangularshaped wedge cut from the cap.
About 55 small pieces of thin iron/
steel sheet metal were found in
the assemblage that are possible
tin-coated steel can fragments,
although most of the pieces were
too small and corroded to make a
positive identification. An additional
three tiny (> 1 cm) fragments may
also be from tin-coated steel cans.
The thickness of these items is
appropriate for this artifact type,
but only two of these exhibited any
evidence of crimped seams, one of
which may be from a lid or base.

Finally, there was one iron/steel fragment comprised of two pieces of sheet metal held
together with a folded seam. The diameter of the fragment is too large for a typical tincoated steel can, and it may be from a bucket rim or similar item.
Machinery Parts
One artifact in from the historic artifact assemblage was clearly identifiable as a machine
part, while other artifacts may be attributable to machinery due to their size and weight
(Figure 15-8). A spark plug was recovered, without the ceramic insulator, that contained
a side electrode that was a round wire instead of a flat bar. In addition, a small iron/steel
cylinder or collar, a contoured ferrous metal place with two square holes on each end
and a snapped center section, and another large iron/
steel plate with a thick rim may have also been parts of
larger (possibly farm) machinery.
Miscellaneous
Finally, several metal artifacts could be identified only
in very general terms, as either wire, sheet, cylinders,
discs, or lumps, with no other distinguishing attributes.
Many were very corroded or small. Twenty-four artifacts
(7.8 percent) comprise this category. Most were ferrous,
but the assemblage contained one copper or brass
fragment, two pieces of lead, and one melted zinc alloy
fragment.

Glass
The analysis of glass artifacts from the testing and data
recovery excavations began with a determination of the
form the glass took (bottle, window, vessel, unknown,
Figure 15-8. Spark plug recovered
etc.), followed by the glass color (Figures 15-9â15from the Kitchen Branch site
10). If the artifact was a bottle fragment, then the
(Unit 7, 10-20 cm bs)
portion of the bottle represented by the fragment was
identified, any seams on the fragment were noted, and
any additional attributes were observed and recorded (Table 15-2). Most of the bottle
fragments were quite small and no complete bottles were present, but some bottle
fragments were substantial enough to hint at their possible completed form. If this was the
case, that information was also recorded. Only one bottle base contained a makerâs mark,
and only a few bottle fragments contained any sort of embossing that would indicate their
original purpose or date of manufacture. If the glass artifact was sheet (window) glass, its
thickness was recorded to 0.1 mm. If the glass fragment was of an indeterminate form,
any distinguishing characteristics were noted.

Archeology (SHA) and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM; http://www.sha.org/
bottle/; referenced as Lindsey 2012). This electronic resource is unparalleled in its wealth
of information on utilitarian and commonly found historic bottles, with numerous images
from the BLMâs extensive type collection. The analysis followed much of the websiteâs
recommendations on terminology, color identification, mold seam identification, and bottle
types. Other published source material was utilized as necessary, particularly for unusual
items.
A synopsis of the bottle assemblage is presented in Table 15-3. Far more body shards
(including some neck fragments) were encountered than base or finish (which constitutes
the top enclosure) fragments. In terms of dating the bottles in the glass assemblage,
bases and finishes generally have more markers that would aid in determining the type
of manufacture (and thus the date), and certain colors have temporal ranges associated
with them as well. Thus, the discussion below will focus on those attributes that can aid
in determining the type and dates of manufacture: mold seams and finish types, makerâs
marks, color, and the possible completed form.
Mold Seams and Finish Types
The archival evidence (see below) suggests the dates of historic occupation at the site
post-dated the late nineteenth century, thus it was anticipated that the bottle fragments in
the assemblage were all mold-made rather than hand blown. Indeed, several mold seams
were observed on glass bottle fragments, including shards from bottle bases, bodies, and
finishes. No evidence of a true freehand blown glass fragment was found. The discussion
below begins with base mold seams, followed by side mold seams, and finally finish (lip)
mold seams and finish types.
Of the bottle fragments that contained identifiable base mold seams, they were all of a
similar type (n=24). Cup bottom mold seams run around the base of the bottle just above
the heel, and join the side mold seams at that point. These types of molds were prevalent
in the mouth-blown glass industry from the late 1880s to the 1910s, and continued
being used in semi-automatic bottling machines as well as later fully automatic bottling
machines to the present day (Lindsey 2012). The colors of these bases included amber,
amethyst, aqua tint, brown, and clear. In addition to the cup bottom mold seam, one of the
brown base fragments also exhibited a possible feathered suction scar typically seen on
bottles made on the Owens semi-automatic or automatic bottling machine, which would
date the bottle from 1905 to the mid/late twentieth century (Lindsey 2012). The other
base fragments that were large enough to expect evidence of base seams or valve marks
did not show any signs of such marks (n=4). This indicates that the bottles were either
hand blown into a cup mold or were manufactured on a semi-automatic or fully automatic
non-Owens machine. This would date these fragments from the late 1880s to the mid/late
twentieth century (Lindsey 2012).
If a bottle fragment contains just a side mold seam, it is much more difficult to determine
the type of mold used to make the bottle, as well as the date of manufacture. The only
diagnostic characteristic exclusive to a side mold seam is its thickness, which tends to get

thinner with increased modernization of the bottle making machines. Most bottles made
today exhibit a hair-thin seam, while bottles of the early twentieth century have much larger
seams (Lindsey 2012). The vast majority of the side mold seams seen in the assemblage
did exhibit the wider seams of the early-to-mid twentieth century, but this evidence alone
is not enough to definitively date these fragments.
Finish mold seams and the methods used to finish a bottle are perhaps the most definitive
in determining the type and date of bottle manufacture, with the exception of a makerâs
mark on the bottle base. In addition, finish bottle fragments contain evidence of the type
or style of finish that may help in dating the bottle fragment. However, only nine bottle
fragments were encountered in the assemblage that were from the finish portion of the
bottle. Most were small and fragmented. However, some diagnostic characteristics that
could be obtained from the fragments are described below.
Three brown finish fragments all exhibited a strong thick bumpy ridge on the interior of
the bottle, as well as a fainter indentation seam around the exterior of the bottle rim. One
fragment exhibited a short flare finish, which is a very small straight to slightly flared lip
with no neck; the finish transitions to the body at a sharp angle. Typically, snuff bottles
exhibit this type of finish. The other two brown fragments had their final flare finishes
broken off but exhibited the same ridge and seams. No vertical side seams were seen on
any of the fragments. It is possible that these seams were made with a finishing tool on
an applied finish (as evidenced by the ridge on the interior), but it is also possible that the
sharp (almost 90 degrees) angle and short straight lip produced the same features while a
lipping tool was being used. If the bottle finish was applied, the date of manufacture spans
about 1830 to the mid-1870s or 1880s. At that point the transition to a tooled finish using
a lipping tool (with no additional glass added to the lip) was underway, and this method
continued until the development of automatic bottling machines. The tooled finish finally
phased out around 1920 (Lindsey 2012; Toulouse 1971). Similarly, the short flare finish
was common in the nineteenth and early twentieth century to about 1920 (Lindsey 2012).
Another brown finish fragment with a finish very similar to those above was present in the
assemblage. This fragmentâs finish was short with no neck, but the flare was replaced with
a small bead on the lip. It was also larger, and the bottle appeared to have a round finish
that transitioned to a square shaped body. A side mold seam was observed to extend
through the rim, indicating a machine made bottle, as well as a mold seam around the
base of the finish. No ridges were observed on the interior of the bottle, which was smooth.
This specimen is likely a automatic machine made snuff bottle, that would date from ca.
1905 to the 1920s (Lindsey 2012).
Two amber bottle fragments also appear to have a short flare finish, typical of a snuff
bottle. However, the fragments lacked a thick bumpy ridge on the interior, which was
smooth, and the exterior seam was very faint and the lip itself was not well formed. These
markers indicate a strong possibility that the finish was formed using a lipping tool. These
factors together indicate the bottle fragment was manufactured between the 1870s and
the 1920s (Lindsey 2012).

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

One aqua bottle fragment had an applied finish of the brandy/wine type, which consisted
of a narrow opening with a slightly tapering lip and ring directly underneath. This common
type of enclosure was present on liquor bottles, large druggist bottles, and some others. No
side mold seams were observed on the fragment. The brandy/wine type of finish could be
either applied or tooled (or even machine made), and was common from the 1860s to the
1920s, when external threads became more dominant. As this example exhibited a ridge
of glass on the interior of the bottle and a slight globule of excess glass on the outside,
the finish was most likely applied and a finishing tool was used. Together these markers
indicate a manufacture date range between the 1860s and 1880s (Lindsey 2012).
A clear bottle finish was observed in the assemblage that exhibited traits of the brandy/
wine type of enclosure, but was machine made. A side mold seam was seen extended
through the finish. Diagnostically, this fragment likely dates from the beginning of the
automatic bottling age, ca. 1905, to the 1920s or 1930s, when prohibition was in full
effect (Lindsey 2012). Once the law was repealed, this type of enclosure was replaced with
a small mouth external thread (screw cap).
Finally, a very small triangular fragment of a clear, machine made, small mouth external
thread finish was encountered in the assemblage. A small mold seam was present on the
top of the rim but unfortunately, no other diagnostic characteristics were observed. A few
enclosures of this type were hand blown into molds, but the precision of the automatic
bottling machines and the development of plastic screw caps truly enabled this type of
enclosure to dominate the bottle market by about 1930 and it continues to be used today
(Bender 1986; Lief 1965; Lindsey 2012).
Makerâs Marks
Only one bottle fragment contained a clear makerâs
mark (Figure 15-11). This mark is the letter âIâ within
an elongated diamond, indicative of the Illinois Glass
Company, in Alton, Illinois (1873â1929). This mark was
used from around 1915 to 1929. The automatic bottling
machines were installed at Illinois Glass around 1910,
but the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office data indicates the
trademark was not used until 1915. Typically, this mark
is seen on machine-made bottles that exhibit the typical
Owens machine suction scars on the base. Illinois Glass
was a very large factory and merged with several others
during its history (Toulouse 1971; Whitten 2012).
Color

As shown in Table 15-2, several different colors were
recorded in the historic bottle assemblage, including
amber, amethyst, aqua, aqua tint, black amber, blue,
brown, clear, milk glass, and olive green. Aqua is a dark, aquamarine color that was
intentionally sought by the bottle manufacturer, and aqua tint refers to the natural shade
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. 551

Chapter 15

of unmodified glass. Some of these colors have more concrete diagnostic properties
than others. Clear glass was in use from the 1870s to today, and amber and brown have
little diagnostic utility due to their extensive use throughout time. Aqua colored glass was
generally replaced by clear glass in the 1920s, but aqua soda containers can still be
seen today. Blue glass containers are also seen in the present day, but they were most
popular from the 1840s to the 1930s for soda/mineral water bottles and ink bottles. Milk
glass was popular from the 1870s to the mid-twentieth century. Olive green bottles were
common in the nineteenth century but rare in the twentieth, with the notable exception of
wine bottles (Lindsey 2012).
Amethyst tinted glass has long been used as a diagnostic tool for archeologists in dating
historic period sites. A total of 39 amethyst tinted glass fragments were observed in the
historic artifact assemblage (6.5 percent). Historically, both bottle glass and window
glass has been produced in shades of aqua, the degree of which was dependent on the
amount of natural impurities (particularly iron) in the sand that was used to make the
glass (Lockhart 2006; Lindsey 2012). As the desire for clear glass was introduced in the
nineteenth century, an inexpensive method for âscrubbingâ or âde-colorizingâ the aqua
glass was to add manganese to the sand mixture to counterbalance the green. Over time,
the manganese would react to the ultraviolet rays in sunshine and turn a light purple, or
amethyst color. Bottle glass that included manganese generally appeared in the 1870s
and was widely available in the 1890s, and the practice was discontinued around 1920,
although some manufacturers continued to use it to the 1930s (Lockhart 2006). Although
World War I is generally used as a benchmark for the transition from manganese to selenium
or other agents as de-colorizers, it is more likely due to the manufacturing change from
hand blown bottles to machine made ones (Lockhart 2006).
Another diagnostic glass color is black. Generally black glass appears black in reflected
light but either olive-tinged or olive amber-tinged when held in direct sunlight or in front of a
lamp. Black glass was popular in the nineteenth century but generally disappeared around
the 1880s (Wilson and Wilson 1968). The three bottle base fragments in the assemblage
are more amber in direct light and appear to come from the same bottle. The fragments
represent the center base only, and no mold seams were observed on any fragment. The
fragments were relatively flat, so the bottle did not have a âpush-upâ as in a wine bottle.
Each fragment has all or part of a raised bump on the bottom surface, which indicates a
mold made bottle, but the center does not exhibit any clear evidence of what type of mold
or if it was hand blown or machine made. There are several concentric swirls around the
center base, with a faint hint at a mold seam within these swirls. Although black glass was
generally not used in the bottle industry after 1880, some of the more specialty bottles,
such as a few soda or sparkling water bottles and champagne beer bottles, were packaged
in black amber glass. If so, the bottle fragments could date from the early-to-mid twentieth
century (Lindsey 2012).
Completed Form
As much of the historic bottle artifact assemblage was quite fragmentary, only hints of final
bottle forms could be determined. However, as shown above, some fragments, particularly

bottle finishes, could be used. In addition, several body and base shards had shapes
that indicated a rectangular or square form, along with a color that was suggestive of a
particular type of bottle. Suggestive bottle types include tall square spirits or bitters bottles,
snuff bottles (see above), champagne style beer bottles (see above), rectangular druggist
bottles, oval medicine bottles, wine bottles (see above), and modern beer bottles (including
at least the Anheuser Busch bottle type as four body fragments have the embossed eagle
logo).
One type of bottle appeared much more frequently than the rest in this assemblage, a
horizontal ribbed condiment sauce bottle. Due to the distinctive ribs or rings along the body
of this bottle type, even the smallest fragments were identifiable. Twenty-two fragments
are of this type, four of which were aqua-tinted and the remainder were clear glass. Two
base fragments were identified, as both had cup-bottom mold seams. This bottle style was
very common from the 1870s well into the twentieth century for many different types of
sauces (Lindsey 2012).
Finally, one fragment of a milk glass liner for a fruit jar was observed. The development of
the milk glass insert for zinc screw lids on wide mouthed fruit jars is attributed to Lewis
R. Boyd, who patented the invention in 1869. The purpose of the insert was to eliminate
the âmetallicâ taste that could be imparted to the food from the lid. His company, the
Consolidated Fruit Jar Company, set up a small furnace to make the inserts that same
year (Toulouse 1971). Shortly thereafter, a great number of glass manufacturers made the
ubiquitous clear Mason jar with a milk glass insert and zinc lid between 1869 and 1910
(Hinson 1996). The Consolidated Fruit Jar Company discontinued making these liners by
about 1910 (Toulouse 1971). Milk glass liners were eventually replaced by the Economy
and Self Sealing jars in the early twentieth century, which had a permanent composition
gasket attached to the metal lid (first patented in 1903). Indeed, a direct competitor to
the milk glass liner/zinc lid was developed in 1915 as a flat metal disc with an attached
composition gasket sealed with a metal threaded ring (Hinson 1996). These easy-to-use
lids could be used on existing jars, and the traditional liners fell out of favor. However, as
the fruit jars, lids, and liners were meant to be reusable, it is unclear how long such items
remained in the average household before being replaced.
Window Glass
Fifty-four pieces of window glass were found and collected during the excavations at the
Kitchen Branch site, 35 (65 percent) of which were from Test Unit 8 (see Figure 15-10).
The majority of the fragments were aqua tinted, with only two exhibiting no perceivable
tint to the clear glass. Window glass thickness has been observed to change over time as
flat glass making has become more refined, and several formulas have been developed
to ascribe dates to these thicknesses (Chance and Chance 1976; Moir 1987; Roenke
1978). In this assemblage, the smallest thickness measured was 1.7 mm, the largest 2.5
mm, and the mean was 2.2 mm. Using the formula developed by Moir (1987), i.e. glass
manufacture date = 84.22 x (glass thickness in mm) + 1712.7, the earliest date would
be 1856, the latest date would be 1923, and the mean would be 1898. However, if the
tightest cluster of thicknesses are isolated from the total assemblage (2.2-2.4 mm, which
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. 553

Chapter 15

constitutes over 50 percent of the total window glass assemblage), the mean date would
be about 1898â1906. This information may or may not represent actual construction
dates for any buildings, but it does provide a reliable range of possible construction and
occupation.
Vessel Glass
Two fragments of decorative glass bowls or dishes were recovered from the excavations.
Both are rims, and both exhibit the same vertical ribbed pattern along the edge of the
rim, similar to a beaded rim but slightly elongated. One fragment is clear and the other
amethyst; there is no indication that these pieces are from the same vessel. The amethyst
glass fragment points to an 1880â1920 manufacture date.
Miscellaneous
One small, four-hole, sew-through milk glass button is present in the historic artifact
assemblage. The specimen would likely have been used on a shirt or dress. While milk
glass buttons were first manufactured by the mid-1800s and their use continues into the
modern day, Marcel (1994) suggests that their popularity peaked between 1840 and
1940. The other miscellaneous glass fragments from the assemblage included small
pieces with rounded edges and corners, as if they were continuously water-washed over a
period of time (n=16), two pieces of molded glass with thin horizontal stripes on one side,
and glass chips or pitted fragments. One molded semicircular blob was also recorded; it
was generally unidentifiable, but may be part of a closure. These fragments were either
amber, amethyst, aqua tint, brown, clear, or milk glass.

Ceramics
The laboratory analysis of historic-period ceramic artifacts from the test and data recovery
excavations at the Kitchen Branch site began with the identification of the artifact as a brick
fragment or a vessel fragment (Figures 15-12â15-14). Brick fragments were investigated
for any markings, and the vessel fragments were identified by type of paste and glaze, the
form (if possible), and any decorations (Table 15-4).
Vessels
The assemblage of ceramic vessel sherds collected is relatively small (n=34). As this
collection is so small and there has been some criticism as to the difficulties in ceramic
classification systems used by archeologists, as well as the lack of research for twentieth
century ceramics (see Majewski and OâBrien 1987), the ceramic analysis used a very
general classification with broad diagnostic implications. Unfortunately, no makerâs marks
were located on any of the sherds, preventing clear dates of manufacture, although some
sherds could be identified to vessel type.

Five ironstone sherds were in the assemblage, only one of which was decorated (see Table
15-4). Plain teacup rim, base, and body fragments were recorded, as well as a undecorated
small plate rim. The decorated sherd appeared to be a plate rim with a molded swirl feather
pattern and wavy edge. Ironstone first appeared in the early nineteenth century but did not
become popular until the 1840s. Molded geometric, foliate, and floral designs became
prevalent in the mid nineteenth century, but fell out of fashion in the late 1800s, when
more abstract designs appeared (IMACS 1992; Majewski and OâBrien 1987).
Of the 13 stoneware sherds, three exhibited a medium brown salt glaze on the exterior of
the sherd and a dark brown albany slip on the interior, and one was coated in a classic
white salt glaze on the exterior and dark brown albany slip on the interior. The salt glazes
had speckled âorange peelâ surfaces, and the albany slip appeared smooth and opaque,
with a slight shine. Four stoneware sherds were covered with dark brown albany slip on

both the interior and exterior surfaces, and five were covered with an albany slip only on
the interior. The only large sherd found in the assemblage was a body sherd from a large
crock or jug. This fits with the typical utilitarian forms of American stoneware. Albany slip
appeared after the late nineteenth and early twentieth century and continues to be used
today on stone wares(Lebo 1987; Greer 1981; IMACS 1992).
Bricks
Nine brick fragments were collected during the excavation; all of them were small pieces
with no markings, although considered to be made pre-1900 (see Figure 15-14a). Five
fragments were cream colored, one pink, and one was colored red. Two final fragments
were burned to an unrecognizable color. The paste of each fragment appeared to be soft
and of low quality, but no other distinguishing characteristics were noted. With such soft
paste, these are likely pre-1900 hand-made bricks.

Synthetic
Ten pieces of plastic were recovered from the Kitchen Branch Site excavations, all of a
general, miscellaneous category (Figure
15-15) including one peach-colored
bead, two molded two hole sew-through
shirt/dress buttons, one screw cap, and
six pieces of unidentifiable fragments.

From the recovered artifact assemblage
(nail varieties, bottle glass shards,
ceramics), it is evident that the historic
components of the Kitchen Branch site are likely related to the propertyâs use during the
late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (primarily the latter). With primarily absentee
land ownership through approximately 1910 (see below), and long periods of unavailable
title information, it is impossible to determine when the earliest occupants lived on the
Kitchen Branch site. Though the first clearly documented occupation indeed dates to
1910, a small component of the recovered historic-age artifacts suggest earlier occupants
may have lived and/or worked here in the nineteenth century as well.

Chapter 15

The history of ownership starts in 1840 when Aaron T. Castleberry patented the property
encompassing the Kitchen Branch site as part of a 2,302 acre grant (Table 15-5). Although
the field notes indicate that he completed the survey by 1840, the patent was not filed
until 1850 (Camp County Deed Records [CCDR] 1-263). Aaron T. Castleberry is not listed
in the 1850 or 1860 censuses for Camp County, or any of the surrounding counties. No
information about the name Castleberry was found in the New Handbook of Texas, or
through an online search. Consequently, it is not clear where Castleberry resided, although
it seems likely that he did not live on the land he patented in Camp County. He began
selling the land off during the 1850s. In 1855, Castleberry sold the portion of his patent
around Prairie Creek to Joseph Cushing and William Murdock. Neither man is listed in the
1860 census for Camp or surrounding counties and it is likely that they too were absentee
landowners. Chain of title records were not traceable from that point forward until the end
of the nineteenth century, though it is likely that the land was held by absentee landowners
for most, if not all of that time.
Sometime around the turn of the century J. Bailey acquired the property. Bailey was the
County Judge and the County Clerk, and Camp County deed indices show that he bought
and sold hundreds of properties in Camp County between 1890 and the 1915. He lived in
Pittsburg, Texas. In 1902, he sold 112 acres of the Castleberry patent to William Greeney
and his wife (CCDR V-92). The deed was not filed until 1910, when Greeney and his wife
sold the property to Joe Norman. Greeney purchased the property through a series of
promissory notes to Bailey, and evidently he was unable to pay the full amount. Joe Norman
took over Greeneyâs notes in 1910 (CCDR S-348). Neither Greeney nor his wife are listed
in any of the census records for Camp County, although other Greeneys are listed living
around Camp and Titus counties at the time. However, Joe Norman is listed in the 1920
census for the Pittsburg area as a 53 year old âmulattoâ male. He was married to Mattie,

63, who is listed as black. The 1920 census indicates that they owned their own land and
listed their profession as farming. Norman and his wife likely lived on the property where
the Kitchen Branch site is located.
In 1924, after Norman made several attempts to re-mortgage the property, the land fell
to B. F. Clements, who held the note on Normanâs mortgage (CCDR 12-475). Like Bailey,
Clements owned properties all over Camp County and this one was not his homestead.
Clements sold the land a year later to E. C. Givens (CCDR 18-81). Givens may have lived on
this property. When Givens sold the same parcel to Frank Ellis in 1933, the deed described
the land as âthe Givens Tract (CCDR 22-109).â As of 2007, members of the Ellis family
continued to own this parcel. However, no members of the Ellis family appeared to have
lived on this tract. Frank Ellis owned a hardware store in Pittsburg where in 1930 he resided
with his wide Addie May (age 48), his son Carlton Ellis (17), and Addie Mayâs mother, Lula
Bailey (69). When Ellis died in 1949, the probate record (Camp County Probate Record
No. 5851) indicates that he was still living in Pittsburg. It listed a number of real estate
holdings at the time, including a parcel still referred to as the âGibbons [sic] Tract.â
A series of structures are depicted just north of the prehistoric component of the site on the
1960 LaFayette USGS 7.5-minute topographical map (Figure 15-16). Aerial photographs
dating back as early as 1935 provide more detailed representation of the Kitchen Branch
siteâs historic components (Figures 15-17 through 15-18). The earliest photo available, a
1935 Tobin aerial (see Figure 15-17), shows the archeological investigation area situated
partially in open, cleared land (primarily the testing-phase Gradall trenching areas) and
partially along the

most importantly in the vicinity of Unit 8, which contained historic Features 6 and 9 (see
below).
In 1935, structures that are visible nearby include a structure near the road and several
outbuildings north of the excavation. With the structure represented as a solid square in
the 1960 USGS topographic quadrangle, the structure is likely a residence with the unfilled
squares surrounding being outbuildings. This northern occupational area corresponds
closest geographically to the early to mid-twentieth century site component encountered
in ST 17, 19, and 64). With the photo taken shortly after Frank Ellis purchased the property
from E.C. Givens it is difficult to determine who originally built those structures. Since
Givens likely lived on the land for the eight years he owned the property, he probably built
them. By 1957 (see Figure 15-18), Frank Ellis had added several small outbuildings in the
vicinity of the main barn and small fenced areas that were presumably used for livestock.
Again, no structures are visible in the vicinity of any of the excavation areas and the data
recovery block vicinity has become more overgrown in the 20 years since the Tobin aerial
(suggesting it was not intensively utilized in the twentieth century).
Aerial photographs add support to interpretations that there is an earlier and distinct, early
twentieth century component (that may date as early as the nineteenth century) near the
data recovery block, in STs 1, 6, 9-11, and in Gradall Trench 2004-9. No structures are
visible in these northern and southern knoll segments of the site and those areas are more
overgrown than the cleared lands to the north. The historic structural features recorded in
Unit 8 do not correspond with aerial imagery in 1935 or 1957, and this indicates an earlier
occupation is likely there. From census and deed records, the earlier occupation could be
attributed to Bill Greeney (1902-1910) or Joe Norman (1910-1924), both of whom appear
to have lived on the property. The small component of cut nails recovered from the site
could also relate to a tenant occupation from the late nineteenth century, though it should
be noted that cut nails were still used in rural areas into the first decades of the twentieth
century.

Discussion of Historic Components
Three shovel tests contained evidence of the northernmost and most recent historic
component of the Kitchen Branch site. ST 17 and 19 were excavated during the survey
phase, and ST 64 was dug during the testing phase. Survey phase artifacts included an
undecorated whiteware body sherd (ST 19, 0â20 cm bs), a brown glass snuff bottle base,
and a clear glass âKaro Syrupâ container shard (both from ST 17, 0â20 cm bs; Karo Syrup
was a company that was formed in 1902 and sold their products initially in metal cans
[Karo 2012]). ST 64 recovered four historic artifacts from 0â20 cm bs consisting of a
peach-colored plastic bead, a brown plastic fragment (torn from something larger), a clear
bottle body shard, and a clear bottle base shard with an Illinois Glass Company makerâs
mark. This artifact was manufactured between 1915 and 1929 (Toulouse 1971). No
features or evidence of any sort of occupation were found associated with these artifacts.
Given the depth at which the artifacts were recovered, dates of manufacture (ca. 1920s
and ca. 1950s to present), it is highly likely that they are secondary deposits from either
the earlier historic component to the south, and/or the roadway of FM 557. As such, they
562 AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

do not represent a cohesive historic age âcomponentâ at the Kitchen Branch site, but
rather a collection of random twentieth century artifacts.
The vast quantity of historic artifacts recovered from the Kitchen Branch site, however,
were recovered during the test excavations at the Kitchen Branch site and are associated
with an earlier nineteenth or twentieth century farmstead. This component appears to
have a more substantial presence on the northern knoll where the features are located
(indicating the location of a possible house). Artifacts on the southern knoll, primarily the
recovered nails, indicate another structure may have stood closer to the creek as well.

Use as a Farmstead
There is a prominent gap in the archival record for the 112-acre property on which the
Kitchen Branch site sits. With a gap in deed records of nearly 50 years, and a scattering
of potentially pre-1900 historic-age artifacts (such as the handmade brick fragments and
cut nails) the property was potentially occupied during the latter period of the nineteenth
century, possibly a tenant farmer leasing from J. Bailey. The Greeneys would purchase
the property from Bailey in 1902; but neither do they appear on any Camp County census
records, suggesting the possibility that they, too, were absentee landowners who leased
their land to tenant farmers. The Greeneys eventually (1910) did sell the land to Joe Norman
and his wife, Mattie, who are the first recorded owners to live on the property. The 1920
census indicates that they owned their own land and listed their profession as farming.
They retained the property for 14 years before losing it, when it was sold to E. C. Givens.
Givens owned the tract from 1925 to 1933 and probably also lived on the property. The
Ellis family, who bought the property from Givens, did not live there, but almost certainly
rented it to tenants. Standing structures can be seen north of 41CP220 as early as 1935
and as late as 1960.
The artifacts recovered and features documented from the investigations of this component
support its use as a farmstead throughout the early to mid-twentieth century with the
possibility that the land was occupied as early as the late nineteenth century. The chimney
fall on the northern knoll around Unit 8 was the only evidence found of structural remains
in the area; it may have been a small farmhouse or shack. The artifact assemblage from the
component was full of domestic items such as glass bottles, ceramic crockery, tin-coated
steel cans (likely), and buttons. Machinery parts and common construction materials (such
as the spark plug, nails, window glass, and brick fragments) were also recovered that could
easily have been used in a farm setting. Furthermore, with a complement of more than
500 individual historical artifacts on the siteâs southern knoll (just less than half of which
are nails), it is likely that an outbuilding stood in the main data recovery area at the site.

Distribution of Artifacts
Artifacts that appear to be part of the historic farmstead were recovered on the northern
knoll, the excavation block on the southern knoll, the western sector, and areas on the
southern knoll that were adjacent to, but outside of, the data recovery excavation block
(âelsewhere unitsâ). The artifacts that were recovered from these latter contexts included
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. 563

Chapter 15

those from Unit 26 from the testing investigations (to the west of the excavation block), the
general scrape areas, and BHT 2004-9. As seen in Figure 15-19, most historic artifacts
were recovered in the north part of the data recovery excavations, followed by the middle
and parts of the south block, northern knoll, âelsewhere,â and western sector. However,
the northern knoll and western sector show the greatest number of artifacts per m3
(Figure 15-20). (As the excavated volume could not be determined for the âelsewhereâ
artifacts, they were not included in this analysis.) All this suggests that the main house of
the pre-1935 farmstead was located on the northern knoll while the southern knoll and
prehistoric site once may have contained an ancillary structure like a barn.

Although the distribution and quantity of artifacts indicated the data recovery excavation
block was not the central location of the historic farmstead component, some additional
analysis of the block area was conducted to look for patterns in the artifact distributions.
The densities of metal, glass, and ceramic artifacts were gradient-mapped within the block
(Figure 15-21). The results show no areal or linear patterns in the densities of each type
of historic artifacts; in fact, the gradient patterns of each artifact type are all significantly
different throughout the block. If combined, the three types of artifacts also do not show
any significant patterns. However, the distribution of each type of artifact contains several
high-concentration peaks in different locations. Reviewing distribution contours within
the data recovery block provides little opportunity for discerning functional patterning of
the occupation in this area beyond a general decrease in density with distance toward
the south (away from the more intensively-occupied northern knoll). Localized peaks
in artifacts are likely (particularly with glass and ceramic items) are more likely clusters
of broken pieces of a smaller number of individual specimens rather than localities of
increased artifact deposition.

Dates of Occupation
With a limited archival record of occupation prior to 1902 and the recovery of only a
small number of possible pre-twentieth-century artifacts (such as machine-cut nails [pre1900]), one aqua brandy/wine bottle fragment [1860sâ1880s], and possible hand-made
brick fragments [pre- 1900]), it seems likely that first use of the site occurred late in the
nineteenth century as a tenant farm and continued as a farmstead through the twentieth
century. The original house and outbuildings were probably torn down and replaced
sometime in the early 1930s during or just after the period in which Givens owned the
land. This is supported by the 1935 actual photo showing structures north of the site. The
area around the main house looks to have been recently cleared of vegetation and this
may support a contemporaneous construction date.
This late nineteenth to ca. 1935 occupation is also supported by both the quantity and
variety of artifacts present in the farmstead assemblage. For example, the ceramics
recovered from the site were few in number and fell into only three very common categories,
ironstone, stoneware, and whiteware. Some of the sherds may have come from the same
vessel (particularly the stoneware and decorated whiteware), although they could not be
conjoined. The glass bottle assemblage showed a greater number and variety, but again
there were several instances where examples of a similar type (the horizontal ribbed
condiment bottles, the champagne bottles, etc.) may have come from the same bottle or
bottles. If the historic artifact scatter represents the discard of a relatively small number of
bottles, vessels, cans, etc., then the period of occupation was likely to have been at most
only a few decades long.

Discussion of Historic Artifact Impact on Prehistoric Component Studies
As part of the investigations of the prehistoric Caddo components of the Kitchen Branch
site, three geophysical analyses were conducted prior to the block excavation including

GPR, soil resistivity, and magnetometer (see Chapter 5). These studies were intended to
provide information on the subsurface character of the prehistoric component and possible
features. As discussed in Chapter 5, to coax traces of these subtle, prehistoric elements
from the surrounding sediments, geophysical data must be âcleanâ (uniform, median soil
conditions devoid of non-targeted debris and inclusions) to be enhanced. Unfortunately,
GPR and electrical resistance were adversely affected by moisture in the soil, and the
magnetometer survey was adversely affected by the presence of ferrous historic artifacts
in the soil (despite efforts to remove the debris with the help of metal detectors prior to
the geophysical survey). As can be seen in the discussion in Chapter 5 and Figure 5-7,
the magnetic data from the Kitchen Branch site near the main excavation block was still
extremely noisy due to the high concentrations of metal (ferrous) artifacts. A preliminary
analysis during fieldwork discussed an area of magnetic enhancement and two possible
Caddo structures, but, upon further interpretation subsequent to the data recovery
investigations the strong dipolar signatures in the magnetometer data are more likely the
results of metal debris present in the upper 20 centimeters (see Figure 5-7).
With that said, it is important to stress that the geophysical data did not contribute to
the interpretations of the prehistoric use of the site or the features identified therein.
Indeed, although the early geophysical data did provide a preliminary estimate of where
features were likely to be found as excavations progressed, the excavation data from the
test excavations was more productive in this regard; in any case, each unit within the data
recovery block was excavated fully regardless of those interpretations. Units were not
excavated in greater (or lesser) detail and/or scrutiny based upon the geophysical findings.
All data from units (observations, identified features, etc.) were based entirely on on-theground interpretation and verification (see Chapter 6). In fact, the excavation block itself
was laid out based upon the data from testing excavations and not from the geophysical
data. Magnetometer data does, however, assist with interpreting the character of the
historic component at the Kitchen Branch site. As can be seen in Figure 5-7, the highest
concentration of dipoles (ferrous items, primarily nails) are found in the northern portion
of the block, particularly toward its western side. This area may be where a structure (a
small shed or outbuilding) once stood. As described previously, dense trees on aerial
photographs of this specific location make it impossible to confirm this hypothesis.
With nearly 900 individual non-prehistoric artifacts recovered from the data recovery
block area, it is clear that the historic component of the Kitchen Branch site was not an
insignificant one. How much, however, did that later occupation impact the prehistoric
components, particularly the distribution and depth of prehistoric artifacts? As can be
seen in Figure 15-22, there is a difference between historic and prehistoric artifact vertical
distribution trends. Historic artifacts (depicted as a red line) peak at between 0â20-cm bs
level at 646 items, then drop nearly 60 percent in the next 10 centimeters then drop
further to less than 20 items for the remaining vertical increments. This suggests that
historic artifacts were discarded onto a surface that roughly corresponds to the modern
one (0â20 cm bs) with artifacts migrating downward through various natural and artificial
action over time.

AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. 567

Chapter 15

The distributional trend of prehistoric materials (depicted as green and yellow linesâ
respectively), on the other hand, does not follow the same pattern (Figure 15-22). Sherds
and lithic debris peak between 20â40 cm bs. At the same time, the top elevation of recorded
features (blue bars) are in the 30â40-cm bs increment. This apparent prehistoric Caddo
living surface between 30â40 cm bs is at least 10â20 cm below the historic occupation.
Such a separation is large enough to suggest that each surface is more-or-less distinct
and unaltered by the other, such that there is no adverse impact on the prehistoric site
remains resulting from the historic materials other than its effect on the geophysical data.

Summary and Conclusions
Timothy K. Perttula

Summary
This report concerns the archeological findings from investigations conducted at the
Kitchen Branch (41CP220), Keering (41CP21), and B. J. Horton (41CP20) sites in the Big
Cypress Creek basin in Camp County, Texas. Under TxDOT sponsorship, test excavations
were completed at the Kitchen Branch site in 2004â2005, followed up by data recovery
investigations in 2007. Archeological work at the Keering site was done by the Texas
Department of Highways and Public Transportation (now TxDOT) in the summer of 1974,
while the B. J. Horton archeological findings are a product of Caddo Indian burial discoveries
in the late 1950s and late 1960s in a TxDOT borrow area used for construction of the US
271 bridge over Big Cypress Creek. Photographs of three ceramic vessels found with at
least one of the burials excavated in the 1960s at the B. J. Horton site were in the TxDOT
files, and the study of these photographs were the primary focus of our investigations of
this site.

Kitchen Branch Site
The Kitchen Branch site was the scene of extensive hand excavations on two different
occasions, first by Coastal Environments, Inc. and Archeological & Environmental
Consultants, LLC in test excavations that evaluated the siteâs research significance, and
then by Hicks & Company Environmental, Archeological, and Planning Consultants, Inc.,
and Archeological & Environmental Consultants, LLC, to complete data recovery work to
mitigate the effects of planned replacement on this significant site of a bridge over Prairie
Creek along FM 557. Although the Kitchen Branch site was known to be a multi-component
prehistoric siteâwith archeological materials ranging from Late Paleoindian, Middle-Late
Archaic, Woodland, pre-AD 1300 Caddo, Late Caddo period, Titus phase, and historic (late
nineteenth-early twentieth century) siteâthe data recovery investigations focused on the
15th century Titus phase component on the southern knoll overlooking the Prairie Creek
floodplain. The research focus on this component was predicated on the fact that the
artifact assemblage, identified features, and the first set of radiocarbon dates on charred
organic remains in features all pertained to this Titus phase component, which was well
preserved. The hand excavations took the form of a large block of contiguous units on the
knoll (152 m2), followed by either hand or mechanical scraping of an additional 515 m2
surrounding the block (see Figure 5-1a-b).
The sandy sediments on the southern knoll presented challenges in the recognition
and definition of cultural features, primarily because of minimal differences in the color
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. 569

Chapter 16

of the various sandy loam zones comprising the archeological deposits as well as the
considerable thickness and depth (ca. 60â130 cmbs) of the sandy loam. Nevertheless, in
addition to the identification of a buried 5â20 cm thick anthropogenically-stained cultural
deposit (Zone 2C) on the crest of the knoll in the northern part of the block excavations
(see Figure 5-16), a total of 243 cultural features were defined in the block and scrape
areas; five other features were excavated during the test excavations (see Perttula et al.
2005). This included 197 post holes, 15 possible post holes, 30 pit featuresâincluding
21 pits less than 40 cm in diameter and nine pits greater than 40 cm in diameterâand
a single fire-cracked rock feature thought to be of Woodland or Late Archaic period age.
The contents of the features, as well as their spatial arrangement, suggest that the vast
majority of them can be associated with a Caddo Titus occupation, one that apparently
took place in the early to late 15th century AD based on calibrated radiocarbon dates and
some of the TL dates on decorated ceramic sherds.
Most of the post holes are from one apparently circular Titus phase, structure about 6.0 m
in diameter with a possible entrance (based on gaps in the post holes along the walls)
facing either to the east or the southwest. Several larger posts are thought to represent
roof and wall support posts within the structure itself. The number of post holes suggest
that the structure may have been rebuilt and/or that a number of the posts had to be
replaced. Many of the post hole features within the structure itself are likely attributed
to internal post structural features or furniture such as racks, screens, and benches. The
estimated floor area is 28 m2. Based on different estimates of the size of a household
population, a residential structure of this size was probably the home to a nuclear family
of four or five individuals.
There are also several possible ancillary structural features marked by post hole patterns
in the block. These include three roughly rectangular post hole patterns (measuring 2.0 x
2.5 m, 1.0 x 2.0 m, and 2.5 x 2.0 m) south of the house structure that may be evidence of
elevated work platforms or ramadas. There are also two other possible ancillary features
that are marked by single rows of a few post holes. These post hole rows are about 2â3
m in length, and may represent screens or racks in outdoor work areas. Lastly, there is a
circular concentration of post holes in the South block that is ca. 3 m in diameter, and is
marked by 11 post holes and two pit features. Their distance from the domestic structure,
and the small size of the post hole concentration, suggests that these post hole features
may mark an elevated or above-ground granary. This possible elevated granary feature is
ca. 5â10 m east and southeast of a concentration of large pit features that may have been
below-ground plant food storage features.
The very low density of ceramic sherds in the archeological deposits at the Kitchen Branch
site, and the accumulation of utility ware sherds (cf. Varien 1999; Varien and Ortman
2005), suggests that the area of the Kitchen Branch site investigated on this project may
have been occupied for a period of approximately 1.3â2.6 years, sometime between the
mid- to late 15th century AD. This short period of occupation seems consistent with the
fact that there appears to have been only one wood house structure built and occupied in
570 AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

this part of the site, with little evidence of structure rebuilding and/or post replacement
because of rotting, and such wood structures likely would have had at most a use-life of
between 10â20 years. The density of ceramic sherds across the block excavations at the
Kitchen Branch site is very low compared to many other Late Caddo domestic contexts in
East Texas, pointing to an overall low rate of vessel breakage and discard during the Titus
phase occupation. That in turn reflects the short span of time in which this part of the site
was occupied as well as its likely use intensity.
The work at the Kitchen Branch site has obtained a large sample of radiocarbon dates
(n=31) from various contexts in the archeological deposits. This includes the dating of
organic remains (maize and hickory nutshell as well as hickory wood charcoal) from
features (n=18), nutshell concentrations (n=2) from the deepest archeological deposits
(70â80 cmbs), and on the bulk organics in the paste of 11 ceramic sherds (none of the
latter from features). The calibrated radiocarbon dates have a wide temporal range, based
on summed probability distributions of radiocarbon group clusters calculated in version
4.1.7 of OxCal, from 3339â3008 BC to AD 1571â1631. This range of calibrated median
dates and their age ranges would seem to indicate that the Kitchen Branch site has been
episodically used by American Indian groups from at least as early as cal. 3339 BC (in
the Middle Archaic) to as late as the cal. early to mid-seventeenth century AD (in the Titus
phase).
The recovered temporally diagnostic dart points and arrow points from the site appear to
corroborate this long-term and episodic use, while the recovered ceramic artifacts appear
to pertain to the very latter periods of use. The range of dates from different materials
from features with Caddo ceramicsâespecially Late Caddo ceramic styles, and the range
of dates on bulk ceramic sherd pastes from sherds of clear post-AD 800 Caddo affiliation
as well as Late Caddo affiliationâsuggested that careful consideration of the calibrated
dates was in order in reconstructing the temporal relationships of features and associated
material culture remains from the Kitchen Branch site.
The generally acceptable calibrated median radiocarbon dates from the Kitchen Branch
site range from 3153 BC and 812 BC for Archaic material remains encountered in the
deeper part of the archeological deposits to ancestral Caddo features and sherds that
have median dates of AD 1435â1488 (dates on maize). These postdate (median AD
1287) the hickory nutshell and wood charcoal samples, which postdate (median AD 1265)
the ceramic sherd samples. The summed probability distribution groups represented by
more than three calibrated radiocarbon dates are AD 1347â1396 (n=5 dates, with age
ranges that extend from AD 1297â1435) and AD 1435â1488 groups (n=6 dates), with
age ranges that extend from AD 1396â1524 (based on the range of median calibrated
dates and overlapping age ranges). These two groups of calibrated dates represent the
most conservative approximation for the age range of the principal ancestral Caddo
component at the Kitchen Branch site, although the analysis of the stylistic elements on
the recovered ceramic sherds strongly suggests that the AD 1435â1488 age range for the
Titus phase occupation is most temporally consistent. The 20 TL dates have a wide range
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. 571

Chapter 16

from AD 350Â±60 to AD 1580Â±40. The median age of AD 1461Â±52 from one group of TL
dates seems to best approximate the age of the ceramics in this one ancestral Caddo
occupation at the site (Figure 16-1).
The analysis of the recovered ceramic vessel sherds (n=4,051) and pipe sherds (n=2)
from the Kitchen Branch site emphasized the acquisition of both technological/functional
and stylistic information on the character of the ancestral Caddo ceramic assemblage,
following the CTA ceramic protocol for East Texas (Perttula 2010). The assemblage, with
the exception of a few pre-AD 1300 decorated ceramic sherds, is the product of a mid- to
late 15th century Titus phase Caddo occupation. In addition to the detailed sherd analysis,
insights into the production and firing of Caddo ceramic vessels was also obtained from
the study of the sherds from eight experimental ceramic vessels made by Chase Earles, an
Oklahoma Caddo potter (see Chapter 10, this volume), following specific clay and temper
recipes.
The examination of ceramic sherd and vessel assemblages from a number of sites in
the Big Cypress Creek basin have identified the geo-spatially distinctive character of the
15th century AD ceramics found in the Prairie Creek valley, including both the Kitchen
Branch, Keering, and B. J. Horton sites. The ceramics from these Late Caddo sites in the
Big Cypress Creek basin are distinctive in stylistic terms, namely the choices made in the
decorations of utility wares and fine wares. As such, these differences and similarities
across the Big Cypress Creek basin mark the social boundaries between different but
related populations or cultural lineages that shared certain levels of cultural transmission.

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

A distinctive Prairie Creek ceramic tradition has been identified in the central part of the
Big Cypress Creek basin (see Figures 8.29aâb).
The Prairie Creek ceramic tradition represents a coherent community of technological and
stylistic practices specific to the Caddo peoples of this area at a particular time interval,
namely from ca. AD 1430 to AD 1680; the Kitchen Branch, Keering, and B. J. Horton
site ceramic assemblages represent different points within this broad temporal period.
The predominant and key practice of Caddo potters living in this part of the Big Cypress
Creek basin at that time was to make grog-tempered plain wares, utility wares, and fine
wares. Caddo potters in the region had discovered centuries earlier the advantages of
grog-tempered pastes (see Chapter 8) through trial and error, experience, and learned
cultural behaviors. Using local clays tempered primarily with grog, a wide variety of plain
ware, utility ware, and fine ware vessels were manufactured, including bottles, carinated
bowls, compound bowls, simple bowls, and jars, with different sizes, volumes, and uses.
A significant proportion of the wares in domestic contexts are from utility wares (46â52
percent of the sherd assemblages from the Keering and Kitchen Branch sites, respectively),
followed by plain wares (29â36 percent, including bowls, bottles, and jars), then fine wares
(18â19 percent).
There are clear decorative systems evident in the Late Caddo ceramic assemblages in the
Big Cypress Creek basin, of which the Prairie Creek ceramic tradition is a part, in that the
potters shared a uniform set of ideas about ceramic vessel decoration for both utility wares
and fine wares. Utility vessels were decorated on both the rim and body of jars, usually with
different wet paste decorative methods on the rim versus the body. Vessels with brushing
(either as the sole decorative method or in combination with other decorations) were
predominant in the Prairie Creek utility wares, especially as a form of body decoration,
along with vessels having simple geometric or straight lines/rows of punctated, appliqued,
or incised decorations usually repeated on the rim. Fine ware vessels were dominated by
a number of varieties of Ripley Engraved, especially on carinated bowls and compound
bowls, but no one variety was predominant. The Ripley Engraved motifs with iconographic
or ideational meanings that were best represented in the Prairie Creek Caddo sites include
those with slanting scrolls, circles, semi-circles, and continuous scrolls repeated four times
around the vessel, with hatched and cross-hatched scroll dividers and brackets in scroll fill
zones. Other resident engraved types included varieties of Turner Engraved with distinctive
upper and lower panel motifs on compound bowls, as well as bottles of Ripley Engraved,
Wilder Engraved, and Johns Engraved styles.
As part of the analysis of the Caddo ceramic assemblage from the Kitchen Branch and
Keering sites, a small sample of sherds from fine wares (n=16), utility wares (n=13), and
burned clay/daub (n=3) were subjected to instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA,
Ferguson and Glascock, Chapter 9, this volume) and/or petrographic analysis (Cecil,
Chapter 9, this volume). Each set of analyses provided useful information on the paste
composition of the sherds, and led to the identification of a variety of chemical and paste
groups. These identifications then led to the partitioning of the analyzed sherds into those
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. 573

Chapter 16

thought to be of local manufacture (i.e. manufactured from clays and tempers obtained
in near proximity to the site) as well as sherds thought to be of non-local manufacture (i.e.
manufactured from clays and tempers not available within a nearby local sub-region or
region of this part of East Texas).
On the basis of abundance, the most dominant chemical group of sherds at the Kitchen
Branch (78 percent) and Keering (80 percent) sites are from INAA Region 4. These very
likely came from a local clay, ca. 0â3 km away, even if that clay source cannot be pinpointed.
Between 10â22 percent of the INAA and petrographic analysis sherds from the Kitchen
Branch and Keering sites may be from non-local sources, although the non-local source
areas do not appear to represent long-distance trade and exchange of ceramic vessels.
However, only one of the sherds in the analyzed samples could represent a non-locally
made ceramic vessel from both the INAA and petrographic work; none of the other possible
non-local sherds have both supporting INAA and petrographic evidence. The sherds from
vessels from apparent non-local sources may be from the middle Red River (INAA region
1); INAA region 5 (upper Sabine River basin) and paste group 4; and INAA region 6 (middle
Sabine River basin). These results indicate that the movement of ceramic vessels at the
sites was not confined to fine wares, but rather that all manner of ceramic wares were made
in several sub-regions of East Texas by Caddo potters and regularly traded or exchanged to
other Caddo peoples living in other sub-regions for various goods and services.
An element by element consideration of the geochemical variability in sherds analyzed by
INAA from the Big Cypress Creek basin by Perttula and Selden (Chapter 9, this volume),
suggests that 23 percent of the INAA sherds from the Kitchen Branch site were made
from non-local but nearby Wilcox Group clays. These clays are available approximately
10 miles or more north of the Kitchen Branch site in the Big Cypress Creek valley and
tributary valleys. The remainder of the Kitchen Branch sherds (77 percent) may have been
made from local Claiborne Group clays. At the Keering site, both Wilcox (60 percent) and
Claiborne (40 percent) clays may have been used on the manufacture of vessels. Given
the location of the site in the upper Prairie Creek valley, these sherds may well be from
vessels made from locally accessible clays from both groups.
The wide number of paste groups detected in the petrographic analysis in the Kitchen
Branch and Keering site ceramic assemblages is consistent with the kinds of Caddo
ceramics that occur in archeological sites across East Texas. Caddo potters used a variety
of clays and tempers to manufacture ceramic vessels, likely a result of local preferences
and family traditions, to meet the functional and stylistic demands of the kinds of vessels
being made in local communities and individual sites.
A range of chipped and ground stone lithic artifacts have been recovered at the Kitchen
Branch site, including arrow points and arrow point preforms (n=44), flake tools and
scrapers (n=45), dart points and preforms (n=93), several stages of bifaces (n=43),
chipped stone gouges (n=12), cores and tested cobbles/pebbles (n=52), ground stone
tools (n=64), lithic debris (n=4399), and fire-cracked rocks (n=422). Although the
574 AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

assemblage is substantial (5,170+ artifacts), most of the lithic artifacts (85 percent)
are pieces of debris from local lithic raw materials (quartzite, earth-toned chert, petrified
wood, and ferruginous sandstone) that are the product of chipped stone tool manufacture
and maintenance activities, and the overall density of lithic artifacts, as with the ceramic
sherds, is low across the block excavations and by depth in the archeological deposits.
The recovered projectile points from the site indicate that the southern knoll adjacent to
Prairie Creek was used from as early as the Late Paleoindian period (i.e. several Dalton
points) to as late as the Late Caddo period Titus phase (i.e. Perdiz and Maud arrow points).
The vast majority of the dart points are types known to date from the Late Archaic (ca.
5000â2500 years BP) and Woodland (ca. 2500â1150 years BP) periods in East Texas,
especially contracting stem Gary dart points, while pre-AD 1300 stemmed arrow points
(n=14) are the most common of the arrow point forms in the archeological deposits. Dart
points and arrow points occur together from 0â70 cmbs in the archeological deposits,
and only in the 0â20 cmbs level do the recovered arrow points actually outnumber dart
points. The distributions and frequency of the projectile points indicate that there is no
stratigraphic integrity to the archeological deposits per se, as there are no spatial or
vertical clusters or concentrations of contemporaneously-aged projectile points.
The spatial and vertical mixture of dart point and arrow point types of widely divergent ages
in the archeological deposits at the Kitchen Branch do not lend themselves to anything
more than speculation about the co-associations of specific chipped stone and ground
stone tool categories with projectile points of known age or in deposits of known depth.
It does appear to be the case that bifaces, gouges and flake tools, dart points, cores and
tested cobbles/pebbles, ground stone tools, and fire-cracked rocks are more common in
the deeper archeological deposits (below 40 cmbs), while arrow points and lithic debris
are more frequent in the shallower depths.
Finally, the combination of both archeological and archival investigations indicate that the
historic archeological component at the Kitchen Branch site is part of an early twentieth
century farmstead. The archival research points to permanent residence of the site by
1902 by several different families, including the Greeney family or tenants of the Greeney
family (1902â1910), the Normans (1910â1924), and the Givens (1925â1933) family.
The archeological evidence suggests a structure with a rock chimney was present on
the northern knoll prior to 1935. A diffuse scatter of nails, window glass, brick pieces,
ammunition, possible tin can fragments, bottle glass sherds, whiteware, ironstone, and
stoneware sherds occurs in archeological deposits on the southern knoll. No cultural
features relating to this occupation were recognized in the block excavation on the southern
knoll, but the archeological remains suggest that a barn or some other wood-framed
structure with glass windows stood on the knoll, and that these remains are apparent
as areas of magnetic enhancement in the geophysical survey investigations. As no such
structures are visible in 1935 through the late 1950âs aerial photos of the corresponding
feature locations, it is likely that the first structures were razed prior to 1935.

Keering Site
The Keering site is in the upper Prairie Creek stream basin in Camp County, Texas. It
received limited test excavations (eight 5 x 5-ft units and several gradall trenches) in
1974 as part of the U.S. 271 project. No archeological features such as pits or post holes
were identified, although a darkly-stained possible midden area was defined in one area.
Archeological deposits were shallow and not well preserved in the sandy loam sediments
at the site, no more than 46 cm thick across the site, and because these deposits occur
on a stable upland surface, artifacts of different ages (ranging from at least Woodland to
Late Caddo period times) are found together in the same levels and sediments.
A wide variety of prehistoric ceramic and lithic artifacts have been recovered from the
Keering site. In the absence of radiocarbon or TL dates, the temporally diagnostic artifacts
(i.e. decorated ceramic sherds, arrow points, and dart points) found there indicate that
it may have been occupied as early as the Middle Archaic period (ca. 8000â5000 years
BP), but its main periods of use were during the Woodland period (ca. 1750â1250 years
BP) and the early part of the Late Caddo period Titus phase (ca. 500â400 years BP).
One Colbert arrow point in the assemblage suggests a limited use as well between ca.
750â950 years BP, and a Keno Trailed bottle sherd is consistent with a very limited use by
the Caddo after 350 years BP.
The ceramic assemblage from the Keering site represents a domestic Titus phase
assemblage based on the occurrence of sherds from small to medium-sized plain wares,
utility wares (mainly brushed, incised, and tool punctated), and fine wares (engraved
and red-slipped). The sherds are from grog-tempered vessels, often with a sandy paste,
indicating the regular use of naturally sandy alluvial clays. Bone temper was also regularly
added to the vessel paste, especially in the utility wares. The decorated sherds in this
western Big Cypress Creek basin Titus phase assemblage are dominated by utility
wares from Harleton Appliqued, Bullard Brushed, Maydelle Incised, Killough Pinched,
and Mockingbird Punctated jars. Fine wares are primarily from Ripley Engraved (several
varieties) carinated bowls and bottles. Both red and white pigments were commonly added
to the engraved decorations of the fine ware sherds. These locally-made ceramics at the
site are supplemented with sherds from non-locally made Cowhide Stamped and Keno
Trailed vessels that likely originated among Belcher phase Caddo groups along the Red
River in Northwest Louisiana.
The chipped stone assemblage is comprised of arrow points and arrow point preforms,
dart points, bifaces, flake tools, one gouge, several cores, and 373 pieces of lithic debris.
The most common arrow points are of the Perdiz type, and these are associated with the
early Titus phase occupation; Bonham-Perdiz and Colbert arrow points are from unrelated
Caddo occupations. The dart points are primarily of Woodland period age, including Gary,
var. Camden and var. LeFlore, a Garyito (cf. Webb et al. 1969) or very small Gary, and a
Godley or Ensor. Bifaces are primarily associated with this component at the site, given that
they represent blanks and preforms intended for dart point manufacture. The few ground
576 AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

stone tools from the site are grinding slabs, manos, and pitted stones of locally available
hematite and ferruginous sandstone. These were used to grind, pound, and pulverize plant
foods, most likely during the Woodland period occupation.
Cores in the assemblage at the Keering site are multiple and single platform flake cores
on pebbles and small cobbles. The lithic debris is generally small to medium size, and
has considerable proportions of cortical flakes in all size grades (but especially the larger
debris sizes). The chipped stone tool knapping on this site was likely primarily the result of
the regular initial reduction and thinning (with soft and hard hammer percussion flakes)
of pebbles and small cobbles that were cortex-covered, along with some further shaping
and thinning of pebbles, cores, and bifaces, as well as the production of flakes for tools.
Cortex-covered pebbles and small cobbles of distinctive materials from Bowie Gravels (ca.
60â70 miles to the northeast) or from Red River gravels below the confluence of the
Kiamichi River (70â80 miles to the north), were either obtained through trade/exchange
or direct procurement. These pebbles and small cobbles were then reduced on site to
obtain bifacial and flake tools. The aboriginal peoples that occupied the Keering site relied
mainly on the use of locally available lithic raw materials in the form of pebbles and small
cobbles for the production of stone tools, including coarse- and fine-grained quartzite,
petrified wood, and earth-toned cherts; these materials are present in several raw material
source areas in the Prairie Creek stream basin. Locally available lithic raw materials are
well represented in all chipped lithic artifacts: 77 percent of the arrow points, 91 percent
of the dart points, 88 percent of the flake tools, 86 percent of the bifaces, 86 percent of
the cores, and 89 percent of the lithic debris. The slightly higher use of non-local lithic
raw materials in the arrow points indicates a more ready access to non-local raw material
sources during the Late Caddo period Titus phase occupation.

B. J. Horton Site
All available sources of information about the B. J. Horton site (Hunt et al. 1996; Perttula
et al. 2010a), including e-mail communications with Robert L. Turner, Jr. and Milton Bellâ
both intimately familiar with the late 1950âs and/or the late 1960âs work, thereby, a variety
of individualsâindicate that the site is a Late Caddo period Titus phase cemetery that
was discovered by local avocational archeologists in the 1950s after soil was removed
from an upland knoll for use in the construction of the U.S. 271 bridge over Big Cypress
Creek. An estimated 20â21 Caddo burials have been excavated from the cemetery, a size
consistent with its use by a local community of Titus phase Caddo farmers. The range
of decorated vessel types includes Karnack Brushed-Incised, Pease Brushed-Incised, La
Rue Neck Banded, Mockingbird Punctated, Bullard Brushed, several varieties of Ripley
Engraved, Simms Engraved, Turner Engraved, Hood Engraved, and Wilder Engraved. Of the
35 vessels known to have come from burials at the site, 66 percent are fine ware engraved
vessels, primarily carinated bowls. This suite of utility ware and fine ware vessels, and
the number and proportion of Bassett arrow points placed in the burials (n=23, and 62

AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. 577

Chapter 16

percent of all the points placed with the burials), suggest that the B. J. Horton site was
primarily used in the 16th century for burial interments, from ca. AD 1500â1550.
A broader comparison of Titus phase vessel assemblages in the Big Cypress Creek basin
indicates that the B. J. Horton site ceramics placed as funerary offerings with deceased
Caddo individuals are likely part of a western Titus phase ceramic tradition (see Figure
8-29a). The Kitchen Branch and Keering sites are also part of this postulated western Late
Caddo ceramic tradition. Within the Big Cypress Creek basin, the east-west dichotomy in
the character of vessel assemblages runs between the Prairie and Greasy Creek valleys.

Conclusions
This section of the reportâs concluding chapter considers the archeological findings from
the Kitchen Branch site with respect to several research issues as laid out in the projectâs
overall research design (see Chapter 4, this volume). These regional research issues have
been developed from current archeological knowledge about Late Caddo, Titus phase,
farming communities in the Big Cypress Creek basin of the Northeast Texas Pineywoods.
As reviewed in Chapter 4, these research issues concern the archeological character
of Titus phase households, and focus on ways in which the archeological record at the
Kitchen Branch site reflects a myriad of shared practices by a single nuclear or extended
family who themselves are part of a larger community composed of many households. The
intention is to investigate their materiality, namely the practices and experiences that have
a material dimension and shape the human experience within different social contexts.
This has been completed through the detailed analysis of the spatial organization of
houses, features, and use of space (indoor as well as outdoor), in conjunction with the
material culture assemblages (particularly the ceramic vessel sherds) which were formed
by the cumulative practices of daily life at one Titus phase household.

Household Structure and Organization
The Titus phase Caddo component at the Kitchen Branch site has a distinctive spatial
organization with a single domestic structure, several ancillary facilities (i.e. above-ground
work platforms, racks, and a possible granary) situated near the domestic structure,
and outdoor work areas with features and concentrations of discarded ceramic and
lithic artifacts. Although at different spatial scales given varying internal complexity and
settlement size, similar spatial patterning in structures, ancillary facilities, and outdoor
work areas have been documented in recent years in Titus phase community centers,
villages, and smaller settlements in the White Oak (Perttula and Sherman 2009), Big
Cypress (Perttula 2005, 2012), Little Cypress (Parsons 2011), and Sabine River (Fields
and Gadus 2012) basins in East Texas.

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

The spatial distributions of ceramic sherds in the block excavations at the Kitchen Branch
site cluster primarily to the south and west of the house structure, but the highest densities
are found in proximity to the house structure, or are in extra-mural outdoor activity areas
ca. 5â9 m south and southeast of the house structure. The concentration of sherds in
outdoor work areas suggests that much of the everyday activities of the Caddo peoples
that lived at the Kitchen Branch site took place in extra-mural contexts. But activities such
as cooking, vessel manufacture, disposal of broken vessels, sherd disposal piles as temper
sources, etc., occurred immediately around the house. The absence of a midden deposit
in the investigated area at the site further suggests that there was no consistent disposal
of trash in concentrated areas away from the house, perhaps another indication that the
ancestral Caddo occupation here was not lengthy (i.e. not lengthy enough to accumulate
noxious-smelling trash and organic debris).
Pieces of daub and burned clay are concentrated along and near the east, north, and
south walls of the house structure, as well as in one extra-mural area in the block. This
latter area may have been more intensively used for the kinds of activities that produce
burned clay and daub, perhaps outdoor cooking in pits and the burning of a thatch and
mud-covered structure or ancillary facility.
With respect to the lithic artifacts that can likely be attributed to the Titus phase occupation,
arrow points are distributed across the northern and central block areas, in and in proximity
to clusters of post holes marking one structure, and in extra-mural or outdoor activity
areas not far to the south. Flake tools are found primarily in proximity to the structure and
ancillary facilities, as well as in extra-mural activity areas where flake tools were used and
eventually discarded. The ground stone tools are present primarily in and in proximity to the
clusters of post holes that represent the location of the Caddo domestic structure. Most
of these tools are in extra-mural or outdoor activity areas, the main concentration being to
the south of the structure in the central block area. Lithic debris in the upper levels of the
archeological deposits (0â40 cmbs) are concentrated in extra-mural or outdoor activity
areas. The spatial distributions of these different categories of lithic artifacts indicate that
much of the manufacture, use/refurbishment, and discard of debris and tools by Caddo
peoples occurred in outdoor activity areas at the Kitchen Branch site.

Place of the Site in the Local Political Community
The Kitchen Branch, Keering, and B. J. Horton sites have archeological components
that date to the Late Caddo period Titus phase. Relying on ceramic sherd and vessel
assemblage comparisons between a number of Titus phase sites in the Big Cypress Creek
basin as a proxy for social and political structure, organization, and inter-relationships,
there are distinctive spatial differences in their composition that can be related to the
definition and recognition of local political communities. Ceramic vessels were important
to ancestral Caddo peoples in the cooking and serving of foods and beverages, in the
storage of foodstuffs, as personal possessions, and as works of art and craftsmanship.
Some vessels were clearly made to never be used in domestic contexts, and the designs

Chapter 16

on engraved fine wares seem to have served as social identifiers. Certain shared and
distinctive stylistic motifs and decorative patterns marked closely related communities
and constituent groups. These spatial differences in utility ware and fine ware manufacture
and use as recognized in ceramic sherd and vessel assemblage composition between
contemporaneous sites are thought to represent the spatial extent of socially distinct Caddo
populations who nevertheless had considerable interaction and cultural transmission of
beliefs and practices.
There are east-west ceramic spatial and stylistic dichotomies in the Big Cypress Creek
basin that fall between the Prairie Creek and Greasy Creek valleys. The western Caddo
sites include both Prairie Creek sites like Kitchen Branch, Keering, Sam Roberts (41CP8)
and Johns (41CP12) sites to the west on Big Cypress Creek as far west as Lake Bob Sandlin,
as well as sites on Dry Creek (i.e. Tuck Carpenter and Harold Williams) and Walkers Creek
(i.e. the Pilgrimâs Pride and B. J. Horton sites). Eastern Titus phases include those in the
Greasy Creek valley and on Big Cypress Creek and tributaries as far east as Lake Oâ the
Pines. The results of the ceramic sherd and vessel assemblage comparisons discussed
in Chapter 8 suggest that the Prairie Creek and Greasy Creek sites are parts of separate
political communitiesâeven though they are only a few miles apart. Perttula (2012:371,
see also Figure 2.5, this volume) has recognized five Titus phase political communities in
the Big Cypress Creek basin, although they may well be more than that at any one time.
The Shelby site (41CP71) is considered the social and political center of the Greasy Creek
political community, with a subsidiary mound at the P. S. Cash site (41CP2), with community
cemeteries at the Shelby and Gold Star Ballroom (41UR107) sites. Conversely, the social
and political center of the Prairie Creek political community is apparently the Sam Roberts
mound center and village (41CP8, and probably the locus of an as yet identified community
cemetery). The Kitchen Branch site is only a few miles upstream from the Sam Roberts site
on Prairie Creek, and it represents one of many permanent Titus phase settlements that
would have comprised parts of clusters of contemporaneous small domestic communities.

Local Subsistence Practices and Caddo Farming
Plant and animal remains were not particularly well preserved in the Kitchen Branch
archeological deposits, and thus insights into the subsistence practices of the Titus phase
peoples that lived there are rather scant. The most useful information on subsistence
practices and local farming by Caddo peoples may come from both maize ubiquity values
and organic residue analysis on a sample of Titus phase ceramic sherds.
Stable isotope analyses on human remains from Titus phase contexts in the Big Cypress
Creek basin are limited to the Alex Justiss site (-13.4 o/oo on collagen from one burial and
-18.7 Â± 3.7 o/oo on collagen from nine other burials, 41TT13, see Rogers et al. 2003)
and the Harold Williams site (-14.0 o/oo on collagen from one burial, 41CP10, Turner
and Smith 2003). The range in stable carbon isotopes from these two sites indicates that
there was significant variation in the diets of Titus phase Caddo peoples, particularly in the
consumption of maize. The -13.4 o/oo and -14.0 o/oo values suggest that at least 50â70
580 AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

percent of the diet of these individuals was based on maize, which is consistent with the
stable isotope analyses of larger samples of Late Caddo period human remains from much
of the Caddo area (see Wilson and Perttula 2013). The larger number of stable isotope
samples from Alex Justiss, however, have values more consistent with assemblages where
maize comprised less than 40 percent of the diet. Presumably the diet of the Titus phase
Caddo peoples that lived at the Kitchen Branch siteâand thus the assumed importance
of maize and other cultivated foodsâfell between these dietary proportions detected from
stable isotope analysis.
Another measure of the importance of maize in ancestral Caddo populations is the
ubiquity of maize in flotation samples. Although ubiquity measures may also be related
to archeological sampling procedures and Caddo harvesting and processing practices
(Bush 2012:751), comparisons of ubiquity measures across a range of sites dating to
different time periods in the Caddo area have provided useful insights into the relative
importance of maize in the diet of different Caddo groups (see Perttula 2008:Tables 2 and
3). Maize ubiquity values from Late Caddo sites in the Big Cypress Creek, Sabine River,
and Neches-Angelina River basins range from 33.3â100 percent (Perttula 2008:Table 2),
with most sites having values that range from 33â55 percent (see also Bush 2012:Table
B.10). In Late Caddo period sites in southwest Arkansas, southeast Oklahoma, and
northwest Louisiana, maize ubiquity values tend to be higher, with ranges from 58â94
percent (Perttula 2008:Table 3). At the Kitchen Branch site, the maize ubiquity value is 23
percent (see Chapter 12, this volume), at the low end of contemporaneous Caddo sites in
East Texas, suggesting that maize consumption was of a lesser importance to the Caddo
peoples that occupied the Kitchen Branch site. By comparison, the maize ubiquity value
at the Pine Tree Mound site (41HS15), a large mound center and densely occupied Titus
phase village, is 55 percent (Bush 2012:Table B.10).
Organic residue analysis of sherds from plain wares, utility wares, and fine wares, on the
other hand (see Chapter 12, this volume, and Appendix 12-1), provide different insights
into Titus phase subsistence practices. The organic residue results indicate that 70 percent
of the tested sherds have residues from beans (in raw form), 60 percent have residues
from maize (in charred, baked, oven boiled, and raw form), five percent have residues from
gourd/pumpkin/squash (raw and dried), and five percent have residues from wild onion
(cooked and raw). The very common occurrence of beans and maize in the sherd organic
residues likely indicate that these cultivated foods were important parts of the diet and
local Caddo culinary traditions and practices.
In general, Titus phase Caddo groups like those that lived at the Kitchen Branch site were
food producers who cultivated plants (maize, beans, and squash), as well as maygrass
(a native seed). However, foraging remained a significant part of the subsistence regime.
Hardwood nutshell collection and processing was particularly important, probably for the
production of carbohydrate and protein-rich hickory nut oil, and geophytes and seeds from
wild plant foods were also valuable food resources. Animal protein and fats were obtained
primarily from white-tailed deer as well as a range of mammals, birds, and turtles.

Chronology-building
The submission of many radiocarbon samples and thermoluminescence (TL) samples from
the archeological deposits at the Kitchen Branch site has led to a better appreciation of
the possible ages of the different occupations that took place there from Middle Archaic to
Late Caddo period times. With these results, in conjunction with a measure of chronometric
hygiene (see Tache and Hart 2013), the radiocarbon results that are thought to be generally
acceptable given their context and associated material culture remains range, first, from
3153 BC and 812 BC for Archaic material culture remains encountered in the deeper
part of the archeological deposits. And second, ancestral Caddo features and sherds that
form groups of chronometrically acceptable calibrated dates are AD 1347â1396, with age
ranges that extend from AD 1297â1435, and AD 1435â1488, with 2 sigma age ranges
that extend from AD 1396â1524. The analysis of the stylistic elements on the recovered
utility ware and fine ware ceramic sherds in the Kitchen Branch assemblage point to the
AD 1435â1488 age range as most reasonably bounding the age of the siteâs Titus phase
occupation. The results of the TL dating corroborate the mid- to late fifteenth century age
range of the Caddo occupation at the site. Several of the TL assays are not accurate or
reliable, being several hundred years too old, but many of the TL dates (74 percent) fall
within the broad range of the most likely calibrated radiocarbon dates from ancestral
Caddo features and some of the bulk ceramic sherd paste samples. As such, the principal
Kitchen Branch ancestral Caddo occupationâand its associated ceramic assemblageâ
may stand as an exemplar for the characterization of the material culture remains to be
found in an early Titus phase component in the western Titus phase ceramic tradition in
the Big Cypress Creek basin.

Final Comments
In sum, the archeological investigations at the Kitchen Branch, Keering, and B. J. Horton
sites has obtained new and significant information on the material character of Late
Caddo period Titus phase sites (domestic and mortuary) in the western part of the Titus
phase heartland in the Big Cypress Creek basin, as well as a varied set of archeological
information on pre-AD 800 aboriginal use of these locales. At the Kitchen Branch site in
particular, much of the archeological evidence from features and artifact assemblages
represent a mid-late fifteenth century community of practice (i.e. âa group of people
regularly engaged in a common endeavorâ [Mitchell 2013:41]) with transcendent material,
temporal, and spatial expressions in the archeological record.
As places on the landscape, these three sitesâalong with the many other ancestral Caddo
sites that have been investigated in the Big Cypress Creek basin and beyond in East Texasâ
and the people that lived there (and buried their dead there) were part of a broader social
world linked and cross-cut by networks of social groups tied together through regional
interaction (cf. Joyce 2012; Mills et al. 2013). That social network is best recognized in the
series of political communities that have been identified in the Big Cypress basin and in
the adjoining middle Sabine River basin (e.g., Fields and Gadus 2012; Perttula 2012). This
582 AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Archeological Investigations at Big Cypress Creek Basin, Camp County, Texas

is most clearly seen in the sites discussed herein in the analysis of the Late Caddo Titus
phase ceramic sherds and vessels found in their archeological deposits. These material
objects and fragments illustrate through detailed analysis how communities of learned
practices in the production, consumption, and use of ceramic vessels in the Big Cypress
Creek basin from the early fifteenth century (with shared antecedent practices in Middle
Caddo period times) to the late seventeenth century represent the sharing of technological
and stylistic preferences in ceramic vessel manufacture and decoration (as well as in
other categories of material cultureâsuch as stone tool manufactureâthat are still not
as well understood) over multiple generations by Caddo peoples and led over the longterm to the persistence of multiple communities of Caddos in this part of East Texas.
There were particular ways of doing things that have been identified at the regional scale
in the archeological record at Caddo sites in the Big Cypress Creek basin that can be
interpreted as representing a constellation of practices (i.e. traditions) that persisted over
time. The social engagement of Caddo peoples that can be detected in the East Texas
archeological record provides a window to understand and appreciate the existence of
social relationships that were broad and pervasive.
The Kitchen Branch, Keering, and B. J. Horton sites are by themselves rather humble
manifestations of the archeological heritage of the Caddo peoples in East Texas. However,
because the social networks of which they were a part have been detected in the material
culture found in their archeological deposits, as well as in large regional databases of
Late Caddo Titus phase sites and ceramics, the complex social and spatial dynamics of
interaction and change that existed over a ca. 250 year period (ca. AD 1430â1680) in the
historical landscape of the Big Cypress Creek basin can be appreciated through multiple
scales of material practice, from that of a single site to regional Caddo communities and
beyond.
