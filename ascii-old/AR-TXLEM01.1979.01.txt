ABSTRACT
In the sununer and autumn of 1976 and again in the spring
of 1977, a remnant of the Plainview site, a late Paleo-Indian

:"~

bison kill site, was located and partly excavated by the
Archeological Research Laboratory of the Llano Estacado Museum
of Plainview, Texas.

The site was first excavated in 1945

q
;j

by Dr. E.H. Sellards, Mr. Glen Evans, and Dr. Grayson Meade.
Subsequent to that excavation, the site was lost for several
years as a result of extensive quarrying operations in the
area.
The portion of the site relocated in 1976 was apparently washed downstream from the kill area by flood waters.
The unarticulated fossil bison bone was in poor condition
and very little information could be gained other than some
Taphonomic information and a few bone measurements.
No artifacts were found during this excavation but a
small, unworked lithic flake was collected and is

des~ribed.

In addition, an original Plainview site artifact, a point in
The Museum of Texas Tech University, is described in this
report.
The principal accomplishments of this excavation was
the relocation of a major Paleo-Indian site that was feared
lost and the mapping of additional unexcavated site areas.

INTRODUCTION
The Plainview site, a late Paleo-Indian kill site, is
located within the City of Plainview, Hale County, Texas
The site is designated 41-HA-l by the Texas

Sellards, Mr. Glen L. Evans, Dr. Grayson E. Meade,

During the course of the excavation, 18 distinctive

lanceolate projectile points were found in association with
the remains of approximately 100 giant extinct bison.

Al-

though a segment of the bone stratum was left intact for
future reference, quarry operation and vandalism destroyed
all evidence of the site except a small section that extended
under an access road.
In August, 1976, the Llano Estacada Museum began an
archeological testing project in an attempt to locate the
remnant of bone bed under the access road.

The bone stratum

was located shortly after work began, and the excavation was
expanded to include about 45m

under the old access road.

The excavation continued ·until all of the fossil bone in
this area was exposed and removed in December, 1976.
In May, 1977, test excavations parallel to the margin
of the caliche quarry revealed the outline of the remaining
portion of the Plainview site

ENVIRONMENT OF THE AREA
Physiography
The Plainview site is located in the flood plain near
south margin of the valley of the Running Water Draw in
Texas at 102 meters above mean sea level.

Running

is the uppermost headwater tributary of the Brazos
It heads about 40 kilometers northwest of Clovis,
Mexico and flows east-southeastward approximately 240
,ometers, crossing 'the High Plains section of the Great
~ins provine

(S.C.S. 1968:. 3).

The High Plains section is a great

ma~s

of Cenozoic

derived by outwash from the Rocky Mountains to the
Th~

southern portion of the High Plains, south of the

_Adian River,

i~ called the Staked Plains or Llano Estacada.

~ tlaho Estacada is bounded on the east by a conspicuous

tern caprock escarpment.
~·valley

The area extends westward to

of the Pecos River in New Mexico, and to the
Llano Estacada grades into the Edwards Plateau.

surface is one of low relief, the slope being about
per mile to the

south~ast

(Blair 1950: 110-111).

Geology
In the area near the Plainview site, Running Water Draw
eroded a gentle valley 6 to 12 meters below the plains
and has an average width of between 400 and 800 meters.

Flora and Fauna
The Llano Estacada is characterized as the Short-grass
P1aihs district of the Kansan Biotic province, with buffalo
grass the principal constituent (Blair 1950: 110-111).

Trees

the Short-g.rass district are restricted of sparse growths
cottonwoods and hackberry that occasionally appear along
stream ·floodplains and around springs of water.
Blair (1950: 111-112) notes that the Kansan province

CULTURAL. BACKGROUND
A

review of the cultural background of the Llano

Estacada is necessary to place the Plainview site in the
proper cultural and geographic context.

The cultural stages

bf development from earliest to latest are:
,Atchai~,

Neo-Indian, and Historic.

Paleo-Indian,

For the purpose of this

report, the most important of these is the Paleo-Indian
stage, which ·may be further divided into three main cultural
. aequences:

Clovisi Folson, and Portales Cultures.

The Paleo-Indian stage is characterized by well-made
':letnceolate spear points, of both fluted and unf luted variety,
.'.'~.tid subsistence based on big game hunting.

In the general

~~i.:i.;~ea of the Plainview site, several other rnaj or Paleo-Indian
have been discovered.

Clovis

rhe Clovis site, or Blackwater Locality No. 1, is
about 90 miles west of Plainview.

The Clovis cul-

characterized by the use of large fluted points ~n
mammoths.
B.l?.

This 9ulture is dated between 11,000 and
(Hughes and Wiiley 1978: 25).

Another Clovis-period site, the Miami site, is 16cated
miles north-nbrtheast of l?lainview, where three Clbvis
' ints and a scraper were found in associatibn with at least
marhtnoths (Hughes and Willey 1978: 25).

6

Folsom
The Folsom culture is.characterized by hunting giant
extinct bison with finely.flaked, fluted points and is dated
about 10,000 years B.P.

Folsom-age sites on and around the

.tlano Estacado include:

T.he Folsom (New Mexico) , Lipscomb,

.tubbock Lake, Midland, Adair-Steadman, and Lake Theo sites.
The Folsom site is about 225 miles northwest of
Plainview, and, in 1926, J.D. Figgins· found 19 Folsom points
with the remains of 23 giant extinct bison.
The tipscotnb site, about 135 miles hortheast of
·Plainview, yielded lB Folsom points and possible hearths in
~~8Sociation

with fossil bison.

At the Lubbock Lake site 45 miles south of Plainview,
artifacts, including four points, -were

coll~cted

from

Folsom level (Hughes and Willey 1978: 25).
The Midland site 150 miles south of Plainview produced
·~,

..

old human skull fragments and traces of Folsom culture

fWdrmington 1957: 244).
About 130 miles southeast of Plainview, the Adair'~admah site has produced several thousand Folsom artifacts

d appears to have-been a major base camp of Folsom age
·'"•

tfighes and Willey 1g78: 25) .

.,

The take Theo site 40 miles northeast of Plainview has
several Folsom points and appears to be a Folsom
and butchering station (Harrison and Smith 1975).
One other site that might be included in the Folsom
not because of the point types but its age, is the

The site is located about 30 miles north-

northeast of Plainview in the Mackenzie Reservoir.·

In 1973

five paleo points were coll~ct~d at the site in assooiation
with the remains o:f six extinct bison.

Two of the poirtts

were lanceolate and.similar to Clovis points.

The remaining

three were of the side.-hollowed variety, closely resembling
San Patrice (Hughes and Willey 1978:

49~114).

Portales cultures
Following the Folsom culture is ·a series of cultures
for which the name Portales has been suggested (Sellards
1952).

i. :points

These cultures are characterized by parallel-flaked
used for ht.mting extinct ahd modern bison.

The age

··>·:bf these cultures range frottl about 7,000 to 9,000 years .B.P.

·:'trite Plainview culture falls within this proposed Portales
.:tulture group.

Other sites within the Plainview region that

included in the Portales culture are the San 0on site
the Milnesand site.
At the San Joh site, about .120 miles west-northwest of
lainview, a small lanceolate point was found in association

~ith fossil bison remains.

These same

HISTOnICAL BACKGROUND
!n 1933 a

pi~

for road material {caliche) was opened

the south margin of the valley of the Running Water
near the City of Plainview, Hale county, Texas.

As

was extended northward into the valley to remove
bel~w

the valley .fill, a bison bone bed was exposed.
operations continued, a portidn of the bone bed

removed.
In January, 1941, three Plainview boys were exploring
the margins of the bone. bed when one of the boys found

ibhg

t· ..projectile

point, which was later identified as a Plainview

At the time, however, both the 'site and the point
until later discovered by Glen Evans and

buring the summel;' of 1944, Evans and Meade were studying
Pleistocene geology .of the Texas High Plains for the
\if'~au
~y

Of Economic .Geology of the University of Texas when

located the bone bed.

Between June· and October of 1945,

of the bone bed was

excavated~

The excava-

.:ion, a joint project of the Bureau of Economic Geology and
~he

Texas Memorial Museum, :,was donducted by E .H. Sellards,

~~an Evans,
Grayson Meade, Alex Krieger, Adolph Witte and
.
··thers (Sellards et al 1941:

The bones

collected had lain -on or near sur·faae for a decade and yield-·
ed a· date of 7 1 100 1160'years ago (Wormington 1957: 108).
After 1949,· workmen in the quarry occasionally found
Plainview Points as additional portions of the site were
removed by heavy machinery.

For a few years after the quar-

rying operations ended, the site was, for the most part,
forgotten.

However, in January, 1964, a member of a Cub

Scout troop found a Plainview Point while exploring near the
old excavation site.

After this, rumors circulated period-

ically that other points or scrapers had been found.

As

pot" holes could be seen high up on the ver-:-

tical walls of the caliche quarry where relic collectors had
dug as far as they could reach back into the remaining bone
bed in search of artifacts.
In January, 1961, the Plainview Site was designated a
National Historic" Landmark and listed in the National Register of Historic

Pla~es.

In 1963, a bronze Registered National

Historic Landmark Plaque was sent to the mayor of Plainview.
However, this action was not made public knowledge for over
a decade.
In

1974~

sever~l

years after the death of the mayor, the

Llano Estacada Museum received the mayor's papers.

Among

the closet full of papers was a sma11 cardboard carton containing the bronze marker.
In 1975, the National Park Service decided to either
remove the site from the Register of Historic Places or

definitely locate and describe the boundaries.

A:f ter an

inspection tour, it was decided ·that some portion of the
site prqbably remained; but since the exact location of the
site was unknown, the bounc;laries were only generally described
including a large area which might contain the

si~e

location •.

With the fate of the Plainview Site in balance, the City of
Plairtview decided to attempt to relocate the fossil.bone bed.·
In August, 1976, the Convention and Tourism Committee
of the Plainview Chamber of Commerce, along with several
Cduncil members of the City of Plainview, allocated funds
for an archeological testing project.

Within an hour after

beginning the testing, a portion of the bone bed was located
and later excavated by the Llano Estacada Museum.

METHODOLOGY
The fieldwork at the Plainview Site was conducted

be~

tween July 26 and December 18, 1976, and between April29
1977.

The regular field crew ·consisted of five

several volunteers employed during weekends.
Before and during the excavation of the Plainview Site,
library search was

cond~cted

for information pertaining to

the Plainview Point type, and the late Paleo-Indian

A study was also conducted of collections containing
Points found at the site but not described by
'·~~ither Sellards, Evans, Meade, et al
~·.;·:,:

(1947) or by Knudson

Local collectors were contacted and many hours were
the field trying to relocate the site.

At last, the

location was narrowed to an area of about 100 meters
length.along an access road

(Fig~

26).

The

ar~a

was lo-

Prior to excavation, a prime datum was established.

The bison bone,

the lower portion of the gray sand (Fig. 3·5) , was exca-

iF:ifated using trowels, dental picks, and paint brushes.

~~:~-

The test trench was eventually extended to 110 ·meters
length with 50cm. test pits excavated at about 10 meter
along the trench (Fig. 28)·.

At a point where the

·:_

.'':ohe fragments' appeared the most concentrated, the trench

as

expanded northward under the access road forming a 45

2

.eter excavation area (Fig. 29) •
A grid center was established on the access road with

north-south base line describing the western margin of
excavation, while the east-west base line was, at closest
four meters .north of the excavation area.

The grid

is 40 degrees south of east from the prime datum at
:"distance of 274.5 meters (Map 3).
The floor of the expanded excavation area·was divided
two-meter excavation units (Fig. 30}.

However, in areas

~~e the bone concentration was the great~st, excavation was

'ducted in one-meter (Unit) squares.
Level reports were Completed at each 20cm. level; howwhere numerous bones were exposed, superimposed over

additional bone, the level reports were assigned exposure
numbers.

The first

.

(bone) exposure report was filled out
.

when the overlying bone was removed to.reach the second (bone)
exposure.

The bone exposure was mapped on the reverse side

of each level report.
When an entire two-meter excavation unit was completed,
a second and larger sketch map was made.

This map included

both bone and geological features encountered in the two-meter
unit.
Each bone in a given excavation unit was assigned a
number running serially beginning with one.

In addition,

each bone was marked with a small north arrow.

This latter

precaution was taken in case the site might be restored in
future.
The last step before removing the bone from an excavunit was to photograph the

c~mpleted

square (Fig. 11-

The photographs were black and white prints and, as a
were at the same angle as the large sketch map.
In May, 1977, additional test excavation was conducted
the Plainview Site.

This excavation was along the margin

the old caliche quarry about 8 meters south of the prin-

l:>al excavation area of the year before.

A back hoe was

_loyed to follow the e<;J.ge of the quarry and excavate to

depth of the Pleistocene sand deposit.

The excavation

continued until no further bone was encountered, thereby

All of the matrix surrounding the bone was carried in

The first screen was one-quarter

ihoh mesh hail screen and the second was common fly screen.

All invertebrate fossils, caliche pebbles, and bone scrap
from the two screens were collected and sacked separately .

TBE BONE BED
As testing at the Plainview Site progressed, it became
apparent that the-1976-1977 excavation units were downstream
from the main kill area d~scribed by Sellards et al (1947).
Since the bones were apparently washed a short distance
downstream, there was no articulation of ·skeletal elements.
However, the distance the bison bone had washed was probably
rtot great since all bone landmarks were clear and fractures
were sharp and angular.
The Plainview bone deposit lay along the floor of an
ancient channel of Running Water Draw..

In the area of the

bone deposit, the stream trended southwest to northeast, a
stream meander since the normal stream flow is northwest·to
It is possible that the meander; at that time,

' was ·a

recent oxbdW cutoff or oxbow lake that may ha.ve served

part of the bison entrapment mechanism.

the artifact, a thin biface, had been overlooked by

ANALYSIS OF FOSSIL MATERIAL
Analysis 0£ the fossil bison bone for this report
·.provided li·ttle information .other than a few bone measurements (Table 2 and 3).'

However, .in the near·future Roberta

Speer, of West Texas State University, plans to analyze ahd
report on the bone recovered at the Plainview Site in 1945
by E.H. Sellards and Glen Evans.
As for this report, ·no definite conclusions could be
reached concerning the many questions surrounding the
·~lainview

Site.

However, some answers were suggested by

.·. #he bones and. their· relative position within the site.
The principal objective of the.fossil bone analysis
to identify any bones that exhibited modification as a
result of cultural activity.

However, because of the poor

)condition of the bones (Fig. 34) and the location of the
; excavation uni ts downstream from the kill area, ·the analysis
provided negative results.

f

have

be~n

None of the bones appeared to

utilized during the butchering process nor did

of the bones exhibit

butchering marks.

It

'.is likely that the· bones recovered during the 1976-1977
~xcavation

were either from the margins of the kill· or from

those animals near the bottom of a mass of carcasses.

23

The maximum number· of animals represented in the
;: collections

of

the excavation :was 17.

This number does

kill.

Although reported by Sellards $t al (1947), no fetal

However,

.

This in-

alone suggests that the bison kill occured during
months • . Since calving season_ peaks in mid-toand lasts for more than a month {Speer 1975: 18),
suggest that the kill occurred in mid-

-late sununer.

Single

££ Multiple Kill

The method employed by terminal Pleistocene hunters to
kill bison is highly conjectural.

However,

evidence of the bones at the Plainview Site
gests that the bison., bones were accumulated during a
gle kill rather than several kills over a short period ·
time.

This is supported by the water ·sorting and deposi-

bf bison bones into the earlier mentioned Voorhies

by sex and/or_ age varia_tions.
The metatarsal was found irt undisturbed strata in

Almost as interesting as .the bones found were the
;tid.ssing skeletal elements. ; Most noticeably absent at _the
iainview Site were skulls or horn cores and caudal verte-

Although at least two bison skulls were reported by
ellards et al (1947: 933-934) no skulls or horn cores were
ourtd during this excavation.

At another site Wormington (1957: 127} noted that of
180 bison found at ·the Horner Site by August, 1950 •••
••• the tops of the skulls were removed by the
hunters in all but two instances. This can
scarcely have been done simply· in order to
obtain the edible brains for in that case the
bone portions which were removed would have
been left nearby. Perhaps the top of the
skulls and horns were taken elsewhere to be
used in some ceremony.
The absence of tail bones at the Plainview Site has
·,.

'"tallels to other Paleo-Indian sites.

At the Rex Rodgers

..;.

ta, a Paleo-Indian kill site about 50 miles northeast of
'ainview, Roberta Speer observed {1975: 30~34) that no
tidal vertebrae were collected.

At the Jimmy Allen Site

·Wyoming, Wormington (1957: 146).noted that:

11

1-lo tail

nas were recovered which suggests that the hides were
rti6ved and taken els~wher~."

Wormington also· noted that

the Folsom Site:
An interesting featur.e of these skeletal remains
was the absence of the tail bones of most of the
animals.
This suggests that the animals had been
skinned, for as Barnum Brown has pointed out, in
skinning, the tail goes with the hide (1957: 25-26).

SUMMARY A.ND CONCLUS!ON
The purpose of this report was to present the results
of an archeological e.xcavation at the Plainview Site in
1~76-1977.

alone is

Archeological evidence from this· excavation

i~conclusive

but tends to support several earlier

theories regarding the Plainview kill event.
The fossil bone recovered from the site was in such
poor condition that it almost defied analysis.

However,

the bone was definitely from a species of g·iant extinct
bison that had perished en mass in an ancient stream channel.

This massive animal death was the result, to some

degree, of intentional human activity.
Although lithic material collected during this excavation was restricted to one small flake, -this report also
included a projectile point excavated in 1945 but not des. tiribed until the present time.
Considering the extensive caliche quarrying in the area,

it is surprising that a portion of the Plainview Site reThe relocation and excavation of the site proved
~nteresting although very little new information was gained

·y the project.

Perhaps, future studies will be more produc-

ive since several square meters of the site were left

It was somewhat discouraging to find that the relocated
bed was apparently water washed downstream from the

f'J)ki;,

kill site.

This, however, may prove an asset as

studies are expanded.

BONE MEASUREMENTS
Almost all of the bison bone from this test excavation
of the Plainview Site is fragmentary.

Very few bones were

complete or, for that matter, partially complete.

Therefore,

the measurements of the bones were taken from the most complete bones or from articular ends of broken bones
2 and 3, also see Fig.

24~34)

(Tables

.. All parameters for bone

measurements (Fig. 5-.13) are adapted ·from Bon:l;ire Shelter:
A Strati·fi.ed B1=,s_on Kill Site, V_al

Ve~_de

Coun!Y_, Texas (Dibble

and Lorrain: 1968).
