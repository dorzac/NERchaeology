ABSTRACT
In February of 2009, HRA Gray & Pape, LLC, of Houston, Texas, at the request of Berg
Oliver Associates, Inc., conducted intensive pedestrian archaeological investigations and
targeted deep testing of approximately 24 kilometers (15 miles) of property proposed for the
expansion of the Interstate Highway 10 corridor in Austin and Waller Counties, Texas. The
Texas Department of Transportation has been identified as the Lead Agency for this project.
Work for this project will be completed as part of the Texas Department of Transportation
Project CSJ Numbers 0271-02-055 (control), 0271-03-046, and 0271-04-071 by the Houston
and Yoakum Districts.
The goals of the surveys were to determine if the initiation of this project would affect any
previously identified historic properties as defined by Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (36 CFR 800), and to establish whether or not
previously unidentified archaeological resources were located within the project’s Area of
Potential Effect. All fieldwork and reporting activities were completed with reference to state
(Antiquities Code of Texas) and federal (National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as
amended [36 CFR 800]) guidelines, and according to standards set forth by the Texas
Department of Transportation Programmatic Agreement for Enhancement Projects.
The Area of Potential Effect for this project is defined as the project length, the existing and
proposed right-of-way, and the depth of construction impacts. The Area of Potential Effect
subsumes a total of 434 hectares (1,072 acres) made up of both existing and proposed right-ofway. Existing right-of-way entails the majority of the Area of Potential Effect and includes
353 hectares (872 acres), while proposed right-of-way encompasses only 70 hectares (173
acres). Frontage road bridges are to have a roadway width of 11 meters (36 feet). The Area of
Potential Effect generally extends to shallow depths across the project right-of-way. More
often the project entails the building up of material from the existing ground surface. Although
bridge replacement and new bridge construction will take place within existing right-of-way,
deep impacts are anticipated at the bridge crossings over the Brazos River and Bessies Creek
to depths exceeding 17 meters (55 feet).
The intensive pedestrian and reconnaissance surveys, as well as mechanical deep testing,
completed for the service areas discussed in this report took place on easements belonging to
the Texas Department of Transportation and privately-owned property. Right-of-entry was
obtained by the client for privately owned land. Work conducted to complete this survey was
conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit number 5152, issued by the Texas Historical
Commission’s Division of Archeology in February 2009.
No new or previously identified archaeological sites were recorded during the investigation.
Testing results displayed soil profiles indicative of those that are mapped for the area and gave
no indication of buried cultural horizons within the proposed depth of the Area of Potential
Effect. Based on the negative results of the intensive pedestrian survey, HRA Gray & Pape,
LLC recommends no further work and that the project be allowed to proceed as planned.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
HRA Gray & Pape, LLC, of Houston, Texas, at the request of Berg Oliver Associates, Inc.,
conducted an intensive pedestrian archaeological investigation and targeted deep testing of
approximately 24 kilometers (15 miles) of property proposed for the expansion of the
Interstate Highway 10 corridor in Austin and Waller Counties, Texas. The Texas Department
of Transportation has been identified as the Lead Agency for this project. Work for this project
has been completed as part of the Texas Department of Transportation’s Project CSJ Numbers
0271-02-055 (control), 0271-03-046 and 0271-04-071 by the Houston and Yoakum Districts.
This intensive pedestrian survey was designed to identify and preliminarily assess
archaeological resources that may be impacted by the proposed project. Potential buried and
surface archaeological resources fall within the purview of this investigation. As such, the
purposes of the archaeological intensive pedestrian survey were to determine if the initiation
of this project would affect any previously identified historic properties as defined by Section
106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (36 CFR 800), and to
establish whether or not previously unidentified archaeological resources were located within
the project’s Area of Potential Effect.
The project begins near Little Bernard Creek in Austin County and proceeds east along
Interstate Highway 10, bending south around of the town of Sealy, Texas, and continues east
passing south of the town of San Felipe. The project then crosses the Brazos River into Waller
County before bending to the south of the town of Brookshire, Texas, ending near Brookshire
Creek. The Area of Potential Effect for this project is defined as the project length, the existing
and proposed right-of-way, and the depth of construction impacts. The Area of Potential
Effect subsumes a total of 434 hectares (1,072 acres) made up of both existing and proposed
right-of-way. Existing right-of-way entails the majority of the project Area of Potential Effect
and included 353 hectares (872 acres), while proposed right-of-way encompasses only 70
hectares (173 acres) of the project Area of Potential Effect. Frontage road bridges will
measure 11 meters (36 feet) wide. The Area of Potential Effect depth generally extends to
shallow depths across the project right-of-way. More often the project entails the building up
of material from the existing ground surface. Although bridge replacement and new bridge
construction will take place within existing right-of-way, severe deep impacts are anticipated
at the Brazos River and Bessies Creek crossings to depths estimated at 17 meters (55 feet) for
the placement of bridge footings.
The intensive pedestrian survey for the service areas discussed in this report took place on
easements belonging to the Texas Department of Transportation and privately-owned
property. Right-of-entry was obtained by the client for privately owned land. Work conducted
to complete this survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit 5152 in February and
April of 2009. All fieldwork and reporting activities were completed with reference to state
(Antiquities Code of Texas [13 TAC 26; 1969 as amended 1997] and federal (National
Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended [36 CFR 800] and the United States
Department of the Interior (United States Department of the Interior 1981; 1983) the Texas
Historical Commission and the Council of Texas Archeologists and according to standards set

ii

forth by the Texas Department of Transportation Programmatic Agreement for Enhancement
Projects.
Fieldwork was conducted by HRA Gray & Pape, LLC staff Principal Investigator Sean Nash,
Field Director Charles E. Bludau, Jr., Crew Chief Elizabeth Spalding and Archaeological
Technicians Kevin Corra and Erin King. All fieldwork was supervised by project Principal
Investigator Tony Scott. The archaeological survey was conducted from February 9 to
February 20 of 2009 and required 165 person hours to complete. Archaeological deep testing
was completed on April 27, 2009 and required 16 person hours to complete. Site file research
was completed prior to fieldwork mobilization by Tony Scott. Graphics were produced by
Julia Balakirova. Report text was written by Kristi Soltysiak and Tony Scott with
contributions by Charles E. Bludau, Jr. and Sean Nash. The report was edited by Melinda
Mendoza-Scott and produced by Jessica Campbell.
HRA Gray & Pape, LLC assessed the APE for high and low probability areas. The Texas
Department of Transportation’s Houston Area Potential Archaeological Liability Map was the
primary guide for determining the boundaries of these Waller County areas. Austin County,
however, is not included in this reference. High and low probability areas within the Austin
County portion of the Area of Potential Effect were determined by employing the traditional
cultural/geomorphic models and comparing the results with the methodology employed by the
Texas Department of Transportation’s Houston area Potential Archaeological Liability Map.
A total of 248 systematic and judgmental shovel tests were excavated within the project Area
of Potential Effect composed of both existing and proposed road right-of-way making up a
total of 433.8 hectares (1072 acres) that are subsumed by the project. Systematic shovel testing
was conducted within proposed right-of-way, while judgmental shovel tests were excavated in
portions of existing right-of-way to confirm suspected disturbances. Systematic shovel testing
was conducted within all 70 hectares (173 acres) of proposed right-of-way and judgmental
shovel tests were excavated within an additional 11 hectares (27 acres) of existing right-ofway.
In addition, a total of 23 auger tests were also performed. The majority of auger tests were
excavated within new proposed right-of-way on privately owned property. All auger tests
were excavated at selected shovel test locations. All shovel tests and supplemental auger tests
were negative for prehistoric and historic-age material. To supplement the shovel/auger testing
and assess the potential for deeply buried archaeological deposits, a total of 9 deep test
trenches were excavated to the maximum reach of the mechanical excavator at 2 meters (6.6
feet) at the proposed Bessies Creek crossing. A mechanical excavator was not maneuverable
within available space at the Brazos River crossing, therefore 10 of the 23 auger tests were
placed on the riverbanks. Auger tests were excavated to a maximum depth of 2.8 meters (9.2
feet) to test for deeply buried deposits.
Walk-over survey and the excavation of judgmental shovel tests were conducted within areas
of obvious disturbance including drainage ditches, berms, and paved road construction also
proved negative for surface exposure of artifacts. Pedestrian walkover survey was conducted
over 353 hectares (872 acres) of the total project Area of Potential Effect. Survey access to

iii

several small parcels within the Area of Potential Effect was not permitted by private
landowners or landowners that could not be reached prior to survey in the effort to confirm
permitted access. This area encompasses a total of 10 hectares (24 acres) of the 434-hectare
(1,072-acre) project Area of Potential Effect.
As a result of this investigation, no archaeological resources were identified within the project
Area of Potential Effect. Based on the negative results across the 423 hectares (1,045 acres) of
project Area of Potential Effect that were accessible at the time of survey, HRA Gray & Pape,
LLC recommends that no survey be required within the small, inaccessible portions of the
project area subsuming a total of 9.7 hectares (24 acres). Based on these results, HRA Gray &
Pape, LLC recommends no further archaeological work and that the project be allowed to
proceed as planned.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
In February and April of 2009, HRA Gray & Pape, LLC (HRA Gray & Pape), of Houston,
Texas, at the request of Berg Oliver Associates, Inc., conducted an intensive pedestrian
archaeological investigation and targeted deep testing of approximately 24 kilometers (15
miles) of property proposed for the expansion of the Interstate Highway 10 (I-10) corridor in
Austin and Waller Counties, Texas.
The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) has been identified as the Lead Agency for
this project. Work for this project will be completed as part of TxDOT Project CSJ Numbers
0271-02-055 (control), 0271-03-046 and 0271-04-071 by the Houston and Yoakum Districts.
As such, the goals of the archaeological intensive pedestrian survey were to determine if the
initiation of this project would affect any previously identified historic properties as defined
by Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended (36
CFR 800), and to establish whether or not previously unidentified archaeological resources
were located within the project’s Area of Potential Effect (APE).
The NHPA of 1966 (P.L.89-665, as amended by P.L. 91-243, 93-54, 94-422, 94-458, and 96­
515) established a National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) to list properties significant in
American history, architecture, archaeology, or culture and directed the heads of federal
agencies to take into account the effect of federal or federally assisted undertakings on eligible
districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects. Executive Order 11593, Protection and
Enhancement of the Cultural Environment (1971) and the Archeological and Historic
Preservation Act of 1974 which strengthened this directive and mandated recovery,
preservation, and analysis of significant data gathered in relation to a federal undertaking.
Procedures for complying with federal regulations are given in Procedures for the Protection
of Historic and Cultural Properties (36 CFR 800) and NRHP (36 CFR 60) (United States
Department of the Interior [USDI] 1983). The steps that a federal agency must take to insure
proper review of any undertaking funded or permitted by that agency and to comply with the
requirements of Section 106 of the NHPA are elucidated by 36 CFR 800. According to 36
CFR 800 all National Register and National Register-eligible properties that may be impacted
must be identified. The Criteria of Effect (36 CFR 800.3[a]) must then be applied in
consultation with the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) to determine whether the
undertaking will have an effect on any National Register or National Register-eligible
properties. The Criteria of Adverse Effect (36 CFR. 800.3 [b]) is then to be applied to any
effected properties to determine the nature of the effect. If no adverse effect will result from
the undertaking, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) must be furnished
with documentation of this finding. If the undertaking will have an adverse effect, the agency
must consult with the ACHP and SHPO to consider alternatives that could avoid, mitigate, or
minimize the adverse effects.
The intensive pedestrian survey completed for the service areas discussed in this report took
place on easements belonging to TxDOT and privately-owned property. Right-of-entry was
obtained by the client for privately owned land. Work conducted to complete this survey was

conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit 5152, issued by the Texas Historical Commission’s
(THC) Division of Archeology in February 2009. Survey was conducted from February 9 to
February 20 of 2009 and required 165 person hours to complete. Mechanical deep testing was
completed on April 27, 2009 and required 16 person hours. All fieldwork and reporting
activities were completed with reference to state (Antiquities Code of Texas [1969, as
amended in 1997]) and federal (NHPA of 1966, as amended [36CFR 800]) guidelines as set
forth by the THC and the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA), and standards set forth by
the TxDOT Programmatic Agreement for Enhancement Projects.

1.1

Project Description

The project area is located on the Sealy, San Felipe, and Brookshire United States Geological
Survey (USGS) 7.5-Minute Quadrangle maps (Figure 1). The project begins near Little
Bernard Creek in Austin County and proceeds east along I-10, bends south around of the town
of Sealy, Texas, and continues east passing south of the town of San Felipe. The project then
crosses the Brazos River into Waller County before bending to the south of the town of
Brookshire, Texas, ending near Brookshire Creek. As planned, the proposed project will
expand the existing four-lane rural freeway to eight lanes. Proposed road expansion is
anticipated to include construction of a four-lane freeway concrete barrier-separated section
with four managed toll lanes adjacent to the freeway centerline.
The project limits will extend from Farm-to-Market (FM) Road 3538 in Sealy, Texas east
across the Brazos River to FM 359 in Brookshire, Texas (see Figure 1). The total project
length is approximately 24 kilometers (15 miles) and subsumes a total of 434 hectares (1,072
acres). The majority of the project length will involve expanding the existing right-of-way
(ROW) from 117 meters (385 feet) wide to a proposed width of 151 meters (495 feet) from the
west end of the project area east to the Brazos River with an increase of approximately 34
meters (112 feet) in new ROW. From the east side of the Brazos River to the eastern project
terminus, new ROW will be between 9 and 12 meters (28 to 38 feet) wider than the existing
ROW.
Additional project components will include converting existing one and two-way frontage
roads to one-way, replacement and widening of the Brazos River Bridge, two new frontage
road bridges at the Brazos River, and upgrading of all existing intersections. All bridge
replacements and new bridge construction will take place within existing ROW. Frontage road
bridges will measure 11 meters (36 feet) wide.
The APE for this project is defined as the project length, the existing and proposed ROW, and
the depth of construction impacts. The APE subsumes a total of 434 hectares (1,072 acres)
made up of both existing and proposed ROW. Existing ROW entails the majority of the
project APE and included 353 hectares (872 acres), while proposed ROW encompasses only
70 hectares (173 acres) of the project APE. Construction plans indicate that the proposed APE
is a 24-kilometer (15-mile) long, 140 to 151-meter (460 to 495-foot) wide linear corridor and
will cover the existing ROW and proposed ROW. The APE depth generally extends to
shallow depths across the project

ROW. More often the project entails the building up of material from the existing ground
surface. Deep impacts will be limited to bridge crossings over the Brazos River and Bessies
Creek to depths estimated at 17 meters (55 feet) deep for the placement of bridge footings.
Therefore, the estimated maximum depth of impacts within the APE is between the ground
surface and 17 meters (55 feet). These deep impacts are limited to the Brazos River and
Bessies Creek crossings. Refer to Appendix A for detailed project schematics.
The current conditions of the APE consist of mostly open pasture, some agricultural field, and
limited spans of wooded tracts. For the length of the project surface visibility is less than 10%,
being generally covered in tall grass. Portions of the highway that pass urban areas have
experienced some development including private residences and businesses. The MissouriKansas-Texas (MKT) Railroad parallels the project to the north for a distance of
approximately 12 kilometers (7 miles) from San Felipe to Brookshire. The project crosses four
different waterways: the Brazos River, Bessies Creek, fingers of Allen’s Creek and an
unnamed tributary of the Brazos River at four locations as it loops north and south of the
highway just east of the Brazos River.
It should be noted that most of the APE along this corridor traverses highway centerline and is
already disturbed to culturally sterile depths by the construction of storm sewers and related
drainage structures. It is unknown if the construction of the MKT Railroad (circa 1870) may
have caused disturbance inside what eventually became the I-10 ROW. What is known is that
the construction of the highway took place before protocols for cultural resource surveys were
put into place and therefore has not been previously surveyed.

2.0 NATURAL SETTING
The following section provides a discussion of the general geomorphological characteristics
found in southern Austin and Waller Counties, with attention paid to the area’s rivers and
streams. This is followed by discussions of soil morphology, predictive modeling, climate, and
wildlife typical of the area.

2.1 Geomorphology
The Texas Coastal Plain makes up part of the larger Gulf Coastal Plain, a low-level to gently
sloping region extending from Florida to Mexico. The Texas Coastal Plain reaches as far north
as the Ouachita uplift in Oklahoma and as far west as the Balcones escarpment in central
Texas. The basic geomorphological characteristics of the Texas coast and associated inland
areas, which includes Austin and Waller Counties, resulted from depositional conditions
influenced by the combined action of sea level changes from glacial advance in the northern
portions of the continent and subsequent downcutting and variations in the sediment load
capacity of the region’s rivers. Locally, both counties are underlain by relatively recent
sedimentary rocks and unconsolidated sediments ranging in age from the Miocene to
Holocene (Abbott 2001; Van Siclen 1991).
Although older geologic units have been identified in the region (see Abbott 2001; Barnes
1992; Van Siclen 1991), units relevant to the project area include the Willis, Lissie and
Beaumont Formations, and younger Late Pleistocene to early Holocene units such as the socalled “Deweyville” terraces, positioned stratigraphically between the Beaumont and recent
deposits. These terraces date to between one hundred thousand to four thousand years ago, and
are characterized as consisting “of up to three inset fluvial terraces…(distinguished by the
presence of)…large looping meander scars…” indicative of watercourses capable of fluvial
action and discharge markedly greater than that seen today (Abbott 2001: 16). Overlaying
these deposits are relatively thick or thin Holocene deposits, laid down in the project area by
alluvial and eolian factors. Almost the entire APE is underlain by the early to middle
Pleistocene Lissie Formation. However, a small area at the western terminus of the project
west of Bessies Creek may be underlain by Quaternary alluvium from the Brazos River.

2.2 Soils
A review of the TxDOT Houston District PALM; the latest National Web Soil Survey data;
relevant county soil guides; applicable USGS and State of Texas Bureau of Economic
Geology geologic maps; USGS topographic maps; aerial imagery (accessed online via
“http://www.usgs.gov,” “http://terraserver-usa.com,” and from other internet and archival
sources); and other materials provided by TxDOT was conducted to predict factors that might
affect site visibility and integrity during the proposed survey of the APE. National Web Soil
Survey (2008) data was accessed online.
A review of Greenwade (1984:sheets 54-56, 59-60) indicates the proposed project traverses
soils of the Katy, Hockley-Wockley-Monaville, Kenney-Tabor-Chazos, Brazoria-Norwood,
5

and Lake Charles-Midland-Edna associations (Greenwade 1984:5-12). These soil associations
have been identified in both Austin and Waller Counties (Greenwade 1984). Soils specific to
these associations are described elsewhere (see Greenwade 1984; SSS NRCS USDA 2006).

2.3 Predictive Modeling
HRA Gray & Pape assessed the APE for high and low probability areas. The Houston-PALM
was the primary guide for determining the boundaries of the portion of the APE within Waller
County. Austin County, however, is not included in this reference. High and low probability
areas within the Austin County portion of the APE were determined by employing the
traditional cultural/geomorphic/disturbance models and comparing the results with the
methodology employed by the Houston-PALM. These methodologies were largely similar and
any location that was consistent with a high probability assessment by either method was so
designated.
In Waller County, and five other counties in the Greater Houston area, data regarding these
soil associations, the landforms they occupy, cultural and natural resource distribution, and
historic and modern land use data were combined by Abbott (2001) to develop the HoustonPALM, a cultural resource management tool that predicts the likelihood of detecting deeply
buried intact cultural resources in various topographic settings around Houston (Abbott 2001).
The model also recommends the type of archaeological survey strategy that should be
implemented for a given PALM Unit, of which there are four major groupings. For HoustonPALM Unit 1, surface survey is recommended and deep reconnaissance is only recommended
if deep impacts are anticipated. For PALM Unit 2, only surface survey is recommended. For
Potential Archeological Liability Map Units 3 and 3a are similar and recommend no surface
survey, although Map Unit 3 recommends deep reconnaissance if deep impacts are
anticipated, while Map Unit 3a recommends deep reconnaissance only if severe impacts are
anticipated. For PALM Unit 4, no survey is recommended. PALM Unit 1 is analogous to
traditional high probability and Map Unit 4 is analogous to a traditional low probability
designation. Map Units 2, 3, and 3a are essentially conditional or moderate probability areas in
the traditional method.
In Waller County, Brazoria-Norwood association soils are typically mapped on landforms
associated with PALM Unit 1, while Katy, Lake Charles-Midland-Edna, Kenney-TaborChazos, and Hockley-Wockley-Monaville series soils are associated with PALM Units 2 and
4.
With respect to the project area, the entire existing project ROW in Waller County is within
mapped PALM Units 3a and 4. All project area within existing ROW west of the City of
Brookshire is classified as PALM Unit 3a, while all existing and proposed ROW within the
City of Brookshire are classified as PALM Unit 4. The entire APE west of Brookshire is
mapped as PALM Unit 1. The low probability assessment for areas within Brookshire is
assumed to reflect the widespread disturbance inside of the City of Brookshire due to previous
I-10 road construction and urban/suburban development. Geomorphic factors and soil
associations account for differences between areas east and west of the city.

6

Although, Houston-PALM Unit designations rely on a more comprehensive set of
environmental and cultural criteria, HRA Gray & Pape evaluated soils, landforms, and land
use data from Waller and Austin counties, evident in aerial imagery, topographic mapping,
and the county soils guides to provide an assessment of high and low probability for
containing archaeological sites with intact deposits. Based on this data, HRA Gray & Pape
considered whether high and low potential areas within the Austin County portion of the APE
are analogous to Houston-PALM Units within Waller County that are located in similar
environmental settings.
The result was that five locations within the project APE were considered to have a moderate
to high probability for containing intact cultural deposits within Austin and Waller Counties.
These include a small finger of Allen’s Creek, the banks of a channelized segment of Allen’s
Creek, the east and west banks of the Brazos River including an un-named looping tributary of
the Brazos River, and the east and west banks of Bessies Creek. These locations were likely to
contain deep alluvial soils that might also contain deeply buried archaeological deposits
regardless of whether construction takes place within existing or proposed ROW.
The Houston-PALM for Waller County identifies these waterway crossings as Map Unit 3a
within existing ROW and PALM Unit 1 outside of the existing ROW. Deep impacts are
expected to be entirely within the existing ROW for bridge replacement and construction over
these waterways. Since, PALM Units 1 and 3a recommend deep testing if deep impacts are
anticipated, HRA Gray & Pape’s desktop classification of these areas as high potential for
deeply buried deposits corresponds well with the Houston-PALM for Waller County.
The majority of existing and proposed ROW in Austin and Waller County was considered low
potential area due to previous I-10 road construction, as well as the presence of berms,
drainage ditches, and buried utilities and pipelines present within proposed ROW. In addition,
only shallow impacts are anticipated for general road construction. Correspondingly, these
same locations are designated as PALM Unit 3a within existing ROW and PALM Unit 1
outside of the existing ROW in Waller County. The urban/suburban areas in Brookshire
located east of Bessies Creek, are rated PALM Unit 4, no survey recommended, due to the
heavily modified landscape.
HRA Gray & Pape postulated that nearly all of the Austin County APE might be considered
equivalent to PALM Unit 3a, with the exception of the City of Sealy, which might be viewed
as correlative to Brookshire and equivalent to PALM Unit 4. The cities of Brookshire, located
in Waller County, and Sealy, located in Austin County, contain similarly built streetscapes and
are both considered to have a very low potential. HRA Gray and Pape’s postulates were based
on high/low potential desktop evaluations and by extrapolation of Houston-PALM data and
methodology as applied to Waller County. Based on our desktop assessment, this evaluation
was field-verified during the intensive pedestrian survey and results are presented in Chapter
5.0.

2.4 Natural Environment
The project area contains a variety of plant and animal life that was likely utilized by native
peoples. The following sections present discussions of some of the natural resources that may
have been used by prehistoric populations in the regions.
2.4.1 Flora and Fauna
Both counties are located near the western edge of the Austroriparian biotic province and are
situated in the Upland Prairies and Woods subregion of the Gulf Coast Prairies and Marshes
Region (Abbott 2001). Evidence from pollen analysis in Central Texas suggests that, at least
during the Late Pleistocene, the area may have been populated by vegetative species that were
tolerant of a cold weather environment. Climactic fluctuation during the Holocene would
eventually result in a gradual trend towards warmer weather, similar to that seen today (Abbott
2001).
Late Pleistocene flora may have included populations of spruce, poplar, maple, and pine
(Holloway 1997), in an oak woodland environment that would eventually transition to an oak
savanna in the late Holocene (Abbott 2001). Fauna during this time would include currently
present species such as white-tailed deer and various smaller game, as well as bison, and, in
localized areas, pronghorn sheep and the American alligator (Abbott 2001).
The modern vegetative community associated with this region consists of a diverse collection
of primarily deciduous trees and undergrowth (Abbott 2001). Modern land alteration
activities, especially those associated with agriculture, have resulted in the removal of native
plant species from the area. Identified trees may include water oak, pecan, various elms, cedar,
oaks, sweetgum, and mulberry, to name a few. Honeysuckle, dewberry, yaupon, and
blackberry are common, as are indiangrass and bluegrasses (Abbott 2001).
The modern faunal community includes mammals such as deer, squirrel, opossum, raccoon,
skunk and various small rodents, numerous bird species, and reptiles including the Texas rat
snake, the western cottonmouth, the kingsnake, and turtle species. Black bear and bison were
present occasionally in the past (Abbott 2001).
2.4.2 Climate
The climate in Austin and Waller Counties are influenced by the areas’ close proximity to the
Gulf of Mexico. Winds usually trend from the southeast or east, except during winter months
when high-pressure systems can bring in polar air from the north. Average temperatures in the
summer can reach well into the 90’s (degrees Fahrenheit), and are often accompanied by
equally high humidity. Although winter temperatures can reach into the low 30’s (degrees
Fahrenheit), below freezing temperatures usually occur on only a few days out of every year,
and are typically restricted to the early morning hours.
Rainfall is even throughout the year, with an average monthly distribution ranging from
between 101 centimeters (40 inches) to trace amounts; rainfall comes primarily from
thunderstorms (Greenwade 1984:2), which tend to be heavy but of short duration.
8

3.0 CULTURAL SETTING
Southeast Texas has traditionally been viewed as a buffer zone between cultural regions.
Patterson (1995) describes the archaeological record in this area as being an interface between
the Southern Plains and the Southeast Woodlands. Along similar lines, both Shafer (1975) and
Aten (1984) have categorized the Post-Archaic archaeological record of this region as
Woodland. This categorization is not meant to literally invoke the exact cultural patterns and
chronology of the Woodlands culture found to the east. But as Aten (1984:74) states, “it
loosely connotes activities by populations on a geographic as well as a cultural periphery of
the Southeastern Woodlands.” Under this framework the prehistoric archaeology of southeast
Texas represents a mixture of diffused technology and local innovation.
The southeast Texas region is divided into inland and coastal margin subregions, which have
archaeologically distinctive subsistence patterns, settlement patterns, and artifact types.
Archaeological and historic evidence suggests that some groups exploited inland resources
year round, while other groups spent parts of the year both inland and on the coast.
Dee Ann Story (1990) has suggested that the culture of southeast Texas is distinctive enough
so as to merit a separate designation by the Late Prehistoric. The Mossy Grove cultural
tradition is a heuristic concept based on technological similarities shared by groups in this
region. The primary marker of this technological tradition is the plain, sandy-paste Goose
Creek pottery that is found in this region from the Early Ceramic through Early Historic
periods.

3.1 Prehistoric Archaeological Time Periods
Based on aspects of material culture researchers have identified six archaeological time
periods associated with Native Americans in the region; in general, these include the
Paleoindian, Archaic (with Early, Middle, and Late subdivisions), Ceramic, Late Prehistoric,
Protohistoric, and Historic Indian. Archaeologists within the region agree on the general
framework of cultural time periods, while disagreeing on the temporal boundaries of these
periods. Patterson’s (1995) chronology, for example, includes Early Paleoindian (10,000-8000
B.C.), Late Paleoindian (8000-5000 B.C.), Early Archaic (5000-3000 B.C.), Middle Archaic
(3000-1500 B.C.), Late Archaic (1500 B.C.-A.D. 100), Early Ceramic (A.D. 100-A.D. 600),
Late Prehistoric (A.D. 600-1500), Protohistoric (A.D. 1500-1700), and the Historic Indian
(A.D. 1700-1800) periods.
In contrast, Ensor (1990) offers a southeast Texas chronology that includes Paleoindian
(10,000-8000 B.C.), Early Archaic (8000-5000 B.C.), Middle Archaic (5000-1000 B.C.), Late
Archaic (1000 B.C.-A.D. 400), Early Ceramic (A.D. 400-A.D. 800), and Late Ceramic (A.D.
800-A.D. 1750). Despite these differences, the chronologies developed by researchers are
based primarily on changes in projectile point technologies within the region and the
introduction of pottery. It is generally recognized that a broad-based hunting and gathering
lifestyle was utilized throughout all time periods.

9

3.1.1

Paleoindian

The evidence (e.g., Meltzer 1993) no longer supports the long held belief that North American
Paleoindians could be characterized as nomadic bands of big game hunters. Big game hunting
is indicated, particularly in association with Folsom. However, a more generalized hunting and
gathering subsistence is now evidenced at Paleoindian sites across Texas and the rest of North
America (e.g., Burger Bluff [41GD30] and Baker Cave).
Clovis and Folsom style intervals characterize the Paleoindian period (11,200–10,000 B.P.).
Clovis is the earliest recognized cultural horizon in central Texas. Clovis is securely dated to
between 11,200 and 10,900 B.P. in radiocarbon years. The Wilson-Leonard, Gault, and Pavo
Real sites have recently added new data to the study of these early peoples of what is now
Texas. Kincaid Rockshelter and Horn Shelter sites also have documented Clovis components.
Clovis artifacts include prismatic blades, engraved stones, bola stones, and the unique Clovis
point (Collins 1995).
The Folsom style interval is not as securely dated and appears to overlap with Clovis. The
finely retouched and fluted Folsom points are one of the most easily recognized points made
in the Americas. In Folsom times, more than at any other interval, people were specialized
hunters. Bison kills with associated Folsom points remain the typical Folsom site type. The
postulated style intervals following Folsom, known as Plainview and Dalton-San Patrice, are
not well known or clearly defined.
Wilson, Golondrina-Barber, and St. Mary’s Hall style intervals make up Collins’ (1995) late
Paleoindian subperiod. Burned rock features have been found associated with all three style
intervals of this subperiod, but they are substantially smaller and less frequent than in the
Archaic (Collins 1995).
3.1.2

Archaic Period

The mesic conditions of the Paleoindian period come to an end during the early subperiod of
the Archaic. With the exception of the Bell-Andice-Calf Creek interval of the middle Archaic
subperiod, this was a more xeric time for Central Texas and the surrounding regions. A jump
in the number of ground stone tools, specifically manos, and metates suggests an increased
reliance on plant resources (Collins 1995).
Three sub-periods have been defined for the Central Texas Archaic: (1) Early, (2) Middle, and
(3) Late (Collins 1995). Early Archaic sites (8800–6000 B.P.) are recognized by the presence
of Angostura, Early Split Stem, and Martindale-Uvalde points. Unifacial Clear Fork tools and
Guadalupe bifaces are found in Early Archaic sites along with ground stone tools and other
bifacial and unifacial implements.
During the first interval (6000–5000 B.P.) of the Middle Archaic subperiod the climate is
somewhat more mesic. Bison populations soared. By 5000 B.P., the Bison had dwindled and
the climate had become more xeric again. The last thousand years of the Middle Archaic
(5000–4000 B.P.) are divided into two style intervals, Taylor and Nolan-Travis.

10

The Late Archaic (4000–1300 B.P.) began during a xeric period. There was, however, a steady
increase in effective moisture until it peaked in the later part of the Late Archaic (Collins
1995). Bison returned with the rise of effective moisture. Six style intervals are recognized for
the late Archaic: (1) Bulverde, (2) Pedernales-Kinney, (3) Lange-Marshall-Williams, (4)
Marcos-Montell-Castroville, (5) Ensor-Frio-Fairland, and (6) Darl.
Much of what is know about the Early Archaic peoples indicates that they were small, isolated
bands of hunter-gatherers that remained in relatively restricted regions (Aten 1984). Early
Archaic peoples continue a broad spectrum strategy of hunting of smaller game such as
rabbits, squirrels, and deer. They are believed to have hunted bison opportunistically.
Foraging for shell fish, fruit, nuts, and plants was a significant source of nutrition. Smaller dart
type points characterize this time period. Diagnostic designs for this period are Dalton, San
Patrice, Angostura, Golondrina, Merserve, Scottsbluff, Wells, Hoxie, Gower, Uvalde,
Martindale, Bell, Andice, Baird, and Taylor (Turner and Hester 1993). These points are much
more crudely made than their Paleo precursors, but remain designed for use on a spear shaft.
The Middle Archaic period saw the largest growth in technology and in the number of stone
tools utilized. Specialized tools appeared for the milling of wild plant foodstuffs (Culberson
1993) along with a large assortment of tools for food preparation and procurement. Gravers,
scrapers, axes and choppers, knives, drills, and polished stone tools, also known as ground
stone tools began to appear in large quantities (Newcomb 1961). Diagnostic points such as
Gary, Kent, Palmillas, Nolan, Travis, Belvedere, Pedernales, Marshall, Williams, and Lange
dominate the spectrum of dart points from the Middle Archaic period (Turner and Hester
1993; see also the Edwards Plateau Aspect [Newcomb 1961]). The advent of the atlatl also
seems to be placed within this period (Culberson 1993).
The Late Archaic period saw a dramatic increase in the population densities of Native
American groups. Human habitation of areas rich in diverse flora and fauna intensified, as did
the variety of materials and artifacts (Culberson 1993; Aten 1984). Late Archaic peoples
began relying heavily on foraging tubers, berries, and nuts and hunting small game such as
deer, rabbits, and raccoons, as well as fish and shellfish and birds. Groups became socially
more complex than earlier periods and the result was an increasing intercommunication with
neighboring groups. Culberson (1993:55) states that a “Lapidary Industry” developed in which
stone artifacts were made from exotic materials (jasper, hematite, quartz, shale, slate, etc.)
acquired from sources great distances away. These materials were fashioned into an
increasingly complex array of household goods such as celts, plummets, banner stones,
mortars and pestles, and pendants; also during this period there is an increase in the occurrence
of sandstone bowls (Culberson 1993). Diagnostic points of this period are difficult to
distinguish from those of the Middle Archaic. Gary and Kent points remain prevalent in
southeast Texas, while other points such as Marcos, Montell, San Gabriel, Mahomet, Fairland,
and Castroville also appear at times (Turner and Hester 1993).
3.1.3

Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric Periods

The transitional period between Late Archaic and Woodland-Late Prehistoric is a period
marked by an intensification of group dynamics across Texas. Turner and Hester (1993) see
the first signs of village sites in the lower Pecos valley as well as the preliminary stages of
11

Caddo development in the east. The advent of the bow and arrow is believed by most (Aten
1984; Culberson 1993; Newcomb 1961; Turner and Hester 1993) to be from this period,
though some may place it later. Most importantly for archaeological investigations, the first
signs of pottery begin to emerge at sites from this period. Although the amount and variety of
pottery intensifies during the Late Prehistoric, it is an excellent way of determining the
terminus post quem of a site. Fishing, bison hunting, and the collection of wild flora intensifies
beyond the level of the Late Archaic period during this stage, but there is no sufficient data to
demonstrate the initial advent of sedentary agricultural. The diagnostic points of this period
are Catahoula, Friley, Alba, and Bonham (Turner and Hester 1993).
The Late Prehistoric (also known as Woodland and Ceramic Periods) continue from the end of
the Archaic period to the historic period ushered in by the Spanish Missions and AngloAmerican settlers. During this period there is a shift to the almost total use of arrow points
such as Perdiz and Scallorn (Turner and Hester 1993), and almost every group now has
pottery. According to Aten (1984), there are nearly 18 different types of pottery from this
period currently identified for the east Texas Coast alone based on temper, paste, and design.
It is during this period that peoples known today as the Caddo, Atakapans, and Bidai, to name
a few, are identifiable both culturally and materially. This is mostly due to the historical
sources of the seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries that aid in the reconstruction of the
past cultures in the area.
In order to better understand the complexity of the region’s cultures, researchers turn to
historical sources to get an understanding of the peoples who first occupied the southeast
Texas. Hernando De Soto encountered the Native Americans of the region during his
expedition in 1542 (Hudson 1976); it was the first recorded meeting with the Caddo peoples.
The first expeditions by La Salle in 1687 and the subsequent settlement in the eighteenth
century by Europeans continued to document the presence of Native American groups in the
area (Aten 1984). French traders and Spanish missionaries encountered the Hasinai, also
known as the Neches Angelina, who became allies of the Spanish against the western Apache
tribes (Newcomb 1961). The later historical sources identify the Hisinai as one of the two
main groups in the area of eastern Texas that fall under the Caddo culture (the primary culture
that dominated the Piney Woods area), the other of which is the Kadohadacho (La Vere 1998;
Gregory 1986).
The Atakapans, dominated the majority of the land northeast of the project area. Their
language group extended from the Gulf coast to the Trinity and San Jacinto Rivers and they
had much in common with the coastal group known as the Karankawas (Aten 1984). The
Atakapans were subdivided into regional groups. The Akokisas dwelled primarily on the
shores of the Trinity and San Jacinto Rivers. The Patiri group occupied the land north of the
San Jacinto valley. The Bidais group dominated the Trinity Valley and to their north was the
small group known as the Deadoso. Most of what is known about the Atakapans culture comes
from the early accounts of the French explorer DeBellise.
In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Spanish and French used the Native American
groups as pawns in the two nations’ quest to settle the area (Newcomb 1961). Most destructive
for all native groups in the region was the influx of European diseases. When Anglo-American
12

settlers began moving into the area in mass around the 1850s, disease and warfare had
decimated the groups to near extinction.

3.2 Historic Period Development
3.2.1

Austin County

A review of the Handbook of Texas Online (Jackson 2008) indicated the following about
Austin County’s historical development. European exploration of modern day Austin County
most likely began in 1686 with René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, and his attempt to
reach the Mississippi River. La Salle may have crossed the San Bernard River near the
location of modern day Orange Hill during his 1686 expedition and again during his lifeending 1687 expedition. Spanish exploration of the area is first credited to Governor Alonzo
De León of Coahuila, whose pursuit of La Salle may have led his expedition through the area.
De León returned to what is now Austin County in 1690 to help establish a religious mission
for the Tejas Indians. Other noted Spanish expeditions occurred in 1718, 1727, and 1767.
These expeditions followed the La Bahía Road, which was originally an Indian trace. The
Atascosito Road, which connected Refugio and Goliad with Atascosito, was also constructed
by the Spanish through modern Austin County (Jackson 2008).
The area was first settled by Americans in the 1820s, as the boundaries of present-day Austin
County were part of Stephen F. Austin’s first colony. The colonists, primarily southern slave
owners, settled on the banks of the Brazos River and established cotton plantations. San Felipe
de Austin, the unofficial capital of Austin’s colony, was established in 1832. The settlement
rapidly became the colony’s central hub. The Cummins family constructed a water-powered
saw and grist mill in the area in the 1820s, marking the arrival of industry. Cotton gins were
also constructed shortly afterwards. The settlers sent their products to market via steamboats
on the Brazos River (Jackson 2008).
Modern day Austin County served as the site of many important events during the Texas
Revolution. San Felipe de Austin served as the site of the conventions of 1832 and 1833. The
town also served as the site of the Consultation of 1835, and as the temporary capital of the
government until the Convention of 1836 at Washington-on-the-Brazos. Sam Houston’s army
camped near San Felipe de Austin after the Alamo before marching toward modern day
Waller County. Moseley Baker and his garrison ordered San Felipe de Austin evacuated in
March of 1836, and then burned the settlement to keep it from falling under the control of the
Mexican Army during the Runaway Scrape. The Mexican Army skirmished briefly with
Baker’s men before plundering the eastern portion of modern Austin County (Jackson 2008).
Austin County was formed in 1837, and Bellville was named county seat in 1846. The county
witnessed an influx of population from Germany after the Texas Revolution, which led to the
founding of new settlements, such as Industry and Cat Springs. While many products were
transported by steam boat, some products were shipped to the tracks of the Houston and Texas
Central Railroad in Hempstead (in modern Waller County) via wagon (Jackson 2008).

13

The Civil War fostered fears of slave uprisings, and in 1859 the county started a system of
patrols in an effort to assuage these fears. The German population was reluctant to fight for the
Confederate cause as many came to Texas to avoid military service in their native country.
These tensions came to a boiling point when martial law was declared in Austin, Colorado,
and Fayette Counties in 1836, to end opposition to conscription by German immigrants.
Several arrests were made and the uprising was quickly put down (Jackson 2008).
Hempstead was occupied by Union troops under the command of George Armstrong Custer in
1865. Custer served as commander of the Union troops until October of the following year,
and a detachment of Union Soldiers remained to oversee the community and protect the
former slave population. Violence against the African-American population was commonplace
during reconstruction, as too few troops and an uncaring legal system levied little punishments
for the perpetrators of these crimes. Despite this atmosphere, the former slave population
established their own churches and other institutions. The Freedmen’s bureau established the
first African-American School in 1869 (Jackson 2008).
Like many counties in Texas, Austin County’s economy was devastated by the Civil War.
The large plantations were broken up and operated as small tenant farms. Production levels
dropped dramatically. Cotton production was slowly supplemented with cattle, swine, and
sheep ranching. Poultry and egg production became important industries as well. Beginning
with the Gulf, Colorado, and Santa Fe Railway in the 1870s, the construction of railroads
through the county helped the county’s economy recover by providing reliable transportation
for the county’s products. Cotton production was slowly replaced with other truck crops and
animal feed crops from the end of the Civil War to the Great Depression (Jackson 2008).
Austin County remained primarily an agricultural county during the two World Wars. The
county lost some of its population to the defense industries in nearby Houston, and the
county’s agricultural products found new markets during the war, and new industries were
established in the county. Oil was discovered in the county in 1915, but significant production
did not occur until the Raccoon Bend oilfield was discovered in 1927. Austin County, like
many counties in the Houston region, saw an increase in population as the area spread outward
during the 1960s. Despite this, the county remains predominantly involved in agricultural
pursuits (Jackson 2008).
3.2.2

Waller County

A review of the Handbook of Texas Online (Christian and Leffler 2008), indicated the
following about Waller County’s historical development. Waller County was sparsely
populated by Native Americans when Europeans first began exploring the area in the 1800s.
The county was noted to have large herds of wild horses, free roaming cattle, as well as deer
and chickens. Governmental authority for the area during Mexican rule was originally held by
the Municipality of Washington, but was later held by Washington County and then Austin
County. The Mexican Government granted the lands which comprise modern-day Waller
County to Stephen F. Austin as a part of his original colony. Austin’s colonists began to settle
in the area around 1820. Jared Groce settled within the boundaries of modern day Waller
County in 1821. He settled on the Bernardo Plantation, just four miles west of present day
Hempstead. Groce, a large slaveholder, grew cotton and in 1825 he constructed the first cotton
14

gin in Texas. Groce’s plantation quickly became the center of settlement in the area after he
added a commissary and blacksmith’s shop to his plantation (Christian and Leffler 2008). By
1845, Groce and other settlers made the Brazos River a wealthy cotton-growing region. The
population of the area consisted of roughly 200 Caucasians and more than 1,000 slaves. The
area’s continued development was rapidly increased by the construction of the Houston and
Texas Central Railway in 1858. The railroad provided fast and reliable transportation to the
cotton market’s of Houston, and prompted the founding of Hempstead in 1858. Hempstead
became the commercial center of the area and it rapidly became the most important settlement
in the area because of the railroad link to Houston. The town’s importance was further
emphasized in 1861, when Washington County Rail Road connected it with community of
Brenham (Christian and Leffler 2008).
Hempstead was a center of manufacturing and supply for the Confederacy during the Civil
War. The military encampments of Carter, Groce, and Herbert were located near Hempstead,
and a military hospital was established in the town to care for wounded soldiers. The town was
a staunch supporter of the Confederate cause, evidence by the imprisonment and exile of Dr.
Richard R. Peebles, a founder of Hempstead who spoke out against the war. The town was
occupied by Union troops under the command of George Armstrong Custer in 1865. Custer
served as commander of the Union troops until October of the following year. The cottonbased economy of the area suffered greatly after the emancipation of the slave population.
Many of the large plantations were broken apart, and cotton production levels severely
decreased. The African-American population was politically active during Reconstruction,
and many freedmen were elected to state and local offices. A race riot broke out in 1868,
disrupting the generally peaceful relationship between the people of Hempstead and the Union
troops stationed there (Christian and Leffler 2008).
Waller County was created in 1873 by the Texas Legislature form parts of Austin and Grimes
Counties, and Hempstead was made the county seat. The continued development of railroads
within the county prompted new settlements and facilities. The construction of the Texas
Western Narrow Gauge Railroad in 1878 prompted the founding of Pattison. Prairie View
State Normal School, now Prairie View A&M, was founded in 1879 as an institution of higher
learning focused on training African-American educators. An influx of settlers from Germany,
Ireland, Italy, and other Central and Eastern European Countries occurred during the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The influx of these divergent ethnic groups also
diversified the counties religious faiths, as the first synagogue was founded in 1873. The
construction of the MKT Railroad through Brookshire in 1893 resulted in a vast expansion of
that community. The railroad also encouraged the development of the town of Waller, which
was founded in 1898 (Christian and Leffler 2008).
Racial tensions in Waller County resurfaced after Reconstruction, as the white minority sought
legal and extralegal means to reduce African-American voting power. A White Man’s Party
was founded in the 1880s to reduce black political power and violence often marked elections.
The end of Reconstruction and increasing intimidation by whites effectively reduced AfricanAmerican political participation. The passage of the state white primary law effectively
disenfranchised the African-American population in 1903. Students at Prairie View A&M

became politically active in the 1960s, forcing businesses to integrate and successfully
challenging obstacles to their enfranchisement in the 1970s.
Cotton cultivation steadily declined in the twentieth century as truck farming became more
profitable. Federal regulations enacted during the Depression encouraged this trend, and many
of Waller County’s cotton gins closed down. Rice became the county’s most important crop
after World War II, as well as watermelon and egg production. Cattle ranching also became
important in the post-war era. Oil was discovered in 1934, but production has been fairly
limited. The county’s population began growing in the 1960s because of its close proximity to
the City of Houston (Christian and Leffler 2008).

4.0 RESEARCH DESIGN AND FIELD SURVEY METHODS
Prehistoric archaeological sites identified in the inland regions of the Gulf Coastal Plain tend
to be composed of ephemeral, shallow deposits reflecting short-term occupation episodes. In
general, these sites consist of temporally non-diagnostic lithic scatters, thin subsurface
deposits, or suggest the presence of multiple cultural components within a mixed stratigraphic
archaeological context. Historic sites near the project area typically consist of farms or
homesteads dating to the late nineteenth or early twentieth centuries. However, San Felipe de
Austin (Site 41AU2), the First Anglo-American Capital of Texas lies only five kilometers
(three miles) north of the project area, along the west bank of the Brazos River (see Figure 1).
The primary problem facing researchers working on prehistoric sites in this region stems from
a dearth of cleanly stratified deposits. Environmental conditions leading to slow soil
development combined with rapid urbanization in many areas of southeast Texas have
complicated the already difficult task of reconstructing cultural traditions and developing
chronologies associated with the highly mobile lifeways of the prehistoric hunter-gatherer
populations formerly inhabiting this area.

4.1 Research Design
This intensive pedestrian survey was designed to identify and preliminarily assess
archaeological resources that may be impacted by the proposed project. Potential buried and
surface archaeological resources fall within the purview of this investigation.
The project area includes mostly disturbed highway ROW associated with the east and west
bound lanes of I-10 as well as associated berms, drainage ditches, sewers, and other outfall
structures. Therefore, investigations within the project APE were designed to inspect the entire
ROW, but focus intensive survey efforts within undisturbed portions of the APE. Aerial
photography of the project area was examined and a reconnaissance windshield survey was
conducted prior to the walkover and intensive surveys to identify severely disturbed areas.
These areas were tested via the placement of judgmental shovel tests and supplemental auger
tests to verify surface and subsurface disturbances. Using the information obtained from the
Houston-PALM, available soils data, topography, and proximity to natural water resources,
intensive pedestrian archaeological survey methods including systematic shovel testing,
bucket-augering, and targeted mechanical deep testing were used to assess potentially
undisturbed areas primarily situated within proposed ROW.

4.2 Literature Review and Site File Research Strategy
Site file research was initiated by reviewing records maintained by the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas, and by consulting on-line research archives
maintained by the THC. Site file research resulted in a listing of all previously recorded
archaeological sites within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the project area. Site file research was
used to provide a historic context to the archaeological survey, and additional documentary

17

research was conducted in order to provide an understanding of the development and history
of the APE, the surrounding area, and southeast Texas in general.
4.2.1

Archaeological Field Methods

The intensive pedestrian archaeological investigations conducted within the project APE were
designed to define all sites, prehistoric and historic, within the defined project boundaries. In
addition to site identification, the intensive pedestrian investigations were aimed at collecting
sufficient data to determine whether or not additional investigations would be required to
evaluate fully the potential eligibility of any newly defined site location for inclusion on the
NRHP.
HRA Gray & Pape developed a predictive model for this project by outlining a set of high and
low potential areas within the APE according to the Houston-PALM and a set of
environmental data such as soils, proximity to waterways, topography, and land use. High
potential areas, thought to be undisturbed were to be tested more intensively than the
remainder of the project area as these areas were considered to have a high potential for
containing archaeological deposits relative to other areas. High potential areas in Waller
County were considered to be areas adjacent to the Brazos River, Bessies Creek, and an un­
named looping tributary of the Brazos River. Although all bridge replacement activities are to
be conducted within existing ROW, these areas have been classified as PALM Unit 3a in
Waller County, and deep impacts are anticipated at these locations, particularly at the river and
Bessies Creek. Methods used to survey high potential areas are described below.
HRA Gray & Pape postulated that nearly all of the Austin County APE might be considered
equivalent to PALM Unit 3a, with the exception of the City of Sealy, which might be
equivalent to PALM Unit 4. The suggestion that the Austin County portion of the APE might
contain areas that could be considered the equivalent to Houston-PALM ratings was based on
our high/low potential desktop assessments, similar soils, and overall environmental sameness
of the APE within Austin and Waller counties. These notions were field-verified using the
reconnaissance-level and intensive pedestrian survey methods discussed below.
The archaeological survey strategy was designed to test the predictive model and determine
whether certain portions of the APE located outside of the Houston-PALM area could be
considered equivalent to PALM area ratings. Intensive archaeological survey methods utilized
during this investigation consisted of systematic subsurface testing along linear transects and
mechanical deep testing within undisturbed area and areas flagged as high potential within the
APE. Reconnaissance investigations were conducted via windshield survey, pedestrian walkover,
and judgmental shovel testing to identify severely disturbed locations and areas flagged as low
potential. These methods and corresponding results were used to develop support for or discredit
the predictive model developed for this project.
All pedestrian survey was conducted along linear survey transects on both sides of the I-10
ROW and sometimes in wide areas between lanes of traffic. In general, Survey Transect A
was placed along the south side of I-10 roadway. Survey of Transect B was conducted parallel
to Transect A where the project APE was wide enough to warrant an additional survey
transect. Transect C was placed on the north side of I-10. Survey along all transects was also
18

begun at the west end of the APE and proceeded east toward the west bank of the Brazos
River.
Survey within low and high potential areas was conducted along one or more parallel transects as
described above. A combination of windshield (drive-by), walkover survey, and limited
judgmental shovel testing was performed within the low potential areas, including PALM Units
3a and 4 in Waller County, unless deep impacts were anticipated. Although no surface survey is
recommended within PALM Unit 3a, judgmental shovel tests were excavated to determine the
degree of previous disturbance and test the similarity of the APE in Austin and Waller
counties. These reconnaissance-level methods were also utilized within previously disturbed
areas including existing ROW where previously constructed roadway was present, along railroad
tracks, berms, drainage ditches, and areas containing standing water. Information concerning the
environmental and topographic conditions identified during walkover survey was recorded.
All project components within existing I-10 ROW or within city limits, such as Brookshire and
Sealy, were considered low to very low potential. In general, low potential areas were those
locations designated PALM Units 3a and 4 in Waller County, areas further than 200 meters (656
feet) from the banks of natural waterways, areas containing previous disturbances such as
evidence of belowground construction impacts and extant modern buildings, low-lying
topography likely not favorable as living surfaces to prehistoric groups, and soils with low­
geoarchaeological potential as outlined by Abbott (2001).
Shovel testing and bucket-augering within the limited, undisturbed, high potential portions of the
APE was typically limited to within areas of proposed ROW. In general, shovel testing exceeded
Texas minimum survey standards for linear projects with the excavation of more than 17 shovel
tests excavated per mile, or an excess of 1 shovel test every 100 meters (300 feet). A total of 248
shovel tests and 23 auger tests were excavated. Additional shovel tests were planned, although
disturbances precluded the excavation of many. Survey within high potential areas included
shovel test excavation and supplemental auger testing at intervals ranging between 60 and 30
meters (200 and 100 feet). Shovel tests were typically excavated to a maximum depth of 30 to
100 centimeters (1 to 3 feet) into the underlying substratum, or until culturally sterile subsoil was
encountered. Shovel testing was conducted within 70 hectares (173 acres) of privately-owned
proposed ROW, and within 11 hectares (27 acres) of existing ROW. Removed soils were
screened through 0.64-centimeter (0.25-inch) hardware cloth when possible. Soils with high clay
content were sorted by trowel. Descriptions of soil texture and color followed standard
terminology and the Munsell (2000) soil color charts. The results of the subsurface test
activities were recorded on individual shovel test forms for each excavation.
Auger tests were excavated below the base of selected shovel tests to a maximum depth of 2.8
meters (9.2 feet) near the Brazos River and an average depth of 2 meters (6 feet). Auger tests
measured 10 centimeters (4 inches) in diameter. The treatment of soils removed from augers
was identical to that for shovel tests, and information concerning the auger tests was recorded on
standardized shovel test forms for each shovel test/auger excavation.

19

Areas under existing bridges were inspected to determine if they contained intact soils by
using a combination of deep testing techniques. Three complementary approaches were used
to provide data on the likelihood of the presence of deeply buried A-horizons and cultural
deposits within the project area: cutbank inspection, shovel/auger testing, and mechanical deep
testing.
Cutbank inspection associated with this project consisted of examining cutbanks along the
Brazos River and Bessies Creek for slope, height above water level, composition (e.g. soil,
alluvium), erosional features (slumps, cutbanks), vegetation, and cultural remains. In several
instances the profile of a cutbank was measured, much as one would measure a sidewall
profile in an excavation unit. The scarp or cutbank was scraped with a trowel or flat shovel to
reveal underlying stratigraphy. Stratigraphy was compared with existing descriptions of local
soils and sediments (Greenwade 1984).
Mechanical backhoe excavation was not possible at the Brazos River crossing due to the
narrow space available for heavy machinery to traverse. Therefore, the only safe alternative at
the Brazos River crossing was to sample the banks via manual bucket-augering. A total of 10
auger tests were excavated at the Brazos River. Auger tests at the banks of the Brazos River
were excavated to the maximum reach of the tool at 2.8 meters (9.2 feet). Augering was used
to explore deep soil characteristics at selected shovel test locations near the Brazos River.
Unlike the Brazos River locations, mechanical deep testing was viable at the Bessies Creek
crossing. A total of 9 trenches were excavated using a rubber-tired backhoe at locations where
shovel testing resulted in deep sandy soils overlain by clayey deposits, typical of ancient
meander point bars.
The trenches were designed for human entry, and applicable standards adopted by the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Texas Health and Safety
Code were observed. Every trench that was excavated to a depth exceeding 120 centimeters
(47 inches) was evaluated by a Competent Person and classified as an OSHA Class A, B, or C
trench. This was done to determine if the trenches could be safely entered for inspection. Each
of the 9 trenches was classified as either an OSHA Class B or Class C trench.
All mechanically excavated trenches measured a minimum of 10 meters (30 feet) in length and
approximately 1 meter (3 feet) wide. Trenches were excavated to an average depth of 2 meters
(6.5 feet). Samples of trench backfill were hand sifted and samples of alluvial deposits were
screened using 0.64-centimeter (0.25-inch) hardware cloth. After each 20-centimeter (8-inch)
bucket-full of soil was removed, the walls and floors of the trenches were monitored for
changes in soil color or texture potentially related to the presence of cultural features. At least
one wall of each trench was profiled and photographed. Soil profiles observed in all trenches
were described using tested approaches for describing basic soil properties (Munsell 2000;
Schoenberger et al. 2002; Vogel 2002).

Site Definition and Laboratory Methods

Cultural resources, if located, were to be defined according to THC standards as referenced in
13 TAC 26.20 of the Antiquities Code of Texas, as amended (THC 1969, amended 1997).
However, no artifacts, historic or prehistoric, were recovered during these field investigations.
Therefore, site definition and laboratory methods are not included in this report.

5.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS
No previously unrecorded archaeological sites were located during survey conducted within
the I-10 roadway expansion project APE. The results of the site file research are discussed
below, followed by a discussion of the results of the archaeological field investigations.

5.1 Results of Site File and Literature Research
Site file research was conducted at TARL and supplemented by consulting on-line research
archives maintained by the THC. Research efforts produced a listing of all recorded
archaeological sites within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the APE and all recorded historic
structures eligible for NRHP listing located immediately adjacent to the projects’ APE.
As part of the literature search, HRA Gray & Pape created a series of tables to document
previously identified resources located within a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile) radius of the project
area. Table 1 includes information on cultural resources recorded near the project area. Data
included in this table consists of site number, site name, site type, 7.5’ topographic quadrangle
map, site size, cultural affiliation, National Register status, and distance from the APE. The
location of these previous project areas were plotted on copies of relevant topographic maps,
and photocopies were made of the pertinent portions of the reports.
The site file and literature review did not result in the identification of recorded archaeological
historic properties (sites) within the APE as defined in Section 1.1. Four recorded
archaeological historic properties were identified within a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile) radius of the
APE. These resources consisted of prehistoric and historic period archaeological sites. No
previously recorded architectural resources or NRHP properties were located within the APE
boundaries of the current project.

Discussion of Known Archaeological Sites

There are 4 previously recorded archaeological sites (41WL2, 41WL7, 41WL9, and 41WL22)
within the study radius. It should be noted that 1 architectural resource (NRS79—20776) is
also present in the study radius; however, architectural survey was outside the scope of this
project. The site file research also indicated that several cultural resource surveys have been
conducted within or near the project area (see Figure 1).
Sites 41WL2 and 41WL9 most likely represent records for portions of the same site, a large
open campsite located in the subsurface on an eastern terrace of Bessies Creek (see Figure 1).
Site 41WL2 was originally recorded by Howard (1970). Howard reported that the site was
excavated for the purpose of collecting dart points by its owner and others. Artifacts consisting
of pottery fragments and lithics, including perforators and Gary and Pedernales dart points
recovered at depths of 38 centimeters (15 inches) by the owner, were shown to Howard (1970)
and recorded.
According to Obrien (1972), Site 41WL9 was recorded in the same area as 41WL2 by
Dillehay and Mallouf of the Texas Archaeological Survey (TAS) in 1972. At that time it had
been deep plowed for the expressed purpose of obtaining projectile points. They recovered
debitage, a biface fragment, and burned clay, but noted that their “informants have every type
point imaginable, arrow and dart and pottery [and that] dart points outnumber arrow points at
23

last 20-1” (Obrien 1972:1). The TAS investigators recommended further investigation of the
site, despite damage caused by looting and construction of a road through the site due to the
large quantity of diagnostic materials observed in local collections (Obrien 1972).
Site 41WL7 was recorded by Moore (1972) as a mixed historic and prehistoric scatter located
on a sandy hill. Surface collection and a subsurface test of site produced debitage, 2 projectile
points, a point fragment, and 7 cut “square” nails. No further work was recommended,
apparently due to mixing of the cultural deposits (Moore 1972).
Site 41WL22, the Gassner Site, was recorded by Kendall (1994) as a Middle to Late Archaic
site located on a sandy portion of the sloping eastern valley wall of the Brazos River Valley
near its confluence with Bessies Creek (see Figure 1). The site is circular, measuring
approximately 15 meters (50 feet) in diameter. The date for the site is derived from a dart
point (Kent) and the fact that it has only produced lithic materials including small numbers of
preforms, unifacial tools, utilized flakes, and hammer stones.
5.1.2

Discussion of Nearby Historic Markers

There are a total of 8 Historic Markers recorded within a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile) radius of the
project, 4 of which are located in the City of Brookshire (see Figure 1: see Table 1). Historic
Marker Number 9375 is located at the corner of 5th & Velasco Streets in Brookshire. Marker
number 9375 is dedicated to Captain Nathen Brookshire, a participant in the assault and
capture of Bexar, between December 5th and 10th, 1835.
Historic Marker number 9379 is located at the Donigan House, a historic neoclassical style
1910 home built by Turkish immigrant Dr. Paul Donigan. The Donigan House is located at the
corner of 5th Street and Cooper Street in Brookshire. Historic Marker number 9383 is located
at the site of the First Methodist Church of Brookshire at 707 Cooper Street. The building is of
modern construction and the marker commemorates the involvement of the Methodist Church
in the greater Brookshire area since 1844 when the Union Chapel Methodist Church was
founded in nearby Pittsville. The last of the 4 historical markers in Brookshire is Marker
number 9391 and is located immediately west of the intersection of United States Highway 90
(US 90) and FM 1489. It commemorates the Kellner Townsite, the first town in the area,
which was platted in 1893 by John G. Kellner (1846-1933) and has since been renamed
Brookshire.
Historic Marker 2075, dedicated to the Frydek Catholic Cemetery in the town of Frydek,
Texas, was erected in 1991 to mark the historic Czech immigrant settlement in the 1850s and
first official Czech cemetery in Frydek consecrated in 1890.
Historic Markers 2326 and 4451 are located in the heart of downtown Sealy, north of the
project APE. Marker 2326 is dedicated to the unique architecture of the home of Sealy
residents Paul and Mahala Hackbath in 1991. The home was completed in 1911 and is a last
remaining example of the historic use of concrete blocks to erect local buildings. Marker 4451,
located adjacent to the historic Hackbarth home, is dedicated to Sealy’s Saint John’s Episcopal
Church. The church congregation was founded in 1885 and the first of its religious buildings

24

was completed in 1889, although it was later destroyed by the hurricane of 1900. A new
church was constructed at the same location in 1910.
Located on FM 1458, north of the I-10 highway, is Historic Marker number 4536. This marks
the location of San Felipe de Austin, the first Anglo-American capital of Texas, founded in
1828 by the Austin Colony. San Felipe de Austin was the home of Texas historical figures
Stephen F. Austin, William Travis Barret, and Sam Houston.
5.1.3

Discussion of Previous Investigations

A total of 5 previously recorded cultural resources investigations have been conducted within
a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile) radius of the project area (see Figure 1). The earliest of these surveys
were conducted in 1981 on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These
surveys were conducted in the town of Sealy near the east end of the current project area (see
Figure 1). Though the surveys did not result in the identification of new resources, there is
little additional information available regarding these investigations.
In 1988, a linear survey was conducted near the far-east end of the current project area on
behalf of the Bureau of Land Management (see Figure 1). Like the EPA surveys, this
investigation did not result in the identification of new archaeological sites within the 1.6kilometer (1-mile) study radius. In 1996, SWCA Environmental Consultants, Inc. conducted
linear archaeological investigations at the behest of the United States Army Corps of
Engineers near the west side of the current project area. This survey produced negative results
for cultural resources.
The most recently conducted survey was performed by HRA Gray & Pape in 2005 (Pickering
2005) just south of the town of Sealy near the east end of the current project area (see Figure
1). The block area survey was conducted on 15 hectares (36 acres) of privately owned
property for the construction of a proposed Super Wal-Mart shopping center. The project area
was described as having suffered many prior disturbances including agricultural activities,
creek channelization, as well as parking lot and road construction. This survey also produced
negative results.
5.1.4

Discussion of Previous Neighborhood Surveys

Research in the Texas Archaeological Atlas On-Line indicates that there also are 23
neighborhood surveys (NHS) recorded within a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile) radius of the project.
Eighteen of these (NHS#: 3001000400; NHS#: 3001000401; NHS#: 3001000402; NHS#:
3001000405; NHS#: 3001000406; NHS#: 3001000411; NHS#: 3001000412; NHS#:

3001000469; NHS#: 3001000470; and NHS#: 3001005970) were conducted in Sealy, 4
(NHS#: 3001003948; NHS#: 3001003950; NHS#: 3001003962; and NHS#: 3001003965) in
Brookshire, and 1 (NHS#: 3001005858) in Frydek. All of the neighborhood surveys are
located well beyond the APE and are not discussed further here.

25

5.2 Results of Intensive Pedestrian Survey
Survey activities were designed to assess the potential impact that the proposed construction
might have on archaeological resources located within the proposed project area. As
previously discussed in Chapters 2.0 and 4.0, the Houston-PALM does not directly apply to
Austin County and therefore, the western portion of the APE. Since the project area within
Waller and Austin counties are set in similar environments, Houston-PALM data from Waller
County was used as a model to develop an appropriate survey strategy in Austin County that
would provide the highest probability for encountering archaeological sites. The traditional
methods of designating high and low probability areas were also employed and the results
were comparable. These methodologies proved to be largely similar and any location that was
consistent with a high probability assessment by either method was so designated. The
following application of the Houston-PALM methodology to the project area in Austin County
was field-verified by using similar survey techniques as were used in Waller County. The
results demonstrated that the application of the Houston-PALM methods and the traditional
methods provide similar predictions. The negative results of the survey were insufficient to
provide any conclusions about the effectiveness of either method.
All areas within the existing project ROW in Austin County were considered PALM Unit 3a
equivalent because present soils and the construction of the I-10 highway in Austin County
appear to closely resemble that in most of the Waller County portion of the APE. Areas
outside of the existing ROW in Austin County may also be given equivalent PALM ratings to
those in Waller County. PALM Unit 1 was used to characterize all new proposed ROW within
4.8 kilometers (3 miles) west of the Brazos River, since these areas were likely to contain deep
alluvial soils. Finally, the city of Sealy may be considered equivalent to PALM Unit 4 due to
the presence of urban/suburban development.
Survey techniques included a combination of reconnaissance-level walkover, windshield
survey, conventional intensive pedestrian survey techniques, and targeted mechanical deep
testing. All investigations were negative for surficial and subsurface archaeological deposits.
All but a few inaccessible lots, totaling 423 hectares (1,045 acres) of the 434-hectare (1,072acre) project APE were investigated employing one or more of these techniques. A total of
248 shovel tests, 23 auger tests, and 9 mechanically excavated deep tests were excavated
within the project area covering approximately 81 hectares (200 acres) of the total 434-hectare
(1,072-acre) project APE (Figures 2-12). Of the 81 hectares (200 acres) of the APE that were
subjected to subsurface testing, this included all new proposed ROW, made up of 70 hectares
(173 acres) and 11 hectares (27 acres) composed of existing ROW. The remaining 353
hectares (872 acres) were subjected to pedestrian walkover survey.
5.2.1

Results of Shovel/Auger Testing

A total of 248 shovel tests were successfully excavated within the project APE, primarily
within proposed ROW in both Austin and Waller counties (Figures 2-12). Subsurface testing
in both counties indicated that similar soil and environmental conditions are present.
Additional testing was precluded by previous disturbances including paving, drainage ditches,
berms, fences, and buried utilities (Figures 2-12). The majority of these disturbances were
located within existing ROW. The presence of similar soils and environmental similarity

including previous construction disturbances lends support to the suggestion that the Austin
County APE within existing ROW may be given a PALM equivalent rating of Map Unit 3a.
As suggested by PALM Unit 1 in the Waller County portion of the APE, shovel test results
within proposed ROW in Austin County were comparable to results observed in Waller
County. Similar efforts in both areas resulted in the identification of similar soil deposition
and fewer subsurface disturbances than were observed in existing ROW. These results lend
support to the suggestion that proposed ROW in Austin County may be considered equivalent
to PALM Unit 1, as outlined in proposed ROW located in Waller County.
To supplement the shovel testing and characterize deeper sediments, a total of 23 auger tests
were also performed (Figures 2-12). In general, auger tests were excavated within both
existing and proposed ROW within the project APE to define the varying degrees of
disturbance and to test for the likelihood of encountering deeply buried deposits at the
proposed bridge locations at Bessies Creek and the Brazos River crossings. Fifteen auger tests
were excavated within proposed ROW while an additional 8 tests were excavated within
existing ROW. Of these, 10 auger tests were dug beneath selected shovel tests at the Brazos
River crossing where deep impacts are anticipated, but where mechanical excavator could not
be maneuvered (Refer to Chapter 4.0, subsection 4.2.1; See Figure 8). Auger tests at the
Brazos River measured 10 centimeters (4 inches) in diameter were excavated to depths of 2.8
meters (9.2 feet).
In general, shovel tests within the western portion of the APE in Austin County were
excavated to an average depth of 50 centimeters (20 inches). Typical tests in this portion of the
APE contained brown (7.5YR5/4) sandy loam from the ground surface to a depth of 40
centimeters (16 inches) followed by reddish brown (5YR 5/3) clay with large packets of lightcolored sand between 40 and 50 centimeters (16 and 20 inches) below ground surface. Auger
tests typically contained (10YR4/3) sandy loam from beneath the base of shovel test
excavations to a depth of 90 centimeters (36 inches). This layer was followed by a red
(10YR4/8), strong brown (7.5YR5/8), and pinkish gray (7.5YR6/2) mottled clays between 90
and 120 centimeters (36 and 48 inches). Typical shovel tests within the eastern portion of the
APE were excavated to an average depth of 30 centimeters (12 inches) and contained dark
reddish brown (5YR3/3) compacted clay, oftentimes with gravels throughout. Typical auger
tests within the eastern portion of the APE, within existing ROW, were excavated to an
average depth of 75 centimeters (30 inches). Typical tests in this portion of the APE contained
a reddish brown (5YR4/3) clay from below the base of excavated shovel tests to a depth 75
centimeters (30 inches).
Ten shovel test locations were selected for deeper excavation with the bucket-auger at the
Brazos River crossing (see Figures 8 and 9). Auger tests were excavated to an average depth
of 240 centimeters (94 inches) and contained brown (7.5YR5/4) sandy loam to a depth of 230
centimeters (91 inches) and brown (7.5YR4/2) compact sandy clay between 230 and 240
centimeters (91 and 94 inches). One auger test (J99) resulted in the excavation of pieces of
asphalt between 230 and 240 centimeters (91 and 94 inches) below the surface. Based on the
results of augering at the Brazos River, it appears that soils along the river banks have been
altered by previous I-10 road construction.
38

All shovel tests and supplemental auger tests were negative for prehistoric and historic-age
material. In general, the presence of mixed textures and colors encountered during
shovel/auger testing suggests that the majority of the APE has been previously disturbed at
shallow depths, almost certainly from previous I-10 road construction. Representative soil
profiles from selected shovel/auger tests are provided in Figure 13 below.
5.2.2

Results of Mechanical Deep Testing

Targeted mechanical deep testing consisted of the excavation of 9 trenches along the banks of
Bessies Creek (Figure 14). The location of each trench was covered with dense secondary
forest and thick understory vegetation. Vegetation was cleared by swinging the bucket of the
backhoe machine to the left and right in slow controlled motions. An archaeologist monitored
the clearing process and the surfaces of cleared areas leading to trenching sites were inspected
for artifacts using close interval pedestrian survey methods. No archaeological materials were
detected in surface disturbances caused by the backhoe.
The majority of trenches were excavated perpendicular to the direction of the stream channel
in an effort to cross-cut any ancient meander channels, point bars, or other dynamic stream
features (Figure 14). Trenches measured approximately 10 meters (30 feet) in length one
meter (3 feet) wide. Trenches were excavated to a maximum depth of 2 meters (6.56 feet) or
until sediments became too saturated to support deeper excavation.
Trench profiles were consistent with Brazoria clays and Sumpf clays mapped in the area.
Some variation was noted that resulted from the positioning of the trenches that often included
parts of the first and second terraces and include the interface of Brazoria and Sumpf clays.
Buried soil horizons as described in the official series description were encountered in both
soil types (Greenwade 1984; National Web Soil Survey 2008). These possible buried horizons
typically included a sandy clay or sandy loam with moderate to well developed blocky
structure, overlying a pronounced blocky clay that is about 5 to 10 centimeters (2 to 4 inches)
thick. A platy structured sandy loam with clay laminates underlies this clay. These levels
followed the elevation of the surface and appear to reflect constructional episodes of the
terraces.
The location of the platy structured coarser grained sediments beneath the postulated B
horizon, the relatively thin clayey level, and the underlying laminated sand and clay suggests
that these may not be buried soil horizons. This structure and sequence suggests a depositional
sequence resulting from bed load deposition of sands topped with suspension deposited clay
and silt. The fine textured suspension deposited sediment may have caused additional
accumulation of illuvial clays by blocking further downward infiltration. This clay level also
seems to have a high iron content suggesting that water table fluctuations may have played a
role in the development of the clay level. No cultural materials were found associated with
these possible buried horizons or surfaces (See Trench 2 description in Figure 14; Appendix
C). No archaeological deposits were observed as a result of the deep testing (see Appendix C
for the range of Munsell [2000] colors and soil textures). Soil profiles from selected trench
excavations are provided on Figure 14 and a table of all trench profile descriptions is provided
in Appendix C.

Mechanical deep testing was not possible at the Brazos River due to limited available space. It
was not possible to safely maneuver a mechanical excavator to the desired trenching locations.
Therefore, the banks of the Brazos were tested manually using the bucket auger. Auger tests at
the river were excavated to the maximum reach of the auger (Refer to Chapter 4.0 and 5.0;
subsections 4.21 and 5.2.1; see Figures 8, 9, and 13). No archaeological deposits were detected
as a result of augering at the Brazos River banks.
5.2.3

Results of Walkover Survey

Walk-over survey and the judgmentally placed shovel/auger tests within areas of obvious
disturbance including the presence of drainage ditches, berms, and paved roads also proved
negative for surface exposure of artifacts or buried artifacts (See Figures 2-12).
Reconnaissance-level pedestrian walkover survey was conducted over 353 hectares (872
acres) of the total project APE. These areas primarily include existing road ROW and did not
contain sufficiently intact sediments necessary to locate significant archaeological resources.
No exposed archaeological resources were observed as a result of the walkover survey.
5.2.4

Inaccessible Land Parcels

Survey access to several small parcels within the APE was not permitted by private
landowners or landowners that could not be reached prior to survey in the effort to confirm
permitted access. These areas covered a total of 9.7 hectares (24 acres) of the total project
APE. These inaccessible areas are depicted on Figures 2-12 above.

5.3 Field Results of Predictive Modeling
Five locations within the project APE were considered to have a moderate to high probability
for containing intact cultural deposits within Austin and Waller Counties. These include a
small finger of Allen’s Creek, the banks of a channelized segment of Allen’s Creek, the east
and west banks of the Brazos River including an un-named looping tributary of the Brazos
River, and the east and west banks of Bessies Creek.
Although no archaeological resources were located within existing or proposed ROW as a
result of the investigation, HRA Gray & Pape is of the opinion that the desktop assigned high
potential areas are largely accurate. However, the traditional method included the I-10 ROW
that had not been previously surveyed as a moderate or high probability area. The PALM
methodology categorizes this as a Map Unit 4 or low probability. Although the I-10 corridor
was not subject to previous archaeological survey prior to its original construction, the
subsequent disturbances caused by its construction were substantial enough that the existing
ROW can be considered low potential for containing intact archaeological deposits.
Therefore, the high potential areas should have been trimmed to include only proposed ROW
where shallow impacts were anticipated and within existing ROW only where deep impacts
were anticipated.
Based on these results, HRA Gray & Pape’s postulate that the majority of the Austin County
APE might be considered equivalent to PALM Units 1 and 3a is plausible. The field survey

42

results also indicated that the environment in the City of Sealy closely resembles the City of
Brookshire and is therefore considered equivalent to PALM Unit 4.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

This report presents the findings of an intensive pedestrian archaeological survey conducted
along 24 kilometers (15 miles) of existing and proposed ROW of the I-10 corridor between the
cities of Brookshire and Sealy, Texas. The project APE is 151 meters (495 feet) wide, yielding
an area of 434 hectares (1,072 acres) of both existing and proposed new ROW. The goals of this
investigation were to determine if the initiation of this project would affect any previously
identified archaeological sites and to establish whether or not previously unidentified
archaeological resources were located within the archaeological APE. The Lead Agency for
this project is TxDOT; the Texas Antiquities Permit Number issued by the THC is 5152.
Initial investigation consisted of a background literature and site file search to identify the
presence of recorded sites in close proximity to the current proposed project. These activities
did not result in the identification of recorded archaeological historic properties (sites) within
the APE as defined in Section 1.1. Four recorded archaeological historic properties (41WL2,
41WL7, 41WL9, and 41WL22) and 8 historic markers were identified within a 1.6-kilometer
(1-mile) radius of the APE. Architectural survey was outside the scope of this project.
Using several key environmental factors, HRA Gray & Pape developed a model that was used
to predict locations within the project APE with the highest potential for containing intact
buried deposits. In general, these areas are situated near perennial freshwater sources located
on within flat, dry, relatively undisturbed land most often classified as farming/ranchland,
grassland or woody land, and contain well-drained soils. Near surface testing was conducted at
short intervals in high potential areas but at wider intervals in low potential areas. All
fieldwork and reporting activities were completed with reference to state (Antiquities Code of
Texas) and federal guidelines as outlined in Section 106 of the NHPA, as amended (36 CFR
800).
Survey was conducted in February of 2009 and required 65 person hours to complete, while
supplemental deep testing was conducted on April 27, 2009 and required 16 person hours.
Field investigation consisted of reconnaissance survey of existing ROW and intensive
pedestrian survey within new proposed ROW. All proposed ROW is located on privatelyowned land. A total of 248 systematic and judgmental shovel tests were excavated within the
project APE composed of both existing and proposed road ROW making up a total of 434
hectares (1072 acres) that are subsumed by the project. Systematic shovel testing was
conducted within proposed ROW, while judgmental shovel tests were excavated in portions of
existing ROW to confirm suspected disturbances. Systematic shovel testing was conducted
within all 70 hectares (173 acres) of proposed ROW and judgmental shovel tests were
excavated within an additional 11 hectares (27 acres) of existing ROW. In addition, a total of
23 auger tests were also performed across the project area. The majority of auger tests were
excavated within new proposed ROW situated on privately owned property. All auger tests
were excavated at selected shovel test locations. All shovel tests and supplemental auger tests
were negative for prehistoric and historic-age material. To supplement the shovel/auger testing
and assess the potential for deeply buried archaeological deposits, a total of 9 deep test
trenches were excavated to the maximum reach of the mechanical excavator at 2 meters (6.6
44

feet) at the proposed Bessies Creek crossing. Since a mechanical excavator was not
maneuverable within available space at the Brazos River crossing, 10 of the 23 auger tests
were placed on the riverbanks. Auger tests were excavated to a maximum depth 2.8 meters
(9.2 feet) to test for deeply buried deposits.
Walk-over survey and the excavation of judgmental shovel tests were conducted within areas
of obvious disturbance including drainage ditches, berms, and paved road construction also
proved negative for surface exposure of artifacts. Reconnaissance-level pedestrian walkover
survey was conducted over 353 hectares (872 acres) of the total project APE. Survey access to
several small parcels within the APE was not permitted. This area encompasses a total of 10
hectares (24 acres) of the 434-hectare (1,072-acre) project APE.
As described in Chapter 2.0, HRA Gray & Pape suggested that nearly all of the existing ROW
in the Austin County APE might be considered equivalent to PALM Unit 3a like Waller
County, with the exception of the City of Sealy, which may resemble PALM Unit 4. Based on
field survey, the cities of Brookshire, located in Waller County, and Sealy, located in Austin
County, contain similarly built streetscapes and belowground city infrastructure and are both
considered to have very low geoarchaeological potential. Based on these results, the City of
Sealy fits well into the PALM Unit 4 category like the City of Brookshire.
Subsurface testing in both counties indicated that similar soils and environmental conditions
are present in Austin and Waller counties. Additional testing was precluded by previous
disturbances including paving, drainage ditches, berms, fences, and buried utilities (Figures 2­
12). The majority of these disturbances were located within existing ROW. The presence of
similar soils and environmental similarity including previous construction disturbances lends
support to the suggestion that the Austin County APE within existing ROW may be given a
PALM equivalent rating of Map Unit 3a. Likewise, it was suggested that all proposed ROW in
Austin County might be considered equivalent to PALM Unit 1. As suggested by PALM Unit
1 in the Waller County portion of the APE, shovel test results within proposed ROW in Austin
County were comparable to results observed in Waller County. Similar efforts in both areas
resulted in the identification of similar soil deposition and fewer near surface disturbances
than were observed in existing ROW. Although these areas may contain deep Holocene soils,
impacts are anticipated to be shallow (in fact, most construction will involve the building up of
land) in these areas and therefore did not require deep testing. These results lend support to the
suggestion that proposed ROW in Austin County corresponds well with criteria associated
with PALM Unit 1.
The results of the survey indicate that no previously unidentified archaeological resources are
located within the archaeological APE and no newly identified archaeological sites were
recorded. Based on the negative findings across 423 hectares (1,045 acres) of surveyed project
area, HRA Gray & Pape recommends that no survey be required within the small, inaccessible
portions of the project area subsuming only 9.7 hectares (24 acres). Furthermore, HRA Gray
& Pape recommends no further archaeological investigation be required and that the project be
allowed to proceed as planned.
