ABSTRACT
The City of Grand Prairie intends to construct several ponds along a first
order, intermittent tributary to Cottonwood Creek as well as associated
facilities in an approximately 150-acre park located in the Grand Prairie
uplands in both Dallas and Tarrant counties, Texas. The study area is
located south of and adjacent to Arkansas Lane and west of SH 161.
During late February of 2008, AR Consultants, Inc. conducted an
intensive pedestrian archaeological survey of the park site for Halff
Associates, Inc. which is doing the environmental permitting for the City
of Grand Prairie. During the survey, a historic site (41DL468) which is a
concrete historic structure of unknown use was recorded. No prehistoric
artifacts were seen on the ground surface or uncovered in 27 shovel tests.
Due to the absence of a associated features such as a house foundation and
diagnostic artifacts, the site is deemed ineligible for nomination to the
National Register of Historic Places or as a State Archeological
Landmark.
Based upon the negative results of the archaeological survey, AR
Consultants, Inc. recommends that further cultural resource investigations
at the park site are unwarranted and that the City of Grand Prairie be
allowed to construct the ponds and associated facilities. However, if
buried cultural materials older than 50 years are encountered, work should
stop immediately in that area and the Archeology Division of the Texas
Historical Commission should be notified.

INTRODUCTION

The City of Grand Prairie intends to create a park on approximately 150 acres on the
Dallas/Tarrant counties border. Within the park, a series of ponds will be created along a
first order, intermittent tributary to Cottonwood Creek. Also associated facilities such as
an amphitheater, boat house and trails will be constructed within the park. The study area
is located south of and adjacent to Arkansas Lane, west of SH 161 and south of an
elementary school (Figure 1).
The cultural resource investigation was required because the City of Grand Prairie is a
political entity of the State of Texas and Texas Antiquities Permit Number 4820 was
issued for the archaeological survey. Since an intermittent tributary will be impacted that
might contain Waters of the United States, possible relevant federal legislation might
include the National Historic Preservation Policy Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515),
the National Environmental Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), the Archeological and Historical
Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93-291), the Clean Water Act, as amended
PL92500 and the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899.
This report is written in accordance with the guidelines for reports adopted by the
Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission, and developed by the Council
of Texas Archeologists (ND). The following report presents a brief description of the
natural setting of the project area, followed by a discussion of the archaeology and
history. A chapter on the research design and methodology employed in the investigation
is then followed by the results of the field investigation. The report concludes with
recommendations followed by the references cited.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The study area is located within the Grand Prairie. The Grand Prairie consists largely of
grassland with forested areas that along streams and on hill tops. Comments were made
upon the prairie’s vastness and lush grass as well as the lack of timber and its beautiful
flowers by the early European explorers and settlers to the area. Antelope were abundant
and the grasses were dominated by blue stem (Diggs et al. 1999:48-49, 52).
Soils in the area belong to the Houston Black-Heiden and Houston Black-Navo-Heiden
Soil Associations (Coffee et al. 1980:General Soils Map; Ressel 1981:General Soils
Map). Both associations consist mainly of clay but loams are present in Tarrant County.
Specific soils within the study area consist of Burleson clay with 0 to 1 percent slopes,
Houston Black clay with 1 to 3 percent slopes and Lewisville silty clay with 3 to 5
percent slopes in Dallas County (Coffee et al. 1980:Sheet 43) and Leson clay with 1 to 3
percent slopes in Tarrant County (Ressel 1981:Sheet 46). The underlying geologic
bedrock in the area consists of the Upper Cretaceous-aged Eagle Ford shale (Bureau of
Economic Geology 1972).
The banks and channel of the first-order, intermittent tributary to Cottonwood Creek are
mapped as being Houston Black clay with 1 to 3 percent slopes. No floodplain is present.
In addition, the central part of the drainage within the study area appears to have been
channelized based upon its configuration on the Dallas County Soil Map and the USGS
map. Brune (1981:152-155, 418-422) lists no springs in or adjacent to the study area.
A consensus about the paleoenvironmental conditions of North Central Texas over the
past 12,000 years has not been reached. Discussions by Prikryl (1993), Ferring (1990),
Humphrey and Ferring (1994) and Brown (1988) offer disparate interpretations based on
different analytical approaches. The following discussion relies heavily on Ferring's
investigations and focuses upon the past two thousand years. Correlating periods of rapid
alluviation with higher precipitation and slow alluviation with drier conditions, Ferring
has concluded that the Late Holocene [5000 yr B.P. to the present] was a wet period with
moderate alluviation, except for a dry period between 2000 to 1000 yr B.P. [A.D. 11000]. It was during this dry period that the West Fork Paleosol was established on the
stable surfaces of the river meanders along the Upper Trinity and its tributaries. This
interpretation is supported by changing patterns seen in stable isotope analysis. Brown
(1988) offers a different interpretation based on isotopic analyses of mussel shells from a
prehistoric site (41DL270) on Denton Creek. He concludes that the period from 1500 to
2500 yr B.P. was cooler and/or wetter and that before and after that time period, the
environment was warmer and drier. He points out, however, that this interpretation may
only be applicable for the Elm Fork tributary and not the region.

CULTURAL HISTORY
The Paleo-Indian culture (11,000 to 6,000 BC) had been described as relying on a
hunting and gathering economy, with primary emphasis being on the hunting and
processing of mammoth and bison. The Lewisville site (Crook and Harris 1957) and the
Aubrey site (Ferring 2001) are good examples of sites dated to this period. Both
campsites are deeply buried, and thus preserved, under the floodplain sediments of the
Elm Fork of the Trinity River. Surface artifacts dating to this period have been reported
from Dallas County (Meltzer and Bever 1995:Table 1).
The Archaic period follows the Paleo-Indian and lasts from 6,000 BC to possibly as late
as AD 600. Hunting and gathering continued to be the means by which the people
supported themselves. This adaptation was more diversified than that of the earlier period
and there is limited evidence that the population increased in size during the course of
this period of time. Archaic sites are more common, although there is little evidence of
Early Archaic occupation in the area. The Middle Archaic period has been termed the
Trinity Aspect (Crook and Harris 1952) has been used in the Trinity River Basin. Prikryl
(1990: 73) has questioned the value of the Trinity Aspect and prefers the use of time
period terminology since there seem to be questions about the primary contexts of the
assemblages from the sites used to define the Aspect.
By the Late Archaic, there is sufficient information to describe the presence of several
site types. These include midden sites, shell lens sites, artifact scatters, and upland edge
scatters (Richner and Bagot 1978:146). The majority of these sites are known to occur
along the major drainages where studies have been conducted, but the few upland surveys
have demonstrated that scattered occupation sites are present away from the main
drainages.
A transition to the Late Prehistoric may be signaled by the presence of a crude form of
generally plain brown pottery known as Williams Plain, but very little is known about
this transition period. Small Gary dart points are generally attributed to this period.
The beginning of the Late Prehistoric is signaled by the appearance of ceramics and
arrow points in the first millennium AD. The Late Prehistoric I period (ca. AD 600-1200)
is also signaled by the appearance of houses and corn horticulture. Locally made pottery
includes copies of Caddoan Alto and Sanders phase types. Evidence for corn horticulture
was noted at the Cobb-Pool site at Lake Joe Pool (Peter and McGregor 1988). Late
Prehistoric II dates from AD 1200-1600 and is characterized by the appearance of a
Plains Village-like artifact assemblage. Harahey knives, thumbnail scrapers, and flake
drills are frequently found with triangular-shaped and Perdiz arrow points. In some cases,
these artifacts have been found with bison kills and in other cases bison scapulas had
been used to make hoe blades. Nocona Plain, a shell-tempered pottery, occurs during this
prehistoric period and is believed to be locally made.

The protohistoric period of north central begins with the entrance of the Spanish about
AD 1541. At about this same time, immigrant Native American groups moved into the
same area and either displaced the indigenous prehistoric inhabitants or moved into areas
that had previously been abandoned. The beginning of this period was marked by limited
and sporadic contact between European explorers and the native occupants.
A wide variety of historic Indian groups inhabited this part of Texas. There are very few
sites attributed to historic Indians in this region (Skinner 1988), yet historic sites have
been discovered near the modern towns of Waco, Mexia, Emory, and Spanish Fort where
the Wichita tribe has been reported to have settlements.
The earliest Anglo settlements in North Central Texas were Bird’s Fort, established
around 1840, and Lonesome Dove, settled in 1845 (Garrett 1972:55). Settlers continued
to arrive steadily arriving under the auspices of Peters Colony land grants, although only
160 families and single pioneers took advantage of the grants (Garrett 1972:57).
The community of Grand Prairie was organized in 1863. The original name of the
community was Deckman but the name was changed to Grand Prairie to agree with the
Texas Pacific Railway’s name for the community in 1873. Supposedly, a lady had
stepped off the train and stated, “What a grand prairie!” The town continued to grow,
especially with road improvements and bridges constructed between Dallas and Fort
Worth. In addition, the construction of Hensley Field in 1928 added to the economic base
and the field was used during for a flight school in World War II. The economic base
shifted from agriculture and ranching to manufacturing which has allowed the city to
continue to grow today (Maxwell 2007:1-3).
Previous Investigations
The major archaeological survey done in the general vicinity is east of the study area and
was for the Joe Pool Lake (formerly Lakeview Lake). The first survey was conducted by
Southern Methodist University (Skinner and Connors 1979) and five previously recorded
sites were revisited and thirty-seven more prehistoric and historic sites were recorded.
Based upon the recommendations from the initial survey, archaeologists from Southern
Methodist University tested sixteen prehistoric and twenty-three historic sites to
determine their eligibility for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places
(Raab et al. 1982). Intensive investigations at five prehistoric sites were conducted by
Southern Methodist University (Peter and McGregor 1988) and at thirteen historic sites
(Jurney et al. 1988). During the excavation of the Cobb-Pool site (41DL148), three
possible house structures and corn remnants were found which are extremely rare for the
North Central Texas area. Evidence of bison hunting and Plains artifacts were recovered
from the Baggett Branch site (41DL149).
In the same general area, the Dallas Archeological Society excavated the Ubil site
(41DL336). The site consists of a large flower pot-shaped pit that was exposed in the
bank of Artesian Creek. The site dates to approximately 965 years BP which agrees with

the Alba arrow points and Nocona Plain pottery recovered from the site. The prehistoric
residents were processing mammals and nuts at the site (Skinner et al. 2007).
No archaeological sites were listed within the study area (Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas). However, according to the record, no archaeological sites were found during the
1984 and 1993 archaeological surveys of West Freeway Street which is located just east
of the study area.
One residence in the study area is plotted on the 1920 Soils Map for Dallas County,
Texas (USDA 1920) and two residences were shown on the 1936 General Highway Map
for Dallas and Rockwall Counties, Texas (Texas State Highway Department 1948). No
residences were shown on Sam Street’s 1900 map for Dallas County or the 1895 map for
Tarrant County, Texas.

RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODOLOGY
Research Design
The research design for this survey focused on two research questions. The first dealt
with the distribution of prehistoric sites and historic sites, while the second dealt with a
general question that asks, “Where are sites located?”
Based upon the upland setting away from perennial water which constitutes most of the
survey area, it was assumed that no prehistoric sites would be present unless knappable
lithic materials were present. However, since the study area is in generally level setting, it
is doubtful that knappable lithic resources would be present since they are usually found
on topographic elevations.
In this case, determining where historic sites might be located is made easier by the fact
that two residences are present along Arkansas Lane on the 1959 USGS map. However,
since historic settlers were not tied to water due to drilling wells and constructing
cisterns, settlers could occupy a variety of settings. No doubt, through time, residences
were placed adjacent to historic transportation routes such as the one located north of and
adjacent to the study area.
An even more basic, research problem also guided the survey; simply stated the question
asks “How did past people use the land, and what record of this use did they leave
behind?” Most frequently, limited-area and linear surveys of this type gather information
in response to this more open-ended research question, which guides almost all
archaeological surveys.
Methodology
Armed with the USGS map, soil map, shovels, a camera and field notes, the
archaeologists carefully inspected the ground surface within the study area. North-south
oriented transects were walked by the archaeologists spaced 30 m apart. Shovel testing
was done on an as-needed basis away from the intermittent tributary to Cottonwood
Creek as suggested by the Council of Texas Archeologists (2002). Although no
floodplain is present adjacent to the intermittent tributary, shovel tests were excavated at
approximately 100 m intervals along the drainage. Shovel tests were excavated to
approximately 30 cm below the ground surface to determine if farming practices had
covered any prehistoric or historic cultural materials. The clay matrices were not
screened but were broken manually and visually examined for cultural materials as were
the pit walls. Notes about the topography, vegetation and soils were made and
photographs were taken.
Deep testing was not done due to the fact that the tributary does not have a well developed
floodplain in which cultural materials would be buried and preserved.

RESULTS
This portion of the report is broken into three parts. The survey area is described first and
is followed by a discussion of the survey. Conclusions based upon the results of the
survey conclude the chapter. Shovel tests are described generally in the text, but specific
information is provided in Table 1. Shovel test locations and site 41DLxxx are plotted on
Figure 7.
The survey area
The survey area consists of terrain that ranges from generally level to gently sloping to
the north, south and east. Understory vegetation includes broomweed, tickle grass, rabbit
grass, prickly pear, berry vines, grape vine and other grass species. Trees include eastern
red cedar, hackberry, mesquite and a solitary cottonwood. The typical vegetation is
shown in Figure 2. The intermittent tributary that runs through the property ranges from 1
to 3.5 m wide and from 1.5 to 2.5 m deep. Clear water is present and ranges from less
than 0.25 to a meter deep. The substrate is clay containing limestone and hematite pea
gravel. No buried cultural materials were noted in the mostly vertical banks. Two beaver
dams were found on the drainage. A power line corridor bisects the study area. Ground
visibility ranged from less than 10 percent to 100 percent while eye-height visibility was
excellent even in the small forested areas which were mainly along old fence lines.

The study area has been disturbed which allowed the surveyors to cover the ground
quickly. Numerous dirt two-track roads are present that criss-cross the area. Just
southeast of Shovel test 1 (Figure 6) to east of Shovel test 8 and north of the intermittent
tributary is a large swale which is shown in Figure 3. Upon examining the banks, the C
horizon (the yellowish-brown clay) appears to be approximately 50 cm below the ground
surface. No buried cultural materials were noted in the swale’s banks.
Several push piles were present along the drainage (Figure 4). During the survey, it
appears that three attempts to build a road across the drainage to what today is a park and
a housing complex south of the study area. One of the roads is shown in Figure 6.

The survey
Survey began in the northwest corner and went south. Nineteen shovel tests were
excavated along the intermittent tributary to Cottonwood Creek and encountered
culturally sterile clay that ranged from 31 to 37 cm below the ground surface. Eight
shovel tests were excavated along the ridge and its slope north of the drainage and
uncovered culturally sterile clay that ranged from 29 to 35 cm below the ground surface.
No prehistoric cultural materials were seen on the ground surface but one historic site,
41DL468, was discovered and is described below.

are located.

Site 41DL468
The site consists of a 8x6 foot north-south oriented concrete foundation (Figures 7 and 8)
of unknown function. The concrete is level with the ground or about 6 to 8 inches above
it in places. The site is located approximately 51 feet south of Arkansas Lane. The
concrete walls are 6.5 inches thick and appear include local gravel. Round metal rebar
(Figure 9) are present in the concrete walls. A metal pipe juts out of the ground at the
southern end of the foundation. The function of the structure is unknown. The concrete
foundation is surrounded by 1 to 6 inch diameter hackberry trees and several plastic pvc
pipes are present south of the structure. Jonquils almost surround the structure. A metal
shed is approximately 5x5 feet is south of the structure. The inside of the box is lined
with asbestos and wires running from the inside of pvc pipes to a metal pole attached to a
wooden pole.

A records review was conducted to determine ownership of the property when the
structure might have been build and by whom. During the 1970’s the property was owned
by the Stuart Hunt, he purchased the property from Oliver Clegg in 1973 according to
Dallas County Deed Record volume 73089 page 2644. Clegg purchased the land from a
group called the Arkansas Lane Joint Venture in 1968 as recorded in Dallas County Deed
Record volume 68165 page 760. The Arkansas Joint Venture obtained the land from
Wayne Martin in 1967 (Dallas County Deed Record volume 67122 pg 1173) and the
property changed hand several times in the Martin family during the 1960s. The Martin
family probably obtained the land from Glenn Bearden sometime between 1951 and
1966, but the Dallas County Deed Records were missing. Bearden bought the land in
1951 from Odis and Edith Dean according to Dallas County Deed Record volume 3535
page 388. After that the several more deeds were missing, but the property was owned in
1940 by Wylie Stufflebeme recorded in Dallas County Deed Record volume 2243 page
249 and by the Union Central Life Insurance Company in 1937, Dallas County Deed
Record volume 2151 page 360.
Six shovel tests (28-33) were excavated adjacent to the structure but were culturally
sterile. The most interesting was Shovel test 31 which encountered 10 cm of loamy clay
overlying sand that extended to 35 cm bs. The different soil may indicate a possible road
since blocks of asphalt pavement were present in the vicinity of the shovel test. No
residence or other cultural features were found associated with the structure.

rebar (Figure 9) are present in the concrete walls. A metal pipe juts out of the ground at
the southern end of the foundation. The function of the structure is unknown. The
concrete foundation is surrounded by 1 to 6 inch diameter hackberry trees and several
plastic pvc pipes are present south of the structure. Jonquils almost surround the

overlying sand that extended to 35 cm bs. The different soil may indicate a possible road
since blocks of asphalt pavement were present in the vicinity of the shovel test. No
residence or other cultural features were found associated with the structure.
Conclusions
As expected, no prehistoric sites were found in the upland setting, probably due to the
absence of perennial water and low biotic diversity. The presence of at least one historic
structure also was expected and was found. As previously stated, the residence on the
USGS map east of site 41DL468 had been removed, probably so that the land could be
farmed.

RECOMMENDATIONS

Although site 41DL468 was discovered, it is considered ineligible for nomination to the
National Register of Historic Places or as a State Archeological Landmark site since it
consists of only a concrete foundation with associated signature plants. No historic
structures or features were associated with the site. The structure possibly was
constructed circa 1936 since a residence is shown on the 1936 Texas Highway Map for
Dallas County, but this cannot be stated conclusively and no diagnostic artifacts were
found associated with the structure. No prehistoric sites were encountered. Based upon
our findings, AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that further cultural resource
investigations are unwarranted and the City of Grand Prairie should be allowed to
proceed with the construction of the ponds and park facilities. Planning and construction
personnel should be advised that buried archaeological materials could be encountered
during construction, and if this should happen, work should cease in that immediate area
and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission should be notified.
