Abstract

Medina Consulting, Inc., of San Antonio, Texas contracted with Tierras Antiguas Archaeological
Investigations to conduct a cultural resources survey of 47-acre Trail Drivers Park in the City of
Fort Worth and Tarrant County, Texas. A new hike-and-bike trail 2,112 feet long (0.4 mile) is
to be constructed through the central and south-central portion of the park.
On July 22, 2009 the Texas State Historical Preservation Officer (SHPO) advised that the new
trail would be adjacent to a stream that coursed through the park (Lebow Channel, a.k.a.
Gilmore’s Branch) would allow the public to have access to the entire park, and that the
construction could have adverse impacts on any archaeological sites that could be along the
stream, and in the park area in general.
Federal funding was provided under the guise of the Federal Highway Administration and
administered by the Texas Department of Transportation, and the park is owned by the City of
Fort Worth. As such, this project was undertaken under Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966, and Texas Antiquities Permit #5715 was obtained from the Texas
Historical Commission (THC).
Tierras Antiguas Archaeological Investigations conducted the survey on 31 July - 2 August,
2010. A thorough pedestrian survey of the surface area was conducted, and 74 shovel tests were
excavated. No evidence of prehistoric cultural material was observed either on or below the
surface. The only three historic artifacts observed were on an eroded surface adjacent to the
stream. The approved Scope of Work delineated a non-collection policy of artifacts considered
to be of a redundant nature to the prehistory and history of Texas. As such, no artifacts were
collected or curated.
Tierras Antiguas Archaeological Investigations recommended to the SHPO that the construction
of the hike and bike trail be allowed to proceed as planned. However, Tierras Antiguas further
recommended that if any previously undiscovered cultural resources were encountered during
development, work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds could be
examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and
by the Texas Historical Commission.

Introduction
A hike-and-bike trail known as “Trail Drivers Trail
Connection” was proposed for construction through
portions of Trail Drivers Park. Trail Drivers Park
consists of approximately 47 acres, with some
developed ball fields, roads, and parking lots (Figures
1 and 2).
On July 22, 2009 the Texas State Historical
Preservation Officer (SHPO) advised that the new trail
would be adjacent to a stream that coursed through the
park (Lebow Channel, a.k.a. Gilmore’s Branch) would
allow the public to have access to the entire park, and
that the construction could have adverse impacts on any

archaeological sites that could be along the stream, and

in the park area in general. Therefore, the SHPO
required that a cultural resources survey of the entire park be conducted.

Federal funding was
provided under the
guise of the Federal
H i g h w a y
Administration and
administered by the
Texas Department of
Transportation, and the
park is owned by the
City of Fort Worth. As
such, this project was
undertaken under
Section 106 of the
N a t i o n al Hi s t o r i c
Preservation Act of
1966, and Tex as
Antiquities Permit
#5715 was obtained
from the Texas
Historical Commission
(THC).

Although the proposed “Trail Drivers Trail Connection” hike-and-bike trail was approximately
0.4-mile long (2,112 feet - 644 meters) x 10 feet wide (3.3 meters), the Area of Potential Effect
(APE) additionally included approximately 10 feet along each side of the trail so that vehicles
could blade the trail, clear brush and understory, and haul in concrete or other construction
material; thus potentially effecting an approximately 30-foot-wide (9.1 meters) swath through
some relatively undeveloped areas.
Plans called for the hike-and-bike trail to be smoothed and shallowly scraped to no more than
two feet (60 centimeters [0.6 meters]) deep, and subsequently covered with concrete. No utility
lines or amenities along the trail were planned. Thus, in terms of potential maximum ground
disturbance, the APE is: 644 meters (length) x 9.1 meters (width) x 0.6 meters (depth) = 3,516.24
cubic meters.
A review of the Texas Atlas online database indicated that there were no previously recorded
archaeological sites recorded within or near the project area. Tierras Antiguas Archaeological
Investigations (TAAI) conducted the survey on 31 July - 2 August, 2010. A thorough pedestrian
survey of the surface area was conducted, and 74 shovel tests were excavated. No evidence of
prehistoric cultural material was observed either on or below the surface. The only three historic
artifacts observed were on an eroded surface adjacent to the stream. The approved Scope of
Work delineated a non-collection policy of artifacts considered to be of a redundant nature to the
prehistory and history of Texas. As such, no artifacts were collected or curated.

Project Setting
Cross Timbers Ecological Region
Trail Drivers Park lies within the Cross Timbers
Ecological Region, and the Fort Worth Prairie
sub-region (Gould et al. 1960; TPWD 2010a
[see Figure 3]). The area received the “Cross
Timbers” monacle from travelers who traveled
from west to east through the area about as early
as 1772. To both the east and west of this area
was generally open prairie, but the timbered area
in between these prairied areas became known as
the “Cross Timbers”. Until about the past 150
years, game in the Cross Timbers area was
abundant with buffalo, bear, deer, antelope, wild
boars, partridges, and turkeys.
significantly changed by the movement of Figure 3. Ecoregions of Texas as defined by

fragmentation of once continuous habitat into smaller land holdings; such is the case with the
City of Fort Worth and the immediate area of Trail Drivers Park (TPWD 2010b) .
Texan Biotic Province
Fort Worth and Trail Drivers Park are
situated within the Texan biotic province of
Texas as defined by Blair (1950 [see Figure
4]). Sixty years ago, in 1950, one could
expect to see mammals such as the Virginia
opossum (Didelphis virginiana), the eastern
mole (Scalopus aquaticus), fox squirrels
(Sciurus niger), Louisiana pocket gophers
(Geomys breviceps), fulvous harvest mice
(Reithrodontomys fulvescens), white-footed
mice (Peromyscus leucopus), hispid cotton
rats (Sigmodon hispidus), eastern cottontails
(Sylvilagus floridanus) and swamp rabbits
(S. aquaticus).
Rodents often seen on the grasslands
include the thirteen-lined ground squirrels
(Spermophilus tridecemlineatus), hispid Figure 4. Biotic provinces of Texas (Blair 1950;
pocket mice (Chaetodipus hispidus), deer adapted by TPWD 2010c).
mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) and
b l a c k - t a i l ed j a c k r a b b i t s ( L e p u s
californicus).
Frogs and toads that would have been
common are the Hurter's spadefoot (Scaphiopus holbrookiihurteri), the Gulf Coast toad (Bufo
valliceps), the Woodhouse's toad (Bufo woodhousii), the gray treefrog (Hyla
versicolor/chrysoscelis), the green treefrog (Hyla cinerea), a bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana), the
southern leopard frog (Rana sphenocephala) and the eastern narrowmouth toad (Microhylla
carolinensis). Once again, the ever-expanding city of Fort Worth and the disruption of broad and
continuous natural habitats that were the homes of selected species have been dissected, so that
if they now exist within the populated areas, they do so in relict ecosystems.

Geology
Approximately 85 percent of the geological base within the project area is mapped as Holocene
age Alluvium (Qal) (Figure 5). These are floodplain deposits with indistinct low terraces made
up of gravel, sands, silt, clay, and organic matter. Lower Cretaceous Fort Worth Limestone (Kwl)

and Duck Creek Formation (kdc)
limestone comprise about 10 percent of
the project area, in the
upper reaches of the park. Fort Worth
Limestone is made up of both limestone
and clay. The limestone is aphanitic to
biosparite and burrowed. It is light to
medium gray, but when it weathers it
becomes yellowish-brown in color. The
calcareous clay in this formation can be
up to 35 feet thick and forms on low
rolling hills such as in the northern
portion of Trail Drivers Park (Figure 6).
It is normally medium gray to yellowish
brown, but as it weathers it also turns Figure 6. Low rolling hills and valley in the
northeastern portion of the park; facing northeast.
yellowish brown in color.
The Duck Creek Formation is comprised of aphanitic and bioclastic limestone with localized
burrows. Topographic benches are not uncommon, and it can be as much as 100 feet thick. It is
medium gray to yellowish gray in color, and turns to dark gray with yellowish-brown patches
upon weathering. The remaining, northwestern portion of the Park is made up of Pleistocene age
Fluviatile terrace deposits (Qt) consisting of gravel, sand, silt, and clay (Fisher 1972).

Soils
The upper, northeastern portion of the park is covered with Aledo-Bolar Urban Land Complex
soils that occur on ridges and sideslopes, sloping from 3 to 20 percent (Figure 7). Limestone
bedrock on the slopes outcrop with every 5 to 30-foot drop in elevation, so that the slope looks
like it has been benched or terraced. Aledo comprises approximately 20 to 30 percent of the
complex, Bolar about 15 to 20 percent, and Urban from 15 to 50 percent, and 20 percent other
soils and rock outcrops. The upper layer of Aledo is about 20 cm thick, and is moderately
alkaline, dark grayish brown clay loam. Under that is about 23 cm of moderately alkaline, dark
grayish brown very gravelly clay loam with limestone fragments 65 percent by volume; then
limestone bedrock.
Bolar soil consists of very dark grayish brown clay loam in the upper 25 cm, underlain by 35 cm
of moderately alkaline, brown silty clay loam with common limestone fragments. Below that,
and resting on limestone bedrock is as much as 15 cm of light gray silty clay loam with yellowish
and brownish mottles and common limestone fragments; then bedrock (Ressel 1981:14-15; Sheet
29). “Urban land consists of construction sites, structures, and other disturbed areas were th soil
has been altered to the extent that classification is not practical. Many areas have been disturbed
by cutting, grading, and filling” (Ressel 1981:15).

5

Frio-Urban Land Complex,
occasionally flooded soils
are present along both
sides of LeBow Channel,
and
make
u p
approximately 80 percent
of the soils within the park.
According to Ressel
(1981:30), “Unprotected
areas are subject to brief,
occasional floods...”
“...and the hazard to
flooding is difficult to
overcome.” Although these
areas are normally flooded
only every 3 to 20 years,
the urban growth along
Lebow Channel has
accelerated the flooding.
“Extensive flooding has
occurred for decades along
the Lebow Channel, and
the tragic reality is these
flood waters have claimed
five precious lives”
(Moncrief 2010).
The Frio-Urban Land
Complex is comprised of
40 to 70 percent Frio soils, Figure 7. Soils within and around the project area (Ressel 1981).
15 to 40 percent Urban
Land, and less than 15
percent closely similar Ovan and Trinity soils (Ressel 1981:30). The upper 38-cm layer of Frio
consists of moderately alkaline, very dark grayish brown silty clay. Below that is up to 23 cm of
moderately alkaline, dark grayish brown silty clay. This is then underlain with up to 1.4 m of
moderately alkaline, brown silty clay loam. The Urban Lands soils within this complex have
previously been described above.
Small portions of the western edge of the park jut onto Bastil-Urban Land Complex soils that
occur on high terraces away from major streams, and slope from 0 to 5 percent (see Figure 7).
Bastil soil, which makes up about 40 to 60 percent of the Complex, has a 28-cm surface layer
of slightly acidic, pale brown sandy loam. Under that is 1.14 m of lightly acidic, sandy clay loam.
The upper portion of this subsurface layer is yellowish red, and transitions to red in the lower
part. The next subsurface layer, approximately 53 cm thick, is neutral, yellowish red sandy clay
6

loam (Ressel 1981:18). Urban Land soils which comprise roughly 30 percent of this Complex
have been previously described above.
As much as 25 percent of the Bastil-Urban Land Complex could be small areas of Rader and/or
Silawa soils. A typical pedon of Rader soils is: 0 to 45 cm - brown to pale brown fine sandy
loam; 45 to 60 cm - yellowish brown sandy clay loam; 60 cm to 1.06 m - acidic sandy clay
transitioning to sandy clay loam, mottled throughout with shades of yellow, gray, brown, and
red (Ressel 1981:46). A typical Silawa fine sandy loam pedon is: 0 to 15 cm - slightly acidic,
dark yellowish brown fine sandy loam; 15 to 96 cm - medium acidic sandy clay, transitioning
in color with depth from red to yellowish red; 96 cm to 1.11 m - slightly acidic, reddish yellow
fine sandy loam (Ressel 1981:50).
The lower southeastern portion of the park sets on Arents, Frequently Flooded soils (see Figure
7). “These deep, loamy soils are the overburden from excavated areas of gravel and sand mining
operations on nearly level flood plains of large streams.” As such, “..the soil materials are
extremely varied. They are in shades of red, brown, and yellow and contain varied amounts of
clay, sand, silt, and gravel. The materials are mainly loamy, moderately alkaline, and calcareous”
(Ressel 1981:16-17).

Climate
The average annual rainfall in Tarrant County is just over 32 inches (Hightower 1996). The
average annual rainfall in the Dallas-Fort Worth area from 1971 - 2000 is illustrated in Figure
8. The monthly high average is just over five inches in May, with monthly low averages of
around two inches occurring in January, July, and August (Climate 2010).
Figure 9 depicts the average monthly temperatures during the period 1971 - 2000 (Climate 2010).
The lowest average monthly temperature occurs in January, at 350F, with the highest in July, at
960F (Hightower 1996).

Paleoenvironment
An interpretation of multiple datasets derived from different paleoecological sources can be not
only contentious and conflicting, but also somewhat confusing. Perhaps the most complete and
continuous record with corroborating multiple lines of evidence comes from Bastrop and Kerr
counties Central Texas: Boriack Bog arboreal pollen (Bousman 1998), Patschke grass pollen
(Camper 1991), Hall's Cave microfauna (Collins 1995; Toomey and Stafford 1994; Toomey et
al. 1993). Until recently, it was believed that the Patschke Bog data was skewed by the intrusion
of marsh grasses. However, by eliminating marsh taxa pollen counts from Camper's Patschke
Bog samples, Raymond Mauldin has demonstrated a close correlation to the grass data from
Boriack (Mauldin et al. 2003). In addition, oxygen isotope data from mussel shells and snail
species recovered from the Vara Daniels site (41TV1364) in Austin have most recently
contributed to what we know about the Early Holocene paleoclimate (Nickels et al. 2010) .
Figures 10 and 11 illustrate these datasets. In addition, following Collins (2004) we have
illustrated bison presence/absence (Dillehay 1974), and Collins' (2004) soil deposition, erosion,
and soil formation sequences. The data illustrated in Figures 10 and 11 generally indicate that
the waning of the Pleistocene, or late-glacial period, marked a transition from a cooler, wetter
environment ending around 9000 BP. The climate steadily grew warmer and drier, and more
seasonal, with intermittent moist periods through about 4000 BP. The microfauna data indicate
that there was a transition to a wetter climate for the next 3,000 years, but that seems to conflict
with the pollen analysis from the two bogs, suggesting that it may have been slightly drier during
that time, decreasing the arboreal canopy while increasing the grasslands available. Closer to
Traildrivers Park, stable carbon isotope data from 41TR170 on the Clear Fork of the Trinity
River suggest a shift from warm and dry conditions to cooler and wetter conditions about 1,000
years ago (Lintz et al. 2008:58-61).
Although the two datasets also conflict with each other in evaluating the climate over the past
1,000 years, it is unlikely that the climate has changed significantly during this latter period,
significantly inducing vegetation changes. The greater changes have been induced by human
intervention through the clearing of wooded areas along the rivers for construction purposes,
pumping more water for irrigation which has lowered water tables, and overgrazing by livestock.
Although there are still many seeps, springs, and streams in the area, they most probably flowed
with greater abundance during wetter intervals than exist at the present time, providing an
abundant resource for prehistoric occupants.

Cultural Context and Chronology
Introduction
Trail Drivers Park is situated within the North-central Texas Archaeological Region (Perttula
2004:7). Although still poorly understood because of the lack of excavations conducted on well
stratified and intact archaeological sites within the region, there are four periods that have most
succinctly defined by Dan Prikryl (1990) in his synthesis of geomorphology and archaeology
along the Elm Fork of the Trinity River. They are the Palaeoindian period, the Archaic, the Late
Prehistoric. Duane Peter and Dan McGregor (1988) further identified a Protohistoric period from
their investigations at Joe Pool Lake that should be added to this sequence. The sequence is
shown in Table 1; all dates presented in ‘years BP’ are years before A.D. 1950, when
radiocarbon dating was refined.

Protohistoric

Pre-Clovis
Although humans may have inhabited North America before 11,500 BP, solid evidence does not
as of yet support their existence. The argument that artifacts recovered from Levi Rockshelter
in Travis County are older than Paleoindian (Alexander 1983:133-145) is not supported because
the radiocarbon dates are not clustered, and there are no distinct artifact and extinct fauna
assemblages within well-defined stratigraphy (Collins 1995:380-381). Other sites where
assemblages are purportedly pre-Clovis include Friesenhahn Cave (Krieger 1964) and the Waco
Mammoth Site (Fox et al. 1992). Human behavior is inferred on stone artifacts from Friesenhahn
Cave, and mammoth bones at the Waco Site. However, problems of context or dating exist at
both sites (Collins 1995:380-381). The Gault Site in Bell County, Texas has provided by far the
largest Clovis assemblage in all of North America, and with artifacts stratigraphically beneath
the known Clovis component, likely has the best chances of providing conclusive evidence for
a pre-Clovis culture in Texas (Adavasio and Page 2002:292-294; Collins 2009; Collins and
Brown 2000).
Paleoindian Period (pre-8500 BP)
The Paleoindian period began toward the close of the Pleistocene, and in North-central Texas
is dated to before 8500 BP. Diagnostic artifacts of the early Paleoindian interval include Clovis
and Folsom projectile points. The wide distribution of Clovis-type points across most of North
America and even into North-central Texas suggests a wide dispersal and interaction of the
people who made them (Kelly 1993; Wenke 1990:201). Within Texas's political boundaries,
Bever and Meltzer (2007) have documented the presence of 544 Clovis points in 149 of 254
counties. Although none have been recorded in their database from Tarrant County, 27 have been
documented from the North-Central Texas region. Other artifacts associated with the Clovis
culture include bifaces and prismatic blades, engraved stones, bone and ivory points, stone bolas,
ochre, and shaft straighteners.

11

Although the Paleoindian adaptation had been considered to be one of small bands of nomadic,
big-game hunters following herds of Late Pleistocene fauna (e.g., mammoth, mastodons, bison,
camel, and horse) across North America (Black 1989), more recent discoveries have emphasized
the wide diversity of plants and animals used for subsistence by these early Americans (Black
1989; Hester 1983). In addition to bison and deer, smaller animals such as turtles and tortoises,
alligators, mice, badgers, and raccoons were eaten (Collins 1995:381), although they
undoubtedly hunted the large animals as well (Dibble and Lorraine 1968). The mistaken
conception that human hunters caused the demise of the now-extinct megafauna has essentially
been debunked (e.g., Cannon and Meltzer 2004; Grayson and Meltzer 2002). Known Clovis sites
include killsites, quarries, caches, open campsites, ritual sites, and burials (Collins
1995:381-383; Hester 1995:433-436). One of the few in situ early Paleoindian sites in Texas is
the Aubrey site (41DN479) in Denton County (Ferring 1989; 2001).
Lanceolate forms such as Dalton, Plainview, Golondrina, Midland, and Scottsbluff are diagnostic
to the late Paleoindian period in North-Central Texas (Prikryl 1990), and has been characterized
as transitional between the Early Paleoindian and the Early Archaic. This latter period and the
early part of the Early Archaic are the least understood and therefore the most difficult to
culturally and chronologically to define. It is clear that the lanceolate-shaped forms that were
generally thought to be late Paleoindian in age continue into what we know today as the Early
Archaic. In addition, the transition from lanceolate style points to early corner notched does not
seem to hold consistent with the transition from Paleoindian to Archaic lifeways. For example,
unfluted lanceolate points at Wilson-Leonard were dated between 9500 and 8000 B.P., while the
Wilson component with corner notched Archaic-like Wilson dart points was dated to about
10,000 - 9650 B.P. Despite the obvious difference in time, which places the Wilson component
as the older occupation, it exhibits an impression much more Archaic than Paleoindian in nature,
with fire cracked rock features, a burial, and a wider variety of stone tools and faunal remains
(Collins 2004).
In sum, more is known about the lifeways of Early Paleoindian, Folsom and Clovis cultures than
is known about the Late Paleoindian/Early Archaic, with both stemmed lanceolate and
corner-notch forms. A lot more work is needed before we can begin to understand how the early
corner notched tradition fits into the cultural and chronological interpretations of both the Late
Paleoindian and Archaic periods in Texas.
As the warming that marks the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene climates began to take
effect in Texas, prehistoric inhabitants adapted with changes in lifestyle. This climatic shift is
also marked by the decline and extinction of mammoth, mastodon, horse, camel, and giant bison
(Bison antiquus). Most archaeological evidence suggests that after 8000 BP, large gregarious
game animals were perhaps extinct in Texas. Human hunters were forced to concentrate on deer,
antelope, and other medium-sized or smaller game. Changes in the subsistence base required
technological shifts that mark the beginning of a new cultural period known as the Archaic.

12

Early Archaic Period (8500-6000 BP)
Most Early Archaic sites occur in the uplands, and are usually in a palimpsest condition or
scattered. Diagnostic projectile points usually found on the surface are Angostura, Gower,
Martindale, Uvalde, possibly Hoxie, and early Split Stemmed (Prikryl 1990; Ferring and Yates
1997; Mauldin and Figueroa 2006). While the basic hunter-gatherer adaptation probably
remained intact, an economic shift away from big game hunting was necessary. In general, more
intensive exploitation of local and smaller resources in Central Texas-such as deer, fish, and
plant bulbs-is indicated by greater densities of ground stone artifacts, fire-cracked rock cooking
features, and more specialized tools such as Clear Fork gouges and Guadalupe bifaces (Turner
and Hester 1999:246, 256). Weir (1976) speculates that Early Archaic groups were small and
highly mobile, an inference based on the fact that Early Archaic sites are thinly distributed and
that diagnostic projectile point types are seen across a wide area, including most of Texas and
northern Mexico. Story (1985) believes that population densities were low during the Early
Archaic, and that groups consisted of related individuals in small bands with "few constraints
on their mobility" (Story 1985:39). Their economy was based on the utilization of a wide range
of resources, especially such year-round resources as prickly pear and lechugilla, as well as
rodents, rabbits, and deer (Story 1985:38).
Middle Archaic Period (6000-3500 BP)
The Middle Archaic period in North-Central is also poorly understood and ill-defined,a lthough
Prikryl (1990) sees some evidence of cultural change toward the end of the period. Diagnostic
projectile points include Calf Creek, Bell, Andice, Wells, Dawson, Carrollton, Morrill, and
Bulverde (Prikryl 1990; Ferring and Yates 1997; Mauldin and Figueroa 2006). Features and data
from the Calvert Site (41DN102) suggest that the region was very dry during this period, and that
those who occupied the region were generally highly mobile, moving frequently, hunting deer
and small game. Some of the tool types found suggest that there was apparent social interaction
among surrounding regions (Ferring and Yates 1997).
In Central Texas, the Middle Archaic appears to have been a time of increased population, based
on the large number of sites from this period (Story 1985:40; Weir 1976:125, 128). The reasons
for this increase are not known, but the onset of a very dry period (Altithermal) is often suspected
(Sollberger and Hester 1972:338; Story 1985:40; Padilla and Nickels 2010). Weir (1976:126)
suggests that as the climate became moister, deer and acorn thrived in Central Texas, attracting
groups at least seasonally from all other regions of Texas. And, although he is discussing the
Early Archaic, McKinney (1981:114) suggests that as the climate became drier, groups from
other regions used to arid conditions, would have moved into the Central Texas Hill Country.
Late Archaic Period (3500-1250 BP)
Late Archaic sites can generally be found along creek floodplains. The number of Late Archaic
component sites documented in North-Central Texas increase significantly (three-fold) from the
Middle to the Late Archaic, and their less repeated usage suggest a significant increase in a
population that is now more sedentary. This is further evidenced by a wider variety of tools
procured from more local resources rather than in long distance trade or movement. In addition,
ground stone used in plant processing are present.

These small bands of hunters and gatherers predominately exploited deer, rabbit, turtle, and fresh
water mussels as they moved seasonally across the landscape. Diagnostic projectile points
include Castroville, Dallas, Edgewood, Ellis, Elam, Gary, Godley, Marshall, Palmillas, Trinity,
and Yarbrough (Prykryl 1990; Brownlow et al. 1999; Mauldin and Figueroa 2006).
Late Prehistoric Period I (1250-750 BP)
This early phase of the Late Prehistoric is generally viewed as a continutation of the huntergatherer lifeways that were so prevalent during the Late Archaic, but is differentiated primarily
by the introduction of sand and grog-tempered ceramics, and the bow and arrow (Lynott 1977;
Prikryl 1990). Presumably the bow and arrow was a much more effective bison-killing toolkit,
and the introduction of ceramics presumes a need for storage and cooking vessels used in a more
sedentary way of life. Diagnostic arrow points from this period include Alba, Catahoula,
Scallorn, and Steiner (Lynott 1977; Prikryl 1990; Mauldin and Figueroa 2006). Although during
this same time period the Woodland culture provides strong evidence of horticultural practices,
none is readily evident in North-Central Texas (Perttula 2004). Probably because of the presence
of bison during this time, the North-Central Texas region at the southern end of the Great Plains
was largely unaffected by the subsistence practices and cultures from adjacent regions.
Late Prehistoric Period II (750-250 BP)
Although the hunting and gathering lifeways that were so characteristic of the earlier part of the
Late Prehistoric are still evident at some sites, there is at least one site that clearly represents a
very sedentary presence. At the Cobb-Pool site (41DL148), evidence of house structures,
roasting pit, charred corn, and grog-tempered ceramic was found in contexts dating to around
750 BP (AD 1200) (Lintz et al. 2008). In addition examination of excavated burials in Dallas
County indicate that the indiviuals were consuming maize roughly during roughly that same time
period (Cliff et al. 1996; Peter and Clow 1999). This seems to represent a significant transition
and cultural change, with the degree of outside influence if any, as yet unknown. Ceramics
diagnostic from this period include Nocona Plainware, and arrow points include unstemmed
triangular types such as Fresno, Harrell, Maud, Perdiz, and Washita (Lynott 1977; Prikryl 1990)
Protohistoric Period (350/250-150 BP)
The end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic period in both North-Central Texas
is characterized by written accounts of European contact with indigenous groups. Although a few
Spanish entradas entered the Southern Plains area in the 1500s, there is no record of the Native
American groups that occupied North-Central Texas during that time. By the middle of the 18th
century, the Wichita tribe had moved south and now claimed North-Central Texas as part of their
territory, settling on the upper reaches of the Red, Brazos, Trinity, and Sabine rivers (Figure 12;
see also, Bolton 1915:3-4, map insert). “The principal divisions known in Texas were the
Tayovayas, Tawakoni, Kichai, and Yscanis. As distinguished from the Apache and the coast
tribes, the Indians of northern and eastern Texas were collectively spoken of as ‘Nortenos’, or
Nations of the Earth” (Bolton 1915:4). Contact with these groups by French traders was
common, and French trade along the Red River in with the Comanche to the west and the
Caddoans to the east. The Wichita tribes were skillful in war, trade, and treachery. They supplied
agricultural goods and French guns to the Comanche, stole horses and mules from the Spanish,
14

and took captives from the Apache and
Spaniards. The French benefitted the
most by receiving the captives and
stolen Spanish livestock in return for
guns (Bolton 1915:36; Bell 1984;
Hofman 1989; Perttula 1992).
Historic Period (Post-150 BP)
White settlers were ever moving
westward, and the Indians continued
their raids. In 1840 settlers in the area
sought protection in Bird’s Fort near
present-day Euless. By 1844, the
Kiowa-Comanches had encroached
eastward, into the Wichita territory.
Modern-day Fort Worth was then on the
eastern edge of the Kiowa-Comanche
habitat as claimed by Comanche Chief
Buffalo Hump at the Council of
Tehuacana Creek near present-day Figure 12. Location of the Wichita Tribe in the Fort
Waco in 1844 (Bolton 1915; Wallace Worth area in the early 1800s. (Map reproduced with
1960; Hofman 1989; Dallas County permission from Texas Beyond History.net)
2010). The treaty reduced Indian
depredations and a trading post was established at Marrow Bone Springs along either Johnson
Creek or Rush Creek in 1845. The Texas Rangers then headquartered there in 1847. In 1849, the
US Army established Camp Worth at the confluence of the Clear and West forks of the Trinity
River, and it was soon renamed Fort Worth (Schmelzer 2010).
In1856, the Butterfield Overland Mail and the Southern Pacific Stage Line were operating in Fort
Worth. Fort Worth became the county seat in April 1860, but the town’s growth was significantly
and negatively impacted by the Civil War and Reconstruction. Eventually the city rebounded,
primarily on the back of the cattle industry. Fort Worth earned the monacle ‘Cowtown’ as it
welcomed and catered to cowboys on the cattle drives to enroute to Abilene, Kansas, as well as
northern cattle buyers (Figure 13). This new growth then invited new stage lines and railroads
in the late 1800s (Pape 1994; Schmelzer 2010).
Cowboys needed to blow off steam, and Hell's Half Acre around the stockyards was ripe with
houses of prostitution, saloons, and bandits. The Texas Dressed Beef and Packing Company, the
Union Stockyards Company, and the Fort Worth Stockyards Company were formed in the 1890s,
and Armour and Swift later opened meat-packing plants in Fort Worth. Thus, the eat processing
and packing industries provided for rapid growth throughout the twentieth century in to
metropolis it is today, absorbing smaller hinterland communities in the process. The population
grew from over 6,600 in 1880 to nearly 535,000 in the year 2000 (Schmelzer 2010).

Trail Drivers Park
The first herd of cattle driven from south Texas was probably the one owned by Colonel J. J.
Meyers, and that trailed from Lockhart, Texas in Caldwell County enroute to Sedalia, Missouri
in early 1866 (Hunter 1985; Pate 1988). At the height of the drives, there were as many as 30,000
to 40,000 head at the stockyards daily. Although there was more than one route from south Texas
leading to Fort Worth, once the herds got close, they were almost sure to cross the Trinity at
Dagget’s Crossing (Pate 1994; Shaw 1996). From there the drovers would herd them “...around
the hill where Trail Drivers’ Park is now located on Twenty-eighth Street, and turned north” (Pate
1994:16).
From Trail Drivers Park they would then generally follow today’s IH-35 North toward Kansas or
Missouri. J’Nell Pate (1994:33) describes the dedication of Trail Drivers Park as follows:

16

“In honor of businessmen who had capitalized on the millions of cattle that
came through the North Side and the earliest cowboys who trailed the herds
northward, city leaders dedicated Trail Drivers’ Park just off 28th Street,
northeast of the stockyards. When the City of Fort Worth purchased thirtyseven acres of land for a park in 1928, George W. Sanders of San Antonio,
president of the Old Trail Drivers Association, wrote to the Fort Worth
Board of Park Commissioners suggesting that the park they were
contemplating in Diamond Hill be named ‘Trail Drivers Park to
commemorate the trail herds and their drivers who bedded down in the area
on their way north to Abilene. Saunders estimated that sixty percent of the
ten million cattle driven to northern markets in those early days came
through Fort Worth. He had driven many of them himself.”
“A Diamond Hill Civic League, organized in 1925, also urged the city to
create the thirty-seven acre park. They assisted with the $13,000 cost and
constructed a lighted softball diamond. Trail Drivers’ Park is the only park
in Texas to honor the thousands of nameless cowboys who made history.
Standing on a hillside overlooking the Trinity River, the park encompasses
a site where these same brave fellows kept watch for Indians, prairie fires,
or just rested after their herds crossed the muddy Trinity”.
The stream that runs through the western edge of Trail Drivers Park at the base of the hill is now
referred to as Lebow Channel. However, it was once called Gilmore’s Branch, named after
Seaborn Gilmore, an early frontiersman and settler who came to the area in June 1848 in a
covered wagon with his wife, daughter Martha, son-in-law John B. York, and Seaborn’s
grandchildren, and settled in what is now known as the Diamond Hill area (Pate 1994:1-11).

Archaeological Investigations within One Kilometer of Trail Drivers Park
An on-line review of the Texas Atlas indicated that the park had not been surveyed for cultural
resources, and there were no recorded sites within the park. However, because the project area is
situated adjacent to an intermittent stream and a first-order tributary of the Trinity River,
particular attention was given to the potential for discovering prehistoric cultural material and
archaeological sites. In addition, a preliminary review of the historic publications available
pertaining to the project area suggested a moderate probability that cultural remains from late 19th
century cowboy/traildriver campsites may still be extant.
Relevant to these themes, there are no prehistoric component sites recorded within one kilometer
of the project area. The closest prehistoric site (41TR203) lies 1.9 kilometers to the southeast. It
is documented as a surface scatter of burned rock and freshwater mussel shells, but appears to be
otherwise deeply stratified on Trinity River terraces. Historically, the project area lies adjacent
to the eastern portion of the Fort Worth Stockyards National Register Historic District, roughly
17

bounded by 23rd, Houston, and 28th Streets, and the Missouri Pacific Rail Tracks. In addition,
multiple historic markers within one kilometer of the project area mark the locations of both past
and present structures and historic locales dating to the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It is
within both of these prehistoric and historic contextual themes that we evaluated Trail Drivers
Park during the current project.

Project Goals, Methods, and Levels of Effort
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with limited shovel testing. The topics addressed were
site type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The theoretical framework is
structured around both prehistoric and historic patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and
social systems for the North-Central Texas Archaeological Region.
The goals of the project were to:
1)
locate and record cultural locations and sites in the project area using a systematic
survey methodology;
2)
quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy; and,
3)
place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.
Methods and Levels of Effort
Prefield Preparation
As stated previously, before the official survey began, the Principal Investigator reviewed the
Texas Archeological Site database to determine what archaeological sites had been recorded
within one kilometer of the project area. Following that, a thorough review of the literature
pertaining to the area was conducted, and site and survey reports from the area were examined.
Then, a current USGS 7.5 quadrangle map, a soils map, and a geological atlas sheet were
consulted. Finally, a review of past aerial photographs and topographic maps were obtained from
various sources.
Old Aerial Photographs and Maps
One of the primary sources that is easily accessible for past Birdseye Panoramic Maps, City Maps,
Sanborn Insurance Maps, and USGS Topographic maps is the Perry Castañeda Library (2010),
available on the internet. The area that is now Trail Drivers Park was not covered by any maps
or Birdseyes from late 1800s or early 1900s. However a search of this invaluable asset revealed
that the earliest available map that covered the area was a City of Fort Worth Map from 1925
(Figure 14). Notably, through streets at the time included Guenther and Irion, and Brenham
Avenue has been re-routed.
Additional archival research produced a City of Fort Worth Map and Street Guide from 1930
(Figure 15). Note the additional streets that ran through the Trail Drivers Park area, and are now
18

no longer there. Thus, it
is apparent that the Park
area has undergone
significant changes,
resulting in the inherent
disturbance of any intact
cultural resources that
may have existed prior to
1930.
An aerial photograph
taken some 51 years
later, in 1981, reveals
that the east-west cross
streets through the Park
area are no longer there,
and Guenther Avenue no
longer runs through the
park from north to south.
Instead, the ball field
with parking lots both to
its north and south are
now there (Figure 16).
Figure 14. 1925 City Map of Fort Worth (Perry Castañeda Library
2010)
An aerial photograph
taken in 2009 is shown with the shovel
tests excavated during the current project
in Figure 17. Note that the parking lots
and ball diamond are improved. Also,
there is a new sidewalk leading
northwest from the parking lot at the
southern end of Guenther Avenue, and
winding up slope, and twisting back
south to a pavilion overlooking the park
Overall, the northern portion of the park
that would have in times past likely
featured benched areas of exposed
bedrock now appears to have been
manicured by the introduction of fill and Figure 15. City of Fort Worth Map - 1930 (Utter and

Pedestrian Survey
In accordance with Texas
Historical Commission (THC)
and C ounci l of Tex as
Archeologists (CTA)
Archaeology Survey Standards,
a systematic, 100-percent
pedestrian survey of the park
was conducted, and surface
visibility ranged from 0 to 100percent. Although the park north
of Brennan Avenue was
generally cleared and manicured,
most of the park south of
Brennan Avenue consisted of
deep gullies and thick understory
(Figure 18). Within the upper,
northeastern portion of the park
there were frequent surface
exposures of limestone bedrock
All along the entire length
Lebow Channel, numerous
cutbanks ranging from 2 to 4
meters deep were examined
(e.g., Figures 19 and 20).
During the pedestrian survey it
was readily apparent that
although relatively small in
length and width, the constricted
Lebow channel had been
subjected to rapid runoff and
erosion. Although not dated, a
visual inspection of the cutbanks
revealed alternating episodes of
stratified gravels, coarse sand,
and loam (e.g. Figures 20 and
21). Two collapsed bridge
crossings were observed, one to
the south of Brennan Avenue
(see Figure 19), and one in the
upper portion of the park
(Figure 22).

removals and realignments, during our visual
inspection of the terrain and surface in 2010, numerous sewer manholes were observed. For
example, a main sewer line runs from the northeast through a valley in the northeastern portion
of the park (Figure 22), and another effluent line enters Lebow channel south of Brennan Avenue
(Figure 23). Lebow Channel has also been artificially constrained both north and south of Brennan
Avenue (Figure 24). Otherwise, what the geologic and soils maps indicate should be stepped and
eroded terrain features now appear to have been artificially contoured, smoothed, and filled (e.g.,
Figure 25).

Avenue; facing south.

A total of 74 shovel tests were excavated over the 47 acres surveyed. Shovel tests were excavated
to a depth of at least 60 cm; or if shallower, to the depth of sterile Pleistocene soils or bedrock.
All shovel test locations were mapped on field maps, and their locations recorded with a handheld Global Positioning System (GPS). The projected path of the new hike-and bike trail, as well
as the locations of shovel tests are presented both on a 2009 aerial photograph, as well as on the
latest USGS Topographic available (Figures 26 and 27).
Sediments from the shovel tests were excavated in 20-cm increments, and screened through 1/4inch wire mesh. However, copious field notes were made regarding changes in soils and
sediments, regardless of 20-cm increments (see Appendix A). The results of shovel testing were
recorded on standard shovel test forms. The Scope of Work specified that if cultural materials
were encountered that indicated the likelihood of an archaeological site, then additional shovel
tests would be excavated at closer intervals in order to further define the horizontal extent of the
site.
Cultural materials of a redundant nature, both prehistoric and historic, observed either on the
surface or within shovel tests was not to be collected. Instead, they were to be fully documented
via sketches, field photographs, and copious notes. Following that they would be returned to the
surface if surface finds, or to the top 10 cm of shovel tests.
Exceptions were to be those artifacts which could be considered as particularly significant to the
interpretation of Texas prehistory, such as Early Archaic-Paleoindian transitional, or Paleoindian
diagnostics. Those were to be collected on a case-by-case basis, and that decision was left up to
the Principal Investigator and/or the Project Archaeologist.

Results of the Investigation
No evidence of prehistoric occupation of the park area was observed either on, or below the
surface; not even a piece of chipped stone. While only an assumption on our part, this could be
due to any of three factors: (1) the significant artificial contouring and disturbance to the park area
within the past 50 years, (2) the relatively recent dynamic erosional forces of Lebow Channel,
enhanced by post-Dust Bowl environmental conditions and modern stream channelization efforts,
and (3) some archaeological sites in the area exhibit evidence of burned clay and bone, but with
few if any pieces of lithic debitage (e.g., 41DL436; Feit and Campbell 2005).
Small pieces of scattered, modern trash such as plastic, bottle caps, clear glass, brown beer bottle
glass, and highly-fired whiteware sherds were very commonly observed on the surface throughout
the park, and were also found in several shovel tests at varying depths (Appendix A). The
recovery of modern glass and/or whiteware in Shovel Tests (STs) C9 and E3 (Figure 26)
prompted the excavation of additional shovel tests in the immediate area to further investigate the
possibility that older deposits (ca. Pre-1950) existed. Two additional shovel tests were placed in
close proximity to ST C9, and five were placed in close proximity to ST E3 (see Figures 26 and
27) . In both cases, no evidence of pre-1950 cultural material was discovered.
The only historic artifacts (pre-1950) observed were two bottle glass shards and a whiteware sherd
found on a heavily eroded surface on the east edge of Lebow Channel in the northern portion of
the park (Figures 28 and 29). Two shovel probes in thin soils to limestone bedrock were both
negative (STs 8 and 9; Figure 26). No additional historic artifacts were observed on the surface
after a thorough examination of the surrounding area.

Figure 28. Field photo of historic glass and
whiteware.

Figure 29. Eroded surface on the east edge of
Lebow Channel where two Historic glass
shards and a whiteware sherd were found;
facing east.

The two glass shards are thick, and broken from a bottle that was aqua colored. Both pieces
exhibit evidence of minimal patina on their external surfaces, suggesting that they were buried
26

relatively quickly post-depositionally. Aqua colored glass bottles can be relatively dated from
about 1880 through 1900 (Kendrick 1966:53; Munsey 1970:69). In addition, the mold seam
remnant on the base of one piece is that of a hand mold, indicating a date of manufacture before
1903 (Munsey 1970). The whiteware sherd is from small bowl, is moderately fired, has off white
paste, and exhibits a crackled, burned interior surface. Whitewares could have been introduced
to the area as early as 1860 (Fox et al. 1989), but the characteristics of this specimen suggest it
is likely more temporally contemporaneous with the aqua colored glass pieces.

Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
A 100% pedestrian survey of the surface that offered up to 100% visibility of sporadic composites
of barren soil and bedrock within the project area was conducted, but no evidence of neither
prehistoric nor historic occupation of significance was found. In addition, no cultural materials
of significant value were found in any of a total of 74 shovel tests excavated. Therefore, we
recommend that the project should proceed as currently designed by the project sponsor. The
project should be considered as having “no effect” on any properties considered as eligible for
nomination to the National Register of Historic Places or inclusion in the State Archaeological
Landmarks Program. As such, the project should proceed without further archaeological work.
However, if any cultural resources are encountered during construction, work should immediately
be halted in the vicinity until such finds are examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by
any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the Texas Historical Commission.
