Annual Bulletin
covers baskets,
bison, farming

Articles vary from prehistoric agriculture to Kickapoo baskets in the 2012
Oklahoma Anthropological
Society Bulletin.
Edited and compiled
by Bob Brooks of the Oklahoma Archeology Survey,
the 90-page Bulletin is the
first in years to include an
article on Native American
culture, Dr Brooks says in
his introduction.
Marshall Getty’s
discussion on Kickapoo
basketry notes Oklahoma’s
unique position as home to
39 Native American tribes.
He describes Kickapoo
basketry as among the least
collected and most poorly
represented in public and
private assemblies.
Getty’s brief article
highlights Kickapoo baskets and mats that may be
encountered by a collector in
Oklahoma.
“Settled in the area
just east of Oklahoma City
near Meeker, OK, the Kickapoo continue to shun many
Euro-American influences,
and for the most part items
produced by traditional craft
artists are consumed by the
Kickapoo themselves with
only a limited amount of material made for the outside
market,” Getty says.
His article includes
a generous bibliography and
references.
Next, Lee Bement, Kent Buehler, and
Brian Carter discuss a late
paleoindian bison kill near

Longest Site Dig
(Continued from Page 1)
University, Stillwater, and Susan
Vehik of the University of Oklahoma,
Norman.
For several years they
have researched Wichita Indian villages in Oklahoma, focusing on the
Bryson-Paddock site near Ponca
City. The Indians that lived along
the Arkansas River there eventually
moved to the Red River.
The natives learned from
their years under siege from the
northern Osage. By the time they
relocated south, the villagers improved security.
They fashioned circular
stockades, exterior ditches and interior horse corrals. The stockade had
underground tunnels that sheltered
people in an attack.
Round, grass-thatch houses
made up the Taovayas village outside the stockade.

The Wichitas also allied
with the most powerful tribe of the
Southern Plains, the Comanche,
who had no love for the Apaches
they drove from the region.
The Comanches camped
near the Wichita village, an arrangement of mutual benefit.
Attacks from the south
gave the Wichitas added protection
from the sandy banks and swirling
waters of the Red River.
“There were trade advantages to the Red River,” Dr. Drass
said. “The French were active
there, as they had been on the Arkansas River. So it’s a continuation
of the Bryson-Paddock story.”
Excavators initially worked
the area in 1965-1966, Dr. Drass
said. Recent magnetic and radar
surveys show promising anomalies.
Those will be among items examined in the Spring Dig.

Getting there
The 2013 OAS Spring Dig starts May 24 at the
Longest Site west of Marietta.
Dig Director Richard Drass will be at the site earlier in the week to set up the grid and prepare excavation units. To offer help, volunteers can contact him
at rdrass@ou.edu.
Excavation hours are 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Available lodging is scarce in the immediate area.
Lake Country Motel in Marietta, a ground level inn
with moderate prices, offers lodging for four nights at
a small discount (ask for it). Call (580) 276-3316.
Not recommended: Ardmore motels (40 miles
away) Winstar Casino (expensive), or Falconhead Resort (booked up).
No camping is available at the dig site. Foxwoods RV Park, 12 miles west of Marietta on SH 32,
has camper/RV hookups. Call (580) 276-4538.

Reaching the site
A carpool will leave the east parking lot at the
Marietta Homeland store at 8 a.m. each day of the
dig. OAS signs will mark the way. For additional
directions call Dr. Drass at (405) 640-1067.

Richard Drass points out survey anomalies
to volunteers during the 2007 OAS Dig at the
Bryson-Paddock site near Ponca City.

Drass speaking on Longest Site
at OAS chapters, OSU in Alva
Several OAS chapters have asked Richard Drass to
discuss the Longest archeological site and its history.
Dr. Drass speaks March 6 in Ponca City, March 12 in
Ada and May 2 at the Oklahoma City chapter. He also appears March 26 at Northwestern Oklahoma State University in
Alva.
His topic is “The Wichita, Spanish and French in the
18th Century: Archeology at the Longest Site.” The new show
includes Power Point slides.
Historians trace the Wichita moving south to the Red
River from sites near Ponca City. In short order the Indians
developed several successful villages along the river boundary of Oklahoma and Texas. They favored the French with
their trade.
The Spanish, firmly established in Texas, sent troops
north in 1759 to punish the Wichita and allied tribes for incursions against southern missions and forts.
Col. Diego Ortiz Parrilla marched a force of 500 from
San Antonio to the Indian village. In a rout, Wichita warriors
and allies forced the Spanish to flee south.
Such attacks proved to be of little consequence.
In 1965-1966, excavations at a site about 15 miles
south of Ringling revealed the Taovayas village detailed in the
Spanish records of the Parrilla expedition.
Aerial photos of a large circular stain in the soil similar
to those known for other archeological sites in Oklahoma (at
the Duncan and Deer Creek sites) led to further excavations
at the Longest.
The research suggested the circular stain was evidence of a log stockade constructed by the Wichita to protect
their village.

“The realization that

to the development of specific analytical tools directed
at extracting information
from the bones,” the article
states.
Building on research
by eminent archeologist
George Frison, the excavators hope to apply concepts
developed for Northern
Plains hunting societies to
the Southern Plains site. Under Dr. Bement’s leadership,
plans are to return in June
2013 with a field school.
The Bulletin’s theme of
neglected topics continues in

a third article. It covers the foundation for
early prehistoric agriculture in northeast
Oklahoma.
Dr. Brooks relies on data from a
Lake Hudson collection by astute amateurs, the Ron Yost family. Many of 3,600
specimens were gathered before construction of the lake northeast of Tulsa on
the Arkansas River watershed. On hand
are hundreds of projectile points, bifaces,
unifaces, cores and ground stone items.
Dr. Brooks focuses on chipped
stone hoes, manos, metates and hammer stones from four sites, working out
evidence of early agriculture in a fertile
floodplain. He concludes the area’s late
archaic/woodland groups practiced gardening as a supplement to hunting and
gathering of edible plant foods.
“This early agricultural system derived from indigenous starchy seed plants
serves as the base for future agricultural
enhancements that include tropical domesticates,” the article said.
Finally, Chris Lintz and Bob
Wishoff examine the Antelope Creek
phase in the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles. Their attention is on doublebitted axes much more commonly associated with sites in the two states’ eastern
woodlands.

Chipped stone axes are rarely reported
in assemblages from the southern High Plains
region, the authors say. They examine 23 axes
and ax-like specimens, about half of the number
recovered from WPA excavations at the Alibates
ruins in the northern Texas Panhandle.
Since the antelope Creek phase buildings might number in the thousands, chipped
stone axes would have been essential. Some
axes might have been traded out of the area,
some were reused as hammer stones and mauls.
Others might have served as

Foundation grants boost
Great Plains Museum
in renovating Gallery,
touring science exhibits
The Museum of the Great Plains is benefiting from $7 million in new Reynolds Foundation grants for renovation of the main gallery and
sharing traveling science exhibits.
Museum Director of Development Bart
McClenny said the grants will not only update
the look and function of the museum, they will
benefit visitors with hands-on displays.
The Donald W. Reynolds Foundation
awarded the museum $4 million to renovate
17,000 square feet of space in the main display
area. A two-year plan is well under way. Renovation should be done by November 2015, McClenny said.
Much of the museum’s display is devoted to anthropology and archeology. Some of
the state’s outstanding mammoth remains can
be found there.
A separate Reynolds grant of $3 million
funds a network of museums that provide highquality, hands-on educational experiences.

“Rather than provide
passive observations, we’re
going to offer experiences

McClenny said.

David Fowler named Director of Historic Fort Gibson
David Fowler has

Chris Morgan has
retired as the fort’s director
after 30 years with OHS,
said Dickson, Director of
the museums and historic
sites division. Fowler was
promoted from his position
as Director of the George
Murrell Home in nearby Park

Fowler started his career
at the Historic Society as a

eral seasons excavating the
historic fort. Most recently
OAS, led by archeologist
Lee Bement, searched for
evidence of the original fort
built in 1824.
Initially, Fowler was
named Interim Director of
the fort, expanding his duties at the Murrell Home.
However, Dickson said,
consideration of the best use
of resources changed the
decision.
“As a result, Fowler’s role

was made permanent and
expanded to serve as the
director for the George Murrell Home, Fort Gibson, and
Cabin Creek, a Civil War
battlefield near Vinita,” she
said in a December media
release.
The History Society
plans to hire an additional interpreter at the Murrell Home
since Fowler’s new duties
will require more travel.
Bob Blackburn,
History Society Executive Director, said the appointment
will move the state program
forward.
“David is the kind
of leader who will help the
Oklahoma Historical Society
be more effective,” Dr. Blackburn said. “He is creative,
dedicated, and willing to
work with other groups and
organizations who share our
passion for historic Fort Gibson and the regional history
of Muskogee, the Creek and

Cherokee nations, and the
Indian Territory.”
A member of the
Cherokee Nation, Fowler is
a graduate of Northeastern
State University in Tahlequah. He has extensive
background in American
Indian history and historical
interpretation. His specific
interest is the Cherokees
and their removal to Indian
Territory.
“I am looking forward to the challenges of the
new position,” Fowler said in
the news release. “My first
two priorities are moving
forward with the restoration
work on the stockade and
building a closer relationship
with the community.”
Prior to starting
his career in 2001 at Fort
Gibson, he volunteered for
programs there. In July 2009
Fowler moved to Park Hill to
serve as the Director of the
Murrell Home.

your talent and time. It would
be great to have a miniknap-off for flint knappers.
We would appreciate having
others with Native American skills. Possibilities are
Native American dancing
by members of the Wichita,
Caddo, Cherokee and Choctaw tribes; Native American
chunkee, a ball game; and
demonstrations of bow making, bows and arrows, blow
guns, darts and atlatls.
People with expertise in archeology of the
region are most welcome.
Talks on the Mississippian
culture, before and after the
advent of Europeans, are

always good. So are presentations on the removal
of Choctaw, Cherokee and
other tribes to Oklahoma.
Finally, we need
expertise in identifying what
visitors bring to show us.
Volunteers from the Oklahoma Archeological Survey
will be here, but sometimes
there’s a line of visitors who
have numerous items to
examine.
There’s also booth
space to rent to those with
displays or items for sale.
The fee is $20, and sales
tax is required. We would
like to expand the vendors,
but whatever you sell would
need to be related to Native
American art, archeology, or

history.

Of course, displays cannot be artifacts or
firearms. If you are a flint
knapper and your points are
identified as modern, i.e.
signed, then those could be
sold.
We would love to
have vendors that sold nontraditional foods, like Indian
tacos or powwow foods. We
don’t have much electric
outlets or space inside, so
some vendors would need to
be outside.
Remember that it
is important to remind the
general public of the role of
archeology in Oklahoma.

Arkansas Survey offers website on novaculite comparisons
Arkansas
Archeological Survey is launching a
website comparing novaculite found in the Ouachita
Mountains.
Accessed at http://

site is presented as “Arkansas Novaculite: A Virtual
Comparative Collection.”
Novaculite was chipped

the past.
It is still used today,
manufactured as whetstones,
according to Mary Beth Trubitt of the Arkansas Archeological Survey in Arkadelphia,
AR.
The Archeological Survey is part of the University of
Arkansas system.
The website is an
educational resource for
people interested in Arkansas history, archeology, and
Indians of Arkansas. It also
is a research tool for archeologists who need to identify
novaculite from archeological
sites, Trubitt said.

Oklahoma archeology
in the news
Forensic archeologists have been busy in recent months as widespread
drought expanded shore
lines and exposed ancient
remains. Those and other
archeological ties to Oklahomans recently made the
news.

Lake Eufaula yields
Prehistoric remains

Foul play was first
suspected when skeletons of
two people were recovered
in Lake Eufaula, according
to Jan. 21 news reports in
Tulsa and McAlester.
The bones were
about 20 feet apart and
appeared stacked. A cinderblock tied by cable was lying
between the skeletons, staff
writer Jeanne LeFlore said in
the McAlester News.
Pittsburg County
Sheriff Joel Kerns said the
cables and blocks probably
came from an old trotline.
The receding lake level
exposed the remains of what
was until recently under
water.
“A lot of people do
use rocks or cinder blocks to
anchor their lines,” the sheriff
said.
He did not know
why the bones appeared to
be stacked. Several people
reported sighting the bones
along the shoreline.
An anthropologist from the state Medical
Examiner’s office and an
Oklahoma State Bureau of
Investigation agent was sent
to the scene. Although unnamed in the story, forensic
anthropologist Angela Berg
determined the bones were
most likely the remains of
prehistoric American Indians.
The bones may be
as old as 2,000 years. Teeth
marks appear to made by

food common to the human diet.
The area could be an ancient burial
ground since tribes often interred
their dead along a water course.

Human bones appear
in Duncan area field

Law authorities called a
forensic archeology team to Stephens County in January to examine
human bones.
Sheriff Wayne McKinney first
considered the bones a cold case
crime, according to news reports in
The Duncan Banner and The Lawton Constitution. Found by a rancher
near Duncan, the human remains
were discovered along a fence line
at Mud Creek.
Lawmen remained on the
scene overnight. When examiners
arrived, they determined the skull
and bones to be anywhere from 800
to 1,000 years old. Although unnamed in the story, the investigators
were led by Kent Buehler, a forensic archeologist at the Oklahoma
Archeological Survey in Norman.

Several Native
American people shared
the land.

Cherokee road crews
find human graves

Dozens of grave sites
have been discovered by
crews preparing a road project near State Highway 100,
according to a Tahlequah
Daily Press story.
Officials with the
Cherokee Nation said crews
were working in eastern
Cherokee County. The highway connects Interstate 40
with the Arkansas state line
near Stilwell.
The Oct. 6 story
said crews came across two
unmarked stones. Ground
penetrating radar identified
61 potential grave sites in
the same area, said Cherokee Nation Roads Department Director Michael Lynn.
An archeologist is
coordinating with the tribe
for further study of the radar
scans.
“Whatever the finding, we
are going to avoid the area,”
said Lynn. “The Cherokee
Nation promotes preserving history and culture and
would never cause harm to
a community resting place.”

Fossil feces reveal
lives of ancients
Scientists are
examining coprolites, or fossilized feces, to learn more
about the microbiomes and
lives of ancient humans.
A recent report said
samples were taken from
La Cueva de los Chiquitos
Muertos in northern Mexico.
OU molecular anthropologist Cecil M. Lewis Jr.
and his team found the bacteria treponema in ancient
samples and in modern rural populations. The implication is that both groups have
diets heavy in raw, fibrous
foods, according to a report
in the March/April edition of
Archaeology Magazine.
However, the
microbe does not appear

in the stool of urban
or Western populations, which might be
attributable to more
sanitary living conditions, the article said.
The team also
examined the bacteria
bifidobac appearing in
the stool of breast fed
children in the 1,400year-old sample.
Prevotella bacteria
indicates a diet heavy
in carbohydrates
but relatively low in
proteins.

Anthropologist
reviews designs
on Mimbres pots

Anthropologist
Pat Gilman of the University of Oklahoma
recently discussed the
meaning of designs
on pottery associated with the Mimbres
culture.
The Feb. 19 session, held at Macayo
Central in Phoenix,
explored the topic
“What Is the Meaning
of Mimbres Art?, according to the website
Archaeology Café.
She focused on the
meaning of geometric and naturalistic
designs on black-onwhite pottery.
A noted authority
on the culture, she
highlighted her ongoing efforts to explore
the boundaries of
the Mimbres and her
interpretation of the
evidence encountered
to date.
In December
2012, she discussed
“Mimbres
Beyond
the Mimbres Valley
Homeland” in a similar
format in Tucson.

Acrocanthosaurus: The
Bones Of Contention
Written and published by
Russell Ferrell
History Version 440 Pgs $15

ISBN: 978-0-615-43814-6

Review by Jon Denton
If ever there was a
perfect book for avid dinosaur fans, it’s Russell Ferrell’s “Acrocanthosaurus.”
A David-and-Goliath
story based in rural southeast Oklahoma, the tale
follows two amateur paleontologists who recover the big
prize, the bones of Acrocanthosaurus, a rare apex
predator.
That’s just the beginning. The bulk of the story
follows Cephas Hall and Sid
Love in their struggle to keep
their discovery and get it displayed where it belongs. It’s
a tale where academics do
not fare well, linked as they
are with greedy, corrupt and
shifty characters from the
business and political world.
What’s more, it’s
fact, not fiction. It would
make a great film documentary. All the screenplay
needs is to follow the story
to its dynamic climax.
In 1983 Cephas
Hall, a naturalist and outdoors guide, discovers big
bones near the Mountain
Fork River. He gets permission from the property’s
owner, multinational Weyerhaeuser timber company,
to dig. Friend Sid Love joins
him and almost four years
later, before the exposed

bones can crumble in the
air, the excavators have a
nearly-intact skeleton of the
Cretaceous carnivore.
It’s a 16-foot-tall, 40foot-long dino with big teeth
and a powerful body. Most
important: The skeleton still
has its head. Nothing so intact has been found before.
Soon Hall and Love
lay claim to a world-class
specimen eventually valued
at $3 million. In short order
they are besieged by legal
and corporate demands.
When author Ferrell
learns about it, the history
and science teacher turned
author has a couple of other
book projects under way.
Yet he says he can’t resist.
Like the dinosaur bones, the
story will dissolve unless it’s
preserved soon. He even
resorts to self-publishing.
He’s an able but
self-indulgent writer. He
treats his heroes well,
despite some conniving on
their own. He admits bias
against the banking and legal professions and multinational corporations.
Yet his major fault is
telling too much. He’s even
writes two versions, history

and science, for those with
divergent tastes.
The balance of the
cover title is a clue of what’s
ahead: “The True Story of
Cephas Hall and Sid Love,
The Arkansas Hillbilly and
the Choctaw Indian Who
Outsmarted the Corporation
and Saved the Dinosaur.”
Of course, in the end
they do exactly that. For their
trouble they earn a meager
$285,000. But they get to
see the skeleton go where it
belongs, a showcase at the
North Carolina Museum of
Natural Sciences in Raleigh,
NC.

The Statues That Walked:
Unraveling the Mystery
of Easter Island
By Terry Hunt and Carl Lipo

Free Press Pub. 2011
237 pages w/photos $25
ISBN 978-1-4391-5031-3

Review by Neil Garrison
A recent issue of
National Geographic Magazine featured the giant stone
monuments of Easter Island
(Rapa Nui).
As one might expect, this noteworthy publication included some colorful and thought-provoking
art work. It depicted the way
ancient people of that tiny
Pacific island transported
huge stone heads from

quarry to seaside pedestal.
The most noteworthy point: Archeological
experimentation lends credence to ancient oral history.
Islanders say the sculptors
stood the stone monuments
upright and walked them
from the quarries to their
final resting spot.
How the statues
went from rock to beach
has long been a quandary
for Easter Island historians.
Over the years various
methods have been tested
– moving the big stone
heads on logs, sliding them
on sleds, even rolling them
downhill. None quite seemed
up to the task.
I endeavored to
know more. The magazine
article spans a handful of
pages.
I happened to find
this full-length book on the
topic. I devoured the information with anticipation.
The book's authors
described how the monoliths can be wiggled forward much like one would
single-handedly manhandle
a heavy kitchen refrigerator
from one side of the room
to the next. Of course, the
Rapa Nui stone monuments
are more unwieldy than a
refrigerator.
Nevertheless, tests
proved a couple dozen
islanders with some heavy
duty ropes could guide the
stone to wobble, left and
right ... and ... gradually...
forward, down the dirt pathway to a final resting place.
That answered the
question after decades of
wonder and debate.
If you have an interest in learning more about
the life of ancient civilizations, I would encourage you
to read “The Statues That
Walked.”

I’m not sure when I

cannibalism was. I did sense
the subject was taboo and
civilized people did not practice it.

In more detail, the

about 80 adults and children.
They had an array of livestock such as oxen, horses
and cattle. The route they
chose was well used and

Before beginning
their trek in 1846, the Donner Party was given what
