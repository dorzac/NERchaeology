ABSTRACT
On March 24-26, and March 31 to April 11, 2008, Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc.,
conducted test excavations at the site of 41HR991, located on Cypress Creek, in northwest Harris
County, Texas. The objectives of the investigation were to determine the distribution and nature
of cultural deposits at the site in order to determine the site’s eligibility for inclusion within the
National Register of Historic Places. The site had been previously located during a survey in
2005 by Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc., personnel (Driver 2005) in preparation for
channel modifications of Cypress Creek by the Harris County Flood Control District (HCFCD).
The current investigations (MAC PN 07-94) were conducted for the Harris County Flood Control
(HCFCD Project ID K100-00-00-X028), under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 4790.
The excavations indicate that the majority of the 41HR991 contains an intact occupation deposit
buried 15-30 cm below the modern ground surface, and ranging from 10-30 cm in thickness. The
nature of the deposit, which forms a discrete layer with visible upper and lower interfaces in all
units in which it appears (except in BHT 3, where it is more diffuse), and the presence of the
three preserved hearth features (which consistently extend from the bottom of this deposit),
suggest that the site has suffered only minimal disturbances from biortubation, erosion, or modern
construction impacts. While higher artifact densities (by level) did correspond somewhat to the
occupation deposit in most units, the excavations also documented significant numbers of
artifacts in levels below the deposit. In most of these, the number of artifacts decreased as depth
increased, most likely indicating a slow downward migration of artifacts through the underlying
sandy sediment. Recovered artifacts continued to support the Early Ceramic/Late Prehistoric date
indicated during the survey, with chronologically diagnostic materials limited to two Perdiz
arrow points and a total of 71 pottery sherds.
In summary, the intact nature of the deposits, associated features, and the presence and
distribution of chronologically diagnostic materials is consistent with the criteria for establishing
significant research potential for the site. Consequently, it is recommended that the site be
considered eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Further, because
extensive construction disturbance is planned for the area as part of HCFCD stream modification
efforts, it is recommended that data recovery excavations be conducted prior to construction at
site 41HR991.

INTRODUCTION
occupation site located on the north bank of
Cypress Creek, just south of Stuebner
Airline Road (Figure 2). The site measures
at least 275 by 100 m, and covers 6.8 acres
(2.75 ha). The site appears to extend further
to the northwest, outside the HCFCD
property easement, although a significant
portion of this outside area has been heavily
disturbed sometime in the past by the
construction of a large pond.

On March 24-26, and March 31 to
April 11, 2008, Moore Archeological
Consulting, Inc., conducted test excavations
at the site of 41HR991, located on Cypress
Creek, in northwest Harris County, Texas.
The objectives of the investigation were to
determine the distribution and nature of
cultural deposits at the site in order to
determine the site’s eligibility for inclusion
within the National Register of Historic
Places. The site had been previously located
during a survey in 2005 by Moore
Archeological Consulting, Inc., personnel
(Driver 2005) in preparation for channel
modifications of Cypress Creek by the
Harris County Flood Control District
(HCFCD).
The current investigations
(MAC PN 07-94) were conducted for the
Harris County Flood Control (HCFCD
Project ID K100-00-00-X028), under Texas
Antiquities Permit Number 4790.

The current testing investigations
included both hand excavation and backhoe
trenching. The six backhoe trenches were
excavated first, in order to document the
stratigraphy present at the site, and to inform
the optimal placement of the hand
excavation units. There were six of these
units placed at the site, each consisting of a
1 x 1 m square excavation. The field
investigations were conducted by project
archeologist Randy Ferguson and field
technicians Nadine Johnson and Chris
Reber. David Driver served as the project’s
principal investigator.

The project area is depicted on the
Tomball, Texas 7.5' USGS topographic
quadrangle map (Figure 1). Site 41HR991
represents the remains of a large prehistoric

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
(Wheeler
1976:2,
66).
Summer
temperatures average 92°F (33°C), while
winter temperatures average 64°F (18°C).
Annual precipitation averages 46 inches
(117 cm).

Soils and Geology
Harris County is located within the
West Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic
province (Hunt 1974). In the Texas region,
the surface topography of the plain is
characterized by relatively flat topography
that dips slightly towards the Gulf of
Mexico. Geologically, the project area lies
atop the Lissie Formation, a surface outcrop
that extends from just east of the Mississippi
River in Louisiana, to Kingsville, Texas
(Bureau of Economic Geology 1982). The
formation was deposited during a series of
glacial and interglacial events during the
Middle to Late Pleistocene.
Extensive
riverine downcutting and erosion of the
formation occurred during the periods of
lower sea levels associated with the
Wisconsin glaciation.

Hydrology
The project area is located on the
north bank of Cypress Creek. A tributary of
Spring Creek and thus a component of the
San Jacinto River drainage basin, Cypress
Creek is a major stream in the area, and
shows evidence of having been extensively
occupied by prehistoric peoples. However,
based on a chronological comparison of
USGS maps, large portions of Cypress
Creek have been extensively channelized
since early in the 20th century.

Climate

Flora and Fauna
Harris County lies within the
Austroriparian biotic province (Blair
1950:98-101). Not determined by a marked
physiographic break, the western boundary
of this province is loosely identified by the
distribution of pine and hardwood forests on
the eastern Gulf coastal plain. San Jacinto
County is situated within the pine-oak
subdivision of the Austroriparian province
(Tharp 1939).
Blair (1950) lists the
dominant floral species of the pine-oak
forest subdivision as loblolly pine (Pinus
taeda), yellow pine (Pinus echinata), red oak
(Quercus rubra), post oak (Quercus
stellata), and blackjack oak (Quercus
marilandica). Hardwood forests are found
on lowlands within the Austroriparian and
are characterized by such trees as sweetgum
(Liquidambar
styraciflua),
magnolia
(Magnolia grandiflora), tupelo (Nyssa
sylvatica), water oak (Quercus nigra), and
other species of oaks, elms, and ashes, as
well as the highly diagnostic Spanish moss
(Tillandisia usneiodes) and palmetto (Sabal
glabra).

The modern climate of the Harris
County study area is moderated by winds
from the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in mild
winters and relatively cool summer nights

Blair (1950) and Gadus and Howard
(1990) identify the following mammals as
common within the Austroriparian province:

The project area is depicted on
sheets 31 and 32 of the Soil Survey of Harris
County (Wheeler et al. 1976). The soils in
the tract are identified as Voss soils (Vs),
Nahatche loam (Na), and Bissonnet very
fine sandy loam (Bn). Voss soils (Vs) are
nearly level to gently sloping soil located on
low terraces and floodplains of major
streams and their tributaries (Wheeler et al.
1976:23).
The soil is described as
moderately well drained to somewhat poorly
drained, with slow runoff. Bissonnet and
Nahatche soils are both described as
somewhat poorly drained with slow surface
runoff (Wheeler et al. 1976:13, 20). While
the Bissonnet soils are described by Abbott
(2001) as upland loamy ancient (preHolocene) alluvium with low potential for
containing deeply buried prehistoric sites,
the Voss and Nahatche soils are identified as
recent alluvium, and present a high potential
for containing deeply buried prehistoric
sites.

snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentinia), mud
turtle (Kinosteron spp.), river cooter
(Chrysemys concinna) and diamondback
terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin) comprise
common water turtles. Common lizards
include Anolis carolinensis, Sceloporus

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
Paleoindian stage. Based on the earliest
securely dated appearance of populations in
the New World, this stage begins around
11,000-10,000 B.C., and lasts for
approximately 4000 years. During this time,
it is proposed that populations continued
with a highly nomadic hunting tradition
brought with them from the Old World.
Traditional models emphasize the heavy
reliance that these groups placed on the
hunting of the large mammals of the
Pleistocene. Plant foods and small game
undoubtedly supplanted this diet, and may
have played a more important role than
previously thought (Black and McGraw
1985; Patterson 1995).
Artifact types
associated with this phase include various
fluted and non-fluted lanceolate projectile
points, such as Clovis and Folsom. In
general, due to a paucity of well-stratified
older sites, the Paleoindian stage remains
poorly defined in southeast Texas.

Southeast Texas Culture History
The project area is located within
the southeast Texas archaeological region
(Patterson 1995; Story et al. 1990). The
culture history of the region extends back at
least 12,000 years into the past. A number
of researchers have compiled chronological
frameworks to describe the cultural histories
of the area (Aten 1983; Ensor 1991;
Patterson 1995; Shafer et al. 1975; Story et
al. 1990). The majority of these divide
human occupation into four broad stages,
Paleoindian, Archaic/Lithic, Ceramic/Late
Prehistoric, and Historic. The stages are
based on a proposed sequence of economic
strategies as they are revealed through the
archaeological and/or historical record.
These proposed shifts in dominant lifeways
consider
cultural,
economic,
and
technological factors in order to provide a
heuristic model useful for attempting to
understand ancient and early historic
populations. While the dates assigned to the
period interfaces are based on "absolute"
dating methods, they of course represent a
generalized time range for the implied
cultural evolution. The dates provided in the
following discussion will be drawn from
Ensor (1991) and are presented in Table 1.

By 8000 B.C., the Late Wisconsin
glaciation had ended, increasing climatic
aridity and creating extensive changes in the
environment. As a result, the majority of
Pleistocene megafauna became extinct. This
required drastic changes in the dominant
subsistence strategies of the affected
populations. By 8000 B.C., the start of the
Early Archaic stage, the remaining southeast

southeast Texas is identified as the

repetitive exploitation of specific floral and
faunal resources. By remaining in familiar
territory, the nomadic populations were able
to better exploit the various resources
available within their local environment.

Texas populations had adapted to the
environmental changes by shifting to a
lifeway dominated by seasonal scheduling.
This type of subsistence economy
specializes in a regionally circumscribed and

migration during this time (Aten 1983). The
period has also been associated with the
introduction of the bow and arrow around
A.D. 600 (Aten 1983).

However, research has suggested
that human population densities remained
low in the area, and may have even
decreased significantly during this time
(Moore and Moore 1991). Eventually, the
stabilization of the climate by around 1000
B.C., the start of the Late Archaic, appears
to have led to increasing populations. This
rise in regional population may have been
further facilitated by the development of
long-distance
trade,
technological
innovations, and changing social relations
(Patterson 1995).

Historic Overview
European contact in the region
began in the early 16th century with the illfated Narváez expedition that, in 1528,
deposited Cabeza de Vaca onto the Texas
coastline, possibly on Galveston Island.
More long-term contacts resulting from
permanent European settlement did not
directly impact aboriginal lifeways in
southeast Texas until the early 18th century
(Patterson 1995).
However, European
diseases introduced by explorers and early
traders had begun to affect Native American
populations in Texas by the 16th century
(Ewers 1974). Throughout the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries, epidemic diseases,
the mission system, and the fur trade
seriously reduced, and in some cases
exterminated, the indigenous populations
residing in the region.

The final prehistoric period in
southeast Texas is marked by the emergence
of ceramics. Ceramic artifacts appear in the
archaeological record of the Galveston Bay
area by approximately A.D. 100, and by
A.D 500, had been adopted by a number of
inland populations (Pertulla et al. 1995). A
plain, sand-tempered type of ceramic
identified as Goose Creek became prevalent
during the period, although a number of
decorated varieties and tempering materials
were also present (Patterson 1995; Pertulla
et al. 1995). The appearance of Caddoan
pottery in southeast Texas around A.D.
1000-1300 has been used to suggest the
presence of extended trade networks or

economic prosperity, and helped lure a

the second decade of the 20th century, the
growing gas and oil industry was competing
with agricultural interests, and helped create
a significant boom in population.

modern boundaries of the county were
established as Harrisburg County by the
Texas Congress in 1836, and it was renamed
Harris County in 1839. The presence of the
highly navigable Buffalo Bayou stimulated
economic development of the county, and of

was limited to a scatter of small flakes.

Prior
to
beginning
field
investigations,
Moore
Archeological
Consulting, Inc., performed a background
investigation of archeological and historical
literature relevant to the project area.
Literature examined for this project includes
site inventory records on file at TARL,
previous archeological investigative reports
on file at the Texas Historical Commission
(THC)
and
Moore
Archeological
Consulting, Inc. and other published
literature pertinent to the current project.

From a more regional perspective,
the current project is located within the
Cypress Creek watershed, where a large
number of investigations have been
conducted over the last three decades
(Dureka 1998; Porter 2003). In 1977, The
Texas Archeological Survey, The University
of Texas at Austin, conducted a
reconnaissance survey of selected portions
of the Cypress Creek watershed in Harris
and Waller Counties (Freeman and Hale
1978). This survey was done at the behest
of the Corps of Engineers, Galveston
District, who was seeking to assess the
significance of archeological and historical
resources within the watershed prior to
developing a predictive drainage basin
model. This model would be used to aid in
planning future flood control modifications
in the Cypress Creek watershed. Since the
sizable basin (320 square miles) could not
be entirely surveyed, the investigations were
concentrated on the 100-year flood plain as
this would be the most likely portion to
experience modifications. Approximately
20 percent of the floodplain was surveyed.
Some reconnaissance was also conducted in
selected upland areas contiguous to the
floodplain. The investigations resulted in
the recording or reevaluation of 58
prehistoric sites and the recording of 25
historic sites (information on many other
historic sites was gathered but formal

The archival background search
determined that two previously recorded
archeological sites, 41HR340 and 41HR341,
are located within the project area. Both
sites were recorded in 1977 as part of a
survey along Cypress Creek (TARL files),
and are located near the southwestern end of
the current project area. As depicted on the
1982 USGS quad map (Satsuma, field
checked 1976), 41HR340 was plotted on the
creek’s southern bank, inside a sharp bend
or meander.
Based on the site file
description, it appears that at the time of the
survey, this portion of the creek had already
been rectified, cutting off this bend from the
active stream channel.
The site was
described as a Middle to Late Prehistoric
campsite, and artifacts recovered from the
survey included stone tools and debitage,
burned clay balls, and faunal material. A
significant amount of modern construction
disturbance was noted, and it was suggested
that portions of the site had been destroyed.
Site 41HR341 had also suffered from
significant construction disturbance at the
time of its identification (TARL files). The

indicates that there is a relatively high
density of prehistoric and historic sites
within the Cypress Creek floodplain and its
adjoining uplands. En masse, the prehistoric
sites are described as small in size and
believed to reflect general camping
activities.
More specific site function
interpretations were not attempted due to the
limited scope of the reconnaissance. The
study area produced artifacts ranging from
the late Paleoindian period to the Late
Prehistoric period. Historic sites included
cemeteries, houses, churches, sawmills,
roads, road crossings, bridges, schools,
railroads, stage stops, and resorts. In the
main, these sites date to the mid-to-late
nineteenth century and early twentieth
century.

In 1990, Texas A&M returned to
Cypress Creek to conduct National Register
eligibility testing at prehistoric sites
41HR374 and 41HR375 (Ensor et al. 1991).
Test units and backhoe trenches were
excavated at both sites, and it was
determined that neither site was eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP.
Also in 1990, personnel from Texas
A&M conducted an intensive survey of a
43-acre tract in northwestern Harris County
(Ensor and Moore 1990). The tract centered
on Faulkey Gully, approximately 1.8
kilometers above the confluence of the
Gully and Cypress Creek. The investigation
was done in advance of channel dredging
within Faulkey Gully. No cultural resources
were located.

In 1985, Moore Archeological
Consulting, Inc., performed a small survey
in advance of the construction of a road
extension across Cypress Creek (Moore
1985).
No archeological sites were
recorded, and site 41HR525, a prehistoric
site recorded by avocational archeologists
from the Houston Archeological Society and
lying near the proposed construction
corridor, was determined to be destroyed by
clearing and erosion.

In 1992, Moore Archeological
Consulting, Inc., conducted a cultural
resources survey of a 90-acre tract, the
proposed location of Telge Park in Harris
County on Cypress Creek (Moore et al.
1994).
This investigation recorded six
prehistoric sites (41HR717 to 41HR723), all
of which were determined to be eligible for
SAL designation. Site 41HR720 was the
only site that produced chronologically
diagnostic artifact, an Alba point that may
date the site to the Late Prehistoric period.
An attempt was made to relocate previously
recorded site 41HR394, the Cypress Creek
crossing of the Old Washington Road. This
crossing point was no longer visible.
However, a short segment of raised roadbed
located in another portion of the project may
be a surviving remnant of the road (Moore
1992).

In 1989, the Archeological Research
Laboratory of Texas A&M conducted an
intensive survey of a rectangular 645-acre
tract, centered on a 13.5 mile segment of
Cypress Creek, in northern Harris County
(Ensor 1991a). This investigation was done
in advance of proposed flood control
maintenance activities along a segment of
Cypress Creek. Four previously unknown
sites (41HR628 to 41HR631) were recorded
during the survey. Three of these sites were
prehistoric, yielding lithic debris, ceramics,
bone, and charcoal. All were deemed
potentially eligible for the NRHP; the
fourth, a scatter of modern structure
remains, was determined ineligible. Twelve
known sites, all prehistoric, were reassessed.
Of those, sites 41HR374 and 41HR375 were
determined to have possible subsurface

In 1993, Moore Archeological
Consulting, Inc., conducted an intensive
survey of 143 acres on Little Cypress Creek
approximately 1.5 kilometers northwest of
its confluence with Cypress Creek (Moore et
al. 1994).
This tract is located
approximately 4.5 kilometers west of the

current project area. The survey was done
in advance of the construction of a
floodwater detention facility along Little
Cypress Creek. A single historic cemetery,
the Roeder/Becker Cemetery, was recorded
as 41HR750. An isolated find of a single
flake was noted.

commencement of channel improvements
and drainage basin construction. Prehistoric
sites 41HR789 and 41HR790, described as
extremely low-density, shallow lithic artifact
scatters, were recorded. Neither site was
deemed eligible for SAL or NRHP
designation.

In 1994, Moore Archeological
Consulting, Inc., again performed a survey
in the Cypress Creek watershed (Moore and
Daigle 1996). This 50-acre investigation
took place on the banks of an unnamed
tributary of Cypress Creek at the western
edge of Harris County. The survey was
done in advance of a creek bank mitigation
project. No cultural resources were located.

A survey was conducted by
personnel from Moore Archeological
Consulting, Inc., in 1996 on a 43-acre parcel
approximately 1.2 kilometers upstream
(west) of the juncture of Cypress Creek and
Faulkey Gully (Moore et al.1996). The tract
was the location of a proposed floodwater
detention basin. The investigation recorded
thirteen previously unknown archeological
sites, twelve prehistoric sites and one
prehistoric site with a surface historic
component (41HR774 to 41HR786). Sites
ranged from sparse lithic scatters on large
sandy rises to sizable, full-function
campsites on broad levee ridges. Lithic and
ceramic samples from the sites indicate
occupation(s) during the Late Prehistoric
and possibly a second occupation or series
of occupations dating to as early as the
Middle Archaic. The historic component at
41HR783 appears to be structural remains
(mostly brick fragments) of unknown origin;
however, Moore states that the remains
resemble portable sawmill remnants found
elsewhere in Harris County. Nine of the sites
were recommended for further investigation
if they were to be impacted by detention
basin construction.

In 1996, Moore Archeological
Consulting, Inc., conducted an intensive
survey on a 488-acre tract along the north
bank of Cypress Creek in northern Harris
County (Moore 1997).
Cypress Creek
defines the southern border of the tract, and
the eastern edge of the tract sits at the
confluence of Cypress and Spring Creeks.
This investigation was done in advance of
the construction of a golf course. Thirteen
previously unknown sites (41HR584 to
41HR596) were recorded, and previously
recorded site 41HR371 was revisited. The
newly recorded sites were characterized as
sparse subsurface lithic scatters, small in
size and producing no diagnostic artifacts.
A reassessment of 41HR371, a larger site
dating to the Early Ceramic Period, found it
to be in good condition and worthy of
protection.
All sites identified and
reassessed during the survey were deemed
eligible for nomination as SALs and
recommended
for
avoidance
during
construction.

In early 2003, an additional survey
was conducted by personnel from Moore
Archeological
Consulting,
Inc.,
approximately 1.5 kilometers upstream
(west) of the 129-acre tract discussed below
(Porter and Moore 2003). The project
consisted of a reconnaissance survey of a
47-acre tract scheduled for purchase by
HCFCD to serve as a floodplain
preservation area. Three prehistoric sites
(41HR945 to 41HR947), situated on sandy
rises or ridges were located and recorded as
subsurface lithic scatters.
One site,
41HR947, was determined not eligible for

Also in 1996, personnel from GeoMarine, Inc., conducted survey, backhoe
trenching,
and
geoarcheological
investigations in two areas of the Cypress
Creek floodplain in northern Harris County
(Ensor et al. 1996). These investigations
were carried out at the request of the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers prior to the

9

Champion Forest Drive, in northwest Harris
County, Texas. A total of 189 shovel tests,
five backhoe trenches, and one soil profile
were excavated. One previously identified
prehistoric site, 41HR340, was located
within the project area, but was determined
to have been extensively disturbed by
erosion
and
previous
channel
reconfiguration.
A second previously
identified prehistoric site that had initially
appeared to be in the project area, 41HR341,
was determined to be located outside the
project boundary. Two new prehistoric sites
were discovered during the survey,
41HR991 and 41HR992. Site 41HR991 was
determined to be a large, relatively intact
prehistoric occupation site. Though no
construction was planned for the portion of
the project area that included this site, it was
recommended that testing should be
conducted in the event that future
construction impacts were planned. The
second new site, 41HR992, was located on
the south side of the creek, with only a very
limited portion of the site actually extended
into the project’s planned APE. This site
was also recommended for future testing
should planned construction impact it.
Consequently, temporary protective fencing
was erected and monitored to ensure that the
site was not impacted during the
construction work.

inclusion on the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) or for State
Archeological Landmark (SAL) status. The
two remaining sites were recommended for
further
investigations
if
subsurface
disturbance would be necessary in the
future.
In February and March of 2003,
personnel from Moore Archeological
Consulting, Inc., conducted an archeological
survey of a 129-acre floodplain preservation
area in northwestern Harris County along
Cypress Creek near its juncture with
Faulkey Gully (Porter 2003). A total of 406
shovel tests were dug in an attempt to locate
sites and define site boundaries. Twenty new
sites were found but three previously
recorded sites could not be relocated. Site
density was calculated at one site for every
6.5 acres surveyed or 0.16 sites per acre.
One site was deemed ineligible as a State
Archeological Landmark (SAL) while the
eligibility of the other sites could not be
determined due to the reconnaissance nature
of the survey.
In 2005, Moore Archeological
Consulting, Inc., conducted an archeological
survey of an approximately 1.9 mile (3500
m) long segment of Cypress Creek, located
west of Stuebner Airline Road and east of

FIELD METHODS AND RESULTS
The highest concentrations of artifacts occur
in the northeast half of the site (STs 149,
150-152, 158-160, 163). These high density
areas are correlated with the areas of highest
elevations, suggesting that other portions of
the site may have suffered from varying
levels of deflation and/or erosion. No
evidence of features was identified in any of
the shovel tests. Nor were any features
evident in the two backhoe trenches (BHTs
3 and 4) conducted near the site during the
survey.

The fieldwork was conducted on
March 24-26, and March 31 to April 11,
2008, and consisted of three days of backhoe
investigations and 10 days of hand
excavation. A total of six backhoe trenches
(BHT 1-6) and six hand units (XU 1-6) were
excavated (Figure 2). The project area is
heavily wooded with dense and tangled
understory.
41HR991 Survey Results
The site was first identified in 2005
by Moore Archeological Consulting
personnel during a pedestrian survey for the
Cypress Creek at Meyer Park Restoration
Project (Driver 2005). The site represents a
large prehistoric occupation located on the
north bank of Cypress Creek. The site is
bounded on its northeast by Stuebner Airline
Road, and has most likely been disturbed by
the construction of the road, as well as the
construction of a large artificial pond on the
site’s northwest side. The site measures at
least 275 by 100 m, though it appeared to
extend further to the northwest, outside
HCFCD property easement.

In summary, initial pedestrian
survey investigations at 41HR991 indicated
that the site is a large prehistoric site located
on the north bank of Cypress Creek. The
site parallels the creek for at least 275 m, but
due to limited property access, it remained
unclear how far the site extends away from
the creek. Recovered artifacts suggest the
site contains a moderate density of artifacts,
but has a limited range of artifact diversity.
Variation in densities of the recovered
artifacts suggests that due to erosion,
deflation, and some modern disturbances,
portions of the site may be more intact than
others. The site dates to the Early Ceramic
period, but may contain earlier deposits as
well. At the time of the original survey, no
construction was planned for the portion of
the project area in which 41HR991 is
located. It was recommended that should
future impacts be planned, testing
investigations should occur at 41HR991 in
order to determine its eligibility for
nomination to the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP). The newly planned
HCFCD channel modifications of this
portion of the stream have mandated the
current testing efforts.

During the initial survey, a total of
34 shovel tests (STs 47-51, 133-138, 141163) were excavated in the area in an
attempt to delineate and assess the site. Of
these, 22 tests were positive for culture
materials, producing a total of 96 prehistoric
artifacts. These included one basal fragment
of a projectile point (not identifiable as to
type), 74 pieces of debitage (59 chert, 13
silicified wood, 2 quartzite), and 21 Goose
Creek plain sherds of various sizes.
Based on the distribution of artifacts
recovered from the shovel tests, the culturebearing deposits extend from the surface to
140 cm in depth, with the majority of
artifacts (60%) concentrated between 50-90
cm below the ground surface. In terms of
horizontal distribution, the long axis of the
site appears to parallel the creek (though the
shape and extent of the site in areas beyond
the HCFCD boundaries remains unknown).

Backhoe Trenches
As part of the testing investigations,
a total of six backhoe trenches (BHTs 1-6)
were excavated in order to document the
sites depositional history and prospect for
cultural features. While the thick vegetation
covering the site made maneuvering the

11

heavy equipment difficult, the trenches were
spaced at intervals of 50 m as much as
possible along the approximately 300 m
length of the site (Figure 2). The trenches
ranged from 10.3 to 11.0 m in length and all
measured 1.2 m in width. Depths ranged
from 1.3 to 3.1 m. One wall of each trench
was cleaned and examined, and the profile
was then drawn and photographed. A GPS
reading was taken for one corner of the
excavation and the orientation of the trench
was taken with a hand compass. None of
the backhoe excavated matrix was screened.
However, BHTs 4-6 produced a total of 30
prehistoric artifacts that were hand-collected
during excavation or cleaning. In addition, a
probable hearth feature was identified in
BHT 4.

BHT 3
This trench was placed just south of
the approximate center of the site (Figures 2,
5), in an area that had not received much
shovel testing during the initial delineation
efforts of 2005. The trench measured 10.8
m by 1.2 m, and reached a maximum depth
of 1.6 m. It was oriented at 10 degrees
magnetic north. The trench’s west profile
was cleaned and recorded. This trench also
documented a large degree of modern
disturbances including truncation and fill
areas, as well as a significant area of vertical
disturbance from what appeared to have
been a large tree’s root system. As at BHT
2, the area was covered by what appeared to
be a mantle of recent sandy loam flood
deposits, measuring up to 40 cm in
thickness. The lowest exposed stratum,
Zone III, appeared to be pre-Holocene
subsoil. No cultural materials or features
were present.

BHT 1
This trench was placed near the
south end of the site, close to the HCFCD
easement boundary (Figures 2, 3). The
trench measured 10.3 m in length by 1.2 m
in width, and had a maximum depth of 1.3
m. The trench was oriented at 330 degrees
magnetic north. Inspection of the trench’s
northeast wall profile revealed the presence
of three distinct sediment zones.
The
uppermost stratum, Zone I, showed evidence
of modern disturbance and truncation. The
lowest layer, Zone II, appeared to be preHolocene subsoil. No cultural materials or
features were identified in this trench.

BHT 4
This trench was placed atop the high
ground near the center of the site (Figures 2,
6, 7). This is an area in which the initial
shovel testing documented some of the
highest artifact densities present at the site.
The trench measured 10.9 m by 1.2 m, and
reached a maximum depth of 3.1 m. It was
oriented at 320 degrees magnetic north. A
thin, 30 cm, layer of recent sandy loam flood
deposit was present atop a portion of the
trench’s southwest wall profile.
Some
modern disturbance is suggested by the
partial truncation of the upper boundary of
Zone I. The uppermost portion (20-30 cm)
of Zone II contained charcoal flecks, a large
pottery sherd, and a possible hearth feature
(Feature 1). Though no lower boundary
could be discerned, this uppermost portion
of Zone II appears to represent a layer of
cultural deposition similar to the more
distinct stratum visible in BHTs 5 and 6, and
XUs 1, 2, and 4-6.

BHT 2
Located slightly downslope, and
approximately 50 m east of BHT 1, this
trench was placed close to the site’s
southeastern boundary (Figures 2, 4). The
trench measured 11 m by 1.2 m, and reached
a maximum depth of 1.4 m. It was oriented
at 300 degrees magnetic north. The trench’s
southwest profile documented modern
disturbances including truncation and fill
areas, as well as a 40-50 cm thick mantle of
what appeared to be recent flood deposits of
sand and sandy loam. The lowest exposed
stratum, Zone III, appeared to be preHolocene subsoil. No cultural materials or
features were present.

The possible hearth is roughly
basin-shaped, and measures approximately
58 cm in width and has a maximum

thickness of 20 cm (Figure 7). The feature
fill consisted of a high density of charcoal
flecks and ash, but no artifacts were directly
associated with the feature. A large pottery
sherd was recovered from the south end of
the trench wall at a distance of 2.7 m from
the feature, but at approximately the same
depth as the top of the hearth. This 6 mm
thick sherd had a well-preserved section of
rim, which provided a rim diameter of 30
cm, and indicated the vessel had been a
large, flared-wall bowl (Figure 29).
Interestingly, a biconically drilled repair
hole, 3 mm in diameter, was located 1.8 cm
from the rim edge. Feature 1 was further
investigated by hand excavation unit XU 3
(see below), which was placed adjacent to
BHT 4 and centered on the feature.

BHT 6
Located at the northern end of the
site (Figures 2, 10), and approximately 35 m
northeast of BHT 5, this trench was also
placed in the same area of high artifact
density. The trench measured 10.6 m by 1.2
m, and reached a maximum depth of 1.3 m.
It was oriented at 250 degrees magnetic
north. The trench’s north profile suggested
some modern disturbance, with the
uppermost humic layer partially truncated
near the trench’s eastern end. Zone II
appeared to be similar to that identified in
BHT 5. The presence of numerous charcoal
flecks, single flake (lost in the field), and 11
fragments of unidentified weathered, bivalve
shell (possibly Rangia) suggest it also
represents an occupation deposit. This dark
layer was only present in the east end of the
trench.

BHT 5
This trench was located atop high
ground in the northern portion of the site
(Figures 2, 8, 9), and like BHT 4, was in an
area that had produced high densities of
artifacts during the site delineation efforts.
The trench measured 10.6 m by 1.2 m, and
reached a maximum depth of 3.0 m. The
trench was oriented at 30 degrees magnetic
north. An examination of the east profile
revealed that the deposits appeared to be
intact with no modern disturbances.
However, some bioturbation was evident in
each of the stratigraphic zones. Zone II was
clearly darker and contained a high density
of charcoal flecks and a number of lithic and
ceramic artifacts, and appears to represent a
discrete and intact cultural occupation
deposit. The stratum varies from 30-50 cm
in thickness and its upper boundary has an
average depth of 30 cm below ground
surface.

modern ground surface (Zone I) with a thin,
but intact, humic layer. Zone I varied from
5-10 cm in thickness, and was almost
completely limited to Level 4 (30-40 cmbs).
The level contained both prehistoric and
modern materials suggesting the layer to be
somewhat disturbed and mixed by
bioturbation. Below this layer was Zone II,
an approximately 20 cm thick (ca. 37-58
cmbs) layer of darker sediment that
contained a high density of carbon flecks,
and is similar in appearance to the assumed
occupation deposit identified in BHTs 4-6.
Surprisingly, the excavation of the darker
deposit (Levels 5, 6) produced only a single
piece of debitage. Underlying this stratum
was Zone III, a thick layer of loamy sand
that extended below the limits of the
excavation.

Hand Excavation Units
A total of six 1 x 1 m hand
excavation units were excavated (XUs 1-6,
Figure 2). Each unit was excavated using 10
cm thick arbitrary levels utilizing a
combination of shovel-skimming and hand
trowelling.
All excavated matrix was
screened through ¼” mesh screens, and all
artifacts were bagged by level. Fills from
identified
features
were
excavated
separately. Each unit was excavated to
subsoil, or in cases where subsoil was not
reached, to a maximum safe depth, which
varied depending on the stability of the
sediments. Unit forms were filled out for
each level, and recorded sediments, features,
and artifacts. Photographs were taken of the
base of each level, and a profile drawing
was made of one wall of each completed
unit. All of the units produced cultural
materials, resulting in a total of 415
collected artifacts. These included two
Perdiz projectile points, one drill fragment,
one tested cobble, 336 pieces of debitage
(269 chert, 62 silicified wood, 5 quartzite),
57 Goose Creek plain pottery sherds, four
pieces of burned clay, 10 pieces of
unidentified mammal bone, and one shell
fragment. In addition, three features, all
small basin-shaped hearths, were identified
in the hand excavation units. Three historic
artifacts were recovered: an unidentified
lead pellet, and two lead bullets.

A total of 51 artifacts were
recovered from the 15 levels of XU 1
(Tables 3, 4). These consisted of 10 pottery
sherds, one unidentified bone fragment, one
tested cobble of silicified wood, 26 pieces of
debitage (27 chert, 10 silicified wood, 1
quartzite), and one unidentified lead pellet.
In terms of their vertical distribution, the
vast majority of artifacts (88%) were
recovered from below the presumed
occupation deposit in Levels 5 and 6. The
densities below these levels suggests that
artifacts may be migrating downward out of
Zone II, with 10 artifacts in Level 7, eight in
Level 8, seven in Level 9, etc.

XU 1
The first hand excavation unit was
located approximately 20 m south of BHT 6,
on the highest topographic area of the site
(Figures 2, 11, 12). The unit was placed
close to ST 160, which, during the initial site
delineation efforts, had produced the second
highest density of artifacts (n=17).

XU 2
This hand excavation unit was also
located in highest topographic area of the
site (Figures 2, 13, 14), and in an area
previously shown to contain relatively high
artifact densities (ST 150, n=12 artifacts).
The unit was placed close to BHT 5, which
had exposed what appeared to be a discrete
occupation deposit containing much carbon
and a number of associated artifacts.

A total of 15 levels were excavated,
reaching a maximum depth of 150 cm. The
uppermost three levels (ca. 30 cm) consisted
of a thick sandy layer, most likely a recent
flood deposit. No artifacts were recovered
from these upper three levels. Beneath the
flood layer appeared to be the original

A total of 12 levels were excavated,
reaching a maximum depth of 120 cm. The
uppermost stratum, Zone I, appeared to be

21

Only two sediment strata were clearly
identified in this unit: Zone I, an upper soil
zone with intact humus layer, and Zone II, a
lower loamy sand layer that extended
beneath the limits of excavation in both the
hand unit and backhoe trench (3.1 m).
However, the presence of an indistinct layer
of carbon flecks, Feature 1, and a number of
artifacts did suggest the presence of human
occupation similar to that revealed in other
excavations units and trenches.
This
potential occupation deposit had much more
diffuse boundaries than in other areas, and
was significantly thicker, extending from
approximately 25-60 cmbs.

intact and mostly undisturbed by modern
impacts. Evidence for historic impacts was
limited to two lead minié ball bullets
recovered from Level 2 (10-20 cmbs). The
two bullets are almost identical; each is
conical with a flat nose and concave base,
and with two exterior grooves (Figure 30).
Both bullets are .45 caliber.
The
development of the minié ball for use in
muzzle-loading rifles dates to the mid-late
19th century. Neither bullet shows evidence
of being fired (barrel marks or any
misshaping from impact).
The dark occupation deposit, Zone
II, was also identified in this unit, located
between 25-50 cmbs, and excavated by
Levels 3-5. Below was Zone III, a loamy
sand that continued below the lowest
excavated level.

The excavation exposed the
southern half of Feature 1, revealing it to be
roughly circular in shape, and basin-shaped
in section (Figures 17, 18). The feature
measured 58 cm in diameter, and had a
maximum thickness of 20 cm. The feature
began at a depth of 27 cmbs. The lower
boundary of the feature was very diffuse,
with no sharply visible interfaces between
the feature and the surrounding matrix. The
fill from the feature was excavated and
screened separately from the rest of the unit.
However, no artifacts were recovered from
within the feature fill. A soil sample and
several small carbon samples were taken
from near the base of the feature. The soil
sample was fine-screened, but no seeds or
other visible macro-plant remains were
observed.

The levels in closest association
with Zone II contained the highest densities
of cultural materials, with 77 prehistoric
artifacts (66%) recovered from Levels 2-5
(10-50 cmbs). Below Level 5, artifact
densities trail off, again suggesting some
downward migration of artifacts.
A total of 117 artifacts were
recovered from the 12 levels of XU 2
(Tables 5, 6). These consisted of 20 pottery
sherds, four pieces of burned clay, eight
bone
fragments
(unidentified
large
mammal), one chert Perdiz projectile point
with denticulated lateral edges (Figure 31),
and 82 pieces of debitage (62 chert, 19
silicified wood, 1 quartzite). As noted
above, two lead bullets, possibly dating to
the 19th century, were also recovered.

A total of 34 artifacts were
recovered from the 14 levels of XU 3
(Tables 7, 8). The artifacts were limited to
debitage only (19 chert, 13 silicified wood, 2
quartzite).
In terms of their vertical
distribution,
the
artifacts
displayed
somewhat of a bimodal distribution, with 16
(47%) recovered from between 0-70 cmbs
and 18 (53%) recovered from 90-140 cmbs.
While this could represent separate periods
of prehistoric occupation, the lack of
chronologically diagnostic materials makes
this argument difficult. More likely, the
diffuse nature of the occupation deposit, the
indistinct lower feature boundary, and the

XU 3
This hand excavation unit was
located adjacent to the southwest wall of
BHT 4 (Figures 2, 15-18). The unit was
placed there in order to fully define the
possible hearth (Feature 1) exposed in the
trench wall.
A total of 14 levels were excavated,
reaching a maximum depth of 140 cm.

22

anomalous artifact distribution may point to
the presence of localized subsurface
disturbances in this area of the site.

XU 5
This hand excavation unit was
located approximately 20 m south of BHT 5
and XU 3 (Figures 2, 21-24). The unit was
placed close to ST 158, which, during the
initial site delineation efforts, had produced
the highest density of artifacts (n=22).

XU 4
This unit was placed near the
southwestern project area boundary in order
to investigate the distribution of cultural
deposits in this area of the site (Figures 2,
19, 20). Initial shovel testing during the
delineation efforts had recovered few
artifacts in this portion of the site, and thus
suggested that intact subsurface deposits
would be limited. The unit was located
approximately 30 m north of BHT 1, which
had failed to produce artifacts or evidence of
the dark occupation deposit evident in other
trenches.

A total of 14 levels were excavated,
reaching a maximum depth of 140 cm. The
uppermost two levels (ca. 20 cm) consisted
of a mixed clay loam and sandy loam fill
layer.
Beneath the fill layer, Zone I
appeared to be the original modern ground
surface. Though relatively intact, the lack of
a clear humic layer suggests it was
somewhat truncated prior to the deposition
of the fill layer. Zone I varied from 10-20
cm in thickness, and was primarily
excavated as Levels 3 and 4 (20-40 cmbs).
Below this layer was the occupation deposit,
Zone II, which in this area is a 10-15 cm
thick layer of darker sediment with a high
density of carbon flecks and a high density
of prehistoric artifacts. The zone was
included in the lower portion of Level 4, and
all of Level 5. A large basin-shaped hearth,
Feature 2, extended from the bottom of this
zone.
The hearth and Zone II were
underlain by two layers of loamy sand, Zone
III, which was 30-55 cm in thickness, and
Zone IV, which was at least 50 cm thick and
extended below the limits of the excavation.

A total of seven levels were
excavated, reaching a maximum depth of 70
cm. The uppermost 20-25 cm consisted of
a mixed sandy loam and clay layer. The
presence of modern refuse and debris within
this layer indicates it is a modern flood
deposit.
No prehistoric artifacts were
recovered from this layer. Beneath this
stratum, the dark occupation deposit
identified in other areas was present in the
western half of the unit, where its maximum
thickness was limited to 10-11 cm. The
limited horizontal distribution and thinness
of the deposit suggests that this unit is in an
area of limited activity, or perhaps located
near the edge of the site. Beneath this layer
was a 30-40 cm loamy sand stratum that
directly overlay what appeared to be the
mottled sandy clay subsoil.

The excavation exposed the
southeast ‘quadrant’ of Feature 2 (Figures
23, 24). The feature appears to be subrectangular in plan, and basin-shaped in
section. Based on the plan and profile,
Feature 2 measured at least 70 cm east-west,
and 30 cm deep. The feature began at a
depth of 48 cmbs, but its uppermost surface
was most clearly defined at the base of
Level 6 (Figure 15). The fill from the
feature was excavated and screened
separately from the rest of the unit.
However, only one artifact, a fragment of
the bit from a flaked stone drill, was
recovered from within the feature fill in
Level 8 (70-80 cmbs).

A total of 34 artifacts were
recovered from the seven levels of XU 4
(Tables 9, 10). These consisted of 1 pottery
sherd, and 33 pieces of debitage (28 chert, 5
silicified wood). The vertical distribution of
artifacts was similar to other units, with a
moderate density associated with the
occupation deposit (15%), the highest
density immediately below it (30%), and
with artifact numbers trailing off steadily as
depth increased (26%, 18%, 12%, 0%).

23

hearth were underlain by a layer of loamy
sand, Zone II, which was at least 95 cm
thick and extended below the limits of the
excavation.

A total of 64 artifacts were
recovered from the 14 levels of XU 5
(Tables 11, 12). These included of 13
pottery sherds, one unidentified shell
fragment, one medial fragment of a drill
made of heat-treated/damaged silicified
wood (from Feature 2), and 49 pieces of
debitage (41 chert, 8 silicified wood). The
vertical distribution of artifacts was similar
to that at nearby XU 3, reflecting somewhat
of a bimodal distribution with the highest
densities in Levels 3-5 (33%) and 8-11
(44%).

The excavation exposed the
northeast ‘quadrant’ of Feature 3 (Figures
27, 28. The feature appears to be roughly
circular in plan, and basin-shaped in section.
Based on the plan and profile, Feature 3
measured approximately 60 cm in diameter,
and 20 cm in depth. The feature began at a
depth of 42 cmbs, and was clearly defined at
the base of Level 5. The fill from the
feature was excavated and screened
separately from the rest of the unit. Five
artifacts were recovered from within the
feature fill, including pottery, debitage, and
a Perdiz arrow point.

XU 6
The final test unit was located
approximately 15 m southwest of XU 1
(Figures 2, 24-28). The unit was placed at
the east end of the rise that forms the highest
topographic area of the site. A nearby
shovel test, ST 151, had produced five
artifacts during the initial site delineation
efforts.

A total of 115 artifacts were
recovered from the 14 levels of XU 6
(Tables 13, 14). These included of 13
pottery sherds, one unidentifiable bone
fragment, one chert Perdiz projectile point,
and 100 pieces of debitage (92 chert, 7
silicified wood, 1 quartzite). Five of these
artifacts were recovered from the feature’s
fill, including the point and one pottery
sherd from Level 5 (40-50 cmbs) and one
sherd and two pieces of debitage from Level
7 (60-70 cmbs). In terms of their vertical
distribution, artifact densities were higher in
the occupation deposit and upper levels,
with 82 percent recovered from Levels 2-9
(10-90 cmbs).

A total of 14 levels were excavated,
reaching a maximum depth of 140 cm. The
uppermost two levels (ca. 20 cm) consisted
of a layer of disturbed sandy loam sediment.
The lowest portion of this stratum contained
a large number (n=18) of prehistoric
artifacts.
Beneath the disturbed layer
appeared Zone I, the dark occupation
deposit. Excavated by Levels 3, 4, and the
upper portion of 5 (ca. 20-45 cmbs), this
zone contained a total of 22 artifacts. A
basin-shaped hearth, Feature 3, extended
from the bottom of this zone. Zone I and the

portion of the stream have mandated the
current testing efforts.

On March 24-26, and March 31 to
April 11, 2008, Moore Archeological
Consulting, Inc., conducted test excavations
at the site of 41HR991, located on Cypress
Creek, in northwest Harris County, Texas.
The objectives of the investigation were to
determine the distribution and nature of
cultural deposits at the site in order to
determine the site’s eligibility for inclusion
within the National Register of Historic
Places. The testing investigations (MAC PN
07-94) were conducted for the Harris
County Flood Control (HCFCD Project ID
K100-00-00-X028), under Texas Antiquities
Permit Number 4790.

The testing excavations consisted of
six backhoe trenches and six 1 x 1 m hand
excavation units.
These excavations
recovered three historic artifacts and 443
prehistoric artifacts. The investigation also
revealed a 10-30 cm thick buried stratum
that appears to represent a prehistoric
occupation, which is present in almost all of
the site areas. In addition, the excavations
documented the presence of a distinct
occupation deposit that extends across
almost the entire site. Three basin-shaped
hearth features were documented in
association with this occupation layer.

Site 41HR991 was first identified in
2005 by Moore Archeological Consulting
personnel during a pedestrian survey for the
Cypress Creek at Meyer Park Restoration
Project (Driver 2005). During the survey, a
total of 34 shovel tests and two backhoe
trenches were excavated in order to
delineate and assess the site.
The
investigations identified the site as a large
prehistoric occupation that extended for
approximately 275 m along the north bank
of Cypress Creek, just south of Stuebner
Airline Road. Recovered cultural materials
indicated the site contains a moderate
density of artifacts, but has a limited range
of artifact diversity. The presence of pottery
in three of the tests indicates the site dates to
the Early Ceramic period, though may have
been occupied earlier as well.

The excavations indicate that the
majority of the 41HR991 contains an intact
occupation deposit buried 15-30 cm below
the modern ground surface, and ranging
from 10-30 cm in thickness. The nature of
the deposit, which forms a discrete layer
with visible upper and lower interfaces in all
units in which it appears (except in BHT 3,
where it is more diffuse), and the presence
of the three preserved hearth features (which
consistently extend from the bottom of this
deposit), suggest that the site has suffered
only
minimal
disturbances
from
biortubation,
erosion,
or
modern
construction impacts. While higher artifact
densities (by level) did correspond
somewhat to the occupation deposit in most
units, the excavations also documented
significant numbers of artifacts in levels
below the deposit. In most of these, the
number of artifacts decreased as depth
increased, most likely indicating a slow
downward migration of artifacts through the
underlying sandy sediment. Recovered
artifacts continued to support the Early
Ceramic/Late Prehistoric date indicated
during the survey, with chronologically
diagnostic materials limited to two Perdiz
arrow points and a total of 71 pottery sherds.

At the time of the original survey,
no construction was planned for the portion
of the project area in which 41HR991 is
located. It was recommended that should
future impacts be planned, testing
investigations should occur at 41HR991 in
order to determine its eligibility for
nomination to the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP). The newly planned
HCFCD channel modifications of this

43

deposition issues (e.g., does the vertical
distribution of artifacts reflect primary,
systemic deposition over a long period
[possible multi-component]
or postdepositional movement?). The presence of
significant amount of carbon in the hearth
features and scattered throughout the
occupation deposit should provide for
humate or AMS-based dates in order to
address the questions related to site
chronology.

In summary, the intact nature of the
deposits, associated features, and the
presence and distribution of chronologically
diagnostic materials is consistent with the
criteria for establishing significant research
potential for the site. Consequently, it is
recommended that the site be considered
eligible for listing on the National Register
of Historic Places.
Further, because
extensive construction disturbance is
planned for the area as part of HCFCD
stream
modification
efforts,
it
is
recommended
that
data
recovery
excavations be conducted prior to
construction at site 41HR991.

In addition, the test excavations
have determined that the northeastern
portion of the site contains the best
preserved cultural deposits, well-defined
features, and the highest densities and
varieties of artifacts.
In contrast, as
demonstrated by shovel test results, XU 4,
BHTs 1 and 2 (as well as BHTs 3 and 4
from the survey), and XU 4, the
southwestern portion of the site contains
more diffuse deposits, and lighter densities
of cultural materials. Consequently, data
recovery efforts should be focused more
heavily in the northeastern half of the site.
Further, it may be possible for HCFCD to
modify their construction plans to reduce
impacts and ensure preservation of some
portion of the northern end of site.

The design of the data recovery
excavations should consider both the nature
of the cultural deposits as well as the
proposed construction impacts. Research
should attempt to address several questions,
including 1) the determination of site
function and confirmation of its occupation
chronology, 2) the distribution of features
and/or associated activity areas, 3) the
potential functions of those features based
on physical form, distribution, and fill
contents (e.g., types of fuel used, or varieties
of flora/fauna processed), and 4) site
