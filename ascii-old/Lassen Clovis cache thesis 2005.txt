ABSTRACT

A Comparison of Clovis Caches. (December 2005)
Robert Detlef Lassen, B.A., Southwestern University
Chair of Advisory Committee: Dr. David Carlson

The Clovis caches in this study consist of assemblages of tools left behind in an
area either for future use or as ritual offerings. Clovis caches are the earliest of such
assemblages known in North America. This research specifically examines a sample of
four caches: East Wenatchee from Douglas County, Washington; Anzick from Park
County, Montana; Simon from Camas County, Idaho; and Fenn, inferred to be from
Sweetwater County, Wyoming. The artifact types in this study include fluted points,
bifaces, blades, flakes, bone rods, and miscellaneous. The variables used in this study
include maximum length, mid-length and maximum width, thickness,
(length*width*thickness)/1000, length/width, and width/thickness; using millimeters as
the basic measurement unit. This study utilizes five methods in the study of the caches:
descriptive statistics, factor analysis, cluster analysis, correspondence analysis, and
geoarchaeology. The descriptive statistics reveal the most prominent trends that become
more apparent in the subsequent statistical analyses. Such trends include East Wenatchee
containing the largest points but the smallest bifaces, Anzick and Simon having
significant biface variation, Fenn tending to be average in most respects, and bone rods
being larger in East Wenatchee than they are in Anzick. The factor analysis explores the
relationships between the variables and assigns them to larger components. Length,

iv
width, thickness, and length*width*thickness comprise the size component, and
length/width and width/thickness make up the shape component. The cluster analysis
examines the artifacts within each site and between all sites to identify the most
appropriate grouping arrangements based on similarities in artifact measurements. The
general results show that fluted points form three clusters according to size more than
shape, bifaces are highly variable but have no obvious clusters, and bone rods form three
clusters with the first two being strictly divided by site. The correspondence analysis
shows that the differences in count data between caches appear to relate to the geographic
distances between them. Finally, geoarchaeological analysis posits that East Wenatchee
has no discernable pit feature, Anzick contains only one human burial, Simon was not
deposited in a pluvial lake, and Fenn would have been shallowly buried but was probably
disturbed by erosion.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

First of all, this thesis is dedicated to the memory of Dr. Robson Bonnichsen. Dr.
Bonnichsen was my committee chair through most of my career as a masters student, and
it was his notes, resources, and wisdom that set this thesis in motion. He was a brilliant
archaeologist and a genuinely fun-loving human being. My three final committee
members, Dr. David Carlson, Dr. Michael Waters, and Dr. Vatche Tchakerian, have
helped immensely with various aspects of my thesis. Dr. Carlson has been extremely
helpful with his knowledge of statistical techniques and computer programs. Dr. Waters
has provided invaluable help in suggesting geological literature that is relevant to this
research. Finally, Dr. Tchakerian has been willing to join my committee and offer his
help, despite the fact that he has an already busy schedule as the new associate dean of
the College of Geosciences.
Other archaeologists and scientists have been extremely helpful in more specific
aspects of my research. Dr. Alston Thoms has always been willing to listen to and
discuss my hypotheses on the ecology of Clovis cache sites. Dr. Bruce Dickson was kind
enough to let me rehearse my presentation to the Society for American Archaeology with
him. Dr. Sheela Athreya and Dr. Darryl DeRuiter familiarized me with the software used
in the correspondence analyses. Pat Clabaugh taught me how to use 7.5 topographic
maps, and the employees at the Map Room in the Evans Library were gracious enough to
give me access to their collection. I also would like to thank Kevin Miller for providing
me a free copy of his own thesis on Texas biface caches. Lynette Miller of the
Washington State Historical Society was very helpful in matching the catalog numbers of

vi
the East Wenatchee artifacts to their drawings on the site map. I would also like to thank
the Park County, Montana and Sweetwater County, Wyoming Natural Resources
Conservation Service for their help in analyzing soil chemistry. Jeff Louis of the
Wyoming NRCS and Montana state archaeologist Stan Wilmoth were especially helpful.
Next, all my friends at the Texas A&M Anthropology Department deserve a
hearty thanks for providing a close-knit support group of stressed out grad students.
Victoria Springer, Eleanor Dahlin, Juan Urista, David Foxe, Shanna Richardson, Michael
Aiuvalasit, Tim Riley, Phil Johnson, Chris Cook, Charlotte Penvy, Jason Barrett, Victor
Galan, Jesse Halligan, Katherine Turner-Pearson, Retno Sulistijo, Eric Bartelink, Jason
Wiersema, Cassady Yoder, Maria Parks, Bill Dickens, Jim Wiederhold, Scott Minchak,
and Katie Custer have all made my life and my work more enjoyable.
Also, I would like to thank my family for enduring and encouraging my fanatical
interest in archaeology. My parents, Peter and Carol Lassen, always support me in any
way possible and constantly send archaeologically related newspaper clippings my way.
My brother, James, has always been willing to join me in exploring the Texas countryside
whenever we get together.
Finally, I owe a huge debt of gratitude to my good friend, Ashley Smallwood.
Ever since Dr. Bonnichsen first assigned us to work together, Ashley has been my
harshest critic and my biggest fan. I want to thank her for making me a better person.

INTRODUCTION

Overview

The Problem
Clovis caches present a unique problem to those who study early Paleoindians.
Most prehistoric archaeological sites in North America have a purpose that can be
understood through careful archaeological research. Camp sites, kill sites, and quarries
have identifiable features, tools, and locations to indicate their function. On the other
hand, Clovis caches of finished and unfinished tools often pose more questions than
answers. Are they for trade or for ceremony? Are they left behind for the living to
retrieve, or are they offerings to the dead? Not all caches contain the same types of
artifacts, and it is almost certain that not all caches serve the same purpose. This research
examines Clovis caches â the earliest tool caches known in North America â and attempts
to quantify their similarities and differences as objectively as possible. The study of
Clovis caches has been marred with conjecture and opinionated statements with little
attention to quantitative comparative methods. This analysis provides the some of the
first steps to the systematic comparison of these enigmatic tool kits.*

The Clovis Technological Complex
Clovis technology cannot be considered a âcultureâ in the way that historic Native
American groups are referred. Clovis may represent multiple early North American
cultures that shared the same technology. However, since the technology (particularly
the stone tools) is the only surviving remnant of these groups, they are bound under the
umbrella term of the Clovis complex.
Clovis technology became known to modern Americans in 1937, when Clovis
points were found in association with extinct Pleistocene mammal remains at Blackwater
Draw Locality No. 1 near the town of Clovis, New Mexico (Hester 1972:26). However,
Clovis tools (previously believed to be Folsom) had been found before 1937, particularly
at the Dent site in 1932 (Haynes et al. 1998). In the subsequent decades, Clovis sites
have been found throughout much of North America, and from coast to coast in the
continental United States. Clovis sites typically fall into categories of kill sites like
Blackwater Draw and Colby (Hester 1972, Frison 1991), camp sites such as Aubrey
(Ferring 1989), quarry sites such as Gault (Collins and Hester 2001), and cache sites such
as East Wenatchee (Gramly 1993), although sites can have multiple purposes and their
functions can overlap.
The Clovis âtool kitâ tends to vary across archaeological sites and regions of
North America, so any general summary of Clovis technology presents an idealized
perspective. The most distinctive product of Clovis technology is the Clovis fluted point.
Clovis points are typically lanceolate with concave bases and straight sides that gradually
bend to a point at the distal end. The most distinctive characteristic is the flute: the flake
scar that the knapper leaves on the point after long, narrow flakes are struck from the

3

center of the proximal end. Flutes usually extend to about one third of the length of a
typical Clovis point and give the point a grooved appearance. In most cases (Collins
1999:46), pristine Clovis points are at least 10 cm long, and the points found in Clovis
caches are considerably longer (Figure 1).

1993:26).

4

Common tools in Clovis sites also include various other chipped stone artifacts.
Bifaces, scrapers, and prismatic blades also appear frequently. In some areas, notably the
Gault site in Texas, Clovis blades are made from polyhedral, conical cores. However,
blades and blade cores are not universally present in Clovis sites, as they are absent in the
northeastern United States and rare in the west (Collins and Hester 2004). Tools made
from organic materials are rare, but they do exist. The most notable are bone rods, such
as the ones that are present in the East Wenatchee and Anzick caches (Gramly 1993,
Lahren and Bonnichsen 1974). Additionally, a shaft-straightener made of mammoth
bone from the Murray Springs site in Arizona (Haynes and Hemmings 1968) and the
flaked mammoth bone from South Dakotaâs Lange-Ferguson site (Hannus 1989) indicate
further Clovis use of organic materials. For the most part, adzes and other woodworking
tools are considered to be absent from Clovis sites (Thoms personal communication), but
some archaeologists interpret some Clovis bifacial artifacts to be adzes (Collins and
Hester 2004, Gramly 1993). Additionally, logic would indicate that Clovis technology
did involve some form of woodworking, if only for building shelters or creating shafts for
spears and darts (Haynes 2002:116-117).

Caching Behavior
The term âcacheâ has highly variable definitions depending on the author, so the
same stone tool assemblage that one archaeologist considers a cache might not fit the
definition of the term according to another archaeologist. Some archaeologists, such as
Miller (1993:7-8) tend to lump all similar assemblages together under the heading of
caches, regardless of their possible purposes or associations. On the other hand, Collins

5

(1999:173-177) splits such assemblages based on their purposes. Technically, a cache is
something that is retrieved at a later date. An assemblage that is left at a location for an
undetermined period of time is considered storage, and an assemblage that is deposited
for religious reasons is called votive. In this research, I lump all of these assemblage
types under the general heading of cache behavior. The purposes of each collection in
this study may have been different or the same, but since theories surrounding the
purposes of most caches are so speculative, it makes more logical sense to group them
together based solely on composition. All the caches in this study are made up of Clovis
stone and sometimes bone tools, nearly all of them contain finished fluted points and
indicate some presence of red ochre, and they are in relatively useful condition (i.e. not
merely discarded).
Archaeologists have put forth numerous theories on the purpose of tool caching,
but a general synthesis can place them into three categories: trade, security, and ritual.
Trade theories involve economic interactions between people or groups. Miller (1993)
states that trade caches could be used for the exchange of exotic raw materials between
groups. Additionally, Kornfeld et al. (1990:302) states that caches can indicate signs of a
power struggle among more and less dominant groups. If a dominant group caches tools,
it may be in order to increase the scarcity of the resources and to ensure their value. If a
less dominant group utilizes tool caches, they could be asserting their independence from
other groups who have greater control over raw materials. Lafferty (1994:199) argues
that caches could represent a form of ceremonial exchange between groups in order to
improve their prestige and interpersonal relations. These exchanges ensure that one
group would help the other in times of need.

6

Security is the second general purpose for caches. Overall, security caches are
intended for the storage of tools that may be needed at a later date. In some cases, a
group may knap more tools at a quarry site than they are able to carry, and so they must
secure the tools in a cache until they can return with enough people to remove the tools.
Similarly, a group may use the tools to extract resources (such as food), then cache the
tools at the site in order to carry more of the resources. These assemblages are known as
load-exchange caches (Miller 1993:10-11). Another commonly held theory is that caches
may have served as âbanksâ of tools to be exchanged for other resources or services.
Also, these caches may have been located along trade or travel routes to supply people
with tools as needed (Rathje and Schiffer 1982). Wiseman et al. (1994:69) claim that
some caches aid in the exploration and exploitation of a new area.
The final general purpose of caches is ritual. Some archaeologists do not consider
these assemblages to be actual caches because there they are not intended to be retrieved.
However, they often contain the same or similar types of artifacts as trade and security
caches, so ritual assemblages can be studied as caches. The most obvious kind of ritual
cache is the burial assemblage. One known burial cache, the Anzick site, is one of the
four caches to be analyzed in this study. Burial caches consist of the artifacts that are
associated with buried human remains. Other ritual caches are only indirectly associated
with human remains. According to Kohntopp (2001:21), caches can serve as memorials
to people who died but are buried elsewhere, much in the same way that modern people
leave tributes along roadsides to friends or family members who have passed away.
Other ritual caches, such as offertory or dedicatory, are not associated with human
remains at all. Offertory caches may represent tributes paid to deities and may appear in

7

the archaeological record as isolated finds (Miller 1993:15). Dedicatory caches represent
artifacts that individuals contribute towards the dedication of a new structure or site
(Rathje and Schiffer 1982:114). Ritual caches such as these offer archaeologists a
glimpse into the importance that earlier peoples placed on various artifacts.
Scott Jones (1997:12-13), states that archaeologists accept five Clovis caches as
being âuniqueâ among caches in general. These Clovis caches are East Wenatchee,
Anzick, Simon, Fenn, and Drake. Archaeologists consider these five caches to be unique
in particular because they are not associated with other activities such as habitation or the
acquiring of raw materials, the caches contain finished artifacts that are large and wellmade, and archaeologists have noted the presence of red ochre at most of these sites.
Based on this evidence, many archaeologists have theorized that the âuniqueâ Clovis
caches are all representative of early Paleoindian ritual activities. Stanford and Jodry
(1988) even suggest that all five caches indicate human burial sites, although preserved
human remains have only been found in association with the Anzick cache.
The presence of red ochre is also a source of debate among archaeologists who
seek to interpret these cache sites. Red ochre is a naturally occurring ferruginous red dye
that Native Americans used extensively throughout prehistory. It is often sprinkled on
human burials, used in rock art, applied as an insect repellent, used in the tawing of hides,
and may aid in the preservation of wood (Roper 1991:291-292, 295-296). For the Clovis
period, Roper (1996) states that red ocher is overwhelmingly more common at cache sites
than at any other kind of Clovis site, and ochre is only present in Clovis sites in the
northern half of the United States with the Busse cache in Kansas being the southernmost
occurrence. Additionally, Roper (1991) asserts that during North Americaâs Paleoindian

8

and Eurasiaâs Upper Paleolithic periods, ochre is exclusively present in mortuary, ritual,
and domestic contexts. Since none of the Clovis cache sites have evidence of habitation,
one could reasonably infer that they are therefore mortuary or ritual sites. On the other
hand, Titmus and Woods (1991) argue that red ochre may have additionally been used in
the abrading and polishing of the basal edges of fluted points. Therefore, small traces of
red ochre may not indicate ritual activity, but large quantities may.
Unfortunately, red ochre is not present in the same amounts in all Clovis cache
sites. Ochre is extremely prevalent at the Anzick site, where the mineral is associated
with the Clovis artifacts and one of the two human burials (Lahren 1999). Red ochre is
probably also present at the Simon site, in that the artifacts were associated with a redstained portion of the ground (Butler 1963:23). Red ochre is present at the East
Wenatchee site, but only in an extremely small quantity. According to Gramly (1993:2527), the red ochre appears only in the hafting area of three fluted points, indicated a
possible utilitarian rather than ritual use of the mineral. Nearly all the artifacts from the
Fenn cache exhibit traces of red ochre, but it lack of context complicates any further
analyses (Frison and Bradley 1999:22). Finally, the Drake cache is unusual in that no red
ochre is associated with it whatsoever (Stanford and Jodry 1988:21). Possibly, the
differing quantities of red ochre at these cache sites represent different cache purposes, or
they could reflect different cultures or trends within the Clovis technological complex.

9

History of Discovery

The four Clovis caches that comprise the bulk of this study are East Wenatchee,
Anzick, Simon, and Fenn (Figure 2). The selection of these four caches is based on the
facts that they are definitely Clovis as indicated by their fluted point morphologies, they
are considered âuniqueâ based on Jonesâ (1997) criteria, and they have reliable
measurement data for use in statistical comparisons.

Figure 2: Clovis caches discussed in this research. The four sample caches are (1) East Wenatchee, (2)
Anzick, (3) Simon, and (4) Fenn. Additional caches include (5) Drake, (6) Crook County, (7) Keven
Davis, (8) Busse, and (9) Green.

East Wenatchee (45DO482)
In May 1987, workers at R&R Orchards just north of Pangborn Airport in East
Wentachee, Washington uncovered a Clovis cache while digging a ditch for an irrigation
pipe. In August of that year, Robert Mierendorf and R. Congdon dug test pits at the site

10

and uncovered artifacts below and next to the irrigation ditch. Upon realizing that the site
is an important Clovis feature, the landowner (Mack Richey) placed concrete slabs over
the site for protection (Mehringer 1989:1).
Excavation of the site resumed in April 1988 under the direction of Peter
Mehringer, with participants ranging from Washington State University members, the
Colville Confederated Tribes, and renowned Paleoindian experts from all over the United
States. The purpose of this week-long excavation was to define the extent of the site, to
understand the stratigraphy of the surrounding area, to obtain an approximate age for the
site based on stratigraphic relationships, and to prepare for future large-scale excavations
(Mehringer 1989:1). At the end of the week, the landowner replaced the concrete slabs
over the site in the expectation that a well-prepared team of archaeologists would more
fully excavate the site in the future (Wheat 1990).
By October 1990, the Mack and Susan Richey had selected Michael Gramly to
excavate the site more completely. The excavation lasted for one month and was fraught
with controversy. Representatives from the Colville Confederated Tribes protested the
excavation (Rea 1990), other archaeologists contested Gramlyâs methods and
interpretations (Mierendorf 1997), and the ownership of the artifacts and of the property
itself became an issue (Wheat 1991, 1992a, 1992b). The dispute eventually settled with
Mack Richey donating the assemblage to the Washington State History Museum in
Tacoma, and with the Washington State Historical Society purchasing the rights to
excavate the site in the future. However, the 1992 agreement also included the
imposition of a 15-year moratorium on further excavations. In the meantime, apple trees
have been replanted over the site, and the orchard continues to operate as before (Wheat

11

1992b). Currently as of 2000, one third of the East Wenatchee cache assemblage is on
display at the Burke Museum in Seattle, one third is on display at the Washington State
History Museum, and the final portion is in storage (Brooker 2000).

Anzick (24PA506)
According to Larry Lahren (ca 1990) Bill Bray found a large biface eroding out of
a rocky outcrop along Flathead Creek, just southeast of Wilsall, Montana in 1961. No
one noticed the significance of the site, however, until two construction workers
uncovered the rest of the cache, along with human remains, in 1968. Ben Hargis and
Calvin Sarver were removing fill from the outcrop with a front-end loader to be used in
the construction of a high school. After removing the fill, they decided to use some finer
sediment from the outcrop to fill a pothole. They noticed that the finer sediment
contained a stone artifact, so they returned that evening to investigate the area with hand
shovels. After discovering nearly a hundred artifacts covered in red ochre, they
encountered human remains and stopped digging (Lahren ca 1990). Shortly afterwards,
Lahren identified the artifacts as Clovis, and the ownership of the collection was split
with half of the artifacts going to the landowner, Melvyn Anzick, and the other half being
split equally among the two workers (Lahren and Bonnichsen 1971).
Later that same year, D. C. Taylor (1969) investigated the Anzick site and
determined its excavation to be âan exercise in frustration,â based on the lack of intact
deposits and artifacts. However, Hargis and Sarver believed that Taylorâs dismissal
downplayed the importance of the site, so they contacted Lahren and Bonnichsen to
conduct additional investigations in 1970 and 1971. These investigations defined the

12

stratigraphy of the site and uncovered an ochre-encrusted human clavicle (Lahren and
Bonnichsen 1971). Lahren and Bonnichsenâs interest in the Anzick cache brought muchdeserved attention to the discovery and resulted in a presentation to the Society for
American Archaeology and several publications (Lahren and Bonnichsen ca 1970s, 1971,
1974; Canby 1979).
However, despite the attention that the cache received, studying the entire
collection was nearly impossible because it was split among several individuals. For
nearly twenty years, Larry Lahren worked to reunite the artifacts under a single roof.
Eventually, his efforts succeeded and the entire cache was put on permanent loan and put
on display at the Montana State Museum in 1988 (Jones 1997:29-31).

Simon (10CM7)
The Simon cache was found in 1961 when William Simon was scraping a
roadway along a plowed field on his property in Camas county, Idaho. Believing the
cache to be of archaeological significance, he brought it to the Idaho State College
Museum for identification. B. Robert Butler identified the cache as Clovis and, with the
help of the landowner, analyzed the context of the find as thoroughly as possible (Butler
1963).
Steve Kohntopp (2001:26-28) points out that several discrepancies in the number
of artifacts present in the Simon cache have emerged since Butlerâs initial report. Butler
(1963) originally reports 29 artifacts, but Butler and Fitzwater (1965) amend that count
and state that two of the artifacts had broken off of a larger biface, bringing the total to
27. However, a subsequent study by Woods and Titmus (1985) describes 33 Simon

13

artifacts. Kohntopp (2001:27-28) explains that the addition of the six extra artifacts is
most likely the result of the donation of a few previously-overlooked artifacts from the
Simon family. The 33 artifacts of the Simon cache currently (as of 2001) reside in the
Herrett Center for Arts and Science in Twin Falls, Idaho (Kohntopp 2001:28).

Fenn
Out of the four caches in this study, the Fenn cache easily has the most mysterious
history of discovery. Fortunately, archaeologists can use multiple lines of evidence to
trace its origin. In 1988, Forrest Fenn acquired the cache collection in Santa Fe, New
Mexico (Frison and Bradley 1999:22). The artifactsâ similarity to those from the East
Wenatchee cache prompted Fenn to contact George Frison and Bruce Bradley for an
analysis of the collection. Based on the research that Fenn, Frison, and Bradley
conducted, the cache was found around the turn of the 20th century either in a plowed
field or inside a cave. Descendents of the finders state that the original location of the
cache was near the borders of Utah, Wyoming, and Idaho. The finders had handed the
cache down among their family, eventually giving it to a daughter-in-law for her
wedding. The daughter-in-law then sold the collection in Santa Fe (Frison and Bradley
1999:22).
Three observations on the content of the cache indicate the likelihood that it came
from near the Utah/Wyoming/Idaho border. First, 17 of the 56 artifacts are made from
Green River chert from southwest Wyoming (Frison and Bradley 1999:107). Also, two
of the fluted points from the Fenn cache bear a strong resemblance to the fluted points
found at the Colby site in southeast Wyoming. These fluted points have very deep basal

14

concavities and rounded ears, representing a style that seems to be unique to Wyoming.
Finally, one crescent is present in the Fenn cache. Since crescents are typical of the
Western Stemmed complex of the Great Basin, it is reasonable to infer that the Fenn
cache came from within or adjacent to the Great Basin.

Definitions of the Variables

Artifact Types
This study divides the artifacts from these cache sites into six categories: fluted
points, bifaces, blades, flakes, bone rods, and other. Because this analysis is made up of
pre-existing data collected by different archaeologists, the finer points of these definitions
may vary form cache to cache. However, the archaeological community universally
acknowledges these terms, and it is unlikely that individual interpretations have had a
significant impact on the data. Fluted points are defined by the presence of flutes
(channel flake scars from the base of the points) on both sides, a concave base, and a
lanceolate midsection that comes to a triangular point. Bifaces consist of stone tools that
have been flaked on two surfaces along a single edge. They are distinct from fluted
points in that bifaces lack the presence of flutes and have straight or convex bases.
Blades are large flakes that are at least twice as long as they are wide. Like flakes, a
blade should exhibit a platform and a bulb of percussion. Additionally, a blade usually
has one or two longitudinal ridges along the center of the artifact. Flakes are shards of
stone that have been removed from a larger piece. As previously stated, a complete flake
has a platform and a bulb of percussion. Additionally, ripples and hackle marks may be

15

present. Bone rods represent the only non-lithic items found in the cache sites. They are
cylindrical shafts of bone that are beveled on one or both ends (Bonnichsen et al. 1995).
Archaeologists may refer to them as bone foreshafts, although this definition is
hypothetical. The final category is reserved for âotherâ artifacts that do not pertain to any
of the previous categories. One example would be the crescent from the Fenn cache.
Fluted points, bifaces, and bone rods are the most vital artifact categories in this
analysis because of their comparable sample sizes and accurate measurements. Blades
and miscellaneous artifacts do not have significant sample sizes to be compared between
these sample caches. Flakes are numerous in the East Wenatchee cache and present in
the Anzick cache, but they are not accurately measured. However, the correspondence
analysis accounts for all artifact categories.

General Variables
Variables had to be carefully selected for use in this study. Because the analysis
is based on data that have been collected independently from the four collections, the
only applicable variables are ones that match across all the caches. Additionally, the
methods that researchers used to obtain the measurements may differ from cache to
cache, but such discrepancies should not impact the overall trends in the data. The
variable descriptions provided here are based primarily on Bonnichsen et al.âs (1995)
database schematic for the East Wenatchee cache. The measurement methods used for
the Anzick cache are similar to East Wenatcheeâs, but the methods for Simon and Fenn
are not described (CSFA ca. 1974; Jones 1997; Kohntopp 2001; Frison and Bradley

16

1999). Additional variables may be used in comparisons of artifacts within individual
caches.
Maximum Length. Bonnichsen et al. (1995) state that this variable is a
measurement between the two most distant longitudinal points on an artifact. For the
East Wenatchee cache, each artifact is traced onto graph paper and measured from lines
drawn perpendicular to the most proximal and distal ends. Maximum length is the most
basic and easily identified variable.
Mid-Length Width. This variable applies primarily to fluted points and bifaces.
Bonnichsen et al. (1995) describe this method as drawing a bisecting line perpendicular
to the length of the artifact at one half of the artifactâs maximum length, and measuring
the width along this bisection line. This variable applies well to East Wenatchee and
Anzick caches, but Simon and Fenn have only a generic âwidthâ measurement.
Maximum Width. The method for obtaining maximum width is the same as
maximum length, except along the opposite axis. This variable applies best to blades and
flakes.
Thickness. This is one of the more poorly defined variables. For the Anzick
cache and the East Wenatchee bifaces, the thickness measurement represents an artifactâs
thickness at its mid-length point (Bonnichsen et al. 1995). However, the variable is not
defined for the fluted points (it was mistakenly skipped over in the descriptions).
Weight. While it is important, the weight variable is not included in most portions
of this study. This decision is based on the fact that the data from the Simon cache do not
include weight measurements (Kohntopp 2001:33). However, because weight is such an
important tool for estimating overall artifact size, this study includes a ratio substitute.

17

(L*W*T)/1000. This is the first of three ratio variables used in this study. This
variable consists of the multiplication of length, width, and thickness, divided by 1000. It
acts as an assessment of overall artifact size and replaces the missing weight variable.
Length/Width. The second ratio is length divided by width. It is intended as an
assessment of artifact shape.
Width/Thickness. The final ratio is width divided by thickness. Like
length/width, it is an approximation of artifact shape.

DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS

Individual Sites

East Wenatchee
The artifacts of the East Wenatchee cache fall into five broad categories: fluted
points, bifaces, blades, flakes, and bone rods. Each of these categories has different
overall measurements, so each category must be studied on its own terms. Fluted points
and bone rods have a wide variety of measurement variables, while flakes often have
only weight measurements. Therefore, it would be confusing and counterproductive to
analyze the set of artifacts as a whole, except by using count data.
The fluted points of the East Wenatchee cache have an extensive array of
variables to describe their sizes and shapes. Excavations at the site to this point have
uncovered a total of 14 fluted points. Bonnichsen et alâs (1995) East Wenatchee database
provides 18 variables for studying fluted points. The variables (in millimeters) consist of
maximum length, maximum width, distal width, proximal width, mid-length width,
maximum thickness, maximum flute thickness, maximum base width, maximum basal
depth, maximum length of basal grinding on the right and left edges of the stem, number
of flutes on the obverse and reverse faces, maximum flute length on the obverse and
reverse faces, maximum flute width on the obverse and reverse faces, and weight in
grams. These measurements are much more extensive than those on most other artifact
types, and no other cache site has published resources that detail so many fluted point
variables. Therefore, I have narrowed down my descriptive analysis to the nine most

19

relevant variables: maximum length, mid-length width, maximum thickness, maximum
basal depth, number of flutes on the obverse and reverse, flute length on the obverse and
reverse, and weight. Additionally, I include ratios of (length*width*thickness)/1000,
length/width, width/thickness, and length/maximum basal depth (Table 1).

The distribution of measurements on the fluted points is predominantly nonnormal. Mid-length width, weight, (L*W*T)/1000, length/width, and length/basal depth
are bimodal, and only maximum thickness and possibly obverse flute length come close
to resembling normality.
The bifaces from the East Wenatchee cache do not have as many measurement
variables as the fluted points, but the artifacts have enough measurements necessary to
complete a statistical analysis. In the collection, there are a total of 18 bifaces, with all of
them having measured attributes. Bonnichsen et al (1995) provide 12 variables for

20

measuring the size and shape of bifaces. These variables are essentially the same as the
fluted point variables, with the exception that the bifaces have no variables for measuring
flute attributes. For this research, I have chosen seven variables to describe the
measurements of the bifaces: maximum length, mid-length width, maximum thickness,
weight, (L*W*T)/1000, length/width, and width/thickness (Table 2).

Like fluted points, the measurements from the bifaces are mostly non-normally
distributed. Mid-length width and thickness are the two variables that come closest to
normaility, while the rest tend to be skewed to the right.
Blades represent an often-overlooked portion of the East Wenatchee cache, but
they are worth mentioning for the fact that few cache sites contain both blades and
bifacial tools. Excavations at East Wenatchee have revealed 9 blades, 6 of which have
measurements on all applicable variables. Bonnichsen et al (1995) devised four variables
for measuring blades, and all four variables will be used here as well: maximum length,
maximum width, maximum thickness, and weight (Table 3). I have also included the
ratio variables as additional measurements.

The weight variable includes measurements from two blades that are excluded from the other variables.
These two blades are probably fragmented and have blown up the standard deviation and skewed the mean
and median.

Unfortunately, all of the variables for blades contain gaps in the data, and multiple
modes exist for all variables as well. The only possible normal distribution is for the
length/width ratio.
Flakes are relatively numerous in East Wenatchee considering that they are not
present in most cache sites. The East Wenatchee cache has revealed 62 flakes so far, but
only 6 of them have length, width, or thickness measurements, and only 3 have enough
attributes to enable the (L*W*T)/1000 measurement. Whenever possible, analyses
include the length, width, thickness, and ratio variables (Table 4). However, weight is
the only variable that encompasses nearly all of the flakes.

The flakesâ weight illustrates the extreme variance in the assemblage. The fact
that the standard deviation is nearly five times larger than the mean weight of the flakes
indicates that huge outliers are present, while the majority of the flakes are extremely
small. The same statistical problem appears in the (L*W*T)/1000 measurement,
although the small sample size is the more likely factor in this case.
The bone rods represent the final class of artifacts that have come out of the East
Wenatchee site. Excavations have uncovered twelve measurable bone rod artifacts.
Bonnichsen et al (1995) have outlined 16 different variables for measuring the bone rods.
These variables consist of maximum length, maximum width, maximum thickness,
proximal bevel length, mid-proximal bevel width, mid-proximal bevel thickness,
proximal bevel angle, pre-proximal bevel width, pre-proximal thickness, 1/3 shaft width,
1/3 shaft thickness, Â½ shaft width, Â½ shaft thickness, 2/3 shaft width, 2/3 shaft thickness,
and distal bevel length. These exhaustive measurements are not necessary for this
research, so the numbers of variables are reduced to maximum length, maximum width,
maximum thickness, weight, and the ratio variables (Table 5).

The measurements of the bone rods show a relative degree of uniformity,
particularly for width and thickness. However, an abnormally small outlier is present.
The outlier most likely represents a broken bone rod, but that does not explain why its
width and thickness are also much smaller than average. Excluding the outlier, width and
weight appear normally distributed, with length and (L*W*T)/1000 being bimodal.

Anzick
The assemblage from the Anzick site contains the same artifact classes as East
Wenatchee, except that Anzick lacks blades. Instead, the Anzick assemblage represents a
strong emphasis on bifacial technology. The measurements of the Anzick artifacts lack
some of the more obscure variables that Bonnichsen et al (1995) applied to the East
Wenatchee cache, but enough variables are available through Bonnichsenâs personal
measurements and Scott Jonesâ (1997) masters thesis to provide an accurate comparison
to the East Wenatchee assemblage.

24

A total of eight fluted points are from the Anzick site. Seven of the points have
measurements for each analyzed variable. The variables applied to the Anzick points are
the same as those used on the East Wenatchee fluted points (Table 6).

The Anzick fluted points are considerably smaller than the East Wenatchee
points, but the proportions of their measurements seem comparable at a glance. The
weight, (L*W*T)/1000, and length/basal depth variables have considerably high standard
deviations, implying that a great degree of diversity exists in those measurements. With
the possible exception of the length/width ratio, no variables have normal distributions,
and most are skewed to the right.
Bifaces make up the vast majority of the Anzick cache, with a total of 69 cited
specimens. Moreover, no less than 64 bifaces have attributes for every applicable
variable. The same seven variables that applied to the East Wenatchee bifaces also work
with the Anzick specimens (Table 7).

The high standard deviations of the weight and (L*W*T)/1000 are reminiscent of
the Anzick fluted point measurements, but the bifacesâ standard deviations are even more
acute. There are no immediately observable outliers for these variables, but they are
obviously skewed to the right. The only variables with normal distributions are thickness
and length/width ratio.
There are only seven flakes from the Anzick site. Fortunately, all seven flakes
have measurements for the seven basic variables (Table 8).

Once again, the high standard deviations of weight and (L*W*T)/1000 are
apparent. Most of the variables are skewed to the right, but maximum length may be
normally distributed. The small sample size makes the determination speculative,
however.
The Anzick cache contains eight bone rods. All eight of the specimens have been
measured, although a weight attribute is missing on one of the rods. The measurement
variables are the same as those used on the rods from East Wenatchee (Table 9).

The standard deviations for weight and (L*W*T)/1000 are not as high as on their
stone tool counterparts, but they are still fairly large for the bone rods. A minor outlier
appears to be present in the bone rod data for the weight and (L*W*T)/1000 variables.
The thickness variable is normally distributed.

Simon
The Simon cache consists exclusively of fluted points and bifaces. The collection
is made up of 33 known specimens. In his 2001 masterâs thesis, Steve Kohntopp records

27

measurements of the artifacts from the cache. He includes length, width, and thickness
(and I include the ratio variables), but he does not have weight measurements for the
artifacts.
The Simon cache contains only five fluted points. Therefore, the descriptive
statistics on the points are inexact (Table 10).

Due to the small sample size, normal distributions are nearly impossible to
discern. Length and width appear to be skewed to the left, and thickness and
(L*W*T)/1000 are skewed to the right.
The bifaces of the Simon cache are more numerous, with a total of 26 measured
artifacts (measurements from two other bifaces were unavailable to Kohntopp). The
bifaces have the same variables as the fluted points (Table 11).

Biface measurements are skewed to the right, but only slightly for length,
thickness, and the length/width ratio. Length is also bimodal. The standard deviation for
(L*W*T)/1000 is extremely high. A significant outlier is present, but some unknown
factor appears to be involved in this measurement as well.

Fenn
The Fenn assemblage also consists almost entirely of fluted points and bifaces. A
total of 56 artifacts comprise the collection, with 54 of them being studied in this
analysis. The remaining two artifacts are a single blade and a crescent. Because only one
of each of these artifacts is present in the Fenn assemblage, statistical analyses would be
ineffective. The measurements used in this study come from Frison and Bradleyâs (1999)
book, The Fenn Cache: Clovis Weapons and Tools.
The Fenn cache has 21 known fluted points. Frison and Bradley utilize four
variables (length, width, thickness, and weight) to describe the artifacts. This analysis
also uses Frison and Bradleyâs variables, with the addition of the ratios (Table 12).

Like the points from the Anzick site, the Fenn fluted points have high standard
deviations for weight and (L*W*T)/1000. An outlier exists in all variables, and this
outlier is more pronounced in the weight and (L*W*T)/1000 variables. Most variables
are skewed to the right, but the length/width and width/thickness ratios are more evenly
distributed.
The 33 bifaces from the Fenn cache have been measured according to the same
variables as the fluted points (Table 13). Although higher standard deviations for weight
and (L*W*T)/1000 are apparent in the bifaces, they are not as pronounced as the
standard deviations of the fluted points. Most variables are skewed to the right, although
thickness is normal and length is slightly skewed to the left.

Discussion
Analysis
The following box and whisker plots enable comparisons of each variable across
all four caches. Fluted points, bifaces, and bone rods are the most useful because they are
found in significant numbers in more than one cache. The first set of plots explores the
maximum length variable (Figure 3). These data show that the lengths of fluted points,
bifaces, and bone rods vary according to site. However, no single site has a monopoly on
large tools. For example, East Wenatchee has the longest fluted points but also the
shortest bifaces.
The width data show that more variation is present, particularly in bifaces, than in
the length data. Again, East Wenatchee has the largest fluted points and the smallest
bifaces (Figure 4).
Thickness is extremely homogenous among the bifaces points from all caches,
indicating its importance in bifacial reduction (Figure 5). Fluted points and bone rods
tend to be more variable (relative to their overall sizes), although the thickness
measurements on nearly all the points from the Simon cache are almost exactly the same.

31

(L*W*T)/1000, the ratio assessment of overall artifact size, reflects the dramatic
difference between the fluted points and bone rods from East Wenatchee when compared
to other caches (Figure 6). On the other hand, the bifaces have relatively homogenous
sizes, with the exceptions of the outlying points from each cache.
The length/width ratio variable tends to even out the variation among the caches
(Figure 7). Although fluted point ratios still differ between each cache, the differences
are not as extreme as in the other variables. The significantly larger variation in Anzickâs
bone rods when compared to East Wenatchee is probably due to breakage.
The width/thickness ratio is useful for flintknappers as an assessment of the
overall quality of a finished stone artifact. Interestingly, East Wenatchee and Anzick
have relatively high variabilities in their fluted points (Figure 8). The bifaces are
expected to have lower ratios, although several extreme outliers have very high values.

38

Variable Transformations
Based on the descriptive statistics on these four cache sites, it is apparent that
transformations would be necessary to normalize most measurement distributions.
Unfortunately, neither the base 10 logarithm nor the natural logarithm provide values that
normalize all of the variables. Some variables benefit from the transformations, but
many do not change significantly, and others worsen.
For the descriptive statistics from the East Wenatchee cache, the fluted points
remain largely unchanged by the transformations. Moreover, the thickness variable
becomes less normal. Biface measurements also do not change drastically, although
width becomes slightly more normal with the natural logarithm. Blades have a normal
width distribution using at base 10 logarithm, but nothing else changes. The same is true
for flakes, though the weight distribution also becomes somewhat more normal with a
natural log. In varying degrees, the bone rod measurements all become less normal after
the transformations.
For the Anzick cache, fluted point measurements become more normal in terms of
width and thickness after transformations. The natural logarithm works best for width,
and the base 10 logarithm is best for thickness. The transformations normalize all the
biface variables to varying degrees. For the most part, the natural logarithm improves the
data the most, although the base 10 logarithm is better for biface length. The
transformations for the flakes only normalize the weight variable, while the other
variables do not show much improvement. The bone rods also do not become normally
distributed after the transformations, and the thickness variable becomes less normal.

39

The fluted points from the Simon cache are too few in number to form accurate
transformations. The logarithms do not normalize the fluted point variables. The bifaces
from the Simon cache also do not normalize after the transformations.
For the Fenn cache, the fluted point variables become slightly more normal after
transformations. However, most variables (except width) remain skewed to the right.
The bifaces show similar results, but the weight and (L*W*T)/1000 variables become
normal after the transformations.
Using the base 10 and natural logarithms to normalize the distributions of the
measurement variables of the cache sites does not work in most cases. The sample size
for most variables is too small for the transformations to work well. Larger samples may
fill in gaps in the data in ways that mathematical transformations cannot. In cases where
the sample size is higher (n>20), the transformations have more success with normalizing
the distributions.

40

FACTOR ANALYSES

An integral part of this research is to compare Clovis cache artifacts on the basis
of both size and shape. As variables, âsizeâ and âshapeâ are too broad to be measured
directly. However, other variables can approximate the values of size and shape. Factor
analysis is a useful statistical tool for differentiating variables based on more generalized
concepts.
Factor analysis links variables together based on correlations. If two or more
variables change predictably when the other changes, then those variables are said to
have the same principal component, an independent generalized variable that links the
measurable variables together. For example, length and width tend to increase and
decrease together, but length obviously does not cause width. Instead, the overall factor
of size determines the relation between length and width. Factor analysis places related
variables into groups based on these correlations. The inference is that a different
principal component determines the measures of the variables in each group. However,
SPSS does not specify the nature of the principle components; instead, the researcher
must examine the interrelatedness of the variables in each component to determine the
identity of the components. In this respect, factor analysis is a somewhat subjective
science (Shenman 1997: 265-307).
As stated previously, the goal of this section is to distinguish between variables
that are indicative of size from those that signify shape. Afterwards, each group of
variables can be measured on its own terms so that both aspects of the Clovis cache
artifacts can be accurately studied. The SPSS version 12.0 factor analysis program

41

provides the results in this study. The results are based on the factor analysis function
being set to extract components for eigenvalues that are above 1.
The factor analysis function is set to analyze each artifact type separately: fluted
points, bifaces, blades, flakes, and bone rods. The sample sizes vary greatly between
artifact types, and not all types are present in each cache. Despite these differences, the
results of this initial analysis are fairly consistent across most artifact types. The factor
analysis utilizes the variables of maximum length, mid-length or maximum width,
maximum thickness, (L*W*T)/1000, length/width ratio, and width/thickness ratio. My
hypothesis is that the factor analysis should reveal two components for each artifact type,
with length, width, thickness, and (L*W*T)/1000 being the most prominent variables in
the first component (size); and with the length/width and width/thickness ratios being
most prominent in the second component (shape). As hypothesized, the variables always
condense into two components, regardless of artifact type (although bifaces are a
potential exception), but the influence of the variables within each component changes
according to artifact type.
For fluted points, the factor analysis yields two components with eigenvalues
above 1 (Table 14). The maximum length, mid-length width, thickness, and
(L*W*W)/1000 variables have the strongest representation in the first component. For
the second component, the width/thickness ratio is the only strong variable, with the
length/width ratio being a distant second (Table 15). The length/width and
width/thickness ratios are inversely related. In all, the two components account for
87.6% of the original variation of the fluted points.

The factor analysis of the bifaces provides two components with eigenvalues over
1 (3.256 and 1.587), but the next eigenvalue is .977, just slightly below the cutoff point
(Table 16). This third eigenvalue implies that a third, slightly subtler component exists in
the biface data. In the first component, length, width, and (L*W*T)/1000 are the most
prevalent variables. The second component gives almost equal weight to both the
length/width ratio and to the width/thickness ratio, with thickness being the next most
influential variable (Table 17). Like the fluted point results, the length/width ratio and
the width/thickness ratio are inversely related. The third component has thickness,
length/width ratio, and width/thickness ratio as its prevailing variables, though none of
them have values higher than .6. In the third component, the length/width and
width/thickness ratios are not inversely related. The first two components account for

43

about 80.7% of the variation, and adding the third component brings the percentage up to
97.

Blades are a rather uncommon artifact type among the four cache sites, as all but
one of them are from the East Wenatchee cache. However, running a factor analysis on
the blades is still necessary in order to observe continuities between the artifact types.
The results of the analysis yield two components, with eigenvalues of 4.449 and 1.462
(Table 18). The most prominent variables in the first component are length, width, and
oddly enough, the width/thickness ratio. The most important variables in the second
component are the length/width ratio, followed by width and the width/thickness ratio
(Table 19). The two components account for 98.5% of the variation in the data.

Flakes are only present in the East Wenatchee and Anzick caches, and most of the
East Wenatchee flakes are too small to be analyzed in this study. The factor analysis of
measurable flakes reveals two components, with eigenvalues of 3.58 and 1.641 (Table
20). The most prominent variables of the first component are width, thickness, and
(L*W*T)/1000. In the second component, the width/thickness ratio, length, and
thickness are the most important (Table 21). Interestingly, the length/width and
width/thickness ratios are positively related in the second component. The two
components account for about 87% of the variation in flakes.

Like the flakes, bone rods are also present only in the East Wenatchee and Anzick
caches. The bone rod variables have two components, with high eigenvalues of 3.471
and 2.09 (Table 22). The division among the components is the most obvious in the bone
rod data. The four variables of length, width, thickness, and (L*W*T)/1000 are all very
prominent in the first component; while the length/width and width/thickness ratios have
a strong influence in the second component (Table 23). As usual the length/width and
width/thickness ratios are inversely proportional. The two components comprise about
92.7% of the bone rodsâ variation.

Based on these factor analysis data, the artifact types show a fair degree of
uniformity in terms of the number of components and the makeup of the first component.
The second component has more variability among artifact types, with the differences
appearing primarily in blades and flakes. The fact that two components are present for
each artifact type indicates that a distinction between size and shape exists. The third
component in the biface data is something of an anomaly. Its meaning has yet to be
determined. Across all the artifact types in the first (size) component, the length/width
and width/thickness variables are never more prominent than maximum length, width,
thickness, or (L*W*T)/1000. Therefore, these latter four variables play a larger role in
estimating artifact size than do the two ratio variables. On the other hand, the
length/width and width/thickness ratio variables are more prominent in the second

47

(shape) component for fluted points, bifaces, and bone rods. In the second component of
blades, the length/width ratio has the largest value, but width/thickness is the third
largest. For flakes, width/thickness has the largest value, but the length/width ratio is the
fourth highest. Furthermore, flakes have the only shape component in which the two
ratios are not inversely related. It appears that the greater the technological control that
the toolmaker has over an artifact type, the more likely they are to fall into two evenly
divided components. Flakes and blades are the least refined of the artifacts, so their
components are not as defined.
A factor analysis run on the total assemblages from all four caches can provide a
perspective on the overall trends in the artifacts. As expected, the factor analysis finds
two components with eigenvalues over 1 (Table 24). Moreover, the most influential
variables in the first component are length, width, thickness, and (L*W*T)/1000; while
the second component has the highest values for the length/width and width/thickness
ratios, with the two ratios being inversely related (Table 25). Length and thickness are
also fairly high in the second component. This overall trend in the principal components
of the cache artifacts supports the hypothesis of size and shape categories.

Rotation may enable us to better understand the makeup of the components.
According to Kachiganâs (1991) description, rotation keeps the original positions of the
variables but rotates the axes of the components around them, balancing the values in
each component so that high and low values are always represented. Under regular
principal component analysis, the variables within each component have lower values
than their preceding components. Rotation ensures that the values will remain
proportional within each successive component. Additionally, rotation typically
eliminates middle-range values, leaving only high or low variables within each
component. The procedure therefore allows data to be more interpretable. However,
rotation is not without its problems. According to Baxter (1994), rotation is an arbitrary
technique that only adds more speculation to an already subjective procedure. Moreover,
different methods of rotation can give different results. For the purposes of this study, I
use Varimax Rotation with Kaiser Normalization.
For fluted points, the rotation makes no significant changes in the first component
(Table 26). Thickness becomes more significant than width, but little else changes. The
second component exhibits more changes. Although the width/thickness ratio is still the
strongest, the length/width ratio is no longer significant. It is instead outweighed by

49

width, (L*W*T)/1000, and length. However, there is still a negative relationship
between the length/width and width/thickness variables in the second component.

Rotation does not significantly alter the first component for bifaces either (Table
27). However, it does make some changes in the second componentâs variables that are
similar to the fluted point rotation. Without rotation, the length/width and
width/thickness ratios were the strongest variables in the second component. After
rotation, width/thickness becomes stronger, but thickness, width, and length are all more
significant than length/width. Finally, the third component shows that thickness and
length/width are the strongest variables without rotation. The rotated third component,
on the other hand, shows that the length/width ratio is easily the most prominent, while
the next highest variable, length, is only half the value of length/width.

Blades are an artifact type with which rotation appears to work particularly well
in terms of the expectations of this research (Table 28). Before rotation, the first
component is mostly typical, but it has a width/thickness variable that is greater than
expected. After rotation, the width/thickness variable is reduced, while the rest remain
relatively the same. The second component already shows fairly strong length/width and
width/thickness variables before rotation, although width is also anomalously high. The
rotation reduces the width variable and emphasizes the length/width and width/thickness
ratios.

On the other hand, flakes are not any more easily interpretable after rotation
(Table 29). Originally, the first component is typical, but rotation greatly reduces the
length variable and puts more emphasis on the length/width ratio. For the second
component, the rotation maintains the significance of the width/thickness ratio while
increasing the length and width variables.

Of all the artifact types in this analysis, bone rods are the least in need of rotation.
Moreover, rotation does not significantly alter the values of the variables within the
components (Table 30). Length, width, thickness, and (L*W*T)/1000 remain the most
prominent variables in the first component, and the length/width and width/thickness
ratios are the strongest in the second component. The only change that occurs after
rotation is that the differences between strong and weak variables generally become more
pronounced, particularly in the first component.

Rotation does not clarify all the results for all the artifacts; instead it enhances
some types and obscures others. For fluted points and bifaces, the first component
maintains its proportions after rotation, but the second component changes beyond

52

expectations, particularly in the length/width ratio variable. For the flakes, rotation
completely alters the proportions of the variables in both components. On the other hand,
rotating the components for blades and bone rods emphasizes both of the componentsâ
predicted proportions. Additionally, rotating the components for all artifacts as a group
supports the original hypothesis, although width is slightly lower in the first and higher in
the second component (Table 31).

CLUSTER ANALYSES

Archaeologists often refer to the similarity of the four Clovis caches, but cluster
analyses can investigate exactly how the caches relate to each other. This research
utilizes hierarchical cluster analyses using Wardâs method to sort artifacts of each
individual type into groups based on morphological similarity. The cluster analyses are
first run on each artifact type within each cache to determine the number of clusters that
emerge per assemblage. Then, the total number of artifacts within each type are analyzed
to determine how the artifacts cluster independently of their cache association. The
research also separates cluster analyses that are run on size variables (usually length,
width, thickness, and (L*W*T)/1000) from those that are run on shape variables (usually
the length/width and width/thickness ratios). Then, this section examines clusters that
are derived from a combination of the size and shape factor scores.
Finally, the East Wenatchee site offers the opportunity to study cached Clovis
tools based on their in situ provenience. The null hypothesis is that the positioning of the
artifacts in their context is not related to their morphological similarities. On the other
hand, comparing the arrangement of the artifacts with the statistical clusters based on
artifact measurements could demonstrate a purposeful sorting of the artifacts within their
context. The final portion of this section examines this possibility.
Different variables can measure different aspects of the tools under study. The
majority of the variables provide measurements based on size. A few others, particularly
ratio variables such as width/thickness, measure aspects of shape. The factor analysis
provides a method for determining which measurable variables correspond to the

54

âimpliedâ variables of size and shape. Table 32 categorizes the variables based on the
results of the factor analysis.

Cluster Analyses Based on Size
For the overall category of size, variables that contribute to the cluster analysis
vary depending on the type of artifacts being analyzed and on the site from which they
are excavated. To begin, I analyze the different artifact types from each site
independently and compare the results, with particular emphasis on the East Wenatchee
artifacts as they compare to their proveniences within the cache. The next step is to
analyze the different artifact types between caches and observe any patterns in the
clusters. The null hypothesis is that the artifacts will cluster independently of the site to
which they belong.
In order to determine the number of clusters for each set of variables, I create
charts based on the agglomeration values that result from the cluster analysis. The cluster
analysis progresses through stages, with each stage increasing the number of possible
clusters until all specimens are grouped apart. Each stage contains an agglomeration
value. This value decreases with each stage, but the decreases become less substantial
towards the final stages. In an ideal situation, there will be one stage at which the

55

agglomeration value dives to a level that is lower than expected. Counting the number of
stages at the end of the dive provides the most suitable number of clusters for the data.

East Wenatchee
For the East Wenatchee site, I analyze fluted points, bifaces, blades, and bone
rods. The cluster analysis could not apply to the flakes because of their lack of applicable
variables and of accurate weight measurements. In applying the analysis, I use a
hierarchical cluster analysis and standardize the variables using z-scores.
The East Wenatchee fluted points have the most variables available for the cluster
analysis, which consists of maximum length, mid-length width, maximum thickness,
maximum basal depth, weight, and (L*W*T)/1000. The results show that fluted points
form two size clusters, which may further subdivide into four or five minor clusters,
although one of them consists of a solitary outlier. However, the two large clusters
appear to be very significant based on the agglomeration table, and an examination of
photos and casts of the fluted points proves that the artifacts do separate into two distinct
size categories (Figure 9).
The bifaces cannot be clustered using quite as many variables as the fluted points.
Instead, the analysis leaves out basal depth and focuses on maximum length, mid-length
width, maximum thickness, weight, and (L*W*T)/1000. The results suggest that five
size clusters are apparent in the East Wenatchee biface data (Figure 10). However, two
of these clusters consist of only two bifaces.

The East Wenatchee cache consists of only six valid blades that can be applied to
a cluster analysis. Similar to bifaces, variables for blades consist of maximum length,
maximum width, maximum thickness, weight, and (L*W*T)/1000. The blades cluster
into two groups, one with four members, and the other with two (Figure 11). However,
the small sample size calls the validity of these clusters into question.
The twelve bone rods from the East Wenatchee cache are also analyzed based on
maximum length, maximum width, maximum thickness, weight, and (L*W*T)/1000.
They cluster easily into three groups, although one group is made up of only one
anomalous bone rod (WSHS #1992.24.47), probably the same outlier that appears in the
descriptive statistics (Figure 12).

Anzick
The Anzick cache contains basically the same artifact types as East Wenatchee
(minus the blades), but Anzick has a much greater number of bifaces with fewer fluted
points and bone rods.1
The seven fluted points from the Anzick cache can be analyzed using the same
size variables as those from East Wenatchee: maximum length, mid-length width,
maximum thickness, maximum basal depth, weight, and (L*W*T)/1000. Unlike the East
Wenatchee fluted points, the Anzick analysis reveals four subtle clusters (Figure 13).
The small sample size probably plays a role in the lack of more obvious clusters.

Because the East Wenatchee site has not been fully excavated, comparisons of artifact counts with other
caches are tentative.

The 63 measurable bifaces from the Anzick cache provide a much larger sample
for a cluster analysis. The size variables used in this cluster analysis include maximum
length, mid-length width, maximum thickness, weight, and (L*W*T)/1000. The
coefficients on the agglomeration table indicate that the Anzick bifaces form six clusters
based on size (Figure 14). The results are comparable to the four clusters from the East
Wenatchee bifaces, given that Anzick has a considerably larger sample size.
Generating size clusters for the bone rods from Anzick faces the same problem as
the fluted points and the flakes: only seven bone rods belong to the Anzick assemblage.
The size variables for the bone rods include maximum length, maximum width,
thickness, weight, and (L*W*T)/1000. As expected, the analysis suggests only two
clusters, with any further separation being indistinct (Figure 15). The results may

60

compare to the bone rod clusters from East Wenatchee, excluding East Wenatcheeâs
anomalous bone rod outlier. However, the Anzick bone rod clusters are more likely
arbitrary.

Simon
Unlike East Wenatchee and Anzick, the Simon cache consists entirely of fluted
points and bifaces. The cache is similar to Anzick though, in that the fluted points are
underrepresented compared to the bifaces. The Simon cache contains 28 bifaces but only
five fluted points.
The cluster analysis for the fluted points based on size suggests that two clusters
exist (Figure 16). Illustrations of the points also portray two distinct size groups.
Kohntoppâs (2001) thesis does not include as many measurement variables as the sources
for the East Wenatchee and Anzick fluted points, so the cluster analysis may be less

62

accurate. Kohntoppâs measurements include maximum length, width, thickness, and
(L*W*T)/1000, but not weight.

The bifaces from the Simon cache are much more numerous, with 26 measurable
specimens and 28 in total. Using the same variables as the fluted points, the size analysis
divides the bifaces into six clusters (Figure 17). The Simon bifaces are neatly grouped
according to the agglomeration table, so the six size clusters appear to be valid.

Fenn
Similar to the Simon cache, the Fenn cache is primarily made up of fluted points
and bifaces. However, unlike the Simon cache, Fenn contains nearly as many fluted
points as bifaces. Therefore, a comparison between clusters among fluted points and
bifaces within one cache is possible. The variables used in both artifact types include
maximum length, width, thickness, weight, and (L*W*T)/1000.
All 21 fluted points from the Fenn cache have valid measurements for cluster
analyses. The results indicate that four size clusters are present in the fluted points
(Figure 18). However, two clusters make up the bulk of the fluted points; while the next
only has two members, and the last cluster is a single outlying fluted point.

The 33 bifaces from the Fenn cache do not cluster as specifically as the fluted
points, but the analysis shows that four size clusters appear to be present (Figure 19).
Because they are usually the most numerous artifacts in a cache site, bifaces tend to form
the most clusters. However, the Fenn cache shows that fluted points can form as many
size clusters given a high sample size.

Cluster Analyses for Size â All Sites
An overall cluster analysis of artifact totals for each type provides an
understanding of the general trends within the data set. The hypothesis is that the artifact
types form size clusters that are divided by site. This hypothesis would suggest that
although each cache utilizes the same âClovisâ technology, the differences in size
indicate differences in caching purpose, cultural preferences, raw material utilization,
and/or flintknapping skills.
Fluted points are the most potentially useful indicators of differences among
caches, as they represent the finished form of a meticulously created stone tool. The
drawback to the fluted points is that not every cache has the same sample size. East

66

Wenatchee and Fenn have relatively large samples compared to the sparseness of fluted
points from Anzick and Simon.
The 47 valid fluted points fall into three obvious size clusters (Figures 20 and 21).
The East Wenatchee points tend to cluster together almost exclusively, which is expected
due to their excessively large size. Another cluster consists mostly of Fenn and Anzick
points, and the third is a combination of all caches (although Fenn is underrepresented).

The next artifact type that can be measured in a total size cluster analysis is
bifaces. Although bifaces have much more variation in their measurements than fluted
points, they are ubiquitous in every cache site. Their constant presence and large sample
size makes bifaces ideal for statistical analyses.
The bifaces form seven clusters, based on the agglomeration values (Figures 22
and 23). However, two of these clusters are particularly small considering the sample
size of 141 valid artifacts. One cluster is made up of four bifaces (two from Simon and
two from Fenn) and the other cluster consists of one solitary biface from the Simon
cache. The other clusters generally divide between Anzick and Fenn, although some
overlap is present.

Bone rods are not represented in every cache, but their presence shows a vital
aspect of Clovis technology. Therefore, the rods from the East Wenatchee and Anzick
caches deserve to be studied in a cluster analysis. The bone rods form three or four size
clusters based on the agglomeration values and dendrogram (Figures 24 and 25). The
most notable aspect of these clusters, however, is that they are divided almost perfectly
by site. The only exception is the East Wenatchee outlier, which is more closely related
to the Anzick rods than to those from its own cache.

Conclusions on the Cluster Analyses for Size
The size analyses on artifacts from individual sites are often fraught with
problems of sample size. With the exception of the Fenn fluted points, bifaces are the
only reliable artifact type for performing site-specific size analyses. Based on the biface
data, each site tends to have five or six size clusters.
The overall cluster analysis for artifact size suggests that certain caches tend to
dominate certain artifact types. For fluted points, the East Wenatchee specimens stand

72

out in particular. For bifaces, the artifacts tend to cluster around either the Anzick or
Fenn assemblages. Bone rods are distinctly divided according to site, but the fact that
they are only present in two of the caches precludes any further conclusions.

Cluster Analyses Based on Shape

Although the same SPSS procedures can perform the cluster analyses on shape
variables as they did on size, selecting the appropriate variables to determine shape is a
challenge within itself. The factor analysis shows that length, width, thickness, and
(L*W*T)/1000 are consistently useful in determining size for all artifact types. However,
the variables that determine shape vary according to artifact type. Moreover, some
artifact types have a more defined shape component without rotation, while others must
be rotated before the shape variables stand out. As such, each artifact type from each site
is analyzed according to the shape component, but the shape component is defined
differently for each type.

East Wenatchee
To analyze the shape of the fluted points from each Wenatchee, the
width/thickness ratio, length/width ratio, and thickness are the selected variables. No
rotation was necessary for the selection of these variables. Unlike the cluster analysis for
the size of East Wenatcheeâs fluted points, the shape analysis does not provide a
definitive number of clusters. A wide variety of clustering possibilities seem possible

73

when analyzing their shape (Figure 26). Unfortunately, the lack of an obvious cutoff
point prevents the determination of an appropriate number of clusters.

The bifaces from East Wentachee utilize the same variables as the fluted points,
just in a different order: length/width ratio, width/thickness ratio, and thickness. The
components were not rotated to determine these shape variables. The East Wenatchee
bifaces cluster much more easily than the fluted points and reveal five shape clusters
(Figure 27). These shape clusters are similar to, but not exactly the same as, the five
biface size clusters. For example, one noticeable outlier appears in the shape analysis,

74

WSHS #1992.24.38. The same biface was not segregated to such a degree in the size
analysis.

The blades from East Wenatchee are one of two artifact types that require rotation
for the factor analysis results to be interpretable. The variables used in clustering the
blade data for shape are length/width ratio, width/thickness ratio, and length. The blades
cluster very differently for shape than for size. While size appears to have no blade
clusters, shape has four (Figure 28). Of course, the tiny sample size fails to verify these
clusters.

The bone rod components did not need to be rotated for their shape analysis. The
variables used to determine shape in bone rods are width/thickness ratio, length/width
ratio, and width. The bone rods form four clusters, but they are not as well defined as the
three size clusters (Figure 29). The outlier does not have as large an effect on the shape
data.

Anzick
The fluted points from the Anzick cache are not numerous, but they do form
about four clusters (Figure 30). The results are remarkably similar to the size analysis.
Anzickâs bifaces are the most numerous of any artifact type from any cache, so
these data are a useful tool for examining the difference between the size and shape of
these artifacts. The data reveal five shape clusters for the Anzick bifaces, which is
similar to but not quite the same as the size analysis (Figure 31). The change in the
agglomeration values is more subtle for shape.

Bone rods from Anzick are less numerous and smaller than those from East
Wenatchee, but their shape analysis reveals two possible clusters among them (Figure
32). The bone rods seem to cluster similarly among themselves in both Anzick and East
Wenatchee. These shape results are also the same as the size data for Anzickâs bone
rods.

Simon
The fluted points from Simon have the smallest sample size for this artifact type,
but they appear to form three shape clusters (Figure 33). These results are quite different

79

from the fluted pointsâ size analysis, which reveals no significant clusters. However, the
sample size probably makes this distinction appear more dramatic than it actually is.

The bifaces from the Simon cache are much more numerous and can be used to
check the results of the shape analysis of the fluted points. The cluster analysis for shape
reveals a gently sloping agglomeration curve, with four clusters being the best cutoff
point (Figure 34). The size analysis reveals six clusters for the Simon bifaces.
Interestingly, these results are counter to those implied by the fluted point assemblage.
The fluted points seem to be homogenous in size but more varied in shape, but the
bifaces have more size clusters than shape clusters. Because the Simon cache has been

80

interpreted as a collection of artifacts from all stages of bifacial reduction (Kohntopp
2001), the bifaces are likely to be more varied in size than in shape.

Fenn
The numerous fluted points from the Fenn cache make it an excellent collection
for comparing the size and shape differences for Clovis points within one site. Similar to
the size clusters, the shape analysis for the Fenn fluted points yields four clusters (Figure
35). These clusters are more evenly dispersed than the size analysis, although one cluster
is made up of only one aberrant point.

81

The shape analysis for the Fenn bifaces is open to interpretation. A lumper would
suggest that three clusters are present, while a splitter may say there are five (Figure 36).
Regardless of the specific interpretation of the data, the number of shape clusters is
comparable to the number of size clusters for the same artifacts. The shape clusters are
less neatly divided, however.

Cluster Analyses for Shape â All Sites
While a site-by-site distinction appears to be valid in terms of artifact size, the
question remains as to whether this interpretation holds true for artifactsâ shapes. Among
fluted points and bone rods, shape seems to be a defining factor, so hypothetical clusters
for the shape of these artifacts should not be divided by site. Bifaces, on the other hand,
should exhibit more variability. If bifaces cluster by shape according to their respective
sites, it could imply that the toolmakers for each cache utilized different reduction
strategies to arrive at similar technological results.
Fluted points fall into about four clusters for shape, although the cutoff point for
determining the number of clusters is not certain (Figures 37 and 38). Given that four

83

clusters are present, the first two show a dominance of fluted points from the Fenn cache,
while the last two are dominated by the East Wenatchee points. The Anzick and Simon
points, being smaller in number, are more difficult to determine. The trend appears to be
that the shape of the Anzick points corresponds more closely to the Fenn clusters, and the
Simon pointsâ shapes are more related to the East Wenatchee clusters.

85

Being more numerous and statistically variable, bifaces may either elucidate or
confuse the data from the analysis of fluted point shape. The biface data yield as many as
nine clusters, making the analysis much more complicated than for the fluted points
(Figures 39 and 40). The biface shape data do not seem to cluster according to site,
although several bifaces from the Fenn cache do cluster closely together.

Finally, the bone rods from the East Wenatchee and Anzick caches remain to be
analyzed by shape. The shape data cluster more obviously into three groups than the size
data, but the makeup of the clusters is exactly the same (Figures 41 and 42). With the
exception of the outlier, the East Wenatchee bone rods cluster exclusively among
themselves (forming the first cluster), and the Anzick rods form two exclusive clusters.
Especially when combined with the size cluster analysis, the shape analysis shows that
significant differences exist among the bone rods from the two sites.

Conclusions on the Cluster Analyses for Shape
In terms of the site-by-site artifact analysis, the shape clusters are often fairly
similar to the size clusters. These results are to be expected when the sample is small,
such as the fluted point data from Anzick or Simon, but these similarities also affected
the biface data as well.
The shape analysis for the overall artifact type does yield results that are different
from the shape analysis, however. The dichotomy between the East Wenatchee and Fenn

89

fluted points is more obvious in the shape data, while the biface shapes do not seem to
divide at all according to site. The exception to these results is the bone rod data, whose
striking similarity to the size data deserves explanation. The reason for this difference is
most likely the difference in bone preservation between sites. The bone rod outlier from
East Wenatchee is most likely broken or in a more deteriorated state than the other rods.
The Anzick bone rods may be in similar states of breakage or decay.

Cluster Analyses for Size and Shape, All Sites

The final cluster analyses involve comparing both the sizes and the shapes of each
artifact type with each other. The factor analysis function in SPSS allows one to save the
results of the analysis as variables. These variables are then applicable to the cluster
analysis. For the most part, these cluster analyses are far simpler than those utilized
before. Only two factors were revealed in most artifact types, so simple scatterplots can
portray the data as easily as the mathematical analysis.
For fluted points, the numerical data reveal four clusters. The scatterplot also
shows that four clusters exist, although one of those clusters is made up of one outlying
point from the Anzick cache (Figure 43). The most notable aspect of the analysis is that
the artifacts appear to cluster according to size but not shape. On the plot, the clusters
only exist along the x-axis. Therefore, shape does not vary across the caches, but size
certainly does. The cluster of the smallest fluted points consists primarily of Anzick and
Fenn artifacts, the central cluster is made up of mostly East Wenatchee and Simon points,
while the cluster with the largest points belongs almost entirely to East Wenatchee.

For the size and shape analysis of bifaces, the clusters are not as obvious. Two
separate cluster analyses are run on the bifaces, with the first including only the size and
shape factors, and the following analysis includes the third, more questionable factor.
With the analysis of the first two factors, the numerical data suggest that five indistinct
clusters exist. With the third factor included, the results become more vague, and it
appears that up to nine clusters are present. The scatterplot for the two-factor cluster
analysis shows that the bifaces form a roughly homogenous group, although different
caches exhibit different trends (Figure 44). East Wenatchee has the most uniform biface
collection, with the artifacts clustered in the center of the points. The Fenn bifaces are
only slightly more variable than East Wenatchee. However, the Anzick and Simon

91

bifaces have a wide range of size and shape, and nearly all of the outlying points belong
to either of these caches. The differences in these biface distributions may reflect cultural
or utilitarian differences between the caches. The caches that have an abundance of
fluted points (East Wenatchee and Fenn) also have bifaces of homogenous size and
shape. On the other hand, caches that have few fluted points (Anzick and Simon) have
bifaces of many sizes and shapes that relate to their reduction sequence (Kohntopp 2001).

The bone rod size and shape data from the East Wenatchee and Anzick sites form

exclusively according to site (Figure 45). The third and smallest cluster contains three

92

rods (one from East Wenatchee and two from Anzick) that do not match with their
corresponding sites. The anomalous East Wenatchee rod more closely resembles most of
the Anzick rods in terms of size but not shape. The two outlying Anzick rods are close to
East Wentacheeâs size characteristics but with a vastly different shape. Within the
outlying cluster, the rodsâ shapes are fairly similar, but the East Wenatchee rod is
considerably smaller in size than Anzickâs two outliers.

Figure 45: Scatterplot of all bone rods by size (x-axis) and shape (y-axis).

Interestingly, the bone rods appear to be related to fluted points based on count
data. A total of 14 bone rods (12 of which have been measured) have been found at East
Wenatchee, and 8 rods are present in the Anzick cache. Perhaps coincidentally, there are

93

14 fluted points from East Wenatchee and 8 from Anzick. Also the size differences in
the bone rods may reflect the fact that East Wenatchee has the largest fluted points out of
all the caches, while Anzick has the smallest.
In sum, the cluster analyses of size and shape characteristics from the East
Wenatchee, Anzick, Simon, and Fenn caches show that statistical differences do exist
among their respective artifacts. For fluted points, size is an important distinguishing
characteristic. For bifaces, the overall variability provides a contrast among the caches.
Both size and shape play a role in distinguishing bone rods, although preservation factors
must be taken into account. Lastly, the sample size for each artifact type per cache is
telling. East Wenatchee and Fenn have a proportionately large number of fluted points
compared to bifaces, and these caches also hold a few other lithic tools, such as blades.
Anzick and Simon, on the other hand, represent caches that are almost strictly bifacial,
with proportionately few fluted points, and no additional lithic tools.
Overall, three different kinds of groupings are available. The count data on the
fluted points and bifaces suggest that the sites group into caches of finished tools (East
Wenatchee and Fenn) and caches that represent production sequences (Anzick and
Simon). The cluster analyses of the bifaces support this distinction as well, but the
analyses of the fluted points do not. According to the fluted point size data, East
Wenatchee and Simon form one loosely defined group of large fluted points, and Anzick
and Fenn are a group that is dominated by smaller points. Finally, the presence or
absence of bone rods could be another grouping factor. Of course, the size and shape
data between the East Wenatchee and Anzickâs bone rods are so different that it seems
premature to group them together based simply on the artifactsâ presence.

East Wenatchee Clusters and Proveniences

One unique aspect of the East Wenatchee cache is that the majority of the artifacts
were excavated in situ. None of the other cache sites in this study have recorded
proveniences. Therefore, one can analyze the clusters of the artifactsâ measurements and
compare the results to the artifactsâ proveniences. Unfortunately, the records of the exact
proveniences for many of the artifacts have become lost over time. Bonnichsen et alâs
(1995) database provides some proveniences, but the majority of the fluted points and
bifaces still lack accurate data. Instead of using the database, I consult Gramlyâs
(1993:25) plan view map of the cache site (Figure 46). The map portrays 36 of the East
Wenatchee artifacts in their original positions. The map also illustrates the first 24
artifacts that the orchard workers uncovered in 1987, but their proveniences are
undeterminable. I obtain the proveniences from Gramlyâs map by measuring the
midpoint of each artifact and then calculating the northing and westing of the midpoint by
measuring it against the walls of the excavation unit. One fact to bear in mind is that
Gramlyâs plan view is upside down: the north wall is at the bottom and the south wall is
at the top of the map.
Having obtained the proveniences for all the illustrated artifacts, the specimens
must also be linked to the Washington State Historical Societyâs catalog numbers. The
numbering system on Gramlyâs plan view map lists the artifacts in spatial order, but these
numbers are unrelated to any of the cataloging systems. Fortunately, the Washington
State Historical Society managed to match the catalog numbers to the artifact illustrations

95

on Gramlyâs map. Therefore, a comparison of the mathematical artifact clusters to their
original positions is possible.

Figure 46: Plan view of Richey Clovis Cache (Feature 1), East Wenatchee Clovis site (Gramly 1993:25).

For fluted points from East Wenatchee, the separate cluster analyses of size and
shape are sketchy at best. However, a cluster analysis using the factor scores for size and
shape works well. The results of the statistical analysis for the 14 fluted points provide
four clusters.
Gramlyâs plan view map does not include the proveniences for all the East
Wenatchee artifacts because 24 of them were removed by the orchard workers prior to
archaeological investigations. Of the 14 fluted points, eight of them have recorded
proveniences. They form three clusters, and the following table (Table 33) compares
these statistical and spatial clusters.

The statistical clusters match fairly closely to the provenience clusters.
Comparing the two cluster sets reveals that only two fluted points cluster differently by
provenience and by size and shape. However, one must keep in mind that those two
fluted points make up 25% of the sample size for the provenience clusters.
For the sake of continuity, the bifaces are also clustered statistically according to
their size and shape factor scores. The cluster analysis reveals four clusters. Gramlyâs
plan view map includes eight bifaces that are in situ, and they form three clusters. Table
34 is the result of comparing of these two cluster sets.

Unlike the fluted points, the provenience clusters for the bifaces do not match the
measurement clusters at all. One interpretation may be that each provenience cluster
consists of a variety of bifaces that may have served different purposes.

97

Finally, the bone rods have consistently clustered the same way according to both
size and shape, so the combined cluster analysis has the three expected clusters.
Additionally, eight of the bone rods have known proveniences according to Gramlyâs
map, and these proveniences form three clusters as well. Table 35 compares these cluster
sets.

Based on these data, no continuity is evident between clusters based on
measurements and clusters based on provenience for bone rods. Gramly (2004, 1993)
states that gnaw marks are present on most of the bone rods, so biogenic disturbances
may have shifted the rods out of their original positions.
To conclude, comparing statistical clusters to provenience clusters yields positive results
only for the fluted points. The overall picture of the plan view map shows that fluted
points, bifaces, and bone rods are grouped somewhat separately. The fluted points lie
primarily in the northwest corner and in the west wall of unit N104W101. The bone rods
are tightly grouped in the south portion of unit N104W101. The bifaces are the most
scattered of the artifacts, and they are often mixed with the fluted points or the bone rods.
A small, nearly exclusive cluster of three bifaces and one fluted point lies near the west
wall of N104W100. If the fluted points were grouped in the cache based on size and
shape characteristics, it is possible that bioturbation accounts for the lack of order among

98

the bone rods and bifaces. Assuming that mammals dug into the site and gnawed on the
bone rods, it is likely that the positions of the rods and some of the bifaces near the rods
changed. The fluted points are far enough from the bone rods to remain unaffected.

99

CORRESPONDENCE ANALYSES

Correspondence analysis is a statistical method that can compare assemblages
from different sites on the basis of artifact counts. Archaeologists have used this method
in previous studies as a seriation technique to sort the proportions of artifact types into a
chronological scale (Kendall 1970). In this study, I use correspondence analysis to
arrange infer artifact proportions on a geographical scale. In other words, the closer two
cache sites are located to each other, then the more similar the types and amount of
artifacts should be among the assemblages.
Each permutation of the following correspondence analyses is run twice. The
first run includes the data from the four cache sites from this study. The subsequent run
includes the four caches, plus up to five additional Clovis caches that have available
count data. The five additional caches are as follows:
The Drake cache is from north central Colorado and was found by Orvil Drake in
1978. It consists of 13 fluted points and one hammerstone. Additionally, small pieces of
ivory are associated with the points, but the fragments are too small to yield any
definitive cultural information (Stanford and Jodry 1988).
The Crook County cache from northeastern Wyoming contains two fluted points
and seven bifaces. Harold Erickson originally uncovered it in 1963 during an oil and gas
exploration. According to Tankersleyâs account, Erickson states that the cache was
buried in a pit of red ochre and also held two possible bone foreshafts, whose
whereabouts today are unknown (2002).

100

The Keven Davis cache is apparently a different kind of Clovis cache, as this
assemblage consists entirely of 14 blades from north-central Texas. Keven Davis
discovered the cache in 1988 while surveying (Collins 1999).
The Busse cache from northwestern Kansas was found in 1968 by Dan Busse. It
is made up of 13 bifaces, 25 blades, 50 flakes, a jasper cobble, and an abrader (Hofman
1995).
Another blade assemblage, the Green cache was found at Blackwater Draw, New
Mexico in 1963 during a gravel mining operation. F. E. Green reports on the 17 blades
and assigns them as Clovis tools (1963).

How It Works

One purpose of correspondence analysis is to explore the relationships between
the rows and the columns on a two-way table. The method can compress the data from
the table so that it can be expressed in a graph of lower dimensions (usually two or three,
with each axis representing a dimension). Therefore, instead of imagining a graph in
which each variable of a row or column represents a dimension, the correspondence
analysis compresses the data so that all the variables on a row or column become a single
dimension. Naturally, some data may be lost in this process. Each dimension in a
correspondence analysis has an inertia value that provides a value describing the
percentage of data accounted for by that dimension. Adding those inertia values together
provides a cumulative inertia value for the entire graph (StatSoft 2003). This research
utilizes the correspondence analysis program in Statistica 6.

101

Results

The first correspondence analysis is a plot of the six tool types and the four
sample Clovis caches (Figure 47). Tool types located close to the origin (0,0) represent
categories that are found in all or most caches, and caches plotted near the origin are
assemblages that contain a large quantity of these ubiquitous tools and few or none of the
more extraneous types.

Figure 47: Correspondence analysis results displaying the four sample caches and their relation to six
artifact types based on count data.

102

This correspondence analysis shows that fluted point and biface types are closest
to the origin point. The Anzick and Simon caches cluster closely around the biface
category, and Fenn is closest to the fluted point category. One might expect Anzick to be
situated closer to the bone rod category, but the cache has an overwhelming number of
bifaces. Fenn has the most fluted points of the four caches, so it is naturally closest to
this category. The miscellaneous âotherâ category is an outlier, but it does pull Fenn
away slightly from the fluted points because the cache contains one miscellaneous artifact
(a crescent). Finally, East Wenatchee is surrounded by the bone rod, blade, and flake
categories. Although East Wenatchee has a substantial number of fluted points, it has the
most bone rods, blades, and flakes out of the four sample caches. The fact that East
Wenatchee has 63 flakes (nearly ten times as many as the other caches) explains why the
cache does not lie close to the origin. The high number of flakes may be the result of a
sampling bias, as East Wenatchee is the only site in the sample that underwent an
archaeological excavation.
The next correspondence analysis uses the same artifact types but adds artifact
counts from the five additional Clovis caches (Figure 48). The caches and artifact types
form three general groups. The first group is blade-dominated, with the Green and Keven
Davis caches. This artifact type and these caches are the most outlying of the plots. The
next group is flake-dominated, with East Wenatchee and Busse. Although these caches
have substantial amounts of other artifact types, they have far more flakes that the rest of
the Clovis caches. Finally, the fluted point and biface-dominated caches are Anzick,
Simon, Fenn, Drake, and Crook County. With the exception of Anzick, these caches can
be noted by their absence of other artifact types rather than the presence of fluted points

103

and bifaces. The bone rod and âotherâ categories are situated in between the flakedominated and the fluted point and biface-dominated groups. This occurrence is due to
the fact that one or more caches from each group contains either bone rods or
miscellaneous artifacts.

Figure 48: Correspondence analysis results displaying nine Clovis caches and their relation to six artifact
types based on count data.

Two more correspondence analyses compare four original and seven total cache
assemblages after removal of the blade and flake variables. First, the analysis of the four
sample caches reveals three groups: fluted point-dominated, biface-dominated, and bone
rod-dominated caches (Figure 49). Fenn represents the fluted point-dominated

104

assemblage, although it is pulled somewhat by its substantial biface assemblage and the
crescent. Anzick and Simon, the biface-dominated assemblages, are grouped closely
with the biface artifact type. East Wenatchee is the bone rod-dominated assemblage,
although the fluted point type pulls the cache closer to the center.

Figure 49: Correspondence analysis results displaying the four sample caches and their relation to four
artifact types based on count data (blade and flake data are removed).

The second analysis adds the Drake, Crook County, and Busse caches (Figure
50). The Keven Davis and Green caches were left out because they are strictly blade
assemblages. The layout of the original caches does not change much, except Fenn is
now located halfway between the fluted point and biface types. Drake is a fluted point-

105

dominated cache, and it pulls the variable away from Fenn due to the fact that Drake
consists almost entirely of fluted points. Crook County and Busse are grouped with the
biface-dominated caches but not as tightly as Anzick and Simon.

types based on count data (blade and flake data are removed).

GEOARCHAEOLOGY OF THE CACHE SITES

Overview

The locations of the known cache sites in this study lie just to the east and to the
west of the Rocky Mountains. The East Wenatchee, Anzick, and Simon sites are located
in intermontane river basins. The theoretical location of the Fenn cache is also an
intermontane basin. For East Wenatchee and Anzick, mountains border the prairies to
the east and west. For Simon and Fenn, mountains run along the north and the south.
Eryeâs (1968) vegetation map places Fenn in a sagebrush/chaparral zone, while the three
other caches are located in prairies.

East Wenatchee
For the area surrounding the East Wenatchee site, the most notable geographic
feature is the Channeled Scablands. This landform lies in between the Cascade and
Rocky Mountains and consists of a basalt-dominated drainage basin that retains large
flood ripples from the melting of the ice sheets at the end of the Pleistocene (Rosenfeld
1979). During the last glacial maximum (18,000 to 20,000 years ago), the Cordilleran Ice
Sheet expanded into Washington, Idaho, and Montana in the form of several lobes. One
of these lobes, the Purcell lobe, blocked the Clark Fork River, creating a natural dam to
form Glacial Lake Missoula. By Clovis times, the lake had filled enough to spill over the
Purcell Lobeâs dam, and the ice was quickly swept away. Over a matter of weeks, all of
Glacial Lake Missoula poured through eastern Washington and scoured the land, leaving

107

giant ripple marks in its wake (Booth et al. 2004:35-38). When J. Harlen Bretz proposed
this scenario in the early twentieth century, most geologists refused to accept such an
endorsement of catastrophism. However, evidence for such floods was found in
numerous locations in eastern Washington, and the discovery of deposits left by Glacial
Lake Missoula in Montana confirmed the existence of a source for the flooding (Booth et
al. 2004:35-36).
An additional natural disaster affected the area of East Wenatchee just prior to the
Clovis occupation at East Wenatchee. In studying the geology of the site, Mehringer and
Foit (1990) note the presence of Glacier Peak tephra from about 11,250 radiocarbon years
B.P. in the stratigraphy. Moreover, the researchers state that the tephra is apparent in a
siliceous crust that appears on the undersides of the artifacts. The fact that the crust
appears only on the bottom of the artifacts and not on top indicates that the cache was left
just after the Glacier Peak eruption (Mehringer and Foit 1990).
The climatic conditions in the area indicate that the Cascade Mountains tend to
create a rain shadow over the eastern portion of Washington state (Lahey 1979).
According to Frenkel (1979), the modern vegetation in the region is dominated by big
sagebrush (Artemisia tridentate).

Anzick
According to Scott Jonesâ MA thesis (1997), the Anzick site lies within the Crazy
Mountain Basin located between the Bridger Mountains to the west and the Crazy
Mountains to the east. The Crazy Mountain Basin is underlain by the Livingston
Formation, a sandstone bedrock structure from which the Anzick outcrop is derived

108

(Jones 1997). Lahren and Bonnichsen (1974) state that the sandstone outcrop is a
collapsed rock shelter, and the Anzick cache was buried with human remains beneath this
shelter. Baileyâs (1976) ecoregions map places the Anzick site within the foothills
prairie, a narrow band of Agropyron, Festuca, and Stipa grassland that runs along the
eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains. To the west of this region is douglas fir and
western spruce-fir forests, and to the east are Bouteloua, Stipa, and Agropyron grassland
interspersed with eastern ponderosa forests (Bailey 1976).

Simon
The immediate area surrounding the Simon cache site is the Big Camas prairie, an
eastwardly elongated plain that follows Camas Creek. The Big Camas prairie is bordered
on the north by the Soldier and Smoky Mountains and on the south by the Mount Bennett
Hills (Butler 1963). This area has been accumulating fluvial deposits since the mid to
late Pleistocene and is underlain by igneous bedrock at a depth of 150 to 300 meters. The
Simon artifacts came from yellow alluvium a mile east of Deer Creek (Butler 1963).
This region experiences warmer and drier winters than most of the northwestern United
States due to the position of the Sierra Nevada range (Lahey 1979). Like the East
Wenatchee site, the modern vegetation surrounding the Simon cache site is Artemisia
tridentate. However, this area is closely bordered on the north by Pinus ponderosa,
Abies grandis, and Pseudotsuga menziesii forests (Frenkel 1979). It is worth noting that
the Big Camas Prairie is historically known as an important locality for gathering camas
and was utilized by various Native American tribes until the latter part of the 19th century
(Butler 1963).

109

Fenn
Based on Frisonâs (1991) hypothesis that the Fenn cache is from the borders of
Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado; the Green River Basin, particularly near Flaming Gorge
Reservoir, is a reasonable hypothetical location for this cache. The Flaming Gorge is
located on the eastern edge of the Great Basin and would have lied east of Lake
Bonneville in Pleistocene times (Cressman 1977). The border of the Great Basin is a
likely location for the Fenn cache site due to the fact that a crescent (typical of Western
Stemmed technology in the Great Basin) is present along with the Clovis artifacts. The
northern portion of the gorge is a sagebrush steppe, while the southern part runs into a
juniper and pinyon forest (Bailey 1976). Houghton (1976) states that elevation changes
in the Great Basin bring about dramatic changes in vegetation and precipitation. He
notes that for every 60-meter rise, precipitation increases by as much as 3 centimeters and
vegetation becomes more varied and forested (Houghton 1976: 24). Flaming Gorge cuts
into one of these elevation rises. One of the goals of this research is to determine whether
this area compares favorably to the contexts of the other cache sites.

Large-Scale Geomorphological Events

Glacial Lake Missoula and the Scabland Floods
Towards the end of the Pleistocene from 15,000 to 13,000 calendar years B.P.,
much of northern Idaho and Western Montana was covered in glacial ice and meltwater
lakes (Figure 51). Glacial Lake Missoula, the most of prominent of these lakes in the
region, grew to encompass an area of 7,510 square kilometers with a maximum depth of

110

610 meters and a water volume of 2,085 cubic kilometers, or half the volume of modern
Lake Michigan (Alt 2001:9). In Idaho, the Purcell Lobe extended southward from the
Cordilleran ice sheet along the Clark Fork River valley. The lobe dammed the river near
its present-day mouth at Pend Oreille Lake (USGS 1982). The combination of the
dammed Clark Fork River and the nearby Bitterroot Mountains enabled the massive
volume of Lake Missoula to accumulate.

Figure 51: Map of eastern Washington, northern Idaho, and western Montana showing the positions of the
continental ice sheets and the glacial lakes during the late Pleistocene (USGS 1982:8-9).

Additional river dams and glacial lakes formed in neighboring areas, as well. The
Okanogan Lobe extended southward into the path of the Columbia River, diverting it into
a channel along the Coulee Monocline. Between the Okanogan and Purcell Lobes, the
Colville Lobe blocked the path of the Spokane River, forming Glacial Lake Spokane.

111

Additionally, the moraines and kame terraces that these lobes left behind form the
boundaries of modern lakes such as Spirit Lake, Twin Lakes, Newman Lake, Hayden
Lake, Coeur dâAlene Lake, and Liberty Lake (USGS 1982).
Glacial Lake Missoula could grow up to 90% of the height of the Purcell Lobe.
Because the volume of ice is 10% less than water, the rising lake water eventually
became high enough to float the lobe. The floating lobe then easily broke into icebergs
and was swept away in the massive torrent of the draining lake. Afterwards, the Clark
Fork River flowed freely until the Purcell Lobe extended southward again, causing the
process to repeat itself (Alt 2001:25).
Like the remnants of glacial lakes found in Europe, Glacial Lake Missoula left
behind sequences of varves in the stratigraphic record (Figure 52). Varves are a series of
interbedded bands of sediments that accumulate according to a seasonal cycle. During
the summer, meltwater brought silty glacial sediments, called ârock flour,â into the lake.
This sediment was rich in nutrients and could support organic life such as algae.
However, the algae could not survive the winter climate, and the organic remains of the
algae accumulate on the lake bed during these colder months. In Montana, the
stratigraphic record for Glacial Lake Missoula shows 36 sequences of varves, each
separated by fluvial silt deposits (Alt 2001:27). This record indicates that the lake
formed and broke through the Purcell Lobe at least 36 times. Additional studies have
found that up 100 Missoula floods have taken place (Booth et al. 2004:36). Also, the
number of varve layers within each sequence decreased with every break. The earliest
varve sequence has 58 paired bands of sediment, and the last sequence has only nine (Alt
2001:29). Therefore, the draining of Lake Missoula occurred after a shorter filling

112

period, and with less volume, over time. If the volume of the floods had been increasing
with time, the stratigraphy would not have been preserved. This decrease in volume most
likely represents deglaciation at the end of the Pleistocene, as the Purcell Lobe became
smaller and more easily broken over time.

Figure 52: A roadcut along Highway 90, 20 miles west of Missoula, Montana. The pale bands are river
silts; the dark bands sequences of glacial lake sediments with varves (D. W. Hyndman photo from Alt
2001:26).

The East Wenatchee site lies along the western edge of the Channeled Scablands
in Washington state. This region bears the markings of multiple flood events caused by
the sudden draining of Glacial Lake Missoula. The bedrock in this area is made up of
columnar Miocene basalt which was covered by a thin veneer of loess prior to the floods
(USGS 1982). The columnar structure of this basalt is particularly susceptible to flood
erosion. Additionally, the drainage of Lake Missoula deposited large gravel beds across
the Channeled Scablands, particularly during the lakeâs more powerful early floods (Alt

113

2001:91, 95-96). Mehringer and Foit (1990:495) state that the scabland floods left
immense ripple marks across the landscape, with 100 m between crests.
Waitt and Atwater (1989) provide a description of the geomorphology of the East
Wenatchee area while participating in a field trip across the Channeled Scablands. Based
on several stops in and around the cache site (within 30 km), they construct a sequence of
flood events for the end of the Pleistocene. They state that Lake Missoula is not the only
source of floods in this portion of the scablands; later floods from Glacial Lake Columbia
and another extinct lake farther north in Canada may have also impacted this area.
Before the Okanogan Lobe of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet reached its maximum extent,
flood waters from Lake Columbia swept though the Wenatchee area through Moses
Coulee, about 20 km to the southeast of the cache. The late Pleistocene stratigraphy of
Moses Coulee consists of: 1) four beds of basalt pebbles and granules that thicken
southward and are interpreted as alluvial fans from Moses Coulee floods; 2) interbedded
sand and silt that represents slackwater from more distant Grand Coulee floods; and 3)
giant dunes of cobble gravels and boulders (1.5 m diameter) of Swakane gneiss from
farther up the valley. In the vicinity of the cache, a greater number of large gneiss
boulders are visible. 15 or more boulders are over 5 m in diameter, and one is 13 m. Due
to the fact that the maximum extent of glaciation was 52 km up the valley, giant floods
must have transported these boulders. The boulders can be found up to 40 m above the
modern level of the Columbia River. Surrounding the East Wenatchee site, giant dunes
cover the area and are capped by a mantle of loess. The crests of the dunes 160 m apart,
and boulders in this area are up to 0.5 m in diameter. Waitt and Atwater (1989) describe
this area as the âworldâs most colossal point bar.â The nearby Malaga gravel dunes show

114

signs of later flood activity, as they are not covered by loess nor the Glacier Peak tephra
of 11,250 B.P (Waitt and Atwater 1989:44-48).
In sum, the area surrounding East Wenatchee was mostly peripheral to the Lake
Missoula floods, but it did endure other floods from Glacial Lake Columbia, especially
before and after the maximum extent of the Okanogan Lobe. In particular, the flood that
immediately underlies the Glacier Peak tephra may have originated from the draining of
Lake Columbia. Additionally, two subsequent floods brought created more dunes and
brought additional boulders to the area. The source of these floods would have been a
later glacial lake from a contemporaneous glacial margin in Canada (Waitt and Atwater
1989:48).

Late Pleistocene Volcanic Eruptions
Glacier Peak is a dormant volcano in the northern Cascade mountain range,
northeast of Seattle and southeast of Mount Baker. Glacier Peak was highly active
during the late Pleistocene, and while it was originally thought to have erupted one to
three consecutive times, subsequent investigations have revealed that the volcano
underwent nine or more eruptions over a period of up to 1,500 years (Porter 1978:30, 37).
Most of these tephra layers are only distinguishable within 50 km of Glacier Peak.
However, three of the layers (G, M, and B, from oldest to youngest) extend beyond this
range (Figure 53). Layer G is found eastward past Idaho and into the Rocky Mountains
of Alberta and Montana. Layer B extends southeast through Idaho into the Montana and
Wyoming Rocky Mountains. Finally, the full extent of Layer M is unknown, but it is
found south of Glacier Peak, along the Cascade Range (Porter 1978:31-33).

115

and adjacent southwestern Canada. Remote localities of Layer G (solid circles) and Layer B (open circles)
from Lemke et al. (1975), Smith et al. (1977), and Westgate et al. (1970). Grain-size isopleths in
centimeters (Porter 1978:31).

Radiocarbon ages are associated with the most widespread tephra layers. The
first accepted age of Layer G is 12,750 Â± 350 radiocarbon years B.P., based on mollusk
shells found within the tephra in Montanaâs Diversion Lake (Porter 1978:37). However,
subsequent studies of Layer G at Sheep Mountain Bog, Montana, indicate that its age
may actually be closer to 11,200 B.P. (Mehringer et al. 1984). At Lost Trail Pass Bog in
the Bitterroot Moutains of Montana, Mehringer et al. (1977:351-352) approximate the
age of the Layer B tephra as 11,250 B.P., an average of two ages on organic sediment
with values of 11,200 Â± 100 below the tephra and 11,300 Â± 230 above it. However, it is
worth noting that this age encompasses two separate Glacier Peak eruptions that occurred
within a short span of time, probably less than 25 years of each other (Mehringer et al.

116

1977:366). Porter (1978:37) considers both of these consecutive eruptions to represent
Layer B.
Based on these radiocarbon ages and geographic distributions, Layer B appears to
be the most likely Glacier Peak tephra to underlie the Clovis artifacts at East Wenatchee.
However, Mehringer and Foit (1990:500) state that the glass chemistry of tephra samples
adhering to the bottoms of the artifacts is more similar to Layer G. This tehpra layer was
originally thought to be 1,500 years older than Layer B, pre-dating any accepted
radiocarbon age for Clovis technology (Porter 1978:37). However, Mehringer et al.
(1984) claim that all the Glacier Peak eruptions most likely occurred within decades of
each other and that statistical uncertainty can explain the discrepancies in the radiocarbon
ages. Additionally, Foit et al. (1993) demonstrate that Layers B and G have nearly
indistinguishable chemical signatures, so the true identity of the Glacier Peak tephra at
East Wenatchee may still be unknown.
The thickness of Layers B and G decrease rapidly with increasing distance from
Glacier Peak (Figures 54 and 55). Projections based on Porter (1978:33, 36) estimate that
the thickness of an intact Layer B at East Wenatchee would be less than 10 cm. An intact
Layer G at East Wenatchee would be less than 5 cm. Maximum particle thickness also
decreases over distance so that the largest Layer B and G particles at East Wenatchee
would be less than 2 cm in diameter (Porter 1978: 34).

Eruptions at Mount St. Helens appear to be contemporaneous to the Glacier Peak
eruptions. According to Sarna-Wojcicki et al. (1983), Mount St. Helensâ Layer S erupted
between 13,000 and 12,000 B.P. In eastern Washington, Layer S tephra is found
interbedded with the last Channeled Scablands flood deposits from the draining of Lake

119

Missoula. Next, Layer J erupted between 11,700 Â± 400 and 8,300 Â± 300 B.P. Its extent
is not well known, but it is present at Lind Coulee and was therefore most likely
deposited in the East Wenatchee area as well (Sarna-Wojcicki et al. 1983:65-66).
Finally, the Mazama tephra, although deposited much later than the Clovis period,
is an important marker bed for stratigraphic studies across the northwestern United States
(Figure 56). Mount Mazama, presently occupied by Crater Lake in Oregon, erupted
approximately 7,000 to 6,700 years ago. The volcano erupted as many as six times
within 3 to 200 years, and four of these deposits extend far beyond the crater. The
Mazama tephra, termed Layer O, has been noted in Oregon, Washington, northern
California, Idaho, western Montana, western Wyoming, and northern Utah (SarnaWojcicki et al. 1983:68-69). Because of its wide distribution, Layer O potentially
extends to all four of the Clovis cache sites in this study.

Pluvial Lakes and the Snake River Floods in Idaho
After the last glacial maximum, Lake Bonneville was located to the south of the
Simon cache and to the west of the probable location of the Fenn cache (Figure 57). The
largest of the pluvial lakes, Bonnevilleâs maximum extent covered most of western Utah
and extended slightly into southeast Idaho. It covered an area of 51,640 km2, had a
maximum depth of 335 m, and a water volume of 7,500 km3. The lake also contained
about 20 small islands (Smith and Street-Perrott 1983:194).

Figure 57: Map of Lake Bonneville and the path of its flood (Link et al. 1999:252).

The geological history of Lake Bonneville is complex because radiometric
procedures have often produced conflicting ages. Morrison (1965) wrote a well known
study of the Great Basinâs Quaternary geology, proposing that the late Pleistocene Lake

121

Bonneville formation is bracketed by two paleosols: the underlying Promontory soil and
the overlying Graniteville soil (Figure 58). His data are based on studies of eastern
Jordan Valley, southern Promontory Point, and the Oak City-Delta areas in Utah.
Throughout this formation, Lake Bonneville had two members (White Marl and the
Upper Member) where it reached a maximum shoreline level. The two members are
separated by a period in which Lake Bonneville appeared to evaporate completely before
refilling. The Upper Member reached a slightly higher water level than the White Marl
member, and Lake Bonneville overflowed its bank at Red Rock Pass in southeastern
Idaho. This overflow was the second of such events in the Pleistocene; the earlier
overflow occurred during a maximum water level at least 40,000 years ago. Each time,
the overflows caused catastrophic floods along the Snake River through Idaho and
Oregon (Morrison 1965:273-275). Morrisonâs (1965:276) estimation states that the
maximum extent of the Upper Member and the overflow at Red Rock Pass occurred
between 15,000 and 12,000 calendar years ago.

123

According to Link et al. (1999), a combination of a mesic Pleistocene climate and
occasional inflow of water from the Bear River (whose flow was often diverted by
volcanic activity) enabled the maximum filling of Lake Bonneville. Bear River became
permanently diverted into Lake Bonneville around 60,000 to 40,000 years ago. During
this time, Red Rock Pass was filled with Cambrian limestone overlain with Tertiary
sediments and alluvial fans from the Bannock and Portneuf mountain ranges. Lake
Bonneville filled from 30,000 to 15,000 calendar years ago, and water leaked through the
permeable gravels and karst limestone of the pass. At about 15,000 years ago, the lake
level was high enough to spill over the pass, but the spill was not catastrophic. However,
the alluvial dam eventually failed at the Zenda Threshold at 14,500 years ago, and the
lake waters spread at the American Falls area. The flow primarily followed the Snake
River, but it also diverged northwest along Lake Channel before rejoining the Snake
River at Massacre Rocks (Link et al. 1999).
Curreyâs (1990) comprehensive study of pluvial lake geomorphology agrees with
the scenario presented by Link et al. According to Currey, Lake Bonneville underwent a
succession of three stages between 21,000 and 13,000 calendar years ago. The first stage
lasted from 21,000 to 15,300 years B. P. and consisted of closed-basin transgression.
From 15,000 to 14,500 B. P., Lake Bonneville was a threshold-controlled open basin
until the catastrophic flood destroyed the threshold at Red Rock Pass. The final stage
was made up of closed basin regression resulting in the formation of the Great Salt Lake.
This stage lasted from 14,200 to 13,000 calendar years B. P. (Currey 1990:198-201).
The existence of pluvial lakes in Idaho itself is speculative, although geologists
know of a large lake (Lake Idaho) that existed along the Snake River valley in the

124

western portion of the state during the Pliocene (Swirydczuk et al. 1982). The deposits
left by Lake Idaho comprise what is known as the Glenns Ferry Formation in the
geological record. The Glenns Ferry formation is made up mostly of lacustrine facies,
with a lesser extent of fluvial and floodplain facies also present. These deposits extend
westward from the town of Hagerman in Gooding County, Idaho into western Oregon.
At the type site, the Glenns Ferry deposits are at least 600 meters thick (Swirydczuk et al.
1982:545). It is possible that Lake Idaho extended into the Big Camas Prairie based on
the fact that Gooding County, located immediately to the south, contains the Glenns
Ferry Formation. However, the Formationâs age ranges from the late Pliocene to the
early Pleistocene and was replaced by subsequent gravel deposits and by the Bruneau
Formation well before humans could have occupied Idaho (Kimmel 1982:560).
According to Kohntopp (2001:24), the Big Camas Prairie contains deposits of a
pluvial lakebed. However, no known published resources detail the existence of this
pluvial lake. It is possible that the small valley did contain a pluvial lake based on the
fact that the Soldier and Smoky mountains just to the north have glacial deposits (Figure
59). It may also be possible that the Big Camas Prairie was flooded during the existence
of Lake Idaho and/or during the draining of Lake Bonneville. However, both of these
events occurred prior to the Clovis period and would not have directly affected the people
who left behind the Simon cache.

Pleistocene Geomorphology of Wilsall, Montana and the Surrounding Mountains
The Anzick site near Wilsall, Montana lies on the Shields River floodplain and is
bordered by two mountain ranges: the Bridger Mountains to the west and the Crazy
Mountains to the east. Lahren and Bonnichsen (1971) state that both of these mountain
ranges were glaciated during the late Pleistocene. However, the Wisconsin glaciers only
extended to the edge of the Shields River floodplain. Previous glacial advances did go
farther into the floodplain, but they did not cover the entire area, as was the case with the
Yellowstone Valley to the south (Lahren and Bonnichsen 1971).
The floodplain itself is made up of sandstone from the Livingston Formation.
This formation outcrops occasionally in the floodplain, particularly along Battle Ridge,
which follows the Shields River near the Anzick site northeast into Wilsall (Jones
1997:32). Livingston sandstone also comprises the cliff that runs along Flathead Creek at
the location of the Anzick site. Jones (1997:39-40) theorizes that the Flathead Creek

126

channel has filled since the end of the Pleistocene due to the influx of a spring system.
He proposes that the channel was lower during the Clovis period and that the Anzick site
was located in a rockshelter or ledge along the sandstone cliff, rather than at the base of
the cliff as it appeared in 1968. The cliff itself also weathered during this span of time,
and the resulting colluvium eroded the rockshelter and buried the Anzick site.

The Green River Basin and Southwest Wyoming
The proposed location for the Fenn cache is the Green River Basin. This area is a
plain that is bordered by the Wyoming Range to the west, the Wind River Mountains to
the north, the Rock Springs Uplift to the east, and the Uinta Mountains to the south. The
basin is characterized as an elevated, cool desert environment, with a geomorphology is
made up of flood terraces that have formed since the end of the Pleistocene. As glaciers
from the Wind River and Uinta Mountains melted, glacial outwash flowed into the Green
River Valley. As river volume decreased following the retreat of the glaciers,
increasingly lower terraces were eroded into the Green River Basin. The uppermost
terraces now consist of patches of elevated alluvial quartzite gravels along a relatively
flat bench. Various small drainages flow from the upper bench into the Hams Fork and
Blacks Fork Rivers, which in turn join the Green River. The bedrock in this area is made
up of Eocene marl, sandstone, and shale from the Bridger Formation. Aeolian deposits
also occur in patches along sheltered areas on the downwind side of the bench crests, and
larger dune formations (such as dome and longitudinal dunes) occur across the basin
floor. The dune deposits are made up of aeolian sands and alluvial silts (Thompson and
Pastor 1995:2-4).

127

Discussion and Conclusion
The advance of glaciers followed by the buildup and subsequent flooding of large
lakes at the end of the Pleistocene may be linked to the eruptions of volcanoes in the
northwestern United States during the Ice Age. According to Bray (1976), ash from
volcanoes could hypothetically reduce solar exposure during the summer. In turn, winter
snows would not melt as thoroughly as normally, and the resulting climate change could
have a deleterious impact on life in the region.
The eruptions of Glacier Peak may have had a profound impact on Paleoindian
subsistence and survival. The ash from the Glacier Peak eruptions would have reduced
growing seasons and caused stress for the entire ecosystem (Davis 1995). The cache at
East Wenatchee may have represented an offering to stave off the effects of food shortage
following the eruptions. In more general terms, ceremonial Clovis caches (ones that
contain completed tools and red ochre) may have been offered during times of tragedy.
The Anzick cache is the most dramatic example as it is associated with the burial of a
child.

Site-Specific Geoarchaeological Interpretations

The contexts of each of the four Clovis caches have different degrees of
preservation, with East Wenatchee being the most well-preserved and Fenn being the
least. As such, the completeness of the geoarchaeological record differs by site. Each
cache offers its own contextual problems and presents unique geoarchaeological
questions.

128

East Wenatchee
This cache has the most complete geoarchaeological record by far, but its
completeness has not prevented the development of a heated debate among the
archaeologists involved in the excavations. The debate centers on whether Paleoindians
purposely buried the East Wenatchee artifacts in pits or left them on the Clovis-age
surface. Modern excavation and analytical techniques could easily solve such a problem,
but the 15-year moratorium imposed on the site in 1992 prevents further investigations
until at least 2007 (Hall 1992).
The East Wenatchee cache is located at R&R Orchards in the town of East
Wenatchee, Washington. The apple orchard lies in the trough of a 100 m-long current
ripple that runs along a giant point bar caused by the catastrophic flooding of the
Columbia River (Figure 60, Mehringer and Foit 1990:495). The origin of the flood may
have been the draining of Lake Missoula or the later draining of Lake Columbia (Waitt
and Atwater 1989:48). Previous, larger floods left higher ripples along canyon walls to
the north of the site (Mehringer and Foit 1990:495). The cache site now stands 180 m
above the modern-day Columbia River (Alt 2001, Mehringer 1989:2).

129

Figure 60: The study area with topographic cross section from the Columbia River over the terrace through
the Clovis cache and the moat (Trench 8), to the canyon cliffs (A Aâ; 10X vertical exaggeration)
(Mehringer 1989:3).

In 1988, Mehringer and a team of excavators dug stratigraphic test pits 16 m east
and 9 m west of the cache site. They encountered the point bar sediments at depths of 80
cm and 68 cm, respectively. The excavators could not identify the point bar sediment
visually; it was instead a change of texture that they could feel with their trowels.
However, the point bar sediment did contain occasional basalt âdrop stoneâ cobbles left
by the floods. The sediment that overlies the point bar deposits is a layer of loess that has
been deposited during the late Pleistocene and Holocene. Mehringer named the contact
between these to layers Contact A (Mehringer 1989:4-6). In order to gain an accurate
understanding of the sediments overlying the cache, Mehringer (1989:31-34) took
vertical and horizontal sediment samples from the west wall of Excavation Unit 9,

130

horizontal samples from the south wall of Unit 9, and vertical samples from the west wall
of Unit 7 (Figure 61).

Figure 61: Layout of excavation units in the R&R Orchards just south of Grant Road (Mehringer 1989:5).

Mehringer (1989:6) noted that the loess layer has a slightly grayer color that the
point bar sediment below Contact A, causing him to suspect the presence of tephra. In
the course of the excavation, Mehringer also observed the presence of pumice fragments
within the grayer deposits. To gain a better understanding of the areaâs stratigraphy and
tephrachronology, excavators dug 23 backhoe trenches across a valley 500 m to the north
of the cache site. This valley lies between the cache and a canyon wall, with a moat
running along the wall that fills with meltwater in the spring (Figure 62). The results of
the backhoe trenching revealed seven layers, with the lowest consisting of coarse, loose

131

flood deposits. These gray sands and gravels represent the Pleistocene flood surface and
generally fine upward, although some lag gravels appear towards the top. The next layer
is made up of weakly laminated layers of brown sand and silt that have a prismatic ped
structure. This layer occurs only in the deep moat deposits. The next layer, appearing
everywhere except in the deepest moat deposits, is Contact A. The layer is similar to its
corresponding moat deposits in that it contains brown coarse sand, however, it does not
exhibit any signs of soil development. Overlying the coarse sand is the Glacier Peak
tephra, which appears in the moat as lenses of mostly mixed white pumice with grains
ranging from sand to silt in size. Above the Glacier Peak tephra lies the Pre-Mazama
soil, the only Holocene soil that appears in Mehringerâs analysis. The soil is very distinct
in the moat area and features characteristics of a natric horizon. The soil becomes
increasingly less distinct as one moves southward away from the moat and towards the
cache. However, the soil can still be identified based as slightly reddish layer just under
the Mazama tephra in Backhoe Trench 23, just across Grant Road from the cache site.
The next layer is the Mazama tephra, which is mixed with loess deposits but is
identifiable based on it light color. Because of its mixed deposition, the Mazama tephra
has indistinct boundaries. Finally, the surface layer of Mehringerâs study is the plow
zone, the disturbed modern sediment that typically extends 20 to 30 cm into the ground
except in areas of erosion (Mehringer 1989:18-28). It is also notable that Mehringer
makes a point of stating that he could detect no Clovis-age living surface nor any sign of
human disturbance of the sediment overlying the cache. He therefore proposes that the
Paleoindians left the cache on the surface or buried it shallowly (Mehringer 1989:34, 40).

132

Field Notebook of a Lietz, Set 2 Total Station EDM (Mehringer 1989:19).

Although the sediment overlying the East Wenatchee cache itself is relatively
uniform and therefore not useful for stratigraphy, the homogeneity of the sediment and
dense concentrations of large artifacts enables accurate readings from ground penetrating
radar. The radar readings confirmed the presence of Clovis artifacts in Excavation Units
7 and 9. The radar also picked up denser concentrations adjacent to these units, but
Mehringer was not prepared to excavate such a large feature. Additional test units (12
and 13) farther from the cache revealed rodent burrows in Unit 12 and modern trash in
Unit 13 as the sources of radar anomalies (Mehringer 1989:8-10).
The key to obtaining an age for the cache depended on careful sedimentological
analyses rather than radiometric methods (Figure 63). Many of the artifacts from the

133

cache exhibit a siliceous crust on their ventral surfaces. Additionally, the five artifacts
that Mehringerâs excavation removed in 1988 also had the crust present. One of the most
notable aspects of the crust is the fact that it is not present on portions of artifacts that
overlie other artifacts. This fact, when combined with the knowledge that the crust only
appears on the artifactsâ undersides, indicates that the sediment below the cache has
different properties than the sediment above it. One biface (WSHS Number 1992.24.21)
that excavators removed during the 1988 excavation retained one centimeter of its
surrounding sediment. This sediment revealed that the biface had a crust that was rich in
pumice. Mehringer and Foitâs (1990) electron microprobe analyses showed that the
pumice from the crust on the artifacts matches pumice from the underlying sediment and
from Trench 8 in the moat. All these samples appear to match chemically to the Glacier
Peak, Layer G tephra. Additionally, very little Glacier Peak tephra is present in the
sediment overlying the artifacts. The solubility of the volcanic glass beneath the cache
caused the crust to form and the sediment to adhere to the artifacts (Mehringer and Foit
1990:497-500). As previously stated, Glacier Peakâs Layer G tephra was originally
thought to be approximately 12,750 Â± 350 radiocarbon years old, but later studies
revealed that two major Glacier Peak eruptions (B and G) more likely occurred within a
span of decades around 11,250 radiocarbon years ago and are extremely similar in
composition (Porter 1978, Mehringer et al. 1984, Foit et al. 1993).

134

Figure 63: Schematic section of a 4-m-deep backhoe pit shows stratigraphic relationships of Mazama and
Glacier Peak tephras in the post-flood sediments of the terrace moat 500 m north of the Clovis site
(Mehringer and Foit 1990).

R. M. Gramly continued the excavations at the East Wenatchee in 1990, but he
and his team of volunteers reached a different conclusion regarding the features than
Mehringer and his team. Contrary to Mehringerâs (1989:34, 40) assertion that no pit
features are visible at the cache site, Gramly (1993:6) claims that most of the artifacts lay
in a shallow pit of 1.1 by 1.5 m. He bases this conclusion on observations of slightly
darker, looser sediment above the unexcavated artifacts. Gramly also claims that a
second, deeper pit exists to the east of the main pit feature. The excavators encountered
this second feature in a trench (N101E102 to N105E102 from the SE corner) two meters
east of the cache excavation. The excavators uncovered a sidescraper and a blade from
the bottom of this feature, at a depth of 93 cm. Throughout the fill overlying these
artifacts were small flakes of agate and obsidian. Interestingly, the two artifacts from this

135

feature were 20 cm deeper than those from the main cache just two meters to the east
(Gramly 1993:6). As proof for the existence of the second pit feature, Gramly (1993:24)
creates a plot of soil sample fractions for the east and west walls of the trench (Figure
64). The graph appears to indicate disturbances in the sediment from 103N to 104N on
the west wall and from 103.8N to at least 105N on the east wall. However, the y-axis and
strata are not clearly labeled, making interpretations of the results difficult if not
impossible.

east wall (bottom graph) of L-shaped trench, East Wenatchee Clovis site, 1990 excavations. The samples
were taken at the 65 cm level below surface. Boundaries of Feature 2 are presumed to exist at abrupt
changes in slope (dashed line) at points N103.00 and N104.00 (west wall) and N103.80 (east wall) (Gramly
1993:24).

136

Robert Mierendorf (1997), the Washtington State archaeologist who was the first
professional to investigate the East Wenatchee site, criticizes Gramlyâs pit hypothesis.
He points out that Mehringerâs (1989) more careful stratigraphic analysis failed to locate
any burial pits, despite the fact that Mehringer took numerous horizontal and vertical soil
samples at close intervals. On the other hand, Mierendorf (who was present during
Gramlyâs 1990 excavation) states that Gramly did not shave the walls or record their
profiles prior to his excavation. Therefore, vertical evidence of pit fill overlying the
artifacts has been lost. As alternative explanations for Gramlyâs two pits, Mierendorf
offers two hypotheses. The first hypothesis is that the first pit, which contains the
majority of the cache artifacts, is actually Contact A (Mierendorf 1997:59). Mehringerâs
description of the texture change in the sediment at the contact is strikingly similar to
Gramlyâs identification of the pit boundary. For Gramlyâs second pit feature, Mierendorf
(1997:59) provides an explanation that it may have been the remnant of a hole that was
dug for a tree in the apple orchard.
Although the debate concerning pit features at the East Wenatchee site cannot be
resolved fully until the moratorium on excavation is finished, it is likely that both studies
have made valid points. Mehringerâs (1989) report did not rule out the possibility of
shallow pit features, although he did not detect any disturbance in the overlying sediment.
Mierendorf (1997:59) interprets Contact A to be a possible deflation surface, wherein
much of the evidence of overlying pit fill may have eroded away. Furthermore, Gramly
(1998) claims that Mierendorfâs test pit from the original 1987 excavation was situated
entirely within the cache pit, and therefore no pit boundary could be detected at that time.

137

Anzick
The context of the Anzick site is not nearly as specific as East Wenatchee, but
there is some evidence to provide archaeologists with an idea of the cacheâs original
provenience. The construction workers who discovered the cache destroyed the top
overhang of the sandstone outcrop with dynamite in order to use the sandstone for fill
material. Further down slope, the workers encountered finer-grained sediments
containing the cache. They removed the artifacts and only stopped digging when they
encountered a human skull underlying the Clovis assemblage. Dr. Dee Taylor, the first
archaeologist to investigate the site, described his attempt to understand the cacheâs
context as âan exercise in frustration.â (Taylor 1969).
Despite Taylorâs frustration, the context of the Anzick site is still more observable
than that of many caches. In May 1971, Larry Lahren and Robson Bonnichsen
investigated the stratigraphy of the Anzick site. Lahren and Bonnichsen excavated seven
stratigraphic profiles, as shown in Figure 65: two to the west and down slope of the cache
find, one on the location of the burial, one south of the cache on top of the sandstone
outcrop, two along the slope of the outcrop to the east of the cache, and one to the east in
the meadow down slope from the outcrop (Lahren and Bonnichsen ca 1980s).

138

Figure 65: Plan view sketch of the Anzick site and test units. The map is oriented to the south (Lahren and
Bonnichsen ca 1980s).

According to Lahren and Bonnichsen (ca 1970s), the geomorphology of the
Anzick site is as follows:
1.
2.
3.

4.

Channel filling by the Shields River and Flathead Creek along, but not in,
the burial site.
Rock (sandstone) weathering in the burial area and subsequent talus
deposition.
The meadow area on the north side of the burial site seems to be the
product of recent deposition over a spring system flowing from the west
into the present channel of Flathead Creek.
It seems probable that during Clovis times the meadow area was
considerably lower and that the burial may have been in a ledge or small
rockshelter position, rather than in a basal slope position as it appears
today.

Two sources of contention in the siteâs geoarchaeology are the nature of the
association between the cache artifacts and the human remains and Taylorâs (1969)
theory that the sandstone outcrop was also used prehistorically as a bison jump. The

139

concern over the burial lies in the fact that not all the bones have radiocarbon ages that
match with the Clovis period. Lahren (1999), however, offers his own interpretation to
address this issue. While the Anzick site was originally believed to be a burial of two
Clovis-age juveniles, Lahrenâs interpretation states that only one of the individuals is as
old as the cache. Individual 1 consists of weathered and bleached cranial fragments that
were found about 10 to 12 feet away from the cache, and Individual 2 represents the red
ochre-stained remains that the construction workers found lying beneath the cache
artifacts. AMS ages on Individual 1 averaged to 8,610 Â± 90 years B. P., and seven ages
on Individual 2 have an average of 10,680 Â± 50 years B. P. Based on this evidence,
Lahren suggests that only Individual 2 is part of the Anzick Clovis assemblage, while
Individual 1 represents later cultural activity.
Lahren and Bonnichsen (ca 1980s) criticize Talyorâs (1969) assertion that the
Anzick site was also used as a bison jump. Bison jumps are sites that occur at the bases
of cliffs or other sharp dropoffs where hunters can herd bison and drive them off the
edge, creating a massive kill site. Well known bison jumps, such as the Bonfire site in
Texas, contain the remains of hundreds of bison (Dibble and Lorrain 1968). On the other
hand, the Anzick site does have bison remains, but they occur much more sparingly and
are disarticulated. There is no clear evidence of human activity associated with the bison
bones, and it is equally possible that carnivores or scavengers left the bones at the site
(Lahren and Bonnichsen ca 1980s).

140

Simon
The original location of this cache lies along a plowed field about one mile to the
east of Deer Creek in the Big Camas Prairie, Camas County, Idaho (Butler 1963:23). The
site is about 50 km north of the Snake River (Woods and Titmus 1985:3). William
Simon uncovered the artifacts in yellow alluvium while scraping the ground for a
roadway (Butler 1963:22). The alluvium is the result of deposition that has been
accumulating in the Big Camas prairie since the middle or late Pleistocene and consists of
water-laden sediment that is 30% sand and 70% sandy clay in the upper 250 feet. The
sediment also contains pebbles up to Â¾ of an inch in diameter (Piper 1926).
This portion of the Big Camas Prairie contains numerous small creeks and
tributaries that join Camas Creek, which travels through the center of the prairie from
west to east. Just to the west of the cache site is a field that has surface deposition of
moist black clay. This clay represents evidence of a paleochannel lying adjacent to the
cache. The tributaries of Camas Creek, including Deer Creek, are meandering streams,
and this paleochannel most likely represents a former channel of Deer Creek (Butler
1963:23). Butler states that the Simon cache pre-dates the paleochannel, as it was found
in the underlying yellow alluvium instead of the black clay. Because the roadway
construction removed the overlying sediment, it is impossible to determine whether the
black clay was present directly above the cache, however. Moreover, Butler (1963:23)
states that the cache was buried about 12 to 18 inches deep on a rise in the yellow
alluvium. The cache site was no more than 18 feet in diameter and was situated along the
western slope of this rise. It is possible that this raised surface was not part of the
paleochannel immediately to the west.

141

One curious aspect of the Simon site is a portion of red stained sediment that
occurs in the center of the 18-foot wide area designated as the find spot. Butler (1963:23)
states that this stained area represents an area of burned sediment, but he admits that no
faunal remains nor charcoal were associated with the artifacts. Butler does state that one
biface exhibits pot-lid scars on both sides, indicating that the artifact had been exposed to
fire. This evidence, however, is too scant to ascertain that the red stain in the ground is
the result of fire. It seems equally, if not more likely that the red staining is due to the
presence of red ochre.
Kohntopp (2001:69) proposes that the Big Camas Prairie is the location of a
pluvial lake that did not dry until 10,000 years B. P. Therefore, the Simon cache could be
a watery offering, similar to river offerings found in prehistoric Europe. However, this
theory is most likely erroneous due to the fact that no published research indicates the
presence of a pluvial lake so far north of the Great Basin. Moreover, the sediment of the
Big Camas Prairie is alluvial, and published references make no mention of lacustrine
deposits, such as extensive clay deposition, varves, laminae, or evaoporites. Moreover,
the presence of red ochre/burnt ground at the site of the cache argues against the
possibility of a watery offering. The pluvial lake hypothesis would have to explain how
the red staining could appear if the entire area was under water during the Clovis period.

Fenn
Archaeologists know of two different stories concerning the original context of
the Fenn cache. One story is that the cache was uncovered in a plowed field, while the
other states that the artifacts were found in a skin bag in a dry cave (Frison and Bradley

142

1999:22). Frison and Bradley believe that the cave hypothesis is more likely because the
artifacts show no evidence of plow damage. Moreover, the modern-day people consider
the region of the Wyoming Basin, of which the Green River Basin is a part, to be largely
inhospitable and not suitable for farming (Sharrock 1966:1). However, the notion that a
bag could remain intact even in a cave since the terminal Pleistocene seems to be farfetched.
Because the location of the actual Fenn site is unknown, the Pine Spring site
(48SW101) may act as an approximation for the conditions and landscape that
Paleoindians encountered in the region (Figure 66). The Pine Spring site is located about
ten miles west of the Flaming Gorge reservoir along the northern slope of Black
Mountain in Sweetwater County, Wyoming. A spring outlet provided a source of water
for the inhabitants of the site and is located immediately to the west of Excavation
Trenches 4 and 6. Moreover, a chert outcrop is present to the northwest, slightly down
slope from the site. This outcrop is made up of limestone interspersed with nodules of
black and tan banded âtigerâ chert of the Green River Formation (Sharrock 1966:12-17).
The area is largely devoid of vegetation, except near the spring itself. The landscape
adjacent to the spring consists of two parallel ridges that support localized plants. This
vegetation has persisted long enough for soils to develop along the spring, although there
is almost no soil development elsewhere in the area. The vegetation that depends on the
spring changes as one moves down slope, starting with mahogany at the springhead, then
juniper, then alternating aspen and cottonwood, and finally blue spruce at the
northernmost portion of the site (Sharrock 1966:12-15). The soils near the spring are
formed from bentonitic calcareous clay and from landslide deposits that overlie clay and

143

shale from the Bridger Formation. The soil that formed on the clay has an A1 horizon
that extends from the surface to a depth of 15 inches, an A-C horizon from 15 to 18
inches, and a Cca horizon from 18 to 41 inches. The soil that formed on the landslide
deposit has an A horizon that extends to 13.5 inches, and the B horizon extends down to
48 inches. Both soils have calcium carbonate present throughout their profiles, indicating
the presence of water. The spring and the soil formation most likely became active at the
end of the Pleistocene (Eardley 1966:197-200).

Figure 66: Map of the Pine Spring site with excavation trenches (Sharrock 1966:13).

The 1966 excavations at Pine Spring site identified three cultural occupation
levels (Figure 67). The lowest and earliest identifiable occupation occurs in the C

144

horizon of the soil. The development of the C horizon after the deposition of cultural
material has removed any trace of burned ground or ash lenses, and no features were
noted. Occupation 2 occurs in the B horizon and has some evidence of fire discoloration
and charcoal flecks. Additionally, there are fire-lined hearth features in Occupation 2.
Finally, Occupation 3 appears in the A horizon and on the surface, along with modern
trash. Ceramics appear in this level, but features are not present due to rodent burrowing.
Occupation 1 is believed to represent the Plano paleoindian complex based on projectile
point typology and radiocarbon ages of 9,745 Â± 195 B. P. and 11,880 Â± 410 B. P.,
although the latter date is most likely erroneous. Occupation 2 is generally considered
Archaic, with a radiocarbon age of 3,685 Â± 80 B. P., but Plano points appear in this level
as well. Occupation 3 is not as well-identified, but it is obviously later based on Fremont
ceramics and a prevalence of groundstone technology. The three occupations all appear
to represent quarrying and camping activities, with some food processing as evidenced by
the presence of bison and camel bones in the earliest occupation and cooking stones and
groundstones in the later levels (Sharrock 1966:20-29).

During the summers of 1998 and 2000, archaeologists lead by Robert L. Kelly
(2000) re-investigated the Pine Spring site. The purpose of the further excavations was to
answer some lingering questions left by Sharrockâs original analysis. First, the
excavations provided additional lithic analysis, including usewear analysis and the
recovering of pressure flake debitage that was not present in the original collection.
Second, Kellyâs research examined the faunal remains for signs of human use. Third,
Kelly focuses on the camel and bison remains to determine whether they are associated
with human artifacts. Finally, the 1998 and 2000 excavations intended to clear the
ambiguity surrounding the stratigraphy of the site. My analysis focuses on this latter goal
(Figures 68 and 69).

147

The 1998 and 2000 excavations were unfortunately unable to replicate Sharrockâs
stratigraphic findings in terms of Occupation levels, but Kelly (2000) agrees that soil is
more developed to the east of the spring than to the west. The later excavations did
uncover more late Paleoindian artifacts, but their findings of mixed deposits were more
widespread than Sharrock had indicated. Kelly states it is possible that the site has been
deflated by wind activity, and it is also likely that long periods of stability and soil
formation have compressed the stratigraphic time periods. The site has also been plagued
with looting and bioturbation, complicating the archaeologistsâ attempts to uncover intact
stratigraphy. Kelly (2000:46-47) noted that the largest cobbles of colluvial rock appear in
the lowest levels of the site, while only the smallest of debitage and bone fragments
appear in these levels. Therefore, the cultural materials were probably deposited over the
colluvium and worked their way down through bioturbation, clay swelling, and freezethaw cycles.
If the Pine Spring site is an accurate depiction of Paleoindian sites in the Green
River Basin, then one can project some hypotheses as to the context of the Fenn cache.
At Pine Spring, the Paleoindian artifacts were shallowly buried, mostly less than 1 m.
Outcrops of tiger chert, resembling the Green River Formation chert that Frison and
Bradley (1999) describe in the Fenn collection, are common in the area. The cache
would also have been located near a water source, as the other three caches in this study
have been located along or near creeks or rivers. Therefore, a location near a spring
would have been a distinct possibility for the Fenn cache. Unfortunately, had
archaeologists actually uncovered the Fenn cache, the bioturbation, clay swells, and

148

freeze-thaws that can occur in the area would probably have disturbed the cacheâs
original context.

Soil Acidity and the Preservation of Organic Artifacts
The presence of bone rods at East Wenatchee and Anzick sets these two cache
sites apart from Simon and Fenn. However, because the rods are made from organic
materials, it is possible that the artifacts simply did not preserve into the present. If bone
rods were originally present in all four of these caches, then the level of acidity in the soil
at each site could account for their presence or absence today.
For the East Wenatchee site, the soil surrounding the area is characterized as
Pogue fine sandy loam and has a pH range of 6.1 to 7.8 (USDA 1981a). Moreover,
Gramly (1990) states that the sediment surrounding the cache has a pH of 6.5, but it may
have become acidic in recent years due to the planting of the apple orchard. The surface
soil surrounding the Anzick site has a pH of 7.6 to 7.8, which probably contributes to the
preservation of both the bone rods and the human remains (Park County, MO NRCS
personal communication). The Simon site lies within either the Brinegar loam, which has
a pH range of 6.1 to 7.3 and may represent the paleochannel sediment, or the Rands loam
representing the yellow alluvium with a pH of 6.1 to 6.5 near the surface (USDA 1981b).
If the Simon cache actually came from the Rands loam, then the soilâs high acidity could
have erased any traces of organic materials associated with the cache. However, the area
of the Pine Spring site has a pH of 7.5 to 9 (Jeff Louis personal communication). If the
Pine Spring site is an accurate approximation for the location of the Fenn cache, then soil
acidity cannot explain the absence of bone tools from the collection.

149

In sum, it is possible that the pH of the soil at a cache site may contribute to the
presence or absence of bone rods, but it is not necessarily the deciding factor. Based on
the extremely basic soil that is present in the Pine Spring site, it is likely that the Fenn
cache never contained bone tools at all. As such, bone rods do not always accompany the
stone tools found in Clovis caches, and their presence or absence may indicate different
purposes for the caches.

150

CONCLUSIONS

The four Clovis caches presented in this study relate to each other in a number of
ways, but no two are exactly the same. It presents a difficult dilemma for anyone who
seeks to define technological differences within a single complex. However, the results
of this study can provide some new directions for research.
The statistical analyses first show that the artifact assemblages are largely not
normally distributed, but the subsequent methods used in this study do not depend on
normal distribution. The factor analysis reveals that all variables could be condensed into
components of size and shape and that these components can be applied to all artifact
types. Extensive cluster analyses reveals that, within each site, fluted points have two to
four size and shape clusters, bifaces have four to six clusters, and bone rods generally
have two or three clusters per assemblage. Analyses of the size and shape data from all
the cache sites reveals that fluted points form three clusters according to size but not
shape, bifaces do not form discernable clusters (although Anzick and Simon have greater
variances than East Wenatchee and Fenn), and bone rods cluster almost entirely
according to their site of origin. Comparing the results of the size and shape analysis on
the East Wenatchee artifacts to their in situ locations at the site reveals that only the
fluted points may have been grouped according to size and shape. However, one cannot
rule out that the fluted points may have been randomly placed, or the bifaces and bone
rods may have been disturbed from their original positions.
Additionally, the correspondence analyses portray some overlooked aspects of the
cache assemblages. The first analysis shows the overwhelming number of flakes that are

151

present at East Wenatchee compared to the other three caches. After adding five
additional caches for the second analysis, the caches split into groups characterized by
their abundance of blades, flakes, or fluted points and bifaces. After eliminating the
blade and flake categories for the third analysis, two of the four original caches remain
biface-dominated, but East Wenatchee is closer to the bone rod category, and Fenn is
closest to the fluted point category. Adding three extra caches for the fourth analysis
does not substantially change these results.
The geoarchaeology of the cache sites provides some comparative insight to the
cachesâ contexts. Paleoindians left the East Wenatchee cache on a giant point bar along
the bloated Columbia River at the end of the Pleistocene. It is possible that the
Channeled Scablands immediately to the east of the site were flooded at this time, either
from the draining of Lake Missoula or the emptying of Lake Columbia. Additionally, the
cache was deposited immediately following an eruption of Glacier Peak. Undoubtedly,
this period was a time of profound geological changes in eastern Washington State. It is
possible that Paleoindians left the East Wenatchee cache as a ritual offering to stave off
these disasters, although the evidence of red ochre that is often associated with ritual
offerings is enigmatically scant. Moreover, the presence of small flakes at the site may
indicate that more mundane activities also occurred.
Examining the geoarchaeological literature that is available for the Anzick site
reveals that the cache may represent the burial assemblage of one individual, not two as
was previously assumed. The second burial consists of weathered cranium fragments
that were found ten to twelve feet away from the cache assemblage. Unlike the artifact

152

assemblage and the first burial, the second burial is not covered in red ochre and has a
radiocarbon age that is 2,000 years younger than the Clovis period (Lahren 1999).
Kohntopp (2001:69) proposes the possibility that the Simon cache was an offering
that was thrown into a pluvial lake. However, the geological evidence found in this study
does not support this hypothesis. No known studies on the geology of Idaho show that
pluvial lakes have existed in the area since the late Pliocene, and the draining of Lake
Bonneville through the Snake River does not seem to extend into the Big Camas Prairie.
While it might be reasonable to infer that there would have been more water in the Big
Camas Prairie as mountain glaciers melted at the end of the Pleistocene, the geological
evidence shows extensive fluvial deposits and paleochannels, rather than an accumulation
of lacustrine sediment. Moreover, the presence of a red-stained surface at the find spot
indicates either that the artifacts were covered with red ochre, or that the ground around
them was burned. Either way, such evidence would not likely be present in a watery
offering.
Being from an unknown location, understanding the context of the Fenn cache
requires research on an analogous site. The Pine Spring site is a Paleoindian site in
southwestern Wyoming that serves this purpose well. The site contains shallowly buried
Paleoindian components, a nearby source of Green River chert, and it is adjacent to a
spring. Another well known Paleoindian site in this area, the Finley site, is also
shallowly buried and located near a spring (Frison 1978:183-185). Therefore, if the Fenn
cache was located in an open air site in the same area, it may have been shallowly buried
and located near a similar water source.

153

One of the mysteries surrounding Clovis caches is the presence of bone rods.
This research tested the hypothesis that bone rods may have been present at each cache
but only survived in the caches that have low soil acidity. The data do not support this
hypothesis, as East Wenatchee has fairly acidic soil and bone rods present, while the area
around the Pine Spring site has extremely basic soil, but bone rods are not present in the
Fenn cache.
Comparing the Clovis caches against each other is a complicated process, as no
two caches are universally similar to each other. By looking strictly at the fluted points
and bifaces, the two artifact types that are present in each of the four caches, the
following pattern emerges (Table 36):

Table 36: Increasing fluted point size compared in increasing proportions of fluted points to bifaces in each
cache assemblage.

154

Judging entirely from these criteria, one might logically assume that caches with a
high number of bifaces would be utilitarian, and caches with many large fluted points
would be ritual. However, the Anzick cache has many times more bifaces than fluted
points, and most of the points from Anzick are relatively small. Still, the Anzick cache is
the only assemblage associated with a known burial, so it is obviously ceremonial. One
cannot, however, rule out the possibility that all the caches are in some way ceremonial.
Different cache contents may indicate different ritualistic behaviors, different seasons, or
even different cultures. It is also possible that a mortuary assemblage contains the toolkit
of the individual that is buried, and hence a whole reduction sequence from large biface
to finished point could be present. Other caches may represent more regular, planned
offerings in which completed tools are more common.
Examining the caches from a regional perspective brings forth some additional
patterns in Clovis caching behavior (Figure 70). Based data available from nine caches
in the western United States, various regional patterns emerge. The northernmost caches
contain bone rods, the westernmost caches have large fluted points, caches in the Rocky
Mountains and northern Great Plains emphasize bifacial technology, and caches in the
south emphasize blades. These regional patterns may be only tentative, however, and
new data from additional Clovis caches will undoubtedly modify these results.

APPENDIX

The Microsoft Excel file that accompanies this thesis contains all the artifact
measurement data, ratio variables, transformations, and factor analysis scores used in this
research. The first tab, entitled Data, consists of all the measurements. Each row
represents an artifact, and each column represents a variable. The red cells indicate
values where an artifact measurement should be present but is missing or unobtainable.
The second tab, entitled Codes, contains definitions for each value used in the nominal
variables (site, artifact type, and raw material).
