ATTEND TEXAS ARCHEOLOGY
ACADEMY IN 2007
Three sessions of the Texas Archeology Academy will be sponsored by TAS
in 2007. No experience or previous knowledge is needed to learn and enjoy
these weekend sessions.

Lithics: Reading Stone Artifacts
The Lithics workshop is designed to provide hands-on experience for recognizing and analyzing stone artifacts. You will
learn the different ways in which stone tools were made, how to recognize their different use-wear patterns and the
interpretation of stone artifacts found in the archeological record. Flintknapping demonstrations will focus not so much on
how points are made but rather how the archeological record is formed. Dr. Harry Shafer will lead the workshop with the
assistance of Dr. John Dockall and flintknapping specialists. The Lithic Academy will be held Feb.3-4 in San Antonio at
CAR at UTSA.
Ceramics: The Stories Found in Pottery
In this workshop you will learn how pottery is made and used, how pottery reflects cultural traditions, and how
archeologists use the ceramic data to understand the people and their past life-ways. Participants will learn to recognize
and sort sherds to answer questions about ancient lifeways. Dr. Shafer will lead the workshop with the assistance of
Marybeth Tomka and local potters. Special attention will be paid to Caddoan Pottery. The Ceramics Academy will be
held in Nacogdoches March 3-4.
Rock Art
This Academy will explore Texas rock art within a world framework. Presentations will include rock art as part of cultural
expression, rock art and territorial geography, sacred canyons, and why recording rock art is important. Dr. Harry Shafer
and Dr. Carolyn Boyd will lead the workshop. Participants will be in class and visiting rock art sites - White Shaman on
the Pecos River and Fate Bell in Seminole Canyon. Participants should be in good physical health (able to climb 10 flights
of stairs) to visit the sites. Classes will be held at the Shumla School near Comstock. Limited accommodations are
available at Shumla, Seminole Canyon State Park or Del Rio. Participants will be informed of options. Rock Art Academy
will be held March 30 - April 1(beginning Friday evening).

Open to All
All workshops are intended for anyone interested in archeological topics. Avocational archeologists experience new
dimensions of expertise; professional archeologists benefit from review; undergraduates, graduate students and educators
may receive credit for the classes. The goal of Texas Archeology Academy is to show how archeology is done and why
we do it.
Fees are $85 for members and $125 for non-members (includes membership fee). Fees include a CD manual, lunch and
snacks during the class sessions. TAS is a provider of professional development accredited through SBED. Credits may
