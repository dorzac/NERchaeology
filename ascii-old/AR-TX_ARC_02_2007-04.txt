ABSTRACT

The Trinity River Authority is upgrading the Northeast Lakeview Sanitary
Sewer Force Main within Cedar Hill State Park in southwest Dallas
County, TX. After review by the Corps of Engineers and the Texas
Historical Commission, AR Consultants, Inc. was asked to conduct a
pedestrian survey of the route crossing of Baggett Branch and John Penn
Branch. A buried prehistoric ash lens had been located at the route
crossing of Baggett Branch and the route was relocated to avoid the site
(41DL448). Due to the depth of the floodplain sediments and the heavy
leaf cover, shovel testing and backhoe trenching were done at each of the
crossings in order to search for buried cultural resources. No buried
artifact-bearing deposits were found on the surface or by testing. An ash
sample and a broken large mammal long bone were collected from the ash
layer and were respectively radiocarbon dated 390±40 BP (Beta 225640)
and 320±40 (Beta 225641). It is concluded that the site represents a
hunting and mast gathering site probably occupied in the fall during the
very late Late Prehistoric period.
AR Consultants recommends that further archaeological investigations are
unwarranted at the creek crossings and site 41DL448 has been avoided by
rerouting the force main alignment. The site will be affected in the future
as the creek continues to erode through existing fluvial processes unrelated
to the pipeline project. The US Army Corps of Engineers or the Texas
Parks and Wildlife Department might want to consider bank stabilization
measures to control the adverse effects of erosion on the site. If site
41DL448 is endangered by further development or maintenance of the
adjacent park road, the site limits should be further defined in order to
determine site significance. The site may be eligible for nomination for
inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places. No further
investigation is recommended along the re-aligned pipeline routes.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
A project of this scope requires the participation of a variety of people from start to
finish. First, we want to thank Dan McGregor of the Corps of Engineers and Diane
Desmuks of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department for doing the initial evaluation of
site 41DL448. Even more importantly we want to thank Paul Baldon, Naturalist at Cedar
Hill State Park for discovering the site. Without their interest and support, the study
would not have been done.
Secondly, we want to thank the staff at Freese and Nichols, Inc. for showing their
concern for prehistoric cultural resources and calling upon us to help them. In particular,
we want to thank the lead engineer, Robert Woodbury for working with the park and us
to reroute around the site. Michael Votaw, Environmental Scientist, assisted us in many
ways as did Steve Watters.
In the field, we were assisted by Mark Trevino of McKrosky Excavating who delivered
the backhoe and operated it for us in to field. His digging and backfilling were done with
care and attention. We also want to thank the Cedar Hill State Park staff for their
assistance.

INTRODUCTION
In December and January of 2006/7, AR Consultants, Inc. conducted a pedestrian
archaeological survey of two pipeline re-routes along the TRA Northeast Lakeview
Sanitary Sewer Force Main in Cedar Hill State Park, TX. The present pipeline is being
upgraded and these two sections cross major drainages with the potential of containing
cultural materials. In fact, Paul Baldon, Cedar Hill State Park Naturalist, had noticed an
apparently buried prehistoric hearth exposed in the bank of Baggett Branch adjacent to
where the proposed pipeline was to have crossed the creek. It was decided to re-route the
pipeline around the hearth which was buried a meter below the present ground surface.
The park property belongs to the Fort Worth District of the US Army Corps of Engineers
and is leased to Texas Parks and Wildlife Department so it was necessary for these
organizations to agree to the proposed re-routing.
The pipeline crosses the level foothills of the White Rock Escarpment and the narrow
valleys that extend east into the Escarpment and ultimately cross the east side of the
Mountain Creek valley. These creeks include John Penn Branch and Baggett Branch. The
route extends north from Mansfield Road through the state park to the intersection of the
entrance road to the USACE Joe Pool Lake Office and FM 1382. The replacement
pipeline will be a 30” diameter pipe that will be placed in the bottom of a five foot wide
trench that will range from 5-10’ deep depending upon its location.
The purpose of this investigation was to locate any cultural resources present within the
proposed re-route locations. If sites were located, recommendations were to be made
about archaeological site significance and how the sites might be impacted by
construction. This report has been prepared for review by the Archeology Division of the
Texas Historical Commission as part of the Section 106 review process. Relevant federal
legislation includes the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96515), the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), and the Archeological
and Historical Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93-291).
This report was written in accordance with report guidelines adopted by the Texas
Historical Commission, Archeology Division, and developed by the Council of Texas
Archeologists (ND). The following chapters present a brief description of the natural and
cultural environmental resources of the area. The research design and methodology and
then the results of the field investigation follow. A section which offers recommendations
concludes the body of the report. A list of references cited follows.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The Mountain Creek Watershed presents a unique setting in north central Texas where
the exposed western edge of the White Rock Formation forms the steep rocky scarp east
of the creek channel with the rolling Grand Prairie and Eastern Cross Timbers to the
west. The White Rock Escarpment, as it is known, has been deeply incised by the upper
end of Mountain Creek and by presently intermittent creeks on the east side of the valley.
Of these, Mountain Creek, Baggett Branch, John Penn Branch, and Artesian Creek are
apparently spring-fed and would have provided a reliable year-round water source that
supported habitats where freshwater mussels including Potamilus, Tritogonio,
Plectomerus, and others grew prehistorically along with fish, turtles, and other
amphibians.
Soils in the narrow valleys are mapped as frequently flooded Ovan clay which formed in
recent alluvium on floodplains. Flooding usually occurs two or three times a year
(Coffee, Hill, and Ressell 1980:Sheet 57).
Historically, the Escarpment was covered with cedars, junipers actually, while the top of
the Escarpment to the east was Blackland Prairie and the rolling prairie to the west was
backed by the Eastern Cross Timbers. Mountain Creek was a major floodplain forest
(Martin 1988). So within a distance of five km of the Cedar Hill State Park, a wide
variety of plants and aquatic resources were present and they could have provided an
equally wide variety of terrestrial, avian, and aquatic plant and animal food sources.

CEDAR HILLS STATE PARK SURVEY

ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE MOUNTAIN CREEK WATERSHED
Cultural historical investigations in the Mountain Creek Basin upstream from the junction
of the West Fork of the Trinity River began more than fifty years ago with the survey and
recording of numerous prehistoric archaeological sites by members of the Dallas
Archeological Society (Harris 1936). More recent work was done in conjunction with
construction of the Joe Pool Lake which was originally termed Lakeview Lake. The work
was done under the direction of the Archaeology Research Program at Southern
Methodist University, except for some Historic Architectural Buildings Survey (HABS)
work at the Penn site that was done by Environment Consultants, Inc. and completed by
AR Consultants in 1984. This work is briefly summarized below, but the reader is
referred to the original reports for additional information.
The initial lake site survey was done in 1977-78 and resulted in the locating and
recording of 17 prehistoric archaeological sites and 25 historic archaeological/ standing
structure sites (Skinner and Connors 1979). Many of these sites had previously been
recorded by DAS members who surveyed the Mountain Creek area in the 1940s. Based
on the survey findings, it was hypothesized that prehistoric settlement in the area was of a
seasonal nature and was limited by water availability. Moreover, based on the apparent
abundance of chert lithics, rather than quartzite lithics more commonly found at sites
along the main stem of the Trinity River, it was concluded that the residents were from
the Brazos River Basin rather than from the closer Trinity River area.
In 1979 and 1980, SMU and a team from North Texas State University (now the
University of North Texas) tested for buried sites at Joe Pool Lake. They also tested the
already recorded sites in order to determine their eligibility for inclusion in the National
Register of Historic Places, as well as to assess the impact that construction would have
on the various sites, and to offer a series of resource management recommendations
(Raab 1982:1).
Prehistoric testing focused on the Cobb-Pool site which appeared to contain a possible
pithouse and associated features and refuse deposits dating to the period A.D. 800-1200.
Work at the site suggested that Cobb-Pool was part of a settlement pattern based on
exploitation of a range of resources provided by greater effective moisture than in the
project area today. This is in marked contrast to the model offered by the survey team
(Raab and Woosley 1982).
Mitigation activities at the Joe Pool Lake were carried out by SMU between 1984-1986
and are reported in two monographs (Peter and McGregor editors 1988; Jurney, Lebo and
Green 1988). Excavation was done at six prehistoric sites including the Late Prehistoric
period Cobb-Pool and Baggett Branch sites, and three sites with primarily Late Archaic
occupations. Cobb-Pool was shown to represent a horticultural community occupied in
the first half of the 13th century. Baggett Branch had a late occupation characterized by

the presence of bison, Plains-style artifacts, and shell-tempered pottery similar to the type
Nocona Plain. The authors concluded that the Late Archaic and Early Late Prehistoric
occupation of the area was on a seasonal basis, primarily during the summer (Peter and
McGregor 1988b:363-364). The Cobb-Pool site is the only evidence of Middle Late
Prehistoric occupation and may indicate year-round occupation. The Late Late
Prehistoric period occupation was probably seasonal.
During the 1980s, SMU personnel and the Dallas Archeological Society (DAS)
conducted studies in the area. Survey of a sanitary sewer route along Baggett Branch was
done for the Lake Ridge Development Company (Peter and McGregor 1987). One
previously recorded prehistoric site (41DL135) was relocated and a separate prehistoric
artifact locality was noted. Both deposits were shallow and small. It was recommended
that the route avoid site 41DL135 as it was considered to be an example of a short-term
foraging camp. The DAS and SMU personnel had previously tested two other sites
(41DL137 and 41EL33) located along the upland drainages of the White Rock
Escarpment (Peter and McGregor 1988b:367; Hartig 1988). The Lester Lorch site
(41DL137) is situated adjacent to a known spring where an unnamed tributary issues
forth from the White Rock Escarpment. Artifacts from the site included Middle and Late
Archaic dart points, snub-nosed end scrapers, bone tools and beads, at least one incised
sherd, drilled mussel shells, and arrow points. Many of the chipped stone tools,
particularly the dart points and snub-nosed end scrapers, are made on fine grain quartzite
which characterizes the Late Archaic assemblages from Joe Pool Lake and the Trinity
River. The Hollings Branch site (41EL33) is situated approximately five meters above
the creek channel on a level bench and covers an area estimated to be 85 m by 25-30 m.
The deposit is confined to the upper 20-30 cm below the present ground surface. The site
is different from Lester Lorch in that only a few arrow points were recovered along with
a few pieces of mussel shell, fire-cracked rock, and lithic debris. Hundreds of pieces of
animal bone are the most common artifact class. Peter (1998) suspected that these sites
may have been occupied during the summer when the tree cover would have provided
protection from the direct sun.
More recently, AR Consultants conducted several surveys in the Mountain Creek basin
but virtually no prehistoric sites were found from the Joe Pool Lake dam north. Survey of
the Cedar Mountain Preserve for the City of Cedar Hill located no prehistoric sites in the
valley or on the slopes and top of the Escarpment (Kent and Skinner 1998). Survey of the
proposed Sunset Ranch development (Skinner 1998) located four prehistoric site deposits
(41EL233-235) on the benches above Hollings Creek downstream from the Hollings
Branch site. Broken large mammal bones were the most common artifacts found in the
midden deposits which ranged from 15 to 30 m in diameter. Additional artifacts included
chert lithic debris and fire-cracked rock. None of these sites were dated but the presence
of charcoal and animal bone should allow for dating and environmental reconstruction.

monograph.

A.D. 700-A.D. 1600
6,000 B.C.-A.D. 700
ca. 11,000 B.C.-6,000 B.C.

Using the above temporal framework, the following paragraphs present a brief
description of the culture history of the area.
The Paleo-Indian period is distinguished by projectile point styles attributed to this
period. Many of the points are made of cherts that are not native to North-Central Texas.
The Lewisville site and the Aubrey Clovis site in Denton County are the only excavated
Paleo-Indian sites in the region (Crook and Harris 1957; Ferring 2001), and both are on
the Elm Fork to the north. Surface artifacts generally come from deposits on stream
terraces above the level of the active floodplain. This is a period when large mammals
became extinct, and their extinction is attributed in part to a general environmental
drying.
During the Early Archaic, the general drying continued, and sites are found on stream
terraces. There is a hint of population increase, and Lynott (1981:103) suggests that there
was increased emphasis on the use of bottomland food resources. Middle Archaic sites
are predominantly found on the first terrace above stream floodplains. As earlier, sites
tend to be along the Elm Fork rather than along the smaller tributaries. The population
density continued to be low. Late Archaic sites increase in number over the previous
period, and sites are located both along the Elm Fork and its tributaries. There appears to
be a strong shift in site location to tributary streams, and a pronounced population
explosion. Within the Elm Fork basin, local Ogallala quartzite was being used
prominently at this time, and this observation is taken by some authors (Skinner 1981;
Prewitt 1983) as evidence of increased territorial constriction. On Mountain Creek, it
appears that the earliest occupation was during the Late Archaic, and that occupation was
only on a seasonal, not year-round basis. Moreover, unlike the Elm Fork and most of
Dallas County, lithics are predominantly cherts which may have been secured to the
southwest near Alvarado (McGregor 1995).
During the Late Prehistoric period, the bow and arrow and pottery appear in artifact
assemblages (Shafer 1977). Houses and evidence of agriculture first appear during this
period, as shown at the Cobb-Pool site. Early Late Prehistoric site locations mirror those
of the Late Archaic, and chert continued as the common material for chipped stone

projectiles and tools within the Mountain Creek basin. The West Fork Paleosol is
tentatively dated to this period, although it has been dated earlier that A.D. 800 in some
places (Ferring 1990). Drying continued into the subsequent period. Buffalo bones are
common in Late Late Prehistoric sites (Dillehay 1974; Lynott 1979; Peter and McGregor
1988a:241), along with tools normally expected to occur at sites on the High Plains.
Protohistoric Native American occupation in the Dallas County is reported by numerous
regional history authors. Very little archaeological evidence of historic Native American
occupation has been found in the area (Peter, Cliff, and Green 1996:2). This pattern of
finding virtually no physical evidence of historic Native American in the form of artifacts
[beads, gun-flints, cooking utensils, etc.] is seen throughout much of North-Central Texas
(Skinner 1988), and has been related to the abandonment of the region in the 1500/1600s
caused by a major regional drought.

CEDAR HILLS STATE PARK SURVEY

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
Based on the information and demographic model contained in the previous chapter as
well as the known presence of site 41DL448 in the bank of Baggett Branch, it was
concluded that buried site deposits were likely to be discovered in the valleys of both
Baggett Branch and John Penn Branch and that these deposits would be shallow, extend
down from the present ground surface, and would be basically recognizable on the
presence of animal bones, mussel shells, and fire-cracked rock. Furthermore, the model
predicts that the location of both creek crossings is near the mouth of the creeks entry into
the Mountain Creek valley sediments. Consequently, it was our prediction that
occupation is more likely at the Baggett Branch crossing than at the John Penn Branch
crossing. Furthermore, it was predicted that occupation is most likely to be found in the
upper two meters due to the fact that pre-Holocene sediments are not likely to be present
in either creek valley.
In order to test these propositions, it was necessary to conduct a pedestrian survey of the
new route in order to inspect the surface and also to explore for buried sediments. It was
planned to excavate two backhoe trenches on either side of each creek but it was
necessary to forego trenches in areas not easily accessible with the backhoe. Shovel
testing was done in a systematic manner at tight intervals in the valleys and wider but
meeting THC standards on the ridge south of John Penn Branch. Fill was screened where
possible but the clay was too wet or blocky for screening and was broken manually and
then carefully inspected.
Backhoe trenching was done using a Case 405 tractor with a reach of 10-12’. The
trenches were stepped in order to allow safe access and the walls were regularly inspected
as the trench proceeded down. Profiles were drawn of each trench using Munsell color
charts and metric rulers.
Samples were collected from the buried hearth in order to secure snail and mussel shells
along with charcoal and bone. The charcoal and ash were dried and sent to Beta Analytic,
Inc. for dating along with the single unidentified large mammal long bone that was
recovered from the ash layer.

RESULTS
Survey began south of Baggett Branch and no evidence of prehistoric occupation was
found on the surface on either side of the creek (Figure 2). The creek was flowing during
the excavation but when first visited in November 2006, the creek bed was dry and
covered with cedar elm leaves. The only water present was standing in a few deeper
pools that were present between the small and rounded limestone gravel that fills the
creek channel. Shovel tests 1-3 were placed in a previously farmed field situated behind
the remnant of a low man-made terrace that was at the edge of the valley floodplain and
served to slow water runoff. A barbed wire fence had been on top of the terrace and old
posts and some wire were present nearby. No cultural materials were found on the
surface or the three shovel tests in this setting which is roughly equivalent in elevation
above the creek to that of the Baggett Branch site. Shovel tests 4 and 5 were placed on a
lower surface that is in the creek bend but again no cultural materials were encountered
despite our augering to a depth of 170 cm. The shallow modern sediments in STs 4 and 5
in the floodplain are lower and younger than those where the Baggett Branch site is
located and are also regularly flooded and reworked during major flood episodes. The
deeper clay sediments, probably those below 60-90 cm, are part of the “bedrock”
sediments that were exposed when the creek eroded into the underlying geology. The
creek channel is just north of ST 5 and the gravel fill in the channel was too deep and
saturated to allow the backhoe to cross.

The south end of Trench 1 (Figure 3) was begun six meters north of the creek at an
elevation approximately a meter and a half higher than the creek. The trench was six
meters long and five strata were uncovered.

Figure 3.

East wall profile of Trench 1.

Stratum I was dark grayish brown (2.5Y4/2) damp clay that was a weak soft fine wedge.
Clay films are common on ped faces and pore linings. The horizon boundary is clear and
smooth. Stratum II is dark grayish brown/olive brown (2.5Y4/3) dry clay that is moderate
to hard with fine subrectangular blocky peds. No clay films were observed. The lower
boundary is clear and smooth. Stratum III is very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2) clay that
is strong and has very fine columnar clay films that are few and very thin on ped faces
only. The lower boundary is clear and smooth. Stratum IV is brown (10YR5/3) c lay with
very hard fine subangular blocky structure and has very fine columnar clay films that are
few and very thin on ped faces only. The lower boundary is clear and smooth. The fifth
stratum is brown (10YR4/3) loamy clay that has hard and fine Subangular blocky
structure. Rounded limestone gravel is at the bottom of the zone and is at least five
centimeters thick.
Site 41DL448 is located just downstream and around the bend from the pipeline route.
The site consists of a buried ash layer that is shown in Figure 4 which is a photograph of
the site profile in Baggett Branch. The upper layer is 106 cm thick and is a brown
(10YR5/3) loam that has sufficient clay content to be dense and also cracked due to the
present drought. No lamination was observable in the profile. No evidence of cultural
material or organic staining was recorded in this upper zone and the occasional piece of
limestone was generally less than 3 cm on a side and was angular. The ash layer was
generally horizontal and extended a distance of 89 cm and was four centimeters thick in

the center but no less than two centimeters thick at the ends. An ash sample was collected
from the center of the lens was radiocarbon dated 320±40 BP [AD 1460 to 1660] (Beta
225641). Likewise, a broken fragmentary large mammal long bone was collected from
the south end of the ash layer and dated 390±40 BP [AD 1440 to 1540] (Beta 225640).
No evidence was noted that an ash-stained occupation/work surface extended to either
side of the ash layer. The loam below the ash layer is first a burned layer that is four
centimeters thick and dark reddish brown (5YR3/3). Below this is a 17 cm thick layer of
dark grayish brown (10YR4/2) loam containing snails and occasional flecks of charcoal.
No cultural materials were noted in this layer nor were any found in a small sample of
soil collected from the profile. The bottom zone is a brown (10YR4/3) clay that is 110 cm
thick and extends to the water level. Limestone gravel is exposed in the creek bed and in
the profile under the clear water but the thickness was not determined. Snail shells from
the ash layer and underlying loam indicate permanent vegetation with a leaf/tree litter.

The site is of unknown size but is exposed in the east bank of a narrow meander that
extends to the south a distance of less than 30 m and then turns back to the north before
turning west again. No other evidence of a buried deposit was observed in the in the
creek bed or in the creek bank. The original pipeline and a dirt road bisect this meander
from the north to the south and have not uncovered any artifacts in eroded areas. Based
on the exposures and Trench 1, the site is no larger than 60-70 m north-south by 40 m.
Unlike the Baggett Branch site, the occupation surface is buried under about a meter of
fill but no evidence of an overlying deposit containing cultural materials was found.
Nevertheless, the ash layer appears to be in an undisturbed stratigraphic position and
based on the ash, charcoal, and bone should be datable and useful for environmental
reconstruction. It is likely that few artifacts would be found if the occupation surface of
the site is uncovered based on the apparent brief occupation that appears to be present.
Survey continued just north of the Talala Trail parking lot and crossed the upland ridge
(Figure 5). This area had formerly been farmed and then had been abandoned and
allowed to revert to brush and treecovered
upland.
No
cultural
materials or evidence of occupation
were found along the route and
shovel testing showed that the
topsoil was relatively thin over the
subsoil and no cultural materials
were encountered. The pipeline route
descends to the John Penn Branch
valley and crosses under the park
road. At this point it will skirt the
edge of the park entry until it
approaches the four way stop
northwest of the park entrance. It
then turns northeast and parallels the
North Spine Road across John Penn
Branch. Trenches 2 and 3 were
placed on the south side of John
Penn Branch. Both trenches were
five meters long and were dug into
the valley subsoil to below 2.5
meters. No cultural materials were
found in either trench fill or in the
scraped walls. The original ground
surface of both trenches had
apparently been removed during the
course of road building or other
previous landuse. The upper 30 cm
of Trench 2 was disturbed yellowish Figure 5.

This same upper clay was not present in the walls of Trench 3.
Due to the flowing creek and the topography and dense tree cover in the valley, it was not
possible to move a backhoe across the creek channel or to bring it in from the north so
STs 10-12 were dug on the elevated surfaces in this area. All three revealed that topsoil
was no longer present and that only the underlying clay subsoil remained. The topsoil had
apparently eroded away. No cultural materials were found in the clay. Trench 4 was six
meters long and was placed north of ST 12. It was excavated into the subsoil to a depth of
2.7 m. The upper 70 cm was loose loamy clay which contained no cultural materials and
which graded into dark brown clay that contained threads of calcium carbonate but no
cultural materials and no distinct stratigraphy. This corresponds to the ST 12 sediment.
In summary, no evidence of prehistoric occupation was found within the proposed
pipeline route where it crosses Baggett Branch and John Penn Branch. Site 41DL448
appears to be a thin, and probably small, site deposit that is buried deeper than the
Baggett Branch site but may be younger in age. Based on what little we know about site
41DL448 and its location adjacent to Baggett Branch, it would appear that the site
represents a camp that was occupied in the fall of the year primarily for the hunting and
processing of deer and the gathering of nuts from bur oak, hickory, and walnut trees
(Skinner et al. 2007). Thus it is possible that similar unrecorded site deposits are closer to
the mouth of the deeply incised tributaries that originate in the White Rock Escarpment
than either the Baggett Branch or Ubil sites.
Most of the topsoil appears to have been eroded away as the result of farming on the top
of the ridge south of John Penn Branch and no artifacts were found on the surface or in
the remaining topsoil. Trenching and shovel testing on both sides of John Penn Branch
revealed that the topsoil had been removed due to clearing, flooding, and farming and no
evidence of prehistoric or historic occupation was uncovered.

CEDAR HILLS STATE PARK SURVEY

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The archaeological survey of select sections resulted in the recording of one new
prehistoric archaeological site (41DL448) as well as the revisiting of the Baggett Branch
site. No evidence of occupation was found in the John Penn Branch valley. Site 41DL448
will be avoided by rerouting the pipeline. In addition, the construction drawings should
include notes instructing the contractor to avoid site 41DL448 which will protect the site
from incidental disturbance.
Site 41DL448 will be affected in the future as the creek continues to erode through
existing fluvial processes unrelated to the proposed pipeline project. The US Army Corps
of Engineers or the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department might want to consider bank
stabilization measures to control the adverse effects of erosion on the site. If the site is
endangered by further development of maintenance of the adjacent park road by the
USACE or TPWD, site 41DL448 should be further defined in order to determine site
significance.
It is our opinion that site 41DL448 is potentially eligible for inclusion in the National
Register of Historic Places since it is an undisturbed deposit which contains organic
materials including charcoal and bone which should allow for further dating and
environmental reconstruction. The Baggett Branch site will not be impacted by rerouting
the pipeline.
