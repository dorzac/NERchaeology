3D Scan Data for Caddo Ceramic Vessels from the
George C. Davis Site (41CE19)
Robert Z. Selden Jr.1, 2 *
Abstract
On June 8, 2015, the intact and reconstructed vessels from the George C. Davis site (41CE19) were scanned
(3D) in advance of an analysis of 3D geometric morphometrics. These data were collected using a Creaform
GoSCAN50 running VXElements via the scanner direct control function in Geomagic Design X. All data
associated with this project are available in Zenodo under a Creative Commons Attribution license, where they
can be downloaded for use in additional projects. These data have the capacity to augment numerous research
designs in the digital humanities and ceramic studies, as well as a wide range of comparative research topics
throughout the American Southeast. The reuse potential for these data is significant.

much of Caddo archaeology [1, 2], and the site represents
one of the best-studied in East Texas. It is a civic-ceremonial
center with three earthen mounds, is estimated to encompass
over 110 acres, and includes over 100 known–or suspected–
structures [3]. Influential studies from this site come from a
variety of analytical domains including ceramics [4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
9, 10, 11], lithics [12, 13, 14, 15], plant remains [16, 17, 18],
architecture [19, 20] and remote sensing [21, 22, 23, 24, 25,
26, 27]. The site is located near the southwestern border of
the Southern Caddo Area (Figure 1), and remains among the
earliest of the known Caddo mound sites.

1. Overview
Research from the George C. Davis site (41NA49), or Caddo
Mounds State Historic Site, has served as the foundation for

Figure 1. Location of the George C. Davis site (41CE19) in

the Southern Caddo Area.

3D Scan Data for Caddo Ceramic Vessels from the George C. Davis Site (41CE19) — 2/8

Additional cultural resource management (CRM) undertakings at the site [28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 11, 35, 36, 37,
38, 39] represent the substantial record of investigations that
are ongoing. We continue to learn more about the archaeology
of the George C. Davis site; however, we should do more with
our projects to advance the evolution of archaeological praxis
and theory [40].
The addition of analytical approaches that employ 3D
meshes (Figure 2) helps, in this case, to advance discussions
of shape variations that occur among ceramic artifacts [41, 42],
many components of which are difficult–if not impossible–to
characterize using traditional orthogonal approaches [43, 44].
These attributes can be couched within a variety of theoretical
frameworks [45, 46, 47]. While the production of 3D data are
labor and time-intensive (although see [48]), the benefits can
be seen in their contribution to conservation [49], participatory
digital archaeology [50], and dynamic illustrations [51, 52].

nodes (vessel forms in red; types in blue) and text scaled

(even those not intact or reconstructed [3]) were used to
generate this graph.

1.2 Spatial Coverage
Cherokee County, Texas
1.3 Temporal Coverage
There are a total of 115 radiocarbon dates available for the
George C. Davis site that have been reported [53], compiled
[54], and recalibrated [55] (Figure 4). The site most regularly articulates with Formative and Early Caddo (ca. A.D.
900-1200) periods in East Texas. Those dates that articulate
with the mounds and other known contexts for those vessels
discussed herein will be used to augment additional analyses.

figure that can be rotated, measured and otherwise quantified.
To activate the figure, this article must be downloaded to your
computer. Activate the figure by clicking on the image, then
click/drag to rotate.
A preliminary synthesis of the vessels can be accomplished through the analysis of networks extrapolated from
qualitative attributes associated with vessel form and type [3],
where the various nodes can be scaled proportional to the
number of samples associated with each (Figure 3). While
additional network-based analyses are currently underway,
this graph illustrates the contributions of the various Caddo
vessel forms and types present at the George C. Davis site.
1.1 Context
While the context of the vessels is discussed in detail elsewhere [3], an abbreviated listing is included in Table 1.

2. Methods
All whole or reconstructed vessels were scanned with a Creaform
GoSCAN50 running VXElements 4.1 via the scanner direct
control function in Geomagic Design X 2015.2.0. Upon completion of scanning each vessel, the texture (color) layer was
removed pursuant to guidance by the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma that no texture data be made publicly accessible without
the express written permission of the Tribe. The uniform
color scan data were saved as ASCII.ply files prior to postprocessing [56, 57].
2.1 Steps
To align each scan, a reference vector (revolving axis) was
inserted, followed by a reference point at the confluence of
the vector and the mesh (using a projection) at the central
base. Region groups were then used to define the basal plane.
All three elements (vector, point and plane) of reference geometry were then utilized in an interactive alignment, with
the reference plane as the moving plane, the reference vector
as the moving vector, and the reference point as the moving
point (Figure 5). Alignment has proven to be an important
factor in downstream analyses, particularly when making the
transition from Design X and Control to SolidWorks or other
CAD-based platform [58].
Post-processing of each 3D mesh began with the healing wizard function in Design X, which corrects problematic
issues with non-manifold poly-vertices, folded poly-faces,
dangling poly-faces, small clusters, small poly-faces, nonmanifold poly-faces, crossing poly-faces, and small tunnels.
After these issues were corrected, the global remesh function
was used to render the final mesh. When post-processing was

illustrating the reference geometry (reference vector, point
and plane–in green) used to align the mesh.

complete, each mesh was decimated by 50 percent prior to
saving then exporting each as an ASCII.ply. Decimation of
the mesh decreases file size while increasing ease of use on
standard computers.
A digital photograph of each vessel was taken with a Sony
RX1R camera, then saved as a .jpg, which appears alongside
each 3D mesh. Since dissemination of the texture file for the
3D mesh is prohibited by the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma, the
digital photography provides a color proxy.
2.2 3D Cardboard Puzzles
In addition to the 3D models, two 3D cardboard puzzles
were created (for TARL 41CE19 2006-4-84 [59] and TARL
41CE19 424-21 [60]) to augment the on-site efforts of the interpretive staff by providing a physical model through which
visitors can interact with the digital proxy. These cardboard
puzzles were generated using Autodesk 123D Make [61], and
the plans for the cardboard puzzles (Figure 6) accompanied
the uploads to Zenodo. Those plans can be downloaded, cut,
glued to cardboard, then cut out to create a tangible model
of a Caddo vessel. These files were uploaded to Zenodo in
.pdf format, and are compatible with most laser cutters where
they can be cut out using variety of mediums in addition to
cardboard.

4. Reuse Potential
Those data from this project have long-term and wide-ranging
reuse potential, of which many applications may (likely) not
yet have been contemplated. While the primary purpose of
this endeavor was to document the vessels in advance of a 3D
geometric morphometrics study [41, 42, 79], two of these have
since been modeled as 3D puzzles that can be cut out using
materials that are easily acquired by most (i.e., a cardboard
box).
These data have significant reuse potential in the digital
humanities where they can augment more qualitative studies
of decorative designs and motifs. They also hold promise
for clarifying questions of vessel shape and form that can
be addressed in analyses of asymmetry and 3D geometric
morphometrics.
