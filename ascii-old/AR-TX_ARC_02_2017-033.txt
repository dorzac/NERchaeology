ABSTRACT
Harris County Precinct 2 is planning to construct the Atascocita Park on a 19-acre
tract in northwest Harris County, Texas. The project area is located 1.4 km west of
Lake Houston and contains a 2-acre pond. Additionally, the project area is located
in a setting determined to have moderate potential for containing shallowly buried
prehistoric site deposits. Historic aerial photograph reviews identified a potential
historic structure prior to survey. Halff Associates, Inc. contracted with AR
Consultants, Inc. (ARC) to conduct an intensive pedestrian cultural resources
survey of the entire tract. The survey was done on April 5, 2017. A total of 12
shovel test locations were visited, eight of which were excavated, during the survey
and all were negative. The other four were inundated. Much of the southern and
western parts of the tract was inundated at the time of survey. Site 41HR1194, a
steel-beamed structure that was converted into a residential structure, was recorded
in the southeast part of the tract. AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that the site is
ineligible for National Register of Historic Properties and/or State Antiquities
Landmark listing under all criteria. No other cultural resources were encountered.
Given the results of this survey, ARC recommends that further cultural resource
investigations within the project area are unwarranted and requests that the Texas
Historical Commission concur with this recommendation. Project documents will
be curated at the Center for Archaeological Studies, Texas State University, San
Marcos.

INTRODUCTION
Harris County Precinct 2 is planning to construct a new park on a 19-acre tract in Harris County,
Texas (Figure 1). The Atascocita Park tract is located between W. Lake Houston Parkway and the
Missouri Pacific Railroad immediately west of Lake Houston. It is to be developed into a natural
and passive recreational park that will include amenities such as walking paths, trails, and a lighted
parking lot. The focal point of the park will be the 2-acre pond on the east side of the project area.
The park is named after the Atascocita Road which was established in the early 1700s by the
Spanish as a military highway to East Texas and is located less than two miles north of the
proposed park location. Halff Associates, Inc., which is handling the environmental permitting and
design for the project, contracted with AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) to conduct an archaeological
survey of the proposed park area.
The cultural resource investigation was required because Harris County Precinct 2 is a political
entity of the state of Texas. Texas Antiquities Permit Number 7970 was issued for the
archaeological survey. Fieldwork was conducted on April 5, 2017. Relevant legislation includes
the Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas Natural Resource Code, Title 9, Chapter 191). The
Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission (THC) will review this report on behalf
of the State. This report is written in accordance with report guidelines used by the Archeology
Division of the THC (Council of Texas Archeologists n.d.). The following report presents a brief
description of the natural setting of the project area, followed by a discussion of the regional culture
history and previous investigations within the study area. A chapter on the research design and
methodology employed in the investigation is then followed by the results of the field
investigation. The report concludes with recommendations followed by the references cited.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF ATASCOCITA PARK

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The project area is in east Harris County within the Northern Humid Gulf Coastal Plain ecoregion
(Griffith et al. 2007). This province, which lies within the Western Gulf Coastal Plain, is almost
completely level but rises gently in elevation from the Gulf Coast towards the interior of the state.
Furthermore, it includes the entire Texas Gulf coast and is the largest physiographic unit found in
the state (Mercado-Allinger et al. 1996:51). Historical vegetation in the region generally consisted
of tall grass grasslands with few clusters of maritime woodlands (Griffith et al. 2007:74). The
region has undergone significant alteration related to human occupation including the impacts of
fire, livestock grazing, and, more recently, urbanization (Griffith et al. 2007:74). The region
contained a very diverse animal population that included bison, pronghorn antelope, and whitetailed deer and is still home to a large, diverse bird and waterfowl population (Griffith et al.
2007:75). The project area lies 1.4 km west of Lake Houston and contains a large ponde.
It is thought that the geology of the Coastal Plain is closely linked to the waxing and waning of
middle to late-Pleistocene glaciations. This means that as one moves inland from the shoreline, the
Coastal Plain is made up of progressively older sedimentary deposits (Mercado-Allinger et al.
1996:53). The project area, located 55 miles northwest of the Gulf, overlies the relatively young,
late-Pleistocene-aged Beaumont Formation (Bureau of Economic Geology 1975). This formation
mainly includes deposits of sand, silt, and clay with very minor siliceous gravels. The surface of
the formation is generally level with frequent shallow ponded depressions (Abbott 2001:15-16).
The majority of the project area is characteristic of Holocene-aged alluvial, eolian, or colluvial
veneer deposits underlain by Pleistocene landforms (Abbott 2001:156).
Gessner fine sandy loams with 0 to 1-percent slopes are mapped in the entirety of the project area
(Wheeler 1976: Sheet 48). The Gessner A horizon is 10 centimeters thick and consists of dark
grayish brown to grayish brown fine sandy loam above 54 centimeters of grayish brown fine sandy
loam B horizons. These are underlain by grayish brown sandy clay loam subsoil.

CULTURAL HISTORY
The project area is located in the southwestern portion of the Southeast Texas archaeological
region, as defined by Perttula (2004:7). A prehistoric chronology, based on Ricklis (2004) is
presented below to provide a temporal framework for the culture history of the Southeast Texas
region as contained in this section of the report.

5000 B.C. to 1000 B.C.
6000 B.C. to 5000 B.C.
9500 B.C. to 6000 B.C.

The earliest widely-accepted human occupation in Texas began in the Paleoindian period (9500
B.C. to 6000 B.C.), a period characterized in part by small, mobile bands of hunters that utilized
distinctive fluted Clovis projectile points. Currently nine such points have been reported from
Harris County (Bever and Meltzer 2007:68). In addition to Clovis points, Folsom, Midland, Dalton
San Patrice, Plainview, Scottsbluff, and Angostura points have been recovered from sites in
Southeast Texas and Harris County (Patterson 1995:251). Plant foods and small game likely
supplemented the Paleoindian diet (Patterson 1995; Ricklis 2004:184). Generally, inland
Paleoindian sites are located along major drainages. Due to an absence of well-stratified or single
component sites, the Paleoindian period is poorly defined in Southeast Texas, though it seems
clear that there was widespread movement of people and material goods based on the recovery of
points made out of lithic material that is not native to southeast Texas.
The transition to the Archaic period (6000 B.C. to A.D. 400) followed the demise of Pleistocene
megafauna and a shift to a more xeric climate at the onset of the Holocene. Subsistence, settlement
patterns, and stone tool technology shifted as populations began to focus more on local resources.
This increased reliance on local resources suggests decreased group mobility, and conceivably,
more tightly defined group territories (Story 1985:44-47). The appearance of group cemeteries
during the Archaic has been interpreted as an expression of territoriality and group identity. As
with the Paleoindian period, the Early and Middle Archaic periods are poorly known
archaeologically but there is substantial evidence of seasonal scheduling at Late Archaic sites in
southeastern Texas (Ricklis 2004:187-188). This adaptation coincided with a general growth in
population toward the end of the Late Archaic.
The appearance of ceramics in the Galveston Bay area as early as A.D. 400 preceded the adoption
of ceramics throughout most of Southeast Texas around A.D. 500 (Perttula et al. 1995). Goose
Creek Plain, Punctated, and Incised are sand-tempered pottery types commonly found during the
Early Ceramic period, and several other types of decorated varieties and tempering materials have
been identified (Patterson 1995; Perttula et al. 1995). Caddoan pottery from East Texas is found
during the period between A.D. 1000 and A.D. 1300 and may be a sign of extra-regional trade or

migration (Aten 1983). The bow and arrow appeared during the Ceramic period and undoubtedly
had some impact upon hunting strategies. In terms of subsistence strategies, the innovations of the
Ceramic period appear to have served to increase efficiency of food production, but did little to
alter major lifeways (Ricklis 2004:189).
Contact between Native Americans and early explorers may have begun as early as 1529, when
Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca traveled up the San Jacinto River to trade with the natives (Henson
2013). Though various French and Spanish traders may have passed through what is now Harris
County, none settled there. In 1824, some settlers moved to the San Jacinto estuary, falsely
assuming it was part of Stephen F. Austin’s empresario grant. Two years later John R. Harris
established Harrisburg on Buffalo Bayou and opened a store and saw and grist mill. Soon after,
the area became a hub of land and water transportation. As the area became more heavily explored,
and tentative settlement began, European diseases began to have an impact on the health of the
Native Americans. Ultimately, disease and other privations resulting from European incursion
reduced or eliminated the indigenous populations (Ewers 1973).
In 1839, Harris County, as it is designated today, was formed. The population continued to grow
in the mid-1800s because of the transportation industry (railroads, water routes, and roads) spurred
by the cotton and sugar industries that were thriving in Texas (Henson 2010). After the
development of the cattle industry in Texas, cattle drivers would follow the Opelousas Road from
South Texas to New Orleans (Kemp 2010). This road was also known as La Bahia Road, which
was the eastern extension of the historic Atascosita Road. Atascosita Road was established in the
early 1700s by the Spanish as a military highway to East Texas. This historic road followed the
route of present-day FM1960 and is less than two miles north of the current project area.
Previous Investigations
A search of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) shows that several archaeological
investigations have been conducted near the study area but no recorded National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) properties, neighborhood surveys, historical markers, cemeteries, or
archaeological sites are within the project area (2017). Since 1988, several block and linear surveys
have been conducted in the surrounding area for TxDOT and USACE-Galveston, though none
were conducted inside of, or within a mile of, the project area. Most of these surveys resulted in
negative findings. However, a few archaeological sites of interest and proximity along the shores
of Lake Houston are discussed below.
In 2001, James Abbott, a Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) archaeologist, put
together a Potential Archeological Liability Map (PALM) for the Houston area. The PALM is the
result of a GIS-based predictive model of the apparent geoarchaeological potential throughout the
Houston-area highway district. According to the PALM data, the project area lies within Map Unit
2 (Abbott 2001:Figure 65). Abbott recommends that areas mapped as Unit 2 warrant surface
survey, including shovel tests, but that no deep reconnaissance is required. This is due to the low
to moderate evidence of disturbance of the Holocene deposits and the fact that those deposits rest
on Pleistocene landforms (2001:156).
Three prehistoric archaeological sites are located within 5 miles of the project area: 41HR571,
41HR1092, and 41HR1165. These are significant because of their location relative to Lake

Houston; 41HR571 and 41HR1092 are directly on the shoreline/partially under water and
41HR1165 is two miles west of the shoreline. The current project area is just one mile west of the
Lake Houston shoreline. The first prehistoric site, 41HR571, is located on the edge of a large
housing development about 2.3 miles south of the current project area and is dated from the
Paleoindian to Late Prehistoric period based on artifacts retrieved by collectors. The artifact
assemblage is extensive with ceramics and many varieties of tools including Plainview,
Scottsbluff, and San Patrice dart points. The second prehistoric site, 41HR1092, is located in a
wooded area 1.6 miles south of the current project area. Four artifacts, including one Goose Creek
pottery sherd and three pieces of debitage were identified during pedestrian survey and shovel
testing. The third prehistoric site, 41HR1165, dates to the Clovis period, and is located 2.5 miles
northwest of the project area. This site is also located on the edge of a housing development on
Lake Houston. Survey recovered 24 artifacts (mostly tools) including 2 fluted Clovis point bases,
an adze, and a gorget.
In addition to a review of previous archaeological investigations, historic maps and aerials were
reviewed prior to field work. The 1916 Harmaston 7.5’ USGS map and the 1936 and 1957 Harris
County General Highway Maps were reviewed as well as historic aerials dating back to 1944. The
review of the maps did not identify any historic structures or sites within the project area. However,
a structure appears on the south side of the pond in 1966 and corresponds to modifications to the
pond which include the construction of two earthen berms on the north and south sides of the pond
and an accumulation of dirt in the middle of the pond. After the 1976 aerial, the structure is difficult
to see on aerials until 2002, but this is likely due to the resolution of the photos and the density of
the wooded area. W. Lake Houston Parkway does not appear in the area until sometime between
1995 and 2002. Prior to its construction, the project area was relatively undeveloped and densely
forested.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
Research Design
Based on the research conducted prior to survey, two hypotheses were developed. First, it was
hypothesized that there was moderate potential for encountering prehistoric sites in the project
area. The study area is underlain by Gessner series soils which Abbott (2001:23) identifies as
having low to moderate geoarchaeological potential for containing prehistoric cultural resources
since it is an ancient alluvium that developed prior to human populations inhabiting the area.
Potential for prehistoric resources in the project area is related to its proximity to Lake Houston
(formerly the San Jacinto River). Prehistoric sites in this region are typically located within a mile
of major creeks, or their tributaries, where food, water, and other resources would be more readily
available. The project area’s distance from the former river channel provides moderate potential
for encountering temporary-use sites. These would likely be ephemeral, shallowly buried, and
easily found through shovel testing and would likely constitute small lithic scatters resulting from
expedient tool-making.
The second hypothesis states that there was high potential for encountering historic sites in the
project area. One structure was definitively identified in the project area on aerials from 1966, but
is not shown on historic USGS or general highway maps. Given that the area was essentially
undeveloped until sometime between the late ‘90s to early ‘00s, it is unlikely that historic trash
scatters will be identified within the project area, though there may be some associated with the
historic structure.
Methodology
Survey was conducted in accordance with the standards set forth by the THC (n.d.). Field personnel
excavated one shovel test for every two acres where the slope was less than 20-percent, the ground
visibility less than 30-percent, and the ground was not inundated. Shovel tests (STs) averaged 30
centimeters in diameter. All sandy and loamy soils were screened through ¼ inch wire mesh
screens. The clay fill was inspected visually and broken into smaller chunks in order to determine
if cultural materials were present. ST soil matrices were described on the basis of composition,
texture, and color. The Munsell Soil Color Chart (2009) was used to identify soil colors. Field
personnel made notes about the ground exposure, drainages, soil types, and disturbed areas where
subsoil was exposed. Photographs were taken during the survey using a 16-megapixel, GPSequipped digital camera. ST and project boundary locations were marked with a handheld GPS
receiver.

RESULTS
This chapter is divided into two sections. The first describes the natural setting of the project area
along with results of the pedestrian survey. Conclusions derived from the survey close the chapter.
Shovel tests are described generally throughout the text and detailed in Table 1 at the end of the
Survey Results section.
Survey Results
A total of 12 shovel test locations were visited of which, eight shovel tests (STs) were excavated
within the proposed park area during survey (Figure 2). The other four were inundated. All of the
shovel tests were negative. The structure identified in aerial photos, along with two associated
outbuildings, were encountered on the south side of the pond, but no other cultural resources were
identified on the surface or revealed in the shovel tests. Survey began in the northern part of the
tract. General vegetation in this area of the tract, and for much of the rest of the tract, was new
growth forest with interspersed old growth trees (Figure 3). There were ankle to hip high grasses
and piles of felled trees. The tract was logged as there were many stumps in the project area.
Additionally, there were many areas that were inundated (Figure 4). In general, the northern half
of the tract was less inundated than the southern half, though there were pockets of inundation
between STs 8 and 10. The south and western parts of the tract were almost entirely inundated
with at least an inch or more of water. The shovel tests generally revealed a thin top layer of dark
grayish brown sandy loam underlain by brownish yellow and gray mottled sandy clay.
An overgrown shell two-track road was identified in the southern part of the tract and leads to and
passes immediately north of the structure identified on the aerials and the large pond that dominates
much of the eastern part of the tract. The two-track road continues past the pond. There is a large
berm that starts at the southern end of the pond and wraps around its east side. There is also an
island in the middle of the pond. Much of the boundary of the pond appears to have been artificially
modified at some point. Additionally, the landscape around the road appears to have been raised
in order to keep the road from becoming inundated.

41HR1194
41HR1194 is a 26 m N/S by 14 m E/W historic site that consists of a structure that is a 35x40 foot
steel-beam framed, corrugated metal gabled roof building with a concrete floor and two vinyl
sided, wood framed outbuildings (Figure 6). The southern third of the structure has been converted
into a four-room residential area with a bathroom, kitchen, and two bedrooms. This part of the
structure has vinyl siding, drop ceilings, and is wood-framed (Figures 5 and 7). The bedrooms and
kitchen have wood paneled walls and the entire residential area is wired for electricity (Figure 8).
The bathroom includes a sink, shower, and toilet and there is a septic tank located just outside the
structure that would have attached to the toilet. The northern part of the structure is one large, open
room with variably sized wood-framed, multi-paned windows essentially creating walls of
windows along the length of the north side of the structure and half the length of the east side
(Figure 9). Three wood framed doors with windows were standing against the east wall, but have
been removed from their original locations. The northern part of the west side of the structure is
completely open (Figure 10). There is an approximately 10x20-foot raised rectangle of concrete
in the center of the room that appears to have been added as part of the structure’s conversion. It
is unclear for what this large, northern room was used. Approximately 10 feet behind the large
structure are two wood-framed, vinyl-sided outbuildings. The building off the southwest corner of
the main structure houses a possible well (Figure 11). The building off the southeast corner of the
main structure may have housed the Reda Submergible pump that is currently located outside its
south wall (Figure 12). Given that the vinyl siding on the outbuildings is the same as that on the
residential part of the large structure, it seems they were built at the same time the structure was
converted. The area in the immediate vicinity of the outbuildings is currently inundated. Two STs
(11 and 12) were excavated in locations that were not inundated or in the road and both were
negative. They revealed the same profiles as the STs described earlier.
Aerial photos clearly show the presence of the steel-beam structure in 1966. The frame
infrastructure is composed of 18-inch standing steel I-beams anchored in a concrete pad and
supporting steel I-beams that create the roof supports and shape. All of the walls, including the
windows along the north and east sides of the steel structure, were built inside of the structure as
part of its conversion into a residential complex. In other words, the purpose of the original steel
structure is unknown as any evidence as to what it was used for before its conversion into a
residential complex was lost during the conversion. None of the rooms in the residential complex
appear to be original to the interior of the structure. Instead, they were constructed during the
conversion.
The footprint of the structure matches the anomaly identified on the 1966 aerial photograph. There
was no clear evidence that the structure is more than 50 years old. The original purpose of the
structure is unclear, but the renovations made it habitable, though without diagnostic artifacts or
construction techniques it is not possible to know when those renovations occurred. The sites lacks
diagnostic associated artifacts and/or constructions techniques. Deeds research traced the history
of the property back to 1964, but could not trace property ownership beyond that due to illegibility
of the scanned deeds records at the Harris County clerk’s office. The property was sold by Robert
A. Long to W.D. Doyle in 1964. The Doyle family sold the property to Johnson-Loggins, Inc. in
1973. The property changed hands between several development groups until it was sold to Victor

Manon and Manfred Quentel in 1997. Manon and Quentel sold to Harris County Precinct 2 in
February 2017. The steel beam structure was built while W.D. Doyle owned the property. Doyle
is not a significant person of the past. Aerial photos from 1962-1976 show the development and
ultimate abandonment of the property. During this period, the pond was modified in ways that led
to its current footprint and at least the steel-beam structure was built. Aerial photos also narrow
the construction of the steel-beam structure to sometime between 1962 and 1966 and at least one
of the outbuildings (the one off the southwest corner) to sometime between 1966 and 1976. As
noted earlier, it is unclear when the conversions within the structure were made, and subsequently,
when the outbuildings were constructed, but we hypothesize it occurred at some point between
1966 and 1976. The construction materials, vinyl siding and this specific wood paneling, are mass
produced construction materials that are consistent with 1960s and 1970s residential construction
and consistent with our hypothesis for when the conversion occurred. Given that the structure, and
its renovations, are 51 years old or less and that they appear not to represent unique construction
or fulfill any of criteria A, B, or D, ARC recommends that the site is not eligible for listing on the
NRHP as it does not fulfill any of. Additionally, ARC does not recommend the site for SAL
designation because it does not meet any of criteria 1-5 under TAC Rule 26.10.

Conclusions
Only one cultural resource site (structures, features, or artifacts) was found during the survey of
the proposed Atascocita Park project area. In terms of prehistoric resources, no evidence of
occupation was found in the study area. This is likely the result of the fact that the area had low
potential for containing prehistoric cultural resources. The expectation was that if there were
prehistoric cultural resources in the study area, they would be recovered from very shallow depths
given the shallow A horizon soils in the study area and the lack of consistent soil deposition on the
ground surface. As expected, one historic cultural resource was identified in the study area. Site
41HR1194 is a 35x40 converted steel-beam structure with two wood-framed, vinyl-sided
outbuildings. No artifacts were recovered from two shovel tests near the structure and much of the
area to its south and east was inundated, while its north side is bounded by a shell two-track road.
The site is not recommended eligible for NRHP listing or SAL designation.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The purpose of this investigation was to determine if significant cultural resources are present
within the proposed Atascocita Park project area in Harris County, Texas. Despite the fact that
41HR1194 was identified as part of the survey, it is ARC's conclusion that the project area does
not contain any significant cultural resources. ARC recommends that 41HR1194 is ineligible for
NRHP and/or SAL listing because it does not meet any of the listing criteria. ARC concludes that
further cultural resources investigations are unwarranted within the proposed project area and
recommends that the Texas Historical Commission concur with this assessment. However, if
buried cultural materials are discovered during construction, the Archeology Division of the Texas
Historical Commission should be notified.
