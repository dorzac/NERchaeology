SOME IMPLICATIONS OF THE CARBON-14
DATES FROM A CAVE IN COAHUILA,
MEXIC0 1
WALTER

w. TAYLOR

When I first began to work in Coahuila, back in 1937, I told
myself that, if ever any fluted points turned up in my
excavations, I would quickly cover them up and backfill
the trench. I had no desire to get into the "my-site-is-olderthan-yours" argument, principally, I suppose, because I
found myself interested in culture, not age.
Fortunately, our work in Coahuila did not put this resolve
to the test. We found sites that were fabulously rich; we
obtained masses of objects and information for cultural
studies; and nothing appeared that would indicate we were
dealing with Ancient Man. We realized, of course, that our
material was reasonably old, specifically that there were
similarities to allegedly ancient complexes from the Oregon
caves, from Lovelock and Gypsum caves, from the lithic
assemblages found on the California deserts, from the
Cochise of Arizona. But there seemed nothing that could
cause any real excitement among our elephant-hunting colleagues.
In fact, we pursued our cultural studies blissfully unencumbered by Time of any sort. There were no ceramics to
compare; there were no tree-rings to precision our sequences;
there were no raised beaches, no glacial moraines, and, of
course, no thoughts of cosmically contaminated carbon. We
could study nature and culture with no thought for Time,
except that represented by our one to two or more meters of
stratigraphy.
However, there were two small but persistent clouds that
marred this serene horizon. First, there were those pesky
similarities to ancient desert complexes. Then, there was

Anthropological Association at Santa Monica, California, on December 30th, 1956.

definite evidence, from the cave deposits themselves, that
during the time of their deposition there had been a rather
marked climatic change toward aridity. These disturbing
possibilities were sustained by the geologists who, in the adjacent regions across the Rio Grande and in the American
Southwest, had postulated two possibly pertinent periods
of aridity, both of considerable antiquity; the earlier at
about 6000 years before the present, and the later at about
4000 years ago (Albritton and Bryan, 1939; Hack, 1942).
Could it be that our cultural materials and the indicated
climatic change might be of such an age? Did we, after
all, have Ancient Man? We thought about all this, but with
the information and techniques available at that time, the
problem was largely academic. We continued our cultural
studies, happy in our wealth of strictly cultural data of
whatever age.
Then came Carbon-14. Of course, the record had to be
complete, and Time was part of that record-so we submitted a request that some of our material be run. Mention
was made of the possibility of considerable age, noting
specifically the climatic change and the possibly pertinent
geological dates. However, it seems that the authorities
did not believe in those possibilities. We were told to hold
our specimens for a later time when attention would be
focused on "more recent levels in the cultural picture." And
so we went happily back to our cultural studies.
But the damage had been done. The camel of Time had
his nose inside the tent. Carbon-14 offered possibilities
which strictly comparative methods of dating had not presented. Furthermore, if our finds were indeed old, I supposed that I had better know about it because, among other
things, the wealth of detail and the quantitative exuberance
possessed by our collections would, if of an ancient age, add
greatly to our knowledge of culture development in America.
Another request was submitted, this time to the University
of Michigan Memorial-Phoenix Project Radiocarbon Laboratory. Thanks to Drs. J. B. Griffin and H. R. Crane, our
samples were accepted.

A little over a year ago, dates began to come back-and
with them the camel of Time came completely into the tent!
It seems that in Coahuila we not only have Ancient Man,
but we have what appear at this writing to be the two oldest
dated human artifacts in the Western Hemisphere.
There are 11 dates, all from site CM-68, Frightful Cave,
which is situated in the Cuatro Cienegas basin of central
Coahuila, the Mexican state which lies just south of the Big
Bend of Texas (Fig. 18). Four of these dates have been
published (Crane, 1956); the others have been provided in
correspondence. All dates are derived from human artifacts
or biofacts, the latter being human feces (Table 1).
It is seen that all dates are stratigraphically consistent
except two obtained on wood remnants from the middle
level, which are older than any date from the bottom level.
There is no evidence to indicate what caused this inconsistency, but it may be suggested that in deposits such as those
of Frightful Cave, secondary deposition would not be surprising. It should be remembered, however, that whether
or not their stratigraphic position can be accounted for, the
oldest dates were derived from artif·a cts and therefore date
artifacts.

These dates, of course, have been and are still difficult to
believe. I have gone to the Michigan radiocarbon laboratory
to ask questions. But nothing has come up to throw doubt
either on these samples or on the counting techniques. Contingent upon checking, which is being done at present in
Denmark, it appears that the dates will just have to be
accepted as they stand.
What, then, are the implications of the age and the nature
of the cultural materials from Frightful Cave? Before discussing a few of these, it will be well to give a brief description of the Coahuila environment and of the cultural
materials themselves.
The northern half of the State of Coahuila, where our
work has been concentrated, is an arid land belonging physiographically to the Sierra Madre Oriental. The western

* This series of rosettes was a typological sample derived from
all three levels of the site. However, it is known from its distribut ion and fr equency in this and ot her Coahuila sites that the type
is a r elatively late one. In Frightful Cave, 2 per cent came from the
bott om level, 34 per cent from the middle, and 63 p er cent from the
top level. In site CM-24, Fat Burro Cave, it was found in associat ion with stone projectile points known to have been in vogue as
late as around 1400 A. D.
** Due to the accidental inclusion of one specimen from the
b ott om level in this sample, it was possible that this date was
derived either from that one bottom-level specimen alone or from
a combination of that specimen w ith others from the middle level.
Therefore a check-run was made on a definitely m iddle-level specim en from the same sample. The result w as the date 9300 + - 400

portion of the area, however, exhibits a typical Basin and
Range topography with abrupt fault-block mountains and
r ather narrow alluvial basins, both trending generally northwest-southeast. Vegetrationally and climatically, except for
the higher elevations, it belongs to the Chihuahua Desert
province.
Culturally , our data reveal what I have no hesitation in
calling a variety of the generic culture of Arid America.
Recently, Jennings and Norbeck (1955) have formally named

220

Texas Archeological Society

a part of this culture the Desert Culture. With confidence,
then, I hereby extend Jennings' concept into Mexico. I
am convinced that throughout Arid America, and probably
extending into the Ozarks and possibly into the sheltered
sites and shell mounds of eastern United States, as far back
as our present data take us, there have been phrasings of
this basic culture. Characteristic of it are such traits as the
atlatl, large oval and stemmed (but not fluted) projectile
points, the grooved club, the absence of grooved axes and
celts, the metate and mano, net carrying frame and/ or conical burden basket, fiber sandals, both twined and coiled
basketry (the latter probably somewhat the later of the
two types), plaited matting, fur cloth, twisted fiber cordage,
considerable (if not primary at first) dependence upon
vegetal foods but no agriculture, migratory habits and temporary (probably seasonal) occupation of sites, and small
(probably patrilineal) socio-political groups. Within this
basic and widespread culture, the culture of Coahuila is one
of a number of already recognized variants, neither marginal
nor aberrant, but probably representing as typical' and full
an expression as has been uncovered to date.
Detailed and thorough studies of cultural relationships
have not as yet been made for our Coahuila materials, but
it is certain that they are closely related to those identified
as the Pecos River Focus in the Big Bend of Texas immediately to the north across the Rio Grande (Martin, 1933;
Pearce and Jackson, 1933; Kelley, Campbell and Lehmer,
1940, p. 24 ff.). To be sure, there are differences, for example,
of subsistence economy, of techniques of manufacture, of
proportional representation of identical or similar traits.
But these differences are not large, nor are they very
numerous in comparison to the similarities. Certainly, the
two cultural complexes are phrasings of a single basic culture, and closely related phrasings at that. What these conclusions mean in terms of chronology is difficult to say
at this moment. It is my hunch that the Pecos River Focus
cave-sites that have been excavated so far are no earlier
than Frightful Cave and probably would date a little later

than our earliest material, but this does not mean that some
earlier Pecos River Focus sites may not yet be found. From
a climatological point of view, it is very possible that the
desiccation evident in the deposits of Frightful Cave is
reflected in the erosion cycle which has been demonstrated
to lie between the Neville and Calamity formations in the
Big Bend (Albritton and Bryan, 1939, p. 1462 ff.; Kelley,
Campbell, and Lehmer, 1940, p. 131 ff.). Or it might be
better to say that this period of erosion marked the beginning
of a long period of aridity which, in fact, has not ended
today in that general area. In any event, I believe that our
Coahuila dates and the similarity of the Coahuila material
to that from the Pecos River Focus make it very probable
that the latter cultural complex has an even greater antiquity
than has been heretofore suspected (Kelley, 1947, p. 105).
I should, perhaps, say something about the amount of cultural material with which we have to work-! refer here
only to that from our dated site, Frightful Cave, of which
only about 55 per cent was excavated. The collection is
large, probably larger than any comparably old collection
in the Western Hemisphere. There are approximately 1000
artifacts from the bottom level, of which about 950 are of
fiber and wood. There are about 1600 artifacts from the
middle level, and only about 50 of these are of imperishable material. There are over 2100 artifacts from the top
level, of which more than 2000 are of so-called perishable
material.
Of course, these figures do not include what I have called
the cultural matrix and the cultural refuse (Taylor, 1948, p.
182 ff.). Our complete catalog has never been precisely
totaled, but a conservative estimate would place it in the
neighborhood of 9000 specimens. I should add that this
estimate does not include over 20,000 typed and counted
quids, the previous reporting of which has given my colleagues such a kick (Taylor, 1948, p. 172 ff.) .
In other words, we have from Frightful Cave an unusually
complete and numerous collection-especially so in view of

224

Texas ArcheoLogicaL Society

the determined age. Or perhaps it would be better to say
that, despite their age, the remains from Frightful Cave
present an opportunity to construct cultural contexts in
considerably more detail than is possible in most aboriginal
sites, even those of lesser age. From my own point of view,
this fact makes the absolute age of the deposits a somewhat
secondary factor in assessing their value.
But all is not sweetness and light. There are rather large
problems, one of which concerns the natural environment,
particularly the fauna, existing at the time of the cave's
first occupation. In the bottom level, we are presumably
dealing with a time somewhere between 8 and 10 thousand
years ago. At that time, in areas not far distant to the north,
there still lived a Pleistocene fauna including elephant,
horse, camel, tapir, ground sloth and others. However, in
Frightful Cave, out of the over 2000 identified mammal
bones, not a single one was identified as from an extinct
species. We do have animals represented which are no
longer found in Ooahuila, nor as far south, nor at as low an
elevation as the Cienegas Basin, but which nevertheless are
still extant. I refer to our specimens of bison, grizzly bear,
elk, and yellow-haired porcupine (Gilmore, 1947), and to the
land-snail Humboldtiana (Drake, 1951). The remains of
these species either disappear or diminish as the deposits
rise in the cave, thus indicating, together with similar circumstances in certain floral species, a climatic change from
cooler and more moist to warmer and drier.
But why are there no extinct forms? Elephants and other
now-extinct fauna have been found in Coahuila-and very
near Frightful Cave. Are we to assume that by about 9000
years ago the Pleistocene fauna had disappeared from northern and central Coahuila but was still living in southern
Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas? This assumption seems
to be cutting things pretty fine, but in the fa'ce of present
evidence, it also seems to be the only explanation which
will fit the facts.
The conclusion would be more worrisome if some archeologists, working in similar cultures and environments, had

PLATE 29

from the "Coahuila Complex", the two lower ones from the older
"Cienegas Complex".

not found the same thing, as for instance at Danger Cave
in Utah (Jennings, 1953). It may be possible that the warming and desiccating effects of the Anathermal climate upset
the already fine balance of the more arid areas before the
more humid regions were appreciably affected (Antevs,
1948) . If this was indeed the case, then it is logical to suppose that the Pleistocene fauna would have become extinct
in, or migrated away from, the most arid areas first. Also
the modern fauna would have emerged in such areas before
appearing in the still somewhat Pleistocene and still welloccupied environments of the more humid regions.
How this hypothesis jibes with the discovery of elephants
and tapir and hickory charcoal in southern Arizona (Sayles
and Antevs, 1941; Antevs, 1953; Haury, 1956) more or less
contemporary with, or even later than, the modern fauna
of Coahuila and Nevada, is difficult to say. Perhaps these
data themselves indicate that, for some reason, southern
Arizona was indeed more humid in those days than either
Coahuila or the northern Great Basin.
What about the cultural implications of our material? In
the first place, it is obvious that the culture of Frightful
Cave was, from first to last, definitely oriented toward the
use of fiber and wood rather than stone and bone. For
example, the ratio of fiber to stone artifacts in the bottom
level is roughly 16 to 1. In the top level it is 22 to 1. This
is a rather crude method of comparison, but it gives a
numerical approximation and places the emphasis where it
undoubtedly belongs. The same orientation is seen by studying projectile points and foreshafts. In the bottom level,
there are 7 pointed wood foreshafts, 8 stone projectile points,
and 2 wood foreshafts notched to receive stone points. But
percentage-wise, these 7 pointed wood foreshafts represent
64 per cent of all found at the site, while the figure for both
the stone points and the notched foreshafts is only 16 per
cent in each case. Thus it is perfectly apparent that,
although wood points and stone points were about equally
popular in bottom-level times, the emphasis on stone points
increases at the expense of wood points. But the significant

228

Texas Archeological Society

point here is, I believe, that the increase is at the expense of
wood points and that, despite this, wood points are still
present in the top level of the site. Such relationships
between the two types of points is not common in other
sites which have come to my attention.
On the other hand, despite the over-all increase of projectile points and foreshafts upward through the three levels
(a total of 17 in the bottom level, 21 in the middle, and 40
in the top), there is a very obvious shift from animal to
vegetal foods, or rather a decrease in the former and increase in the latter. Additional evidence of this shift in
subsistence emphasis is seen in the frequency and distribution of metates and manos, of edible seeds and of quids.
It is undoubted that this change is to be correlated with, and
attributed to, the changing climate, specifically the increasing aridity.
I believe these data have implications that go beyond our
local Coahuila problems. If, as I am convinced, the culture
of Coahuila is a typical example, neither aberrant nor marginal, of the widespread basic culture which (too narrowly,
perhaps) has been called the Desert Culture; and if, as the
dates suggest, it is one of the earliest representatives of that
or any other culture in North America, then what may we
say?
For one thing, there is the suggestion that the differences
in basic economy between the Folsom-Clovis "hunting emphasis" and the Desert-Cochise "gathering emphasis" may
be temporal and fundamentally environmental, rather than
strictly culture-historical. That is to say, the evidence of a
shift from animal to vegetal emphasis in the foods of Coahuila at a very early date may be indicative of other early
shifts, either toward gathering or toward hunting, within
other North American cultures due to the pressures of the
changing post-Pleistocene climate.
This further suggests that neither the Desert-type "gathering" cultures nor the High Plains-type "hunting" cultures
actually represent the earliest culture-type in western North
America. Both may be specializations which arose from

one or more preceding cultures which had different subsistence emphases, in response to strictly local conditions at,
or soon after, the end of the Pleistocene climatological conditions.
Although our Coahuila materials contain the empirical
bases for a vastly greater number of cultural, chronological,
and environmental hypotheses, I shall mention only one
more here. Heizer has said, and very understandably, that
it is difficult for him to believe that culture in the Great
Basin region continued unchanged for 10 to 11 thousand
years, as indicated by the radiocarbon dates (Heizer, 1956,
p. 53) . But after studying our materials and their dates, I
can find no alternative to believing that in Coahuila, at
least, a single culture complex did in fact exist certainly for
8000 years and probably for at least 10,000. To be sure, there
are variations from early to late. New traits appear, and
old ones disappear. Shapes change, and the popularity of
different techniques waxes and wanes. But there can be
no doubt that we are dealing with a single cultural continuum from beginning to end in the deposits of Frightful
Cave. And furthermore, when we examine the Spanish
documents, we are instantly and strongly struck with the
similarity of the cave material to the culture described for
the neighboring regions in the 16th and 17th centuries. For
example, of the archeologically discernable traits mentioned
by Alonso de Leon (1909), for the Coahuiltecan tribes before
the middle of the 17th century, 63 per cent are known to
exist in the cultural remains of Frightful Cave.
That we are indeed dealing with a cultural continuum is
fully attested by other data. One sandal type, made of the
same materials and by the identical technique, has been
found in quantity from bottom to top in the deposits, a span
of 8000 years: 89 in the bottom level, 235 in the middle, and
231 in the top. Two other sandal types are also present
throughout, although with less frequency. All forms of
twining, coiling, netting, and plaiting are found from bottom
to top, although there are sequential and significant variations in percentages of representation. In wood, to name

232

Texas Archeological Society

but a few, there are found throughout: atlatls and their
appurtenances, fire-tongs, fire-drills and fire-hearths,
grooved clubs, pegs, points and/ or awls. In stonework,
although the shapes of projectile points vary with time,
there seems to be a definite continuum in certain forms and,
even more surely, in certain characteristics such as serrating and contracting stems. Other than projectile points,
stonework exhibits the same techniques and the same basic
types of implements from first to last.
It should be unnecessary to point out that, in the case
of these particular data from Coahuila, we are talking
about a series of dates derived from the sequentially stacked
deposits of a single site. We are not dealing with seriated
sites over a range of territory. Furthermore, the dates
have been derived from artifacts and hiofacts, not from
products of non-human activity for which assumptions of
human contemporaneity have to be made. We are not
dating horizons and assuming that their artif act contents are
of the same age. We are dating artifacts and assuming that
their locus of discovery is their locus of original deposition,
or close enough to it to warrant the inference of contemporaneity. But whether this inference is valid or not, it is
still t he artifacts themselves which have been dated.

In view of all th e above discussion, it is app arent that, in
Frightful Cave and, by extension, in northern Coahuila, w e
have a well documented and remarkable inst ance of cultur al
continuity and conservatism. Coahuila evidently represents
a cultural cul-de-sac wherein w as retained, for a period of
from 8 to 10 thousand years, a culture that was in existence
at the close of the Pleistocene epoch in w estern Nor th
America.

Editor's Note: Dr. Taylor generously contributed this manuscript a few days after it was read (see Note 1) but there was no
time to prepare adequate illustrations before sending the Bulletin
to print. In addition to the four photographs reproduced as Plates
28-30, Dr. Taylor sent several photographs of typical projectile
points from northern Coahuila and Frightful Cave. However, it
was decided not to reproduce them because they would have meant
little without descriptions and frequency studies. It should be
pointed out that no examples whatever of the small projectile
points commonly called "arrow points" were found in Frightful
Cave, its occupation having presumably ended before such small
points appeared in that area; this is interesting in view of the
lowest date obtained from this cave, 1770 +- 250 years (Table I).
It should also be mentioned that the two uppermost sandals in
Plate 29 are woven in techniques common to the Pecos R iver Focus
in the Big Bend area, as shown in the article in this Bulletin by
Mardith K. Schuetz. On the other hand, what Dr. T aylor calls the
"twill-pad" type of sandal, of which two examples are shown in
the lower part of Plate 29, almost certainly belongs to a much
older period than that of the Pecos River Focus. Plate 30 is included to show what the dated "rosettes" lock like. ADK.
