ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey for the proposed Reserve at Towne Crossing
project (13.650 acres) in east-central Gregg County, Texas was performed by
Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) on January 18, 2010. The lead
agency for this project is the United States Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD), and the regulatory agency for overseeing this archaeological
investigation is the Texas Historical Commission (THC), Archeology Division.
William E. Moore was the Principal Investigator, and he was assisted by Randall
Anderson. The project area was investigated by a 100% Pedestrian Survey
supported by shovel testing. No evidence of a prehistoric or historic site was
found, and no artifacts were collected. Much of the project area appeared to have
been disturbed.

INTRODUCTION
Longview MF, LLC plans to construct affordable housing in the form of an
apartment complex at the northwest quadrant of United States Highway 259 and
Janet Kay Drive just outside the city limits of Longview, Texas (Figure 1). On the
north the site is bounded by private property, on the south it is bounded by The
University of Texas at Austin Longview Center, on the east it is bounded by United
States Highway 259, and on the west it is bounded by private property. The new
apartment complex will consist of nine three-story wood-framed apartment
buildings, a clubhouse, associated pavement for driving lanes and parking, and
two swimming pools. Currently, the site is vacant land that has been partially
cleared. The east side of the site slopes to the north and west, and the western
portion of the site drains to the west. There is about 26 feet of relief between
extreme elevations on the site. Some cutting and filling will be necessary to
achieve the planned finished floor elevations with a maximum cut of six feet in
buildings 4-6 and a maximum fill of nine feet in Building 8. When finished, the
entire 13.650 acre tract will be affected. The Federal agency involved in this
project is the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. The
results of this archaeological study are subject to review under Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966. Following a review of the proposed
project by the THC, an archaeological survey was considered necessary because
âthe tract proposed for development is situated in a setting with a high probability
for buried cultural resources.â In order to satisfy this requirement, the Client
retained BVRA to conduct an archaeological survey designed to meet the
minimum archeological survey standards as posted on line at www.thc.state.us.
The project area consists of 13.650 acres and is depicted on the topographic
quadrangle Longview Heights (3294-312) (Figure 2).

PROJECT AREA SOILS
According to the General Soil Map in the soil survey for Gregg County
(Roberts 1983), the project area is located within the Darcos series that consists of
gently sloping to moderately steep well-drained, sandy soils on uplands. The
specific soil map unit for the project area is Lilbert loamy fine sand, 2 to 5 percent
slopes (LbC). This soil is described by Roberts (1983:24) as a gently sloping soil
on uplands. Mapped areas are broad and irregular in shape and are located on
broad interstream divides and slightly convex ridges. Typically, the surface layer is
brown loamy fine sand about six inches thick. The subsurface layer, which extends
to a depth of 30 inches, is pale brown loamy fine sand. The upper part of the
subsoil, to a depth of 48 inches, is yellowish-brown sandy clay. The lower part of
the subsoil, to a depth of 72 inches, is mottled red, gray, and brown sandy clay
loam. It is well drained, runoff is slow, and permeability is moderately slow.
Available water capacity is medium. The root zone is deep, but roots are restricted
in the lower layers. Mixed hardwoods and pines are suited to this soil. According
to a geo-technical report (Terracon Consultants, Inc. 2009), soil borings in the
project area revealed sandy soils to a depth of two feet. Sixteen borings were
drilled on August 02, 2009 at the approximate location of each proposed
apartment building.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
According to a recently published planning document for the Eastern
Planning Region of Texas (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 1.1.2), Gregg
County is situated within the Northeast Texas archeological study region (Figure
3). The first sites in the county were recorded in the 1930s, and several sites were
recorded between 1939 and 1959. Currently, Gregg County has 106 recorded
sites. The majority of sites in the county (n=56) were recorded by avocational
archaeologists. While a high school student in Kilgore, Jack T. Hughes located
and recorded 20 sites (41GG4 - 41GG20 and 41GG35 - 41GG37). An additional
36 sites were added to the database for Gregg County by archaeological stewards
Bo Nelson, Mark Walters, and Bryan Boyd. The other 47 sites were found as a
result of various cultural resource surveys for state and federally funded projects.
G. E. Arnold, working with The University of Texas at Austin, visited much of
East Texas and documented sites in many counties between 1939 and 1940.
Arnold did not conduct shovel testing, took few notes, and assigned field numbers
to each site. His plotting in some cases are suspect. The location of site 41GG2,
for example, is described in the TARL site records as uncertain and possibly the
same as site 41GG8 to the north. In 1940, he was in Gregg County where he
recorded two sites (41GG2 and 41GG3).
According to Nancy Kenmotsu and Timothy K. Perttula (1993), notable
prehistoric sites are present in Gregg County. They include important huntergatherer sites, significant Caddo Period sites, and one Critical Resource Zone
containing sites that are relevant to the research on the development of agriculture
prior to A.D. 1600. Sites with excellent faunal and floral preservation have not
been identified, and no sites with mounds are known. Also, Gregg County ranks
low in terms of density of known human burials and number of archaeological sites
with burials. The period of European contact is represented by several sites
containing historic burials, trade beads, iron knives and arrow points, steel adzes,
and a copper wire coil.
The interested reader is advised to consult the planning document by
Kenmotsu and Perttula for an in-depth discussion of the archaeology of Northeast
Texas. Other relevant sources of information are an archaeological bibliography
for the Northeastern Region of Texas (Martin 1990) and the Abstracts in Texas
Contract Archeology published by the THC.
No previously recorded sites are
in close proximity to the project area. There have been two archaeological surveys
in the area. Both were negative in terms of recording sites. The only available
report was by Perttula and Nelson (2002) reporting the results of their survey for a
sewer line for the City of Kilgore.

METHODS OF INVESTIGATION
Background Research
The field survey was supplemented by an examination of site records and
other documents at TARL in Austin, Texas for previously recorded sites in the
project area and vicinity. In addition, the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas was
checked for previous surveys by professional archaeologists.
Field Survey
The project area was covered with vegetation, mainly low grasses, briars
and a few trees. The main portion had been cleared in the past, and the ground
cover present represents secondary growth. According to the image presented by
the topographic quadrangle, we expected a uniform hill over most of the site area,
but this was not the case. Much of the area appeared to be disturbed as the
surface was undulating. The only high ground that we believe may be natural was
two prominent high points in the approximate center of the tract. To the west and
northwest, the tract sloped to the creek and its floodplain. Figure 4 shows the high
ground in the distance. The reddish color is the large patch of briars, and the
lighter color is the grass. This photo was taken from the south, and the high
ground shown in the foreground is outside the project area.
The entire area was walked in an attempt to observe surface evidence of a
historic site such as bricks or foundations that might indicate the location of a
former structure. Due to the thick ground cover and lack of exposed soil, the only
method possible to identify a prehistoric site was through shovel testing, and the
tests were concentrated on the two high points that appeared to be the only
undisturbed portions of the tract. All excavated earth was screened through
quarter-inch hardware cloth. Data obtained from shovel tests were recorded on a
shovel test log (Appendix I). In all, eleven shovel tests were excavated (Figure 5).
This figure depicts the eleven shovel tests, but it does not show contours that
illustrate the nature of the surface. The depth of the tests averaged 58.8 cm below
the existing ground surface, and they were dug through sandy soil and terminated
when clay or standing water was encountered. The project was also documented
through digital photography. Shovel testing was not considered necessary in the
low areas away from the two high points.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Background Research
Examination of the site files at TARL and the Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas revealed that no sites have been recorded in the project area or Area of
Potential Effect (APE). Also, no part of the APE has been investigated by a
professional archaeologist.
Field Survey
The majority of the project area was found to be in a cleared area with a
few oak trees and low grasses and briars on a sandy hill overlooking Murray Creek
to the west and an unnamed tributary of Murray Creek to the north. Although I was
not able to find documentation of past disturbance to the site except for clearing of
vegetation, part of the ground surface did not appear to be natural. Much of the
site was considerably lower than the two prominent hills in the center, and the area
was undulating. A portion of the eastern end of the project area had been
disturbed through the construction of a pipeline and miscellaneous utilities. The
shovel tests revealed the presence of clay and standing water at an average depth
of 58.8 cm below the existing ground surface, and no cultural materials were
observed. Just above the underlying clay stratum we encountered numerous
pebbles, often an indication of the presence of clay. The eleven shovel tests
excavated in the project area exceeds the amount required by the "Minimum
Survey Standards" for project areas of 200 acres or less.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No archaeological sites were found within the project area. It is, therefore,
recommended that the project proceed without further consultation with the THC
relative to cultural resources. Should evidence of an archaeological site be
encountered during construction, all work must be temporarily suspended in the
area of the find until assessed by a professional archeologist in consultation with
the THC. Also, should additional acreage be added to the project area, this
change must be reported to the THC as this agency may require an investigation
of this area by a professional archaeologist.
