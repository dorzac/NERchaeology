ABSTRACT

Devon Energy Production Company, L.P. intends to construct the
Hencken Master Development Plan well pad, associated lease road and
pipeline in southwestern Tarrant County, Texas near the southern shore of
Lake Benbrook. AR Consultants, Inc. conducted a cultural resources
inventory of the total 16.98 acres for the well pad study area on March 4,
2010. Based on the negative results of the survey, no cultural resources
will be impacted by implementation of the Hencken Master Development
Plan. Consequently, further cultural resource investigations are
unwarranted. If buried cultural deposits are discovered during the
development of the study area, work should immediately cease in that area
and the Bureau of Land Management should be notified.

INTRODUCTION
Devon Energy Production Company, L.P., headquartered in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma,
intends to construct the Hencken Master Development Plan well pad with its associated
lease road and pipeline in Tarrant County, Texas (Figure 1). Twenty-one possible drillhole locations are presented in the plan clustered in two discrete areas: The northeast
edge and in the central area of the pad. Located just below the southern shore of Lake
Benbrook and extending northeast from Hencken Road, the study area encompasses a
cumulative 16.98-acre Area of Potential Effect (APE). The area of the Hencken Master
Development Plan well pad, rectangular in shape, is 5.88 acres. However, the Bureau of
Land Management requires that 10 acres for a well pad be surveyed as well as a 100 foot
buffer beyond the 10 acres, resulting in a total well pad APE of 13.25 acres. Additionally,
the APE includes 2701’ x 60’ (3.72 acres) for the proposed and alternate lease roads, and
23.11’ (0.01 acres) for the proposed pipeline. The total project APE is 16.98 acres.
The purpose of the archaeological survey was to determine if cultural resources were
present, and, if present, makes recommendations about their significance and how they
would be impacted by construction. The survey was done for Reagan Smith Energy
Solutions, Inc. of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
Relevant federal legislation includes the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as
amended (PL-96-515), the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), the
Archeological and Historical Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93-291),
Executive Order No. 11593 “Protection and Enhancement of the Cultural Environment,”
and Procedures for the Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties (36CFR800),
Appendix C. The study was conducted under BLM Permit Number 219-2920-07-D, and
on March 04, 2010, an intensive pedestrian survey was conducted of the well pad study
area.
This report has been written in accordance with the report guidelines prepared by the
Council of Texas Archeologists (n.d.) as well as with applicable BLM guidelines. The
following report presents a brief description of the natural environment and cultural
history of the vicinity. This is followed by a description of the research design and
methodology. The results of the investigation follow and constitute the body of the
report. The last chapter presents recommendations that arise from the study. A list of
references cited concludes the report.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
Tarrant County is located in North Central Texas. The terrain consists mainly of
undulating to hilly land and vegetation consists of tall grasses and various species of trees
such as mesquite, elm, oak, pecan and walnut. The waters in the Western Cross Timbers
drain into the West Fork of the Trinity River. Streams in the Fort Worth Prairie, in which
the study area lies (Dyksterhuis 1946:Figure 1), drain into the upper tributaries of the
Clear Fork of the Trinity River.
The study area is underlain by Lower Cretaceous-aged Goodland Limestone (Bureau of
Economic Geology 1988). The study area encompasses three soil types: Purves clay with
0 to 3 percent slopes, Luckenbach clay loam with 1 to 3 percent slopes and Brackett clay
loam with 3 to 8 percent slopes (Ressel 1981:Sheet 53).
Fauna are varied and abundant with at least 49 species of mammals, 39 species of snakes,
17 species of reptiles and other species (Blair 1950:101–102). Common forms of fauna
include deer, raccoon, opossum, rabbit, lizards and turtles. Armadillos have invaded the
area within the past 50 years. Various authors, including Lynott (1979), believed that the
prairie was inhabited by now extinct bison and antelope.
Prikryl (1993:192-193) suggested that prior to 12,000 BC, the climate of north central
Texas was cooler and moister than at present. Between 12,000 and 8,000 BC, the climate
became warmer and this continued to the present, but with brief mesic periods. He adds
that the presence of high grass pollen and low arboreal pollen between 5550 to 1050 BC
indicates a drying with a return of arboreal pollen after 1050 BC The later change is
similar to today’s environment. High grass pollen also occurred at approximately AD 450
and from AD 1550 to 1650, and this also indicates drier periods. The presence of
paleosols between AD 1 and 1000 suggested an increase in moisture during this period
with a return to drier conditions after AD 1000.

CULTURAL HISTORY
Over the past several decades, cultural resources investigations in North Central Texas
have varied due to the locations and types of projects being carried out. Therefore, the
database of information to which new projects can be compared is limited. The following
culture history is derived from the monograph Lower Elm Fork Prehistory by Daniel J.
Prikryl (1990). Prikryl's framework includes the six prehistoric periods, to which the
historic Native American and European periods have been added.
Using Prikryl’s time framework, the following paragraphs present a brief description of
the culture history of the region.
Historic European
Historic Native American
Late Prehistoric II
Late Prehistoric I
Late Archaic
Middle Archaic
Early Archaic
Paleoindian

AD 1800 to Present
AD 1600 to AD 1850
AD 1300 to AD 1600
AD 700 to AD 1300
2,000 BC to AD 700
4,000 BC to 2,000 BC
6,000 BC to 4,000 BC
ca. 11,000 BC to 6,000 BC

The Paleoindian period is distinguished by distinctive projectile point styles attributed to
this period (Bever and Meltzer 2007:Table 1). Many of the points are made of exotic
cherts that are not native to North Central Texas. The Lewisville site and the Aubrey
Clovis site in Denton County are the only excavated Paleoindian sites in the region.
Surface artifacts generally come from deposits on stream terraces above the level of the
active floodplain. This was a period when large mammals became extinct, and their
extinction is attributed in part to a general environmental drying.
During the Early Archaic, the general drying continued, and sites are found on stream
terraces. There is a hint of population increase, and Lynott (1981:103) suggests that there
was increased emphasis on the use of bottomland food resources. Prikryl (1990:71) can
not confirm Lynott's suggestion, and in fact, he reports fewer bottomland sites than
during the previous period. Middle Archaic sites are predominantly found on the first
terrace above stream floodplains. As earlier, sites tend to be along the Elm Fork rather
than along the smaller tributaries. It appears that population density continued to be low.
Late Archaic sites increase in number over the previous period, and sites are located both
along the rivers and along tributaries. There appears to be a strong shift in site location to
the tributary streams and a pronounced population explosion. Local Ogallala quartzite is
being used prominently at this time, and this observation is taken by some authors as
evidence of increased territorial restrictions (Prikryl 1990).
During the Late Prehistoric I period, the bow and arrow and pottery appear in artifact
assemblages. Houses and probable evidence of agriculture first appear during this period,
although none are known in the immediate area. Site locations mirror those of the Late

Archaic, and quartzite continued as the common material used for chipped stone
projectiles and tools. The West Fork Paleosol is dated to this period, and drying
continued into the subsequent period (Peter and McGregor 1988; Ferring 1990).
The Late Prehistoric II is highlighted by the prominence of buffalo in archaeological sites
and the appearance of tools normally expected to occur at sites on the High Plains of
West Texas. It also appears that sites are once again located on sandy terraces above the
floodplains (Peter and McGregor 1988).
Beginning in the 1830s and continuing into the 1840s, according to some historical
documents, the aboriginal inhabitants of North Central Texas continued to play a role in
the history of that region. Very little archaeological evidence, however, of historic Native
American occupation has been found in the area. This is a pattern seen throughout much
of Texas, and one which has been suggested is due to the inability of the Native
Americans to adapt to the changing climate (Skinner 1988). The 1830s and 1840s were
decades of Anglo expansion into North Central Texas. Garrett (1972:24), a wellrespected Fort Worth historian, has stated that "Indian hostilities almost depopulated
North Texas [of Anglo settlers] after 1839. It dwindled to less than half". According to
tradition, many Indians of several tribes roamed the region until well into the 1860s.
The earliest Anglo settlements in Tarrant County were Bird's Fort, established around
1840, and Lonesome Dove, settled in 1845. Lonesome Dove, located near present-day
Grapevine, was the first permanent settlement in Tarrant County (Garrett 1972:55). The
county itself was organized in 1850, but it was not until 1860 that Fort Worth was
officially named the county seat, that designation having been transferred from Birdville
(Webb 1952:708). Settlers, however, had been steadily arriving in the county during
those 20 years. Many came through the auspices of Peters Colony land grants, although
only 160 families and single pioneers took advantage of the grants (Garrett 1972:57).
In 1849, Major Ripley Allan Arnold was assigned to build a military post on the upper
Trinity in the largely uninhabited geographical region of the Grand Prairie and the
Eastern Cross Timbers. This encampment was established on a high bluff overlooking the
confluence of the West and Clear Forks of the Trinity River. Within a short length of
time, there were about 12 double log cabins near the fort, and life in Fort Town definitely
had its refinements (Garrett 1972:80).
The Civil War took its toll on Tarrant County's population, as most of the able-bodied
men left to fight for the Confederacy. Fort Worth's renaissance was motivated by growth
of the cattle industry and the arrival of the railroad. By 1870, it is estimated that 300,000
head of cattle had been driven through Fort Worth. By the end of the nineteenth century,
Fort Worth had shed its "six-shooter" culture for a more refined cow town culture which
was beginning to use its past to advantage.
Oil was the next great influence on the life of Fort Worth. Fort Worth became the
gateway to the West Texas oil fields (Knight 1990:192) and both fed the population and
served as an impetus for post-World War II industrial development.

Previous Investigations
According to the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (2010), no archaeological sites or
surveys are listed adjacent to or within a one-mile radius of the study area. However,
several studies have been done in the larger vicinity, a number of which located cultural
resources.
Site 41TR54 is located west of the study area, just southwest of the Clear Fork. The site
was recorded in 1948 by Stephenson during an archaeological survey for Lake Benbrook
and consisted of a house foundation, trash scatter and well pipe that dated from the 1930s
to pre 1954 (Stephenson 1948).
Site 41TR147 is located southeast of the study area, just east of where Rock Creek exits
Benbrook Lake. The site was recorded in 1994 by COE archaeologist Stallings, and
consists of a prehistoric campsite (TASA 2010). Artifacts recorded at the site included a
fragmentary hearth found eroding out of a cut bank, which featured numerous pieces of
fire cracked rock and mussel shells, a pot-lidded flake and a complete projectile point.
Stallings remarks in her field notes that this site is the only example of cultural resources
of this type recorded near Benbrook Lake since the aforementioned Stephenson studies.
AR Consultants (Skinner and Kent 1998) conducted an archaeological survey of 204
acres on both sides of Dutch Branch for a golf course northwest of the survey area. Two
historic sites, 41TR165 and 41TR166, were recorded. Site 41TR165 consists of a house
foundation with a collapsed chimney. Associated with the house foundation were a root
cellar, a possible smoke house, four rock features and a trash scatter. Site 41TR166
consists of a windmill, a stone-walled water tank, a stone walled watering trough and
rectangular concrete box that once contained a float for water control. No evidence of
foundation stones, a cistern, root cellar or features were found. Both locations are shown
on Sam Street’s 1893 map of Tarrant County.
Additionally, site 41TR199 was recorded during a 2002 study conducted by PBS&J of
the Rocky Creek-Primrose TXU Transmission Line (Sills, King and Cliff 2002). The site
is situated on the west side of the Atchison Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad line, and
consists of a domed root cellar, a windmill base and one (possibly two) filled in wells. A
trash scatter of glass, whiteware, metal, barbed wire rolls and brick concentrations was
also found.
In the fall of 2007 AR Consultants, Inc. (Todd 2007) conducted an archaeological survey
of two well locations within in a pad site located 1.5 miles to the northwest. No
prehistoric or historic sites were recorded during the course of the survey. Similar results
occurred in conjunction with the Devon Cleveland-Federal well pad that is immediately
adjacent to the Courts Federal #1H well pad site (Lang 2007), and in conjunction with the
Benbrook Master Development well pad site 2.5 miles to the north on the western shore
of Lake Benbrook (Turley and Shelton 2010).
The 1893 Sam Street map, the 1920 Soils map and the 1940 General Highway map for
Tarrant County were each examined for structures within the study area. However, none
were observed on any of the maps.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
Research Design
Two research questions were developed regarding the potential for or existence of
prehistoric and historic sites in the study area. In regard to prehistoric sites, the study area
exhibits fairly low archaeological potential. Though the well pad is situated on a gentle
upland near the confluence of Mustang and Bear Creeks, it is located relatively far from
the original Clear Fork channel, which is the more developed drainage with accordingly
higher site potential. Additionally, few sites have been recorded in the region, and the
only prehistoric site recorded in reasonable proximity to the study area is in the more
dramatic uplands adjacent to Rock Creek, farther upstream. It is in this setting that we
expected to find a higher potential for prehistoric resources. Though it was not expected
that prehistoric sites will be encountered at this location, it is possible that cultural
resources may be encountered in the form of small, isolated finds on the rising terrain
west of the well pad, particularly on the lease road.
The second question addresses historic site potential in the region. There is potential for
historic sites since the region has been occupied and utilized by European Settlers since
the mid-1800s. Previous investigations attest to this potential. Based on numerous records
of historic sites to the south and east of the study area, it is expected that, in this area,
they most commonly occur near transportation routes. Most of the historic sites recorded
in the region are farmsteads, homesteads, cemeteries, and artifact scatters located in
uplands similar to the setting of this project. However, the only type of site likely to be
encountered in the study area is a historic farmstead or homestead, as the land has most
likely been farmed for some time.
Methodology
In accordance with Section 106 of the NHPA, a BLM Class III cultural resource
inventory was conducted of the Hencken well pad study area. The Area of Potential
Effect (APE) surveyed is 16.98 acres. BLM regulations require a ten acre study area for
well pads with a 100’ buffer around the study area. Thus the study area for the well pad is
13.25 acres, combined with 3.73 acres for the lease road and pipeline. The entire study
area was walked by a two-person crew using parallel transects spaced 15-20 meters apart.
Shovel testing was conducted following the standards recommended by the Texas
Historical Commission (n.d.). Shovel tests were excavated until the bottom of Holocene
soils was encountered. Sandy or loamy soils were screened through ¼ mesh hardware
screen. Clay soils were carefully sorted by hand. If a site was encountered during shovel
testing, at least six additional shovel tests were to have been excavated to delineate the
site’s horizontal boundaries and, if possible, its vertical limits.
Notes were taken about the surface visibility, land disturbances, drainage channels, and
vegetation. Photographs were taken along the route using a Canon PowerShot SD1200 IS
10.0 mega pixel digital camera. Shovel test locations were recorded with a handheld
Garmin GPSmap 76 receiver. Non-diagnostic artifacts were to have been recorded,
sketched and photographed in the field but not collected for curation.

RESULTS
The Results section is divided into three parts. The first part describes the survey area and
the second the results of the survey. Conclusions, the third part, end the chapter. Shovel
tests are described generally in the text, though specific information is provided in
Appendix A.
Study Area
The Hencken Master Development Plan well pad is located on the William Hunter
Survey (A-734). The well pad study area is a rectangular parcel aligned along a
southwest to northeast orientation, following a similarly oriented fence, which is the
pad’s northwestern boundary. The study area is situated primarily in improved pasture
that sits immediately north of Hencken Road (Figure 2). Terrain is generally rolling,
though features gentle upward slopes toward a small upland rise northeast of the study
area and in the southern corner of the well pad.

Elevations in the study area are fairly consistent however, ranging only from 732 feet
above sea level in the depression of a small tributary to 754 feet above sea level in the
southern corner (Appendix B. Exhibit F). The shoreline of the lake is approximately 490
meters from the study area. The rectangular well pad occupies 5.88 acres. A 995.58-foot
long, 60-foot wide lease road runs along the southeastern border of the well pad, and will
provide access from Hencken Road, which it intersects to the south. Two 60-foot wide
alternate lease roads run both northeast and southwest from the lease road terminuses, to
provide access from one of two possible private drives (Appendix B. Exhibits A-C). The
combined length of all three lease roads is 2710 feet. In either direction, the alternate
lease roads climb to elevations as high as or higher than those within the well pad,
particularly at the southwestern terminus which encounters an elevation of 782 feet. A
single 23.1-foot long pipeline runs perpendicular to the southeast pad boundary to the
rough center of the lease road. Grazed prairie grasses are the dominant vegetation in the
study area, with isolated hackberry and young cottonwoods present mainly along fence
lines (Figure 3). The southern corner of the pad has been completely cleared of
vegetation, and is used as an “outdoor arena” for training horses (Figure 4). A thickly
wooded area is present in the western corner of the pad, and features prickly pear, honey
locust, hackberry, and scattered ankle-high prairie grass (Figure 5). The lease road
southwest of the pad ran through rougher terrain featuring ankle to knee-high prairie
grasses, prickly pear and scattered stands of honey locust.

Survey Results
Ground visibility was generally poor in the majority of the study area, between 0 and 20
percent. Some areas however, including the “outdoor arena,” the soil-poor rise northeast
of the pad and isolated cattle trails within the study area, offered between 60 and 100
percent visibility of the ground surface. The entirety of the unit property was walked by
the two-person crew using 15 to 20 meter transects. However, no cultural resources were
observed on the ground surface or noted in any of the aforementioned areas of high
ground visibility. This is in keeping with statements made by the current landowner, Mr.
Hencken, who has not observed any historic or prehistoric material on the property in the
30 years that he has lived there.
A total of eight shovel tests (1-3, 5-8 and 10) were excavated within the well pad
boundary (Figure 6). Sediments encountered during subsurface investigation generally
consisted of yellowish brown to dark grayish brown clays overlain by black to very dark
brown loamy clays and clays. Bottom depths for these deposits were as deep as 125cm
and 110cm, respectively. Eroding caliche bedrock was encountered in each of the shovel
tests between 50 and 110 cm below the ground surface. ST 9 was excavated on the
proposed pipeline, and encountered an almost identical soil profile. No cultural materials
were encountered in any of the shovel tests.
Additionally, the staked lease road and alternate lease roads were surveyed and shovel
tested at 100 meter intervals, though the final, unflagged 100 meters of the alternate lease
road running southwest were not shovel tested. This is due to the location of the lease
road route in the fenced yards of private residences, where shovel testing would have
been ill advised. However, field personnel walked the remainder of the route, and
observed no cultural material on the ground surface. In the three shovel tests excavated
on the lease road (4, 11 and 12) only an 8 to 15 cm-thick layer of dark yellowish brown
sandy clay covered eroding caliche bedrock. No cultural material was observed in any of
the three shovel tests.
The general trend seems to be one of deeper sediments in the lower elevations, in contrast
to the shallow caliche bedrock encountered in the uplands along the lease road both
northeast and southwest of the well pad. The dark yellowish brown to dark grayish brown
subsoil is nonexistent in these higher elevations. This trend is likely the result of erosion
from the sloping uplands on either side of the well pad location.

Conclusions
No prehistoric or historic cultural resources were located during the pedestrian survey
and shovel testing of Devon Energy Production Company, L.P.’s proposed Hencken
Master Development Plan. The absence of cultural material in the area can be attributed
to both environmental and historical factors. The well pad study area is located in the
uplands, too distant from the original channel of the Clear Fork to expect high site
density. Construction of the outdoor arena and general clearing of the area has also
contributed to overall disturbance at the location. If sites were present they would likely
have been low-density and artifacts would have been disturbed, but would still potentially
be encountered during the extensive testing and survey due to the excellent ground
visibility in portions of the study area. Additionally, encountering historic sites would
have been unlikely, as the land has probably been continually farmed or used for
pasturage for some time.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No cultural resources will be affected by the development of the Devon Energy
Company, L.P.’s Hencken Master Development Plan and its associated lease road and
pipeline based on the results of the cultural resource survey. Consequently, further
cultural resource investigations are unwarranted. ARC, therefore, requests that the
Bureau of Land Management concur with our conclusions that this project can proceed
without the need for additional cultural resource investigations. If buried cultural
resources are discovered during development, work should immediately cease in that area
and the Bureau of Land Management should be notified.
