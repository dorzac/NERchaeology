Abstract

ABSTRACT
Atmos Energy Corporation contracted Burns & McDonnell Engineering Company, Inc. to perform a
background review and cultural resources survey for the Line LB8 (2nd) (South) Replacement (Project) in
Brazos County, Texas. The survey was performed under Antiquities Permit #8508. The following report
provides information regarding the Project and includes the methods and results of the cultural resources
background review and an archeological survey of an approximately 9.97-acre Survey Area. No
archeological sites were recorded during the survey. One historic-age resource, Resource 01, was
recorded on the periphery of the Project APE. Resource 01 is a pair of mid-twentieth century concrete
pillars representing the remains of a residential gate. Additional research would be required to determine
if the pillars maintain historic associations; however, current Project plans would avoid impacts to the
resource. As a result, no adverse effect is anticipated at this location under Section 106 regardless of the
resource’s NRHP status. As a result, no further consideration of impacts to historic resources under
Section 106 or the Antiquities Code of Texas is recommended in association with the proposed Project.

Introduction

INTRODUCTION

Atmos Energy Corporation (Atmos) contracted Burns & McDonnell Engineering Company, Inc. (Burns
& McDonnell) to perform a background review and archeological survey for the proposed Line L8B
(2nd) (South) Replacement Project (Project) in the city of Bryan, Brazos County, Texas (Appendix A:
Figure A-1). The following report provides information regarding the Project and includes the methods
and results of the cultural resources background review and archeological survey following the Short
Report guidelines set forth by the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA).

1.1

Project Description

The Project involves replacement of approximately 5,200 feet (approximately 1 mile) of natural gas steel
pipeline within Atmos’ existing easement. This easement varies in width from 75 feet, where it is adjacent
to housing, to 50 feet in open field. Additionally, three separate areas along the proposed pipeline route,
totaling approximately 8.69 acres would be used as temporary workspaces during construction
(Attachment 1: Figure A-1). Therefore, the proposed Area of Potential Effects (APE), including
approximately 8.69 acres of temporary workspaces and 5,200 feet (1 mile) long by 50-to-75 feet wide
pipeline corridor, is approximately 15.96 acres. Burns & McDonnell understands most of the replacement
line (approximately 70 percent) would be installed via bore due to the predominantly urban setting;
however, the bore entry/exit locations have not yet been determined. The remaining 30 percent of the line
would be replaced via the open-cut trench method. If the proposed Project requires a U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE) permit, compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
(NHPA) would be required. Additionally, the proposed Project crosses property owned by the city of
Bryan, a political subdivision of the State of Texas (Appendix A: Figure A-1). Therefore, compliance
with the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) is required for that property.

1.2

Survey Area

Due to the urban setting and likelihood of modern disturbance within the proposed APE, archeological
survey was limited to high probability areas (HPAs) and historic HPAs (HHPAs) identified during the
background review (Appendix A: Figure A-2). The Survey Area totals approximately 9.97 acres. The
Survey Area was defined in consultation with the Texas Historical Commission (THC) under Texas
Antiquities Permit (TAP) 8508 (Appendix C).

1.3

Project History and Personnel

Burns & McDonnell cultural resources specialists conducted a background review prior to the
commencement of fieldwork. The archeological survey of the non-ACT properties was conducted August

Research Design

RESEARCH DESIGN

The overall objective of the background review and the cultural resources survey was to locate and assess
historic-age (50 years of age or older) properties or archeological sites listed or eligible for listing as State
Antiquities Landmarks (SALs) or on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) within the Survey
Area that could potentially be affected by Project construction. The following chapter provides
information regarding the sources consulted during the initial background review as well as the methods
used during the archeological survey.

2.1

Background Review Methods

Burns & McDonnell archeologists conducted an examination of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
(TASA) to identify previously recorded archeological sites and other previously designated historic-age
resources, including Official State of Texas Historical Markers (OTHMs), such as Recorded Texas
Historic Landmarks, NRHP-listed properties and districts, SALs, National Historic Landmarks, and
historic-age cemeteries within a Study Area extending 1 mile from the APE. The TASA was also used to
identify previous archeological surveys performed within the Study Area.
Additionally, the online Soil Web supplied by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and
historic-age maps available on the Texas Historic Overlay (THO) were reviewed (Foster et al. 2006).
These resources were used to identify HPAs for previously unrecorded cultural resources within the APE.

2.2

Archeological Survey Methods

Survey was conducted along parallel transects spaced 30 meters (m) apart. Shovel tests were excavated at
approximately 50 m interval. Shovel tests were excavated to approximately 30 centimeters below surface
(cmbs) in the clayey soils. Soil matrices were screened through 1/4-inch mesh when possible. Clayey
matrices were hand-sorted and visually inspected. All shovel tests were backfilled immediately after
inspection. Shovel test locations were recorded using Global Positioning System (GPS) equipment. The
field survey was performed in compliance with the ACT (Texas Natural Resources Code of 1977, Title 9,
Chapter 191, as amended) and the guidelines set forth by the THC and the CTA. Project records and
photographs will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Lab.

Two previously recorded archeological sites are within the Study Area (Table 2; Attachment 1: Figure A2). Site 41BZ90, Allen Academy, was founded as a day school in 1886 by John and Rivers Allen. The
academy developed a national reputation as a military school. At present, it is the oldest accredited, nonsectarian preparatory school in Texas (Allen Academy 2018). Site 41BZ91 was recorded in 1988 as a
historic-age townsite and cemetery dating from 1844 to 1866. Neither site is within the proposed APE.

Ten OTHMs occur within the Study Area (Table 3; Attachment 1: Figure A-2). None of the OTHMs are
within the Project APE. Marker 13279, closest to the Project, commemorates the former site of Villa
Maria Ursuline Academy. The marker text reads:

Results of the Background Review

The Ursuline Sisters, founded by St. Angela in Italy in 1535, opened their first girls' school in
North America in Quebec in 1639. In 1727, they opened the Ursuline Academy in New Orleans,
followed in 1846 with the Ursuline Academy in Galveston. In addition to teaching, the nuns
served as nurses during epidemics, hurricanes, fires and the Civil War. Their Galveston Academy
building served as a refugee shelter despite heavy damages sustained in the devastating 1900
storm. Seeking a new school site further inland, Mother Superior Mary Joseph Dallmer selected
Bryan over several other cities. With donations from Bryan citizens, the sisters purchased land
from W.R. and Mary (Mitchell) Cavitt and began plans for Villa Maria Ursuline Academy at this
site, which became known as St. Ursula's Hill. Contractor George Jenkins built a school and
dormitory using a Nicholas Clayton design. The school opened in September 1901, but
construction continued until October 21, St. Ursula's feast day. Girls at the academy studied
traditional subjects, as well as sports and music, and maintained a large farm. The sisters worked
closely with St. Joseph's Catholic Church and School, where they also taught. Facing low
enrollment and burdened by the debt of costly building repairs, Villa Maria Ursuline Academy
closed in 1929. Former U.S. Consul General Williamson S. Howell, Jr. bought the property and
built a 24-room house using bricks from the school. The few graves of Ursuline nuns on the
property were removed to Galveston, where the school resumed operations. Howell later sold to
Allen Academy, which retained ownership until 1973. Today, nearby street names reflect the
impact of both the academy and Howell (THC 2018).

Four historic-age cemeteries are within the Study Area (Table 4; Attachment 1: Figure A-2). All are
outside of the APE. Three of the four are designated as Historic Texas Cemeteries (HTC), including
Mount Calvary Cemetery, Grandview Cemetery, and Old Bryan Yellow Fever Cemetery. Mount Calvary
Cemetery was designated as an HTC in July 2004. At the time of its designation, it held around 4,800
graves dating as early as 1898. Grandview Cemetery was designated as an HTC in July 2011 with over

600 graves dating from 1923 to 2008. Old Bryan Yellow Fever Cemetery contained at least 24 burials at
the time of its designation as an HTC in July 2016. The burial markers date from 1861 to 1900.

Four NRHP-listed properties are within the Study Area; however, only one of the properties is still extant
(Table 5; Attachment 1: Figure A-2). The House at 1401 Baker is a residential building from the early
1900s. It was NRHP-listed in September 1987 under Criterion C for its embodiment of distinctive period
design and architectural elements. The remaining three NRHP-listed properties were historically located
on the Allen Academy grounds but have since been demolished. Each was part of an NRHP multiple
resource property listed in September 1987. None of the NRHP-listed properties are within the APE.

A review of historic-age maps identified three HHPAs in undeveloped portions of the Study Area
(Appendix A: Figure A-3). A single building was identified as HHPA #1 on the 1914 Brazos County
Soils Map (Foster et al. 2006). HHPA #2 was identified as the tract that contained the former Villa Maria
Ursuline Academy from 1901 to 1929 and the Howell House from the 1930s until it was razed in 1981
(Mayo 2003). HHPA #3 is a former pumping station identified on the 1962 Bryan Quadrangle (Foster et
al. 2006). Archeological survey was conducted at these locations.

Results of the Background Review

According to the NRCS, soils within the APE are urban and include Zack-Urban Land complex,
Boonville-Urban Land complex, and Sandow-Urban Land complex (Appendix A: Figure A-4). The ZackUrban Land complex soils formed in the residuum weathered from shale and siltstone in the Vegua
Formation of the Eocene age, while Boonville-Urban Land complex soils formed in clayey colluvium
from the same period. Both of these upland soils have low probability for containing buried cultural
deposits and are likely disturbed in their urban context. Sandow-Urban Land complex soils are mapped
along the unnamed tributaries to Carters Creek (HPA #1 and HPA #2, Appendix A: Figure A-3). Sandow
series soils formed in Holocene alluvium. These soils frequently contain buried A horizons and have high
probability for containing buried cultural deposits if undisturbed by urban development. Archeological
survey was conducted at both creek crossings.

RESULTS OF THE ARCHEOLOGICAL SURVEY

The following section outlines the results of the archeology survey of the 9.97-acre Survey Area,
including three HHPAs identified from a review of historic-age maps and two additional HPAs along the
two unnamed tributaries to Carters Creek crossed by the Project (Appendix A: Figure A-3). Burns &
McDonnell archeologists performed an intensive survey that included shovel testing of the 9.97-acre
Survey Area between August 2 and 10, 2018. Burns & McDonnell archeologists excavated 21 shovel
tests within the Survey Area (Appendix A: Figure A-3).
The majority of the Survey Areas were empty lots with either maintained lawns or tall grass (Appendix B:
Photographs B-1 to B-4). Ground surface visibility was less than 10 percent. Disturbances within the
Survey Area included urban development (pavement, mechanical modification of landforms, clearing,
buried and raised utilities) and the existing pipeline right-of-way (ROW). Shovel tests were excavated
every 50 m (164 feet) within the propose pipeline ROW and temporary work spaces (Appendix A: Figure
A-3). Shovel tests revealed grayish brown (10YR 5/2) to very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clays extending to 30
cm (1 foot) below surface. No archeological sites or isolated finds were observed during the survey,
however one historic-age, non-archeological resource (Resource 01) was recorded.

Resource 01
Resource 01 is a pair of mid-twentieth century poured concrete pillars located on the side of
Howell Avenue (Appendix A: Figure A-3; Appendix B: Photographs B-5 and B-6). Historic-age
aerials show a driveway leading from Resource 01 to a no longer extant building to the east in
1960, 1961, 1971, and 2004. The building is no longer extant in 2008 (NETR 2018). The
associated building is depicted as a residence on 1964, 1973, 1974, 1980, and 1985 USGS
topographic maps (NETR 2018). The pillars appear to be a gate to service a tree-lined private
drive to the residence.
The two pillars are approximately 20 feet apart and stand approximately six feet tall. The pillars
have four “L”-shaped metal hooks on the internal sides for hanging the gate and 15 eye-hooks
with cut tied barb wire on the opposite sides. The west pillar is still tied with wire fencing. Some
asphalt patches were noted near the pillars in the field. The old gate entrance is still likely used
as ingress-egress to the parcel, although it does not appear to have been gated in a number of
decades.

Results of the Archeological Survey

As evidenced by the abundant vegetation that nearly obscures the building, Resource 01 has been
abandoned for some time. Deterioration due to neglect, as well as the removal of the gate itself
has negatively affected the resource’s physical integrity, although its integrity of location and
setting appear to be intact. Furthermore, the resource is not associated with any artifacts or
deposits that would be impacted by construction. Additional research would be required to
determine if the pillars maintain historic associations; however, current Project plans would
avoid impacts to the resource. As a result, no adverse effect is anticipated at this location under
Section 106 regardless of the resource’s NRHP status. No further consideration of potential
impacts is recommended at this location if it is avoided by Project construction.

Conclusions and Recommendations

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The background review and archeological survey of the 9.97-acre Survey Area was completed between
August 2 and 10, 2018. Burns & McDonnell performed an intensive archeological survey involving
subsurface testing every 50 m (328 feet) within the proposed Pipeline ROW and temporary work spaces.
No archeological sites or isolated finds were observed during the survey, however one historic-age, nonarchaeological resource (Resource 01) was recorded. Resource 01 is the remains of a historic-age gate
dating to the mid-twentieth century which has been partially disassembled.. Additional research would be
required to determine if the remaining pillars maintain historic associations; however, current Project
plans would avoid impacts to the resource. As a result, no adverse effect is anticipated at this location
under Section 106 regardless of the resource’s NRHP status. As a result, no further consideration of
impacts to historic resources under Section 106 or the Antiquities Code of Texas is recommended in
association with the proposed Project. If previously unidentified cultural resources are encountered during
construction or significant changes to the project plans are made, then additional assessments of impacts
to cultural resources will be required.
