Definition of Study Area
The current project is for the proposed Rattlesnake buried pipeline right-of-way
connecting an existing pipeline riser in Lea County, NM to a proposed tie-in location in
Loving County, TX. The initial consultations for the project were conducted with Bruce
Boeke the BLM archaeologist at which time he identified the proposed right of way to be
an interstate project that crosses between New Mexico and Texas. As the BLM is a
federal agency he requested the Texas portion of the project to be surveyed and a copy of
the report to be filed with the Texas State Historic Commission. This report is to be
submitted to Texas and a copy provided to the BLM in New Mexico. A copy of the
survey report is also on file with the New Mexico State Historic Preservation office.

AN OVERVIEW OF THE PREHISTORIC AND HISTORIC CULTURAL
RESOURCES OF LOVING COUNTY, TEXAS
David V. Hill Phd,RPA
The county is bounded on the east by Winkler County and on the south by Ward County. Eddy
and Lea counties in southeastern New Mexico border Loving County to the north. Loving County
consists of 671 square miles of flat desert terrain with a few low-rolling hills stretching over
calichified bedrock and wash deposits of pebbles, gravel, and sand. Loving County is the smallest
county in the Permian Basin of West Texas. The Pecos River forms the county's western
boundary, including the Red Bluff Reservoir along its northwestern border with Reeves County.
The Pecos River is the only source of permanent surface water in Loving County. The eastward
trending draws of the Llano Estacado may also hold water on a seasonal basis. East of the Pecos
River Valley, the Llano Estacado gradually slopes to the east and south, with few prominent
topographic features. The Llano Estacado is internally drained with remnant channels from a once
extensive eastward flowing drainage system also present. Some of these drainages are deeply
entrenched. Surface water on the Llano Estacado is limited to playa basins and a few small
downstream sections of some draws, otherwise draw flow is ephemeral (Kibler 1991:13).
The Monahans Dunefield, a component of a much larger sand sheet extends north-south along the
western escarpment of the Llano Estacado, or Southern High Plains (Holliday 2001; Muhs and
Holliday1995). The dunes are in some areas stabilized by Shinnery oak cover that promotes the
formation of parabolic dunes. Mesquite grows along the margins of these dunes as well (Hogan
2006). There is some evidence that prehistoric occupation may have even encouraged the growth
of mesquite in the dunes (York and Dick-Peddie 1969:161-162). Shinnery oak and mesquite have
been recovered from archaeological contexts and likely contributed to local diets (Hogan 2006).
ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND HISTORIC BACKGROUND OF LOVING COUNTY

Paleoindian Period
Three subdivisions are found within the Paleoindian period in west Texas and southeastern New
Mexico: Clovis (ca. 11,500-11,000 B.C.E), Folsom (10,500-9,500), and the Plano or Cody
complex (ca. 9,500-7000 B.C.E) (Holliday 1997). In west Texas and southeastern New Mexico
site belonging to the Plano or Cody Tradition includes lithic assemblages that contain both
Folsom and Midland types of points. Based on recent research these two point types are likely inpart contemporary (Meltzer et al. 2006). The distinction between these subdivisions is based
primarily on projectile point styles and to a lesser extent on the presence of other characteristic
lithic artifacts. The Paleoindian subsistence economy relied mostly on the hunting of large
animals such as mammoth and Bison antiquus, and gathering and processing plants.
Extensive evidence of Paleoindian occupation has been recovered through excavation in several
of the counties adjacent to Loving County. Sites producing extensive Folsom and Midland
occupations have been excavated in nearby Ward and Winkler Counties, Texas (Blain 1968;
Blaine et al. 2017; Dockall 2012; Hofman et al. 1990; Seabach 2004). Sites with evidence of
Paleoindian occupation have also been documented in the southern portions of Eddy and Lea
Counties close to the Texas/New Mexico state border (Hogan and Stauber 2002).
Limited evidence for the presence of Paleoindian occupation of Loving county has been
previously documented. The base from a Folsom point was recovered from the surface of 41LV3
5

APAC 17-10-15 PG 1 of 16

(New Mexico State University/Continuum Corporation 1989; Perroni 1985). This site is located
about thirteen miles north of the current project area. Testing of the site revealed no additional
material that could be associated with a distinctive Folsom occupation but did recovered
additional pieces of chipped stone and evidence of multiple occupations during the Archaic
period (Carlson et al. 1989a,b).

Archaic Period (ca. 6,000 B.C.E. to ca. A.D. 200)
The lengthy Archaic period begins with a post-Pleistocene drying trend that produced an
essentially modern climate regime around 6000 B.C.E. The term Archaic is used here to refer to
post-Pleistocene hunter and gatherer adaptations to a more modern physical environment.
Prehistoric occupants of this period adapted to a desert grassland and scrub environment with
increased spatial and seasonal variability in subsistence resources.
In terms of lithic technology, the shift from the Paleoindian to the Archaic periods is
characterized by a change from formal tool production (primarily bifaces) to one based on
expedient core/flake tool technology (Collins 2002; Vierra 2005: Parry and Kelly 1987). While
these types of studies have increased awareness of the variability between Paleoindian and
Archaic lithic assemblages and encouraged intensive lithic analysis, highly detailed lithic analysis
may not be appropriate at the level of archeological survey do to the time and level of knowledge
and skill required for detailed analysis.
Little independent chronological information is available for Archaic occupations in west Texas
especially for the earlier portion of this period. Archaic sites are most commonly dated by the
presence of different styles of projectile points. Many sites contain projectile points whose styles
have been assigned to different ages elsewhere or produce projectile points that span a
considerable period. Such points may not be useful for estimating the time placement of the site
or indicate reoccupation during the time of that styles popularity. Avocational archaeologists have
conducted extensive surveys of public and private lands and examined extensive private
collections. These studies have documented considerable variation in projectile points attributed
to the Archaic Period in west Texas and adjacent portions of southeastern New Mexico (Leslie
1978) in areas of erosion such as the Monahans Dunefield. Poor site integrity has adversely
impacted Archaic occupations and in some cases likely mixed them with artifacts from earlier and
later occupations (Hall 2002; Seebach 2004).
A common feature associated with Archaic occupations in Loving county and adjacent areas of
west Texas and southeastern New Mexico are hearths composed of fragments of burned caliche.
The caliche is believed have held heat to bake plant or animal foods. Besides chipped stone flakes
and tools, groundstone tools commonly recovered from Archaic and later Formative period sites.
These tools are likely to have been used to grind seeds from such food plants as mesquite, yucca
seeds, and Shinnery oak.
Besides the recovery of a fragment of a Folsom point for the sites surface, subsequent testing of
41LV3 produced evidence for episodic reoccupation of this site throughout the Archaic period by
the presence of distinctive projectiles points from the Early, Middle and Late Archaic Periods. A
single radiocarbon date with a mean of -410 or 410 B.C. E. and 95% confidence listed as falling
between -986 and -10 B.C.(Carlson et al. 1989a, b). No sample number was published with this
date (Carlson et al. 1989a:540). Pollen recovered from one of the two hearths reported from the
site recovered produced a low count of Cheno-am and high counts of Asteraceae primarily
Helianthus (sunflower). Whether this pollen represents evidence of prehistoric subsistence
activities or represents the contemporary floristic environment was not identified in the report
(Bryant and Jones 1989).

Formative or Ceramic Period (A.D. 200 to ca. A.D. 1400)
The project area is located within the Eastern Extension of the Jornada Mogollon. The eastern
boundary of the area extends from Lubbock and Crosbyton in the Texas Panhandle south to Iraan
including the saline lakes west of the Guadalupe Mountains (Corley 1965; Leslie 1979).
Formative Period sites are most commonly identified by the presence of undecorated brownware
ceramics. The appearance of ceramics in the Eastern Jornada Mogollon area and the sources of
those ceramics are areas of active research (Hogan 2006:4-16). One study places the introduction
of ceramics into southeastern New Mexico at around A.D. 200 (Hill and Staley 1999; Staley et al.
1996). In another study ceramics appear in artifact assemblages between A.D. 460 and 870 at the
Townshed site near Roswell (Akins 2003; Maxwell 1986). In the adjacent Sierra Blanca region,
recent excavations along the Rio Hondo, in Lincoln County reported that ceramics were not
present in artifact assemblages recovered from storage structures until around A.D. 500 (Railey
and Ruscavage-Barz 2008). The production of ceramics ends in the El Paso area and the
mountain zones of southeastern New Mexico sometime in the late fourteenth or early fifteenth
centuries (Miller 1995).
This discussion of the appearance of ceramics in western Texas is relevant because based on
recent composional studies of ceramics from this area indicates that the vast majority of
prehistoric ceramics were made in the El Paso area or in the mountainous areas of southeastern
New Mexico (Hill 2014; Speakman 2007). Consequently, undecorated prehistoric ceramics in
west Texas are not well dated as their appearance in the archaeological record is contingent on the
sources of the pottery.
Archaeological sites that produced undecorated prehistoric ceramics have been documented
previously in Loving county at 41LV18 located in the vicinity of the current project area (Clark
2015). This site is also characterized by the presence of chipped and groundstone artifacts and
scattered burned rock (Bement 1991).

Protohistoric Period (A.D. 1400/1450 to 1700)
The Protohistoric period is one of the least documented periods in southwestern archaeology. The
de-population and the virtual abandonment of agriculturally based subsistence strategies define
the Protohistoric period. The increase of hunter gatherer based subsistence strategies by native
groups have been put forth to explain the changes in adaptation and subsequent depopulation of
the area. Speth and Parry claim that deteriorating environmental conditions of this period may
have been the primary cause of changes in subsistence patterns (Speth and Perry 1978, 1980).
Worsening environmental conditions made what limited agriculture may have been practiced no
longer viable and adversely impacted local pant communities resulting in the populations in the
area becoming more mobile. They cite data that indicates bison herds were also affected by
adverse environmental conditions but not to the extent that plant resources were. Protohistoric
occupations are documented by the presence of post-prehistoric radiocarbon dated features. The
protohistoric radiocarbon evidence is fraught with confounding issues such as the “kinks” in the
radiocarbon curve or a lack of understanding what type of material or context that is being dated
(Bowman 1990; Schiffer 1986).
The archaeological records of the Protohistoric period may also contain remnants of Formative
groups that may have been ancestral to the present day Manso, Suma, Jano, Jacome, Piro, and
Chinarra (Beckett and Corbett 1992; Schroeder and Mason 1969). Other indigenous groups have
also been documented having been present in Loving county including the Lipan and Mescalero
Apache, Comanche and, the Jumano (Hickerson 1994; Rodruguez and Seymour 2017; Schroeder
7

APAC 17-10-15 PG 1 of 16

1973; Wade 2003). It is unclear to what extent most of these groups lasted or ranged but by the
end of the period only the Lipan and Mescalero Apache and Comanche remained in the region.
Sites from the Protohistoric and historic native site often display a low-density scatter of artifacts
consisting primarily of chipped stone assemblages. These lithic assemblages usually small
(Kurota 2017). Protohistoric occupations may also be mixed with cultural material from earlier
periods. Now a temporal affiliation should only be assigned if absolute dates can be obtained
using such methods as radiocarbon dating of annual or short-lived plants and Optical Stimulated
Luminescence (OSL). However, recent work in the region suggests that lithic typologies can be
developed and recognized these may even establish associations with specific Protohistoric
cultural groups (Seymour 2004; Seymour et al. 2002).

Historic Period (A.D. 1700 to the Mid-Twentieth Century)
The Historic Period has been traditionally viewed as beginning with the arrival of Coronado into
the Southwestern United States in 1540. However, because of the limited impact that Spanish
explorers and colonists had on the indigenous peoples of west Texas until the eighteenth century,
the boundary between the Protohistoric and Historic Periods in west Texas is not sharp. The
presence of Coronado's expedition in the Rio Grande Valley and a single excursion across the
Southern Plains probably did not have the local impact that the expedition of Antonio de Espejo
did while traveling down the Pecos River on the expeditions return to Mexico in 1583. A wellused trail, possibly a game trail, paralleled the Pecos River along the east side on which the
expedition traveled (Hammond 1929; Conkling and Conkling 1948). Expeditions sent out from
Pecos Pueblo in 1590 by Gaspar Castaño de Sosa also failed to locate any Indians south of the
pueblo, but probably did relocate the trail along the Pecos mentioned by Luxan during the Espejo
expedition (Schroeder and Matson 1965).
Antonio de Espejo crossed the area in 1583, fording the then-mighty Pecos at great risk. In 1854
Capt. John Pope surveyed the area for a railroad route. Convinced that he could drill artesian
wells there, he returned in 1855 and located Pope's Camp fifteen miles east of the mouth of
Delaware Creek in northwestern Loving County. After three years of unsuccessful attempts, Pope
and his men abandoned their camp. The Butterfield Overland Mail ran from a stage station
located at the site of Pope's Camp from 1858 until 1861 (Conkling and Conkling 1948; Smith
2017).
From 1837 to 1874 the area of Loving County was part of the Bexar land district. In 1874 the
Texas legislature separated Tom Green County from the Bexar District. In 1887 Loving County
was separated from Tom Green County, but it remained attached to Reeves County for judicial
purposes. A county election was held on July 8, 1893, eighty-three votes were reported, and
county organization was approved. Twelve miles north of the present-day Mentone the original
townsite of Mentone was laid out by the company organizers, was designated the county seat. A
general store and several adobe houses were built there. The Loving County Commissioners
Court voted to issue bonds valued at $6,000 to build a courthouse in Mentone. Although
construction began, the building was never completed (Smith 2017).
Taxes were not collected for 1893 and 1894 nor were taxes assessed or collected by the county
government for the years 1895 and 1896. County government was chaotic, and the state
legislature dissolved Loving County on May 12, 1897, reattaching it to Reeves County (Smith
2017).
After Mentone was abandoned in 1897, no town existed in Loving County. The 1900 census
reported a county population of eleven females and twenty-two males, all white. By 1910 the
8

APAC 17-10-15 PG 1 of 16

population grew to 248 whites and one black, after a legitimate land and irrigation promotion
established a settlement, called Juanita, in the southwestern corner of the county. The settlement,
which was renamed Porterville in 1910, had a post office, several businesses. Although several
irrigation projects were attempted at the late nineteenth and the first two decades of the twentieth
centuries, successful agribusiness in the county was restricted to ranching. A drought,
compounded by the failure of irrigation systems, reduced that number to sixty by 1914 (Smith
2017).
Beginning in the early 1920's the production of oil supplanted local agribusiness and drew new
settlers to Loving County. The larger population produced the town of Ramsey, a former oil field
camp. The resulting population growth led to the second organization of Loving County in 1931.
Ramsey was renamed Mentone and became the county seat. By 1933 several oil camps were built
in the county, and the population reached a record of 600. In 1939 Mentone reported a population
of 150 and twelve businesses. The census of 1940 listed a county population of 282 whites and 3
Hispanics.
DISCUSSION
An examination of the THC site files produced a listing of sixty-nine archaeological sites within
Loving County. Of these sites half (49.1 percent) were in the desert terrain leading to the Pecos
River. An additional six sites were located on Rudd Draw. Three sites were reported on the
northeast side of the county along Cheyenne Draw. The remainder of the sites are scattered across
the county. Some of these sites are in dunefields adjacent to playa lakes (Bement 1991).
Because of the transient nature of the prehistoric and historic peoples who formed the
archaeological record sites attributed to this period tend to lack cultural affiliation and consist
exclusively of chipped stone and burned caliche cobbles (Bement 1991: Clark 2015). The
presence of sites lacking a temporal affiliation beyond “unknown prehistoric” in the site records
for Loving County may be as much the result of the mobile nature of prehistoric adaption to the
area as the limited amount of material visible at the time of the survey.
Historic occupation of Loving county also indicates evidence of a mobile population. The original
county was simply not populous enough to continue as a discrete political entity. Later in time,
only one of the thirteen principal landowners listed between 1920 and 1926 gave his address as
Loving County. By 1969 only 26.7 percent of Loving County landowners lived on their land
(Smith 2017). Loving county historic economy was based first on attempts in the late nineteenth
and early twentieth centuries to develop agriculture along the Pecos River. Ranching took place
both near and away from the river. Oil production became important in the 1920's and into the
present. However, except for Ramsey, oil-related camps, did not develop into stable communities
with stable populations. It is likely that historic occupations away from the two town sites, both
names Mentone, and ranch houses will likely be small and represent short-term activities.

Management Summary
The cultural resource inventory was conducted at the request of Paul Donavan with Hillstone
Environmental Partners representing Hillstone Permian Rattlesnake, LLC. On 31 October 2017,
Jeffrey Pangburn, Mary Ann Paul and David V Hill with APAC conducted a class III
archaeological survey for the proposed right-of-way (ROW) connecting an existing pipeline riser
to a proposed tie-in location. The project was conducted to meet or exceed all current professional
standards for survey in Texas and New Mexico. The Bureau of Land Management Carlsbad Field
Office (BLM-CFO) is the lead agency for the report and as such required the survey into Texas to
comply with section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966. This ROW is for the
9

APAC 17-10-15 PG 1 of 16

proposed buried pipeline located in sections 19, 30 & 31 in T 26 S R 34 E; Lea County, New
Mexico and SF 13984 AB 1335 W/1320 N/BLK 76 and section 1, block 76 in Loving County,
Texas.

Hillstone Permian Rattlesnake, LLC. had the centerline of the proposed ROW delineated with
lathe and marking tape prior to the cultural survey. The beginning of line (BOL) for this project
starts at the an existing pipeline riser connecting to a proposed tie-in location. The line is a total
of 12308.4’ in length and was surveyed with a 200’ wide survey corridor. The New Mexico
portion is 8448’ (+/-) in length and the Texas portion is 3860.4’ in length equaling 56.51 acres
surveyed for this project. The direct effect of the project ROW totals 12308.4' x 50’ (+/-) equaling
14.13 acres. The indirect effect of the project ROW totals 12308.4' x 150’ (+/-) equaling 42.38
acres.
Research Design
Per a consultation with Bruce Boeke a BLM Archeological Consultant, it was determined that the
proposed ROW for the buried pipeline would be surveyed with a 200’ (+/-) wide corridor
centered on the marked right-of-way. The impacted area for the proposed ROW is estimated to
be a 50’ (+/-) wide corridor centered on the marked right-of-way. The survey corridor is 200’ (+/) wide centered on the delineated right-of-way. The cultural investigation was conducted by
means of a pedestrian survey, with one field person, walking at 15-meter intervals for 100%
coverage of the survey area. This survey was designed to meet, but not limited to, the
requirements detailed in the BLM Manual Supplement H-8100-1 New Mexico, Oklahoma and
Texas, Procedures for Performing Cultural Resource Fieldwork on Public Lands in the area of
New Mexico BLM Responsibilities 2002. The authority for these standards comes in part from
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, the Antiquities Act of 1906 and
the Historic Sites Act of 1935, along with all additional federal and state laws for preserving and
protecting cultural resources.
The proposed ROW crosses through a coppice dune field in Lea County, New Mexico to the
connecting buried pipeline in Loving County, Texas. Impacts to the proposed project ROW
include existing lease road, fence line, pipelines and various other oil field developments. The
survey area of the proposed ROW is plotted on the attached project map. Location plots for the
project were obtained by utilizing a survey grade hand held GPS.

Results
Cultural Resources: No cultural resources were found within current study area.
Prefield investigations of the proposed project area consist of the review of web sites and project
files located at the BLM-CFO, the Archaeological Records Management Section (ARMS) and the
General Land Office (GLO). The ARMS and GLO search was conducted on 24 October 2017,
the records search at the BLM followed on the 31 October 2017. The review of the Texas
Historical Commission data-base was completed on 31 October 2017. The results of these
searches located 2 cultural sites (41LV30 & 41LV31) in Texas and 1 site (LA 128097) within a ¼
mile of the project area. A review of the GLO files found no historical patents intersecting with
this proposed right-of-way.
