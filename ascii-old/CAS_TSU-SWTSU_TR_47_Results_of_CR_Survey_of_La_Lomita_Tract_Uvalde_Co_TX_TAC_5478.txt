During a four-day period in February, 2001, the Center for Archaeological Studies, Texas State
University-San Marcos performed an intensive pedestrian survey for Uvalde County. The County proposed
to develop a 241-acre tract of land located immediately west of the town of Uvalde into a multi-use facility
designed ultimately to help stimulate economic growth in the county. The campus will be occupied by
businesses and educational facilities, and will attract tourism to the area. The project is self-funded in
part by Uvalde County, supported by a grant from the U.S. Economic Development Administration. This
combination of funds required that the project be coordinated under requirements of Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act and with the Texas Antiquities Code.
The survey recorded three prehistoric sites (41UV492, 41UV493, and 41UV494), all of which were
general lithic scatters lacking time-diagnostic information. The sites also appear to lack any stratigraphic
or contextual integrity. CAS recommends that these sites have no real potential to contribute to the current
understanding of regional history or prehistory, and that none is potentially eligible for listing to the
National Register of Historic Places or worthy of designation as a State Archaeological Landmark. Based on
these findings, CAS recommends that the County be granted regulatory permission to proceed with this
undertaking without further consideration of its potential effects on cultural resources. The possibility that
the project could have an indirect effect on nearby historic properties was coordinated by the County with
assistance from a separate consulting firm and is not addressed in this report. No artifacts were collected
during this project. All records and notes from the fieldwork will be permanently curated at the Center for
Archaeological Studies, Texas State University-San Marcos. Field work was carried out by Antonio E. Padilla
(Project Archaeologist), Amy Benton, and Veronica Suarez.

Chapter 1. Introduction
This report presents the results of a cultural resources survey performed by the Center for Archaeological
Studies (CAS) for the 241-acre La Lomita Commercial Development Project, located immediately west
of the town of Uvalde in Uvalde County, Texas. This undertaking will result in a commercial development
complex intended to assist in the economic development of Uvalde County (Figure 1). Facilities will include
a wildlife-viewing center, hiking trails, a hotel, an improved fairgrounds complex, a regional wildlife
development and educational center, as well as business facilities (Figure 2). Funding for this undertaking
derives partly from a grant awarded by the U.S. Economic Development Administration (EDA), and partly
from county funds.
Uvalde County is a political subdivision of the State of Texas, and therefore is required to comply
with the Texas Antiquities Code (TAC). The TAC requires that projects such as the La Lomita project
consider the potential impact of the project on any cultural resources that might be present and that might
contribute information that is meaningful or significant to understanding the history and prehistory of the
State of Texas. Cultural resources located on land owned or controlled by the State of Texas or its political
subdivisions are protected by the TAC (Texas Natural Resources Code, Title 9, Chapter 191), which identifies
significant sites as State Archaeological Landmarks (SALs). Should any historic or prehistoric sites located
on land that is designated for impact during development be determined eligible for formal designation
of landmark status under the TAC, some measure of protection or mitigation of impact may be necessary.
The formal designation of SALs, as well as their administration, is the responsibility of the Texas Historical
Commission (THC).
The TAC generally requires that a complete archaeological survey be performed in conjunction with
projects that fall under its purview, particularly in areas that have not previously been surveyed and in
regions where cultural resources are expected. Any resources determined to be significant must then be
avoided, protected, or their destruction mitigated by approved data recovery programs.
Worthiness for designation as a SAL is defined in the TAC. If an archaeological site is situated on
land owned or controlled by the State of Texas or one of its political subdivisions, it may be considered
significant and be recognized or designated as a State Archaeological Landmark, provided that at least one
of the following conditions is met (Rules and Practice, Chapter 41:10):
(a)

preservation of materials must be sufficient to allow application of standard archaeological
techniques to advantage; and/or

(b) the majority of artifacts are in place so that a significant portion of the site’s original
characteristics can be defined through investigation; and/or
(c)

the site has the potential to contribute to cumulative cultural history by the addition of new
information; and/or

(d) the site offers evidence of unique or rare attributes; and/or
(e) the site offers a unique or rare opportunity to test techniques, theory, or method of
preservation, thereby contributing to scientific knowledge.
The use of Federal funds for this undertaking requires that it also comply with Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). The NHPA created the National Register of Historic Places

(NRHP), and states that the Advisory Council for Historic Preservation must be afforded the opportunity
to comment when any cultural resources potentially eligible for inclusion in the NRHP are present in an
area affected by an undertaking permitted, licensed, or funded by Federal agency actions. Eligibility for
inclusion in the NRHP is linked to site “significance” as defined by the National Park Service rule 36 CFR
Part 60. Four criteria are applied to archaeological sites in determining their significance. These criteria
address properties that are:
(a)

associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our
history; or

(b) that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
(c)

that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or
that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a
significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or

(d) that have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history.
Section 106 requires that agencies involved in these undertakings not only consider the direct effect
of a project on cultural resources that may be present, but also the indirect effect of these undertakings on
nearby resources in terms of alterations of sight lines, viewsheds, and/or increased levels of noise pollution.
A cultural resources survey was carried out for the entire 241-acre area of potential effect (APE) under
Texas Antiquities Permit No. 5878, issued to Jon C. Lohse and the Center for Archaeological Studies, Texas
State University-San Marcos. This survey was designed to identify and assess archaeological sites in the
APE, and follows and exceeds the minimal survey requirements for project areas of this size set forth by
the Council of Texas Archaeologists and adopted by the THC. Based on project coordination with the THC,
it was determined that the undertaking would not have any indirect effect whatsoever on nearby cultural
resources (correspondence between Linda Henderson and Thomas Eisenhour, dated 15 February, 2011).
This report describes the project area in terms of environmental setting and culture history. It then presents
the methods employed for this survey and describes the results of this work. Three sites, all prehistoric,
were recorded (41UV491, 41UV492, and 41UV493), and all three reflect lithic procurement and earlystage tool reduction. None is considered eligible for listing to the NRHP or merits designation as a SAL.
Considering the apparently minimal nature of the data that can potentially be derived from these sites, the
report recommends that Uvalde County be granted regulatory clearance to proceed with the proposed
undertaking without further consideration for its possible effects on historic or prehistoric properties.

Chapter 2. Project Area Setting
The project area is located in Uvalde County, in west-central Texas (see Figure 3), south of the Edwards
Plateau in the South Texas Brush Country of the Gulf Coastal Plains. The Balcones Escarpment, an arcshaped fault zone, forms the boundary between the Edwards Plateau and the South Texas Plains. The
Edwards Plateau is generally described as flat and rolling. However, along the margins, where the Balcones
Escarpment separates the two regions, the area contains many canyons and well-drained hillsides. Ecotones,
or transitional zones between environmental regions, support diverse animal and plant populations, and are
abundant in natural resources (Crumely 1994). Therefore, the location of the project area makes it a likely
area for historic and prehistoric human occupations.

Figure 3. Location of project area, indicated by red arrow, in relation to environmental provinces of Texas.
Below, brief descriptions of the project area are presented in terms of geology and soils, climate and
weather, and flora and fauna. These sections are followed by an overview of the cultural history of the region,
and then by a review of previous archaeological investigations near the APE.

Geology and Soils
The Edwards Plateau is composed of resistant Cretaceous limestone and dolomite that originate from the
Trinity, Woodbine, Glen Rose, Walnut, Edwards, and Fredericksburg geologic groups. Chert, a raw material
used for prehistoric stone tool manufacture, occurs in seams as tabular nodules in these formations and is
particularly common in outcrops along the Balcones Escarpment. Water has dissolved this region through
karstic processes, leaving a sharply undulating landscape that is incised with stream channels flowing
toward the Gulf of Mexico. The Edwards Plateau also contains extensive subterranean cavities and sinkholes,
which collect rainfall and recharge underground aquifers and natural reservoirs forming artesian springs at
the base of the Escarpment. The Gulf Coastal Plain in the southern part of Uvalde County can be described
as mostly nearly level to gently sloping or undulating hills.
According to Stevens and Richmond (1970), the soils in this area include Knippa clay, 0 to 1 percent
slopes (KnA) and 1 to 3 percent slopes (KnB); Montell clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes (MoA); Olmos and Ector
soils, undulating (OLB); Olmos soils, undulating (OMB); Tobosa clay, 0 to 1 percent slopes (ToA); and Uvalde
silty clay loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes (UvA). All of these soils are within the so-called Uvalde-Knippa-Montell
association, which is nearly level to gently sloping and is characterized by deep, loamy and clayey soils.

Climate and Weather
The climate in Uvalde County is subtropical and can be characterized by dry winters and hot, humid
summers. The average annual rainfall is 23.7 inches, which occurs most frequently as the result of
thunderstorm activity. Monthly and yearly rainfall amounts vary greatly; however the maximum amount
of rain usually falls during the late spring and early summer months. There is a wide annual range in
temperature. Winters are mild, and sleet or snowfalls usually occur about once per year. Hot weather
is steady from late May to mid-September, with the daily maximum temperature exceeding 99° F
approximately 41 days per year (Bomar 1983).

Flora and Fauna
The project area lies within the Tamaulipan biotic province and contains flora and fauna that are
characteristic of both the South Texas Plains and the Edwards Plateau. The South Texas Plains region that
extends into the project area has been invaded by brush (low trees and shrubs) due to the overgrazing
that has occurred from its long use as rangeland. The vegetation in this portion of the project area consists
of mesquite (Prosopis sp.), prickly pear (Opuntia sp.), tasajillo (Opuntia leptocaulis sp.), lotebush (Ziziphus
obtusifolia), whitebrush (Aloysia ligustrina), cenizo (Leucophyllum frutescens), and guayacan (Porlieria
angustifolia). Several acacias are also present, including blackbrush (Acacia rigidula), catclaw (A. gregii),
huisache (A. farnesiana), and guajillo (A. berlandieri). The vegetation in the Edwards Plateau region in the
northern portion of the project area consists of live oak (Quercus virginiana), shinnery oak (Q. durandii), red
oak (Q. buckleyi) juniper (Juniperus sp.) and buffalo grass (Buchloe dactyloides)(Gould 1975).
As described by Blair (1950), fauna typically found in the area include white-tailed deer (Odocoileus
virginianus), cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus), jackrabbit (Lepus californicus), raccoon (Procyon lotor),

6

javelina (Pecari tajacu), coyote (Canis latrans) wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), roadrunner (Geococcyx
californianus) as well as many other birds, snakes, insects, fishes and lizards. Endangered and threatened
species in the area include the interior least tern (Sterna antillarum athalassos), the ocelot (Felis pardalis), the
jaguarondi (F. yagouaroundi) and the American black bear (Ursus americanus).

Chapter 3. Cultural History
Uvalde County, located along the transitional border between the central and southern Texas archaeological
subregions, has an archeological record that reaches back more than 11,500 radiocarbon years ago.
Although the Balcones Escarpment forms a distinct physiographic boundary between the Edwards
Plateau and the South Texas Plains, it may not have functioned so clearly as a prehistoric cultural boundary.
The South Texas Plains are defined as an occupational zone, but they do not have a unique occupational
chronology (Hester 2004). Although the most commonly recorded sites in South Texas are open occupation
sites, comparatively few of these sites have been excavated. According to Hester (2004), the South Texas
archaeological record has been negatively impacted by “natural erosion, reservoir projects, urban
expansion, relic collecting, and hobbyist activities.” These influences, combined with a lack of intensive
excavations, contribute to a poorly understood chronology. The chronology that is present in the area is
loosely comparable to that from Central Texas. The available archaeological evidence from Central Texas
has been synthesized by Black (1995), Hester (1995, 2004), and Collins (1995, 2004) and is summarized
below. Human presence is divided into the Prehistoric, Protohistoric and Historic periods.
The Prehistoric period is divided into three major temporal stages, the Paleoindian, Archaic and Late
Prehistoric. The Paleoindian stage begins with the earliest known human occupation of North America and
extends to approximately 8800 years before present (BP). The Archaic stage follows, extending from ca.
8800 BP to 1250 BP. The Late Prehistoric stage begins ca. 1250 BP and is characterized by the development of
bow and arrow and ceramic technologies. The Protohistoric and Historic periods are defined by the earliest
Spanish entradas to the region and the beginning of widespread Anglo-American settlements, respectively.

Paleoindian
Collins (1995:381–385, 2004) dates the Paleoindian period in Central Texas to 11,500–8800 BP; we divide
the Paleoindian into Early (ca. 11,500–10,200 BP) and Late (ca. 10,200–8800 BP) phases. Early Paleoindian
artifacts are associated with the Clovis and Folsom cultures and diagnostic items include fluted, lanceolate
projectile points. Clovis is also characterized by well-made prismatic blades (Collins 1995; Green 1964).
The Early Paleoindian stage is generally characterized by nomadic cultures that relied heavily on hunting
large game animals (Black 1989). However, recent research suggests that early Paleoindian subsistence
patterns were considerably more diverse than previously thought and included reliance on small-bodied,
local fauna, including turtles (Black 1989; Bousman et al. 2004; Collins and Brown 2000; Hester 1983; Lemke
and Timperley 2008). In contrast with Clovis, Folsom cultures are considered to have been relatively
focused on the exploitation of bison, and maintained a somewhat more mobile lifestyle than did their Clovis
antecedents.
The Late Paleoindian stage occurs from ca.10,200 BP to 8800 BP. Reliable evidence for these dates
was recovered from the Wilson-Leonard site, in Williamson County (Bousman et al. 2004; Collins 1998). At
Wilson-Leonard, archaeologists excavated an occupation known as Wilson, named for the unique cornernotched projectile point. The dense occupation also included a human burial (Bousman et al. 2004; Collins
1998). In addition to the Wilson occupation, Golondrina-Barber and St. Mary’s Hall components, dating
between 9500 and 8800 BP, were excavated. Collins (1995) has suggested that these components are

9

transitional between the Paleoindian and Archaic Periods due to notched projectile points and burned-rock
cooking features.

Archaic
Collins (1995, 2004) has contended that the Archaic stage in Central Texas lasted approximately 7500 years,
from 8800 BP to 1200/1300 BP, following Weir (1976) in dividing the Archaic into Early, Middle and Late
Archaic periods. The Archaic marks several important transitions: shifting hunting foci from Pleistocene
megafauna to smaller animals; the increased use of plant food resources and use of ground stones in food
processing; increased implementation of cook-stone technology; increased use of organic materials for tool
manufacture and an increase in the number and variety of lithic tools for woodworking; greater population
stability and less residential mobility; and systematic burial of the dead. What appears to represent a new
emphasis on organic materials in tool technologies and diet is most likely a reflection of preservation bias.
Early Archaic
Although Collins (1995:383, 2004) has argued that the Early Archaic extends from 8800 to 6000 BP based on
three divisions of projectile point types, the current project considers the Early Archaic to extend from 8800
to 5800 BP. Changes in lithic technology, such as notched projectile points and specialized tools (e.g. Clear
Fork and Guadalupe bifaces), as well as a dietary adjustment, as evidenced by the increased number of
ground stone artifacts and rock cooking features, distinguish this cultural period from previous ones (Collins
1995; Turner and Hester 1993:246–256). A variable climate and concomitant variation in highly-ranked
game resources such as bison (e.g., Dillehay 1974) are strongly related to a shift in subsistence, and Collins
(1995) has suggested that Early Archaic peoples occupied the wetter portions of the Edwards Plateau. Early
Archaic sites are thinly dispersed and are seen across a wide area of Texas and northern Mexico (Weir
1976). Johnson (1991) noted a concentration of Early Archaic components along the southeastern margins of
the Edwards Plateau, close to major springs.
Middle Archaic
The Middle Archaic, ca. 5800–4000 BP, is approximately marked by the onset of the Altithermal, a climatic
period of intense dryness and relatively high temperatures. Climate fluctuated from arid to mesic and
back to arid in Central Texas during this period. Vegetation and wildlife regimes all responded to these
environmental oscillations, as did human groups. Collins (1995) has divided the Middle Archaic period
by projectile point style intervals: Bell-Andice-Calf Creek, Taylor, and Nolan and Travis. The Bell-AndiceCalf Creek (Calf Creek) interval was a mesic period when grasslands, attractive to bison herds, expanded
southward into Central and South Texas. Calf Creek peoples, as evidenced by hunting-based lithic
technology, centralized bison exploitation into their subsistence economies during this period. Following
the Calf Creek horizon, climates reverted to a more arid condition, and Taylor bifaces (also called Early
Triangular) define many assemblages dating to this transitional period. Later in the Middle Archaic, Taylor
bifaces were replaced by Nolan and Travis points (Collins 1995, 2004). The Nolan-Travis interval was a
period when temperature and aridity were at their greatest levels. Prehistoric inhabitants acclimated to
peak aridity through increased utilization of xerophytes such as sotol (Johnson and Goode 1994). These

10

plants were typically baked in earth ovens and reflected the development of burned rock middens.
During more arid episodes, the aquifer-fed streams and resource-rich environments of Central Texas were
extensively utilized (Story 1985:40; Weir 1976:125, 128).
Late Archaic
The Central Texas Late Archaic dates to approximately 4000–1250 BP (Collins 1995:384, 2004). The Late
Archaic, according to Johnson and Goode (1994), is marked by two significant cultural traits: 1) billetthinning of bifacial knives and projectile points increased in terms of artistry and technology, and 2) human
population appears to have increased in size. These patterns vary considerably through time and from one
subregion to another, but strongly shape the archaeological record of the Late Archaic. Overall, evidence
suggests an increasingly mesic climate through the Late Archaic (Collins 1995; Johnson and Goode 1994;
Mauldin et al. 2011). Mauldin et al. (2011) suggested that climatic variation resulted in a general decrease
in grassland bison range. Some archaeologists have noted the presence of large cemeteries at sites such
as Ernest Witte (Hall 1981) and Olmos Dam (Lukowski 1988) and even smaller ones like Zatopec (Lohse
2011) as evidence that populations increased and that groups were becoming territorial (Story 1985:44–45).
However, other archaeologists have challenged the interpretation of increased population density by citing
a decrease in the number of burned rock middens (Prewitt 1981:80–81).

Late Prehistoric
Collins (1995, 2004) has dated the Late Prehistoric in Central Texas at 1,300/1,200–260 BP, following Kelley
(1947) in dividing it into Austin and Toyah phases. The current project delimits the Austin phase to 1250–750
BP and the Toyah phase to 750–300 BP. The most distinctive changes in relation to previous eras include a
technological shift away from the dart and atlatl to the bow and arrow, and the approximately concurrent
incorporation of pottery (Black 1989:32; Story 1985:45–47).
Austin Phase
The Austin phase is characterized primarily by the appearance of arrow points, including Scallorn and
Edwards types. Evidence of increasing social strife, if not of overall population growth, is seen in multiple
burials from Central Texas that date to this period. Burials from this time reveal numerous instances of
deaths associated with arrow wounds, suggesting that population growth may have been associated with
disputes over limited resource availability (Black 1989; Meissner 1991; Prewitt 1974). Burned rock middens
are occasionally found with these types of points (Houk and Lohse 1993), and ground and pecked stone
tools, used for plant food processing, become increasingly common in the Austin phase. Aside from the
adoption of bow and arrow technology, many Austin components exhibit strong similarities with lateperiod Late Archaic deposits (Lohse 2011), suggesting some cultural continuity between these periods. No
irrefutable evidence exists for bison exploitation during the Austin phase.
Toyah Phase
The beginning of the Toyah phase (750 BP) in Central Texas is characterized by contracting stem points
with flaring, barbed shoulders, a style known as Perdiz; by the common occurrence of blade technology

11

considered to be part of a specialized Toyah bison hunting and processing toolkit (Black and McGraw 1985;
Huebner 1991; Ricklis 1994); and by the appearance of bone-tempered pottery (Johnson 1994:241–281).
The wide variety of ceramic styles and influences seen throughout Toyah phase ceramic assemblages
provides important information concerning the social composition of these cultural groups: Toyah ceramic
assemblages display Caddo, Texas Gulf Coast, and Jornada Mogollon influences (Arnn 2005). In addition
to shifts in material technology, Mauldin et al. (2011) have suggested that bison herds foraged across
increasingly widespread ranges, at least partly in response to climatic patterns described above. They
concluded that this change in bison herd behavior is partly responsible for what they identified as a change
in Toyah hunting strategy, involving increasingly logistically organized hunting forays in pursuit of spatially
dispersed herds (also Dering 2008). Based on the ratio of zooarchaeological to archaeobotanical data
associated with types of sites (e.g. bulk plant processing, bulk meat processing, residential), Dering (2008)
provided further evidence of Toyah phase logistically-oriented subsistence strategies and concludes that
Toyah diets were not focused on bison but remained broad. Included with logistical subsistence strategies
was what appears to be either trade for horticultural products not produced in Central Texas, or of low
intensity, localized horticultural practices. Both scenarios involve maize, which is exceedingly uncommon
in Toyah-period archaeological contexts but which has been reported from at least three locales, the Kyle
Rockshelter (41HI1) in Hill County (Jelks 1962), Bear Branch (41CA13) in Callahan County (Adams 2002),
and the Timmeron Rockshleter (41HY95) in Hays County (Harris 1985).

Protohistoric and Historic
In Texas, the Protohistoric period, also known as the Spanish Entrada period, was marked by Spanish
entradas, the formal expeditions from established forts and missions in Northern Mexico into Central,
Coastal, and East Texas in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. These expeditions began
with the venture into Texas by the Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca and the Narváez expedition in 1528.
The period is generally dated between 1500 and 1700 (or 1528, the date of the Cabeza de Vaca/ Narváez
expedition, to the establishment of the first Spanish mission, Mission San Antonio de Valero in 1718).
Spanish exploration of the project area did not occur until more than a century later when expeditions
crossed into present-day Val Verde and Maverick Counties. The diary of the Bosque-Larios entrada provides
information on the indigenous cultures that inhabited the project area during the Spanish Colonial era
(Wade 2003). During this time, numerous missions, such as the Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria Mission,
established in 1762, were constructed. These missions were challenged by conflicts with Comanche and
Apache populations. The Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria Mission was abandoned in 1767 due to these
conflicts.
On January 9, 1790, Juan de Ugalde, governor of Coahuila and commandant of the Provincias Internas,
led 600 soldiers to a victory over the Apaches near the modern town of Utopia. In honor of his victory the
canyon area was named Cañon de Ugalde. This region was also influenced by the utilization of the Camino
Real or Old San Antonio road beginning in the late 17th century. This network of roads passed through
present day Maverick and Dimmit Counties, connecting the Rio Grande region with San Antonio and the
settlements of East Texas (McGraw et al. 1998). Spanish influence continued to increase over the region until

12

the Texas Revolution, when the Camino Real was used by Mexican Soldiers traveling to San Antonio (Ochoa
2011).
Fort Inge, established in 1849, was located at the base of Mount Inge and became a focus for the early
settlement of Uvalde County. The Canyon de Ugalde Land Company began purchasing land grants in
prime locations along the river valleys of Uvalde County in the late 1830s and then resold them to frontier
settlers. Reading W. Black, a purchaser of a vast amount of land within the Nueces River valley, successfully
redirected roads to Eagle Pass, El Paso, and California through his property and opened a general store
that quickly became a marketing center for the soldiers at Fort Inge as well as local ranchers, farmers
and traders. Black’s land also facilitated later railroad development. The subsequent wealth and migrant
settlement in the region soon produced an environment of lawlessness, predominantly during the Civil War
and for a few decades thereafter (Ochoa 2011). During the late 1860s and into the 1880s, the region was
home to smugglers, cattle and horse rustlers, and desperadoes such as the notorious King Fisher.
The Eastern Division of the Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railroad was begun on March
1, 1881 and reached Uvalde on January 15, 1882. Lawlessness and disorder eventually subsided and
agriculture and ranching reemerged in the region as numerous Mexican workers migrated into the region
after the 1910 Mexican Revolution. During the Great Depression, many Mexican migrants returned to
Mexico, and the remaining ranchers and farmers endured a dramatic decline in both sales and production.
Many of Uvalde’s remaining residents sold pecans to survive. After World War II, farming and ranching
returned, resulting in a new era of prosperity and development. Today, ranching, farming and harvesting
pecans remain major industries in Uvalde County (Ochoa 2011).

Chapter 4. Previously Identified Cultural Resources
No previously identified archaeological sites exist within the project area. The nearest site, site 41UV125,
is located approximately 1170 meters south of the southwest corner of the project area. Site 41UV125 was
discovered above a small drainage during a surface survey and was recorded in 1983. The site consists of a
light scatter of lithic debitage and burned rock fragments. The site is approximately 100 meters in diameter
and contains no visible features. The area is covered by low brush vegetation and contains reddish brown,
shallow and rocky soils. 41UV125 is reported to be extensively disturbed and damaged and interpreted as a
small chert working area.
The next closest site from the project area, site 41HY64, is located approximately 2650 meters northeast
of the northeast corner of the project area. Site 41HY64, found and recorded in 1974, is reported to be a
quarry site containing ten hearths and a gravel-covered terrace. It is positioned in a brush-covered pasture
adjacent to an old railroad and Cooks Slough, a significant drainage system in the area.
Site 41UV68, a multi-component prehistoric and historic archaeological site, measures approximately
2870 meters northeast of the northeast corner of the project area and 885 meters southeast of site 41UV64.
Bordered by Cooks Slough to the east and south, site 41UV68 was initially investigated in 1975 by the Texas
State Department of Highways and Public Transportation in order to gather data for intersite comparisons
and mitigation for highway construction. The site was recorded by Daymond Crawford as a terrace site
with a dense scatter of lithic debitage and burned rock. It was revisited by Hicks & Company during the
AEP/LCRA Del Rio project and was recorded in July of 2003. During this project, the site was subjected
to pedestrian survey and shovel testing, and was found to consist of a dense, historic, domestic scatter of
turn-of-the-century glass and ceramics. It also contained surficial and subsurface hearths, burned rock
features, and lithic scatters of debitage and tools. This area is also covered by low brush vegetation and the
soil is silty loam with limestone gravel. Because of its deep, stratified prehistoric deposits, possible multiple
prehistoric occupations and organic preservation in burned limestone features, site 41UV68 was considered
to be of potentially moderate to high significance. It was recommended that the site be avoided in all future
work or formally SAL-tested if impacts were necessary. Following THC concurrence, site 41UV68 underwent
three additional archaeological investigations by Hicks & Company in order to mitigate the impacts of the
transmission line upgrade project on its cultural resources. Throughout these tests, H&C researchers again
observed prehistoric and historic artifacts. New information regarding site 41UV68 that was obtained from
the first two of these three investigations includes a marked decrease in artifact density toward the south
and scattered and disturbed contexts east of Cooks Slough. The third and last H&C investigation of site
41UV68 yielded data indicating the presence of two distinct buried prehistoric occupation zones dating
between the Transitional Archaic and the Late Prehistoric. The site was therefore deemed eligible for SAL
status (Miller et al. 2007)
Based on the similarity in the soil compositions of site 41UV68 and the project area, there is a potential
for buried cultural deposits to be present within the APE. However, they are not likely to be deeply buried
and any prehistoric deposits that are present have a high probability of being poorly stratified.

Chapter 5. Methods and Results
The 241.45-acre survey of the APE was conducted during a four-day period, February 21–24, 2011.
Approximately 12 person-days were spent in the field to complete the survey. Methods and density of
shovel testing complied with, or exceeded, the THC’s minimum requirements for field projects of this size at
three shovel tests per acre for parcels exceeding 200 acres.
Preparations for the survey consisted of a logistical plan prepared in advance with transect lines at 40
m intervals on aerial photographs and a topographic map. Each field archaeologist was provided copies
of the aerial and topographic maps, and a handheld global positioning system (GPS, Magellen Triton), and
was assigned a transect line with a targeted number of shovel tests. Transect lines were designated by an
alpha prefix and individual shovel tests along each transect line were numbered, so that shovel test A-2
identified the second test along the first transect (Transect A). Subsequently when all letters had been used
in denoting transect lines, the alpha prefix was doubled (e.g., AA). In general, each crew member followed
his/her own transect, walking parallel with other crew members. Occasionally, for logistical reasons, two
crew members would “leapfrog” along one transect, each digging alternating shovel tests. Due to the
topographic setting of the APE, tests were selectively placed in preferred site locations, such as at the top of
the knoll and in other level areas.
The location of each shovel test was recorded by GPS. All shovel tests were 30–35 cm in diameter and
all were dug to basal clay (pre-terminal Pleistocene in age), or to 100 cm below ground surface if no clay
was present. Tests were individually recorded with regard to depth, soil type and color, and cultural material
present. Tests were dug in arbitrary levels not exceeding 20 cm in thickness and all excavated material was
screened through 1/4 in. (6.4 mm) mesh. All shovel tests were backfilled. Artifacts noted in the field were
described and then returned to the shovel test units as they were backfilled. According to the Scope of Work
and landowner request, only time-diagnostic artifacts were to be collected; none were encountered during
the field project and no artifacts whatsoever were collected.
In the case of a positive shovel test, indicating the presence of cultural materials, additional probes
were excavated in the immediate vicinity at 10 m distances for up to six tests in an area. If more than one
of these tests were positive or if more than two artifacts were found in any single test, then the location was
designated as a site. At each site all positive shovel tests, features, datums, and roads were recorded using a
Trimble GeoXT handheld GPS unit.
Site boundaries were delineated by excavating multiple shovel tests in the area to identify zones of
no artifacts. Generally, these were in cardinal directions from the initial positive test. Site boundaries were
defined on the basis of subsurface artifact distribution, complemented by surface artifacts and features
(where present), topography, soil exposures, and other relevant criteria. Additionally, the surfaces of sites
were visually inspected for artifact distribution, and site size was determined by the extent of the surface
artifacts together with subsurface data. Based on the distribution of negative shovel tests or absence of
surface artifacts, site boundaries were prominently marked with fluorescent pink flagging tape. Sites were
photographed and mapped. All site data were recorded onto State of Texas site data forms. All records
pertaining to the project will be curated at CAS.

Survey Results
The survey consisted of systematic visual inspection of the entire surface area accompanied by the
excavation of 80 shovel tests on assigned transects. The project area consists of a large knoll at the center of
the property with an associated floodplain located at its base to the north (see Figure 1). Many roads have
been cut through the parcel, and areas have been cleared or thinned for hunting activities (Figures 4, 5).
During the survey numerous artifacts were observed scattered across the ground surface. Artifacts were
observed along the slope of the knoll, within the cut roads, and along the northern floodplain area of the
APE. Only 12 of the 80 shovel tests excavated proved positive for cultural material, but only six were located
in areas considered to be in good context and not within disturbed areas or along the slope of the knoll.
Based on those shovel tests and the presence of surface scatters of cultural material, three prehistoric sites,
41UV492, 41UV493, and 41UV494, were identified (Figure 6).

by low brush with patches of open terrain. Pink survey tape on tree at left-center marks one of the survey transects.
A power line running through the survey area is visible at the top center of the photo.
41UV492
Site 41UV492 is a prehistoric lithic scatter of undetermined age measuring 22 by 12 m (total area is
approximately 232 m2). The site is situated on a floodplain within a clearing at the southwestern corner
of the parcel near a turnoff of a bladed road. Vegetation observed at the site consisted of prickly pear,
lotebush, whitebrush, guayacan, blackbrush, and cat-claw underlain by buffalo grass and other short
grasses. Due to the vegetation on the site, visibility was limited to approximately 40 percent. The ground
surface was very dry with visible cracks in the soil measuring approximately 1/2 inch wide.

The site was discovered on transect while meandering through thick brush, and a scatter of lithic
material was observed in a clearing near a road. Cultural material observed on the surface consisted of
core flakes, broken modified flakes, and angular debris. No features or concentrations were observed.
In addition to the cultural material observed on the surface, eight shovel tests were excavated yielding
10 artifacts from two shovel tests (Table 1). The majority of the cultural material encountered was located at
a depth between 20 and 40 cm. Artifacts observed in the shovel tests consisted only of flakes. No diagnostic
artifacts were encountered. Terminations of the shovel tests were rather shallow, only reaching a maximum
depth of 40 cmbs due to the presence of compact clay. Soils encountered within the shovel tests consisted of
soils from Olmos and Ector soils that are typically classified as deep loamy and clayey soils.

This site is a very small prehistoric lithic scatter of undetermined age. The scatter is predominately
located on the ground surface and consists of core flakes, broken modified flakes, and angular debris.
Limited subsurface remains were encountered in two of the eight shovel tests excavated on the site.
Although cultural material was encountered within the two shovel tests, this cultural material was located
at shallow depths (< 40 cmbs). Additionally, all but one shovel tests could be excavated to no more than
approximately 40 cmbs before the sterile underlying clay was encountered. The shallowness of artifacts and
shovel test depths suggest that much of the sediment that caps this clay mantle may be highly susceptible
to mixing, erosion, compression, and/or deflation. These factors raise serious questions concerning the
contextual integrity of the deposits. Moreover, the presence of large (> 1/2 inch) cracks on the surface
means that cultural materials may easily have slipped or moved down-profile since the site was last
occupied in prehistoric times. Any or all artifacts recovered from below the surface may have fallen into the
cracks and through time migrated downward with the shrinking and swelling of the soils.
41UV493
Site 41UV493 is a large prehistoric lithic scatter of undetermined age measuring 1133 by 372 m in size (total
area of approximately 351,697m2). The site is situated on the northern portion of the floodplain at the base of
the large knoll (see Figure 6). The site is bounded to the south by the base of the knoll and on the east, north,
and west by fence lines; it runs the east-to-west length of the APE. Roads and pedestrian trails cut through
the site with one road along the transmission line serving as the main entrance to the parcel (see Figure 6).

20

Cleared areas serve as locations for feeders and hunting blinds. Vegetation at the site consists of prickly
pear, lotebush, whitebrush, guayacan, blackbrush, and cat-claw underlain by buffalo grass and other short
grasses. Due to vegetation, visibility was limited to 40 percent and artifacts were primarily visible within
clearings of the vegetation, the road, and in sendero cuts. The ground surface was very dry with visible
cracks in the soil measuring approximately 1/2 inch wide.
Several transects were conducted through the site area. On those transects, artifacts were observed
loosely scattered across the entire surface from fence to fence, and fence to the base of the knoll with no
indication of specific activity areas or distinct boundaries. No clearly evident spatial patterning could
be seen among the surface scatter, and no zones that were obviously clear of cultural remains could be
identified. Artifacts present on the surface consisted of cores, unifaces, first- and second-stage bifaces,
crudely modified flakes, broken flakes, angular debris, and tested cobbles (Figure 7). No diagnostic
artifacts were observed.

Figure 7. Example of the kinds of expediently chipped stone artifacts found on the surface across 41HY493.
Eighteen shovel tests were excavated during the transect portion of the survey of this site, only four of
which proved positive for cultural material (Table 2). Additional shovel tests were excavated at the locations
of these four shovel tests and also at a location that appeared to be a lithic concentration. A total of 15
additional shovel tests were excavated, raising the total number of shovel tests at the site to 33 tests. Five of
the additional 15 shovel tests excavated were positive, bringing to total number of positive tests to nine out
of 33 shovel tests. A total of 21 artifacts were encountered from depths between 0 and 40 cmbs, 18 of which
were encountered between 0 and 20, whereas three were encountered between 20 and 40 cmbs. All artifacts
encountered consisted of flakes and angular debris. Terminations of the shovel tests were rather shallow
with a majority of tests only reaching a depth of 40 cmbs and a few reaching 60 cmbs. Shallowness of the
shovel tests were due to the presence of compact clay and in some cases bedrock.

Site 41UV493 is a large prehistoric lithic scatter of undetermined age. The scatter is predominately
located on the surface of the site and consists of cores, unifaces, first- and second-stage bifaces, crudely
modified flakes, broken flakes, angular debris, and tested cobbles. A total of 33 shovel tests were excavated
within the site boundary (which is defined on three sides by the property boundaries of the project area),
and only nine were positive with cultural material. Although cultural materials were encountered within the
two shovel tests, they were located at shallow depths. The shallowness of artifacts and depths of shovel tests
raise questions concerning the contextual integrity of the deposits. As at 41HY492, cracking in the soil from
loss of moisture provided an opportunity for artifacts to move down-profile. It is possible that these artifacts
may have originated on the surface, then fallen into the cracks, and through time migrated downward with
the shrinking and swelling of the soils. Additionally, it is unknown how much time is represented by the
relatively shallow profile. The surface materials appear to lack any discernable patterning or distribution,
and no intact or clearly defined buried components were encountered during this project.
41UV494
Site 41UV494 is a procurement site of undetermined age measuring 388 by 206 m in size (total area of
approximately 56,920 m2). The site is situated on top of the upland knoll located at the center of the APE (see
Figure 6). Several roads cut through the site, and an area at the top of the knoll was completely cleared for
a campground used by hunters who lease the area (Figure 8). Vegetation observed at the site consisted of
prickly pear, lotebush, whitebrush, guayacan, blackbush, and cat-claw underlain by buffalo grass and other
short grasses. Due to the vegetation on the site, visibility was limited to 40 percent. Artifacts observed were
primarily visible within clearings of the vegetation and in the various cleared areas.

Figure 8. Overview of 41HY494.

23

Several transects were conducted through the site area. On those transects artifacts were observed
scattered across the entire surface along the slopes and at the top of the knoll with no indication of specific
activity areas or distinct boundaries. Artifacts present on the surface consisted of raw material, cores,
unifaces, early-stage bifaces, crudely modified flakes, broken flakes, and tested cobbles. The majority of
flakes observed averaged approximately 10 cm in length. No diagnostic artifacts were observed.
In addition to the inspection of the surface, several shovel tests were excavated during the walking
of transects across the knoll (Table 3). Of the several shovel tests excavated during the survey, 12 tests
were located on the top of the knoll within the designated site boundary. Of the 12 shovel tests, only two
were positive for cultural materials, which were encountered between 0 to 20 cmbs. Cultural material
encountered within the shovel tests consisted of flakes and a uniface. An additional three shovel tests were
excavated near one of the positive shovel tests. However soils were very shallow and only one test was
positive, containing a single flake between 0 and 7 cmbs. Soils encountered on the knoll were very shallow
and contained many pieces of large gravel. Depths of shovel tests on the knoll ranged from 3 to 31 cmbs.
Site 41UV494 appears to be a prehistoric lithic procurement site of undetermined age. The site consists
of a scatter located on the top of the knoll’s surface consisting of numerous raw materials, cores, unifaces,
first-stage bifaces, crudely modified flakes, broken flakes, and tested cobbles. A total of 15 shovel tests were
excavated within the site boundary and only three were positive with cultural material. Although cultural
materials were encountered within the shovel tests, they were located at shallow depths due to the gravel/
rocky cap of the knoll. Given that the soils are very shallow and weathered, it appears that the surface
assemblage is in secondary context and no cultural affiliation can be determined.

Chapter 6. Conclusions and Recommendations
Three prehistoric sites were recorded during the intensive pedestrian survey with shovel testing of the
proposed 241-acre La Lomita Development in Uvalde County, Texas. All three are interpreted as lithic
scatters perhaps involving low-level procurement and early-stage reduction. No temporally diagnostic
artifacts were observed at any of the sites, and the majority of cultural debris was limited to the surface.
Some materials were recovered from beneath the surface in a series of shovel tests excavated at each
site, although no discernable buried components were recorded. Soils at all sites are shallow to extremely
shallow, significantly reducing the possibility that intact subsurface components are present. Further
undermining any potential integrity of subsurface remains is the presence of shrink-swell cracks in the
soil, visible at the surface on all three sites and measuring as wide as approximately 1/2 inch. Cultural
materials easily fall into these crevices, where they intermix with materials already present at lower depths.
Considering that so few materials were recovered at all from below the surface (7 from 41UV492, 21 from
41UV493, and 4 from 41UV494), it seems quite likely that virtually all of this material may have originated at
or close to the surface.
Based on the low stratigraphic and temporal integrity of these three sites, CAS concludes that they
provide no real potential to contribute meaningfully to what is known of regional history or prehistory
beyond the simple conclusion that at some unknown point in the past, Native Americans were present in
these areas reducing lithic material into other, unknown forms. These three sites, 41UV492, 41UV493, and
41UV494, are not considered eligible for listing to the National Register of Historic Places and are not
deemed worthy of being designated as SALs.
Based on the results of the survey as described above, CAS recommends that the proposed La Lomita
Economic Development undertaking will have no direct negative or adverse effect on significant or
potentially significant cultural resources in the APE as currently defined. Previous coordination between
Uvalde County and the THC has resulted in the determination that no indirect effect will occur based on
the project’s current design. Therefore CAS recommends that Uvalde County be given complete regulatory
clearance to proceed with their undertaking as planned.
