ABSTRACT
This report documents the substantive findings and management recommendations of a cultural
resources survey conducted by Integrated Environmental Solutions, LLC (IES) for the proposed
McGregor Mega Site Industrial Park project. The McGregor Economic Development Corporation
and the City of McGregor (collectively McGregor) is actively pursuing Mega Site/Super Park site
certifications for a portion of the proposed project area, which is generally located at the northwest
corner of Mother Neff Parkway and South Lone Star Parkway, in the City of McGregor in
southwestern McLennan County, Texas. As the project will require a Section 404 of the Clean
Water Act Nationwide Permit (NWP) from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), portions
of the project will be subjected to the provisions of the National Historic Preservation Act (Section
106) of 1966, as amended. Additionally, as McGregor is a political subdivision of the State of
Texas, the project must also comply with the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT).
Through initial coordination with the Texas Historical Commission (THC), a 851-hectare (2,104acre) Area of Potential Effects (APE) for direct effects was identified and was subsequently
inventoried for cultural resources. In addition, a 100-foot area surrounding three USACE NWP
areas were assessed for potential indirect visual effects to cultural resources.
The goal of this survey was to locate cultural resources that could be adversely affected by the
proposed development, and to provide an evaluation of the eligibility potential of each identified
resource for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or for designation as a
State Antiquities Landmark (SAL). This cultural resources survey was conducted by Principal
Investigator Christopher Goodmaster, Project Archeologists Thomas Chapman and Anne Gibson,
and Field Technician Jason Vandervort between 05 and 16 November 2018. All work conformed
to 13 Texas Administrative Code 26, which outlines the regulations for implementing the ACT,
and was conducted under Antiquities Permit No. 8607.
During the survey, 23 archeological sites were documented within the direct APE. Archeological
sites documented during this survey include 11 previously recorded sites and 12 newly recorded
sites. These archeological sites primarily pertain to the late 19th through mid-20th century
farmsteads; however, two of the sites have minor prehistoric components. As a due diligence and
good faith effort, one historic-age architectural resource was documented outside the direct and
indirect APE for the project. The historic-age architectural resource pertained to a mid-20th
century pumphouse that once served the Bluebonnet Ordnance Plant. Based on the lack of
association with a significant historical event(s) or person(s), lack of remarkable architectural or
structural elements or features, and the low potential to yield significant archeological data, all
resources encountered are recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP under Criteria A, B,
C, or D nor consideration for SAL designation.
No artifacts were collected as part of this survey. All project-related records and field data will be
temporarily stored at the IES McKinney office and permanently curated at the Center for
Archeological Research (CAR) at The University of Texas at San Antonio. No further cultural
resources investigation or evaluation of the APE is recommended. However, if any cultural
resources (other than those documented within this report) are encountered during construction,
the operators should stop construction activities in the vicinity of the inadvertent discovery, and
immediately contact the project cultural resources consultant to initiate coordination with the
USACE and THC prior to resuming construction activities.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
This report presents the results of a cultural resources survey conducted by Integrated Environmental
Solutions, LLC (IES), under contract to Walker Partners, LLC on behalf of the McGregor Economic
Development Corporation and the City of McGregor (collectively McGregor). The purpose of these
investigations was to conduct an inventory of cultural resources (as defined by Code of Federal
Regulations, Title 36, Section 800.4 [36 CFR 800.4]) present within the proposed project area or Area of
Potential Effects (APE) and to evaluate the identified resources for their eligibility for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), as per Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
of 1966 (NHPA Section 106; 36 CFR 800), as amended, or for designation as State Antiquities
Landmarks (SAL) under the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT; Texas Natural Resources Code, Title 9,
Chapter 191 [9 TNRC 191]) and associated state regulations (Texas Administrative Code, Title 13,
Chapter 26 [13 TAC 26]).
The goal of this survey was to locate, identify, and assess archeological sites, buildings, structures, or
other cultural resources within the proposed survey area that may be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or
designation as SALs. This investigation was conducted in accordance with 36 CFR 60.4 and 13 TAC 26,
which outline the regulations for implementing Section 106 of the NHPA and the ACT, respectively.
This report was prepared in accordance with the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA 2002) guidelines,
to satisfy the Section 106 and the ACT requirements of the proposed project. A description of the
proposed project area, pertinent regulations, environmental and historical contexts, field and analytical
methods, results of the investigations, and recommendations regarding the identified cultural resources
are provided in this technical report.

1.1 Regulatory Framework
Antiquities Code of Texas
As the City of McGregor is a political subdivision of the State of Texas, it is required to comply with the
ACT. The ACT was passed in 1969 and requires that THC staff review actions that have the potential to
disturb historic and archeological sites on public land. Actions that require review under the ACT include
any project that includes ground-disturbing activities on land owned or controlled by a political
subdivision of the State and include easements on private property. Each documented cultural resource
was assessed for designation as a SAL under the ACT, as per 13 TAC 26. This survey was conducted
under Antiquities Permit No. 8607.
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
The proposed project will require a Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) Permit from the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Therefore, portions of the project will be subject to the provisions
of the NHPA of 1966, as amended. The NHPA (54 U.S. Code [U.S.C.] 300101 et seq.), specifically
Section 106 of the NHPA (54 U.S.C. 306108) requires the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), an
official appointed in each State or territory, to administer and coordinate historic preservation activities,
and to review and comment on all actions licensed by the federal government that will have an effect on
properties listed in the NRHP, or eligible for such listing. Per 36 CFR 800, the federal agency responsible
for overseeing the action must make a reasonable and good faith effort to identify cultural resources.

1.2 Nature of Undertaking
The APE is generally located at the northwest corner of Mother Neff Parkway (Farm-to-Market Road
[FM] 2671) and South Lone Star Parkway (State Highway [SH] 317), near the City of McGregor in
southwestern McLennan County, Texas. The APE is plotted on recent aerial imagery and the McGregor
7.5-minute U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) topographic quadrangle map (Attachment A, Figures 1 and
2).

Historically, the overall project area was part of the former Bluebonnet Ordnance Plant, which was
established by the U.S. War Department in 1942 and became the Naval Industrial Reserve Ordinance
Plant in 1966. In 1995, when Hercules Incorporated and Alliant Techsystems relocated operations to
West Virginia, the Department of the Navy (Navy) determined that the federal retention of the facility,
which had become known as the Naval Weapons Industrial Reserve Plant (NWIRP) was unnecessary.
The former NWIRP property is now owned by the City of McGregor which plans to develop the property
as an industrial park.
McGregor is actively pursuing Mega Site/Super Park site certifications for the proposed McGregor Mega
Site Industrial Park project. IES has been contracted to assist McGregor in coordinating with the Texas
Historical Commission (THC) to obtain concurrence for the project.

1.3 Area of Potential Effects
Direct APE
Through initial coordination with the THC, a 2,104-acre (ac; 851-hectare [ha]) APE for direct effects was
identified and was subsequently inventoried for cultural resources. Of the overall APE, a 1,020-ac area
with the least number of environmental constraints will be designated for Mega Site certification and
developed into an industrial park. The proposed McGregor Mega Site Industrial Park includes the
construction of a 1 million square foot (ft), box-style building and two associated access roads. The
remaining 1,084 ac of the APE will be developed at the discretion of McGregor when future tenants and
development plans have been formalized.
Potential subsurface impacts anticipated for this project include standard construction procedures
associated with industrial developments such as grading of the ground surface, the installation of storm
drains and utilities, building foundations, and the construction of multi-lane roads. Although the extent of
subsurface impacts was unknown at the time of this report, field investigations assessed to the bottom of
soils capable of containing archeological resources.
Indirect APE
As the proposed project will require a Section 404 of the CWA Nationwide Permit (NWP) from the
USACE for two waters of the United States (WOUS) impact areas, an assessment of the indirect effects
would be required surrounding the three NWP areas for compliance with Section 106 requirements. It is
anticipated that the sole potential indirect effect of the undertaking would be related to visual effects on
historic-age (i.e., greater than 50 years old) architectural resources in the vicinity to the impacted WOUS.
Although design plans were in the preliminary stage during this study, based on discussions with project
engineers, it was assumed that proposed construction of new roadway and widening of existing roadways
surfaces would remain at or near the current ground surface. Subsequently, it was assumed that a 100-ftwide buffer surrounding each WOUS impact area would encompass the maximum distance that adverse
indirect effects could occur.

CHAPTER 2: ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
2.1 Environmental Setting
Climate
McLennan County is located in the central part of the State of Texas. Annual precipitation averages
approximately 33 inches (in). More than half of the precipitation usually falls as rain between April and
September. The subtropical region tends to have a relatively mild year-round temperature with the
occasional exceedingly hot and cold periods (Estaville and Earl 2008).
Paleoenvironmental change within the region is not well documented, but it is summarized by Prikryl and
Jackson (1985) and is discussed by Henry (1995). Prior to 14,000 before present (BP), the climate of
north central Texas was cooler and moister than at present. Between 14,000 and 10,000 BP, the climate
became warmer and this continued to the present, but with brief mesic periods. Researchers suggest that
the presence of high grass pollen and low arboreal pollen between 7,550 to 3,050 BP show a drying with
a return of arboreal pollen after 3,050 BP. The later change is similar to the modern environment. High
grass pollen also occurs at approximately Anno Domini (A.D.) 450 and from A.D. 1550 to 1650, which
also indicates drier periods. The presence of paleosols formed between A.D. 1 and A.D. 1000 suggest an
increase in moisture with a return to drier conditions after A.D. 1000.
Topography, Geology, and Soils
The McGregor 7.5-minute USGS topographic quadrangle map illustrates that the APE is located within a
very broad, gently sloping landform that is dissected by several unnamed tributaries of the South Bosque
River (see Figure 1.2). Three of the five unnamed tributaries dissecting the APE form within the APE,
while the headwaters of the remaining two tributaries form directly west of the APE. Most of the
unnamed tributaries within the APE have been exacerbated by recent erosion, and several are incised into
bedrock. Elevations across the APE range from 662 to 743 ft above mean sea level (amsl).
The APE is located within the Limestone Cut Plain subregion of the Cross Timbers ecoregion. The
Limestone Cut Plain features more level topography than surrounding regions and supports less diverse
vegetation, which includes post oak, white shin oak, cedar elm, Texas ash, plateau live oak, and bur oak.
Native grasses include big and little bluestem, yellow Indiangrass, silver bluestem, and common curly
mesquite. The APE is underlain by the Cretaceous-age Garyson Marl (Kgy) and Main Street Limestone
(Kms) formations (Figure 2.1). These formations are characterized by interbedded marl and sandy
limestone (Barnes et al. 1970; USGS 2018).
The Soil Survey of McLennan County, Texas (Miller and Greenwade 1981) indicates that eight soil map
units are identified within the APE (Figure 2.2; Table 2.1). Approximately 97.7 percent of the APE
contains soils typical of upland settings within the Limestone Cut Plain ecoregion. The remaining 2.3
percent of the APE contains occasionally flooded soils along several of the larger unnamed tributaries of
the South Bosque River. Soil data was reviewed from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Web Soil Survey (USDA 2018).

CHAPTER 3: CULTURAL BACKGROUND
3.1 Previous Investigations
A review of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA 2018) and the Texas Historic Sites Atlas (THSA
2018) online databases, maintained by the THC and the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL), identified no National Register properties, historical markers, or cemeteries located within the
APE. The TASA records review also identified four previously conducted archeological surveys located
within the APE and within 1 mile (mi) of the APE (Table 3.1; Figure 3.1). As a result of these previous
surveys, 11 archeological sites have been previously identified within the APE (Table 3.2) and four
additional archeological sites have been previously identified within 1 mi of the APE (Table 3.3).

In 1983, Espey, Huston, and Associates, Inc. conducted a linear survey on behalf of the Rural
Electrification Administration (REA) for the overhead electric transmission line corridor that extends
between the towns of Whitney and Moody (Vanderleest 1983). A portion of the survey corridor bisects
the APE (see Figure 3.1) and site 41ML113 was recorded within the northern portion of the APE during
that survey (see Table 3.2).
In 1995, Prewitt and Associates, Inc. conducted an archeological reconnaissance survey for the Navy over
portions of the NWIRP property (Stork and Fields 1996). The survey was conducted in an effort to assist
the Navy in meeting its responsibilities under Section 106 and Section 110 of the NHPA prior to the
divestment of the property by the federal government, and to assist the City of McGregor in compliance
with the ACT, once the property transfer was complete. The survey was conducted with two primary
objectives. The first objective was to determine if archeological sites were present within the NWIRP
property. The second objective was to determine if parts of the NWIRP facility could be excluded from
more intensive survey efforts due to ground disturbances resulting from post-1942 military development
(Stork and Fields 1996:4). Although TASA records indicate the survey encompassed the entire NWIRP
property, survey efforts only took place within selected portions of the former NWIRP. Previous survey
efforts were restricted to areas considered to have the highest potential for containing prehistoric sites,
limited pedestrian survey of other parts of the facility, and reconnaissance of selected historic period site
locations based on information provided by installation employees (Stork and Fields 1996:7). The survey
consisted of pedestrian transects, conducted in intervals ranging from 15 to 50 meters (m). Shovel tests
were not conducted during the survey and site maps were not prepared of the encountered resources;
however, temporally diagnostic artifacts were collected (Stork and Fields 1996:9)
During the 1995 survey, 28 archeological sites were recorded within the overall NWIRP property,
including 1 prehistoric site, 24 historic-period sites, and 3 multi-component sites. Of the 28 sites recorded
during the 1995 NWIRP survey, 10 sites (41ML239 through 41ML244, 41ML251, 41ML252, 41ML258,
and 41ML259) are located within the APE (see Table 3.2). All of the previously recorded sites within
the APE featured historic period components pertaining to homesteads and farmsteads that were
represented by surface artifact scatters, structure foundations, and wells. Two of the previously recorded
sites (41ML243 and 41ML244) also included relatively minor prehistoric components that were evident
through the presence of chipped lithic tools and debitage. None of the sites identified during the 1995
NWIRP survey were delineated at the time of their initial documentation and none have been officially
reviewed for SAL- or NRHP-eligibility by the THC.
Because the survey did not include the entire NWIRP property and the identified resources were not
evaluated for NRHP eligibility, the THC requested that the Navy and the City of McGregor agree to
transfer the property with protective covenants that included adequate conditions to ensure the
preservation of significant historic resources (Appendix D). As such, the City of McGregor is required to
comply with the ACT on a case-by-case basis for any development plans within the former NWIRP
property.
Although not archeological in nature, an architectural survey of the NWIRP facility was conducted in
1995 by Hardy-Heck-Moore and Associates, Inc. Through the survey, 191 architectural resources within
NWIRP were documented. Assessments for architectural integrity and historic or architectural
significance resulted in a finding of four resources that are considered eligible for the NRHP. Sixty-four
additional resources were considered eligible for NRHP as a district. None of the 191 architectural
resources documented during the 1995 survey are located within the APE (Malanka et al. 1995).

3.2 Regional Cultural Chronology
Prehistoric Period
The prehistory of the McLennan County region can be traced to as early as 10,000 to 11,000 BP and since
that time, it appears to have been continuously occupied. Prehistoric Native American settlement in the
central Texas area began at least 10,000 years ago as demonstrated by the presence of distinctivelyshaped dart points recovered from the Baylor site (Story and Shafer 1965) and from Horn Shelter No. 2
(Forrester 1985 and Redder 1985). Artifact collectors report the presence of Clovis, Folsom, Scottsbluff
and other Paleoindian points from the surface of sites in the region (Meltzer and Bever 1995). The
presence of exotic (i.e., non-local) lithic resources indicates that these early people either traveled within a
territory where higher quality lithic resources were available or were involved in a system of raw material
exchange. Evidence shows that these early people hunted now extinct large game (Lynott 1979), but
probably also small game and edible plants.
The subsequent period, the Archaic, lasted from 8,500 to 1,250 BP. The Archaic peoples lived
throughout the region, but particularly along the major and minor stream valleys where they were able to
hunt and forage for native foods. Dart points, grinding stones, fire-cracked rock, and scrapers are
commonly found on Archaic sites. The earliest Archaic peoples continued making tools using exotic
cherts for dart points, but as time passed, there was a shift toward the use of local stone resources for
chipped stone tools. These local materials are described as Uvalde gravels (Byrd 1971). Smaller lithic
scatters have been recorded in upland areas throughout the county. These sites appear to be Archaic in
age, but none has been thoroughly studied.
Between A.D. 700 and 800, a major change in the artifact assemblages and settlement patterns of regional
prehistoric sites can be identified. This is attributed to the drying of smaller tributaries. During this
period, which is known as the Late Prehistoric, Caddoan pottery from East Texas appears as trade
material along with possibly indigenous pottery. It has been suggested that farming was practiced.
Arrowheads appear about this same time indicating that the bow and arrow had been added to the hunting
tool kit.
At the end of the Late Prehistoric period, there appears to have been an abandonment of the Central
Brazos River valley based on a general absence of sites with trade goods that might have been obtained
from French, Spanish, or English traders (Skinner 1988). This simplistic interpretation is tied to a
continuation of the general drying trend. Despite information generated by professional and avocational
archaeologists, there is very little evidence of historic era Native American occupation anywhere in the
county (Watt 1969; Story 1985), although historic accounts indicate that groups were present in the early
19th century.
Historic Period
The first written encounter between Native American tribes and Europeans was documented by Spanish
settlers in 1772 when they encountered a band of the Wichita tribe known as the Hueco, or Waco, near
present day Waco, Texas. During the early 19th century, settlers of European descent began to arrive in
the area, leading to tension and hostility between both groups until a peace treaty in 1824. By 1830, the
old Waco Village ceased to exist as the inhabitants had either been driven out by a band of Cherokee or
fell victim to a smallpox epidemic (Conger 2018; Sawyer 2018). The remaining members of the Wacos
in the county were eventually forced out and, through a series of treaties, relocated with the Wichita Tribe
to a reservation in Oklahoma. In 1825, the area of McLennan County was part of the colonization grant
obtained from the Mexican government and later part of Robertson’s Colony. After the desertion of
Waco Village and treaties with the Waco and Wichita groups, settlers began to move into the area. Fort
Fisher, established in 1837, became the first Anglo-American settlement. In the 1840s, a land grant
including the original old Waco Village was sold, divided into blocks and lots, and sold at dollars apiece,
leading to the creation of Waco Village, which was later incorporated as the Town of Waco. McLennan

County, named after Neil McLennan, was established in 1850 with Waco selected as the county seat.
Much of the county’s early economy was based on agriculture, especially cotton. The local economy
declined during the Civil War as draining of man power for the Confederate army left few workers in the
area (Conger 2010; Smryl 2018).
The economy began to boom again in the county after 1870. Production of cotton, wheat, and corn, as
well as the raising of cattle, hogs, and sheep, fueled much of the regional economy. In 1870, the Waco
Bridge Company opened the Waco Suspension Bridge spanning the Brazos River. The bridge not only
connected Waco and East Waco, but also provided a safe, direct route to travel across the river. In 1871,
the Waco and Northwestern Railroad was built, making McLennan County a significant point for settlers
heading farther west and a center for shipping in the area (Conger 2018). As a result of increased traffic
through the county, saloons, gaming houses, and a legal red-light district were opened, attracting
cattlemen from the Chisolm Trail, drifters, and others to Waco (Conger 2018). In the 1880s, the St. Louis
and Southwestern Railroad and the Missouri, Kansas, and Texas Railroad were built in the region,
making Waco a significant transportation center between regional farms, factories, and consumers
throughout the nation (Smyrl 2018). The opening of Camp MacArthur and Rich Field during World War
I significantly increased the population of McLennan County. Although agriculture continued to
dominate, industry began to grow within the county. Several large manufacturers moved into the county
including the Barton Dyanshine factory, the Borden Company, and the Atlas Portland Cement Company.
The county’s growth slowed during the Great Depression and a severe drought decimated crops (Smyrl
2018).
Construction of the Bluebonnet Ordnance Plant was authorized by Congress in February 1942, just 3
months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the subsequent official declaration of war by the
United States against the Axis powers (Kane 1995; Malanka et al. 1995:31). Owned by the federal
government, but built and operated by a joint venture of private contractors, the facility was one of 77
government-owned, contractor-operated ordnance plants across the United States producing material for
military applications during World War II (Kane 1995). Construction of the Bluebonnet Ordnance Plant
began on 24 April 1942, and the plant was producing ammunition just 2 months later (Malanka et al.
1995:31).
The nearly 20,000 acres of formerly agricultural property acquired for the Bluebonnet Ordnance Plant
was home to 136 families, many of whom were removed through condemnation proceedings within in a
matter of weeks (Malanka et al. 1995:39–40). The former agricultural land on which the plant was
constructed was described later in romanticized prose as “dotted with white houses and red barns and
flanked by orchards and shade trees. Livestock tred (sic) the cattle trails and the peaceful chirp of tree
frogs and birds chorused the gentle wailing of the cattle” (McGregor Mirror, 04 July 1976). Upon
acquisition, the U.S. government promptly removed all standing houses, equipment, outbuildings, and
more than 254 mi of fence line from the property.

3.3 Cultural Resources Potential
In addition to TASA and THSA online database reviews, several additional resources were referenced to
determine the overall potential for encountering cultural resources within the APE. These resources
included soil survey data (NRCS 2018; Miller and Greenwade 1981), geologic data (Barnes et al. 1970),
the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Potential Archeological Liability Map (PALM) for the
Waco District, the National Archives and Records Administration’s (NARA) 1940 Census Enumeration
District Maps for McLennan County, the Texas Historic Overlay (THO) georeferenced maps, historical
and modern aerial photography, and satellite imagery. The following discussion summarizes expectations
for location, type, and integrity of archeological resources within the APE.

Disturbance Analysis
The APE was primarily used for agricultural and ranching purposes since the late 19th and early 20th
centuries, prior to its development as the Bluebonnet Ordnance Plant and later the NWIRP. During the
background review, it was determined that approximately 10 percent of the APE had been exposed to
significant ground disturbances during the 20th century. Despite construction and operation of the
Bluebonnet Ordnance Plant nearby, the APE remained largely undeveloped, with the exception of the
south-central portion of the APE which was used for the storage of industrial materials during the
operation of the ordnance facility. The majority of artificial ground disturbances are related to the
construction and subsequent partial dismantling of the railway that crossed the northern portion of the
APE. This railway consisted of multiple parallel rail lines and spurs with associated structure and
roadways that served the ordnance facility. Initial construction of the railway occurred between 1942 and
1955. Fill is visible at several locations surrounding the railway and roadways. Additional construction
occurring during this period include several buried utility lines that generally follow the course of the
railway. Several ponds were located within the APE as early as 1955. Some ponds have since been filled
and additional ponds have been more recently constructed. Widespread surface erosion is prevalent
across the APE and potentially deeper erosion along the banks of the unnamed tributaries is evident on
aerial imagery since 1942. Localized fill is visible on modern aerial photography within smaller portions
of the APE. Additionally, environmental monitoring wells and subsurface environmental remediation
structures were installed within the south-central and southeastern portions of the APE in the early 2000s
for remediation of groundwater contamination resulting from the storage of industrial materials during the
operation of the ordnance facility.
Direct APE
Prehistoric Archeological Resources Potential
The TxDOT PALM for the Waco District indicates that approximately 85 percent of the APE features a
low to negligible potential for encountering shallow or deeply-buried prehistoric archeological sites
within a reasonable context (Table 3.4). Limited portions of the APE (approximately 16 percent of the
overall acreage) contain a moderate to high potential for containing either shallow or deeply-buried
archeological deposits. These moderate and high potential portions of the APE are situated along the
unnamed tributaries of the South Bosque River. Through background review, it was determined that the
majority of previous surface and subsurface disturbances have occurred primarily within low potential
areas for containing prehistoric archeological resources. As such, the moderate and high potential areas
appear to have avoided significant ground disturbances and have retained a reasonable context. In
addition, two previously recorded sites with prehistoric components (41ML243 and 41ML244) are
located within one of these areas of elevated archeological potential.

Previous archeological surveys across Central Texas have identified numerous archeological resources
that reflect Native American habitation throughout the Holocene. As a whole, the Central Texas
archeological region is characterized by the potential for encountering a high frequency of prehistoric
sites with large artifact assemblages and numerous well-preserved features. However, the APE is located
within upland landforms with limited permanent sources of surface water and a lack of natural chert
outcrops that would have been exploited during the prehistoric period for the manufacture of chipped

lithic tools. As such, limited portions of the APE are likely to contain prehistoric archeological resources;
however, the potential prehistoric archeological site density within the APE is likely to be low relative to
much of the overall Central Texas region. In addition, historic settlement and land use is likely to have
impacted the contextual integrity of prehistoric sites, as evidenced by the historic components noted at
both previously recorded prehistoric sites within the APE.
Historic Period Resources Potential
Previously documented historic-age resources within the Central Texas region generally consist of
archeological sites pertaining to late 19th to mid-20th century farmsteads, cemeteries, and structures such
as culverts, bridges, houses, barns, and outbuildings. Typically, archeological sites associated with
historic-period occupations in the region comprise surface or near-surface artifact assemblages and
dilapidated, collapsed, or demolished structures. As such, these resources usually do not retain sufficient
integrity of design or association to be considered eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or designation as a
SAL. Based on THC records, there are 11 previously recorded archeological sites within the APE that
contain historic-period components (see Table 3.2).
Unfortunately, the earliest available maps that depict the APE are not of sufficient scale and detail to
include the locations of structures. All editions (1892, 1896, 1906, 1917, and 1921) of the Temple 30minute (1:125,000-scale) USGS topographic map and the 1924 McLennan County geologic map do not
contain individual structure locations. The 1929, 1931, and 1949 editions of the McGregor 15-minute
(1:62,500-scale) USGS topographic map include only the southwest quarter of the map and reference the
earlier editions for the portion that includes the APE. Although determining the presence of pre-mid-20th
century buildings and structures is problematic, maps and aerial photographs depicting these features are
available post-1941.
The 1936 McLennan County Highway Map, the NARA 1940 Census Enumeration District maps for
McLennan County, and 1941 aerial photographs depict approximately 13 farmsteads adjacent to
roadways along FM 2671 (Mother Neff Parkway) and Judith Drive within or near the APE. Historicperiod aerial photographs depict the approximate locations of these farmsteads to be devoid of structures
since 1952, following the demolition of the residential and agricultural structures within the Bluebonnet
Ordnance Plant. The presence of this former dispersed agricultural community suggests a high
probability for encountering historic-period resources within the APE. Historic-period maps and aerial
photographs also depict a railroad crossing the northern portion of the APE, components of which are
visible in current modern aerial photography. As such, there is a high potential for encountering historicperiod cultural resources within the APE.
Indirect APE Resource Potential
The western two of the three USACE NWP areas are located at the western edge of the APE along two
unnamed tributaries within a pasture setting. Impacts to WOUS at these non-reporting NWP areas will be
related to the construction of a new access road for the proposed industrial park. Through background
research it was determined that there were no previously recorded archeological sites or above ground
historic-age resources within the indirect APE of the western USACE NWP areas. Subsequently, it was
determined that there was a low potential for indirect effects to cultural resources near that location.

Page 17

The eastern USACE NWP impact area is located at the crossing of an unnamed tributary and Judith
Drive. Impacts to WOUS at this non-reporting NWP area will be related to the widening and improving
of Judith Drive. Although Judith Drive is a historic-age road dating to the late 19th century, the road has
been improved during the 20th century. More recent improvements are illustrated at the crossing of the
unnamed tributary by Judith Drive, which contains three pre-cast concrete culverts that transfer water
beneath a caliche road. Pre-cast concrete culverts were used at several tributary crossings along Judith
Drive. Through background research it was determined that there were no previously recorded
archeological sites or above ground historic-age resources within the indirect APE of the easternmost
USACE NWP area. Subsequently, it was determined that there was a low potential for indirect effects to
cultural resources at this location.

CHAPTER 4: METHODS
The methods utilized during this survey satisfy the archeological survey standards for field investigations
recommended by the CTA (CTA 1996, 2001), as approved by the THC. Components of the survey
included archival and background research, pedestrian reconnaissance survey, intensive survey,
archeological site recording, and NRHP/SAL evaluation of each documented resource. Prior to
fieldwork, the IES staff conducted historical and archeological records reviews to determine the locations
of previously recorded resources within the APE and within a 1-mi (1.6-kilometer [km]) radius of the
direct APE (see Section 3.1). IES staff also reviewed ecological, geologic, and soils data, historical and
modern topographic maps, and aerial photographs of the APE. Due to the variability in prehistoric and
historic-period settlement patterns, land use, and archeological site preservation within the APE, multiple
survey and sampling methods were used during this investigation, including the use of systematic shovel
testing to locate and define archeological sites.

4.1 Survey Methods
Pedestrian Survey
The pedestrian reconnaissance survey consisted of visual examination of the ground surface and existing
subsurface exposures for evidence of archeological sites. The pedestrian survey consisted of a multiple
transect scheme, which was implemented across the APE. Transects were spaced in 100-m intervals
orientated in a general east-to-west direction. In portions of the APE within and surrounding the locations
of previously recorded archeological sites, or high probability areas (HPA) for occurrence of
archeological sites, pedestrian survey transect intervals were reduced to 30-m intervals.
Intensive Survey
Shovel tests were excavated in 110-m intervals along the pedestrian survey transects across the entire
APE, resulting in approximately 1 shovel test per 3 ac of APE. Shovel tests were at least 30 centimeters
(cm) in diameter and hand-excavated in arbitrary levels not exceeding 20 cm in thickness. Shovel tests
were excavated the extent of soils capable of containing cultural artifacts (typically the argillic [Bt or Bss]
subsoil horizon) or regolith. Excavated soil was screened using ¼-in hardware cloth to facilitate the
recovery of buried cultural material. If clay content was high and could not be efficiently screened, the
excavated soil was troweled through by hand and inspected for artifacts. Investigators documented the
physical properties of each natural stratigraphic soil level and the results of each shovel test on
standardized forms. In addition, all shovel test locations were recorded using hand-held Global
Positioning System (GPS) units.
Standards for archeological methods typically require that measurements be recorded in metric units. For
this reason, while general distances and engineering specifications are recorded and described in imperial
units (e.g., in, ft, mi) within this report, archeological measurements and observations are listed in metric
units (e.g., cm, m, km), unless historic-period artifact or architectural elements are more appropriately
recorded in imperial units.
Archeological Site Documentation
Archeological sites were documented through pedestrian survey in 5-m intervals and the excavation of at
least six shovel tests excavated in 15-m intervals to assess the horizontal and vertical extent of
archeological deposits and characterize the artifact content within each site. The distribution of surface
artifacts/features, distinct topographic features, negative shovel test excavations, and the extent of the
APE were used to delimit the boundary of each site. For the purposes of this survey, an archeological site
was defined as five or more surface artifacts within a 10-m radius, a cultural feature observed on the
surface or exposed within a shovel test, a positive shovel test containing two or more subsurface artifacts,
or two or more positive shovel tests located within 30 m of each other. All newly documented sites were
assigned a temporary field number and recorded on State of Texas archeological site forms,

photographed, mapped, and plotted on a USGS topographic quadrangle. Site forms were submitted to
TARL for assignment of formal trinomial designations.

4.2 Archival Research
Prior to field investigations, a suite of archival sources including historical maps and aerial photographs
was reviewed to determine former land use patterns and the locations of historic-age (e.g., greater than 50
years old) structures within the direct and indirect APE. Deed and chain-of-title research was conducted
at the McLennan County Clerk’s Office (MCCO) for all historic-period resources encountered to
determine associations with historically significant individuals or historical events for evaluation of these
resources under Criteria A and B of the NRHP (see below).

4.3 Resource Evaluation
Each identified resource was plotted on the appropriate 7.5-minute USGS topographic map and a scaled
site map was prepared for each site. Field data were processed to evaluate site significance and potential
eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP and designation as a SAL. When applicable, a variety of data were
used to assess site significance including temporal period, artifact density, artifact variety, feature density,
feature variety, feature preservation, stratigraphic integrity, and the amount of previous disturbance.
NRHP Evaluation Criteria
The assessment of significance of a cultural resource is based on federal guidelines and regulations. The
criteria for evaluating resources for inclusion in the NRHP are codified under the authority of the NHPA
of 1966, as amended (36 CFR 60.4 [a–d]), and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation has set
forth guidelines to use in determining site eligibility. Federal regulations indicate that “[t]he term
‘eligible for inclusion in the National Register’ includes both properties formally determined as such by
the Secretary of the Interior and all other properties that meet National Register listing criteria” (36 CFR
800.2[e]). Based on Advisory Council guidelines, any cultural resource that is included in or eligible for
inclusion in the National Register is a historic property.
Subsequent to the identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions, four criteria
for eligibility are applied. The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology,
engineering, and culture is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess
integrity of location, design, setting, material, workmanship, feeling, and association and:
Criterion A:
Criterion B:
Criterion C:

Criterion D:

that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history; or
that are association with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic
values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components
may lack individual distinction; or
that have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or
history. [36 CFR 60.4(a–d)]

The principal objective is to determine whether a cultural resource possesses the potential to contribute to
one or more of the above-defined criteria. Adequate information regarding site function, context, and
chronological placement from both archeological and, if appropriate, historical perspectives is essential
for cultural resources investigations. Because research questions vary as a result of geography, temporal
period, and project design, determination of site context and chronological placement of cultural
resources is a particularly important objective during the inventory and evaluation processes. Criterion D
is generally associated with prehistoric, but also historic-age, archeological sites. Criteria A, B, and C
typically reflect association with historic-age resources, rarely with prehistoric sites. The objective of the
current project was to locate and define both the horizontal and vertical extents of any cultural resources,

document and describe those resources, and then, when adequate data were present, evaluate each for
NRHP eligibility.
State Antiquities Landmark Evaluation Criteria
For purposes of implementing the ACT, the THC is the statutorily created body responsible for protecting
and preserving SALs under the 9 TNRC 191. A SAL is an archeological site, archeological collection,
ruin, building, structure, cultural landscape, site, engineering feature, monument or other object, or district
that is eligible to be designated as a landmark or is already officially designated as a landmark. Some
archeological sites may not possess research value sufficient to warrant long-term preservation or
investigations beyond survey level documentation, and some historic buildings and structures retain
minimal integrity due to damage or deterioration. Therefore, the issue of whether cultural resources are
significant and warrant preservation, and/or further research (such as archeological testing and data
recovery level investigations), is addressed through official landmark designation, permit issuance, and
rules associated with enforcement of the ACT. TNRC Sections 191.091 and 191.092 indicate that
archeological sites and historic buildings and structures on lands belonging to state agencies or political
subdivisions of the state of Texas are landmarks or may be eligible to be designated as landmarks. Also
protected under the TNRC (Section 191.094) are specially designated landmarks on private property.
Under the ACT at the state level, archeological sites may be considered significant and be recognized or
designated as a SAL. The THC uses one or more of the following criteria when assessing the
appropriateness of official landmark designation, and/or the need for further investigations under the
permit process:
Criterion 1:

the site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory and/or
history of Texas by the addition of new and important information;

Criterion 2:

the site’s archeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and intact,
thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;

Criterion 3:

the site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or history;

Criterion 4:

the study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of preservation,
thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge;

Criterion 5:

there is a high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur, and
official landmark designation is needed to ensure maximum legal protection, or alternatively,
further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and relic collecting
when the site cannot be protected [13 TAC 26.10].

Buildings, structures, cultural landscapes, and non-archeological sites, objects, and districts may be
designated as landmarks provided that the following conditions are met:
Condition 1: the property fits within at least one of the following criteria:
(a) the property is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history, including importance to a particular cultural or ethnic group;
(b) the property is associated with the lives of persons significant in our past;
(c) the property embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, represents the work of a master, possesses high artistic value, or represents a
significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinctions
(d) the property has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in Texas
culture or history;
Condition 2: the property retains integrity at the time of the nomination, as determined by the executive
director of the commission; and

McGregor Mega Site Industrial Park
Cultural Resources Survey Report

IES Project No. 04.142.019
Page 21

Condition 3: for buildings and structures only, the property must be listed in the National Register of
Historic Places, either individually, or as a contributing property within a historic district as
determined by the Keeper of the National Register or the executive director of the
commission [13 TAC 26.19].

4.4 Curation
This survey employed a non-collection, in-field analysis strategy. Artifacts observed on the ground
surface and recovered within excavations were identified, inventoried, and tabulated in the field.
Representative and temporally or functionally diagnostic artifacts were photographed. Artifacts were
then returned to the provenience from which they were observed. Project-related records, field notes,
photographs, forms, and other documentation will be curated. All project records will be temporarily
stored at the IES office and will be permanently curated at the CAR at The University of Texas at San
Antonio.

CHAPTER 5: RESULTS
During this survey, the direct APE was subjected to reconnaissance survey transects and a systematic
intensive survey. Pedestrian reconnaissance survey was conducted across the entire APE to determine the
extent of prior ground disturbances and assess the likelihood of encountering cultural resources. Ground
surface visibility was highly variable and irregular across the APE, ranging from 0 to 100 percent.
Intensive survey with systematic shovel test sampling was also conducted across the entire APE during
this survey. As a result, 23 archeological sites were documented within the direct APE. Archeological
site locations are described within this chapter and within Appendix C. No cultural resources were
encountered within the indirect APE at either of the two non-reporting NWP areas. As a due diligence
and good faith effort, one historic-age architectural resource was documented outside the direct and
indirect APE for the project.

5.1 Archeological Survey
Pedestrian Reconnaissance Survey General Observations
The APE was located within a very broad, gently undulating landform dissected by five unnamed
tributaries of the South Bosque River. The APE was predominately located within a pastureland setting
that was largely comprised of open grass fields, which were dissected by small drainages and roads
(Appendix A, Photographs 01 through 12). Tree growth was sparse and sporadic across the APE, with
trees and small groves of trees typically located only along fence lines, roads, several of the unnamed
tributaries, and at historic-period archeological sites (Appendix A, Photographs 13 through 15). Ground
surface visibility ranged from 0 to 100 percent with visibility of 20 to 60 percent across most of the APE
(Appendix A, Photographs 16 through 18). Variation in ground surface visibility was the result of short
grass cover, past land use, and erosion resulting from livestock trampling and overgrazing.
As detailed within Chapter 3, a variety of past ground disturbances have transpired within the APE during
the historic and modern periods. IES investigators observed widespread erosion, overhead electric
transmission lines, subsurface pipelines, groundwater monitoring wells, recently sown pasture grass, and
disturbances associated with cattle ranching (Appendix A, Photographs 19 through 26). In addition, the
remnants of a railroad and its associated infrastructure, which included earthen berms, culverts, gravel fill,
and railroad ties, were encountered in the northern part of the APE (Appendix A, Photographs 27
through 31). Observations at isolated cutbanks within small drainages, excavated stock ponds, and other
exposed areas revealed soil stratigraphy commonly comprised of an approximate 30 to 40 cm thick
gravelly clay loam overlaying either a gravelly clay horizon, regolith, or bedrock (Appendix A,
Photographs 32 and 33). On the summit and upper slopes of knolls and ridge spurs, the stratigraphy
contained an upper layer of deflated gravelly clay loam to a depth of 5 to 10 cm before encountering a
layer of dense gravel or limestone regolith (Appendix A, Photographs 34 and 35).
Intensive Survey Results
To augment the pedestrian survey shovel tests were excavated in 110-m intervals along the pedestrian
survey transects spaced in 100-m intervals across the APE. During the intensive survey, 854 shovel tests
were excavated within the APE (Figures 5.1 through 5.4). Soils exposed in shovel tests generally
consisted of very dark brown to dark grayish brown (10YR 2/2, 3/1, and 3/2) clay loam to a depth of 30 to
40 cm below surface (cmbs). Within the lower elevations of the APE, particularly near the southern APE
boundary, soils were composed of very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay loam that extended approximately 35
to 40 cmbs before encountering a very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay argillic horizon. In parts of
the northern half of the APE, soils encountered on ridges and hills were characterized by very dark brown
to brown (7.5YR 2.5/2, 3/2, and 4/4) gravelly clay loam extending approximately 10 cmbs to regolith.
Due to torrential rains that occurred prior to and during the pedestrian survey, several poorly-drained
portions of the APE were inundated (Appendix A, Photographs 36 and 37). As a result, archeologists
were unable to investigate the surface or excavate shovel tests in those areas.

5.2 Encountered Cultural Resources
Site 41ML113
Previous Investigations
Site 41ML113 was originally recorded in 1983 by Espey, Huston and Associates, Inc. during the cultural
resources survey for an overhead electric transmission line extending between the towns of Whitney and
Moody (Vanderleest 1983). At the time of its initial documentation, the site was described as containing
historic-age foundations with concrete stairs, a well, a brick scatter, and very little domestic refuse
encompassing an area of approximately 1.9 ac (TASA 2018a). No shovel tests or other subsurface
investigations were performed at that time. The site was not revisited during the 1995 Prewitt and
Associates, Inc. archeological reconnaissance survey of the NWIRP. A site, labelled 41ML260, is
indicated at this location on the survey report map (Stork and Fields 1996:8); however, no discussion of
site 41ML260 is presented within the report. In addition, site 41ML260 was recorded later by TxDOT
archeologists during the expansion of SH 6 north of the town of Reisel. It is likely that the site was
temporarily designated 41ML260 during fieldwork for the 1995 reconnaissance survey before the
investigators recognized that the site had been previously recorded as 41ML113.
Current Investigations
During the IES survey, archeologists revisited 41ML113 to reassess the current condition of the site and
to assess the potential for further testing and eligibility. The site was encountered near the summit of an
interfluvial upland landform between an unnamed tributary of Harris Creek and an unnamed tributary of
the South Bosque River. Judith Drive extends generally northwest to southeast approximately 38 m west
of the site, while an overhead electric transmission line and a buried natural gas pipeline were located
within the western half of the site (Figure 5.5; Appendix A.2, Photographs 1 and 2). TASA records
illustrate the site centroid located approximately 100 ft west of the IES site delineation. Site 41ML113
was documented within an area extending approximately 56 m north-to-south by 67 m east-to-west,
encompassing approximately 0.23 ha (0.58 ac). The site was delineated based on the distribution of
archeological features, surface artifacts, negative shovel tests, and observed disturbances. The site is
entirely within the APE.
Ground surface visibility during the survey was approximately 20 percent within and surrounding the site
with large, sporadic areas producing ground visibility of 50 percent or higher. Vegetation at the site
included short grasses, cacti, small woody shrubs, and patches of buffalo gourd. Investigators observed
sparse surface artifact scatters containing machine-made brick fragments, concrete chunks, a concrete
mold that once housed a galvanized steel fence post, and two steel angle brackets embedded in the ground
surface (Appendix A.2, Photographs 3 through 12). One brick fragment contained a partial stamp of the
Whiteselle Brick and Lumber Company that produced “Whiteselle Cherry Reds Corsicana” bricks
between 1902 and 1981 (Steinbomer 1982; Appendix A.2, Photographs 13 and 14).
During the delineation of 41ML113, IES investigators excavated 17 shovel tests. The soil profile exposed
during shovel testing was generally uniform and consisted of an upper stratum of dark yellowish brown
(10YR 4/4) clay loam to a depth of approximately 10 to 35 cmbs with 50 percent gravel inclusions
overlying regolith. Shovel Tests OT9 and OT10 were excavated southwest of the buried natural gas
pipeline easement. Soils in this area were extensively disturbed due to the construction of the utility
corridor. No artifacts were encountered within shovel tests.

Features
Feature 1 was a concrete slab foundation measuring 6 m by 5.5 m (Appendix A.2, Photographs 15 and
17). Based on a review of historic aerial imagery, the dwelling footprint extended to the east
approximately 3.5 m and to the north approximately 2 m. The majority of the concrete slab was intact but
exhibited cracking and minimal erosion.
Feature 2 was a series of raised concrete foundations measuring approximately 11 m by 10 m (Appendix
A.2, Photographs 18 through 26). This feature was located approximately 46 m east of Feature 1 and
likely pertained to a small barn or a large shed/storage structure. The foundations were approximately 20
cm wide and raised approximately 20 cm from the ground surface. Anchor bolts were protruding from
the foundation surface. Past demolition of the superstructure, or other disturbances, resulted in the
removal of several sections of the foundation.
Feature 3 was a raised concrete foundation measuring approximately 5.2 m by 3.6 m (Appendix A.2,
Photographs 27 through 28). This foundation was located approximately 30 m east of Feature 1 and was
a small shed. Anchor bolts were extruding from the foundation surface. A 1 m by 1 m concrete chunk
was located at the southwest corner of the feature. Directly north of the foundation, a rectangular
formation of foundation fragments was observed (Appendix A.2, Photograph 30). Based on the
placement and setting, it was determined that these foundation fragments were in a secondary context.
Feature 4 was a raised concrete foundation measuring approximately 6 m in a northwest-to-southeast
orientation (Appendix A.2, Photographs 31 and 33). The remaining portions of the foundation were
missing. This feature pertained the northeastern wall of a barn or shed.
Archival Research
Site 41ML113 is not depicted on the 1936 Texas State Highway Department map of McLennan County.
The site is visible on 1955 and 1964 aerial photographs as a series of possible foundation remnants. The
site is located within the 1,652-ac B. C. Walters Survey, Abstract 892, patented on 07 April 1853. Using
public records provided by the MCCO, a chain-of-title for the property was produced to determine
potential NRHP eligibility under Criterion A and/or B (Appendix B, Table 4). Based on deed records
and site observations, 41ML113 most likely pertains to the property ownership of the Johnson, Hany, and
Judd families in the early 20th century.
A search of the Handbook of Texas Online revealed several prominent Texans were associated with the
property. Prior to 1853, the entire B. C. Walters survey was owned by Jacob De Cordova, a Texas land
agent who was known for acquiring large amounts of land and dividing the land into smaller farm tracts
(Ornish 2018). In 1882, the property was purchased by Walter Gresham and John Sealy. Walter
Gresham was a lawyer and legislator who served as a director, attorney, and vice president for the Gulf,
Colorado and Santa Fe Railway (Hooker 2018). John Sealy and his brother had bought the Gulf,
Colorado and Santa Fe Railway in 1879 and served as a general manager beginning in 1882 (Hazlewood
2018). Although these three men owned the property, none of them were known to have resided in
McLennan County. As such, 41ML113 was not directly associated with those individuals.
The property, and most of the western half of the B. C. Walters survey, was also owned by local farmer
William Amthor. According to A Memorial and Biographical History of McLennan, Fall, Bell, and
Coryell Counties, Texas (Lewis Publishing Company 1893), William Amthor was the son of German
immigrants and moved from Austin County, Texas to McGregor in 1884. William Amthor farmed, raised
livestock, traded, and butchered on his “fine farm of 850 acres, of which 300 acres are improved, and has
three large store buildings in McGregor” (Lewis Publishing Company 1893:763). Although William
Amthor was a prominent local citizen of McGregor, there is little evidence to directly associate him with
site 41ML113 or any other archeological site within the B. C. Walters survey.

Site Summary
Site 41ML113 represents a historic-period farmstead occupied during the early 20th century by the
Johnson, Hany, and Judd families. The site is located in an area approximately 55 m north-to-south by 67
m east-to-west, encompassing approximately 0.23 ha (0.58 ac) within the APE. Seventeen shovel tests
were excavated within or in proximity to the site during intensive survey and site delineation, none of
which yielded cultural materials. Four archeological features and a sparse surface scatter of brick
fragments and concrete chunks (n<50) were observed. The site is entirely within the APE.
Site 41ML239
Previous Investigations
Site 41ML239 was originally recorded in 1995 by Prewitt and Associates, Inc. during the archeological
reconnaissance survey of the NWIRP and prior to transfer of the property from the Navy to the City of
McGregor (Stork and Fields 1996:12–13). At the time of its initial documentation, the site was described
as a historic-period homestead with concrete foundation remnants, a brick-lined well, and a surface scatter
of domestic artifacts and bricks. The previous investigators noted that the site had been disturbed by
livestock. The site was not delineated, and no shovel tests or other subsurface investigations were
performed at the time of its initial documentation.
Current Investigations
During the IES survey, archeologists revisited 41ML239 to reassess the current condition of the site and
to assess the potential for further testing and eligibility. The site was encountered on a level upland
terrace north of the South Bosque River (Figure 5.6; Appendix A.3, Photographs 01 and 02). In
general, FM 2671 extends in a northeast-to-southwest orientation approximately 15 m south of the site.
The site was documented within an area extending approximately 55 m north-to-south by 93 m east-towest, encompassing approximately 0.31 ha (0.78 ac) within the APE. The site was delineated based on
the distribution of archeological features, surface artifacts, negative shovel tests, and the extent of the
APE. The site abuts a portion of the APE boundary and was not delineated outside of the APE to the
south.
Ground surface visibility was highly variable at the site during the survey. The south-central portion of
the site exhibited nearly 100 percent surface visibility, which gradually decreased to about 50 percent to
the north along a grove of trees. Little of the ground surface was visible north of the trees due to
moderate vegetation growth, including a variety of short grasses, thistle, and buffalo burr. Investigators
observed sparse to moderate surface artifact scatters containing machine-made brick fragments, limestone
fragments, and a variety of domestic artifacts (Table 5.1), as well as the remnants of brick and concrete
foundation footers. The brick-lined well documented during the 1995 NWIRP survey was not
encountered during the site revisit.

During the delineation of 41ML239, IES investigators excavated 21 shovel tests (see Figure 5.6). The
soil profile exposed during shovel testing within the site was generally uniform and consisted of an upper
stratum of very dark brown (10YR 2/2) clay loam to depths of approximately 12 cmbs where dark brown
(10YR 3/3) clay was typically encountered. Artifacts were encountered within five shovel tests (H56,
OT1, OT10, OT13, and OT16) at the site. Subsurface artifacts primarily consisted of domestic glass and
ceramic items (Appendix A.3, Photographs 03 through 08) generally confined to the uppermost 20 cmbs
and concentrated within shovel tests OT10 and OT13 located in the central portion of the site (see Table
5.1). A sparse prehistoric site component was also identified during the survey.
Artifacts
Machine-made, red paste bricks were the most common artifact observed at the site. Both unmarked
bricks and examples with the “Corsicana Brick Co.” (1912 to 1934; Steinbomer 1982) stamp were present
(Appendix A.3, Photograph 09). Other architectural-related surface artifacts observed at the site
included a fragment of aqua window glass and a single wire nail (post-1890; Nelson 1968; Wells 2000).
Domestic artifacts included a variety of ceramic and glass items. Ceramic artifacts consisted of
whiteware (n=8, including blue spatter decorated [n=2; Appendix A.3, Photograph 10], a red annular
painted design, and one fragment that included the partial maker’s mark “…MOU…”), stoneware (n=3;
including a Bristol slip glazed exterior and interior 2-gallon crock rim fragment with cobalt pigment and
Bristol slip glazed exterior with Albany slip glazed interior examples), and porcelain (n=2; including one
example with a floral or ivy decal design). Glass artifacts included colorless, aqua, cobalt, and solarized
(1880 to 1920; Lockhart 2008) bottle fragments, a floral embossed white glass fragment, white glass
canning jar lid inserts, and a white glass mug or cup loop handle. Personal items observed at the site
include a white glass cold cream jar, two glass marbles, and a red plastic button (Appendix A.3,
Photographs 11 and 12).
A previously undocumented minor prehistoric component was documented at the site during this survey.
The prehistoric component was comprised of two pieces of chipped lithic debitage and one possible
burned or fire-cracked rock. One piece of debitage, consisting of a core reduction flake manufactured
from black fossiliferous chert with yellowish brown cortex on the dorsal surface, was observed on the
surface within the eastern portion of the site (Appendix A.3, Photographs 13 and 14). In shovel test
OT13, one greenish gray fossiliferous chert edge-modified biface thinning flake tool and a small
(approximately 1 cm) fragment of possible burned or fire-cracked rock was encountered (Appendix A.3,
Photographs 6, 15 and 16). None of the prehistoric artifacts recovered at the site are temporally
diagnostic and all were found in contexts mixed with historic-age artifacts.
Features
Feature 1 is a portion of a concrete foundation footer measuring approximately 7 m long (Appendix A.3,
Photographs 17 and 18). Feature 1 is highly fragmentary and represents only a small portion of the
overall layout of the former structure, which is obscured by tree canopy growth in historic aerial
photographs.
Feature 2 is a portion of a brick and concrete foundation footer that measures approximately 2.5 m long.
This feature is located approximately 6 m southwest of and parallel to Feature 1 (see Appendix A.3,
Photographs 17 and 18). Similar to Feature 1, Feature 2 is highly fragmentary. It is uncertain if the
feature was part of the same structure represented by Feature 1 or if it represents an adjacent structure.
Archival Research
Site 41ML239 is at a location of a structure depicted on the 1936 Texas State Highway Department map
of McLennan County and is visible on 1941 aerial photographs. The structures associated with the site
were demolished in 1942 following acquisition of the property by the federal government for construction
of the Bluebonnet Ordnance Plant. Although specific site structures are not visible on 1952, 1955, and

McGregor Mega Site Industrial Park
Cultural Resources Survey Report

IES Project No. 04.142.019
Page 33

1964 aerial photographs, a cluster of trees is evident at this location and persists through modern aerial
imagery.
The property is located within the 640-ac J. L. Johnson Survey, Abstract 484, patented on 09 February
1850. Using public records provided by the MCCO, a chain-of-title for the property was produced to
determine potential eligibility under Criterion A and/or B of the NRHP (Appendix B, Table 3). Based
on deed records and site observations, site 41ML239 pertains to the ownership of the Orand and Luedke
families. None of the names presented within the chain-of-title were listed in the Handbook of Texas
Online, the TxGenWeb Project website, or other local history resources.
Site Summary
Site 41ML239 represents a multi-component site comprised of a historic-period farmstead occupied
during the late 19th and early 20th centuries by the Orand and Luedke families and a minor non-diagnostic
prehistoric component. Site 41ML239 is approximately 55 m north-to-south by 93 m east-to-west,
encompassing approximately 0.31 ha (0.78 ac) within the APE. The southern portion of the site abuts the
edge of the APE and the site was not delineated outside of the APE. Twenty-one shovel tests were
excavated during the survey and site delineation. While subsurface artifacts were encountered within five
shovel tests excavated at the site, the majority of those artifacts (91.4 percent) were recovered within the
upper 20 cmbs. Furthermore, the sparse prehistoric component of the site is comingled with the historicperiod component. The brick-lined well feature that was observed at the site in 1995 has been obscured
by modern land use and was not identified during the current survey. The two historic-period
archeological features observed at the site are highly fragmentary and yield little indication of the plan or
layout of the original structures or the farmstead of which they are a part. The site abuts a portion of the
APE boundary and was not delineated outside of the APE to the south.
Site 41ML240
Previous Investigations
Site 41ML241 was originally recorded in 1995 by Prewitt and Associates, Inc. during the archeological
reconnaissance survey of the NWIRP and prior to transfer of the property from the Navy to the City of
McGregor (Stork and Fields 1996:13). At the time of its initial documentation, the site was described as a
historic-age homestead with a square concrete foundation slab, an octagonal concrete base (likely for a
windmill), and a surface scatter of domestic artifacts and bricks. The site was not delineated, and no
shovel tests or other subsurface investigations were performed at the time of its initial documentation.
Current Investigations
During the IES survey, archeologists revisited 41ML240 to reassess the current condition of the site and
to assess the potential for further testing and eligibility. The site was encountered near the summit of a
gently-sloped upland terrace, north of the South Bosque River (Figure 5.7; Appendix A.4, Photographs
1 through 3). The immediate area surrounding the site was active pasture. FM 2671 is orientated
northeast-to-southwest approximately 15 m southeast of the site. Site 41ML240 was documented within
an area extending approximately 72 m north-to-south by 76 m east-to-west, encompassing approximately
0.37 ha (0.92 ac) within the APE. The site was delineated based on the distribution of archeological
features, surface artifacts, negative shovel tests, and the extent of the APE. The site abuts a portion of the
APE boundary and was not delineated outside of the APE to the southeast.
Ground surface visibility was highly variable within the site. The southeastern portion of the site
exhibited nearly 100 percent surface visibility along a wooded fence line; however, little of the ground
surface was visible across much of the site due to moderate vegetation growth, including a variety of short
grasses and thistle. A sparse to moderate density surface artifact scatters containing brick fragments and
domestic artifacts, as well as two concrete foundation remnants was identified.

During the delineation of site 41ML240, IES investigators excavated 17 shovel tests. The soil profile
exposed during shovel testing within the site was generally uniform and consisted of an upper stratum of
compact very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay to a depth of approximately 30 to 40 cmbs with 10 percent
gravel inclusions overlying regolith. No cultural materials were identified within shovel tests.
Artifacts
Investigators observed sparse to moderate surface artifact scatters containing machine-made brick
fragments, concrete chunks, a rusted steel barrel, shotgun shells, a 0.38-caliber bullet, undecorated
whiteware ceramic sherds (n=9), amber bottle glass (n=1), colorless bottle glass (n=3), solarized bottle
glass (n=3; 1880-1920 [Lockhart 2008]), aqua bottle glass (n=2), light green bottle glass (n=1), colorless
window glass (n=3), and a white glass canning jar lid insert (Appendix A.4, Photographs 04 through
16). Several brick fragments featuring the “ALB” stamp were identified (Appendix A.4, Photographs
17 through 22). These were manufactured between 1890 and 1936 by the A. L. Branson brickyard in
Marlin, Texas. The base fragment of a colorless glass bottle manufactured by the Owens-Brockway
Glass Containers, Inc. in Ada, Oklahoma between 1964 and 1988 (Lockhart et al. 2013) was observed at
the site (see Appendix A.4, Photograph 16).
Features
Feature 1 was a concrete slab foundation measuring 4.5 m by 4.75 m (Appendix A.4, Photographs 23
through 25). This foundation was located generally in the center of the site. The slab was extremely
eroded within tall thistle and grasses growing through the cracks.
Feature 2 was a 1 m by 1 m octagonal concrete block located approximately 20 m northeast of Feature 1
(Appendix A.4, Photographs 26 and 27). Each corner of the block featured protruding eye-bolts
possibly indicating that the block was a removable cap for a well or other component.
Archival Research
Site 41ML240 is at a location of a structure depicted on the 1936 Texas State Highway Department map
of McLennan County and is visible on 1941 aerial photographs. The structures associated with the site
were demolished in 1942 following acquisition of the property by the federal government for construction
of the Bluebonnet Ordnance Plant. Although specific site structures are not visible on 1952, 1955, and
1964 aerial photographs, a cluster of trees is evident at this location and persist through modern aerial
imagery.
The property is located within the 640-ac J. L. Johnson Survey, Abstract 484, patented on 09 February
1850. Using public records provided by the MCCO, a chain-of-title for the property was produced to
determine potential eligibility under Criterion A and/or B of the NRHP (Appendix B, Table 2). The site
was part of a 1-ac tract that was located at the southwest corner of the Louise Becker 148-ac tract. This 1ac tract was conveyed with the Thomas Stewart 100-ac tract (also known as the McDonald 100-ac tract)
as early as 1875 (Deed Record Volume 38, Page 614). A property description from 1900 mentions
buildings and associated improvements on the 1-ac parcel (Deed Record Volume 129, Page 150).
According to the deed, the buildings “were at one time situated on the [McDonald] 100-acre tract but
were moved on to the one-acre tract by W. R. Prock,” whom owned the property from 1887 to 1893.
Based on deed records, the homestead, identified during this survey as site 41ML240, was initially
created by W. R. Prock in the late 19th century and appears to have been occupied by either subsequent
owners or tenant farmers until the property was sold to the federal government in 1942 (Deed Record
Volume 502, Page 176). None of the names presented within the chain-of-title were listed in the
Handbook of Texas Online, the TxGenWeb Project website, or other local history resources.

Site Summary
Site 41ML240 represents a historic-period farmstead established by W. R. Prock between 1887 and 1893,
and subsequently occupied by renters or tenant farmers until 1942. The site is located within an area
approximately 72 m north-to-south by 76 m east-to-west, encompassing approximately 0.37 ha (0.92 ac)
within the APE. The southeastern portion of the site abuts the edge of the APE and the site was not
delineated outside of the APE. Two archeological features and a sparse surface scatter of brick fragments
and domestic artifacts were observed. Seventeen shovel tests were excavated during intensive survey and
site delineation, none of which yielded subsurface cultural materials. The site abuts a portion of the APE
boundary and was not delineated outside of the APE to the southeast.
Site 41ML241
Previous Investigations
Site 41ML241 was originally recorded in 1995 by Prewitt and Associates, Inc. during the archeological
reconnaissance survey of the NWIRP and prior to transfer of the property from the Navy to the City of
McGregor (Stork and Fields 1996:13–14). At the time of its initial documentation, the site was described
as a historic-age homestead with a stone-lined well, a cellar, and a low-density domestic artifact surface
scatter. No shovel tests or other subsurface investigations were performed at the site at that time.
Current Investigations
Previously recorded historic-period site 41ML241 was encountered on the margin of an interfluvial ridge
extending along an unnamed tributary of the South Bosque River within the APE during this survey
(Figure 5.8). The site area gently sloped with scattered mature trees along the escarpment of the
landform and was within an active pasture (Appendix A.5, Photographs 1 through 5). Site 41ML241
was documented within an area extending approximately 53 m north-to-south by 62 m east-to-west,
encompassing approximately 0.25 ha (0.62 ac). The site was delineated based on the distribution of
surface features, surface artifacts, negative shovel tests, and landform. The site is entirely within the
APE.
Ground visibility during the survey was approximately 50 percent within and surrounding the site due to
the presence of short grasses and patches of cacti. The western portion of the site included a grove of
mature trees with ground surface visibility of 30 percent due to the resulting accumulation of leaf litter.
Several moderate to dense accumulations of stones were present, primarily within the north-central
portion of the site, surrounded by a low-density domestic artifact scatter.
During the delineation of site 41ML241, IES investigators excavated 13 shovel tests. The soil profile
exposed during shovel testing within the site was consisted of a thin surface stratum of compact very dark
brown (7.5YR 2.5/2) to dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay loam with frequent gravel inclusions.
Regolith was typically encountered at depths of approximately 5 to 10 cmbs across the site. No
subsurface cultural materials were recovered within shovel tests.
Artifacts
Investigators observed a low-density surface artifact scatter across much of the site. Surface artifacts
included undecorated whiteware (n=2), molded ironstone (n=1), Bristol slip-glazed stoneware with specks
of blue glaze, solarized glass (n=3), aqua bottle glass, porcelain, and an iron hook (Appendix A.5,
Photographs 6 through 11). The artifact assemblage also included two fragments of transfer-printed
earthenware (transferware) with a decorative motif known as flow blue, which generally dates to the
second half of the 19th century and first quarter of the 20th century (Maryland Archaeological
Conservation Laboratory 2018a). A pearlware sherd featuring a feathered edge pattern was also
identified within the scatter. Pearlware was produced during the 19th century (Esary 1982).

The site contained two stoneware sherds with a salt glaze, which was a glaze introduced to North America
during the Colonial period and widely produced until the early 20th century when its popularity
diminished (Maryland Archaeological Conservation Laboratory 2018b). Machine-made brick fragments
marked “WHITESELLE CORSICANA,” indicating manufacture since 1892 by the Whiteselle Brick and
Lumber Company of Navarro County (Appendix A.5, Photograph 12).
Features
Feature 1 is a dense scatter of chalky limestone rubble measuring approximately 21 m by 15 m
(Appendix A.5, Photographs 13 through 15). This limestone scatter is located generally in the center of
the site boundary, east of a cluster of trees. The cobbles are generally between 10 and 20 cm in diameter
and rounded in shape.
Feature 2 is a 3.5 m by 3.5 m cluster of fieldstones and brick fragments immediately south of Feature 1
(Appendix A.5, Photographs 16 through 18). The fieldstones within Feature 2 are distinct from those in
Feature 1 and consist of rectangular sandy limestone with moss growth staining their surface. Feature 2
likely pertains to the dugout cellar feature initially identified at the site during the 1995 NWIRP
archeological reconnaissance survey (Stork and Fields 1996:14).
Feature 3 is a dense scatter of chalky limestone cobbles that is generally square and measures
approximately 1 m by 1 m (Appendix A.5, Photographs 19). This feature is located near the eastern
margin of the site boundary, west of a cluster of trees. The cobbles are generally between 10 and 20 cm
in diameter. The nature of this feature is uncertain; however, it may pertain to the stone-lined well
previously noted at the site (Stork and Fields 1996:14).
Archival Research
Site 41ML241 is at a location of a structure depicted on the 1936 Texas State Highway Department map
of McLennan County and is visible on 1941 aerial photographs. The structures associated with the site
were demolished in 1942 following acquisition of the property by the federal government for construction
of the Bluebonnet Ordnance Plant. Although specific site structures are not visible on 1952, 1955, and
1964 aerial photographs, a cluster of trees is evident at this location and persists through modern aerial
imagery.
The property is located within the 4,605-ac Jesse Russell Survey, Abstract 743, patented on 07 November
1854. Using public records provided by the MCCO, a chain-of-title for the property was produced to
determine potential eligibility under Criterion A and/or B of the NRHP (Appendix B, Table 10). An
affidavit dating to 1909 designated the southern 200 ac of a 400-ac tract as the homestead of Charley
(Charles) Krollage and his wife Elise Krollage (Deed Record Volume 207, Page 580). According to U.S.
Census records, Charles and Elise Krollage were both German immigrants who came to Texas prior to the
turn of the 19th century. Based on deed records and site observations, site 41ML241 most likely pertains
to the ownership of the property by the Norton, Wille, and Krollage families. None of the names
presented within the chain-of-title were listed in the Handbook of Texas Online, the TxGenWeb Project
website, or local history resources.
Site Summary
Site 41ML241 represents a historic-period farmstead established by the Krollage family in the early 20th
century and occupied by later owners or tenants until acquisition by the U.S. government in 1942. The
site is located within an area approximately 53 m north-to-south by 62 m east-to-west, encompassing
approximately 0.25 ha (0.62 ac) within the APE. Three features and a sparse surface artifact scatter of
brick fragments and domestic artifacts were observed at the site. Thirteen shovel tests were excavated
during intensive survey and site delineation, none of which yielded subsurface cultural materials. The site
is entirely within the APE.

Site 41ML242
Previous Investigations
Site 41ML242 was originally recorded in 1995 by Prewitt and Associates, Inc. during the archeological
reconnaissance survey of the NWIRP and prior to transfer of the property from the Navy to the City of
McGregor (Stork and Fields 1996:14–15). At the time of its initial documentation, the site was described
as a historic-age artifact scatter probably representing a refuse dump. No shovel tests or other subsurface
investigations were performed at the site at that time.
Current Investigations
During the IES survey, archeologists revisited 41ML242 to reassess the current condition of the site and
to assess the potential for further testing and eligibility. The site was encountered on the banks of an
unnamed tributary of the South Bosque River, which flows generally west-to-east, immediately north of
the site (Figure 5.9; Appendix A.6, Photographs 1 through 5). Site 41ML241 was documented within
an area extending approximately 86 m north-to-south by 18 m east-to-west, encompassing approximately
0.14 ha (0.35 ac). The site was delineated based on the distribution of surface features, surface artifacts,
negative shovel tests, and natural landscape features. The site is entirely within the APE.
Ground visibility during the survey was approximately 10 percent within and surrounding the site due to
the presence of short grasses and some wooded growth. Investigators observed two historic-age surface
features and a low-density surface artifact scatter containing cast iron hardware, fieldstones, and brick
fragments.
During the delineation of site 41ML242, IES investigators excavated nine shovel tests. The soil profile
exposed during shovel testing within the site consisted of an upper stratum of compact, very dark brown
(10YR 2/2) clay loam to a depth of approximately 24 to 30 cmbs before gradually transitioning to dark
brown (10YR 3/3) clay that extended to depths of 40 cmbs, at which point saturated soils were
encountered. One positive site delineation shovel test (OT1) was excavated at site 41ML242.
Artifacts
At site 41ML242, a low-density surface artifact scatter was observed, primarily restricted to the stream
bank along the northeastern margin of the site. Surface artifacts consisted primarily of hand pressed brick
fragments and angular limestone fieldstones exposed along an approximately 3.5 to 4.5-m-long section of
the stream bank immediately north of Feature 1 (see Appendix A.6, Photograph 5). In addition to hand
pressed bricks, at least one machine-made brick was also observed. The machine-made brick was marked
“MEXIA,” indicating manufacture by the Mexia Press Brick Company between 1919 and 1928. Only
four domestic artifacts were encountered at the site. These were recovered within Shovel Test OT 1 at a
depth of 0 to 20 cmbs. These subsurface artifacts consisted of one flow blue transferware ceramic sherd
(1850 to 1925) and undecorated whiteware sherds (n=3). No additional artifacts were encountered at site
41ML242.
Features
Feature 1 is a pair of steel angle windmill supports spaced 1.75 m apart (Appendix A.6, Photograph 6).
The supports protrude approximately 8 in from the ground surface and border a slight depression located
approximately 9 m south of the unnamed tributary and immediately south of a concentation of hand
pressed bricks and fieldstones exposed within the bank of the stream. Feature 1 likely pertains to a late19th or early 20th century brick- and stone-lined well that was later used as a livestock water supply.
Feature 2 was a circular grove of trees on a circular, slightly raised landform approximately 3 m in
diameter located approximately 61 m southeast of Feature 1. A partial windmill blade was observed
within the wooded grove (Appendix A.6, Photograph 7).

Archival Research
No structures or other indications of the historic-period occupation of site 41ML242 are evident on
historical maps or aerial photographs. The property is located within the 4,605-ac Jesse Russell Survey,
Abstract 743, patented on 07 November 1854. Using public records provided by the MCCO, a chain-oftitle for the property was produced to determine potential eligibility under Criterion A and/or B of the
NRHP (Appendix B, Tables 9 and 10). In Deed Record Volume 393, Page 699 recorded in 1928,
interest to the northern half of Charles Krollage’s 400-ac tract is conveyed from Elise Krollage to Charles
Krollage. As part of the agreement, Elise Krollage had reserved the right to access the water wells
located along the creek at the southern end of the conveyed tract. She also reserved the right to erect any
necessary fixtures for taking water by hand or by windmill. Based on deed records and site observations,
site 41ML242 most likely pertains to the ownership of the property by the Norton, Wille, and Krollage
families. None of the names presented within the chain-of-title were listed in the Handbook of Texas
Online, the TxGenWeb Project website, or local history resources.
Site Summary
Site 41ML242 represents historic-period wells established by the Krollage family in the early 20th century
and used by later owners or tenants until acquisition by the U.S. government in 1942. The site is located
within an area approximately 86 m north-to-south by 18 m east-to-west, encompassing approximately
0.14 ha (0.35 ac) within the APE. Two probable well features, later modified by the installation of
windmills, and a sparse surface artifact scatter of brick fragments and fieldstones was observed. Nine
shovel tests were excavated during this intensive survey and site delineation; only one yielded flow blue
and undecorated whiteware sherds (n=4) within the upper 20 cmbs. The site is entirely within the APE.
Site 41ML243
Site 41ML243 was originally recorded in 1995 by Prewitt and Associates, Inc. during the archeological
reconnaissance survey of the NWIRP and prior to transfer of the property from the Navy to the City of
McGregor (Stork and Fields 1996:15). At the time of its initial documentation, the site was described as a
multi-component site consisting of a historic-period homestead with a minor prehistoric component. No
shovel tests or other subsurface investigations were performed at the site at that time.
Current Investigations
During the IES survey, archeologists revisited 41ML243 to reassess the current condition of the site and
to assess the potential for further testing and eligibility. The site was encountered on the dissected
escarpment of an interfluvial upland landform bordering an unnamed tributary of the South Bosque River
(Figure 5.10; Appendix A.7, Photographs 1 through 6). Site 41ML243 was documented within an area
extending approximately 69 m north-to-south by 61 m east-to-west, encompassing approximately 0.24 ha
(0.59 ac). The site was delineated based on the distribution of surface artifacts, negative shovel tests, and
natural landscape features. The site is entirely within the APE.
Ground visibility during the survey was approximately 50 percent within and surrounding the site due to
the presence of short grass and patches of cacti and large exposures of regolith. Investigators observed a
low-density surface artifact scatter containing historic-age domestic artifacts.
During the delineation of site 41ML243, IES investigators excavated nine shovel tests. The soil profile
exposed during shovel testing within the site was generally uniform and consisted of an upper stratum of
compact dark brown (10YR 3/2) clay loam to a depth of approximately 8 to 10 cmbs with frequent
limestone gravel. Beneath this, a layer of very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/5) clay was observed to a depth of
10 to 15 cmbs where regolith was typically encountered. No cultural materials were recovered within
shovel tests excavated at the site.

Artifacts
Investigators observed a low-density surface artifact scatter consisting of historic-age domestic and
architecture-related artifacts. Artifacts observed at the site include colorless flat glass (n=1), solarized
bottle glass (n=1), solarized pressed or relief-molded table glass (n=1), a white glass canning jar lid insert
fragment, riveted sheet metal (n=2), a porcelain rim sherd with a decal decoration, and several bricks
bearing the “MEXIA” stamp (Appendix A.7, Photographs 7 through 10). Surface artifacts were
concentrated within a small gully that extended north through the site, dissecting the upland escarpment.
Within the northwestern quadrant of the site, a large concentration of limestone rubble was observed (see
Appendix A.7, Photograph 2). Current aerial imagery indicates these stones were exposed when a large
tree was uprooted between 1995 and 2008. A patch of irises and several large fieldstone blocks were
identified in the eastern portion of the site (see Appendix A.7, Photograph 6). No prehistoric artifacts
were observed at the site. No additional surface or subsurface artifacts were encountered at site
41ML243.
Archival Research
A structure is discernable within the eastern portion of site 41ML243 on 1941 aerial photographs. The
location of the structure coincides with several large fieldstones and beds of irises observed at the site (see
Appendix A.7, Photographs 3 through 6). The site is located within the 1,652-ac B. C. Walters Survey,
Abstract 892, patented on 07 April 1853. Using public records provided by the MCCO, a chain-of-title
for the property was produced to determine potential eligibility under Criterion A and/or B of the NRHP
(Appendix B, Table 6). Based on deed records and site observations, site 41ML243 most likely pertains
to the property ownership by the Amthor and Horstmann families in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
With the exception of Texas land agent Jacob De Cordova and local farmer William Amthor (see site
41ML113; Section 5.2.1.4), no other names presented within the chain-of-title are listed in the Handbook
of Texas Online, the TxGenWeb Project website, or other local history resources.
Site Summary
Site 41ML243 represents a historic-period farmstead occupied during the late 19th or early 20th century.
The site is located in an area approximately 69 m north-to-south by 61 m east-to-west, encompassing
approximately 0.24 ha (0.59 ac) within the APE. A sparse artifact surface scatter consisting of bricks and
domestic debris was observed at the site. Nine shovel tests were excavated during intensive survey and
site delineation, none of which yielded subsurface cultural materials. Despite a previously documented
prehistoric component at the site, no prehistoric artifacts or features were observed. The site is entirely
within the APE.
Site 41ML244
Previous Investigations
Site 41ML244 was originally recorded in 1995 by Prewitt and Associates, Inc. during the archeological
reconnaissance survey of the NWIRP and prior to transfer of the property from the Navy to the City of
McGregor (Stork and Fields 1996:15). At the time of its initial documentation, the site was described as a
multi-component site likely representing a historic-age refuse dump and a minor prehistoric component.
No shovel tests or other subsurface investigations were performed at the site at that time.
Current Investigations
During the IES survey, archeologists revisited 41ML244 to reassess the current condition of the site and
to assess the potential for further testing and eligibility. The site was encountered along a dissected
interfluvial terrace escarpment and extends down the upland slope to the channel of an unnamed tributary
of the South Bosque River (Figure 5.11; Appendix A.8, Photographs 01 and 07). Site 41ML244 was
documented within an area extending approximately 84 m north-to-south by 122 m east-to-west,

encompassing approximately 0.77 ha (1.91 ac). The site was delineated based on the distribution of
surface artifacts, shovel tests, and natural landscape features. The site abuts a portion of the APE
boundary and was not delineated outside of the APE.
Ground surface visibility during the survey was approximately 30 percent within and surrounding the site
due to the short grass coverage and patches of cacti with large areas of 50 percent or greater surface
visibility in areas of exposed regolith. Vegetation within and surrounding the site included short grasses,
cacti, and small woody shrubs, with several mature hardwood trees along the banks of the unnamed
tributary. Investigators observed one historic-age brick-lined well feature and a low to moderate density
surface artifact scatter containing historic-age domestic artifacts and prehistoric chipped lithic artifacts.
During the delineation of site 41ML244, IES investigators excavated 22 shovel tests. The soil profile
exposed during shovel testing within the site was generally uniform and consisted of an upper stratum of
very dark, grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay loam with frequent gravel to a depth of approximately 10 to 15
cmbs. Soil profiles within the northwest and southeast portions of the site exhibited a second stratum of
very dark brown (10YR 2/2) clay. Regolith was encountered throughout much the site at depths ranging
from 15 to 30 cmbs, with the exception of shovel tests OT12 through 16 excavated along the unnamed
tributary. Artifacts were recovered within five shovel tests excavated during the site delineation.
Artifacts
Investigators observed low to moderate density surface artifact scatters across the site (Appendix A.8,
Photographs 08 through 37). In general, prehistoric artifacts were observed in higher frequencies across
the western portion of the site, both on the summit of the landform and along the bank of the unnamed
tributary of the South Bosque River. Historic-age domestic artifacts were generally concentrated on the
eastern portion of the site along the upland escarpment, descending a mid-slope bench, and extending
along the bank of the unnamed tributary.
Prehistoric artifacts observed at the site included chipped lithic debitage (n=15), biface fragments (n=5),
edge-modified flake tools (n=2), burned or fire-cracked rock, a multi-function groundstone tool, and a
groundstone slab. Two of the biface fragments are basal portions of hafted bifacial tools. One is clearly
consistent with the Transitional Archaic period Darl projectile point type (Prewitt 1981; see Appendix
A.8, Photograph 29). While the other hafted biface is more crude in manufacture, it is generally
consistent with the Darl type (Appendix A.8, Photograph 09). All of the prehistoric artifacts
encountered at the site were exposed on the surface, with the exception of a medial biface fragment
observed at a depth of 12 cmbs within a cutbank of the unnamed tributary and those recovered in shovel
test OT14, excavated along the bank of the unnamed tributary. Prehistoric artifacts recovered within
shovel test OT14, consisted of biface thinning flakes (n=3), angular chert shatter (n=1), an edge-modified
flake tool, a bifacial perforating tool, a fragment of mussel shell, and a piece of burned or fire-cracked
rock from 0 to 20 cmbs (see Appendix A.8, Photograph 44). Seven additional burned or fire-cracked
rock fragments were recovered from a depth range of 20 to 40 cmbs within shovel test OT14 (see
Appendix A.8, Photograph 45); however, no intact subsurface prehistoric archeological feature was
encountered within the shovel test or the cutbank exposure adjacent it. No additional prehistoric artifacts
were recovered within any of the adjacent shovel tests excavated along the unnamed tributary.
Historic-age artifacts observed at the site include colorless bottle glass, a colorless glass canning jar lid
with the Ball Brothers Glass Company logo (1913 to 1960), solarized bottle glass (n=4), solarized pressed

and Lumber Company (post-1902; Steinbomer 1982).
Four shovel tests excavated at site 41ML244 (C70, OT1, OT4, and OT7) were positive for historic-period
artifacts (Table 5.2). Historic-period artifacts were recovered within the upper 20 cmbs and included
ivory-tinted whiteware (n=1), colorless bottle glass (n=11), amber bottle glass (n=3), light green bottle
glass (n=2) colorless flat glass (n=8); wire nails (n=9), a steel sanitary food can rim, a bolt, a washer, a
railroad spike, a fragment of steel metal, a fragment of cast iron, and a mussel shell fragment (Appendix
A.8, Photographs 38 and 46). In addition to the historic-period artifacts observed within the surface
scatter at site 41ML244, three sections of a fragmented brick and mortar well collar were observed along
the cutbank of the unnamed tributary.

Archival Research
No structures or other indications of the historic occupation of site 41ML244 are evident at this location
on historical maps or aerial photographs. The site is located within the 1,652-ac B. C. Walters Survey,
Abstract 892, patented on 07 April 1853. A chain-of-title for the property was produced to determine
potential eligibility under Criterion A and/or B of the NRHP using public records provided by the MCCO
(Appendix B, Table 7). Based on deed records and site observations, the historic-period component of
41ML244 most likely pertains to the property ownership of the Amthor and Horstmann families in the
late 19th and early 20th centuries. With the exception of Texas land agent Jacob De Cordova and local
farmer William Amthor (see site 41ML113; Section 5.2.1.4), no other names presented within the chainof-title were listed in the Handbook of Texas Online, the TxGenWeb Project website, or other history
resources.
Site Summary
Site 41ML244 represents an area used both by semi-nomadic prehistoric populations as well as historicperiod farmers and ranchers. The prehistoric component of the site suggests short-term and perhaps
repeated use of the site as a hunting or foraging camp during the Transitional Archaic period. The
historic-period component of the site likely represents an activity area used during the late 19th or early
20th centuries, presumably by the Amthor and Horstmann families or their tenants residing nearby. The
site is located in an area approximately 284 m north-to-south by 122 m east-to-west, encompassing
approximately 0.77 ha (1.91 ac) within the APE. A sparse artifact surface scatter consisting of bricks,
historic-period domestic debris, and prehistoric chipped lithic, ground stone, and thermally-altered stone
artifacts were observed at the site. Twenty-two shovel tests were excavated during intensive survey and
site delineation, five of which yielded cultural materials. The site abuts a portion of the APE boundary
and was not delineated outside of the APE to the north.
Site 41ML251
Previous Investigations
Site 41ML251 was originally recorded in 1995 by Prewitt and Associates, Inc. during the archeological
reconnaissance survey of the NWIRP and prior to transfer of the property from the Navy to the City of
McGregor (Stork and Fields 1996:19). At the time of its initial documentation, the site was described as a
an isolated historic-period well with brick upper courses and lower courses of stone. No shovel tests or
other subsurface investigations were performed at the site at that time.

Current Investigations
During the IES survey, archeologists revisited 41ML251 to reassess the current condition of the site and
to assess the potential for further testing and eligibility. The site was encountered on a gently-undulating,
eroded upland terrace near a stock pond and drainage channel (Figure 5.12; Appendix A.9, Photographs
01 through 03). An unpaved access road was located along the western boundary of the site. The
drainage feature contained standing water at the time of survey. Pugging by cattle was prevalent
throughout the site. Site 41ML251 was documented within an area extending approximately 12 m northto-south by 37 m east-to-west, encompassing approximately 0.03 ha (0.08 ac). The site was delineated
based on the distribution of surface artifacts, archeological features, negative shovel tests, and observed
disturbances. The site is entirely within the APE.
Ground surface visibility at the site was approximately 50 percent during the survey due to the presence
of short pasture grasses. Near the location of the previously recorded site centroid, investigators observed
a single, whiteware ceramic sherd (Appendix A.9, Photograph 04). Two concentrations of fieldstones
and a segment of iron pipe were observed immediately east of an access road, generally extending northto-south through the central portion of the APE. No additional surface or subsurface artifacts were
encountered site 41ML251.
During the delineation of site 41ML251, IES investigators excavated six shovel tests. The soil profile
exposed during shovel testing within the site was generally uniform and consisted of an upper stratum of
saturated very dark brown (10YR 2/2) clay loam to a depth of approximately 10 cmbs. Beneath this, a
stratum of saturated dark brown (10YR 3/3) clay was encountered to a depth of 30 to 35 cmbs. No
cultural materials were identified within shovel tests.
Features
Features 1 and 2 were concentrations of rectangular fieldstones located along the western site boundary
immediately adjacent to an access road (Appendix A.9, Photographs 05 through 10). These clusters
measured approximately 1 m by 2 m and consisted of limestone. Visible blocks on the surface measured
approximately 50 cm by 30 cm. A drainage channel extending east-to-west was observed south of the
southern fieldstone concentration. These stone clusters likely represent demolished components of the
historic-age well feature originally observed during the 1995 NWIRP survey.
Archival Research
Site 41ML251 is at a location of a structure depicted on the 1936 Texas State Highway Department map
of McLennan County but is not visible on 1941 aerial photographs. The property is located within the
640-ac J. L. Johnson Survey, Abstract 484, patented on 09 February 1850. Using public records provided
by the MCCO, a chain-of-title for the property was produced to determine potential eligibility under
Criterion A and/or B of the NRHP (Appendix B, Table 2). None of the names presented within the
chain-of-title were listed in the Handbook of Texas Online, the TxGenWeb Project website, or other local
history resources.
Site Summary
Site 41ML251 represents the location of a homestead or portion of a nearby homestead present during the
early 20th century. The site is located in an area approximately 12 m north-to-south by 37 m east-to-west,
encompassing approximately 0.03 ha (0.08 ac) within the APE. Two concentrations of fieldstones,
presumably related to a historic-age well feature previously recorded at the site, and a single historic-age
domestic artifact were observed at the site. Six shovel tests were excavated during intensive survey and
site delineation, none of which yielded subsurface cultural materials. The site has likely been impacted
by expansion and maintenance of the adjacent access road and drainage ditch. The site is entirely within
the APE.

Site 41ML252
Previous Investigations
Site 41ML252 was originally recorded in 1995 by Prewitt and Associates, Inc. during the archeological
reconnaissance survey of the NWIRP and prior to transfer of the property from the Navy to the City of
McGregor (Stork and Fields 1996:19). At the time of its initial documentation, the site was described as a
historic-period homestead with a brick chimney base and associated stone foundations, large concrete
slab, two possible wells, a large surface depression, and a moderate to high-density surface artifact
scatter.
Current Investigations
During the IES survey, archeologists revisited 41ML251 to reassess the current condition of the site and
to assess the potential for further testing and eligibility. The site was situated within a poorly-drained,
gently-undulating upland area (Figure 5.13; Appendix A.10, Photographs 01 and 02). During the site
delineation, no surface or subsurface features and artifacts were observed through pedestrian survey or
shovel testing. Between 2002 and 2005 a series of subterranean chemical remediation structures,
commonly referred to as biowalls, were constructed as the primary groundwater remediation technology
within this portion of the APE. One of these biowalls intersects the area within and surrounding the
previously recorded location of site 41ML252. As a result, the area within and surrounding site
41ML252 was significantly disturbed and the footprint of this biowall remains visible on modern aerial
imagery. As such, it was determined that 41ML252 had been completely removed through the
construction of the biowall.
Ground surface visibility at the site was approximately 50 percent during the survey due to the presence
of short grasses. To verify the absence of cultural materials and the impact of the biowall construction,
IES investigators excavated five shovel tests within and surrounding the previously recorded site centroid
location. The soil profile exposed during shovel testing within the site generally consisted of an upper
stratum of very dark brown (10YR2/2) gravelly clay loam to a depth of 10 to 12 cmbs. Beneath this, a
stratum of very dark, grayish brown (10YR3/2) gravelly clay was observed. No artifacts were observed
on the ground surface or within the shovel tests excavated at site 41ML252. The site is entirely within the
APE.
Site Summary
Due to the construction of a biowall subterranean remediation structure in the early 2000s, site 41ML252
has been completely destroyed. Investigators did not identify any surface or subsurface cultural materials
within or surrounding the previously recorded location of site 41ML252. Five shovel tests were
excavated during intensive survey to verify the lack of cultural materials at the former site location. The
site is entirely within the APE.
Site 41ML258
Previous Investigations
Site 41ML258 was originally recorded in 1995 by Prewitt and Associates, Inc. during the archeological
reconnaissance survey of the NWIRP and prior to transfer of the property from the Navy to the City of
McGregor (Stork and Fields 1996:22). At the time of its initial documentation, the site was described as a
historic artifact scatter probably representing a homestead or refuse dump. Artifacts observed at the site
by the previous investigators included machine-made bottles, screw-top bottles, porcelain, decaldecorated ceramics, colorless glass, and bricks marked “WHITESELLE CORSICANA” made by the
Whiteselle Brick and Lumber Company. The previous investigators also noted that the site had been
plowed and was not intact. No shovel tests or other subsurface investigations were performed at the site
at that time.

Current Investigations
During the IES survey, archeologists revisited 41ML258 to reassess the current condition of the site and
to assess the potential for further testing and eligibility. The site was encountered along the western
border of the APE approximately 0.3 mi southeast of the intersection of Lam Road and McGuffey Road.
Topographically, the site was located on a slightly elevated rise within a gently-sloped interfluvial upland.
The site area was within a moderately trampled cattle pasture (Figure 5.14; Appendix A.11,
Photographs 1 through 6). At the time of survey, a portion of the site was covered with hay as a result of
recent cattle feeding (Appendix A.11, Photographs 7 and 8). Delineation identified the site occupied an
area extending approximately 49 m north-to-south by 62 m east-to-west, encompassing approximately
0.26 ha (0.64 ac). The site was delineated based on the distribution of archeological features, surface
artifacts, negative shovel tests, and the extent of the APE. The site abuts a portion of the APE boundary
and was not delineated outside of the APE to the west.
Ground visibility during the survey was highly variable across the site and ranged from 0 to 100 percent
within and surrounding the site. Investigators observed moderate density artifact scatters containing brick
fragments, clear bottle glass (n=9), aqua glass (n=2), stoneware (n=6), glass bottles (n=2), scrap metal,
and concrete chunks (Appendix A.11, Photographs 10 through 20). Several brick fragments were
identified that featured the “WHITESELLE CORSICANA” stamp with the Common Brick
Manufacturers’ Association insignia, commonly used on bricks made in the 1920s and 1930s (Steinbomer
1982; Appendix A.11, Photographs 21 through 23). Two intact glass bottles were also observed. The
first was an intact 16-ounce amber glass bottle manufactured by the Thatcher Glass Manufacturing
Company in 1971 (Appendix A.11, Photographs 24 and 25). The second glass bottle was cobalt blue
glass Vick Va-trol-nol medicine bottle manufactured for the Vick Chemical Company between 1930 and
the mid-1970s (Appendix A.11, Photographs 26 and 27). Finally, a 1998 “Do Not Disturb” Naval
Facilities Engineering Command monitoring well identification sign was observed (Appendix A.11,
Photograph 28). No additional surface artifacts were encountered at site 41ML258.
During the delineation of site 41ML258, IES investigators excavated nine shovel tests. The soil profile
exposed during shovel testing within the site was generally uniform and consisted of an upper stratum of
compact dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay to a depth of approximately 50 cmbs with 10 percent
gravel inclusions. Beneath this, regolith was encountered. Shovel test D24 was positive for cultural
materials, which included a concrete chunk and two wire nails recovered within the upper 30 cmbs
(Appendix A.11, Photograph 29).
Features
Feature 1 was a concrete foundation block measuring 75 cm by 75 cm (Appendix A.11, Photograph
30). This foundation was slightly eroded with corners and edges chipped away. Four threaded round
bolts protruded from the top face of the block.
Feature 2 was a 38 m by 7.5 m, high-density artifact scatter located within the eastern half of the site
(Appendix A.11, Photographs 31 through 44). Most of the artifacts within this feature were articulated
bricks, some of which were mortared to fragments of concrete foundation footers. Numerous loose bricks
and brick fragments were within an area surrounding the articulated bricks. It is likely that this feature
pertained to a collapsed chimney that was dispersed when the site was demolished through mechanical
means and subsequent plowing and pugging by cattle.
Archival Research
No structures are indicated at the location of site 41ML258 on the 1936 McLennan County highway map;
however, at least two structures are evident at the location on 1941 aerial photographs. The property is
located within the 4,605-ac Jesse Russell Survey, Abstract 743, patented on 07 November 1854. Using
public records provided by the MCCO, a chain-of-title for the property was produced to determine

potential eligibility under Criterion A and/or B of the NRHP (Appendix B, Table 14). Based on deed
records and site observations, 41ML258 most likely pertains to property ownership under the Sewell,
Hering, and Webb families. None of the names presented within the chain-of-title were listed in the
Handbook of Texas Online, the TxGenWeb Project website, or local history volumes.
Site Summary
Site 41ML258 represents a historic-period farmstead occupied during the late 19th or early 20th centuries.
The site is located in an area approximately 49 m north-to-south by 62 m east-to-west, encompassing
approximately 0.26 ha (0.64 ac) within the APE. Two archeological features and a sparse surface scatter
of brick fragments and domestic artifacts were observed. Nine shovel tests were excavated during
intensive survey and site delineation, one of which yielded three historic-period artifacts within the upper
30 cmbs. The site abuts a portion of the APE boundary and was not delineated outside of the APE to the
west.
Site 41ML259
Previous Investigations
Site 41ML259 was originally recorded in 1995 by Prewitt and Associates, Inc. during the archeological
reconnaissance survey of the NWIRP and prior to transfer of the property from the Navy to the City of
McGregor (Stork and Fields 1996:22). At the time of its initial documentation, the site was described as
an isolated historic well with upper brick courses and lower courses of fieldstones. No shovel tests or
other subsurface investigations were performed at the site at that time. TASA records illustrate the site
centroid located approximately 15 m west of the IES site delineation.
Current Survey Observations
During the IES survey, archeologists revisited 41ML259 to reassess the current condition of the site and
to assess the potential for further testing and eligibility. The site was encountered on an interfluvial
terrace near the headwaters of an unnamed tributary of the South Bosque River (Figure 5.15; Appendix
A.12, Photographs 1 and 2). Site 41ML259 was documented within an area extending approximately 20
m north-to-south by 6 m east-to-west, encompassing approximately 0.008 ha (0.02 ac). The site was
delineated based on the distribution of surface artifacts, negative shovel tests, natural landscape features,
and observed disturbances. The site does not extend beyond the APE. The site is entirely within the
APE.
Ground surface visibility during the survey was approximately 20 percent within and surrounding the site.
Vegetation within and surrounding the site included short grasses, cacti, and small woody shrubs.
Investigators observed sparse surface artifact scatters containing whiteware sherds (n=3), aqua blue bottle
glass (n=1), and brick and brick fragments, and a brick manufactured by the Waco Brick Company (1920
to 1938) (Appendix A.12, Photographs 3 through 5). No other surface or subsurface artifacts were
encountered at site 41ML259.
During the delineation of site 41ML259, IES investigators excavated seven shovel tests. The soil profile
exposed during shovel testing within the site was generally uniform and consisted of an upper stratum of
very dark, grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay loam to a depth of approximately 16 to 24 cmbs. This layer
was underlain by a very dark brown (10YR 2/2) saturate clay to approximately 40 cmbs. No artifacts were
encountered within shovel tests.
Archival Research
No structures or other indications of the historic occupation of site 41ML259 are evident at this location
on historical maps or aerial photographs. The property is located within the 4,605-ac Jesse Russell
Survey, Abstract 743, patented on 07 November 1854. Using public records provided by the MCCO, a
chain-of-title for the property was produced to determine potential eligibility under Criterion A and/or B

of the NRHP (Appendix B, Tables 12 and 13). The site was near the dividing line between 38-ac and
85-ac tracts once part of the 112-ac Prock tract. When W. E. Crews conveyed the 38-ac tract (eastern
portion of Prock tract) to his in-laws A. J. Sewell and Kate Sewell in 1912, the western boundary line was
made “crooked.” In Deed Record Volume 408, Page 498, K. A. Reed and Lula Fisk quit claimed small
portions of their land to each other to straighten this boundary. An agreement between the owners states a
well and associated windmill were located on K. A. Reed’s property (the western portion of Prock tract)
before the boundary change (Deed Record Volume 408, Page 497). After the division line was
straightened, the well became part of Lula Fisk’s property, but K. A. Reed was given the right to access
and maintain the well and the associated windmill. The well was stated to be located “something like 500
varas south of Fisk’s north line and something like 150 feet east of Fisk’s west line,” which would place
the well near site 41ML259. None of the names presented within the chain-of-title were listed in the
Handbook of Texas Online, the TxGenWeb Project website, or local history volumes.
Site Summary
Site 41ML259 represents a historic-period farmstead occupied during the late 19th century or early 20th
century. Site 41ML259 is located in an area approximately 20 m north-to-south by 6 m east-to-west,
encompassing approximately 0.008 ha (0.02 ac) within the APE. Seven shovel tests were excavated
during intensive survey and site delineation, none of which yielded cultural materials. A sparse surface
scatter of ceramics, glass, and brick fragments were observed. The site is entirely within the APE.
Site 41ML326
Current Investigations
During the IES survey, previously undocumented historic-period site 41ML326 was encountered within
the APE (Figure 5.16). Site 41ML326 was documented within an approximate 2.6 km north-to-south by
224 m east-to-west area, encompassing approximately 4.8 ha (11.8 ac). The site was delineated based on
the distribution of archeological features, surface artifacts, negative shovel tests, and the extent of the
APE. The site abuts a portion of the APE boundary and was not delineated outside of the APE to the east
and west.
Site 41ML326 was associated with the historic-period railway and road that once serviced the Bluebonnet
Ordnance Plant. The site traversed the eastern and western boundary of the APE ultimately connecting
the plant to the St. Louis and Southwestern Railroad (Appendix A.13, Photographs 01 through 15). The
site generally paralleled McGuffey Road. East of Judith Drive, the site slightly curved towards the
northeastern corner of the APE. The railway west of Judith Drive featured two to three railway tracks
with scattered rail road ties. East of Judith Drive, the railway converges to a single track. The footprint
of a historic-period roadway that serviced the railway and its associated staging area was observed
encircling the western half of the railway (see Appendix A.13, Photograph 01). The footprint of the
northern course of the roadway was occupied by McGuffey Road. The eastern course of the service road
was offset from Judith Drive by 145 m to the west. The southern course of the service road paralleled the
railway approximately 75 m to the south. The western course of the service road was approximately 87 m
east of the site boundary. The majority of the railway staging area was located outside the APE. At the
eastern extent of the site, the railway features a spur that ended in an elevated C-shaped berm that served
as a temporary storage area for train cars loaded with ordnance, providing an additional degree of safety
before the loaded cars left the plant area (Appendix A.13, Photographs 11 through 14).
Ground visibility at the surface was 0 to 20 percent within and surrounding the site. Vegetation within
and surrounding the site included short grasses, cacti, small woody shrubs, and patches of buffalo gourd.
Investigators observed scattered railway ties along the railway with glass (clear jar [n=3], flat window),
wire nails (n=2), and scrap metal (Appendix A.13, Photographs 15 through 17). No other surface or

subsurface artifacts were encountered at site 41ML113. A railroad crossing sign was observed standing at
the western intersection of the railway and service road (Appendix A.13, Photographs 18). The crossing
sign featured one attached cross timber with embedded glass marbles attached with tin brackets.
During the delineation of site 41ML326, IES investigators excavated 12 shovel tests. The soil profile
exposed during shovel testing within the site consisted of an upper stratum that ranged from very dark,
grayish brown (10YR 3/2) to dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) clay loam with frequent gravel inclusions to a
depth ranging from 20 to 40 cmbs. Beneath this, an eroded bedrock was encounter. No shovel tests were
positive for cultural materials.
Features
Feature 1 was a concrete slab foundation measuring 9 m by 7.5 m (Appendix A.13, Photographs 19
through 26). This foundation was identified on historic-period aerial imagery. The façade of the
foundation features a 20 cm rise with anchor bolts spaced at approximately 1.25-m intervals. The
foundation features two 50 cm step platforms attached to the east and west façade. A third detached
concrete platform is located off the southeast corner. Two drainage pipes were embedded along the
eastern side of the foundation.
Site Summary
Site 41ML326 was documented within an approximate 2.6 km north-to-south by 224 m east-to-west area,
encompassing approximately 4.8 ha (11.8 ac) within the APE. One concrete foundation feature and a
sparse surface scatter of domestic debris were observed. The site represents a historic-period railroad and
rail house constructed in 1942 during the expansion of the St. Louis and Southwestern Railroad to service
the Bluebonnet Ordnance Plant. Twelve shovel tests were excavated during intensive survey and site
delineation, none of which yielded cultural materials. The site abuts portions of the APE boundary and
was not delineated outside of the APE to the east and west.
Site 41ML327
Current Investigations
During the IES survey, a newly recorded historic-period site was encountered within the APE (Figure
5.17). The site was located directly north of the confluence of two tributaries flowing eastwards towards
the South Bosque River (Appendix A.14, Photographs 01 through 03). Site 41ML327 was documented
within an area extending approximately 37 m north-to-south by 16 m east-to-west, encompassing
approximately 0.04 ha (0.10 ac). The southern and eastern limits of the site were bounded by the
tributaries. Vegetation primarily consisted of short grasses that have been frequently grazed by cattle.
The site was delineated based on the distribution of surface artifacts, negative shovel tests, and natural
landscape features. The site is entirely within the APE.
Ground visibility during the survey was 35 percent due to moderately dense short grass cover.
Investigators observed several bricks scattered on the surface, including examples marked “WACO B Co”
for the Waco Brick Company, which operated from 1920 to 1938 (Appendix A.14, Photograph 04). A
stoneware sherd was encountered in the southern portion of the site. The sherd featured a white glaze or
Bristol slip on the exterior and a glazed dark brown or Albany slip on the interior of the former vessel
(Appendix A.14, Photographs 05 and 06). An intact, clear glass bottle was located near the stoneware
sherd (Appendix A.14, Photographs 07 and 08). The bottle had a maker’s mark of a “P” in a circle for
the Pierce Glass Company (1905 to 1987). The bottle was also embossed with a label of “MILES’
LABORATORY, INC.” The company was originally founded by Dr. Franklin Miles as Dr. Miles’
Medical Company in the 1880s and renamed to Miles Laboratory in the 1930s. The company was
purchased by Bayer AG in 1977.

During the delineation of site 41ML327, IES investigators excavated six shovel tests. The soil profile
exposed during shovel testing within the site was generally uniform and consisted of a dark brown (10YR
2/2 and 3/1) clay loam to a depth of approximately 30 to 40 cmbs. All shovel tests were negative for
cultural materials.
Features
Feature 1 was a stone-lined well with a brick and mortar collar located in a swale in the northern portion
of the site (Appendix A.14, Photographs 09 and 10). The well measured approximately 1.5 m in
diameter. Below the surface, the well was lined with layers of stone. Above the surface, the walls were
constructed of machine-made bricks set in mortar. One brick was visibly marked “MEXIA” for the
Mexia Press Brick Company (1919 to 1928). During the survey, archeologists observed the brick collar
had been fractured and the well had been filled with brick fragments and other debris.
Feature 2 was the remnant of a windmill base observed approximately 6 m north of Feature 1 within the
same swale. Feature 2 consisted of an angled metal support post protruding from the ground.
Archival Research
No structures or other indications of the historic occupation of site 41ML327 are evident at this location
on historical maps or aerial photographs. The property is located within the 4,605-ac Jesse Russell
Survey, Abstract 743, patented on 07 November 1854. Using public records provided by the MCCO, a
chain-of-title for the property was produced to determine potential eligibility under Criterion A and/or B
of the NRHP (Appendix B, Table 12). Based on deed records and site observations, the property
ownership of site 41ML327 most likely pertains to the Sewell, Fisk, and Hering families during the early
20th century. None of the names presented within the chain-of-title were listed in the Handbook of Texas
Online, the TxGenWeb Project website, or other sources for local history.
Site Summary
Site 41ML327 occupied an area approximately 37 m north-to-south by 16 m east-to-west, encompassing
approximately 0.04 ha (0.10 ac) within the APE. Two features and a sparse surface scatter of brick
fragments, stoneware, and glass (n<50) were observed. Site 41ML327 represents a historic-period
farmstead occupied during the first half of the 20th century. Six shovel tests were excavated during
intensive survey and site delineation, none of which yielded cultural materials. The site is entirely within
the APE.
Site 41ML328
Current Investigations
During the IES survey, a newly recorded historic-period site was encountered within the APE (Figure
5.18). The site was located on the north and south banks of an unnamed tributary, which flows eastwards
to the South Bosque River (Appendix A.15, Photographs 01 through 03). Site 41ML328 was
documented within an area extending approximately 16 m north-to-south by 16 m east-to-west,
encompassing approximately 0.02 ha (0.06 ac). Vegetation primarily consisted of short grasses that have
been overgrazed by cattle. The site was delineated based on the distribution of archeological features,
surface artifacts, and negative shovel tests. The site is entirely within the APE.
Ground visibility during the survey ranged from 5 percent due to dense short grass cover to 50 percent as
a result of bank erosion and livestock trampling. The site contained a sparse scatter of bricks
manufactured by the Whiteselle Brick and Lumber Company (1902 to 1981), pieces of fieldstone on the
south bank, and a sherd of unmarked whiteware on the south bank.
During the delineation of site 41ML328, IES investigators excavated seven shovel tests. The soil profile
exposed during shovel testing on the north bank of the site was generally uniform and consisted of dark
brown (10YR 2/1 and 3/1) clay loam with gravel inclusions to a depth of approximately 30 to 40 cmbs.

Shovel tests performed south of the tributary revealed an upper stratum of dark brown (10YR 2/2) clay
loam to 24 cmbs. Beneath this, a stratum of dark brown (10YR 3/2) clay to a depth of 42 cmbs, at which
point sterile subsoil was encountered. All shovel tests were negative for cultural materials.
Features
Feature 1 was a brick-lined well measuring approximately 60 cm in diameter located on the north bank
of the tributary (Appendix A.15, Photographs 04 through 07). The well feature consisted of several
fragmented sections of machine-made bricks and mortar. A few bricks were visibly marked
"WHITSELLE CORSICANA" for the Whiteselle Brick & Lumber Company (1902-1981). The original
well opening was not visible as a result of debris and vegetation cover.
Feature 2 was another brick-lined well observed approximately 11 m southeast of Feature 1 on the south
bank of the tributary (Appendix A.15, Photograph 08). A large, intact fragment of the well collar
indicated the original well opening was over 1 m in diameter. Unlike Feature 1, Feature 2 was composed
of several different brick types as indicated by various brick colors and textures. A few bricks marked
with the Whiteselle Corsicana were observed nearby on the surface. The original well opening of
Features 2 was not visible as a result of debris and vegetation.
Feature 3 was the base remnants of a windmill surrounding Feature 2 (Appendix A.15, Photographs 09
through 12). The remnants included four metal support posts imbedded into the ground at each corner of
the original structure and a metal water pipeline extending from the base to the tributary waters. At the
time of the survey, a pair of mature sugarberry trees were encroaching east and west sides of the feature.
Archival Research
No structures or other indications of the historic occupation of site 41ML328 are evident at this location
on historical maps or aerial photographs. The property is located within the 1,652-ac B. C. Walters
Survey, Abstract 892, patented on 07 April 1853. Using public records provided by the MCCO, a chainof-title for the property was produced to determine potential eligibility under Criterion A and/or B of the
NRHP (Appendix B, Table 8). Based on deed records and site observations, 41ML328 most likely
pertains to the property ownership of the Amthor, Johnson, and Adcock families during the late 19th and
early 20th century. With the exception of the Texas land agent Jacob De Cordova and local farmer
William Amthor (see Section 5.2.1.4), no other names presented within the chain-of-title were listed in
the Handbook of Texas Online, the TxGenWeb Project website, or other history resources.
Site Summary
Site 41ML328 occupied in an area approximately 6 m north-to-south by 16 m east-to-west, encompassing
approximately 0.02 ha (0.06 ac) within the APE. Three features and a sparse surface scatter of brick
fragments (n<50), fieldstone, and whiteware were observed. Site 41ML328 represents a historic-period
well site utilized during the late 19th or early 20th centuries. Seven shovel tests were excavated during
intensive survey and site delineation, none of which yielded cultural materials. The site is entirely within
the APE.
Site 41ML329
Current Investigations
During the IES survey, newly documented multi-component site 41ML329 was encountered within the
APE (Figure 5.19). The site was located on the mid-slope of an interfluvial upland landform. The site
was within an active cattle pasture (Appendix A.16, Photographs 01 through 03). Erosional scarring
was moderate within and surrounding the site. Site 41ML329 was documented within an area extending
approximately 49 m north-to-south by 37 m east-to-west, encompassing approximately 0.37 ha (0.37 ac).
The site was delineated based on the distribution of archeological features, surface artifacts, and negative
shovel tests. The site is entirely within the APE.

Ground surface visibility during the survey was approximately 25 percent. Vegetation within and
surrounding the site included short grasses, cacti, and small woody shrubs. Investigators observed a
moderate scatter of surface artifacts that included brick fragments (including Diamond, Mexia, Whitsell’s
Cherry Reds, and Ferris brands), undecorated whiteware, ironstone, stoneware, porcelain, solarized bottle
glass, solarized pressed glass, white glass canning jar lid inserts, colorless bottle glass, and aqua bottle
glass (Appendix A.16, Photographs 04 through 10). Investigators observed brick stamps represented
four major brick manufactures, which included Ferris Brick Company (1910 to 1923), Diamond Press
Brick Company (1910 to 1923), Mexia Press Brick Company (1919 and 1928), Whiteselle Brick and
Lumber Company of Navarro County (1892 to present). In addition, two undecorated ironstone basal
sherds were encountered (Appendix A.16, Photographs 04 and 07). One fragment was marked
“IRONSTONE” with the top portion of a coat of arms and the other sherd featured “SEMIPORCELAIN,” another term for ironstone. Ironstone was produced mostly in the 19th century with
waning popularity by the beginning of the 20th century (Maryland Archaeological Conservation
Laboratory 2018c). Two chert bifacial thinning flakes were observed on the ground surface in the
western portion of the site. No subsurface artifacts or features were encountered within the site.
During the delineation of site 41ML329, IES investigators excavated eight shovel tests. The soil profile
exposed during shovel testing within the site was generally uniform and consisted of an upper stratum of
very dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) clay loam to a depth of approximately 12 to 36 cmbs with frequent gravel
inclusion. Beneath this stratum, very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/2) clay with frequent gravel inclusions were
encountered. No artifacts were encountered within shovel tests.
Features
Feature 1 was a concrete foundation footer measuring 10 m by 15 m (Appendix A.16, Photographs 11
and 14). The foundation is significantly eroded and missing in several areas. Detached concrete stairs
were located off the southeast corner of the foundation. The stairs were disjointed, and the outer concrete
shell was eroded. Limestone cobbles were located within the stair footprint and were partially exposed
within missing sections of the feature.
Feature 2 was an accumulation of limestone and cobble rubble measuring approximately 5.75 m by 4.5
m. Feature 2 was located approximately 1.5 m north of Feature 1 and likely pertained to an accumulation
of fill relating to a demolished component of the farmstead.
Feature 3 was a group of concrete slabs measuring approximately 3 m by 3 m (Appendix A.16,
Photographs 15 and 17). This feature was located approximately 19 m north of Feature 1. The concrete
slabs consisted of approximately 50 cm side walls with an upper face. The walls and face were
approximately 20 cm thick. The face piece featured lag bolts embedded into the surface. Feature 3
displayed significant signs of deterioration.
Feature 4 was a group of concrete slabs measuring approximately 4 m by 4 m (Appendix A.16,
Photograph 18). This feature was located approximately 21 m northwest of Feature 1. The concrete
slabs were similar to those in Feature 3; however, Feature 4 contained only wall segments with no
adjoining segments or associated hardware.
Archival Research
No structures are indicated at the location of site 41ML329 on the 1936 McLennan County highway map;
however, several structures are evident at the location on 1941 aerial photographs. Site 41ML329 is
located within the 1,652-ac B. C. Walters Survey, Abstract 892, patented on 07 April 1853. Using public
records provided by the MCCO, a chain-of-title for the property was produced to determine potential
eligibility under Criterion A and/or B of the NRHP (Appendix B, Table 7). Based on deed records and
site observations, 41ML329 most likely pertains to the property ownership of the Amthor and Horstmann
families in the late 19th and early 20th century. With the exception of the Texas land agent Jacob De
Cordova and local farmer William Amthor (see Section 5.2.1.4), no other names presented within the

history resources.
Site Summary
Site 41ML329 represents a historic-period farmstead occupied during the late 19th or early 20th century by
the Amthor and Horstmann families in an area once habited by prehistoric peoples. The site occupied in
an area approximately 49 m north-to-south by 37 m east-to-west, encompassing approximately 0.37 ha
(0.37 ac) within the APE. Eight shovel tests were excavated during intensive survey and site delineation,
none of which yielded cultural materials. Four archeological features and a sparse to moderate surface
scatter of domestic debris were observed. Additionally, a prehistoric component was represented by two
biface thinning flakes. The site is entirely within the APE.
Site 41ML330
Current Investigations
During the IES survey, newly documented historical-period site 41ML330 was encountered within the
APE (Figure 5.20). The site was located on a gently-undulating interfluvial upland landform bordering
an unnamed tributary of South Bosque River. The site was within an active cattle pasture (Appendix
A.17, Photographs 01 through 03). At the time of field survey, the area within and surrounding the site
boundary was utilized as a livestock transportation staging area, resulting in significant trampling and
pugging across the western half of the site. Site 41ML330 was documented within an area extending
approximately 64 m north-to-south by 66 m east-to-west, encompassing approximately 0.26 ha (0.64 ac).
The site was delineated based on the distribution of archeological features, surface artifacts, negative
shovel tests, and observed disturbances. The site is entirely within the APE.
Ground surface visibility during the survey was approximately 0 to 25 percent. Vegetation within and
surrounding the site included short grasses, cacti, small woody shrubs, and mesquite trees. Investigators
observed minimal surface artifacts that included farm-related scrap metal, a cast iron stove door marked
“BAIN 10,” a mule shoe, ceramics (whiteware [n=4], annular banded yellow ware, porcelain, Bristol slipglazed stoneware [n=2]), unmarked bottle glass shards (solarized, cobalt blue, aqua, amber), a milk glass
beer bottle shard, clear glass bottle base marked for Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. (ca. 1923-1982), brick and
brick fragments (Appendix A.17, Photographs 04 through 06). One brick featured the stamp of the
Whiteselle Brick and Lumber Company (1902 to 1968). One whiteware sherd featured a molded floral
design. A ceramic rim sherd featuring a yellowish-buff paste, a white slip band around the rim, and a
clear glaze was identified as yellow ware, which was produced mainly during the 19th century and early
20th century (Maryland Archaeological Conservation Laboratory 2018d). No subsurface artifacts or
features were encountered within the site.
During the delineation of site 41ML330, IES investigators excavated eight shovel tests. The soil profile
exposed during shovel testing within the site was generally uniform and consisted of an upper stratum of
black (10YR 2/2) clay loam to a depth of approximately 5 to 10 cmbs with frequent gravel inclusion.
Beneath this stratum, very dark, grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay with frequent gravel inclusions were
encountered. No artifacts were encountered within shovel tests.
Features
Feature 1 was a group of concrete slabs measuring approximately 8 m by 6 m (Appendix A.17,
Photographs 07 through 11). This feature was generally located within the central portion of the site.
The concrete slabs consisted of five, approximately 50 cm tall side walls, that averaged 1.75 m long.
Additional smaller concrete chunks littered the concrete slabs. The concrete slabs displayed significant
signs of deterioration.

Site 41ML331
Current Investigations
During the IES survey, a newly recorded historic-period site was encountered within the APE (Figure
5.21). Site 41ML331 was documented within an area extending approximately 4.5 m north-to-south by
4.5 m east-to-west. The site was located in a gently sloping upland setting approximately 80 m east of an
unnamed tributary of South Bosque River. Vegetation primarily consisted of short grasses. The site was
delineated based on negative shovel tests. The site is entirely within the APE.
The soil profile exposed during shovel testing, south of the fence line, was generally uniform and revealed
an upper stratum of dark brown (10YR 2/2) clay loam to 24 cmbs. Beneath this, a stratum of dark brown
(10YR 3/2) clay to a depth of 42 cmbs, at which point compact or sterile subsoil was encountered. Soils
encountered in shovel tests north of the fence were characterized by dark yellowish-brown (7.5YR 2.5/2)
clay or clay loam to an average depth of 30 cmbs. No shovel tests were positive for cultural materials.
During the delineation of site 41ML331, IES investigators excavated eight shovel tests. Ground visibility
during the survey ranged from 0 to 35 percent as a result of short grass cover and livestock trampling. No
artifacts were observed on the surface of the site.
Features
Feature 1 was a brick and mortar well measuring approximately 75 cm in diameter (Appendix A.18,
Photographs 01 through 05). The well feature was located on a slope east of an unnamed tributary and
south of an adjacent fence line. The well collar featured machine-made bricks set in mortar. Several
bricks were marked “GROESBECK REDS,” which were produced by the Groesbeck Brick Company,
Groesbeck Standard Brick Company, and the Barron Brick Company from the 1910s to the 1970s. The
above-ground portion of the well has been fragmented and loose bricks were observed around the feature.
A metal ring and lid were observed a few feet away and appeared to have been part of the well.

Site 41ML332
Current Investigations
During the IES survey, a newly recorded historic-period site was encountered within the APE (Figure
5.22). The site was located on the southern bank of an unnamed tributary of the South Bosque River in
the northwestern quadrant of the APE (Appendix A.19, Photographs 01 through 06). Site 41ML332
was documented within an area extending approximately 13 m north-to-south by 20 m east-to-west,
encompassing approximately 0.02 ha (0.04 ac). Vegetation primarily consisted of short grasses that have
been frequently grazed. The site was delineated based on the distribution of surface artifacts, negative
shovel tests, observed disturbances, and topographic features. The site is entirely within the APE.
Ground visibility during the survey was 30 percent due to the moderately dense short grass cover and
livestock trampling. The site was characterized by a surface scatter of historic-aged artifacts (Appendix
A.19, Photograph 07). The observed artifact assemblage included a shard of clear bottle glass embossed
with “CS OK O,” a pressed clear glass shard, a piece of clear lamp glass, solarized glass (n=3), an aqua
colored rim shard of a canning jar, whiteware sherds (n=3), a molded porcelain rim sherd, and stoneware
sherds with a Bristol slip glaze (n=2). Investigators recorded another stoneware sherd at 5 to 10 cmbs in
the cutbank of the unnamed tributary.
During the delineation of site 41ML332, IES investigators excavated six shovel tests. The soil profile
exposed during shovel testing within the site was generally uniform and consisted of a dark brown (10YR
2/2 and 3/2) clay loam. Shovel tests were terminated at an average depth of 40 cmbs as a result of

dating to the early 20th century. Six shovel tests were excavated during intensive survey and site
delineation, none of which yielded cultural materials. The site is entirely within the APE.
Site 41ML333
Current Investigations
During the IES survey, previously undocumented historical-period site 41ML333 was encountered within
the APE (Figure 5.23). The site was located on a poorly-drained, gently-undulating, interfluvial upland
landform (Appendix A.20, Photograph 01). The area within and surrounding the site was heavily
trampled and saturated at the time of the survey. Site 41ML333 was documented within an area
extending approximately 110 m north-to-south by 67 m east-to-west, encompassing approximately 0.5 ha
(1.23 ac). A drainage feature is located approximate 27 m east of the site boundary, while an unnamed
tributary of the South Bosque River flows eastward approximately 102 m north of the site. The site was
delineated based on the distribution of surface artifacts, negative shovel tests, and natural landscape
features. The site is entirely within the APE.
Ground visibility during the survey was 25 percent due to the moderately dense short grass cover and
livestock trampling. Investigators observed a low-density artifact scatter that included glass (colorless,
solarized, and amber bottle glass), undecorated whiteware (including a perforated ceramic jar lid), hand
tools (adjustable wrench, crescent wrench), and a metal lever (Appendix A.20, Photographs 02 through
07). One jar base shard of clear glass was identified as being manufactured by the Owens-Illinois Glass
Company (1929 to late 1950s). A second jar base shard of clear glass was manufactured by the ObearNestor Glass Company, East St. Louis, Illinois (1894 to 1978) and featured an additional partial
“. . . EPPER . . .” mark. One sherd of whiteware featured a partial faded “. . .LANO” makers mark.
During the delineation of site 41ML333, IES investigators excavated nine shovel tests. The soil profile
exposed during shovel testing within the site was generally uniform and consisted of an upper stratum of
dark brown (10YR 3/2) clay loam to yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy clay loam to a depth of
approximately 10 cmbs. Beneath this, a stratum of very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/2) clay to a depth of 15
cmbs, at which point bedrock was encountered. No shovel tests were positive for cultural materials.
Archival Research
No structures or other indications of the historic occupation of site 41ML333 are evident at this location
on historical maps or aerial photographs. The property is located within the 4,605-ac Jesse Russell
Survey, Abstract 743, patented on 07 November 1854. Using public records provided by the MCCO, a
chain-of-title for the property was produced to determine potential eligibility under Criterion A and/or B
of the NRHP (Appendix B, Tables 12 and 13). The site was near the dividing line between 38-ac and
85-ac tracts once part of the 112-ac Prock tract. When W. E. Crews conveyed the 38-ac tract (eastern
portion of Prock tract) to his in-laws A. J. Sewell and Kate Sewell in 1912 (Deed Record Volume 281,
Page 457), the western boundary line was made “crooked.” A deed call for the property states “Thence N
29 E 75 varas to an iron pin in line with West edge of barn.” This barn would have been located within or
near site 41ML333. Based on field observations and deed records, site 41ML333 most likely pertains to
the ownership of the Orand, Crews, Sewell, and Fisk families. None of the names presented within the
chain-of-title were listed in the Handbook of Texas Online, the TxGenWeb Project website, or local
history volumes.

Site Summary
Site 41ML333 was located in an area approximately 110 m north-to-south by 67 m east-to-west,
encompassing approximately 0.5 ha (1.23 ac) within the APE. The site was a low density historic-period
artifact surface scatter of domestic and agricultural related items. Site 41ML333 represents a historicperiod farmstead occupied during the late 19th or early 20th centuries. Nine shovel tests were excavated
during intensive survey and site delineation. No shovel tests were positive for cultural materials. The site
is entirely within the APE.
Site 41ML334
Current Investigations
During the IES survey, previously undocumented historic-period site 41ML334 was encountered within
the APE (Figure 5.24). The site was located on the gently-sloping banks of a saturated drainage feature
(Appendix A.21, Photographs 01 through 04). Two trees and a scattering of cut wood was located
within the site. Standing water was present within the drainage feature at the time of survey. Site
41ML334 was documented within an area extending approximately 32 m north-to-south by 15 m east-towest, encompassing approximately 0.03 ha (0.08 ac). The site was delineated based on the distribution of
surface artifacts, positive and negative shovel tests, and observed disturbances. The site is entirely within
the APE.
Ground visibility during the survey was 50 percent due to the moderately dense short grass cover.
Investigators observed a low-density scatter of limestone and concrete chunks, a metal mattress spring, a
metal lever, another lever made of opaque white glass, milk glass jar lids (n=3), clear glass bottle base
shards (n=2), solarized pressed glass bottle shards (n=2), a plain solarized glass bottle shard, a cobalt blue
shard of glass, aqua colored glass (n=2), an undecorated porcelain sherd, a molded whiteware handle
fragment, a whiteware sherd with a decal pattern, stoneware sherds (n=4), and a few brick fragments
(Appendix A.21, Photographs 05 through 12). Brick fragments featuring the “ALB” stamp originally
identified (Appendix A.21, Photograph 10). These were manufactured by A. L. Branson in Marlin,
Texas between 1890 and 1936.
A dark purple glass shard was found on the surface. The basal fragment featured a pressed starburst
pattern. Because of the rarity of non-solarized amethyst or dark purple glass bottles, the shard likely dates
to the second half of the 19th century (Lindsey 2018). The site also contained an intact oval-shaped green
bottle with a screw top measuring 3 in tall. The bottle base is embossed with “DES. PAT. 9 21 48,”
indicating a patent date of 21 September 1948. Another colorless round glass bottle measured 4 in tall.
The bottle does not have a maker’s mark but has vertical machine mold seams extending from the base to
the closure. As such, the bottle likely dates to the 20th century.
The site also contained four sherds of pearlware. A rim sherd featured a feather pattern edge with a dark
blue glaze. The interior of the sherd was covered in a white glaze slightly tinted with cobalt blue. The
remaining sherds featured various shades of blue tinted glaze. The clay body of the sherds were either
buff colored or a light gray. Pearlware was mostly produced during the 19th century and was replaced by
whiteware by the late 19th century (Esary 1982).
During the delineation of site 41ML334, IES investigators excavated nine shovel tests. The soil profile
exposed during shovel testing within the site was generally uniform and consisted of an upper stratum of
compact dark brown (10YR 3/3) to black (10YR 2/1) clay to a depth of approximately 30 cmbs. Beneath
this, bedrock was encountered. Shovel Test OT1 was positive for cultural materials, which included
coarse earthenware (n=1), undecorated whiteware (n=1), pearlware (n=1), clear window glass (n=1),
amber bottle glass (n=1), and scrap metal (n=2) to depths of 20 cmbs (Appendix A.21, Photographs 11
and 12).

No structures or other indications of the historic occupation of site 41ML334 are evident at this location
on historical maps or aerial photographs. The property is located within the 640-ac J. L. Johnson Survey,
Abstract 484, patented on 09 February 1850. Using public records provided by the MCCO, a chain-oftitle for the property was produced to determine potential eligibility under Criterion A and/or B of the
NRHP (Appendix B, Table 1). None of the names presented within the chain-of-title were listed in the
Handbook of Texas Online, the TxGenWeb Project website, or local history volumes.
Site Summary
Site 41ML334 was located in an area approximately 32 m north-to-south by 15 m east-to-west,
encompassing approximately 0.03 ha (0.08 ac) within the APE. The site was a low density historicperiod artifact surface scatter of limestone and concrete chunks, clear bottle glass, undecorated whiteware,
pearlware, stoneware, scrap metal, mattress wire frame, and amber glass. Site 41ML334 represents a
historic-period trash dump dating to the 19th and 20th century. Nine shovel tests were excavated during
intensive survey and site delineation, one of which contained cultural material representative of the
surface scatter to a depth of 20 cmbs. The site is entirely within the APE.
Site 41ML335
Current Investigations
During the IES survey, previously undocumented historic-period site 41ML335 was encountered within
the APE (Figure 5.25). The site was located on a gently-undulating, interfluvial upland landform
(Appendix A.22, Photographs 01 through 02). Site 41ML335 was documented within an area extending
approximately 29 m north-to-south by 69 m east-to-west, encompassing approximately 0.13 ha (0.32 ac).
The site was delineated based on the distribution of surface artifacts and negative shovel tests. The site is
entirely within the APE.
Ground visibility during the survey was 25 percent due to the moderately dense short grass. Investigators
observed a low-density artifact scatter that included undecorated whiteware (n=22), colorless bottle glass
(n=26), solarized bottle glass (n=4), stoneware (n=1; Bristol slip glazed exterior with Albany slipped
interior), machine-made brick fragments (n=13), and a square spike (Appendix A.22, Photographs 03
through 07).
During the delineation of site 41ML335, IES investigators excavated 12 shovel tests. The soil profile
exposed during shovel testing within the site was generally uniform and consisted of an upper stratum of
brown (10YR 4/3) to yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy clay to a depth of approximately 10 to 20 cmbs.
Beneath this, bedrock was encountered. No shovel tests were positive for cultural materials.
Archival Research
No structures are indicated at the location of site 41ML329 on the 1936 McLennan County highway map;
however, a structure is evident near the location on 1941 aerial photographs. The property is located
within the 640-ac J. L. Johnson Survey, Abstract 484, patented on 09 February 1850. Using public
records provided by the MCCO, a chain-of-title for the property was produced to determine potential
eligibility under Criterion A and/or B of the NRHP (Appendix B, Table 1). None of the names presented
within the chain-of-title were listed in the Handbook of Texas Online, the TxGenWeb Project website, or
local history volumes.
Site Summary
41ML335 was located in an area approximately 29 m north-to-south by 69 m east-to-west, encompassing
approximately 0.13 ha (0.32 ac) within the APE. The site was a low-density historic-period artifact
surface scatter of whiteware, stoneware, solarized glass, colorless glass, brick fragments, and scrap metal.

which contained artifacts. The site is located entirely within the APE.
Site 41ML336
Current Investigations
During the IES survey, previously undocumented historic-period site 41ML336 was encountered within
the APE (Figure 5.26). The site was located within a gently-undulating interfluvial upland (Appendix
A.23, Photographs 01 through 03). The former alignment of a service road borders the northern portion
of the site and a sanitary sewer pipeline easement bisects the northern portion of the site. 41ML336 was
documented within an area extending approximately 100 m north-to-south by 72 m east-to-west,
encompassing approximately 0.31 ha (0.77 ac). The site was delineated based on the distribution of
surface artifacts, negative shovel tests, and observed disturbances. The site is entirely within the APE.
Ground surface visibility during the surface was 0 to 30 percent within and surrounding the site.
Vegetation included short grasses, cacti, and small woody shrubbery. Investigators observed sparse
surface artifact scatters containing brick and brick fragments (n=10), glass (amber bottle glass [n=1],
cobalt [n=1], clear bottle glass [n=2], pink/rose bottle glass [n=1], solarized bottle glass [n=1]), iron
piping (n=1), steel sheeting (n=4), and ceramics (undecorated whiteware [n=6], stoneware [n=2]) within
the site boundary. Five brick fragments contained a stamp of the Whiteselle Brick and Lumber Company
that produced “Whiteselle Cherry Reds Corsicana” bricks between 1902 and 1968. An additional brick
featured a “GROESSBECK REDS” manufactured by the Barron Brick Company (1957 to 1972). No
other surface or subsurface artifacts were encountered at site 41ML336.
During the delineation of site 41ML336, IES investigators excavated seven shovel tests. The soil profile
exposed during shovel testing within the site consisted of an upper stratum that contained very dark,
grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay loam to a depth ranging from 10 to 24 cmbs. This stratum was underlaid
by a layer of black (10YR 2/2) clay with frequent gravel inclusions to depths of 24 to 40 cmbs. Beneath
this, regolith was encounter. No shovel tests were positive for cultural materials.
Archival Research
No structures are indicated at the location of site 41ML336 on the 1936 McLennan County highway map;
however, a structure is evident near the location on 1941 aerial photographs. The property is located
within the 4,605-ac Jesse Russell Survey, Abstract 743, patented on 07 November 1854. Using public
records provided by the MCCO, a chain-of-title for the property was produced to determine potential
eligibility under Criterion A and/or B of the NRHP (Appendix B, Table 11). The site was near the
former location of a homestead identified in deed records. In Deed Record Volume 39, Page 134, an area
measuring 51.84 square varas (144 square ft) containing a house was included in the conveyance from L.
D. Spight and M. N. Spight to M. J. Jones in 1880. The home of M. J. Jones is briefly mentioned in
subsequent deed calls for the property and adjacent tract. Based on field observations and deed records,
site 41ML336 most likely pertains to the ownership of the Spight, Jones, and Patterson families. None of
the names presented within the chain-of-title were listed in the Handbook of Texas Online, the
TxGenWeb Project website, or local history volumes.
Site Summary
Site 41ML336 occupied an area approximately 100 m north-to-south by 72 m east-to-west, encompassing
approximately 0.31 ha (0.77 ac) within the APE. Seven shovel tests were excavated during intensive
survey and site delineation, none of which yielded cultural materials. A sparse surface scatter of brick
and brick fragments, glass, steel sheeting, and ceramics were observed. Site 41ML336 represents a
historic-period farmstead occupied during the late 19th and early 20th centuries primarily by the Spight,
Jones, and Patterson families. The site is located entirely within the APE.

Site 41ML337
Current Investigations
During the IES survey, newly documented historic-period site 41ML337 was encountered within the APE
(Figure 5.27). The site was located on the toe slope of a low interfluvial terrace bordering the South
Bosque River stream terrace. The site was within an active cattle pasture and has been heavily trampled.
Erosional scarring was moderate north of the site as the site bordered a higher landform terrace. Site
41ML337 was documented within an area extending approximately 46 m northwest-to-southeast by 128
m northeast-to-southwest, encompassing approximately 0.44 ha (1.09 ac). The site was delineated based
on the distribution of archeological features, surface artifact distribution, negative shovel tests, and
observed disturbances. The site is entirely within the APE.
Ground surface visibility within the site area was nearly 100 percent during the survey due to active
livestock grazing. Vegetation within and surrounding the site was minimal and included short grasses
with sporadic trees. Investigators observed a moderate scatter of surface artifacts that consisted entirely
of brick fragments manufactured by the Ferris Brick Company (1910 to 1923). No subsurface artifacts or
features were encountered within the site.
During the delineation of site 41ML337, IES investigators excavated five shovel tests. The soil profile
exposed during shovel testing within the site was generally uniform and consisted of an upper stratum of
very dark brown (10YR 3/2) clay loam on the lower land forms and a dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4)
sandy clay on the upper landforms to depths of 35 cmbs. Beneath this stratum, bedrock was encountered.
Both landforms featured frequent limestone gravel inclusions. No artifacts were encountered within
shovel tests.
Features
Feature 1 was a raised concrete foundation measuring approximately 18 m by 16 m (Appendix A.23,
Photographs 1 and 6). The foundation was raised approximately 10 to 20 cm above the ground surface
with numerous anchor bolts embedded within its surface. The foundation served as one of two auxiliary
fire stations constructed between 1941 and 1952 to service the Bluebonnet Ordnance Plant. The
foundation featured a large western room with three smaller adjoining rooms to the east and southeast. A
partially buried cement walkway/porch was observed abutting the western façade. The southeastern-most
room featured a brick scatter and a partially articulated, collapsed chimney. Numerous metal pipes
protruded from the ground surface within and directly surrounding the foundation (Appendix A.23,
Photographs 7 and 8).
Feature 2 was a concrete foundation with raised footers measuring approximately 10 m by 50 m located
approximately 53 m west by northwest of Feature 1 (Appendix A.23, Photographs 9 and 13). The
foundation footers were raised approximately 15 cm above the ground surface and featured numerous
anchor bolts. Portions of the feature were heavily eroded and segmented. The foundation pertained to
horse stables erected between 1947 and 1956 when ownership of the property was transferred to the
Texas Agricultural and Mechanical College (Texas A&M) system.
Feature 3 was an ancillary concrete enclosure measuring approximately 1.5 m by 1 m located
approximately 53 m northwest of Feature 1 (Appendix A.23, Photographs 14 and 15). The walls and
roof of the concrete enclosure were approximately 12 in thick. The northwestern face of the enclosure is
open and features five anchor bolts protruding from the face. The enclosure is located on the side of a
slight slope that featured significant limestone cobble ground coverage. Six telephone poles, one of
which was fallen, circumscribed the northwestern and southwestern facades. The precise function of this
enclosure is unknown; however, it serviced the auxiliary fire station in some manner.

The property is located within the 913-ac A. A. Lewis Survey, Abstract 534, patented on 11 June 1852,
and the 320-ac S. S. Sherman Survey, Abstract 797, patented on 01 June 1846. Using public records
provided by the MCCO, a chain-of-title for the property was produced to determine potential eligibility
under Criterion A and/or B of the NRHP (Appendix B, Table 15). Site 41ML337 was mentioned
specifically in environmental documentation included on page 11 of Official Public Record (OPR)
2002003359. The document states a fire station and stables were located on Transfer Parcel Number 8.
The author(s) of the OPR concluded that the structures were most likely constructed in 1942 and
demolished around 1978. Background research conducted by IES using historic aerial photographs verify
this date range.
Site Summary
Site 41ML337 was located in an area approximately 46 m northwest-to-southeast by 128 m northeast-tosouthwest, encompassing approximately 0.44 ha (1.09 ac) within the APE. Five shovel tests were
excavated during intensive survey and site delineation, none of which yielded cultural materials. Three
archeological features and a moderate surface scatter of Ferris-stamped bricks and brick fragments were
observed. Site 41ML337 represents the historic-period site pertaining to the early to mid-1940s operation
of the Bluebonnet Ordnance Plant and the 1947 to 1956 ownership of the property by the Texas A&M
system. The site is entirely within the APE.

5.3 Architectural Resources Assessment
Through coordination with the THC History Program and Architecture Divisions, concern was raised
regarding potential indirect effects to above ground architectural elements of the former NWIRP facility if
Section 106 compliance was required. In response, IES coordinated with project engineers to identify if
the project would require federal funding or permitting required for the project. As previously identified
in this report, two WOUS impact areas were identified by IES biologists that would require permitting
from the USACE under the NWP program. Subsequently, to satisfy Section 106 requirements for the
three NWP areas, an indirect APE was developed that incorporated that assessed a 100-ft-wide area
surrounding each NWP area. The indirect APE was designed to include the maximum distance any
adverse visual impacts associated with the proposed road construction and improvement could occur.
Through the assessment of the indirect APE, no architectural resources were identified within the indirect
APE.
However, during initial background research, an ancillary building associated with the former NWIRP
facility was identified directly adjacent to the northwestern corner of the APE. In addition, it was
discovered that this architectural component of the former Bluebonnet Ordnance Plant had not been
previously documented as part of the 1995 historic resources survey and assessment (Malanka et al. 1996)
prior to the property transfer from the Navy to the City of McGregor. Although the building was outside
the three identified NWP indirect APEs for the current proposed industrial park, IES informed the THC
that the resource would be documented as a due diligence and good faith effort by McGregor to update
the agency’s records regarding the remaining architectural components of the Bluebonnet Ordnance Plant.
In response, a limited architectural reconnaissance survey was conducted for the identified building
located southeast of the intersection of Bluebonnet Parkway and McGuffey Road. During the survey, one
architectural resource (AR) was identified (Figure 5.28). The existing conditions and architectural
characteristics of Architectural Resource 1 (AR-1) are summarized in this chapter (Table 5.3).
Representative photographs of the resource are provided within Appendix A.25.

AR-1 is an example of a water well pump house building associated with the former Bluebonnet Ordnance
Plant. During the 1995 historic resources survey and assessment, four similar buildings were identified,
documented, and evaluated within the NWIRP property; however, AR-1 was not included in the survey
and was subsequently not evaluated (Malanka et al. 1996). AR-1 is located near the NWIRP Area C,
which served as the Safety and Security Area of the former Bluebonnet Ordnance Plant and NWIRP
facilities. AR-1 is one of at least five extant pump houses within the former NWIRP property. This
structure is currently vacant and no longer in use. The immediate area surrounding the pump house is
characterized as rural, with adjacent livestock pastures enclosed by barbed wire fences. The industrial
areas of the NWIRP are located to the west, while to the north, is the Administration Area. AR-1 is a
small, 1-story rectangular plan brick building on a concrete slab foundation (see Appendix A.25;
Photographs 01 through 06). The exterior walls consist of brick laid in five-course common bond.
The entrance to the structure faces southwest with wood siding inset above the doors. The building is
missing the original double wood panel entrance doors. The building has one 2/2, horizontally-aligned,
double-hung metal window on its southeast and northwest sides. Each window has concrete lintels and
sills. The rear of the structure has a large wood horizontal slat vent, which has been covered on the
interior with plywood. The pump house features a built-up tar-and-gravel shed roof with wood around
the cornice. In addition, a cylinder-shaped metal ventilator is located on the roof. During the mid1950s, AR-1, along with the other water treatment facilities at the plant, underwent minor rehabilitation;
however, these alterations appear to be minimal.

CHAPTER 6: SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.1 Archeological Resources
During the intensive pedestrian survey, 654 survey shovel tests were excavated within the 851-ha (2,104ac) APE. An additional 200 shovel tests were excavated during delineation of the archeological sites
encountered during the survey. Through the survey, 11 previously documented archeological sites were
revisited and 12 newly recorded archeological sites were encountered. Summaries of the 23 archeological
resources encountered and NRHP/SAL eligibility recommendations are provided within this chapter and
within Table 6.1. IES considers 100 percent of the direct APE to be fully assessed for archeological
resources at this time and recommends that no further work is warranted.

41ML113 represents a previously recorded historic-period farmstead occupied during the early 20th
century. During the IES site revisit, four archeological features and a sparse surface scatter of brick
fragments and concrete chunks were observed. All structures once present at the site have been
demolished and the contextual integrity of the site has been severely compromised. The site does not
retain sufficient data to contribute important information regarding community development in
McLennan County or the greater region during the early 20th century. As such, site 41ML113 is
considered to have little research potential and is not likely to yield any additional information
relevant to understanding the historic period within the region. Due to the lack of association with a
significant historical event(s) or person(s), the lack of important architectural features, and the low
potential to yield significant archeological data, site 41ML113 does not meet NRHP significance
standards under Criteria A, B, C, or D. The site was located entirely within the APE. Thus, it is
recommended that the site is not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under the criteria enumerated in
36 CFR 60.4. Subsequently, the site is not eligible for SAL designation.
41ML239 represents a previously recorded multi-component site comprised of a historic-period
farmstead occupied during the late 19th and early 20th centuries and a minor prehistoric component.
The brick-lined well feature that was observed at the site in 1995 has been obscured by modern land
use and was not identified during the current survey. During the IES site revisit, a sparse prehistoric
component of the site comingled with the historic-period component was identified. The two
historic-period archeological features observed at the site are highly fragmentary and yield little
indication of the plan or layout of the original structures or the farmstead of which they are a part. All
structures once present at the site have been demolished and the contextual integrity of the site has
been severely compromised. The site does not retain sufficient data to contribute important
information regarding community development in McLennan County or the greater region during the
late 19th or early 20th centuries. As such, site 41ML239 is considered to have little research potential
and is not likely to yield any additional information relevant to understanding the prehistoric or
historic periods within the region. Due to the lack of association with a significant historical event(s)
or person(s), the lack of important architectural features, and the low potential to yield significant
archeological data, site 41ML239 does not meet NRHP significance standards under Criteria A, B, C,
or D. The site was partially located within the APE. Thus, it is recommended that the portion of
41ML329 within the APE is not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under the criteria enumerated in
36 CFR 60.4. Subsequently, the site is not eligible for SAL designation.
41ML240 represents a previously recorded historic-period farmstead established between 1887 and 1893,
and subsequently occupied by renters or tenant farmers until 1942. During the IES site revisit, two
archeological features and a sparse surface scatter of brick fragments and domestic artifacts were
observed. All structures once present at the site have been demolished and the contextual integrity of
the site has been severely compromised. The site does not retain sufficient data to contribute
important information regarding community development in McLennan County or the greater region
during the late 19th or early 20th centuries. As such, site 41ML240 is considered to have little research
potential and is not likely to yield any additional information relevant to understanding the historic
period within the region. Due to the lack of association with a significant historical event(s) or
person(s), the lack of important architectural features, and the low potential to yield significant

41ML240 within the APE is not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under the criteria enumerated in
36 CFR 60.4. Subsequently, the site is not eligible for SAL designation.
41ML241 represents a previously recorded historic-period farmstead established in the early 20th century
and occupied by later owners or tenants until acquisition by the U.S. government in 1942. During the
IES site revisit, three features and a sparse surface artifact scatter of brick fragments and domestic
artifacts were observed at the site. The historic-period archeological features observed at the site are

6.2 Architectural Resources
To comply with Section 106 requirements for this project a 100-ft-wide area surrounding three NWP
areas were evaluated for potential indirect visual impacts associated with the construct of new roadway
and roadway improvements on historic-age above ground architectural resources. During the
reconnaissance survey, no architectural resource were encountered. IES considers 100 percent of the
indirect APE to be fully assessed for above ground resources at this time. No further work warranted.
However, as previously described within this report, IES conducted a due diligence evaluation of one
above ground architectural resource that was outside the direct and indirect APE for the proposed
industrial park project. The documented architectural resource and its NRHP/SAL eligibility
recommendation are described within this chapter and are summarized within Table 6.2.
AR 1 is a single-story water well pump house constructed in 1942. Although the water well pump house
has retained a high degree of architectural integrity, the building does not contain distinctive
characteristics of design or construction. In addition, although the building is associated with the
former Bluebonnet Ordnance Plant, the building represents an ancillary maintenance building within
facility and lacks significance. Subsequently, this resource is considered not eligible for inclusion in
the NRHP under Criteria A, B, and C as enumerated in 36 CFR 60.4.

6.3 Recommendations
It is the recommendation of IES that the THC concur with the NRHP/SAL recommendations presented
within this report. IES recommends that the proposed McGregor Mega Site Industrial Park and any
subsequent construction within the APE be allowed to proceed as planned without further archeological
investigations or THC coordination. It is the recommendation of IES that if future projects occur within
the APE, and require a NWP from the USACE, that the THC be consulted to evaluate potential indirect
impacts to extant buildings and structures associated with the former Bluebonnet Ordinance Plant.
If any cultural resources (other than those detailed within this report) are encountered during construction,
the operators should immediately stop construction activities in the area of the inadvertent discovery. The
project cultural resources consultant should then be contacted to initiate further consultation with the
THC/SHPO prior to resuming construction activities. In addition, if project designs change, and areas
outside the APE detailed within this report are to be impacted, additional field investigations may be
required.
