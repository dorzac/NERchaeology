ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
This volume was initiated at the urging of Fred Limp,
Arkansas Archeological Survey, as part of the massive
effort to produce what became the 14 volume report
series known as the Southwestern Division Cultural
Resources Overview for the Corps of Engineers.
Funding restrictions on the series jeopardized
publication of this unbudgeted report on lithic resources.
Don Wyckoff, who had reviewed the report earlier,
subsequently made a presentation for publication to the
Board of Directors of the Oklahoma Anthropological
Society. They approved publication as a Society Memoir
but stipulated the volume should have color plates of
specific quarry source materials and an appendix of more
detailed descriptions of chert types. This report is the
culmination of some 25 years of effort that included
notable contributions from numerous individuals.
It is amazing how a seemingly simple task of writing
acknowledgments can be so difficult, but I consider this
task a very important part of this volume. Although much
of my life has been spent studying chert sources, little of
the knowledge presented herein originated from me.
Especially over the past 25 years many individuals have
inspired and motivated me to continue this research
interest. It is an honor to recognize these people at this
time.
First and foremost I express my deepest appreciation
for the indulgence of my wife Billie and my family while I
compiled and prepared this study. Early in life my
parents, Mildred and the late Weldon Banks encouraged
my interests in many subjects, including geology and
rocks. During my adolescent and teenage years the late
Frank Howell and Irene Howell of Grapevine, Texas,
also had a primary influence on my interests. Since 1959,
Jack Hughes has been my sounding board on lithic
sources and identification problems; consequently a
simple thanks is hardly appropriate but it is most sincere.
In the late 1960s, Gregory Perino began urging me to
prepare a report on chert sources in the Ouachita
Mountains. Dr. Robert E. Bell stimulated and motivated
my preparation of a chapter on lithic resources in his
volume Prehistory of Oklahoma. Waldo Wedel and
Dennis Stanford were responsible for my current
contributions to Smithsonian Institution projects, and
personnel (Cheryl Smith, now in the Baltimore District,
and Karen Scott) at the Tulsa and Fort Worth districts of
the Corps of Engineers requested specific assistance with
chert studies at the Clayton and Cooper lakes projects.
Although the Corps of Engineers provided
institutional support and some of my time when regular

v

duties allowed, this report was prepared without financial
support from any source.
Most of the effort was performed on personal time at
home and in the Fort Worth Public Library where I often
received valuable assistance from Sally McCoy. While
relying heavily on published geological and archeological
reports, I also obtained useful unpublished information
from numerous respected individuals. In many instances
that information has been in the form of personal
communications; hence the more than usual number of
such citations in the text. Among those cited, Joe B.
Winters, Robert Mallouf, Carroll Kleinhans, Robert F.
"Skipper" Scott III, Dennis Stanford, Timothy Kearns,
WilliruL Purves, and Mark Sholes were especially helpful.
Robert Mallouf, William Purves, Mark Sholes, and Roger
Bowers graciously provided me with copies of their
theses and dissertations.
Skipper Scott, Bob Mallouf, Curtis Tunnell, Don
Wyckoff, and Roger Bowers reviewed earlier draft copies
and provided much needed comments. This final version
benefited immeasurably from those reviews. Roger
Bowers served as an editor more than simply providing
review comments. Mary Lynn Kennedy, Arkansas
Archeological Survey, did edit the earlier draft that was
to have been published by the Arkansas Survey. At the
Oklahoma Archeological Survey, Bob Brooks, Francie
Gettys, Jane Merritt, and Don Wyckoff helped edit and
format this version for publication, and Julie Rachel
unenviably labored to transform my rough maps into
meaningful illustrations. Janie Kellet (Arkansas
Archeological Survey) produced several of the black and
white figures from colored slides.
My Corps of Engineers supervisors, especially Walt
Gallaher and Harold Green, assisted in this work in
several important ways. Barry Rought encouraged my
research efforts in professional studies for Corps-related
projects. These people's support is very much
appreciated. The Information Management Office of the
Southwestern Division made a portable computer
available for this and other Corps-related reports prior to
my purchase of my own computer. I thank the people in
that office and especially Max Thompson, Martha
Lindberg, Jim Cates, and Pete LaFlamme for their
assistance. Now it is difficult to understand how I
managed to produce anything in the past without access
to a word processing system.
Numerous individuals are named herein as personal
communicators for specific geographic areas, but many
others are not specifically referenced. To these latter my

appreciation is as great as for those mentioned
specifically. For the sake of brevity I simply list those
who are 'due acknowledgement for their assistance and

INTRODUCTION
Obtaining raw materials for production of stone tools
has been an economic need for every group of people
throughout the span of human prehistory. Consequently,
lithic materials had no equal in importance as an
inorganic natural resource shared by all prehistoric
cultures in any given area. Unlike recent achievements in
research and replication pertaining to lithic technology,
the precision of identification for lithic sources has
substantial shortcomings. Current knowledge has hardly
crossed the threshold in understanding the influence of
lithic resources and of lithic industries in general in
human prehistory of the United States.
This report addresses potential sources of chert raw
material for an area roughly one-fifth of the lower
continental United States (Figure I.1). Representing that
area of civil and military jurisdiction of the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers referred to as the "Southwestern
Division", the study units outlined in this report follow
those of the same names and to the maximum extent
possible the same areas as those discussed in the various
syntheses of the Southwestern Division Cultural
Resources Overview. This study is a direct outgrowth of
that report series. The data relied upon for this
particular element of the "Overview" has been derived
from the author's work as a Research Associate in the
Department of Anthropology at the Smithsonian
Institution over the past thirteen years and from personal
field work dating from the early 1950s as well as some
work of a more limited nature for the Corps of Engineers.
Consequently, although this report originally focused
upon Corps of Engineers issues as related to archeology
associated with development and management of
archeological sites on civil works and military
installations, it is also intended for a much broader
audience than just the Corps of Engineers.
There is a natural tendency to look at the state of
knowledge in any particular area of research for
comparison to similar types of study ongoing elsewhere,
and the subject of lithic studies is no different. In several
respects, the "flint" research in Great Britain and certain
other areas of northwestern Europe, where flint trade has
long been a respectable element of archeological
inquiries, is generally looked upon as somehow superior
to similar studies in American archeology. This rationale
can be attributed to the fact that major publications
specifically related to flint (and more recently to chert)
have been published in British literature. The volumes by
Shepherd (1972) and by Sieveking and Hart (1986) have
no modern counterparts in the United States in spite of

the pioneering effort by Holmes (1919) and to a lesser
extent, but more locally specific by Gould (1921) in lithic
resource studies. The Sieveking and Hart volumes
represent three decades of research, much of which
resulted from the International Flint Symposium, which
was founded in 1969. The research efforts in the United
States, and particularly within the geographic area of this
report, may lag behind those in Great Britain, but
changes are foreseen on the horizon. In the United States
there has been no concentrated effort quite like the
European experience, although the European analytical
techniques used are no different than those currently
being used in the United States. There have been,
however, at least two symposia devoted solely to chert
studies sponsored by Southern Illinois University (Butler
and May 1984; Vehik 1984); a uniform classification
system for chert materials (Folk 1965) is widely
recognized in sedimentary petrography in the United
States (that does not appear to be in use to the same
extent in Europe); and chert studies are beginning to be
incorporated into most archeological investigations of
any appreciable depth. Although not specifically related
to chert source identifications largely because most of the
subject sources are from igneous or metamorphic rocks,
and hence not identifiable by formational nomenclature,
the single volume Prehistoric Quarries and Production,
edited by Ericson and Purdy (1984), offers refreshing
studies for lithic industries in general. The article on
"Lithic Material Demand and Quarry Production" by
Barbara Luetdke (1984:65-76) in that volume should be
of particular interest to other researchers.
One apparent difference between British and
American chert studies is simply related to the definition
of flint itself, which traditionally in British thought has
been distinctive from chert. This probably results from
the fact that the varieties of chert in general and the
complexity of associated problems of genesis and
petrography in the United States surpass those basic
problems encountered in Europe. Some of the articles in
the Sieveking-Hart volume do recognize, apparently for
the first time by some researchers, that chert is the parent
classification for all varieties of cryptocrystalline and
microcrystalline silica such as flint.
British research is primarily involved with cherts or
flints that in comparison to U.S. sources are relatively
homogeneous in physical appearance and that were
derived almost exclusively from Cretaceous chalks along
with redeposition of cobbles and gravels in later
Quaternary and Pleistocene glacial deposits.

Identification factors related to the effects of chemical
and mechanical weathering in the redeposited sediments
and beaches seem to be major issues of identification left
to be resolved in Great Britain. That is a considerable
contrast to the complexities faced by researchers in the
United States. In area alone, this combined civil-military
area of the Southwestern Division outlined in Figure I.1
includes nearly 2 million square kilometers. This would
be roughly equivalent to East and West Germany, Great
Britain, France, Belgium, Netherlands and Spain
combined. There are over 110 identifiable geologic units
within this study area alone that are chert formations or
that contain chert of sufficient quantity and quality to
have supplied the basic needs of any prehistoric groups
living within their proximity. Considering the areal extent,
the range of cherts representing a much greater number
of formations spanning the geological record, and some
of the formational complexities involved, it is no wonder
that a comprehensive body of knowledge of lithic
resources is not currently available in the United States.
However, the dramatic increase of research on this
subject within the past quarter-century offers bright hope
for the future of lithic studies.

Definition of Lithic Resources
Lithic resource is a generic term referring to all types of
stone that can be demonstrated to have actually been
used for manufacture of stone tools and left as artifacts or
debitage in archeological sites. While such a designation
includes virtually any type of rock used for any purpose,
the most common use of the term refers to rock types that
possess physical characteristics amenable for conversion
to specific tool forms such as axes, celts, dart or spear
points, knives, scrapers, arrowpoints, etc. In that context,
and the one used here, lithic resource refers to stone that
can be chipped (knapped) and/or ground into shape for
any desired tool form. Consequently lithic studies are
usually divided into chipped and ground stone categories
for discussion purposes. Lithic source, on the other hand,
refers specifically to the geologic origin and location of
the resources themselves. Use of the term "source"
indicates the presence or availability of a certain material
that could have been, but for one reason or another may
not have been, used as a natural resource by any given
culture in question.
Chipped stone tools normally comprise the bulk of
physical remains still existing in most archeological sites.
For that reason, most of the raw materials that can be
best subsumed under the category of chert receive more
attention than do other rock types. The classification of
chert types and particularly the differences between chert
and flint have been and still are confusing to many
individuals, including archeologists and some geologists.
However, to the sedimentary petrographers, distinctions
between the various types of chert are quite well defined.
3

The classification system referred to in this report follows
that of Folk (1965; modified by McBride and Thomson
1970 and Sholes 1978). Its use is highly recommended for
chert studies. This system is recognized by most
sedimentary petrographers, but not necessarily by most
archeologists. The diagenetic origin of chert is
predominantly sedimentary, although some rare igneous
and metamorphic forms also occur. Folk includes all rock
types of microcrystalline and cryptocrystalline silica in
the chert classification. Individual types or "species" such
as flint, chalcedony, jasper, and agate, etc., are
distinguishable by petrographic and visual differences.
For example, chalcedony exhibits a fibrous texture under
a petrographic microscope and is usually translucent,
whereas a moss agate that is closely related and looks like
chalcedony may exhibit a granular rather than fibrous
texture. Folk's classification has been specifically used in
other chert studies within regions of the present study
area (i.e., Bowers 1975; Sholes 1978; Banks 1983, 1984).
Also as used here, petrified or silicified wood is
included as a lithic type. In most cases, petrified wood
occurs as chert in the forms of mixed components of
jasper, agate, chalcedony and opal, but quite often the
original wood grain may no longer be observable either
macroscopically or microscopically. It is common to find '
a single specimen where the wood grain is retained in one
portion of the rock and the remainder has been so altered
by secondary replacement that the wood grain structure
has been obliterated.
The principal igneous rock of special archeological
interest is obsidian, which is a volcanic glass. Other
igneous rock types which were more commonly utilized,
but generally subject to less intensive archeological
concern, are the rhyolites, felsites, trachytes, basalts and
diorites, which occur abundantly in and around most of
Â·the mountainous areas of southwest Texas, New Mexico,
Colorado and to a lesser extent in the Wichita, Arbuckle,
Ouachita, and Ozark mountains of Oklahoma, Arkansas,
and Missouri.
Another lithic type, closely related to, but distinctive
from chert, is quartzite, which occurs as both sedimentary
and metamorphic types called orthoquartzite and
metaquartzite respectively. Although quartzites are also
basically silica, they are distinctive from chert because of
differences in origin, texture, and fracture patterns.
Quartzite as a rule does not possess the same qualities for
producing chipped stone tools as does chert, but some
forms of quartzite were highly desirable for tools. Indeed,
quartzite is superior to chert for certain types of tools.
Identification and speciation of quartzites are often much
more difficult than is identification of cherts.
Finally, the last specifically definable rock type to be
singled out for distinction as a potential source for stone
tools is siliceous oolite. Because ooliths are most
commonly associated with limestones as either sporadic
nodules or as relatively minor bedded deposits, they are,

more often than not, composed of calcium carbonate
rather than other minerals such as silica, dolomite, etc.,
and therefore are not usually associated with the
definition of lithic resources as used here. When the
ooliths are silica and or silica-cemented, they do
constitute a chert-like rock that could be, and often was,
used for production of stone tools. In such cases the
rocks most likely are referred to as an unidentified or
exotic chert in archeological literature when in reality
they may be from a local source of origin. Similar to the
quartzites, discrimination between siliceous oolites from
different formations is difficult at best, especially when
they are found within the same geographic region.
Contrary to the image often projected, the
identification of lithic materials in archeological sites is
not necessarily a routine procedure. Although well
recognized quarry areas and specific geological
formations were given considerable attention during the
late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (e.g.,
Holmes 1919), those resources were neglected relative to
other archeological research until within the past 15 years
or so. In several respects lithic identification precise
enough to provide reliable results for archeological
interpretations is still in its infancy compared to the
sophisticated analytical techniques now available. Even
in the earlier references to the United Kingdom where
flint studies have been more detailed for some three
decades, it has been recently stated that "one is seeing
research [on chert] at an early stage of evolution"
(Sieveking and Hart 1986).

Lithic Site Types
The most common type of site directly related to the
acquisition of raw material for stone tools is almost
universally referred to as a "quarry site", but in most
instances where this term is loosely used, the site type
referred to is, more often than not, a workshop associated
with lithic resources that were readily available from tlie
surface of either terrace gravels or chert eroded from
actual outcrops. For example, McGraw and Valdez
(1978) never describe or mention the presence of a single
"quarry" associated with the site investigations reported
as "41 BX 68: A Prehistoric Quarry-Workshop In
Northern Bexar County, Texas". Likewise, Mallouf
(1989:81-103) discusses the Yellow Hawk Site as a quarry
workshop. Although quarries exist in the general area,
they were not observed as such by Mallouf at the Yellow
Hawk site itself. While a distinction between these two
related site types may seem totally unnecessary, they
nevertheless are important ones to be made for the
physical differences involved in producing chert
materials from excavation versus picking up convenient
surface materials must have certainly required different
social behavior and possibly even ceremonial differences
that reflected on the society itself. In many of the areas of
4

major chert concentrations, one of the most common
observations made by modern knappers is that specific
quarrying is unnecessary just to to produce reasonable
quantities of chert to manufacture a number of tools. For
the most part chert occurs in those areas in sufficient
abundance on the surface or natural bluff exposures to
satisfy most apparent needs. This possibly explains why
quarries are not universally associated with chert
outcrops in some areas, but at the same time the actual
quarries seem to be more associated with those same
formational type materials than with others where chert is
not so abundant. This raises the frequently asked
question. as to why the intensive labor of quarrying was
resorted to in those situations. The question is not easily
answered solely from a technological point of view that
can be demonstrated archeologically.
In some areas such as the vicinity of the Kay County
quarries of Oklahoma, quantities of large, lenticular
nodules are not so common under surficially available
conditions and therefore the use of quarrying is
understandable. Answers to the question of "necessity"
for quarries in many cases may lie more within the realm
of social behavior than within the technological arena.
Also, quarry sites do represent a specialized type of site
that often defies temporal and cultural definition, but
most geological outcrops that were used for tool
manufacture do not contain quarries per se. Just how
quarries were used and the role they played in the
socioeconomic development and ceremonialism of the
individual cultures are challenging questions for
archeologists to answer. Quarries reflect longer term,
more intensive, and perhaps even ceremonial use more so
than do source areas where specific quarries do not exist.
Specifically, a quarry is characterized by excavated pits,
the presence of specialized tools such as hammerstones,
pick-like implements, scraping tools for removing both
soil and detritus, piles of detritus (waste host-rock as well
as chert debitage ), and broken fragments of preforms or
quarry blanks. Quarries represent a unique part of the
cultural landscape related to all prehistoric and some
historic societies involved in stone tool production. This
is especially true for those peoples who utilized the
resources in a more intensive and technologically
sophisticated system than one characterized by the
collection of chert materials from the surface simply as a
matter of expediency.
A significant data gap in archeological research has
resulted from the limited attention given to
research-oriented excavations conducted on quarry sites
within the study area. Excavations have, however, been
conducted by the Kansas State Historical Society in the
Flint Hills (John Reynolds and Martin Stein, personal
communication), the University of Arkansas Museum,
th.e Arkansas Archeological Survey (Early and Limp
1982) at the novaculite quarries, the University of
Oklahoma (Vehik 1984) in the Kay County quarries of

the Flint Hills, and the University of Texas at San
Antonio (McGraw and Valdez 1978) in the Edwards
Plateau. In general, however, we continue to rely upon
the accuracy of assumptions about how such sites were
related to possible habitation areas or whether
differences in methods of acquisition occurred from one
cultural group to another or from any period of time to
another.
In contrast to the quarry-specific site types, the most
common and pervasive process of obtaining chert
appears to have been one of expediency: that is, the
collection and modification of surface materials most
conveniently available to the cultural group in question.
And more often than not, this workshop-site type occurs
on or near gravel deposits. While use of the term
"expediency" may seem to imply less effort involved in the
procurement, nothing could be farther from the truth. My
experience suggests that the use of gravels for tool
manufacture may have required much less arduous labor,
but it also required a much more intensive selection
process per volume of material produced than did actual
quarrying. While surficial rocks may have been obtained
from any outcrop, more often than not this type of activity
was associated with gravel deposits. Because of this
almost ubiquitous use of such sources, a knowledge of the
origins of gravels themselves may be important factors in
Â· lithic identifications. Therefore, even in those instances
where in situ rock types may not have been used because
of some characterisic flaws in overall quality, gravels
resulting from those same sources may in fact be of better
quality and have served as the principal source of that
particular rock type. It is very important to intimately
know the drainage systems of immediate relationship to
the geology in any given area under archeological
investigation in order to be able to make such
evaluations. In the accompanying maps of this report the
drainage systems are plotted in as much detail as possible
in relationship to chert source areas.
Both quarry and workshop sites contain research
potential in lithic procurement of a unique character. As
such, they require methodological approaches with a
different technical and theoretical outlook than the more
common site types usually being reported. For a variety
of reasons, lithic workshops and quarries are generally
some of the most difficult types of archeological sites
from which to obtain information that can be applied to
broader problems. For example, such sites seldom yield
diagnostic artifacts, features, or datable materials needed
to establish relationships to any particular time period or
group of people. Obsidian hydration can be used for
dating, but nothing comparable to the hydration
technique for cherts has yet been developed.
Thermoluminescent dating (Goksu et al. 1974) has
been used successfully in dating burned chert from
paleolithic sites in Europe. The best results were from
sites ranging from 30,000 to 100,000 years old, but J. H.
5

Fremlin (personal communication) said they also "had
good agreement in measurements of some more recent
Bronze Age material." The best results at that time,
however, were from the older materials, and he urged
caution on uncritical acceptance of younger materials.
Since 1974 the thermoluminescent dating methodology
has been improved considerably here in the United
States as well as Europe. Patterson (1980) has reported
good results on dating 9,000-year-old heated cherts from
south Texas. He also discusses the limitations on
thermoluminescent dating related to the degree of
heating of the original materials, but not to younger ages.
This process obviously has potential for application to
quarry materials especially where associated heating by
design or accident occurred. Future investigators should
pay particular attention to this possibility. According to
Goksu et al. (1974:653) and to Patterson (1980), a
kilogram of soil matrix surrounding the heated chert to
be dated should be collected for obtaining background
saturation of the soil gamma ray dosage necessary for
calibration.
Because quarries generally do not usually contain
diagnostic artifacts useful for chronological seriation, the
most effective method of assigning cultural
contemporaneity to the use of any lithic resource is from
the identification of the materials in artifact forms found
in sites that are geographically separate from the source
itself. For this reason, accurate identification of the raw
materials is especially critical for archeological
interpretations, but researchers must develop more
effective methods for obtaining more reliable interpretive
data from the raw material source.
Quarry sites are also difficult to study because many
have been depleted of the most suitable materials for
knapping purposes. While the debitage material is
extensive, and quite impressive to modern observers,
much of the extant material represents waste. The raw
materials that were of greatest value to the prehistoric
producers have been consumed or deposited elsewhere.
In other words, many quarry areas seem to have been
maximized economically. The amounts and, in some
cases, relatively high quality of the debitage at many
quarries demand an answer to why that pattern occurs so
frequently. To many modern knappers that waste
material is considered to be better than anything else
available. Was that material precluded from
consideration for use by later visitors for some reason
other than technical quality? If so, why? The answer to
that and many other unexplained phenomena related to
quarries may lie closer to the realm of sociology and
ceremonialism than to technical explanations.
Some particular cherts are recognized by many
archeologists, but often such cursory identifications are
accepted without relying upon comparative analysis or
more rigorous test methods. In cases where accurate
identification becomes critical for establishment of trade

or migration routes, or for understanding the
development of socioeconomics for any given society,
simple recognition is not good enough. While this may
sound somewhat dramatic, there are situations where
archeological interpretations have much broader effects
on society than simply those issues to be argued in an
academic setting. For example, when archeological
interpretations become factors in settling land claims
between Indian groups or between those groups and state
or federal governments, scientifically accurate fmdings
can be quite important. In some instances, they can
affect legal settlements in terms of millions of dollars.
Lithic resources can figure prominently in establishment
of areas of domain. In certain cases it is possible to
discriminate, with a relatively high degree of reliability,
between cultural components of a site solely through the
identification of lithic materials even when diagnostic
artifacts are not available.

Bask Issues/Problems in Chert
Identification
The status of lithic resource studies related to
archeology in the study area vary widely from one state or
region to another, and from one institution to another.
The reports produced in the state of Oklahoma tend to
include lithic sources and attempts at identification more
consistently than do those in other areas, but even there
the surface has hardly been scratched.
Most lithic studies in what is considered traditional
Southwestern archeology (i.e., Arizona, New Mexico, and
parts of Utah, Colorado and Nevada) have been
primarily restricted to obsidian more than chert because
of the chronological control potential offered by
obsidian. Also there has been a much stronger emphasis
on ceramic studies such as seriation, typology, and
petrography because pottery is abundant and a better
medium for obtaining tightly controlled data. As a result,
ceramics are studied almost to the exclusion of chert. The
use and treatment of lithic resources by Cameron and by
Cameron and Sappington in the excellent volume Recent
Research on Chaco Prehistory, edited by Judge and
Schelberg (1984), should serve as a model study, not only
for Southwestern prehistory but for prehistoric studies in
general, and especially when dealing with highly
organized societies. The traditional disparity between
lithic and ceramic studies in New Mexico and perhaps
other parts of Southwestern prehistory may be waning.
The identification of chert (and chert-bearing)
formations and the distinguishable varieties or "species"
of chert existing in each formation is poorly known in
general, with the exception of the knowledge of a
relatively few individuals who devote considerable effort
to lithic resources as a special research interest. Perhaps

6

some of the most basic reasons for this state of affairs are
attributable to the following:
1. Archeologists, and some geologists, do not rely upon
a single systematic classification system for chert
identifications.
2. The names used for a given chert type, or even of the
formation containing the chert, may change with a
state boundary or some other arbitrary system. Too
often this is true in geology as well as archeology. The
type locality of any formation is normally based on
local geographic names, but in geology those type
localities are accompanied by descriptions of
geologic sections that can be reexamined for accuracy
by others at a later date. Archeologists as a rule do
not possess the geological background necessary for
accurate identifications, and in many cases do not rely
upon those who do. As a result, the names and
"classification" for any particular type of chert
identified in archeological literature may be derived
from the nearest town, creek, landowner, or some
other convenient term without respect to the geologic
formation of origin. Once such a name is in print, it
tends to become a standard regardless of its actual
geological accuracy. In many cases, the same chert
type is known by different names in different states,
and is described by widely varying standards of
classification. Such methods of identification should
not be continued! Ultimate resolution of the
problems in lithic resource identifications will only be
possible when uniform classification systems and
testable analytical techniques for discrimination
become standard procedures in archeological Â·
research.
3. Another related, but minor, issue affecting
archeological use of geological terminology pertains
to accurate application of basic geological definitions
in general. This includes basic visual descriptions as
well as more refined analytical techniques. Even the
proper application of physical measurements for
such things as stream and terrace gravels used as lithic
resources is often lacking. The terms pebble, cobble,
and boulder are used rather arbitrarily by
archeologists in describing those sources, and in
some cases can make a considerable difference in the
accuracy of archeological interpretations. With
some notable exceptions such as the Lithic
Technology at the George C. Davis Site by Shafer
(1973) and the work by Heinrich (1983) at Fort Polk,
most archeological references to the descriptions of
gravels may or may not actually mean that a pebble,
for example, indicates a rock between 4 and 16 mm
in size. The differences in size are often important
factors when considering gravel deposits as lithic
source areas. Archeological research should include
more recognized standards in classification of

sediment sizes such as the Wentworth Scale (1922) as
well as other geologically accepted terminology.
4. A comparative collection of lithic materials with
associated analytical documentation for any one of
the regions discussed herein is essentially
nonexistent. A number of collections do exist,
however, in varying degrees of completeness. Some
specific collections known to the writer that have
been started and are routinely being augmented are
those by Warren for the State of New Mexico; Shelley
for eastern New Mexico and west Texas; several
individuals, but primarily by Wyckoff for the
Oklahoma Archeological Survey; Ray for southern
Missouri; Dickson for the Ozark region of Arkansas,
Oklahoma, and Missouri; Mallouf and Tunnell in the
Texas Historical Commission; Story and others for
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory; and
Banks for the Smithsonian Institution. Few chert
types, however, within any of these collections are
accompanied by thin sections, petrographic analyses,
O!" more refined analyses useful for discrimination.
The development of comparative collections for any
single archeological project does not usually fall
within the constraints of those specifically funded by
the public. In the absence of specific lithic research
projects being funded, it has been, and probably will
continue to be, incumbent upon concerned
individuals to develop such collections on a
cumulative and often opportunistic basis. The
general lack of syntheses on previous work that seems
to afflict contract archeology or cultural resource
management (CRM), however, is a detriment to such
a cumulative approach. This could be corrected
through commitments to the problem through
contract scopes of work on specifically relevant chert
sources, but that approach would also require some
additional allocation of funds to efforts that are
already pressed by other demands.
5. The effects of chemical and mechanical weathering
on gravels, as in the case of the British flints
referenced earlier, also drastically complicate the
identification process because of changes in
coloration, creation of banding, some modification in
diaphaneity, and sometimes even changes in texture
(Kumai et al. 1983). To a greater degree than with in
situ deposits, it is also probable that many of the
gravel deposits have been depleted of higher quality
materials that once existed for tool prbduction as a
result of high grading by the prehistoric consumers.
In such instances, however, flake debris resulting
from the "testing" of cobbles by the knappers provides
some evidence of their use, and the remaining small
and unusable pebbles of similar materials are
indicative of the former range of variability in the rock
types available. In combination with the changes
resulting from the weathering process, the effects of
7

intentional heat treatment and in some cases the
effects of natural and or culturally related but
unintentional heating (or burning), must be
considered in the identification of raw materials.
Heat treatment is often practiced by modern
flintknappers on materials from some of the sources
referenced herein, but many of those, for obvious
reasons, do not necessarily attempt to replicate
prehistoric processes. Flintknapper J.B. Sollberger
of Dallas (personal communication), for example,
uses a sophisticated heat treatment system that
involves controls on degrees of heat and time that is
not realistic to expect ofknappers in prehistory. Heat
treatment often produces effects that are nearly the
same in most cherts, but there are also differential
effects that require replication on practically any
individual chert type. Rick (1978) conducted such
experiments on a series of cherts occurring in the
Illinois Valley and published some very informative
data that applies to chert in general, but the results
produced in the Illinois cherts will not necessarily be
typical of cherts elsewhere. Accurate recognition of
heat-treated materials of any given chert type may be
necessary to determine the raw material source of
many archeological artifacts. It is also interesting that
Rick's experiment with wood fires was ineffective as
a process of heat treatment. Heat treatment
experiments are currently being conducted on
Ogallala quartzites in connection with lithic studies
on the Cooper Lake project by Banks and Bowers in
northeast Texas, but as of this date there have been
no published results on heat treatment of specific
cherts within the study area comparable to those by
Rick (1978) in Illinois. Some chert and quartzite
gravels, such as those in the Uvalde Formation, were
not particularly suitable for knapping under natural
conditions but were greatly improved by heat
treatment. Because of that and a variety of other
reasons determined on a case-by-case basis, gravel
deposits may often have been of greater economic
importance to prehistoric lithic industries than were
bedded in situ sources located in the same general
area. More often than not gravels meeting specific
criteria for knapping were a very important resource,
and their potential should never be underestimated.
The lack of basic research in dealing with lithic
materials identification is a significant data gap in both
academic and contract archeology. There are probably
more lithic studies available in the CRM and gray
literature, but even here they are often of self-serving and
nontechnical content that does little for resolving existing
problems or for providing others with data that is
analytically testable in future studies. There are
exceptions, however, such as some of those studies
referred to in this report.

Analytical Techniques
There are seven basic analytical techniques that are
available and most suitable for identification and
discrimination of chert materials. These are: comparative
analysis, petrographic analysis, scanning electron
microscopy; three different processes of trace element
analyses which include x-ray fluorescence, neutron
activation, proton-induced x-ray emission (PIXE)
(Johansson et al. 1972); and ultra-violet light
fluorescence (UVLF). Unfortunately, none of these
techniques are routinely relied upon in most
archeological investigations, and especially not in
contract archeology. Of course, once specific physical
properties can be assigned to particular chert types,
additional costly examinations on the source materials
may not be justified, although such analyses on
archeological specimens may be. As of this date,
however, those basic characteristics have yet to be
obtained for most chert sources to an extent that would
provide a statistically reliable data base. Some knowledge
of the effectiveness of the various techniques available
should be relied upon before simply requiring application
to any given archeological project. Suggested reading can
be found in the publication series Advances in X-Ray
Analysis. William Bickle (personal communication) from
the Physics Department of the University of Arizona
provided me with an assessment of comparisons and
contrasts for using PIXE versus neutron activation for
certain chert studies. One of the best archeological
advantages of PIXE versus neutron activation is that
PIXE is nondestructive. Also,
if a sample containing only one atom of a trace
element is neutron activated, it can cause at
most just one isotope of that element. When it
decays it gives just one gamma ray. If the same
sample is "proton-activated" by PIXE, an x-ray
will be emitted every time the trace atom is hit.
Therefore to collect good statistics with PIXE
one needs only to bombard for a long time.
With neutron activation, only one gamma is
released, and then it must be reactivated again
(Bickle 1983).
The use of UVLF as a means of mineral detection and
identification in geology, and particularly for
hydrocarbon detection in rock cuttings during oil well
drilling, has been a common practice for many years. In
the mid-1970s, Dave Love of the U.S. Geological Survey
in Casper, Wyoming, suggested to me in connection with
the Jones-Miller study that chert specimens from several
different formations in Wyoming be subjected to UVLF
for possible distinction because of the potentially high
uranium content. That effort did not produce
consistently repeatable patterns. Michael Collins, with
Prewitt and Associates in Austin, Texas, has been
experimenting with UVLF as a means of distinquishing
8

certain varieties of Edwards cherts from visually identical
cherts such as "Kentucky Hornstone." Collins' results are
quite remarkable. Following Collins' lead on the
Edwards materials, Roger Bowers and I have been
experimenting with other chert materials that are almost
visually indistinguishable from Edwards types. This
includes nova-cherts from the Ouachita Mountains in
Oklahoma, Knife River Flint from quarries in North
Dakota, and Dongola (or Cobdon) chert from southern
Illinois. Distinctions between the Edwards and Knife
River look-alikes are dramatic. The others are not quite
as dramatic, but definite distinctions are consistently
possible with the materials examined so far. This simple
and relatively inexpensive procedure appears to have
potentially extraordinary implications for at least some
chert types that seem to be otherwise mdistinguishable.

Geological Publications
and Chert Studies
A lack of reliance on geological literature in identifying
raw material in archeological research is inexcusable.
There are few, if any, geographic areas not addressed in
the geological literature and this literature contains some
of the materials that are of basic necessity in lithic
studies. Specific sources of geological literature within
the study area that are especially relevant to chert studies
are the U.S. Geological Survey Bulletins and Water
Supply Papers; individual State Geological Survey
publication series and Geological Society Guidebooks,
and others such as the New Mexico State Bureau of
Mines and Mineral Resources, the Texas Bureau of
Economic Geology, and the Oklahoma Water Resources
Board. These are all excellent sources of information. In
addition to written geological publications, statewide
geologic maps exist for each of the eight states
represented in this discussion. The states of Texas and
Oklahoma also have a publication series of regional and
more detailed maps, i.e., Texas Geologic Atlas series
produced by the Bureau of Economic Geology at the
University of Texas at Austin, and the Hydrologic Atlas
series produced by the Oklahoma Geological Survey. The
Arkansas Geological Commission has a series of
unpublished 7.5' geological reconnaissance maps in draft
form for the entire state that were prepared between
1968 and 1974 for producing the 1976 Geologic Map of
Arkansas. The maps are authored individually, and
although there are no plans for publishing them, they are
available for purchase from the Geological Commission.
They provide considerably more detail than is available
elsewhere. All of these above referenced sources provide
indispensable background for the initiation of chert
studies for any subject area in the region. But, as
mentioned above, descriptions and maps needed for
archeological purposes are not necessarily of particular

geological interest and quite often simply do not provide
refined details needed for archeological purposes. It will
primarily be up to the archeological investigators to build
upon the base data through use of geological specialists.
The New Mexico Archaeological Council is currently
attempting to develop a statewide "Lithlc Concord" to
fully standardize descriptive terminology and material
type identification with revised in-field methods (Peter
Eidenbach, personal communication). We can only hope
that such an initiative will spread to other states.

Study Description
This report was originally intended for inclusion in the
. 12 volume series of the Corps of Engineers' Southwestern
Division Cultural Resources Overview produced by the
Arkansas Archeological Survey. As such, the delineation
of individual study units initially followed the basic
format of the archeological syntheses in that series. Since
this is being published as a separate volume the need to
adhere to that format has changed somewhat, although
the boundary for the overall eight state study area
conforms to the geographic boundaries under
jurisdiction of military and civil works responsibilities of
the Southwestern Division of the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers.
The study area is divided into regional areas
(Chapters) that essentially conform to the six basic study
units of the Overview series, but they are subdivided into
units related to more specifically definable physiographic
and geologic features and formations. Within this area
there are dozens of physiographically definable regions
deserving of recognition as major potential sources for
chert and other relevant rock types that have been used
for production of stone tools for the greater part of
human history. For example, Ungnade (1983) defines 39
different mountain ranges in New Mexico, and in each of
those individual ranges specific drainage basins could be
considered as separate source areas, although the
geological formations may be the same or at least of
lateral equivalency to resources located in other areas.
Also, as in the case of the Ozark Mountains, each
individual range may include a number of different
chert-bearing formations. Relevant chert sources
adjacent to, but outside of, the study area are referenced
in the text but not illustrated. They are referenced
because of their potential, if not direct, effect upon lithic
identifications of artifact materials on sites within the
region.
Table I.1 illustrates the relationship between the chertbearing geologic formations in the study area as a whole,
but it must be noted that they are taken out of their
overall geologic context. The non-chert-bearing units of
which these are only a small part are not included. Also,
the most specifically definable geological units
(formations and members) are only listed under
9

respective groups or series and are not necessarily in
precise stratigraphic sequence, and units designated as
members are shown in parentheses following the name of
the formation. Lateral equivalencies are not illustrated,
but are referenced in the text. Names of the respective
geologic units follow the nomenclature most commonly
used in geological literature as referenced herein. There
are instances where a particular formation that actually
spans more than one unit may be included as an
uppermost member of a unit by one geologist and in the
lowermost member of an overlying unit by another.
Consequently, formational assignment may vary in rare
cases from one geological reference to another . As
demonstrated in Table 11, the number of actual geologic
units that contain chert totals over 120, but that does not
mean that all the chert-bearing formations exhibit the
characteristics and qualities needed required for
effective conversion of the raw materials to tool forms.
Also, all of the geological formations listed in Table I.1
are not specifically discussed in the text, but are
referenced to other publications or reports where they
have been discussed in greater detail. It is intended that
the list of formations in Table I.1 be used as a guide to
potential chert sources for consideration in connection
with future archeological research in any of the
respective geographic areas. It should be noted that the
large areas lacking chert formations which lie between
principal source localities are not always void of
knappable lithics. The landscape created by relict and
modern drainage systems has, in general, been much the
same throughout human history. Thus, gravels are strewn
across much of the modem surface downstream from the
in situ rocks. For all practical purposes, that same surface
was available to most prehistoric groups. There are some
areas that do not fit neatly into such a category. During
some part of late Tertiary or early Pleistocene time, the
Arkansas River principal course followed the modern
day course of the Medicine Lodge (Fay 1965:66-76) and
consequently left chert, quartzite, and petrified wood
gravels derived from High Plains and Rocky Mountain
sources deposited on terraces that are now interfluves
adjacent to the Salt Fork and at a considerable distance
from the Arkansas mainstem. The lower Arkansas also
followed considerably different courses throughout
Tertiary and Pleistocene history (Saucier 1974). In
specific reaches other river courses such as the Pecos and
the Rio Grande may also have changed through time.

Lithic Sources
The terms used herein for the individual chert types
normally are the same names as the geologic unit of
origin, but in those instances where the most commonly
recognized name for a specific chert type is different
from the geological name, both will be referenced in the
text, but not shown in Table I.1. It also is important to

across the region as a whole nor were all areas subject to
the same post-depositional structural and erosional
changes.
It has been mentioned elsewhere (Banks 1984:79) that
in the Oklahoma portion alone of the flanks of the Ozarks
the Boone Group (containing the chert-bearing Joplin
and Grand Falls Chert members of the Keokuk
Formation) underlie and constitute some 5180 sq km
(2500 sq mi) of area for potential chert exploitation. The
Boston Mountain Plateau as a whole extends some 200 mi
to the east of Oklahoma and across Arkansas to the edge
of the Mississippi embayment, is some 35 mi in width
(Fenneman 1938: 631), and likewise can be considered an
area of potential chert exploitation of 11,200 sq. km
(7,000 sq mi). Although the Boston Mountains are
rugged and rise in excess of 2,000 feet above sea level, few
places within this area were absolutely unaccessible to
prehistoric inhabitants on foot. As noted in Figure 1.1,
however, exposures of the Boone Group greatly exceed
the 11,200 sq km area of the Boston Mountains. The
geological stratigraphy of this study unit is illustrated in
Table 1.1.
The sheer volume of chert, the individual varieties
within each formation, the incomplete geological
sequences for any one formation at a single locality, the
near-absence of detailed geological maps for much of the
area as a whole, and the nomenclature differences for
some of the most critical chert-bearing units all
contribute to the bewildering state of knowledge
concerning chert identifications in this area. If it is any
consolation, the identification of individual cherts is every
bit as confusing to the geologists as it is to archeologists.
Perhaps that is part of the problem. Although the level of
details specifically related to chert is not addressed by
Huffman (1958), his set of six related maps for the
western flanks of the Ozarks are by far the most detailed
maps that the writer has had available that differentiate
between the complex formations on a regional basis.
Because of the historically early interest of French,
reputedly Spanish, as well as Anglo-Americans in the
tri-state (Missouri, Oklahoma, Arkansas) region's heavy
metals (i.e., galena, silver, etc.), the geological
examinations in the area are quite old. As in many other
parts of the country, some of the earlier recognition of
large holes excavated into rock formations attracted
specific attention because they were obviously associated
with "Spanish Diggings" for extracting silver or gold. Also
as it has turned out in those other areas, the "Spanish
Diggings" can usually be identified as prehistoric chert
quarries. Local folk can still be found at various places in
the area who attribute the piles of rocks and holes on
their lands to the Spanish. Such was the case in the early
1970s when the writer requested permission to examine
chert quarries in the Warsaw Formation near Pierce City,
Missouri. The above discussion was included here for two
reasons: to illustrate the point that formal (for their day)
14

geological reports of investigations in the area date back
to at least 1834 (Featherstonhaugh 1835), and secondly
there are probably many quarry/workshop sites that exist
in the region but for various reasons have yet to be
reported as such.
Ray (1984:225-250) has written a brief, but excellent
"Overview of the Chipped Stone Resources in Southern
Missouri". In this article he discusses several of the same
chert types included in this volume, but he also reports
several others adjacent to this study area that researchers
should note. In particular he provides details about the
Chouteau to the north and to the igneous rock types from
the St. Francis Mountains to the northeast. It is especially
noteworthy that Ray cautions others in being too
dogmatic about differentiation between the Gasconade,
Roubidoux, and Jefferson City cherts and particularly
those in a weathered condition occurring in the Salem
Plateau area. He suggests that they be referenced as an
"undifferentiated Ordovician chert type" in archeological
typologies (Ray 1984:234).
Farther to the north, but still within potential influence
on the archeology in the more northerly portions of this
study area, Reid's 1980 syntheses (Reid 1980a, 1980b)
provide a much needed addition to the state of
knowledge for Pennsylvanian cherts of northwestern
Missouri, southeast Nebraska, and northeastern Kansas
along with southwestern Iowa.
Dickson (n.d.) has described much of the northern
Arkansas, southern Missouri, and northeastern
Oklahoma chert sources in an manuscript on the
Albertson site. Some specific points he has personally
communicated to me warrant mention here: he has
found outcrops of chert both in Arkansas (one of which is
close to his house, and is definitely Penters chert) and in
Missouri containing rocks that are identical to the
Sallisaw reported by Banks (1984:80) and to the Penters
chert of Arkansas; the statement by Fay and Roberts
(1971:23) that the Cotter Dolomite was correlated to the
Jefferson City Formation of Missouri as referenced by
Banks (1984:80) is in error in that both the Cotter and the
Jefferson City formations are well recognized as
individual formations in Arkansas and in Missouri.
Dickson's continuing and demanding research on cherts
in this region are certain to provide major future
refinements in the ability to obtain better distinctions
between the chert types.
Because of the areally extensive chert exposures and
the volume of raw material involved, the Ozarks certainly
have the potential of containing more distinct actual
quarries in a greater variety of chert-bearing formations
than any other single region in the study area.
Reasonably well-known quarries occur near Bolivar,
Missouri, in the Cotter Dolomite (Fowkes 1927, Turner
1954); south of Pierce City, Missouri, in the Warsaw
Formation, a lateral equivalent to the Sallisaw in
Oklahoma (personal examination by the writer); east of

Peoria, Oklahoma, in the Tahlequah Member of the
Moorefield Formation (Holmes 1919:201-207); in the
Penters Chert near Noel, Missouri (personal examination
by the writer with Jim Spears and Don Dickson); and
lesser known workshop/quarries in the tri-state area of
Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Missouri and possibly in the
extreme southeastern corner of Kansas. Though specific
locations were not discussed, Gould (1921:72) mentions
quarries being located in Newton and Jasper counties,
Missouri, in addition to Ottawa and Delaware counties,
Oklahoma. The geological formations of the region that
most commonly contain quarries are the Jefferson
City-Cotter, Burlington-Keokuk, Reeds Spring, Warsaw,
Pitkin, and St. Joe formations and the Tahlequah
Member of the Moorefield.
Lithic studies have probably been as intensive in the
Ozarks as any other comparable region of the study area,
but in spite of those efforts, relatively little detailed
information is available to researchers as published
literature. The actual distribution of chert in the various
geological formations and speciation of the varieties have
yet to be defined with any appreciable degree of
precision. Typical specimens from some of the major
Ozark formations are illustrated in Appendix A, Plates 1
and2.
Discussion of the individual formations will proceed in
sequence of geological chronology from oldest to
youngest. The first four of these Ordovician-aged
formations occur in direct stratigraphic sequence that is
uninterupted by intervening non-chert formations.

that fossils are rare in the Gasconade cherts and that
although the "texture ... varies from coarse to fine
grained ... the vugs, druse, and quartzose generally
combine to make it a relatively poor quality chert". In
spite of this deficient quality of the Gasconade as well as
the Roubidoux chert to be discussed next, Ray (1984:230)
reports his own documentation and that of Price, et al.
(1983) that "identification and tabulation of [both chert
types] have been compiled for sites in the Gasconade
River Valley and for sites along the Black River"
respectively.

Roubidoux Limestone
The Roubidoux of some 225-250 feet (69 to 76 m) in
thickness in southeastern Missouri was first described by
Winslow (1894). The chert in the formation is described
by Heller (1954:21) as being
highly variable in character ranging from
porceUaneous, banded varieties to sandy and
oolitic varieties .... Chert occurs as irregular
layers ranging from a fraction of an inch to
10-12 feet in thickness and as irregular nodules
and lenses in the dolomite member.
Ray has informed me that he is unaware of actual
quarries in contrast to a large number of workshops in
southern Missouri and that quarries are particularly
absent in the Roubidoux Formation. He also expressed
his belief that the quartzite in the Roubidoux was more
important archeologically than was the poor quality
chert.

Gasconade
Jefferson City Limestone

The Gasconade Formation is primarily a dolomite that
was named by Croneis (1930). According to Heller (1954:
17) it has an average thickness of some 109 m (315 ft)
although in places it attains a maximum thickness of 228
m (750 ft). The chert is described by Heller (1954:17) as a
type that ranges
from white, porcellaneous, and quartzose
oolite varieties to gray and blue gray-oolitic
varieties, [that] is an important constituent in
the lower part (245-265 feet) of the Gasconade
Formation. The upper portion in contrast
rarely contains chert in any abundance, rarely
more than 18%. When it does it is
brownish-gray and gray quartzose chert which
occurs as irregular masses in the dolomite.
In the same reference, Heller mentions that the
formation "also contains abundant cryptozoan chert. One
of these cryptozoan beds which occurs from 50 to 70 feet
below the top of the formation seems to be fairly
moderately distributed", and that the formation is
equivalent to the Tanyard Formation of Texas and the
McKensie Hill Formation of Oklahoma.
In his more extensive discussion of individual chert
formations in the Ozarks, Ray (1984:229-230) points out

The Jefferson City is one of the most extensive chertbearing formations in the Ozarks. It covers large areas of
Missouri and Arkansas, and it underlies the Cotter
Dolomite. Because the Jefferson City and Cotter
formations are mapped as undifferentiated units on the
state maps of Arkansas and Missouri, it is impossible to
segregate the two, but in combination, they constitute in
excess of 16,000 sq km (10,000 sq mi) in area. The
Jefferson City Formation is not recognized as a separate
formation in Oklahoma although as mentioned previously
it was referred to as a lateral equivalent to the Cotter in a
statement by Fay and Roberts (1971:23). The formation
was originally named by Winslow (1894:331) as the
Jefferson City Limestone and [at that time] as the
uppermost member of the Silurian-aged Gasconade
Formation. Croneis (1930:21) reported the average
thickness of the Jefferson City Formation as 350 feet (107
m).
The cherts observed by the writer in Jefferson City
outcrops near the type locality and at various places
around Lake Of The Ozarks are opaque; light tan,
various shades of white to light gray, and creme colored;
and with relatively indistinct banding in comparison to
16

the cherts in the Cotter. Mottling is more common than is
actual banding. The cherts vary considerably in texture.
Ray (1984:233) describes three different varieties of the
chert occuring as oolitic, banded and mottled and as
lenticular beds, thin bands or seams, and free nodules in
a dolomite matrix. Color distinctions are mentioned for
the three (Ray 1983:233-234) although none is explicitly
provided for the oolitic materials. The banded chert is
defined (ibid.) as being "common to ellipsoidal nodules
[that are] often concentric in cross section; the bands are
usually white, alternating with blue, brown, gray, black or
purple". The mottled cherts are defined as being more
common to irregular nodules in any combination of the
predominant colors, and as being distinguished from
mottled Mississippian cherts because of "streaked and
swirled pattern[s] or a disturbed banded appearance".

Cotter Dolomite
The Cotter Dolomite was named by Ulrich from
exposures near the town of Cotter in Baxter County,
Arkansas, in 1904. In older geological reports in
Arkansas it was called "magnesian limestone" and in
Missouri, "second magnesian limestone". Prior to Ulrich's
definition, it was also referred to as the Yellville
Limestone in Arkansas. The formation attains a thickness
of about 500 feet in Boone County, Arkansas (Croneis
1930:21).
.
The chert in the Cotter Dolomite is possibly the most
Â· distinctive chert type in the region (Banks 1984:80). The
maps accompanying Huffman's 1958 report provide the
most accurate details on the locations of the sporadic
exposures of the Cotter in Oklahoma. The better
exposures occur near Spavinaw Lake and Lake Eucha.
In Marcher and Bingham (1971), the Cotter is mapped
along with the Chattanooga, Fernvale, Fite, and Tyner
formations as an undifferentiated unit. Although this map
series offers better geological details in some areas, it is
specifically designed for groundwater hydrology, and in
this case archeologically desirable geological details are
lacking.
In Arkansas and Missouri the Cotter crops out
extensively as mentioned previously. Ridge tops in north
central Arkansas such as at Norfolk Lake are located
within outcrop areas of the Cotter and are literally
covered with large blocky fragments of the Cotter chert.
In places where forest fires have burned over the areas
some of the lighter colored rocks have been altered to
various shades of pinkish grays. While the characteristic
banding in these cherts is common throughout the
formation, there are some apparently subtle differences
that have been observed by Don Dickson (personal
communication) and the writer. That is, the banding in
the chert appears to be thicker in the more easterly
portions of the outcrops. The typical Cotter specimens
shown in Figure 1.2 were not selected for this particular
attribute, yet they do exhibit these characteristics.
17

Figure 1.2. Typical cherts in the Cotter Dolomite (Don
Dickson collection).

The Cotter cherts occur in rather large blocky pieces,
possess conchoidal fracture, and have esthetically
pleasing coloration. However, in terms of knappability,
the chert is difficult to flake effectively although it was
obviously used prehistorically (as attested to by artifacts
of relatively wide geographic and temporal usage) and
still is by some modern knappers. The banding in the
material tends to deflect the force of the fracture patterns
being applied by hammerstones or batons, and to a lesser
extent by pressure flaking. Also the rock, except where
internal and natural fracture patterns are present, is very
tough and durable.

Sallisaw-Penters
The Sallisaw Formation was named by Cram
(1930:550) for beds exposed along Sallisaw Creek near
Marble City, Oklahoma. Usage of the name appears to be
restricted to Oklahoma. The best discussions of this
formation are found in Amsden (1960, 1961). Amsden
(1960:54) refers to chert in the formation as "small
nodules and lenses of light colored vitreous chert", but in
other places (pages 54 and 55) he refers to arenaceous
carbonates that are silicified and to arenaceous chert

facies in the formation. Amsden (1961:45 and 46,
respectively) also mentions descriptions by two other
investigators (Siemens 1950:57) and Powell (1951:18)
that he had not personally observed but that should be
referenced here. Siemens, according to Amsden,
discussed a basal zone in the Sallisaw some two or three
inches thick "made up of light tan to colorless chert
blocks surrounded by brown sandstone", and Powell
mentioned a "10-inch bed of unfossiliferous pearl gray
chert underlain by the St. Clair limestone and overlain by
the Sylamore sandstone" that he referred to as Sallisaw.
Amsden (1961:45) expressed his opinion that this
particular bed should be located in the Sylamore rather
than in the Sallisaw. The Sallisaw is possibly equivalent to
the Warsaw in Missouri, and as mentioned above, the
chert in the Sallisaw is virtually indistinguishable, at least
in a couple of localities, from cherts that have been
identified as Penters.
An outcrop located immediately to the west of Don
Dickson's home has been identified as Penters in one of
the field work sheets prepared by the Arkansas
Geological Commission. Materials of identical
megascopic comparison have been found near Noel,
Missouri, at a locality referred to as the Chrisman
quarries (Figure 1.3) by Dickson and Spears. Even the
"eyes" occurring in the chert that have been considered
distinctive to the Sallisaw or the locally applied name,
Barren Fork (Banks 1984:80) are also present. Although
Dickson believes the chert is Penters and physical
comparisons seem to be identical, it must be pointed out
that the term Penters is not used in Missouri, and the
specific area of this outcrop is shown as Keokuk (Fellows
1979). Croneis (1930:36) refers to the Penters, which was
named by Miser (1922:32-34) from outcrops near
Penters, Arkansas, as being about 90 feet thick and as "a
dense, massive, light gray to bluish gray chert which
breaks with a conchoidal fracture".
Wise and Caplan (1979:7) state that although the
Penters is widespread in the subsurface, "it crops out in
Arkansas only in area around Batesville in Independence
County". There they describe the chert as being
"brownish-gray to blue-gray, dense to translucent ... with
thin inter beds of dolomitic limestone". In the same
reference they cite the area between Penters Bluff and
Biltmore Switch in Izard and Independence counties as
being the best exposures of the Penters, and they refer to
the Penters as being equivalent to the Camden Chert of
Tennessee, Clear Creek chert of Missouri, the Sallisaw of
Oklahoma, and the lower portion of the Arkansas
Novaculite of Oklahoma and Arkansas. The unpublished
field reconnaissance map prepared by the Arkansas
Geological Commission in the vicinity of Dickson's home
calls into question the statement by Wise and Caplan
concerning the distribution of Penters outcrops. The
same analogy could be applied to the Chrisman quarry
area because there are no detailed geological reports

18

available for that area (McDonald county, Mo.). Also,
the reader is directed to Thompson and Fellows (1969)
for a better understanding of the confusion of the
formational terminology still in use in Missouri as it
applies to the chert-bearing formations. Just because the
name Penters is not used in this adjacent area of Missouri
does not mean that the same rock type does not exist.
At the Chrisman qu'arries, the chert crops out
horizontally in the hillsides (Figure 1.4) in beds varying
from a few centimeters up to perhaps 20 cm in thickness.
The chert seems to have been obtained primarily by
removing the rock from the ledges cropping out on the
sides of the hills above both sides of a small unnamed
tributary of Elk River that flows northwestwardly to its
confluence in the vicinity of Noel. The slopes of the hills
and intervening draws are completely covered with
debitage along with associated hammerstones and
discarded and broken preforms (Figure 1.5). The chert is
obtainable as large pieces of excellent and flaw-free
quality as attested to by knappers such as Spears and
Dickson. Spears consistently produces eight to ten inch
dart points from the stone (Figure 1.2). According to

Oklahoma were manufactured
fi:om the Sallisaw chert, and
theoretically the source of the
rock for that statement was
intended for the Sallisaw
outcrops on the Tenkiller
River. However, the
magnitude
of
quarrying-workshop activities
reflected in the Chrisman
quarries suggests, as Dickson
believes, that many of the
artifacts found downstream
along the Elk and Tenkiller
Rivers may well have been
derived from the Chrisman
quarry vicinity. Use of the
Penters-Sallisaw cherts was
not restricted by any means to
any particular period of time.
A large percentage of the
Sallisaw points and others to a
lesser degree, discussed and
illustrated by J. A. Brown
(1976:83-86) from the Craig
Mound at Spiro, are made of
the same chert (personal
examination). However in the
smaller pieces and even some
of the larger ones, the "eyes"
mentioned as a distinctive
characteristic of the Sallisaw
are not present.
The identification of the
(ormation at the Chrisman
quarries is of considerable
importance to archeology in
this region because of the
prehistoric reliance on this
specific outcrop for stone
tools.

Blackgum
The type locality for the
Blackgum Formation is near
the town by the same name in
Figure 1.5. Closeup of Christman quarry debitage. Note hammerstone above lens

cap and dark (manganese dioxide staining) preform in left center of photo.
(Amsden and Rowland

heat-treated it possesses the pinkish gray colors
1965:62; Oklahoma Water Resources Board, Region IX
characteristic of other similarily light colored cherts. It is
1971:14,16). There is possibly less information available
mentioned elsewhere (Banks 1984:81) that an unusally
for the chert derived from the Blackgum Formation than
large number of Dalton and Dalton-like points in eastern
for any other chert type being discussed in this section. It

19

is described by Amsden and Rowland (1965:27) as being
"generally common to abundant [in the tan dolomite
member] and as vitreous, light-colored chert showing
considerable fossil debris in thin section". The Blackgum
crops out only in very restricted exposures near
Blackgum Landing on Lake Tenkiller, and a short
distance west of Qualls, Oklahoma. The chert occurs as
thin lenticular beds and as nodules as illustrated in Plate
II of The Amsden-Rowland report (1965:Plate II, Figure
2). The basal member of the Blackgum is the Pettit Oolite
that is localized within the formation itself. "Where
present it is less than 2 feet thick [between the Sylvan
Shale and the overlying Blackgum and] partial or
complete silicification of the Pettit is common. At
Blackgum Landing the entire member is almost
completely silicified" (Amsden and Rowland 1965:22).
Though the chert and the silicified oolite in the Blackgum
is relatively minor in comparison to other chert types in
the area, better identification of the rocks and definition
of cultural usage is much needed in the Tenkiller River
area. Their usage has not been reported in archeological
literature from the area.
Joe Winters, Tulsa, has informed the writer of finding
high quality blue chert in an as yet unidentified formation
immediately northwest of Qualls, Oklahoma. Whether
this chert is associated with the Blackgum rocks has yet to
be determined.
Perhaps a generic analogy to normal geological
descriptions of chert-bearing formations can be made in
this particular case where Fay and Roberts (1971:24)
simply refer to the Blackgum as being 0-35 ft (0-11 m) in
thickness and as a "dark gray to black cherty, glauconitic,
fossiliferous limestone and dolomite, with a 0- to
three-foot bed of Pettit Oolite at the base". Based on this
brief description and in the absence of Amsden and
Rowland's reference to light-colored chert, the Blackgum
theoretically would sound much like a description of the
Pitkin or Bayou Manard types.

Frisco
The Frisco was first mentioned by Reeds (1911) as a
part of discussion of the Bois d' Arc Formation in the
Arbuckle Mountains, and correlation was extended to
the beds in northeastern Oklahoma in Sequoyah county
by Cram (1930:550). Reeds did not specifically discuss a
type section for the Frisco, and it was not until 1957 that
one was designated by Amsden (1957:47). The type
locality is in the vicinity of Frisco in Pontotoc county,
Oklahoma.
In northeastern Oklahoma, Amsden (1960:43)
describes the best outcrops of the Frisco as being along
Sallisaw Creek just north of Marble Falls. The chert in
the formation, however, is only mentioned (Amsden
1960:30) as being "rare, but some beds do include nodules
up to 2 or 3 inches long". Huffman (1958:33) refers to the
20

Frisco in the flanks of the Ozarks as being 0-7 feet in
thickness and that "locally sandy, cherty, and dolomitic
beds may be present". Obviously its influence as a
chert-bearing resource in the Ozarks is much less than in
the Arbuckles. In fact there are no adequate descriptions
of chert in th.e Ozark outcrops from either published
literature or personal communications with others that
compare favorably with those in the Arbuckles as
illustrated in Appendix A, Plate 13. The writer has not
personally collected materials from the Frisco outcrops
in northeastern Oklahoma.

St. Joe
The St. Joe was originally named the St Joe Marble by
J.C. Branner (Hopkins 1893:253). Hopkins does not
discuss a type locality for the formation and Girty (1915)
placed the type locality 1.5 miles west of St. Joe,
Arkansas. At the type locality the formation is from
25-40 feet (9-14 m) thick according to Hopkins, but
Thompson and Fellows (1969:39) cite a thickness at the
same locality of 75 feet (26 m). Both Hopkins and
Thompson and Fellows mention the absence of chert in
the formation at the same locality.
As referenced by Thompson and Fellows (1969:37-42)
the St. Joe carries group status in Oklahoma that includes
the Compton, Northview, and Pierson formations. In
Arkansas, it is recognized as the lowermost member of
the Boone Formation, and in Missouri Thompson and
Fellows apply the term as a lateral equivalent of the
Compton, Northview and Pierson formations. Scattered
chert nodules and beds are reported by Thompson and
Fellows (1969:41) as being in the Compton Member.
Chert is much more common in the Pierson Member
where it is nodular and lenticular and is interbedded with
the much more predominant limestone. The St. Joe as a
whole is described by Thompson and Fellows (1969:39)
as a "brick red to red and green mottled crinoidal to
coarsely crinoidal limestone".
The formation typically results in bluff-forming
exposures. At Crystal Lake near Decatur, Arkansas,
severely potted bluff shelters occur in the Chattanooga
Shale underlying the St. Joe. In the walls and ceilings of
the shelters highly fractured nodules and lenses of the
chert occur (Figures 1.6 and 1.7). The chert tends to be
brittle, but was certainly well used by prehistoric
inhabitants. Dickson has collected chert from the St Joe
at numerous widespread localities across the Ozarks, and
can with some reliance determine subtle differences
between the eastern and westernmost outcrops. As one
travels eastward from the Oklahoma state line, the cherts
tend to become redder in color. At Beaver Lake St Joe
materials collected by Dickson are opaque, gray to red in
color, and small pinpoint vugs seem to be very common
(Figure 1.8).

Boone/Keokuk/Bmrllington!Elsey

The variety and volume of cherts included in this
section are predominant above all others as a raw
material for tool production in the Ozarks (Figures
1.10-1.11 and Appendix A, Plate 2). The type localities
for the Burlington and the Keokuk formations are from
the respective cities in Iowa by the same names. They
were both named by Owen (1852). The term Boone is
derived from a locality in Boone county, Arkansas, and
according to Croneis (1930:43) was named by J.C.
Branner. Snider (1915) recognized Keokuk fossils in the
Boone of Arkansas in 1914, and in Laudon's (1937)
studies the term Keokuk was applied to the chert beds
above the Reeds Spring Formation in Missouri. The
chert-bearing units of the Keokuk were divided into the
Grand Falls and Joplin Members by Winslow
(1894:411-419). However, the variations of chert within
the Grand Falls alone are not well enough described for
distinction from one another within the Member itself,
much less as being distinctive
from chert in the Joplin or the
overlying Tahlequah Member of
the Moorefield, which in many
cases is seemingly indistinct
from the white chert in the
upper Keokuk. It is worth
noting that the well-known
Crescent Quarries located in St.
Louis are in the Burlington
Formation.

not shown individually.
The Reeds Spring Formation was named for outcrops
south of the town of Reeds Spring, Missouri in Stone
County (Moore 1928:190). It was originally defined by
Moore as the Reeds Spring Limestone of the Boone
Formation, and was elevated
formational status by
Cline in 1934 (Thompson and Fellows 1969:27). In
several geological publications the inability to readily
distinguish between the limestones of the Reeds Spring
and the overlying Keokuk Formations is commonly
expressed. The cherts, however, can be differentiated
with a considerable degree of reliability solely on the
basis of comparative analysis. The Reeds Spring cherts
do not occur in as massive deposits as the Keokuk, the
coloration is not as varied, and the overall quality is not as
good. While small artifacts of the Reeds Spring could be
readily produced, larger ones are very rare. In many
instances incompletely chertified limestone blebs and
occlusions occur (Figure 1.9) that make consistent flaking

and as followed in this report, Thompson and Fellows
(1969:34) contin.ue to use the more refined formational
terms recognized in. the tri-state area in. correlation to a
letter-designation series adapted from Robertson
(1967:Fig. 1) that is modified for inclusion here (Table
1.1). The name Elsey was used to replace the term
"Grand Falls" by Robertson (1967:13) because he and
most other geologists consider the Grand Falls
designation applicable only to localized deposits at the
falls located on Shoal Creek. Robertson (1967:14) refers
to the chert in the Elsey Formation as being
very distinctive. Always present is a white to
grayish white chert which has prominent, very
irregular brown mottled areas and contains
comparatively large circular spots one
sixteenth to one quarter of an inch in. diameter.
Darker brown or gray cherts similar to those of
Reeds Spring, and lighter porous cherts
characteristic of the cherts of the over-lying
Burlington-Keokuk may also occur within the
Elsey Formation.
While this description does not seem to describe the
type materials normally known as Keokuk or Boone, it
may well be very useful for archeological distinctions in
the southwestern portion of Missouri. Just how
widespread the Elsey crops out is not well defined at this
time. It is suggested here that the generic term Keokuk
continue being used for cherts that have commonly been
recognized by that name. The discussions by Robertson
and by Thompson and Fellows exemplify the confusion
that does and nndoubtedly will continue to exist on cherts
in the area. Thompson and Fellows (1969:35-37) discuss
problematic, but rather distinctive cherts cropping out in
the vicinity of Anderson, in McDonald county, Missouri,
that they were unable to assign by formation. Specimens
of a similar description were provided to the writer by
Don Dickson, also collected in the same area, for
assistance in identification, which did not materialize.
Conodonts identified in the rocks by Thompson and
Fellows (1969:35) indicate an age correlative to the Elsey,
Reeds Spring and Keokuk formations. The chert is
associated with a black limestone, but the chert itself is
very briefly described (Thompson and Fellows 1969:35)
as "a body of white to gray tripolitic, opaque chert that
covers considerable area".
In this study area there are no exposures of the
complete Keokuk/Burlington rocks at any one locality.
Therefore the descriptions of the chert within the same
formations may or may not be precisely the same as the
rocks in another outcrop occurring elsewhere. However
at a single outcrop of the Keokuk located on Don
Dickson's property near Decatur, Arkansas, hereafter
referred to as Dickson's bluff, there are discernable
distin.ctions in the chert from top to bottom of the roughly
thirteen or fourteen meter-thick exposure (Figure 1.12).
In the lower portions of the outcrop the chert is more

uniformly colored in light grayish shades th.at lack the
typical mottling of other Keokuk rocks (Figure l.10b an.d
1.11). In the mid-sections of Dickson's bluff, the rocks
are classic examples of what is normally well- recognized
as "Boone" or Keoku.k chert. ][n the uppermost section of
the bluff the chert grades into a light gray or white chert
(Figure l.10a) that is similar in appearance to the
Tahlequah chert of the Moorefield Formation to be
discussed later.
Two of the more interesting caches of artifacts related
to outcrops of the Keokuk are those of Afton Springs
obtained by Holmes and one reportedly found by a Dr.
Barnard of Delaware County that contained 22,000
pieces (Holmes 1919:208~209). Holmes further stated
that the 22,000 piece cache was composed of two
different chert types (presumably Keokuk and
Tahlequah) that were stratigraphicaly separated with
"those found near the surface ... [made ] of the material
quarried in the Ottawa County [Peoria ] quarries while
those at a lower depth are of the flint found in an old river
bed near the cache". It is quite possible that the two
different types came from a single source as typified by
the Dickson bluff, but nevertheless attempts to locate and
reexamine the collection might be a very worthwhile
effort for those interested in chert industries in general.
The Afton Springs cache was removed from the spring
itself by Holmes, and estimated to have included some
"1,000 projectile points, knives, blades and other forms of
implements ... that had been deposited, doubtless, as an
offering to the superior powers. The chert is of fine
quality, white or mottled bluish-grays, and may have
been derived from quarries in the immediate region"
(Holmes 1919:208-209). The Afton Springs cache is
located at the Smithsonian today, but has not been a
subject of examination since Holmes placed the
collection there.
It is somewhat surprising that well-established,
site-specific quarries of the Keokuk do not seem to occur
in numbers commensurate with the potential natural
resources available. For example, the type locality of the
Grand Falls chert at the Grand Falls on Shoal Creek
south of Joplin where massively bedded chert occurs is
not mentioned anywhere in relationship to its potential as
a specific source of raw material used for tool
production. The outcrops were certainly available to
potential users in prehistoric time. Was chert from the
outcrop or from the creek bed of the immediate vicinity
utilized in a manner similar to Afton Springs? That
possibility exists. It is possible, as Don Dickson believes,
that specific quarries were unnecessary for procurement
of the Keokuk cherts, but that same analogy could be
applied to any of the other major outcrops where
quarries do exist. What are the differences?

excavations at a bluff shelter site (3CR89) near the Kings

Problems of nomenclature and difficulties in
distinguishing between the whitish chert of the upper
Keokuk and the overlying Tahlequah in specific
reference to the chert in the Peoria quarries in Ottawa
County have been previously discussed in some detail
(Banks 1984:81-82). As a result of that discussion and as
repeated here, the quarries are "considered as outliers of
the Tahlequah member of the Moorefield until and if
future geological research in the immediate area proves
otherwise". The Tahlequah member, though not
identified as such at the time, contains one of the
principal chert quarries of earliest mention in
archeological literature. The quarries were first discussed
by Holmes in 1919 who credits W.P. Jenney with
reporting them to the Geological Survey in 1891 under
the locally known name of Spanish Diggings (Holmes
1919:201). Referred to as being in the

termination a short distance east of Moorefield,
Arkansas. In Oklahoma, the Moorefield has been
subdivided into four members (Huffman 1958:49). Two
of the four, the Tahlequah and the Bayou Manard
contain variable quantities of chert. The Lindsey Bridge
member is also referenced as a "chert-pebble calcarenite
facies" (Huffman 1958:49), but of lesser importance in
this discussion. The distribution and occurrence of chert
in the outcrops as a whole is undetermined. The
chert-bearing members are quite distinctive from each
other, the differences being the white Tahlequah chert
and the black Bayou Manard, but distinctions between
the Tahlequah chert and the underlying and uppermost
member of the Keokuk are less easily made. Of the two
members, the Tahlequah is certainly of greater
significance in archeology because of the basic
differences in character of the two chert types.
Tahlequah
The Tahlequah is described as "a massive, light to dark
gray, medium-crystalline, glauconitic limestone
[containing] nodules and stringers of whitish-tan chert"
between 0-35 feet in thickness (Huffman 1958:50).

the more amenable sources of the rock for stone tool
production, large quantities of the chert in this form are
not well known either.
The chert is consistently black, densely aphanic, and
usually has a waxy luster (see Appendix A, Plate 2).
White fossil fragments of crinoids and possibly bryozoans
are fairly common, but may not occur in smaller pieces. It
is also consistently opaque. The results of the
archeological survey of the Bayou Manard basin by Drass
(1981) tends to substantiate Huffman's restriction of
chert in the formation to the Grand River area. Drass
does not report a single site of specific relationship to a
Bayou Manard outcrop during his survey of the basin,
and in the numerous illustrations of artifacts there are
only three possible specimens that could possibly be
identified as the Bayou Manard chert. The absence of
references to chert in the Moorefield outside of
Oklahoma is certainly indicative that outcrops of the
formation in Arkansas are chert-free. However, it does
not seem logical that the Tahlequah outliers so close to
the Missouri and Arkansas state lines would be totally
restricted to Oklahoma.

WaJrsaw
The type locality of the Warsaw is near Warsaw,
Illinois, and according to Moore (1928:229) was named
by Jam es Hall in 1856 and published in 1857 (Hall
1857:187-203) in application to strata above the Keokuk.
Moore (1928:230) makes distinctions between the
Keokuk and the Warsaw primarily on the basis of fossils.
The formation is reported by Moore (1928:232) to be
about 100 feet (30 m) thick in southwest Missouri with
chert occurring "in nodules or in bands, and... essentially
like that in associated Mississippian formations". In the
same reference Moore refers to the Short Creek Oolite at
the base of the Warsaw as being "2-8 feet thick and of a
bluish-gray color". The only Warsaw outcrops familiar to
the writer are those located along a prominent
southeast-northwest trending ridge paralleling the
southwest side of an unnamed tributary of Clear Creek
south of Pierce City, Missouri. At the time of the visit to
this locality in the early 1970s, shallow and sporadic but
numerous quarry pits still existed in the wooded portion
of the northward facing slope of the ridge. Other quarry
pits that had been present farther to the south, but at the
time located in a field cleared by the owner-farmer, had
been essentially obliterated. The chert was fossiliferous
(primarily crinoidal), opaque, and (as well as
remembered - specimens seem not to have been
collected) ranged from a light gray, pale blue-gray to light
brown. Mottling was subtle. Light-colored cherts also are
common in the creek bed to the east-northeast of the
ridge.

. Bayou Manard
. The Bayou Manard was named by Huffman (1958:51)
from exposures along the Bayou Manard tributary of the
Illinois River. The formation averages about 20 m (65 ft)
in thickness (Huffman 1958:51). Here, too, as at the type
locality of the Moorefield, chert is not present. In fact,
Huffman mentions the presence of black chert nodules as
only in exposures along the Grand River in
and Wagoner counties, Oklahoma.
The chert in the Bayou Manard rocks along the west
side of the Grand River occurs as small to large tightly
embedded nodules. Some are relatively free of fractures,
but are almost impossible to remove by hand from their
limesfone host rock. This may account for the fact that
large artifacts of the material do not seem to have been
reported. Though gravels undoubtedly provided some of

29

Pitkin
The Pitkin was originally referred to as the
Archimedes Limestone because of the numerous
screw-like central supports of the bryozoan Archimedes
scattered over the surface exposures of the formation.
It was later named Pitkin for the Pitkin post office in
Washington County, Arkansas (Croneis 1930:73).
The formation crops out from the vicinity of
Batesville, Arkansas, to near Muskogee, Oklahoma.
Croneis (1930:73) reports its thickness as varying from 2
feet (0.3 m) to its maximum thickness of over 100 feet
(30 m) at the south end of Boats Mountain near
Bellefont, Arkansas. It is also of interest that Croneis
does not mention chert being a constituent of the Pitkin
lithology. The formation as described in detail by
Easton (1942) crops out along and parallel to the more
southerly portions of the mountains from eastern
Oklahoma across the mountains to the exposures
immediately west of the confluence of the Black and
White rivers. Chert occurs more sporadically as a
constituent of the lithology in the Pitkin Formation than
in the other chert-bearing formations of the area.
Easton (1942:20) notes that chert occurs in isolated
localities in either the top or bottom of the formation,
but he (Easton 1942:9) also mentions that in some
localities the beds may be half chert. He references the
"cave at Cave Point" (Easton 1942:50) located east of
Mountain View as an example. As pointed out by Erwin
(n.d.:5-6) and John House (1975:85), it is difficult to
predict where chert occurs in the Pitkin Formation
without relying upon fieldwork. Both quarries and
workshops are present, however, in the easternmost
edge of the Pitkin outcrops west of Oil Trough,
Arkansas. The location of the chert exposures adjacent
to the Mississippi lowlands was of strategic importance
to the lithic industries reflected in the Cache River basin
(House 1975:87-90).
The Pitkin chert is uniformly dark gray to black (Figure
1.17 and Appendix A, Plate 2) and sometimes exhibits
tiny spots and fragmented fossils of white. In this regard,
distinctions between the Pitkin and the Bayou Manard
may be difficult, if not impossible, solely on the basis of
megascopic comparisons. Dickson (personal
communication) has found that some of the materials
collected from the Payne Hollow locality are essentially
identical to the Bayou Manard. However, some general
criteria that work most of the time is that the Bayou
Manard chert often, but not always, exhibits a waxier
luster, a more dense matrix, and more common
fragments of fossils. Crinoid fragments appear to be
especially common when fossils are present. Occasionally
the Bayou Manard contains blue quartz (as filling of
well-healed fractures) that does not seem to occur in the
Pitkin.

Atoka
The Webbers Falls siltstone (Blythe 1959:18-20) is
possibly restricted to a fairly small area in the vicinity of
Webbers Falls, Oklahoma, and extends eastward into
northwestern Arkansas. It is one of the more distinctive
and widely reported non-chert rock types used for tool
production along the southwestern edge of the Boston
Mountains. For purposes here, the most relevant
discussions of this material are found in Schneider (1967)
and Jurney (1981). The article by Jurney is especially
useful for its discussion of the rock as a potential medium
of trade, a more thorough discussion of its geographic
and geologic distribution than found elsewhere, and its
use as a specialized tool form related to horticulture and
other digging activities. The stone is most commonly
associated with the large bifacially flaked "hoes" (Figure
1.18) generally attributed to Late Woodland and
Caddoan occupations. It is interesting that the siltstone
has not been reported from the Atoka outcrops in the

limited, has not been observed to contain these
apparently distinctive wisps. Also in the finer pieces of
Trace Creek rocks, the silica content is high enough to
produce a black-dark blue chert-like appearance in
texture and a slight luster that does not seem to be
readily apparent in the Webbers Falls siltstone or
argillite.
The broader issues related to this particular rock type,
i.e., the need for refined sourcing and distinction from
similar-appearing types raised by Jurney, still need
resolution. For example, although analytical analyses are
not available at this time, the visual similarity of material
types from some of the "Duck River Flint swords"
(Brown 1976:158-166) from the Spiro site identified as
being of Fort Payne (Dover Quarry) Chert in
comparison to better grades of the Webbers Falls or
Trace Creek siltstone (personal examination) suggests
that a more critical examination for the identification of
the Duck River swords may be in order, even though
Brown was quite confident of the reliability of the earlier
identifications (personal communication). They
certainly may be from the Dover Quarry sources, but
without having the benefit of analytical comparisons,
that may be questioned.
Another material type reported by Blythe (1959:19)
from the Atoka Formation that warrants mention is the
green chert occurring in thin (six inch thick) lenses and
composed largely of silicified sponge spicules and
echinoid spines. The green chert is attributed. to
outcrops located 1.6 km (1 mi) east of Wagoner,
Oklahoma. This material does not seem to have been
reported as artifacts in any of the archeological literature,
but it deserves recognition simply for the fact that it is
present in the area.

Special Problematic Cherts in the Ozarks
One of the more notable "unidentified" cherts known
to occlir in the Ozarks is a distinctive green material that
is commonly found in archeological assemblages in sites
occurring fom the general vicinity of Hindsville,
Arkansas, eastward as far as Searcy county. A relatively
high percentage of the chert types represented in site
3MA4, excavated by George Sabo, are made of this
material. Joe Winters, of Tulsa, and Don Dickson
(personal communications) have observed the material
on sites in Searcy county. Cultural usage is known to date
from Dalton into late Mississippian time. This is most
certainly the same material referred to as Newton county
jade by Lafferty et al. (1988:368).
The chert occurs in colors ranging from a pale
gray-green to apple green, and occasionally contains
pinkish purple tinges that may be more a result of
weathering rather than a characteristic of the raw
material. Although the rock type. exhibits good
conchoidal fracture and is relatively free of flaws in small
pieces, tiny pinpoint vugs and sometimes tiny molds of
31

fossil (crinoid?) fragments are common. Because green
chert seems to have been highly regarded for certain tool
types such as dart and arrow points, any such stone
warrants special recognition for its potential represented
in trade or ceremonial contexts. In the general area of site
3MA4, rocks of the St. Joe and the Powell Dolomite
formations are predominant. Chert is not a commonly
recognized constituent in the Powell Dolomite, but this
possibility should not be disregarded yet. Greenish gray
shale occurs in the lower St. Joe Formation, and some of
the pinkish-red mottling in the green chert is reminiscent
of the pinkish reds in the St. Joe. The St. Joe Formation
seems to be a likely candidate for the green chert. The
rock type does deserve special attempts at definitive
identification.
Northeast of Grove, Oklahoma, along the Carr Branch
tributary of Elk River, Jim Spears and Don Dickson have
found large cobble to small bouider size rocks of a very
fine quality, opaque, tan to light brown chert that
apparently occurs in place as colluvium above the
underlying bedrock. Marcher and Bingham (1971) shows
the area as consisting of undifferentiated Keokuk, Reeds
Spring, and St. Joe rocks, but the relationship between
the bedrock and the cobbles is uncertain at this time. If
the cobbles are of a natural rather than some type of a
historically introduced material, such a source of a
unique geologically unidentified chert is of some
importance in the area. Spears has produced a number of
dart points from the material as illustrated in Figure 1.19.
The material does not seem to have been reported in the
form of artifacts from sites in the vicinity, but this
apparent absence should not be a serious consideration
of disregard for the rock as a potential lithic resource at
this time.

The Little Ozarks

The geographic area lying between the Flint Hills and
the flanks of the Ozarks would seem to be more properly
discussed as a part of the Great Plains section of this
report, but it fits geologically between the two
physiographic regions (the rocks are of intermediate or
Pennsylvanian age). Also, the eastern-most portion of the
region is included in an area of southeast Kansas often
referred to as the Little Ozarks (Rawlinson 1980:7).
Like the formations in the Flint Hills to the west, the
formations crop out along a north-northeast to
south-southwest axis. The formations in the Little Ozarks
extend completely across the state of Kansas from the
Iowa-Nebraska-Missouri juncture and into Oklahoma as
far south as the Arkansas River. (See Kenneth Reid
[1980a] for a discussion of some of the same chert types
to the north of this study area.)
In this study area the cherts are rather poorly known
and recorded in archeological literature. This results
from several factors, but most critically from the fact that
the Pennsylvanian cherts (Moore 1949) occur within
reasonably close proximities to the Mississippian-aged
types of the Ozarks and the Permian-aged Flint Hills
types, both of which are superior to those being discussed
here. Also, the chert in these southernmost exposures of
the formations are not as common to the overall lithology
as they are to the north, and the formations themselves
tend to thin to the south. At the Big Hill project in
Labette county, Kansas, the Bethany Falls Limestone
crops out in the left abutment of the dam. Chert was
observed there, but unfortunately not collected, by Banks
and Tom Witty in the mid-1970s. Recollections are that it
was quite common on the hill slopes, was fossiliferous,
was of brownish, tan, and gray
colors, was relatively brittle, and
occurred primarily in relatively
small rectangular pieces. Quite
likely, this chert from the Bethany
Falls Formation is the same
material referred to in the later
archeological reports (Rawlinson
1977, 1980 and Thies 1982,
respectively) as "locally available
field chert". Thies does not Â·
identify the chert by formation,
but he (Thies 1982:42) is probably
describing the Bethany Falls
chert in a little better detail as
follows:
Field chert is bluish
gray or gray in color
and occasionally quite

angular chunks that are typically no larger than
fist sized. Cortex commonly covers much of the
exteriors of the chunks. The cortex is a hard,
orangish tan colored, iron-rich. limestone which
is usually heavily pitted or riddled through,
probably as a result of water erosion.

Arkansas River Gravels
Gravel bars and terrace deposits along the Arkansas
can be expected to produce chert pebbles and cobbles
from the large numbers of chert outcrops occurring in the
upper drainages. The problem of discrimination between
Â·materials obtained from direct exploitation of outcrops
versus the use of locally obtainable gravel sources is
particularly acute in the Arkansas. A principal factor in
such discrimination is more likely related to artifact
size/distance ratios from a specific source area than
anything else, although sizable cobbles may be found at
long distances from their source. The presence of
Alibates chert in Arkansas River gravels is especially
relevant in this discussion (Banks 1984:74), because
Alibates debitage, in minor amounts, has been found in
Â·.Â·â¢ archeological contexts as far to the southeast as Toltec
Mounds site near Little Rock. The possibility of
encountering rare items of Alibates in sites along the
more ancient channels of the Arkansas in southern
Arkansas and Louisiana (see geologic map in Saucier
1974) as a result of using local resources cannot be
arbitrarily dismissed. It is also of special interest to note
that Ozark-derived chert gravels in the Arkansas River
are mostly from the western flanks of the mountains in
Oklahoma rather than from the main portion of the
Boston Mountain.s in Arkansas. The major drainages out
of the Arkansas portion of the mountains, like those in
southern Missouri, are essentially restricted to sediments
in the White River drainage rather than the Arkansas.
The south-flowing tributaries of the Arkansas River in
Arkansas coming from the southern flanks of the
mountains are almost inconsequential in terms of
potential chert contributions in comparison to either the
Ozarks in Oklahoma or the northward and eastward
flowing tributaries from the Ouachita Mountains to the
south.

Ouachita Mountains
The Ouachita Mountains (Figure 1.20) rise above the
Gulf Coastal Plain at Little Rock, Arkansas, and extend
westward 402 km (250 mi) to Atoka, Oklahoma. They
average about 80 km (50 mi) in width. They consist of
individual ranges composed of ridge and valley
topography that is oriented east to west As a whole the
Ouachitas are comprised of elongated series of laterally
compressed canoe folds paralleling the axis of the
33

mountains from west to east. Because of this basic
structure, practically all of the rock formations strike
eastward and dip steeply, sometimes vertically, either to
the north or south of the axis of the particular anticlinal
fold or mountain chain in which they are located. The
formations in the mountains normally occur in long,
narrow, and sinuous outcrops that parallel the trend of
the ridges.
The crest of the mountains along the northern edge of
the province reaches a height of 366 m (1200 ft) above sea
level. From the east-west trending crest, the peneplained
tops of the mountains, or ridges, to the south are
successively lower in elevation until they intersect the
Gulf Coastal Plain along their southern boundary. The
basic topography produces a trellis drainage system
throughout the mountainous area. The ridges are
predominantly comprised of quartzitic sandstone
outcrops from the Jack Fork and Stanley groups, whereas
the intervening valley floors are in the shales from the
Jackfork and Stanley or from other formations of more
minor occurrence. The orogeny that built the mountains
and caused the complexly folded and highly fractured
rocks occurred in late Paleozoic time. Therefore, where
present the Mesozoic (primarily Cretaceous) rocks of
relatively horizontal strata lap onto and surround the
sides of the mountains. The chert-bearing formations of
the Ouachitas can be reasonably separated into eastern
and western groups although some, such as the Arkansas
Novaculite and the Big Fork Chert, are common to both.
(Typical specimens of the Arkansas Novaculite and other
cherts are illustrated in Appendix A, Plates 3-4.) The
formations are discussed in ascending order of age from
oldest to youngest.

Bigfork
Aside from the Arkansas Novaculite, which Purdue
(1909:39) cites as the predominant formation of the
Ouachita Mountains, the Bigfork Chert is the major
chert-bearing formation in the suite of Ouachita
formations. The others contain chert as a lithologic
constituent but not as the primary rock type. The type
locality of the Bigfork Chert was described by Purdue
(1909:35-36) for outcrops near the Big Fork post office in
the eastern edge of the headwaters of the Big Fork River
in Polk County, Arkansas. At the type locality, the rock is
as highly fractured as it is elsewhere. Purdue (1909:35)
described it as
a very close textured, even-bedded, silicious
[sic] rock, in layers from one to eighteen inches
thick, but the most common thickness is from
three to six inches. The color varies from a slate
to a dark gray, the former being most common.
It is very brittle, and under the blows of a
hammer, flies into small pieces. The fracture is
angular, in some of the layers approaching
conchoidal.

undulating layers. The layers are from 4 inches to as
much as three feet thick and the modal thickness is about
ten inches."
In the Potato Hills area, Pitt et al. (1982:14) states that
"the formation is almost entirely a black to dark-brown
chert", but they describe it as showing
color variations, being white, light blue, brown
or black where fresh, weathering to light or
dark brown. The fresh surface is dominantly
dark brown to black, thereby contrasting with
the white to apple-green color of the Arkansas
Novaculite. The chert beds normally are
separated by black carbonaceous shales 0.25 to
1 inch thick. The Bigfork locally contains many
graptoloites, thin white silica veins, and vugs of
asphalt....Many thin-section studies have been
made by Honess, Harlton, Goldstein, and
Hendricks, all of whom show that the chert
contains abundant sponge spicules and rare
carbonate rhombs.
Float material on the sides of the
hills near the type locality occurs
in lighter colors probably as a
result of weathering (personal
examination), but practically all of
the materials observed or collected
by the writer from Black Knob
Ridge to the type locality have
been light to medium gray (N6 to
N7), brownish gray (5YR4/2),
grayish brown (5YR3/2) and
moderate brown (5YR 5/4), and
dark gray (N3), and all are highly
fractured (see Figure 1.22). The
rocks are opaque although
occasionally references are made
to some of the rocks as
chalcedonic, suggesting some
degree of translucency. The luster
on a fresh break varies from dull to
a slight vitreousness. In weathered
rocks and in artifacts, banding is
quite common in shades of light to
McCurtain
medium gray colors. The
weathered variety that is often
reflected in artifacts has been
colloquially referred to as Stringtown chert.
In the overlying Polk Creek Shale, Pitt et al. (1982:15)
refer to the presence of "cherty and dolomitic casts 10
feet or more in length, eroded from the Bigfork".

Â·Â·. The formation averages some 183 to 213 m (600 to 700
{ft) in thickness from the vicinity of Atoka, Oklahoma, to
just west of Little Rock, Arkansas. Some of the better
, descriptions of the Bigfork Formation are found in
<Boness (1923), Hendricks et al. (1947), Miller (1955),
and Pitt et al. (1982). Honess (1923:74-78) described
what was probably the most complete and best outcrop of
, the Bigfork Chert. This outcrop is located on the
Mountain Fork River, but in a section that is now beneath
'. the waters of Broken Bow Lake. This particular outcrop
, ;contained a measured section of (127m) 416 feet in
'thickness, and Honess collected a large number of
\specimens from the exposure. In the accompanying
photographs (Figure 1.21 for example), the individual
. chert beds do not appear to be as quite as badly fractured
as they typically do elsewhere. Although this outcrop is
no longer available for examination, the collection made
by Honess, if it is still in existence, should prove to be a
valuable comparative collection for archeological

purposes. Honess (1923:74-79) describes the greatest
percentage of the chert as being dark brown to black, but
he refers (1923:74) to "one 8 11 thick bed of pearly gray,
calcareous, massive chert". On page 77 for whatever it is
worth, Honess makes a distinction between chert and
"flint". In the Beavers Bend State Park below Broken
Bow Dam some 7 km downstream from the exposures
described by Honess, Spradlin (1959:22) describes the
chert as "coal black, brittle, and bedded in distinct

as a formation is the description by Hendricks et al.
(1947), but they do not specifically mention it as the type

dark yellowish brovm (10YR5/4); and ( 4) a grayish brown
(5YR3/2) to black (Nl).
The cherts are all opaque and occur as jointed and
fractured beds, tightly embedded nodular lenses, and as
zones of silicification within a limestone host rock. There
is minor evidence in the vicinity that prehistoric
exploitation of this outcrop took place. It is more likely
that chert cobbles and pebbles were derived from
streams in the area for tool production. The Pinetop is
probably the same chert that has been described as
Zipper chert (Bobalilc 1977:44) and Type A (Lintz 1979:
29) in the Jackfork Valley.
The Pinetop crops out only in very isolated and
obscure exposures at the type locality and farther east
near Bengal, Oklahoma (Hendricks et al. 1947). It is
possibly of much greater significance as a lithic resource
in the Johns Valley Shale than in its original formation.
Though of limited areal extent, because of its generally
high quality, the chert is frequently found as artifacts in
the western Ouachitas.

description. The location of the outcrop discussed by
Hendricks et al. is in the northwestern edge of the
Ouachita Mountains where the Pinetop school house
used to be. This is on Pine Mountain south of the Brushy
Creek-Elm Creek confluences of the South Canadian
River basin. Near this same locality both the Woodford
and the Pinetop formations crop out in dose proximity to
each other. Hendricks et al. (1947) describe this locality
as "... .40 feet of chert that is mostly white and light gray
and contains some lenses of very fine grained, sparingly
fossiliferous limestone. Much of the chert weathers
brown and very porous". Road construction in the area
since 1947 has apparently altered the outcrop described
by Hendricks and others beyond recognition (Banks
1983:339), but at the same general vicinity four different
varieties of chert were described by Banks (1983:
340-341). A single typical specimen from the outcrop is
shown in Appendix A, Plate 4.
The four varieties are very briefly described as (1) a
mottled medium (N6) to light gray (NS); (2) a more
uniformly colored grayish blue (5PB5/2) with moderate
yellowish brown staining (10YR5/4) that gives the rock a
golden hue; (3) an unusual and atypical multicolored very
light gray (N8), moderate pink (5R7/4), moderate red
(5R5/4), reddish brown (10R4/6), light red (5R6/6) and

The novaculite quarries in the eastern Ouachitas were
among the first such prehistoric site types to be
referenced in published literature. The earliest reference
made to the presence of novaculite, although it was not
called novaculite at the time, was during the William
Dunbar expedition of the lower Red and Ouachita river
valleys instigated by Thomas Jefferson in 1804. Dunbar's
December 13 journal entry (Rowland 1930:278) states:
The top of this ridge is in a manner crowned by
rocks of a flinty kind, so very hard as to be
improper for gun flints; when applied to that
purpose it very soon digs out cavities in the
hammer of the lock. This hard stone is
generally white but frequently clouded with
red, brown, black or some other colours, and
no doubt in the hands of a practical
mineralogist, would receive a variety of
denominations such as agate, jasper,
calcedony, carnelian and perhaps some of the
adamantine genus.
From earlier letters written to Jefferson by Dunbar
such as the June 9, 1804, letter (Rowland 1930:133-135)
and others discussing plans for the expedition on the
"Wichita" [sic] River, it is obvious that knowledge of the
peculiar rock and perhaps the quarries had been passed
on. from hunters and earlier settlers in the area. In the
June letter he mentions the variety of unusual natural
resources or "curious items", known to be in the area
among which were "Quarries of freestone, slate, [and]
mineral Coal". Dunbar surprisingly did not mention the
quarry pits although he certainly should have recognized
them.

into tools are undetermined and unaccounted for in
terms of distribution. Conservatively, the amount of
novaculite taken from all the quarries combined must be
measured at least in hundreds of tons. It is presumed, but
not documented, that quarrying activities span the length
of human history in. the area. Again, there seems to be a
presumption, also undocumented, that most of the
intensive quarrying dates to the Mississippian/Caddoan
period.
Massive outcrops of novaculite also occur in the
headwaters of the Cossatot River at the upper end of

39

Gillham Lake in southwest Arkansas; along the Mountain
Fork River in Oklahoma; the Potato Hills area of
Oklahoma; and Black Knob Ridge east of Atoka,
Oklahoma. As shown in Figure 1.20, however, the
novaculite is not even restricted to these principal areas
by any means. While the outcrops on the Cossatot
appear to consist primarily of white to gray rock types,
the variety of materials and their geographic extent
remains unknown. Debitage and artifacts that are
probably derived from this particular outcrop occur in
sites throughout the Cossatot basin. The ridge tops have

not, to my knowledge, been examined for the presence of
quarry pi.ts. In the Oklahoma outcrops I have spent
considerable time examining exposures without fmding
evidence of actual quarrying in the novaculite, although
Rock Pile Mountain may have very well once contained
quarry pits that were obliberated by historic era activities.
In the Potato Hills an.cl at Black Knob Ridge, the
novaculite beds are severely warped and fractured
(Figures 1.27-1.28).

The type locality of the Woodford Formation was

Although there have been no attempts to use even
comparative analysis for discrimination of varieties of
novaculite among the better known sources of the rock
throughout the Ouachita Mountains, there appear to be
some distinctions of the more basic types from one area
to another. For example, the deposits near Hot Springs
contain individual pieces of larger sizes that are more
uniform in basic colors of yellow, gray, black, white, red,
and pink without the high degree of healed fractures and
mottling that seem to be more predominant in the more
westerly sources (Appendix A, Plate 3) . The Hot
Springs area cherts also seem to be of a generally finer
and more uniform texture than the others such as the
materials at Rock Pile Mountain on the east abutmen.t of
Broken Bow Dam and possibly those in the headwaters of
the Cossatot.

attributed to the Woodford (Hendricks et al. 1947 and
Miser 1954) have subsequently been determined by Hart
(1974, sheet No. 1) to be from the upper novaculite
(Banks 1983:343). The two formations are generally
considered to correlate in age.
In the western Ouachitas the Woodford crops out near
the Pinetop locality mentioned previously, and at six
other very isolated places (Figure 1.20) along the crest of
the Winding Stair Mountains. Near the Pinetop locality, I
collected four typical specimens that exhibit only slight
differences. For individual comparisons see Banks (1983:
346-347). The rocks varied in shades of medium gray
(NS), brownish black (5YR2/l), brownish gray (5YR4/1),

generally dull although one specimen had a slight
vitreous luster; they are opaque; vary in texture from

laminated but tight bedding (Figure 1.29). One specimen

nature. hon pyrite and iron-oxide staining is common
along fractures, weathered surfaces, and sometimes
parallel to laminae.

Stamey and Jackfork
The formations in both the Jackfork and Stanley
Groups contain unlimited quantities of quartzitic
sandstone that in many instances is fine enough for any

type of chipped stone tool. As such, the quartzitic
sandstones of the two groups represent by far the largest
quantity of lithic materials available in the Ouachitas for
stone tool production. Once removed from their point of
origin, however, it is essentially impossible to distinguish
the rocks as being from the Jackfork or the Stanley.
Virtually all of the stream beds in the mountains also
contain significant quantities of the quartzites. During
the 1983 field work associated with the lithic sourcing of
materials related to the Bug Hill archeological site, I
found that the quartzites originally derived from either
the Jackfork or the Stanley that were redeposited in the

Johns Valley shale was generally of superior quality for
knapping than are the types in the parent formations
themselves. The technical reasons for this phenomena
are not yet known.
Charles Wallis, archeologist with the Oklahoma
Conservation Commission, has located a series of
workshops adjacent to Jackfork outcrops in the Brushy
Creek drainage and along the Ti Valley in Pittsburg

County, Oklahoma (personal communication). The
material from these localities is very unique. The fine
grained quartzite has been fractured, presumably by
faulting, but then was well healed with silica cement. The
samples are quite distinctive from those of other known
Jackfork outcrops. Wallis (1985) describes them as "dark
brown to greenish gray; to gray and tan. Variegated veins
of sharply contrasting maroon to dark gray [occur]

These members of the Ten Mile Creek Formation are
composed of siliceous shales and chert and are not
massively bedded chert as some might think. In general
the cherts occur in relatively thin laminated beds that are
highly fractured and jointed. Individual chert pieces
therefore tend to be limited in size and are quite brittle.
The colors of the cherts are generically described by Pitt
et al. (1982:20) as "dark gray to black to bluish-black with
dark brown laminae ... and weather to lighter shades of
gray, with iron-oxide commonly coating the joint
surfaces". The cherts are also opaque and texturally vary
from aphanic to fine grained. The cherts often break with
a splintery fra.cture when being knapped. Relying solely
~pon ?arrat1~e .des~riptions it would be virtually
rmposs1ble to d1stingmsh the various Stanley cherts from
some of the Woodford and Bigfork types.
The Battiest Chert (Figure 1.30) is singled out here for
description. It generally exhibits a more pronounced
luster than the other cherts. In rare cases it is slightly
translucent on thin edges, and it generally seems to
contain a higher silica content than the other similar
cherts. In the outcrops examined by the writer the
Battiest more commonly contains well-healed hairline

.Pitt et al. 1982:19). The sediments deposited in the
.Ouachita geosynclinal trough that make up the Stanley
:group attained a total thickness in excess of 6858 m
Â· (22,500 ft). Now, the compressed rocks of the Group are
?divided into two formations, the lower Ten Mile Creek of
some 2743 to 4115 m (9,000 to 13,500 ft) in thickness and
: the upper Moyers of about 592 m (1,700 ft) in thickness
(Pitt et al. 1982:19). The Ten Mile Creek Formation is
lriformally divided into upper and lower members
separated by the Battiest Chert that was first defined as
the "Stanley black chert" by Honess (1923:192) and as the
.. "Smithville Lentil" by Miser and Honess (1927). It was
named the Battiest Chert by Shelburne (1960:18) from
outcrops near the town of Battiest in the Glover River
basin. Although the Battiest chert has considerable
i
prominence in the formation, there are other long known
zones of siliceous shale.s or cherts occur in the Stanley

limited success, he was able to make
distinctions over short distances but not
regionally. Presumably the same results
would apply to the cherts. Because of the
extensive outcrops of the Group as a whole
and the complexly folded and sometimes
discontinuous portions of the formations
from one area to another, it is very difficult
if not impossible, to define all of the specifi~
areas where the cherts in the outcrops do
occur. Selected areas can be defined
however.
In addition to the B.attiest Chert, the other
cherts now recogized in the Ten Mile Creek
and Moyers formations (Pitt et al.
1982:19-22) are:

fractures filled with white to bluish white quartz.
Individual artifacts of a small size, however, such as arrow
points may not exhibit the distinctive quartz-filled
fractures. The fracture varies from being brittle to
conchoidal. One possible attribute of the Battiest that
made it especially useful for manufacture of arrowpoints
is that it typically fractures perpendicular to the bedding
planes in thin sharp-edged slivers that are easily modified
to arrowpoints.

Moyers
The Moyers Formation separated from the overlying
Ten Mile Creek by the Battiest Chert contains a single
chert member at its base. The Schoolhouse Chert is
named for the schoolhouse in the town of Moyers that
lies directly east of the chert outcrop. The chert member
is 7 m (20 ft) thick. (Pitt et al. 1982:21). No descriptions
of the chert are provided by Pitt et al., and are assumed
to be similiar if not identical to the cherts in the Ten Mile
Creek.
Archeologically, there have been no recognizable
distinctions between any of the Ten Mile Creek cherts
with the possible exception of the Battiest. Indeed such
distinctions needed for discrimination in artifacts may
never be possible. All of the streams located in the
vicinities of the outcrops, wherever that may be, are likely
to contain the cherts also. Another factor that should at
least be recognized is that some of the more dense cherts
from the Stanley could be confused with rocks from the
Pitkin Formation in the Ozarks. In the Arkansas River
Valley between the two mountain systems (the Spiro site,
for example) distinctions between the two basic types
could become critical in archeological interpretations.
The Pitkin and the Stanley are probably lateral
equivalents as determined from paleontology (Pitt et al.
1982:22).
The indurated shales and siliceous shales, as
distinguished from associated cherts in the Stanley (and
the J ackfork for that matter), were also used for a variety
of tools as well as ornamental and perhaps ceremonial
artifacts such as gorgets, earspools, etc. (Banks
1984:91-92).

thickness from 24 to 122 m (80 to 400 ft). It is composed
of thin alternating and laminated beds of chert and fissile
shale. The Chickasaw Creek chert is considered unique
and distinctive from the other gray to black western
Ouachita cherts by all who are familiar with the geology
of the region. Its distinctiveness (Figure 1.31) stems from
the light gray to white blebs of opaline silica (Pitt et al.
1982:23) it contains. Pitt and others (1982:23) point out,
however, that this distinctiveness is lost in the formation
in outcrops to the east and in Arkansas. Also, they state
that the white blebs only occur in the two uppermost
chert beds of the formation cropping out in Section 30,
T2N,R22E.

Jackfork
Like the Stanley, the Jackfork was first defined by Taff
(1902). Also like the Stanley, this predominantly
quartzitic sandstone and shale group contains several
individual recognizable chert-bearing formations. The
lowermost Chickasaw Creek Formation is sometimes
placed in the upper Moyers of the Stanley Group, but
following Pitt et al. (1982:23) it is included here in the
Jackfork.

Wesley
The Wesley Formation was named by Harleton (1938:
886) near the town of Wesley in Atoka County. It has a
maximum thickness of about 152 m (500 ft) and is
composed of gray to blue gray shale with minor amonts of
chert. Pitt et al. (1982:28) describe the chert as being
"subrounded masses of dark-gray to black chalcedony
and lenses of chert and conglomerate". Although most of
the Ouachita cherts of this general description contain
some fossils, the Wesley cherts seem to exhibit more
spicules than do the others, but this observation may not
hold true uniformly.

Chickasaw Creek
This formation was named from the type locality
defined by Harlton (1938:874) along Chickasaw Creek in
Atoka County, Oklahoma. The formation varies in

MmrkhamMm
The Markham Mill Formation was named by Harleton
(1934:884) from LeFlore County exposures near a
sawmill by the same name. The formation is primarily a
shale, but it contains large exotic chert clasts similar to
the Johllls Valley Shale that will be discussed in greater
detail. In Banks (1984:Table 3.1, and pages 88, 89, and
91) the Markham Mill is misspelled as Markham Hill.
The formation crops out primarily across the northern
edge of the Winding Stair Mountains. The cherts in the
Markham Mill appear to be less abundant than in the
Johns Valley Shale, and possibly of lesser areal extent,
but that remains to be proven. Hart (1963:25-26)
provides what may be the best general discussion of the
Markham Mill cherts where he notes cobbles of chert
that are "black with a 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick rinds [sic] of a
white color" an.d he mentions "chert and flint boulders "
in sizes of 1.2x1.2 m ( 4x4 ft) in comparison to those
described by Shelburne (1960) of up 2.1 m (7 ft) in
diameter located in the top of the Wesley Formation."

the cherts they contain have been of limited archeological
recognition and perhaps of equally limited significance.
The cherts tend to be either tightly embedded in host
rock or so brittle as to be almost unusable for production
of stone tools. Nevertheless it is important to know the
basic characteristics of the cherts. In particular, some of
the better quality Wapanucka could be easily confused
with varieties of Keokuk chert from the western flanks of
the Ozarks (Figure 1.32). The chert in both formations is
spiculitic, but the spicules are more common in the
Wapanucka.

Wapainmcka aIDld Chickachoc

The Wapanucka was first defined by Taff (1902) for
outcrops in the eastern edge of the Arbuckles. Later,
however, Wallis (1915:30) referred to outcrops near the
town of Wapanucka as the type locality. The only
reference to chert in the early descriptions of the
formation is a vague one by Morgan who stated that the
formation is a "massive, white to light brown limestone
together with chert, sandstone, and shale strata" (Morgan
1924:57). No other descriptions of the chert were made.
In the Ouachita Mountains, however, Hendricks et al.
(1947) do describe the chert in some detail, and Wallis
(1915) is the best single source for discussion of the
formation in general. For archeological purposes,
individual chert varieties in the formation were described
by Banks (1983:357-360).
The earliest reference found by the writer to the
Chickachoc chert is in the discussion of the Atoka
Formation by Morgan (1924:63) where he mentions "a
chert bed known as the Chickachoc Chert lentil occurs in
the lower part of the formation where it outcrops in the
southern part of the Coalgate and northern part of the
Atoka Quadrangles". Like the Wapanucka, the
Chickachoc is possibly best described geologieally by
Hendricks et al. (1947) and the specific cherts they
contain are described by Banks (1983:359-360).
These two formations are sometimes considered to be
lateral equivalents. However, in the northwesternmost
section of the Ouachitas both formations crop out
parallel to each other but are separated by the Katy Club
Fault (Hendricks et al. 1947:Sheet 1). Both are primarily
limestone formations containing varying amounts and
qualities of chert. The best exposures I've examined are
those south of Pittsburg, Oklahoma. Although four pages
are devoted to these formations by Banks (1983:357-360),

Johns Valley Shale
The Johns Valley Shale was named by Ulrich (1927:
21-22) from exposures in the western Ouachita
Mountains. According to Ulrich (1927:21) the
Wapanucka and Caney formations were described as a
single formation by Taff (1902) from a type locality at the
small settlement (Caney) six miles north of Eubanks,
Oklahoma. The name of the settlement was changed to
Johns Valley subsequent to 1902, and the name of the
formation was changed accordingly by Ulrich at the same
time the Wapanucka and Johns Valley formations were
described individually. The formation, like the Markham
Mill, Caney, and Delaware Creek Shale formations, does
not contain bedded or lensoidal chert as a principal
constituent, but it does contain chert that makes the

Johns Valley Formation one of the more unusual
geological occurrences of chert as a natural resource for
lithic industries. More importantly it is perhaps the most
important single source of chert in the western
Ouachitas.
The origin of exotic boulders in the various shales, and
particularly the Johns Valley, have long been a subject of
debate (Rea 1947:47-49). The theories all concern the
location of the ancestral Ouachita Mountains referred to
as Bengalia and a series of uplifts associated with distinct
regional fault blocks, but there are some major
differences in published reports that bear directly upon
accurate identification of lithic materials in the western
Ouachitas. Rea (1947:47) describes the Johns Valley
Shale as extending from Atoka, Oklahoma, eastward for
200 km (125 mi) to near Boles, Arkansas. On page 49,
Rea discusses the origins of the erratics in the Johns
Valley as:
... formations represented by the exotics are
exposed today only in the Arbuckle Mountains
of Oklahoma; others including the Pine Top
Chert...are found in the Ti Valley-Choctaw
belt; and two others (Cotter Dolomite and
Boone chert) are exposed in the Ozark region.
The boulders from the Cotter and Boone
formations have been found only near Boles,
Arkansas, at the eastern end of the
boulder-bearing area.
Shideler (1970) attributed the sources of origin for the
exotics to Arbuckle, Ozark, and Ouachita Facies that
include seventeen different formations from the
Arbuckles, seven from the Ozarks, and five from the
Ouachitas. Of those, the sources from the Ozarks warrant
specific attention here, for if boulders and cobbles of the
Ozark cherts do occur in the Ouachitas, then the ability
to segregate archeological materials made of those
specific types becomes difficult at best. Shideler reports
finding cherts from the Moorefield, Boone, Sallisaw, and
Cotter formations with a "high-confidence" level of
identification in the Johns Valley Shale. Other geologists
(Wal per 1970; Hendricks 1970) have taken issue with
some of Shideler's conclusions, but did not address those
specifically related to the cherts. In their discussion of the
possible origins of the exotics in the Johns Valley Shale,
Pitt et al. (1982) do not mention Shideler's conclusions,
and they attribute the origins to the Arbuckle-Ouachita
sources, which seems to be much more realistic. Without
knowing the types of analyses used to identify the exotics,
the "Boone" cherts reported by both Rea and Shideler
could possibly be attributed to the Wapanucka as
illustrated in Figure 1.32. In the number of examinations
reported elsewhere by Banks and J.B. Winters (1975,
1983) not a single chert cobble found in these shales is
typical of Ozark cherts as discussed by Shideler. This, by
itself, is not absolute proof that Shideler is wrong, but in

46

combination with the other geological reports it does
seem to contradict those findings.
The cherts found in the Johns Valley Shale whose
origins can be attributed to chert members within the
Novaculite Formation have been called Nova-cherts to
distinguish them from the other types also occurring in
the shales (Banks 1983:150). Nova-cherts represent
specific types of chert that occurred in the Arkansas
Novaculite Formation and that were redeposited as
exotic cobbles and boulders in the Johns Valley Shale
before the orogeny that produced the Ouachita
MountainÂ·s. (As a matter of fact, some of the English
flints are identical in basic petrography, color,
diaphaneity, and fracture characteristics to some of these
Nova-cherts, as well as to the finer varieties of Florence
chert in the Flint Hills of Kansas, and Edwards chert in
Texas.)
The other principal cherts occurring in the Johns
Valley Shale are the Bigfork, Woodford, and possibly to a
lesser extent the Pinetop. None of the
W apanucka-Chickachoc types have yet been specifically
identified in the shales. Detailed descriptions of chert
types from seven different localities of the Johns Valley
outcrops are described by Banks (1983:348-357), and
selected varieties are shown in Plate 4 of Appendix A.
The significance of the Johns Valley cherts is the fact that
they are superior in quality and size to their original
sources of geologic origin prior to being deposited as
exotics in the Johns Valley shale. All of the surface
exposures of the Johns Valley examined by me contain
some evidence of prehistoric use as a lithic resource.
Most of those areas are still covered by relatively dense
vegetation, however. On the basis of these high quality
cherts in the Johns Valley exposures, it was suggested
(Banks 1983:391) that they may have been a primary
factor of influence for prehistoric settlement patterns in
the Jackfork basin.
In the eastern Ouachitas, unlike the western Ouachitas,
the exotic chert boulders do not seem to be basic
lithologic constituents. The Johns Valley outcrops
continue eastward from Oklahoma along the crest of the
northern flanks of the mountains to a point near Hollis,
Arkansas. Like the western areas, the outcrops are
discontinuous in narrow east-west oriented exposures,
but unlike the Oklahoma outcrops, the two principal
outcrops in Arkansas are as much as 48 km (30 mi) in
length and about 4 km (2.5 mi) in width. In spite of the
controversy over the origins of the exotics, including
those of chert, all of the geological reports are in close
agreement that the boulder-bearing shales are restricted
to the western Ouachitas. Pitt et al. (1982:34) state that
"the uplifted area [of Bengalia] did not extend farther
eastward than R. 18 E. in Pushamataha County,
Oklahoma". This would also restrict subsequent
redeposition of the exotics to a smaller region. Their

determined, but the southernmost deposits of the Johns
Valley Shale at the Shawmut Ford on the Antoine River
in Arkansas were briefly examined for this purpose by
Dr. Ann Early, Nathan Banks, and the writer with
negative results in June of 1985.
~

Ouachita Gravels
Cretaceous and possibly Tertiary-aged gravels produce
large cobbles of quartzite ranging up to boulder size
derived from the flanks of the southern Ouachitas. These
Â·gravels can be found in particular abundance in the
foothills and terraces adjacent to the Mountain Fork and
Rolling Fork tributaries of the Little River in southeast
Oklahoma and southwest Arkansas. The cobbles in this
area are of special interest because they often occur in
various shades of red and brown to yellow as a result of
weathering. Quartzite in these particular color ranges are
not ordinarily common in the Ouachitas, and when
artifacts of red and brown quartzite are recovered in
archeological contexts, they are usually classified as
exotics or (in some cases most appropriately) as having
been heat-treated. Individuals familiar with the specific
quartzites in question can normally distinguish between
natural quartzites and heat treated specimens, but as a
rule it is not an ability possessed by archeologists who
may be unfamiliar with these specific materials.

Non-Chert Rocks and Minerals of Note
in the Ouachitas
Along a line from Granite Mountain near Little Rock
and southwestward to Malvern, the Frontal Ouachitas
produce distinctive igneous rocks that were also
important in prehistory. These include: syenite and
possibly trachyte porphyry from Granite Mountain
(Martha Rolingson, personal communication);
lamprophyre extending from "south-central Hot Springs
County to central Pulaski County" in igneous dikes and
sills (Robison 1976:1); and bauxite from the Benton
complex in Saline County (Rolingson, personal
. communication). The bauxite was a source of raw
material for
carved
stone
pipes
of

47

Mississi.ppian-Caddoan societies. Outcrops of serpentine
and soapstone occur as small and isolated exposures 27
km due west of Little Rock in the headwaters of Fourche
Creek south of Ferndale (Haley 1976), but prehistoric
use is not commonly associated with those sources in the
archeological literature.
In the western Ouachitas, the Hatton Tuff and Colbert
Creek diorite are the more notable igneous rocks of
archeological concern. These materials are described in
greater detail elsewhere (Banks 1984:91; Banks and
Winters 1975:33-35). Though it is not a lithic resource in
the sense used here, turquoise has been reported in the
Ouachitas, and it certainly warrants some discussion
because of possible inferences made about trade between
certain Caddoan and Puebloan groups. Early (1978:8)
describe the Ouachita turquoise as being blue and green
and occurring
as mineralizations within bedding planes and
fault and fracture lines in the Novaculite facies,
particularly in the lower portion of the Middle
Novaculite Formation. Deposits are found as
thin coatings in several locations and have been
found at one region within the mountain system
in extensive enough quantities to encourage
attempts at commercial mining activity. The
thinner lenses of turquoise have been located
at several outcrops between Little Rock in the
center of the state and the Oklahoma border.
In unweathered locations the material is bright
blue and often quite soft. Exposed outcrops are
harder and blue green.
The trace element analysis on the raw turquoise
compared to turquoise artifacts from the Standridge site
"supports the hypothesis that the Standridge beads were
made of local raw material" (Early 1978:11). The
novaculite deposits are also known to have produced thin
sheets of native copper occurring along fracture planes,
but this material's extent and use, if any, by prehistoric
populations is undetermined.
That the chert and other lithic and mineral resources
of the Ouachitas figured prominently in the economics,
trade, and ceremonial relationships of the various groups
who occupied the region comes as a surprise to no one
familiar with the area. The extent of that involvement has
yet to be pursued in archeological research .

_This geographic area (Figure 2.1) extends from the lower
Rio Grande Valley in Texas north and east across Texas,
and all of Louisiana, southeast Oklahoma and southwest
Arkansas. Notably, the region contains the least amount
of available lithic materials from in situ geological
formations of all the study areas. The geological
formations found here are late Cretaceous, Tertiary, or
Pleistocene deposits. The area, however, does contain
gravel derived from chert-bearing formations in the
headwaters of the several rivers that flow across this
study area. Gravel is, in fact, a major constituent of the
terraces found in these river valleys. Of course, the
nearer the terrace deposits are to the sources, the greater
the amount and general overall quality of the raw
materials. The interpretation of prehistoric use of stone
resources in these areas as reflected in archeological sites
requires different sets of explanations to a certain degree
than would be required in areas of abundant and readily
available, bedrock deposits. See Mallouf (1976:42-64) for
example. Perhaps the most significant problem in this
regard concerns the ability to identify sources of origin
with any appreciable degree of reliance. The effects of
chemical and mechanical weathering that have altered
original materials to what we now see as terrace and
stream gravels are, for the most part, poorly understood.
Yet in a resource-poor area such as described here, the
most consistent day-to-day use of stone by prehistoric
residents relied upon these materials. It is incumbent
upon us to obtain a better knowledge of the effects of
weathering.
The geological formations that contain in situ rocks
suitable for the manufacture of stone tools within this
region are very few: the distinctive Pisgah Ridge chert
that occurs in the Tehuacana member of the Kincaid
Formation south of Corsicana, Texas (McGregor et al.
1982); the Manning Fused Glass in southeast Texas (K.
M. Brown 1976:189-207); a distinctive ferruginous
sandstone in the Eastern Cross Timbers; an isolated
occurrence of quartzite on Buzzard Bluff in southwest
Arkansas; a poorly known series of materials from the
Catahoula Formation in Texas and Louisiana; and finally
opal from the Fleming Formation in Louisiana. In
49

addition to these formations, a ubiquitous source of lithic
materials common to a large segment of the area is
widely, and in some cases perhaps inappropriately,
designated as the Uvalde Gravel. With the exception of
the Cretaceous-aged Woodbine Formation, all other
formations being discussed are of Tertiary age.

Catahoula-Fleming
According to Welch (1942), the Catahoula and
overlying Fleming Formations were originally named by
Veatch (1905:90) as parts of the Grand Gulf Series
defined a half century earlier as extending from the Rio
Grande to Florida. The Catahoula has been a subject of
more geological controversy than almost any other
geological formation anywhere. It extends northeasterly
from Rio Grande City, Texas, across southern and
eastern Texas and enters Louisiana at the Sabine-Newton
county line in Texas. From that point it arcs
northeastward through the Kisatchie National Forest to
Colfax. Isolated exposures occur from northeast of
Colfax eastward to the Fish Creek-Little River
confluence. Major outcrops then occur between Little
River and Silicy Island in the Ouachita River in northern
Catahoula county (Groat 1984). It crops out again east of
the Mississippi River near Natchez. None of the
geological literature on the Catahoula provides adequate
descriptions or specific delineations of the material
referred to here as being of archeological significance,
but the single reference nearest to doing so is that by
Chadwick (1988). Even his research is directed
specifically to the petrified woods in the Catahoula and
Fleming formations. He does imply however (Chadwick
1988:4) that of the two members of the formation (the
lower Chita and upper Onalaska) the Onalaska contains
finer grained sandstones that presumably would be more
useful for tool production. Chawner (1936:125)
discusses exposures of hard quartzite in several different
areas of the Catahoula and calls specific attention to
exposures south and west of Spring Ridge Church, about
7 km southeast of Rosefield, Louisiana. Lynn, Fox, and
O'Malley (1977:6) reference the Catahoula as the

"resistant formation [that] forms the narrow 'choke' of
Choke Canyon at the proposed dam site [of the same
name near Three Rivers, Texas].
The Catahoula quartzite is usually defined as a hard
nonmarine-blue quartzite in places cemented with
opaline matrix (see Duessen 1924:100-102, for example).
Galloway (1977:23) describes the lithology of the "Chita
Corrigan system" as consisting of "fine to
medium-grained sands ... of quartz with subequal amounts
of orthoclase, plagioclase, and rock fragments (including
chert and some volcanic debris)". The rocks are
described as "subarkoses, sublitharenites, lithic arkoses,
and feldspathic litharenites."
The origin of the Oligocene volcanic ash and debris in
the formation is attributed to contemporaneous
volcanism that was taking place in the mountains that
cross central Mexico from north to south (Galloway
1977:23, 25). Chadwick (1988:7-8) attributes the
silicification of the various petrified woods he identifies
by species to the volcanic ash in the formation. It is
perhaps of archeological interest, but to no one's
surprise, that the majority of the wood types identified
are palms and secondarily are those of oak, but there are
significant differences. According to Chadwick (1988:54)
the palm woods may also be present as sandstone casts
while
oak and hickory are preserved as silica
petrifactions exclusively. XRD analysis show
palm and oak wood in the Catahoula are
preserved as opal-CT and are always black
when unweathered .... Palm and oak wood
preserved as opal-CT contained much of the
wood's original organic network. Oak wood in
the middle Fleming is preserved as length-slow
chalcedony and the organic network is absent.
What should be of significance here is that, in general,
the more knappable petrified woods are probably of oak
and hickory and occur primarily in the Fleming sediments
overlying the Catahoula. While species identification in
petrified woods has not previously been a factor in
tracing origins for archeological purposes, Chadwick's
work certainly suggests such a possibility may exist.
In the Fort Polk (Louisiana) investigations, Heinrich
(1983:553) defines the Catahoula as a quartz arenite and
describes it as "a white-gray to light gray, poorly sorted,
fine to coarse grained sandstone. The hardness ... can vary
depending upon the proportion of opal cement and
montmorillonitic matrix present within it." Specimens
collected by Chadwick and provided to the writer by
James Corbin from the Blue Hole (modern) Quarry near
Zavalla, Texas, vary from a white, friable sandstone to the
the more typical quartz arenite. The typical rocks (Figure
2.2) are very light gray (10YR8/1) to slightly darker gray
(lOYR 7/1) and weathers to a pale yellowish gray
(10YR8/2). The darker areas give the appearance of
being slightly more dense than the lighter s4ades. The

Mallouf.

fracture is brittle to slightly conchoidal. The rock is
uniformly opaque, and has a dull luster. Glistening grains
of silica tend to exhibit a false impression of luster. The
rock varies from very fine to medium grained texture.
Iron-oxide staining and weathered portions of the rock
are rusty and yellowish brown (10YR5/8).
At Choke Canyon, Lynn et al. (1977:6) describe the
Catahoula as a "tuffaceous sand and sandstone
interbedded with clay, silt, and tuff', but do not mention
actual quartzite that could have been used as a source for
tool production. They do however cite the petrified and
opalized wood occurring the the Tertiary-aged deposits
such as the Whittset (which also contains some
chalcedony) and the Catahoula as being of considerable
importance as a local source for lithic materials.
Don Krumpe reported to Robert Mallouf that
distinctive chert types in the Catahoula near Rio Grande
City are reflected in archeological sites for some distance
both up and downstream from the outcrops (Robert
Mallouf, personal communication). Elsewhere the lithic
materials in the Catahoula appear to be restricted to

quartzite. A sample of the chert located by Krumpe and
collected by Mallouf and Tunnell is shown in Figure 2.2.
The rock is dense, aphanic, and opaque. In color it ranges
from a mottled medium gray to yellowish gray. It appears
to be fossiliferous, but no petrographic analysis nor
identification of fossils has yet been performed. Red
staining produces irregular banding in the rock. Mallouf
refers to the material as "El Sauz chert" because of its
proximity to the town of the same name north of Rio
Grande City. The McAllen-Brownsville Sheet of the
Texas Geologic Atlas (1976) does not mention chert as a
constituent of the formation.
Published descriptions of the variety, geographic
distribution, and known cultural uses of the Catahoula
quartzite are essentially nonexistent. Marvin Jeter
(personal communication) thinks there are close
similarities of the Catahoula quartzite to the opaque
variety of the Talahata quartzite or "Buhrstone" from
Mississippi. Normally the Talahata is a semitranslucent
quartzite, lead gray in color, with ovate opaque white
inclusions according to Jeter. It weathers to a yellow
brown. The Catahoula does appear to represent a
significant local resource for use by Caddoan and other
prehistoric cultures in east Texas and Louisiana. It is a
predominant material type represented in the Mast site
currently being excavated near Nacogdoches, Texas
(Corbin 1988), but most of the cores and artifacts of the
material are heat-treated and exhibit some evidence of
cortex. The nearest exposures of the Catahoula to
Nacogdoches are about 30 miles to the south (Corbin,
personal communication).
Other Tertiary-Pleistocene formations located in the
Fort Polk area (Sabine and Vernon parishes of
Louisiana) discussed by Heinrich (1983) are Eagle Hill
Chert, a specific type of petrified wood that is possibly
derived from the Fleming Formation which seems to
confirm Chadwick's findings discussed above; opal from
the Fleming Formation; and chert gravels of unknown
specific origin. Heinrich provides descriptions of the
various cherts based on petrographic analysis. The
definitions of the Eagle Hill chert and the opal are
especially useful for future comparisons with other
studies. The petrified wood he describes is found
indiscriminantly scattered in the general area, but its type
designation is based on an apparent concentration in the
Eagle Hill vicinity of Peason Ridge - the elevated divide
between the Red and Sabine drainages.
The Eagle Hill chert
is a massive, hard, waxy, microcrystalline
material which contains no inclusions or
identifiable relict textures in hand specimens.
The chert is usually a translucent very dark
grayish brown (lOYR 3/2 to 2.5YR 3/2) to
white (lOYR 8/1). When weathered, it develops
a prominent white weathering rind. The cortex
is usually a reddish yellow (lOYR 7/4 to 7/8)
51

with a bluish gray (PB 5/2) zone of chert
adjacent to it (Heinrich 1983: 552).
The Fleming opal is defined as having been found as
far east as Rapides Parish and occurring in
nodules one-quarter of an inch to a foot [6-30
cm] in diameter ... [It] is a massive, transparent
to translucent, usually vitreous material. It has
a wide range of colors, generally varying from a
fmely mottled white and dark gray (10 YR 4/4)
or very dark gray (10 YR 3/1) to a faintly
mottled light grayish brown (10 YR 6/1). Its
earthy cortex is commonly white to yellow
(lOYR 7/8). When heated, the colors change to
a light olive brown (2.5 YR 4/4) or black colors.
These colors will often contain fine mottles of
various shades of gray, olive, and brown.
Freshly exposed opal has been observed to
change color just on exposure to sunlight. The
opal can be difficult, if Â·not impossible, to
differentiate from the Eagle Hill chert just
from hand specimen observations (Heinrich
1983:553).
Brassieur (1983:251) mentions that large boulders of
the opal have been found on Eagle Hill.

Citronelle Gravel
The Citronelle Formation was defined by Chawner
(1936:27) as "the graveliferous formation in Catahoula
Parish and [he] assigned it to a Pleistocene age".
Woodward and Gueno (1941:27) discuss the geological
confusion with which it has been assigned to practically
every epoch represented in the Gulf Coast. Some of the
disagreement about the age surrounds the unusually large
sizes of gravels in the formation. Woodward and Gueno
postulated "that it would take special conditions
operating during the Pleistocene to account for such
coarse gravel deposits in this region". Chawner's
(1936:134) original discussion was based on comparisons
of the formation with the Citronelle in Mississippi
defined by Matson in 1916. Chawner described the
gravels in a 35 foot ( 6.4 m) thick exposure of the
formation two miles (3.2 km) northwest of Harrisonburg
as varying from "smaller than 1" [2.5 cm] but up to 6" [15.2
cm] in diameter, containing paleozoic [sic] fossils such as
crinoid, coral, and brachiopod fragments and chert types
such as flint, greenish chert, jasper, and opalized wood".
He also notes the presence of siliceous oolite in the
formation (Chawner 1936:135). Groat (1984) illustrates
the Citronnelle as cropping out in east central Bossier
Parish southeastward to Martin, Louisiana; east of Saline
Bayou and as widespread exposures occurring to the
south but parallel to the Catahoula across central
Louisiana; and covering much of the terrain between
Lake Ponchartrain and the Mississippi state line to the
north.

Wikox-Yegua
Other Tertiary-aged deposits that warrant some
discussion here are the Wilcox and Yegua formations.
Throughout east Texas and western Louisiana at
sporadic locations within these formations, petrified
wood (and petrified palmwood-the Texas State
Rock-in particular) was an obviously important,
although probably fortuitous, lithic resource. The
palmwood is especially distinctive, but there are few
discrete concentrations of individual types that were used
as primary sources of raw materials. Carroll Kleinhans
(personal communication) quotes Charles Pearson with
Coastal Environments, Inc., as knowing of a concentrated
source of petrified palmwood northwest of Pineville,
Louisiana. The late R. K. "King" Harris (personal
communication) also thought such a source existed in the
headwaters of Twin Creek north of Eustace, Texas,
because of the relatively large amount of the material
present in Archaic sites in the area. Similarly, Jack
Hughes (personal communication) observed
concentrations of beautiful and distinctive
orange-colored petrified palmwood exposed in a roadcut
near Livingston, Texas. Rockhounds have traditionally
sought out areas in which the palmwood was
concentrated. The source area referenced by Kleinhans
and Pearson possibly has been quarried prehistorically,
but in general if particular surface exposures of the wood
ever served as "quarry" sources during prehistoric times,
the likelihood of such traces still remaining are slight.
The intensive search by rockhounds for this particular
material would more than likely have obliterated most
evidence of prehistoric quarrying, if it was ever present.
In some cases modern quarrying activities could also be
confused with prehistoric activities. Fisher (1965:197),
referring to these Eocene and Oligocene rocks, states
that the fossil palmwood "is highly regarded by cutters
from all parts of the country and is considered by many
lapidarists to be some of the finest gem-quality fossil
wood in the U.S.". Prehistoric knappers apparently found
it desirable also.
James Corbin (personal communication) attributes a
predominant use of Yegua gravels, mostly quartzites and
petrified wood, as the source of late Archaic artifacts in
sites from the east-central Texas (Nacogdoches) area.
Like the similar materials from the Uvalde gravels,
however, there was a heavy reliance on use of
heat-treatment before the quartzites could be most
effectively knapped.

Buzzard Bluff
This is a prominent landmark that rises about 25 m
above the surrounding Red River floodplain east of
Homan, Arkansas. David Jeane and Frank Schambach
(personal communication) have found a distinctive
52

quartzite occurring in relatively significant quantities on
and around the bluff. They report workshop debris being
present in the general vicinity and especially off the
eastern flanks of the bluff, and they also report that
artifacts made from the material are commonly found in
nearby archeological sites. The overall distribution of the
material remains to be determined, but it appears to be
very localized. The material is a dense, rather uniformly
colored medium gray orthoquartzite. It could easily be
confused with varieties of Ogallala quartzite, and
especially so if heat-treated. In connection with a current
study of lithic sources related to the Cooper project being
performed for the Fort Worth District COE, Banks
included a specimen of this material for petrographic
examination by Roger Bowers. Bowers (personal
communication) has described the material
megascopically as "a light gray (N7) to medium gray (NS)
with streaks of yellowish gray (5Y8/1) to light olive gray
(5Y6/1). It weathers light olive gray (5Y6/1) to pinkish
gray (5YR8/1) to pale reddish brown (10R5/4)."
Petrographic analysis indicates that the material is
composed of "75% microcrystalline quartz, 14% quartz
sand grains, 9% quartz silt, 1% clay, 1 % organic material,
and a trace of opaque minerals". He defines the rock as a
"hard, massive, silicified sandy mudstone". According to
the Arkansas State Geological Map (Haley 1976), the
most likely formation for the origin of the quartzite is
probably a remnant of the Wilcox on top of Midway
deposits.

Pisgah Ridge
Pisgah Ridge is the name applied to a long narrow
erosional remnant of Tertiary rock that is more resistant
to erosion than most other deposits of similar age near
the southeasternmost corner of what may be referred to
as north-central Texas. The north end of the ridge is
located about 15 km (9 mi ) south of Corsicana, and a
short distance due west of Richland, Texas. It begins
immediately to the southeast of the Oak Creek and
Richland Creek confluence and extends in a southerly
direction for 12 km (7.5 mi) parallel to the east side of the
northward flowing Oak Creek. The ridge rises about 46 m
(151 ft) above the floodplain of the creek and averages
about 1.5 km in width. It is underlain by rocks from the
Eocene-aged Midway Group and it? capped by the
Tehuacana Member of the Kincaid Formation of the
group (Texas Geologic Atlas 1970: Waco Sheet). The
Pisgah Limestone Member stratigraphically comprises
the midsection of the ridge. The ridge is a western facing
cuesta whose limestone ledges are quite distinctive in the
area.
The Kincaid Formation and its individual members,
such as the Tehuacana, are not often mapped elsewhere
as differentiated units from the Midway, but the
Tehuacana is quoted by McGregor et al. (1982:67) from

Gardner (1933) as "extending [discontinuously] from
Kaufman County, Texas to the Rio Grande". Although
the Tehuacana does crop out much more extensively than
just on Pisgah Ridge, this particular chert in the
formation is not reported elsewhere. In the type
description of the Pisgah member, Gardner (1933) does
not reference chert as part of the lithology. Here, the
chert occurs in nodular form interbedded with the
limestone. The local area of the ridge has been relatively
well examined by Daniel McGregor, Bill Young of
Corsicana (personal communication) and others, with
. only two quarries being found to date. Those individuals
believe the chert to be of very limited geographic
distribution. McGregor et al. (1982:67) also state that the
"material has not been observed in terrace or upland
gravel deposits". The weathering characteristics (Figure
2.3) of the chert may be a factor, however, in the limited
reporting of its presence for it weathers to a porous,
chalky, light gray speckled appearance that would rarely
be recognized as chert unless fresh exposures are found.
Jack Hughes and I were unsuccessful in attempts to
locate additional exposures along the western
escarpment of the ridge in 1983. The two known quarry
areas are located in the northernmost portion of the
ridge.

Fresh surfaces of the chert (defined as a biosparite by
McGregor et al. 1982) vary in color from a dark grayish
brown to black. It is opaque even on thin edges and is
especially characterized by the profusion of microfossils
that produce the speckled appearance (Figure 2.3). In
some respects it is similar in appearance to chert from
the Nehawka quarries on Weeping Water Creek in
southeastern Nebraska.
Because of the proximity to sites found during the
Richland-Chambers project investigations (McGregor et
al. 1982) and the limited distribution and distinctiveness
of the chert, the Pisgah Ridge materials provided an ideal
opportunity to examine relationships of the chert
exploitation to subsistence routines. McGregor et al.
(1982) computed distances based on stream miles and
straight lines from the quarry locations and 11 individual
sites to percentages of the chert represented as debitage
in each site. Results were that the "percentage of Pisgah
Ridge chert correlates more strongly with creek distance.
The correlation is negative, indicating that the
percentage of Pisgah Ridge chert in lithic debitage
assemblages decreases with increasing creek route
distance from the source as expected" (McGregor et al.
1982:68). This pattern seems to suggest that the chert
exploitation was generally associated with subsistence
patterns rather than intentional trips to the quarries
solely for chert procurement, but McGregor et al.
emphasize caution in this determination "because of the
sample adequacy and temporal context".

Manning Fused Glass
Without question, the most unusual geologic source of
lithic materials in the Gulf Coastal Plain and one which
can be isolated with some degree of reliance to specific
areas is the Manning Fused Glass. The name sounds like
a play on words, but in reality the material is produced by
fusion of volcanic ash as a result of burning lignite
underlying the ash itself. Brown (1976) provides the best
and only detailed description of the peculiar rock type
and related environmental and cultural associations. The
Manning Formation of Eocene age covers a much greater
geographic area than does the apparent occurrence of
the subject rock. As illustrated in Figure 2.1 it crops out
in a narrow (about 4 km), sinuous and discontinuous
band paralleling the previously discussed Catahoula. The
two formations are separated by exposures of the
Whitsett and Marsh Creek formations (Texas Geologic
Atlas 1968: Palestine Sheet, ) in east central Texas, but
for the most part are separated by only the Whittset over
the greater length of exposure extending across some
nine counties from southwest to the east-northeast and
ending on the east side of the Neches River west of
Jasper, Texas. Brown limits the occurrence of volcanic
glass to eight specific source points located in Fayette,
Washington, Brazos, Grimes, Walker and Trinity

counties in Texas. He also identifies 24 widespread
archeological sites that are known to contain artifacts
made of the material.
The distribution of sites recorded by Brown as yielding
artifacts of the glass extends from a concentration in
Walker county near Trinity, Texas and near the
easternmost edge of the outcrop area shown in Figure 2.1
to the north and northeast, almost to the Sabine River in
the vicinity of Kilgore, Texas (Brown 1976:Figure 3). At
the northernmost concentration of 19 individual sites, it is
probable that the presence of the materials resulted from
trade of some sort. Greater archeological distribution
than that indicated by Brown is suggested by the presence
of some flake debris and pieces of the glass on Peason
Ridge on the Fort Polk installation in west-central
Louisiana. Neither Brassieur (1983) nor Heinrich (1983)
reported a presence of the material at Fort Polk, but
Frank Servello and I observed some on Eagle Hill during
a visit in 1978. Although unaltered fragments of the
material are found in the area, suggesting that sources of
the rock occur there too, the distance from the Manning
outcrops precludes such consideration, and its presence
must be attributed to either trade or migration.

that many, if not most, of the Perdiz points found in
Caddoan sites in east Texas are made of Edwards chert
types which would have been easily accessible to the
Jumanos. Detailed research on this topic could be worthy
of a master's thesis in economic anthropology or an
archeologic study on the use of lithic materials.
Perhaps the most unusual source and procurement
technique for chert is represented from the area along
the coastal delta of the Trinity River as reported by Aten
(1983:342-346). He presents a strong case for the use of
alligator chert-gastroliths for manufacturing small
arrowpoints in lieu of the more commonly utilized
alligator gar scales. This is an especially common
phenomenon at Akokisa (Orqoquisac) sites along the
lower Trinity River. The alligators presumably obtained
the pebbles from deeper river deposits that were not
necessarily available to the Indians otherwise.
In contrast to the lithic materials relied upon by late
prehistoric and protohistoric groups, Paleoindian and
Archaic materials reported from the McFaddin Beach
area by Russell Long are quite different. Point types
ranging from Clovis age to what apparently are typical
Middle Archaic point types are reported as being made
of "Fredericksburg" or Edwards chert, "Louisiana gravel,"
petrified palmwood, Catahoula sandstone, and Alibates
(Long 1978:7-14). Dee Ann Story (personal
communication) reports that the materials identified as
. Alibates by Long are not in fact Alibates, but a
heat-treated material (possibly Edwards) that exhibits
reddish banding.
Between the Sabine and Pearl rivers along the upper
coast of Louisiana, a series of upland "Prairie and
Pre-Prairie" terraces are described in some detail by
Coastal Environments, Inc. (1977:239-241) with specific
relationship to the Amite River environment. At various
places on the terraces and on modern point bars, gravel
deposits with relatively high concentrations of chert
occur. The gravels are most often referred to as a
geomorphic unit termed Amite Gravel. Obviously eroded
from older sediments farther inland such as the
Citronelle perhaps, "the gravels consist predominantly of
tan, brown, red, and black chert of varying degrees of
purity, with occasional quartzite pebbles and small slabs
of ferruginous sandstone" (Coastal Environments 1977:
241). Like the chert pebbles discussed by Shafer (1973) at
the George C. Davis site, they seem to have been
primarily utilized through bipolar flaking. The extent of
these gravels, their relationship to the older deposits, and
analytical descriptions are as yet undefmed. They were,
however, used by Archaic and later cultures throughout
southern Louisiana as discussed by Coastal
Environments (1977:235). They imply that the late
Paleoindian and early Archaic dart points were
manufactured from raw materials that were exotic to the

55

area, but no attempt was apparently made to identify
them.

Crowley's Ridge
This physiographic feature is a prominent landmark
rising above the floor of the Mississippi lowlands in
eastern Arkansas. Fenneman (1938:87) refers to
Crowley's Ridge as
a maturely dissected remnant of the higher,
nearly level plain in which the present alluvial
trough [of the Mississippi Valley] was carved.
Extending from Thebes, Ill., to Helena, Ark., it
is 200 miles long [321.9 km] and clearly defmed
by steep lateral slopes which are remarkably
parallel. Its width averages about three miles in
the southern half where the height is 100 to 150
feet [ca 30-46 m], and 12 miles [19.3 km] in the
northern half where the maximum height above
the plain is 250 feet [76 m].
Caplan (1954:9) discusses an interesting perspective of
Crowley's Ridge that was first mentioned by Call
(1889:128) as well as others. This hypothesis, in simple
terms, is that in late Pleistocene time the Mississippi
River flowed down the west side of Crowley's Ridge with
the Ohio River flowing southward along the east side.
The two rivers presumably converged south of Helena,
Arkansas. At some point the Mississippi cut across the
northernmost end of the ridge and left the ridge as an
erosional remnant. Saucier's discussion of this particular
feature (1974:19-21) confirms and refines the earlier
hypotheses advanced by Branner.
House (1975) discusses the use of quartzite and chert
gravels from Crowley's Ridge in the Cache River sites,
but he does not describe the cherts except to state that
they probably were derived from the Ozarks before being
deposited in this area. Perino (1967:10-12) describes the
lithology as being "composed primarily of coarse jasper
gravel, sand, yellow clay, loess, and loam. The gravel
deposits vary and sometimes occur near the surface of
the ridge to a depth equal to the average height of the
ridge and sometimes yield petrified wood".
Because of its well drained alluvial soils, its elevation
above the lowlands, and its subtle ecotonal nature, the
ridge has figured prominently throughout human history
as a prime location for habitation. The lowermost
geological formations of Crowley's Ridge are probably
from the Wilcox-Claiborne groups of Eocene age. The
origin of the chert gravels is uncertain. Based on
Saucier's (1974) geomorphic reconstructions, those
cherts could have been derived from any place upstream
in the Mississippi drainage.

The Eastern Cross Timbers
The geological formation that underlies and is directly
responsible for the delineation of this distinctive

physiographic area is the Woodbine Formation, the
lowermost formation of the late Cretaceous period.
According to Stephenson (1952), Dodge (1969) and
others, the formation consists of five members that can be
distinguished, but the two principal members, Dexter and
Lewisville, are divided by Oliver (1971) on the basis of
depositional systems. For practical purposes this
discussion will simply refer to the two principal members
where appropriate. While the predominantly wooded
surface of the Cross Timbers contains sporadic but many
localities of Uvalde Gravel veneers, those gravels were
not derived from the Woodbine itself. The formation is,
however, the principal producer in north-central Texas of
sandstone that occurs in massive to thm bedded lenses
and in varying degrees of grain size and friability.
Prehistorically, this resource provided ample raw
materials for ground stone tools such as manos, metates,
and various types of abraders. Oddly, in spite of the
presence of indurated sandstone bluffs in the immediate
vicinity of archeological sites of all ages in the study area,
I have never seen a single conical bedrock mortar such as
is common in the Western Cross Timbers, 64 km or more
across blackland prairies to the west.
The most distinctive lithic material in the Woodbine
that is of considerable local influence archeologically is a
dark gray to black, and fine to medium grained "ironized"
or ferruginous sandstone that superficially resembles
coarse grained hematite. The finer grained materials can
be flaked, and were used extensively in local areas for
production of gouges, larger cutting and chopping tools
such as axes and hoes, and as handheld choppers. In
rarer cases, dart points were also produced from the
material. Quite often the ironized portions of larger slabs
of rock, and especially those formed as large rectangular
concretionary masses, were used as platforms for
metates. It is also worth noting that soft
hematite-limonite concretions used as primary sources of
red and yellow pigment are frequently found in relatively
abundant masses in the Woodbine. They often are found
in association with the ironized sandstone which seems to
be more characteristic of the Dexter Member.
Ironized sandstone, similar to that discussed above,
also occurs from the general vicinity of Frankston, Texas,
eastward into Louisiana. There have been no systematic
attempts to distinguish between these materials either by
comparative, petrographic, or trace elements analysis.

Uvalde Gravel
As if lithic resource identification of in situ cherts were
not complicated enough, the Uvalde Gravel certainly
provides an added dimension to the complexities in many
parts of Texas and elsewhere. The term was first used by
Hill in 1891 to describe upland gravel deposits in central
and south Texas (Hill 1891:368). Since that time it has
been a subject of much debate. Byrd (1971:11) defines

56

eight different names applied to the Uvalde or Uvalde
equivalents, but those names are not widely recognized
nor is there agreement that these could be different
formations. In their 1971 article, the same year as Byrd's
publication, Menzer and Slaughter essentially describe
the same lithology, age, and stratigraphic relationships
for Byrd's Uvalde Gravel in the Dallas area, but they do
not apply the term "Uvalde" to the deposits. Menzer and
Slaughter do however attribute the origin to an eastward
extension of the Ogallala and the High Plains as does
Byrd. Menzer and Slaughter (1971:220) state:
The widespread occurrence of upland gravels
in north-central Texas favors this
interpretation; however, in order to
substantiate this view, it will be necessary to
verify Rocky Mountain provenance for more of
the upland deposits in this area. We have not
prospected interfluvial areas east of Dallas
County, thus do not know how much farther
the suggested eastwardly flowing late Pliocene
streams continued before turning south toward
the Gulf of Mexico. Conceivably, these streams
flowed into the Mississippi embayment.
Byrd (1971:5) defines the Uvalde Gravel as
a lag deposit of waterworn siliceous gravels
anomalous to the geology of central and south
Texas and unrelated to the present river
channels and terrace deposits of Pleistocene
age .... These lag accumulations tend to drape
over irregularities in the topography and are
therefore considered more as a part of the soil
than as a mappable geologic unit. Composition
of the Uvalde Gravel ranges from pebbles to
boulders of chert, quartz, jasper, quartzite,
limestone, and silicified wood.
Also, Byrd limits the geographic distribution of the
Uvalde Gravel to the areas east and south of the High
Plains for a relatively short distance beyond the
demarcation of the Balcones Escarpment, and from
Dallas and Tarrant counties on the northeast
southwestward into Mexico. But, as indicated by Menzer
and Slaughter (1971), the description given by Byrd can
be replicated for gravel veneers occurring on interfluves
over much wider areas than just south and central Texas.
As it currently stands Uvalde Gravel is an ubiquitous
term that is applied to almost all relict gravel deposits on
late Tertiary and Â·Pleistocene terraces as well as upland
interfluves left as erosional remnants of the retreating
High Plains that once extended as far to the east as the
vicinity of Fort Worth. Reworked and redeposited
gravels from that original source can be expected to have
traveled much farther. I have observed deposits such as
those described by Byrd that have virtually the same lithic
constituency described by Menzer and Slaughter
occurring along the divide between the Red and Sulphur
rivers in northeast Texas (Figure 2.5) and along the

provided me with convincing
evidence that the two are somehow
related. For example, cobble-size
pieces of Ogallala quartzite were
observed in the gravels. Given the
descriptions by Brassieur (1983)
and Heinrich (1983), the
constituents sound identical to
those by both Menzer and
Slaughter (1971) and Byrd (1971).
Carrying all this a step further can
only add to the confusion, but the
same could also be applied to the
gravel veneers in parts of western
Oklahoma (see Banks 1984:73-74
for a discussion of upland gravels
in Alfalfa County, Oklahoma).
Those deposits also produce large
quantities of quartzite including
Ogallala types. Much more
geological research is necessary

Edwards Plateau
The Edwards Plateau (shown in Figure 3.1) is one of
the largest sources of chert in the United States, and
Â· while the Edwards "Formation" is generally considered to
be the chert-bearing unit of the region, there are at least
13 Paleozoic formations ranging in age from Ordovician
to Permian that contain varying quantities and qualities
of chert in and adjacent to the Edwards Plateau. For
example, chert-bearing Permian deposits that crop out
along the western and northern margins of the Edwards
Plateau are from formations such as the Elm Creek,
Admiral, Coleman Junction, Santa Anna Branch, and the
Stockwether Member of the Pueblo Formation. The
Permian cherts other than the Elm Creek are so poorly
known at this time that even the most basic descriptions
are unavailable.
The chert in the Elm Creek (Figure 3.2) is quite similar
to and easily confused with some of the Edwards cherts.
Although the following description is based on a very
limited sample, distinctions in the Elm Creek materials
are that the colors seem to be predominantly in shades of
grayish browns, diaphaneity is usually opaque, and
mottling seems to be much more common than in the
Edwards types. Light gray splotching is common in the
finer grade materials. Although petrographic analysis has
not, to my knowledge, been performed for discrimination
between the apparently similar chert types,
micropaleontology incorporated with such analysis could
be very important. Fossils visible to the naked eye in
either type, however, are nonexistent.
Pennsylvanian formations that contain poorly
identified cherts like the Permian ones referenced above
are the U p'per Gunsight Limestone, the Home Creek
Limestone that contains locally abundant chert nodules,
the Ranger, Marble Falls, and the Winchell (Texas
Geologic Atlas 1976: Brownwood Sheet,). Ordovician
rocks cropping out in the same general vicinities that can
best be described as cherty rather than chert-bearing are
the Honeycut, the Gorman Limestone, and the Tanyard
Formation. The San Saba Member of the Cambrian-aged
Wilbern Formation is identified in the Geologic Atlas as
"sparingly cherty". As a rule, any chert found within the
confines of the Edwards Plateau is usually thought of as

59

bed of Elm Creek, Concho CouJrnty, Texas.

"Edwards" chert by most archeologists. Unfortunately, as
noted above, such is not the case.
If the complexities of differentiation between the
various in situ cherts can be defined adequately for
archeologists, then the ability to distinguish and identify
those same materials altered by weathering that have
been redeposited throughout the drainage systems
becomes more critical. Again, such problems become
even more complex when gravels from older terraces or
actual gravel bars were utilized as a primary source for
lithic materials as seems to be the case in the vicinity of
the Stacy project near Ballinger, Texas. Such resources
occurring in the Colorado River and particularly in the

vicinity of the Concho River confluence, where materials
from several different formations coexist, are typical
examples. From the number of high quality large chert
cobbles available it is virtually impossible at the present
time to differentiate the materials from one original
formation to the other.

Edwards
The Edwards Plateau and the Edwards "Formation"
are terms often used synonymously by archeologists to
refer to a wide variety of materials originating from the
central Texas area, but the two terms are not synonymous
by any means. The Edwards was originally defined as a
single formation by Hill and Vaughan (1898: 193-321) for
exposures along Barton Creek in Austin, Texas. Today
the Cretaceous-aged Edwards Group contains seven
formations, three of which are recognized as principal
chert-bearing units. They are the Segovia, Fort Terrett,
and Devil's River fu.rmationÂ§. In many places within the
plateau, the individual formations are not mapped
separately; consequently, reference to maps alone may
not provide accurate information as to possible chert
sources within a given area. To confuse matters a little
more, along the north-central edge of the plateau, the
Travis Peak Formation of the group is also known to
produce boulders of chert derived from older Paleozoic
formations (Texas Geologic Atlas 1976: Brownwood
Sheet). It would be very easy to mistake such chert
cobbles found in an archeological context as "Edwards"
chert because in a sense it would be true. However, if the
distinction between the two types could not be made, and
outcrops of the parent chert formation are located
elsewhere in the region, accurate interpretation of the
source determinations could be misleading, if not
erroneous. The same type of problem has been discussed
for cherts in the Johns Valley Shale of southeastern
Oklahoma.
In the southwest part of the plateau, the Del Rio Sheet
of the Texas Geologic Atlas (1976), refers to six of the
seven formations in the Edwards as containing chert.
Nowhere, however, have attempts been made to
distinguish chert types occurring in one member from
those in another.
Chert in the Edwards varies from 0.6 cm thick seams
near Turnersville, Texas, to lenticular beds (as much as
15 cm thick) in many other places. Rarely does it occur
in massive or continuous bedding. Geno (1976:25) refers
to the chert occurrences as "disseminated specks,
nodules, and beds ... [and] the disseminated form is far
more abundant than bedded or nodular chert...[ and]
nodular chert is more abundant than bedded chert".
Pittman (1959:127) describes the chert that is relatively
consistent throughout the Edwards as occurring in
vertically restricted zones along bedding-planes
and parallel to them. Most of the nodules are

60

flattened lenses, but many are irregular masses,
replicas of fossils, and coalesced nodules which
form beds with a pronounced pinch and swell
structure. The range in size of nodules is from
less than a quarter of an inch to over three feet
[91 cm] horizontally and from about a quarter
of an inch [0.6 cm] to one foot [31 cm]
vertically.
Geno (1976) and Fisher and Rodda (1967) have
demonstrated that chert in the Edwards Group is
basically related to dolomitization surrounding the
periphery of the ancient oval shaped Kirschberg Lagoon
that extended for a distance of 483 km along its east-west
axis and 258 km in width north to south. Assuming this to
be true, it would follow that the principal chert-bearing
rocks in the Edwards corresponds geographically to the
belt of dolomitization outlined by Geno and by Fisher
and Rodda (Figure 3.1), but from an archeological
perspective this has not been tested. Using the maps by
Fisher and Rodda attempts have been made to obtain a
better correlation between the exposures of the Edwards
with the dolomitic fades of the Kirschberg Lagoon and
the principal chert outcrops of the formation. Those
results have yet to produce reliable patterns for chert
concentrations within the areas outlined by Fisher and
Rodda. The possibilities are still tantalizing, however.
Whether or not it is possible to restrict the occurrence of
chert in the various Edwards outcrops to the areas
delineated by Fisher and Rodda warrants specific
research.
The Hobbs Sheet of the Texas Geologic Atlas (1976)
indicates the presence of isolated Fort Terrett outcrops
as far west as the Texas-New Mexico state line east of
Eunice, New Mexico, and 32 km south of Hobbs. It also
indicates the presence of undifferentiated
Fredericksburg outcrops as far to the west as the extreme
southeast corner of New Mexico. While chert should not
be expected in all outcrops of either unit, the possibility
of finding chert in those areas from such isolated sources
should not be overlooked.
Representative specimens of Edwards cherts are
illustrated in Appendix A, Plates 5 and 6. A view of the
typical nodular lenses is shown in Figure 3.3. Although
the chert has not been well defined for any single
formation in the Edwards Group, some generalizations
are possible at this time. For example, very light gray to
white chert occurs primarily from the northern area of
Lake Belton to a point west and northwest of Gatesville;
probably the highest quality of Edwards (often referred
to as Georgetown flint) occurs from the general vicinity
of Austin northward to Georgetown; a more translucent,
root beer-colored material occurring in thin sheets crops
out in the Junction, Texas, locale; and even the more
common gray to dark gray varieties seem to reflect some
subtle differences from one area to another. To my
knowledge, the best example of actual guarries (i.e., pits

Llano Uplift
{Central Mineral
Region of Texas)

The Llano Uplift, not to
be confused with the Llano
Estacada, is one of the more
geologically interesting
areas in the state of Texas
because of the variety of
different geological
formations and mineral
resources located within
such a relatively small area.
It is included here because
of its lack of attention
elsewhere in archeological
literature as a potential
mineral resource for
prehistoric groups.
Glen Goode (personal
communication), with the
Texas Highway Archeology
Department, has found
small and highly fractured
pieces of chert on the west
flanks of the uplift that
"resembles Alibates in
coloration and banding".
The identification of the
formation from which the
chert is derived has yet to be
determined, and while it is

grayish, and occurs as irregular lenses and false joint
fillings".
On the extreme eastern edge of the Llano Uplift near
Lampasas, Derwood Jones (personal communication)
has found black chert cobbles that are almost
indistinguishable from the Bayou Manard chert of
northeastern Oklahoma. The Brownwood Sheet of the
Texas Geologic Atlas (1976) indicates outcrops of the
chert-bearing Tanyard Formation in the area, but the
formation is only described as being "cherty", and no
detailed physical descriptions are provided. The
potential identification of this chert is important because
no other similar black cherts are known to occur in
central Texas.
The non-chert materials that are known to occur in the
Llano Uplift and that have, for the most part, been
disregarded by archeologists are the soapstone and
serpentine deposits. As a rule, artifacts made of

62

soapstone and serpentine found in east Texas, and
perhaps other areas as well, are usually assumed to have
resulted from trade to the southeast. Paige (1911:91)
describes both serpentine and soapstone being present
14.5 km south of Llano and a little west of the Oxford
Road in an outcrop covering 101 ha and about .8 km in
length in a north-south direction. Presumably at least
some surface exposure also occurred in the prehistoric
past. Paige (1911:75-76) describes a pit that is "20 feet [6.1
m] in diameter and 10 feet [3.0 m] deep" near the north
end of the outcrop: "This pit is in serpentine and exposed
on its west side is a contact with soapstone. For perhaps
100 feet [30.5 m] east and northeast of this pit and for at
least 500 feet [152.9 m] southeast and south, serpentine is
exposed". Whether the pit is wholly or partially of
prehistoric origin has not been determined. Paige also
mentions galena deposits on Silver Creek.

This portion of the study area (Figure 4.1) truly is a
"land of enchantment" with its multicolored, rugged, and
spectacular scenery of both desert and mountain terrain.
Because much of the area of particular relevance to this
report is of such a rugged, remote, and sometimes
inaccessible character, the chert sources are perhaps
more poorly known than in any other area of equal size in
the study area. It is also from this region that the only
igneous cherts occur within the study area.
The source areas of chert are primarily discussed
under individual mountain ranges, but that does not
mean that intervening areas are void of lithic resources.
In general the mountains follow two parallel axes from
north to south and on opposing sides of the Rio Grande
Rift. While the ranges are not continuous it is easy for
those unfamiliar with local geography to be unable to
readily identify distinctions between some of the
contiguous ranges, and it is not uncommon to find
different names applied to some of the smaller ranges on
different maps. Although the ranges are roughly aligned
with the Rocky Mountain Cordillera, they are not all
associated with the Rocky Mountains nor the orogeny
that created the Rockies. For this reason, the geological
formations in the different ranges can be segregated into
two basic geologic systems that respectively share some
stratigraphic similarities. The two systems are those
related to:
1. older (Paleozoic) sedimentary rocks of roughly the
southern half of New Mexico and the Trans-Pecos area
of Texas and
2. the later rocks laid down in the Rocky Mountain
geosynclinal basin primarily during the Mesozoic Era
and prior to the Laramide Revolution.
Therefore certain affinities exist between the Zuni
Mountains from the northwest, southward and eastward
into the Trans-Pecos area, and in the northern portions
of the state respectively included in the Rocky Mountains
(i.e., Sangre De Cristo-San Juan). Igneous rocks in the
various mountains encompass most of the range of
geologic history and as late as the early Holocene (12,000
B.P.).

63

Chuska Mountains
The Chuska Mountains of northwest New Mexico and
northeast Arizona represent one of the more distinctive
sources of chert in this or any other area. Its igneous
origin seems to have produced a naturally heat-treated
chert. Furthermore it is of very high quality for knapping.
The materials are often referred to as Washington Pass,
Chuska, and Paleo-pink chert. The term Paleo-pink is
derived from the late Frank Briolo, who based his term
on the predominant pinkish colors and the fact that the
chert seemed to be favored by Paleoindian groups in the
area. The chert occurs as cavity filling in basalt and
scoria (Figure 4.2) and probably as filling between beds.
The distribution of chert in the igneous rock itself and its
geographic distribution are unknown. It appears to be
concentrated in the Washington Pass area of the Chuska
Mountains and is probably directly associated with a
"prominent volcanic vent [that] is present on top of the
Chuska Mountains at Washington Pass" (Harshbarger
and Repenning 1954:7).
Significant amounts of the chert in large enough sizes
to produce reasonably large dart points and other tools
may be restricted, although a few pieces as large as 7 x 20
x 32 cm (2.7 x 7.9 x 12.6 in) are still found (Figure 4.3).
Most pieces are much smaller. It is also possible that the
better quality materials available to the prehistoric
people are no longer evident except for the debitage.
Some of the more typical specimens are shown in
Appendix A, Plate 7. Individual pieces of the rock are
basically uniform in color in comparison to most other
multicolored cherts. However some banding occurs in
shades of pink, red, yellow and gray. The basic color
range varies from white, pinkish yellow, pale blue, and
dark gray to a predominance of pink shades ranging from
pale pink, pinkish orange to a moderate red. They also
vary in diaphaneity from opaque to chalcedonic-like
translucency. Weathered surfaces vary from pinkish gray
to a mottled grayish orange. The cortex is usually dull to
waxy and in at least a couple of specimens was
opalescent. Dendrites rarely occur, but when they do, the

resulting rock could be easily confused with other
chalcedonic types. In general, comparative analyses can
discriminate between other materials and the Chuska
cherts.
Kimball M. Banks and Terry A. Del Bene (1987) have
produced the most substantive discussion to date on
lithic sources in the Chuska Mountains and on the related
Defiance Plateau immediately southwest of the Chuskas
in Arizona. Though the plateau is slightly outside the
Southwestern Division boundaries, researchers in
western New Mexico and southwest Colorado should
take note of the quartzite quarries described by Banks
and Del Bene (1987:30-31) in the Shinarump
conglomerates. It is also worthy of note that Banks and
Del Bene (1987:32) refer to the Washington Pass chert
source as "the largest lithic source area in the [Navajo
Nation] Forest...[and that] cobbles of the material may be
found in stream beds and drainage systems at least 10
miles (16 km] from the source proper". It is important to
note here that the Chuska cherts and the other cherts in
westernmost New Mexico west of the Continental Divide
do not contribute any gravels to sediments in the Rio
Grande Basin. Gravels derived from the Chuska

Mountains should only be present in the San Juan
drainage.
The temporal use of these cherts can be assumed to
represent the full range of human history. Because of an
apparent affinity to Paleoindian cultures, the materials
may be widespread as a reflection of either trade or
migration. Comparing this material to the Folsom
artifacts being found at Stewart's Cattle Guard site
(Peggy Jodry and Dennis Stanford, personal
communication) in the Great Sand Dunes National
Monument will be, to my knowledge, the first specifically
defined attempts to trace the source of Paleoindian
artifacts to the Chuska area. By including "Washington
Pass chert" in their classification of potential chert
sources used by occupants of three sites in the Waste
Isolation Pilot Plant project 40 km (25 mi) east of
Carlsbad, Reinsch, Meyer, and Lord (1985:128) imply
possible use of the Chuska materials that far to the
southeast, presumably resulting from trade. The
likelihood of being able to distinguish any of the varieties
of Chuska at that distance should be critically examined,
however. At Chaco Canyon, Cameron (1984:144) reports
that of five exotic material types identified, Washington
Pass chert was predominant, although the basic reliance
for the chipped stone tool industry was on local materials
derived from what Cameron calls "High Surface" gravels.

San Juan Mountains
In the San Luis Valley and upper Rio Grande Basin
lying between the San Juan and Sangre de Cristo
mountains, Button (1987:III-15) reports the San Juan
Mountains as the principal source of "black basalt or
pitchstone" that served as the dominant lithic material
found in archeological sites in the San Luis Valley. He
notes:
1. that Cochetopa obsidian sources were not "properly
documented prehistoric quarry" sources (of obisdian
but not the rhyodacite as discussed later) came from
mines of deeply buried perlite that were inaccessible to
prehistoric exploitation and
2. that the Cochetopa Park area contains only Apache
tears that were unusable as a source for producing stone
tools.
He does, however, point out that the flows that produced
those sources could also have produced other obsidians
that were known to the prehistoric people but unknown
to us.
Button (ibid.) also discusses the Trout Creek jasper
quarry about 129 km (81 mi) to the north as a likely
source of "fine quality red and yellow jasper", and local
sources of petrified wood as being of potential
importance in the San Luis Basin. According to Dennis
Stanford (personal communication), the Trout Creek
quarries are located in igneous rocks above Trout Creek
and along the northern edge of the San Luis Basin and

66

the southern edge of the Arkansas River drainage. The
chert occurs in several different varieties mostly in shades
of red, yellow, and brown. Ralph White has found
cobbles and pebbles typical of the brownish yellow jasper
extending downstream in Arkansas River gravels for a
distance of several kilometers almost to the Colorado
Springs area (White, personal communication). He is of
the opinion that translucency and the presence of clear
quartz-filled vugs may be distinguishing characteristics of
at least some Trout Creek jasper. Jasper that was first
reported in 1875 on Culebra Peak in the Wet Mountains
by A. R. Conkling (Banks n.d.:139) may be the same
material.
Stanford and Jodry (personal communications) have
informed me that a substantial amount of the lithic
materials found at the Folsom-aged Cattle Guard Site in
the Great Sand Dunes National Monument are
essentially identical in appearance to the petrified woods
found in the Dawson Arkose on the east side of the
Rockies. Those materials found in the San Luis Basin,
however, are locally referred to as Black Forest petrified
wood. Timothy Kearns (personal communication) has
found high quality brownish yellow petrified wood in
place in the Animas Formation of southwest Colorado
that is identical to the petrified wood found farther south
across portions of northwest New Mexico in the Kirtland
Formation. The differences, according to Kearns, are
related to the absence of gravel cortex in the materials
from the Animas Formation. It is his opinion that the
more southerly materials are of secondary deposition
derived from the Animas Formation. Whether this
material is the same as the "Black Forest" wood
mentioned by Stanford and J odry is as yet undetermined,
but they may be the same.
Kearns (personal communication) believes the Brushy
Creek Member of the Morrison Formation (also
discussed by Cameron 1984:140) in southwest Colorado
and southeast Utah contains one of the better varieties of
chert in that the materials occur in fairly large pieces that
are multicolored, opaque and waxy. The cherts vary
considerably in texture and to the west grade into a
quartzitic material like siltstone.
An unusual, green, igneous chert crops out in a small
area located in south central Colorado about 5 km (3 mi)
south of the Elk Creek-Conejos River confluence. The
chert appears to be of a localized nature related to the
Piedras Rhyolite of the Potosi Volcanic Group. To my
knowledge it has not been reported in any artifact
collections in the general area. It may or may not have
been used prehistorically. It is severely restricted in size
and possibly in geologic distribution.

Jemez Mountains
The Jemez Mountains include the range defined by
Ungnade (1983:80) as extending from Cerro Pedernal on

the north, south to Borrego Mesa near Jemez Pueblo, but
in this section the area north of Cerro Pedernal and south
of the San Juan Mountains is also discussed. The Jemez
Mountains are bordered on the west by the Sierra
N acimiento fault block that terminates immediately south
of San Pedro Mountain. San Pedro Mountain represents
the northwestern edge of the Jemez. The lithic resources
located within the region are varied igneous,
metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks that have served as
valuable raw materials for all prehistoric and historic
cultures occupying the region. Of specific relevance to
this report are the igneous sources of obsidian/rhyodacite
and the materials collectively referred to as Pedernal
chert, which is somewhat a play on words since Pedernal
is Spanish for flint. Cerro Pedernal (Flint Hill) is
regarded as the principal source for materials that are
variously referred to as chalcedony, agate, and jasper.
Silicified wood is also commonly associated with the
other forms of knappable stone occurring in tremendous
quantities as terrace deposits along the Rio Chama below
the Rio Puerco and Canones Creek confluences.
The Chinle Formation crops out extensively and at
various points across this area from east to west. Because
of the presence of the brilliant and multicolored silicified
wood and agate, jasper, and chalcedony commonly
associated with this formation in Arizona (the Petrified
Forest, for example), and with its lateral equivalent of the
Tecovas and Baldy Hill formations, it is common to
assume that many of the agate-jasper-chalcedony type
materials that occur as gravels of this general area are
derived from the Chinle. That may be true, but to my
knowledge, no concentra,tions of chert from this
formation have been specifically recognized as a valued
lithic resource.
It is easy to assume a relationship between cherts in
some of the Rio Chama gravel deposits, for example, with
the Chinle because of generic similarities, but without
question most, if not all, of those cherts are derived from
the Pedernal Chert Member (Figure 4.4) of the Abiquiu
Tuff of Miocene age defined by Church and Hack
(1939:620-621) rather than from any possible Chinle
source. Church and Hack (1939:626) attribute the origin
of the chert to an association with or replacement of a
limestone bed that is over 12 m (40 ft) thick in places.
Prehistoric quarries associated with the deposits on San
Pedro Mountain are merely mentioned. They are also
illustrated and discussed by Kirk Bryan (1938). The
presence of extensive prehistoric quarries in the Pedernal
Chert argues for the Pedernal exposures being the
principal resource of this material utilized throughout
prehistory of the area. Church and Hack discuss the chert
from the Abiquiu Tuff in several places, but their
principal description (Church and Hack 1939:620-621) is
as follows:
The Pedernal chert member of the Abiquiu
Tuff is a good horizon marker, extending
67

across the area from Cerro Pedernal to the
west side of San Pedro Mountain. The chert is
almost everywhere associated with a bed of
siliceous limestone which usually becomes
more siliceous from bottom to top, grading into
chert. In places there is chert at the bottom of
the limestone bed. This member is about 25 [8
m] feet thick on Cerro Pedernal. On Cerro
Valdez two thin beds of chert are separated by
about 100 feet [30 m] of soft material covered
with landslide debris. At locality B south of
J arosa two beds of chert are separated by
about 40 [12 m] feet of limestone. The member
consists of one bed of chert and limestone on
the east side of San Pedro Mountain. On the
west side of this mountain only chert was
found, although good exposures are rare in this
region. Thus the Pedernal chert member
appears to thin somewhat on San Pedro
Mountain. It may once have extended farther
to the west. The chert is remarkably pure and is
distinguished by its color, which is usually a
pearly white though flecks and stains of red,
yellow, and black, apparently the result of
weathering, are common. It is massive and
made excellent material for artifacts.
As indicated in Figure 4 of Church and Rack's
(1939:619) volume, the outcrops of the chert member of
the Abiquiu Tuff are much more areally extensive around
San Pedro Mountain and southeast of J arosa than they
are on Cerro Pedernal itself (Figure 4.5). The only quarry
sites (Figure 4.6) specifically mentioned by Church and
Hack are on the north side of San Pedro Mountain, but
almost certainly others must have existed. Although
Curtis Schaafsma (and possibly a few others) is very
familiar with the Pedernal cherts, they are not well known
in general in spite of their obvious importance. The
Pedernal quarries represent perhaps the best examples
of actual quarry sites in New Mexico. Chert gravels
derived from the Pedernal exposures certainly are in
massive amounts in the Rio Puerco-Rio Chama drainage
west and north of Cerro Pedernal and should occur as
gravels in the Rio Las V acas and Jemez drainages
flowing southward from San Pedro Mountain vicinity.
Church and Hack specifically describe more massive
deposits of the chert in the San Pedro. area than even
around Cerro Pedernal. Because the intervening terrain
between Cerro Pedernal and San Pedro Mountain is
heavily eroded, the chert originally located within that
region has to be well represented in area gravels.
Once removed from the general area of their origin,
Pedernal materials are very difficult to distingiush from
the other igneous and metamorphically produced cherts
such as the agate-chalcedony types, although the
Pedernal cherts may occur in relatively much larger
pieces than most others (such as the Apache Creek

materials discussed later). Interestingly, however, when
comparative analysis is employed for these materials and
those from the Chuska Mountains, they are
distinguishable. Another factor associated with the
Pedernal chert that warrants attention is that Church and
Hack (1939:619-620) describe the chert in association
with white siliceous limestone, which may or may not be
easily recognized as coming from the same source.
There is a considerably greater variety in color of the
chert gravels than indicated by Church and Hack, but this
too is very much in keeping with their suggestion that the
color variations stem from the effects of weathering. The
Pedernal cherts do vary considerably in physical
properties as indicated by the generic terms: agate,
jasper, and chalcedony. The colors range from pink, red,
brown, and white to black and various shades in between.
In many cases individual rocks are similarly multicolored.
The materials are available in boulder size pieces from
the deposits at Cerro Pedernal, and many of the cobbles
found in drainages from Cerro Pedernal are quite large.
Pedernal cherts also vary in diaphaneity, grain size, and
fracture. Characteristic fracture patterns, vugginess, and
possible origins as cavity fillings and geode-like structure
even in the larger pieces of the Pedernal cherts limit tool
production size.
In the middle reaches of the Rio Chama, a white chert
of uniform texture and color appears to be concentrated
in the Morrison Formation and eroding out on the
terraces in the immediate vicinity of the Christ In The

particular material is currently unknown. Flake debris in
the general vicinity on river terraces indicates that the
material was known and
utilized prehistorically.
For various reasons the
obsidian/rhyodacite sources in
this general area have been
subjected to more intensive
research efforts than have any
of the chert sources. The most
logical reasons are the
elemental homogeneity of the
volcanic glasses in contrast to
the cherts and the fact that
they can be more precisely
pinpointed by chemical
analyses (Baugh and Nelson
1987). It should be noted that
the rhyodacite discussed by
Newman and Nielson
(1987:263-264) is the same
material that has been most
commonly referred to as

Bryan and Butler 1940). Newman and Nielson
(1985:377-383; 1987:262-274) used x-ray fluorescence for
what is probably the best summation of the
obsidian/rhyodacite sources performed to date in this
subject area. They analyzed raw materials from seven
discrete sources, five of which are located within the
range of the Jemez Mountains, and the other two on the
Taos Plateau and from Mount Taylor northeast of the
Zuni Mountains. The location of Obsidian Ridge west of
the Bandelier National Monument is one of the best
known sources of 11 quarried 11 obsidian in the region.
Newman and Nielson's 1987 investigations produced
results from analysis of six sources located only on the
Taos Plateau. From this analysis they demonstrated that
"the rhyodacites of the Taos Plateau and northern Rio
Grande region of northern New Mexico provide for the
rare circumstance of the same high quality rock available
in distinct, discrete localities that can, however, be
identified and differentiated geochemically11 (Newman
and Nielson 1987:271).
In the Chaco studies referenced earlier, Cameron and
Sappington (1984:153-171) separated obsidian from
examination. They, too, used
other lithic materials
x-ray fluorescence to identify sources of obsidian, but
those sources included 24 different areas from New
Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Colorado, and Mexico. Out of
these 24 sources, only 12 were found to be represented at
Chaco Canyon. Of that number, 50% of the materials
came from the Jemez area and 25% from Red Hill. The
remaining 25% came from ten different sources, but no
one of those sources comprised as much as 10%
(Cameron and Sappington 1984:158). These researchers
provide explicit descriptions of each of the cited sources.
As discussed before, gravel deposits were often of
more economic importance than bedrock materials. The
study by Warren (1982:103-113) on the Rio Puerco
southeast of Mount Taylor and south of Albuquerque is a
classic example. In reference to the Hidden Mountain
project area on the Rio Puerco, which should not be
confused with the Rio Chama tributary of the same name,
Warren (1982:103) states that "except for a very few
intrusive artifact materials, all lithic types recorded at
archaeological sites may be found in the Ortiz gravel".
Warren (1982:104) further states: "Among [other rock
types, the Ortiz gravel contains] large clasts of mossy
chalcedony... and obsidian."
The chalcedony is described (Warren 1982: 103-105) as
two basic types: a "red mossy chalcedony which may have
eroded from the 'agate bed' of the Morrison Formation"
and a "clear chalcedony with black, brown, and white
inclusions ... which is widespread in northwestern New
Mexico ... [ and possibly] derived from a late Tertiary
silcrete". Warren (1982:105) also suggests. that "the
creme, yellow-brown, and occasionally red cherts" found
in the Ortiz gravel may have been derived from Upper
Permian deposits.

for

70

The rock types that Warren (1982:104) attributes to
being most important in the Ortiz gravels are the
black opaque obsidian cobbles ... on both sides
of the Rio Puerco ... on Ceja Mesa, on the high
surfaces of Monte de Belen embayment, and
on Montano Flats. The obsidian has been
found ... as far north as New Mexico Highway 6,
and at least 3 km [1.8 mi] south of Alamito
Arroyo. Unmodified cobbles up to 15 cm [6 in]
in length have been recorded .... This obsidian
has been identified megascopically and
optically as deriving from source areas in the
vicinity of Grants Ridge, northeast of Grants,
New Mexico.
A slightly more detailed description of the obsidian
provided by Warren (1982: 104) is that it is a "dense black,
appearing as opaque ... [with] abundant microscopic
inclusions of crystallite known as trichite .... [The rock]
has had widespread use and distribution throughout
northern New Mexico."
As pointed out earlier, the heaviest reliance for lithics
at Chaco Canyon was on gravels. Additionally, the
yellow-brown spotted chert Gasper?) referenced by
Cameron (1984:140-141) is located in a grossly defined
region and most likely results from secondary deposition
of some type.
At Fort Wingate east of Gallup, chert pebbles and
petrified wood occur in the sands and gravels along the
crests of some of the lower upland ridges. While they do
not represent major sources by any stretch of the
imagination, it should be noted that some debitage and
small flaked (tested) pebbles do occur in the area as an
indication of a cultural pattern of scouring the surfaces
for any available materials. It is also possible that the
larger and better pebbles that once existed in the same
areas are no longer present as a result of prehistoric
usage.

Zuni Mountains
The Zuni Mountains are not well known for their chert
resources. However, one particular material warrants
special discussion. Warren has collected a distinctive
chert type from the San Andres Formation in the eastern
flanks of the mountains that she and others commonly
refer to as "Fingerprint Chert 11 because of its peculiar
concentrically banded structure. Oddly enough, the same
type material is not reported by Kottlowski et al.
(1956:60-62) in the San Andres Mountains nor is it
reported in the geologic section from the type locality of
the formation at Rhodes Pass in the San Andres.
Kottlowski et al. (ibid.) simply refer to sparse chert in the
formation and to silicified fossils replaced with blue-gray
chert. The cherts collected by Warren are in the
Laboratory of Anthropology Research Section as

material type 1016 and were examined briefly by the
writer. They can best be described as four basic types:
1. a tan aphanic chert that is translucent on thin edges and
exhibits very subtle evidence of banding;
2. an opaque, dark gray to very light gray concentrically
banded chert that weathers to a pinkish cast;
3. a chert-cemented breccia that also exhibits some
mottling; and
4. a rather uniform grayish white chert with very finely
defined banding. The thicker banded alternating grays
are quite similar to the chert in the Cotter Dolomite of
northeast Oklahoma.
The most unusual characteristic of the chert is its
almost identical comparison to the Kay County cherts
from the Florence Formation of north-central Oklahoma
and south-central Kansas. The similarities result from the
fingerprint appearance. With the two chert types
occurring in such widely separated areas, the similarities
would not ordinarily be of any particular consequence.
However, the Kay County cherts are well known as trade
materials throughout the southern Great Plains and into
east Texas. Materials identical to those collected by
Warren have also been found as far east as the Three
Rivers Reservoir area west of Roswell, New Mexico, by
David Phillips. The San Andres Formation also crops out
in the southeastern flanks of the Los Pinos Mountains, in
the Sacramento Mountains, and it is the dominant
formation underlying the Chupadero Mesa and the
dominant formation covering ca 466 km 2 (182 mi 2)
between the vicinity of Vaughan, New Mexico, and south
to the Texas state line. Farther south in Texas, the
formation is simply included in undifferentiated
Leonardian rocks (Van Horn-El Paso Sheet of the Texas
Geologic Atlas 1968). For the greater part of the
geographic extent of the formation, chert is not reported.
This could result from the sporadic nature of the basic
lithology, from the chert-bearing zones being too deeply
buried, or from the incomplete knowledge of chert
occurrence in the formation.
The potential problem of not being able to readily
distinguish the Fingerprint chert from the Kay County
materials was well illustrated by my difficulty when faced
with identifying chert types from a southeastern New
Mexico cache for John Speth. Among other chert types in
the cache, such as Alibates and Edwards, was a type
identical to Kay County with the exception of an absence
of fusulinids (microfossils) so common to the Florence. I
was confident in identifying it as Kay County.
Fortunately, John Speth was familiar enough with the
Fingerprint chert to question my identification.
An absence of fusulinids in the San Andres material
collected by Warren was observed in the limited
collection examined microscopically by the writer, but
such consistency in a larger sample has not yet been
confirmed. Perhaps the most drastic distinction in the
two cherts is the potential size of tools that could be
71

produced. The largest sizes observed in the Fingerprint
chert are at most about 10 cm (4 in) in length whereas the
more abundant Kay County materials can be measured in
tens of centimeters.
While comparative analysis should usually be
conclusive in distinguishing between the two types, there
have been no attempts to establish analytical
comparisons or distinctions of the geographically
separated materials. Because this particular variety of
Florence chert is well known as a trade item throughout
the Southern Plains, detailed analysis of the two similar
cherts should be given a high priority in future Southern
Plains studies.

Sangre de Cristo Mountains
In spite of the geographic extent of this area and its
complex geology, the Sangre de Cristos seem to be of
relatively minor significance in terms of producing widely
recognized chert resources. Miller et al. (1963) do not
mention chert as a constituent of the lithology for any of
the formations in the mountains including the Madera,
which probably is the principal chert-bearing formation
of the area. Although the Morrison Formation crops out
along both the east and west flanks of the mountains, the
chert known to occur elsewhere in the Morrison does not
seem to be as prolific or perhaps is simply not well
enough recognized to be as notable as those materials
elsewhere.
Jay Newman's dissertation (in preparation) at
Southern Methodist University is based on lithic sources
related to the Pot Creek Pueblo and other sites in the
upper Rio Grande region of New Mexico. According to
Newman and to Fred Wendorf (personal
communications), substantial sources of cherts occur in
Mississippian-aged rocks as well as the Madera
Formation in the western flanks of the Sangre de Cristos.
Those materials were used by inhabitants of the Rio Gran
del Rancho vicinity. Newman is of the opinion that the
finer quality of gray, black, and whitish cherts in the
outcrops and in gravels in the area are quite similar and
possibly indistinguishable macroscopically from the
"Georgetown" variety of Edwards chert.
Based on a sample (limited in variation and size) of six
individual pieces examined by me, the materials should
be easily distinguishable by comparative analysis alone.
Small flakes and possibly very small artifacts from the
materials could be confused. Those cherts are banded in
various shades of gray ranging from almost white to
almost black. At least one specimen contained small
w~ite fragments of crinoid stems that would certainly be a
discriilinating factor between these cherts and Edwards.
Completion of Newman's dissertation will be a welcomed
contribution to chert source studies in an otherwise
unreported region of the mountains.

As noted earlier, the best known chert sources in these
mountains are those related to the Madera Formation
that crop out on a north-south alignment parallel to, but
west of the eastern edge of the mountains. Massive
outcrops occur in the headwaters of Gallinas Canyon
west of Las Vegas, but outcrops also occur around the
southern and southwestern edge of the mountains.
Madera materials vary considerably in color, texture,
and diaphaneity. The chert in Gallinas Canyon occurs
predominantly in shades of gray, is opaque, and tends to
exhibit a brittle fracture. Seven kilometers (4.3 mi) west
of Las Vegas, the Madera outcrops contain multicolored
chert pieces in very restricted sizes, unsuitable for
effective tool production for anything other than small
artifacts. Lithic debitage in the vicinity of the outcrops,
however, is indicative of its use as a prehistorically
recognized source. Paleoindian materials in the general
area attest to minor use of this or a similar source.
Madera cobbles and pebbles occur as major gravel
sources in both the Sapello and Pecos rivers emerging
from the southern flanks of the mountains. The gravels
range upward into large cobble and small boulder sizes,
and they occur in relative abundance on upland terraces
on the Pecos River at least as far south as Santa Rosa.

The in situ mountain sources do not appear to have been
used as extensively as have the secondary depositions of
gravel. This may be an erroneous perception since it is
based on an inadequate knowledge of lithic resources in
the mountains in comparison to those in the plains.
The Dakota Formation will be discussed in greater
detail in the Great Plains section of this report, but
exposures in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains warrant
mention.
The Dakota sandstone (quartzite) cropping out along
and parallel to the eastern flanks of the mountains
between Sapello and Las Vegas (Figure 4. 7) is generally
too coarse for production of most chipped stone tools,
but in localized areas those .rocks may have been used as
raw material for other chopping/cutting tools. Localized
occurrences of rocks with a better indurated or cemented
lithology is a relatively common phenomenon in the
Dakota Formation depending upon local conditions. The
outcrops along the Sangre de Cristos could very well
contain such localized areas that are currently
unreported.
Slightly to the north and east of Sapello, New Mexico, a
felsite dike crops out that also figured prominently as a
source of lithic materials for the R-6 Eden site (Stanford

and Patton 1984) excavated under the direction of
Dennis Stanford in the early 1970s. It is likely this felsite
and the Dakota materials from the Watrous "cave"
(Banks n.d.:100-102) are represented in the Claypool site
of nor the as tern Colorado, and if so, might also be
reflected at least in other Eden period sites in the region.

Mogollon Plateau
The discussion of this specific region of the study area
is possibly more overly simplified than any of the others.
Even the application of a name for the region as a whole
is grossly simplified because the area does include a
greater number of individual mountain ranges,
intervening plains, valleys, and seemingly isolated
mountains that do not, at face value, appear to be a part
of any particular range. The geology is complex because
the sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic rocks and
formations are so interrelated. Historically the area has
been one of the more active mining regions of the state
and this entire study area. The region includes all of the
area of New Mexico west of the Rio Grande Valley and
south of an east-west line running west from the vicinity
of Belen to the Arizona state line. The region is ruggedly
beautiful and arid, comprised mostly of desert
environment with some forested crests of the higher
elevations in the mountains.
The New Mexico Bureau of Mines and Mineral
Resources has publications covering many of the
individual ranges and geological quadrangles, but many
areas within the region still lack detailed geological
publications. This is especially true for reports
containing details related to cherts. Because the region
contains numerous mining districts that were active in the
latter 19th and early 20th centuries, much of the geology
in the area has focused on economic geological concerns
more than those considered herein. For this reason, as
well as the fact that the writer is not so intimately familiar
with the whole region, only selected areas are included in
the following discussion. This includes the easternmost
flanks of the Mogollon Plateau (that is, the eastern edge
of the Cookes-Mimbres-Black Ranges and the Sierra
Cuchillo that extend from south to north along the
eastern edge of the Plateau), the Animas Mountains in
the bootheel of New Mexico, and one locality of the
upland terrace of the Rio Grande west of Truth or
Consequences, New Mexico.
Considering the sustained archeological research in
this region for over a hundred years (Simmons et al.
1989:16) and the special attention given to the
Mimbres-Mogollon complex, it is surprising that lithic
materials research has not been commensurate with
other related archeological research. This is not meant to
imply that researchers in the area have totally ignored
lithic resources. It has been generally accepted that the
lithic materials recovered from sites of southwest New
73

Mexico are of igneous origin and from the mountains of
the area as well as from those in northern Mexico.
According to Harry Shafer (personal communication)
the sites near Deming, New Mexico, represent use of
locally derived rhyolite, felsite, and some chalcedony.
Shafer's statement concerning the use of lithic
materials on the southern edge of the study area is also
duplicated by Jim Rancier's opinion concerning lithic
materials on the north in the vicinity of Apache Creek.
There, the lithic materials are referred to as Apache
Creek chert. Materials collected by Rancier tend to be
clear, light gray to white, and very light pinkish
chalcedonic moss-agatelike materials that often exhibit
botryoidal as well as "plate chalcedony" structure.
Dendrites are fairly common. Some of the pieces grade
into darker gray to black colors. They appear to have
originated as siliceous filling of veins and geodes. Quite
likely the materials commonly recognized as agates,
jaspers, and chalcedonies are from igneous sources in the
intervening mountains. The materials give the impression
of being from geode and cavity linings similar to those
described by Tonking (1957:48) as "vein quartz and
chalcedony [that are] present as late interstitial and
amygdule-filling materials" in the La Jara basalt. If such
proves to be the case in future studies, a more
appropriate term for the cherts might be "La Jara" until
refined- designations could be determined.
Perhaps the lack of archeological attention to chert
sources in the area is surprising because chert sources
are described in some of the area's geological literature
and are reported as major natural resources. For
example in the bootheel of New Mexico, Thompson and
Jacka (1981) and Armstrong (1962) discuss chert
materials at some length. The fact that chert exists in the
formations does not automatically indicate prehistoric
usage, however. Thompson and Jack a describe
considerable quantities of black chert nodules in the
Pennsylvanian-Permian-aged Horquilla Formation, but
in the accompanying photographs it is obviously so highly
fractured that cultural usage would be severely limited.
Thompson and Jacka (1981:15) describe zebra-like
stripes of gray and black as a distinguishing characteristic
of chert in the lower Horquilla. They describe "nodules
varying from 1x3 cm up to 50 x 60 cm [0.4 x 1.2 in to 20 x
24 in]," occurring "in bands [whose] length-width ratio is
10:1 or greater ...2-10 cm [0.8 to 4 in] thick and 1 to 5 m
[3.3 to 16.4 ft] long that are generally parallel to bedding"
(Thompson and Jacka 1981:14). Coloration of the lower
materials is noted as brownish gray, light bluish tinge,
some white, and others black or brownish black.
West of Big Hatchet Mountain, Armstrong (1962:8)
states that "member B [of the Keating Formation] is thin
bedded and highly cherty- 20 to 40 per cent of the rock is
composed of chert in long, lenticular bodies which
frequently coalesce above and below with chert masses ....
Chert is well developed at Blue Mountain, Arizona,

the obsidian from Mule Creek in the southern Mogollon
Peloncillo, Animas, and Big Hatchet mountains of New
Mexico". . Armstrong later describes massive lenticular
area, and Red Hill in the northern Mogollon area, based
chert beds of "wide areal distribution [extending] from

noted that Purves (1978:238)
correlates the Lake Valley
Formation not only with the
Escabrosa but also with the Red
Wall and Modoc formations that
crop out in areas outside this study
area. The Thunder Springs
Member of the Red Wall is a
principal chert-bearing formation
in southwest Colorado, southern
Utah, and northern Arizona.
None of the deposits discussed
by Thompson and Jack a,
Armstrong, or Purves have been
examined in enough depth to
facilitate archeological needs. In
fact, the documentation of any
appreciable knowledge of the
existence of the cherts by
archeologists has not been very
productive. James Neely, the only
archeologist found so far to have
had any appreciable knowledge of
the deposits, reports (personal
communication) that the Lake
Valley cherts are quite varied in
color and quality and appear to be
represented as only minor
assemblages in sites farther to the
south. Neely also states that the
Mule Creek obsidian in southwest
New Mexico occurs as gravels
along Mule Creek that are eroded
from perlite beds farther
upstream. An article on the

In the Lake Valley Formation Jicha uses the variations
of chert and the absence of chert in the Nunn member to
distinguish between individual units. A brief examination
of the Lake Valley type locality by the writer and John
Schelberg indicated that these distinctions appear to be
reliably consistent. Float materials on the steep slopes
below the outcrops include a range of the three basic
chert types (Figure 4.8), but in each case the usefulness of
the materials for stone tool production is limited because
of the highly fractured and/or ill-shaped chert nodules
(Figure 4.9). No specific evidence was observed of

however, does show evidence of limited prehistoric
exploitation. At this particular outcrop (that measures no
more than 200 m (656 ft) in length and less in width),
some igneous activity in direct contact with the limestone
appears to have resulted in a higher quality of chert being
produced. This locality is typical of silicification
associated with igneous activity in the region as described
by Jicha (1954:62) who states:
Silicification in and around the mineralized
area is marked. In the Cookes Peak district
there are scattered masses of silica overlying
the Fusselman limestone outcrop. These
appear to be remnants of a siliceous layer
which formed at one time along the contact
between the limestone and the overlying
Percha shale. At some localities the base of the
shale has been found to be silicified over small
areas. The silica is generally in massive form
and has the appearance of chert, chalcedony,
or jasperoid, the shade depending upon the
amount of associated iron .... At several
localities a complete transition from limestone
or sandy limestone to massive silica may be
traced along such beds. Such siliceous masses
are found also along nearby faults. Silicification

appears to be related to ore deposition. The
ore bodies are surrounded by silicified
limestone, which is silicified most intensely
where closest to the ore bodies.

In addition to the detailed descriptions of
chert-bearing rocks in the region, Jicha (1954:7) also
provides what may be very important references to a
series of multicolored quartzites from the Bliss
Sandstone in the Cookes Range to perlite in various
areas, and to a number of outcrops of rhyolites. On page
46, for example, he describes "masses of yellowish,

likely took place in the immediate area. Another item of
special interest for the chert shown in Figure 4.11b is an

Because of the work by Jicha and Purves the
chert-bearing formations in the Lake Valley area are
probably better defined than those in any other part of

the Black-Mimbres Ranges. Because of shared
stratigraphy common to other ranges in the Mogollon
Plateau as a whole, some analogies can also be
realistically inferred for those areas where the same
formations occur, but where specific geological
investigations may not have been made.
77

Palomas Gravels
The upper Cenozoic Basin fill of the Rio Grande
Valley from the northern edge of the San Luis Valley in
Colorado downstream to some point below El Paso,
Texas, is all a part of the same geologic deposition
referred to as the Santa Fe Formation or Group. Within
certain reaches along and adjacent to the Rio Grande,
high level terraces of Santa Fe sediments have been
subdivided into member units of the formation. In the
area between the Black-Cuchillo ranges and the Rio
Grande, the Santa Fe is capped by a high level erosional
surface of sediments called the Palomas that have been
given formational status by Lozinsky and Hawley
(1986:239). The Palomas Formation is composed of
~arious lithologies including alternating sands, silts,
volcanic ash, gravels, and fanglomerates up to 131 m (430
ft) in thickness (Lozinsky and Hawley 1986:242).
The specific relevance of the Palomas Formation to
this discussion concerns a section measured by Lozinsky
and Hawley on the south side of Palomas Arroyo in
which clasts of limestone, chert, red (Abo) siltstone, and
various igneous rocks occur. The clasts are reported as
averaging 6-8 cm (2.4-3.1 in) in diameter, but can be as
large as SO cm (20 in) (Lozinsky and Hawley:1986:24S).
In this same vicinity, John Schelberg and the writer were
taken to an exposure of chert cobbles (Figure 4.12a) by
John Downs, a local rancher-real estate broker. Downs,
who is quite knowledgeable of the local archeology,
attributes designation of the area as a quarry site to Pat
O'Brien who was surveying the route for a power
transmission line from Phoenix, Arizona, to Deming,
New Mexico. The site is located on the surface of the
Palomas Formation, and exhibits the full range of rock
types described by Lozinsky and Hawley for the
formation. Of course, those of concern here are the
cherts. They vary in size from pebbles to small boulders
as well as iiregularly shaped masses that cannot be
classified as gravels. Considerable debitage occurs in the
general area, but no specific quarry pits were observed.
The cherts are illustrated in Figure 4.12b and are
respectively:
1. a dark gray (N3) to grayish black (N2) chert (Figure
4.12b, right) with excellent conchoidal fracture. It
exhibits indistinct bedding planes or laminae that do not
affect the fracture. White hairline fractures healed with
pale bluish white quartz are present. The rock is
aphanic and has a dull to slightly vitreous luster. It
weathers to a mottled very light to light gray (N6 to N7)
color.
2. distinctive mottled chert of a basic light gray (SY 7/1)
to gray (SY S/1) with dark dusky red (lOR 3/3 to 3/4)
irregularly shaped splotches and veins (Figure 4.12b,
center). Parts of the rock appear to be tightly cemented
chert breccia. It is opaque and has an aphanic texture,
although the fracture tends to be uneven.
78

3. a chert (Figure 4.12b, left) which would easily be
confused (at least in small pieces) with certain varieties
of petrified wood occurring in the Great Plains. It is
opaque and exhibits subtle banding accompanied by
swirls. The color varies from basicÂ· reddish yellow
(7.5YR 6/8) to pale red (SR 6/2). Bands and swirls occur
in shades of grayish red (SR 4/2) and pale reddish
purple (SRP 6/2). It had dull luster and good
conchoidal fracture. It lacks any evidence of woodgrain
although it has wood-like appearance.
Other type materials from the Palomas gravels that are
not illustrated are described as:
1. a white opaque chalcedonic type material that contains
tiny pinpoint sized vugs filled with red clay(?). Clear
quartz has completely filled old fracture patterns in the
rock.
2. a banded yellowish brown (lOYR S/8) chert with
distinct thinner bands of vivid red (lOR 4/6). It is very
fine grained to aphanic in texture, is opaque, and has a
slightly uneven to brittle fracture, although flakes in the
area attest to its knappable qualities.
3. a subtly banded chert oflight olive gray (SY 6/1), grayish
orange pink (SYR 7/2), and pale reddish brown (lOR
S/4) colors. It exhibits splotching of a grayish brown
(SYR 3/2), is aphanic, opaque, and has excellent
conchoidal fracture.
It is obvious from the chert types represented in the
gravels that their likely origin is in the Black-Cuchillo
ranges to the west. Lozinsky and Hawley (1986:239-24S)
also attribute sources of origin for the Palomas rocks to
the Caballos Mountains located to the east and across the
Rio Grande valley.
The chert types found at the Palomas workshop site
are also represented as debitage seen on the surface of
Mogollon ruins located in the general vicinity along
Palomas Arroyo.

Manzano-CabaHo Mountains-Pedernal
Hills
None of these areas are particularly kno\vn as principal
sources of chert, but the importance of including such
areas in this discussion stems from the fact they they
appear to have been essentially ignored as potential
source areas. The Manzanos, for example, are primarily
composed of igneous and metamorphic rocks, and in
such casÂ·es as the J arillas discussed later, it is easy to
underestimate the potential influence of minor chert
comppnents. For sites in the local area, they may have
been of major importance. In spite of the emphasis on the
igneous rocks of the Manzanos, however, Smith (19S7:2S)
does report chert nodules being present in the Madera
Formation outcrops that occur along the eastern edge of
the mountains. Similarities and distinctions between the

Madera chert in this region from the same rocks in the
Sangre de Cristos need to be examined.
The Caballo Mountains are not known as a major
source of knappable stone, but Kelly and Silver (1952)
describe chert in the Sierrite-Bliss formations of
Cambrian age and in the lowermost member of the El
Paso Formation. The chert is exposed along the west face

of the south Red Hills, the south end of Nakaye
Mountain, and the west face of Red Horse Mountain. It
is described as light gray to white on fresh surfaces (Kelly
and Silver 1952:43). They discuss chert in the vicinity of
Bat Cave in the Cutter Formation that is dark gray to
black and occurs in bands 5-15 cm (2-6 in) thick and as
rounded nodules 2.5-25.4 cm (1-10 in) in diameter; in the

Lake Valley Limestone as being badly fractured; and in
the Bar-B Formation as being "mottled and weathering
tan to yellowish brown (Kelly and Silver 1952:84).
The Pedernal Hills, which should not be confused with
Cerro Pedernal north of the Jemez Mountains, warrant
brief attention, not because of reported chert sources, but
because of their name. The Pedemal Hills (or uplift)
located east across the Estancia Valley from the
Manzanos are basically Precambrian and some Permian
rocks. Chert is not mentioned in the geological literature
as being present at all, but since Pedernal is the Spanish
term for flint, at least some minimal attention should be
given to determining the source for the geographic name.
It is also interesting that the San Andres Formation that
occurs extensively around the Pedemal Hills is not
described by Smith (1957) as containing any chert. Here
too, such negative evidence, without the benefit of field
verification, should not be considered conclusive.

San Andres-=FranklinSacrament0=-Jarma Mountains
These three ranges and the Jarillas are discussed as a
group because they all belong to the same geologic
structural system even though the Tularosa Basin lies
between the San Andres-Organ-Franklin alignment and
the Sacramentos. The Organ Mountains separating the
Franklin and San Andres ranges are dominantly igneous
and metamorphic. As such they will not be discussed to
the same extent as the others in this area. They do,
however, contain minor chert elements common to the
two adjacent ranges. Located immediately off the
southwesternmost end of the Sacramento Mountains are
the J arillas.
In general, several of the geological formations
described here have lateral equivalents in the
Black-Mogollon Ranges as well as in the
Hueco-Corunadas area to the south of the Sacramento
Mountains.
The mountain ranges adjacent to the Tularosa Basin
are all products of the same episodes of orogeny. The
mountains themselves are principally a series of
upthrown fault blocks associated with the major system
that produced the Tularosa Valley. The valley on the
other hand occupies the graben resulting from
downthrown blocks. The fault blocks that produce the
sedimentary portions of the mountain ranges dip to the
east and west on the opposing sides of the valley resulting
in the more vertical inner-facing walls (Figure 4.13).
Those "walls" expose more complete sequences of
exposed stratigraphy than do the downward tilting
western and eastern flanks of the San Andres and
Sacramentos respectively.
The most relevant geology of the area is provided in
the reports by Kottlowski et al. (1956), Harbour (1972),

Pray (1961) and Hawley (1983). Kottlowski et al. do not
provide much information specifically on the chert
materials, however. It is of particular interest that chert is
mentioned in the San Andres Formation by Kottlowski et
al.(1956:62) only in reference to silicified fossils.
Relevant information from the other sources is
summarized as follows.
Harbour (1972) reports the presence of chert as lenses
and nodules in seven different formations from five
different geological periods in the Franklin Mountains.
Most likely the cherts occur to some extent in those same
formations that also crop out in adjacent mountains. The
formations are: Precambrian-aged Castner Limestone;
Ordovician-aged El Paso Limestone and the Aleman and
Cutter members of the Montoya Dolomite; Silurian-aged
Fusselman Dolomite; Middle Devonian-aged Canutillo
Formation; Mississippian-aged Las Cruces Limestone
and Rancheria; Pennsylvanian-aged Magdalena (La
Tuna, Berino, and Bishop Cap) Formation; and the
Permian-aged Hueco Formation (Harbour 1972:11-57).
Harbour points out that the "Middle Devonian chert" is
the same chert as that in the Hueco Mountains to the east
and is probably a lateral equivalent of the Caballos
Novaculite near Marathon, Texas, about 322 km (201 mi)
to the southeast (Harbour 1972:36). He also describes "a
felsite sill about 5 feet [1.5 m] thick [that] forms a wide
band in the lower member of the El Paso Limestone on
the west side of the Franklin Mountains. The felsite is
ivory to white, dense, and aphanitic" (Harbour 1972:59).
This, too, could be of potential archeological interest.
Althoug~ the basic geology provided by Harbour is good,
no specific details are provided for discrimination of the
cherts from one formation to another. As usual such
detail on chert constituents is beyond the scope of the
purposes of geological investigators. In connection with
investigations at Rhodes Canyon on the White Sands
Missile Range, Hawley (1983:20) identified the
Pennsylvanian-aged Lead Camp Formation (a probable
correlative to Harbour's La Tuna and/or Berino
members of the Magdalena), Mississippian-aged Lake
Valley Formation, and the Ordovician-aged Aleman
Dolomite and El Paso formations as being the principal
chert-bearing units in the San Andres. Beckett (1983:101)
suggests that the Paleoindian occupation of the canyon
stemmed as much from attraction to the black and
black-banded cherts (probably from the Lead Camp
Limestone) quarried there as much as from any other
factor. Beckett also cites a statement from Dennis
Stanford that materials from Rhodes Canyon are
manifest in artifacts at the Lone Butte site mentioned
previously, but according to Stanford (personal
communication), he was referring to the Fingerprint
chert from the San Andres Formation instead of the
more uniformly horizontally banded gray and black chert
described by Hawley. It is more probable that the

FiiguJre 4.13. Looking west at Sallll Andres Mounrntains from vicinity of Lake Lucero. (Pltnoto was reversed from
nortltn fo south wltnen transferred from slide to photograph.)

Fingerprint chert is derived from the Sacramentos to the
north of the Lone Butte site.
Though referred to as an "inferior chert", the
Rancheria chert from the Franklin and Organ mountains
was identified as comprising 31 % of the total chert
sample found in three sites excavated in the Keystone
Dam project in El Paso by Carmichael (1985:202). The
Keystone sites are located 4.8 km (3 mi) west of the
southern Franklin Mountains. Carmichael also separates
rhyolites from the Franklin-Ogan mountains into three
distinct types: Thunderbird, Soledad, and Picacho
(Carmichael 1985:203). In the Sacramento Mountains,
Pray (1961:31,43) discusses chert in the El Paso
Formation as "common, but sporadic nodules of light to
medium gray that rarely exceed 2-3 inches [ca 5-7 cm] in
diameter"; in the Montoya and Valmont formations as
light gray in color and occurring as "large smooth nodules
resembling pillows in size and shape". Descriptions such
as this seem incredible especially since the materials are
essentially unknown archeologically.
Pray reports abundant chert comprising as much as
one-third of the geologic section of the Fusselman
Formation. Those materials are primarily gray to
brownish gray in color and weather to a brownish yellow.

They have a "porcellaneous texture". In the Onate,
Holder, Beeman, and Gobbler formations, chert is
defined as being minor and occurring as nodules. He
describes chert in the Lake Valley Formation as light
gray nodules; in the Gobbler Limestone as "conspicuous
black chert masses; and as sporadic and minor nodules of
a light gray color in the Bug Scuffle Limestone Member"
(Pray 1961:47-82). The Lake Valley is of Mississippian
age as noted earlier and the Gobbler-Bug Scuffle
formations are of Pennsylvanian age. Though the Bug
Scuffle is described as a member of the Gobbler, it is also
referred to as a "formation" in some places.
In addition to the chert-bearing rocks in the
mountains, the foothills and upper margins of the
Tularosa Valley contain considerable quantities and
varieties of chert cobbles of sufficient size and quality
(Figure 4.14) to produce serviceable tools, and certainly
smaller artifacts such as arrow points and scrapers.
Specimens collected on this highly eroded eastern toe of
the San Andres foothills and west of Lake Lucero are
illustrated in Figure 4.15.
The J arilla Mountains rise like an island above the
floor of the Tularosa Valley (Figure 4.15) and are
separated from the southern Sacramento Mountains by

Sa.n Andres Mou.ntaiims and Lalke Lu.cero, New Mexico. Loolking northwest

some 25 km (16 mi). While the relatively barren Jarillas
are most noted for igneous and metamorphic materials,
two particular sources are worthy of note here. Tightly
embedded chert nodules and thin lenses do occur in the
Pennsylvanian-aged (Madera?) limestone that crops out
particularly in the southwestern edge of the mountains.
The chert is opaque, highly fractured in rectangular
blocks, and exhibits fine laminations. The colors vary
from greenish beige to medium dark blue gray, and black
with well-healed, quartz-filled fractures. Within the same
rocks, the gray colors often grade into reddish purple.
Whether this results from weathering or basic
depositional characteristics is unknown. Banding and
thinly laminated bedding are common characteristics. A
single specimen of jasper that would ordinarily be
associated with deposits such as the Trout Creek
materials was also found in the J arillas. It varies in color
from yellow-brown to a dark purplish red. It was,
however, highly fractured and vuggy, an<;l not suitable for
tool production. Its presence in the J arillas urge caution
in attributing similar material types in the area to more
distant sources. In spite of the inability to find larger and
more isotropic pieces of the material suitable for tool
production, the J arilla cherts are extensively represented

82

as debitage in sites located in the valley adjacent to the
Jarillas.
The J arillas were also a source of turquoise. This fact
does not seem to have been well known in the past,
although Helene Warren (1988:278) indicates a rather
lengthy history of knowledge has existed about its
occurrence in the area. Both Warren and U ngnade
(1983) discuss the fact that the turquoise was of sufficient
quantity and quality in the late 19th century to at least
warrant limited commercial production. Late
Mesilla-Dona Ana sites to the west of the J arillas contain
artifacts that possibly came from this source rather than
from the more traditional turquoise sources to the
northwest (Chapman et al. 1986:77-85). Turquoise from
this area could also be a factor in the presence of the
materials in the Patarabuey-Jumano sites located farther
to the southeast as discussed by Kelley (1987:128-130).

Guadalupe-Sierra DiabloMountains
East and south of the Sacramento-Hueco mountains,
the Guadalupe Mountains of southeastern New Mexico

west of the Guadalupes. The mountains are

Formation of Permian age. The Van Horn-El Paso
Sheet (1968) of the Texas Geologic Atlas shows "thin
beds of green siliceous shale and chert" as being present
in the formation.
In the Sierra Diablo region, King (1965:36) reports
chert in the Aleman Member of the Montoya Dolomite
as comprising 30-40% of the lithology in "closely spaced
layers a few inches thick that taper as long lenses".

stratigraphically similar to the Sacramento and Hueco
mountains, but to my knowledge archeological references
don't exist for the lithic resources of the area as they do
for the other ranges. According to Boyd (1958:4-43) five
basic geologic units produce chert in the central portion
of the range. All are of Permian age. The chert is
described as abundant in the Cutoff and Victoria Peak
members of the Bone Spring Formation, in the Yeso, in
the Cherry Canyon sandstone tongue, and in the San
Andres. None of the chert nodules or beds are described
in any detail. In comparison to other formations, the
cherts sound relatively minor, but the fact that cherts do
occur should be of note. The brief descriptions are
summed up as follows. The lower 91 m (298 ft) of the San
Andres contains abundant chert nodules; in the Broke
Off Range along the southwest side of the Guadalupes,
the chert is described as nodules "2 to 6 inches [ca 5-15
cm] in length" and near the Texas-New Mexico border
the Cut Off Member of the Bone Spring Formation
contains beds of chert, but the "layers are irregular and
not more than 2" [ca 5 cm] thick" (Boyd 1958:43). Chert in
the Cherry Canyon Formation is not discussed except for
the notation that the formation does contain chert.
In the southern part of the Guadalupe Mountains, the
principal sedimentary formation reportedly containing
chert is the Pipeline Member of the Brushy Canyon
83

The extreme southwest corner of Texas is one of the
most interesting, yet least known regions within the study
area. The region includes a number of relatively small
mountain ranges in addition to the better known ranges
illustrated in Figure 4.1.
The formations discussed for the Franklin-San
Andres-Sacramento mountains also apply to the
northwesternmost section of this region. So little work on
lithic materials has been done, and the similarities and
distinctions between rock types in the various ranges are
so poorly known, that precision in sourcing artifacts to
any specific formation or quarry area is tentative at best.
While only a few of the ranges are discussed here, others
may, and probably do, contain chert sources beyond
current comprehension. Also, as pointed out by Robert
Mallouf (personal communication) many areas in this
region contain large amounts of high quality petrified and
often opalized wood that was widely used as raw material
for tools. A major source of this material is reported by
Mallouf (personal communication) in the Rosillos
Mountains, where he and Virginia Wulfkuhle (Mallouf
and Wulfkuhle 1988:13) also report "black hornfels,
silicified wood, various rhyolites and felsites, quartzites,
and jasperoid materials" as being "local to the Rosillos
foothills, to outcrops on gravel ridges of the
encompassing basin zone, or to floors of arroyos in both
the basin and foothill zones". They also cite the possibility
of "gray limestone cherts" being derived from the chalk
hills immediately north of the Rosillos. From a site in
Mexico about 32 km (20 mi) south of the Rosillos in
Chihuahua, Mexico, Mallouf (1987:45) quotes Lovering
( 1972:6) in assigning the use of local j asperoids to the
manufacture of 73% of the Perdiz points in the Las
Haciendas cairn burial although the cherts are not
attributed to a particular source.
Mallouf is probably better acquainted with the chert
sources of the general area than any other archeologist.
His master's thesis (1985) and other reports (Mallouf
1987; Mallouf and Tunnell 1977) represent the most
Â·substantial archeological publications addressing lithic
materials in the region. The various sheets of the Texas
Geologic Atlas that encompass the region provide most
of the details necessary for initiation of fieldwork related

to chert studies. The volume by Maxwell et al. (1%7) is
also of indispensable value in the specific area of the Big
Bend National Park. To a large extent these noted
sources are relied upon for this discussion. The subject
region lies southeast of the Hueco and Franklin
mountains discussed earlier, includes the Davis
Mountains, and extends southward and southeast to
include all of the Big Bend country and that area east to
the Rio Grande-Devil's River confluence.
Isolated outcrops of the Fort Terrett and Segovia
members (the principal chert-bearing units) of the
Edwards Group are interspersed throughout northern
portions of this region, but the actual presence of chert in
those outcrops is an uncertainty that needs to be
resolved. Also, throughout this extensive mountainous
region, chert in the form of chalcedony, agate, and jasper
is associated with many of the igneous rocks that remain
poorly described for archeological purposes. For
example, several local ranches have been opened for
lapidarists or "rockhounds" to collect gem quality stones
for cutting and polishing. These same sources most often
were also utilized for stone tool production by prehistoric
and historic Indian groups. The Woodward ranch
southeast of Alpine is an example, but many other similar
sources exist also. The chert-bearing igneous rocks on the
Woodward ranch are probably related to the Potato Hill
Andesite which at least in some areas has been defined as
producing "a large amount of secondary silica as granular
quartz and fibrous chalcedony fillings" (West Texas
Geological Society 1949:74).
Mallouf (1985:Figure 1) divided the eastern
Trans-Pecos area into three, more or less parallel
"sectors" extending from the southeast to northwest for
the purpose of discussing ecology and lithic resources. In
the foothill zone of the Southern Sector, Mallouf states
(1985:12) that
extensive ... outcrops of chert, novaculite,
r hyolite, and hornfels [occur] that have been
intermittently quarried by man for thousands
of years .... Of equal importance to [the Burro
.Mesa quarries] are bedrock outcrops and
colluvial/alluvial deposits of black hornfels that
are intimately linked to rhyolitic and granitic
laccoliths such as form the Chisos and Rosillos
mountains. In these areas compacted
sediments were long ago metamorphosed by
contact with expanding volcanic magmas and
ancient pyroclastic flows. Black hornfels
quarry debris, debitage, and tools are found,
sometimes in massive quantities, in prehistoric
sites throughout Big Bend National Park and
adjacent areas, as well as in the riverine zone of
the Rio Grande as far downstream as Amistad
Reservoir in the Lower Pecos Region, where
this material was obtained from redeposited
gravels of the mainstem river.
84

Mallouf has recorded dozens of hornfels quarries in
this region (personal communication), but according to
Mallouf (1985:14) other Tertiary-aged igneous outcrops
in the region also contain trachytes, tuffs,
rhyolites, basalts, sandstones, novaculites,
quartzites, opalites, and agates, limestones,
jaspers, mudstones, and siltstones. The floors
of basin-zone arroyos that emanate from the
mountain ranges frequently contain a wide
range of such materials and are assumed to
have served as major aboriginal source areas.
Less is known concerning stone resources in
the central and northern sectors of the region,
although Shafer (1970), Katz and Katz (1974)
Hedrick (1975) and Boisvert (1980) recognize
a variety of cherts, cherty limestones, and
quartzites as common elements in
archeological assemblages of the Guadalupe
Mountains area. A variety of distinctive, high
quality cherts of uncertain origins are reported
from sites in the Salt Basin vicinity (Rohrt and
Skinner 1974; Cliff and Field 1980). ~
Other interesting facts reported by Mallouf (1985:88)
are "quarries constitute only 5% of the recorded
components in the region, undoubtedly a reflection of
bias on the part of investigators" and "intense occupation
of arroyo courses in the basin zone suggests an
availability of water and food resources greater than that
of today, implying a somewhat less harsh environment.
The arroyo floors probably always provided good sources
of stone for tools" (Mallouf 1985:120).
The Burro Mesa Quarries and the Caballos Novaculite
are by far the best-known, but by no means the only, lithic
sources of the region. The Burro Mesa Quarries (Figures
4.16 and 4.17) that are probably located in the.
Pleistocene-aged Old Quaternary Formation (Emory
Peak-Presidio Sheet of the Texas Geologic Atlas 1979)
have been described in some detail by Campbell (1970).
According to him, the chert is "red, brown, candy striped,
white, [and] mottled" (1970:15). Cherts collected by
Mallouf from the Apache Springs area of Burro Mesa
and examined by the writer fall within the range
described by Campbell, but they also seem to be more
variegated. In some specimens small portions could be
confused with varieties of Alibates. In general, though,
the Burro Mesa cherts tend to be grainier and exhibit less
luster than most forms of Alibates. Flakes or small
artifacts such as arrow points made from the two
different sources would be the most difficult to
differentiate, but as a whole comparative analysis
between the two material types would provide
distinguishing characteristics.

Texas Historical Commission.

Geologic Atlas (1979) describes coloration in the
Caballos cherts as "gray to green, brown and gray
banded ...moderate to dark red, and brownish yellow in
part translucent".
On the Emory Peak-Presidio Sheet (1979), the
Pennsylvanian-aged Tesnus Formation is described as
containing "some chert", but the nature and description of
the rock is not mentioned. King (1980:7) only refers to
chert pebbles and fragments in the Tesnus that were
derived from the underlying Caballos. He also states that
the "pebbles are commonly cemented by chalcedony". In
the Dimple Formation that overlies the Tesnus, King

(1965) and has generally been accepted as being typical
of the Caballos in general.
The 365 m (1200 ft) high Caballos Mountain is the type
locality for description of the Caballos N ovaculite, and
the entire northern face of the mountain is composed of
white novaculite (Baker and Bowman 1917:96). Baker
and Bowman apparently were the first geologists to
recognize technical distinctions between chert beds and
those of novaculite in the same formation. Folk's
classification has been previously modified by Sholes to
accommodate the color variation in the Arkansas
Novaculite. The Emory Peak-Presidio Sheet of the Texas

(1980:8) discusses chert-pebble and chert-cobble
conglomerates as well as a fades farther to the southeast
that grades into shales and spicular cherts.
Permian cherts in the Texas Geologic Atlas (1979) are
defined as being present in the Cibolo, Pinto Canyon, and
Ross Mine formations, but chert descriptions are not
provided. Cretaceous formations described as
containing chert are:
1. the Del Carmen which produces gray "chert nodules
and masses up to 10 meters in size [depth?] and beds
exceeding 10 feet in length";
2. the J avelina, Aguja, and Shafter are particularly noted
for containing silicified wood; and
3. the Yucca and Santa Elena formations produce chert
cobbles and pebbles that are described as "variously
colored" (Texas Geologic Atlas 1979). King (1980:22)
refers to "prominent ledges as thick as 10 feet [3 m] of
light gray, dense or finely crystalline limestone,
containing rudistids and much concretionary chert" in
his discussion of the Del Carmen and Fredericksburg
formations in the Glass Mountains. He does not identify
the precise formation in reference to the chert, but he
is probably referring to the Del Carmen.
The Cretaceous-aged Buda Limestone is not known to
contain chert as such, but it does contain rock that is
"porcellaneous, hard, [has] conchoidal fracture, and [is]
grayish white" (Emory Peak-Presidio Sheet 1979).
Northeast of Big Bend, an extensive area between the
Pecos and Devil's rivers includes significant outcrops of
the Devil's River Formation in the Edwards Group which
is described as containing chert, at least in this area.
With the exception of the Caballos Novaculite and the
materials from Burro Mesa, the other cherts in this area
remain undescribed archeologically.' Even in those
formations described in geological literature as being

87

chert producers, the most basic descriptions of the
materials are lacking. The actual distribution and extent
of chert in any one of the formations is also unknown.
Given this state of knowledge, any further discussion
concerning potential use of the materials is needless at
this time. In addition to the in situ rocks of the region,
secondarily deposited materials in the stream gravels and
terrace deposits are of at least equal importance as lithic
sources. This is exemplified by the gravel terraces that
occupy intermediate positions between "lower silts and
higher colluvial talus slopes along the Rio Grande below
the Big Bend area (Mallouf and Tunnel 1977:30).
Mallouf and Tunnel (1977:34) go on to state:
Although the rough surfaces of these deposits
are not conducive to habitation, they provide
excellent lithic resource areas for aboriginal
populations. The greatest variety of raw
materials is contained in the mainstem river
terraces where chert, flint, agate, quartzite,
chalcedony, basalt, limestone, schist, ryolite
[sic], silicified wood, metamorphosed clay, and
other stone types conducive to utilization by
human groups are found commonly and
procured easily.
One of the more intriguing caches of artifacts possibly
representative of ceremonialism associated with lithic
procurement is that of the Livermore Cache (Mallouf
and Wulfkuhle, in preparation) found at the highest point
of Mount Livermore in the Davis Mountains. According
to Robert Mallouf (personal communication) most of the
1700-plus points in the cache were manufactured from
chert very similar to that from Burro Mesa, but geologists
working with Mallouf have informed him that the chert is
probably from essentially identical materials that crop
out in the Davis Mountains.

This study unit is considerably larger in geographic
extent than any other section of the overall study area,
and it also contains the greatest amount of physiographic
variability (Figure 5.1). It includes that portion of the
southern Great Plains in eastern New Mexico (east of the
Pecos River); southeastern Colorado (ten counties); the
High Plains (Llano Estacado in Texas), all of Kansas
within the study area except for the southeasternmost
counties that lie within the flanks of the Ozarks and Little
Ozarks; all of north-central and northwest Texas lying
west of eastern edge of the Wes tern Cross Timbers and
north of the Edwards Plateau and the Llano uplift
(Central Mineral Region); and all of Oklahoma except
for the eastern third of the state included in
Ozark-Ouachita-Gulf Coastal Plain areas. Within this
"plains" context two mountain ranges, the Arbuckles and
the Wichitas, are also included. This study unit, like
others in this volume, is subdivided into physiographically
definable units beginning with the areas of eastern New
Mexico and southeast Colorado.

Eastern New Mexico-Southeast Colorado
This area includes that region lying between the Sangre
de Cristo Mountains and the western edge of the High
Plains in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Colorado, and the
. Pecos Basin of New Mexico. In the 1931 archeological
survey of eastern Colorado directed by E. B. Renaud,
Beaubien (1931) provided a chapter entitled "Materials"
that for the most part included lithic materials. That
regional perspective and the more recent regional
investigations by the Smithsonian Institution (Banks n.d.)
illustrate the limited nature of relevant chert types in the
lithology of southeast Colorado. Also in the John Martin
investigations (Eddy 1981:70-71) the sources of 17
identifiable material types (with the exception of Alibates
and obsidian) were attributed to local gravels in the
Arkansas River terraces. The obsidian was logically
presumed to have come from the upper Rio Grande
sources, and the Alibates, of course, from the Alibates
quarries in the Texas Panhandle. Though the assumption
by Eddy (ibid.) that the materials were of local origin
from gravels is logical, they provided no description of
those local materials for comparison. The list of materials

89

represented in the sites are: "igneous (basalt, granite,
andesite, and rhyolite), metamorphic (quartzite) and
sedimentary (chert, jasper, chalcedony, quartz, petrified
wood, obsidian, siltstone, agate, sandstone, and shale)"
(Eddy 1981:70).
A lateral equivalent of the Tecovas and Chinle
formations is known in northeast New Mexico as the
Baldy Hill Formation (Foster 1966:84). The chert in the
formation, known by the same name, so closely resembles
some of the Alibates that it is often called "False
Alibates". Comparative analysis, however, will usually
provide distinctions between the two materials. The
Madera Formation that was discussed earlier in the
Sangre de Cristo Mountains is probably the most prolific
chert producer for this section also. Since the formation
crops out around the southwestern and southern edges of
the mountains and extends northward parallel to the
eastern flanks, the terraces and upland surfaces along the
Pecos River contain almost limitless quantities of Madera
chert in addition to quartzite and other igneous rocks
that were influential in stone tool production throughout
eastern New Mexico (see Mobley 1978).
Geological publications (i.e., Mankin 1972:95-96) often
refer to the Middle Jurassic (Morrison) agate beds in this
general vicinity, but as noted elsewhere (Banks n.d.:140),
the agate does not occur in a form that could be
effectively used for tool production. On the J aritas Ranch
east of Springer, New Mexico, archeological sites exhibit
considerable use of banded or laminated silicified
siltstones occurring in various shades of gray to black
colors and of graywacke type materials that are
indubitably of a local, possibly unique origin. Jack
Hughes (personal communication) is of the opinion that
these materials result from low grade metamorphism.
The materials are rarely the subject of extensive efforts in
identification. Specific sources are as yet undefined.
In contrast to the sparsity of chert in the area,
quartzites are relative abundant, especially in selected
areas. The Dakota Formation, originally defined by
Meek and Hayden (1862: 439), is the principal source for
many of the better quartzites. The Dakota is probably the
greatest single contributor of Great Plains quartzites
although comparatively few localities within the total
extent of the outcrops provide quartzite that is of

knappable quality. The indurated and silica-cemented
areas are quite localized and by no means have they all
been identified.
The Dakota Formation, under a series of different
nomenclature (see Banks n.d. for details) crops out
discontinuously across the Great Plains from the vicinity
of Tucumcari, New Mexico, along the Front Range of the
Rockies, in the northwestern portion of the Oklahoma
Panhandle (Black Mesa), eastern Colorado, western
Kansas, and across Nebraska to its type locality in
Dakota County, Nebraska. The Dakota (Cloverly)
produces the extensive Spanish Diggings quarries in
eastern Wyoming where both quartzite and jasper occur
(Holmes 1919:210-211; Banks n.d.:96-102), and it is the
formation which has the Flint Hill quarries in South
Dakota described by Waldo Wedel (1953:23). Wedel
(1943:58) also discusses the possibility of the Dakota in
the Smoky Hills as a source of artifacts found in Missouri.
A single workshop/quarry locality in the Dakota
Formation will be discussed for this study unit. (Three
others are noted in the Great Plains section.) Here, the
locality of interest is on the south side of the Mora River,
southwest of Fort Union, New Mexico. My first
knowledge of it came during 1973 Smithsonian field work
at a Cody Complex site (Stanford and Patton 1984) near
Sapello, New Mexico. More discussion of the locality is
presented in Banks (n.d.:100-102). The locality is best
known because of its proximity to a bluff shelter, the
Miller or Watrous "cave" (Banks n.d.:100-102), but
teepee rings also occur just south of the shelter. By the
time of my first visit to the site, the shelter was already
essentially stripped of cultural deposits. Notably,
however, hammerstones and lithic workshop debris were
observable among the material discarded during
"excavation" of the shelter.
The outcrop forming the bluff above the shelter is the
Dakota sandstone (Dane and Bachman 1965), but based
on petrographic analysis performed by Roger Bowers the
sandstone has been partially metamorphosed to chert.
The .chert occurs as relatively thin ( 6-7 cm thick)
discontinuous lenses of nodule-like rocks that exhibit
some evidence of pinch and swell structure. The chert is
very distinctive as white, tan, and various shades of
grayish green banded chert. Some iron oxide staining in
some of the rocks prompted Wylie Miller to think that
minor portions of the quartzitic chert could be confused
with "bacon rind" Alibates, but none of the rocks could
realistically be confused with Alibates. Some of the
examples are illustrated in Figure 5.2. Perhaps the most
significant aspect of these rocks is their very close, if not
identical, appearance to chert types represented in the
Eden artifacts from the Claypool site of northeastern
Colorado.
Other outcrops of green chert and quartzite occur
along the rugged escarpment of the north side of Sapello
Creek above its confluence with the Mora River, but the

rocks are of limited quality because of their general
characteristics of colliform structure and vuggy nature.
The same rock types Â·also crop out along the low ridge
extending southward from the vicinity of Watrous, New
Mexico.
A general problem in reliably determining the source
of quartzite localities can be highlighted in this particular
region, although the problem certainly exists in other
areas as 'well. The massive amounts and variability of
quartzite in the Dakota Formation alone is a difficult
problem to resolve, and when the complications of
redeposition and weathering in later deposits such as the
Ogallala are considered, the problem becomes more
acute. Certain varieties of quartzite can be related to
more locality-specific areas, but a great deal more
research is needed before this problem can be resolved.
Mobley (1978) discusses this same problem related to
materials found at the Los Esteros (Lake Santa Rosa)
project. He points out that the late Frank Briolo thought
it was possible to isolate a singular source near Grady,
New Mexico, for a specific purple and white variety of
quartzite, but Belcher (1975:11, 57) reported similar
sources "near Glorieta Mesa, Las Vegas, and Fort
Sumner, subsumed under the term 'Rio Grande Gravel"'

(Mobley 1978:258). The Rio Grande gravel discussed by
Belcher is quite likely to correspond very well
lithologically with the Potter-Ogallala materials eroding
from the High Plains as discussed in the Uvalde Gravel
section of this report.

The High Plains
Stretching northward from the vicinity of Sheffield,
Texas, to the southern escarpment of the White River in
South Dakota, and rising above the adjacent terrain with
a noticeable and oftentimes imposing height, the High
Plains represents one of the most consistent landforms
common to a multistate geography. This physiographic
section of the Great Plains Province in several respects is
a world of its own. Originally the plain was even much
greater in area. During the Pliocene Epoch it extended
outward from the Rocky Mountain Cordillera to points
as far east as Salina, Kansas, and Fort Worth, Texas
(Byrd 1971:41), and remnants occur as far to the north
and east as Salina, Kansas (Geologic Map of Kansas
1964). And for all practical purposes, the Ogallala
Formation is the uppermost geological unit that forms its
flat surface. The late Byron Leonard informed the writer
that he had examined remnants of the Ogallala Plain as
far to the southwest as Mountain Air, New Mexico. The
only point where the plain is still "attached" to a section of
the Rocky Mountain Cordillera is in southeast Wyoming
where the "gangplank" extends westward from the area of
Scottsbluff, Nebraska, to the Laramie Range. The Llano
Estacado is the southernmost subdivision of the High
Plains Province. As a rule the Llano is normally
considered to consist of that portion south of the
Canadian River.

Llano Esfacado
The Llano Estacado, or "Stockaded Plains", refers to
that section of the High Plains province located south of
the Canadian River in eastern New Mexico and the Texas
Panhandle, but in this discussion that portion of the High
Plains province to the north of the Canadian in Texas,
Oklahoma, Colorado, and Kansas is also included. This
area can be defined with considerable geographic
precision because of the well marked delineation of the
High Plains escarpment with which it coincides. It has
been described (Wendorf 1970:23) as one of the flattest
surfaces on the face of the earth covering some 129,500
sq. km. It also contains one of the United States' most
highly recognized lithic resources in the Alibates
National Monument located northeast of Amarillo,
Texas.
Ali bates
The general vicinity of the Alibates was first mentioned
in literature by Abert (Carroll 1941:64) and Issac Cooper
writing uner the pseudonynm Francois Montaignes
91

(1972:118) stemming from the 1845 Abert expedition
down the Canadian River from Bents Fort. The name
Alibates was first used for the formation by Gould
(1907:17) from the creek of the same name, that
according to Bowers (1975:5, quoting H.E. Hertner) was
attributed to corruption of "Allen Bates", the name of a
local rancher's son on whose land Alibates Creek
occurred.
Alibates "flints" are possibly more widely reported in
archeological literature than any other single lithic
resource. In spite of this, the variability in physical
characteristics of the raw materials is poorly known by
most archeologists and inadequately described in print.
Two sections in the Jones-Miller manuscript on lithic
resources (Banks n.d.:61-67, 181-193 respectively) are
devoted to the Alibates and Tecovas materials from this
area. The most substantive geological report on the
Alibates to date is the Master's thesis by Roger L. Bowers
(1975). Tunnell (1978) discusses specific lithic resources
related to this general area, and Hughes (1976) provides
a review of the principal references to chert sources of
the Texas Panhandle as of that date. So much has been
written about the Alibates in other referenced sources,
there is no need for repetition here, but the fact that the
Alibates materials probably have received greater
distribution temporally and culturally on a geographic
basis than any other single chert type warrants repetition.
It is also worth noting that Bowers and Reaser (n.d.)
attribute chertification in the Alibates Dolomite to
secondary replacement from the silica-rich Ogallala as a
by-product of the calcification process. Some of the more
typical specimens of Alibates are illustrated in Plates 9
and 10 of Appendix A, and Figures 5.3-5.5 are general
scenes of the quarry areas.
At a distance between 160 and 275 km (100-172 mi)
downstream of the easternmost Alibates outcrops on the
Canadian River, Don Wyckoff (1988:15) conducted a
much needed model study of Alibates occurrences as
gravel. The study considered size and shape of individual
gravels, isotrophy, and quantities as criteria for potential
lithic resource evaluation for stone tool manufacture. The
study found 39 individual exposures of gravel in three
major transects across the Canadian's valley.
Interestingly enough, the larger cobble sizes from a
sample of 1365 specimens occurred on the tertiary rather
than first or second terraces along the river (Wyckoff
1988:20). Cobbles from 12.8 cm to 14.5 cm (5-5.7 in) were
found in 4 of the 39 exposures. The largest specimens
observed during the survey of some 30.0 cm (12 in) in
length came from modern gravel quarries in Dewey and
Roger Mills counties (Wyckoff 1988:23).
Farther downstream at a distance of 612 km from the
outcrops, Perino and Caffey (1980:135) report that
Alibates artifacts smaller than 6 cm (2.4 in) in length
represent the third most common lithic material found in
sites during the survey of Lake Eufaula. Small cobbles are

Tecovas
The Tecovas Formation was also
first named by Gould (1907:20-29)
but is probably best described in
general terms by McGowen et al.
(1979). The formation contains
variegated jasper that is much more
widespread geologically and
geographically than the Alibates.
Although the Alibates is more
restricted geologically to a localized
area, the sheer mass of available
chert is much greater than in the
Tecovas. Within the total range of
Tecovas variability, there are
materials that are easily confused
with some of the lesser known
varieties of Alibates, and with other
chalcedonic type materials. Lynn

Extensive outcrops of the Dockum

may vary from pebble size (16 to 64 mm, 0.6 to 2.5 in)
concerning the origin of chert in the Tecovas Formation,
through the cobble range (64 to 256 mm, 2.5to10 in), and
Mallouf (1989:313) points out that "the Tecovas

discussed Chinle of New Mexico and

(Foster 1966:84). The point of
departure in defining those materials
as Tecovas versus Chinle in the

and along the margins of the
physiographic section in New Mexico
has not been addressed in geological
literature. In the southern part of the

quartzites in the area may be from
the Morrison Formation rather than
the Dakota, clear distinctions have
yet to be made.
The best reported lithic source
from this area was called Tesesquite
Quartzite by Saunders (1978). That
report is suggested reading for the
best details available to date on the
lithic materials of the area. In
addition to the quartzite from the
Black Mesa area, a Pliocene-aged
basalt is also present. Saunders,
however, only reported a total of 14
artifacts made of this material from
26 sites included in his survey.
In the vicinity of Springfield,
Colorado, the Dakota quartzite was
used extensively. The relatively low

found in the Ogallala Formation as in situ materials and
in the Potter Gravels as defined by Patton (1923:78-80),
the extensive Ogallala Group (Banks n.d.:137-155). A
brown to tan and more rarely a whitish opal also occurs in
various outcrops throughout the Ogallala (Banks
n.d.:154). That material was rarely made into tools, but as
attested to by frequent debitage in the vicinities of
outcrops, attempts were made to work it. At least one
locality in the Ogallala is atypical of the above
description. In the Palo Duro Creek area of the
northeastern Texas Panhandle, Peterson (1988:286)
reports "numerous artifacts composed of opalite [that
are] found in the valley". He (ibid.) correctly states that
"the vast quantity and high quality of the opalite found in
Palo Duro Creek area is perhaps unique", and he also
reports the location of a specific quarry site (41 HF 098;
Peterson 1987:97, 238) for the better grade material.
Along the east-central flanks of the Llano near
Justiceburg, Texas, Boyd (1988:190-197) discusses lithic
resources as a part of the archeological investigations at
the Justiceburg Lake project. Tecovas cherts are notably
absent in Boyd's discussion related to the local outcrops,
although both the Trujillo and Tecovas formations of the
Dockum Group occur in the immediate vicinity.

formations in Colorado and Kansas. These are the
Kimball, Sidney, Ash Hollow, and Valentine (Lugn
1939:1245-1275). Of importance here is the fact that the
Ogallala (in its different members where they can be
recognized) provides a considerable variety of stone used
for prehistoric tool production. The more northerly
sources and rock types for the Central Plains have been
described in some detail elsewhere (Banks, n.d.), but with
the exception of a distinctive green quartzite and white
chalcedony found in southern Nebraska, the materials
are quite similar. Within this study area, the lithic
materials can be described as a silicified siltstone (or
orthoquartzite), opalite, and as a wide-ranging variety of
quartzite, chert, and petrified woods that occur primarily
in the Potter member of the formation. The most
commonly accepted origins of Rocky Mountain cherts
that contributed to the Ogallala gravels crop out along
the Front Range, but most of those contributors are
better known for their chert inclusions farther north than
in this study area. Those formations are the Fountain (a
lateral equivalent of the Madera), Lykins, Ralston Creek,
Dawson Arkose, and the Morrison (Banks n.d.:138).
Other material types in this area include many forms of
quartzite (both orthoquartzites and metaquartzites)

95

Apparently they simply do not contain chert in this
locality.
The predominant lithic materials recorded by Boyd in
the area are quartzites and chert from the Seymour
Gravels and chert from the Edwards Group. The
Seymour is one of the eight names applied by C.L. Byrd
to the gravel deposits from the Ogallala related to the
Uvalde Gravel as discussed earlier. In Potter County,
Texas, Patton (1923:80) estimated the Potter "Formation"
gravels to consist of 80% gravels of quartz and quartzite.
The Seymour gravels and the other lithic types utilized
in the Wichita River area (Salt Study Areas VII, VIII, and
IX) are discussed by Meeks Etchieson, Roberta Spears,
and Jack Hughes. In that study, they concluded that the
Potter chert and undifferentiated quartzite from the
Seymour gravels greatly dominated the representation in
stone tools in the project area.
In that same volume, Hood (1978) provides a concise
analysis of the lithic assemblages represented in the
Seymour Gravel Formation. Massive concentrations of
gravel occur as outwash from the High Plains as remnants
of the Potter Gravel and as constituents of the Seymour.
Hood states his belief that "the majority of material found
in the Seymour Gravel was redeposited from erosion of
the Potter Gravel" (1978:380). These concentrations
occur at numerous places adjacent to the High Plains
escarpment (see later section on southwestern
Oklahoma).

Smoky Hills
The chert-bearing rocks of the Smoky Hills lie
immediately to the north, but outside of this study area,
and warrant brief mention here. The Smoky Hill Member
(Craigin 1896:51) is the uppermost geologic unit of the
Niobrara Formation. Between the Rocky Mountains
and the Flint Hills of Kansas, the Smoky Hill is the
principal chert-bearing formation of the central Great
Plains.
Although the Smoky Hill Formation crops out in many
other places in Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado, and
Wyoming, and is a lateral equivalent of the Apishapa
Shale of southern Colorado and northern New Mexico,
the only places where in situ chert has been found by the
writer is where the Ogallala Formation overlies and is in
direct contact with the Smoky Hill in the same
relationship as that described for the Alibates. (Under
normal stratigraphic sequence, several hundred feet of
the Pierre Shale separates the Smoky Hill from the
overlying Ogallala.) The chert in the Smoky Hill chalk
results from silica replacement of chalk in the uppermost
levels of the formation.
The known temporal distribution of Niobrara material
ranges from Paleoindian to historic Plains Indian times.
Smoky Hill jasper artifacts are common in sites
throughout the north-central portion of the study area,

96

and several large bifaces made from the cherts are
present at the Spiro site in eastern Oldahoma. The cherts
occur in colors of red, yellow, green, brown, black, and
even shades of white. Rarely do they exhibit any
translucency, even on thin edges. The cherts
characteristically display banding and laminae that occur
most often in tandem or multiple colors. The cherts for
the most part are readily distinguishable, except perhaps
for the white and gray varieties.
The principal area of the formation that produces
chert lies north of the Great Bend of the Arkansas River.
A concentration of quarries located in the Graham,
Trego, and Gove counties intersection was reported to
the members of the Kansas State Historical Society
(Martin Stein, personal communication). The chert was
originally defined as Graham jasper by Norton
(1939:1811). Since that time it has been discussed in
various archeological reports as Niobrara or Republican
River jasper, as Niobrarite by Wright (1985), an<;l
colloquially as Quartelejo jasper. (For detailed
description see Banks, n.d.:156-181.) The Smoky Hill
materials were the principal subject for trace element
analysis used in attempts to determine the raw material
source of artifacts from a series of Great Bend sites in
central Kansas by Spielmann and Blackman (1983). The
analysis by Spielmann and Blackman included a sample
of 65 collected along a 5 km (3.1 mi) stretch of outcrops
near Collyer, Kansas. Although some apparent patterns
were discernible between cherts from the various
locations, the investigators were unable to produce
conclusive proof of isolated discrete areas within the
formation that had uniform trace-element signatures. As
with other chert outcrops of any appreciable areal extent,
Spielmann and Blackman concluded that more rigorous
sampling in outcrops as well as river gravels of the region
was necessary.

Flint Hills
The Flint Hills of Kansas and north-central Oklahoma
are referred to as a cuesta by Fenneman (1931:614) in the
Central Lowlands Physiographic Province. The Flint
Hills (Figure 5.9) extend north to south across the entire
state of Kansas in a belt 80 km (50 mi) in average width.
They contain at least 13 different chert-bearing
formations. Selected examples of typical materials are
illustrated in Appendix A, Plate 12. In general the
formations are aligned parallel to the north-south axis of
the cuesta, and they range from youngest to oldest
proceeding in a west to east cross section. That is, the
descending order of formations shown in Table 5.1 for
the Chase and Council Grove Groups occur more or less
in narrow parallel bands from west to east across the
Flint Hills. Haury (1979) has produced a comprehensive
description of chert and the chert-bearing formations of
the Flint Hills. The reader is referred to that report for

details. She has also discussed the Flint Hills materials in
a broader context in the volume edited by Butler and May
(1984).
In terms of areal extent, volume, and variability, the
Flint Hills represent one of the major resource areas of

short of realistic potential. The southernmost portion of
the Flint Hills has the most prominent quarry area within
the entire physiographic region. Numerous, extensive
quarries occur from Kay County, Oklahoma, north to
Maple City, Kansas (Figures 5.10-5.12). Sudbury (1971)

chert in the United States, but the relatively small
proportion of actual quarries in the Flint Hills in
comparison to the extent and magnitude of chert is
somewhat surprising. Wedel (1959:476)has expressed
similar sentiments by stating
the only quarries in Kansas that can be
certainly attributed to aboriginal chert
gatherers, are in the Flint Hills upland. The
largest and best developed are in southern
Cowley County, near Maple City (14C05).
Here, and southward into Kay County, Okla.,
are extensive outcrops of a thick-bedded
Permian limestone interbedded with nodular
chert.
Although more quarry areas have been recorded
elsewhere in the Flint Hills since the date of Wedel's
statement, the actual number of quarries still seems far

has concisely described the Kay County quarries, and
Vehik (1985) relied upon this material which she refers to
as Florence-A in establishing settlement patterns related
to late prehistoric chert procurement. Artifacts derived
from the quarries were extensively traded, especially so
during the Caddoan and Plains Village periods from
about A.D. 1000 to European contact. Based on surface
collections made in the early 1970s by the writer and John
Reynolds (Kansas Historical Society) from a series of
well-exposed Wichita cache pits or house sites along the
Cow Creek tributary of the Arkansas River, the Kay
County variety of Florence chert appeared to occur in
percentages equal to Alibates types.
Skinner (1957) erroneously attributed the Kay County
Quarries to the Wreford Formation, but he provides
petrographic analyses of three different chert specimens
collected between Hardy, Oklahoma, and Maple City,

Kansas. A summarized description of the chert in general
resulting from those three analyses is worthy of
repetition:
This rock is a fine-grained organic chert which
was originally a calcarenite. The banding is
discernible in thin-section only with low-power
magnification. The banding appears to be a
weathering phenomena due to alteration of
hematite to limonite in fronts of penetration
through ground water action. Fusilinid
sections, spicules, ostracod shells, straight and
curved shell fragments, etc., are characterized
by coarser chert than the finer ground mass. A
flattened crinoid stem plate with typical
inclusions is shown in Plate 9, fig.l. The calcite
is not completely replaced by silica (Plate 9,
fig.4). Large, incompletely replaced
unigranular masses of calcite traversed by silica
seem to prove a replacement origin. A
tendency to linear orientation of the organic
fragments is striking. The pigment consists of
hematite altering to limonite and clay and is
more concentrated in the more organic
portions of the slides. Many impurities are
visible and are apparently an allogenic residue.
A few dolomolds with an occasional dolocast
are present. The fossil structures are more
readily detected with uncrossed nicols
(Skinner 1957:42-43).
Cooper (1975:185-192) studied archeologically known
distribution of the Kay County Flint. She also discusses
comparisons of heat-.treatment experiments conducted
over different periods of time ranging from 55 minutes to
5 hours and 10 minutes, and at different temperatures.
The experiments were, however, conducted in an oven
rather than outdoor fires, which does seem to produce
some different results than those of prehistoric activities.
Test excavations conducted by the Kansas State
Historical Society in actual quarry sites have provided
unprecedented insights into prehistoric quarrying
procedures, although the cultural affinities are still not
well known. Some of the excavations were made in
Pottowatamie County and in the Vermillion Creek
drainage of the Kansas River basin outside this
immediate study area, but the information is too
important to ignore. Because of the distance between the
two specific quarries being discussed here, it can be
assumed that the methodologies employed were much
broader than any single cultural or temporal entity. The
following information is derived from personal
communication with Martin Stein, who has also
graciously provided the insightful photographs of those
test excavations. The excavations were conducted to
obtain raw chert material from the vicinity of actual
quarries for comparison to archeologically recovered
artifacts. The excavations produced much more valuable

data than this, however. The captions on the associated
photographs (Figures 5.13-5.18) provided by Stein are
self-explanatory. It is important to note that the
prehistoric quarrying process was more intensive,
innovative, and representative of more in-depth
knowledge of stratigraphic geology than previously
demonstrable. In both cases it seems obvious, for
whatever reason, that available surface materials were
ignored in favor of obtaining raw material from in-place
deposits that required considerable effort to exploit. The
use of specialized trenches (Figures 5.16-5.18), and
actually breaking through overlying limestone strata to
expose the chert nodule/bedded materials is quite
different technologically to a process of simply finding
thinly covered ledges of chert or nodules exposed along
erosional scarps and working inward from that point.
Even the fact that the trenches themselves were
backfilled (to prevent exploitation by others?) by the
prehistoric excavators is enlightening information.
Finally, the use of antler wedges to separate the chert
nodules from the surrounding limestone host-rock is an
especially noteworthy revelation. The ancient technology
represented in this series of photographs should not
come as a surprise, but the fact that it has been
demonstrated archeologically is new and different.
The quarries at site 14C05 (Figures 5.16-5.18) are in
the northern portion of the "Kay County Quarries"
although they are located in the southern edge of Kansas.
The chert formation is the Florence. Site 14P057 near
Havensville, Kansas, is located in the Three Mile
Member of the Schroyer Formation.
The geologic character of all the Flint Hills' formations
is essentially the same. That is, they are horizontally
alternating beds of limestone, chert (as nodular but
discontinuous lenses, and less commonly as bedded
chert), and shales. Chert nodules can be found eroding
out around the edges of the numerous scarps in the
region, and all the streams contain ample amounts of
chert cobbles eroded from the different formations.
During his sojourn of 1840 in western Missouri and
southern Kansas the Frenchman Victor Tixier
(McDermott 1968:254) referred to flint being so
abundant in the range of the Osage that they preferred
flintlock weapons over the more effective caplocks, an
obvious but indirect reference to both the Flint Hills and
possibly other areas to the east. This statement warrants
some attention in historic archeological studies for more
refined attempts to discrimination between European
versus native-made gunflints in the region.
As a rule the geological formations (and the
chert-bearing components) thin to the south in the Flint
Hills. Also there are variations in the chert within a
single formation over the entire extent of the outcrops.
The distinctions from one formation to another are
certainly not well defined.

Verdigris River
Between the eastern edge of the Flint Hills, the
western edge of the Ozarks, and south of the area earlier
referred to as the Little Ozarks at least two specific
formations crop out along the Verdigris River and
contributed heavily to the stone tool industry at sites in
this particular drainage. They do not, however, seem to
have had much influence outside the drainage basin.
This, in all liklihood, is attributable to the volumes and
quality of chert sources available in the adjoining regions.
At the same time, considering the differences in the
source areas, it is almost surprising that the local cherts
had as much of an influence as they did. For example, at
the Will Rogers site (34R010) that the writer is most
familiar with, by far the greatest percentage of the
artifacts were manufactured from locally available
materials. The site contained Archaic as well as
protohistoric components. Though a specific study on
identification of the chert artifacts was not made, I
remember relatively few that came from formations
outside the Verdigris basin. The two formations are the
Oologah Limestone and the Worland Member of the

102

Altamont Formation, and both are of Pennsylvanian age.
Chert from the two formations are illustrated in Figure
5.19.
According to Gould (1896:68 and 69 respectively) the
Altamont Formation was defined and described by G.I
Adams in 1896 as a "hard siliceous limestone bluish to
light gray in color yielding abundant chert on
weathering", and the Oologah Limestone described by
N.F. Drake (1897:69) as a "hard massive bluish, cherty
limestone". Little prehistoric use of these cherts is
manifest beyond the Verdigris River Valley.

Wichita Mountains
The Wichita Mountains are composed primarily of
igneous and metamorphic rocks (Havens 1977), and like
others, such as the Manzanos of New Mexico, are not
well known for chert, but the northern flanks of the
mountains contain sedimentary rocks that have some
potential for chert production. Because the Wichitas
were already in place by the time most of the
chert-bearing formations were laid down, the
sedimentary rocks generally lap horizontally onto the

flanks of the igneous core of the mountains. The rocks of
the Arbuckle Group described by Taff (1928:76) contain
minor amounts of chert The Viola Formation, a lateral
equivalent of the Big Fork Chert, also crops out in the
area. As pointed out elsewhere (Banks 1984:83-84), it still
remains to be determined what the nature and extent of
chert in the formations actually are as related to potential
tool production. Quartz crystal, as a source of chipped

104

stone tools, is not as commonly reported from the
Wichita Mountains as it is in the Ouachitas for example,
but Northcutt (1981) has reported on a unique site in the
edge of the southern Wichita Mountains that indicates a
considerably heavy reliance on quartz crystal. Perhaps
not too surprising in this area is the fact that the material
was used for utility tools, unlike the more ceremonially
related usage in the Caddoan area. Reid Perring

(personal communication) reports that quartz flakes are
not uncommon on sites in the Fort Sill area.
In addition to the use of the quartz, Northcutt (1981:8)
also describes a chert type called Westgate "Flint" as a
type of Wichita Mountain jasper. The rock is
a pearly to dull, opaque material with
conchoidal fracture and dark brown or black
cortex. Dominant colors of dark red, brown,
black, and blue are the most common. Cortex
has small air bubbles indicating a molten
origin. This material outcrops in
isolated large cobbles in loose soil
at the southwest edge of the
Wichita Mountains, roughly seven
miles northwest of the Job Corps
Site.
Lawrence LeVick (Blair, Oklahoma)
has found some unusual lithic materials
that were being utilized for tools to the
west of the Wichita Mountains that may
have been a result of secondary
deposition. The rocks are best
described as a silica-cemented
conglomerate or breccia that in some
cases resembles varieties of the
Tecovas jasper in coloration. The
geologic and cultural distribution of the
material is unknown, but the range is
most likley restricted in both
categories.

southern Arbuckles may have adversely affected, to some
degree, ease of chert exploitation for tool manufacture.
The Arbuckles are primarily composed of igneous and
older Paleozoic-aged rocks. Ten different geologic
formations or members of formations from Ordovician,
Silurian, and Devonian periods have been previously
discussed in regard to their chert-bearing characteristics
(Banks 1984:69). Physical characteristics of the chert
types from each of the units, however, have not been
described in any particular detail in archeological or

Arbuckle Mountains
A substantial amount of geological
literature exists for the Arbuckle
Mountains and formations found in the
mountains as well as adjacent areas.
The mountains trend along a roughly
east-west alignment for a distance of
about 240 km (150 mi). The
easternmost edge of the mountains are
only some 25 km (15.6 mi) from the
western edge of the Ouachita
Mountains. An outlying section of the
mountains located across the Hunton
Anticline, and along the northernmost
edge of the mountains is referred to as
the Lawrence Uplift. The Lawrence
Uplift is located in the headwaters of
the Boggy River tributary of the Red
River. The Washita River flows
through the central Arbuckles, picking
up and carrying chert cobbles to the
Red River. Similar in several respects
to the Ouachitas, the steeply dipping
character of the formations in the

descriptions of the cherts and
chert-bearing formations in the
mountains.
The chert-bearing formations of the
Arbuckles share closest similarities to
those of the same formation or their
lateral equivalents in the Ouachita
Mountains. Some of the more relevant
geological formations are often
referred to by their group ranking in
three major groups: the Arbuckle,
Simpson, and Hunton. In addition to
these groups, three individual
formations are also of importance in
the region: the Viola, Frisco and
Woodford. The chert-bearing
formations will be discussed by
ascending order of age beginning with
the oldest.

geological literature. Also, the nature and consistency of
actual chert constituents in each of the units are poorly
known. For example, although the type locality of the
Woodford Formation is located in the southern flanks of
the Arbuckles, and the formation is basically a chert
formation in the Ouachita Mountains, chert has not been
reported as a major constituent of the dominantly shale
formation in the Arbuckles. The early report by Reeds

The Arbuckle is comprised of eight
different formations, but only two are
particularly noted for their
chert-bearing characteristics. Even
here available details are greatly
lacking. These are the Cool Creek and
McKenzie Hill formations.
The Cool Creek and McKenzie Hill
limestone formations of Ordovician age
are described as being cherty by Hart
(1983}, but no other published details
are available at this time about the
cherts. Joe Winters, of Tulsa, has
informed the writer of finding grainy
blue-gray and mottled chert that
roughly resembles the Keokuk in what
he believes to be Cool Creek-McKenzie
Hill rocks north of the town of Mill
Creek.

Simpson

The Simpson was originally defined
as a formation but was raised to group
status by Decker and Merritt
(1931:11-12) The group is composed of five formations.
Like the Arbuckle, only two are of specific use here.
These are the Oil Creek and Joins formations.
The type locality for the Joins Formation was on the
Joins Ranch to the north-northwest of Woodford,
Oklahoma, and the Oil Creek type locality is on Oil
Creek four miles southeast of Sulphur, Oklahoma
(Decker and Merritt 1931:13and18, respectively).

Although Hart (1983) also indicates the presence of
Viola, Woodford, and Hunton outcrops along Buckhorn
Creek in the vicinity referred to by Wyckoff, it is most
likely that the Lowrance cherts are from the Oil
Creek-Joins Formation shown cropping out parallel to
Buckhorn Creek. The cherts are atypical of types that
can confidently be attributed to the other chert-bearing
units in the area. Some of the chert specimens provided
by Wyckoff to the writer are illustrated in Figure 5.20.
James Briscoe (Butler, Oklahoma) has informed me
that he has obtained high quality knappable cherts that
are fairly consistent with the descriptions of the
"Lowrance" materials reported by Wyckoff from the Oil
Creek-Joins Formation due north of Ardmore,
Oklahoma, in the southern edge of the mountains.

Corbin Ranch

Though these formations are consistently described in
geological literature as containing chert, like other
formations in the area, the details are poorly known. The
writer has not collected cherts from the Oil Creek and
Joins formations. During excavations at the protohistoric
Lowrance site, Wyckoff (1973) collected chert specimens
from exposures along Buckhorn Creek in the eastern
edge of the Arbuckles that are probably Oil Creek- Joins
rocks. They were the principal source of raw material for
tools found in the site. The chert was referred to as
Lowrance chert and described as
brown and gray nodules occurring in limestone
along Buckhorn Creek .... A cryptocrystalline
Â· flint, either predominantly brown (with gray
streaking) or gray (brown splotches) in color.
Blue-gray and maroon streaking is present
ocassionally. Amorphous white inclusions are
common. Brachiopods, vugs (some filled with
quartz), and minute shell fragments are rarely
evidenced. Has a dull luster and is translucent
only along narrow band around edges
(Wyckoff 1973:70).

107

The type locality for this formation at the top of the
Simpson Group was originally described for the Corbin
Ranch located three miles north of Pittstown, Oklahoma
(Harris 1957:95). At the time of the type description,
Harris (1957:98) mentioned that the Corbin Ranch
"ordinarily contains no chert...in contrast to the overlying
Viola". Howeve~, chert is reported in the formation by

Figmre 5.20. Che.rt from tlb.e Oil Creek and Joins
formations, eastern Arbuddes, Murray County,
Okfailbioma. Collected by Don Wyckoff.

Harris (1957:62) as being white and ten feet thick. W.J.
Ford (1954:10) described chert found stratigraphically
beneath(?) the Simpson Group as "a bed of ten feet of
white chert". This too has been interpreted as a reference
to the Corbin Ranch although distinctions between the
terms above or beneath make a considerable difference.

Viola
The Viola is of middle Ordovician age. Along with the
Sylvan Shale and Fernvale Limestone, it serves as the
division between the Simpson and Hunton Groups (Hart
1974).
The Viola Formation was named by Taff (1902) for
outcrops near the former town of Viola. Taff (1928:22)
divided the formation into three members. The lower and
middle members were described as containing occasional
bands and nodules of chert. As first mentioned above,
Harris (1957:98) contrasts the Viola and the underlying
Corbin Ranch Formation on the basis of the absence of
chert in the Corbin Ranch. He goes on to describe chert
in the Viola as "brownish to resinous smoky chert with
included brown flecks and short dark spicular? rods or
tubules, so characteristic of the Viola chert" (ibid.).
Chert observed in bluffs of the Viola outcrops south of
Pittstown, Oklahoma, by the writer is tightly embedded
and occurs as relatively small nodules of light gray to
whitish colors. A single flattened chert nodule of white
and concentrically banded chert was collected from the
Viola west of Pittstown, but no other details of the Viola
cherts are known by the writer.

Hunton
In discussion of the Hunton Group, Amsden (1960:20)
refers to chert as being
present in parts of the group and locally
abundant in some formations ... There is a
marked stratigraphic control to the distribution
of Hunton cherts; it is present in the Ideal
Quarry, Keel, and Cochrane members; absent
in the Clarita and Henryhouse; again present in
the Bois d'Arc (rarely in the Haragan), and the
Frisco formations.
Few details are available for chert in the formations
mentioned by Amsden. The details that are available are
as follows:
1. Chimney Hill Formation/Cochrane Member:
Chert in the Cochrane Member of the Chimney Hill
Formation occurs as "irregular nodules and slightly
elongate lenses. This is generally light in color but in a
few places almost black. .. [It is] common on the Lawrence
uplift, and in a belt extending south to old Hunton
townsite. Chert is also present in the exposures to the
south of Wapanucka" (Amsden 1960:45). The Cochrane
is a lateral equivalent of the Blackgum in the western
108

Ozarks. The Cochrane is discussed in detail by Amsden
(1960:44-51).
2. Bois d' Arc Formation/Cravatt Member:
The Cravatt Member of the Bois d' Arc is discussed by
Amsden (1960:105-114). The member is described as
being 15.24 m (50 ft) thick and containing nodules of
chert and beds of chert "2-8 inches [5-20 cm] thick" and
that are "brown weathering, partly tripolitic and partly
vitreous", and by Amsden (1960:105-106) as being
"everywhere present" in the basal zones of the formation
but "is highly variable above" that point. The Cravatt is a
lateral equivalent of the Pinetop in the Ouachita
Mountains, but the descriptions of chert in the two
separated units have not been subjected to any degree of
comparison.

Frisco
Basic information on the Frisco was discussed earlier
in the Ozark Mountain section of this report. The "Frisco
Quarries" (Evans 1958:33-36) have long been recognized
in Oklahoma archeology as a major prehistoric sQurce.
Amsden (1961:25) refers to chert in the Frisco Formation
in the Arbuckles as being "locally present mostly in the
form of small light colored vitreous nodules but with
some elongate bands up to one-foot thick". Cherts
collected from the vicinity of the Frisco quarries are
illustrated in Plate 13 of Appendix A.
From observations made during one of Don Wyckoff's
field classes from the University of Oklahoma in which I
participated, Frisco cobbles in the more easterly
exposures of the formation near Harden City, Oklahoma,
are found in soils overlying the bedrock itself. The
cobbles appear to result from weathering of the upper
Frisco and redeposition on, rather than in, the lower and
remaining portions of the formation. The rocks found in
the Frisco quarries are likewise found in soils overlying
the bedrock. Both Wyckoff (personal communication)
and I consider the "quarries" to be workshops rather than
quarry areas. This in no way detracts from the value of
the area as a natural resource for tool production.

Woodford
The Woodford Formation has been introduced
previously in the Ouachita Mountain section of this
report, but the type locality is in the Arbuckles. In
addition to the comments made earlier it should simply
be noted that in discussing outcrops in the eastern edge
of the Arbuckles, Amsden (1960:135-140) provides
considerable detail on the Woodford in general. In pages
141-151, Amsden also discusses the "Woodford? Brown
Carbonate" exposures concentrated in the eastern
Arbuckles along Oil Creek. The chert is described
(Amsden 1960:144) as being common in all exposures
and as a "vitreous type in nodules and lenses along with
some beds of almost solid chert up to a foot in thickness".

Wapanucka/Chickachoc
Like some of the other formations common to both the
Arbuckle and Ouachita Mountains, the basic
characteristics of these formations have been discussed
earlier. Both crop out in the eastern edge of the
Arbuckles, and it can be assumed with some reliability
that the lithologies are similar to the descriptions
provided in the Oua~hita Mountain section.

Non-Chert Rocks of Relevance
A source of diorite that has, to my knowledge, not been
previously discussed in archeological literature but that
warrants consideration at least, is located about 2 km
(1.25 mi) east of Troy, Oklahoma, adjacent to the western
edge of Ten Acre Rock, a mass of granite. Based on a
macroscopic examination of specimens collected by Tillie
Larrumbide, the diorite is d_ense, dark gray to black, and
porphyritic with phenocrysts of twinned plagioclase. The
rock weathers to an olive greenish gray. The outcrop is
very small, some few meters in exposure, and may or may
not have been known or used in prehistoric time. The fact
that the rock type does exist in the area should be taken
note of however. Over the years I have observed several
ground stone objects and at least one boatstone in the
Lewis Stiles collection from the Lake Eufaula vicinity that
may very well be of this material.

North Central Texas- South Central and
Southwest Oklahoma
Since Fenneman's (1931) work, refined details of
physiographic expression have been made in many of his
more broadly defined provinces. This is especially true in
the areas of Texas and Oklahoma east of the High Plains.
This area includes the Rolling Plains that lie between the
Llano Estacada and the western edge of the Eastern
Cross Timbers, west and south of the Wichita Mountains,
and north of the Edwards Plateau. The Wes tern Cross
Timbers is perhaps the most observable and distinctive
geographic region of the area. Like the Eastern Cross
Timbers, the Western Cross Timbers extend southward
into Texas from the Red River for a distance of some 240
km (150 miles), but unlike their eastern counterpart, the
timbered area expands rather than contracts along the
southernmost margin. Also unlike the eastern "Timbers",
although the Antlers Formation is the principal
formation of the Western Cross Timbers, the underlying
bedrock is produced from numerous formations rather
than a single one like the Woodbine. The easternmost
edge of the Western Cross Timbers is more distinct than
is the western edge because of the sharper delineation
between the Blackland Prairie/Lower Cretaceous
limestones on the east in comparison to the predominant

109

sandstone/shale rocks of Paleozoic age to the west. It is
appropriate here to mention specific geographic areas of
some extent not because of their chert producing
capabilities but because of their absence of such
resources. The Blackland and Grand Prairie areas of
Texas can be categorized as classic examples of
chert-free regions. There simply are no chert-bearing
rocks in these areas. The only available lithic resources,
and even these are sparse, are isolated and sporadic
localities of gravels such as the Uvalde. The eastward
flowing tributaries of the river basins that cross the
prairies may contain varying quantities of chert, but even
here the resources are of minimal quantity and quality.
The importance in drawing specific attention to this
phenomena is because the prehistoric folk in the
immediate vicinity of the blackland prairies were forced,
or so it seems, to utilize whatever was available. This in
turn reflects directly upon the remnants of material
culture left by any groups who lived in the areas.
In the Texas portion of this region there are seven
geologic units (Edwards, Elm Creek, Stockwether,
Winchell, Wynn, Bannon Bridge, and Chico) identified in
the various sheets of the Texas Geologic Atlas as
containing in situ cherts. The Edwards, however, is
restricted in area to relatively small exposures along the
northern edge of the Callahan Divide and is separated
from the Edwards Plateau by some 16 km (10 miles).
Perhaps even more importantly than the Edwards
Formation itself are the chert resources in and adjacent
to the Callahan Divide resulting from redeposition of
Edwards-derived large cobbles or even boulder sizes of
chert that erosion has produced in the headwaters of the
Brazos River and the Colorado. Also the landmark
nature of the Divide probably contributed to its status as
an important resource for prehistoric groups. In the
Southern Plains the Callahan Divide is probably second
only to the Alibates as a regionally significant source of
high quality chert. In fact, some of the most important
caches of chert bifaces farther to the north, east, and west
of the Callahan Divide for considerable distances may be
traceable to the area of the Divide (see Tunnell 1978). In
the report on the Clovis-aged quarry workshop at the
Y ell9w Hawk site, Mallouf succinctly discusses the
importance of the Callahan Divide area as a source of
chert. He (Mallouf 1989:82) states
... the Callahan Divide appears to rise from the
surrounding redbed plains like a massive
flat-topped fortress [some 250 m or 820 ft in
height and] ranging from east to west as far as
the eye can see. It is easy to imagine the
fascination this conspicuous landform must
have held for early human populations entering
the southern periphery of the Plains. Easy to
imagine as well was their delight, when in
scaling the steep divide escarpment, an

abundance of important resources was
encountered, including numerous water
sources, abundant game, protected campsites
and, perhaps most important, major untouched
deposits of some of the highest quality chert to
be found in the Southern Plains.
The chert at the Callahan Divide is relatively uniform
in comparison to chert across the Edwards Plateau. It
typically is of the highest quality light gray to dark bluish
gray as described by Mallouf (1989:84), but it also
includes "nodules, the largest of which are about 30 or 40
cm (11.8-15.7 in) in diameter, and all are coated with a
thick opaque cortex. Inner chert is often fme grained, has
excellent conchoidal flaking qualities, and ranges in
colors from pale gray and brown to medium gray and
brown, with various mottled shadings of these hues.
Marine microfossils are relatively common and
occasionally abundant in the Edwards chert" (Tunnell
1978:7). Between the Callahan Divide and the Clear Fork
of the Brazos River, residual chert is quite common and
was, in part, derived from Edwards outcrops (Figures
5.21 and 5.22).
. The. remaining chert-bearing units contain sparse,
discontmuous, and quite often tightly embedded lenses
and nodules of chert. The most significant discussion of
chert procurement and lithic technology reported to date
in the archeological literature for thisÂ· area is that by
Tunnell (1977, 1978).
Al?ng the southern edge of this boundary, as discussed
previously for the Edwards Plateau, Paleozoic-aged
formations contribute chert to the stream gravels in the
headwaters of the Llano, Concho, Colorado, and Brazos
rivers. It is probably from these gravel sources and those
similar to the Uvalde Gravel discussed later that most of
the local cherts represented in artifact form in this area
are derived. It is interesting that even the Paleozoic
deposits that contain some chert in the southern edge of
this ~ea .are void of cher.t to the north. (For example, see
descriptions of geological formations in the Wichita
Falls-Lawton sheet of the Texas Geologic Atlas 1986.)
In the Wes tern Cross Timbers specific sources of chert
are not known, and the raw materials represented in local
collections from the area seem to represent dominant
usage of raw materials located to the south, particularly
those types found in Uvalde Gravel-like deposits in the
vicinity of Lake Proctor. An interesting note about the
Proctor area gravels is that they contain almost inverse
ratios of chert to quartzite as reported by Menzer and
Slaughter (1971) for the gravels in Dallas County. That is,
the gravels in the Proctor area appear to contain mostly
chert rather than quartzite. Very fme grained quartzites
of a~ ~nknown origin occur in the Proctor area gravels in
addit10n to the Ogallala quartzite that is present in
relatively small percentages. The source of the cherts is
currently unknown.

110

Chico Ridge
One of the .few chert-bearing formations in this region,
one .that 1s very poorly known archeologically, is the
Chico Ridge Member of the Pennsylvanian-aged Graford
Formation. This particular formation warrants specific
recognition not because it produces high quality or even
abundant chert, but because it is the only formation in
this area that bears in situ chert. David Skiles (1973:35)
refers to chert in ~he formation as "replacement [and]
locally abundant m a few of the measured sections "
Skiles does not describe the chert in detail but based o~
limited samples that I have examined, it i~ fossiliferous
occ~r.s in various shades of gray and brown, commonl;
exhibits mottled banding, and is always opaque (Figure
?.23). It does ?1ot occur in very large individual pieces; it
is prone to bemg very vuggy with relatively large cavities
in some cases; it is tightly embedded in the limestone
host-rock; and good surface exposures that would have
been accessible to prehistoric users are rare if not
nonexistent. The Chico Ridge chert found as artifacts
appears to be related to use of chert gravels in the West
Fork of the Trinity River, and even here the use was very
localized.
A surprising reference by Gould (1921:72) most likely
was intended for the Chico Ridge area when he discussed
the Pennsylvanian-aged rocks of north central Texas as
one of three general regions on the Great Plains where
flint occurs in great quantities. On page 73 he refers to
chert in this area as being "quite abundant" and as "the
same type of limestone and flint concretions [that] occur
in the Flint Hills region in north central Oklahoma and
southern Kansas". Gould certainly knew chert and
chert-bearing formations. Therefore, it comes as a
surprise for someone of his experience to refer to this
area as one of three major chert areas in the Great
Plains! The Chico Ridge vicinity is the only area that
remotely matches his description, but the quantity,
quality, and description of his cherts bears little
resemblance to the Chico Ridge materials. Within the
past fifty years or so the Chico Ridge area has been
subjected to severe modification from commerical
quarries for road metal, riprap, and other sorts of
construction needs. It may well be that aboriginally and at
the time of Gould, Chico Ridge was a highly productive
chert source area. If this can be determined, then such a
situation is well worth noting for the sake of future
archeological interpretations.

Marklley Conglomerate
The highest concentration of workshop areas known to
the writer in this region are south of the Brazos River
near Graham, Texas. The materials utilized there seem
to be primarily cobbles found in the Markley Formation,
although some of the cobbles may well have been derived

definition and delineation of the new Bowie Group as
well as the Markley Formation and others, is much more
refined in that particular regard. The Sherman Sheet
simply indicates a grossly defined and undifferentiated
designation of "Permian Rocks Above The Graham
Formation". The most unusual aspect of the rock is
simply why anyone would attempt to knap such material.
It does not routinely exhibit physical characteristics of
rock types normally attributed to knappable stone. The
rock does not occur as a continuous outcrop, but more as
disassociated and thin veneers on higher knolls and
ridges of the area. Apparently the easternmost exposures
were more commonly utilized. Sporadic remnants of the
conglomerate crops out in such small localized areas that
they cannot be isolated on the area's geological maps.
The easternmost extension of the peculiar rock crops
out between the Big Creek-Pringle Creek tributaries of
the West Fork of the Trinity River. An interesting
observation is that in the subtle definable
"workshop/quarry areas" related to the conglomerate,
small amounts of debitage from much higher quality
cherts also occurs. Examinations with Wayne Fields and
John Williams, who possibly know the area better than
anyone else, have resulted in the determination that the

from Brazos River gravels. The Harrell Site, from which
the Harrell arrowpoint type is named, is located some 6.4
km (4 mi) north of some of the more extensive workshops
in the area.
This chert appears to be from the same origin as the
tan, creme-colored, and light gray cherts found in the
Uvalde gravels located in the Eastern Cross Timbers. In
fact, this geographic area may well be the source for
many of the actual artifacts found in the Eastern Cross
Timbers.
Perhaps the study area's most distinctive quartzite
(Figure 5.24) occurs across the northern part of Jack
County, the southern part of Clay County, and into the
extreme western part of Wise County, Texas. The rock
may have similar lithologic counterparts in several of the
formations described in the various area sheets of the
Texas Geologic Atlas as "chert pebble conglomerates",
but the unit (called SS13 of the Markley Formation)
appears to be the principal formation utilized by
prehistoric inhabitants. It should be noted that the
geological mapping of this specific formation described
in the Wichita Falls-Lawton Sheet cannot be matched
with the adjoining Sherman Sheet near the Wise-Jack
county line. The Sherman Sheet was published 20 years
earlier, and the geological mapping, which includes the
112

flakes of better quality materials were derived from small
but common pebbles of multicolored cherts coming out
of the conglomerate itself. Bipolar flaking would seem to
have been a requirement for use of the pebbles. In an
otherwise lithic-sterile environment, the conglomerate
quartzite seems to have satisfied cultural needs to some
extent. It is also interesting that isolated surface finds in
the vicinities of the outcrops range from Clovis to late
prehistoric times. Although no definite Paleoindian
artifacts have been found made of the material itself, a
single Clovis point (Figure 5.25) found by Fern Rater (the
writer's mother-in-law) in the late 1920s was in the same
area of a Markley outcrop near Prospect, Texas, where
tested cobbles of chert and petrified wood occur. The
area where the Clovis point was found has not yielded any
other evidence of specifically definable Paleoindian
activity. It appears to be possible that some of the
artifacts currently being found in excavations of the
Clovis site below Ray Roberts Dam by Reid Perring may
be made from one of the finer-grained and better quality
varieties of the quartzite. The material is known to occur

as artifacts in late prehistoric components of sites at
Lewisville Lake.
Markley quartzite artifacts collected by Wayne Fields
vary considerably from one specimen to another but are
similar in that they represent a fine grained
chert-cemented sandy conglomerate (Figure 5.26). The

rock is deceptively fine grained. Subangular fragments
(up to 4 mm in diameter) of jasper in red, brown, yellow,
and black give the rock a coarse grained appearance, but
the silica cementation is complete enough and is so fine
that relatively good conchoidal fracture is produced.
Megaquartz cavity and vug filling is not uncommon in the
larger pieces. In general the overall color is a light
tannish white. The rock is opaque even on thin edges.
Pinkish tinges in the artifact fragments suggest some
modification by heat treatment. Preforms, contracting
stemmed dart points, and Fresno-like arrowpoints made
of the material have been found in the vicinity of the
outcrops. At sites in the vicinity of Pringle Creek,
significant quantities of Huffaker type arrowpoints have
been found by local collectors. Debitage from this
denser variety of the rock is especially common in local

cryptocrystalline material which has a good
conchoidal fracture and a color range that
includes gray, black, white, red, tan, and brown.
This latter material typically has inclusions of
sponge spicules, minute shell fragments, and

translucency but dark colored variants do not.
The luster is typically dull.

The Antlers Formation is not regarded as a
chert-bearing formation, but it does contain gravels that
range upward into large cobble sizes, a fair percentage of

This attempt to identify the chert and chert-bearing
formations within portions of an eight state study area has
been very educational for the writer. In spite of having
spent several years in chert research over much of this
area, I had a very limited perspective of just how complex
and poorly known the chert sources actually are. The
research potential of chert studies is great. The
identification of chert-bearing formations is merely a
step, but a necessary one, in the right direction. Lithic
source determination, specialized use of select materials
in lithic technology, relationships of specific culture
groups or adaptation types to discrete raw materials, and
the influence and role of raw materials in economics of all
cultural groups are only a few of the needed lines of
inquiry in lithic studies that immediately come to mind.
Chert quarries and workshop sites have been ignored in
past research possibly because of the inability to assign
specific time periods or cultural contemporaneity to such
site types. George Featherstonhaugh's 1834 observations
concerning the lack of diagnostic artifacts. (arrowheads)
at such sites still holds true today. Trace element analysis,
including techniques such as neutron activation,
proton-induced x-ray emission (PIXE), and x-ray
fluorescence, has the potential of isolating discrete
sources of cherts to small areas, but the effectiveness of
these techniques has yet to be fully realized. Here, too,
the field is relatively unexplored. The inability to obtain
more conclusive results on chert source determinations
with trace elements can possibly be attributed to
inadequate sampling, but as discussed above in the
Smoky Hill section, there are also problems in
determining the range and variability in trace elements of
any single chert formation unlike the more uniform
consistency of volcanic rocks such as obsidian and
rhyodacite. For some chert formations of widespread
areal extent, such as the Keokuk and Edwards, it may be
impossible to obtain a sufficient data base for pinpointing
a source of any specific variety. The viability of trace
element analysis as an analytical tool in this regard has
yet to be tested before more conclusive statements can be
made. At present, the most cost-effective method of chert
identifications is comparative analysis. However,
comparative collections from most of the chert sources
included in this report are unavailable to most
researchers.

Thermoluminescent dating offers a promising but still
experimental research method for dating
quarry/workshop sites (as discussed in the Lithic Site
Types section of this report). Sites containing potential
(or actual) burned or heat-treated cherts should become
a focus of attention for developing research designs that
incorporate the use of thermoluminescent dating.
As indicated in the title of this paper, the sources of
lithic materials in the study area truly do vary in origin
from mountain sources to the stomachs of alligators.
There are more than 119 individual geologically definable
units within the study area that produce chert suitable for
stone tool production, but the quality, quantity, and
variability of chert "species" within most of those
individual formations are still unknown. In situ cherts
derived from the formations and transformed through
chemical and mechanical weathering into the resulting
gravels strewn across various parts of the landscape, in
gravel bars, and terrace deposits further complicate
abilities to accurately identify the origin of many cherts
common in use for the greater part of human history. A
working knowledge of the sources of lithic materials used
for chipped stone tools across this extensive study area
represents one of the greatest weaknesses in ancillary
studies needed to support and further the goals of
archeological research. As mentioned repeatedly in the
above text, with few exceptions, chert sources are well
known for very few areas and even then by a limited
number of specialists within those areas.
In addition to the necessity for basic and uniform
application of standards in classification of chert, a few
specific problems of a regional nature need to be
resolved. Cherts in the Edwards Group, adjacent
Permian Formation, (i.e., Elm Creek cherts),
Nova-cherts in the Johns Valley Shale, some of the Flint
Hills cherts, and possibly the gray Mississipian cherts in
the upper Rio Grande need to be distinguished from
each other through analytical examination. The Kay
County variety of Florence chert in the Flint Hills and
Fingerprint chert in the Zuni and Sacramento mountains
need to be analyzed for more accurate discrimination
from each other. Refined methods for discriminating
between areas of considerable variability within
individual formations such as the Keokuk, Edwards,
Tecovas, Florence, and Dakota need to be obtained.

Better methods for identifying respective sources of
gravels such as the Uvalde, Citronelle, Seymour, and
Amite deposits need to be developed. Although a
substantial data base for lithic materials has been
developed for chert sources in the study area, as quoted
from Sieveking and Hart in the introduction, we still are
"seeing research in an early stage of evolution.". This
report, in combination with the high-tech analyses (i.e.,

116

scanning electron microscopy, remote sensing, trace
element analyses such as PIXE (Johansson, et al. 1972),
neutron activation and x-ray fluorescence, UVLH, and
thermoluminescent dating) now available for application
to chert studies, presents a reference and data base
framework that will further future understanding of the
prehistoric residents and their adaptations to the varied
envirnoment..

This appendix is intended to provide a means of
identifying selective chert types in archeological sites in
lieu of accessibility to cennparative collections. The
sources represented are singled out on the basis of their
relationship to known quarrying activities and to their
known geographic distribution. While reasonable
identifications of raw materials can be madeÂ·from black
and white photographs, such as those illustrated in the
main text, coloration is important for distinguishing
between certain chert types. The ability to distinguish
between some individual chert specimens may indeed
require the use of highly sophisticated and expensive.
analytical techniques, but four simple elements of
classification suffice for the most practical and quite
accurate macroscopic descriptions used in
identifications. These include color, diaphaneity, texture/
structure, and luster. Since other physical properties (i.e.,
hardness, streak , etc.) commonly used in visual rock
identifications are essentially identical for all cherts,
these four categories are of utmost importance. Of these
four, the coloration is probably most critical because it
represents the greatest variability. The patterned
arrangement of the colors is also of vital importance.
Therefore, even when colors of any given chert are
defined and indexea to the Munsell Book of Color, a
mental image is difficult if not impossible to obtain for
cherts unfamiliar to the researcher. The need for use of
true-color photographs in chert identification is second
only to comparative collections, and in their absence is
the best available method of macroscopic identifications.
Even in combination with the descriptions and black
and white photographs of chert in the main text, the
specimens discussed here are not purported to include all
varieties of chert for any one of the subject formations.
They do, however, include most of the more widely
recognized varieties.
All cherts are predominantly silica; all cherts are
aphanic in texture (whether actual grain size is micro or
cryptocrystalline can only be quantified by petrographic
analysis); all cherts have some degree of conchoidal
fracture; and all cherts are basically of the same hardness
(6 on Mob's scale). While technical differences may
occur in trace elements, basic petrography, and
paleontologically, these physical properties are
117

essentially identical from one chert to another.
Distinctions, then, as observed megascopically, between
the various chert types such as chalcedony, flint, agate,
jasper, etc., for speciation within a formational type
largely focus on differences in color or configuration of
patterns of coloration.
The color designations used here are based on dry
specimens in natural light and are indexed to a
combination of the Rock (RCC) and Soil Color Charts
(SCC) both of which are derived from the Munsell Book
of Color. Neither of the two charts contain all the chips
needed to most accurately identify the colors represented
in rocks. This is especially true for the more colorful
types such as the Alibates and Tecovas cherts. A copy of
the complete Munsell Book of Color that provides
greater refinement in color distinctions was unavailable
at the time of this preparation. In some few instances the
colors could not be matched as precisely as desired. In
such cases, the references are simply made to the nearest
match possible with the available chips. To those
unfamiliar with the color charts, it should be noted that
the narrative descriptions of colors may not necessarily
be the same between the Rock Color chart and the Soil
Color chart.
The use of textural terminology (i.e., aphanic, micro
and cryptocrystalline, fine, medium and coarse, etc.) may
be argumentably inaccurate in some cases because of the
lack of actual petrographic analysis. The terms as used,
however, are based on familiarity with the type cherts and
from analogies to similar type materials used in such
studies as Bowers 1975, Sholes 1978, and Banks 1983.
Once a chert type has been examined and grain size
determined, reasonable visual comparisons to the same
basic types can be made. It is also possible to make
realistic assumptions solely on the basis of familiarity with
cherts in general. For example, dense chalcedonies are
obviously going to be micro or cryptocrystalline, but the
exact petrographic measurements of grain size may vary
somewhat even at that level. Conversely, other cherts,
such as some novaculites, are obviously coarser grained
with a gritty appearance, and differences in grain size can
be recognized visually, especially with the aid of a hand
lens.

The illustrated specimens were collected by the writer
unless noted otherwise, and all specimens are from the
Banks collection.

Plate 1, Ozark Mountain Cherts

Luster: Dull.
Provenance: Along Spavinaw Creek, western Benton
County, Arkansas (Dickson Locality BE174).
General Comment: Collected by Don Dickson.

Keokuk Formation (Plate 1, D)

Specimens of the Gasconade, Roubidoux and
Jefferson City cherts were unavailable for inclusion here.
Comparative types for those formations are obtainable
from Don Dickson, Decatur, Arkansas, and probably
from Jack Ray, Southwest Missouri State University.
Specimens of the green chert, probably related to the St.
Joe Formation, are also not included because specimens
from actual outcrops were unavailable.

Reeds Spring Formation (Plate 1, A)
Color: Mottled light bluish gray (SB 7/1), medium light
gray (N6), weathered to pale yellowish brown (lOYR
6/2), grayish orange (lOYR 7/4), and grayish orange pink
(SYR 7/2). Limestone matrix is very light gray (N8) to
pinkish gray (SYR 8/1).
Diaphaneity: Opaque.
Texture/structure: Aphanic. The chert tends to be
highly fractured although fracture-free specimens of
much larger sizes are not uncommon.
Luster: Dull.
Provenance: outcrop in south edge of Seneca,
Missouri.
General comment: The mottled coloration could easily
cause confusion in identification because of similarities to
certain Keokuk types.

Keokuk Formation (Plate 1, B)
Color: Basic rock is relatively uniform medium light
gray (N6) to medium gray (NS). Subtle sporadic
splotches of medium dark gray (N4), and some thin
banding of light bluish gray (SB 7/1) at top of specimen.
Staining along fractures is light brown (SY 5/6) to darker
brown (2.SYR 4/6).
Diaphaneity: Opaque.
Texture/structure: Aphanic; smooth and even
conchoidal fracture.
Luster: Dull.
Provenance: Western Benton County, Arkansas, along
Spavinaw Creek (Dickson's Locality BE 174).
General comment: Collected by Don Dickson.

Keokuk Formation (Plate 1, C)
Color: Similar to Figure B, but grades into bands of
light brownish gray (lOYR 6/1to6/2).
Diaphaneity: Opaque.
Texture/structure: Aphanic. Displays banding in
contrast to Figure B. Smooth conchoidal fracture.

118

Color: Medium dark gray (N4). Splotches occur as
darker gray (N3) and within splotches coloration varies
from light gray (N7) to dark gray (N3).
Diaphaneity: Opaque.
Texture/structure: Aphanic.
Luster: Dull.
Provenance: Middle section of Dickson Bluff, Decatur,
Arkansas.
General comments: An almost complete range of
Keokuk types occur at this one locality.

Tahlequah Member of Moorefield Formation
(Plate 1, E)
Color: White (N9) to very light gray (N8). Minor
splotches of light olive gray (SY 6/1). Weathers to a light
yellowish gray. Spherulitic strings of fossil bryozoans(?)
occur as medium gray dots.
Diaphaneity: Opaque.
Texture/structure: Megaquartz occurs as vug filling on
opposite side. Well healed quartz-filled fractures. Illusion
of chalky and grainy texture, but basically aphanic to
microcrystalline.
Luster: Dull.
Provenance: Peoria quarries vicinity, Peoria,
Oklahoma.
General comments: Other Tahlequah varieties exhibit
slightly more mottling than this particular specimen
which is often highlighted with heat-treatment.

Keokuk Formation (Plate 1, F, G, and H)
Color: Basic matrix varies from white (N9) through
light gray (N7) to dark gray (N4). The splotches,
mottling, and fossil anthozoans occur in darker colors of
gray to black.
Diaphaneity: Opaque.
Texture/structure: Aphanic. Rock is highly fractured in
the outcrop. Fracture in individual specimens varies from
conchoidal to slightly uneven.
Luster: Dull.
Provenance: 1 km east of Kansas, Oklahoma.
General comment: These three specimens are
included as a group because of their same provenance
and basic physical properties. The only distinctions from
one rock to another are in the patterns of mottling. (Plate
1, G) is a classic example of the traditionally accepted
"Boone chert" in archeology.

Keokuk Frnrmation (Plate 1, I)
Color: Light gray (N7) matrix. The white (N9) and
dark gray (N3) inclusions are more uniformly dispersed
in parallel alignment than in previously described
specimens of Keokuk chert.
Diaphaneity: Opaque.
Texture/structure: Aphanic with conchoidal fracture.
Luster: Dull.
Provenance: Roadcut 2 km northeast of Salina,
Oklahoma.
General comment: None.

Provenance: Christman quarries, Noel, Missouri.
General comment: Other cherts at the same locality
vary slightly in color and infrequently may exhibit some
darker gray splotching reminiscent of Keokuk types.
Dickson (personal communication, 22 Sept. 1989)
informed me that he has found cherts in Keokuk rocks
near Noel, Missouri, that also contain the "eyes" that have
generally been considered distinctive to the
Penters/Sallisaw types. Consequently, the sporadically
placed "eyes" may not be an absolute, distinctive
characteristic of the Penters/Sallisaw cherts.

Color: Basic matrix of two slightly different shades of
gray. The darker (lower) portion is light gray (lOYR 6/1),
and the lighter shade (upper portion) is light gray (N7).
The darker colored splotches or "eyes" are brownish gray
(5YR 6/1) surrounded by thin edges of a very light gray
(N8). Weathers to a uniformly colored light yellowish
gray (SY 7/1).
Diaphaneity: Opaque
Texture/structure: Dense and aphanic. Hairline
fractures are well-healed with white quartz filling. Very
slight splotching of slightly darker color of basic matrix

smoother when axis of flake is transverse to the banding.
Bands vary in width from 0.1 mm to 1 cm.
Luster: Dull.
Provenance: 2 km southwest of Topsy, Oklahoma, at
upper end of Lake Spavinaw.
General comment: At this same locality, considerable
variety occurs in the Cotter cherts.

Cotter Dolomite Formation (Plate 2, D)
Color: Varies from band to band and slight differences
occur within a single band. The colors are white (N9),
pale blue (5PB 7/2) to dusky blue (5PB 3/2). A 7 mm
thick cortex on bottom edge is brownish gray (5YR 4/1).
Diaphaneity: Opaque.
Texture/structure: Aphanic texture. Tough, but has
good conchoidal fracture.

Color: Indistinctly mottled blue (pale blue, 5PB 7/2),
grayish blue (5PB 5/2) and dusky blue (5PB 3/2).
Outermost (weathered?) edge of the rock is a pale red
purple (5RP 6/2). Coloration is virtually indistinguishable
from St. Joe (Plate 2, A).

large, but very tightly embedded nodules of the type
illustrated here.

Bayou Manard Formation (Plate 2, J)
Color: Olive black (SY 2/1).
Diaphaneity: Opaque.
Texture/structure: Aphanic. Excellent conchoidal
fracture when uninterrupted by incipient fractures.
Numerous crinoid and possibly other fossil fragments.
The silicified fossils do not seem to affect fracture.
Luster: Waxy.
Provenance: Same locality as Boyau Manard Member
(above).
General Comment: None.

Pitkin Formation (Plate 2, K)
Color: Dark gray (N2) to black (Nl). Fossil spiculitic
fragments are light bluish gray (SB 7/1) to white (N9).

Luster: Very slight luster.
Provenance: Payne Hollow, about 2S km southwest of
Fayetteville, Arkansas.
General Comment: Collected by Don Dickson.

Color: Basic rock is yellowish brown (lOYR 6/2).
Subtle mottling grades into grayish orange pink (SYR
7/2) and grayish orange (lOYR 7/4). Weathers to creme
colored very pale orange (lOYR 8/2).
Diaphaneity: Opaque.
Texture/structure: Aphanic, good conchoidal fracture.
Luster: Dull.
Provenance: Southwest of the intersection of State
Highways 90 and 94 in McDonald County, Missouri.
General Comment: Collected by Don Dickson.
Though this specific chert is characteristic of a localized
area, the exact formation has yet to be identified.
According to Dickson it may be weathered Keokuk which
does crop out elsewhere in the vicinity, but it also is quite
comparable to the description of Elsey by Robertson
(1967: 14). It is included here because of its distinction
from other chert types in the area.

Color: Medium dark gray (N3) to dark gray (N2),
weathers to grayish orange (lOYR 7/4) and pale yellowish
brown (lOYR 6/2).
Diaphaneity: Opaque.
Texture/structure: Smooth to conchoidal fracture.
Aphanic to very fme grained and weathers to a medium
grained almost friable sandstone-like material.
Luster: Dull to very slight luster. Reflected light from
silica grains emits an illusion of luster.
Provenance: Same locality as Pitkin Formation
specimen described above.
General Comment: Collected by Don Dickson.
According to Dickson, this locality contains a wide range
of variation in the Pitkin cherts.

Bayou Manard Member of
Moorefield Formation (Plate 2, I)

Plate 3, Ouachita Mountains Novaculite

Color: Uniformly black (Nl).
Diaphaneity: Opaque.
Texture/structure: Aphanic. Conchoidal fracture,
surface tends to waviness. Sparse fragments of white
fossil crinoids.
Luster: Slightly vitreous.

Pitkin Formation (Plate 2, L)

Arkansas N ovaculite Formation (Plate 3, A)
Color: Grayish white (SY 8/1), medium yellowish gray
(SY S/1) with darker splotching to dark gray (N3).
Staining along fractures is grayish red (2.SYR 3/2).
Diaphaneity: Opaque.
Texture/structure: Very fine grained to aphanic.
Smooth to uneven conchoidal fracture.
Luster: Dull.
Provenance: Bluff of Arkansas Novaculite, west side
of Cossatot River about 18 km east of Hatton, Arkansas. -

General Comment: Though most novaculites are
almost too tough for the most effective conversion to
finer bifacially flaked tools prior to heat-treatment, this
rock is especially tough.

Arkansas Novaculite Formation (Plate 3, B)
Color: Uniformly colored medium light gray (7.5YR
6/1).
Diaphaneity: Basically opaque, slightly translucent on
thin edges.
Texture/structure: Aphanic. Has smooth even fracture.
Luster: Dull.
Provenance: Spanish Mountain, about 24 km northwest
of Hot Springs, Arkansas.
General comment: Collected by Don Dickson.

Arkansas Novaculite Formation (Plate 3, C)
Color: Grayish yellow-green (SGY 7/2), dusky yellow
green (SGY S/2) to pale red (SR 6/2) and dark reddish
brown (lOR 3/4).
Diaphaneity: Generally opaque, but small flakes may
be translucent.
Texture/structure: Exhibits horizontal banding or
bedding planes. Aphanic to very fme grained. Fracture
varies from brittle and uneven to conchoidal.
Luster: Dull in lighter colors, slightly vitreous in darker
green shades.
Provenance: Black Knob Ridge, 2 km east of Atoka,
Oklahoma.
General comment: Except for very small tools, the in
situ rocks at Black Knob Ridge cannot be taken seriously
as a resource for stone tool production because of their
highly fractured and brittle characteristics. Cherts
derived from the area and found as gravels in the Boggy
River drainages, however, may be of better knappable
quality.

Texture/structure: Aphanic. Quartz-filled hairline
fractures which do not seem to affect flaking. Smooth to
conchoidal fracture.
Luster: Dull.
Provenance: Spanish Mountain, same general locality
as Plate 3, D above.
General comment: Collected by Don Dickson.

Arkansas N ovaculite Formation (Plate 3, F)
Color: Dark gray (2.SYR 4/0) to very dark gray (2.5YR
3/0). Weathers to grayish orange (lOYR 7/4). Weathered
rind (1 cm thick) is very light gray (NS).
Diaphaneity: Opaque.
Texture/structure: Highly fractured. Varies from
aphanic to grainy limestone-like texture in weathered
portions. Minutely developed veins of iron pyrite occur
along bedding planes and contact zones of weathering.
Fracture is conchoidal.
Luster: Generally dull, but is slightly more vitreous on
fresh surfaces.
Provenance: Black Knob Ridge, Atoka, Oklahoma.
General comment: This rock is identical to types
defmed as Nova-chert in the J oh1is Valley Shale, but is
more highly fractured and brittle.

Arkansas N ovaculite Formation (Plate 3, G)
Color: Pink (lOR 6/3). Quartz-filled fractures of light
grayish pink (SYR 8/2).
Diaphaneity: Opaque with slight degree of
translucency on thin edges.
Texture/structure: Aphanic and lacks the typically
gritty appearance of most novaculite. Smooth conchoidal
fracture.
Luster: Dull.
Provenance: Indian Mountain, about 2S km northwest
of Hot Springs, Arkansas.
General comment: Collected by Don Dickson.

Arkansas Novaculite Formation (Plate 3, D)
Color: Dark gray (N3), very light gray (N7) to white
(N9). Slight orange staining.
Diaphaneity: Opaque even on thin edges.
Texture/structure: Aphanic texture, but also gives an
impression of being gritty. Smooth to conchoidal
fracture.
Luster: Dull.
Provenance: Spanish Mountain, about 24 km northwest
of Hot Springs, Arkansas.
General comment: Collected by Don Dickson.

Arkansas N ovaculite Formation (Plate 3, H)
Color: Mottled colors of very pale red purple (SP 7/2),
grayish red purple (SRP 4/2), dark reddish brown (lOR
3/4) and bluish white (SB 9/1).
Diaphaneity: Opaque except on very thin of right side.
Texture/structure: Aphanic. Relatively good
conchoidal fracture under natural conditions.
Luster: Dull.
Provenance: Indian Mountain, same general locality as
preceding example.
General comment: None.

Arkansas Novaculite Formation (Plate 3, E)
Arkansas N ovaculite Formation (Plate 3, I)

Color: Dark reddish brown (lOR 3/4) to moderate red
(SR 4/6) with light bluish gray (SB 7/1) mottling.
Diaphaneity: Opaque.

Color: Snow white, more intense white than shown on
(N9,RCC).

121

Diaphaneity: Opaque even on thin edges.
Texture/structure: Aphanic texture, excellent
conchoidal fracture.
Luster: Dull.
Provenance: DeSoto Park vicinity, 2S km northwest of
Hot Springs, Arkansas. Considering the "purity" of this
particular rock, its opaqueness is almost surprising. This
variety is quite similar to the Caballos Novaculite from
the Big Bend area of Texas, except the Caballos tends to
exhibit a denser and more porcellaneous appearance.
General comment: Collected by Don Dickson.

Arkansas N ovacuHte Fo:rmation (Plate 3, J)
Color: Pale red (lOR 6/2), grayish orange pink (SYR
7/2), and pale grayish pink (SYR 8/2). Moderate brown
staining along healed fractures.
Diaphaneity: Opaque.
Texture/structure: Exhibits slight banding, aphanic
texture.
Luster: Dull.
Provenance: 13 Mile Mountain, northwest of Hot
Springs, Arkansas.
General comment: Collected by Don Dickson.

Arkansas NovaculHe Fo:rmation (Plate 3, K)
Color: Dark gray (N3). On thin edges becomes lighter
in color to medium gray (NS). Hairline fractures are lined
in black (Ni).
Diaphaneity: Opaque.
Texture/structure: Healed hairline fractures do not
affect flaking quality. Matrix is aphanic and has smooth
conchoidal fracture.
Luster: Dull. In bright sunlight it glistens from silica
grains.
Provenance: Harwood Quarry (commercial) west of
Hot Springs, Arkansas.
General comment: Collected by Don Dickson. While
Spanish Mountain contains examples of dark gray to
black novaculite along with its other multiple varieties,
this locality is predominantly of this darker gray to black
rock. According to both Jim Spears and Don Dickson,
this particular variety does not require heat- treatment in
contrast to most other novaculite prior to conversion to
tool forms. In fact, they state that heat- treatment tends
to inhibit rather than enhance its quality of knappability.
I have not personally knapped any appreciable quantity
of the materials from the Hot Springs outcrops.

Arkansas Novaculite Fo:rmation (Plate 3, L)
Color: Moderate reddish brown (10R 4/6) to bluish
white (SB 9/1).
Diaphaneity: Opaque.

Texture/structure: Aphanic texture, smooth
conchoidal fracture.
Luster: Dull.
Provenance: 13 Mile Mountain, west of Hot Springs,
Arkansas.
General comment: None.

Plate 4, Ouachita Mountains Cherts
Johns Valley Shale Formation (Plate 4, A)
Color: Medium dark gray (N4) with splotches of light
olive gray (SY 6/1). Weathers to a mottled dark yellowish
brown (10YR 4/2) and moderate yellowish brown (10YR
S/4).
Diaphaneity: Opaque.
Texture/structure: Dense cryptocrystalline texture.
Excellent conchoidal fracture.
Luster: Slightly vitreous.
Provenance: Western Ti Valley, Locality No. 4 (Banks
1983: 349-3S1).
General comment: In the 1983 reference, six different
localities of Johns Valley outcrops are discussed, and
nine specific chert types are described from this Locality
No. 4. Though minor differences in chert types at the
separate localities occur, the chert types are quite
consistent. In this appendix most of the specimens from
the Johns Valley Shale are from the same outcrop, but
similar if not identical cherts are typical of most western
Ouachita outcrops of the Johns Valley.

Johns Valley Shale Fo:rmation (Plate 4, B)
Color: Bands alternating in colors of dusky brown
(SYR 2/2), moderate brown SYR 3/4, dusky yellowish
brown (10YR 2/2) to light olive gray (SY 6/1). Weathers
to medium (NS) and medium dark gray (N4), light
brownish gray (SYR 6/1) to grayish red purple (5RP 4/2).
Diaphaneity: Opaque.
Texture/structure: Cryptocrystalline. Excellent
conchoidal fracture.
Luster: slightly vitreous.
Provenance: Same as example described above.
General comment: None.

Johns Valley Shale Fo:rmation (Plate 4, C)
Color: Medium gray (2.5YR S/0 to 6/0) mottled in
shades of darker gray (2.SYR 4/0) and light bluish gray
(SB 7/1). Weathers to light (SYR S/6) to moderate brown
(SYRS/6).
Diaphaneity: Opaque.
Texture/structure: Cryptocrystalline.
Luster: Dull to slightly vitreous.
Provenance: 6.4 km west of Ti, Oklahoma.
General comment: None.

Wapanucka Formation (Plate 4, D)

Pinetop Chert Formation (Plate 4, G)

Color: Light bluish gray (SB 7/1) to medium light gray
(N6) with disseminated splotches of dark gray (N3).
Diaphaneity: Opaque.
Texture/structure: Aphanic matrix with very fine
grained spiculitic inclusions. Smooth, even, but slightly
brittle fracture.
Luster: Dull.
Provenance: 2.4 km southwest of Pittsburg, Oklahoma.
General comment: This is the same specimen used for
comparison to the Keokuk in the main text (Figure 1.32).

Color: Light bluish gray (SB 7/1) to medium bluish gray
(SB S/1) with white (N9) splotches. Weathers to yellowish
gray (SY 7/2) and pale yellowish brown (10YR 6/2).
Diaphaneity: Opaque
Texture/structure: Dense, cryptocrystalline.
Luster: Generally dull.
Provenance: Pinetop locality, Ti Valley, Oklahoma.
Same as Banks 1983: 339-341.
General comment: Though the Pinetop is more varied
than is represented in this single specimen, this is perhaps
the more "classic" Pinetop variety.

Â· Woodford Example From
Johns Valley Shale Formation (Plate 4, E)
Color: Black (Nl). Weathers to light gray (N7) and
light olive gray (SY 6/1).
Diaphaneity: Opaque.
Texture/structure: Aphanic texture. Excellent
conchoidal fracture. Thin banding is subtle on fresh
breaks, but is much more noticeable on weathered
surfaces. Iron pyrite occurs along contact between
weathered and unaltered matrix and to a lesser extent
parallel to the horizontal banding.
Luster: Dull to slightly vitreous.
Provenance: Western Ti Valley, Locality No. 4 (Banks
1983:349-3S1).
General comment: This rock is similar to "Nova-chert"
types in the Johns Valley. A distinction can be made,
however, in that this rock lacks the bluish gray tinges
observable in almost all Nova-cherts. Compare this
specimen with the same chert from the parent Woodford
Formation shown in Figure 1.29 of the main report. This
one differs only in having better conchoidal fracture and
slightly more luster.

Nova Chert (Arkansas N ovaculite) From
Johns Valley Shale Formation (Plate 4, F)
Color: Alternating bands medium light gray (N6), light
bluish gray (SB 7/1), and dark gray (N2). Weathers to
grayish orange (10YR 7/4), moderate yellowish brown
(10YR S/4) to dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/2).
Diaphaneity: Generally opaque, but lighter colors tend
to be more translucent on thin edges.
Texture/structure: Dense cryptocrystalline texture.
Excellent conchoidal Â·fracture. Prominent banding along
horizontal bedding planes.
Luster: Vitreous to waxy.
Provenance: Western Ti Valley, Locality No. 4 (Banks
1983:349-3S1).
General comment: This rock is beautiful and
esthetically pleasing in both fresh breaks and weathered
surfaces. More often than not artifacts will appear in the
brownish banded (weathered) shades.

Provenance: Leona State Park, Belton, Texas.
General comment: Collected by J.B. Sollberger,
Dallas, Texas. Though this chert flakes well under natural

conditions, Sollberger routinely heats it prior to knapping
because the treatment enhances the quality considerably.
Heat treatment also has a tendency to darken the gray
colors and produces a slightly waxy sheen. The natural
versus heat-treated specimens of the same rock could be
difficult to macroscopically identify as being from the
same source.

red SYR 6/1 to 7/1, and light gray to clear quartz filling.
Diaphaneity: Opaque in grayish orange pink area (left
side), slightly translucent beneath the crust covering the
pale reddish chalcedonic area (right side).
Texture/structure: Left side is dense and aphanitic
with excellent conchoidal fracture. Right side is crusted
on both obverse and reverse sides with scoria-like
impressions from the chert's origin as a cavity filling in
the scoria. Fracture is brittle and splintery on the right
side. Also, minutely folded agatization is present in
flaked surface at lower right. Radial quartz-filling occurs
in upper left of specimen. The entire surface of the
reverse side is sprinkled with open wheat-shaped vugs.
Luster: Dull on left side; slight luster in exposed
portions of right side. Weathered portions of the rock on
the reverse side exhibit slight luster in the orange pink
area.
Provenance: South peak above Washington Pass,

Comment: None.

Volcanic Vent (Plate 8, H)
Color: Pink (2.5YR S/8).
Diaphaneity:Â· Translucent.
Texture/structure: Has appearance of glass.
Luster: Vitreous.
Provenance: South peak above Washington Pass,
Chuska Mountains, New Mexico.
General comment: None.

Volcanic Vent (Plate 8, I)
Color: Multicolored banding in various shades or red
and gray, and weathered to grayish orange-yellow. The
flaked surface suggests mottling, but this results from
flakes cutting across the different indivudually-colored
bands. Colors vary from moderate red (SR 4/6) and (10R
4/6), pale reddish brown (SR S/4), pale red (10R 4/4) and
grayish pink (SR 8/2). In weathered portions of the rock
the colors are in shades or orangish gray (10R 8/2) and
grayish orange (lOYR 7/4). Although described as
orange gray in the sec, this shade has a yellowish tinge.
Diaphaneity: Generally opaque, slight translucence on
thin edges particularly in darker colors.
Texture/structure: Aphanitic texture. There is an
absence of vugs and fractures. In cross section on the
sides of the rock the individual bands are slightly arched,
giving an impression of having been concentrically
banded. The bands vary from less than 1 to 5.0 mm in
thickness. Flaking is conchoidal except along the
weathered edges where it tends to become splintery.
Contacts between some of the bands adversely affects the
direction of flakes. Reverse side exhibits scoria-like
texture resulting from original contact with its scoria host
rock.
Luster: Dull on fresh surfaces; has waxy to vitreous
luster on weathered surfaces resulting from desert
varnish.
Provenance: South peak above Washington Pass,
Chuska Mountains.
Comments: If artifacts made of this stone were flaked
transverse to the banding, and possibly even as illustrated
here, identification of the raw material as Chuska chert
would be difficult for most researchers.

Plate 11, Tecovas Chert and Quartzite
Variation in cherts and quartzites is greater in the 20
some different localities where prehistorically obtainable
rocks are known to occur in the Tecovas Formation. Lynn
(1986) lists and discusses 20 specific localities that occur
within a distance of 190 km extending southeastward
from a point southeast of Dumas to Matador, Texas.
Specimens illustrated here are derived from only three of
the same localities discussed by Lynn. Colored plates of
Tecovas materials in the Jones-Miller manuscript (Banks
n.d.) include cherts from the Quitaque localities that are
not shown here. Distinctions between the Quitaque and
Canadian River sources are slight, however.

(5RP 6/2), pale blue (SPB 7/2) and dark yelloWish orange
(10YR 6/6) flecks.
Diaphaneity: Semi-translucent in thinner pieces.
Texture/structure: Aphanic texture, excellent
conchoidal fracture.
Luster: Dull to slightly vitreous.
.
Provenance: Coetas Creek locality, Potter County,
Texas.
General comment: Probably best classified as
chalcedony, though not specifically confirmed by
petrographic analysis. Although this rock is relatively
large for individual pieces of Tecovas chert, it is also
highly fractured.

Tecovas Formation (Plate 11, D)
Color: Basic color is very pale bluish white-no exact
match to color chart. Weathered spots are very pale
orange (10YR 8/2), light brown (SYR 6/4), and red (SR
4/6). Circular spot in center is thin dusky red ring around
spot of pale red purple (SRP 4/2).
Diaphaneity: Translucent.
Texture/structure: Densely cryptocrystalline.
Luster: Slightly vitreous.
Provenance: Coetas Creek locality, Potter County,
Texas.
General comment: Rock is beautiful classic example of
chalcedony.

Tecovas Formation (Plate 11, E)
Color: Grayish reds and browns--no good matches,
dark red (10R 3/6), reddish gray (10YR 6/1), and light
brownish gray (10YR 6/2) inclusions occur. The outer
edges of the rock are light gray (10YR 7/1).
Diaphaneity: Opaque. Gives an illusion of being
translucent on thin edges.
Texture/structure: The light gray silica cement causes
an appearance of being a fine dense oolite, but such is not
the case.
Luster: Dull, but shiny from silica.
Provenance: Coetas Creek locality, Potter County,
Texas.
General comment: This is the quartzite expression of
this material.

Tecovas Formation (Plate 11, F)
Color: Light yellow (10YR 7/8), light gray (10YR 7/2),
moderate red (SR 4/6), moderate reddish brown (10R
4/6), pale red (10R 5/2), pale purple (SP 6/2).
Diaphaneity: Translucent on thin edges.
Texture/structure: Veins and mottling permeate the
rock, and quartz-filled vugs that are usually characteristic
are not present in this particular specimen.
Luster: Dull to slightly vitreous.
Provenance: Coetas Creek locality, Potter County,
Texas.
General comment: This specimen is a type considered
as classic Tecovas jasper.

Tecovas Formation (Plate 11, G)
Color: Red (10R 4/8), weak red (10R 5/4), grayish red
purple (5RP 4/2), and yellowish brown (10YR 6/8) with
dots of dark greenish gray (SGY 4/1) and white (10YR
8/2).
Diaphaneity: Opaque.
Texture/structure: Very fine grained; almost bordering
on being aphanic. In fact, chert inclusions occur as thin
bands.
Luster: Dull.

of the rock which is semitranslucent.
Texture/structure: Dense, aphanic.
Luster: Dull.
Provenance: 3.5 km south of Weymouth Ranch
headquarters, Moore County, Texas.
General comment: The lack of mottling is almost
atypical of multicolored Tecovas jasper.

Tecovas Formation (Plate 11, I)
Color: Pale red purple (5RP 4/2) splotched with red
(SR 6/2). Bottom of rock is light brownish gray (5YR 6/1).
Dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) on upper left edge.
Diaphaneity: Opaque.

General comment: None.

Tecovas Formation (Plate 11, J)
Color: Bluish white (SB 9/1), light gray (N7) to dark
reddish brown (10R 3/4) with moderate red (SR 4/6)
staining around edges.
Diaphaneity: Semi-translucent.
Texture/structure: Chalcedonic.
Luster: Dull.
Provenance: Coetas Creek locality, Potter County.
Texas.
General comment: None.

any further north than Piedmont, yet excellent exposures
of the Foraker occur at least as far north as Reece,
Kansas, where the specimen shown as Plate 12, J was
collected. It is difficult to indicate any appreciable detail
on a regional geologic map of the chert outcrops in the
Flint Hills because of the sinuous and narrow exposures
of the rock units themselves. Perhaps this is the reason
for the lack of detail on the Kansas map. It may not be
indicative that the formations simply do not exist in a
given area.

Tecovas Formation (Plate 11, K)

Florence Formation (Plate 12, A)

Color: Grayish red (SR 4/2), grayish red purple (SRP
4/2), pale purple (SP 6/2), pale red purple (SRP 6/2),

General comment: None.

Plate 12, Flint Hills Cherts
According to Fenneman (1938:614), the Flint Hills is
comprised only of Permian-aged rocks, and it is from the
Flint Hills proper that the following specimens are
illustrated. It should be noted, however, that the
Pennsylvanian formations for a distance of some 30 km to
the east and parallel to the axis of the Flint Hills contain
minor amounts of chert (Table S.1). Those sporadic
cherts (Ervine Creek, Curzon, and Plattsmouth)
occurring in the Shawnee group (Haury 1979: 214) are
poorly represented by type specimens and their
stratigraphic and geographic distributions are not well
known. Though of minor significance compared to those
discussed here, specimens of those cherts found in
archeological contexts would most likely be attributed to
some of the better known Flint Hills formations unless
the investigators are personally familiar with the
Pennsylvanian types.
Also, even in the Permian formations, the known
geographic distribution for the chert is in some cases
poorly lacking. For example, the Cottonwood member of
the Beattie is mapped on the State Geologic Map of
Kansas for only a short distance south of Piedmont
Kansas, yet the Cottonwood is distinctively recognized
from the state line southward into Oklahoma in the
Oklahoma Hydrologic Atlas 2. Also the Foraker is not
specifically indicated on the Kansas State Geologic Map
131

Cottonwood Formation (Plate 12, B)
Color: Pale yellowish orange (10YR 8/4 to 10YR 8/6).
Vivid red irregularly shaped dots occur sporadically.
Clasts (or ghosts) of fossil fragments are white (N9).
Weathers to a grayish yellow (10YR 8/2; RCC) called
white in Soil Color Chart.
Diaphaneity: Opaque.
Texture/structure: Excellent conchoidal fracture.
Fossil fragments do not affect flaking. Dendrites occur
along contact of weathered zones and around chalklike
vug fillings. The chalklike areas may represent
incomplete sificification of a limestone host rock.
Luster: Dull.
Provenance: S km (3.1 mi) northwest of Grainola,
Oklahoma.
General comment: None.

Neva Formation (Plate 12, C)
Color: Light olive gray (SY 6/1), light brownish gray
(SYR 6/1) to white (N9).

Diaphaneity: Opaque.
Texture/structure: Wavy, more or less horizontal bands
(bedding planes?) permeated with fossil clasts. Has
appearance of a biosparite. Small open vugs and very
thin linear cavities are quite common. Conchoidal
fracture, although the vugs and differentially replaced
fossils cause fracture to be uneven at times.
Luster: Dull.
Provenance: Oklahoma-Kansas State Line east side of
Kansas State Highway 1S.
General comment: Artifacts of this material should be
quite distinctive, but in comparison to the other chert

types available in the region, this material would be of
minor importance.

Florence Formation (Kay County Variety;
Plate 12, G)

Cresswell Member of the Winfield Formation
(Plate 12, D)

Color: Basic color is grayish pink (SR 8/2) and grayish
orange pink (SYR 7/2). The darker reds are pale red
(10R 6/4) to red (10R S/6). Fusilinids are white (N9), and
unidentified anthozoa are medium dark gray (NS).
Diaphaneity: Opaque.
Texture/structure: Dense, aphanic. Note thin but
obvious swirled banding in comparison to the next
specimen to be described.
Luster: Very slight satin sheen.
Provenance: 1 km west of Maple City, Kansas.
General comment: This specimen is a heat-treated
sample of same rock as the specimen described below.

Color: Snow white to white (N9). Weathers yellow
(10YR 8/6).
Diaphaneity: Opaque.

Provenance: Miller Springs southwest of Cedar Point,
Kansas.
General comment: None.

Florence Formation (Kay County Variety;
Plate 12, H)

Florence Formation (Kay County Variety;
Plate 12, E)
Color: Light gray (N7) to dark medium gray (N4) with
yellowish brown (10YR S/6) bands in matrix of light
yellowish gray (2.SYR 7/2). Fossil fusilinids are white
(N9).

light gray (N7). Fusilinids still occur as very light gray to
white.
Diaphaneity: Opaque.
Texture/structure: Same as specimen described
directly above.
Luster: Dull except for the reddish gray area which is
slightly vitreous.
Provenance: Same as specimen described directly
above.
General comment: This is a heat-treated piece of the
same Florence material that is described directly above.
The dull luster is surprising in that a common
characteristic of heat-treated chert is an increased luster.
The method of treatment may account for this
phenomenon; it was heated by Ron Cloud in a bucket
with a sand covering over the chert, and heat was
provided by charcoal briquets in a basic nonoxidizing
atmosphere. Differences in luster on quartzites heated in
open wood fires versus enclosed kilns have been
observed during my personal experiments on Ogallala
quartzites.

GLOSSARY
The terms used in this glossary are derived primarily from the Glossary of Geology (1974) published by the American
Geological Institute, Washington, D.C. and edited by Margaret Gary, Robert McAfee Jr., and Carol L. Wolf. In most
cases the definitions are abbreviated from those in the Glossary of Geology with the intent of being most directly related
to their usage in this particular report. Those terms identified from other sources will be so noted individually.

Adamantine
Said of a very hard mineral, the luster of which is brilliant,
e.g., diamond.

pure or nearly pure chemically cemented sandstone
containing less than 10% argillaceous matrix. Derived
from Latin arena (sand).

Agate
Translucent, cryptocrystalline variety of quartz or chert.
Variegated chalcedony frequently mixed or alternating
with opal, and characterized by colors arranged in
alternating stripes or bands, in irregular clouds, or in
moss-like forms. Occurs in all colors and commonly
occupies vugs in volcanic rocks and cavities in some other
rocks.

Arkose
Definition varies slightly from one petrographer to
another. Folk (1968: 124) defines it as a sandstone of less
than 75% quartz and metamorphic quartzite and more
than 25% feldspar and plutonic rock fragments (or whose
content of feldspar and plutonic rock fragments is at least
three times that of all other fine-grained rock fragments,
including chert), regardless of clay content or texture.

Amygdule
A gas cavity or vesicle in an igneous rock which is filled
with secondary minerals such as zeolite, calcite, quartz,
or chalcedony. Also used to refer to sedimentary gravel in
form of agate pebbles.

Basalt
(a) A dark- to medium-dark-colored, commonly
extrusive mafic igneous rock composed primarily of
calcic plagioclase and clinopyroxene in a glassy or
fme-grained ground mass.
(b) A term loosely used for dark-colored , fine-grained
igneous rock whether intrusive or extrusive.

Andesite
Name derived from Andes Mountains. Dark-colored,
fine-grained extrusive rock. When porphyritic contains
phenocrysts mostly of zoned acid plagioclase and one or
more of the mafic minerals such as biotite, hornblende,
and pyroxene. Ground mass is usually composed of same
minerals as the phenocrysts.
Aphanic
Texture of a carbonate sedimentary rock whose
individual crystals are indistinguishable to the unaided
eye. Grain size less than 0.01 and 0.005 mm. Related
aphanocrystalline refers to interlocking texture of a
carbonate rock with crystals with diameters less than
0.0039 mm (Folk 1974: 168).
Aphanitic
Same as aphanic but in refers to igneous rocks in which
crystalline components are indistinguisable.

Bauxite
An off-white, grayish, brown, yellow or reddish-brown
rock composed of a mixture of amorphous or crystalline
hydrous aluminum oxides and hydroxides and containing
impurities of free silica, silt, iron hydroxides, and
especially clay minerals. Principal source of aluminum.
Biosparite
A limestone with variable proportion of skeletal debris
and clear calcite. Specifically a limestone of less than
25% intraclasts and less than 25% coliths, with a volume
ratio of fossils and fossil fragments to pellets greater than
3 to 1, and the sparry-calcite cement more abundant than
the carbonate-mud matrix. The major organism should
be specified, if possible, when using the term: e.g.,
"trilobite biosparite" or "pelecypod biosparite".
Botryoidal
Having the form of a bunch of grapes. Said of mineral
deposits, e.g., hematite, having a surface of spherical
shapes; also said of crystal structure in which the
spherical shapes are of radiating crystals.

Arenite
(a) Consolidated sedimentary rock composed of
sand-sized fragments irrespective of composition: e.g.,
sandstone, graywacke, arkose, and calcarenite.
(b) A relatively "clean" sandstone, relatively well-sorted,
and contains little or no matrix material and has a
relatively simple mineralogic composition; specifically a

Boulder
See sediment sizes.
149

Brachiopod
Any solitary marine invertebrate of the phylum
Brachiopoda, characterized by a lophophore and by two
bilaterally symetrical valves that may be calcareous or
composed of chitinophosp.Q.ate and that are commonly
attached to a substratum, but may also be free.
Breccia
A coarse-grained dastic rock composed of large (greater
than sand sized, or 2 mm in diameter) angular and rock
fragments that are cemented together in a finer-grained
matrix (which may or may not be similar to the larger
fragments) and that can be of any composition, origin, or
mode of accumulation. Specific rock type should be
referenced when used: e.g., "limestone breccia" or "chert
breccia".
Carnelian
A translucent blood-red, flesh-red, reddish-white,
orange-red, reddish-yellow, or brownish-red variety Â·of
chalcedony, pale to deep in shade, containing iron
impurities.
Chalcedony
A cryptocrystalline variety of quartz (or chert). It is
commonly microscopically fibrous, may be translucent or
semi-transparent, and has a nearly wax-like luster, a
uniform tint, and a white, pale blue, gray, brown or black
color; it has a lower density and lower indices of
refraction than ordinary quartz. Chalcedony is often a
component of other cherts and frequently occurs as an
aqueous deposit filling or lining cavities in rocks.
Chert
A hard, extremely dense or compact, dull to
semi-vitreous, cryptocrystalline sedimentary rock,
consisting dominantly of cryptocrystalline silica with
lesser amounts of micro- or cryptocrystalline quartz and
amorphous silica (opal). It has a tough, splintery to
conchoidal fracture, and may occur in almost any color.
It occurs principally as nodular or concretionary
segregations in limestone or dolomite, and less commonly
as areally extensive layered deposits; it may be an original
organic or inorganic precipitate or a replacement
product. Robert L. Folk and Â·others consider all microand cryptocrystalline silica rocks to be varieties of chert
whose impurities, physical properties and petrographic
differences determine refined classifications such as flint,
jasper, chalcedony, agate, etc. Hence any of the micro- or
cryptocrystalline silica rocks can be classified as chert,
but only those meeting precisely defined criteria (Folk
1974:80-81) can be accurately distinguished as individual
varieties or "species".
Chertification
A type of silicification in which fine-grained quartz or
chalcedony is introduced into limestones or dolomites.

150

Clays tone
An indurated clay of the texture and composition, but
lacking the fme lamination, or fissility, of shale.
Cobble
See sediment sizes.
Conglomerate
A coarse-grained, elastic sedimentary rock composed of
rounded to subangular fragments larger than 2 mm in
diameter (granules, pebbles, cobbles and boulders) set in
a fme-grained matrix of sand, silt, or any of the common
natural cementing materials (such as calcium carbonate,
iron oxide~ silica, or hardened clay); the consolidated
equivalent of gravel both in size range and in the essential
roundness and sorting of its constituent particles. The
rock or mineral fragments may be of varied composition
and range widely in size, and are usually rounded and
smoothed from transportation by water or from wave
action. Conglomerates may be classified according to the
nature or composition of fragments, proportion of matrix,
degree of size sorting, type of cement, and agent or
environment responsible for their formation; i.e., chert
conglomerate.
Cryptocrystalline
(a) Said of the texture of a rock consisting of or having
crystals that are too small to be recognized and separately
distinguished even under the microscope (although
crystalline features may be shown by the use of the
electron microscope); indistinctly crystalline, as
evidenced by the confused aggregate effect under
polarized light. Also said of a rock having such a texture.
(b) Descriptive of a crystalline texture of a carbonate
sedimentary rock having discrete crystals whose
diameters are less than 0.001 mm. Some petrographers
use an upper limit of 0.004 mm.
Crystallite
A broad term applied to a minute body of unknown
mineralogic composition or crystal form and which does
not polarize light. Crystallites represent the initial stage
of crystallization of a magma.
Dendrite
An oxide of manganese that has crystallized in a
branching pattern: e.g., dark inclusions in moss agate.
Diaphaniety
The light-transmitting quality of a mineral or rock.
Diorite
A group of plutonic rocks usually composed of
dark-colored amphibole, acid plagioclase, pyroxene, and
sometimes a small amount of quartz. An intrusive
equivalent of andesite.

Dip
The angle that a structural surface, such as a beddipg or
fault plane, makes with the horizontal, measured
perpendicular to the strike of the structure.

Dolomite
A carbonate sedimentary rock consisting chiefly (more
than 50% by weight or by areal percentages under the
microscope) of the mineral dolomite or approximating
the mineral dolomite in composition, or a variety of
limestone or marble rich in magnesium carbonate;
specifically a carbonate sedimentary rock containing
more than 90% dolomite and less than 10% calcite, or
one having a Ca/Mg ratio in the range of 1.5-1.7, or
one having an approximate MgO equivalent of
19.5-21.6% or magnesium-carbonate equivalent of
41.0-45.4%. Occurs in crystalline and non-crystalline
forms, is clearly associated and often interbedded with
limestone, and usually represents a post-depositional
repiacement of limestone. Pure dolomite will effervesce
very slowly in cold hydrochloric acid in contrast to
limestone.
Dolomitization
The process. by which limestone is wholly or partly
converted to dolomite rock or dolomitic limestone by the
replacement of the original calcium carbonate (calcite)
by magnesium carbonate (mineral dolomite), usually
through the action of magnesium-bearing water (sea
water or percolating meteoric water). It can occur
penecontemporaneously or shortly after deposition of the
limestone, or during the lithification at alater date.
Extrusive
Said of igneous rock that has been ejected onto the
surface of the earth . Extrusive rocks include lava flows
and detrital material such as vokanic ash.
Feldspar
A group of abundant rock-forming minerals of general
formula: MAt(Al,Si)30s, where M=K,Na,Ca,Ba,Rb,Sr,
and Fe. Feldspars are the most widespread of any
mineral group and constitute 60% of the earth's crust;
they occur as components of all kinds of rocks (crystalline
schists, migmatites, gneisses, granites and most magmatic
rocks) and as fissure minerals in clefts and druse minerals
in cavities. Feldspars are usually white or nearly white
and clear and translucent (they have no color of their own
but are frequently colored by impurities), have a
hardness of 6 on Moh's scale, frequently display twinning,
exhibit monoclinic or triclinic symmetry, and possess
good cleavage in two directions (intersecting at 90
degrees as in orthoclase and at about 86 degrees as in
plagioclase). On decomposition, feldspars yield a large
part of the clay of soil and also the mineral kaolinite.

151

Felsite
A light-colored, fine-grained extrusive rock or hypabyssal
rock with or without phenocrysts and composed chiefly of
quartz and feldspar; a rock characterized by felsitic
( aphanitic) texture.
Ferruginous
(a) Pertaining to or containing iron,e.g. a sandstone that
is cemented with iron oxide or a schist that that contains
enough iron to be economically valuable.Â·
(b) Said of a rock having a rusty color due to the presence
of ferric oxide. The quantity of iron does not have to be
large; neither do all red rocks derive their color from
iron.
Flint
A variety of homogeneous dark-gray to black chert.
According to Tarr (1938) the term "flint" should either
be discarded or reserved for siliceous artifacts (such as
the "flint arrowheads" usedÂ· by primitive man because
rocks described as flint are identical with chert in
texture and composition, despite the fact that the term
"flint" has been in use at least since about A.D. 700 for
"anything hard" and since about A.D. 1000 for a "variety
of stone" and that it antedates "chert" by almost 1,000
years.
Fusilinid
Any foraminifera belonging to the suborder Fusulinina,
characterized by a calcareous microgranular test. Their
known stratigraphic range 1.s Ordovician to Triassic.
Geode
(a) A hollow or partly hollow and globular or
subspherical body, from 2.5 cm to 30 cm or more in
diameter, found in certain' limestone beds and also, but
rarely, in shales characterized by a thin and sometimes
incomplete outermost primary layer of dense chalcedony,
by a cavity that is partly filled by an inner lining of
inward-projecting crystals (often perfectly formed and
usually of quartz or calcite and sometimes of barite,
celestite, and various sulfides) deposited from solution on
the cavity walls, and by evidence of growth by expansion
in the cavities of fossils or along fracture surfaces of
shells. Unlike a druse, a geode is separable (by
weathering) as a discrete nodule or concretion from the
rock in which it occurs and its inner crystals are not of the
same minerals as those of the enclosing rock.
(b) The crystal-lined cavity in a rock.
Granite
(a) A plutonic rock in which quartz constitutes 10 to 50 %
of the felsic components and in which the alkali/total
feldspar ratio is generally held to the range of 65 to 90
percent. Rocks in this range of composition are scarce in
nature, and sentiment has been growing to include rocks
designated as adamellite or quartz monzonite, which are
abundant in the U.S.
Â·

(b) Broadly applied, any holocrystalline, quartz-bearing
plutonic rock.
Graywacke
An old rock name that has been variously defined but
is now generally applied to a dark (usually gray or
greenish gray, sometimes black) and very hard,tough,
and firmly indurated, coarse-grained sandstone that
has a subconchoidal fracture and consists of poorly
sorted and extremely angular to subangular grains of
quartz and feldspar with an abundant variety of
small, dark rock and mineral fragments embedded in a
preponderant and compact, partly metamorphosed
clayey matix having the general composition of slate and
containing an abundance of very fine-grained
micaceous and chloritic minerals. There are currently
some ten other modern classifications of graywacke.
Folk suggested discarding usage of the term for
precise petrographic purposes and relegating it to
nonquantitive field usage for "a very hard, dark,
clayey, impure sandstone that you can't tell much
about in the field" (Folk 1968:125), and later refers
to graywackes as phyllarenites (Folk 1974:113).
Hornfels
A fine-grained rock
equidimensional grains
and typically formed
Porphyroblasts or relict
the characteristically
matrix.

composed of a mosaic of
without preferred orientation
by contact metamorphism.
phenocrysts may be present in
granoblastic (or decussate)

Hypabyssal
[intrusive rocks] Pertaining to an igneous intrusion,
or to the rock of that intrusion, whose depth is
intermediate between that of abyssal or plutonic and
the surface. This distinction is not considered
relevant by some petrologists.
Indurated
Said of a compact rock or soil hardened by the
action of pressure, cementation, and esp. heat; e.g.
indurated silt or claystones that exhibit
subconchoidal fracture to such an extent that they can
be effectively flaked for stone tools.
Interfluve
The area between rivers; especially the relatively
undissected upland or ridge between two adjacent
valleys containing streams flowing in the same
general direction.
Intrusive
[adj.] Of or pertaining to intrusion, both the process
and the rock so formed. Igneous intrusion is the
process of emplacement of magma in previously existing
rock; also the igneous rock mass so formed within the
surrounding rock.

152

Jasper
A dense, cryptocrystalline, opaque (to slightly
translucent) variety of chert (always quartz)
associated with iron-oxide impurieties that give the
rock various colors, characteristically red, although
yellow, green, grayish-blue, brown and black cherts
have also been called jasper. The term has also been
applied to any red chert or chalcedony irrespective of
associated iron ore.
Jasperoid
(a) A dense,usually gray, chert-like, siliceous rock in
which chalcedony or cryptocrystalline quartz has
replaced the carbonate minerals of limestone or
dolomite; a silicified limestone. It typically
develops as the gangue of metasomatic sulfide deposits
of the lead-zinc type (as those of Missouri, Oklahoma,
and Kansas).
(b) [adj.] Resemblingjasper.
Lamphrophyre
A group of dark-colored, porphyritic, hypabyssal
igneous rocks characterized by panidiomorphic
texture (i.e., lamprophoric), a high percentage of
mafic minerals (esp. biotite, hornblende, and
pyroxene), which form the phenocrysts, and a finegrained groundmass with the same mafic minerals in
addition to light-colored minerals (feldspars or
feldspathoids); also any rock in that group, e.g.,
minette,
vosgesite,
kersanite,
spessarite,
camptonite, monchiquite, fourchite, alnoite.
Lamphrophyres are frequently highly altered and are
commonly associated with carbonatites.
Li thareni te
(a) A term introduced by McBride (1963) as a
shortened form of lithic arenite and used by him for
a sandstone (regardless of texture) containing more
than 25% fine-grained rock fragments, less than 10%
feldspar, and less than 75% quartz, quartzite, and
chert.
(b) A general term used by Folk (1968) for a
sandstone containing less than 75% quartz and more
than 25% fine-grained volcanic, metamorphic, and
sedimentary rock fragments, including chert (or
whose content of such rock fragments is at least
three times that of feldspar and plutonic rock
fragments), regardless of clay content or texture.
Ma fie
Said of an igneous rock composed chiefly of one or more
of the ferromagnesian, dark-colored minerals in its mode;
also said of those minerals. It is the opposite of felsic.
Mega quartz
A general term for quartz overgrowths, crystals,
geode and vein fillings, composed of equant to

elongated grains larger than 20 microns (Folk 1974:
80).
Microcrystalline
Said of the texture of a rock consisting of or
having crystals that are small enough to be
visible only under the microscope; also said of
a rock with such a texture. In regard to
carbonate sedimentary rocks, various diameter
ranges are in use: 0.01-0.20 (Pettijohn 1957:93); less than
0.01 (Carozzi & Textoris 1967:6); and 0.001-0.01 mm
(Bissell & Chilingar 1967:161, who note that some
petrographers use 0.004-0.062).
Micro quartz
(a) Microcrystalline quartz, forming a pinpointbirefringent aggregate of equidimensional grains usually
ranging from 1-5 microns in diameter (but ranging from
a fraction of a micron in the apparently isotropic cherts to
an upper limit of 20 microns).
(b) Chalcedonic quartz, forming sheaf-like bundles
of radiating extremely thin fibers, which average about
0.1 mm. long but may range from 20 microns to a
millimeter in length. Both forms of microquartz consist of
nothing but finely crystalline quartz containing variable
amounts of very minute liquid-filled spherical bubbles,
averaging 0.1 micron in diameter, which look brownish in
transmitted light and silvery in reflected light. These
bubbles are responsible for lowering the index of
chalcedony so that it varies from 1.535 in the most bubbly
specimens up to 1.544 in those with few bubbles. They
also decrease the density of microquartz and provide a
sponge-like character so that solution is quicker and this
type of quartz consequently weathers faster than
megaquartz (Folk 1974: 80).
Montmorillonite
A group of expanding-lattice clay minerals
of general formula Ro.33 AliS4010 (OH)z.nH20
where R includes one or more of the cations Na+,
K +,Mg+ 2, Ca+ 2, and possibly others. Magnesium
or iron may proxy for aluminum, and aluminum
for silica. The montmorillinite minerals are
generally
derived
from
alteration
of
ferromagnesian minerals, calcic feldspars, and
volcanic glasses; they are the chief constituents of
bentonite and fuller's earth, and are very common in
soils, sedimentary rocks, and associated with some
mineral deposits.
Nodule
A small, hard, and irregular, rounded, or tuberous body
(knot, mass, lump) of a mineral aggregate, normally
having a warty or knobby surface and no internal
structure, and usually exhibiting a contrasting
composition from and a greater hardness than the
enclosing sediment or rock matrix in which it is
embedded; e.g., a chert nodule in limestone. Most
153

nodules appear to be secondary structures; in
sedimentary rocks they are primarily the result of
postdepositional replacement of the host rock and are
commonly elongated parallel to the bedding.
Novaculite
A very dense and hard, even-textured,
cryptocrystalline, siliceous sedimentary rock
characterized by dominance of microcrystalline
quartz over chalcedony and by accessory minerals
such as feldspar and garnet. It was formerly
supposed to be consolidated siliceous slime, but it
is now considered to be a result of primary
deposition of silica under geosynclinal conditions.
Folk (1965), McBride and Thomson (1970), and
Sholes (1978) include novaculite as a variety of
chert. Novaculite was first considered to be lightcolored and primarily white, but it now is known to
include red, brown, and even black colors in
addition to the lighter colors of white, gray, yellow
pink, and green. Sholes has been able to distinguish
aphanic cherts from novaculite in the formation
solely on the basis of a coarser texture in the
novaculite.
Nova-chert
A term used by Banks (1984b:150) to distinguish the
high quality chert derived from the Arkansas
Novaculite (that was secondarily deposited in various
shale formations and esp. the John's Valley Shale
of the Ouachita Mountains) from the novaculite itself
and from the other identifiable cherts such as the
Big Fork that also occur in the shale deposits.
Obsidian
A black or dark-colored volcanic glass, usually of
r hyolite composition characterized by conchoidal
fracture. It is sometimes banded or has microlites.
Usage of the term goes back as far as Pliny, who
described the rock from Ethiopia. Syn: Iceland agate;
hyalopsite; mountain mahogany.
Obsidian Hydration Dating
A method of calculating an age in years for an obsidian
artifact or Holocene volcanic glass by determining the
thickness of the hydration rim which has been produced
by water vapor slowly diffusing intoa freshly chipped
surface and producing a hydrated layer or rind. It is
applicable to glasses 200 to 200,000 years old.
Opal
A mineral (or mineral gel): Si02.nH20. It is an
amorphous (colloidal) form of silica containing a varying
proportion of water (as much as 20% but usually 3-9%)
and occurring in nearly all colors. Opal is transparent to
nearly opaque, and typically exhibits a definite and
often marked iridescent play of color. It differs from
quartz in being isotropic, having a lower refracdve

index, and being softer and less dense. Opal usually
occurs massive and pseudomorphous after other
minerals, and is deposited at low temperatures from
silica-bearing waters. It is found in cracks and cavities of
igneous rocks, in flint-like nodules in limestones, in
mineral veins, in deposits of hot and warm springs, in
siliceous skeletons of various marine organisms (such as
diatoms and sponges), in serpentinized rocks, in
weathering products, and in most chalcedony and flint.
Opalite
An impure, colored variety of common opal.

Orogeny
Â·Literally, the process of forming of mountains.
Orthoclase
A colorless, white, cream-yellow, flesh-reddish, or
grayish mineral of the alkali feldspar group: KA1SbOs. It
is the partly ordered, monoclinic modification of
potassium feldspar and is dimorphous with microdine,
being stable at higher temperatures; it usually contains
some sodium in minor amounts. Ordinary or common
ortho,clase is one of the commonest rock-forming
minerals; it occurs esp. in granites, acid igneous rocks,
and crystalline schists , and is usually perthitic.
Pebble
See sediment size.
Perlite
A volcanic glass having the composition of r hyolite,
perlitic texture, and a generally higher water content
than obsidian. Syn: pearlite; pearlstone.
Petrography
That branch of geology dealing with the description
and classification of rocks, esp. igneous and
metamorphic rocks and esp. by means of microscopic
examination of thin sections (petrographic
analysis). Petrography is more restricted inÂ· scope
than petrology which is concerned with the origin,
occurrence, structure, and history of rocks.
Phenocryst
A relatively large conspicuous crystal m
porphyritic rock.

a

Pitchstone
A volcanic glass, usually intrusive, with a waxy,
dull, resinous, pitchy luster rather than a bright,
glassy luster. Its color and composition vary
widely; it contains a higher percentage of water
than obsidian. Crystallites are detectable in thin
section.
Plagioclase
A group of triclinic feldspars of general formula:
(Na, Ca)Al(Si,Al)SbOs. At high temperatures it
forms a complete solid-solution series from Ab

154

(NaAlShOs) to An (CaAlzShOs). The plagioclase
series is arbitrarily subdivided and named
according to increasing mole fraction of the An
component: albite (An 0-10), oligoclase (An 10-30),
andesine (An 30-50), laboradorite (An 50-70),
bytownite (An70-90), and anorthite (An 90-100). The
Al/Si ratio varies with increasing An content from
1:3 to 1:1. Plagioclases are one of the commonest
rock-forming minerals, have characteristic
twinning and commonly display zoning.
Plutonic
(a) Pertaining to igneous rocks formed at great depth
(b) Pertaining to rocks formed by any process at great
depth.
Porcellanite
A hard, dense, siliceous rock having the texture,
dull luster, hardness, fracture, or general
appearance of porcelain; it is less hard, dense,
and vitreous than chert. The term has been used
for various kinds of rocks such as: an impure
chert, in part argillaceous and in part Â·calcareous, or more
rarely, sideritic (siliceous shale); an indurated or baked
clay or shale with a dull, light-colored, cherty
appearance, often found in the roof or floor of a
burned-out coal seam; and a fine-grained acidic tuff
~ompacted by secondary silica.
Porphyry
An igneous rock of any composition that contains
conspicuous phenocrysts in a fine-grained groundmass;
a porphyritic igneous rock. The rock name descriptive
of the groundmass composition usually precedes the
ter~, e.g., diorite porphyry.
Quartz
(a) Crystalline silica, an important rock-forming
mineral:Si02. It is, next to feldspar, the commonest
mineral, occurring either in colorless and transparent
hexagonal crystals (sometimes colored yellow, brown,
purple, red, green, blue,. or black by impurities) or in
crystalline or cryptocrystalline masses. Quartz is the
commonest gangue mineral of ore deposits, forms the
major portion of most sands, and has a widespread
distribution in igneous (esp. granitic), metamorphic, and
sedimentary rocks. It has a vitreous to greasy luster, a
conchoidal fracture, an absence of cleavage, and a
hardness of 7 ~n Moh's scale (scratches glass easily, but
cannot be scratched by a knife); it is composed
exclusively of silicon-oxygen tetrahedra with all oxygens
joined together in a three-dimenisional network.
(b) A general term for a variety of noncrystalline or
cryptocrystalline minerals having the same chemical
composition as that of quartz, such as chalcedony, agate,
and opal.

Quartzite

across instead of between the grains. See meta- and
ortho-quartzites below.
(a) Meta-quartzite
A
quartzite
formed
by
metamorphic
recrystallization, as distinguished from an
orthoquartzite, whose crystalline nature is of sedimentary
origin.
(b) Orthoquartzite
A elastic sedimentary rock that is made up almost
exclusively of quartz sand (with or without chert), that is
relatively free of or lacks a fine-grained matrix, and that
is derived by secondary silicification; a
quartzite of sedimentary origin, or a "pure
quartz sandstone".
Quartzitic sandstone
A sandstone that contains 100% quartz
grains cemented with silica. The term is
essentially equivalent to orthoquartzite.
Radiolaria
Any actinopod belonging to the subclass Radiolaria,
characterized mainly by a siliceous skeleton and a
marine pelagic environment. Their stratigraphic
range is Cambrian to present.
Radiolarian Chert
A well-bedded, cryptocrystalline radiolarite
that has a well-developed siliceous cement or
groundmass ; it appears to have accumulated in distinctly
shallow water.
Replacement
The process of practically simultaneous capillary
solution and deposition by which a new mineral of
partly or wholly differing chemical composition may
grow in the body of an old mineral or mineral
aggregate.
Rhyodacite
A group of extrusive porphyritic igneous rocks
intermediate in composition between dacite and
r hyolite, with quartz, plagioclase, and biotite (or
hornblende) as the main phenocryst minerals and a
fine-grained to glassy groundmass composed of alkali
feldspar and silica minerals; the extrusive
equivalent of granodiorite or quartz monzonite. Syn:
quartz latite; dellenite.
Rudistid
Any bivalve mollusk belonging to the superfamily
Hippuritacea, characterized by an inequivalve shell,
usually attached to a substrate, rarely free, and
either solitary or gregarious, in reef-like masses.
They are frequently found in association with corals.
Their stratigraphic range is Upper Jurassic to Upper
Cretaceous, and possibly into the Paleocene.

155

Sediment size
Definitions for fine, medium, and coarse vary

range of 60-200 mm has been used.
(b) A rock or mineral fragment in the soil, having a
diameter in the range of 20-200 mm. In the U.S., the

term is used for a soil particle having a diameter in the
range of 75-250 mm (3-10 in.)
Boulder
A detached rock mass larger than a cobble, having a
diameter greater than 256 mm (10 in., or -8 phi
units), being somewhat rounded or otherwise
distinctively shaped by abrasion in the course of
water transport; the largest rock fragment recognized
by sedimentologists. In Great Britain, the limiting
size of 200 mm (8 in.) has been used.
Schist
A strongly foliated crystalline rock formed by dynamic
metamorphism which can be readily split into thin flakes
or slabs due to the well developed parallelism of 50% of
the minerals present, particularly those of lamellar or

orthoclase, micro dine,, or perthite), a small amount
of plagioclase (less than in monzonite), one or more
mafic minerals (esp hornblende), and quartz, if present
only as an accessory. Intrusive equivalent of trachyte.
With an increase in quartz content, syenite grades into
granite.

Serpentine

the formula: (Mg, Fe)3ShOs(OH)4. Serpentines have a
greasy or silky luster, a slightly soapy feel, and a
tough, conchoidal fracture; they are usually compact
but may be granular or fibrous, and are commonly
green, greenish yellow, or greenish gray (sometimes
brown, black or white) and often veined or spotted
with red, green, and white. Sepertines are always
secondary minerals, derived by alteration of
magnesian-rich silicate minerals (esp. olivines), and
are found in both igneous and metamorphic rocks; they
generally crystallize in the monoclinic system, but
only as pseudomorphs. Translucent varieties are used
for ornamental and decorative purposes, often as a
substitute for jade.

Trachyte
Fine-grained, generally porphyritic, extrusive rocks
having alkali feldspar, minor mafic minerals (biotite,
hornblende, or pyroxene) as the main components, and
possibly a small amount of acid plagioclase. The
extrusive equivalent of syenite.

Silcrete
A term suggested for a conglomerate consisting of
surficial sand and gravel cemented into a hard mass
by silica.

Trichite
A straight or curved hairlike crystallite, usually
black. Trichites occur singly or radially arranged in
clusters and are found in glassy igneous rocks.

composed essentially of talc with varying amounts of
micas, chlorite, amphibole, pyroxenes, etc. and
derived from the alteration of ferromagnesian
silicate minerals.

156

Thermoluminescent (TL) Dating
A dating process based upon the rates of emission of
freed electrons from the crystal lattice of minerals that
had been trapped by heat at the time of initial burning or
heating. The TL clock is reset with each subsequent
heating of greater intensity than the previous. The
technique is particularly suited to dating fired ceramics
or clay and heated or burned rocks and especially
siliceous rocks.
