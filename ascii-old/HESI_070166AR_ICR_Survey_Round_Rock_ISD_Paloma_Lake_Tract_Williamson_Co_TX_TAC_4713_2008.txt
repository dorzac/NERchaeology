MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

During November 2007, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted an
intensive cultural resources survey of the Round Rock Independent School District’s (ISD) 15acre Paloma Lake tract near Round Rock, Williamson County, Texas. As Round Rock ISD is a
public institution, the development of the property is regulated by the Antiquities Code of Texas.
At the request of Round Rock ISD, Horizon conducted the cultural resources survey under
Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) permit number 4713 in compliance with the Antiquities
Code of Texas. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any archeological sites were
located within the boundaries of the property and, if any existed, to determine their eligibility for
formal designation as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs).
The survey resulted in the documentation of 1 new historic archeological site
(41WM1196).
Site 41WM1196 is the remnants of a small farmstead that has been
predominantly removed from the property with only foundations and domestic debris remaining.
Observed cultural materials suggest that the site may have been occupied as early as the
1920s. The farmstead is visible on a 1941 and 1976 aerial photograph of the area, but is no
longer visible on the 1988 aerial photograph of the area. The cultural materials and aerial
photographs suggest that the farmstead operated during the early to middle parts of the 20th
century. After the removal of the structures on the site, modern corrals and associated ranching
structures (e.g., a windmill and several small pole barns) were constructed on the site.
Chain of title research indicated that the property consists of 2 tracts of lands that were
both owned by T.E. Nelson and family until they sold them both in 1941. Unfortunately, the
abstractor conducting the chain of title research was unable to find source deeds for the tracts
pre-dating 1941. However, it is the abstractor’s opinion that the tracts were owned by the
Nelson family for many years prior to 1941. Based on this information and the visible presence
of the farmstead on the 1941 aerial photograph of the property, it is concluded with reasonable
certainty that the farmstead was constructed and operated by the T.E. Nelson family. A further
review of the literature failed to produce information that would indicate that T.E. Nelson was a
prominent figure in the history of the area or was associated with a significant historical event.
Based on the lack of intact, standing structures associated with the original occupation of the
site, as well as the lack of association with a prominent person or event in the local or regional
history of the area, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41WM1196 is not eligible for formal
designation as an SAL and that no additional investigations are warranted on this site.

Management Summary

Aside from site 41WM1196, no other sites were documented within 15-acre Paloma
Lake tract. As such, it is Horizon’s opinion that development within the property will have no
impact on significant cultural resources. Horizon therefore recommends that cultural resources
clearance be granted for the entire 15-acre Paloma Lake tract.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of an intensive cultural resources survey of the Round
Rock Independent School District’s (ISD) 15-acre Paloma Lake tract near Round Rock,
Williamson County, Texas (Figures 1 and 2). As Round Rock ISD is a public institution, the
development of the property is regulated by the Antiquities Code of Texas. At the request of
Round Rock ISD, Horizon conducted the cultural resources survey under Texas Antiquities
Committee (TAC) permit number 4713 in compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas. The
purpose of the survey was to determine if any archeological sites were located within the
boundaries of the property and, if any existed, to determine their eligibility for formal designation
as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs).
The cultural resources investigations consisted of an archival review, an intensive
pedestrian survey of the 15-acre property, and the production of a report suitable for review by
the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas Historical
Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council
of Texas Archeologists’ (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports. Russell
Brownlow (Horizon’s cultural resources director) served as the project’s Principal Investigator.
Reign Clark (Horizon project archeologist) supervised the field crew consisting of Jared
Wiersema and Michael Mudd (Horizon field technicians).
Horizon conducted the survey of the 15-acre tract on 2 November 2007. This entailed
intensive surface inspection and shovel testing. The Texas State Minimum Archeological
Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 1 shovel test per 2 acres for projects
measuring between 11 and 100 acres in size. As such, a total of 8 shovel tests were required to
meet the minimum survey standards. Horizon exceeded the minimum survey standards by
excavating a total of 18 shovel tests over the 15-acre tract.
The survey resulted in the documentation of 1 new historic archeological site
(41WM1196).
Site 41WM1196 is the remnants of a small farmstead that has been
predominantly removed from the property with only foundations and domestic debris remaining.
Observed cultural materials suggest that the site may have been occupied as early as the
1920s. The farmstead is visible on a 1941 and 1976 aerial photograph of the area, but is no
longer visible on the 1988 aerial photograph of the area. The cultural materials and aerial

photographs suggest that the farmstead operated during the early to middle parts of the 20th
century. After the removal of the structures on the site, modern corrals and associated ranching
structures (e.g., a windmill and a small pole barn) were constructed on the site.
Chain of title research indicated that the property consists of 2 tracts of lands that were
both owned by T.E. Nelson and family until they sold them both in 1941. Unfortunately, the
abstractor conducting the chain of title research was unable to find source deeds for the tracts
pre-dating 1941. However, it is the abstractor’s opinion that the tracts were owned by the
Nelson family for many years prior to 1941. Based on this information and the visible presence
of the farmstead on the 1941 aerial photograph of the property, it is concluded with reasonable
certainty that the farmstead was constructed and operated by the T.E. Nelson family. A further
review of the literature failed to produce information that would indicate that T.E. Nelson was a
prominent figure in the history of the area or was associated with a significant historical event.
Based on the lack of intact, standing structures associated with the original occupation of the
site, as well as the lack of association with a prominent person or event in the local or regional
history of the area, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41WM1196 is not eligible for formal
designation as an SAL and that no additional investigations are warranted on this site.
Aside from site 41WM1196, no other sites were documented within 15-acre Paloma
Lake tract. As such, it is Horizon’s opinion that development within the property will have no
impact on significant cultural resources. Horizon therefore recommends that cultural resources
clearance be granted for the entire 15-acre Paloma Lake tract.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The 15-acre Paloma Lake tract is located roughly 3.0 miles northeast of Round Rock in
Williamson County, Texas. More specifically, it is located east of the intersection of County
Road (CR) 117 and Tate Lane (see Figures 1 and 2). It can be found on the US Geological
Survey (USGS) 7.5’ Hutto, Texas, and Round Rock, Texas, topographic quadrangles (see
Figure 1). It is situated in a generally rural setting that has been primarily used for farming and
ranching. Due to its location between the rapidly growing towns of Round Rock and Hutto, the
general area is currently experiencing urban encroachment in the form of a variety of new
subdivisions. On-site photographs are provided in Figures 3 through 6.

2.2

CURRENT LAND USE

The entire 15-acre tract is currently used for agricultural purposes. The northern 1/3 of
the property contains corrals that reflect ranching activities, while the southern 2/3 of the
property consists of plowed agricultural fields (see Figures 2 through 6). A review of the 1941,
1976, and 1988 aerial photographs of the property indicate that it has been utilized for similar
agricultural purposes since at least 1941 (Figures 7 through 9). As can be seen in the 1941 and
1976 aerial photographs (Figures 7 and 8), a small farmstead once stood in the northern 1/3 of
the property where corrals are found today. The lack of visible structures in the 1988 aerial
photograph (Figure 9) suggests that occupation of the property ceased between 1976 and 1988
and that the area was then utilized for ranching purposes.

2.3

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

Topography on the 15-acre tract is relatively flat, sloping gently to the east and northeast
toward McNutt Creek (see Figure 1). Surface elevation ranges from approximately 725 to 740
feet above mean sea level. Generally speaking, the 15-acre tract lies in an upland setting
typical of the Blackland Prairie. It is situated approximately 1300 feet west of McNutt Creek,
which drains the area from generally west to east. McNutt Creek confluences with Brushy
Creek to the southeast, and Brushy Creek eventually flows into the San Gabriel River a
considerable distance to the east, north of Rockdale, Texas. All of these waterways are part of
the Brazos River drainage basin.

The southern 2/3 of the 15-acre Paloma Lake tract consist of plowed agricultural fields
with newly planted crops (see Figures 3 and 4). The northern 1/3 of the property has been
cleared in the past during its use as a small farmstead. Currently, short grasses cover the
majority of the area and stands of hackberry trees grow along the fence and corral lines.

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The archeological record of Central Texas spans the known cultural-historical sequence:
Paleo-Indian, 11,200 to 8000 BP; Archaic, 8000 to 1400 BP; and Late Prehistoric, 1400 to 400
BP. A brief breakdown of this general sequence is presented below.

3.1

PALEO-INDIAN PERIOD (CA. 11,200 TO 8000 BP)

The Paleo-Indian period is believed to be the earliest cultural occupation in the Central
Texas region. This stage is characterized typologically by the occurrence of distinctive
lanceolate projectile points and highly mobile settlement and exploitation patterns. These
populations probably practiced a foraging (i.e., hunting and gathering) type of subsistence
(Prewitt 1981; Weir 1976), although the best-known sites exhibit a focus on the exploitation of
large mammals, including Mammuthus sp. and Bison antiquus. Investigations at sites such as
the Kincaid Rockshelter, Wilson-Leonard, and Gault have shown that, during the early part of
the Paleo-Indian, the Clovis stage, subsistence included large herbivores (e.g., mammoth,
bison, and horse) as well as smaller animals such as water turtles, badgers, and raccoons. A
multitude of plants are presumed to have also been an important part of the aboriginal diet.
However, during the later part of the Paleo-Indian period, the Folsom and Plainview stages,
subsistence seems to have depended more heavily on the specialized hunting of big game,
particularly bison. This presumption is based on the fact that only camps, stone-working
locations, and kill sites, mostly in or near grassland habitats, have been documented (Collins
1995:382). This change was most likely attributable to the climate, which had become warmer
and drier than the previous Clovis stage.

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 8000 TO 1400 BP)

The Archaic period, which covers 2/3 of Central Texas prehistory (Collins 1995), is
divided into 3 subperiods: Early (8000 to 5000 BP), Middle (5000 to 3000 BP), and Late (3000
to 1200 BP) (Hester 1986). The beginning of the Archaic period in Texas represents a similar
transition found world-wide at approximately the same time, the most noted indicators being the
extinction of Pleistocene megafauna and climatic changes. In Texas, there was a gradual
decrease in moisture and humidity reflecting the intensification of warming and drying trends
first noted during the Clovis-Folsom transition. An often-quoted response to these climatic
changes was a greater and more varied use of local resources; in actuality, this was already the
case in most places. Plant-processing implements such as manos and metates and earth

13

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

ovens become more evident in the archeological record, while the hunting of game continued.
Although still nomadic, people of the Archaic period restricted their travel to smaller areas than
did the Paleo-Indian groups.

3.3

EARLY ARCHAIC (8000 TO 5000 BP)

The Early Archaic, the least understood period, is distinguished by the switch from
Paleo-Indian lanceolate-shaped points to notched-and-stemmed points. Overall, the Early
Archaic patterns in Texas are fairly similar throughout the state. Hester (1989) observed that,
prior to 5000 BP, the late Holocene hunters and foragers were essentially indistinguishable in
terms of subsistence strategies across Region 3, which includes the Central Texas Plateau
Prairie, South Texas Plains, and Lower Pecos Canyon lands. After that date, regionally
distinctive projectile points emerge. Hughes (1991) also noted similarities when he wrote that
the Early Archaic typological developments on the Texas High Plains resembled developments
in Central and Southwestern Texas as well as in other bordering regions.
Although settlement patterns for the Early Archaic are little known, it is assumed that the
population density was low and organized into small bands practicing a mobile, generalized
subsistence and settlement pattern. The wide distribution of artifacts suggests that mobility was
high and territories relatively undefined. McKinney (1981), among others, has noted that the
distribution of Early Archaic sites was apparently concentrated along the Balcones Escarpment.
This phenomenon may possibly reflect the greater availability of water resources along this
feature during an arid climatic interval (Hester 1989).
Sites containing Early Archaic components are open campsites such as Loeve, WilsonLeonard, Richard Beene, Sleeper, Landslide, Granberg II, Jetta Court, and Hall’s Cave. Lithic
materials found within these components include grinding implements, hammerstones, projectile
points, a variety of unifacial and bifacial chipped stone instruments, and Clear Fork and
Guadalupe bifaces. The Clear Fork tools, although indicative primarily of the Early Archaic,
actually appeared in the Late Paleo-Indian period and, in some regions, lingered into Late
Archaic and Late Prehistoric times (Hughes 1991).

3.4

MIDDLE ARCHAIC (5000 TO 3000 BP)

The Middle Archaic is marked by an increased number of sites, which may reflect an
expanding population, the development of regionally distinct cultural patterns, and changes in
settlement, technology, social systems, and territorial boundaries (Black and McGraw 1985:38).
Hester (1986) suggests that, during this period, the inhabitants of the Balcones Escarpment
region developed specialized adaptations to the hunting and gathering of abundant regional
resources, particularly acorns and white-tailed deer.
Site types include open campsites located near streams or tributaries, lithic workshops in
upland areas, and special-activity sites such as hunting camps or food-processing stations
(Black and McGraw 1985). Large burned rock features (hearths and rock ovens) of the early
part of the Middle Archaic gave way in the later Middle Archaic to burned rock middens (Collins
1995).
These latter features have been interpreted as representing several different

14

070166_arch_survey_report

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the 15-Acre Round Rock ISD Paloma Lake Tract

subsistence practices. For example, Hester (1986) proposed that they represent intensive
utilization of acorns, while Johnson and Goode (1994:26) suggested that they were more
frequently being used to cook xerophytes such as sotol. This latter explanation has been
supported by a number of recent investigations where evidence of preserved camas bulbs have
been recovered within oven and midden contexts (Brownlow 2003, 2004a, 2004b; Bush 2004;
Dering 1999, 2002; Mauldin et al. 2003; Ricklis and Collins 1994). Middle Archaic projectile
points include Nolan, Travis, Langtry, and Pedernales (Black 1989), the latter of which is
considered by Hester (1986) to be diagnostic of this time period in the Balcones Escarpment
region.

3.5

LATE ARCHAIC (3000 TO 1400 BP)

The Late Archaic is represented by a continuation, and possibly intensification, of the
subsistence patterns seen in the Middle Archaic (Hester 1986; Collins 1995). The use of
burned rock midden sites continued throughout the Middle Archaic, peaking during the latter
part of this period (Collins 1995). Large cemetery sites are first noted during the Late Archaic
and may reflect the establishment of territories and subsistence schedules (Black 1989:30;
Black and McGraw 1985; Story 1985:49). Hester (1986) suggests that the development of
wide-ranging trade contacts also may have occurred around this time. Characteristic projectile
points include triangular types such as Lange, Montell, Castroville, and Marcos, along with
smaller, expanding-stem points such as Ensor, Frio, Darl, and Fairland.
Although Hester (1986) places the Late Archaic between 3000 and 1400 BP, a later
carving of the Archaic period by Johnson and Goode (1994) attempts to push back the initiation
point of the Late Archaic to around 4300 BP. This more recent division is based on what is
seen as a strong continuity between the material culture and subsistence practices of groups
utilizing the Pedernales point style and those utilizing the later Montell point style. Primarily,
Johnson and Goode (1994) point to similarities in the blade shape of these 2 styles, as well as
similar large, billet-thinned knives utilized during the times of these point styles. They also note
the continuance of Pedernales period plant baking within existing burned rock middens by later
groups utilizing Montell points. In fact, they view this continuity as evidence of a distinct culture
or “folk” on the eastern Edwards Plateau.
In addition to attempting to push back the initiation date of the Late Archaic period,
Johnson and Goode (1994) have also attempted to further divide the Late Archaic period into 2
subperiods (Late Archaic I and Late Archaic II) based on the material cultures as well as climatic
conditions. Their Late Archaic I subperiod coincides with the Dry Edwards Interval when xeric
conditions persisted between 4300 and 2600 BP. Diagnostic projectile points of this subperiod
include the Bulverde, Pedernales, Marshall, Montell, and Castroville styles. The Lange style
may also correspond to this subperiod based on the recovery of Lange specimens in
association with both Montell and Castroville specimens at 41WM815 and dated between 2800
to 2400 BP (Brownlow 2003). Johnson and Goode (1994:34) note that burned rock middens on
the Edwards Plateau during the Late Archaic I subperiod are more frequent than in any other
period. The increase in burned rock middens during this subperiod is undoubtedly a result of
the xeric climatic conditions that effectively expanded the ranges of certain geophytes such as

HJN 070166 AR

15

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

sotol and yucca: foodstuffs that require extended baking periods (in stone-lined ovens) in order
to break down their starches into edible simple sugars. The xeric conditions likely resulted in
the spread of grasslands on the plateau, which would have in turn attracted herds of buffalo.
Plentiful geophytic plants, as well as the presence of buffalo herds, may account for an increase
in human populations in the region as well (Weir 1976; Prewitt 1985).
Johnson and Goode’s (1994) Late Archaic II subperiod spans the time period between
2600 and 1400 BP. They equate this subperiod to more mesic climatic conditions that resulted
in the active aggradation of floodplains at many localities. The Marcos, Ensor, Frio, and Darl
dart point styles are viewed as indicators of this subperiod. Observing a break in the broad
blade stylistic tradition suggested for the Pedernales and Montell styles, Johnson and Goode
(1994:37) suggest that similarities in the Marcos style dart points to styles on the Southern
Plains may indicate an influx of new occupants from the Southern Plains or perhaps a borrowing
of projectile making techniques from this region. In addition to a perceived influx of new people
or technologies, Johnson and Goode (1994) also suggest some degree of social intercourse
with groups from the eastern US. This is evidenced by the recovery of materials such as whelk
shells and atlatl weights of exotic stone from burials dating to this time period. Although not
conclusive, Johnson and Goode (1994:37) suggest that these materials may indicate a
spreading of Eastern religious cult ideas into the region. While it cannot be conclusively stated
that groups on the Edwards Plateau subscribed to the beliefs and practices of the Eastern
religions, the evidence does suggest that groups on the plateau participated in extensive trading
with Eastern groups, primarily contributing large, thin corner-tanged knives made from local
Edwards chert.

3.6

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 1400 TO 400 BP)

The Late Prehistoric period is separated from the preceding Archaic by the introduction
of the bow and arrow and ceramics. Two phases are recognized within this period: the Austin
(ca. 1400 to 800 BP) and Toyah (ca. 800 to 400 BP) phases. The Austin phase is characterized
by the transition from the use of the atlatl and dart to that of the bow and arrow and arrow
points, particularly the expanding-stemmed Scallorn type. This phase is also distinguished by a
decline in population and changes in settlement practices, in which there was a shift from open
to protected (rockshelter) sites (Black 1989:32; Collins 1995:385). In spite of these changes,
most archeologists agree that Late Archaic subsistence practices and settlement patterns
appear to have continued during the Austin phase (Black 1989; Collins 1995; Prewitt 1974).
The Toyah phase is characterized by relatively rapid changes in technology, notably
pottery (both local and imported from the Caddo area); large, thin bifaces; Perdiz (contractingstem) arrow points; and prismatic blades (Black 1989; Collins 1995). Limited horticulture may
also have begun during this time. The Toyah tool kit was associated with the hunting of bison,
deer, and antelope, and, although nearly all sites dating to this phase have yielded bison bones,
deer was the most significant faunal resource during this time (Black 1989:32). Evidence for
agriculture is seen in the occasional corn cob found at sites such as the Timmeron Rockshelter
in Hays County. Of course, the corn could also be attributed to the same trade network that
was bringing in the Caddoan pottery.

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 250 BP TO PRESENT)

The Historic period, which began with the arrival of Europeans into the region, can be
divided into 3 subperiods: early, middle, and late. Only a brief overview of the period is given
here. For a more detailed essay, see Newcomb 1993:1-63.
The first documented arrival of Europeans into Central Texas dates to the early 18th
century (Newcomb 1993). Their influence, however, preceded their arrival. In the late 17th
century, natives from northern Mexico and southern Texas began migrating into Central Texas.
This was done in part to escape forced occupation and labor in the Spanish mines, and on
Spanish ranches. During the same time, horses stolen from the Spanish had become an
integral part of the Apache way of life. These mounted, nomadic bison hunters of the High
Plains enjoyed a tremendous advantage over their pedestrian enemies. They terrorized native
groups to the east and southeast of their High Plains homeland, forcing many to flee, some into
Central Texas (Newcomb 1993:2). Thus, the first Europeans into the region encountered native
groups fragmented by the growth of the Spanish missions, the raids of the Apache, and the
diseases that swept before the physical presence of Europeans. When these aboriginal groups
found they had nowhere else to go for protection from the forced labor or to get protection from
some of the more hostile and aggressive groups, they often turned toward the protection the
missions had to offer as a last resort. The accounts the missionaries documented of the Native
American groups they encountered and attempted to convert do not provide direct analogs to
prehistoric lifeway patterns, but rather represent a time of drastic cultural change (Collins 1995).
A few indigenous cultural patterns may have prevailed through time. Along with large, diffuse
encampments composed of peoples with mixed ethnic affiliations, small band-sized residential
camps, both dating to this particular period, are found in Central Texas (Collins 1995:386).
These latter sites may represent indigenous groups.
The middle Historic subperiod began about 1730 and ended about 1800 as the mission
system was failing (Hester 1989; Collins 1995:386). Historic documents of this period make
reference to remnants of native groups living in the missions, primarily in Bexar County (Collins
1995). Toward the end of this subperiod, the Comanche began to move into Northwestern
Texas from the high plains. Records of their presence in Central Texas at this time tend to be
highly biased since they are provided mostly from the hostile perspective of Anglo settlers
(Collins 1995).
The late Historic subperiod is composed of small numbers of mission Indians, “far flung
nomadic native groups (primarily the Comanche),” and an archeological record of the European
presence (Collins 1995:387). The earliest known historical Native American occupants in
Williamson County were the Tonkawa. The Tonkawa were considered friendly toward the early
settlers of Williamson County. The Tonkawa, the Cherokee, and the Comanche, however, were
decimated by European disease and removed from Texas by 1850. Settlement of the county
increased with communities developing along Brushy Creek and the San Gabriel River.

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

According to the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas Database (THC 2007):
Williamson County was formed on March 13, 1848 after early settlers in the region
successfully petitioned the State Legislature for its creation out of Milam County. The
original name was to be San Gabriel, then Clear Water, but eventually, it was named in
honor of Robert M. Williamson (Three-Legged Willie), an early Texas statesman and
judge. The Texas State Senate appointed the first county officials, who were then
required to select a seat of government for the county within five miles of its center. While
meeting under a live oak tree near present-day 9th and Church streets, these officials
were greeted, according to early Williamson County historian W. K. Makensom, by
George W. Glasscock, Sr. Glasscock, along with his partner, Thomas Huling, was a
prominent landowner in this and other parts of the state. Glasscock offered to donate a
parcel of land which extended from the live oak tree to the banks of the South San
Gabriel River if the new town was named in his honor. The county officials agreed and
soon commissioned Mathias Wilbarger and David C. Cowan to survey the town site. On
July 4, 1848, the first lots of Georgetown were sold. A granite memorial erected in 1930
on the site where Glasscock offered the land commemorates the town's founding.

The Handbook of Texas Online (2005) also states that Round Rock was:
. . . established on the north bank of Brushy Creek where Jacob M. Harrell, formerly a
blacksmith in Austin, set up his shop during the spring of 1848. The settlement was first
called Brushy Creek. Thomas C. Oatts, who became the first postmaster in 1851, was
asked by postal officials to submit another name, and on August 24, 1854, the town
officially became Round Rock, as suggested by Oatts and Harrell, who often fished
together from a large anvil-shaped limestone rock in Brushy Creek near their dwellings.
The Chisholm Trail, used by early cattle drivers on their way to Kansas, passed through
Round Rock, crossing Brushy Creek near the rock.
Washington Anderson had settled a short distance east of the original Round Rock in
1843 and built a gristmill, which was washed out by a flood in 1845. A later mill was
installed west of the round rock near the present low-water bridge and dam. During the
Civil War a wool-carding factory opened nearby, and in the 1870s a gin was erected.
Greenwood Masonic Institute, a three-story structure, opened in 1867 and was operated
by the Masonic Lodge until 1881, after which the Cumberland Presbyterian Church
agreed to take over its administration. They renamed it Round Rock Institute. It burned
down on April 9, 1883, and a new two-story building was constructed on College Hill. This
building burned down in 1913. Local citizens administered the institution until it was
transferred to the public schools in 1888.
In 1876, when the International-Great Northern Railroad was built through Williamson
County, its tracks were laid a short distance south and east of Round Rock. The
community began to move toward the railroad and the south bank of Brushy Creek,
building at first a tent city that was referred to for a time as "new" Round Rock. The
original site was largely abandoned and was called Old Round Rock in official records.
Since 1970 the town has developed in all directions, and so-called Old Town, consisting
of a few restored limestone structures, is now surrounded by the rest of the city.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

4.1

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Archival research conducted via the Internet at the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC)
Texas Archeological Sites Atlas web site indicated the presence of 5 previously recorded
archeological sites within a 1.2-mile (2.0-kilometer) radius of the 15-acre Paloma Lake Tract
(THC 2007). These consist of 1 historic dam (41WM1128), 1 aboriginal lithic scatter
(41WM1127), 1 aboriginal lithic procurement site (41WM744), 1 historic homestead
(41WM738), and 1 historic homestead with an associated aboriginal campsite (41WM737). No
sites, including any listed in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or designated as
SALs, occur within or immediately adjacent to the boundaries of the 15-acre tract. According to
the Atlas, no formal cultural resources surveys have been conducted within the boundaries of
the property.
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and alluvial terraces
near stream/river channels or drainages. Based on the presence of McNutt Creek a short
distance east of the property, there would appear to be at least a moderate probability for
prehistoric cultural resources being present on the property. In addition, there are several
structures visible in the northern portion of the Property on the 7.5’ USGS Hutto, Texas,
topographic quadrangle. A review of historic aerial photography indicates that these structures
were likely a small rural farmstead dating to at least as early as 1941 (see Figures 7 and 8).
The lack of visible structures in the 1988 aerial photograph (see Figure 9) suggests that
occupation of the property ceased between 1976 and 1988. With this in mind, it is probable that
the remnants of this early 20th century farmstead are still present in the northern portion of the
property.

5.0 METHODOLOGY

A 2-person Horizon archeological field crew completed the intensive pedestrian survey
of the 15-acre Paloma Lake tract on 2 November 2007. This was accomplished by walking
random transects over the extent of the property and consisted of both intensive surface
inspection and subsurface shovel testing. Due to the fact that all soils on the property consisted
of dense clays, shovel tests of significant depth were generally unsuccessful. Shovel tests
averaged 12.0 inches (30 centimeters [cm]) in diameter, and all excavated matrix from each
shovel test was passed through 1/4-inch (6-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh. The Texas State
Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 1 shovel test per 2
acres for projects measuring between 11 and 100 acres in size. As such, a total of 8 shovel
tests were necessary to meet the minimum standards. Horizon exceeded the minimum survey
standards by excavating a total of 18 shovel tests across the property.
A non-collection strategy was employed during the survey efforts. Any non-diagnostic
cultural materials (e.g., burned rock, lithic debitage, etc.) observed on the surface or within
shovel tests were to be tabulated and described in the field and then subsequently returned to
where they were found. Diagnostic cultural materials (e.g., projectile points, charcoal, etc.) were
to be collected for analysis and further documentation. Field notes were maintained on terrain,
vegetation, soils, land forms, shovel tests, cultural material observed (if any), etc. Standardized
shovel test forms were completed for every shovel test. These forms included location data,
depth, soil type, and notations on any artifacts encountered. Digital photographs with a photo
log were also completed as appropriate. The locations of all shovel tests were recorded via
handheld GPS units utilizing the UTM coordinate system and the NAD 27 map datum. Shovel
test locations are presented in Figure 10. Shovel test data are presented in Appendix A.

6.0 RESULTS

The survey of the 15-acre Paloma Lake tract resulted in the documentation of 1 new
historic archeological site (41WM1196) on the property. The location of this site is presented in
Figure 11.

6.1

SITE 41WM1196

6.1.1

General Description

Site 41WM1196 is the remnants of a small historic farmstead located in the northern
portion of the 15-acre Paloma Lake tract (Figures 11 and 12). This farmstead shows up on the
1941 and 1976 aerial photographs of the area, suggesting at least a middle 20th century
occupation of the site (see Figures 7 and 8). However, the 1988 aerial photograph of the area
suggests that all structures associated with the farmstead had been removed by 1988 (see
Figure 9). A recent aerial photograph of the location (see Figure 2) shows modern corrals on
the property. The field effort confirmed that all structures associated with the farmstead have
been removed and that modern corrals and associated structures such as a windmill and a pole
barn now stand on the site. Based on the aerial photographs, the corrals, windmill, and pole
barn at least post-date 1976 when the farmstead is still visible. Currently, all that remains of
the farmstead are the remnants of a sidewalk and a foundation of a structure that once stood on
the property. General views of the site are presented in Figures 13 through 22.
6.1.2

Observed Cultural Materials

Cultural materials on the site were primarily concentrated in the vicinity of the house
foundation remnants on the site. These included metal scrap, window glass fragments, white
ware fragments, 2 cut limestone bricks, 1 milk jug rim, and round nails, all of which were
observed on the surface of the site. Shovel tests on the site produced only round nails. In
addition to the materials listed above, 1 whole bottle was observed. This bottle is machine
made with a cork top. The seams of the bottle extend to the top of the bottle, indicating that it
post-dates 1903 (Megura 1991). Raised letters around the shoulder of the bottle read “This
Contains Mrs. Stewart’s Bluing.” Mrs. Stewart’s Bluing is a fabric whitening agent that is still
manufactured today. According to the Mrs. Stewart’s Bluing (2007) website, the embossing of
the text around the shoulder of the bottles began around 1920. In 1962, plastic screw caps
replaced the cork topped bottles that had been used up until that time. With this information in
mind, this bottle suggests that the site was occupied at least between 1920 and 1962.

6.1.3

Cultural Features

Although several structures are visible on the 1941 and 1976 aerial photographs of the
property, none of these structures were still standing during the current field effort. The only
cultural features associated with the farmstead are a short segment of sidewalk and the
remnants of a foundation, presumably of a house that once stood on the property (see Figures
15 and 16). The field crew noted that the foundation remnants may not be in their original
location, as they appeared to be pieces of the original slab that had subsequently been used as
fill material in a hole on the site. The sidewalk remnants extend through one of the corrals
constructed on the site, indicating that the corrals were built on-site after the removal of the
earlier farmstead structures. Other features on the site consist of a modern windmill, several
modern corrals, and a pole barn that appears to be associated with the corrals rather than the
original farmstead. These later features are not considered to be associated with the remnants
of the farmstead as they postdate the farmstead on the available aerial photographs.
6.1.4

Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials

Based on the aerial photographs as well as the observed extent of the surface
materials/features on the site, the horizontal extents of site 41WM1196 were assessed at 100 m
north/south by 140 m east/west. Of the 7 shovel tests conducted over the site, only 3 produced
cultural materials. Two of these produced round nails at depths of 30 and 35 centimeters below
surface (cmbs), while the third produced asbestos siding fragments from a depth of 20 cmbs.
6.1.5

Chain of Title

Chain of title research indicated that the property consists of 2 tracts of lands that were
both owned by T.E. Nelson and family until they sold them both in 1941 (Appendix B).
Unfortunately, the abstractor conducting the chain of title research was unable to find source
deeds for the tracts pre-dating 1941. However, it is the abstractor’s opinion that the tracts were
owned by the Nelson family for many years prior to 1941. After 1941, the tracts changed hands
several times. During the 1980s, one of the tracts was owned by Emkay Development
Company, Inc. until it was sold in the late 1990s. The lack of visible structures on the property
in the 1988 aerial photograph may suggest that structures were removed by the development
company in anticipation of future development that never occurred.
6.1.6

Summary

Based on the early 20th century dates indicated by the observed artifacts on the site, the
visible presence of the farmstead on the 1941 aerial photograph of the property, and the chain
of title research, it is concluded with reasonable certainty that the farmstead was constructed
and operated by the T.E. Nelson family sometime prior to 1941 and possibly as early as 1920
as indicated by the 1920 to 1962 time span of the Mrs. Stewart’s Bluing bottle observed on site.
A further review of the literature failed to produce information that would indicate that T.E.
Nelson was a prominent figure in the history of the area or was associated with a significant
historical event. Based on the lack of intact, standing structures associated with the original
occupation of the site, as well as the lack of association with a prominent person or event in the

local or regional history of the area, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41WM1196 is not eligible for
formal designation as an SAL and that no additional investigations are warranted on this site.

7.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

7.1

SUMMARY OF INVENTORY RESULTS

During November 2007, Horizon conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the
Round Rock ISD’s 15-acre Paloma Lake tract near Round Rock, Williamson County, Texas. As
Round Rock ISD is a public institution, the development of the property is regulated by the
Antiquities Code of Texas. At the request of Round Rock ISD, Horizon conducted the cultural
resources survey under TAC permit number 4713 in compliance with the Antiquities Code of
Texas. The purpose of the survey to determine if any archeological sites were located within
the boundaries of the property and, if any existed, to determine their eligibility for formal
designation as SALs.
The survey resulted in the documentation of 1 new historic archeological site
(41WM1196).
Site 41WM1196 is the remnants of a small farmstead that has been
predominantly removed from the property with only foundations and domestic debris remaining.
Observed cultural materials suggest that the site could have been occupied as early as the
1920s. The farmstead is visible on a 1941 and 1976 aerial photograph of the area, but is no
longer visible on the 1988 aerial photograph of the area. The cultural materials and aerial
photographs suggest that the farmstead operated during the early to middle parts of the 20th
century. After the removal of the structures on the site, modern corrals and associated ranching
structures (e.g., a windmill and several small pole barns) were constructed on the site.
Chain of title research indicated that the property consists of 2 tracts of lands that were
both owned by T.E. Nelson and family until they sold them both in 1941. Unfortunately, the
abstractor conducting the chain of title research was unable to find source deeds for the tracts
pre-dating 1941. However, it is the abstractor’s opinion that the tracts were owned by the
Nelson family for many years prior to 1941. Based on this information and the visible presence
of the farmstead on the 1941 aerial photograph of the property, it is concluded with reasonable
certainty that the farmstead was constructed and operated by the T.E. Nelson family. A further
review of the literature failed to produce information that would indicate that T.E. Nelson was a
prominent figure in the history of the area or was associated with a significant historical event.
Aside from site 41WM1196, no other sites were documented within the 15-acre Paloma Lake
tract.

7.2

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR LISTING AS A STATE ARCHEOLOGICAL LANDMARK

The criteria for determining the eligibility of a prehistoric or historic cultural resource for
designation as a Texas State Archeological Landmark (SAL) are presented in Chapter 191,
Subchapter D, Section 191.092, of the Texas Antiquities Code. These criteria are similar to the
criteria used in assessing the eligibility of a property for inclusion in the NRHP:
Sites, objects, buildings, artifacts, implements, and locations of historical, archeological,
scientific, or educational interest including those pertaining to prehistoric and historical
American Indians or aboriginal campsites, dwellings, and habitation sites, their artifacts
and implements of culture, as well as archeological sites of every character that are
located in, on, or under the surface of any land belonging to the State of Texas or to any
county, city, or political subdivision of the state are state archeological landmarks and are
eligible for designation (Section 191.092(a)).

For the purposes of assessing the eligibility of a historic property for designation as an
SAL, a historic site, structure, or building has historical interest if the site, structure, or building:
1. [W]as the site of an event that has significance in the history of the United States or
the State of Texas;
2. [W]as significantly associated with the life of a famous person;
3. [W]as significantly associated with an event that symbolizes an important principle or
ideal;
4. [R]epresents a distinctive architectural type and has value as an example of a period,
style, or construction technique; or,
5. [I]s important as part of the heritage of a religious organization, ethic group, or local
society (Section 191.092(b)).

7.3

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the lack of intact, standing structures associated with the original occupation of
the site, as well as the lack of association with a prominent person or event in the local or
regional history of the area, the site does not appear to meet any of the SAL eligibility criteria
listed above. As such, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41WM1196 is not eligible for formal
designation as an SAL and that no additional investigations are warranted on this site. With this
in mind, it is Horizon’s further opinion that development within the property will have no impact
on significant cultural resources. Horizon therefore recommends that cultural resources
clearance be granted for the entire 15-acre Paloma Lake tract.
