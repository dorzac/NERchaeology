ABSTRACT
HRA Gray & Pape, LLC, of Houston, Texas, performed an intensive pedestrian survey and
deep testing on an estimated 162 hectares (400 acres) of private property proposed for
construction of a residential development in Sienna Plantation, Missouri City, Fort Bend
County, Texas. Investigations took place from August to October of 2009. The project was
conducted in order to comply with United States Army Corps of Engineers permitting
requirements associated with wetlands that may be impacted during construction in the project
area. The procedures to be followed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers to fulfill
the requirements set forth in the National Historic Preservation Act, other applicable historic
preservation laws, and Presidential directives as they relate to the regulatory program of the
United States Army Corps of Engineers (33 CFR Parts 320-334) are articulated in the
Regulatory Program of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Part 325 - Processing of
Department of the Army Permits, Appendix C - Procedures for the Protection of Historic
Properties. No Antiquities Code of Texas permit was necessary because the project is located
entirely on private property.
Field investigation consisted of 100% pedestrian survey and deep testing. Subsurface testing
was concentrated in high probability areas defined by buried soils, channel proximity, and
well-drained surfaces. Subsurface tests included excavation of 341 shovel tests across the
project area. Cut banks and numerous fallen trees provided additional opportunities to inspect
the subsurface. Thirty-five deep tests explored subsurface sediments identified during shovel
testing and cutbank inspection as containing buried soils and/or having silty or sandy horizons.
The deep tests revealed paleosols in all parts of the project area and in or under each of the
mapped soil types. These paleosols were similar to soils that form in the lower parts of the
Brazos River floodplain in Fort Bend County today. Paleosols were reached in many of the
shovel tests and all of the deep tests. However, during this investigation, cultural remains or
features were not located within the project area. Investigations indicate that for much of the
later half of the Holocene, the project area lay in a dynamic low-floodplain setting with low
archaeological potential. Based on the results of this investigation, no further work is
warranted. HRA Gray & Pape recommends that no further archaeological work be required,
and that the project be cleared to proceed as currently planned.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
Between August and October of 2009, HRA Gray & Pape, LLC (HRA Gray & Pape), at the
request of Berg Oliver Associates, Inc. (Berg Oliver) and Sienna/ Johnson North, L.P.,
(Sienna/Johnson North), conducted intensive pedestrian archaeological investigations and
deep testing on approximately 162 hectares (400 acres) planned for construction of a
residential subdivision within the Sienna Plantation development (Figure 1). The goals of the
cultural resources survey were to determine if land altering activities required to complete this
project would affect any historic properties.
This intensive pedestrian survey and deep testing was conducted in order to comply with
United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) permitting requirements associated with
wetlands impacted during construction in the project area. The procedures to be followed by
the USACE to fulfill the requirements set forth in the National Historic Preservation Act
(NHPA), other applicable historic preservation laws, and Presidential directives as they relate
to the regulatory program of the USACE (33 CFR Parts 320-334) are articulated in the
Regulatory Program of the USACE, Part 325 - Processing of Department of the Army
Permits, Appendix C - Procedures for the Protection of Historic Properties. The project took
place entirely on private property; therefore a Texas Antiquities Permit was not required.
Fieldwork and reporting activities were completed with reference to state (the Texas Council
of Archeologists) and federal (NHPA) guidelines.

1.1 Project Description
The project area is located in Missouri City, Harris County, Texas. The 162 hectare (400 acre)
project area is irregularly shaped but can be seen as having four sides. The northern boundary
is the proposed right-of-way (ROW) for the Fort Bend Parkway. The eastern boundary is the
modern channel of Flat Bank Creek ending at the southern-most point of the creek. The
southern boundary starts at this southern-most point and follows the creek west past the
confluence with Steep Bank Creek to the southern terminus of the Gulf Coast Waste Disposal
Authority (GCA) canal. This canal forms the western boundary of the project area.
Sienna/Johnson North proposes building a residential subdivision on the property. Roads,
sidewalks, foundations, landscape modifications, and buried utilities and pipelines are the
most common disturbances of residential construction. In addition, a series of retaining and
aesthetic ponds will be constructed in the central part of the project area. A 4 to 5-acre park is
planned for the northeastern corner of the development and parkland will surround the ponds.
Sienna Parkway will enter the property across Flat Bank Creek at Fill Area 1. A planned
greenbelt will include the rest of the Flat Bank and Steep Bank Creek valleys.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING OF THE STUDY AREA
The project area is located within the upper Texas Gulf Coastal Plain and is depicted on the
Missouri City 7.5-minute quadrangle map (United States Geological Survey [USGS] 2002). It
is located within the Brazos River floodplain between the modern day Brazos River and its
ancestral channel, Oyster Creek (Figure 1). The floodplain is composed of low ridges, swales,
and oxbow lakes (Abbott 2001). Soils that characterize the area, including Brazoria clay, are
bottomland soils derived from recent alluvial deposition (Mowery et al. 1960). Flat Bank and
Steep Bank Creeks border the project area.
Although woodland species such as oak, pecan, hickory, and elm once populated the
floodplain, the entire project area has been modified in the past by clearing associated with
pecan production and ranching. Historic research suggests that much of the parcel was spared
from plowing. Although Flat Bank Creek was once lined with native riparian woodland
species including pecan, non-native pecan trees have been planted across the entirety of the
project area. Two pecan trees had been cut-down with a chain saw relatively recently. One
was estimated to have 75 rings and the second 110 rings. A dense forest of hackberry, elm,
and various oaks has grown up to surround the pecans on the western half of the project area.
The eastern part of the project area was maintained for pecan harvest until recent times
according to the former Schindler Ranch Manager Juan Garcia (personal communication
2009). However, cattle and horse ranching was practiced within the grove. Many historic
agricultural practices such as clearing and ranching frequently reduce or destroy the integrity
of near-surface prehistoric archeological deposits. These practices have decreased the potential
for significant cultural resources across much of the parcel.
The historic use of the parcel and the presence of floodplains and buried surfaces contribute to
the possibility that the project area contains historic and prehistoric resources. These resources
were anticipated to be located along waterways and paleochannels. Locations identifiable as
poorly drained or marshy are considered to have a low probability of use that would be
marked by material cultural remains. Historic drainage modifications including moving and
channelizing Flat Bank Creek have changed the basic geomorphologic processes affecting the
Project Area (Figure 2).

2.1 Geomorphology
The Texas Coastal Plain makes up part of the larger Gulf Coastal Plain, a low, level to gently
sloping region extending from Florida to Mexico. The Texas Coastal Plain reaches as far north
as the Ouachita uplift in Oklahoma, and as far west as the Balcones escarpment in central
Texas. The basic geomorphic characteristics of the Texas coast and associated inland areas,
which includes Fort Bend County, resulted from depositional conditions influenced by

the combined action of sea level changes from glacial advance in the northern portions of the
continent, and subsequent downcutting and variations in the sediment load capacity of the
regionâs rivers. Locally, Fort Bend County is underlain by relatively recent sedimentary rocks
and unconsolidated sediments ranging in age from the Miocene to Holocene (Abbott 2001;
Van Siclen 1991).
Although older geologic units have been identified in the region (see Abbott 2001; Barnes
1982; Van Siclen 1991), units relevant to the study of long-term human occupation in modernday Fort Bend County include the Beaumont Formation, generally believed to predate human
occupation in the region, the so-called âDeweyville Terracesâ, stratigraphically positioned
between the Beaumont and Recent deposits, and Recent deposits. Quaternary Alluvium
underlies the project area (Barnes 1982). These deposits are made up of clay, silt, and sand.
This includes stream channel, point bar, natural levee, back swamp, and mud flat deposits
(Barnes 1982). Gilgae, a succession of microbasins and microknolls in generally level areas or
microvalleys and microridges parallel to the slope are common microfeatures.
The date of deposition for the Deweyville Terraces is not known. However, Abbott (2001:16)
among others believes the north-south oriented terraces aggraded during the Late Pleistocene
from overbank deposition of rivers and streams including the ancient Brazos River prior to the
beginning of the Holocene. Abbott suggests that aggradation of this feature ended by
approximately 20,000 BP (Abbott 2001:106). However, meanders of rivers including the
Brazos cut valleys through these terraces regularly during the Holocene and then abandoned
them. This process leaves a large, flat, open, and well drained areas favored for campsites.
While all depositional facies other than channels have the potential to preserve archaeological
sites, behaviorally, human activity favors well drained, sandy channel-proximal localities over
floodbasin muds (Abbott 2001:126). Other Recent or Holocene deposits on the Gulf Plain
typically result from overbank flooding of extant streams, eolian transport including dune
formation, and infilling of marshes.
The project area is within a floodplain setting between the Brazos River and its ancestral
channel, Oyster Creek. The topographic setting resembles other localities in the vicinity where
deeply buried prehistoric archaeological sites have been found on paleosol surfaces. In this
area underlain by Holocene alluvium, paleosols are common and may be associated with
intact prehistoric archaeological resources particularly when proximal to a paleochannel
(Abbott 2001: table 2; Mowery et al. 1960; SSS NRCS USDA 2009).
The course and sedimentation of the Brazos River has a complex history. Channel avulsion is
documented to have occurred four times in the Holocene (Nordt and Waters 1995). The first
occurred at 8100 yr B.P., the second at 2500 yr B.P., another around 500 yr B.P., and the last
around 300 yr B.P. The depositional regime changed soon after the first avulsion after 8500 yr
B.P. and floodplain construction is dominated by vertical accretion until 4200 yr B.P. A
second period of vertical accretion occurs from 2500 to 1250 yr B.P. Nordt and Waters
(1995) postulate two major and three minor periods of soil formation in the floodplain
sequence. The two most developed soils formed from 4200 to 2500 yr B.P. and a less welldeveloped soil formed from around 1250 to 500 yr B.P.

2.2 Physiography
The project area falls within the Western Gulf subdivision of the Atlantic and Gulf Coast
physiographic province (Aronow 1992). Located between the modern channel and the
ancestral channel of the Brazos which now holds Oyster Creek, the project area is located
within the floodplain of the Brazos River. Alluvium deposited during the Holocene epoch by
the meandering river and other creeks and tributaries within the floodplain underlies the
project area (Barnes 1982). Topographic relief in the county is the result of downcutting of
sediments from fluvial action associated with the many rivers, bayous, and creeks. Major
drainages include Oyster Creek, Jones Creek, Big Creek, the Brazos River, and San Bernard
River. Oxbow lakes are common in the area. The low relief typically results in meandering
channels.
Multiple overlapping meander scars and abandoned channels are visible in current and historic
aerial photographs and topographic and sketch maps (Figure 2). Associated with each of these
are channel deposits, point bars, levees, and terraces and other partially eroded floodplain
features. The same complex patterns of overlapping channels, continues beneath the surface
for many meters. Many small drainages in the project area have been altered by farmers in the
county and several drainage ditches have been constructed in the project area. Flat Bank Creek
has clearly been altered and dredge piles are common along the bank. An abandoned channel
of Flat Bank Creek enters the project area from the northern boundary of the project about 415
meters (1364 feet) west of the northeastern corner. Heading almost due south for 1 kilometer
(3280 feet), the abandoned channel meets up with the modern channel at about the midway
point between the northern and the southern project boundaries. There are no obvious
topographical clues that indicate the path of the older channel from this point southward.
However, this channel is depicted in historic sketch maps by S.M. Farr from 1889 and 1890 as
the active channel (Figure 2) (Fort Bend County 1889, 1890). By overlaying these historic
maps on the current maps, it is clear that the 1890 channel crossed the peninsula-like
southeastern tip of the project area in a north-northeastern trending line from just east of the
confluence with the modern Flat Bank Creek channel to the fill area just south of the center of
the eastern boundary.
The accuracy of the 1890 sketch map is supported by a very close depiction of the Brazos
channel on the same maps (Texas General Land Office [GLO] Archives 1890). The 1938 (Orr
et al.) Fresno sheet of the Reclamation Department Map series shows the modern channel is
mapped as the active channel but also clearly marks the topographical remnants of the
northern part of the 1890 channel. The southern segment apparently lacked sufficient
topographical distinctness to be mapped. Differential vegetation patterns visible in modern
aerial photographs approximate the 1890 channel. Also shown on the 1938 Reclamation
Department Map is a large area of marsh that covers the western part of the project area. The
southeastern boundary of this marsh area coincides with the route of the 1890 creek channel.

The modern channel enters the property within an eastern bending oxbow of the Brazos River.
The stream is diverted by a dam that crosses the oxbow. The channel cuts through the natural
levee of the abandoned channel into what may be an older oxbow that bends back to the west
along the northern edge of a modern subdivision. Past the subdivision the channel leaves the
confines of the second oxbow and goes southeast in a relatively straight line. From this point
southward, no soils that commonly form along the margins of streams are present. Rather,
Brazoria clay, found on lower positions of the floodplain, is uninterrupted by the stream. The
stream in this area has formed a narrow deeply incised V-shaped valley. The bottom of this
recently cut valley is approximately 10-15 meters (30-45 feet) below the edge of the bank. It
has few, small, lower terraces. Large slumps are common along the steep valley walls, and
these probably formed the few lower terraces present. The stream continues in this form to the
southern-most point of the property and curves back to the northwest stopping at the
confluence with Steep Bank Creek.
A GCA canal forms the western boundary of the project area. This canal appears on 2002
aerial imagery but is not present on 1995 aerial imagery, providing a modern construction date
for the feature. The project area has two meander scars that are oxbows and are not part of the
modern Flat Bank Creek channel. Both are in the northern part of the project area and are
locations designated as high probability areas.

2.3 Soils
The topography of the area is relatively flat (see Figure 1). Soils that characterize the area are
bottomland soils derived from recent alluvial deposition (Mowery et al. 1960). The majority of
soils in the proposed project area are mapped as Brazoria clay. Minor amounts of Clemville
silty clay loam, Norwood silt loam and silty clay loam, and Sumpf clay are present in the
northern sections if the project area. Small amounts of Asa and Pledger soils are found
immediately adjacent the project area and are discussed below as well. Paleosols underlying
the recent deposits have been characterized as muddy bottomland soils. These paleosols can
resemble soils and paleosols described for soil series in the Miller-Norwood-Pledger
association. For example, Miller series soils elsewhere in Fort Bend County cap paleosols of
older prehistoric age such as the Asa and Buffalo paleosols described in the Texas Department
of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) section which was measured along the Brazos River near T.C.
Jester State Prison in Sugarland (see Abbott 2001: Figure 32).
Brazoria clay is a very deep, moderately well drained soil that formed in the clayey sediments
of the Brazos River flood plain (SSS NRCS USDA 2009). A typical profile consists of 165
centimeters (65 inches) of very hard, dark reddish brown clay. Concretions of calcium
carbonate are common throughout the profile. According to Abbott (2001), Brazoria soils
have a moderate to high potential for containing intact cultural deposits.
Clemville silty clay loam is a deep, well drained soil that formed from alluvium on nearly
level floodplains (SSS NRCS USDA 2009). A typical profile consists of 30 centimeters (12
inches) of dark brown silty clay loam Ap and A horizons, above a layer of stratified light
brown silt loam and reddish brown silty clay loam Bw horizon to a depth of 76 centimeters
(30 inches). These layers are underlain by a buried soil that consists of a 51 centimeters (20
8

inches) of dark brown silty clay Ab horizon followed by a layer of reddish brown silty clay Bb
horizon with bedding planes from 127 to 157 centimeters (50 to 62 inches), both with few
calcium carbonate concretions. According to Abbott (2001), Clemville soils have a very high
potential for containing intact cultural deposits.
According to the SSS NRCS USDA (2009), Norwood series soils are very deep, well drained,
moderately permeable soils typically formed in stratified, calcareous, loamy alluvium of
mixed origin on nearly level flood plains. They may occur on slopes as great as 8% along the
edges of natural drainages. They generally occur in occur in slightly lower positions than Asa
soils and closer to stream channels than Brazoria and Pledger series soils. Norwood soils
typically exhibit Ap-Bw-Bk-BC zonation. The Ap horizon is generally 0 to 51 centimeters (0
to 20 inches) thick and composed of light brown (7.5YR 6/4) loam in its upper portion and
brown (7.5YR 4/2) loam in its lower portion. The Bw-horizon is 10 to 66 centimeters (4 to 26
inches) thick yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam. The Bk horizon, where present, is
typically up to 51 centimeters (20 inches) thick reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) silt loam. There
can be 3 BC horizons including BC1 which is a 15 centimeter (6 inch) thick reddish yellow
(7.5YR 6/6) silt loam, BC2, a 10 centimeter (4 inch) thick light brown (7.5YR 6/4) silt loam,
and BC3 a 12 centimeter (5 inch) thick brown (7.5YR 5/4) silty clay loam. In addition, the Chorizons in these soils often have bedding planes at depths of 38 to 101 centimeters (15 to 40
inches), and buried soil horizons occurring at a depth of between 76 and 152 centimeters (30
to 60 inches).
This paleosol, commonly underlying Norwood soils, consists of a 15-centimeter (6-inch) thick
Ab horizon composed of brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay underlain by two Bwb horizons. The Bwb1
is approximately 24 centimeters (10 inches) thick and composed of light yellowish brown
(10YR 6/4) very fine sandy loam. The Bwb2 is approximately 43 centimeters (17 inches) thick
and composed of yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very fine sandy loam. Abbott (2001)
categorizes the geoarchaeological potential of the Norwood series as high.
According to the SSS NRCS USDA (2009), Pledger series soils are generally very deep,
moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils found on nearly level flood plains. The
soils formed from calcareous stratified clayey alluvium and typically exhibit Ap/A-Bss-BCs
horizonation. The combined thickness of the A horizons is 30 to 76 centimeters (12 to 30
inches) in thickness and is typically black (10YR 2/1) clay exhibiting moderate fine granular
and fine subangular blocky structure. This is underlain by two Bss horizons: Bss1, typically a
25-centimeter (10-inch) thick black (10YR 2/1) clay similar in structure to the A-horizon but
exhibiting common prominent slickensides and many pressure faces; and the Bss2, an
approximately 50-centimeter (20-inch) thick dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) clay that also can
contain a few pitted concretions of calcium carbonate. A clear wavy boundary separates the
Bss2 from the underlying BCss-horizon, which is an approximately 76-centimeter (30-inch)
thick reddish brown (5YR 4/3) clay with weak coarse prismatic structure. Distinct
slickensides, thin discontinuous strata of silt loam and silty clay and fine calcium carbonate
concretions are also present in this stratum.
Pledger series soils are often more than 2.03 meters (80 inches) thick and dark colored Abhorizons are common below depths of 1 meter (40 inches). Reaction is slightly alkaline or
moderately alkaline and strongly effervescent when dilute hydrochloric acid (HCl) is applied
to the soil. This is because Pledger soils formed in recent calcareous, reddish stratified clayey
9

and silty alluvium in floodplain positions that place them lower on the floodplain than Asa and
Norwood soils (Mowery et al. 1960). Abbott (2001) categorizes the geoarchaeological
potential of Pledger soils as moderate to high.
Sumpf clay is found in the northern portions of the project area and alongside Flat Bank Creek
in the northeast. This very poorly drained soil is found on oxbows in floodplains and is
frequently flooded. A typical soil profile consists of 41 centimeters (16 inches) of dark brown
clay with very dark grayish brown mottles followed by dark brown clay with medium faint
dark brown mottles to a depth of 71 centimeters (28 inches). These layers are followed by a
dark brown clay with yellowish red mottles from 71 to 152 centimeters (28 to 60 inches) and
finally a reddish brown clay to a depth of 191 centimeters (75 inches). This soil is regarded as
having moderate to high potential for containing intact cultural deposits (Abbott 2001).
According to the SSS NRCS USDA (2009), Asa series soils are very deep, well drained,
moderately permeable, nearly level to very gently sloping soils formed in loamy alluvium.
Typically, the Asa silty clay loam exhibits Ap/A-B/A-Bw-Bk-Bâw zonation and all pedons are
violently effervescent and moderately alkaline. The Ap-horizon is typically a 10 to 20
centimeter (4 to 8 inch) thick black (5YR 2.5/1) silty clay loam exhibiting moderate fine and
medium subangular blocky structure. It typically contains many very fine and fine roots, some
medium roots, and few fine pores and worm casts. In fact, the A and upper B horizons of most
Asa series pedons contain between 20 to 40% worm casts.
The underlying A-horizon is typically a 15 to 31 centimeter (6 to 12 inch) thick black (10YR
2/1) silty clay loam exhibiting moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate
medium subangular blocky structure. It contains few very fine to fine roots and fine pores and
is often identified by 5% vertically oriented 0.3-centimeter (1/8 inch) diameter worm holes
filled with brown worm casts. A 0 to 25-centimeter (0 to 10-inch) thick B/A horizon
sometimes underlies the A-horizon. The B/A is typically composed of brown (7.5YR 4/4) silty
clay loam and 40% of the overlying A horizon and exhibits weak coarse prismatic structure
parting to moderate medium subangular blocky structure. A few fine roots, common very fine
and fine pores, and wormholes similar but larger to those in the A-horizon are typical of the
stratum. Very fine mica flakes are also common.
Two Bw horizons are typical of the Asa series. The Bw1 horizon is approximately 20centimeters (8-inches) thick and composed of brown (5YR 4/4) silty clay loam and
approximately 15% dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) material derived from the A-horizon. It exhibits
weak coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium and fine subangular blocky
structure, few fine roots, common fine and medium pores, approximately 2% fine pitted
calcium carbonate nodules, and worm casts and mica flakes as those found in the B/A horizon.
The Bw2 horizon is approximately 15-centimeters (6-inches) thick and composed of brown
(7.5YR 4/4) silty clay loam generally similar to the Bw1 horizon. The combined thickness of
the Bw horizon can range from 25 to 150 centimeters (10 to 60 inches).
The Bk horizon is 0 to 50 centimeters (0 to 20-inches) thick and composed of brown (7.5YR
4/4) silty clay loam containing a few reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) and yellowish red (5YR 4/6)
redox concentrations. It exhibits weak coarse prismatic structure, contains few fine roots, very
10

fine and fine pores and films, threads, and masses of calcium carbonate. There are more
calcium carbonate nodules (roughly 5%) and the worm holes are typically larger than
overlying strata (up to 1.2 centimeters [1/2 inch] in diameter).
Four loamy Bw-horizons are described in the type pedon. The Bw1 horizon is approximately
28 centimeters (11-inches) thick and composed of brown (7.5YR 4/4) and reddish brown
(5YR 4/3) silt loam containing common fine and medium faint brown (7.5YR 5/4) redox
concentrations and exhibiting moderate coarse prismatic structure. The Bw2 horizon is
approximately 31-centimeters (12-inches) thick and composed of reddish brown (5YR 4/4) silt
loam exhibiting moderate coarse prismatic structure. The Bw3 horizon is approximately 25centimeters (10-inches) thick and composed of brown (7.5YR 5/4) silt loam containing a few
fine faint strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) redox concentrations and exhibiting weak coarse
prismatic structure. It typically also contains a few medium pitted calcium carbonate nodules.
The Bw4 horizon is approximately 22-centimeters (9-inches) thick and composed of reddish
brown (5YR 4/4) silty clay loam with a few fine faint reddish brown (5YR 5/4) redox
concentrations, exhibiting weak coarse prismatic structure. All of the Bw-horizons typically
contain few fine roots, many fine and medium pores, and 5% wormholes similar to those in
the Bw horizons. The Bw1 horizon contains snail shell fragments and along with Bw2 horizon
may also contain brown very thin coatings on faces of prisms. The combined thickness of the
Bw horizon is between 0 and 152 centimeters (0 and 60 inches).
It should also be noted that some Asa pedons have a buried A horizon at a depth of 152 to 203
centimeters (60 to 80 inches) (SSS NRCS USDA 2009). Mowery et al. (1960:5-6) does not
report on paleosols associated with the Asa series in Fort Bend County. However, Abbott
(2001:106-126) and other sources (Kuehn 1997; Mason and Dering 2002; Miller et al. 2000)
report âAsaâ and other older paleosols (e.g. Buffalo) along the Brazos River and its tributaries
in Fort Bend County. Abbott regards the Asa soil as having a high geoarchaeological
potential.

2.4 Climate
Fort Bend Countyâs close proximity to the Gulf of Mexico tends to influence the temperature,
rainfall, and relative humidity of the region. Winds usually trend from the southeast or east,
except during winter months when high-pressure systems can bring in polar air from the north.
Average temperatures in the summer can reach well into the 90s (degrees Fahrenheit), and are
often accompanied by equally high humidity. Although winter temperatures can reach into the
low 30s (degrees Fahrenheit), below freezing temperatures usually occur on only a few days
out of every year, and are typically restricted to the early morning hours.
Rainfall is even throughout the year, with an average monthly distribution ranging from
between 43 centimeters (17 inches) to trace amounts; rainfall comes primarily from
thunderstorms, which tend to be heavy but of short duration (Wheeler et al. 1976). Daniel
Shipman (1965) reports that during at least one summer in the 1820s the Brazos was reduced
to a series of waterholes with no flow.

11

2.5 Flora and Fauna
Fort Bend County lies at the southwestern boundary of the Austroriparian biotic province as
defined by Blair (1950). Native vegetation specific to the region occurs near the modern
project area. The project area is situated in the Upland Prairies and Woods subregion of the
Gulf Coast Prairies and Marshes Region (Abbott 2001). Evidence from pollen analysis in
Central Texas suggests that, at least during the Late Pleistocene, the area may have been
populated by vegetative species that were tolerant of a cold weather environment. Climactic
fluctuation during the Holocene would eventually result in a gradual trend towards warmer
weather, similar to that seen today (Abbott 2001).
Late Pleistocene flora may have included populations of spruce, poplar, maple, and pine
(Holloway 1997), in an oak woodland environment that would eventually transition to an oak
savanna in the late Holocene (Abbott 2001). Fauna during this time would include currently
present species such as white-tailed deer and various smaller game, as well as bison, and, in
localized areas, pronghorn sheep and the American alligator (Abbott 2001).
The modern vegetative community associated with this region consists of a diverse collection
of primarily deciduous trees and undergrowth (Abbott 2001). Modern land alteration
activities, especially those associated with agriculture, have resulted in the removal of some
native plant species from the area. Identified trees may include water oak, pecan, various elms,
cedar, oaks, sweetgum, and mulberry, to name a few. Honeysuckle, dewberry, yaupon, and
blackberry are common, as are indiangrass and bluegrasses (Abbott 2001).
The modern faunal community includes mammals such as deer, squirrel, opossum, raccoon,
skunk and various small rodents, numerous bird species, and reptiles including the Texas rat
snake, the western cottonmouth, the kingsnake, and turtle species. Species seen during the
survey include white tailed deer, feral hogs, armadillo, red tailed hawk, owl, and copperhead
snake. Black bear and bison were present occasionally in the past (Abbott 2001). Daniel
Shipman (1965), son of Moses Shipman, reported in his book that he had shot leopard and on
a separate occasion, several black bears in a single day. He also reported witnessing vast herds
of bison in the vicinity.

3.0 CULTURAL SETTING
3.1 Prehistoric Setting
Traditionally, Southeast Texas has been viewed as a buffer zone between cultural regions in
prehistoric times. Patterson (1995) describes the archaeological record in this area as being an
interface between the Southern Plains and the Southeast Woodlands. Along similar lines, both
Shafer (1975) and Aten (1984) have categorized the Post-Archaic archaeological record of this
region as Woodland. This categorization is not meant to literally invoke the exact cultural
patterns and chronology of the Woodlands culture found to the east. Aten (1984:74)
summarizes his concept by saying, âit loosely connotes activities by populations on a
geographic as well as a cultural periphery of the southeastern Woodlands.â
Dee Ann Story (1990) has suggested that the culture of Southeast Texas is distinctive enough
so as to merit a separate designation by the Late Prehistoric. The Mossy Grove cultural
tradition is a heuristic concept based on technological similarities shared by groups in this
region. The primary marker of this technological tradition is the plain, sandy-paste Goose
Creek pottery that is found in this region from the Early Ceramic through Early Historic
periods.
Ethnic affiliations for the region are not entirely clear. Aten (1983) has defined the Brazos
Delta-West Bay, Galveston Bay, and Sabine Lake archaeological areas and suggests that they
may correlate with the Historic territories of the Coco, Akokisa, and Atakapa groups
respectively. Similarly, historic reconstructions of the inland subregion suggest a number of
possible group affiliations (Story 1990). The historic economic inland/coastal cycle of the
Akokisa, which stretched from Galveston Bay to the San Jacinto River basin, may mean that
archaeological materials in the Lake Conroe area are affiliated with this group. Alternately,
these remains may be associated with the Bidais who occupied territory immediately to the
north of the Akokisa groups. At this point in time it is not possible to identify the cultural
affiliation of the groups that inhabited the inland subregion. In part, this is a function of the
dynamic nature of this region in which a number of cultural traditions met and diffused.
The Southeast Texas region is divided into inland and coastal margin subregions, which have
archaeologically distinctive subsistence patterns, settlement patterns, and artifact types.
Archaeological and historic evidence suggests that some groups exploited inland resources
year round, while other groups spent parts of the year both inland and on the coast.
3.1.1 Prehistoric Archaeological Time Periods
Based on aspects of material culture, researchers have identified six archaeological time
periods associated with Native Americans in southeast Texas; in general, these include the
Paleoindian, Archaic (with Early, Middle, and Late subdivisions), Ceramic, Late Prehistoric,
Protohistoric, and Historic Indian. Archaeologists within the region agree on the general
framework of cultural time periods, while disagreeing on the temporal boundaries of these
periods. Pattersonâs (1995) chronology, for example, includes Early Paleoindian (10,000-8000
13

B.C.), Late Paleoindian (8000-5000 B.C.), Early Archaic (5000-3000 B.C.), Middle Archaic
(3000-1500 B.C.), Late Archaic (1500 B.C.-A.D. 100), Early Ceramic (A.D. 100-A.D. 600),
Late Prehistoric (A.D. 600-1500), Protohistoric (A.D. 1500-1700), and the Historic Indian
(A.D. 1700-1800) periods. In contrast, Ensor (1990) offers a Southeast Texas chronology that
includes Paleoindian (10,000-8000 B.C.), Early Archaic (8000-5000 B.C.), Middle Archaic
(5000-1000 B.C.), Late Archaic (1000 B.C.-A.D. 400), Early Ceramic (A.D. 400-A.D. 800),
and Late Ceramic (A.D. 800-A.D. 1750). Despite these differences, the chronologies
developed by researchers are based primarily on changes in projectile point technologies
within the region and the introduction of pottery. It is generally recognized that a broad-based
hunting and gathering lifestyle was utilized throughout all time periods.

3.2 Historic Setting
3.2.1

Fort Bend County History

Fort Bend County was established on December 29, 1837 from parts of Austin, Brazoria, and
Harrisburg counties. Richmond, which had been incorporated in May of that same year, was
voted the county seat by the citizens of the new county. The area was originally settled in the
1820s as part of the Spanish colonial government land grant to Moses Austin, father of
Stephen F. Austin. After his fatherâs death and the conclusion of the Mexican Civil War,
Stephen F. Austin renegotiated the deal with the new Mexican government. Now a province of
Mexico, the 1823 Imperial Colonization Law allowed an empresario to receive a land grant.
The empresario, Stephen F. Austin, and a governor appointed commissioner were authorized
the distribute land to settlers. The only land settled under this law was the Old 300. This law
was actually annulled in March of 1823 as a result of the abdication of the Mexican Emperor
Iturbide. The succeeding provisional government issued a special decree allowing Austin's
first colony in April 1823 under the terms of the annulled law. Of the 297 original grants, 53
of them were situated in the future Fort Bend County (Ott 2009).
In 1821, the schooner Lively sailed from New Orleans and anchored at the mouth of the
Brazos River with the first contingent of Stephen F. Austinâs settlers. A small party from this
group continued 145 kilometers (90 miles) up the Brazos to a bend in the river. In November
of 1822, a blockhouse was built at this location to protect the settlers from hostile Indians.
Other settlers followed and a small community that came to be referred to as Fort Bend grew
around the blockhouse. Fort Bend was located at one of the primary fords of the Brazos River
and as such played a role in the troop movements during the Texas Revolution. The Site was
abandoned when Santa Annaâs Mexican Army crossed the river in route to the battle of San
Jacinto. When the area was resettled the new community of Richmond was established
(Leffler 2009).
Richmond became a regional trade center in the following decades, with barges and
steamboats carrying the cotton, corn, and sugar produced in the region down the Brazos to
Galveston (Leffler 2009). In 1853, the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos, and Colorado Railway proved a
further boon to business connecting Stafford Point to Harrisburg. African slaves were essential
to the plantation economy of region and by the 1850s outnumbered the white inhabitants of
the county. Because of this economic reality, Fort Bend planters strongly supported the
14

Southern secession and the Civil War (Ott 2009).
The final quarter of the nineteenth century witnessed a steady increase in the settlement and
population of the county. Immigrants from Central Europe including Czechs, Germans,
Austrians, and Bohemians established prosperous small farms on the lands once held by the
large plantations. A number of settlements arose along the rail lines that stretched across the
entire county. One such community, Rosenberg, grew at the junction were the Colorado and
Santa Fe line crossed the Galveston, Harrisburg, and San Antonio line three miles west of
Richmond. Rosenberg would grow to be the predominant town in the county surpassing
Richmond in population in 1920 (Ott 2009).
The economy of Fort Bend in the nineteenth century focused on cotton, sugar, corn, and
livestock production. In the 1890s, a one million dollar sugar refinery was constructed in
Sugar Land. The county also contains substantial amounts oil, gas, and sulfur deposits, which
have played a major role in the economic development of area (Ott 2009).
The current project area is a proposed development within the modern community of Sienna
Plantation and is situated on land originally granted to Old Three Hundred colonists Moses
Shipman and Thomas Barnett. In 1850, Daniel Shipman (son of Moses Shipman) sold the
property to relatives Samuel and Dorsey Mason. The Shipman heirs owned the property until
1912. D. A. Japhet purchased the property at a public auction that year and the following year
sold the property or a half interest in the property to Mary âMammieâ Fabj. It was most
recently owned by the Schindler family.
Moses Shipman was born in North Carolina and moved to Texas in 1822. In 1824, he received
title to a league in present day Fort Bend County and land in present day Austin County. He
eventually settled on Oyster Creek, 20 miles from present day Richmond in 1825. The census
of 1826 listed him and his wife, Mary, as living with their eight children, although he would
eventually be the father of ten. One of his sons, Daniel Shipman, would publish a memoir of
his early life in 1879 entitled Frontier Life, 58 Years in Texas. For the Convention of 1836,
Moses was president of the election to choose that conventions delegates (Handbook of Texas
Online 2009).
Also in 1836, as Antonio LÃ³pez de Santa Annaâs army was approaching the Fort Bend County
area, the Shipman family and their neighbors joined the Runaway Scrape to escape the
Mexican advance. The Runaway Scrape was a termed used to describe the abandonment of the
settlers homes in the face of the advancing Mexican army (Covington 2009). Shipman and his
family decided to return home after receiving news of victory at the battle of San Jacinto and
found their property and cattle destroyed by the Mexican army. The exact date of his death is
not known (Handbook of Texas Online 2009).
Thomas Barnett settled on his league with his wife Nancy after 1824. The 1826 census listed
two slaves in the Barnett household. Barnett went on to become a signatory of the Texas
Declaration of Independence in 1836, and served as a Fort Bend County representative in the
congress of 1838 to 1840 (Kemp 2009).

4.0 PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Prehistoric archaeological sites identified in the inland regions of the Gulf Coastal Plain tend
to be composed of ephemeral, shallow deposits. Typically, these sites consist of temporally
non-diagnostic lithic scatters, thin subsurface deposits, or suggest the presence of multiple
cultural components within a mixed context. Historic sites near the project area typically
consist of farms or homesteads dating to the late nineteenth or early twentieth centuries.
The majority of larger inland sites consist of sandy middens with high lithic material counts
and moderate amounts of pottery located near water sources. These sites are generally
considered base camps and there is a notable absence of satellite activity areas. Distinct
activity loci are present within the base camps (Patterson 1995).
Lithic artifacts recovered at sites near the current project area are primarily manufactured from
chert and petrified wood. Chert deposits are concentrated in the western portion of the south
Texas region, while petrified wood dominates in the eastern portion of the region. This
geographic parity is generally reflected in the types of materials found at sites. Sites in the
western and central portions of south Texas have predominately chert artifacts with some
petrified wood. Conversely, artifacts recovered from sites in the eastern portion of south Texas
are mainly manufactured of petrified wood (Patterson 1995). Extra-local lithic materials found
in the region include Edwards Plateau chert and ground stone from Arkansas sources. The
presence of these materials may suggest the presence of regional trade networks or the
movement of groups or individuals into the region, as in the case of the Edwards Plateau
material.
Inland sites have a high debitage to core ratio suggesting that primary reduction most often
was carried out at source locations. Patterson (1995) suggested that the presence of point
preforms in various stages of production and failure at campsites indicate that blanks and
preforms were being transported back to these locations for final reduction. The unifacial tools
found at sites are typically flakes utilized from the bifacial thinning process. These tool types
include scrapers, denticulates, notched tools, perforators, and gravers. These formal tools
occur only in small numbers at inland sites.
Projectile point types, along with ceramics on the coastal margin, are the most distinctive
artifacts associated with archaeological sites in southeast Texas. The various types serve as
hallmarks of the cultural periods of the region. These types range from the Clovis and Folsom
points made in the Paleoindian period, to the dart points of the Archaic including La Jita, to
the dart points such as Lange of Late Archaic/Early Ceramic, and finally to the arrow points of
the Late Prehistoric (ca. A.D. 500 or 600). Adjacent regions through time including the
southern plains, southeast woodlands, Louisiana, and north, central, and south Texas
influenced the projectile point technologies found in the region.
Most sites near the coast between the Brazos River and Sabine Lake consist of middens of
clams found in estuaries or exposed in cutbanks along streams (Aten 1983; Patterson 1995).
These middens usually contain faunal material as well as cultural remains such as lithic tools
and pottery. Inland sites are less likely to consist of middens and are more similar to
16

generalized open campsites. In both areas, sites are found near stream channels. A brief
overview of selected research projects conducted near the present undertaking is presented
below.
Addicks Reservoir was one of the earliest projects conducted in the area (Wheat 1953). The
research done during that project initialized the formation of the Galveston Bay Focus and the
development of a cultural sequence of the region based on lithics and ceramics (Aten 1983).
The cultural context of the upper coastal region is described by Aten (1983) and Story (1990).
This information is merged with the archaeological data here to give a complete picture of life
on the Upper Texas Coast.
In 1987-88, Espey, Huston & Associates conducted an intensive block survey covering
property just south of Old Oyster Creek as well as several hundred acres to the east. The
survey included the excavation of several deep test trenches in an effort to locate buried
cultural deposits. During the course of this survey several historic sites were identified
including Site 41FB143, 41FB144, 41FB145, 41FB146, 41FB147, 41FB148, 41FB149,
41FB150, 41FB151, 41FB152, 41FB153, 41FB154, 41FB155, 41FB156, 41FB157, and
41FB158. In general, these sites were composed of surface scatters containing low-fired brick
fragments and shallow subsurface deposits consisting of various glass fragments, bits of tin
and metal from roofs, and unidentified metal machine fragments. Although none of these sites
were recommended for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), Espey,
Huston, & Associates made recommendations for â1. additional survey; 2. testing of the
historic Waters Plantation homesite, if the site cannot be avoided by all primary and secondary
development; 3. field location of the historic âNegroâ church and the ânewâ T. W. House
sugarhouse; 4.archival research of historic cemeteries; and 5. development of an historic
preservation plan for the existing Waters/House sugar mill structuresâ (Voellinger et al.
1988:22).
Lockwood, Andrews & Newman, Inc. conducted geoarchaeological investigations in 1997 at
the proposed site of a wastewater treatment plant near Steep Bank Creek in Fort Bend County,
Texas. During deep trenching associated with the original survey, bone, and mussel shell were
observed in one of three backhoe trenches excavated on the low terrace of Steep Bank Creek.
Additional geoarchaeological testing of the site was conducted by Kuehn (1997) to determine
the origin and depositional context of these materials. That investigation resulted in the
recovery of minor quantities of lithic debitage and additional mussel shell and bone from a
fauna-rich stratum lying between a Miller series A-Bw soil profile and an A-C zoned paleosol
at depths of approximately 50 to 75 centimeters (20 to 30 inches). The site was given the
trinomial 41FB253 and was recommended for Phase II evaluative testing (Kuehn 1997).
The Center for Ecological Archaeology reinvestigated Site 41FB253 in November 2002
(Mason and Dering 2002). Phase II testing at Site 41FB253 consisted of the excavation of 38
power auger probes and one 2 meter by 2 meter (6 feet by 6 feet) excavation unit excavated as
four individual 1 meter by 1 meter (3 feet by 3 feet) test units. The excavations produced 483
sherds of Goose Creek ware, 2 projectile points, 3 other chipped stone tools, and 231
fragments of lithic debitage. A large faunal assemblage consisting largely of mussel shell and
fish bone dominated by gar, but also containing deer bone, turtle shell, bird bone, and one
17

rabbit tooth was also recovered from the site. In addition, 17 bone artifacts including 2
decorated bone fragments possibly from a flageolet were also recovered. Many of the faunal
material recoveries and all of the bone artifacts were from a midden, which was the only
cultural feature identified at the site.
The midden and other cultural materials were all associated with the approximately 20 to 25
centimeter (8 to 10 inches) thick stratum lying between the base of what appears to be an up to
1.7-meter (5-foot) thick Miller series soil profile developed on clay sediment and the top of a
very dark clay paludal deposit interpreted as a still pond. The diagnostic artifacts and a
radiocarbon date resulted in the site being interpreted as a single occupation temporary
campsite dating to the Late Prehistoric. The site was recommended for inclusion in the NRHP.
The investigators also noted that deeper cultural deposits might underlie the paludal deposit;
however they cautioned that preservation conditions at the site were likely to be generally
poor due to the shrink-swell action of clays (Mason and Dering 2002).
SWCA (Miller et al. 2000) detected materials similar to those described at 41FB253 at the Gar
Scale Site (41FB289) on the opposite bank of Steep Bank Creek. The site, which is estimated
to be approximately 1600 square meters (17,220 square feet) in size, was detected in the Asa
paleosol on a low terrace of Steep Bank Creek during backhoe testing associated with
archaeological investigation of the Sugarland Ranch levee and retention pond areas.
Prehistoric artifacts recovered included 16 plainware pottery sherds. In addition, four gar scale
fragments, one freshwater mussel shell fragment, and bone fragments were found concentrated
with the ceramics in several test trenches at approximately 70 centimeters (27 inches) depth
below ground surface over a 200 meter by 80 meter (656 feet by 262 feet) area along the right
(west) bank of Steep Bank Creek. The site was interpreted as a Late Prehistoric open campsite
that may be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. A total 2843 meters (1.77 miles) of Steep
Bank Creek and its tributaryâs banks have been surveyed and this site and the adjacent Site
41FB253 are the only prehistoric sites recorded (Miller et al. 2002).
In 1984 and 1985, the USACE surveyed a block that included a significant portion of the
northern-most tributary of Flat Bank Creek. Two prehistoric sites (41FB99 and 41FB107)
were recorded on high spots on the lowest terrace. These are the only prehistoric sites on Flat
Bank Creek or its tributaries recorded on the THC Atlas (Good 1985a, 1985b).
The THC archives provide only geographic data concerning the location of Sites 41FB273,
41FB274, 41FB275, and 41FB276. However, during the most recent archaeological survey in
the area, which was conducted by HRA Gray & Pape (Hughey et al. 2004) in preparation for a
temporary bridge crossing across Oyster Creek, it was noted that the four sites are historic (see
Hughey et al. 2004:table 1). Fieldwork for HRA Gray & Papeâs project (see Hughey et al.
2004) consisted of survey of a 0.08-hectare (0.2-acre) section of Old Oyster Creek in May
2004. Historic site 41FB292 was discovered during the course of the survey. The site was
composed of historic artifacts located primarily within the top 20 centimeters (8 inches) below
the surface. Artifacts included low-fired brick fragments, glass, square nails, and metal
fragments. This site was not recommended for inclusion in the NRHP (Hughey et al. 2004).
Approximately 283 hectares (700 acres) in Fort Bend County south of the current project area
18

was also investigated by HRA Gray & Pape. However, work on this project is also ongoing
and HRA Gray & Pape has not made any recommendations at this time. Soils and paleosols
encountered during this survey generally conformed to profiles of low floodplain MillerPledger-Roebuck association soils and included dark reddish brown and reddish brown Miller
clay at shallow depths (SSS USDA NRCS 2009). These were underlain by a fairly widespread
Pledger-like paleosol, which was often underlain by partially eroded, discontinuous older
paleosols most closely resembling Pledger and other low floodplain soils of the MillerPledger-Roebuck association.
In a report for the Natchez multi-use development, Voellinger et al. (1988) cite several large
surveys that were completed within the Lower Brazos River floodplain and note that no
prehistoric sites had been found during these significant surveys. The Natchez survey also
reported that no sites were found in the floodplain. Since that time only a few prehistoric sites
have been found in the floodplain of the Brazos River.

5.0 METHODS
5.1 Site File and Literature Review
Background and site file research was initiated prior to fieldwork mobilization. Background
literature search included a review of both archaeological site files and architectural resource
files and a review of previously conducted cultural resource surveys in the vicinity. This
information was obtained by reviewing records through the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
(maintained by the THC) and historic maps including historic sketch maps maintained by
Brazoria County, and Reclamation Department maps purchased online. As part of the literature
search, HRA Gray & Pape created a table to document previously completed surveys located
within a 1.6-kilometer (1 mile) radius of the project area. Cultural resources identified during this
literature search included previously recorded archaeological sites and previously conducted
cultural resources surveys

5.2 Field Methods
Field investigation on this project consisted of intensive pedestrian survey (a combination of
walkover reconnaissance and shovel testing), inspection of tree falls, and deep testing
consisting of trenching supplemented by cutbank inspection. The selection of deep test
locations was influenced by the results of pedestrian survey and shovel testing.
5.2.1 Intensive Pedestrian Survey
Archaeological survey methods utilized during the intensive pedestrian survey consisted of
observation point survey. Observation points provide a reference to maintain horizontal control
and provenience across a given survey area. In general, these observation points are positioned at
30-meter (100-foot) intervals in areas considered to possess high probability for containing
cultural materials and at wider intervals in low-potential areas. Regardless of the interval, linear
transects were utilized for the positioning of the observation points across the specific survey
area. Dependent upon the terrain, environmental setting, and groundcover identified at each
observation point location, one of two possible actions (surface inspection or subsurface testing)
was performed. All actions performed at a specific observation point location, the general
observations of the surveyor, and the results of survey actions were recorded on an observation
point log, which include provenience, survey method, and cultural materials identified.
Transects were spaced 30 meters (100 feet) apart across the entire project area and aligned
according to physical features recognizable in the field. Locating transects in this manner
allowed field crews to more easily find their position on field maps. The thick forest and flat
topography made global positioning system (GPS) signals unreliable and topographic maps
easily misunderstood. Each survey area received a unique lettered âBlockâ designation. A
second lettered designation indicated each transectâs position on a roughly east â west axis and
a number indicating its relative north â south position within each transect. The entire property
was pedestrian surveyed under this methodology. Shovel test excavation was guided by a
stratified selection process that targeted higher probability areas with 30-meter (100-foot)
20

spaced tests but provided regularly spaced tests from 60 to 120 meters (197 to 394 feet) in the
lower probability areas. Some lower probability areas were subjected only to judgmental tests
after extensive testing in similar areas produced negative findings. One wall of each shovel
test was profiled and the walls and floor of each test were inspected for color or texture change
potentially associated with the presence of cultural features. Where matrix clay content and
density did not facilitate screening, back dirt was hand sorted in an effort to locate artifacts.
In floodplains and low terrace settings, water sometimes cuts near-vertical scarps, called
cutbanks, along stream channels that expose underlying stratigraphy. Such areas often have
little or no vegetation covering them and offer opportunities for cutbank inspection to evaluate
the underlying soil profile. Cutbank inspection associated with this project consisted of
examining the composition of strata (e.g. soil, alluvium), erosional features (slumps,
cutbanks), vegetation, and the presence of cultural remains exposed in cutbanks along Flat
Bank Creek and its artificial and natural tributaries. The scarp or cutbank was scraped with a
trowel or flat shovel to reveal underlying stratigraphy. The stratigraphy was compared with
existing descriptions of local soils and sediments (see Abbott 2001:106-123; Mowery et. al.
1960, SSS NRCS USDA 2009).
Trenching consists of excavating test trenches with a backhoe to characterize the deposits and
prospect for buried sites. Test trenches typically measure 5 meters (16 feet) in length, up to 1
meter (3 feet) wide at the base, and are generally limited to a depth of approximately 2.8
meters (9 feet) due to the reach of the backhoe. They are excavated using a flat bladed bucket
that acts much as a âgiant trowelâ to scrape thin layers of soil at a time when possible. Deeper
tests required toothed buckets to cut through thick levels of clay. During trenching, the walls
and floor of the trench are monitored during each pass of the bucket. If any signs of cultural
materials are observed, the backhoe bucket is immediately removed from the trench and the
trench floor (if the trench is safe to enter) is shovel scraped and or troweled by hand to expose
artifacts or features. In addition, soil samples from the excavation backfill pile are screened or
hand sifted as if they were shovel test samples.
When trench excavation is complete, one wall of each trench is profiled and the walls and
floor of each trench are inspected for color or texture change potentially associated with the
presence of cultural features. All trench excavations are conducted in compliance with
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) excavation safety guidelines. An
OSHA Certified Competent Person decides if trenches can or cannot be entered, or if they
need to be benched, shored or otherwise secured for safety before being entered for closer
inspection. If no cultural materials are detected in potentially unsafe trenches, they are not
entered but studied from the surface.
Soil profiles observed in all shovel tests and trenches were described using tested approaches
for describing basic soil properties (see Munsell 2000; Schoeneberger et al. 2002; Vogel
2002). Comparisons of soil profiles observed in the field were made to the soil series type
section descriptions available in SSS NRCS USDA (2009) and Mowery et al. (1960).

5.3 Definition of High Probability Areas
The historic use of the parcel and the presence of floodplains and buried surfaces contribute to
the possibility that the project area contains historic and prehistoric resources. These resources
were anticipated to be located along waterways and paleochannels (Figure 2). Abbott (2001)
among many others accepts a cultural preference for areas with sandy well-drained soils that
are adjacent to channels. Without extensive field study, the location of paleochannels within
the Brazos River floodplain can only be surmised by surface indications and these only
provide evidence of paleochannels that have not been deeply buried by later deposition.
Levees, low terraces, and well-drained surfaces in general were identified in research as
culturally preferred site locations. Locations identifiable as poorly drained or swampy in the
present or recent past are considered to have a low probability of use that would be marked by
material cultural remains. Some of these areas were recognizable from topographic and soil
maps, and surface observations, but others required shovel testing to reveal the depositional
environment.
Soils maps depicted areas of soils that form in oxbows and on low ridges adjacent to channels.
Topographic maps added detail to landforms identifiable by soil types such as the
paleochannel in the northeastern part of the project area. Loamy, silty, and sandy deposits
were associated with soil types mapped along this feature. During the course of fieldwork, it
became evident that this abandoned channel was, in the past, the main channel of Flatbank
Creek. Additional research proved that this was the channel of Flat Bank Creek as recently as
1890 (Fort Bend County 1890, GLO Archives 1890). This combination of soil type and
proximity to the channel made the northern segment of the 1890s channel a main target of
investigation.
Four high probability areas were determined based on soil types and proximity to channels.
High Probability Area (HPA) 1 is a 100 meters (328 foot) wide strip of land extending along
the entire bank of the modern Flat Bank Creek channel within the project area. Additionally,
the interior of the second (southern) oxbow currently holding the main channel of Flat Bank
Creek in the northeastern corner of the project area is part of this HPA. High Probability Area
2 is the area surrounding and including the northern segment of the 1890 Flat Bank Creek
channel. High Probability Area 3 is the area surrounding and including an obvious oxbow
located in the north central part of the project area. High Probability Area 4 is the area
surrounding and including an oxbow identified by soil types in the northwestern corner of the
project area.
High Probability Area 1 subsumes the entire eastern margin and the Flat Bank Creek portion
of the southern margin of the project area. This area was chosen on the basis of proximity to
Flat Bank Creek and the assumption that sandy and silty deposits were likely associated with
levee and terraces of the creek and other streams that have followed this same channel prior to
the modern stream. Most of this HPA is underlain by Brazoria clay, however, in the
northeastern corner Sumpf and Norwood series soils are mapped. The highest probability
exists in the northeastern part of the HPA in floodplain sediments likely related to former
channels of the Brazos River. Initial fieldwork along the southern half of the modern creek
22

channel suggested that the channel was very recent. Additional background research
demonstrated that the entire channel was west of the modern course as recently as 1890 (Fort
Bend County 1890, GLO Archives 1890). The northern half of the modern channel is now
within an abandoned channel, probably, of the Brazos.
High Probability Area 2 is the northern segment of the 1890 channel of Flat Bank Creek.
Before fieldwork, this area was recognized as an abandoned channel based on soil types and
extents. As explained above, the recognition of the new channel being very recent led to
additional research that showed the course of the 1890 channel. The northern segment was
considered high probability and the southern segment was tentatively considered a part of
HPA 1. The highest probability is along the margins of the paleochannel in what would have
been the bank, floodplain, and natural levee.
High Probability Area 3 is centered on an obvious oxbow that remains lower than the
surrounding soils and is vegetated with grass and low shrubs with few trees. The highest
probability is along the margins in what would have been the bank, floodplain, and natural
levee.
High Probability Area 4 is an abandoned channel in the northwestern corner of the project area
recognized only by soils types and shapes. This HPA is the area of mapped Sumpf and Pledger
clays although these tend to be muddy surfaces. However, the presence of Asa Silty clay loam
on the western margin suggested levee or low terrace sandy or silty deposits may exist on the
eastern margin (SSS NCRS USDA 2009). The highest probability is along the margins of the
channel.

6.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS
Background and site file research including a review of both archaeological site files and
architectural resource files and a review of previously conducted cultural resource surveys in
the vicinity found that no sites were recorded in the project area or the study radius. Several
cultural resource surveys have been completed within the study radius (Table 1). No sites,
features, or isolated artifacts were found during any part of the survey. All plate photograph
locations are denoted on Figure 3. Plates 1 through 16 depict typical conditions within the
property. These are presented in Appendix A.

6.1 Site File and Literature Review
Site file research was conducted at Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) and
supplemented by consulting online research archives maintained by the THC. The goal of the
research efforts was to produce a listing of all archaeological sites within 1.6 kilometers (1
mile) of the project area and all historic structures eligible for NRHP listing located within or
immediately adjacent to the project area. Sites recorded on similar soils and landforms outside
the 1.6-kilometer (1 mile) study radius of the project area were also studied to help in
modeling cultural resource distribution.
Studies of aerial imagery and topographic maps (Mowery et al. 1960, USGS 1955, 1980,
1995, 2002) and of historic sketch maps (Fort Bend County 1889 and 1890, Orr et al. 1938)
and documents were conducted as part of this project in an effort to identify possible historical
structures and to assess historic and recent land use in the project area.
Cultural resources identified during the literature search included previously recorded
archaeological sites and previously conducted cultural resources surveys. No previously
recorded architectural resources or NRHP properties were located within the boundaries of the
current project study radius. Background research conducted in the Texas Site Files indicated
that no archaeological sites are located within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the current project
(THC Atlas 2009). Several, including Sites 41FB143, 41FB144, 41FB145, 41FB146,
41FB147, 41FB275, 41FB276, and 41FB292 lie outside the 1.6 kilometer (1 mile) radius of
the project along Oyster Creek. However, Site 41FB253 and the adjacent Site 41FB259, are
the only prehistoric sites recorded on Steep Bank Creek and its tributaryâs (Miller et al. 2002).
Only Sites 41FB99 and 41FB107 are recorded on Flat Bank Creek (Good 1985a, 1985b).
These sites on Flat Bank and Steep Bank Creeks area are discussed in the âPrevious
Investigationsâ section above. Five surveys have been completed within the study radius and
are presented in tabular form below (Table 1).

6.2 Field Investigations
Survey and deep testing were performed between August 26, 2009 and October 1, 2009
(Figure 3). Field investigation of the project area consisted of a pedestrian survey employing
30-meter (100-foot) transect spacing, shovel testing, and deep testing. The entire project was
pedestrian surveyed with 30-meter (100-foot) transect spacing to examine the surface for
historic or visible prehistoric cultural resources. Shovel tests were employed for subsurface
inspection throughout the project but were concentrated along Flat Bank Creek and
paleochannels as indicated by areas with Clemville, Norwood, Pledger, and Sumpf series soils
and topographic features. A total of 341 shovel tests and 35 deep tests were performed in the
project area (Figures 3, 4, and 5). The survey and all of the subsurface tests were negative for
cultural remains.

6.2.1 High Probability Areas
HPA 1
The entirety of HPA 1 was pedestrian surveyed employing 30-meter (100-foot) spacing of
transects and shovel test intervals. No positive results were recorded. A few ruins of ranchrelated feed structures were found in HPA 1. All were constructed with modern dimensional
lumber, soft wire nails, and corrugated metal roofing (Plate 1). Some modern debris was also
found along the banks of the creek, particularly the part that forms southern boundary of the
project area, possibly strewn along the slope of the bank as erosion control. Fifteen deep tests
were excavated. Only backhoe trench (BHT) 14, located in Fill Area 1, uncovered cultural
remains (Figure 2 and Figure 4, BHT 14). In the bottom fill level, excavators found an aquacolored, thick glass soda bottle fragment with an applied color label, suggesting a date in the
earlier part of the period from the 1940s to 1960s when these labels were common. Above
this, a plastic lid was found associated with a stratigraphically distinct second fill. In total,
dredge deposits are estimated to average 3 meters (10 feet) thick in Fill Area 1 along the
modern channel of Flat Bank Creek (See BHT 14 in Figure 5).
Testing of the northern half of the modern Flat Bank Creek channel revealed silty and sandy
floodplain deposits associated with the probable former Brazos River channels and similar
deposits from the 1890 channel of Flat Bank Creek. Dredging of the creek has destroyed the
first terrace of the creek along most of the stream, particularly south of the second oxbow
(southern segment). Dredge piles were encountered in several locations within the HPA. One
large open area located just south of the center of the eastern boundary, was covered in fill
estimated to average 3 meters (10 feet) thick (Plate 2). A bridge across Flat Bank Creek in the
center of the area appears to have facilitated the placement of fill. A second area (Fill Area 2)
just north of this large area of fill also had a thick fill deposit and was connected to areas
outside of the project area by a concrete bridge that has since been destroyed (Plate 3). This
second area is substantially smaller than the first and located opposite a subdivision on an
unnaturally straight segment of the meandering creek. The central part of the pile the dredge
averages close to 3 meters (10 feet) deep but a thinner layer covers the margin of the bank for
the entire length of the straight segment of Flat Bank Creek. From this northern fill area
southward much of the opposite bank of the southern segment of modern channel of Flat Bank
Creek has been thoroughly altered (Plate 4). Major modifications have changed the flow of the
stream and affected both banks. This post-1890s southern segment of the modern channel of
Flat Bank Creek is deeply incised and cuts through Brazoria clay. Cut-banks were exposed
and inspected when possible (Plate 5 and 6). Large slumps were common along the valley
walls (Plate 7). Only a few isolated deposits of silty or sandy sediment were found in a few
shovel tests along the edge of the creek valley. Intentional channelization or changes
incidental to drainage improvement may be responsible the avulsion of the channel between
1890 and 1938.
One paleosol was found so frequently that it likely underlies the entire southern half of HPA 1
and much of the southern and western halves of the project area (see BHT 25 in Figure 5).
This soil was found well-developed and stratigraphically above paleochannel deposits at the
southern terminus of the northern segment at its confluence with the modern channel. This
29

indicates that the deposition of sediment associated with this soil postdates at least some of the
channel deposits. A second deposition of floodbasin sediment covered the first soil and an
incipient soil is present at the surface. The buried soil likely formed in a floodbasin setting and
does not represent a culturally preferable site location. The dark color of the buried soil
represents high humus content indicative of a high biomass ground cover such as a marsh or
other wetland. The paleosolâs similarity to modern lowland soils such as Sumpf and Pledger
soils also supports this conclusion. However, naturally occurring ferrous magnesium
concentrated by water table fluctuations also imparts a black color to subsurface soils and
sediments. This and other diagenic factors complicate using color as an indicator of the
pedogenic environment in saturated floodplains (Schwertmann and Taylor 1989).
No cultural materials were observed eroding out of the soil or the paleosol along the cutbank
exposures of Flat Bank Creek. The character of the paleosol generally resembles a buried
Sumpf or Pledger series soil, which are typically rarely to frequently flooded and found on
lower levels of the floodplain (Mowery et al. 1960; SSS NRCS USDA 2009). Although such
soils can preserve older paleosols with intact cultural resources (Abbott 2001: Table 2), a
flood prone Pledger A horizon does not represent an environment conducive to long-term
prehistoric occupation. This buried soil was well-tested as most shovel tests (STs) reached
sufficient depth to at least encounter the top of the paleosol and every backhoe trench in HPA
1 penetrated the paleosol. In retrospect, this southern half of HPA 1 did not meet the definition
of HPA within the top two-plus meters of sediment. No artifacts, features, or
anthropogenically altered sediment was found during any part of the investigation of HPA 1.
HPA 2
This was the main channel of Flat Blank Creek in 1890 according to the Fort Bend County
surveyor (Fort Bend County 1890). The remnant topography of the creek channel its banks
and levees allowed tests to be targeted to specific landforms. Sandy deposits tend to be found
high in the profiles along the northern segment of the Flat Bank Creek paleochannel. These
are the natural levees. Deep sandy spots along the channel are still significant topographic
features and suggest that the stream was competent and carried a significant sediment load
(Plate 8). In the northern half of the northern segment the thick well-developed Ab-horizons
are not present in some of the tests and the B and C horizons of the paleosols are frequently
interbedded with thin lenses of calcareous fine sands and silts suggesting a dynamic lowfloodplain fluvial environment where weakly developed soil surfaces were periodically
truncated by high energy flooding and meandering stream systems. The southern half of the
northern segment of the channel is covered with deep floodbasin muddy clays with a welldeveloped buried soil under about 70 centimeters (27.6 inches) of recent floodbasin deposits.
Underlying this buried soil is silty and loamy sediments similar to lower levels in the northern
half. In the southern segment, no trace of the channel was found. Shovel testing revealed
uninterrupted Brazoria clays across the southern segment. No topographical features of the
southern segment were recognized and deep testing was not performed. Deep floodbasin
deposits with buried soils from 40-100 centimeters below the surface (cmbs) (16-39 inches
below the surface [inbs]) were typical of the southern segment. Eight backhoe trenches (BHTs
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 32, and 33) were employed to test the deep deposits of the banks of the 1890
channel. These tests were focused in the northern segments sandy and silty deposits. No
30

artifacts, features, or anthropogenically altered sediment was found during any part of the
investigation of HPA 2.
HPA 3
Centered on an oxbow, shovel testing provided data on soil composition and geomorphic
features of HPA 3. Generally, muddy deposits were found in the central low area of the
oxbow. Silty deposits occur on the margins of the low lying center or channel. These silty
deposits included overbank, point bar, and other floodplain sediments. The low ridge
paralleling each side of the channel is consistent with a natural levee made from sandy and
loamy alluvium likely representing reworked Brazos River alluvium. Several east-west
drainage ditches cross the oxbow. Interestingly, although the entire property was a pecan
grove, no mature trees were growing within the low center of the oxbow. This HPA was 100%
pedestrian surveyed with limited shovel testing (12 STs) because anticipated cultural resources
would likely be deeply buried. Eight deep tests (BHTs 15-21 and 35) were preformed to assess
the geomorphology and prospect for sites. Neither the survey nor deep testing resulted in
discovery of cultural remains in HPA 3. The barn area is adjacent to this HPA but not
included. It is discussed below.
HPA 4
This area was assigned a high probability categorization because soils indicated an oxbow was
present. High probability silty and sandy depositional features were assumed to flank the
oxbow. This area is low and marshy with palmettos and other ground cover that suggest a high
moisture regimen (Plate 9). This area is thickly forested with pecan trees in rows and
hackberry, elm, and oak filling in the rest. Thick clayey sediments and soils were exposed in
subsurface tests. A poorly developed Sumpf series soil overlies a well-developed buried soil at
40 cmbs (16 inbs). This buried soil most closely resembles the well developed Buffalo
paleosol which has been postulated to have formed 4200 to 2500 BP (Nordt and Waters 1995).
No cultural materials were observed on the surface or in any of the subsurface tests. However,
the paleosol generally resembles a buried Pledger or Sumpf series soil, which are typically
rarely to frequently flooded and found on lower surfaces of the floodplain (Mowery et al.
1960; SSS NRCS USDA 2009). A flood prone Pledger or Sumpf A-horizon does not represent
an environment conducive to long-term prehistoric occupation. Still, this buried soil was welltested as most STs reached sufficient depth to at least encounter the top of the paleosol and
every BHT in HPA 1 penetrated the paleosol. Four deep tests (BHT 24-27) were performed.
The first two were inside of the HPA. However, when these deep tests found muddy deposits,
the second set of deep tests moved out of the HPA in an attempt to find sandy or silty deposits
associated with the banks of the abandoned channel.
6.2.2 The Barn Area
The barn and remains of several outbuildings, corrals, a small shotgun house, and associated
remains were located on maps during background research conducted prior to fieldwork
(Figure 6). The 1955 USGS 7.5 minute topographic quadrant map shows only a windmill at
this location in the northeast part of the project area. Not long after this time, the barn was

built and the house was probably moved on to the property. Informant Juan Garcia, the former
ranch manager for the Schindler Ranch, said that the barn and house were there when he
arrived in the mid-1970s and the windmill was already gone. The house was used by migrant
workers and Garcia believed that the house had been moved to its present location in the late
1960s. Garcia built the corrals and put up most of the fencing on the property (Garcia personal
communication, 2009).
The barn is completely destroyed and the unexceptional house has been heavily modified and
is in very poor condition. Physical evidence that the house had been moved onto the property
was restricted to the lack of its depiction on any maps prior to 1995. The construction was
consistent with 1940s styles and dimensional lumber and wire nails were found exclusively.
No artifacts or farm equipment predating the 1960s were found during the close transect
survey of the area surrounding the barn and house. This area was connected to the Schindler
Ranch boy scout camp and headquarters by a gravel road and a bridge that crosses Flat Bank
Creek. The road west of the bridge is built on fill including bricks and cement fragments (Plate
10). Electric or phone wires are strung on telephone poles along the gravel road and a flat area
along the southern-side has been planted with St. Augustine grass. The insulators on the poles
were clearly modern. Several metal boxes with large electrical breakers inside were found in
the area along with a 1960s-70s refrigerator. No artifacts of historic age were found and the
barn ruins at the site represent a metal structure built sometime after 1955.
6.2.3 The Pecan Grove
The property has been maintained as a part of a pecan grove from planting until the sale of the
property to Sienna/Johnson North (Plate 11). Two sawn tree trunks were found during the
survey. Counting the tree rings was difficult due to uneven cutting and the age of the cut.
Counts of the first tree arrived at an average of 74 and the second, larger tree (27 inches in
diameter), averaged 110 (Plate 12). Significantly larger trees were found on the property but
this could be a reflection of growing conditions and not necessarily age. Trees were mostly
planted in rows and over much of the property the underbrush was relatively low. Many trees
have been blown down by hurricanes in the recent past. Maintenance is indicated by the
replacement of dead trees with young trees, demonstrated by younger trees placed between
older trees at the same interval, estimated to be 60 feet between rows of trees planted in 30foot intervals. During an informant interview, the former Schindler Ranch manager Juan
Garcia stated that the grove of pecan trees covered 5000 acres and during his tenure 2000
acres were maintained and harvested. Mr. Garcia did not know when the grove was originally
planted. Historic deed research did not reveal the origin of the orchard.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

This report summarizes the results of an intensive pedestrian archaeological survey and deep
testing conducted on 162 hectares (400 acres) of property proposed for the construction of a
residential housing development in Sienna Plantation, Fort Bend County, Texas. Prior to
fieldwork mobilization, a background literature and site file search was conducted to identify
the presence of recorded sites near the project area. The search indicated that no previously
recorded archaeological sites are located within 1.6-kilometers (1 mile) of the current project
area. No previously recorded cultural resources were identified in or adjacent to the project
area. Several surveys had been performed within the study radius.
Historic research revealed no specific activities or events in the project area that would leave
physical evidence such as historic structures or battlefields. However, the project area is
located on two of the original leagues granted to Stephen F. Austin by the Mexican
government and historic events such as the runaway scrape and Texas independence involved
the early settlers of this area. Historic research showed the homesteads associated with the
early occupants of the Shipman league were not located in the project area (Shipman 1965).
The bulk of the project area was located on property that was passed down through the heirs of
Moses Shipman until 1912. The Shipman family member recorded on the deed at the time of
sale is Thomas Mason. Daniel Shipman was the son of Moses and as an adult accompanied his
father to Texas. Daniel Shipman only cultivated a small part of his property and sold the
property in 1850 to relatives Samuel and Dorsey Mason.
Relatively few prehistoric sites have been recorded in the Brazos River floodplain Quaternary
alluvium and none were found during the current survey. However, as indicated by Abbott
(2001) all soil types within the project area have some possibility for buried sites. Paleosols
meeting the descriptions in Abbott (2001:106-126) were found during fieldwork in or below
all of the soil types mapped in the project area. The fieldwork was planned to test for historic
and prehistoric resources both on the surface and buried. Shovel tests were planned to cover
all parts of the project area but were concentrated in the HPAs. The results of the shovel tests
guided the location of the deep tests. Deep test locations were chosen based on the same
characteristics that defined the HPAs, that is, the presence of a buried soil and sandy, silty, or
loamy surfaces. These characteristics were interpreted as reflecting better-drained surfaces
meeting cultural preferences. The areas with low cultural preference were defined as those
with relatively dense, muddy deposits. Profiles meeting this description were found primarily
in areas mapped with Brazoria, Pledger, and Sumpf Series soils.
Brazoria clay covers the majority of the project area. This soil correlates with a low marshy
area that may partially explain the lack of sites. The areas of Clemville and other areas with
substantial sand, or sandy loam horizons adjacent to paleochannels developed from
meanderbelt sands associated with Brazos River channel movements across the project area.
Meander scars and floodplain features such as levee and point bar deposits testify to larger
inset streams while ephemeral channels and flood events are expressed as more localized and
thinner silty deposits or alternating layers of silt and clay. The profiles revealing alternating
loamy silt and 4 to 11 centimeters (1.56 to 4.33 inches) of thick hard, blocky clay with iron
concentrations but little organic matter suggest that flooding along the channel was scouring
34

the surface and then depositing coarser materials in a ponded or very low energy setting
allowing suspended clay and silt particles to cover the fine sand and silt. Point bar deposition
primarily accounts for the large area of massive silt and fine sand inside of the bend of Flat
Bank Creek within the oxbow of the Brazos River in the northeast corner of the project area. It
is likely that this northern part of the modern channel of Flat Creek is an oxbow of the Brazos
River and the bulk of this deposition is probably associated with the older stream. The outside
of the bend of the Brazos River oxbow in which Flat Bank Creek now flows has retained part
of its sandy levee. These deposits are also associated with the Brazos channel but have been
subject to some reworking. The Clemville soil area around the northern portion of the 1890
channel of Flat Bank Creek is the only location with profiles that demonstrated intact sandy
overbank deposits. Testing soils along the edges of paleochannels and meander scars was
effective at locating silty and sandy deposits.
Areas away from channels received less deposition and were significantly more clayey. The
first buried soil was closer to the surface in the western and southern parts of the project area
indicated as marsh on the 1938 reclamation map. This area typically had a thicker more
developed buried soil. Along the 1890 channel of Flat bank Creek, a very long trench (BHT 9)
demonstrated the thinning of the deposits over the first buried soil from the edge of the
channel (60 cmbs [24 inbs]) to the higher center of the field (30 cmbs [12 inbs]). Alternating
silt and silty clay layers found in this profile and the profiles of other subsurface test locations
along the channels were present at the channel margins but pinched out toward the higher
center of the field. The superposition of these silty deposits demonstrates that these all formed
after the first buried soil and these clay horizons undoubtedly represent a short-term muddy
surface.
Soils data collected during survey indicates that the paleosols underlying the project area
developed largely on low bottomland that was often inundated and subjected to flooding on a
periodic basis. Flood and run-off deposits draped these bottomland areas with loamy clay
about 30 to 100 centimeters (12 to 39 inches) thick. Various degrees of pedogenesis have
occurred in these clayey deposits. The dense hard clay of the upper Ab horizons and
frequently well-developed Bb horizons in these paleosols resemble Pledger soils found in lowlying areas of the project today but are better developed as indicated by the darker more humic
A horizon and a relatively higher clay content in the B horizon. It is likely that these were
frequently flooded low-lying areas when these buried soils developed. Large areas of dredge
along the banks of Flat Bank Creek suggest that historic and modern drainage improvements
have substantially reduced the frequency of flooding and inundation.
No historic or prehistoric cultural remains or features were located within the project area. No
evidence of cultural features was identified in any of the soil profiles examined in shovel tests,
cutbanks, fallen tree root balls, or trench walls. No prehistoric or historic archaeological
materials were observed or collected during pedestrian survey, shovel test excavation, or
trenching. Work on this project exceeded THC minimum standards of 1 shovel test every 1.2
hectares (3 acres) for a 162-hectare (400-acre) parcel. Subsurface tests included excavation of
341 shovel tests across the project area. Cut banks and numerous fallen trees provided
additional opportunities to inspect the subsurface. Deep testing explored subsurface sediments
identified during shovel testing and cutbank inspection as possible areas of higher and dryer
35

surfaces that would be culturally preferred for most activities. The deep tests included the
excavation of 35 trenches 3 to 15 meters (10 to 50 feet) long and 1 to 2.8 meters (3.3 to 9.2
feet) deep.
Research performed for this investigation confirmed a paucity of prehistoric sites recorded in
the quaternary alluvium of the Brazos River floodplain compared, for example, to the number
of sites found along the edge of the Beaumont Formation; particularly, adjacent to Oyster
Creek as Voellinger et al. suggested in 1988. Those sites that were found in the Quaternary
Alluvium were located on the low terraces of creeks and their tributaries. Two sites each have
been found on the low terraces of Flat Bank and Steep Bank Creeks northwest of the project
area. These four sites were found associated with clayey buried soils and were essentially Late
Prehistoric sites. The abandoned channels on the property, including the large oxbows that
Flat Bank Creek now occupies, provided similar settings along the banks of these
paleochannels that would likely also be culturally preferred. These low terraces of the
paleochannels and the cultural preference for well-drained surfaces were tested, however, no
sites were found in any setting in the 162 hectares (400 acres). This fact suggests the role of
scouring floods and deposition in the broader Brazos River floodplain has had an overriding
effect on the project area.
Not only has the scouring likely destroyed many sites, the relatively rapidly aggrading
sediments means the chronology represented in a typical shovel test is only scratching the
surface of the Holocene. Even the reach of the backhoe in this setting tests only a fraction of
the Holocene. Compare this to a deep test in an alluvial setting on the Beaumont formation
that would likely cut through the Holocene and the later part of the Pleistocene as well. The
relatively short period of time sampled by subsurface tests in this setting corresponds to a
lower probability of finding sites. If the cultural preference for well-drained surfaces applies to
this setting, sites would be fewer than typical for southeast Texas and would be concentrated
on the sandy terraces and levees. This supposition remains unsupported but some sites have
been found preserved in clayey buried soils and many more are likely deeply buried below any
anticipated impacts. The probability of finding any of them, however, is low. Considering
these facts and the results of the intensive archaeological survey and deep testing of the project
area, HRA Gray & Pape recommends that no further archaeological work is warranted and
that the project be cleared to proceed as planned.
