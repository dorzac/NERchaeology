ABSTRACT
In April and May of 2012, Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc. of Houston, Texas
conducted an archeological investigation of a proposed widening of Spring Stuebner
Road and a proposed detention basin in Harris County, Texas. The proposed Project Area
consists of approximately 4,750 meters (2.9 miles) of expanded existing roadway along
the existing Spring-Stuebner Road between Kuykendahl Road and IH 45. It will also
include a 9.661 acre detention pond located on the north side of Spring-Stuebner. The
proposed ROW within the project limits will range from roughly 25 meters (80 ft.) to
33.5 meters (110 ft.). The expected maximum depth of impact is not likely to be more
than 2 meters (6ft.) except at the proposed detention pond. The overall area surveyed
during the investigation was approximately 36 acres.
The investigations were conducted under TAC Permit Number 6229 for S & B
Infrastructure, Ltd. (S&B) at the request the Harris County Public Infrastructure
Department (HCPID). The results will be subject to review by S&B, HCPID, and the
Texas Historical Commission (THC). Property ownership within the project corridor is a
mixture of public and private. For all privately owned tracts it was necessary to obtain
right of entry (ROE) for all properties in the proposed ROW addition and the detention
basin.
A total of 94 shovel tests were excavated. Of these all but one were sterile for cultural
resources. A single historic feature, a remnant sheep dipping vat, was observed and
recorded. This feature was also the location of the single positive shovel test (ST49)
which contained a single wire nail. The feature was determined to date to the early or
mid-twentieth century and to have no significance or further research value. At the
request of the reviewing archeologist for the United States Army Corps of Engineers –
Galveston District the feature was submitted as a site to the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory and was issued the site trinomial 41HR1121. However, the Corps
agreed with the original assessment of the significance and value of the site and
concurred that it did not need to be preserved or otherwise protected during construction.
As a result of the investigation and the findings thereof it is the recommendation of
Moore Archeological Consulting that construction of the proposed ROW addition and
detention basin should be allowed to proceed without further archeological examination.

INTRODUCTION
In April and May of 2012, a crew from Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc., of
Houston, Texas conducted an intensive, linear and area cultural resource survey of the
proposed widening of Spring-Stuebner Road in northern Harris County (Figures 1-4).
The Project Corridor is found on the Tomball (309560) and Spring (309561) USGS
quadrangle map. The investigations were conducted under TAC Permit Number 6229 for
S & B Infrastructure, Ltd. (S&B) at the request the Harris County Public Infrastructure
Department (HCPID). The results will be subject to review by S&B, HCPID, and the
Texas Historical Commission (THC).
The proposed Project Area consists of approximately 4,750 meters (2.9 miles) of
expanded existing roadway along the existing Spring-Stuebner Road between
Kuykendahl Road and IH 45. It will also include a 9.661 acre detention pond located on
the north side of Spring-Stuebner. Construction of the expansion will impact the
properties along the corridor in different ways depending on the locale. In some areas
expansion will occur on both sides of the extant ROW. In others it will only impact one
side or the other. Because of this variability the width of the impact also varies depending
on the location. The proposed ROW within the project limits will range from roughly 25
meters (80 ft.) to 33.5 meters (110 ft.). The expected maximum depth of impact is not
likely to be more than 2 meters (6ft.) except at the proposed detention pond where the
depth will likely be significantly more. The overall area surveyed during the investigation
was 36 acres.
Property ownership within the project corridor is a mixture of public and private. For all
privately owned tracts it was necessary to obtain right of entry (ROE) for all properties in
the proposed ROW addition and the detention basin. All but one landowner eventually
provided ROE within the expected project timeline. The one remaining property lacking
ROE was along the ROW addition and constituted roughly 110 meters of frontage. This
property was bypassed and shovel tests were dug bracketing it. The property was also
visually examined from the edge of the road.
The objective of the investigation was to determine the presence or absence of cultural
materials within the locations proposed for the new roadway and the detention basin. It
also proposed to assess potentially impacted archeological sites and provide
recommendations regarding mitigation measures, if any were necessary. Finally it was to
provide a report of the results of the survey to S&B, HCPID, and the THC.
The crew excavated 94 shovel tests during the survey at preset intervals as described in
the METHODS section of this report. Project Archeologists Randy Ferguson and
Crewmember Kristen Jeremiah, Abidemi “Tunde” Babalola, Jake Muonio, Rachel
Goings, and Adam Moody conducted this investigation under the supervision of the
Principal Investigator, Douglas G. Mangum M.A.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Modern Climate
The modern climate of the Project Area can aptly be characterized as hot and wet for
most of the year. The mean annual temperature for the Study Area region is about 20 °C
(68 °F), with mean rainfalls of 117 centimeters (46”). Summer temperatures average
about 34 °C (93 °F) with temperatures above 38 °C (100 °F) common, during the months
of July and August (Carr 1967; St. Clair et al. 1975). The average winter temperature is a
mild 18 °C (64 °F). Freezes are infrequent and of short duration, with an average of 271
frost-free days per year.
Rainfall varies from 7 centimeters (2.7”) in March to 11 centimeters (4.3”) in December,
with July to December rainfalls often supplemented by tropical fronts and storms. The
rainfall records range from a low of 45 centimeters (17.7”) to a high of 185 centimeters
(72.8”). Prevailing winds are usually from the southeast except during the winter months
when ‘Northers’ sweep into the area.
Modern Flora and Fauna
Southeast Texas is within the Austroriparian biotic province near its western boundary
with the Texan province (Blair 1950:98-101). This boundary, set by available moisture
levels, is marked by pine-hardwood forests on the eastern Gulf coastal plain. The Project
Area is situated within the pine-oak forest subdivision of the Austroriparian province and
includes, within its western limits, portions of the coastal prairie (Tharp 1939).
Grasses within the coastal prairies and marshes vegetation area are described from a
range-management perspective in Hoffman et al. (nd: 45). This 4,046,873 hectares
(10,000,000-acre) area consists of 3,844,529 hectares (9,500,000 acres) of gulf prairies
and 202,343 hectares (500,000 acres) of gulf marshes. The regional vegetation of the
coastal prairies is characterized as follows:
“The principal grasses of the prairies are tall bunchgrass, including big bluestem
(Andropogon gerardi), little bluestem, seacoast bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium, var.
littorus), Indiangrass, eastern gamagrass (Tripascum dactyloides), switchgrass, and gulf
cordgrass. Seashore saltgrass is common on moist saline sites. Grazing pressures have
changed the composition of the range vegetation so that the grasses now existing are
broomsedge bluestem, smutgrass, threeawns, tumblegrass and many other inferior
grasses. The other plants that have invaded the productive grasslands are oak
underbrush, macartney rose, huisache, mesquite, pricklypear, ragweed, bitter
sneezeweed, broomweed, and many other unpalatable annual weeds” (Hoffman et al. nd:
45).

The dominant floral species of the pine-oak forest subdivision of the Austroriparian biotic
province include loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), yellow pine (Pinus echinata), red oak
(Quercus rubra), post oak (Quercus stellata), and blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica).
Hardwood forests are found on lowlands within the Austroriparian and are characterized
by such trees as sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora),

7

tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica), water oak (Quercus nigra) and other species of oaks, elms, and
ashes, as well as the highly diagnostic Spanish moss (Tillandsia usneiodes) and palmetto
(Sabal glabra). Swamps are common in the region.
Blair (1950) and Gadus (Gadus and Howard 1990:12-15) define the following mammals
as common within the Austroriparian province: white-tailed deer (Odocoileus
virginianus), muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), coyote (Canis
latrans), opossum (Didelphis virginiana), common mole (Scalopus aquaticus), eastern
pipistrelle (Pipistrellus subflavus), eastern red bat (Lasiurus borealis), eastern fox
squirrel (Sciurus niger), eastern grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), southern flying
squirrel (Glaucomys volans), Baird’s pocket gopher (Geomys breviceps), fulvous harvest
mouse (Reithrodonomys fulvescens), white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), marsh
rice rat (Oryzomys palustris), cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus,), packrat (Neotoma
floridana), eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), and swamp rabbit (Sylvilagus
aquaticus). Bison (Bison bison) may have been present on nearby grasslands at various
times in the past (Gadus and Howard 1990:15).
Common land turtles include eastern box turtle (Terrapene carolina) and desert box turtle
(Terrapene ornate), while snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentinia), mud turtle (Kinosteron
spp.), river cooter (Chrysemys concinna), and diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys
terrapin) comprise common water turtles. Common lizards include Carolina anole
(Anolis carolinensis), eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus undulates), ground skink
(Leiolopisma laterale), broad-headed skink (Eumeces laticeps), six-lined racerunner
(Cnemidophorus sexlineatus), and eastern glass lizard (Ophiosaurus ventralis). Snakes
and amphibians are also present in considerable numbers and diversity.
The resources provided by river-influenced estuarine and marsh environments were
undoubtedly of great importance to the littoral residents of southeast Texas. These
resources are admirably summarized by Gadus (Gadus and Howard 1990: 12 - 15).
Estuarine fish resources cited by Gadus include sand trout (Cynoscion arenarius), spotted
sea trout (Cynoscion nebulosus), Atlantic croaker (Micropogon undulatus), striped mullet
(Mugil cephalus), southern flounder (Paralichthysis lethostigma), shortnose gar
(Lepisosteus platostomus), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), freshwater drum
(Aplodinotus grunniens), red drum (Sciaenops ocellata), and bluegill (Lepomis
macrochirus) and other sunfishes. Common shellfish include rangia (Rangia cuneata),
clams (Macoma spp.), dwarf surf clam (Mulinia lateralis), oyster (Crassostrea virginica),
Vioscalba louisianae, and olive nerite (Neritina [Vitta] reclivata). Arthropods, such as
shrimp and crab, are also numerous and highly productive.
Area marshes replete with plants such as cordgrasses (Spartina spp.), reeds (Phragmites
spp.), giant millet (Setaria magna), and bullrushes (Scirpus spp.) would have formed a
highly attractive and bountiful magnet for waterfowl (Gadus and Howard 1990).
During the investigation it was observed that the project corridor was a mix of
undeveloped areas dominated by woods and developed areas with landscaped vegetation
or none at all. Those trees adjacent to the project corridor included a mixture of pine, oak,

8

and sweet gum. A review of older aerial photography dating back to 1944 suggests that
the bulk of the area was once open prairie dominated by grasses and with scattered trees
and the occasional motte or island of woods, usually centered on natural ponds. The
exception to this was the large riparian zone of Spring Creek where dense woods
dominated.
Soils and Geology
The segment of the Texas Gulf Coast encompassing the Project Area is on soils deposited
over the last million to two million years. It sits on the Beaumont Formation, bands of
alluvial deltaic soils running parallel to the coastline and laid down during a series of
glacial/interglacial intervals during the Middle to Late Pleistocene epoch. Downcutting
and erosion processes during the most recent glacial period incised and widened many of
the river drainages running through the Beaumont Formation. After the sea levels rose
during the Holocene, river valleys filled with alluvial soils creating broad, level
floodplains.
The proposed project area is depicted on sheets 11 and 12 of the Soil Survey of Harris
County, Texas (Wheeler, 1976) and contains two soil types. These are Wockley fine
sandy loam, and Gessner loam. Wockley soils are somewhat poorly drained, loamy
ancient alluvium. They have a low to medium geoarcheological potential (Abbott 2001.).
Wockley soils make up the majority of the roadway corridor and the bulk of the detention
basin. Gessner soils are poorly drained, loamy ancient alluvium. They have a low to
medium geoarcheological potential (Ibid.). Gessner soils occur in a number of short
segments of the roadway alignment and a fragment of the detention basin. Both the
Wockley and Gessner soils have the potential for inclusion of low sandy mounds
commonly referred to as “pimple mounds.” Such mounds are known to have good
potential for having been utilized as occupation and activity sites by Native Americans,
particularly when close to water sources. Examination of aerial photographs dating from
1972 and 1995 suggest that such mounds may have been present before the land was
developed. However, more recent aerial photographs have too much tree cover and
development to determine how many of these features still remain if any.
During fieldwork the crew found the Project Area to be a mixture of woods and
urbanized prairie with periodic low mounds dotting the landscape. Soils varied between
sandy loams, sands, sandy clays, and clays that made up the basal subsoil. Upon
examination it was evident that little of the corridor ROW had been impacted to a degree
that precluded shovel testing. All but 13 of the shovel tests excavated hit the clay basal
subsoil or were dug into deep deposits of artificial fill.
Of the 20 shovel tests dug into the locale for the detention basin six did not reach basal
clay subsoil. However, the soils into which these shovel tests were excavated are
considered “ancient” soils by Abbott (2001) and were laid down before human
occupation of North America. Therefore any occupation would have taken place on the
current surface and artifacts would have filtered down over time into the soils.
Considering the depths to which the shovel tests in this locale were excavated (up to 1

9

meter below the modern surface) and the fact that no artifacts were recovered it is
unlikely that anything cultural was missed.

Hydrology
Based on a review of 1920 USGS maps there were once four natural streams within 300
meters of the Project Corridor. All four were intermittent streams that eventually flowed
directly into Spring Creek to the north. A review of modern (1980’s) era topographical
maps shows that three of these streams are still present in the project corridor, but it
appears that all have been altered to some extent by human activity, including farming,
development, and some channel modifications.
Though there are no other streams in the area, a review of the 1920 maps indicated that
there were, at that time, numerous natural ponds within or close to the project footprint.
Some of these were quiet large. The remnants of some of these ponds are still extant in
modern topographical maps. Native Americans frequently utilized such ponds for water,
food and other resources. The remaining ponds visible in 1920 but absent in more recent
imagery may still exist but not be sufficiently deep to appear in the later topographical
maps which have a 5 foot contour interval (as opposed to the 1 foot contour interval in
the 1920 edition map).

10

CULTURAL HISTORY
The Project Area is in the Southeast Texas Archeological Region, which has been
summarized by Patterson (1995). Other recent prehistoric summaries with the prehistory
of the Houston area include Ensor (1991), and Moore and Moore (1991). The reader is
referred to these works for detailed data on the prehistory of this region.
Previous investigations in Southeast Texas have demonstrated that occupation of this area
began as early as 12,000 years ago. All through prehistory the inhabitants were nomadic
hunter-gatherers. Ensor (1991) has proposed a prehistoric cultural sequence of periods
for Southeast Texas which are as follows: Paleo-Indian (10,000-8,000 BC), Early Archaic
(8,000-5,000 BC), Middle Archaic (5,000-1,000 BC), Late Archaic (1,000 BC–AD 400),
Early Ceramic (AD 400-AD 800), and Late Ceramic (AD 800-AD 1750).
Evidence for prehistoric occupation of Southeast Texas is scarce in the Paleo-Indian
period, and indeed, is ambiguous through the Middle Archaic period (Patterson 1983;
Aten 1983:156-157). Although most previously recorded sites date to the Late Archaic
and Ceramic periods, it is probable that earlier dating sites have been lost to erosion,
channel cutting, and, in the case of very early sites, to rising sea level. In cases where
early-dating artifacts have been found, such as Wheat’s (1953) finds of projectile points
dating from the Paleo-Indian through Middle Archaic periods at Addicks Reservoir in
western Harris County, the materials occur in deposits with poor contextual integrity.
Sites dating from the Late Archaic through the Ceramic periods are more commonly
found in the region. During the Late Archaic period, modern climatic conditions
evolved, sea level rose and stabilized, and coastal woodlands expanded. Aten (1983)
hypothesizes that an increase in population and the establishment of seasonal rounds,
including regular movement from littoral to inland areas occurred during the Late
Archaic period. Relevant to the prehistory of the Project Area are Hall’s (1984) data
from the Allens Creek project in nearby Austin County, Texas. Excavations of a large
cemetery there suggest a Late Archaic trade system linking Southeast Texas to Central
Texas and into Arkansas.
Aten (1983) has proposed that ceramics were introduced in the artifact assemblage on the
Upper Texas Coast at AD 100. Ensor (1991) places the beginnings of the Early Ceramic
period at AD 400, which may be more applicable for inland areas. The Early Ceramic
period is characterized by a continued growth in population. Ensor places the beginning
of the Late Ceramic at AD 800, coinciding with the introduction of the bow and arrow.
Plain sand-tempered pottery dominates throughout both parts of the Ceramic era. Story
et al. (1990) defined the Mossy Grove Cultural Tradition for Late Prehistoric cultures in
Southeast Texas with sandy paste pottery being the principle diagnostic artifact.
Although European settlement did not begin to seriously disrupt aboriginal habitation in
the areas inland from the Upper Texas Coast until after AD 1700 (Patterson 1995; 249),
European diseases, probably introduced by explorers and early traders, began to have
impacts as early as AD 1528. Seven recorded epidemics ran through the tribes of the

11

study area between that year and AD 1890 (Ewers, 1974). The Project Area appears to
have been within the territory of the Akokisa in the 18th and 19th centuries (Aten 1983).
Other groups that may have resided in Harris County include the Atakapan, Karankawa,
and the Tonkawa. During the 18th and 19th century disease, the mission system, and the
fur trade acted to reduce, and in some cases exterminate, the indigenous populations.

12

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
A review of the records at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) at the
University of Texas indicated that there is only one previously recorded site within the
vicinity of the Project Area. This site is 41HR837, a historic site was found during a 1999
archeological survey by Moore Archeological Consulting (Beck 1999). This site was
recommended as not being of sufficient archeological value to merit further
investigations or eligibility as either a State Archeological Landmark or National Register
of Historic Places site. No other archeological sites fall within a half kilometer of the
current project area. However, the Moore Archeological Consulting survey mentioned
above is the only prior survey that covers any significant portion of the current project
corridor. It crossed the corridor within a 700 meter long segment roughly between
Gosling Road and Sherrod Lane. No other archeological surveys have addressed the
project corridor specifically. Two linear surveys have briefly crossed the project corridor;
one a survey of the Gosling Road Extension conducted in 1993 and the other a survey of
a preferred alignment for the Grand Parkway Project conducted in 2000. Neither
investigation found any cultural resources. No other archeological investigations have
occurred within or immediately adjacent to the current project area. It is likely that the
small number of known sites relates directly to this lack of previous archeological
investigations.

13

METHODS
The intensive pedestrian cultural resources survey covered 100% of the proposed Project
Area. The Principal Investigator and/or the Project Archeologist and field assistants
conducted the survey. All areas of exposed soil were examined for surface exposure of
cultural remains and features. Particular attention was paid to any landforms or features
that have been determined of high archeological probability. The survey was conducted
in accordance with prevailing standards accepted by the Texas Historical Commission
(THC), the Council of Texas Archeologists, and Section 106 regulations.
Shovel testing was conducted in an attempt to identify buried cultural resources. One
transect was established in each of the proposed ROW expansion on either side of the
roadway where expansion is expected. One shovel test (40 cm by 40 cm) was excavated
every 100 meters on each transect. In the detention basin THC standards for area survey
resulted in the excavation of another 20 shovel tests. Shovel tests were excavated to at
least one meter deep or until intact basal clay is reached. Each test was documented,
including information on location (utilizing a hand-held GPS), soil profile and cultural
yield. Soil fill from tests was screened (when possible) through ¼-inch hardware cloth
and examined for cultural materials, and the units were backfilled immediately. The
UTM location of all shovel tests was recorded utilizing WAAS enabled recreation-grade
GPS units and plotted onto a USGS map using ArcView 3.3 (Figure 5a and 5b).
Alterations were made to transects and shovel test intervals when necessary to allow
testing of better landforms. Since a review of soil types showed that the whole of the
project corridor falls within soil types known to have small mound features that are
common locales for prehistoric sites, such features were considered to have particular
priority in such efforts. All visible surfaces were examined for historic or prehistoric
archeological materials. Surface visibility varied throughout the Project Area, from 0%50% due to various forms of ground cover.
Any locality producing either prehistoric or historic cultural remains was recorded on
State of Texas archeological site forms for submission to THC. In addition to form
information, photographs, plan and stratigraphic sketches and measured drawings and
crewmembers’ daily field notes documented any sites and features. However no
prehistoric or historic sites were observed during the investigation.
Right of Entry
Because the tracts along the proposed ROW have mixed ownership it was necessary
acquire permission for entry to conduct investigations of the land. All but one of the
landowners along the road ROW were willing to provide such permission and as a result
it was possible to examine virtually the entire ROW corridor. The one owner who denied
ROE owns property amounting to barely more than 100 meters of frontage along Spring
Stuebner. It was decided to bracket this property with shovel tests on either side in tracts
for which ROE was available. This amounted to a slight variation in the sampling
distance between shovel tests. The property was also examined visually from outside the
fence line to confirm that there was no evidence of historical structures within the area

14

likely to be impacted. No cultural resources, structures or features were found or
observed in either the shovel tests or as a result of the visual examination. It is felt that
this methodology sufficiently sampled the area to make it unlikely that cultural resources
are present within the one locale for which no ROE was available.

RESULTS
In April and May of 2012 a crew from Moore Archeological Consulting performed an
intensive pedestrian archeological survey of the proposed Spring-Stuebner Road
expansion in Harris County, Texas. As mentioned in the METHODS section, this survey
was performed utilizing shovel testing along transects on either side of the roadway and
area survey in the detention basin locale, as well as visual survey of all visible surfaces.
This sampling methodology resulted in the excavation of 94 shovel tests (74 in the ROW
and 20 in the detention basin).
All but one of the 94 shovel tests excavated during the investigation were sterile for
cultural resources and no historic structures (aside from the subsurface historic feature
discussed below as Site 41HR1121 which also incorporates the single “positive” shovel
test) were observed. Shovel test number 27 (from the original ROW survey) was initially
recorded as positive because of the presence of historical debris consisting of metal and
glass fragments. Additional shovel tests were dug around it and these recovered sufficient
evidence to determine that the artifacts are from the early to middle twentieth century.
Additionally it was determined that the soils present at the locale were redeposited from
another location. Based on these findings it was decided that this locale does not
represent a site and no additional work was conducted.
Of the shovel 94 tests all but 13 reached the sterile basal subsoil or were dug into deep
deposits of fill. Of the thirteen exceptions 6 were dug in the detention basin area and the
rest were scattered along the ROW alignment. Although these deep, non-subsoil shovel
tests might seem to suggest slight potential for deeply buried cultural resources, this is
highly unlikely. The soils are part of known deep natural deposits of ancient origin
(Abbott 2001). Therefore any occupation would have taken place on the current surface
and artifacts would have filtered down over time into the soils. Considering the depths to
which the shovel tests in this locale were excavated (up to 1 meter below the modern
surface) and the fact that no artifacts were recovered it is unlikely that anything cultural
was missed.
Site 41HR1121
A single subsurface concrete feature was noted on the north side of Spring-Stuebner
(Appendix A; Photograph 6). This was found adjacent to shovel test number 46. The
feature appears to be the remnants of a sheep dip tank built of two concrete slabs that
were once roughly parallel to one another. One of the walls has since begun to collapse
towards the other and the tank is mostly filled in with dirt. Shovel tests (ST37, 46, and
49) were dug adjacent to the tank to see if any diagnostic artifacts could be found. All
that was recovered was a single wire nail found in ST49. This modern item combined
with the quality of the concrete indicated to this author that this feature is most likely an
early to mid-twentieth century sheep dipping feature with no historical significance. As a
result it was recommended that the feature did not need to be protected or preserved.
However, at the specific request of the reviewing archeologist from the United States
Army Corps of Engineers – Galveston District (USACE) this feature was submitted as a

17

site and was issued the trinomial 41HR1121 by the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory. Despite this recommendation and the issuance of the trinomial, the USACE
nevertheless concurs with the assessment that the feature is not historically significant
and agrees with the recommendation that there is no need to protect or preserve the site.

RECOMMENDATIONS
It is the recommendation of Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc. that no further
archeological investigation is necessary within the Project Corridor prior to the beginning
of construction. This includes the site designated 41HR1121. This is based on the results
of the intensive shovel testing discussed in this report, which revealed that aside from
41HR1121 there were no cultural resources within the corridor. Further, that 41HR1121
is not a significant site and does not need to be protected or otherwise preserved.
Recordation of the site sufficient to meet the needs of the USACE has already been
completed. It is felt that sufficient excavations occurred across the full extent of the
Project Area to suggest the absence of intact cultural resources other than those
previously mentioned.
Should archeological deposits or features be encountered during construction, it is
advised that construction cease in the immediate area of the finds and the Archeology
Division of the Texas Historical Commission should be contacted for consultation.

Comments
The ST is located on a
mound. This might be the
reason why the ST could
not get to strong clay
deposit. However, the
lowest strata, although
sandy, has more clay
property, which made the
sand sticky when rubbed
between hands.
