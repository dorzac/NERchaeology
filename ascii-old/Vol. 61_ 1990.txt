Devils River State Natural Area

ABSTRACT
The 1989 Field School of the Texas Archeological Society concentrated
on broad area survey of the newly acquired Devils River State Natural Area, a
8900-ha (22,000 acre) property of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department on
the east bank of the Devils River in Val Verde County. The field school
identified 239 cultural properties in the 6,880 ha (17,000 acres) they surveyed;
of these 239 properties they tested two rockshelters, two shaft caves, and two
open campsites. The newly formed TAS rock art recording crew documented
eight pictograph sites, developing procedures appropriate for a much broader
effort planned for coming years. The data gathered by the field school contributed to comparative site locational studies that helped in identifying environmental and cultural factors that have affected settlement patterns across space
and through time in the Lower Pecos region.

INTRODUCTION

The 1989 Field School of the Texas Archeological Society (TAS) was held
in Val Verde County at the Devils River State Natural Area (DRSNA), then
newly acquired by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) as a nature preserve. The natural area encompasses about 8,900 ha (22,000 acres) of
the old Fawcett Ranch, extending north and east of the Devils River from Dolan
Springs (Figure 1), the well spring that is the source of much of the river’s flow.
Previous archeological research demonstrated that the DRSNA has been
occupied throughout prehistory by hunters and gatherers who exploited the wide
range of habitats in the dissected landscape (Marmaduke and Whitsett 1975).
The TPWD, anticipating the need to inventory the cultural resources of the
preserve, cosponsored the field school, providing an opportunity for members
of the TAS to get experience in the Lower Pecos region. The work was authorized
by Texas Antiquities Permit 758, issued to the TAS and TPWD, and all materials
recovered by the field school are curated at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL), The University of Texas at Austin.

LOWER PECOS ENVIRONMENTAL
AND CULTURAL BACKGROUND

Several authors (Story and Bryant 1966; Bryant 1969; WiUiams-Dean 1978)
have described the Lower Pecos environment, so it will be only briefly summarized
here in reference to the DRSNA and where it is pertinent to the archeological and
historic record. The report of the Devils River-Dolan Creek Natural Area Survey,

published in 1975 by The University of Texas at Austin (Marmaduke and Whitsett
1975), specifically deals with the DRSNA and its environs.
The thick bedded limestone of the Devils River Formation is exposed over the
greater part of the DRSNA. The bedrock along much of the Devils River-limestones of the Devils River Formation--is less resistant than limestones of the
same formation along the Pecos River and the Rio Grande. In some parts of the
DRSNA, most specifically along Dolan Creek, the limestones contain more
dolomite, which makes them more susceptible to weathering. This contributes to the
inability of the bedrock to sustain deep overhangs, prevents the formation of large
rockshelters, and contributes to the rapid deterioration of rock art painted on their
surfaces (Caran 1989). Thin clay remnants of the Del Rio Formation that cap the
upland t~ts provide suitable surfaces for open campsites. The low, domed residues
of Buda Limestone that are common along the Pecos River and the Rio Grande have
been eroded completely away in the Devils River area above the northern limits of
Lake Amistad.
Topographically, the DRSNA is a fiat tableland dissected by entrenched
tributaries that eventually reach the Devils River on the western periphery of the
natural area. Local relief is 100 to 120 meters (330 to 390 feet), with some unbroken
cliffs such as Yellow Bluff towering to as much as 66 meters (220 feet) (Deal 1975).
Bisecting the DRSNA is Dolan Creek, a broad gravel-strewn intermittent stream
bed that becomes perennial below Dolan Springs, just about 1.5 km above its
confluence with the Devils River. The DRSNA includes short, steep canyons such
as Turkey Track and Escondido, longer, more gently inclining drainageways such
as East and Speed canyons, and long, deeply entrenched rugged canyons such as
Rough Spring. Vertical relief has had an important effect on the prehistoric use of
the landscape.
Most of the flow of the Devils River comes from springs, beginning with a large
ojo de agua, Pecan Springs, on the Hudspeth River Ranch north of the DRSNA.
Above that, the river flows, floods, and dries in accordance with the runoff in its
watershed. It has been estimated that 75 percent of the flow of the Devils River at
Dolan Falls is contributed by Dolan and smaller springs nearby (Deal 1975:27).
Even in the desperate drought of the 1950s, when the springs above the DRSNA
failed for the first time in recorded history, Dolan and its companion springs on the
Devils River sustained only diminished output.
Spring water was a major factor affecting the density and duration of prehistoric
occupation along the Devils River. Precipitation, which averages about 45 cm (18
inches) a year, usually falls as heavy showers and thunderstorms between April and
October, when evaporation rates are high. Surface evaporation from Lake Amistad
is four times the annual precipitation (Deal 1975:17). Undoubtedly, in prehistory,
deeper soils and denser vegetation contributed to a higher effective precipitation
rate. According to local lore, Dolan Creek once flowed between grassy banks, not
along the mobile gravel bed that now absorbs much of the runoff before it reaches
the river (Deal 1975:28). Massive floods in 1935 and 1948 stripped away dense
stands of sycamore, oak, and pecan trees from the river and creek banks. E. K.

Fawcett, original settler in the DRSNA, claimed he could walk the entire length of
his ranch along the Devils River and never step out of the shade; now only two
groves remain in isolated pockets along the exposed limestone banks; both have
prehistoric sites. Snake Springs, a small tributary of Dolan Springs, once harbored
rainbow trout, but the stream now emerges only to disappear under mobile gravel
beds. The detrimental effect of overgrazing extends to the uplands, where flowing
springs, once centers of prehistoric occupation, are now evidenced only by travertine remnants or the density of cultural material in the vicinity.
The modern floral and faunal assemblages of the DRSNA are products of the
environmentally disruptive activities of domestic livestock. On the upland flats and
slopes, thorny brush has taken hold at the expense of native browse and grasses.
Road traffic has kept the canyon bottoms passable, but dense thicket covers the
lower slopes throughout much of the preserve. All the desert succulents that made
up the bulk of the prehistoric diet were available in the DRSNA. Hardwood trees
once lined the fiver, providing seasonal nut harvests and ample firewood, and deer
and small game were exploited throughout prehistory. Rivefine resources, such as
fish, mussels, and turtles, gave the DRSNA residents a ready supply of protein. The
addition of bison to the regional fauna during Late Archaic times is demonstrated
by remains recovered from Skyline Shelter, on the west bank of the Devils River
(Turpin 1990a) and Castle Canyon, a site now inundated by Lake Amistad (Greer
1976). Ethnohistoric reports (Turpin 1987a) and rock art depictions at Yellow Bluff,
directly adjacent to the DRSNA (Turpin 1989), also place bison in the study area
during early historic times.
Study of pollen counts (Bryant 1969), faunal remains (Dibble and Lorrain
1968), flood deposits (Patton and Dibble 1982), and ethnohistoric accounts (Turpin
1987a), has permitted reconstruction of the paleoenvironment of the Lower Pecos
region. This sequence began with the cool, moist climate at the end of the last Ice
Age and ended in the hot, dry regime of today. An overall trend toward aridity was
broken some 3000 to 2500 years ago and again in protohistoric times by mesic
interludes. One reciprocal swing of the climatic pendulum is locally identified as the
Ozona Erosional period (Bryant 1969), which transpired about 5000 years ago.
PREHISTORIC CONTEXT
Fifty years of archeological research have produced a cultural chronology that
spans more than 12,000 years of Lower Pecos prehistory and early history (Tmpin
1991a). The traditional division into Paleoindian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and
Historic periods has been further refined into 12 subpefiods defined by radiocarbon
dates and temporally diagnostic tool types (Table 1). Detailed commentaries on this
cultural sequence have been published recently by Hester (1989), Sharer (1986),
and Turpin (1991a), and are not repeated here.
Considerable effort has been devoted to research in settlement patterns
(Marmadnke 1978; Turpin 1982), human health and diet (Alexander 1974; Williams-Dean 1978; Stock 1983; Sobolik 1991), adaptive technologies and strategies

Henneberg, and Riskind 1986; Turpin 1988, 1991b), rock art (Jackson 1938;

and Speck 1974; Parsons 1986), and climatic reconstructions (Bryant 1969; Bryant
and Shafer 1977; Dibble and Lorrain 1968). Individual surveys and excavations are
too numerous to list here, but of direct relevance to the field school is Marmaduke
and Whitsett’s (1975) Natural Area reconnaissance, the only published account of
archeological research in the DRSNA. North of the study area, excavations at Baker
Cave (Word and Douglas 1970; Hester 1983; Chadderdon 1983; Brown 1991)
demonstrated an occupational sequence spanning 10,000 years. Publications to date
emphasize the Early Archaic component of Baker Cave, but future research will
explore a multitude of problems regarding regional adaptation (Brown 1991). On
the west bank of the Devils River, just below the DRSNA, the deep deposits of
Skyline Shelter have contributed data on economic strategies (Turpin 1990),
mortuary practices (Turpin 199 lb), human health and diet (Powel11991), and lithic
traditions (Turpin and Bement 1991), although analyses are far from complete.
Skyline Shelter is one of the few rockshelters in this region where seasonality, in this
case winter occupation, can be demonstrated. The people who lived in the DRSNA

probably followed much the same subsistence strategies as did the occupants of
Skyline Shelter, who relied heavily on fish, mussels, and turtles, which were
available nearby in the Devils River.
HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

The first Europeans to set foot in what came to be called the Devils country were
members of Gaspar Castaflo de Sosa’s entrada in 1590 (Schroeder and Matson
1965). Although several Spanish expeditions penetrated north of the Rio Grande in
the 250 years of their hegemony, none produced the ethnographic detail found in
sources on neighboring regions, such as Cabeza de Vaca (Campbell 1979). At f’trst,
the Jumanos and Cibolas were the most common peoples mentioned in Spanish
documents. After the Pueblo Revolt of 1680--1690, the Apache apparently took
control of the region, but they were soon succeeded by Comanche and Kiowa raiders
who travelled south from their bases on the Red River to harvest booty from
northern Mexico. Foes of the Plains Indians and Texans alike, in the nineteenth
century the Kicka~s raided northward across the Rio Grande from their homes
near the colonial settlement of Santa Rosa, now the modem town of Musquiz, in
Coahuila.
Spanish forays into the Lower Pecos River region were often hurriedly
launched pursuits of raiding Indians rather than colonizing expeditions. The area
was not thoroughly explored or mapped until after the Treaty of Guadalupe
Hidalgo between the United States and Mexico in 1849. Immediately after this
peace accord was signed, American surveyors and engineers went into the field
to map the border between Mexico and the United States and to seek a route to
Santa Fe and on to California. The leader of one of the first American expeditions, famed Texas Ranger Jack Hays, gave the Devils River its English name-the Spaniards had called it the Rio de las Lajas (Schroeder and Matson
1965)--and later the San Pedro (Hayes commented that it more likely belonged
to the Devil [Greer 1952]). Despite Hayes’s unfavorable opinion of this route,
they forged ahead with a road leading northward from San Felipe Springs (Del
Rio), along the Devils River, then westward to the Pecos and on to El Paso. The
San Antonio-San Diego mail route was established in 1853 (Austerman 1985).
Military activity increased in an attempt to protect travelers and settlers, and, in
1853, Fort Clark was established squarely athwart the Comanche Trace; in 1857,
Camp Hudson was built overlooking Bakers Crossing, a major ford of the Devils River. Local tradition has it that Dolan Springs and Dolan Creek were named
for an army lieutenant, but his role in their discovery or exploitation is unclear
(Finegan, 1989 personal communication). When the Civil War intervened, the
redirection of military force opened the way for the intrusive Plains Indians, who
regularly travelled through the Devils River country to raid the settled villages
and ranches of Coahuila. The war behind it, the U.S. Army turned to the task of
pacifying the west, and several notable battles were fought on the Devils River,

but their locations are only conjectural. One confrontation between the Second
Cavalry and Comanches took place in 1857 on a bluff overlooking the Devils
River (Fehrenbach 1983:426-427); military buttons and other accoutrements
found in Snake Springs Canyon at the base of Yellow Bluff near Dolan Springs
are attributed to that battle, but the area was swept clean in the flood of 1975,
so proof is not forthcoming (Finegan, 1989 personal communication). In 1881,
the Southern Pacific Railroad opened the way for settlement, bringing goods
and providing the means for getting products to market.
In 1883, a young herder, Erasmus Keyes Fawcett, arrived on the Devils
River, pushing a herd of sheep and earning $15 a month (Turpin 1987b, 1990b).
He took up residence in a rockshelter overlooking the river while he built a cabin
and began to accumulate land ~urpin 1990b). When he married Frances Baker,
of Baker’s Crossing, in 1902, they moved the ranch headquarters to its present
location on Dolan Creek, north of the current boundary of the DRSNA. There,
all the headquarters functions of a small hamlet and large ranching operation
were fulfilled by a cluster of workers’ houses, school, cemetery, commissary,
truck garden, smithy, shearing pens, dip tank, pig, cattle, and wool barns, and
myriad specialized work areas. When the 24,290 ha (60,000 acre) spread was
divided among the descendants of Frances and E. K. Fawcett, the portions now
included in the DRSNA were inherited by son Lee and daughter Brancie Finegan,
with about 160 ha (400 acres) directly surrounding Dolan Springs held in irrevocable trust for the entire family. The Finegans operated their Dolan Creek
Ranch as a ranch and hunting preserve for many years prior to its acquisition by
TPWD.
Although the Fawcett Ranch was one of the first large sheep operations on
the Devils River, all of the early structures are just outside the perimeter of the
DRSNA. The rockshelter where E. K. Fawcett, patriarch of the family, first lived
and the log cabin he built, which subsequently burned (Turpin 1987b), are south
of Dolan Springs and north of the confluence of Dolan Creek and the Devils
River. The ranch headquarters, which presents an almost complete picture of
the development of the west Texas sheep industry, is beside the main road just
a few hundred meters north of the DRSNA gate.
GOALS OF THE FIELD SCHOOL
The primary goal of the field school was to identify the nature and
distribution of prehistoric and historic use of the rugged terrain of the DRSNA.
To accomplish this goal, TAS carried out limited testing at two rockshelters, a
creek terrace site, an upland site, a vertical shaft cave, and, after the field
school, a horizontal shaft cave, to determine their age, function, and roles in the
community patterning of the region. A newly organized TAS rock art recording
crew documented eight pictograph sites, developing methods and skills for later
application at other endangered pictograph sites.

Texas ArcheologicalSociety
Survey

The survey of the DRSNA was of particular scientific importance because the
area consists of 8,900 ha (22,000 acres) that sample a wide variety of
microenvironments, ranging from the riverine zone paralleling the Devils River to
the uplands, remote from any source of permanent water. This diversity results from
the dissected nature of the terrain, which provides different habitats in close vertical
proximity. Access to diverse resource zones is a major factor influencing the
location of sites in this region (Turpin 1982) so, for the purposes of this survey, the
DRSNA was divided into riverine, canyon bottom, canyon rim, and upland zones.
Variability within these broad categories is effected by the unpredictable influence
of springs, tinajas (pot holes), steep bluffs, and chert outcrops, all of which affected
the configuration of prehistoric exploitation patterns.
The DRSNA offered the first opportunity to compare the results of a broad area
survey in the Devils drainage with the settlement pattern previously established by
similar efforts in the Rio Grande and Pecos drainages. Toward that end, a site
typology was created so the nomenclature used on the field school survey forms
would agree with what had been used in Seminole Canyon (Turpin 1982) and other
areas along the Rio Grande and the Pecos River. The results of the survey have been
divided into seven categories: rock art (pictographs and petroglyphs), rockshelters
(including caves), burned rock features (middens and hearths), stone alignments
(cairns and rings), lithic procurement (quarries and chipping stations), lithic
scatters, and historic sites.
The TAS field school divided the DRSNA into 12 roughly equal areas,
designated A through L and defined by pasture fences. To compensate for travel
time, the roughly equal areas diminished in size with distance from the field school
headquarters. A windmill in each area served as a landmark and a meeting place in
the event of crew dispersal during the day. Designated crew chiefs were responsible
for coordinating activities and reporting their day’s findings to the survey supervisor, Michael W. Davis. Workers in the field laboratory, set up in the former Finegan
Ranch hunting lodge, processed each day’s site forms and artifacts and plotted
acreage surveyed and site locations on a master map.
Due to restrictions imposed by TPWD biologists that placed the nesting habitat
of the black-capped vireo off-limits to archeologists, the crews surveyed only about
6,880 of the total 8,900 ha (17,000 of the total 22,000 acres) in the DRSNA. The
areas omitted were generally gentle, somewhat bushy slopes near the central
campground with the result that this area may be underrepresented in the site
inventory; known sites in this habitat were not revisited.
When the field school began, 54 sites had been recorded within the boundaries
of the DRSNA, 24 of them by Marmaduke and Whitsett (1975), who reconnoitered
the area as part of the Devils River Natural Area Survey. The largest block of sites
(28) was recorded during visits to the Fawcett Ranch by Turpin and Bement in the
late 1980s. The field school recorded an additional 187 sites, bringing the DRSNA
total to 239, of which six are Euro-American and 233 are Native American in origin.

Rock Art Sites
41VV207,209,527,888,889,915,921,922, 1082, 1087, 1088,1105, 1145
Three rockshelters containing some form of art, a shaft cave replete with
incised lines, and one unusual figure abraded into a canyon wall were recorded
by the field school surveyors, bringing the total within the DRSNA to 13. The
first two pictograph sites, 41VV207 and 41VV209, as well as other sites in the
vicinity, were recorded by Jim Barkes in 1973 (see also Marrnaduke and Whitsett
1975). Both are rockshelters with deteriorated Middle Archaic-age Pecos River
style panels, including large red panthers (Figure 2) and various shaman figures; both overlook major tributaries of the Devils River. The next pictograph
site to be documented was 41VV527, found by Marmaduke and Whitsett (1975:
88-89) during their natural area survey in 1975. This site was in the heart of the
nesting habitat of the black-capped vireo, so the rock art recording crew documented the remnant art on a later volunteer trip to the DRSNA. It too is a deteriorated Pecos River style panel in a shelter that evidences long-term occupation
(Marmaduke and Whitsett 1975).
Lee Bement and Solveig Turpin recorded rock art sites 41 VV888, 41 VV889,
41VV915, 41VV921, and 41VV922 in 1985. All have Pecos River style pictographs, and all but one are badly deteriorated. The exception, 41VV888, has four
extremely clear shaman figures (Figure 3), some miscellaneous compositions, and
a rare Red Linear hunting scene (Robinson 1989), reconstructable because of its
similarity to more intact vignettes at 41VV612, downstream on the Devils River.
Despite the obvious intensity of ritual activity in these locations, 41VV888 and its
sister site, 41VV889, are remote from the areas expected to have had high
population density. They overlook a dry tributary of Rough Spring Canyon, far from
its confluence with the river.
Another pair of related rock art sites, 41VV921 and 41VV922, are high in a
bluff overlooking the broad floodplain of Dolan Creek, on the same stream course
but above the similarly situated sites 41VV209 and 41VV527. Farther east, on
another dry tributary, 41VV915 is unusual in that the many figures lining the shelter
wall have been scratched almost to obliteration, probably in antiquity, making most
of them unintelligible. One possible blanket design in 41VV915 is the only example
of the Late Prehistoric Bold Line Geometric style found in the DRSNA (Turpin
1986).
The five sites recorded during the field school introduce considerable variety
into the regional rock art inventory. Only two 41VV1082 and 41VV1105---are
typical Pecos River style panels. Miniature red deer and remnant dots of red paint
are all that remain in 41VV1082, but 41VV1105 has six to eight anthropomorphic
figures. One can be identified as a rabbit-eared shaman, a motif found in abundance
along the Rio Grande at Rattlesnake Canyon and Abrigo Diego, and far to the south
in the Sierra del Carmen at Sin Nombre (Turpin 1991c). Neither site had much
cultural material.

The remaining three newly recorded rock art sites are unusual. Shield Shelter,
41VV1088, has only one composition--a circle encompassing 27 to 30 crescents
and surrounded by a wavy line (Figure 4). The design is unlike any other pictograph
in this region and conforms to none of the defined styles. Symbolically, the
semicircular elements may represent horseshoes contained within a circular corral
or moons enclosed within the sun (Turpin 1991d). The Plains-like theme and the
metaphorical range of this panel suggest that it is historic or protohistoric in age,
produced by an artist from one of the intrusive groups that travelled through the
Lower Pecos region between 1700 and 1885.

Another site that may well be of historic age is 41VV1087, where a human
figure was created by scraping the dark manganese stain from an exposed section
of canyon wall on a minor tributary far from the river. This site cannot be dated by

stylistic or other means, but it is so unlike any other Lower Pecos rock art that it may
well be the product of an idle hunter or sheepherder rather than the intentional
construct of a prehistoric artist.
The last newly recorded site is classified as a rock art site, although its design
elements are more often considered functional or random. Site 41VV 1145 is a
horizontal shaft cave 120 cm (4 feet) in diameter that extends into the bedrock
low in the wall of Rough Spring Canyon, a major dry tributary of the Devils
River. The entrance is replete with cut marks often construed as sharpening
grooves, dulling grooves, or hide-working scars or, more imaginatively, as Ogam
writing. The cave was at first thought uninhabitable for any length of time due
to its small size and potential for flooding, but test excavations in the mouth of
the cave, carried out after the field school by Michael W. Davis and TAS volunteers, produced lithic debris and dart points characteristic of the Middle and
Late Archaic periods. A probe dug into the interior of the shaft recovered only
one bone fragment of undetermined species and origin. The site has been classified here as rock art because the cut marks extending onto the ceiling and sides
of the shaft must have been executed from a reclining or crouching position, an
unlikely posture for utilitarian activities. Other shaft caves such as this have
proven to be burial vaults where bundled corpses were placed to decompose
naturally (Collins 1969; Turpin 1991b). The cut marks in 41VV1145 fulfill one
criterion for classification as ritual art--redundancy--and suggest that this shaft
had cultural or psychological significance in the ideological system of prehistoric people who inhabited the DRSNA (Turpin 1991b).

1178-1180, 1187-1188, 1240

Fifty-three rockshelters (including nine of the rock art sites discussed above)
have been recorded within the boundaries of the DRSNA, 33 of them by the TAS
(Figure 5). Most are small shelters whose very sparse cultural materials are often
restricted to the talus cones that spill down the canyon in front of the openings. Steep
bluff faces overlooking Dolan Creek are pocked with cavities produced by erosion
and collapse along bedding planes. This series of shelters was occupied with
varying degrees of intensity depending largely on size. Densely occupied sites such
as 41VV922 are often flanked by smaller rockshelters with extremely sparse
cultural deposits.
Another factor affecting the use of available shelters is proximity to water. Sites
such as 41VV871, near the permanent spring in Rough Spring Canyon, manifest
much more diversity and duration of use than is evident in shelters of similar size
that are far from reliable water sources. This obvious correlation suggests that sites

such as 41VV889 and41VV915, where there was an apparent concentration of both
occupation and ritual activity, were once supplied by water sources that are now lost
to increasing regional aridity.
The temporally diagnostic artifacts recovered during the survey of the
rockshelter sites do little to define their periods of occupancy. Only 10 dart points
and arrowpoints of recognizable type and age were collected; this sample includes Middle Archaic Pedernales, Pandale (two), and Langtry (two) dart points;
Late Archaic Ensor (two) ~igure 6), Castroville, and Montell dart points; and
a Perdiz arrowpoint. It should be remembered here that commercial artifact
collecting was one of the advertised attractions of the Dolan Creek Ranch before it was acquired by TPWD. Rockshelters, with their obvious potential for
cultural deposits, would have attracted the attention of hunters who, in their idle
moments, sought relics as well as trophies. The rock art styles in these sites are
also Middle Archaic to Historic in age, reflecting the same broad time periods
as the projectile points. Excavation of two sites, 41VV209 and 41VV889, added
Late Paleoindian artifacts to the rockshelter inventory.
During the course of DRSNA development, TPWD should be aware that
three of the small, sparsely occupied shelters were considered possible burial
locales by the TAS surveyors. This potential could be verified only by testing
sites 41VV920, 41VV1111, and 41VV1132, which is not recommended at this
time. However, although none of these sites outwardly appears attractive to relic
hunters, they should be protected against vandalism. Some vandalism has occurred at all of the larger rockshelters with potentially stratified deposits, but
the information in the remaining deposits at 41VV209, 41VV870, 41VV889,
41VV915, and 41VV922 mandates their special consideration.
Caves
Only two true caves have been recorded in the DRSNA. The largest
underground cavern, Fawcett’s Cave, has been known to spelunkers for decades
and was mapped as part of Deal and Fiesler’s (1975:30) Devils River Natural
Area Survey. The Texas Speleological Society returned to Fawcett’s Cave to
refine their map and to inventory the bat population just before the land was
purchased by the TPWD. Testing of the talus cone during the 1989 field school
yielded human and animal skeletal material and a Frio dart point, confirming
its status as an archeological site, 41VV999. The testing is reported in more
detail below.
A horizontal shaft cave, 41VV1145, was discovered during the field school
low in the wall of upper Rough Spring Canyon. The most obvious evidence of
prehistoric use of this site is the myriad cut marks that surround the 120 cm (4
foot) diameter opening. After the field school, a volunteer crew headed by
Michael W. Davis made several visits to the DRSNA to clear up a few unfinished details and to test the site. The results are reported below (see heading
441V 1145, Horizontal Shaft Cave, Rough Spring Canyon).

1237, 1238, 1241-1245 ¯
These 112 sites, 21 of which had been previously recorded, were classified
primarily according to the nature of the burned rock that defined them. Of these, 71
have one or more burned rock middens, some with accompanying hearths and all
with additional burned rock scatter. An additional 13 sites are characterized by
individual hearths, rather than by middens. In another 28 sites, burned rock is
scattered across the site, but its original configuration can no longer be determined
due to postdepositional disturbances.
The burned rock middens are occasionally associated with rockshelters, tipi
rings, or quarries, but, overall, they are found in three topographic settings--the
banks of intermittent streams, canyon bottoms, and upland divides. This pattem
reflects prehistoric preferences for flat, relatively open cooking areas with easy
access to specific resource zones (Figure 7). Middens and hearths line the banks of
intermittent streams such as Rough Spring Canyon or Dolan Creek and its longer,
less precipitous tributaries, Speed, Jesus, and East canyons. Forty-two burned rock
middens, 12 isolated hearths, and nine burned rock scatters were recorded in the
canyon bottoms. Within this zone, confluences and limestone benches that have
retained enough sediment to provide soft, grass-covered surfaces are favored. The
sites in this setting are often badly disturbed by overbank flooding and by roads that
follow the creeks along these landforms.
The Devils River forms only a small segment of the western perimeter of the
DRSNA, so the TAS survey crew found only two riverine sites, one of which
(41VV974) was tested. However, further surveys along the river made before and
after the field school recorded extremely large camps on both banks of the river at
the mouths of virtually every tributary. The sites often support large oak groves, and,
not surprisingly, modem fishing camps have been built in many of these shady
spots. Most of the sites have also been affected by episodic flooding of the river, but
enough remains of them to confirm that this setting was optimal for long-term and
repetitive habitation throughout prehistory.
An unanticipated finding of the DRSNA survey was the number of large,
complex midden sites found on the high, flat upland divides, remote from the more
obvious sources of permanent water (Figure 7). Twenty-nine burned rock middens,

one isolated hearth, and 18 dispersed scatters were recorded in the upland zone
where only minor topographic influences on their locations were discernible. In four
cases, the middens are directly above small rockshelters, but no direct relationship
can be demonstrated. In another six instances, the middens are adjacent to or on chert
outcrops that provided ready access to raw material for the manufacture of stone
tools. The larger and more complex midden sites may have been so situated as to
take advantage of water in natural potholes (locally called tinajas, pots), depressions that trap water and air-borne sediments that silted them in and obscured their
obvious role in settlement patterns. This source of fill, which has long been used for
raising or repairing ranch roads and the railroad, has resulted in the borrowing and
transport of burned rock to incongruous places. A good example is 41 VV964, where
the silted-in tinajas were emptied to build the nearby airstrip. A similar proximity
to upland water sources, albeit temporary, was noted at 41VV 1075 and 41VV 1076
in the DRSNA.
From the information gathered by the survey, it was found that 49 of the 112
burned rock sites yielded temporally diagnostic tools, which, in turn defined 62
components (Figure 6). Late Archaic styles dominate the projectile point inventory,
identifying 31 sites with components attributable to that time period: 21 from the
Blue Hills subperiod, three from the Flanders subperiod, and seven from the Cibola
subperiod. Four sites had Early Archaic occupations, the Middle Archaic is
represented by 15 San Felipe and two Eagle Nest period components, and there are
five Late Prehistoric components. The assignment of another six sites only to the
general Archaic is based on the recovery of dart point fragments. No preference for
upland or lowland topographic settings during any specific time period was
apparent, other than the obvious association between long-term use and readily
available water, whether it was from springs, rivers, or tinajas. However, the
dominance of Late Archaic Blue Hills types, followed in frequency by Middle
Archaic San Felipe period styles, mirrors the general regional trend demonstrated
by excavations of rockshelters (Turpin 1990c:Figure 10.12) and earlier settlement
pattern studies (Marmaduke 1978; Turpin 1990c:Figure 10.11).
Quarries, Lithic Procurement, and Lithic Reduction Sites

Sites with Middens: 41VV872, 986, 1065, 1109, 1149, 1163
Abundant raw material for the manufacture of stone tools is readily obtainable
from three sources in the Lower Pecos River region: ancient gravel beds now
exposed by erosion, redeposited river gravels, and chert inclusions that are weathering out of the bedrock. In the DRSNA, cobbles and pieces of tabular chert litter
the ground along specific contour lines in Rough Spring Canyon, along Dolan

Turpin and Davis ~ 1989 TAS Field School

Creek, and in the northeastern pastures where short tributaries rapidly descend to the
Dry Devils River (Figure 8)
Procurement of these raw materials was the sole activity at 32 of the recorded
sites; 10 additional sites evidenced lithic reduction directly related to an adjacent
outcrop; six are more complex sites primarily classified as large burned rock
middens related to raw material sources. The distribution map shows that many of
these sites are simply areas of more intense utilization---perhaps of pockets of f’megrained material in the midstofextensive, linear erosionalexposures of chert. The
lithic reduction took place on level benches that provided convenient work areas
near the source material. The typical artifact assemblage includes tested cobbles,
cores, primary flakes, and an occasional crude biface. Temporally diagnostic tools
are lacking, but it can be assumed that these sources were exploited throughout
prehistory.
These 47 sites, and the material recorded at open campsites and rockshelters,
testify to the prolific production of stone implements from the caramel brown local
tabular cherts. The outcrops and the gravels lining the banks of the Devils River
abundantly supplied the inhabitants of the DRSNA with good quality raw material,
eliminating any need for them to curate artifacts or l~ade for stone.
Rock Alignments
41VV880, 1057, 1124, 1131, 1196
Patterned alignments of limestone boulders were the dominant features at four
sites and a minor component at one (Figure 7). The first, 41VV880, was recorded
in 1987 by Turpin and Bement. Two abutting circles of limestone blocks, a burned
rock midden, and a lithic scatter are directly above Rough Spring atop a high ridge
on the narrow divide between Rough Spring Canyon and an unnamed tributary. An
arrowpoint fragment dates one component of the site to the Late Prehistoric period.
Three more stone alignment sites were found during the field school survey.
Site 41VV1057 consists of four rock cairns, two of them aligned north-south and
two aligned east-west, amid a lithic scatter on a promontory next to Jack Branch,
above its confluence with Dolan Creek. A chert outcrop and debitage extend up the
hill, and a sparse burned rock scatter trails down the slope toward the creek. Two
burned and battered Ensor dart points date one occupation of the site to the Late
Archaic period.
On the interfluvial divide between headers of Oliver and Jesus canyons, an oval
course of rocks 25 to 30 cm high was recorded as 41VV 1124. The feature is 2.7
meters long from north to south, and 1.4 meters wide, suggesting that it was once
a cairn that has been disturbed by modern activity. Directly across a ranch road, site
41VV1104 consists of a lithic scatter that may have been connected to the stone
alignment.
A rock oval and an isolated hearth north of the Dolan Creek floodplain in the
mouth of a small south-flowing tributary were recorded as 41VV 1131. This location
deviates from the normal pattern wherein stone alignments are on high promontories.

22

23

Other sites similar to this in setting and configuration are considered sheepherders
camps because of the presence of historic trash---evidence that is lacking at
41VVl131.
In addition, one possible cairn was noted at 41VV1196, a large open campsite
adjacent to Dolan Creek at the mouth of Escondido Canyon. Its function and age are
unknown.
Stone alignments in the Lower Pecos region as a whole can be divided into two
categories: 1) structural remains, including tipi rings, where paired blocks of
limestone supported tent poles or arcs of blocks served to weigh down the
superstructure, and 2) cairns, oblong piles of rocks, that cover or contain burials. Of
course, not all rock piles of prehistoric age can be functionally interpreted, so many
miscellaneous features of unknown use have been recorded. The DRSNA examples
are generally disturbed, and theft original configurations can no longer be accurately reconstructed, but they appear to belong in the first category--structural
remains of temporary dwellings. With the exception of 41VV 1131 and 41VV 1196,
the preference for high promontories expressed in the larger sample from the Lower
Pecos as a whole is seen also in the DRSNA, especially at 41VV880.
Lithic Scatters
41VV501, 981,982, 992, 998, 1056, 1064, 1104, 1122, 1125, 1161, 1236,
1246
By definition, all the burned rock middens, hearths, and scatters and lithic
procurement sites were also designated lithic scatters. After those functional types
are removed, only 13 sites remain in this category. All but one, 41VV1056, are in
the uplands, and only that exception, 41VV1056, is a multicomponent site. This
lithic scatter along East Canyon produced three projectile points, each representing
one of the three Archaic subperiods. Three of the remaining sites were assigned to
the general Archaic period, one to the Early Archaic, and one to the Middle Archaic,
based on dart points recovered during the survey.
Historic Sites
Historic Indian Period
Rock art provides the only evidence of historic Native American occupation of the DRSNA. The iconography of site 41VV1088, described above, is not
typical of any of the defined prehistoric styles and seems more appropriate to a
historic context. Support for this age assignment can be found in two other pictograph panels just outside the boundaries of the DRSNA. At 41VV343, a Spanish colonial scene, complete with church and mustachioed caballero, overlooks
a freshet that pours into Dolan Creek just below the major springs (Marmaduke
and Whitsett 1975:Figure 3; Turpin 1989:Figure 18-3). Directly above Dolan
Springs, at 41VV485, three scenes pair bison and human figures (Turpin
1989:Figure 18-11). In one vignette, the bison is upright and has human feet,
suggesting that it is a dancer. In another, the human is armed with a flintlock,

24

proving its recent date; the third scene is blurred beyond possible decipherment.
In the same vicinity, on the banks of Dolan Creek facing the colonial pictograph,
a metal arrowpoint was collected by the landowner. Although no such evidence
has been found in the DRSNA, these sites do demonstrate a strong historic Native
American presence in the area.
Anglo-American Period
Historic water control structures: 41VV1100, 1106, 1135, 1080, 1234.
Ranch complex: 41VV 1154.
As described in more detail in the section on the historic background, the
Fawcett Ranch exemplifies the westward settlement of Texas, but most of the
early structures were intentionally left outside the DRSNA at the time of purchase by the State. The six historic sites recorded in the DRSNA are all directly
related to stock raising. Four are check dams at the heads of small tributaries,
built in the 1930s as part of a county-wide program of the Soil Conservation
Service. According to John Finegan, a small limestone block structure next to
the dam at 41VVll06 was used to store salt. A fifth water-control site,
41VV1080, is a masonry stock tank.
The central ranch complex, including sheep sheafing barn, stock pens, loading chute, wells, windmill towers, and a scatter of historic artifacts, was recorded
as 41VV1154. The site illustrates the husbandry aspect of the production of wool
and mohair, including the well-preserved ranch water system.
In summary, the historic sites are not significant entities in themselves, but,
as a whole, they illustrate the ranching system put into place by E. K. Fawcett.
The focus on water control underscores the difficulties of ranching in such an
arid environment, but stories told by E. K. Fawcett to his grandchildren describe
a country much different from what we see today (Turpin 1990b). The sheepherders had to drag a log between two horses to flatten the grass that grew so
high the sheep balked. He described Dolan Creek as a meandering stream that
ran between grassy banks, not the scoured and bleached gravel bed seen today.
Floods did not threaten the headquarters on Dolan Creek until well into the 1950s,
after denudation of the landscape by domestic livestock and an increasingly arid
climate.
A human interest thread that ties the features recorded by the field school
to the Fawcett Ranch headquarters is the masonry and concrete work accomplished by Jesus Diaz, who came to work as a ranch hand about 1912 (Finegan,
1989 personal communication). He built all the concrete structures, including
the massive barns, the workers houses, the raised garden plots at the headquarters, and the dams recorded during this survey. After E. K.’s death, when Frances
Fawcett left the ranch and moved to a home in Del Rio, Jesus Diaz retired from
ranch work, but he stayed with the family until his death. His name is perpetuated by Jesus Canyon, a tributary of Dolan Creek that heads partially inside the
DRSNA and flows past the Fawcett ranch headquarters.

TEST EXCAVATIONS
The test excavations undertaken at two rockshelters, two open sites, and two
shaft caves during and after the field school are summarily reported here. Much of
the material recovered is still being analyzed, but overall site assessments are
offered as an aid to TPWD’s area development plans.
41VV209
Limited test excavations were conducted at 41VV209, a large rockshelter that
had been extensively disturbed by pothunters, especially along the rear wall where
burials are often found ~igure 9). TPWD was interested in determining whether
intact cultural deposits remained in the shelter before they backf’tlled the potholes
in order to discourage further looting. The site was originally recorded by Jim
Barkes and first reported by Marmaduke and Whitsett (1975). Kenneth M. Brown
supervised the field school testing and prepared a preliminary report on the
investigations. The following material is excerpted from his report and includes a
geological assessment prepared by S. Chris Caran (Brown 1989).
The site, which consists of three separate overhangs or galleries on the right
side of Dolan Creek, faces east from a vantage point 33 to 36 meters above the
streambed, 1.4 km upslxeam from Dolan Springs. The northern gallery is about 35
meters long, with an overhang of 2 to 5.4 meters and level floor space extending
about 9 meters from the rear wall. The middle gallery is roughly 41 meters long with

Figure 9. Rock art recording crew at work in 41VV209.

26

Texas Archeological Society

an overhang of 3.7 to 5 meters and floor space perhaps 6 meters deep. The southern
gallery is about 29 meters long, with an overhang of 2 to 4.5 meters and a floor space
7.5 meters deep. An unsheltered pour-off between the north and middle galleries
extends for about 10 meters, bringing the total length of the complex to 131 meters.
Although the protected area in each gallery is shallow, the level floors extend well
outside the drip line, creating an expanded living and activity area. The test
excavations were confined to the northern gallery, where a fiber deposit--visible
in a looter’s trench indicated that dry deposits were present ~igure 9). The
investigations focused on these plant remains with a goal of determining their extent
and assessing the integrity of the associated cultural deposits.
Geologic Setting
The lower part of the rear wall of the shelter complex is formed by a dark gray
irregularly bedded stratum of dolostone (rock consisting chiefly of dolomite)
perhaps 80 cm thick that erodes relatively easily, interbedded with more resistant
limestone beds. The top of the gray dolostone bed is marked by a conspicuous dark
red contact line (about 1 to 2 cm thick), which is a thin zone of iron or manganese
enrichment; similar but discontinuous sinuous lines can be seen in the dolostone bed
itself. In the southern gallery, the dolostone bed has a nodular-weathering sugary
texture, forming a low apron with rows of small mortar holes. Above the dolostone
stratum is a receding weathered zone, 60 to 70 cm thick, of spalling limestone that
exfoliates readily into thin roof spalls. Spalling of this zone may be due in part to
differential stress at the contact with the weaker dolostone. Above the spalled
limestone is a zone of massive limestone about 5.3 m thick that forms an inwardsloping face, and above that, about 5 meters of limestone interbedded with beds of
thin nodular chert, forming shallow steplike overhangs. Accessible parts of these
chert beds (especially along the trail to the north) apparently have been tested or
quarried prehistorically, but the chert veins overhead have also contributed a certain
amount of naatrally fractured chert breakdown to the deposits at the site. This was
especially noticeable in the lower levels excavated. A few small pieces of poor
quality petrified wood also were found in screening. These may also be natural
inclusions in the shelter fill; Deal (1975:26) notes that petrified wood occurs in the
Segovia Formation in the Dolan Creek area.
At several places in the north gallery, large slabs of rock have broken away from
the shelter wall in the prehistoric past. These are perhaps more properly termed wall
slabs than roof blocks, for they have separated from the rear wall and cut across the
bedding planes in the bea~ock. In particular, one large slab has broken away from
the rear wall behind the excavation area, and sections of the slab, mostly lying flat,
were found in the excavations about 10 cm below the surface. Whether there was
any rock art on the shelter wall before the slab broke away is unknown, but the
possibility certainly exists that rock surfaces of different ages may have been
available during the occupation. Part of the slab exposed in Unit N200/E100 had
what might have been a small spot of red paint on the upper surface. Two of the flat-

Turpin and Davis m 1989 TAS Field School

27

lying slabs had extensive deposits of fine, pure white crystals on the upper surface,
forming a crust as much as 5 mm thick. Smaller deposits of a pure white talc-like
powder were also found nearby. These deposits formed after the slabs fell and
probably after they were buried by shelter fill.
An unusual feature of the south gallery is a localized partial silification of the
dolostone stratum, which has strengthened it and made it more resistant to erosion,
creating a zone some 30 cm thick that is weathering into angular blocks and prisms.
Field Methods

With a transit, an arbitrary baseline was established in the shelter. Three 1meter squares were triangulated onto the floor from this baseline. A 100-meter
vertical datum point was established by driving a nail into the wall of the shelter, and vertical control was maintained with a transit and stadia rod (when not
hindered by the shelter wall) or line level. All excavated matrix was passed
through quarter-inch and sixteenth-inch mesh screens. With the exception of
burned rock, which was weighed and discarded together with roof spall, all
materials retained on the screens, such as chert, stream-worn pebbles, plant matter
(including twigs, leaves, and charcoal), bone, shell, and insect material, were
returned to the laboratory (Table 2). Excavation of the test pits followed natural
stratigraphy, and three strata were identified.
Stratum 1, the highest stratum, which varied in thickness from 3 to 10 cm in the
three units, consisted of gray limestone dust. The matrix was loose, possibly from
disturbance by recent human and animal traffic. Cultural materials recovered in this
upper lens consisted of debitage, core fragments, edge-modified flakes, distal and
proximal biface fragments, charcoal, bone, mussel shell, and f’tre-cracked rock.
Stratum 2, the fiber bed, varied in thickness from 5 to 14 cm in the areas
excavated. The soil was browner and more compact than in Stratum 1 and contained
a wide variety of economic and noneconomic plant remains. In one test pit, a thin
lens of fiber appeared to be slightly lower than the main deposit of vegetal remains.
Lithic artifacts from this level included large quantities of debitage, a variety of
bifaces, and edge-modified flakes. A limited amount of bone, charcoal, and mussel
shell was also recovered.
Stratum 3 consisted primarily of limestone dust and roof spall. Depending on
the density of the cultural material, the color of the matrix varied from gray to brown
to beige, with a shift from pinkish beige downward to a reddish tinge. Stratum 3 was
distinguished from Stratum 2 by the presence of more charcoal and wood ash. The
full thickness of Stratum 3 was not established, but it is at least 65 cm deep,
necessitating that it be excavated in 10 cm arbitrary levels. The stratum did not
appear to contain any fiber, but chipping debris was abundant, as were edgemodified flakes and biface fragments, especially distal parts. Two mano fragments,
four metate fragments, a scraper, and a bone tool fragment were also recovered from
Stratum 3.
A small pit was identified in Stratum 3 from a concentration of charcoal lumps
and quantities of wood ash. The limits of the pit could not be defined because they

were covered by a large roof-fall block estimated to be about 50 by 70 cm, roughly
oval in plan, and slightly basin shaped at the bottom. The feature was interpreted as
a trash pit that had been filled with hearth debris from other parts of the site. Two
radiocarbon samples were taken from the pit. Two other ash deposits were
identified---one in Stratum 2 and one in Stratum 3--but were not assigned feature
numbers.
Based on the field findings, Brown (1989) offers the following observations.
Significant archeological deposits remain in place in the northern gallery where
cultural debris extends to a depth of 74 cm. The fiber zone and other deposits have
been removed from a zone about 1 to 2 meters wide along the rear wall, but intact
fiber deposits extend at least another 2 meters toward the front of the shelter,
although the front limits of their preservation were not defined by the test excavations. It appears that only one fiber zone, about 5 to 14 cm thick, remains, 5 to 7 cm
below the surface. Although preservation of plant remains is fairly good in S tratum
2, no perishable artifacts, cordage, matting, or modified sticks, were noted. Wood
charcoal was abundant, and samples were taken t0r radiocarbon dating.
The diversity of plant species is very low. Sotol and lecheguilla were not baked
in pits in the shelter, but the manos and mortar holes suggest that some seed
processing was done. The density of chipping debris is high, roughly comparable
to that in Baker Cave. Except for one possible arrowpoint fragment, all diagnostic
artifacts were Late Paleoindian to Middle Archaic in age (Figure 10). The low
diversity of plant species and the artifact assemblage suggests that 41VV209 was
a limited activity site.
An apparent decrease in the ratio of silt and clay to limestone dust with
decreasing depth may indicate a diminishing eolian component during the accumulation of deposits throughout the Holocene. Pronounced reddish tints at depth may
also be related to these eolian processes. An increase in small fish bones and snail
shells was also noted deep in one unit.
If more work is done at 41VV209, it should include extending the testing in the
northern gallery to find the eastern limits of the fiber zone, testing in the middle and
southern galleries, and collection of a pollen profile and bulk soil samples for
particle-size analysis. Testing has demonstrated that there is significant information
about prehistory in the DRSNA locked in the deposits that remain at 41VV209 and
that protection of these deposits is warranted.
41VV889, Small Shelter
High on a tributary of Rough Spring Canyon, this small rockshelter was
once one of the most extensive pictograph sites in the DRSNA, but few of the
multicolored figures are still decipherable. Amid the blur of pigment that covers
the entire rear wall are elements characteristic of Pecos River style pictographs,
the oldest of Lower Pecos pictographs. Less than 50 meters away, on the same
small drainage, 41VV888 is the best-preserved pictograph site in the project area.
There, four Pecos River style shaman figures, a Red Linear scene, and other

curvilinear designs were painted on a bleached expanse of the canyon wall under
a shallow overhang. No cultural deposits remain in 41VV888, but the pictographs
were probably painted by the same people who lived at one time in 41VV889.
The obvious intensity of prehistoric use of these sites led to extensive documentation by the rock art recording crew and testing under the direction of Jim Word
and May Schmidt as part of the 1989 field school.

Both 41VV888 and 41VV889 formed under the rim of a small tributary in
the dense, hard-surfaced Devils River limestones common to the DRSNA. Local variation in the composition of the bedrock is apparent in the configuration
of rockshelters and in weathering patterns here and at sites such as 41VV209
and 41VV921 along Dolan Creek. Although natural rock decay is always a threat
to rock art, the blocky exfoliation and weak structure of the Dolan Creek sites
is much less apparent at 41VV888, 41VV889, and nearby 41VV915. In addition, these sites are rounded hollows rather than the shallow linear galleries that
dominate the streamside shelters in the DRSNA. Thus, geology plays a major
role in the differential preservation of rock art and in the size and configuration
of the occupied shelters.
When 41VV889 was recorded in 1988, evidence of past relic hunting there
consisted of two depressions, a screen, and a broken shovel, but most of the deposits
a~ed to be intact. The field school crew excavated four 1-by-l-meter units in
10 cm arbitrary levels (Figure 11); the matrix was screened through quarter-inch
mesh innovatively provided by suspending the pothunter’ s reconstructed screen by
rope from above the entrance to the shelter. The site was also mapped and surfacecollected, and the excavations and pictographs were photographed.
Temporally diagnostic projectile points, ranging in age from a Plainviewlike base to arrowpoints (Figure 12, Table 3), confmn the long-term occupation
of the site. Unfortunately, the vertical sequence could not be separated into
components, probably because of the shallowness of the deposits, the sequential
but intermittent occupation of the site, and the later activities of relic hunters.
The shallowness of the deposits also provided a poor preservational environment for normally perishable items, so lithic artifacts make up the bulk of the
inventory (Table 4). Copious debitage indicates that the final reduction or rejuvenation of stone tools was a major activity. Utilized flakes, unifacial and bifacial tools, and the projectile points testify to procurement activities conducted
from a base in this small site. Use-wear analysis identified tools used in scraping (n=58), cutting (n=39), and perforating (n=l), but the specific material processed by only four artifacts could be determined. One uniface was used to scrape
hides, and four tools (three utilized flakes and an end scraper) showed evidence
that they were used for cutting and scraping plants. Two of the latter--the scraper
and one utilized flake--had the high silica sheen that is characteristic of plantprocessing tools.
The intensive use of this small part of the DRSNA, including this rockshelter,
nearby 41VV888, and an open campsite on the flats above, suggests that an upland
water source, no longer obvious, was available at least intermittently during all the
broad periods of prehistory. The bedrock depressions at the Windmill Midden
nearby are a possibility. However, the field crew at 41VV889 noted that some
water-loving plants were growing against the wall of the shelter, suggesting that
during periods of high ground moisture, seep springs may have attracted people to
this small site and its environs, which were an optimal location for exploitation of
the canyon resources below and of the upland habitat above.

41VV964, Windmill Midden Site
On the broad, flat interfluvial divide between the heads of tributaries of Rough
Spring Canyon, Jane Hollow, and Escondido Canyon, a dense scatter ofbumedrock
and flint debris surrounds a borrow pit that supplied caliche for construction of the
adjacent airstrip. Directly north of the borrow pit is a second depression now filled

almost to the top with fine-grained sediments. The correlation between burned rock
middens and caliche pits is a common one that can be attributed to two circumstances: the soft, level surfaces of the Del Rio Clay flats were preferred camp sites
throughout prehistory, and natural depressions, or tinajas, now f’dled with wind- and
water-borne sediments, were special attractions that might well have increased the
duration or frequency of camping episodes. In other words, the caliche flats were
exploited prehistorically and historically for two very different reasons; the historic
land use often obliterated the evidence of prehistoric occupation.
Despite the obvious disturbances wrought by construction of the windmill,
the stone tank, and the airstrip, this site was selected for excavation to explore
the possibility that the caliche borrow pit was once a reservoir that held rain
water and attracted task groups to this site where they processed vegetal resources
gathered on the broad flat divide. A similar relationship between intensively
occupied burned rock midden sites and casual water sources was later recorded
by the TAS survey crew at 41VV1075 and 41VV1076.

In addition, occupation of this midden site may be related to the intensive use
of nearby rockshelter 41VV889, reported above. If the presence of a spring in the
41VV889 canyon is discounted, the Windmill Midden tinaja is the closest known
source of water for the inhabitants of several sites on this interfluvial divide.
Under the direction of Brownie Roberts and Bill Chandler, seven contiguous
1-by-l-meter units that formed a linear strip and two isolated squares were
excavated in the least disturbed part of the site, southwest of the tinaja borrow pit
(Figure 13). Maximum depth was 24 cm, with some of the units reaching bedrock
at 10 to 20 cm below the surface. All material was screened through quarter-inch
mesh; only one feature, a probable hearth, was uncovered.
The temporally diagnostic artifacts recovered here reflect episodic use of this
location during the Early Archaic period, which is represented by one projectile
point, a Baker dart point (Figure 14, f), the Late Archaic, which is represented by
five dart point fragments, and the Late Prehistoric, which is evidenced by three
arrowpoint fragments (Figure 14, a-e). The absence of Middle Archaic-age projectile points may well be due to sampling error, considering the small area of the site
that was excavated. The remainder of the artifact assemblage reflects expedient tool
use for the same broad variety of purposes seen in the inventory from 41VV889
(Table 5). The obvious conclusion is that the Windmill Midden is the result of
episodic task-oriented exploitation of this upland flat at times when water was
available in the tinajas.

41VV974 :Spring Midden
The largest group of excavators concentrated on the Spring Midden, 41VV974-a large buried open campsite on an alluvial terrace on the left bank of Dolan Creek,
200 meters above Dolan Springs--and Yellow Bluff, about 1.5 km above the
confluence with the Devils River ~igure 15). Norman Flaigg was field supervisor
of the excavations, and Paul Lorrain led the youth group.

Turpin and Davis m 1989 TAS Field School

Figure 15. Photograph showing the youth group at work at 41VV974.

The terrace that is now part of site 41 VV974 was for a time the location of the
Dolan Creek Ranch commercial camping facility, which was complete with
underground utilities. The site was identified from dense quantities of lithic debris
and burned rock that were exposed in the cutbank of a dirt road leading from the
campground to the major pool formed by Dolan Springs. Cultural material had been
reported at each of the commercial campsites during installation of the utilities. The
site was excavated because TPWD needed a basis for making informed decisions
on the future use of this camping area and the road to the spring.
Excavations at Spring Midden were confined to the extreme south end of the
area in order to avoid as much as possible disruption of underground utilities and
of the habitat of the black-capped vireo. The excavation units were placed above the
erosional cut created by vehicular traffic, for the area was known to be rich in buried
cultural debris, including burned rock, ashy soil, charcoal, and chipped and ground
stone artifacts.
Fifteen 1-meter squares were excavated by the adults and 3150-cm units by the
youth group. The test pits were scattered over an area measuring 26 meters north to
south by 27 meters east to west; their locations were triangulated from north-south
and cast-west baselines established by the transit. Units were identified by grid
coordinates measured from a primary datum point--N50/W100--at the south end
of the terrace. A permanent vertical datum was a nail driven into a large oak tree that
dominated the western excavation area and provided welcome shade for certain
fortunate excavators. Elevations were controlled with line levels attached to unit
corners at ground level and were verified by transit readings at the bottoms of levels;

40

vertical control was in 10-cm increments. The matrix was screened through quarterinch mesh, and a limited amount of fill was fine-screened through sixteenth-inch
mesh. Most of the excavation was done with trowels and shovels, though it was
necessary to use picks in particularly hard-packed areas. Profiles of selected test pits
were drawn at the close of fieldwork.
The excavations exposed the remains of an intensive occupation in a lens that
ranged in thickness from 20 to 50 cm. The densest accumulations of burned rock
were in the southern part of the excavation area near the edge of the terrace. The
midden zone consisted of black clay loam that contained a wide variety of chipped
stone tools, considerable quantities of debitage and charcoal, and limited amounts
of mussel shell, snails, and bone (Table 6). Above the midden zone, prehistoric
cultural materials were in a thick dark brown clay. Below the midden zone was a
gray sandy matrix, ranging from 15 to 30 cm in thickness, and cultural debris that
decreased with depth. Absent from this zone were the abundant fire-fractured
limestone rocks found in the midden zone. A clearly identifiable, culturally sterile,
coarse-grained yellow sand with rounded gravels and cobbles was encountered
below the gray sand. A single 20-cm-square shovel test was excavated 65 cm into
this yellow sand zone, but the single flake and few chips that were recovered can be
attributed to downward displacement by bioturbation. All of the soils at the site are
alluvial in origin and were deposited on the site by overbank flooding of Dolan
Creek.
Aside from the burned rock midden along the south edge of the excavation area,
only one feature was documented--aloose concentration of burned limestone rocks
in Level 2 of Unit N59/W 101 (midden zone) was identified as a hearth remnant. The
feature was surrounded by loose, ashy midden soil flecked with charcoal. Secondary and tertiary flakes, chips, and several pieces of heat-shattered chert were
recovered from the level.
The variety in the projectile point inventory demonstrates that the site contains
multiple buffed prehistoric components and has been occupied for several millenia.
The Late Prehistoric Period is represented by Perdiz arrowpoints (Figurel6, a, b).
Occupation during the Late Archaic is indicated by the recovery of Ensor, Fairland,
and Frio-like dart points (Figure 16, c-e), and an Early Archaic component is
represented by an extensively reworked dart point that has morphological
characteristics similar to Bell (Figurel6, f). The absence of Middle Archaic
specimens is curious but may be attributable to sampling error. The vertical
positioning of these temporally diagnostic artifacts indicates that this part of the site
is stratified and apparently undisturbed (Table 6). This observation is strengthened
by the absence of recent or historic materials below Level 1, despite the intensive
use of the area in modern times. Unfortunately, because no unit was more than 80
cm deep and many contacted sterile matrix at 50 to 60 cm below the surface,
separation of components or identification of particular assemblages in the inventory
of artifacts would be difficult. Apparently this part of the terrace has long been a
stable landform where very little deposition has occurred. Many other chipped stone
artifacts were recovered during the exeavation---edge-modified flakes (by retouch

and utilization), a variety of thick and thin bifaces, scrapers, and unifaces (Figure
16, g-l, Table 6). These formal tools, as well as the projectile points, were
distributed throughout all levels of the excavation, indicating that the site’s
inhabitants were involved in diverse but similar activities--hunting, gathering, and
processing--throughout the history of the site.
Lithic debitage is the most common artifact recovered in all levels of the
excavation, indicating that lithic reduction was one of the primary activities in the

area tested. Most of the inventory consists of tertiary and secondary flakes and
decorticate chips, but cores and thick bifaces are also present. Samples recovered
by fine screening from several levels in various test units yielded only minimal
quantifies of small bifacial thinning flakes, indicating that much of the final
knapping apparently was being done in other areas of the site.
The Spring Midden typifies the patterning of large open campsites along the
Devils River in optimal resource zones. The stately oaks that surround the campground are but a vestige of the dense groves of hardwood trees described by early
settlers. The site overlooks the largest and most reliable spring in the area and would
be expected to have been occupied throughout prehistory. The wide range of
activities illustrated by the artifact inventory is compatible with a reliable resource
base that probably would have encouraged long-duration habitation. These test
excavations have served to demonstrate the archeological significance of the Spring
Midden, both in terms of its information potential and its special role in the overall
settlement patterns of this region.
Fawcett’s Cave, 41VV999
Fawcett’s Cave is a well-known geologic feature, explored, mapped and
studied by the Texas Speleological Society (TSS) (TSS files) and described for the
Devils River Natural Area survey by Deal and Fieseler (1975). The cave extends
under the divide between Horseshoe Bend Canyon and Jane Hollow, north of the
Horseshoe Bend of the Dry Devils River in the heart of the densely utilized upland
flat near excavated sites 41VV964 and 41VV889. Important geologic features are
found in six mapped galleries more than 2,450 feet (750 meters) long and dropping
to as much as 110 feet (33 meters) below the surface. Although the entrance, a round
opening in the limestone bedrock, is less than a meter in diameter, the massive talus
cone in the cave beneath it is at least 10 meters high and 10 meters wide. The cave
is also a bat sanctuary, so the downslope side of the talus is slick with guano.
Fawcett’s Cave mirrors on a much grander scale the configuration of Seminole
Sink, a vertical shaft cemetery in Seminole Canyon State Historical Park, where
Early Archaic and Late Prehistoricskeletal material was excavated in 1984 (Turpin
1988). Before TPWD acquired the cave, and, in conjunction with a TSS bat census
field trip, David G. Robinson excavated a 1 -by- 1-meter test unit on the slope of the
talus cone beneath the entrance hole. Among the faunal remains recovered was a
fragment of a long bone shaft that resembled a human tibia. Further testing of this
enormous talus cone was carded out under the supervision of Leland C. Bement
during the field school to ascertain whether the site was archeologically as well as
biologically and speleologically significant. The following summary of site testing
is based on Bement’s field report.
The testing presented several logistical problems that were resolved by the use
of equipment of proven utility at other sinkhole burial sites. A heavy steel bar placed
across the entrance held a pulley for hoisting matrix from the depths of the cave, and
a cable ladder suspended from a frame below the entrance led to an extension ladder

44

Texas Archeological Society

set against the massive breakdown blocks. A portable generator on the surface
provided electricity for lighting. All materials that accumulated near the opening
each day had to be removed at the close of work lest they impede the evening bat
flights.
Two 1-by-l-meter units were excavated in 10 cm levels (Figure 17), and
the matrix was bagged and removed to the work station at the Windmill Midden
site (41VV964) where it was water-screened through window screen-sized mesh.
Unit A was in the drop zone directly below the entrance in a narrow, rock-strewn
crawl space affectionately called the Antechamber. Recovery was limited to faunal remains, including bones of porcupine, rattlesnake, deer, and hundreds of
bats of the species Myotis velifer, the common cave bat that still inhabits the
sinkhole. This unit was terminated at 40 cm.

Unit B was near the base of the talus cone beneath a zone of large breakdown blocks (Figure 17). A discrepancy between compass readings and magnetic north as shown on the 1961 TSS map could not be reconciled, but the field
school map (Figure 17) shows the locations of both units in relation to the outstanding speleological feature in this part of the cave--a white flowstone drape
15 feet (4.6 meters) tall known as The Ghost of Fawcett’s Cave. The remains of
at least two large deer were removed from the surface of and around Unit B.
Included in a quantity of animal bone removed as Level 1 was one human finger bone, recovered during water screening. A second human bone, a metatarsal
identified in Level 2, confirmed the archeological nature of the cave deposit.
The crew broke through the flowstone at the bottom of Level 2 and obtained
from Level 3 a sample of Pleistocene-age fauna, including camelid, turtle, deer,
and the ubiquitous bat. The unit was abandoned on contact with an impenetrable
flowstone sheet at the base of Level 3, beyond the range of possible human use
of the cave. The only artifact recovered during this investigation was a complete Frio dart point found on the surface of the talus cone (Figure 14, 1).
This testing program demonstrated that Fawcett’s Cave is an archeological site
with the potential to yield significant information about regional mortuary practices
and human health, diet, and physical characteristics. The camelid remains recovered from Level 3 of Unit B also suggest that the cave may be of paleontological
importance. The talus cone is a fragile environment for these osteological remains
unless traffic from the nearby entrance is controlled. These test excavations should
help TPWD plan for future exploration and protection of both the cultural and
natural resources of Fawcett’s Cave.
41VVl145, Horizontal Shaft Cave, Rough Spring Canyon
Limited testing of 41VV 1145, recorded during the field school, was conducted
by a group of TAS volunteers during the 1989 Thanksgiving weekend. The site is
a horizontal shaft cave in the bottom of Rough Spring Canyon, 4.3 km above its
confluence with the Devils River. Formed by ground water action, this solution
cavity was exposed in the vertical canyon wall by stream downcutting (Figure 18).
The cave was first documented as a rock art site because many apparently
random straight lines have been incised into the bedrock on the gently sloping floor,
sides, and roof inside the opening (Figures 18, 19). Its small size and the likelihood
of frequent flooding precluded extensive habitation, but it seems highly probable
that it was used as a ritual or sacred location. Testing was undertaken to determine
whether the cave held human burials and to identify the activities that may have
produced the cut-marks and lithic debris in the antechamber.
The cave entrance is 2.2 meters high and 2.7 meters across at the mouth, and
the floor is about a meter above the creek bed. The antechamber extends about 3
meters into the bedrock before the upward slope of the floor begins to constrict it.
At 5 meters, the shaft is reduced to a low, horizontal tunnel, ranging from 30 to 50
cm in height and 60 to 90 cm in width, for 27 meters, where the crawl space is
blocked by sediments that have filled the tunnel.

46

Texas Archeological Society

Figure 18. Photograph showing cut marks around the entrance to the horizontal shaft cave,
41VVl145.

The loose f’fll that covered the floor just inside the mouth of the cave was
removed to determine whether additional cut-marks may have been buried when
material slumped from the mound of dirt that extends from the middle of the
antechamber to the mouth of the small tunnel. Not only were more grooves exposed,
but ~reening also produced a considerable number of chipped stone artifacts.
Two contiguous test pits were excavated in the front part of the cave. Test
Pit 1, a 1-meter square, was laid out in the center of the mounded deposit, with
one edge paralleling the profile that had been exposed by cleaning out the loose
fill. Test Pit 2 extended the grid-east wall of Test Pit 1 to the curving wall of the
cave, a distance of roughly 75 to 90 cm. Both were dug in arbitrary 10 cm levels, and all matrix was screened through quarter-inch hardware cloth.
Excavation revealed that 30 to 40 cm of prehistoric cultural material is buried
in a dark gray sediment deposited in the front of the cave by backwash flooding.
The depth of deposits increases toward the rear of the antechamber, reaching
perhaps 80 cm near the mouth of the tunnel. Temporally diagnostic projectile
points, typed as Ensor, Frio-like, and Val Verde (Figure 14, i-k), were recovered from these test pits (Table 7), indicating that the site was used from the
Middle to Late Archaic. Lithic chipping debris was the largest artifact category,
but a few chipped stone tools, a mano fragment, and bone, charcoal, and burned
rock were recovered.
A third test unit, 50 cm square, was excavated in the tunnel at an arbitrary
point 2.5 meters from its entry, where the unit was readily accessible and matrix

could be moved from it out to the screens. The top of the first 20-cm level, Level
1, contained quantities of recent decaying organic materials--bone and teeth-all byproducts of sheep, goats, and small animals that used the cave, and a small
amount of lithic debris and charcoal. Level 2 yielded bone, charcoal, and lithic
debris. From the bottom of Level 2 to bedrock at 78 cm, only one bone fragment and one lump of charcoal were recovered.
This very limited testing program produced no evidence of human burials
in the shaft cave, but so little of the tunnel area was sampled that these findings
are not conclusive. The lithic debris found in the upper level of the one test pit
in the tunnel may have been redeposited by flood waters from the larger entrance chamber. The more substantial cultural deposits in the antechamber demonstrate that the cave was used for maintenance activities, but the low rate of
deposition makes separation of temporal components difficult. The intensity of
occupation apparently was not sufficient to have produced the dense concentration of incised lines, from either tool manufacturing or hide processing, suggesting that a nonutilitarian explanation is more appropriate.

ROCK ART RECORDING

Another task undertaken by TAS in 1989 was the accurate recording of both
previously recorded and recently discovered rock art sites in the DRSNA. The
call for preservation of the famous rock paintings of the Lower Pecos region has
echoed through the literature for more than 50 years (Jackson 1938), but the
myriad sources of deterioration, from both natural decay and human intervention, have impeded any major conservation programs (Silver 1985; Turpin 1982).
Detailed recording is emerging as the most important task in rock art research
(Smits 1990) because of the lack of technical means of preserving the paintings
and the prohibitive cost of protecting them from further deterioration. Long-time
photographic recorder of Lower Pecos rock art, Jim Zintgraff, donated his services to the project, photographing the most well-preserved pictographs in the
DRSNA and vicinity. In his 30 years of experience, Zintgraff has developed a
special system for photographing rock art, using polarized flashes and filters,
and a large-format camera to produce excellent color reproductions.
Since the dolomitic limestones of the Devils River area, especially those
along Dolan Creek, tend to fracture and powder, they provide a poor surface for
the preservation of paintings. Weathering has dimmed the once vibrant colors,
and mineral accretions have both obscured many elements and accelerated exfoliation. The DRSNA pictographs vary in their clarity, so reconstruction is
necessary if the entire range of the iconography is to be documented. An alternative to photography--the one used in the Lower Pecos by the most famous
rock art recorder in Texas, Forrest Kirkland (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967)-is water-color scale copies. They are sometimes criticized as being prone to
artistic bias, but drawings allow for some reconstruction of the artist’s intent,
especially if the copyist is intimately familiar with the topics, conventions, and
techniques of the various styles. In the DRSNA, all the pictographs belong to
the Pecos River style (the most ancient art [Figures 2, 3]), the Red Linear style
(a Late Archaic miniature art form), or the Historic period (differentiated by the
introduction of motifs from European or Plains cultures [Figure 4]).
The TAS responded to the urgent need for renderings of the DRSNA rock
art by fielding a special team of artists and photographers (Figure 9). Led by
Teddy Stickney, this crew recorded pictographs at rockshelters 41VV207,
41VV209, 41VV888, 41VV889, 41VV921, and 41VV1088 during the field
school ~obinson 1989). Later, on weekends and holidays, these volunteers
continued the documentation by copying remnant figures in 41VV527 and
41VV915.
The procedures used and refined by the rock art crew were drawn up by
artist Nola Montgomery, of TPWD; they were tested during the field school for
broader application to other endangered pictograph sites on state-owned lands.
David G. Robinson, of TARL, who has been producing illustrations of rock art
for the past ten years, contributed his experience in the reconstruction of badly
deteriorated images.

The first step in the recording process is to lay a 1-meter baseline along the
bottom curvature of the rear wall of the shelter to permit the accurate recording of
the provenience and relationships of the individual figures. The designs are
sketched and described on a preliminary map on graph paper referred to the
measured base line. Overlapping black-and-white and 35 mm color photographs are
then taken to cover each section of the panel (each photograph includes color and
tone correction charts and a scale). Slow color film, such as color positive or slide
film, requires the use of a tripod, but is preferred because of its fine texture.
Each scene is then copied in pencil onto graph paper, using the most convenient
scale. A transparent plastic grid is sometimes superimposed on the larger paintings
to provide a guide for proportions and relationships. Water color copies are made,
using a color palette matched to the earth tones of the mineral pigments used in the
pictographs.
TPWD plans to use the techniques and method~ developed at the field school
in documenting the rock art in other parks, most notably sites that were not copied
during a survey of Seminole Canyon State Historic Park and the newly recorded
pictographs at Big Bend Ranch State Natural Area. The one cautionary note
introduced by a review of the copies produced during the field school is the oftrepeated criticism of artistic bias. It is imperative that reconstruction of faded or
deteriorated rock art be done by artists who are well versed in the regional styles.
There is no room for artistic license in this type of documentation, but restricting the
copiers to reproducing only the paint that remains on the walls today results in
images that bear little resemblance to the original drawings or the intent of the
prehistoric artist.
DISCUSSION OF FIELD SCHOOL FINDINGS

The major accomplishments of the 1989 field school contributed to three of the
TAS’s primary goals: conservation of resources, education, and research. In
conservation of resources, the identification or reassessment of 239 archeological
sites on the newly acquired State property provided the Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department with a management tool, saving them hundreds of thousands of dollars
and considerable time and effort. More specific testing programs at six sites gave
the TPWD information about previously unknown paleontological deposits, possible mortuary sites, and ritual behavior, and advised them of the importance of both
rockshelters and open camp sites.
From an educational perspective, the emphasis on broad area survey exposed
many of the participants to recording methods that had not been addressed in most
of the previous TAS field schools. This field school also launched the rock art
recording crew, an endeavor that has taken on a life of its own as a formal organized
activity of the TAS that now extends far beyond the boundaries of the DRSNA
(Robinson 1989).
Finally, the comparative data gathered by this large area survey permit
refinement of regional settlement patterns on the Devils River that previously had

Turpin and Davis ~ 1989 TAS Field School

51

been based largely on information gathered on the Rio Grande and the Pecos River.
One major difference from the Rio Grande and the Pecos, seen in the DRSNA and
corroborated by subsequent surveys, is the dearth of large, deep rockshelters along
the Devils River. The few exceptions, such as Baker Cave, Big Satan Canyon, and
Skyline Shelter, were obviously intensively utilized throughout prehistory. Most of
the rockshelters in this area are small or structurally weak shallow overhangs that
provided only limited protection, so there was less intensive occupation, shallower
deposits, more disturbance of the strata, and poorer preservation. The equivalent of
Pecos River rockshelters, in terms of intensity of occupation, may be the enormous
open camps that line both banks of the Devils River and are concentrated at the
mouths of the major tributaries where several different resource zones meet.
The tendency of the limestone bedrock to exfoliate has drastically affected the
preservation of rock art along the Devils River, but enough remains to detect
regional differences within the various styles. Sites in the DRSNA have at least two
examples (41VV207 and 41VV209) of the Devils River variation on the typical
Pecos River style feline theme. At 41VV207 and at other sites down river, the cigarshaped mountain lions are painted high on the shelter walls above other figures. The
Devils River artists were also more likely to conventionalize human figures into
miniature parabolic bodies with upraised stubby arms, usually lining up several in
a row (Figure 20).
The recording of many middens on the upland fiats is another contribution of
the field school to clarification of Lower Pecos settlement patterns. Along the Rio
Grande, the Pecos River, and on the extreme lower reaches of the Devils River,
remnant outcrops of Buda Limestone form rounded hills surrounded by fiat surfaces
of Del Rio Clay. The prehistoric people preferred open campsites on these fiat
surfaces as long as they were near the heads of rapidly entrenching tributaries.
Inevitably, therounded hills of BudaLimestone are fringedby burned rock middens
and hearth fields composed of t~tpavements of burned rock and dense lithic debris.
However, in the DRSNA, and in general along the Devils River above Big Satan
Canyon, the Buda Limestone has completely eroded away, so this setting is not
represented in the inventory of sites. But, in all three river systems, burned rock
middens and scatters line the gentler reaches of the tributaries, especially at
confluences with other minor drainageways. The more rapid entrenchment of
canyons along the Pecos and Rio Grande is reflected in the lower frequency of sites
in the lower stretches where the walls limit the living space. Upland middens in the
Pecos and Rio Grande survey areas are concentrated along the rims of the major
river valleys and around the heads of plunging tributaries, where steep dropoffs
often create tinajas that hold rain water. In the DRSNA, middens and open campsites
are most frequently seen on the upland fiats near springs, the heads of minor
drainageways or natural depressions that served as rainwater reservoirs. Many of
these upland tinajas are now filled with sediment that masks the role they played in
settlement strategies.
A less obvious, but nevertheless important, environmental response to differences in topography is illustrated by the relationship of site types to landforms along

the three rivers. The Pecos canyon is relatively narrow and deeply entrenched, with
sheer cliffs broken only by tributary streams that have formed their own equally
steep-sided canyons. Although the Rio Grande has a much broader floodplain with
terraces suitable for open campsites along much of its course, access from the
riverine floodplain to upland resources is restricted to the avenues provided by the
tributaries. The many hanging tributaries, formed where their downcutting has not
kept pace with the entrenchment of the river, have formed cliffs that block transit
between the two drainageways, limiting settlement on these floodplains.
Although massive bluffs loom over the lower Devils River, the cliffs alternate with gentler, sloping valley wails, creating an undulating terrain. Typically,
the slopes are stepped, rising in three tiers from the river bed to the bluff top.
The distance between the streams and the upland flats is greater where the slopes
are stepped than where the cliffs are steep, but travel on the uplands was not
restricted to the drainages or the occasional breaks in the cliff line. These differences in elevation influenced site selection, with the result that open campsites
fringe the canyon rims along the Pecos and Rio Grande, where there was better
access to resources. Reliance by inhabitants of the Devils River area mainly on
open campsites that are scattered across the broad upland flats may have been
due in partto the scarcity of habitable shelters along the streams and in part to
the abundance of springs. In addition, these upland locations were free from the
constraints imposed by limited accessibility.
The differences in distribution of site types between the Pecos and Devils
rivers are of importance in studies of settlement patterns where the causal, or
deterministic, effect of environment as Opposed to the effect of culture has long
been argued. In the Lower Pecos, it is possible to see the effects of both environment and culture as settlement preferences changed over time and space. The
environmental constraints discussed above are obvious, since they operated directly upon the basic human needs for water, food, and shelter, but several equally
effective options were part of this broad adaptation to the topography, hydrology, and biota of the region.
The effect of cultural selection on site distributional patterns in the Lower
Pecos region is best illustrated by several changes that first become evident in the
Late Prehistoric period, when rock art, which presumably is not overly influenced
by environmental factors, was painted in a different style and in different places.
Similarly, after a long tradition of interment of the dead in rockshelters, caves,
and sinkholes, cairn burial emerged in the Late Prehistoric period as another
choice of mortuary practice. Despite the availability of rockshelter homes, intrusive people apparently preferred open camps on high promontories, where they
erected the circular rock structures that identify the Infierno phase. Still later, in
the historic Native American period, acquisition of the horse produced yet another shift in site selection, favoring campsites that were more accessible to water
holes and grazing land.
In summary, the 1989 TAS Field School produced data that made possible
the first comparisons of settlement patterns in subregions within the relatively

54

Texas Archeological Society

well defined Lower Pecos cultural area. The survey identified several environmental factors that affected prehistoric use of the landscape. Most obvious are
the distribution of permanent and casual water sources, the availability of
rockshelter habitation, and accessibility among diverse resource zones. The
human element is most apparent in the various options exercised by the people
whose cultural preferences are expressed by where they lived, how they buried
their dead, and what they considered worthy of commemoration in their art.

Archeological Excavations at the Overseer’s House,
the Eagle Island Plantation, Brazoria County, Texas

ABSTRACT
During 1984 and 1985 the Brazosport Archaeological Society investigated
a house site on the former Eagle Island Plantation, in the present town of Clute in
Brazoria County, Texas. The excavations exposed parts of the brick foundations
of a rectangular building, an outbuilding, and a cistern. We concluded that the
rectangular building was the home of the overseer and his family because it was
beside the elevated roads leading to the main house, fields, slave quarters, sugar
mill, and river landing, and the earliest (late 1830s) residential artifacts recovered
were there. The house was later occupied by one or more working class farm
families, probably black tenant farmers, until sometime after 1875, when it was
abandoned as a residence and became a storage and dump site.

DISCOVERY
In December 1983 the Brazosport Archaeological Society, at the request of the
Brazoria County Historical Commission, located the earliest Wharton family
cemetery (Daughters of the American Revolution in Texas 1965; Pollan 1984). A
map (Figure 1), drawn in 1958 by Sarah Wharton Groce Berlet, shows the muchsought-after cemetery on the north side of Eagle Lake (called Wharton Lake by
members of the Wharton family). A very similar map is shown in Autobiography
OfA Spoon (Berlet 1971:75). A larger-scale drawing of the area (Figure 2), also by
Sarah W. G. Berlet, shows a sugarhouse on the shore of Bend Lake and also indicates
that the house was built in 1828. The property is owned by Restwood Memorial
Park, Inc., and since they are interested in learning the history of their property, the
Brazosport Society began its search for the cemetery with their cooperation.
During the investigation, Jay Luce, assistant manager of the cemetery, told the
authors that there was a cistern in a nearby field the cemetery had purchased for
future expansion. Excavation of the site became a major objective of the Society
since the property was to be developed in the near future, since the Brazosport
Society needed a nearby site for training Society members in archeological
techniques, and, most of all, since knowledge of nineteenth century plantations in
Brazoria County--known as the Cradle of Texas History--was almost nonexistent.
Just northeast of the large open cistern, which was found in the field, was
a low undulating mound. Upon investigation, we also discovered the remains of

an old road with ditches on both sides that passed by the site in the direction of
the old sugar mill. Large pecan trees (the largest about three feet in diameter)
were growing in the middle of this old road segment, and several large black
walnut (Juglans nigra) trees were growing beside it. Black walnut is not generally native to the area, but is occasionally found near older plantation home sites,
together with camphor trees (Cinnamomum camphora), which were often planted
by settlers. Several patches of St. Augustine grass, which thrives in rich organic
soil, were found in the field, so some of these grass areas were tested superficially with a metal detector, which revealed the presence of many metal objects.
Subsequent shovel tests proved that most of the metal objects detected were
square nails. None of these outlying areas was tested further, but it was assumed
that these areas of nails were once the sites of other buildings. The low mound
that covered the remnants of structures and the cistern have together been designated 41BO143, Site B, which was excavated by the Brazosport Archaeological Society during 1984 and 1985.
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The Eagle Island Plantation site in Brazoria County is in a hardwood forest
about 12 miles from the Gulf of Mexico (Figure 3). Most of the few sloping areas
in the site are adjacent to the Brazos River and Oyster Creek. Remnants of past
stream meanders are preserved in the many oxbow lakes in the region.
The many varieties of fauna and native flora in the area were exploited as food
sources. The major animal species found in this forest habitat today are squirrels,
deer, swamp rabbits, fur-bearing animals, and a great variety of birds. Archeological data indicate thatRangia clams, fish, alligators, turtles, birds, bison, and rodents
were the animals most often utilized by the area’s prehistoric inhabitants (Ambler
1967:69).
According to the Soil Survey Of Brazoria County (U.S. Soil Conservation
Service 1981), Brazoria County is in the West Gulf Coast subdivision of the
Atlantic and Gulf Plains geomorphic province. The subsurface sediments dip
gently gulfward and are of Holocene or Pleistocene age. The two major soils in
the former plantation are Asa silty clay loam and Pledger clay. Asa silty clay
loam is a nonsaline soil with slopes averaging about 0.3 percent, and with a surface layer of neutral, very dark grayish brown silty clay loam about 14 inches
thick. Th~ soil is well drained and is rarely flooded. Surface runoff is slow, and
permeability is moderate. Pledger clay is also a nonsaline soil with slopes averaging about 0.1 percent. This soil mainly supports pastureland, but also supports sorghum, soybeans, and corn. The Asa and Pledger soils are two of the
most productive soils in Brazoria County.
The wooded areas are typical of the lower Brazos Valley, standing in contrast
to the historically treeless coastal plain where wooded areas are generally confined
to the margins of rivers and small streams. The wooded areas are dominated by
hackberry, green ash, American elm, cedar elm, and live oak, with lesser amounts

of water oak, Shumard oak, pecan, and boxelder maple. Elm, ash, water oak, and
Shumard oak grow tall and straight, with only slightly tapering trunks, which makes
them very suitable for construction logs. A great variety of other trees, shrubs, and
vines also grow in the area, often creating dense bmsh-f’tlled, almost tropical,
woods.
It can be assumed that the first Anglo settlers chose this location because of
its rich soil, vast supply of raw materials---clay sources for brick, timber for
buildings, and plants and animals for food--and ready access to navigable
waterways that linked them to profitable markets. Under the plantation system
the county became a major producer of sugarcane and was known as the Sugar
Bowl of Texas. In the late nineteenth century, sugar production slowly decreased
while cotton production increased to twice that of any other Texas county.

HISTORICAL SUMMARY

The Eagle Island Plantation was carved from the southern five leagues
deeded in 1824 to Jared E. Groce II as part of a Mexican land grant in Stephen
F. Austin’s colony ~ay 1970). Much has been written about the wealth of J. E.
Groce, but the most important assets he brought to Texas probably were a skilled
work force and his own experience. J. E. Groce had owned a plantation in Georgia and later operated a plantation and timber holdings in Alabama (Berlet
1921:22). In 1821, while in New Orleans on business, he learned of Stephen F.
Austin’s plan to colonize Texas, and by the fall of that same year he was on his
way there with a large caravan (Berlet 1921:23-24).
"On account of his good qualities and circumstances (a notorious application
to agriculture and nearly one hundred slaves)," 10 leagues of land (comprising two
haciendas) were granted to J. E. Groce (Brazosport County Courthouse Records
[BCCR], Spanish Records [SR] 1824:244). His hacienda of five leagues on"Arroyo
Oyster" was in what is now Brazoria County, and Eagle Island Plantation was
formed from a portion of these lands. In early spring 1822, J. E. Groce chose land
on the Brazos River 4 miles south of the present town of Hempstead as the site for
construction of his northern hacienda, Bernardo (Berlet 1921:41); it was from here
that he established a cotton empire.
After finishing school in New York in 1827, Sarah Ann Groce came to join her
family in Texas. When, on December 5, 1827, at the age of 17, she married William
H. Wharton of Nashville, Tennessee, her father J. E. Groce gave the couple land in
Brazoria County as a wedding present (Berlet 1921:49; O’Connell 1959). However,
Wharton returned with his bride to Nashville, where he practiced law (Hale
1942:62) (for another version of this history, see Berlet [1921:52]), and their only
child John A. Wharton was born July 3, 1829, at the home of William Wharton’s
sister, Elizabeth Washington, near Nashville (Berlet 1921:52).
At the insistence of J. E. Groce, the couple returned to Texas in 1831 (Hale
1942:62). While crossing their land, Sarah and William came upon a grove of
large oak trees, in one of which an eagle had made her nest, so they decided to
make their home there and named it Eagle Island. The couple first lived in a log
home with an earthen floor and an enormous fireplace that occupied one entire
end of the house. J. E. Groce, who had once admired a one-and-a-half-story
mansion near Mobile, had a copy of the house precut in Alabama from native
pine and Cuban mahogany and shipped to Texas (A floor plan of the home can
be found in Autobiography of a Spoon [Berlet 1971:98]). The interior of the
home was comfortably furnished, and the grounds were well kept (Berlet
1971:15-21). A reconstruction of the plantation’s boundaries from later deeds
(see Figure 3) shows the mansion site actually south of the boundaries of the
plantation, a situation that was not unusual before the days of careful surveying.
Little is known about the day-to-day operations of the plantation, but they
were similar in several ways to the layout and operations at Bernardo, especially
since J. E. Groce had given a third of his slaves from Bernardo to his daughter.

At Bernardo, the slave quarters were about three-fourths of a mile from the main
dwelling, the cabins were built fronting a large lake, and nearby were the
overseer’s house, a large kitchen, eating hall, and day nursery (Berlet 1921:75).
Eagle Island also had many of these elements, and the overseer’s home, slave
cabins, and sugar mill were made of brick (Strobel 1926:23); cotton was probably the main cash crop.
John A. Wharton, William’s brother for whom William’s son was named, came
to stay at Eagle Island in 1833. The brothers’ participation in the Texas Revolution
and the political arena has been documented in many sources (Berlet 1917, 1921,
1971; Hale 1942; Strobel 1926); both men were vital to the formation of the
Republic of Texas. In the Wharton brothers, the Hawks of War had two very able
allies.
There was an overseer at the plantation during the time of the Texas Revolution
(Berlet 1921:57), but the authors could not find his name. However, due to the
amount of time William Wharton spent away from Eagle Island, it can be assumed
that the overseer was in charge of the plantation for much of the middle to late 1830s.
The plantation was prospering, and the home and grounds are described in the diary
Mary Austin Holley wrote during a short stay with the Whartons (Holley 1965:6063).
William H. Wharton was appointed Texas’s Minister to the United States, and
he secured U.S. recognition of the Republic of Texas on March 3, 1837, but while
he was on the New-Orleans-to-Texas leg of his return trip aboard the Texas Navy
cutter Independence, he was captured, together with the Independence, in a gun
battle that erupted when the cutter encountered the Mexican brigs-of-war Vencedor
del Alamo and Libertador, which were blockading the mouth of the Brazos River.
"Thelndependence had struck her colors almost within sight of Eagle Island, whose
fields and broad well wooded acres constituted the plantation of the captured Texas
minister" (Hill 1987:74-80). WiUiam’s brother John traveled by sea to Matamoros,
Mexico in early October, where he tried to exchange 30 Mexican soldiers captured
at San Jacinto for Wharton and other prisoners; however, when John returned to
Eagle Island late in October, he found that William had escaped and was already
home.
’File family moved to Houston in late 1838, since both Wharton and his brother
John had been elected to the Congress of the Republic of Texas. It was during his
term of office that John A. Wharton died of dysentery on December 17,1838 ~ erlet
1971:34-35). Though fast buffed in Houston, his body was returned to Eagle Island;
his burial was probably the Fast in the family cemetery (Pollan 1984:2-12).
On March 4, 1839, tragedy struck the Wharton family again when William
H. Wharton accidentally shot himself while drawing his pistol from its holster.
On March 14, 1839, when his son was nearly ten years old,William died at
Bernardo and was buried at Eagle Island next to his brother John (Berlet
1921:57-58).
After the death of her husband, Sarah Wharton spent much of her time at the
home of her brother Leonard W. Groce. Her son John was being educated there--

66

Texas Archeological Society

the 1840 census lists Montgomery County as her place of residence. Leonard, at his
sister Sarah’s request, changed the name of his 18-month-old son from Edwin
Waller Groce to William Wharton Groce (Berlet 1921:58), and, until he was of
school age, William Wharton Groce was allowed to spend most of his time with his
Aunt Sarah.
Like many plantations in the area, the Eagle Island Plantation probably
developed into a sugar plantation during the 1840s Clatter 1961). Family tradition
has it that William Wharton purchased two sets of machinery for the sugar mill in
order to eliminate down-time during the crucial harvest season (Strobel 1926:23).
At this time, Sarah Wharton depended upon John Harris, of Galveston, to
help her with business transactions, particularly the buying and selling of properties (BCCR, Deed D, 1844:16). Both William and John Wharton had speculated in real estate in Brazoria and Velasco. The 1840 Census (White 1966) lists
the estates of both William (title 15,498 acres, survey 61,992 acres, 41 slaves)
and John (title 1107 acres, survey 3321 acres, 2 slaves). Sarah bought and sold
several of these properties, probably in order to consolidate her holdings and to
get cash for the education of her son John.
John A. Wharton was educated with his cousins at Bernardo in Hempstead by
a Mr. Dean from New York (Berlet 1971:42). Later, John attended college in
Columbia, South Carolina, and, after graduation in 1848, read law in the office of
William C. Preston, of Columbia. There he met Penelope, the only daughter of
South Carolina Governor David Johnson, and, after their marriage, the couple
returned to Eagle Island to make their home. John continued to study law with Jack
Harris and E. M. Pease and, after receiving his license, went into partnership with
Clint Terry of Brazoria (Berlet 1971:44 A5).
Eagle Island began to prosper during the 1850s, when five acres were bought
on the Brazos River for a landing, and a right-of-way for a road to Eagle Island was
also procured (BCCR, Deed E, 1850:438). The sugar crops for the years 1852-1858
(Table 1) reflect the financial return from the land Clatter 1961:14-18).
John and Penelope Wharton had two daughters during this period: Sarah,
who died in infancy, and Kate Ross; for Christmas in 1855, Sarah Wharton gave
her infant granddaughter Kate Ross, two slaves, Carpana, age 5, and Lewana,
age 3 (BCCR, Deed G, 1855:461).
John Wharton also began to speculate in land, as had his father and uncle. He
bought several lots in Columbia, Texas, and, together with William Goodlet, he
bought the Cloman Plantation (between the present-day towns of Brazoria and Lake
Jackson) complete with slaves (BCCR Deed J, 1859:332). The slave population at
Eagle Island had risen from 76 in 1850 (U.S. Census Bureau 1850) to 132 in 1860,
housed in 30 slave houses. In the 1860 Census, John A. Wharton listed his real estate
value at $113,000 and personal wealth at $123,000 (U.S. CensusB ureau 1860). So
Eagle Island reached its zenith just before the Civil War.
Shortly after the war started, John A. Wharton joined Terry’s Texas Rangers (Graber 1987; Groce 1916:271-278). The home at Eagle Island was considered too close to the coast for safety, so John Wharton’s cousin William Wharton

*A hogshead, a large wooden barrel or cask, held about 1000 lbs. of

Groce, now grown and a captain in the Confederate Army, returned to Texas to
move family and slaves to the Shelton Oliver home in Walker County, and bring
the family closer together (Berlet 1971:48). Shortly before the end of the war,
General John A. Wharton was shot and killed in the Fannin House in Houston
by one of his subordinates, Colonel G. Baylor, after a disagreement (Hale
1942:126-130). He was first buried at Liendo (near Hempstead), but his remains
were later moved to the State Cemetery in Austin (Berlet 1971:52).
Sarah and her daughter-in-law Penelope Wharton moved back to the main
house at Eagle Island after the war and continued the rearing of Kate Ross. As with
most families in Brazoria County, the Reconstruction Period was very harsh for the
Whartons. With no labor to work the fields, Sarah rented out the plantation from
1868 to 1870 to William Masterson for one-fourth of the sugar and cotton crops for
the contracted years. Sarah was allowed to keep the gardens close to her house but
had to pay for repairs to the sugar mill and had to provide homes for the freedmen
(BCCR, Deed L, 1867:102). These homes may be the ones shown on a map of the
county near Bend Lake in the County Deed Records (BCCR, Deed S, 1879:93).
Colonel John Harris, of Galveston, again became the family lawyer, and, being
"land poor," the family began to sell offvafious parcels of land to pay debts (Berlet
1971:53).
On August 8, 1872, after a short illness, shortly after returning from school in
Nashville, Sarah’s granddaughter Kate Ross Wharton died at Eagle Island; her
burial was the first in the new cemetery area on the near side of the lake behind the
main house (Berlet 1971:75). Penelope’s health was also failing, so Sarah asked her
nephew William W. Groce to return to Eagle Island with his family. William, his
wife Kate Wyatt, and their three children moved to Eagle Island in 1873 and took
over all the affairs of the plantation (Berlet 1971:61).

In 1875, a hurricane damaged much of nearby Velasco and Quintana and
destroyed the sugar mill at Eagle Island. (In 1984, one of thepresent authors, James
L. Smith, visited the site of the sugar mill and found it at the edge of a modem sand
pit being destroyed by the removal of topsoil and sand. The exposed stepped
foundations were well over 3 feet thick. The floor, made from half and three-quarter
bricks, was two bricks thick. A large below-ground cistern south of the building had
been destroyed; most of the material from the cistern, which contained artifacts from
the turn of the century to the 1930s and 1940s, had been used as road fill.) The strong
winds of the 1875 hurricane also destroyed half of the old tree in which the eagle
had originally made her nest (Berlet 1971:80).
Penelope Wharton died May 15, 1876 and was buried next to her daughter at
Eagle Island. Later that same year, William and Kate Groce had another daughter,
Sarah Wharton Groce, the last child born at Eagle Island (Berlet 1921:132).
On February 1, 1878, while visiting Galveston, Sarah A. Wharton died at the
age of 68, in the home of Judge John W. Harris. She willed the Eagle Island
homestead (200 acres) to William and Kate Groce (BCCR, will of Sarah Ann
Wharton, Case No. 1027, 1878). This was almost all that was left of the many
thousands of acres owned by the family before the Civil War. William W. Groce
actually had to sue the estate to get his property (BCCR, Deed S, 1879:92). The
Groce family remained at Eagle Island until 1879, when the death of their daughter
Fannie filled them with such despair that they moved to their beach house at Velasco
(Berlet 1971:69).
Most of the remaining Wharton lands were sold at sheriff’s auctions to settle
claims against the estate of Sarah Wharton or to pay back taxes, and Harris
Masterson acquired possession of the greater part of the properties (BCCR, Deeds
T, 1881:343 and U, 1882:240).
Some of these sales were ludicrous by today’s standards. For a back tax of
$3.80 state and $4.05 county, 3400 acres were bought for $12.95 (BCCR, Deed
U, 1882:240). Masterson sold most of these lands to a northern syndicate that
later subdivided the acreage into small farm tracts (Berlet 1971:73). William W.
Groce and his wife sold the homestead tract to Harris Masterson in 1884 for
$200---$100 cash and $100 payable to their children later (BCCR, Deed W,
1884:217). Several lawsuits ensued over the years, and the children sold their
portion to D. R. Pearson in 1892 for $325 (BCCR, Deed 17, 1892:177). The
house site excavated by the Brazosport Archaeological Society in 1984 and 1985
was part of a 20-acre parcel sold in 1892 to Sam B. Dolly by Harris Masterson
(BCCR, Deed 18, 1892:505).
Very little information has been recorded about the overseer at Eagle Island.
There is reference to a "Mr. Maxie, the overseer, and his wife" preparing for the
homecoming of John A. Wharton and his new bride Penelope (Berlet 1971:45). But
the 1850 Census does not list a Maxie, nor does it list John and Penelope as having
arrived at Eagle Island. However, the census does list Peter C. Eicher, aged 51, his
wife and two daughters next to Sarah A. Wharton and Dr. Branch T. Archer, who
were living at Eagle Island. Since the census lists often reflect the sequence of

Gross et al. ~ Eagle Island Plantation

69

visitation by the census taker, it is likely that the Eicher family was living in the next
house down the road from Sarah Wharton. In file 1860 Census, Peter Escher (sic)
and family, together with E. Maxey (Smith 1990) and Jno. Campbell, from
Scotland, are listed. These may be "Maxie" the overseer, and the Scottish gardener
of family tradition 03erlet 1971:79). The structure that was excavated easily could
have housed a family in one end and two bachelors in the other. After the Civil War,
William Masterson may have lived in the house, since he was overseeing the
operation of the plantation in the late 1860s. After the return of William W. Groce
and his family to Eagle Island, the house may have stood empty. An 1881 deed
(BCCR, Deed T, 1881:343) is the only document that shows a structure near the
excavation site, but none of the people interviewed who were living in the vicinity
in the early 1940s remember such a structure
The Eagle Island mansion was destroyed by the 1900 hurricane, and its residue
was used to repair other homes in the area (Berlet 1971:23). Later, the Brazoria
County Cemetery Association acquired land around the mansion site and sold its
fhst burial plot in January 1946. Most of the mansion area is now covered by
Restwood Memorial Park. In accordance with her wishes, Sarah Wharton Groce
Berlet, the daughter of William and Kate Groce, who was born in 1876, is buried
there next to her husband, in the area of the kitchen associated with the m ansion. The
old oak tree that stood beside the mansion and had housed the eagle nest for which
the plantation was named is visible today only as a huge stump cut off at the ground.
The urban areas of the towns of Lake Jackson and Clute now surround and cover the
once-proud Eagle Island Plantation.
EXCAVATIONS
The Brazosport Archaeological Society undertook extensive excavations and
subsequent analytical research at the site during the spring of 1984 and again in the
spring of 1985 (Table 2).
A datum was established northwest of the low mound near the cistern, and a
study area of 10,000 square feet was laid out in 5-foot squares. English measurement
units were chosen because the only surveying instruments available were so
equipped. Excavation units were named for the coordinates at the southwest
corners. During the two years of work at the site, 28 units were excavated, opening
up 700 square feet or 7 percent of the study area (Figure 4)
In 1984, vertical control was maintained by transit; an arbitrary elevation of 15
feet was given to the datum. Four-inch increments (plus or minus an eighth of an
inch) were dug to specific elevations (i.e., 15 feet, 14.67 feet, 14.33 feet, 14 feet).
However, lack of a transit in the 1985 season made it difficult to maintain this degree
of accuracy.
All excavated soil was put through quarter-inch screens. No fine screening was
done, nor were soil samples collected. Because of the large amount of brick rubble,
mortar, and brick fragments, all soil was removed with trowels. When sterile soil
was encountered, shovel tests insured that there were no artifacts below. All cultural

materials were collected and stored in individual bags marked with the excavation
unit from which they came.
Initially, a 2-by-20-foot trench, Trench X, was dug along the south side of the
mound (see Figure 4). When brick walls appeared, the area along the south wall of
Trench X was expanded by 8 feet, into two 8-by-10-foot units (S and U) that were
excavated independently of Trench X. Only level 5 of $6.0/E4.0 (which was below
the floor level of previously excavated Trench X) was a full 10 feet square; all other
excavation units were 5 feet square.
The site comprised three stratigraphic zones (Figure 5). Zone A, from 1 to
4 inches deep, was dark clay loam, rich with plant root, insect, and rodent disturbances. Zone B, from 4.5 to 10 inches deep, was composed of bricks, brick
rubble, and mortar in light tan sandy loam. Zone C, from 10 to 18 inches deep,
generally was thinner outside than inside the structure, with dark tan clay loam
that became more clay-like with depth. The highest concentration of artifacts, at
the interface between Zones B and C, dropped off dramatically toward the base
of the foundation (Figure 5).
CULTURAL ASSEMBLAGE
Artifacts recovered during the 1984 and 1985 excavations were classified into
nine categories (brick, brick rubble, and mortar are not included) (Table 3).

Metal Artifacts

The many metal artifacts were classified according to function into eight
groups: clothing, personal articles, table and cooking utensils, household articles,
arms and ammunition, building materials, barn and farm equipment, and tools.
Clothing (Figures 6, 7)
The variety of clothing worn on the site was evidenced by the different buckles,
buttons, and other clothes fasteners found. The metal buttons were of steel, brass,
copper, lead, and combinations of these metals; some of the military buttons were
gold plated (see below for analysis of the buttons). Several different types of ferrous
and nonferrous buckles were found; some were decorated, gold plated, or brass with
chrome, and one was a combination of brass with a steel tongue. These could have
been used with cloth or leather (Figure 6). Miscellaneous clothes fasteners include

rivets and studs; several have stars embossed on the heads, and one cufflink has a
glass insert.
Suspender hardware (Figure 6, D-F), made of brass, copper, and nickel, is
abundant, together with various other clothes fasteners, including hook-and-eye
fasteners, several of which have patent dates. Two brass loops are dated 1890
(Figure 6, G), and one loop is dated 1855. A unique suspender buckle has two
complete patent dates, March 7, 1871 and November 3, 1874 (Figure 6, H). One
interesting piece is a lady’s garter fastener.
A chrome- or nickel-plated clip attachment (Figure 6, I), embossed Anchor
and Pat Appld For is believed to be a cuff holder--a tool used to hold a cuff
to facilitate insertion of a cufflink (Figure 6, I)--since it has a spring clip on
one end and a swivel-type stud on the other (Sears Roebuck and Co. 1968:221).
Remnants of shoes and boots found are a shoe eyelet, shoe taps, and an iron
riding spur.
Personal Articles
Four coins found on the site, 1866 and 1884 five-cent pieces, an 1880 penny,
and an 1856 Liberty dime (Figure 8, A-D) provide definite evidence for the time of
occupation.
Handiwork was evidently part of the normal routine in this household, for

nine thimbles were found (Figure 8, F, G). Of special interest are an iron thimble,
a silver thimble, and a copper-on-brass thimble. A pressure foot for a treadletype sewing machine is evidence of later machine sewing.
Among the items of jewelry are a gold-plated brass barrette, a copper hair
clip (Figure 8, H), an ornate barrette buckle (Figure 8, I), jewelry clasp rings, a
rhinestone-encrusted pin, and a three-piece decorated bracelet (Figure 8, J).
A shaft with small brass wheels was identified as part of a child’s toy, and
a jews’ harp shows that music was heard in the house. Three pocket knives-one with a bone handle--a straight razor, and a metal hip flask all are evidence
of a variety of good living conditions for the occupants of this site. Fishing is
evidenced by four fish hooks.
The 22 ferrous and 22 nonferrous personal articles were scattered quite
evenly throughout the excavation units.
Table And Cooking Utensils
Many cast-iron fragments are apparently from a stove; two are embossed
Buck saint and Lily. Pieces of stove grating, a flue damper, and stove plates
were also found, together with cast iron handles for lifting stove plates. Many
table utensils--six forks (mostly three-tined) (Figure 9, A, B), 12 spoons, eight
knives, and miscellaneous handles--were found, and one interesting item was
what we would call a butter knife. Most of these table utensils are of ferrous
material, but several (Figure 9, C) are of silver-plated copper. Although no
cooking pots were found, a large copper sieve suggests cooking.
All except 11 of the 384 table and cooking utensils were of ferrous material
(Figure 10).
Metal Household Articles (Figures 11 and 12)
The furniture and household articles include cast-iron pieces, lamps, keys,
locks, and furniture decorations. Some cast-iron pieces, together with a socket
and a caster, could be parts of furniture such as beds or tables.
Lamp parts include a socket, wick holders, and wick-turner wheels. One of
the wick holders had a manufacturer’s name, SUNLIGHT, and patent date of
December 14, 1869; another read Patented Oct 13, 63, Reissued June 30. One
wick-turner wheel had Star embossed on the face (Figure 11, A). A small round
tin box of grease was also found, together with a keyhole plate (Figure 11, F),
four key fragments (Figure 11, E), a lock, a large padlock, and two window locks
(Figure 11, G).
The furniture fragments included drawer pulls and hasps, a small ornate
finial, a large brass bedpost top or finial for a stove, a gold-decorated knob, and
several brass knobs and caps. One of the small brass knobs was embossed PAF.
Other miscellaneous items were several brass and silver decorated pieces, a
decorated tin star, and iron, brass, and silver tubes.

Arms And Ammunition
The only firearms parts are one musket wedgeplate (Figure 13, C) and a
gunlock spring. However, extensive evidence of ammunition was found lead ball
shots, percussion caps, and cartridges. Most of the ammunition and related objects
were along the inside wall of the structure, at or below the third level. This is below
the brick rubble, which is evidence that these materials probably were inside the
house during the occupation period or at least were there before the structure was
completely destroyed.
Cap and ball ammunition indicates that pre- 1860 firearms were used. The many
lead shot balls (Figure 13, G) that were found were of calibers ranging from .22 to
A5, and also included lead and tin buckshot. Two of the lead shot had sprue still
attached, and one piece of sprue was recovered, together with a round-shot bullet
mold (Figure 13, A) and lead slag fragments, making it almost certain that shot were
manufactured at the site.

utensils. Ferrous items include stove hardware and utensils; nonferrous items include

Percussion caps for pistols and muskets were found (Figure 13, H); one musket
cap is of copper. Twelve-gauge shotshells (Figure 13, I) were in the same main areas
where the cartridges and lead shot were found. The cartridges were from a variety
of weapons (.22, .30, .32, .38, A 1, and .44 caliber), both rim- and center-fire (Figure
13, D, E), with .32 caliber predominant. Of particular note was a .44-caliber rim -fire
cartridge that had been f’tred with a dual firing pin, evidence that a Henry rifle (an
early repeating rifle) was used. Manufacture dates ~ r the cartridges range from 1860
to the present (Table 4). Primers for some of the shotshells and cartridges were
missing. Two loose-fired primers were found, together with a brass primer case
embossed HICKS CENTRAL FIRE (Figure 13, B) and a zinc cap marked
HAZARD POWDER, evidence that cartridges were being reloaded at the site. In
addition, there was an unidentified brass object stamped US (Figure 13, F), which
could be of military origin.
All except two of these artifacts (a gun part and an ammunition mold) are of
nonferrous material (Figure 14).

Building Materials
The abundance of building materials attests to the fact that a very sturdy
structure had been built. Nails were the largest category of artifacts found, as is to
be expected in a dwelling. The nails were scattered throughout the site, most
abundantly along the ends of the sla-ucture, near the two hearths and along the outside
walls. The nails are mainly the common square-cut variety, which Were available
from about 1830 until the 1890s (Hume 1970:254); they are wrought head, floor,
box, and round nails, the latter accounting for less than 2 percent of all the nails
found. One brass headless brad was also recovered. Only 25 nonferrous items of
building materials were found (Figure 15).
Spikes and rods of iron and brass were abundant, together with building studs
and brads. Washers and nuts that were used with the I-bolts, U-bolts, and a rafter bolt
were found. Wood screws, roofing tacks, and staples were used in building this
structure, and pins with eyes and parts of door hinges were recovered, together with
a copper window screen that could have belonged to the dwelling.
Barn And Farm Equipment (Figure 16)
Many common fence staples, pieces of wire, and wire hooks supplied evidence
of fanning and the use of horses or mules as beasts of burden. A few pieces of
common post-Civil-War barbed wire were also found, together with chains for
normal barn and farming activities.

Hamess rings and buckles typical of the nineteenth century, pieces of plows,
and singletree harness connectors and hooks reflect the use of horses or mules. The
artifact collection also includes a horseshoe, a horseshoe nail, and two pieces of a
bridle, including the bridle bit.
A clevis, a carriage bolt, a flat leaf spring, and a wagon hub-cover reflect the
presence of a wagon or similar equipment. A common iron shackle and other large
miscellaneous pieces with holes and hooks can also be considered barn and farm
equipment.
These artifacts may have arrived at the site when the building was used as a
storage shed or barn, just before or after partial destruction.
Tools
Tools were not abundant on the site; axeheads, hoes, a shovel, clamps, a
pulley, an auger handle, and a monkey wrench were found, but the most abundant tools are files, one of which is made of brass. All except two of the tools
are of ferrous material; all 45 tools were scattered quite evenly throughout the
excavation units.
Summary of Metal Artifacts
In summary, the dates of manufacture or use of most of the metal artifacts
were difficult to determine precisely, with the exception of the patented and
marked artifacts. The patent dates on the clothing and lamps are from 1850
through 1890. The Anchor patented article that is believed to be a cuff holder
may yield a patent date on further research.

Figure 14. Diagrana showing density of arms- and anununition-related artifacts at Eagle
Island. These items include cartridges, percussion caps, primers, shot shells, gun parts, cans,
boxes, lead and tin shot, bullets, and fragments.

The coins span the time tom 1856 through 1884, and the ammunition and
related artifacts point to occupation from pre-Civil-War days to the early 1900s.
However, the early 1900s cartridges show that we cannot eliminate the possibility
that what remained of the structures was used as an area for hunting small animals
or for target practice by local hunters
Glass Artifacts

The glass artifacts fall into three main categories--bottle glass, window
glass, and pressed or molded glass--in addition to a few fragments of mirror
glass (Table 5).
Bottle Glass
The bottles recovered from the site are of many colors (Table 6) and had
been used for beer, ale (Figure 17), wine, distilled alcoholic spirits, medicine
(Figure 18, B and C), perfume (Figure 18, A, and 19, B), hair tonic, shoe dye,
ink, and condiments (Figures 17-19). A few whole bottles were found, but most
of the whole bottles reported here were reconstructed by members of the
Brazosport Archaeological Society. Despite the the fact that they came from a

from a relatively undisturbed site, many bases (Table 7) and necks (Table 8)
could not be joined. Some bases have distinguishing or identifLable marks. Bottles
with both necks and bases are listed in both tables.
These bottle necks date from about 1860 to 1900¯ The necks with seams
low on the necks are early (some before 1860); necks with seams all the way up
date from about 1880. The earliest is a mason jar (they were invented in 1858),
and only one pre-1857 bottle with a pontil mark was found. These dates, together with the manufacture dates of the bases, document heavy occupation from
1860 to 1900, with indications of earlier occupation.
Pressed Glass
Pressed glass is represented only by bowl and lantern fragments; molded glass
is represented by an aqua canning jar lid, a milk-white canning jar lid, and a swan
figure (Figure 20) believed to be a perfume bottle stopper. A very unusual container
(Figure 21), recovered in pieces and partially reconstructed, stands upright on a
three-point base and is believed to be a perfume bottle or lady’s pin holder. Its
form--a wicker basket with a backstrap (a woven rucksack)--suggests that it may
have been modelled after an Indian cradle board.

Bone Artifacts
A deer antler tool handle (Figure 22, A) and a bone needle (Figure 22, B)
show signs of use. The basal three inches of the main beam of a white-tailed
deer antler used for the tool hanc!e apparently had been shed and was not removed from the skull during butchering, for it has several rodent gnaw marks
that probably were made before the antler was modified. Both the main beam
and the brow tine were sawed, two parts of the basal rosette were chipped away,
and a socket was drilled i~to the sawed end for insertion of the tool. Its shape
suggests that it was a handie for a file or rasp or similar tool, part of which can
be seen in the socket.

nails, bridles, plows, and singletrees. Nonferrous items, found in only minor quantifies, are
wire, brass, lead, copper, and tin items.

Shell Artifacts
Only a few shell artifacts, a large percentage of which are buttons (described
separately below) were found on this site; the remaining shell artifacts are motherof-pearl inlays. A few marine shells were recovered, primarily oysters, and,
considering the distance of the site from the Gulf, these shells must have been
carried to the site as food or for amusement.
Stone Artifacts
The stone artifacts recovered at the site consist primarily of slate fragments
(some of which have hatching incised as on a tally board) and slate pencils O~igure

the site; the management of a large plantation would certainly have required some
day-to-day record keeping.

The ceramics at the site were made primarily in the last half of the nineteenth
century in Bavaria, England, the United States, and possibly Mexico (Cushion

Housekeeping and Cooking Ceramics
Ceramics that were used in the preparation, serving, and storage of food are
subdivided into five types, based on paste, surface treatment, decoration, and fLring
temperature: soft paste earthenware, hard paste earthenware, yellow ware, stoneware, and porcelain.

Soft Paste Earthenware:

Undecorated Sandy Paste Earthenware is generally undecorated, unglazed
earthenware, made by Native American occupants of the area between A.D. 500 and
1800 (Aten 1971:52), with dark brown sandy paste and fire-mottled exterior
surfaces; it includes Goose Creek Plain pottery. Vessels usually are vertical-walled
jars with round or nodal bottoms.
Tin-glazed Red Paste Earthenware is characterized by a low-fired red paste
earthenware with a cream-colored tin glaze. The two sherds found on this site are
glazed only on the interiors. The larger sherd, from the bottom of a flat-bottomed
vessel, is decorated with small brown dots applied to the glaze and is unusual
because it is glazed only on the interior; it is probably of Mexican origin (Fox 1986).
Wares with this type of glaze andpaste are common in early nineteenth century sites
in the San Antonio area (Labadie et al. 1986:111).

Hard Paste Earthenwares
Luster-glazed Brown Paste Earthenware, made from a variety of pastes
(refined earthenwares, porcelain, and well-fired red bodies) and glazed by a
unique process in which various metals are added to the glaze, creating a lustrous effect. One sherd of this type was found at the site, made from a hard dark
brown paste with an interior glaze of dark brown copper luster, and an exterior
glaze of blue, brown, and tan luster stripes. Luster wares were popular in the
San Antonio area in the 1830s (Labadie et al. 1986:122) and were usually used
for pitchers and jars (Fox 1986).
Decorated White Paste Earthenwares, decorated in several different ways
(Figure 24), were imported from England in great quantities during the first half
of the nineteenth century and, to a lesser degree, in the last half (Godden 1967;
Kovel and Kovel 1986). Ten decoration categories of decorated white paste
earthenware are found in the Eagle Island collection: transfer prints, transfer

prints with enamels, hand-painted, blue edged, sponge or spatter, flown blue and

Transfer prints (Table 10) are seen on most of the decorated sherds. These
prints are in six colors (black, blue, brown, green, purple, and red), with
blue predominating. The patterns include florals, geometrics, and pictorials;
eleven sherds with transfer prints were identified (Figure 25), and their

common---over which the colored band is applied, usually on plates and
platters. Three different edge treatments were identified and roughly dated. The
first is Cockled Edge (small shell with feather motif) about 1795 to 1825
(Figure 26, H), the second is a Noncockled Edge (lightly incised trident) about
1840 to 1860 (Figure 26, I), and the last is a Noncockled Edge (no incising; shell
is brush stroked) about 1870 to 1890 (Figure 26, J). These dates are from a paper
presented by Randall Moir at the 1987 Texas Archeological Society Annual
Meeting in Waco, Texas.
Sponge or Spatter, sometimes called spatterware, consists of the application
of various colors to a vessel surface by means of an inked sponge. The colors
used in the collection are blue and red, and cups are the only vessel form
represented (Figure 26, K).
Flown Blue and Flown Black decorations consist of transfer-printed designs
in which the color has flowed out or "bled" into the surrounding undecorated
parts of the vessels. Cobalt blue sherds from saucers and plates and the black
sherds from a pitcher (Figure 26, O) are the most common in the collection.

Cut Sponge decorations, sometimes called stamped, are applied to vessels
by means of a stamp cut from a sponge and inked. Red and green geometric
stamping is found on plates and cups (Figure 26, L-N).
Banded Slip decoration is a baby-blue checkered pattern on a white background
applied to a large bowl; this decoration may date to the late nineteenth century.

Decal decorations, popular at the end of the nineteenth century, were applied
to the surfaces of vessels to keep costs down by reducing firing loss and to keep
ceramic costs down. The sample from Eagle Island has a floral decal applied

gold overglaze.

Unknown edge decorations, which do not fall into any of the groups described
and appear to be late nineteenth century decoration traditions, are found on
three sherds. Within a blue band at the rims are alternating white circles and
ovals. This band, on both the inside and outside of the vessel but wider on the
inside (Figure 26, D), is found on large and small plates, cup saucers, cups,
pitchers, serving dishes, bowls, and chamber pots.
Undecorated White Paste Earthenwares (Figure 27) include the undecorated
parts of decorated white paste earthenwares, pearlwares, granite wares, or ironstones. All of these white wares are combined here because they cannot be separated with any confidence into their appropriate groups. By the 1850s, the
popularity of the decorated white paste earthenwares began to wane, and by the
end of the Civil War the ironstones and granite wares became the vogue. The
collection from Eagle Island contains a few examples of the early Gothic styles
popular before the war; but most of the styles are from the last quarter of the
nineteenth century. Vessel forms are large and small plates, saucers, bowls,
platters, serving dishes, and chamber pots. Some of these sherds have makers’

marks, and, except for one American mark, all are English (Figures 28 and 29;
Table 11).
Yellow Wares are of buff clay that is finer in texture than red ware and stoneware,
to which it is very similar, except that it has more iron, kaolin, and feldspar. Yellow
wares are less dense and vitreous than stonewares, which are fired at about 2000°F;
yellow wares are fired somewhat above this temperature (GaUo 1985:38). Sherds
in the collection are either undecorated or decorated with a brown manganiferous
glaze known as Rockingham. The undecorated yellow ware sherds are from bowls
and baking dishes. One dish is an 11-inch fiat-bottomed vessel with sloping sides

called a nappie, manufactured by Sharpe Brothers and Co. ( 1838-1900) of Derbyshire,
England (Gallo 1985:11). The sherds with Rockingham glaze are from pitchers and
possibly a cuspidor. The possible cuspidor sherds are similar to those of a
Rockingham glazed yellow ware cuspidor found at Quintana, Texas (Pollan
1986:3-4).

Fourteen of the 35 yellow ware sherds were recovered from excavation unit E;
the remainder were scattered evenly throughout the site.
Stonewares (Figure 30) have hard, vitrified, clay-colored earthenware bodies.
The stoneware sherds found at Eagle Island can be subdivided into four types
based on surface treatment--salt-glazed exterior only, salt-glazed exterior with
slipped interior, slipped exterior and interior surfaces, and undetermined surface
treatments.
Salt-glazed, Exterior Only is represented at Eagle Island by two vessels. The
first, either a beer, ale, or ink bottle, has a light brown paste and a dark brown
salt-glazed exterior. The second vessel, possibly a crock or chum lid, is
represented by a single sherd of gray paste with gray salt-glazed exterior.
Salt-glazedExterior with Slippedlnterior is represented by many sherds from
crocks, jugs, and jars, with paste ranging from dark brown high-fired to light
tan low-fired. The exterior slip ranges from tan to almost black; the interiors are
all brown slipped. Most of the vessels were wheel thrown, but some were made
by the jiggered method.
Slipped Exterior and Interior Surfaces, represented by a large mixing bowl
popular in the 1890s, have dark brown slip. One and a half inches below the rim
of this vessel is a large ring flange that permitted stacking of a maximum
number of bowls for firing in the kiln (Georgiana Greer, 1987 personal
communication).
A second slipped stoneware piece has a light reddish brown wash on gray
paste, and on the interior, a light tan slip. On one of the sherds is an impressed
seal--a circle with the letters SEL around the perimeter and a crowned eagle
whose head is facing left and has the letters P.R. on its breast. A similar mark
was found on a stoneware wine bottle at the Little Campus site at The University of Texas in Austin. The mark was identified as the seal of the Duchy of
Nassau, one of the 39 independent states created by the Congress of Vienna in
1815 from lands conquered by Napoleon; they existed as political entities until
1871 (Jackson 1986:15). Munsey, however, identifies these vessels as mineral

water bottles (Munsey 1970:135), describing them as almost always with a handle
near the neck, about 12 inches tall, and holding about a quart. He dates these
bottles from 1880 to 1900 and states that
many came from Germany and Holland; one of the most common is
stamped"Nassau", which is a region in the province of Hesse in Germany.
Mineral water was imported to meet a demand by immigrants to this
country who were fond of mineral waters from the"old country" [Munsey
1970:135].
Miscellaneous sherds from undetermined vessels were also found, some with
an almost copper luster sheen on the exterior and a brown wash on the interior¯
One sherd has a white Bristol-like slip on both interior and exterior, and a creamcolored paste.
Most of the stonewares apparently were manufactured in the midwestem
United States, possibly the Ohio River valley, and date to the 1880s. All of the

Personal Ceramics
Ceramics used for personal activities by the inhabitants were limited to toys,
pipes, and furniture.
Toys found on the site are marbles, doll parts, and children’s tea sets. The
marbles are unglazed stoneware, ranging between 9/16 and 1 inch in diameter. One
marble is decorated with two blue lines crossing at right angles. The doll parts-upper torso, arms, legs, and part of a face---are made of porcelain and represent at
least four dolls. The sherds of children’s tea sets--parts of a cup, a pitcher, and four
saucers ~igure 33)---are also porcelain.

Pipes were abundant and of many forms. The stem of one white kaolin pipe and a
green-glazed white kaolin Turk’s head effigy pipe are from England and were
common before the Civil War. An agate-ware pipe bowl possibly came from
England or Germany, and the remaining pipes are American. The stoneware pipes
date to the latter half of the nineteenth century. The thin dark-glazed pipes may be
from Kentucky, the salt-glazed pipes, from Pt. Pleasant, Ohio, and the light colored
pipe, bowls, and stems, from Virginia (Georgiana Greer, personal communication)
(Figure 34).

Ceramic Furniture is represented at the site by a porcelain wheel still attached
to a steel axle and swivel assembly that would have been driven into the furniture
leg. The wheel is 1-1/2 inches in diameter and 1 inch wide.
Ceramic Building Hardware is represented by two doorknobs--2 inches
in diameter and an inch thick in the center--made of dark brown stoneware paste
marbleized with different shades of brown clay. Similar doorknobs have been
found on other historic sites in Brazoria and Jackson counties (Fox et al. 1981:69;
Mallouf et al. 1973:177).
Summary of Ceramics
In summary, the ceramics indicate that the site was occupied from the late
1830s to about 1900. The early transfer patterns, together with the red-paste
wares, easily support the early date. The preponderance of undecorated white
paste earthenware with late nineteenth century makers’ marks and the lack of
early twentieth century ceramics help solidify the latter date.
Organics
Hard rubber items make up the greater part of the organic artifacts recovered.
The many novelty items hard rubber combs, pipe stem, hairpin, barrette, buttons,
and a ring (Figure 35)--reflect the desire of rubber manufacturers of the day to find
markets for their new vulcanizing process (see "Buttons," below).
Food Residues
The modest culinary tastes of the household are indicated by the many peach
pits, eggshell fragments (including one goose or turkey egg), and corn cobs.
Buttons And Studs

The six hundred fifty-nine buttons, studs, and beads recovered from the site
are broken down into six major categories: bone, shell, ceramic, hard rubber,
glass, and metal.
Bone Buttons
The large shinbones of cattle provided the best raw material for the thousands of plain two-, three-, four-, and five-hole bone buttons that were produced
in the nineteenth century. The bones were cleaned and boiled to soften them,
then sawed open and pressed fiat, and, after the spongy interiors of hollow bones
were scraped out, the button blanks were cut from the resulting slabs. Commercial bone blanks were usually cut on lathes, which imparted simple ring-turned
designs. The discs were fitted with nailhead shanks or stout pin shanks, or they
were drilled with two, three, four, or commonly five holes (four spaced evenly
and one in the middle); the center holes were drilled in the marks left by the
pricks that secured the discs in the lathes (Hughes and Lester 1981:8-13). Thirty

rainbows of colors. The shells of the pearl oyster, several species of the genera
Meleagrina or Pinctada have been most extensively used for buttons. Birmingham
was theEnglish center for the manufacture of pearl buttons well into the nineteenth
century, but the French also made beautiful pearl buttons. "Colonial" pearls, pearl
discs with conventional designs and short brass wire pin shanks, were used from the
last of the eighteenth century through the 1840s. Most of these buttons were
imported from Europe, but there is evidence that Amaja D. Goodyear, of Ohio, was

Gross et aL ~ Eagle Island Plantation

119

making cuffand sleeve"colonial" buttons as early as 1807. Imported shell, always
an expensive item, was cut with as little waste as possible, and after blanks had been
cut from the prime part of the shell, the smaller pieces were sold to other factories,
to be made into tiny buttons for shirts and shoes. From 1800 to 1860, most pearl
buttons were decorated with simple turned or pierced designs, often with delicate
milled edges. In the second half of the nineteenth century an American industry in
the East began to make buttons of imported ocean pearl, and by the 1890s the pearl
button industry had also developed in the Midwest, based on the abundant supply
of freshwater mussel from the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. The nacreous lining of
the freshwater mussel is almost pure white but is not iridescent. It was used mostly
for utilitarian shirts, underwear, and baby-clothes buttons (Hughes and Lester
1981:230-231). More than 17 percent of the buttons at the site were made from
shell; most were two- and four-hole utilitarian buttons (Figure 36, B, C), and only
four were of a different type--one possible "colonial" pin shanked, two oval with
swaged-in shank, and one cut design square with brass shank (possibly post-1900).
The last button here is the only one with part of the shank remaining so the other
identifications are only tentative.
Ceramic Buttons and Studs (Figure 38)
Ceramic buttons and studs for utilitarian uses comprised almost 60 percent of
the button artifacts recovered. In 1840, a process for making ceramic buttons from

dry china-clay powder was patented in England by Richard Prosser. The powder
was poured into steel dies or molds and compressed into small button shapes that
were then fired. By 1848, plain white and calico-printed buttons were being made
in the United States; from the 1850s to the early twentieth century, the greater part
of the market was dominated by the firm of Jean Felix Bapterosse, of France, who
used a process that stamped out buttons from wet china clay. Two-, three-, and fourhole plain white and colored body buttons were produced, together with calico
prints. Ceramic buttons can be classified by shape, size, pattern, body color, shank
type, finish, etc. (Hughes and Lester 1981: 31-33) (Figure 39).

Rubber Buttons
Buttons made of hardened India rubber apparently were made only in the
United States by vulcanization, which was discovered by Charles Goodyear in 1839
and patented by him in 1844¯ Nelson Goodyear patented an imProved process for
hardening rubber in 1851. The date 1851, with the designation "Goodyear’s patent"
and the manufacturer’s name, either in full or abbreviated, is the most common
backmark on hard rubber buttons made by two American companies, the Novelty
Rubber Co. of New York and New Brunswick, New Jersey, and the India Rubber
Comb Co. of New York¯ Two firms that manufactured hard rubber buttons after
Goodyear’s patents expired in the 1870s were the Dickinson Hard Rubber Co. from
the late 1870s to the early 1890s, and the American Rubber Co. in the 1880s and

Glass Buttons
Most of the glass buttons recovered from the site are black (Figure 40, E-H),
but one round button of clear glass with a wire loop shank dating from 1840 to 1890,
one round button of clear glass with impressed design top and bottom and a brass
shank from the 1860s, and three round clear glass inserts that possibly had brass
backs were also recovered. Most of the small black glass buttons with or without
pictorial designs made between 1870 and 1914 were imported from Bohemia,
Germany, and Austria until 1880, when several firms began to manufacture them
in the United States (Hughes and Lester 1981:88-109). The popularity of black
buttons during this time is attributed to the black mourning clothes worn by Queen
Victoria after the death of her husband.
Metal Buttons (Figure 41)
More than half of the 79 metal buttons are four-hole pants buttons. Some have
brass tops, but most tops are tinned iron or steel. Corrosion was quite severe on all,
but the brass buttons (Figure 40, I-J) survived sometimes in amazingly good

shape. Brass buttons can be put into several groups, including the Jacksonians of
the 1825 to 1840 period, the Golden Age gilts, military buttons, and Victorian
picture buttons. In the early years of the nineteenth century, brass buttons continued to be imported into this country from Britain, but by the 1830s, several
American manufacturers had developed the technical ability to compete with the
foreign imports. The earliest gilt buttons were one piece; by 1820, the two-piece
button had become established in Britain and was soon in~oduced into the United
States. It consisted of two stamped metal shells, front and back, folded tightly over
at the rims. Americans called it the Sanders type after the British inventor
Benjamin Sanders. Two steel dies were required to stamp the top face, a negative
and a positive die, to give more definition to the design stamped in the thin metal.
The production of these gilt buttons reached its peak in the United States between
1830 and 1850. The gilt buttons from this period are called Golden Age gilts; only
one Golden Age gilt was recovered from the site, a one-piece design with an
impressed back mark, Warranted Rich Orange (Figure 42, E). The Jacksonian
buttons, also of the Golden Age period, were small gilt brass waistcoat buttons
characterized by separate rims that were added to the one-piece bodies. More than
a hundred patterns, including die variants, have been listed. The back marks of true
Jacksonians are in raised letters, and factory marks include L. & Kendrick (18291835), R. J. & Co. (1832-1836), Scovills (1840-1850), and R. R. & Co. (18261832). Two buttons from the site could possibly be called Jacksonian; careful
cleaning of the backs of both of these would be required for positive identification.
After 1850, the quality of gilt dress buttons began to decline with lighter construction and less hand finishing, and in the 1860s, small chased gilt buttons of cheap
two-piece construction with tinned iron backs and flexible wire shank were made
for women’s wear. Victorian stamped brass picture buttons, most of which were
cheap stamped brass with lacquered steel backs, followed in the late 1860s for
ladies’ and children’s wear. Because of the steel backs, the four or five picture
buttons recovered are in bad condition; three are of the same flowered design.
Brass buttons for the military follow the same sequence in construction as the
civilian dress buttons. Both one- and two-piece buttons from the 1800 to 1840
period often have superb die work. Most were imported from Britain in the early
part of the nineteenth century, but by the 1840s, American manufacturers began to
fill the government contracts (Hughes and Lester 1981:214-224).
Four gold-gilt military buttons were recovered: one Republic of Texas Navy
button (2-piece with border and rope edging and back-marked Scovills & Co.
Waterbury) and three dating to the Civil War (Figure 42, A-D). Of these Civil War
buttons, one is a South Carolina militia button (back mark unreadable), one is a
Confederate infantry button (no back mark), and one is a Confederate cavalry button
marked Willm Bird & Co., London (Albert 1973).
Summary
After examining the buttons from the site, M. W. (Freddie) and Jean Speights,
members and officers of the National Button Society, were immediately able to

Gross et aL ~ Eagle Island Plantation

date the buttons roughly from the 1840s to the very early turn of the century, based
only on buttons, with no historical data. This correlates well with the other
artifacts from the site. The Speights also ascertained that the vast majority of
buttons, no matter the material of construction, were utilitarian buttons for both
men and women, used on dresses, shirts, pants, overalls, and underwear. As with

Architectural Remains
The main house foundation measures 18 by 48.5 feet, and it is estimated
that there were three rooms, with a substantial fireplace at each end. This size
and room arrangement is similar to other buildings built in Brazoria County
during the 1830s and 1840s. The foundations of this building are of massive
stepped brick construction that could easily support a two-storied structure (Nia
Becknel, personal communication) (Figure 43). A two-story or story-and-a-half
structure could easily house one large family or several small family units.
Although there is insufficient brick rubble to account for substantial brick
walls, a historical reference (Strobel 1926:23) mentions that the overseer’s home,
slave cabins, and sugar mill were of all-brick construction. Since part of the west

foundation and the west end of the south cross wall were missing, it is surmised
that the brick walls have been salvaged for use elsewhere.
Building trenches that were cut about 4 inches below the original ground
surface and extended 6 inches on each side of the f’trst brick course were found
during the 1985 excavations along the cross wall and tl~. east wall.
The red bricks used to build the house and the ciste,m were hand-made from
local subsurface clays; they measured 4-1/2 by 2 by 9 inches and were made in
molds, but no evidence of brick-making or firing was found in the area of the
structure, so it can be surmised that the bricks were made next to one of the nearby
oxbow lakes----Oyster Creek, or even the Brazos River--because of the ready access
there to raw materials.
In front of each hearth are brick-lined compartments of very poor workmanship
that were not incorporated into the original house walls. They were made of the same
kind of brick used to build the house, but incorporated many broken bricks as well;
the bricks used to build the compartments were placed on the ground about 6 inches
above the bottom brick course. We believe these compartments are small cellars
used for the storage of food, for small root cellars similarly located are common
zanong Colonial slave houses of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries
(Kelso 1984:30-31). So itcan be asked if this is evidence of occupation by a former
slave family when the plantation was share-cropped after the Civil War or if this is
a slave tradition passed down from generation to generation?
The small structure about 16 feet west of the house was built from the same kind
of brick as the house, with the addition of late nineteenth century commercial bricks;
it may be a later outbuilding such as a smokehouse.
The cistern, 10 feet from the south end of the house along its longitudinal axis,
has an inside diameter of about 14.5 feet, and a double-course brick wall, thickly
plastered on the inside with mortar that extends up and over the top of the last brick
course, about 2 inches above the ground surface. This type of construction is unlike
any other cistern seen in Brazoria County; cisterns there usually have arched brick
shoulders and narrow round chimneys that protrude well above the ground surface.
This may mean that the original roof had been removed, and the cistern was used
for some other purpose such as a stock tank. The cistern was not excavated (dirt
filled it to within 3 feet of the surface), but probing indicated its depth to be 8 to 10
feet below ground surface.
A floorboard lip that shows on a wall profile and the assumption that the stepped
brick foundation was subterrannean, all indicate that the original ground surface did
not differ much from the present. This area is not regularly subject to flooding, and
there apparently has been less than a foot of soil deposition on top of the 1900-era
artifacts.
UNMODIFIED BONES
The collection from 41BO143, Site B has more than 6,700 vertebrate animal
remains weighing about 17 kg and comprising 350 fish bones and fish scales, 10

128

Texas Archeological Society

amphibian bones, 450 reptile bones, 330 bird bones, and more than 5,600 mammal
bones (the bone counts include both fragments and whole bones). The vertebrate
remains were identified by comparison with bones in the collections of W. L.
McClure and the Houston Archeological Society.
Vertebrates
Fish (Hubbs 1982)
The gar (Atractosteus or Lepisosteus sp.) is represented by scales (2), vertebrae (2), and sculptured head bone fragments (3), but these are not sufficient
for separation of the alligator gar from other species. The channel catfish
(lctalurus punctatus) is represented by 11 bones--frontal, nasal, ceratohyal,
cleithrum, clavicle, dorsal spine, pectoral spine (2), and vertebrae (3). The bullhead (Ictalurus cf. melas) is represented by clavicle and pectoral spine (3). The
largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) is represented by 37 bones-preopercular (8), opercular (3), subopercular, interopercular, articular (2), dentary
(2), maxilla (4), premaxilla (2), basipterygium (3), cleithrum (2), vertebra (3),
pelvic spine (3), pterygiophore (2), and one other head bone, and 24 scales. The
sunfish (Lepomis sp.) is represented by 81 bones---preopercular (15), opercular
(14), subopercular, interopercular (2), dentary (2), parasphenoid, premaxilla,
supra-occipital, basipterygium, spine (18), cleithrum (14), pterygiophore (6), and
5 other head bones, and one scale.. The red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) is represented by dentary, dorsal spine, and a scale. Unidentified fish are represented
by 160 bones--vertebrae and various other fragments--and 22 scales.
Amphibians (Dixon 1987)

The collection includes 10 bones of three kinds of amphibians. The Gulf coast
toad (Bufo valliceps) is represented by sacrum, radio-ulna, ilium (3), and tibiofibula. The bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) is represented by femur and ilium. The
southern leopard frog (Rana sphenocephala) is represented by tibio-fibula (2).
Reptiles (Dixon 1987)
In the collection there are 450 reptile bones--~ne crocodilian, four kinds of
turtles, and a snake. The American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) is represented by 10 bones--mandible, articular, tooth (2), dermal bone (5), and ulna
fragment. The snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina ) is represented by 46
bones----carapace (29), plastron (4), scapula (3), radius, ulna (2), hyoid bone,
cervical vertebra, tibia (3), and fibula (2). The stinkpot (Sternotherus odoratus)
is represented by only a single left hypoplastron. A large Eastern box turtle is
represented by 9 bones---carapace (6), plastron (2), and tibia. The red-eared slider
(Trachemys scripta) is the most common turtle in the collection with 333 bones-carapace (200), plastron (40), dentary (3), scapula (16), humerus (16), radius
(3), ulna (3), cervical vertebra, coracoid (13), ischium (3), ilium (7), pubis (5),

Gross et al. m Eagle Island Plantation

129

femur (10), tibia (4), and fibula (15). The only snake bone in the collection is a
midbody vertebra of a rat snake (Elaphe obsoleta).
Birds (Terres 1980)

The collection comprises 330 bones of at least 14 kinds of birds; 125 bones
are of water birds and include the upper and lower beaks of the double-crested
cormorant. The many species of ducks and geese that pass through Brazoria
County make it impossible to identify all the bones of the waterfowl, but comparisons with bones of known birds allow tentative identification. If some of the
bones attributed to the following waterfowl are not of the species named, they
are of a closely related species of the same size. Two bones that match the Canada
goose (Branta canadensis) are ulna and phalanx No. 1 of digit 2 of the wing.
Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) is represented by 62 bones--mandible (3), articular, skull fragment, synsacrum, humerus (6), radius (4), ulna (3), scapula (5),
coracoid (8), carpometacarpus (6), phalanx No. 1 of digit 2 of wing, phalanx
No. 2 of digit 1 of wing, furculum (3), sternum fragment (5), rib, tibiotarsus (8),
and tarsometatarsus (5).
Twenty-one bones closely match the American wigeon (Anas americana):
articular, cervical vertebra, coracoid (2), humerus (5), ulna (4), carpometacarpus
(4), furculum, sternum fragment (2), femur, and tibiotarsus. Five bones match
the northern shoveler (Anas clypteata): coracoid (2), scapula, humerus, and
carpometacarpus. Thirty-one bones match the teal (Anas discors or crecca):
mandible, coracoid (5), humerus (10), radius (3), ulna, carpometacarpus (5),
furculum, rib, and tibiotarsus (4). Two ulnae are probably of the ruddy duck
(Oxyura jamaicensis).
The two domestic birds in the collection are turkey (Meleagris gallopavo),
with 16 bones: cervical vertebra, radius, ulna (4), carpometacarpus, coracoid,
femur, tibiotarsus, tarsometatarsus (3), and phalanx (3), and domestic chicken
(Gallus domesticus), with 135 bones: skull, dentary (2), vertebra (13), synsacrnm
(3), scapula (13), humerus (10), radius (8), ulna (8), carpometacarpus (8), cuneiform, phalanx No. 1 of digit 2 of wing, phalanx No. 2 of digit 2 of wing (2),
rib (3), tibiotarsus (11), coracoid (16), ischium, sternum, femur (7), tarsometatarsus (15), fibula (3), and phalanx of foot (9). The red-tailed hawk (Buteo
jamaicensis) is represented by the coracoid and synsacrnm.
Two game birds are in the collection. The bobwhite (Colinus virginianus)
is represented by only a humerus. The mourning dove (Zenaida macroura) bones
are coracoid (2), sternum, carpometacarpus, femur, and tarsometatarsus. There
are two perching birds in the collection. The mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos)
is represented by femur and tibiotarsus. The blue jay (Cyanocitta cristata) is
represented by humerus, ulna (4), and carpometacarpus. A total of 36 bird bones
were not identified as to species. These are vertebra (5), scapula (2), humerus
(3), carpometacarpus (4), phalanx No. 1 of digit 2 of wing (2), phalanx No. 2 of
digit 2 of wing, coracoid (2), sternum, synsacrnm, tibiotarsus (2), tarsometatarsus (7), and fragments (6).

130 Texas Archeological Society
Mammals (Schmidly 1983)

A total of 5614 bones of 18 species of mammal was recovered. The Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana) is represented by 96 bones: maxilla, premaxilla, other skull fragments (8), mandible (7), loose teeth (6), vertebra (17),
scapula (8), humerus (15), radius, ulna (10), innominate (2), femur (6), rib, and
metacarpal. Three leporids are represented in the collection. The 38 eastern
cottontail (Sylvilagusfloridanus) bones are mandible (3), vertebra (3), scapula
(3), humerus (3), radius, ulna, innominate (6), sacrum, femur (3), tibia (5), calcaneus (4), and metatarsal (5). The 114 swamp rabbit (Sylvilagus aquaticus)

long bone fragment (2), and phalanx (22). In the collection are also 4,546 fragments
of mammal bones that are too fragmentary to assign to species.
Vertebrate Discussion
The excavations yielded remains of at least 47 species of vertebrates--6 of
fish, 3 of amphibians, 6 of reptiles, 14 of birds, and 18 of mammals. Although
most of these animals are technically edible, 16 are not believed to have been
eaten by the people who inhabited the site. Twenty-seven different species of
wild, nondomestic vertebrates apparently were eaten, and, in addition, four varieties of domesticated animals were a major part of the food resources of the
people.
Nonfood Vertebrates:
The 16 animals included in this category are Gulf Coast toad, southern leopard frog, stinkpot, rat snake, double-crested cormorant, red-tailed hawk, blue
jay, mockingbird, Louisiana pocket gopher, hispid cotton rat, eastern woodrat,
roof rat, Norway rat, long-tailed weasel, domestic dog, and domestic cat. The
toad, frog, stinkpot, and snake may have been killed by the inhabitants but it is
probable that some were inadvertent inclusions in the deposits. Cormorants
(Phalacrocorax auritus) may have been shot, but their flesh is so oily and fishy
that the people probably would not have eaten it, and hawks may have been
shot as potential raiders of the chicken yards. The people apparently kept a few
cats and dogs; the cats may have been responsible for the bones of small birds
and small rodents in the soil. However, the quantities and distribution of the
bones of the gophers and rats strongly indicate that owls or other raptors were
responsible. Weasels were probably killed for their fur.
Food Source Nondomestic Vertebrates:
The 27 animals included in this category are gar, channel catfish, bullhead,
largemouth bass, sunfish, red drum, bullfrog, American alligator, snapping turtle,
eastern box turtle, red-eared slider, Canada goose, mallard, American wigeon,
northern shoveler, teal, ruddy duck, bobwhite, mourning dove, Virginia opossum, eastern cottontail, swamp rabbit, black-tailed jack rabbit, gray squirrel, fox
squirrel, raccoon, and white-tailed deer.

Food Source Domestic Vertebrates:
The four animals in this category are turkey, chicken, pig, and cow. The
turkeys may have been wild and the pigs too, but all were probably domestic
animals under the control of the inhabitants or their neighbors.

Texas Areheological Society
Summary of Vertebrates

All the wild varieties of animals in the collection are common elements of the
local fauna; the water birds are seasonal. The imported roof rat and Norway rat were
apparently well established at the time of the deposits. All of the fish could have been
caught in the nearby Brazos River or Oyster Creek and, except for the red drum, they
could have come from the small lakes that are even closer. The red drum may have
been caught at the coast, only a few miles from the site. This fish and a few fragments
of marine arthropods, echinoderms, and mollusks are the only indications that the
people at Eagle Island visited the beach. The alligator, bullfrog, and water turtles
could have been acquired at the local lakes, fiver, or creek. The goose, bobwhite,
dove, box turtle, deer, and small mammals would have been available in the nearby
wooded areas or the fields between them. The opossum, raccoon, and weasel may
have been trapped for the fur trade as well as for food. The people or their neighbors
were either raising turkeys, chickens, pigs, and cattle, or they acquired these species
from a market. All four varieties of domestic animals were butchered on the
premises from whole, live individuals.
The people were both harvesting locally available fish, frogs, turtles, alligators, birds, and mammals and relying on the four domestic animals. They kept
a few cats and dogs, the latter, perhaps, for assistance in hunting. The smaller
birds and mammals were preyed upon by raptors that probably roosted on the
houses. The vast amount of bone material recovered inside the house, the high
percentage of fragmentary material, and the fact that many of the bones were
burned all suggest that the house was used as a dumping site in its later years.
CONCLUSIONS

We believe the construction of the brick house and cistern most probably
dates to the 1840s, but not before the late 1830s, in part because of the substantial nature and type of brick construction and in part because of the earliest dated
artifacts recovered. The small brick foundation west of the house was probably
built, or at least repaired, after the Civil War. The fact that the structure was
near the roads to the river landing, the sugar mill, and the slave quarters (see
Figure 2) indicates that it was the overseer’s home, which was usually a center
for the business transactions of a working plantation. We have been unable to
locate evidence of the brick slave cabins, which, according to the hand-drawn
map (Figure 1) are down the road leading northeastward toward the sugar mill
and Bend Lake. In the 1840s, both William H. and John Wharton had died, and
William’s son John was still a boy, often at school elsewhere, so there would
have been no family man to run the plantation. The artifact assemblage indicates residential occupation by a working-class family. The structure appears to
have been occupied continuously from the 1840s toward 1900, with the preponderance of artifacts dating late in this period, indicating that one or a succession
of middle-class farm families, perhaps with the names of Maxie (or Maxey),

Gross et aL m Eagle Island Plantation

133

Eicher, Masterson, or Dolly may have lived in the house or in the area. At some
time after occupation ceased, the brick walls and part of the foundation were
salvaged for other uses.
The density of artifacts in soil zone B inside the walls suggests that the house
went into disuse sometime after 1875 and was used thereafter, but no later than
1900, as a dumping site. The large number of household items (metal, buttons,
etc.) indicates that the house may have collapsed on a large portion of the interior furnishings during one of the major hurricanes that hit the area in 1875,
1886, or 1900. Salvage of the wrecked structure would have left a major share
of the contents of the house as a pile of rubble that was then a likely spot for a
dump. In fact, some of the dumping could be a one-time episode associated with
cleanup of the area after the same storm that caused the collapse. The large
amount of bone material further supports the dumping hypothesis, since few
people would dump such a quantity of food refuse inside their homes. Since
more than 150 bones of five small rodent species were concentrated along the
north cross-wall, there may have been an owl roost atop this wall after human
occupation ended, but while the walls still stood. So human occupation may have
ended (perhaps due to only partial destruction in a hurricane or abandonment
due to the poor financial condition of the owners during Reconstruction) before
total destruction of the walls, again making this a likely spot for dumping or for
salvaging bricks. In any event, the artifacts indicate that there was no significant use of the site after 1900, and all above-ground evidence of the structure
had gone by the early 1940s, since 1940s residents (interviewed in 1984) who
were aware of the cistern there, recall no structure in the area.
This site was unusual in the great quantity and high quality of the artifacts
collected. Only about a third of the interior of the house, and only 7 percent of the
overall study area, was excavated, yet the volume of artifacts strained our capacities
to catalog, analyze, and store them. Questions that remain to be answered are the
function of the small outbuilding west of the house, the location of the kitchen, and
the function of other outbuilding sites discovered during the initial survey.
Additional excavations were carried out in 1989, but the results of that work are
not included in this report. Artifacts and field notes from the 1989 investigation are
stored together with the materials from 1984 and 1985 at the Brazosport Museum
of Natural Science.

The Goldsmith Site (41WD208): Investigations of the
Titus Phase in the Upper Sabine River Basin, Wood
County, Texas
Timothy K. Perttula, Bob 19. Skiles, and Bonnie C. Yates

ABSTRACT
Salvage and test excavations at the Goldsmith site (41WD208), on Dry Creek
in the Upper S abine B asin of East Texas, yielded significant information on a Late
Caddoan Titus phase house site with an associated trash midden and cemetery. On
the basis of similarities in material culture and s tylistic ceramic motifs, the site may
be but one in a cluster of comparable and contemporaneous sites nearby that are
considered part of the Three Basins subcluster. Single homestead/farmsteads are
the most common type of Late Caddoan settlements in the Upper Sabine Basin.
However, the scrutiny of professional and avocational archeologists has been
concentrated on the cemeteries associated with the homesteads and has overlooked
sites such as Goldsmith, which also hold considerable potential for the investigation of Late Caddoan subsistence systems, local and regional settlement patterns,
and changes in sociopolitical organization.

INTRODUC~ON
The Goldsmith site, a Late Caddoan Titus phase hamlet in the Upper Sabine
River Basin, Wood County, Texas, was discovered in the fall of 1984 when a service
road was cut through the area to a well pad in the Quitman Oil Field. During
construction of the well platform, which had been built up from fdl dirt bulldozed
from a deep road cut, disturbed archeological materials were found, and a local
collector reported that large fragments of ceramic vessels had been found on the
surface.
On close examination of the cut, the collectorfound a pottery vessel in situ in
the bank. Subsequent digging by the collector exposed nine more pottery vessels
and two greenstone celts that were in an ENE-WSW-oriented burialpit. As is typical
for Caddoan burials excavated in the highly acidic, sandy soils of the Piney Woods,
no traces of human bone were preserved in the burial pit. Other burials or clusters
of pottery vessels were removed in random potholing by unknown individuals who
dug in an area about a meter north of the f’trst burial; these discoveries stimulated
a spate ofpothunting at the site. Within a few days, a 10-meter-wide area around the
fhst burial and a nearby midden had been pockmarked by dozens of potholes.
Skiles made a reconnaissance of the site more than a month after the initial
disturbances in order to assess the condition and character of the archeological

deposits. At that time, it was noted that the roadcut had bisected a small, dense
midden deposit about 30 meters to the southeast of the area where the ceramic
vessels and burials had been disturbed (Figures 1, 2). Many potholes had been
dug along the edges of the midden, but, because of a large pile of trees that had
been put there when the roadway was cleared, most of the midden was protected
by its inaccessibility.
Pothunting apparently subsided after the initial discoveries. However, in the
interest of preserving the midden and remaining cemetery areas, the owner of
the property agreed to try to curb further vandalism by installing a locked gate
and No Trespassing signs on the road to the site. Unfortunately, though, within
the month many additional potholes had been dug in the cemetery area and the
midden, and it became clear that the site could not be adequately protected or
preserved by these measures. Considering the likelihood that the site would be
destroyed by uncontrolled pothunting, due in part to its ready accessibility, it
was decided to recover as much data on the site as was possible in lieu of preservation. These limited investigations, in which Dr. James Bruseth, then Director of the Archaeology Research Program at Southern Methodist University,
played an integral role by devising a field strategy and encouraging the work,
were carded out in January and September 1985, by Skiles and Perttula, with
volunteer assistance from Mr. Robert Turbeville and Ms. Peggy Trachte.

NATURAL SETTING
The Goldsmith site is on Dry Creek, a permanent tributary of Lake Fork Creek,
in the westem part of the Gulf Coastal Plain of Texas. The floodplain of Lake Fork
Creek is about 7 km downstream from the site, and it is 20 km further from the
floodplain to the confluence of Lake Fork Creek with the Sabine River in southcentral Wood County. The headwaters of Dry Creek and its tributaries are 5 to 10
km to the north-northwest of Goldsmith; the creek flows generally southward from
Coke, Texas to its confluence with ~e Fork Creek due south of the town of
Quitman, Texas (Figure 3).
Three major biotic communities have been recognized on the western part of
the Gulf Coastal Plain in East Texas: the Oak-Hickory or Post Oak Savannah, the
Blackland Prairie, and the Oak-Hickory-Pine forest or Piney Woods (Blair 1950).
The Post Oak Savannah is a narrow southwest-northeast-trending belt of woodland
that ap~ars to mark a natural transition zone between the more xeric (drier)
Blackland Prairie to the west and the Oak-Hickory-Pine Forest to the east (Ktichler
1964). The Goldsmith site is within the modern boundary of the Piney Woods.
The Piney Woods consist of medium tall to tall deciduous trees with shortleaf
and loblolly pines; they are typically on upland fine sandy loam soils with adequate
moisture storage. In some cases, the presence of pine represents a subclimax
vegetational association or fire disclimax (Gould 1969). Poorly drained soils in the
biotic community may create a favorable habitat for prairie, dominated by big
bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, and Indiangrass (Marietta and Nixon 1984).

The Sabine River and its tributary floodplains form bottomland communities of hardwood and swamp forests. Basic components of the floodplain hardwood forests are sweetgum, water oak, overcup oak, willow oak, and cottonwood.
Other trees commonly found in the alluvial floodplain are green ash, black willow, American elm, river birch, and American hornbeam (U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers 1975). Swamp forests on the floodplain have overstories of black
tupelo, elm, overcup oak, and green ash. These areas are inundated, except during
periods of prolonged drought. This swamp forest is most extensive in the floodplain of the Sabine River, but patches of it also grow on the very wet tributary
creekbottoms (e.g., Nixon et al. 1983).

The East Texas part of the western Gulf Coastal Plain is within the
Austroriparian province defined by Blair (1950)i Included in the 47 species of
mammals, 39 species of reptiles, and 17 species of amphibians are many that
reach the limits of their ranges in the southeastern United States. Exploitable
species have been generally summarized by Thurmond (1981 :Table 2), Bruseth
and others (1977:Tables 4, 5), and, for the Big Cypress and Upper Sabine basins, by Espey, Huston and Associates, Inc. (1984).
The climate of the Upper Sabine River Basin is humid, with average winter
temperatures of 8°C (47°F) and summer temperatures of 28°C (83° F); droughts
are not uncommon. The first freeze in winter usually comes between mid-November and December 1, and the last freeze, in mid-March (Arbingast et al.
1973:19). Mean annual precipitation varies from about 115 to 125 mm in the
Upper Sabine Basin (Texas Almanac 1986). Periods of maximum rainfall come
in the spring and fall seasons.
East Texas paleoenvironmental and climatic conditions are poorly known,
and only limited evidence of past environments has been acquired that is pertinent to reconstructing the Late Holocene (2000-200 years B.P.) environmental
setting at the Goldsmith site (e.g., Bryant and Holloway 1985). Preliminary
analyses of Late Holocene pollen samples suggest a dry-moist-dry episodic pattern in the Late Holocene comparable to the Northeast Oklahoma data from the
Cross Timbers, Osage Savannah, and Cherokee Prairie districts (Hall 1982; Reid
and Artz 1984). Pine, in particular, becomes one of the major constituents of the
pollen record at Ferndale Bog in Southeast Oklahoma about 1000 B.P., invading the area at about 1800 B.P. (Albert 1981). Pollen records from the Buck
Creek Marsh in the Big Sandy Creek basin of Wood County suggest that pine
invaded the valley between 1810 and 1130 B.P. and was the dominant overstory
species by about A.D. 500 (Holloway 1987).
Dendroclimatic reconstructions are more specific than pollen records in
determining proxy climatic data from the last 500 years and have the potential
to be extended to the period between 1,000 and 5,~ years ago (Stahle, Cook,
and White 1985). Drought reconstructions using annual tree ring chronologies
from old-growth baldcypress indicate that there were many wet and dry spells
comparable to twentieth century events between about A.D. 1500 and 1700, the
estimated range of time when the Goldsmith site was occupied. In particular,
droughts of more than 10 years have been estimated around A.D. 1555, 1570,
1595, and 1670, separated by wetter periods around 1540, 1600, 1620, and 1665
(Stahle, Cleaveland and Hehr 1985:Figure 3b). The period between A.D. 1549
and 1577 has been suggested as representing the worst June drought in the past
450 years (Stahle, Cleaveland and Hehr 1985:532). The variation and intensity
of climatic fluctuations is of singular importance to the Late Caddoan inhabitants of the Goldsmith site because of their presumed dependence upon maize
agriculture as a subsistence base &erttula et al. 1983:96).
The Goldsmith site is on the edge of an upland landform overlooking the
Dry Creek floodplain. A relict channel of Dry Creek, called Blue Lake by local

144

residents, runs along the base of the steep upland slope about 100 meters
southeast of the site. Blue Lake is a permanent water source that has never
completely evaporated even in the hottest and driest summers (H. B. Goldsmith,
personal communication).
PREVIOUS RESEARCH AND CULTURAL SETTING
Archeological research in the Caddoan area, of which the Upper Sabine Basin
is a part, has a lengthy history that is impractical to summarize here (see S tory 1978;
Webb 1978). The reader is referred to Perttula et al. (1986:35-59) for an overview
of the history of previous archeological research investigations in the Upper Sabine
River Basin.
In the immediate vicinity of the Goldsmith site, the University of Texas
conducted investigations between 1930 and 1934, led by A. T. Jackson, M. M.
Reese, and A. M. Wilson. The fieldwork concentrated primarily around Quitman
in the Dry Creek and Lake Fork Creek basins (Reese 1931; Wilson and Jackson
1930). Eighty-two sites were identified, 12 of which were the subject of burial
excavations and midden and structural mound trenching (Table 1). Several of
the sites, particularly J. H. Reese (41WD2) and L. L. Winterbauer (41WD6),
closely resemble Goldsmith in ceramic assemblages and community/settlement
patterning, and all three are now recognized as generally contemporaneous Titus
phase occupations. What was evident even in research sponsored by the University of Texas was the concentration of archeological sites in the Dry Creek-Little
Dry Creek basins, a situation that has not been altered since in the years of archeological research conducted in Wood County.
Not until the 1950s did Late Caddoan settlements in the area around Quitman
receive renewed attention. In 1959 Robert Turbeville, an avocational archeologist in Mineola, Texas, excavated 15 burials from a Titus phase cemetery at
41WD19 on Dry Creek, 1.2 km west-southwest of Goldsmith. This led to further work by Turbeville in Wood County at 41WD44 and 41WD206, Titus phase
middens and cemeteries on Dry and Muddy creeks, 0.6 and 2.5 km north and
northeast of Goldsmith, respectively (Figure 4). This work has provided significant information on Late Caddoan settlement patterns in the Upper Sabine River
Basin (Skiles et al. 1980).
In 1975, Southern Methodist University’s Archaeology Research Program
began fieldwork in the proposed Lake Fork Reservoir on Lake Fork Creek and
tributaries in Wood, Rains, and Hopkins counties, about 25 to 40 km from
Goldsmith. Several of the sites chosen for excavation in 1976, 1978, and 1979 had
Late Caddoan components, including the Glen (41WD524), Gilbreath (41WD538),
Killebrew (41WD495), Sandhill (41WD108), and Spoonbill (41WDI09) sites
(Bruseth et al. 1977:127-138; Bruseth and Perttula 1980, 1981).
Sites of this period were classified as components of the Forest Hill phase, a
local manifestation of the Titus phase in the Caney Creek drainage system (Bruseth
and Perttula 1981:142). The only absolute date obtained on a Forest Hill phase

As an adjunct to the fieldwork in Lake Fork Reservoir, several sites in the Lake
Fork Creek Basin outside the project area have been investigated by Southern
Methodist University. The Steck (41WD529), Burks (41WD52), and Pine Tree
(41WD51) sites have well-preserved Late Caddoan habitation features and both
faunal and floral remains that have provided useful comparative information for
understanding the Late Caddoan archeological record in the Upper Sabine River
Basin (Hockensmith 1977; Perttula et al. n.d.).
INVESTIGATION OF THE CEMETERY AREA

We decided to concentrate our work at the Goldsmith site first on the cemetery
area (Figure 5), because most of the surreptitious digging had been done there, and
more vandalism was anticipated. The midden was at least partially protected by the
trees that were piled upon it.
We probed the cemetery area systematically on a closely spaced grid before any excavating, in order to locate any remaining burials and to plan future
work. Pothunters were so active that it was not deemed advisable to leave burials partly excavated, and, since the amount of work planned had to be limited in
accordance with our resources, a stainless steel "whip antenna" about 2 meters
long was used to probe randomly in the areas directly adjacent to the first burial

removed by the collector. This was simply a test to ascertain the suitability of
the soil for probing, but within 15 minutes a ceramic vessel was detected about
2 meters northeast of the first burial removed by the collector. A shovel test
about 30 cm in diameter was excavated to a depth of about 1 meter to confirm
the existence of the vessel. Further concentrated probing revealed a subsurface
declivity in the clayey sand B-horizon that was a pit feature oriented generally
east-west with several other vessels in it. In this area the A-horizon is a tan sand
about 80 cm thick, and the underlying B-horizon subsoil is a mottled yellow
clayey sand.
A 2.40-by-2.40-meter unit was centered over the burial pit and pottery vessels
of Burial No. 1 (Figure 6). After removing pothole backdirt piles from the surface,
the unit was excavated by shovel skimming in about 2.5-cm-thick levels. No pit
outline was detected in the light tan, coarse loamy sand A-horizon until just above
the B-horizon at about 78 cm below the surface. The upper parts of several vessels

were also reached at this level. The bottom of the burial pit extended 35 cm into the
B-horizon subsoil (Figure 7).
The burial pit, which measures 1.85 by 1.00 meters, contained seven ceramic
vessels distributed over the chest area and along each side of the individual (Figure
8). No traces of bone were noted, but on the basis of several studies of Late Caddoan
Titus phase mortuary patterning (Thurmond 1981; Turner 1978; Bell 1981) it was
assumed that the individual was placed in extended, supine position and oriented
with the feet to the west. With the burial were seven vessels: one Harleton Applique
jar (Vessel 1), four Ripley Engraved carinated bowls (Vessels 2-4, 6), one Nash
Neck-Banded jar (Vessel 5), and a single WilderEngraved bottle (Vessel 7). A large
part of Vessel 4 had been freshly broken and was missing. Several recently broken
sherds from a large red-slipped Ripley Engraved carinated bowl were underneath
the remaining fragments of Vessel 4. This corner of the burial pit apparently had
been recently disturbed, although the nature of the disturbance could not be
determined.
After Burial No. 2, about 5 meters west-northwest of Burial No. 1 (see Figure
6), was located, a 2-by-2-meter unit was laid out over the burial pit. No burial
pit outline could be detected until, at 70 cm below the present ground surface,
the B-horizon, into which the burial extended about 10 cm, was reached. The
burial pit measured 2.25 by 1.15 meters, and was oriented NE-SW (Figure 9).
Again, no bone was preserved in the pit, but it is assumed that the head was
oriented roughly toward the northeast in conformance with Burial No. 1 and all
known adult Titus phase burials in the Dry Creek drainage.
Grave goods were distributed irregularly throughout the Burial No. 2 pit below
presumed shoulder level. Two greenstone celts were in the pelvic area, and a group
of four arrowpoints (three Maud and one Bassett type), and an engraved ceramic
elbow pipe with a flaring bowl, were between the legs at about the knee level (see
Figure 9). Two roughly shaped tools of locally available ferruginous sandstone were
at the feet; these may have been used as digging tools in the preparation of the burial
pit. Another group of four Maud arrowpoints was placed along the left (east) edge
of the burial pit. A possible Talco arrowpoint was recovered on the B-horizon

contact level only 50 cm outside the burial pit, and a Maud arrowpoint was found
on backdirt from the burial pit. Both are assumed to be displaced from Burial No.
2 (Table 2).
All of the pottery vessels in Burial No. 2 were substantially complete except for Vessels No. 5 and 6. These two vessels had apparently been stacked or
nested near the feet, and were crushed when a large tree root grew through them,
for large parts of these vessels are missing. Vessels were in the shoulder and
feet areas of the burial pit.

Cemeteries of the Dry Creek Drainage
Cemeteries of the Dry Creek drainage are usually small in size, averaging 10
individuals (subadults and adults) each; children were placed in pits below house
floors. Cemeteries in Dry Creek are small when compared to Late Caddoan
cemeteries along Big Cypress Creek and its tributaries (Turner 1978; Thurmond
1981). Burials are single, extended inhumations with burial goods--ceramic
vessels, petaloid celts, ceramic elbow pipes, and arrow points--at the sides,

shoulders, and about the heads of the individuals. Ceramic vessels used as grave
goods include not only locally manufactured Ripley Engraved, Wilder Engraved,
McKinney Plain, and Maydelle Incised, but also wares such as Avery Engraved and
Simms Engraved that may have been manufactured on the Red River and exchanged
with Titus phase groups in the Upper Sabine River Basin (Thurmond 1985:193).
The small size of the cemeteries, their demographic profiles of roughly equal
adult male and female representation, few adolescents, and no children, plus limited
evidence for internal rank differentiation, all are indicative of the type of mortuary
population expected in family units occupying a household for only a short period
of time ~ose 1984:240; Shafer 1981:156). Burials in the household cemeteries
occur as single interments in patterned arrangements of burials oriented and placed
by spacing considerations that are duplicated in cemeteries from each of the Titus
phase spatial clusters (e.g., Thurmond 1981, 1985).
According to Thurmond (1981:455-456),

adolescents were buried with more offerings than children or infants, and
with fewer offerings than adults. The graves of males often contain clusters
of arrowpoints in patterns suggesting quivers of arrows, and those of
females contain polishing stones or more numerous pottery vessels. Items
of exotic material . . . are extremely rare. The occurrence of graves
containing very large numbers of artifacts is also quite limited.
In the absence of identifiable skeletal remains from the Goldsmith site, the
grave goods suggest that Burial No. 1 was probably an adult female and Burial No.
2 was an adult male. However, without a body of data on grave goods associations
in cases where skeletal material permits determination of age and gender, this can
be considered only the merest suggestion.
Because grave goods at Goldsmith are comparable to those in more intensively
investigated Titus phase cemeteries (Table 3), mortuary practices are probably the
same throughout the Cypress Cluster, as noted earlier by Thurmond (1981).
Included in the total of artifacts at the Goldsmith site are data from a local collector
on a third burial that had been exposed in the road cut. That burial contained one
small plain jar, one large utility jar with incised lines at the rim/body juncture, five

TEST EXCAVATIONS AT THE GOLDSMITH SITE TRASH MIDDEN
Test excavations were conducted at the Goldsmith site trash midden in an
attempt to obtain a controlled sample of artifacts and ecofacts associated with the
nonmortuary life of the people who used the cemetery. Midden excavations in Titus
phase occupations in the Upper S abine River B asin are still rather limited, compared
to cemetery excavations, but they are obviously a necessary priority in attempts to
arrive at a balanced understanding of Titus phase lifeways.
The midden, which was estimated to cover about a 50-square-meter area, had
been partially disturbed by road construction and illegal digging, and many sherds,
fragments of bone and mussel shell, and charcoal flecks were noted on the backdirt
of the potholes.
The goals of the test excavations were (1) examine the subsurface context of
the archeological deposit and assess its integrity, (2) obtain stratigraphic artifactual
data, and (3) find in situ ceramic sherds of suitable size for thermoluminescence
dating. Only a few areas in the midden were accessible for test excavations because
of pothunter disturbances along the midden edge exposed in the roadcut. However,
an area near the roadcut that was outside these disturbed areas and did not require
extensive clearing (see Figures 2 and 5) was chosen, and two 1-by-l-meter units
were cleared and excavated in arbitrary 10-cm levels to 40 to 50 cm below the
surface.
Stratigraphy and Character of the Midden
Stratigraphy was relatively simple in the midden (Figure 10). Exposed first was
a 9-to-14-cm thick, gray, organic-rich A-horizon plow zone in which cultural

154

materials, particularly ceramic artifacts, occur in quantity. Underlying the plow
zone is a dark gray to black (10YR3/2-10YR2/2) charcoal- and ash-mottled midden
deposit 12 to 23 cm thick. The midden contains extensive amounts of ceramics and
bone, as well as charred nutshells and fragments of freshwater mussel shell.
Ceramics in the midden are larger than in the plow zone, but are not necessarily more
common by number or weight. The densest accumulation of cultural materials is at
the base of the midden, which is extensively disturbed by rodent krotovinas
(burrows) and root action as well. A thermoluminescence sample of a Ripley
Engraved bowl with a scroll motif was recovered from 28 cm below the surface in
the midden, but a date could not be obtained because the sherd had anomalous fading
(e.g., Aitken 1985:54-59). The midden rests on a gray-yellow sand subsoil in which
cultural materials are quite common; sterile deposits were not reached in these
limited test excavations.

Zooarcheological Remains in the Upper Sabine Basin

Zooarcheological assemblages recovered from the Taddlock (41WD482) and
Steck (41WD529) sites in the Upper Sabine Basin document the fact that considerably heterogenous faunal populations were present about A.D. 1000 to 1600
(Perttula and Bruseth 1983; Perttula et al. 1983). Recovered from Taddlock were
faunal elements from 16 species of mammals, 12 species of birds, 8 species of
reptiles or amphibians, and 9 species of fish. Several of the bird species were not
permanent East Texas residents, including the pied-bill grebe, green-wing teal, and
yellow-shafted flicker, but the majority of the animals recovered from Taddlock are
year-round inhabitants of East Texas. The habitat range of species indicates that
most animals were associated with an open oak-hickory forest with many grassland

Perttula, Skiles, and Yates ~ Goldsmith Site

155

areas, which is to be expected, since the Taddlock site is in the Post Oak Savannah
~erttula and Bruseth 1983:11). The most common species represented at Taddlock
are deer, racoon, beaver, squirrel, jackrabbit, opossum, turkey, carp sucker, freshwater drum, and catfish. Similar arrays of exploitable species can be expected in the
Dry Creek basin, since both the Piney Woods and discrete stands of pine are
typically faunal-poor habitats, and the majority of species hunted would be in
upland hardwoods and bottomland forests.
Dog was recovered at the Steck site in the Piney Woods (Perttula et al. 1983)
and was an important component of prehistoric and historic hunting forays in the
region (Yates 1986). Bear and bison, utilized historically by Caddoan peoples in
East Texas (Swanton 1942:134-137), were present in the western part of the Gulf
Coastal Plain. Bison were never very common in the East and North Texas prairies,
however, until the late 1703s (see Flores 1985:114), and there is no concrete
evidence of the exploitation of bison in the Upper Sabine Basin until the eighteenth
century (Lorrain 1967:Table 11).
Faunal Remains in the Goldsmith Site Midden

Faunal remains were common throughout the Goldsmith site midden deposit,
averaging 143 elements per m3. Species identified are white-tailed deer, dog, pocket
gopher, turkey, and land turtle. In character, the faunal assemblage from Goldsmith
resembles that recovered from the nearby Steck site, a single component Late
Caddoan occupation (Perttula et al. 1983:Table 4).
All of the six identified deer elements are burned or charred and represent parts
of the carcass that have very little meat (i.e., the distal metapodial, a calcaneum with
butcher marks, astragalus, and phalanx I). These elements are lower leg bones that
may have sustained f’tre damage when exposed to roasting of a hind leg. Long-bone
fragments of deer-sized mammals constitute the majority of the unidentified faunal
elements, and 83 percent of these are also burned. Only two deer are indicated in the
small sample: an adult individual, represented by the lower leg bones and a vertebral
fragment, and an immature individual represented by a scapula fragment that was
also burned.
The canid remains indicate three individuals. Each identified element is from
an individual of a different age group based on skeletal development. A fetal or
neonatal canid is represented by an unburned left distal humerus, an immature but
older dog is identified by an unfused proximal metapodial (burned), and a small but
fully adult individual is represented by an unburned lumbar vertebra. None of these
elements is directly assignable to the domestic dog, but dog remains have been
recorded in burials from several Late Caddoan sites in Wood County, including
S teck, L. L. Winterbauer, M. E. Day, Pine Tree Farm, and the Dog site (Hockensmith
1977; Wilson and Jackson 1930; Robert Turbeville, personal communication).
Two elements--a left coracoid process and a left tarsometatarsus---of a single
wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) were recovered in the midden; both elements
have been burned. Based on the size of the coracoid process it seems likely that the

156

Texas Archeological Society

turkey was a small female; turkey-size burned and unbumed faunal elements were
also noted in the zooarcheological assemblage.
One box turtle (Terrapene sp.) is represented by 14 elements, 10 of which have
been burned. Both carapace and plastron fragments were recovered in the midden.
The pocket gopher (Geomys bursarius) is represented by a relatively complete and
unburned skull; this individual, a burrowing animal, is probably the result of
postoccupational intrusion.
Mussel shell and gastropods were present throughout the midden in small
quantities; the mussel shells, most likely procured from Dry Creek, were primarily
fragmented valves that cannot be identified to species.
Floral Remains
Charred hickory and pecan nutshells were observed in the coarse-screened
(quarter-inch) debris. Flotation samples were not obtained during this phase of
excavations, but would be essential to an accurate characterization of the paleobotanical assemblage at the Goldsmith site (e.g., Perttula et al. 1983).
Artifact Assemblage in the Midden and Burials
Considering the limited extent of the investigations at the Goldsmith site, a
substantial amount of cultural debris was recovered in the midden deposits and
burials. Plain and decorated sherds were especially common, but lithic debris and
ecofactual remains were also present throughout the midden (Table 4), and whole
vessels and complete, unbroken stone tools were found in the burials.
Lithic Artifacts

A small lithic assemblage of unmodified debris, fire-cracked rock, and several
modified or completed tools has been recovered from the midden. Lithic tools and
debris occur at a density of about 80 arfifacts/m3, which is low compared to Archaic
and Early Caddoan occupations in the Upper Sabine River Basin. Other Late
Caddoan assemblages in the basin, however, share this functional/technological
characteristic with the Goldsmith site (see Bruseth and Perttula 1981:Table 6-4;
Perttula 1984). Most of the lithic debris and fire-cracked rock is probably associated
with a Late Archaic occupation rather than with the Titus phase occupation, since
lithic artifacts are scarce in Late Caddoan sites in the Upper Sabine River Basin.
The lithic debris is dominated by raw materials that are locally available,
including OgaUala quartzite from upland gravel sources. Other quartzites constitute
7.6 percent of the assemblage, and cherts, another 9.1 percent. Chert raw materials
are gray, tan, and brown cherts of local origin, and a creamy white chert of unknown
provenience. This white chert, with discernible black inclusions, closely resembles
the Frisco chert (Banks 1984:85) that comes from the Arbuckle Mountains of
southeastern Oklahoma and is available as close as the gravels of the Red River
below the mouths of the Blue River and Clear Boggy Creek in Lamar and Fannin
counties, Texas. Inspection of Frisco chert from Marshall County, Oklahoma, in

collections at the Oklahoma Archeological Survey confirmed the similarity. This
raw material is found in a number of assemblages, primarily of Middle-Late Archaic
attribution, in the Upper Sabine River Basin (Perttula et al. 1986).
Eighty-two percent of the lithic debris consists ofnoncortical tertiary elements;
only one primary element (cortex covering the entire dorsal surface) and 11
secondary elements (cortex present on the dorsal surface of the piece) were noted.
The high frequency of tertiary elements and the small size of the lithic debris
indicate that tool maintenance and resharpening activities are primarily responsible
for the composition of the lithic debris assemblage. This is consistent with the
probable functional nature of the Late Archaic occupation at Goldsmith.
Tools identified from the surface and the midden excavations are one ferruginous sandstone mano, one quartzite hammerstone, one unifacially modified piece
made of a local gray chert, one chert straight-stemmed dart point (or projectile point/
knife), and two arrowpoints. The dart point is a resharpened implement, possibly of
the Yarbrough type (Johnson 1962). The arrowpoints, manufactured of local cherts
from the Uvalde gravels, resemble the Maud and Bassett types common in the Titus
phase, and were also recovered in Burial 2 (Figure 11, c-n).
In Burial No. 2 were found eight Maud, one Talco, and one Bassett arrowpoint
(Table 5). A few pieces of lithic debris were also recovered in the burial fill,
including five chert (four of which were noncortical), one Ogallala quartzite (a
cortical element), two quartzite (one of which is a cortical element), and one
ferruginous sandstone cortical element. In shovel skimming above Burial No. 1, a
Gary variety Camden (see Schambach 1982:Table 7.2) projectile point was found
(Figure 11, A), together with a single, small (less than 4 cm long and wide) quartzite
burned rock, five tertiary elements of chert (two of which have use-wear patterns),
and a fragment of a pitted hematite stone. None of this lithic material found while
excavating Burials No. 1 and 2 seems def’mitely relatable to the Titus phase
occupation at the Goldsmith site.
The two celts from Burial No. 2 were made by pecking and/or flaking large
cobbles of greenstone (a siliceous shale lithic raw material available only in the
Ouachita !vlountains of southeastern Oklahoma [Banks and Winter 1975:27]), then
grinding and polishing the face and bit of the tool. They have tapered poll ends,
convex bit profiles with angles between 65 and 75 degrees, and bit widths ranging
from 4.6 to 5.1 cm. The celts (Figure 12, A, B) are 9.8 cm and 12.6 cm long and
resemble the Type I and II celts def’med at the Roitsch (Sam Kaufman) site in Red
River County (Ferring 1969:88-89); Type II celts were the most common type at
Lake Fork Reservoir Caddoan sites (Bruseth and Perttula 1981). The ferruginous
sandstone tools are cobble-sized pieces of raw material that have been minimally
shaped by percussion-flaking along the edges of the piece (Figure 12, C, D). Some
cortex remains on both tools, but only remnants are visible on the circular, more
extensively worked example. No use-wear can be seen along the worked edges to
indicate that they might be digging tools.
The high frequency of the use of local lithic raw materials, the recovery of
Archaic Period projectile points (including those found by collectors), the presence

of fire-cracked rock, and the appearance of a Frisco-like white chert in a nonburial
context all point primarily to an Archaic age. Middle and Late Archaic assemblages
in Lake Fork Reservoir, 20 km to the west, are notable for the use of local materials

in the reduction and production of lithic tools (Bruseth and Perttula 198 l:Table 69; Perttula 1984:Table 7.3), particularly in comparison to Caddoan assemblages
dating between A.D. 1000 and 1400. Densities of fire-cracked rocks decrease
noticeably after about A.D. 800 in the same set of sites. The Frisco-like white chert
has been identified in Early Archaic to Late Archaic contexts in several sites in the
Big Sandy Creek basin east of the Goldsmith site (Perttula et al. 1986), most
noticeably in putative Early and Middle Archaic components at the Trammell Crow
Pond site (41WD185). The Frisco-like white chert is not a common raw material in
the Big Sandy Creek basin, but its periods of use may well aid in the chronological
ordering of Archaic assemblages in the absence of datable materials.
Ceramic Artifacts
Ceramic sherds are the most common artifacts in the Goldsmith midden,
occurring in quantifies of as many as 460 sherds/m3. Considering this estimated
density, the midden probably contains about 9,000 sherds, all probably deposited
within a relatively short time span.
Three hundred sixty-eight sherds have been recovered from the midden or its
surface (Table 6). Grog-tempered sherds comprise 93 percent of the assemblage,
followed by grog/grit-tempered sherds (3 percent), and grog/bone and bonetempered specimens (2 percent). Five sherds have no discernible temper. These
differences in temper correspond to those in Late Caddoan occupations at Lake Fork
Reservoir and in the Dry Creek basin in Wood County. Bone is most commonly used
as an aplastic in Early Ceramic period and Early Caddoan period occupations,
ranging between 7 and 70 percent in ceramic assemblages at Lake Fork Reservoir
(Bruseth and Perttula 1981 :Table 5-7). At the S teck site, bone temper was present
in only 0.5 percent of the sherds, whereas bone was noted in 0.3 percent of the sherds
from the contemporaneous Late Caddoan Pine Tree Farm site (J. E. Bruseth,
personal communication, April 1987).
Inspection of cross sections of grog-tempered sherds suggests that more finely
crushed grog is used almost exclusively in Ripley Engraved vessels, and occasionally in the manufacture of Nash Neck-Banded or LaRue Neck-Banded jars. The
coarser paste with grog/grit temper is confined to sherds of the utility ware types
Harleton Appliqu6, Karnack Brushed-Incised, and McKinney Plain (Suhm and
Jelks 1962) with appliqu6, or brushingiappliqu6. These paste differences presumably relate to technological and functional variability in the way these kinds of
vessels were made and designed to be used (e.g., Steponaifis 1984:85-114).
Decorated sherds comprise 24 percent of the ceramic assemblage and are
dominated by engraving, neck banding, and various forms of appliqu6 (’fable 7).
Roughly 80 percent of the 34 rims are decorated, which is an additional measure of
the pervasiveness of decorated vessels in the Titus phase occupation at the
Goldsmith site.
All of the engraved sherds with rolled or folded rims characteristic of the Titus
phase lip treatment on carinated bowls are identified as Ripley Engraved (Figure

13). Stylistic motifs are generally difficult to determine because the sherds are so
small, but motifs that could be identified include the scroll, scroll and circle, and the
interlocking horizontal scroll (Thurmond 1985: Figure 3). These motifs are common in Three Basins subcluster sites of the Titus phase defined recently by
Thurmond (1985:193).
Other treatments of the engraved sherds include a red hematite slip (see Ferring
and Perttula 1987) on both interior and exterior surfaces (4.7 percent of the engraved
sherds), and the painting of engraved lines with hematite and kaohn (9.3 pementof
the sherds). Only 2.2 percent of the plain body sherds have a red hematite slip.
Neck-banded sherds are derived from everted rim LaRue or Nash NeckBanded jars (Figure 14, c--e, h). Surface treatment of the neck-banded jars includes
both smoothed rim coils and regularly crimped rim coils. The partially smoothed
neck-banded sherds are tempered with fine grog paste; the remainder have been
tempered with a much coarser grog. The neck-banded sherds comprise 22 percent
of the decorated sherds, compared to engraved sherds, which comprise 49 percent
of the decorated sherds. Sherds were designated LaRue/Nash Neck-Banded because it was not possible to differentiate the neck-banded sherds consistently
according to the criteria proposed by Suhm and Jelks (1962:93, 111).
The high frequency of neck-banded sherds from the Goldsmith site is comparable with other Titus phase occupations in the Dry Creek and Little Dry Creek
localities of the Three Basins subcluster, including the Steck and J. H. Reese sites
(Hockensmith 1977; Wilson and Jackson 1930). However, this comparability is not
duplicated at the Caney Creek localities in the Lake Fork Creek drainages (Bruseth
and Perttula 1981; Thurmond 1985), where only 3 to 11 percent of the decorated
sherds from the different middens at the Killebrew and Gilbreath sites have neck
bands (Table 8).
Apphqutd sherds are probably derived from the McKinney Plain and Harleton
Apphqu6 utility wares (Figure 14, f, g). The appliqu6 on plain rims usually consists
oft-diets and nodes that are placed so they divide the rims of large jars into quarters.
The appliqu6 fillets are placed vertically from just below the hp to halfway to the
rim-body juncture. Multiple inverted fillets (Figure 14, g) are also characteristic of
locally produced McKinney Plain (see Bruseth and Perttula 1981:Figure 5-8a, c);
these are placed directly below the lips of the vessels. Appliqu6 also is used in
combination with incised, brushed, and punctated decorations on Maydelle Incised,
Kamack Brushed-Incised, and Harleton Appliqu6 types of the Titus phase (Suhm
and Jelks 1962:65, 85, 103).
Brushed sherds are infrequent in sites of the Three Basins subcluster. At the
Goldsmith site, only 8 percent of the decorated sherds are brushed; at the Swauano
Creek and Big Cypress Creek subclusters they account for 40 to 60 percent of the
utility vessels (e.g., Thurmond 1985:193). However, brushing is much more
common in the Dry Creek locality during the Titus phase than it is in the Caney
Creek locality 10 to 15 km to the west (Table 8). At Goldsmith, brushing is both
vertical and horizontal, with vertical brushing of the body most frequent. One

Karnack Brushed-Incised sherd was identified from the midden; the other sherds
from the midden are body sherds from Bullard Brushed, Maydelle Incised, and
Harleton Appliqu6 utility jars.
Punctated and incised sherds are derived from the Maydelle Incised type
(Figure 14 a, b). The incised motifs are predominantely cross-hatched bands on
the rims. Nodes and horizontal rows of stick and fingernail punctations are associated with the incised lines on the rim band. Bodies of these Maydelle Incised vessels, which include everted rim jars and carinated bowls (relatively
uncommon), range from plain to brushed (see Suhm and Jelks 1962:103).
The sixteen vessels found in Burials No. 1 and 2 comprise eight Ripley
Engraved carinated bowls, one Harleton Appliqu6 jar, two Wilder Engraved
bottles, one Taylor Engraved bottle, three Nash Neck-Banded jars, and a carinated bowl of typical Ripley Engraved form, but decorated only with a single
engraved line on the vessel interior (Table 9). All of the vessels are grog tempered, but the amount of grog added to the paste is variable in and among the
different types. Polished brown and black is the most common color, and none
of the vessels has been slipped. White and red pigments have, however, been
applied to the engraved designs on seven of the eight Ripley Engraved bowls,
and on one of the Wilder Engraved bottles.
The Ripley Engraved carinated bowls have been divided into two size groups:
(1) small, with orifice diameters less than 16 cm or heights less than 9 cm (Figure
15, D, E; Figure 16, H, I); and (2) large, with orifice diameters greater than 25 cm
and vessel heights between 13 and 18 cm (Figure 15, F, G; Figure 16, A). Decorative
motifs vary within the two groups, although the scroll and circle (Thurmond
1985:Figure 3) is the most common bowl-rim motif (Figure 17). This motif is
present on 63 percent of the Ripley Engraved bowls, and the nested triangle,
interlocking scroll, and continuous scroll motifs account for the remainder of the
assemblage (Table 9). The frequency of these motifs is consistent with Thurmond’s
(1985:193) description of the Three Basins subeluster of the Titus phase. At the
nearby J. H. Reese site, the scroll and circle motif is most com mon in the large vessel
sample (at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory) from the cemetery
excavated by A. T. Jackson, followed by the continuous scroll, interlocking scroll,
and a single example of the pendant triangle motif (Vessel No. 6).
A single example of Wilder Engraved (see Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 78M for
an example from the J. H. Reese site) was found in each burial at the Goldsmith site.
These are rather squat bottles with narrow, tapering necks (Figures 15, B and 16, C),
decorated on the bodies with engraved spirals with hooked, excised arms. Vessel
No. 7 in Burial No. 1 has red pigment in the engraved lines. Wilder Engraved is
considered a local resident pottery type of the Three Basins subcluster (Thurmond
1985), although it is relatively uncommon compared to Ripley Engraved.
A black polished Taylor Engraved bottle with a spool neck and a flaring lip
(Figure 16, D) was recovered from Burial No. 2. Engraved spirals cover the entire
body. The Goldsmith example is very similar to Taylor Engraved bottles from the

ably from use over an open fire (e.g., Hally 1986) before it was put into the
grave. The rim of the vessel has single rows of punctations at the lip and at the
rim/body juncture, separated by cross-hatched incised lines. On the body are
four incised "herringbone" motifs; these are adjacent to sets of vertical appliqu6
that run from the rim/body juncture to near the base.
There are two distinct varieties of Nash Neck-Banded represented in the
vessels from the Goldsmith site. The first has appliqurd fillets on the upper body,
as well as appliqurd parentheses at the top of the rim (Figure 15, C); the second
has appliqu&l chevrons on the upper body. Both are found on vessels from Burial
No. 2 (Figure 16, A, B), which have vertical appliqu~l fillets on the bodies, and
appliqurd nodes or lugs at the tops of the rims. Similar neck-banded and
appliqurd vessels and sherds have been recovered at the J. H. Reese site and
from several sites on Caney Creek in the Lake Fork Reservoir (Bruseth and
Perttula 1981:Table 5-10).
Vessel 2 from Burial No. 2 is a polished, carinated bowl of similar shape to
Ripley Engraved vessels, with a well-defined rounded and rolled lip. It is not
decorated, however, except for a single engraved line on the interior of the vessel
at the rim/body juncture or carination (Figure 16, H).
Short-stemmed and short-bowled elbow pipe forms have been found in Late
Caddoan archeological sites in the Quitman area (Jackson 1933:71 and Plate 16).
The elbow pipe from the Goldsmith site has been decorated by two horizontal
engraved panels on the bowl, and by two engraved lines on the stem (Figure
18). Both sets of engraved lines were filled with white pigment, but the pigment
is poorly preserved. The pipe stem is 37 mm long, and the bowl is 23 mm high.
The lip profiles for both bowl and stem holes are flattened; the lips are from 3
to 5 mm thick. Grog temper was used as an aplastic in the sandy paste and,
although weathered, the pipe appears to have been polished. The bowl diameter
is about 37 mm; the exterior stem diameter is only 25 mm, and the interior stem
hole is about 4 mm in diameter.
Daub and Burned Clay
Small eroded pieces of daub and burned clay were recovered from the surface of the disturbed trash midden and from the test excavations. Both categories of fired clay are relatively amorphous, but pieces identified as daub, unlike
the burned clay, have stick and grass impressions. The daub is assumed to be
pieces of clay-plastered wall and thatch, probably from a burned structure. The
burned clay may be of the same origin, although that is difficult to ascertain
without more contextual information from the site as a whole.
Only five pieces of daub and fourteen pieces of burned clay have been
identified from the trash midden. Since ninety percent of these pieces come from the
top 20 cm of the midden deposits, including the disturbed plow zone (see Table 4),
any burning, and hence accumulation of daub/burned clay, took place at the end of
the deposition of the midden rather than at the beginning of the occupation when the

midden began to accumulate. The impressed daub specimens resemble those
identified from Late Caddoan Titus phase contexts at the Killebrew site, Midden A
(Bruseth and Perttula 1981:98), where it seemed likely that narrow-bladed grasses
were used for thatching on the house walls.
Summary of the Midden
The overall composition of the Goldsmith site trash midden ceramic assemblage compares favorably with that from the Steck site 2.5 km northeast
(Hockensmith 1977) in the relative ranking and frequency of the decorative
categories (Table 8). From this information, it is possible to infer that the Steck
and Goldsmith sites are probably contemporaneous, within +25 to 50 years,
manifestations of a Titus phase occupation in the Dry Creek locality. Ceramic
assemblages in the Caney Creek locality are different, but, because of the lack
of absolute dates for the Late Caddoan Period in the Upper Sabine Basin ~erttula
et al. 1987), it cannot be determined yet whether this is a result of temporal and/
or social differences (e.g., Thurmond 1985). On the basis of the stylistic motifs
on Ripley Engraved in the Caney Creek locality (see Bruseth and Perttula
1981:Figure 5-7), it is suspected that these ceramic variations in vessel decorations denote different social groups that reflect generally contemporaneous Titus
phase occupations. Based on the one radiocarbon date from the Steck site, it is
estimated that the Goldsmith occupation took place from between A.D. 1400 at
the earliest to about 1550 to 1600 at the latest.

CONCLUSIONS

Late Caddoan Titus phase sites are common in the Wood County part of the
Upper Sabine Basin, primarily in the Dry Creek and Caney Creek drainages and
along Lake Fork Creek between the confluences of these two creeks (Skiles et al.
1980:Figure 6; Thurmond 1985:Figure 6). The settlements are distributed almost
exclusively along tributaries and headwater areas rather than along major streams.
In the Caney Creek drainage, Titus phase sites are known at least as far north as the
Attaway site (41HP15) near Como. Similar Late Caddoan settlement patterns are
apparent in Harrison and Rusk counties on creeks like Hatley Creek in the South
HaUsville Mine Project (LaVardera 1985), Martin Creek (Clark and Ivey 1974), and
Potters Creek directly to the north (Webb et al. 1969). Thurmond (1981:Table 54)
has documented settlement locations for the Titus phase in the Cypress Creek basin
that also emphasized intermediate and minor-sized basins, including headwater
areas adjacent to springs.
There is no apparent settlement hierarchy in the local Titus phase, although
occupations at the Steck and M. W. Burks (41WD52) sites (Perttula et al. n.d.) may
represent large settlements (cf., Thurmond 1981:100). Possible substructural mounds
in the Dry Creek and Lake Fork Creek basins at the J. D. Conger (41WD8) and A.
N. Vickery (41WD11) sites trenched by A. T. Jackson in the early 1930s may date
to this period, but that work yielded little cultural and stratigraphic information. If
these possible substructural mounds are of Late Caddoan age, it is possible that they
represent local civic-ceremonial centers like McKenzie [41WD55] (Granberry
1985) in the Upper Sabine Basin that date before A.D. 1500 (Story 1981:149;
Thurmond 1981:Table 52).
The basic type of Titus phase site in the Three Basins subcluster is a small
settlement of one to several homesteads or farmsteads. These are marked by trash
and household middens that must have been deposited during an occupational
episode of at most 20 to 50 years (see Good 1982). The character, extent, and content
of local Late Caddoan trash middens (Table 10) reflect a basic similarity not only
in the length and type of occupation, but also in the activities relating to refuse
disposal at that time.
The house at the Goldsmith site was probably destroyed by the road construction, since it was probably located between the trash midden and the cemetery. It
is also unfortunate that an accurate estimate of the number of burials in the cemetery
cannot be made since ideally,
the relative duration of the hamlets (settlements) can be measured by the
number of graves in the cemeteries and relative temporal placement of
each hamlet can be determined by sedating mortuary assemblages [S hafer
1981:156].
The ecofactual remains from trash middens would contribute important subsistence information on the Titus phase if a larger, statistically reliable sample could
be obtained (e.g., Grayson 1984; Jones etal. 1983). This could be accomplished

with the excavation of about 20 to 40 percent of the midden (4 to 8 m3) if the faunal
densities from our work at the Goldsmith site are representative.
Subsistence remains with interpretive significance for the Titus phase are still
limited to the Steck site (Perttula et al. 1983), although well-preserved remains are
known at several other sites that have as yet received little professional attention.
Floral evidence suggests that the tropical cultigen maize (Zea mays L.) is a dietary
staple, andbeans (Phaseolus vulgaris) were also an important food source. Nuts and
seeds available in local environmental settings were also gathered, but may have
been of less importance in the Titus phase than they were between about A.D. 1000
and 1400 (Crane 1982; Perttula and Bruseth 1983). Vertebrate species identified
from the Wash midden at the Steck site include deer, turkey, cottontail, jackrabbit,
squirrel, and beaver, as well as several dog burials. Turtle and fish remains were also
present but were relatively uncommon compared to the mammals and birds
(Perttula et al. 1983); deer and turkey were the dominant species at the Steck site.
The Late Caddoan archeological sites in the Dry Creek and Caney Creek
drainages of the Lake Fork basin have been included in the recently defined Cypress
Cluster, which is thought to be
the archeological manifestation of a series of social groups banded
together in a socio-political structure analogous to and at least partially
contemporaneous with thatofthe Hasinai to the south and the Kadohadacho
to the northeast. Four subclusters . . . are believed to represent the
individual component groups comprising this affiliated group [Thurmond
1985:196].
The Three Basins subcluster comprises Titus phase occupations on Caney and
Dry creeks in the Upper Sabine River Basin, and headwater areas of Little Cypress,

184

Texas Archeological Society

Big Cypress, and White Oak creeks. More recently, sites attributable to the Three
Basins subcluster have been identified in the Big Sandy Creek valley (Perttula et al.
1986). The suggested dating of the Cypress Cluster to between A.D. 1600 and 1700
(Thurmond 1985:192) is as yet untested by absolute dating methods. A corrected
date ofA. D. 1470&-_80 from the Steck site may mean that the Three Basins subcluster
developed at an earlier date than is consistent with current chronological frameworks for the Cypress Cluster. Obtaining thermoluminescence and radiocarbon
dates from sites such as Goldsmith or Steck is vital to the acquisition of new
information on the development of the Cypress Cluster and the Titus phase. The
primary units of analysis--the hamlet cemeteries--limit to some extent the precision and reliability of diachronic analyses in the Titus phase. The likelihood or
possibility of frequent shifting of settlements on a generational basis suggests that
a large number of sites would be identified within the four subclusters that are
actually sequent to (rather than contemporaneous with) other known sites.
Synchroneity between and within subclusters is much more difficult to demonstrate
with a series of archeological components in this situation than are intraphase
diachronic changes.
Nevertheless, the definition of the Cypress Cluster, an archeological unit with
specific implications for the recognition of sociopolitical groupings, indicates that
Late Caddoan sites in the Upper Sabine River Basin can be studied within an
analytical framework superseding basic settlement patterning questions. This is
because recognition of the Cypress Cluster is an initial attempt in East Texas
archeology to relate archeological units to regionally meaningful sociocultural
variables that have specific archeological implications (e.g., Thurmond 1985). If
differences between the Dry Creek and Caney Creek localities have more than
temporal significance, that is, if they represent archeological manifestations of
contemporaneous constituent groups (Story and Creel 1982) within the Three Basin
subcluster, sites such as Goldsmith will be important contextual units for investigation in further studies of Late Caddoan prehistory. Their short occupation spans,
their potential for developing close-order and f’me-scale sedations, and the possibility of obtaining economic information at an analytically useful level (the
individual farmstead or homestead), are ideal for investigating intraregional and
interregional settlement, sociopolitical organization, and adaptive variability between about A.D. 1400 and 1700. The individual farmstead or homestead is the most
common type of Late Caddoan settlement in the Upper Sabine Basin, but one that
until recently has received little professional archeological scrutiny. Hypotheses
about the formation, development, and eventual disintegration of Late Caddoan
sociopolitical groupings in East Texas can be evaluated, where appropriate, with the
type of Late Caddoan archeological record known to exist at sites such as Goldsmith
throughout the Dry and Caney Creek localities.
Attempting to model archeological contemporaneity for the Titus phase as a
whole will certainly require a more comprehensive chronological data base than
now exists if sociopolitical interpretations and considerations of adaptation are to
be seriously considered, for as Story (1981:152) has pointed out,

Perttula, Skiles, and Yates ~ Goldsmith Site

185

certainly the Caddoan area is neither environmentally or culturally homogenous. Different processes could have been in operation simultaneously and it must be established, not assumed, that the sequence of
cultural change in one locale applies to another.

We hope our research at the Goldsmith site will contribute to a better understanding
of the Three Basins subcluster of the Titus phase in the Dry Creek basin of East
Texas, and serve to initiate more systematic and long-term research on Late
Caddoan archeology in the Upper Sabine Basin and throughout East Texas.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
We are grateful for the cooperation and assistance of several people during the
work at the Goldsmith site. The owners of the site, the Goldsmith family, permitted
access and shared our concern that the site be protected if possible. We especially
thank Gene Goldsmith, Dr. J. Paul Goldsmith, and H. B. Goldsmith. James E.
Bruseth helped with the access negotiations and facilitated the initial work. He also
provided information about the Steck and Pine Tree Farm site ceramic assemblages
that proved useful in the Goldsmith analysis. Mr. Craig Lacy and Mr. Robert
Turbeville assisted Skiles in gathering information about the site after its initial
exposure, and Ms. Peggy Trachte provided support during the excavations in the
poison-ivy-covered midden. We also thank Mr. Gerald Blow for drafting the maps.
Dr. C. Reid Ferring helped considerably in the editing of the manuscript, and in
improving its structure, but we remain responsible for the content and final form of
the paper.

Archeological Investigations at the Mingo Site,
Bandera County, Texas
Brett A. Houk and Jon C. Lohse

ABSTRACT
In the summer of 1990, members of the Texas Archeological Society
conducted excavations at the Mingo Site (41BN101) in the S abinal Canyon as part
of their summer field school. An initial survey of the site during the previous
summer (Maslyk 1990,1993) indicated the presence of Transitional Archaic to
Late Prehistoric occupations associated with a small bumed rock midden. Excavations confirmed a Late Prehistoric component and provided evidence of an
earlier Transitional Archaic component. The artifacts recovered, including Late
Prehistoric Sabinai, Edwards, and Scallom arrowpoints, as well as Transitional
Archaic Frio and Fairland dart points, supported the preliminary conclusions.

DEDICATION
This paper is dedicated to the memory of Kenneth Mingo (shown below with
Mrs. Mingo in a photograph by the authors). His enthusiasm and daily presence at
the excavations enriched the field school experience of everyone working at the
Mingo site (41BN101). He will be missed.

INTRODUCTION

During the 1989 Summer Field School of The University of Texas at Austin,
Paul Maslyk led a student survey team that recorded and mapped the Mingo site
(41BN101), about 2.5 km (1.5 miles) from the junction of Mill Creek and the
Sabinal River in southern Bandera County. The team made an inventory of the
landowners’ surface collection, which included chipped stone artifacts, several Late
Prehistoric arrowpoints, and Late to Transitional Archaic dart points. Because there
was apparently a Late Prehistoric component associated with the midden, the site,
which is a small burned rock midden, was excavated during the 1990 Texas
Archeological Society Summer Field School.
Under the direction of Dr. Thomas R. Hester, who was assisted by several
graduate students from The University of Texas at Austin, the field school crew
excavated several prehistoric and historic sites, and recorded and mapped other
sites in their general survey of the valley. Excavations at the Mingo site were
directed by the authors, Houk and Lohse; Roy Dickinson, of the Texas Archeological Society, was area supervisor.
ARCHEOLOGICALBACKGROUND
A great many prehistoric sites have been recorded and excavated in the Sabinal
River valley, a large number of which have one or more burned rock middens. For
most of these, including the Mingo site, the typology-based Central Texas chronology established by Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks (1954) provided the temporal framework. This chronology has undergone revisions and additions (Suhm and Jelks
1962; Weir 1976; Prewitt 1981; Turner and Hester 1985), including division into
categories based, in part, on technological changes made by the indigenous
population as they adapted to their environment. These categories are the Paleoindian
period, which lasted roughly from 9200 B.C. to 6000 B.C.; the Archaic period,
which is further divided into Early (6000 B.C.-2500 B.C.), Middle (2500 B.C.1000 B.C.), Late (11300 B.C.-300 B.C.), and Transitional (300 B.C.-A.D. 700)
phases; the Late Prehistoric period, which lasted from A.D. 700 to A.D. 1600; and,
f’mally, the Historic period, which covers the time since European settlement
(Turner and Hester 1985). Prewitt (1974) has called the Transitional Archaic phase
the Terminal Archaic.
Within the past several years, many investigations of burned rock middens
in Central and South Central Texas have been made (see Prewitt 1991), and some
middens excavated in the Sabinal Canyon in Uvalde and Bandera counties have
helped clarify the formational processes of these enigmatic cultural features.
In the 1930s to 1940s, The University of Texas at Austin and the Works
Progress Administration (WPA) jointly excavated sites in the region, many of
which had Late Prehistoric components (files at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory [TARL]). However, they drew few conclusions from this
work, except for Huskey’s classification of middens into types A and B,

Houk & Lohse ~ The Mingo Site

according to size and types of projectile points (Huskey 1935). Type B sites
yield Late Prehistoric arrowpoints ("bird points"), and each generally has only
one burned rock midden (Huskey 1935). In the vicinity of Sabinal Canyon the
Heard Schoolhouse site, 41UV86 (Goode 1991), and the Mingo site fall into
this category. Other burned rock midden sites, such as the Blue Hole site
(41UV159, Mueggenborg 1991), La Jim (Hester 1971; Huebner 1990), the
Kincaid Rockshelter (Collins 1990), and 41BN8, in southern Bandera County
(Patterson 1974) have both Late Prehistoric and substantial Archaic associations,
and some even have Paleoindian components.
The 1989 Summer Field School of The University of Texas at Austin and the
1990 TAS Field School, both under the direction of Thomas R. Hester, did perhaps
the most intensive work on burned rock middens in the area, at the Smith site
(41UV 132), La Jim (41UV21), and at other sites in the canyon (Hester 1990; Houk
and Lohse 1990; Maslyk 1990; Mueggenborg 1990, 1991; Smith and Hageman
1990). Not all the sites excavated were exclusively Late Prehistoric, but the
evidence from those that had Late Prehistoric components can add a great deal to
the understanding of the formation processes of Huskey’s (1935) type B sites
(Goode 1991).
GEOGRAPHICAL SE’IWING
The Mingo site (41BN101)is in southern Bandera County, just east of the
Sabinal River (Figure 1). The site is on an alluvial terrace formed by depositional
action of the Sabinal River and Mill Creek, one of its major tributaries some 200
meters to the south. The Sabinal River valley is in the southern part of the Edwards
Plateau, just north of the Balcones Escarpment (Mear 1953). The erosional action
of the Sabinal River has produced a fertile valley that has cut through the Cretaceous
limestones that cap the Edwards Plateau and into limestones of the Glen Rose
Formation (Bureau of Economic Geology 1982; Mear 1953; Hensell et al. 1977).
In some places, the hills rise some 60 to 90 meters (200 to 300 feet) above the Sabinal
(Mear 1953).
This part of the Edwards Plateau is a well-dissected plateau where narrow
ridges and small mesas--remnants of the original plateau surface--remain
(Hensell et al. 1977). This diverse geographic region supports a wide variety of
flora and fauna. Blair (1950) includes the Sabinal River valley in the Balconian
biotic province, in which Mexican cedar (or juniper), Texas oak, and stunted
live oak trees abound. Other less populous species are interspersed in the generally thick undergrowth of the region, which includes prickly pear cactus, pecan, elm, and mesquite trees, and native grasses such as side-oats grama, hairy
grama, Indian grass, buffalo grass, and several varieties of wild rye (Maslyk
1993; Van Auken et al. 1981). Some of the animals seen near the Mingo site are
white-tailed deer, raccoons, opossums, jackrabbits, and many birds, rodents,
lizards, and snakes.

THE SITE
The surface of most of the Mingo site area (Figure 2) has been heavily disturbed
by the bulldozing of small cedar and oak trees and by the burning of the cleared
underbrush. The extent of subsurface disturbance resulting from these activities was
not precisely determined. Furthermore, the earth from a 10-to-30-cm-deep trench
excavated by a bulldozer before our work began was deposited in a single mound,
some 2 to 3 meters in diameter and 1.5 meters high (Figure 3). As a result of this
clearing, the plants in the immediate vicinity consist of only a few stunted oaks and
junipers, a single black walnut tree, and a carpet of native grasses.
Another probable contribution to disturbance at the site is a shallow seasonal
wash that runs along the west boundary of the site and drains into Mill Creek (Figure
4). According to the landowners, this intermittent gully carries water only every
three to four years, but may have been responsible for surface erosion of the site
since its abandonment.

EXCAVATION METHODOLOGY
Before the start of the TAS Field School in June1990, a crew of students
from The University of Texas at Austin mapped the site, using a transit, and
laid out north-south and east-west base lines for excavation units. The first units
laid out (Figure 5) were intended to determine the extent of the site and the
midden and to identify, if possible, the txansitional zone between its Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric components. All subsequent units were opened in
accordance with this excavation strategy.
A 2-by-2-meter grid was laid out; units were identified by the coordinates
representing the distance of the southeast comer of the unit from the datum point
(N100 W100). Each 2-meter unit was subdivided into quadrants, designated
according to location in the unit, e.g., N100/W100/NW, which allowed the excavators to maintain horizontal control. Further control in the units was assured
by measuring the distance of each significant artifact or feature from the north
and east walls of the unit, thereby establishing coordinates that indicated the
exact horizontal location of the artifact or feature in relation to the datum point.
Members of the TAS ;:Jeld School arrived at the site several days later and
started excavating units in arbitrary 10-cm levels, except for a 1-by-4-meter test

trench to the south, which was excavated according to natural stratigraphy in
order to determine the extent of the burned rock deposit. In order to maintain
vertical control, for each 2-by-2-meter unit a starting elevation was established,
which was tied into the site’s contour map by transit. The elevations of the unit
floors, as well as all significant artifacts and features, were measured from the
starting elevation of each unit. In this way it was possible to compare absolute
vertical proveniences of units regardless of their starting elevations.
All material excavated from the units was passed through a quarter-inch
screen; chert debitage and snails were saved and bagged according to unit and
level. Burned rocks were saved and weighed when work was fmished in the level
where they were found. Formal artifacts such as projectile points, and pieces of
chipped or ground stone that showed signs of use, were cataloged separately
and assigned unique item numbers (see "Artifacts," below).
STRUCTURE OF THE SITE
Excavation and surface inspection have shown that the burned rock midden is
small (Figure 2) and has less burned rock than have larger middens such as the Blue
Hole site (Mueggenborg 1991 ). In N92/W 120/SW the midden reached its maximum

200

thickness of 50 cm, with a burned rock density of nearly 600 kg/m3. A 4-by- 1-meter
trench was extended southward from this unit to determine the southern limits and
thickness of the burned rock deposit. The trench was excavated in natural levels;
Level 1 consisted of humus, Level 2 consisted of burned rock, and Level 3, directly
overlying the bedrock, consisted of brown clay. The midden’s thickness decreased
south of N92/W120/SW to about 30 cm. Two Edwards points and one ScaUom point
were recovered from the burned rock level of the trench; no artifacts were recovered
from Level 3.
The burned rock in units north of the N92 line and west of the W 120 line rested
on bedrock, with no intervening layer of clay. In the bulldozed trench, the burned
rock densities of all except the westernmost units were extremely low (see below).
The matrix in the trench was a hard-packed, sandy loam---directly above the
limestone bedrock--containing cultural material throughout.
In summary, the burned rock midden at the Mingo site is about 15m in dianaeter
and only as much as 50 cm deep. The original northernmost extent of ,’he midden
is unknown because 10 to 30 cm of material was stripped off ~ t~e bulldozed trench.
It is clear from the profiles that the midden did not extend to its north edge of the
trench. Diagnostic arrowpoints were found in the burned rock layer, but no internal
stratification could be seen in the midden.

FEATURES
Two features were noted below the bulldozed trench during the excavations;
no features were found in the midden.
Feature 1: From Level 3 of N98/W120/SE and N96/W120/NE, consisting of
two grinding slabs (Unique Items [UIs] 134 and 135). The largest (UI 135) was
centered in N98/W120/SE, Level 3 and the other (UI 134) lay in Level 3 on the
border between N98/W120/SE and NE (Figure 6). UI 134 is a roughly circular
limestone slab with one smooth face--presumably the result of grinding--and a
pecked circular depression on the other face. Incised lines in this depression are of
unknown origin. A Fairland dart point (UI 132) was directly beneath this grinding
slab.
Feature 2: N96/W122/SW, Level 1. Excavators noted an unusually high
concentration of chert debitage in the first 10 to 20 cm of this unit. Additionally, two
flake cores were recovered in situ, and two others were found on the screen. Eight
of the 13 cores recovered from the site were found in the 2-meter-square unit N96/
W122. The highest debitage count (477 pieces) came from all three levels of N96/
W122/SW and the second highest total debitage weight (1488.9 grams) came from
these levels. The highest debitage weight was recovered from N96/W122/SE.
These totals are somewhat misleading because they did not come from equal
amounts of excavated material. Conversion of debitage counts and weights to
densities for each unit makes a less biased comparison possible. The highest
debitage count density is 2,320 pieces/meted and the highest debitage weight
density is 12,425 g/meter3. Both are from N96/W122/NE. The southwest quadrant of N96/W122, where the feature was recognized during excavations, has
the second highest debitage count density at 1,590 pieces/meter3; the second
highest debitage weight density (5,279 g/meter3) is from the northeast quadrant
of the same 2-meter unit.
In summary, Feature 2 contains a large amount of chert debitage and many
flake cores. The feature probably was a flint-knapping location centered in the
area of N96iW122. Evidence for this is found in the comparatively high densities of chert debitage across the northeast, southeast, and southwest quadrants,
and in the number of cores found in the northwest (three) and the southwest
(five) quadrants of the unit. When debitage count density is correlated with
distance from the activity area, a negative correlation (r=-.65) results, indicating
an inverse relationship between debitage density and distance from the activity
area. Distance from the feature was calculated by measuring from the grid point
N97/W123 to the center of each excavation unit in a 14-meter radius.
MATERIAL REMAINS
The materials described here are chipped and ground stone artifacts (called
Unique Items [UI]), chert debitage, land snails, charcoal, bone, and fossilized
marine shell. As stated earlier, burned rock was not collected for further study, but
was weighed during excavation.

Artifacts
Both chipped stone and ground stone artifacts were recovered at 41BN101.
Based on form and, when understood, function, these categories can be further
subdivided, and each category and its subdivisions is discussed below. All bifacial
UIs have been identified and measured Fable 1).
Chipped Stone Artifacts
All of the chipped stone artifacts from the Mingo site are made of chert. The
quality of the chert is highly variable, ranging from very fine to coarse grained. Each
chipped stone artifact was measured along the following dim ension s (when present):
Length (L); Maximum Width (MW); Maximum Thickness (MT); Stem Length
(SL); Stem Width (SW); and Neck Width (NW); each specimen was also weighed.
All measurements are in millimeters, and all weights are in grams. For each
subcategory or type, the range of variation in each dimension is shown. Numbers
in parentheses directly following a dimension abbreviation (for example, L(3))
indicate the number of specimens used to determine the range. Numbers appear in
parentheses only when one or more specimens were excluded due to incomplete
measurements. Dimensions in parentheses--L:10.00-(20.00)--indicate that an
incomplete measurement from a damaged specimen was used to establish the range.
Bifaces
Chipped stone artifacts that have had flakes removed from both faces are
classified as bifaces. This category is further subdivided into arrowpoints, dart
points, and other bifaces.
Arrowpoints (45 specimens): The largest category of artifacts recovered.
Edwards (6 specimens: UIs 15, 36, 70, 87, 104, and 142; Figure 7, a, b): All
six of these specimens are essentially complete. The lateral edges range from
convex to slightly concave. All six specimens have deeply divided stems,
curving downward on all but U136. The stem ofU136 curves slightly upward.
The stem of UI 1 04 is nearly 2 mm wider than the blade of the point, suggesting
that the point was possibly reworked while still hafted. Two other specimens
(UIs 15 and 70) also show evidence of having been reworked. Although the
Edwards arrowpoints are generally among the largest, the specimens from the
Mingo site are small when compared to the range described by Sollberger
(1967) when he defined the type. The Mingo specimens are closely similar in
size to the Edwards points recovered at La Jita by Hester (1971).
Dimensions: L(3): 21-(31.75); MW: 12.85-(19.65); MT: 2.75-4.40; SL(5):
3.80-7.20; SW(1): 16.75; NW: 5.75-8.75.
Sabinal (2 specimens: UIs 5 and 120; Figure 7, d, e): The Sabinal arrowpoint
was first proposed as a new local type by Hester (1971) at the La Jita site.

Sabinal points have since been recovered at 41BN33, the Rainey site (Henderson
n.d.), a stratified sinkhole 3 km northeast of the Mingo site. The two specimens
from the Mingo site are triangular with concave lateral edges and heavy,
outward-flaring barbs that curve slightly upward. Neither of these specimens
is complete; both are proximal fragments, and one (UI 120) has a broken
shoulder barb. UI 5 has squared-off, bulbous barbs, but the one barb on UI 120
tapers to a point; both have expanding stems. The base ofUI 5 is convex, but
UI 120 has a straight base. The longest specimen (UI 120) is 30.50 mm long.
The specimen (UI 5) with both barbs intact is 21.65 mm wide. The other
dimensions are complete for each specimen.
Dimensions, MT: 2.95-3.20; SL: 5.85--6.20; SW: 6.50--6.90; NW: 5.10-5.60.
Scallorn (15 specimens: UIs 3, 27, 37, 47, 51,58, 69, 71,75, 79, 122, 130, 143,
146,and 166; Figure7,i-k): Eightoftheseareessentially complete specimens.
Seven specimens are proximal fragments. The lateral edges of the essentially
complete points range from slightly concave to slightly convex. The stems are
corner-notched, and most specimens have well-barbed shoulders. Three specimens (UIs 58,143, and 146) have serrated edges. The corner-notched stems are
all expanding. The bases vary from slightly convex to moderately concave (UI
143). UI 146 is only slightly worked on one edge. UI 122 is a crude, widestemmed specimen that may not be complete. One specimen (U147) is burned.
These specimens closely resemble the Scallorn points found at 41BL104 and
described by Sorrow, Shafer, and Ross (1967).
Dimensions, L(5): 22.20-34.90; MW(8): 10.05-18.80; MT: 2.20-4.40; SL:
3.60-(9.16); SW(10): 5.50-17.04; NW: 4.40-10.30. WT(2): 1.1-1.5.
Miscellaneous Arrowpoints (10 specimens: UIs 2, 9, 14, 25, 45, 52, 94,128,
139, and 144; Figure 7, l-p): These specimens have damaged stems, making
it impossible to accurately classify them into any of the above categories. Two
of these arrowpoints show evidence of having been reworked after their stems
were broken. U145 has been side notched above the original shoulders, and 13I
128 has been reworked at its base to form a narrow contracting stem. Two
specimens are serrated (UIs 9 and 94). Additionally, UI 94 has heavy,
outwardly flaring barbs reminiscent of Sabinal points.
Dimensions, L(5): (17.10)-29.90; MW(3): (23.90)-(28.00); MT(7): 2.203.40.
Arrowpoint Fragments (12 specimens): Two medial arrowpoint fragments,
one a partial stem and shoulder fragment (UI 40), were recovered. Ten distal
arrowpoint fragments were also recovered, all with straight to slightly convex
lateral edges.
Arrowpoint Preforms (21 specimens): Most of these specimens are similar
to the small "overall retouch bifaces" described by Lukowski (1987). They are
subdivided according to form.

Triangular (12 specimens: UIs 28, 30, 61, 81, 83, 92, 116, 119, 126, 133, 161,
and 163; Figure 8, a-g): Five of these are substantially complete; seven are
proximal fragments. The bases and lateral edges are straight to slightly convex,
and most---except for UI 119, which has been retouched only along the edges
on one side---have been substantially reworked by pressure flaking on both
surfaces. Three specimens (UIs 28, 30, and 81) closely resemble what others
have called Fresno points (Highley et al. 1978). Turner and Hester (1985:174)
believe that many points previously called Fresno may actually be preforms.

Pointed Ovate (4 specimens: UI s 10, 33, 103, and 152; Figure 8, i-l): These

Miscellaneous Preform Fragments (5 specimens: UIs 22, 39, 129, 160, and
167): These five fragments do not fit into the previously described categories,
so they are described individually:
U122: A medial fragment with only part of its base; one side has only minor
retouch.
UI 39: This distal fragment of poor quality material is also only slightly
worked on one face. Its lateral edges are slightly convex.
UI 129: A slightly rounded, very small, roughly triangular specimen that
may be a reworked arrowpoint fragment.
UI 160: A proximal fragment with a convex base that has been retouched
on one face to form a steep angle.
UI 167: A distal biface fragment, classified as an arrowpoint preform
because of its small size. Its lateral edges are convex and meet to form a
point.
Dart Points (6 specimens)
Angostura (1 specimen: U! 12; Figure 9, f): This, the only Late Paleoindian
point from the site, is a proximal fragment, heavily patinated, with a s~aight
base and well-ground basal edges extending 19 mm up the edges. The point
has been recurved at the distal end, and the tip has been snapped off. The
point was possibly reworked into a drill and then broken (Thomas R. Hester,
personal communication, October 1991),
Dimensions, L: (47.05); MW: 21.25; MT: 6.90; WT: (7.8).
Fairland (1 specimen: UI 132; Figure 9, d): A proximal dart fragment with
large, shallow side notches, a deeply concave base, and slightly convex lateral

Frio (3 specimens: UIs 1, 24, and 86; Figure 9, a, c, e): All of these specimens
have been heavily reworked and have a great deal of variation in their bases.
All are side notched, but U186 has been substantially reworked so the stem is
4.80 mm wider than the blade. The lateral edges of UIs No 1 and 24 are concave,
forming a point on UI 1. UI 24 has been badly heat fractured, and the tip is
missing. The lateral edges of heavily patinated U186 are convex, and the distal
end is rounded.
Dimensions, L: 26.85-(36.70); MW: 11.50-21.30; MT: 4.80-5.95; SL: 5.857.30; SW(2): 14.70-26.10; NW: 11.10-21.30; WT(2): 2.1-3.7.
Unclassified Dart Point (1 specimen: U119; Figure 9, b): The final dart point
is a proximal fragment of an expanding stemmed dart point with a slightly
expanding stem, slightly convex base, weak shoulders, and straight lateral
edges--it does not fit into any previously described categories for the region,
although it is similar to the Darl type (Suhm and Jelks 1962; Wesolowsky et al.
1976).
Dimensions, L: (22.70); MW: 18.10; MT: 5.20; SL: 7.50; SW: 12.70; NW:
11.30.

Other Bifaces (19 specimens)
The remaining bifacial specimens, grouped here according to form, cannot be
classified into previously described artifact or tool types. Where forms are similar
to those used by Lukowski (1987), his names have been used.
Large Orates (1 specimen: UI 16): An ovate biface with convex lateral edges
and base, a section of which is broken off.
Dimensions, L: (45.50); MW: (44.00); MT: 11.90.
Large, Pointed Orates (4 specimens: UIs 34, 56, 59, and 91; Figure 9, g, i).
Three of these specimens are complete, and one (U134) is a proximal fragment.
All four specimens have convex lateral edges and bases; U156 is piano-convex
in cross section, and the other three specimens are biconvex. All four specimens
are relatively crude; U191 has the least retouch, and UI 34 has the most. The
ventral side of UI 59 is only partially retouched, and the dorsal face of UI 91
is almost completely covered by cortex. The first three specimens may be early
stage arrowpoint preforms (Thomas R. Hester, personal communication).
These three complete specimens range in length from 1.58 to 1.77 times their
widths.
Dimensions, L: 52.30-60.90; MW: 29.50-38.65; MT: 11.10-18.00; WT:
12.0-34.3.

Large Triangular (3 specimens: UIs 76, 101, and 136; Figure 9, j, k): All of
these specimens have convex bases. UI 76, which has slightly convex lateral
edges and is patinated, is probably a reworked dart point. Flake scars over the
patination suggest that the piece has been reworked. U1101 has slightly convex

Houk & Lohse m The Mingo Site

215

edges with numerous step and hinge fractures along their margins. UI 136 is a
much smaller specimen, exhibiting only minor retouching on its ventral face
and straight to slightly concave lateral edges. UI 101 may be a dart point
preform; UI 136 may be an early stage arrowpoint preform.
Dimensions, L: 40.00-73.05; MW: 32.55-34.70; MT: 5.75-15.55; WT: 7.529.5.
Miscellaneous Bifaces (3 specimens: UIs 29, 77, and 95; Figure 9, h): These
specimens do not fit into the previously described categories. UI 29 is a
stemmed biface that has been reworked, as evidenced by new flake scars over
patination. It has a contracting stem, a straight base, and convex lateral edges,
and most likely is a reworked dart point. UIs 77 and 95 are both secondary
flakes, retaining cortex on their bifacially retouched ventral faces.
Miscellaneous Biface Fragments (11 specimens): These specimens, which
cannot be placed in any of the previously described categories, are subdivided
into three categories: distal, medial, and unknown. No proximal fragments
were recovered.

Distal Fragments (4 specimens: UIs 97, 98, 148, and 159): All have
convex lateral edges. UI 98 has been burned, and one face of UI 148 is
lightly patinated.
Medial Fragments (5 specimens: UIs 17, 38, 65, 93, and 121): Two (UIs
65 and 121) have been burned, and U193 appears to have been reworked
at the distal end, possibly into a drill, then broken by a snap fracture.
Amorphous Fragments (2 specimens: UIs 53 and 57): These could be
classified as either proximal or distal fragments. U153 is an oval fragment
that was broken by end shock. It is characterized by generally crude
percussion flaking with some fine retouch and microflaking along its
edges, except for the one formed by the fracture. Both UIs 53 and 57 were
apparently broken by end shock, but UI No 57 has no fine retouch along
its edges.

Unifaces.
Five specimens with retouch on only one face were recovered from the Mingo
site.
UtilizedFlake.Blade (1 specimen: U121): A secondary flake that is more than
twice as long as it is wide. The lateral margins, except for several centimeters
that still have cortex, have been modified by use-wear.
Dimensions, L: 44.50; MW: 21.55; MT: 5.95; WT: 6.3.
Serrated Flake (1 specimen: U162): A triangular flake fragment serrated along
one lateral edge.

Dimensions, L: (22.05); MW: (19.65); MT: (8.80); WT: (1.9).

Texas Archeological Society
Utilized and Modified Flakes
The chipped stone assemblage at 41BN101 includes chert flakes that have
either been utilized or have had some sort of minor retouch or modification
along one or more of their lateral (cutting) edges.
Modified Flakes (6 specimens): UIs 7, 18, 48, 74, 102, and 113): For
reasons that are not clear, these specimens have been modified by retouch.
UIs 48, 72, and 113 appear to be fragments of larger unifaces. Since the
edge-wear was not analyzed, there is no basis for classifying them as
scrapers.
Utilized Flakes (24 specimens): Flakes that had use-wear along one or
more margins were classified as Unique Items. This category includes
seven secondary flakes, 15 tertiary flakes, and two flake fragments that
do not have bulbs of percussion or platforms. Three of the flakes--one
secondary and two tertiary--had been burned.

Cores
The 14 cores, made of chert of varying quality, can be classified into two
categories.
Unidirectional Prepared Platforms (2 specimens: UIs 49 and 150): Cores in
this category are described by Lukowski (1987) as having prepared striking
platforms from which flakes are removed in one direction. The platforms are
prepared by removing one or more flakes. U149 has multiple platforms, and UI
150 has a single platform.
Dimensions, ML: 71.05-71.10; MW: 58.45-2.45; MT: 31.05-65.10; WT:
149.4-561.4.
Multidirectional Platforms (12 specimens): These cores have multiple platforms from which flakes been struck in different directions. UIs 4 and 112
appear to be exhausted cores.
Dimensions, ML: 60.65-97.50; MW: 42.15-82.10; MT: 31.05-5.10; WT:
86.2-390.6.
Ground Stone Artifacts
Ground stone artifacts are the second class of artifacts recovered during
excavations at the Mingo site. All are of limestone. The dimensions for the mano
are in millimeters and grams; for the grinding slabs, in centimeters and kilograms.
Mano (1 specimen: UI 20): This artifact is a small limestone cobble, circular in
outline and oval in cross section. One surface is flat and shows evidence of
grinding.
Dimensions (in millimeters and grams), ML: 82.75; MW: 79.55; MT: 37.05; WT:
345.1.

Houk & Lohse m The Mingo Site

217

Grinding Slabs (2 specimens: UIs 134 and 135; Figure 10, a, b): Both were
associated with Feature 1 and are large slabs of limestone. UI 134 is roughly circular.
One surface has been smoothed slightly by grinding; the other has an oval
depression about 13 cm by 10 cm, presumably made by grinding or pecking. Small
linear grooves have been worn into the depression, running perpendicular to its long
axis; how these grooves, or cuts, were made is unknown. UI 135 is a broken
limestone cobble, slightly thicker and heavier than UI 134. Only one side has
evidence of use--a shallow, oval depression made by grinding. This area is about
16 cm by 7 cm.
Dimensions, UI 134 measures 29 by 27.4 cm, is 6.5 cm thick, and weighs 5.9 kg;
UI 135 measures 23 by 22.3 cm, is 7.5 cm thick, and weighs 5 kg.
Other Materials Recovered
Snails
Snail shells were collected from all units, and four species of snail were
recognized. The most common was Rabdotus (1,002 specimens); other species
were Helicina (526), Polygyra (36), and Euglandina (12). All but three of the
Euglandina specimens came from N90/W110/NW, Level 2. The distribution of
Rabdotus and Helicina is discussed below.
Faunal Remains
Only a single piece of burned bone was recovered from 41BN101; it is
tentatively identified as a long bone fragment from a deer, but is too small to be
classified conclusively. This virtual absence of faunal material could be due first,
and most likely, to the soil at the Mingo site, which is not conducive to good
faunal preservation, and second, to an absence of a significant amount of faunal
material at the site when it was occupied.
Fossilized Marine Shell

A single fragment of a fossilized oyster shell (species unidentified) was
recovered; it weighs 12.9 g, was recovered from N98/W120/SW, Level 3, and is
unmodified.
Charcoal
Three samples of charcoal and ashy soil were collected from units in the
bulldozed trench, but none of the samples was clearly associated with any features or artifacts, and no radiocarbon analysis was made. The samples were taken
from: N98/W120/NE, Level 3; N96/W122/NW, Level 3; and N96/W120/NW,
Level 2.

Debitage
The debitage that had been counted and weighed was sorted into flakes and
detritus, and totalled for each unit (Table 2). These categories were further
subdivided.
Chert Debitage
Chert debitage, which consists of flakes (pieces of material removed from a
larger mass of material by the application of force, each with a striking platform and

220

Texas ArcheologicaI Society

a bulb of percussion at the proximal end [Crabtree 1982]) and detritus (pieces of
chert that have neither platforms nor bulbs of percussion), was collected, counted,
and weighed from each unit and level in the buHdezed trench. In all, 4,105 pieces
were recovered during excavations at the Mingo site. A porfiGn of this debitage was
analyzed further.
Flakes
Primary Flakes result from the removal of cortex from a chert core. At least
75 percent of the dorsal surface of a primary flake is covered with cortex.
Secondary Flakes have more than I percent and less than 75 percent of their
dorsal surfaces covered with cortex.
Tertiary Flakes have no cortex on either surface.
Biface Thinning Flakes are flakes removed during the thinning of bifaces, and
are characterized by "lipped" striking platforms; they have been called "lipped
flakes" in other excavation reports (Hester 1971; Wesolowsky et al. 1976).

Detritus
Detritus is made up of chips (small fragments of flakes without bulbs of
percussion or platforms), burned chips (chips that have been heat-fractured or "pot
lidded"), and chunks (large pieces of chert with no bulbs of percussion or platforms).
The debitage from 26 levels, which was analyzed and sorted into the seven
categories (Table 2), totals 2,358 pieces, about 57 percent of all debitage collected.
The ratios between these categories differ little from level to level. When the levels

are translated into elevation ranges and each debitage category is converted to a
percentage of the total debitage for each range, this relationship becomes clear
(Table 3, Figure 11). The data for the deepest elevation range (98.7 to 98.6 cm)
represent a sample of only 117 pieces. The differing ratios reflected in this elevation
range may not be significant because of the small sample size.
The analysis of the debitage from the units in the bulldozed lrench makes it clear
that all stages of lithic reduction were being performed at the site. The low frequency
of biface thinning flakes may be due, in part, to the use of quarter-inch screens,
which do not retain small pieces of debitage.

222

Texas Archeological Society

The small number of primary flakes found in each level may indicate that initial
reduction of chert cobbles may have been done at the site of procurement.
Wesolowsky et al. (1976) reached similar conclusions for the Jetta Court site
(41TV 151) and the La Jim site (41UV21), based on the low frequency of primary
flakes in assemblages from those sites.
A comparison of the frequency of debitage categories between the units in the
vicinity of Feature 2 and the remaining units reveals some interesting differences.
The most notable differences (Figure 12) are the higher percentages of primary,
secondary, and tertiary flakes from units not associated with Feature 2 and the
higher percentage of chips and chunks from units in the vicinity of Feature 2. The
higher proportion of chunks and chips, which, in many cases, may actually be core
fragments, may be related to the distribution of cores across the site. More than 60
percent of the cores recovered from the site were found in the four units of N96/
W122, the area of Feature 2. The large number of cores and the high percentages of
chips and chunks from N96/W122 leads to the hypothesis that secondary stages of
core reduction were performed in the area of Feature 2. The relatively lower
frequencies ofprimary, secondary, and tertiary flakes from the area of Feature 2 may
indicate that after these forms were struck from cores, they were moved to another
part of the site for further reduction or utilization.
Unfortunately, from this region there are no other Transitional Archaic or
Late Prehistoric sites for which a detailed debitage analysis has been done. This
makes intersite comparisons impossible.
DISTRIBUTION OF MATERIALS
The landowners’ bulldozed trench, which cuts through part of the site, makes
the discussion of distribution problematic. Because the top 10 to 30 cm of soil
was stripped off by the bulldozer, it is impossible to make meaningful comparisons of excavation levels in the trench with those outside the trench. Comparing
elevations is also problematic because the midden is concentrated on a slope.
Therefore, for discussions of distribution of materials, it is necessary to divide
the site into the units in the trench and the units outside the trench. Elevation
ranges can be used in discussions of the vertical distribution of artifacts for units
in the trench, but for units in the midden, where the starting surface elevations
varied according to the natural slope of the site, excavation levels rather than
elevation ranges must be compared (Table 4).
Distribution of Artifacts
Arrowpoints
The vertical distribution of arrowpoints in the trench (Figure 13) does not
suggest stratification by type. Edwards points are found in the deepest levels of
the units, but there is a great deal of mixing in the uppermost elevations. Edwards
points occur below, above, and at the same elevation as both Sabinal and Scallorn

points, although they should occur in deeper contexts than either of those point
types (Lukowski 1987). It can be concluded, therefore, that either the deposits
have been mixed, or all three point types were being used simultaneously.
The only identifiable point type found in the deepest levels of units outside
the trench is Scallom ~igure 14); the only Edwards specimen recovered there
was in Level 2, together with one Sabinal and three Scallom specimens.

Figure 15. Plan showing the horizontal distribution of arrowpoints in the trench and in the

In general, arrowpoints were found in units in both the trench and the
midden (Figure 15), although the most notable pattern is the concentration of
preforms in units in the trench. Of the 22 artifacts identified as preforms, 10 (45
percent) were recovered from N96/W122, the area of Feature 2. Twenty (91
percent) of the 22 preforms came from the trench. Not including preforms (Figure 16), 27 (60 percent) of the 45 arrowpoints were in the trench.
Dart Points

Six dart points were recovered (Figure 17). One, a reworked Angostura, is
not included in this discussion because it is clearly an imported artifact, out of
its temporal context. Of the other five points, four came from the highest level
of their excavation units. One Fairland point (UI 132) was found directly below
a grinding slab in Feature 1 and was only 2 cm above bedrock.

Bifaces
No noteworthy patterns are apparent in the vertical distribution ofbifaces in and
outside the trench (Figures 18, 19). Three of the six complete bifaces came from the
vicinity of Feature 2, in N96/W 122 (Figure 19). Another complete biface was found
in the bulldozed trench, and two were in units outside the trench. Ten biface
fragments were collected from units in the trench; seven of these from the vicinity
of Feature 2 (Figure 20). Seven fragments were found in units outside of the trench;
four from N92/W120/SW (Figure 21).
Cores
In the bulldozed trench, the concentration of cores between 98.90 and 98.80
meters elevation corresponds with the elevation of Feature 2. Horizontally (Figure
22), the concentration of cores is in the bulldozed trench; specifically in unit N96/
W122, the area of Feature 2.

Debitage

The highest concentrations of debitage are found in units in the bulldozed
trench. Figure 23 shows the horizontal distribution of debitage by density (number
of pieces/m3) for each unit.
Distribution of Burned Rock

The densest concentration of burned rock occurs in N90/W120/NW (Figure
24), where the average density for all the excavated levels is 724 kg/m3. The lowest
density occurs in N98/W120/SE and is 7 kg/m3.
The relatively high burned rock densities found in N96/W122 are surprising because they occur in the bulldozed trench in the vicinity of Feature 2. They
are two to three times as high as the burned rock densities in other units in the
bulldozed trench.

At the Blue Hole site, 41UV159, Mueggenborg (1991) noted an inverse
relationship between the amount of burned rock and the amount of debitage. A
similar analysis of the Mingo site data does not show any strong correlation between
burned rock density and either debitage count density (r=.024) or debitage weight
density (r=.066).
Distribution of Snails: Rabdotus and Helicina

There is an increase in Rabdotus density in units in the bulldozed trench,
and a similar trend is seen for Helicina snails (Figures 25, 26). However, Helicina
density does not correlate with Rabdotus density (r=.00967), and there is also
no strong correlation between burned rock density and either Rabdotus density
(r=-.097) or Helicina density (r=-.212).

DISCUSSION
Although units in the bulldozed trench accounted for only 33.63 percent of
the site’s excavated volume, they contributed 61.51 percent of the debitage, 64.79
percent of the unique items, and 91 percent of the arrowpoint preforms recovered. Units in the burned rock midden comprised 44.88 percent of the total
excavated volume but only 35.67 percent of the total debitage. The units in the
trench had a total of 152.6 kg of burned rock, but units outside the trench had
804.23 kg of burned rock. Two factors couVd account for these differences: first,
the sample is biased because the top levels in the trench, which may have conmined a significant amount of burned rock, were stripped off by the bulldozer;
second, the units in the trench differ fundamentally in their composition, indicating that different activities led to their formation. This second hypothesis can

be true only if the bulldozed trench corresponds with the northern extent of the
burned rock accumulation. In other words, this hypothesis can be proven only
if because they lie to the north of the midden and not beneath it the units in
the trench do not contain significant amounts of burned rock. It is likely that the
scatter extended over part of the trenched area because it can be seen in the south
profile. It does not, however, show up in the north profile, indicating that the
scatter terminated within the boundaries of the trench. The original extent of the
burned rock can never be fully known. Most units in the trench have little burned
rock, but the westernmost units have burned rock densities comparable to units
in the scatter.
CONCLUSIONS
The limited excavations carried out at the Mingo site by the TAS members
are an important contribution to our understanding of south central Texas pre-

history. At the time of excavation, the site consisted of a small burned rock
midden and an adjoining area containing two identified archeological features.
The site contained predominantly Late Prehistoric arrowpoints and several Transitional Archaic dart points. The exact relationship of the features to the burned
rock midden was not established due to the removal of an unknown amount of
the midden by bulldozer prior to excavation. It is hypothesized based on the
increase in debitage density in units in the bulldozed trench relative to the density in units in the midden, and also on the profiles of the trench walls--that the
midden did not extend completely across the trenched area.
All of the diagnostic arrowpoints recovered are from the Austin phase of
the Late Prehistoric period. No Perdiz points, ceramics, or bison bone were
recovered, suggesting that occupation at the site ceased prior to the Toyah phase.
Occupation at the site possibly began in the Late Archaic or Transitional Archaic, based on the presence of one Fairland and three Frio points among the
several diagnostic dart points.

The presence of diagnostic arrowpoints throughout the burned rock midden
and in each excavated level of the deposits in the bulldozed trench (Figures 13, 14),
suggest that the two areas of the site were formed contemporaneously. A purely
Archaic origin for the midden can not be ruled out without absolute dates, but it
seems unlikely that the formation of the midden began any earlier than the
Transitional Archaic (ca. 300 B.C.), with the greater part of the midden accumulating during the Austin phase (A.D. 700 to 1200) of the Late Prehistoric.
The discovery of two grinding slabs and one mano suggest that the processing
of plant material was an important part of the subsistence strategy of the occupants
of the site. Henderson (n.d.) proposed that the Austin phase inhabitants of the

Rainey Sinkhole also relied heavily on the processing of plant material for their
subsistence.
In form and in artifact assemblage, the Mingo site bears a striking resemblance to the Heard Schoolhouse site (41UV86) as described by Goode (1991).
Like the Mingo site, 41UV86 contained a small burned rock midden, 15 m in
diameter with a maximum depth of 60 cm (Goode 1991:72). More diagnostic
projectile points were recovered at 41UV86 than at the Mingo site, but the assemblages are remarkably similar. Both sites lacked Toyah phase arrowpoints,
and they contained Edwards, Sabinal, and Scallorn points in greater numbers
than they did dart points. At both sites, most of the artifacts were recovered north

of the midden. This may be a coincidence, or it may indicate that the sites are
examples of similar formational processes.
Goode (1991) identified a central hearth at 41UV86, but no such feature was
recognized at the Mingo site. Like the Mingo site, 41UV86 contained very little
faunal material, and Goode (1991) speculates that plant processing may have been
a significant contributing factor to the formation of the midden. The two grinding
slabs recovered at the Mingo site suggest that processing of vegetal matter took
place during part of the site’s occupation.
Unfortunately, the artifacts at 41UV86 and at the Honey Creek site (41 MS32),
which is apparently similar, have not yet been examined in detail (Goode 1991). In
a somewhat cursory examination of the dart points from 41UV86 and 41MS32,
Goode (1991:82) describes "a small side-dart point... [which]... resembles Frio
and Ensor and is the kind of point common in the Late/Transitional Archaic" from
41 MS32, and states that a similar point was recovered at 41UV86. At the B lue Hole

Houk & Lohse ~ The Mingo Site

243

site, Mueggenborg (1991) noted that of his four varieties of Frio~nsor points,
Group 2 was found almost exclusively in excavation levels containing Late
Prehistoric arrowpoints. Interestingly, Henderson (n.d.), although referring to them
as arrowpoints, describes two projectile points from the Rainey site that seem to be
very similar to the points discussed by Goode and to Mueggenborg’s Group 2 Frio/
Ensor points.
The Rainey site, 41BN33, is a sinkhole that was excavated by the Texas
Department of Highways and Transportation in 1978 (Henderson n.d.) and is
only 3 km northwest of the Mingo site. The site was well stratified and carefully
excavated, allowing Henderson (n.d.) to examine the stratigraphic relationships
of Edwards, Perdiz, Sabinal, and Scallom points. Henderson (n.d.:634) divided
the deposits into Lower Austin, Upper Austin, and Toyah phase occupations.
The Lower Austin phase zones contained only Edwards points, except for one
Sabinal point in the latest occupational lens and two expanding-stemmed
arrowpoints in the earliest lens. The Upper Austin phase zones contained Sabinal
and Scallorn points in the earliest lens, Edwards and Scallom in the middle lens,
and Edwards points in the latest lens (Henderson n.d.: 634).
The two expanding-stemmed arrowpoints found in the earliest lens in association
with an Edwards point appear to be similar, at least in outline and size, to the
Transitional Archaic dart points recovered at the Mingo site, particularly to Frio
points UI 1 and 24. Although Henderson (n.d.:514) states that the two points bear
"some resemblance to the Figueroa dart point type," the weak shoulders and
concave base of the outline of the one specimen that was included in a rough draft
of the Rainey site report looks more like a Fairland or Frio point. It is possible that
dart points and arrowpoints were coeval for some time during the Transitional
Archaic and/or early Late Prehistoric periods in Bandera and surrounding counties.
Zone VII at the Rainey site (Henderson n.d.), the Heard Schoolhouse site, the Honey
Creek site (Goode 1991), the Blue Hole site (Mueggenborg 1991), and the Mingo
site are examples of sites where this relationship may have existed. Henderson (n.d.:
630) notes that"it is tempting to suggest that a new phase be defined on the basis
of crude dart-point-like, expanding-stemmed arrowpoints and that this phase
represents the Ixansitional period between the Late Archaic and the Late Prehistoric
Periods." Turner and Hester (1985:49) have recognized the Transitional Archaic,
beginning around 300 B.C. and ending with the advent of the Late Prehistoric in
A.D. 700. This period is marked by primarily Frio, Ensor, and Fairland dart points
in south-central Texas (Turner and Hester 1985). Excavation of small sites like
41BN33 and 41BN101 may make it possible to identify even more discrete periods
of time, such as one in which dart points and arrowpoints were being used
simultaneously.
The Edwards has long been thought to be perhaps the first arrowpoint type
to appear in the Edwards Plateau region of Central Texas (Sollberger 1967;
Hester 1978; Mitchell 1978, 1982); it is clearly the earliest arrowpoint at the
Rainey site, but the stratigraphic order of point types at the Mingo site is not
clear. Two Edwards points were the only identifiable arrowpoints recovered from

244

Texas Archeological Society

the deepest elevations in the bulldozed trench (Figure 13), but Scallorn points
were the only identifiable arrowpoints recovered from the two deepest levels of
the burned rock midden (Figure 14). Edwards, Sabinal, and Scallorn points were
found in Level 2 of the midden and between 98.8 and 98.7 meters in the bulldozed trench.
The Late Prehistoric component at Scorpion Cave (41ME7) in Medina
County included 88 Edwards points and only 16 Scallorn points (Highley
1978:150). Beasley (1978) reported on excavations at a site in northeastern
Bandera County that had a similar ratio of Edwards to ScaUorn points. At the
Rainey site, 11 of the 17 identified points were Edwards, and only four were
Scallorn points (Henderson n.d.). The ratio at the Mingo site is reversed: 15
Scallorn points and only six Edwards points were recovered. The implications
of the differences in these artifact assemblages are unclear, but might be clarified by further investigation of the stratigraphic relations and the geographical
distribution of the various Austin Phase arrowpoints.
Excavations of small sites such as 41BN101 should be an integral part of future
research in Central Texas. They may provide useful analogies for the identification
of activity components at larger sites (Dillehay 1973), and they may have discrete
temporal components. This in turn may allow for the refinement of local and
regional point type chronologies. Small burned rock middens with largely Late
Prehistoric arrowpoints, represented by the Mingo site, sites described by Goode
(1991), and sites excavated in the 1930s by Huskey (1935), may be manifestations
of a distinct cultural innovation that is currently poorly understood.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Experiments in Pictograph Replication
Emery C. Lehnert

ABSTRACT
Several informal experiments were conducted to replicate endangered or
v andalized prehistoric pictographs in the Lower Pecos Region. Various animal fats
and plant oils seem to work well as emulsion binders to facilitate painting on porous
limestone, and some paints also seem to harden the limestone, and thus may have
served to help preserve the pictographs. More research is needed to improve our
understanding of the prehistoric painting process and to learn more about how
these unique pictographs can be properly preserved and replicated.

INTRODUCTION
When the Amistad Dam Project was begun in Val Verde County, Texas, on
the International border between the United States and Mexico, new interest was
sparked in the extensive Indian wall paintings, ranging from Paleoindian to Late
Prehistoric age, in shallow shelters in cliffs and canyons that would be inundated by the lake. Similar sites were also known in the canyons of the Lower
Pecos and Devils rivers and the Rio Grande just above the maximum lake level.
Turpin (1991) has suggested a Middle Archaic age for the Pecos River Art Style,
and believed it flourished in the San Felipe period, between 3000 and 4000 years
ago; she has also demonstrated recently that the Lower Pecos Region extends
further southward into northern Coahuila, Mexico (Figure 1) than had been
previously realized.
The dry climate of this semiarid desert country has been responsible for the
preservation of these enigmatic paintings, even though many of them are on the
walls of open rock shelters. Some of the sites are now lost under the waters of Lake
Amistad, and many others are readily available to boaters, so vandalism has become
quite a problem (Labadie 1989). The natural exfoliation of the shelter walls appears
to have been accelerated by the moisture from the lake; lake water evaporates into
the air and condenses in the many cracks in the limestone walls and ceilings,
detaching small flakes.
REPLICATION EXPERIMENTS
In an effort to preserve a record of these interesting paintings and in order to
learn more about how and with what substances they were painted, I have been
painting miniatures of various prehistoric wall paintings on small limestone slabs
obtained from the strata in which the rock shelters are located. I use pigments dug

from the same or similar sources as those used by the Indians, and have experimen ted
with a variety of substances as emulsion binders.
Emulsion Binders
Among the various substances that were available to these prehistoric people
for the manufacture of paint were: water, oily animal and bird fats, oils obtained

Lehnert m Experiments in Pictograph Replication

from seeds, fish, or reptiles; eggs from wild birds in season, and juices from
plants such as prickly pear (Opuntia var.) or leather stem (Jatropha dioica). There
is sound archeological evidence that these early Indians ate deer, antelope, buffalo, raccoon, beaver, muskrat, goose and ducks (Dibble 1967), and they may
have used the fat from these animals and birds in emulsion binders for their paint
(David S. Dibble, 1983 personal communication).
Beaver (Castor canadensis), a very good source of easily obtainable oily
fat, were abundant (and are still present) along the Rio Grande and the Pecos
and Devils rivers. They were utilized to a great extent by the early Indians, as
is evidenced by the quantity of both beaver, muskrat (Ondatra gibethicus), and
other mammal bones found in the occupation debris in caves such as Arenosa
Shelter (Dibble, 1967 and 1985 personal communication).
The fat of the beaver forms a coat or layer 2 or more inches thick under its
skin, and it is also abundant in the body cavity. Beaver fat, which is very greasy
and oily, is so easily rendered that it is possible to squeeze out large quantities
of oily Liquid from a handful of fat. The fat of the raccoon (Proycon lotor) and
of the muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) is like beaver fat but is not found in such
great quantities. In order to render the most oily fat from the beaver and similar
animals the Indians might have hung the parts of the animal to be rendered in
skin bags on wooden frames or put them in a tightly woven basket in a hole in
the mud along a stream or river. They would have covered the animal parts with
water and cooked them, causing the fats and oils to liquefy and float to the top,
where they would have skimmed them off (Black Hawk, Kooshariam Paiute,
1966 personal communication).
It would have been possible for these people to grind sunflower seeds and
other seeds high in oil content in stone mortars, then to separate out the oil by
heating them in containers such as mussel shells on the coals of a fire.
Fish also contain a fairly high proportion of oil, primarily in their heads and
eggs. The Indians could have gotten quantities of small fish by using wild gourd
vines and green gourds (Cucurbitafoetidissima) in season, or lechuguilla (Agave
lechuguilla), or black walnut hulls (Juglans nigra) as piscicides (there is some
ethnographic evidence of fish poisoning by the Tarahumara Indians of western
Chihuahua, Mexico). The toxic properties of these plants would have killed the
fish so they could be dipped up and cooked whole in the same way beaver fat
was cooked. The boiling process would release the fats in the fish and they would
be skimmed from the surface.
Other sources of emulsion binders could have been fat from turtles and the
intestinal tracts of snakes, both rendered in the same way as the fish; bird eggs
also could have been used in season.
The juices in the leaves of certain plants such as the leaves of the Spanish
dagger (Yucca torreyi) could also have been utilized. Juice is obtained from the
yucca leaves by heating them in hot coals till they soften, then wringing them
out as you would a dishrag. This juice is a clear, rather viscous liquid that takes
colored pigments readily. The leather stem (Jatropha dioica), also known in

252

Texas Archeological Society

Mexico as Sangre de Dragdn, which means blood of the dragon, has sap in its
roots that, although it is clear at first, gradually turns blood red on exposure to
air and sunlight.
However, Indians of that time probably were as much opportunists as we are
today and would have used the easiest obtainable substances, which would have
been the oily fat renderings of the beaver, raccoon, or muskrat.
Tests and Observations
The shelters containing many of the Archaic Indian camp sites in the
Amistad Lake area are in the thick-bedded, quite permeable Cretaceous limestone known as the Buda Formation. Water passes through the limestone quite
easily, and seeps and springs in the caves carry other minerals that coat and stain
the nearby cave ~walls.
While utilizing various paint emulsion binders, it was observed that the
lighter oil- and grease-based paints appear to be carried into the pores of the
rock surface more easily than are egg, plant juice, or heavy "suet" type paints.
The capillary spaces and pores in the rock surface serve as the route for entry
until the pigment fills the pores completely.
Red hematite is abundant in the Lake Amistad area; when ground to a powder and mixed with boiling hot rendered deer suet this mixture, in its liquid form,
makes a good paint.
Vegetable fiber brushes were made from Narrow Leaf Yucca (Yucca
thompsoniana) and Sotol leaves (Dasylirion leiophyllum). Archeological evidence of the use of Sotol leaf brushes has been reported from the Shumla Caves
(Martin 1933). Brushes were made by chewing the ends of the leaves and scraping the soft tissues off of the fibers. It is very necessary to use these types of
brushes with the hot animal fats since these plant fibers are stiffer and do not
shrivel up from contact with the boiling hot fat as animal hair brushes do.
These early people had no ceramics, so they would have had to put the
suetlike mixture in shells of fresh water mussels on coals in the fire, or melt it
by boiling so the color could be mixed into it. When the suet is in its hot melted
state, it takes the pigment well and makes good paint; however, it cools quickly.
Melted deer suet, after being mixed with colored pigments, cooled, and hardened, makes a very serviceable crayon. The Indians could have rolled the cooling suet into a ball or made a lump of it as a type of crayon. The use of black
manganese ore in a similar fashion at the Shumla Caves was also reported by
Martin (1933).
Sunflower seed oil, the next substance tested, carded the pigment well and
produced the kind of edge feathering so evident in many of the pictographs where
the color along the edge of the painted line fades into the rock rather than remaining sharp.
An interesting effect is that this paint also hardens the surface directly underneath it. The oil base evidently carries the pigment into the rock pores until

Lehnert ~ Experiments in Pictograph Replication

the pores are full, apparently making the area beneath the paint more dense than
the unpainted surface. For example, the unpainted limestone is very soft and
was easily scraped with a steel putty knife, but it took a tremendous amount of
pressure to scrape the surface color off the painted sections. When the surface
color had been removed, a "ghost" image remained in the stone, and the area
beneath the ghost was so hard that a steel scraper would not remove it all, and
the slab had to be split again to get down to a greaseless surface. In some prehistoric sites, such ghost images are found on the canyon walls. Possibly they
have resulted from natural weathering, during which windblown dust and sand
removed the colored pigments and left the ghost behind.
The absorption of the oil or grease carrying the pigment into the pores of
the limestone may have helped preserve the pictographs on these cave walls,
especially the ones that are covered with soot, charcoal, or spray paint. Ron W.
Ralph and Kay Sutherland (1973) have outlined the steps taken with commercial cleansers to remove the spray paint, charcoal, and soot, without apparent
harm to the pictographs. However, the hard rock at the Hueco Tanks differs
greatly from the soft limestone of the Lower Pecos area.
Further work should be done here, following Ralph’s and Sutherland’s procedures, to see if the same results can be obtained on pictographs on the Lower
Pecos limestone, but great care should be taken lest the chemicals in the cleaning agents remove the color from the rock pores or damage the pores of the rock
surface. Some work was done along these lines by Silver in 1985 at Panther
Cave, but more should be attempted (Silver 1985).
The ground or near-surface temperatures in the canyons during the summer
are often above 110° F. Such heat, over a period of time, will warm both the
walls inside the rock shelters and those of the cliff outside.
In an attempt to see if this heating contributed to the durability of the pictographs, the slabs of limestone with the paintings on them were placed in a
standard electric oven set at 100°F for 10 to 15 minutes. The heating apparently
sets the paint into the rock, so heating does have some bearing on the durability
of the painted surface. This may explain why colors in pictographs that seem to
be of the same type and age, range from dim to bright. It could be that all other
conditions--weathering, emulsion binders, and abrasion by the elements--were
equal, but that the dim pictographs were painted in the winter when the rock
was cool, so the paint did not soak in so readily as i( did when the rocks were
warnl.

,

Red ocher is the most abundant pigment found in this area; yellow ocher
can be found in some places in thin layers between the thicker layers of limestone, and black manganese ore can be found in the upper Cretaceous gravels
around Shumla Bend on the Pecos River. These are the three colors most used
by the prehistoric people in painting the pictographs.
Michael Zolensky (1982) ran some tests on the pigments taken from pictograph paint in the Seminole Canyon State Park and found that many chemical
elements were common to all of the paint samples tested.

254

Texas Archeological Society

Since the black pigment was found only in certain small areas, I decided to
seek another source for the black color. Charcoal, the most easily obtained black
substance, when mixed with animal fat or egg white, did not produce a lasting
black paint; powdered charcoal tends to clump and does not mix evenly throughout the medium.
CONCLUSION
It is hoped that the information obtained in these informal experiments will
be of use in further understanding prehistoric painting techniques and that some
of the methods and materials used here may be of value in replicating pictographs for museum exhibits. Further experiments to test methods of cleaning,
preserving, and stabilizing replicated rock art panels are needed before any work
is done on the vandalized originals.

The Archeology of Inland Southeast Texas:
A Quantitative Study
Leland IV. Patterson

ABSTRACT
This sunanaary of the archeology of Inland Southeast Texas is based on
computerized data base information from 182 published sites, and provides an
overview of the current status of research on the prehistory of this subregion. Many
of the conclusions are the same as in previous studies, but they are now supported
more fully by quantitative data.

INTRODUCTION

It has been noted (Patterson 1988a) that the published data base for the
archeology of Southeast Texas is now sufficiently large to support detailed studies
and summaries of this region and its subregions. Unless the total published data base
is used, resulting studies will be more impressionistic than rigorous. This is a
quantitative summary of the archeology of Inland Southeast Texas, using a
computerized data base and all of the generally available published literature for
archeological sites in the subregion.
Inland Southeast Texas as defined here covers 21 counties (Figure 1), the same
area used previou sly by the author for sum mary articles (Patterson 1979a, 1983) and
a bibliographic series (Patterson 1986a) for Southeast Texas as a whole. Coastal
margin sites, mainlyRangia shell middens, are not included in this current data base,
but a separate data base for coastal margin sites may be developed in the future.
For the study of geographic distributions of artifact types, Inland Southeast
Texas has been divided into three zones.
Eastern Zone: San Jacinto, Liberty, Chambers, Polk, Hardin, Jefferson,
Jasper, Newton, Orange, and Tyler counties.
Central Zone: Grimes, Walker, Montgomery, Harris, and Galveston counties.
Western Zone: Wharton, Washington, Austin, Fort Bend, Brazoria, and
Waller counties.
The data base for this study covers 182 published sites. A breakdown of sites
by county can be made for 16 of the 21 counties (Table 1), but there are no
publications for Inland type sites in Chambers, Galveston, Jefferson, Newton, and
Orange counties, all of which border the coastal margin. There are 52 published sites
in the Western Zone, 95 in the Central zone, and 35 in the Eastern Zone. The
publications cover 43 excavated sites, 9 sites with data from both excavation and
surface collections, and 130 sites with data only from surface collections.

Figure 1. Map showing the geographic subregions of Inland Southeastern Texas

Every county in this subregion has some recorded sites for which no details
have been published, so there is a need for more publication of recorded sites that
have enough diagnostic data to justify publication; recorded archeological sites are
often identified only by nondiagnostic materials such as chert flakes.
It can be seen (Table 1) that there has been no uniformity in archeological work
in Inland Southeast Texas; the need for uniformity should be considered when
planning future regional research. The pattern of archeological work in this
subregion is a result of somewhat random selection; that pattern reflects where sites
have been discovered, where contract archeology covering construction projects
has been performed, and where members of the Houston Archeological Society
have been able to do work.
The literature on Inland Southeast Texas has grown to a level where it is no
longer possible to rely on memory or on a few published examples for research
conclusions. For many archeological subjects in this geographic area, the entire
body of published literature should be considered quantitatively; this approach
requires tabulation of data. Once the decision has been made to tabulate large

amounts of data, the necessity for use of a computer is obvious. More time is
required to enter data into a computer than would be needed simply to do a
manual tabulation, but the computer data base has the advantage of making it
possible (1) to produce new summaries easily, with revised and additional data,
(2) to make complex queries quickly and easily, and (3) to make final printed
tabulations easily.
Some summary articles have been published on the overall archeology of
Southeast Texas (Patterson 1979a, 1983), but only the coastal margin of this
region has been the subject of a detailed study (Aten 1983). This paper strives
to make a detailed summary of the archeology of Inland Southeast Texas generally available.
The available data indicate that Inland Southeast Texas has been occupied for
about 12,000 years, and detailed archeological data are available for occupation
sequences dating since about 10,000 years ago in this subregion. The entire
prehistory of Inland Southeast Texas is of a hunting and gathering lifeway.
Technological changes occurred within this framework, but a rather stable settlement
pattern seems to have been established.

258

Texas Archeological Society

Data are now available for the study of several topics relating to the archeology of Inland Southeast Texas: chronology, technological change, geographical distribution of artifact types, settlement patterns, and subsistence patterns.
Some investigators tend to favor use of data from excavated sites, but all data
from both excavated sites and surface collections must be considered if studies
are to be complete.
This summary of data synthesizes several subjects for published sites in Inland
Southeast Texas, but the detailed tabulation of data from each site and a corresponding publication list are too large for inclusion here. A separate report with a complete
printout of the detailed data base will be published separately as a report of the
Houston Archeological Society.
METHODOLOGY AND DATA BASE

This study has used all of the generally available published literature on
archeological sites in this subregion. Some contract archeology reports have not
been considered, since they are not always readily available. It would be useful if
detailed absWacts of scientific data from contract archeology work were generally
available (Patterson 1979b), since archeological data that are not generally available are essentially lost data. Even though unpublished site data from the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) files were used for a previous summary of the Southeast Texas region (Patterson 1979a:Table 1), only published data
are included in this study, since unpublished data generally do not contain enough
detail to warrant the effort of tabulation. In any event, a substantial data base has
been developed for this study.
Use of a computerized data base is ideal for this type of investigation; in this
specific case, the Paradox relational data base program has been used with an IBM
50Z computer (a computer with a bard disk is advisable for this type of work). A
relational data base allows linking of tables for complex queries; archeological site
numbers are the link between tables in this specific data base.
The computerized data base used here has 12 tables: basic site data, projectile
points (3 tables), ceramics, radiocarbon dates, lithic tools, general lithics, terrestrial
faunal remains, aquatic faunal remains, miscellaneous artifacts and features, and
mortuary data. Noncomputerized tabulation has been used for some artifact types
with low frequencies.
CHRONOLOGY ANDDEMOGRAPHY

The chronological periods used here are those used in a previous regional
summary (Patterson 1979a). A few radiocarbon dates are available, but, in general,
time periods have been established for each site on the basis of key projectile point
and ceramic types. The small amount of data on the Early Paleoindian period has
been discussed previously (Patterson 1979a, 1983) and will not be considered
further here. This paper is concerned mainly with the details of the archeology of

Pattersonmlnland Southeast Texas

259

about 10,000 years in this subregion, from the start of the Late Paleoindian period
until the start of the Historic Indian period.
The Late Paleoindian period is represented by San Patrice, Early Notched,
Early Stemmed, Angostura, Plainview, Meserve, and Scottsbluff dart points. The
Early Archaic period is represented by Carrollton, Trinity, and Bell points. The
Middle Archaic is represented by Bulverde and Pedernales points, although some
Gary and Kent points are also present. The Late Archaic and Early Ceramic
periods share several projectile point types, including Gary, Kent, Ellis, Ensor,
Yarbrough, Palmillas, and Darl. A few sites have Goose Creek Stamped pottery
from the Early Ceramic period (Aten 1983:Figure 14.1); the Early Ceramic period
in this region is represented by dart points and ceramics but no bifacial arrowpoints (unifacial arrowpoints may be present). The Late Prehistoric period has
ceramics and bifacial arrowpoints, and some Historic Indian sites have glass and
metal artifacts. For many of the published sites, estimates of time periods involved are those of the authors. A summary of projectile points for each time
period already has been published (Patterson 1983:Table 1).
A summary of chronological data shows the time ranges and number of sites
in Inland Southeast Texas for each time period, and a relative population factor is
shown for each time period (Table 2). The relative population factor is the number
of sites in a time period divided by the number of years in a period times 100 (Figure
2). The results for Inland Southeast Texas are similar to those of a previous study
(Patterson 1986b) that used another data set, showing a rapid population increase
in the Late Archaic and Early Ceramic periods and some population decrease in the
Late Prehistoric. A complete explanation of population dynamics in this region has
not yet been developed, but the relative population data given here are more
complete than those in the previous study patterson 1986b) because data are now
available for the Late Paleoindian and Early Archaic periods.

Settlement Patterns

It has been known for some time that most prehistoric sites in Inland Southeast
Texas were along the banks of streams and small lakes, and that the number of sites
with occupation components in multiple time periods evidence stable settlement
patterns in this subregion over long periods of time ~atterson 1983).
For 16 sites in this study, occupation components have been identified for
all time periods from Late Paleoindian to Late Prehistoric. This number increases
to 27 if sites where the Early Archaic period is not f’mnly identified are included.
Only 49 sites (27 percent) of the 182 sites in this study represent only a single
time period, and more than half of the sites (73 percent) have occupation components from two or more time periods. These data indicate that there were stable
settlement patterns with repeated use of sites in this region, in spite of the fact
that prehistoric Indians here were generally nomadic.
Radiocarbon Dates

As noted above, most of the chronological placement of artifact types for Inland
Southeast Texas is based on excavated artifact sequences and the chronology of
artifact types in adjacent regions. Because of the small amount of data available on
absolute dates for this subregion, only broad-range chronological periods have been
considered. The starting dates for pottery and standardized bifacial arrowpoint
types in Inland Southeast Texas are based on radiocarbon dating from sites on the
coastal margin (Aten 1983).

Most radiocarbon dates published for Inland Southeast Texas are from counties
in the Western Zone (Table 3), and these few radiocarbon dates do cover the
complete time range of the Late Paleoindian through the Late Prehistoric periods.
In general, chronological placement of artifact types found in radiocarbon-dated
excavated levels has been consistent with previous estimates of the time periods
involved (Patterson 1983:Table 1). Radiocarbon dates in Table 3 for site 41PK69
were added after other summaries were made, so this site is not included in the
general statistics.

There is an obvious need for more radiocarbon dating in this subregion in
order to refine chronological sequences. This should be an important goal to be
considered in planning regional research. Excavation of more well-stratified sites

262

Texas Archeological Society

is needed for establishment of more detailed chronological sequences, but,
unfortunately, well-stratified sites are not common in this subregion.
Projectile Points
Data for Early Paleoindian Clovis and Folsom projectile point types are not
considered in this paper because only a few specimens have been found in Inland Southeast Texas. A summary of Clovis point data has been published for
the overall region (patterson 1986c), and only one Folsom point has been reported (Patterson et al. 1987). The possibility of notched projectile points starting in the Early Paleoindian period has also been noted previously (Patterson
and Hudgins 1985; Patterson et al. 1987). There is now a significant published
data base for projectile point types in Inland Southeast Texas for all time periods after about 10,000 years ago, and a summary of these data is presented below.
Inland Southeast Texas has been divided into three zones for this study
(Figure 1) because, as previously noted, there are east-west gradients in the
concentrations of some projectile point types (patterson 1983:Table 1, 1988b).
Data summarized here show significant concentration gradients for geographical distributions of projectile point types in all prehistoric time periods. Inland
Southeast Texas is a border area for technological traditions of the southern Great
Plains and the woodlands of the Southeast (Jennings 1974:Figure 1.1).
The geographical distributions of early dart point types in this region (Table
4) shows that the Great Plains Paleoindian tradition is represented by Plainview,
Angostura, Scottsbluff, and Meserve points; there is a definite east-west gradient for concentrations of Plainview and Angostura points. As would be expected,
the highest concentrations of these point types are in the west. The eastern
Paleoindian tradition is represented by San Patrice and Early Notched points;
there is a decrease in frequency of San Patrice points to the west, and the frequency of Early Notched points seems to decrease eastward, a fact that is unexpected for this essentially eastern point type. This paradox may be due to the
fact that the Early Notched point type has only recently been recognized in Inland
Southeast Texas (patterson and Hudgins 1985). Not much data is available for
the distribution of Early Stemmed points, although this point type seems to occur
with a higher frequency to the west in this region.
Webb, Shiner, and Roberts (1971) have shown that San Patrice and Early
Notched points are found at the same site in Louisiana. In Inland Southeast Texas,
35 percent of sites with San Patrice points also have Early Notched points.
In the Early Archaic period, the Bell point of Central Texas is found in the
Western and Central Zones of Inland Southeast Texas. Carrollton and Trinity
points are found most frequently in the Central Zone, and the Wells point has a
fairly uniform geographic distribution in this region.
In the Middle Archaic period, the Pedernales point of Central Texas is also
found in Inland Southeast Texas with a significant east-west concentration gradient. As expected, most Pedernales points are found in the western half of Inland

Southeast Texas. Determination of the dislxibution of Bulverde and Bulverdelike points in the Middle Archaic period poses a problem. As previously noted
(Patterson 1988b), Bulverde-like points in Inland Southeast Texas may have
evolved from classic Bulverde morphology, with Bulverde-like points often
lacking the diagnostic wedge-shaped stem. Since the attributes of Bulverde and
Bulverde-like points overlap, a definite conclusion cannot be made at this time
on the geographic distributions of these similar point types in Inland Southeast
Texas.
Morhiss and Williams points seem to occur during some parts of the Middle
and Late Archaic periods in Inland Southeast Texas. The Williams point has a
fairly uniform distribution throughout this region, but data on the Morhiss point
are insufficient to support any conclusions.

264

Texas Areheological Society

The distributions of later dart point types (Table 5) show that the Late Archaic
period is represented by several dart point types in Inland S outheast Texas. Gary and
Kent points are major types for this period, but do not have much value for
chronological placement, since they were made from the Middle Archaic through
the Late Prehistoric (Hall 1981; Patterson 1983). Later Gary and Kent points tend
to be smaller (Patterson 1980); they are distributed throughout this region, but are
somewhat more numerous in the Eastern and Central Zones. Gary and Kent points
form a series with overlapping attributes. Eighty percent of published sites with
Kent points also have Gary points, and 66 percent of sites with Gary points also have
Kent points.
Several other dart point types tend to be found with Gary and Kent points
in the Late Archaic and Early Ceramic periods, including Ellis, Ensor, Palmillas,
Yarbrough, and Darl types. Seventy-seven percent of sites with Yarbrough points,
74 percent of sites with Palmillas points, 74 percent of sites with Ellis points, 71

percent of sites with Ensor points, and 77 percent of sites with Darl points also
have Gary and Kent points.
In the Late Archaic and Early Ceramic periods, several Central Texas dart
point types that are found in the Western and Central Zones of Inland Southeast
Texas, including Travis, Marcos, and Fairland types, have not been found in the
Eastern Zone. Several Louisiana dart point types from the Late Archaic are found
in Inland Southeast Texas. Evans and Motley points are found only in the Eastern Zone. The Pontchartrain point occurs mainly in the Eastern Zone, but a few
specimens have been found in the Central and Western Zones.
Uniform classification of dart point types has caused this study a few problems, since published reports reflect the judgment of the individual investigators. In a few cases, obvious misclassifications have been corrected. Also, I am
a "lumper" not a "splitter" for projectile point classification. For this study,
Dawson points have been reclassified as Kent, Neches River side-notched as
Ensor, Godley have been reclassified as Yarbrough, and Shumla have been reclassified as Bell. Classification of projectile point types here is generally consistent with previous classification studies (Suhm and Jelks 1962; Turner and
Hester 1985).
Bifacial arrowpoints represent the Late Prehistoric and Historic Indian periods, although unifacial arrowpoints do occur earlier (Patterson 1980). A summary of arrowpoint distributions in Inland Southeast Texas (Table 6) shows that
the chronologies of various arrowpoint types are poorly known. Radiocarbon
dates establish the appearance of bifacial arrowpoints at about A.D. 600 (Aten
1983:306) in this region, but excavations (Patterson 1980) and surface collections (Patterson 1982) show that unifacial arrowpoints do occur significantly
earlier; Cuney and Bulbar Stem arrowpoints have been associated with Historic
Indian sites (Hudgins 1982).
As noted previously (Patterson 1986d), data from excavations show that
Perdiz points, especially numerous in the Central and Eastern Zones (Table 6),
were the dominant arrowpoint type throughout the Late Prehistoric in Inland
Southeast Texas. Other arrowpoint types were used at some time in the Late
Prehistoric in this region. The Scallorn arrowpoint, an early Central Texas
arrowpoint type, was introduced to Inland Southeast Texas sometime after the
Perdiz point. Scallorn points are found in much smaller numbers than the Perdiz
point in Inland Southeast Texas. As expected, the Scallorn point has an eastwest concentration gradient in this region, with the highest concentration to the
west. Fresno, Edwards, Cuney, and Bulbar Stem arrowpoints also have distribution gradients with highest concentrations to the west in this region.
Some arrowpoints have highest frequencies to the east, including Catahoula,
Alba, Bonham, and Bassett. Friley, Colbert, Livermore, Washita, and Maud
arrowpoints have been found only in the Eastern Zone; the Livermore classification in a published report is problematical.
The geographical areas of distribution of distinctive functional artifact types
such as projectilepoint and ceramic types represent areas of influence of technological

traditions not necessarily tied to limited social groups. The outer geographical
boundaries of the distribution of a technological tradition can be influenced by
variables such as cultural preferences, movements of groups, trade, and transfer of
band members. In any event, the distribution gradients for the concentrations of
artifact types in Inland Southeast Texas seem to reflect increasing or decreasing
influences of different technological traditions, sometimes even representing
Southeastern or southern Great Plains influences. Some technological traditions
can have wide geographic distributions--e.g., the Clovis point tradition found
throughout most of the United States or the San Patrice-Hardaway Late Paleoindian
point tradition found throughout the entire southeastern United States (Justice
1987:Map 14).

Ceramics
A summary of distributions of ceramic types in Inland Southeast Texas (Table
7) shows that ceramic types are not too useful for establishing chronological
sequences in this subregion. Aten (1983 Figure 14.1) has published a ceramic type
sequence for the Galveston Bay area that has only limited use for Inland studies; the
ceramic classification used here generally follows Aten’s (1983) typologies.
Goose Creek Plain sandy paste pottery is the dominant type in all zones of
Inland Southeast Texas. This type was probably made throughout the entire time
span of ceramics in this region (see Aten 1983:Figure 14.1). Goose Creek Incised

pottery is not common, at about I percent ofaU Goose Creek pottery, and a few sites
have Conway pottery, which is like Goose Creek except that it has coarse sand. On
at least some sites, there is a question as to whether the coarse sand was intentionally
added as temper or occurred naturally in the clay. A few sherds of Goose Creek
Stamped pottery, which Aten (1983:Figure 14.1) classifies as an Early Ceramic
period type, have been found in the Central Zone.
Rockport Plain (with or without asphalt coating) and Rockport Asphalt
Decorated pottery are found in significant quantities at a few sites in the Western Zone of Inland Southeast Texas. This seems to indicate occasional Inland
occupations by Indians from the adjacent coastal margin. A few asphalt coated
sherds have been classified as Rockport in the Central and Eastern Zones.
Bone-tempered pottery occurs in all zones but is not very common. At one
excavated site in Harris County (patterson 1980), bone tempered pottery seems
to appear in the Early Ceramic period, unlike the Galveston Bay area, where
bone tempered pottery is a Late Prehistoric type (Aten 1983:Figure 14.1).
San Jacinto grog (sherd) tempered pottery is not common at Inland sites in
this region, but it does occur in all zones. Aten classifies San Jacinto pottery as
a Late Prehistoric type on the coastal margin. Presence of this pottery type at a
few Inland sites may indicate occasional occupations of the Inland area by Indians from the coastal margin or, possibly, transfer of women to Inland groups.
San Jacinto Incised pottery is much less common than San Jacinto Plain. A few
sherds were found at sites in Austin, San Jacinto, and Polk counties that had
both grog and bone tempering.
A few sherds of early Tchefuncte and MarksviUe Stamped pottery types of
Louisiana have been found in Inland Southeast Texas. These are a possible indication of technological influences from Louisiana in the early days of potterymaking in Inland Southeast Texas. Marksville Stamped has been found only in
the Eastern Zone adjacent to Louisiana, and the two specimens of Tchefuncte
found in the Central Zone may not be correctly identified, since Tchefuncte is
classified mainly by the contorted consistency of the paste.
A few specimens of Caddo pottery types have been found at sites on the
northern edge of Inland Southeast Texas, mainly in Montgomery, Polk, and San
Jacinto counties, indicating that the northern edge of Inland Southeast Texas was
probably the southern limit of significant Caddo influences in the Late Prehistoric period.
It has been noted previously that Late Prehistoric sites tend to have less
pottery than Early Ceramic sites in Inland Southeast Texas (Patterson 1976,
1980). In this study, 21 sites with only Late Prehistoric components average 16
sherds per site compared to 210 sherds per site at 100 sites that have both Early
Ceramic and Late Prehistoric components. This is another indication that pottery was used less during the Late Prehistoric than during the Early Ceramic
period. The decline in the use of ceramics in the Late Prehistoric might be a
reflection of a more mobile lifestyle (Patterson 1979a, 1983).

Lithic Tools
Formal chipped stone tool types are not numerous on most sites in Inland
Southeast Texas Cable 8); unretouched utilized flakes are the most common tools
in most lithic collections in this region. Only 30 percent of the 182 published sites
in the data base have scrapers, 12 percent have bifacial knives, 25 percent have
gravers, 10 percent have unifacial perforators, and 13 percent have bifacial
perforators (drills). Other formal tool types occur in even lower frequencies.
Inset blades (Table 8) may have been used as compound arrowpoint elements,
much as they were used in the Eurasian Mesolithic (Patterson 1982:19-22).

Combination scraper-gravers and stemmed scrapers tabulated here seem to
be associated with the Late Paleoindian period. Scraper-gravers are common in
Paleoindian lithic assemblages (Irwin and Wormington 1970) and were found
in the Late Paleoindian excavation levels of site 41WH19 in Wharton County
(Patterson et al. 1987). Webb, Shiner, and Roberts (1971) have reported stemmed
side-notched scrapers at a Late Paleoindian site in Louisiana, and a stemmed
side-notched scraper was found in the Late Paleoindian excavation level at Site
41FB42 in Fort Bend County (L. W. Patterson, notes).

Texas Archeological Society
General Lithics

A tabulation of general lithics from sites in Inland Southeast Texas (Table
9) shows that small flakes measure less than 15 mm~ and large flakes are over
15 mmL The main reason for tabulating lithic flakes here is to show that fewer
than half of the reports on sites in this subregion have quantitative data on lithic
flakes, making it clear that the details of lithic manufacturing are poorly reported
for many sites.

Large prismatic blades (more than 15 mm wide) are not numerous and seem
to be associated mainly with early occupation periods. Sixty-one percent of sites
with large blades have Paleoindian components.
As noted previously ~atterson 1973), several sites in this subregion have
industries for the manufacture of small prismatic blades (less than 15 mm wide).
Small prismatic blades can be made fortuitously as well as purposefully, but
many of the sites tabulated here have polyhedral blade cores as well as small
blades, thus demonstrating a purposeful manufacturing process. Small blades
were used to manufacture unifacial perforators, inset blades, unifacial arrowpoints (Patterson 1973, 1982), and sometimes blanks for the manufacture of
bifacial arrowpoints.
The main lithic raw materials in this region are chert cobbles and petrified
wood pieces found in the alluvial deposits in drainage basins of rivers such as

Patterson--Inland Southeast Texas

271

the Brazos; large numbers of chert cobbles and miscellaneous chert cores are
not found on most archeological sites in this subregion. General types of chert
cores were reported in only 19 percent of published sites, and chert cobbles were
reported in only 7 percent of published sites (Table 9). This indicates that primary reduction was commonly done at the source of the raw material, in order
to make the lithic materials easy to transport. Primary reduction at the source
also permitted testing for selection of high quality materials.
Heat treating of lithic materials to be used for the manufacture of dart points
was widespread. Only 24 percent of published sites showed that heat treating
was used, but many site reports did not consider heat treating at all. Heat treating may not have been used as much for petrified wood as it was for chert. The
area with the lowest incidence of heat treating (the Eastern zone) corresponds to
the area of highest use of petrified wood for dart points. Exotic flint from the
Edwards Plateau has been found in small quantities in a few sites.
Small numbers of hammerstones are found throughout this subregion. In
some cases, favorite hammerstones may have been curated by Indians and taken
from site to site. Most hammerstones are of quartzite, but a few are of limestone, which is a good material for use as a soft percussor for bifacial thinning.
Faunal Remains
Faunal preservation is generally poor at sites in Inland Southeast Texas, due
to acidic soil conditions. However, terrestrial faunal remains have been reported
at 44 sites (Table 10) and aquatic faunal remains at 26 sites (Table 11); there are
enough data to provide a fairly good picture of faunal subsistence patterns in
this subregion. As noted previously (Patterson 1983), Indians in the Southeast
Texas region were rather omnivorous, utilizing many types of small and large
animals, probably according to availability on a day-to-day basis. At a few sites
with freshwater shell middens, including site 41FB37 (McClure 1987), preservation of faunal remains has been good. However, preservation of floral remains
in this region is practically nonexistent.
Deer and turtle were the most commonly used faunal food resources; bison was
utilized when available. As Dillehay (1974) has noted, bison was generally
available only during certain times on the Southern Plains. Data from excavated
sites in this region support Dillehay’s statement (Wheat 1953; Patterson et al. 1987).
All data on faunal remains, from the earliest at 10,000 years ago (Patterson et al.
1987) to more recent times (Hall 1981) indicate a broad-based faunal subsistence
pattern over the entire period of prehistoric habitation of Inland Southeast Texas.
The use of freshwater shellfish is neither geographically nor chronologically uniform in this subregion. Apparently, availability of significant quantities of shellfish was limited to certain local areas and to certain time periods.
Along the San Bernard River, the greatest use of shellfish was during the Archaic period, with enough shell at some sites for classification as shell middens.
The oldest radiocarbon date for a shell midden in this area is 6690!-_120 years
BP (Patterson 1988c). Of the 22 sites with reported freshwater shellfish remains,

Among other aquatic faunal resources used were alligator, pond turtle, frog,
and several types of fish. The shark teeth and stingray spines found at Inland sites
are from marine species of the coastal margin that were imported to Inland sites for
nonutilitarian uses.
Miscellaneous Artifacts and Features

Among the miscellaneous items from sites in Inland Southeast Texas (Table
12) are fired clayballs, found at 31 sites; clayballs formed definite hearth features at five sites. Purposely made clayballs generally are rounded and are uniformly fired on all surfaces. These artifacts, which are generally associated with
cooking, are found in sites in Inland Southeast Texas of all prehistoric time
periods (Patterson 1986e).
Hearths were reported at 12 sites in this subregion: five sites had hearth features
made of clayballs, three sites had stone hearths, one site had a hearth made of

clayballs and caliche pieces, and for hearths at three sites little specific information
is available except for the presence of baked soil and traces of charcoal. Hearths
made of clayballs were found in all zones, but hearths made of stone were found only
in the Western Zone, where there are outcrops of sandstone.
Pieces of asphalt, which were found at seven sites, occurring randomly in
all zones, were used to haft projectile points and to coat pottery. Sandstone pieces
that could have been used as abraders were found at 14 sites in all three zones.
At two other sites, sandstone pieces were definitely classified as abraders. In
addition, grooved stone pieces that are sometimes classified as shaft straighteners were reported at six sites. Manos were reported at nine sites, and metates
were reported at nine sites, but manos and metates were not always found together as complete grinding sets.
Ornamental items such as beads, pendants, and incised bone were found
most often at burial sites; five of the ~ven sites with beads were burial sites.
Three sites had bone beads, one site had shell beads, two sites had shell and
bone beads, and one site had shell and stone beads. The stone beads found at
one site (41FB42, L. W. Patterson, notes) were made of exotic materials.
Boatstones made of exotic materials were found at four burial sites, all in the
Western Zone. Incised bone objects were found at five sites in the Western Zone;
four of these sites had burials and the other site had a possible burial. Pendants
were found at seven sites, but shell pendants were found at only four burial

sites----one of these sites also had ground stone pendants (gorgets) made of exotic materials. One pendant was found at each of three sites that did not have
burials, made of chert, sandstone and bone.
Some types of artifacts are rather rare in this subregion. Four atlatl weights
(bannerstones) of exotic ground stone materials were found on three sites. Fishhooks and bone needles were found at one site, bone tools were reported at eight
sites, mad bone projectile points at three sites. The low frequency of functional
bone items is due at least in part to poor preservation.

Most of the available mortuary data is for the Western Zone. Two small burial
groups have been reported in the Central Zone (Harris County) and one small burial
group has been reported in the Eastern Zone (Polk County). A singlepost-ceramic
burial has been reported at a site in the Western Zone (Wharton County). All other
burial data in the Western Zone are for multiple burials.
The only sites containing significant grave goods are in the Western Zone.
These sites are associated with an Archaic period burial tradition as noted by
Hall (1981) and Highley et al. (1988:Figure 1), involving elaborate grave goods,
often made of exotic materials. Hall (1981) has shown that grave goods decrease
significantly in post-ceramic burials. Grave goods from sites in the Archaic burial
tradition of the Western Zone include items such as large corner-tang bifaces,
boatstones, incised bone objects, shell, bone and stone beads, stone and shell
pendants, shark teeth, and stingray spines. The Western Zone burial tradition
implies a higher degree of social organization than is apparent in other zones in

276

Texas Archeological Society

Inland Southeast Texas. The only~other elaborate burial tradition in this region
is a postceramic tradition found on the coastal margin (Aten 1983). It could be
postulated that this higher degree of social organization was supported by its
location in an area of good natural food resources between the Colorado and
Brazos rivers.
EXTERNAL RELATIONSHIPS
Data for prehistoric external relationships of this subregion are of two types:
one type is a broad technological tradition such as projectile point and pottery
types; the other type is of a short-term nature and involves evidence of longrange exchange systems using exotic materials. Broadly distributed technological traditions have been discussed above, especially in relation to the Eastem
Woodlands and Southern Plains technological traditions.
Evidence for long-range exchange of materials within this region is found
mainly as grave goods of the Archaic burial tradition of the Western Zone. Shell
beads, shell pendants, shark teeth, and stingray spines are indications of contacts with the coastal margin. Hall (1981) has discussed the widespread geographic distribution of shell ornaments. The large comer-tang bifaces found in
the Western Zone seem to have come from Central Texas, which is the center
of concentration of this type of artifact (Turner and Hester 1985:210).
There is a possibility that ground stone objects found in the Western Zone
Archaic burial tradition represent part of the widespread Poverty Point Culture
exchange system described by Webb (1982:68). Boatstones, bannerstones, tubular stone beads, and stone gorgets found in the Western Zone are well known
artifact types in the Poverty Point Culture (Webb 1982:Figures 28, 29). The
Poverty Point Culture is well known for both long-range trade and a lapidary
manufacturing industry. It has been noted that the Poverty Point Culture has most
of the dart point types found in Inland Southeast Texas (Patterson 1975). Counter
exchange from Texas with the Poverty Point Culture may have involved lithic
raw materials and finished chipped stone items such as projectile points.
Bone fishhooks found at site 41AU1 in Austin County (Duke 1982:6) are
similar in both form and manufacturing methods to Archaic fishhooks found at
the Horn Shelter No. 2 site in Central Texas ~edder 1985:Figure 8).
Major river systems may have served as cultural exchange routes, promoting contacts between regions. Inland Southeast Texas has several major rivers
that run from the north or northwest: the Colorado, Brazos, San Jacinto, Trinity,
Neches, and Sabine rivers. The Colorado and Brazos river systems seem to have
been important as routes for contacts between Southeast and Central Texas, but
there are few artifact types that could show contacts between Northeast and
Inland Southeast Texas in the same manner that projectile point and flint types
show contacts between Central and Inland Southeast Texas. This is probably
because the technological traditions of Northeast and Inland Southeast Texas
are fairly similar, except for the Caddo Culture.

DISCUSSION
This summary of a data base for Inland Southeast Texas presents a good
general picture of the current status of research in this subregion. For example,
more details are now available on geographic distributions of artifact types to
represent technological traditions. Enough data are now available to support
research on several topics concerning the archeology of this subregion that have
not yet been addressed in detail. As mentioned above, the complete current data
base will be published, and it will be revised as new data become available.
In general, previous conclusions made in summaries of the Southeastern
Texas region (Patterson 1979a, 1983) are supported by the more detailed information now available in this data base. For example, previous conclusions on
population dynamics and the decline of pottery use in the Late Prehistoric still
seem to be valid. Some aspects of the prehistory of this subregion, such as faunal subsistence and general settlement patterns, are now fairly well outlined,
although the nature of seasonal patterns remains poorly understood. More detailed chronologies need to be developed here for artifact types, in order to make
it possible to address several other research problems in more detail.
The amount of data available on the archeology of Inland Southeast Texas
is especially impressive when it is noted that most of these data have been developed in only the last 20 years, and at a minimum expenditure of public funds;
few of the publications for sites in this data base are dated before 1970.
Regardless of any regional research planning that is done, professional work
in this subregion will probably continue under the vagaries of contract work
carried out in connection with construction projects. This means that the types
of sites and geographic areas will not be closely coordinated with any regional
research plan. It is hoped that more contract work will be done in the future on
well-stratified sites. The development of more detailed chronological sequences
and more geographically uniform data should be major goals in future regional
research planning. The role of avocational archeologists will continue to be
important in this region, especially for research involving sites on private land
(Patterson 1988d:380). Well over half of the publications for Inland Southeast
Texas sites have been written by avocational archeologists.
SUMMARY
This paper has presented a quantitative summary of a data base for published archeological sites of Inland Southeast Texas. It is hoped that this summary and the detailed data base, which will be published separately, will be useful
for research in this region and for the orientation of Inland Southeast Texas in
the general prehistory of Texas. Since this data base will be revised as new data
become available, there should be no time limitation on its value. Because of
the large amounts of data available, a tabulated data base has become an essential tool for regional research planning, execution, and synthesis.

A Flexed Burial From Llano County, Texas

Leland C. Bement

ABSTRACT
A semiflexed burial was salvaged from a roadcut at site 41LL356 near Sandy
Creek in Llano County, Texas, during the spring of 1987. Two superimposed
hearths lay above the burial. A dart point associated with the skeleton places it in
the Late Archaic period, but a radiocarbon date (1200-260 BP ) from charcoal in a
hearth directly above the burial indicates the Late Prehistoric period. There is a
stratigraphically consistent relationship between the burial, which contains an
Ensor dart point of the Twin Sisters phase (1750-1400 years BP) and the lower
hearth dated to the Austin Phase (1250-650 BP). The second hearth, 60 cm above
the dated feature, probably belongs to a later Austin Phase occupation tentatively
dated to about 770 BP based on the deposition rate of0.18 cm per year calculated
from the radiocarbon-dated hearth..

SITE SETTING
Site 41LL356 is a terrace site along the right (south) bank of Sandy Creek
in Llano County, Texas (Figure 1). No cultural materials are exposed on the
terrace surface to indicate the presence of the site, but a road cut into the terrace
at a ford of the creek exposed the deeply buried cultural remains, consisting of
rock concentrations and a single burial.
The burial was discovered by an avocational archeologist who noticed the
top of a skull eroding from the roadcut. Upon notification of the find, the landowner became concerned that the skeleton might be vandalized and requested
that professional archeologists remove the burial. The site was subsequently
designated 41LL356 by the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL)
of The University of Texas at Austin.
SALVAGE RECOVERY AND RESULTS
Excavations were performed by Dr. Solveig A. Turpin and Leland C. Bement,
of TARL, and Mark Denton, of the Texas Antiquities Committee on April 16,1987.
The salvage recovery of this burial revealed hearth construction and burial practices
attributable to Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric inhabitants along Sandy Creek.
Methods and Techniques
Excavation began with the placement ofa 1.5x 1.5-meter shovel-dug unit over
the exposed cranial vault. Every eighth shovel load was screened through quarter-

inch hardware cloth, except in levels where cultural materials and features were
uncovered. In these levels all shovel loads were screened.
Cultural Stratigraphy
Initial recovery of materials intrusive to the fine grained, sandy silt alluvial
deposits was at a depth of 1.1 meters below the surface, where fist-sized cobbles of
gneiss were uncovered (Figure 2). A light scatter of chert flakes was uncovered from
1.2 to 1.4 meters below the surface. Also at 1.4 meters was Hearth 1, consisting of
three burned cobbles and charcoal-mixed sand that defined a circular pit 50 cm in
diameter and 10 cm deep (Figure 2). There was insufficient charcoal for a
radiocarbon date.
At 1.8 meters below surface, the tops of large rocks were hit, and subsequent
cleaning exposed Hearth 2, an arc of stones that bisected the excavation unit into east
and west halves. Forty large stones (the largest 25 cm x 30 cm x 15 cm) were stacked
two high and three wide. Charcoal lumps and fire-hardened clay defined a 15 cm
deep pit on the west side of the stone alignment. Burned and unburned chert flakes
were common both in and out of the feature. Charcoal sufficient for five radiocarbon
dates was collected; however, only one sample was run, rendering an uncorrected
age of 1200-L-_60 years BP (Tx-5756) (S. Valastro, personal communication). This
date, when calibrated using the Stuiver and Reimer (1986) calibration, provides a
one standard deviation (sigma) range from 1256 to 1013 years BP, assigning this
occupation to the Neo-Archaic Austin phase as defined by Prewitt (1981:75) in
Central Texas. The arc of stones comprising this feature continues into both north

and south walls of the unit and reemerges in the cut bank, giving the feature a
diameter of more than 2 meters. The exact configuration could not be determined
due to the damage to the hearth caused by road construction.
The burial lay at 2.2 meters below the surface (Figure 2), and the skeleton was
totally exposed (Figure 3).
Based on the known depth of Hearth 2 and the radiocarbon age, a rate of
deposition for this terrace was calculated. Using the calibrated radiocarbon date

mean of 1134 BP and a depth below the surface of 2.0 meters, the rate of deposition
is 0.18 meters per year. This rate of terrace deposition provides a means of
estimating the age of the other cultural levels. When this calculation is applied to the
Hearth 1 level, an estimated age of 780 years is obtained. Such age estimates are only
tentative, since not only does each flood deposit a different amount of alluvium, but
also the individual flood episodes could notbe differentiated in the fine grained silts
of this terrace.
Skeletal Data
The burial is that of a 35-45-year-old male, 168 cm (5 feet 6 inches) tall.
The skeleton was semiflexed, lying on the right side. The skull faced south,
although the long axis of the burial is more SE to NW. The left arm lay across
the side with the hand on the abdomen; the right arm parallelled the torso, and
the hand curled along the thigh. Most of the bones were highly fractured, and
only the skull, which rested on a gneiss slab, and the right humerus could be
removed intact. This was accomplished by applying spray foam, which hardened to form a supportive case around the bones (Figure 4) (Bement 1985:371).
Noted pathological conditions include two pea-sized depressions in the left
parietal and occipital area of the skull, probably the result of infectious lesions. The
teeth of this individual are evenly worn, except for the first maxillary molar on each
side ~igure 4). Here, wear has reduced the occlusal surface to the roots, splitting

each molar into two separate but apparently viable toothlets. The incidence of caries
is low, and no teeth have been lost.
Ensor Dart Point
An Ensor dart point was uncovered along the dorsal side of the spine opposite
the lower thoracic vertebrae (Figure 3). This dart point was made from a large flake
of tan chert, the ventral surface of which is apparent on one face. The blade of the
point has been reworked, giving it an asymmetrical outline (Figure 5). Sharpening
of the tip has drawn the edge toward one surface and has enhanced the curve of the

entire specimen. Shoulders are square to sloping, the stem is formed by broad sidenotches, and the base is extremely thinned. This specimen is aligned with the Ensor
type because of the broad side-notching. The point is 5.3 cm long, 2.6 cm wide, and
0.7 cm thick.

DISCUSSION

The skeletal material was in a state of poor preservation, since all but the
small, compact bones of the hands and feet were fractured in situ. Postburial
deformity is amply demonstrated in the skull/where vertical pressures compressed the facial region through fracturing and slippage of the eye orbits, bridge
of the nose, and maxilla midline.
In addition to disturbances related to overburden pressures, the left rib cage
and humerus were dislodged--the humerus was totally removed, either by rodent action or as a consequence of the construction of Hearth 2. Although the
burned soil and charcoal lens in Hearth 2 mark the floor of the pit above the
skeletal material, it is likely that during initial scooping in construction of the
pit, the rib cage was disturbed without being recognized as part of a human
skeleton. Thus, the hearth was constructed and fired.
This burial is significant because it adds to the sparse data we have on Late
Archaic mortuary practices in the Llano County area. No exploratory tests were
performed to determine if the site contains other graves. This burial follows the
general trend in Central Texas during the Late Archaic period of isolated flexed
interments (Prewitt 1981:81). The cause of death of this individual could not be
determined, but it is possible that the dart point was embedded in the body at
the time of death and came to rest where it was unearthed as a result of later
disturbance from construction of the Late Prehistoric hearth.

The Foreshaft Socket Drill
Roy E. Padgett

ABSTRACT
A broad group of Archaic and Late Prehistoric lithic a_~facts are commonly
categorized as drills. Some of these can be distinguished as a separate class that
probably functioned as socket drills used to drill out atlatl and arrow foreshaft
sockets. There is very little discussion in the literature as to why these types of drills
were crafted or how they were used. An attempt is made here to define this class
of artifact and to put these drills in their proper perspective. Also included is a
discussion of the use and advantage of the foreshaft.

INTRODUCTION

All of the shafted weapons used by prehistoric Indians--the spear, lance,
aflafl dart, arrow, and harpoon--could have had foreshafts. In most of the discussion that follows, the aflatl is used as the prime example, but the conclusions
apply as well to other foreshafted implements.
Such foreshafts are not limited to any time bracket in the contiguous United
States, since they can date from the time of Early Man until the last arrow flew
in the Indian wars. Also, the foreshaft has no geographic limitation, since its use
ranged from coast to coast at a time when there were no Mexican or Canadian
borders. Flint artifacts that I suggest are socket drills used to prepare foreshaft
sockets have been recovered from sites dating to the Paleoindian (Blaine et al.
1968), Archaic (Forrester 1964), Neo-American (Richards 1971), Late Prehistoric (Wyckoff 1973), and Historic (Schneider 1969) periods. The first documented historic contact of Europeans with Indians using foreshafted atlatls in
the United States was in the Cabeza de Vaca saga in 1528. The last recorded
account of atlatl use by Indians was from the DeSoto expedition in 1541. It seems
that the bow and arrow had completely replaced the atlatl by the time the first
European colonist arrived (Krieger 1956).
THE FORESHAFT

Almost everyone in this field of study concedes that many of the shafted
weapons were fitted with foreshafts, that on wooden shafts the foreshafts were
tapered down nearly to points on the proximal ends (Figure 1, A), and that the
main shafts had cone-shaped sockets drilled into their distal ends to accept that
pointed foreshaft (Figure 2, A, B).

Note that this system would work just as well if it were reversed by drilling the
socket in the proximal end of the foreshaft, but the problem here is that the foreshafts
were considered expendable whereas there was hope that the main shafts would be
reusable. Socketed foreshafts would involve drilling each one produced.
The main shaft, at this juncture, would be tightly wrapped with fresh sinew,
which, on drying, would shrink and harden, becoming nearly as strong as a metal
ferrule. This would prevent splitting, either while drilling or upon later impact.

The foreshaft could be easily whittled or scraped to proper taper by trial and
error and made to fit the socket as snugly as desired (Figure 1, A). Of prime
importance to this arrangement Js the fact that the main shaft of an atlatl dart
was much more valuable to the user than the throwing stick, the foreshaft, or
the projectile point.
If you would test this, try to find a perfectly straight sapling or tree limb
without flaws that could be made into a first-rate main shaft. Or better yet, cut

292

Texas Archeological Society

down a tree with stone tools and from that log split out a section that could be
dressed down into a good shaft.
Conifers grow straight and tall, but in the sapling stage they have many small
branches that fall away, leaving knots in the mature trees. Other trees tend to
grow gnarly or bushy, and limbs are seldom straight for the 1.5 to 2.5 meters (5
to 8 feet) needed for a good atlatl shaft. In areas where good wood material was
scarce or absent, cane shafts were used.
The assumption that most atlatl darts did not use foreshafts would most likely
be true in areas where choices in shaft material were easily available. And not
all dart shafts were necessarily retched. A shaft that has a center of gravity twothirds to three-fourths of the way down from the proximal end will fly nearly as
true as if it were retched (Evans 1959).
The development and use of the foreshaft was prompted by the following
needs and reasons.
1. Main shafts were highly valued some were so prized that they were even
decorated (Schuetz 1960).
2. The advantages of the fall-away foreshaft.
3. Interchangeability of points from large to small or even to the bunt (Barnett
1973).
4. Easy replacement of a damaged foreshaft.
5. Hafting of points to hollow cane main shafts (Schuetz 1960).
The foreshafts of wooden main shafts without a fall-away foreshaft could
be cemented into the socket for a more or less hard, firm joint or later loosened
by soaking or by using a little force. The cement could be the same as that used
to haft the dart point or other hafted tools.
Mentioned in many reports are mastic materials such as tar, pitch, asphaltum,
gum, resin, or even blood. It would not be surprising to find that the Indians had
developed the procedure for reducing the hooves of ungulates to a glue that would
equal the best that Stradivarius used on his violins.
Cane main shafts present an entirely different approach. Hafting a stone point
to the hollow part of cane almost required the use of a foreshaft. Two principal
methods were devised: one was to cut the cane off square, leaving 40 to 50 mm
(1.5 to 2 inches) of the hollow part beyond the last segment. This hollow cylinder was tightly wrapped with sinew or fiber to prevent splitting, and the proximal end of the foreshaft was carved into a round dowel that would fit snugly
inside the hollow cane tube. A shoulder could have been left on the foreshaft,
which would fit hard against the end of the cane and would transmit the force
of impact to the main shaft. This assembly, called the mortise and tenon method
(Schuetz 1960), could be cemented to a firm connection.
The other approach is the Plug method. Here, each end of the cane main shaft
would have been filled with a tightly fitted and glued-in wooden plug. Both ends
would be tightly reinforced externally with sinew or fiber to prevent splitting. The

Padgett m The Foreshaft Socket Drill

293

proximal end would be notched or hollowed to fit the hook of the atlatl. The distal
end could be drilled to a cone-shaped socket to fit the proximal end of a tapered,
glued-in or fall-away foreshaft (Schuetz 1960).
A great many site reports have been published in which the authors made
noble efforts to describe or classify flint artifacts that are roughly grouped as
drills. I stand on the shoulders of giants who have dug deeper and come up wiser,
and, dodging Controversy, I abstain here from naming references as I list some
of the good and some not so good descriptions of perforators.
The distal end is properly called the bit. It has been termed the stem, pointed
end, shaft, blade, or shank. Cross sections of bits have been called oval, diamond, elliptical, beveled, propeller, or nothing at all. The proximal end is properly called the base, and here the wildest forms and shapes can be found and so
too can a great many good descriptions. Base ends have been described as square,
rounded, worked, unworked, eared, notched, T-shaped, reworked projectile point
base, flake, etc. Some have tried to group a few of those that are nearly alike
into types: Type I, Type II, Type III, etc.
We need all of those good descriptions, but we should not blindly put form
over function. If we are to study the artifacts of prehistoric Indians, it is to try
to learn the how and why of this lifestyle, otherwise, we miss the main objective
of archeology and may as well stack up a pile of stream-washed gravel. The
blanket term perforator should supersede the term drill in all descriptions unless the artifact has a defined use as in socket drill, bead drill, pipe drill, fire
drill, etc., or other if unknown (R. E. Forrester, in press).
The perforators I describe as socket drills are, in general, like the wooden
thumb-turn pegs that are used on violins to adjust the tuning (Figure 3, A-F).
With eager permission, Mr. Robert E. Forrester has extended me the privilege
of quoting a full page and a table from a soon-to-be published final report, "Horn

FLINT PERFORATORS
Drill is a word used to describe a flint tool apparently made to drill
holes in wood, soft stone, horn, antler, pottery and similar materials. The
term embraces too many forms and styles and some of those tools
commonly named"drills" were undoubtedly used as awls in leatherworking
and for yet other purposes.
Since it is usually impossible to demonstrate the precise use to which
any specific tool was put, it may be better to use the term perforator, which
covers any tool intended to make a hole.
To rule out perforators made of bone, often called "bone needles" one
should specify the type of material from which they are made. This is
normally flint, again often a misnomer,

Figure 3. Atlatl foreshaft socket drills, A-C; Arrow foreshaft socket drills, D-F.

There are four basic forms of flint perforators. One form is made from
original intent as a perforator and has no stem or tang. Its shape when well
finished is similar to a wooden violin-peg. On occasion it consists only of
a slender bit on an unfinished flake. When made onto an existing blade, it
is difficult to determine if that was the case or if it was made onto a flake
which was then carefully dressed down all around the base. The bit may
be either slender or short and stubby.
The second form is made onto an existing projectile point. This may
be either an arrow point or a dart point. Here too the bit may be either

Padgett ~ The Foreshaft Socket Drill

295

slender or short and stubby. No evidence suggest a stem or tang for a handle
was necessary.
In each of those two forms, there is a size distinction. The small size
was unknown in the atlatl era. With the advent of the bow and arrow the
small size became almost the only form present. This has connotations
which cannot be ignored! It is believed that the larger, slender form was
made ~ifically to drill out the wooden socket in an atlatl shaft to receive
a tapered foreshaft and that the smaller slender form was used similarly in
the smaller arrow shaft. This idea was propounded by bar. Roy Padgett
(1967), with whom the author is in full agreement.
The third form, noted here as"acicular," is a slender tool with no basal
expansion, having the form of a bit from a large violin-peg perforator. It
is doubtful that the acicular form was used as a drill.
The fourth form is a strongly beveled, double- or single-pointed tool.
The double-pointed variety is similar to, and in some cases may actually
be, the Harahey "knife." The single-pointed variety appears as one-half of
a Harahey knife and this variety has no name. Neither variety was
recovered here.

Examination of the summaries above reinforce the theory that the
slender forms of both the projectile-based and the violin-peg shaped flint
perforators, in both the large and small sizes, were used as drills to form
the sockets of atlatl dart shafts and arrow shafts. One specimen, B 15-62,
was a tiny violin-peg shaped drill and was clearly out of context in Level
16. Another specimen, B 12-17, was a large violin-peg shaped drill in Level
23 (an arrow point level). All the others were in their expected positions.
It is easier to explain the dart socket drill in the arrow point level than the
arrow socket drill in the dart point level JR. E. Forrester, in press].
The above commentary and tables by Forrester put firm credibility to the use
of socket drills in the Paleoindian period and to the use and shift to the arrow shaft
size right through time to the Late Prehistoric period.
The base of a socket drill could be any size or shape as long as it was wider than
the bit, to provide mechanical leverage for turning the bit into the work. The base
could be a thumb-and-finger grip twist or it could be hafted for whole hand use.
Often, the base is no more than the remainder of the flake from which the drill
was made, and may indicate an anticipated one-time use only. Again, the base may
be carefully bifacially chipped and have smoothed sharp edges. The bases of a good
percentage of socket drills are the bases of reworked projectile points (Figure 3, A;
Table 1). These could have been hafted or they could have been complete foreshafts
hafted with their stone points before being reworked into drills. The flintknapper
here may have needed the flint in the point for a drill bit more than he needed the
point. Where it is possible to identify such a socket drill base as a named projectile
point type, we need to consider whether the type was contemporaneous with the
culture in which it was found. It could be a point that was picked up somewhere,
whose chronology predates by hundreds or even thousands of years the culture in
which it was made into a drill. We need this further insight to the man behind the
tool (Suhm et al. 1954).
The configuration of the base was actually of small consequence to the function
of the tool. When the Indian put his hands to a piece of flint to make a drill for a socket

Padgett ~ The Foreshaft Socket Drill

297

in a shaft, he would not have been concerned much about a pattern for the base. His
concern, instead, would have been directed to the optimum size and shape of the bit
for its expected performance.
On examination of the drills, it is apparent that the size of the bit is a very good
indication of the size of the shaft to be drilled. As bow and arrow weaponry came
onto the scene, the socket drills suddenly dropped down in size to accommodate the
smaller arrow Shafts ~igure 3, D-F). Although the atlatl and spear certainly carried
over into the Historic period, the small arrow shaft drills did not appear until the
introduction of the bow and arrow ~able 1). The drill bit was precisely engineered,
and meticulously designed and worked. A typical aOatl drill bit might be 38 mm (1.5
inch) long, 14 mm (7/16 inch) wide near the base, tapering to 8 mm (5/16 inch) near
the lower end and then tapering sharply to the point. The degree of taper was critical,
for if the angle was too great, the shaft could fall away too easily. Conversely,
without enough taper, the foreshaft could seize in the socket and not fall away at all.
The degree of taper can vary slightly from one drill to the next, but a general average
on several that were measured comes to about 4° ~igure 3, A-C).
The bit, while maintaining its taper, has edges that are sharp and straight, or
very slightly convex. The flaking is very fine with minimal serration on the sharp
edges.
Fundamental to the design is the thickness in the center of its cross section,
which is needed for strength but should never equal the width of the cutting edges.
This gives the edges what is known in machining terms as tool relief to do the
cutting. This has led to descriptive terms in published reports such as oval, ridged,
diamond, etc. Drills reported with steep beveling on opposite sides have what is
called a propeller-shaped cross section; the beveling gives a better angle to the
cutting edges. This beveling can also indicate left or right twist action.
None of the hafted weapons of stone age man had the explosive effect of
expanding bullets as provided by the modern day rifle, and whether used on game
or on enemies, his weapons depended solely on penetrating, cutting, and internal
bleeding for their lethal effects.
Even the modern day bow-hunter using a 32 kg (70 pound) pull compound
bow and a razor-sharp, three-bladed, broad-head arrowpoint knows he must
depend on internal bleeding to effect a kill. After making a perfect chest cavity
hit on a deer, he knows he will need to track his quarry from 45 meters (50
yards) to perhaps 100 to 300 meters (110 to 330 yards) or more. I have referred
above to a fall-away foreshaft, and more needs to be said about its advantages.
Consider now, a primitive hunter using an atlatl dart without a foreshaft. Let’s
say he makes a perfect chest cavity hit on a deer. As the animal struggles in
panic and crashes away through brush or cover, the shaft is quite likely to be
broken off. Or, say his shot was less than perfect, and the animal is wounded,
but not fatally, as the projectile has penetrated a nonvital area. Again, the shaft
is apt to be broken or carried away for some distance. In the event that the hunter
had a clean miss, the projectile could have struck a tree or rock, shattering the
point and splitting the shaft on the impact.

298

Texas Areheological Society

Now consider the same scene with the hunter using a dart with a foreshaft with
the perfect or even the imperfect shot. The first few sideways strains on the socket
connection loosen it, and the main shaft falls free. If a tree or rock is hit, the
shattering of the point and/or the splitting of the foreshaft might absorb the impact
and the main shaft might be left undamaged.
If the main shaft should fall away, the hunter could retrieve it quickly and,
from a pouch or belt, select another pointed foreshaft--one of several he might
carry--and reload. This situation would give the hunter the advantages of a
repeating rifle as compared with those of a muzzleloader; this hunter would not
be disarmed by just one shot.
Any woodworker can tell you that the most difficult hole to bore into wood
is one straight into the end of the grain. The wood auger bit will not work at all,
and a drill bit for metal tends to "walk" off center. I have been involved in tool
design engineering and have had many years of experience with hand tools for
wood- and metal-working. I find nothing in this Indian’s tool kit of bone, horn,
wood, and stone with which he could have bored out such sockets except for the
classic flint socket drill.
It is certain that these drills could be and were used to drill other materials
such as bone, horn, and teeth. Also, there were drills of other sizes and designs.
Still, I ask readers to think in terms of the socket drill when you look at a drill,
before you relegate it to some other purpose.
My grade-school history books recorded that Eli Whitney was the first to
produce interchangeable parts for cotton gins and guns. This concept of socket
drills and fall-away foreshafts that could be quickly replaced could push back
the role of interchangeable parts as many as 10,000 years with the weapons of
the American Indian.

CONCLUSIONS
Many of the shafted weapons were crafted with detachable foreshafts. Sockets
for these shafts were made with very carefully designed and shaped flint drills, made
specifically for this purpose.

Getting to the Point: Some Comments on Cox and
Smith’s Perdiz Point Damage Analysis
John E. Dockall, William A. Dickens, and Harry J. Shafer

ABSTRACT
A recent study by Cox and Smith (1991) used unprovenienced Perdiz
arrowpoints in an experimental study of breakage patterns. The use of prehistoric
points in this study is ethically wrong and detracts greatly from the intrinsic value
of their study. The experimental frameworkof the study was inadequate to provide
support for the problems presented and didnot address other areas of breakage such
as manufacture and taphonomic processes. An experimental program involving
the replication and use of Perdiz points would have avoided the use of prehistoric
specimens and would have provided crucial data regarding breakage patterns
resulting from both manufacture and use. A functional analysis of stone tools must
incorporate data from manufacture, use, retouch, discard, and natural processes in
order to eliminate potential sources of bias from the study.

Cox and Smith (1991) most recently provided us with an initially interesting
article on the possible behavioral significance of fracture patterns of Perdiz points
from 41 SP135, the McGloin House site. The aim of the article is admirable in some
respects, and their emphasis on the importance of fracture patterns in assessing lithic
assemblage variability is well taken.
We, as archeologists and lithic technologists, are very disappointed in the
article, since it represents the unethical usage of archeological material in destructive experiments. Obviously, some archeological material must be used in some
destructive processes, such as for dating and trace element analysis for raw material
sourcing, but in each of these uses the return in information is sufficient to justify
the loss, and in these cases information on context and provenience of the destroyed
pieces is recorded. Even though the artifacts used in Cox and Smith’s experiments
were unprovenienced, they did have some potential research value and should not
have been destroyed. The kinds of information that can be collected from such
artifacts, for instance those in private collections, are
1. Technological information regarding production methods.
2. Raw material variation within types.
3. Geographic variation within formal types.
Schiffer (1987:117-118) indicates that private collections are an important
archeological research tool. These collections can provide insights into the occupational history of little-known regions and can indicate areas for further research. The

effects of collections on the archeology of a region also can be observed. Legitimate
study of these collections will also allow archeologists to begin to reassess
generalizations about collecting and pothunting processes and their effects on the
archeological record.
With some minor effort or forethought on their part, Cox and Smith could
have avoided the use of unprovenienced specimens. First, Perdiz points (both
bifacial and unifacial varieties) can be relatively easily replicated by anyone with
a knowledge of flintknapping. Second, if the authors lack the ability to knap
flint, they could have contacted any of a fair number of practicing flintknappers
in the state. Texas is fortunate to have this resource, and more attention should
be given to the contributions that practicing flintknappers have made to archeology and experimental archeology as a whole in Texas (consider the efforts of
J. B Sollberger). Several flintknappers in Texas would enjoy an opportunity to
participate in avocational and professional research projects; their knowledge
and experience are excellent resources that have been neglected. Third, the application of an experimental program that involved the manufacture of Perdiz
arrowpoints would have yielded significant behavioral data regarding breakage
in addition to that associated with use as projectiles or cutting tools.
Aside from the ethical considerations, Cox and Smith (1991) failed to provide satisfactory answers to major questions they attempted to address, and they
did not fully explore their alternate hypotheses before they reached their conclusions. We will refute their article, point by point.
First, there are problems with their experimental program. Statements made by
Cox and Smith (1991) regarding behavioral inferences based upon their experiments were extremely biased and misguided by the fact that use wear already
present on many of the Perdiz points they used was not accounted for prior to the
experiments. The fast experiment involved the use ofa45-1b compound bow to fire
18 arrows into arecently killed white-tailed deer carcass (Cox and Smith 1991:287).
A white-tailed deer was chosen because of its abundance at the archeological sites
with which the experimental data were compared. Cox and Smith apparently
operated under an unstated assumption that all arrowpoints (whole and fragmentary) found at the archeological sites in question were used for hunting deer, and that
the hunters never missed. Archeological interpretation cannot occur within the
framework of a "Pompeii Premise," where the archeological record is assumed to
represent an unbiased record of the pasL They have not considered other possible
reasons for fracture damage at these sites, such as trampling, geomorphic processes,
manufacturing failures, misses that were shot into the soil or against other hard
objects (rocks or trees), or thermal fracture. Many experimental programs have been
conducted that could have served as models for this experiment (e.g. Flenniken and
Raymond 1986; Odell 1977).
The second experiment involved the butchery and skinning of a white-tailed
deer (presumably the same one used in the first experiment) with five hafted Perdiz
points (Cox and Smith 1991:287). Presumably, this experiment was designed to
examine the possibility that some Perdiz points could have been used as hafted

Dockall, Dickens, and Shafer m Geeing to the Point

303

cutting and butchering implements, and the authors entertain the notion from their
wear analysesthat some projectile points were in fact tools and not projectiles. Cox
and Smith provide no discussion of their use-wear analytical methodology, nor do
they describe patterns of edge-wear that are interpreted as evidence of butchering
and skinning. There is neither discussion nor data concerning other activities that
may have led to the development of the wear patterns observed. Edge-wear was
automatically assumed to be from the use of arrowpoints as tools rather than as
projectiles, and an array of other potential sources of wear such as firing into the
ground (misses), quiver wear, haft wear, and impact wear were not considered in the
experimental design. Quiver wear would affect the lateral edges of the barbs, where
most of the wear was observed, and would even cause some damage leading to
broken barbs, tips, and stems. Arrowpoint stems and points with broken tips were
found together with complete points bunched together as if they had been in quivers
at the George C. Davis site (Shafer 1973:206). Haft wear could cause edge and
surface smoothing along the stem and upper part of the blade. Attrition caused by
impact misses that did not break the point would appear as lateral edge wear.
Manufacturing techniques such as platform or edge preparation during pressure
flaking could also cause lateral edge wear. Cox and Smith naively inferred that
lateral edge wear was equivalent in all respects to wear associated with cutting. This
may have been true for some of the points, but the inferences would have been
stronger had alternative explanations been discounted. Again, a well-developed
experimental program could have addressed most (if not all) of these factors.
During the third experiment (Cox and Smith 1991:287), three Perdiz points
were repeatedly fired from a 15-1b compound bow into a stack of ten deer hides
affixed to a plywood backing. The light bow was used to prevent the point from
penetrating all ten hides and striking the plywood backing. This experiment was
supposedly designed to test both accrual of wear and type of wear on points
from their use as hafted projectiles.
This experiment is flawed in several aspects. First, the experiment is biased
by the measures taken to insure that points did not break prematurely in the wood
or stacked hides. Second, the repeated firing of only three points brings into
question the statistical validity of statements based on breakage and wear patterns observed on these specimens. Third, the purpose of stacking deer hides
and affixing them to a plywood backing is unclear. In essence, the experiment
apparently was designed to simulate the developmental stages of wear and attrition of Perdiz points used in hunting. Little useful information can be gleaned
from the discussion of the results of this effort (which are limited to a mere short
paragraph in the report). Aspects of developmental wear and attrition would have
been better addressed in the first experiment.
Cox and Smith (1991:294) make a blanket statement that all of the dull,
broad artifacts that morphologically resemble Perdiz points could not possibly
be Perdiz points. This statement was based on their test firing of various Perdiz
points into a deer carcass. They essentially conclude that a short stubby point
would not have been effective in hunting. The point they refer to (Cox and Smith

304

Texas Archeological Society

1991:288, Figure 2e) looks like a point that has been extensively resharpened,
but their claim that this point could not have been used to hunt is unfounded,
due to a lack of sufficient experimental data.
Cox and Smith (1991:293) stated that "snaps are not caused by impact," citing
Ahler and McMillan (1976:167). But since this statement is much too simplistic,
and many other factors are involved, it appears that they may have misinterpreted
Ahler and McMillan’s work. The fact is that Ahler and McMillan stated that
projectile points at Rodgers Shelter exhibited a "relatively high frequency of
impact-fractured and complete specimens and relatively few specimens with
transverse blade fractures" (Ahler and McMillan 1976:167). Specimens with snap
or bending fractures at Rodgers Shelter were interpreted within a more sophisticated
analytical framework than the one used by Cox and Smith. Breakage at Rodgers
Shelter was conclusively shown to be associated with observed wear patterns, and
dart points were the focus of analysis at Rodgers Shelter whereas Perdiz arrowpoints
were examined by Cox and Smith. Large hafted bifaces are more amenable than
smaller arrowpoints to a wide range of functional variability.
Experimental data contradict the statements of Cox and Smith (1991:293)
regarding the origin of snap fractures on projectile points. Cox and Smith indicate that the damage that accrued to their Perdiz point assemblage was in the
form of impact fractures restricted to the distal region. Flenniken (1985:270)
conducted experiments on live goats with dart points, and found that several of
the points had snap fractures as a result of movement of the animal. Flenniken
(1985:270) was careful to note that breakage was not due to missed throws and
that movement of the animal during the killing process transferred several fragments to places far from the point of entry. Such movement would produce
bending forces transverse to the blade, stem, and barbs that Cox and Smith (1991)
could have interpreted as breakage from use as a tool. Flenniken (1985:273) noted
that 72.7 percent of the fracture damage on experimental points (that had been
manufactured for the experiment) were of the bending variety and occurred near
the haft area.
Cox and Smith (1991:297) also noted that some Perdiz points with minor
impact damage had been later reused as cutting tools. The citation of Ahler and
McMiUan (1976) is again felt to be out of place here because their work dealt
with larger dart points and hafted bifaces, which, due to their larger size, have
a greater potential for a more diverse functional role.
As a result of their use of Perdiz points in butchering and skinning experiments, Cox and Smith (1991:295) stated that what were formerly believed to be
Perdiz points from 41SP135 were merely hafted cutting tools that had been
discarded. We ask why individuals would manufacture small hafted bifaces
exclusively for butchery when available flakes might be more handy. The longitudinal wear noted on the Perdiz points at 41SP135 and other sites by Cox and
Smith may actually have originated from the many reasons already mentioned.
Another reason for wear along the edges of these points could be grinding of the
edges during manufacture. This grinding would have been done to prepare the

Dockall, Dickens, and Sharer ~ Getting to the Point

305

edge for pressure flaking. It could just as easily be from another step in the
manufacturing process that Cox and Smith did not control for. These same
arguments were echoed by Sheets (1973) and Keeley (1974) in response to the
claims by Nance (1971) that "Stockton" points exhibited longitudinal striations
indicative of use for purposes other than as projectile points.
The lesson to remember is that although Perdiz points may indeed have been
used on occasion for cutting, most were probably used as projectile points, and
analysis should attempt to address these possibilities. Development of experimental programs that are designed to yield data to be used in cultural/behavioral
reconstructions should be exhaustive. The formation processes that can influence the archeological record, both natural and cultural, should be considered
an integral part of the experimental framework, and use-wear studies should also
be accompanied by concurrent experimental manufacture studies, for manufacture experiments can be very useful when fracture pattern studies are included.
¯ Finally, no archeological material should be destroyed in experimental programs
such as these when there are other more useful alternatives.

Missing the Point: A Reply to DockaH,
Dickens and Shafer
Kim A. Cox

ABSTRACT
Dockall, Dickens, and Shafer offer criticism of Herman Smith’s and my 1991
article on the study of impact damage to Perdiz points. They raise issues on
methodology and ethics. I disagree that the methodology was flawed or that there
was a breach of ethics in the use of real Perdiz points in destructive experiments.

INTRODUC~ON
In their evaluation of Herman Smith’s and my 1991 paper, Dockall, Dickens,
and Shafer (see article, elswhere in this volume) pursue two major areas of
methodology and ethics. Their comments in both of these areas demonstrate a lack
of understanding of the experiments and conclusions, as well as philosophical
differences on ethical issues.
METHODOLOGY

The two principal conclusions of our paper were that (a) the mere appearance
of lithic tools resembling Perdiz points does not necessarily mean that their final use
was as tips for arrows, and (b) the study of snap versus impact damage has use in
the understanding of site function as well as other general applications (which were
enumerated in the article). Dockall, Dickens, and Shafer raise the criticism that our
evaluation of the reasons for the appearance of snaps and edgewear was not
complete and that, therefore, the results were somehow invalid.
First, in regard to snaps, the focus of our analysis was on the presence of impact
damage, not on the presence of snaps. In fact, we actually acknowledged that "there
are other easy explanations for snaps on projectile points" (Cox and Smith
1991:293). B ut the presence of snaps was not the relevant issue; the important point
being made was that "[a]ll projectile point types must evidence impact fractures"
(Cox and Smith 1991:293).
As an example of the application of this analysis, we concluded that the Fresno
"point" that is quite widespread in this area may not be a projectile point type
because it does not have anywhere near as many impact fractures as are seen on local
Perdiz and Starr arrowpoints. In fact, in the three years since this article was written,
these Fresno points have become a persistent source of consternation. We would
like them to be projectile points, but the" lack of any impact damage on them is

extremely bothersome. In any event, the problem poses questions that would not
have been raised without this type of damage analysis.
Second, in regard to edgewear, there is no question but that most if not all of
the Perdiz points from the sites studied were originally intended to be used as
arrowpoints. However, the analysis of edge attrition tends to indicate that the last
use of some of the points before they were lost or discarded was not as projectile
points. The fact that there was significant edge attrition on the whole points, but
much less aUrition on the ones with major impact damage, is enough to suggest such
an idea.
If, as argued by Dockall, Dickens, and Sharer, any number of other factors
could have been responsible for the edge attrition (such as dulling in the manufacturing process), why is there a disparity between the whole points and the ones with
impact fractures? And why are there so many dull, poorly shaped arrowpoints?
I suggest that anyone who believes that these are arrowpoints try to survive by
using them as such. It is inconceivable to think that skilled bow hunters would even
entertain such a notion.
Our experiment was not intended to be a detailed use-wear study, nor was an
exhaustive experimental program required for our conclusions; it was simply a
matter of perception and common sense. We were simply trying to convey in the
article the fact that one cannot necessarily infer site function or intensity of use from
the mere presence or number of projectile points.
ETHICS
Over the past five years, I have measured and recorded edge attrition and
damage patterns on several thousand Perdiz points from public and private collections. In the course of doing this, I have had donated to me several Perdiz points for
which there was no provenience; it was not known even whether they were found
locally. We used some of these points in our experiments because they fit within the
range of shapes and edge wear of the Perdiz points from 41SP135. Dockall,
Dickens, and Shafer raise an ethical issue concerning the use of genuine points in
destructive experiments.
We considered using replicated points instead of actual ones, but we saw the
failure of the people who used them to salvage these points as the real question. I
did not know at the time that shape and edge wear significantly affect the
performance of a point, and I believed that the credibility of the experiment
depended on the use of points that had been discarded, and not on ones that had been
recently manufactured. After all, we were trying to answer the question of what was
wrong with the discarded points.
The points that were actually used could not have contributed to the three
categories of potential information listed by DockaU, Dickens, and Shafer. However, the use of genuine points provided critical information to the experiments,
which were the moral equivalent of using impact tests to study the hardness of
pottery. To some extent, the authors must be allowed their discretion in the choice

Cox ~ Missing the Point: A Reply

309

of artifacts to be used in destructive experiments without summoning the ethical
police. Even on the offensiveness scale, our breach was minor. To raise it as an issue,
I believe, is to overemphasize artifacts as things rather than as potential sources of
knowledge, an issue recently broached by Stephen Black (1992) in an address to the
Texas Archeological Society.
Essentially, archeology is a process for the acquisition of information leading
to the elucidation of the human condition through time. There is much merit in
preserving what remains of our heritage, but this is simply one facet of the whole
scenario. It seems to me that the Texas archeological hierarchy has misplaced its
emphasis in this matter with its anachronistic fixation on things over ideas, a fixation
used to justify the mandatory expenditure of huge amounts of both public and
private money for negligible results.
It is outrageous that archeologists with new ideas and new approaches have to
operate on a shoestnng while monstrous sums of money are spent for embarrassingly little new information, a fact recently acknowledged by Michael B. Collins,
when he said we should "think long and hard before we dig another burned rock
midden" (Collins 1991:1). What a novel idea!
This is all by way of politely saying that, although ethics will always be a
legitimate concern, academicians themselves leave too much room for improvement to be pronouncing judgment on others.

Some Thoughts on Texas Historical Archeology
John W. Clark, Jr.

ABSTRACT
There has been a general lack of interest in historical archeology by many
prehistoric archeologists in this important period in our history. The author points
out several specific areas of concern and offers some suggestions for techniques
and approaches that are important in the study of historic sites and records.
Historical archeology has the potential to help us make significant improvements
in our understanding of Texas history and anthropology.

INTRODUCTION
The study of historical archeology has been pursued in Texas on a regular basis
since the late 1950s, focusing first on historic Indian camp sites, then moving on to
the excavation of mainly Anglo-American sites associated with important historical
figures. During most of the early years of historical archeology in Texas I was a
student and participated in a few excavations, including some volunteer work
during the first investigation at Independence Hall at Washington-on-the-Brazos,
serving as a crew member of the excavation of the Anson Jones kitchen site, and also
visiting several sites. However, at that time I was more interested in prehistoric sites
and had opportunities to work on many excellent sites in Texas and other states. It
was not until the early 1970s when I was placed in charge of the excavation and
publication of three structure foundations at Fort Lancaster that I began to appreciate the possibilities of historical archeology. Since that time, I have continued to see
more possibilities as I worked on a variety of historic sites.
HISTORICAL ARCHEOLOGY IN TEXAS
During the 1960s the subdiscipline of historical archeology in the United States
began to develop with the founding of the Society for Historical Archaeology. The
first volume of HistoricalArchaeology contained articles dealing with questions of
the place of historical archeology in relation to history and anthropology. The early
issues were concerned with this question and with the typology and dating of certain
artifact types. During the 1970s and 1980s the focus shifted to more theoretical and
anthropological approaches. During thatperiod, the emphasis on particular artifacts
as the subject of study in and of themselves was greatly reduced, and more emphasis
was placed on interpretation through sets of analytical models that could be
quantified and tested. Several of these models have proven their worth in sites all
over the country, and they serve as excellent bases for comparing sites.

However, much of the historical archeology in Texas remains like that of
the 1960s, with little emphasis on the anthropological and historical questions
that can be discussed profitably in the analysis of historic sites. This is meant
not as a criticism of any specific individuals, but rather to suggest that there are
more creative analytical techniques and more powerful models in use in other
parts of the country than are commonly in use here. A part of the problem is that
much of the work has been done by archeologists who were much more interested in prehistoric than historic sites and who did historical archeology unwillingly as part of salvage or Cultural Resource Management (CRM) work. Some
who have had a continuing interest in aspects of Texas historical archeology
seem to have been kept so busy with CRM projects that they have had little time
or inclination to use updated analytical methods. I call attention here to some of
the research questions and models I consider important and suggest some of the
ways by which they can be implemented. This requires that I state my predilections with regard to the analysis and interpretation of these sites and discuss
some of the opportunities and limitations offered by various kinds of sites. It
also requires a discussion of the characteristics that make a site significant. These
are weighty subjects that have been discussed and continue to be discussed by
archeologists throughout the nation.
Historical archeological sites usually are sites that date from the entrance of
Europeans or descendants of Europeans into an area to the present. They are
usually characterized by two things; artifacts of Euro-American manufacture and
some kind of documentation relating to the site or its inhabitants. In some cases,
modem descendants of the inhabitants of the site make it possible for archeologists to relate the site to the modem world. Also, the artifacts, or at least a large
percentage of them, are much more likely to be identifiable as to function and
date than those at prehistoric sites. This frees historical archeologists to concentrate more time and effort on the interpretation of the data, from excavated,
archival, or oral sources.
Questions to be Answered
What, then, are some of the questions that can be addressed in the analysis
of the material gathered by extensive research on these sites? One of the important questions deals with the establishment of functional distribution patterns
that make it possible to create quantified descriptions of component artifact
assemblages. This technique, developed by Stanley South (1977) in the early
1970s in South Carolina, has proven successful in his research and that of others working on colonial period sites, and has been used with some success in
other areas and for other time periods. The categories of artifact function must
be expanded considerably to accommodate the enormous number of artifact
categories found in late nineteenth and early twentieth century sites. The technique is not perfect, and its limitations have been discussed in the literature, but
it is useful for the definition of patterns, and it provides quantifiable bases for

Clark ~ Texas Historical Archeology

313

comparing sites. This technique could be very useful in Texas once it has been
used on several sites. It is important now to develop an archive of sites that have
had this kind of analysis so larger patterns can be derived.
A second question is horizontal patterning. The spatial distribution of artifacts can indicate culturally significant patterns of refuse disposal and activity
areas as has been shown in the mid-to-late 1970s and in the 1980s on several
sites here in Texas. This technique can be effective when there has been sufficient sampling of the site area. One method used to show artifact frequency is
to combine all artifact categories and plot raw numbers on a map of the excavation units of the site, and an alternative method often used is to indicate intensity by different degrees of shading, and still another version of this technique
is to use a series of site maps to show the distribution of artifact function categories as defined by South. These approaches are valuable, but the latter may
enable archeologists to define special activity areas that might not be readily
discernible in the former.
In some respects, these questions can be related to still another question-ethnicity. To understand the cultural dynamics represented in the artifacts and
the structural features of a site it is important to determine ethnic affiliation of
the occupants of the site. This can sometimes be done by interviewing descendants of inhabitants or their neighbors or by archival research, or it can sometimes be determined by the presence of certain ethnically specific artifacts such
as, for example, sherds of Loza Corriente ceramics or perhaps glass or ceramic
sherds embossed with non-English lettering. If it is possible to determine the
ethnicity of the inhabitants of a site, the previously mentioned pattern definition
techniques may make it possible to assign or describe ethnically related patterns
quantifiably; that is, ethnically identifiable refuse disposal patterns and function/frequency patterns may be discernible when these techniques are used.

Economic Patterns
Still utilizing artifacts excavated from a site, it may be quite possible to
outline aspects of the market system of the inhabitants. Several exchange systems are available to occupants of most sites. The most remote of these markets
is the international import market reflected in inventories of foreign makers’
marks or product marks that might be found on ceramics or liquor bottles.
Another market system available to the inhabitants might be the national market, some examples of which might be artifacts--bottles, ceramics, and bricks-with marks from manufacturers in other areas of the country. Items made in other
parts of the state indicate participation in a regional market. The local market is
often represented by local pharmacy bottles and tokens. Most artifacts will not
provide information on manufacturers, and there may be containers manufactured in one place holding products manufactured at another. Items found on
site often provide data on the diet of the inhabitants. When archeologists think
of diet, they usually think of animal bones, which are certainly found on most

314

Texas Archeological Society

of these sites and can provide not only the traditional information about genus
and species and minimum number of animals, but also information on the cuts
of meat being eaten and the butchering techniques that were prevalent in the
area at a particular time period, subjects to which considerable attention has been
given in the literature. Other items of diet are often represented in the remains
found at a site. Tin cans often indicate the use of canned vegetables, meats, and
spices, and the use of coffee and tea is also often indicated by the embossed lids
of tins they were packed in. Lids of baking powder tins and condensed milk
cans are often found, and canning jars or lids may well indicate the home production of vegetables and/or fruit. Traditional recovery techniques such as flotation for charred food remains can provide additional information, and the use
of certain kinds of foods and condiments can be indicated by certain styles of
bottles and jars or by embossing on the sides or panels of bottles. Together, these
data can add much detail to the picture of the diet at the site.
Another aspect of the site that can be determined is relative wealth. The
inhabitants of sites containing much decorated porcelain and whiteware probably enjoyed a higher economic status than those sites containing mostly plain
ceramics. In the literature of historical archeology are several articles on the
economic scaling of ceramics. At present, economic status is usually determined
by the presence of decorated and nondecorated ceramics, several types of which
have established price values. Other kinds of artifacts might be used, but constructing scales for them would require considerable research effort, and ceramics provide a convenient and well-tested approach. The basis for scaling by
ceramic types is the fact that decorated ceramics were more costly than plain
ceramics and that certain decorative techniques were used on the most costly
ceramics.
On some historic sites, the economic pursuits of the occupants may be patently obvious, particularly industrial or manufacturing sites, and other sites, such
as town residences, may provide no artifactual information regarding the economic endeavors of their inhabitants. In any event, all excavators should be alert
for artifacts that might provide clues, such as tools, raw materials, pieces of
equipment used in farming or ranching, ephemeral items such as business cards
or tokens, or by many other artifacts that reflect occupational endeavors. However, it is often difficult to determine whether an artifact reflects the occupation
of the occupant of the site or is an item acquired by the occupant in the pursuit
of other activities. It is particularly useful to consult trade catalogs of the period
under study in order to learn the names and functions of many artifact parts
related to economic pursuits. Unfortunately it is often difficult to locate appropriate catalogs, but the search can be rewarding.
Family and Social Relationships
Often at residential sites the major outlines of the composition of family
groups can be determined from certain artifacts. The presence of men can be

Clark n Texas Historical Archeology

315

indicated by a variety of artifacts usually associated with grooming or clothing,
including collar studs, suspender buckles, straight razors, and many others.
Artifacts that indicate the presence of women might include decorative dress
buttons, corset stays, web belt buckles, face cream jars, canning jars, and sewing equipment. Boys might be represented by marbles, cast-iron toys, or other
male-oriented toys, and girls might be represented by doll parts or miniature
ceramics. These kinds of data should be considered together with archival and/
or informant information.
Oral History
Up to this point, I have considered only some of the possible uses of features and artifacts in the analysis of historic sites. But there are other sources of
information for historical archaeologists who wish to maximize the data base
for the analysis of a particular site or group of sites. Most archeologists in this
country get their degrees in anthropology, and the usual reason for studying
archeology is that we are studying the anthropology of past cultures, but at least
we should be trying in historical archeology to provide a descriptive ethnography, if not a more in-depth analysis and description of culture history and cultural change. Archeology provides a unique opportunity to consider and study
cultural patterning and change. While we are excavating historical simms, we
sometimes have visitors who offer personal reminiscences about the site, and
sometimes people who are familiar with the site are sought out and interviewed.
But the vast majority of informant interviews now in the literature seem to concentrate almost exclusively on acquiring information about the locations and
descriptions of structures formerly standing on the site.
If we are, in fact, attempting to do anthropological research on these sites
of the past, why do we limit our questions to a small segment of material culture? If one has a series of informants, why not ask questions about a wider
variety of data? Oral history need not be confined to historians or to expressly
historical topics: we can ask the same questions about social relationships that
social anthropologists ask. Nor do we need to be limited to purely historical
topics. By questioning informants, we can get information on the feelings and
perceptions of former site occupants or their descendants about cultural change.
It should be kept in mind, however, that the memory of any individual may be
faulty, so we should always have supplementary data---excavated archeological
remains, documents, or supporting testimony from other informants.
Sometimes, informants who visit excavations may indicate that they have
information, but in other cases it may be necessary to recruit informants, by
asking people who have lived near the site for a long time if they knew the site
occupants or their descendants or if they have information on the site and the
community, or by contacting the media--particularly television stations--who
can publicize your request for informants. Interviewing techniques should be as
comfortable as possible for the informants. Successful and productive relation-

316

Texas Archeological Society

ships can be fostered at their homes, on the site, or in neutral, but comfortable,
settings, but only rarely in the archeologist’s office. Bulky tape recorders are
intimidating, so it might be better to use an inconspicuous recorder or a notepad.
Try to prepare a series of questions beforehand, but be prepared to skip around
in the list as questions are answered in the course of the conversation with the
informant, for, although the questions may be ordered for the convenience of
the archeologist they almost certainly will not be discussed in that order, no
matter how logical it may be. Be prepared to skip from question to question.
The name, address, and age of the informant, date and place of the interview, and the project title must be recorded, for it is important to provide readers of the report with this information and with a reasonably detailed summary
of this primary descriptive data.
Archival Research
Archival research is a common feature of historical archeologicai reporting
that is often demanded in CRM work. Often, a chain of ownership satisfies the
State Historic Preservation Office requirement for archival research. Study of
deed records in county courthouses can sometimes provide genealogical data
when properties are inherited, sold to other family members, or subject to suits
to clear titles, and they can provide some indications of changes in property
values over time and the approximate dates of capital improvements. It may even
be possible to determine certain aspects about the predevelopment vegetation
patterns of original land grants from original survey notes usually found in the
archives of the General Land Office.
Other archival sources are tax records that may provide useful data about
property improvements and land values: tax sales, foreclosures and other recorded legal actions can provide valuable data on the economic status of the
occupants of sites. School censuses, county road books, minutes of meetings of
commissioner’s courts and other courthouse records can provide clues to activities: most counties have libraries of local history collections--documents, clippings, books and/or photographs---of varying quality and scope, which should
be supplemented with information from local county historical commissions,
county clerk’s offices (find the oldest clerk working there), and local businesses
(for early records, company histories, etc.). Among other, nonlocal, sources in
Texas are the Archives Division of the State Library, the Barker Texas History
Center at The University of Texas at Austin, the Confederate History Research
Center at Hillsboro, the Rosenberg Library in Galveston, church records, and
several archival holdings in Mexico and some from Spain, which have been
microfilmed and are housed in Austin or San Antonio. One should not overlook
church records.
Since only cursory examination of records may be possible during the visit
to the archive, it is extremely important to make maximum use of archives’ copying facilities in order to collect as many documents as possible for detailed

Clark ~ Texas Historical Archeology

317

examination later, elimination of transcription errors (a significant advantage),
and the potential to use the documents as illustrations in a final report.
When archival research materials are in another language (in Texas this is
usually Spanish), archeologists are cautioned that many documents containing
translation errors have led to the misinterpretation of the information. It is best
to have both a transcription and a translation, for the transcription might provide information that may not be in the translation, and it will certainly provide
a feel for the nature of the documentation.
Genealogy
Genealogy is one aspect often overlooked in investigations, but it can provide valuable information on family structure (kinship), or patterns of association in family groups, and, among families, information about migration,
demographic data, and other kinds of information, and it can also provide a feel
for the people. Some generalized information can be gleaned from informant
interviews, census data, school censuses, court records, land records, cemetery
records, military records, and many others, and the Texas State Library and
Archives have many valuable publications and documents in their specialized
collections. Fairly intensive genealogical research may well reveal quite important documentation on the activities of the site inhabitants showing their antecedents and revealing the history of their descendants, thereby making the
connection between the past and the present in a quite human manner. Several
readily available publications explain how to do this kind of research, and standard forms are available for summarizing the data collected and indicating relationships. Family group charts are particularly valuable; examples of these are
found in several publications and are available commercially.
One kind of information that can be developed in doing genealogical and
other archival research on a site is the pattern of interpersonal and economic
relationships (the networking) of the site occupants. These relationships can
include friendships, marriage patterns, business relationships and other economic
activities. Plotting these on general area maps may reveal the functioning of
geographic factors. This approach is relatively new in historical archeology and
has the potential to provide much valuable information. These patterns of networking may reveal primary and secondary communication routes, social groups,
lodge or club associations, and other potentially valuable information. Since this
area of historical archeological investigation is new to the field, the opportunities for creative approaches in this area are wide open.
Work with archival and, especially, genealogical sources often involves
references to deaths and funerals in county histories, genealogical source books, and
newspaper obituaries. Obituaries can provide the names of survivors, personal
history of individuals, and places of burial, and this information leads investigators
to cemeteries where they can glean more information, for tombstone inscriptions
sometimes provide information about family members and relationships that is not

318

Texas Archeological Society

provided in other documentation. The physical relationship of graves also can
provide further information about family groups. Graves sometimes provide
information on religious affiliation if the individuals are buried in cemeteries
associated with particular religions. Taken as a whole, cemeteries can provide much
demographic data, including age at death, periods of epidemic, gender-related
mortality, infant mortality, and other topics. The study of stylistic changes in
headstones and burial practices is also productive, since some tombstones indicate
lodge affiliations not indicated in other sources. Considering the plethora of data
available in cemeteries, it is worthwhile to search out and examine the cemeteries
in the vicinity of the site.
Several archival depositories maintain collections of photographs that provide information about the structures, layout, landscape, dress of the occupants,
activities of the site inhabitants, and images of the occupants themselves (I have
used historic photographs to provide details of construction when the archeological record was unclear). Photographs can be particularly valuable when there
is no structure surviving on the site. An equally important use of historic photographs is to provide investigators and readers with a feel for the living site
and occupants. Through the use of these materials, the archeological report
becomes more human.
Historical Context
At the present time, much is being made of a concept called historic context. As it seems to be interpreted by the office of the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), this term does not describe what the SHPO is looking for
in either reports or plans of investigation, but rather, discussions of a series of
historical/economic topics--hog production, folk art, town form, exploration and
settlement, military, economic development, and others--in relation to a particular site. These topics are meant to provide guidance in developing research
designs or plans of investigation of regional or temporal units, but it seems to
me that this scheme neither considers historical context nor provides adequate
guidance in the development of designs for the investigation of sites. However,
to me, the term historic context means the relationship that the site has to the
broad cultural and historical developments in the local area, the region, and the
nation. In Texas, these include international developments in France, Spain, and
New Spain that led to the exploration and colonization of Texas by the Spanish,
developments in the United States and Mexico that led to the Texas Revolution,
border friction during the Mexican Revolution, and other similar topics. It must
be remembered that the borders of Texas were fixed only recently and even now
hardly cut off the flow of people from one area to another. Members of the same
Mexican families live on different sides of the border, and a constant flow of
people existed in the prehistoric period as it does now. The historic context in
this sense would be best discussed in the historical background and conclusion
Of a report.

Clark ~ Texas Itistorical Archeology 319
The topical approach does not consider truly archeological questions or the
cultural anthropology of a site as already discussed. It does not consider cultural
process or the interactions of the ,carious eompouents of culture. Essentially, it does
not consider ongoing theoretical development of historical archeology but favors
piecemeal historic topics. We are still anthropologists and should keep that in mind
when excavating and analyzing sites.
The historic period is readily amenable to this approach, and the approaches
discussed above are possible with the techlaology and theoretical development
we now have available in the literature. We should allow for the future development of theory and techniques in the field and not limit ourselves to a series
of topics that can easily become fossilized and can stifle creative development
of theory and analytical technique.
Archeological Significance

The question of significance has bothered archeologists for many years.
While working on an early twentieth century rural tenant house, I was asked by
local county historical commission members as well as archeologists why I considered such a mundane site important and why were we wasting money digging
a site that was not architecturally elegant or related to a historically important
person or event. These people were looking at only some of the criteria for the
evaluation of site significance in terms of eligibility for inclusion in the National
Register of Historic Places. They did not consider the criterion that covers the
historical or archeological information a site has produced or may produce. I
have worked on sites associated with important historical persons and events.
These sites also yield information relatable to historical archeological theory.
Except for association with important persons or places, site significance depends solely on its potential to yield information on cultural process and change.
Sites of many ages, sizes, locations, and socioeconomic positions can provide
much information. Even the meanest hovel in the woods can be significant if it
can yield information relating to historical archeological theory, and on the other
hand, an elegant architectural confection may have no archeological significance
if its context has been destroyed. For example, the Anson Jones house in the
Washington-on-the-Brazos State Park is not archeologically significant because
it was moved to the park from another location. The critical factor is the potential of the site to answer questions relating to archeological theory and not to the
illustrating of historical factors such as structure size and the age of a particular
artifact. These are historical particularistic questions that often can be answered
through documentation or methodological techniques. Answers to this kind of
question are pertinent only to the specific site under investigation, whereas focusing on questions of process relates to broad cultural patterns and forms the
basis for the development and analysis of cultural hypotheses.
Significance, then, does not depend on age or, necessarily, the association of
the site with a historical personage or event or with craftsmanship. For historical

320

Texas Archeological Society

archeologists, it really depends on the potential of the site features, artifacts, and
documentation to yield information that can be analyzed with regard to specific
theoretical goals and to the development of hypotheses of culture theory. By
using a variety of methodological approaches to site analysis, some of which
have been discussed above, the hypothetical approaches are quite varied, offering historical archeologists an open field for creative hypothesis formulation and
testing. This aspect of historical archeology is something that can, in fact, be
done, and the formulation of data recovery plans, research designs, or mitigation
plans can consist of approaches that have a reasonable certainty of producing
valuable results. One need not formulate hypotheses for testing that go far
beyond the capabilities of the data.
Archeological Excavation
I have discussed, in cursory fashion, a variety of areas for the development
of theory and techniques to analyze excavated data and data gathered from mainly
historical or archival investigations. Still another aspect of historical archeology
that should be considered is techniques, or approaches to excavation. Because
sites in Texas were generally occupied by people who used only two systems of
measurement, these systems should be used when dealing with these sites, and
since the Spanish and Mexicans used leagues and varas in most cases during
their occupancy of Texas, excavators of Spanish or Mexican sites might consider using varas for measuring site features and for excavation units. If there is
a standing structure on the site, it is appropriate to orient the site grid to the
structure, perhaps using a corner or other significant part of the site as the point
from which measurements and units are taken.
Virtually all post-Mexican-era sites were laid out in the English system of
measurements, and, even now, most buildings, roads, and other works are in
this system, so it makes very little sense to impose the metric system on these
sites. The metric system is appropriate for sites in which there is a strong suspicion that the occupants had no formal system of measurement or that were
built using the metric system.
Most historic sites were not deposited or laid out in random patterns. In
most sites there are demonstrable concentrations, or at least patterned distributions, of features and patterns of artifact disposal that can be used by archeologists to maximize recovery of data. Metal detectors, magnetometers, aerial
photos, probes, mechanical removal of deposits, and other techniques can help
identify the areas of artifact disposal before excavation. This recognition of
disposal patterns may, in some cases, help archeologists to determine excavation plans. But archeologists must be flexible and let the circumstances at the
site guide the excavation program. Data recovery plans are all too often retained
long after they are found to be inappropriate.
The very definition of site boundaries and designation can become a problem
under some conditions. In a rural area where one may be working on a farmstead,

Clark m Texas Historical Archeology

321

is the site boundary the perimeter of the entire farm or is it the concentration of farm
structures? In a small town, perhaps the whole community should be given a single
site number, or perhaps each residence and commercial unit in the community
should have its own site number. This is even more of a problem in cities, where
there are dense concentrations of potential archeological features. Is the whole town
one site, or is each unit a site?
For towns and cities, there is a better system that avoids having a plethora
of site numbers. Because land transactions require precise reference systems,
most towns and cities were surveyed when they were laid out and have streets
and alleys, blocks, and lots that have been measured and given legal designations that are readily traceable in county deed records. They are convenient
mapping and cultural units, and they have real meaning to the culture and history of the community.
Reporting Results
Finally, there is the question of reporting the results of the project work.
What should one report and in how much detail? This depends on the objectives
of the archeologist and on the nature of the site, for in certain situations the
geographic setting--soils, climate, flora, and fauna--is important, whereas in
another the hardrock geology may be important, and in some cases, the environment may have had little effect on the location or occupation of the site. It may
not be efficient to provide the reader with extraneous data that do not pertain to
the occupation of the site or to the understanding of its history and archeology,
but the broad patterns of regional and national history should always be discussed in order to place the site in relation to that history. This is the historical
context of the site; i.e., how it relates to the history and archeological developments of the area should be a fairly extensive part of the report. As an extension
of this historical context, a more detailed site history should be provided, including the events that occurred at the site: the oral history, genealogy, and other
social/cultural information. The excavation techniques and features should be
described in some detail, and one section should deal with the artifacts, and since
they provide important cultural information necessary for the development of
the archeological questions to be answered, they should be described. When
artifacts are not in primary context, certain kinds of well-known artifact classes
should be listed, but other artifacts may require more description and analysis,
such as the listing of maker’s marks, patterns, and other special characteristics.
Following the artifact descriptions--which may vary from merely listing some
classes to extensive description and analysis of others--there should be a discussion
of the significance of the artifacts to the research questions usually defined in the
introduction of the report. This may include information regarding market systems,
ethnicity, class, consumer preference, or any of a number of other purely archeological questions. Finally, the conclusions should draw the historical, oral history,
environmental, archival, and genealogical data together with the artifact data to

322

data to provide a broad view--an anthropological view---of the occupation of the
site. For small sites with relatively few artifacts, these items usually should not result
in a very large report, but, for large sites or multisite projects, it is inevitable that the
resulting report should also be large and time-consuming to write. However, if the
research questions are developed and if the information in the report can be used by
other researchers, the end product will be worth the effort.

SUMMARY
Historical archeology is an open field of opportunity for the development
of techniques for enhancing the development of archeological culture theory and
new analytical techniques. Many valid research questions, already defined, can
take researchers many years to examine, and many more questions will develop
as we refine our understanding of cultural-historical process. Unfortunately, it
is not possible to get formal training in historical archeology in Texas, so Texas
historical archeologists must train themselves by reading the literature produced
in other states and in the national journals. They must also read history, both
interpretive and descriptive. First-person accounts can be quite valuable, but
archeologists must also become familiar with the literature on collections and
with architectural history and construction techniques. They should pursue the
broadest possible reading program, and, although it may not be necessary to be
knowledgeable about all aspects of the artifacts, it is important to know where
to find the information.
