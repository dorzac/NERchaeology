ABSTRACT

In May 1989 through July 1989, archeological and geomorphological investigations were conducted
at five prehistoric archeological sites impacted by drainage ditch construction in Hidalgo and Willacy
counties. These investigations were sponsored by Hidalgo County Drainage District No. l and Willacy
County Drainage District No. 1 as part of a continuing program of cultural resources studies along the
drainage ditch construction right-of-way. One site, 41WY140, is situated on a low rise adjacent to a main
channel of the ditch and lacks sufficient Holocene sediments to contain archeological materials in good
context. However, a tortoise, cf. Gopherus hexagonatus, was recovered, and the inorganic fraction was
assayed by radiocarbon to 9360 ± 415 B.P. If correct, this date indicates that these now-extinct tortoises
could have been coeval with Paleoindian occupations in South Texas. The other four sites are in or on the
edges of small deflationary basins. Based on the radiocarbon chronology obtained from these sites, soils
formed on many of the deflationary basins during the late Pleistocene. Between ca. 12,000 B.P. and
5000 B.P., these soils were removed by wind erosion, and in the last 5,000 years, a modem soil formed.
At all sites, this modem soil has been disturbed by historic farming, land clearing, and ditch construction.
The prehistoric archeological remains at 41HG128, 41WY112, 41WY113, and 41WYl34 are sparse,
reflecting a continuing record of nonintensive use by mobile hunter-gatherers. In order to assess the
National Register eligibility of individual sites, three models of hunter-gatherer resource and territorial
exploitation patterns were developed and a preliminary test of these models was conducted with the
regional archcological data base. The first model assumes unrestricted access to all major resource areas
in tl1e region; tl1e second model assumes that prehistoric territories focused on resources along the Rio
Grande floodplain; and tl1e third model assumes that hunter-gatl1erer territories were organized in response
to coastal resources. The results of the test were inconclusive, but important exploitation patterns were
recognized and invalid assumptions of the models identified. In light of the recovered materials from the
sites, the analysis of the regional data base, and the assessment of the models, none of the five sites
reported here are judged eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, and no further work
at these sites is recommended.

INTRODUCTION

by C. Britt Bousman and Gail L. Bailey

This report presents the findings from archeological investigations of lhe following five prehistoric
sites in Hidalgo and Willacy counties in the Lower
Rio Grande Valley of South Texas: 4lHG128,
41WY112, 41WY113, 41WY134, and 41WY140.
These sites are along the Hidalgo-Willacy Drainage
Ditch, a manrnade river system constructed by
Hidalgo County Drainage District No. 1 and Willacy
County Drainage District No. 1, that drains
hurricane-delivered floodwaters from an enormous
area in these two counties (Fig. 1). 111cse five sites
were originally reported in 1987 and recommended
for Phase II test excavations at that time (Hall et
al. 1987). One of the sites is located in eastern
Hidalgo County, while the remaining four are in
central and western Willacy County. The present
field investigations, which began in May and continued through June of 1989, were conducted by
Prewitt and Associates, Inc. under contract with
Hidalgo County Drainage District No. 1 and Willacy
County Drainage District No. 1.
Hidalgo County Drainage District No. 1 and
Willacy County Drainage District No. 1 sponsored
the archeological testing reported herein as part of
an ongoing program of cultural resource mitigation
along the drainage ditch. These current investigations
were conducted under the regulations of the State
of Texas Antiquities Code (Texas Natural Resource
Code of 1977, Title 9, Clmptcr 191, VTCS 6145-9)
with Texas Antiquities Committee Permit No. 784,
and under the special conditions of U.S. Army C01ps
of Engineers Permit No. 11374 issued by the

Galveston District Office. The cultural resources
are considered under the provisions of 33 CFR 325,
Appendix C; 36 CFR 800; and 36 CFR 36. Authorizing legislation includes the National Historic
PreseIVation Act of 1966, P.L. 89-665, P.L. %-515
(as amended), Executive Order 11593 (Protection
and Enhancement of the Cultural Environment 1971 ),
and the Archeological and Historical PrescIVation
Act of 1974, P.L. 93-291 (as amended).
Twelve cultural resource investigations have
been conducted in conjunction with the Hidalgo and
Willacy counties drainage ditch project. The first,
sponsored by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
Galveston District, was a controlled sample survey
of the region carried out in 1976 by the Office of
the State Archeologist, Texas Historical Commission
(Mallouf et al. 1977), as a preliminary assessment
of the archeological resources. Forty-nine sites were
recorded, and the sparse nature of the archeological
remains was noted. This initial assessment could
be used for planning more extensive and efficient
cultural resource investigations along the ditch rightof-way.
Prewitt and Associates, Inc. has conducted all
remaining cultural resource investigations associated
with the drainage ditch, beginning in I 980 with two
projects, one sponsored by the Corps of Engineers
and the second sponsored by the county drainage
districts. TI1is resulted in the survey and assessment
of archeological sites discovered along various
sections of the planned ditch right-of-way (Day et
al. 1981). These investigations were founded on

a simple predictive model (i.e., sites would be
located adjacent to water resources and often on
adjacent elevated landforms) and utilized sophisticated analyses of aerial photographs and topographic
maps to identify the locations of small deflationary
play as with a higher probability of associated sites.
Fifty-three sites were discovered, and two sites,
41 WY50 and 41 WY(fJ, were selected for limited
testing. A burial was recovered from the testing
of 41 WY50 and was dated by radiocarbon. Two
additional sites on the North Ditch in eastern WilJacy
County were in immediate danger of destruction by
the excavation of the ditch, and these were
recommended for National Register testing. Soon
thereafter, these two prehistoric sites, 41 WY7 l and
4IWY72, were investigated ~Day 1981). Site
41 WY72 was judged eligible for listing on the
National Register of Historic Places, resulting in
its preservation by alteration of the route of the
drainage ditch (Day 1981). In 1981, the districts
began a monitoring program for sites disturbed by
construction on the North Ditch, but this did not result
in efficient or reliable field assessments of buried
sites in the region due to the sparseness of the
remains. In 1982, Willacy County Drainage District
No. 1 funded an archeological survey along the
Lyford Drain, resulting in the discovery of an
additional ten sites and National Register testing
of a single prehistoric site, 41 WY84 (MercadoAllinger 1983). Site 41 WY84 was judged ineligible
for listing on the National Register.
In November 1985, the excavated segments of
the drainage ditch were surveyed and nineteen
archeological sites were discovered in the eroding
banks of the ditch. Many of these sites had not been
visible before ditch construction, and many could
only be discovered after rain washed spoil off of
the excavated ditch slopes. Thus, surveying after
construction actually increased site visibility and
the discovery rate of the region's thinly distributed
archeological resources.
In 1986, systematic surface survey again
resumed, with reconnaissance of existing channel
segments allowing an assessment of buried archeological remains (Hall et al. 1987). Forty-three
archeological si tes were recorded, and geomorphological and palcontological investigations were
initiated. Twenty-two Pleistocene fauna! localities
were located and seven extinct tortoise remains
(Gopherus he.xagonatus) were recovered but witl10ut
any evidence of human associations. In addition,

one archeological site, the Sardinas Resaca Site
(41HG 118), was mitigated and radiocarbon dates
obtained. Finally, an eroding burial was excavated
from the ditch bank at 41WY113.
Hall et al. (1987) summarire all Phase I investigations and provide recommendations for the 158
cultural resources (l 18 sites and 35 isolated artifacts)
discovered up to that time. They (Hall et al.
1987:76-77) identified 27 sites for National Register
testing, 9 of which were identified by Corps sponsored investigations in 1980. The remaining 18 sites
were recorded by investigations sponsored by the
county drainage districts, and Hall et al. (1987:77)
recommended that a sample of 7 be selected for
National Register Testing in tl1c Phase II portion
of tl1c project. Since the 1986 work, two small
surveys have recorded two archeological sites (Quigg
et al. 1989; Quigg, Appendix F, this report). The
1988 work plan guiding the current investigations
recommended that only five sites receive Phase II
testing and that two sites be reserved for future Phase
II testing-level investigations. The sites recommended for testing were 41HG128, 4 1WY112,
41WY113, 41WY134, and41WY140 (see Ompter
4 for selection criteria).
In 1986, a technical proposal (Prewitt and
Associates, Inc. 1986) was submitted for archcological investigatioos along tlie Hidalgo-Willacy Drainage Ditch. This proposal identified four major goals
and provided a theoretical model of hunter-gatherer
mobility and territorial organization. The four major
goals ~re to develop tlie ethndlistorical, archeological, and paleoenvironmental records, and then, with
this data base, develop a synthesis of prehistoric
occupations. Past and recent ethnohistorical research
(Ruccking 1953, 1955; Salinas 1986; Campbell 1988)
has provided a detailed e thnohistorical record and
no further primary research is necessary. However,
the archeological and paleoenvironmental records
still require attention.
The 1988 work plan (Prewitt and Associates,
Inc. 1988) for these Phase II investigations outlined
many of the limitations in the regional archeological
record and suggested a broad-based strategy utilizing
a number of analytical techniques. During excavation
it became clear that the archeological sites lacked
the temporal, stratigraphic, and chronological resolution to justify such a broad-based approach. Thus,
a number of analytical methods were not employed,
including analyses of pollen and molluscan fauna,
proton magnetometer surveys of all sites, use- wear

Prehistoric Archeology and Pa/eoenvironments in Hidalgo and Willacy Counties

and residue analyses on stone tools, and trace
element analysis of ceramics. A series of analyses
were judiciously selected that were less inhibited
by the lack of resolution; these included stable
isotope analysis of radiocarbon-dated human remains, soil humates, and pedogenic calcium carbonates. In addition, attention was focused on the
regional archeological record, most of which had
been amassed by the twelve projects associated with
the drainage ditch but had never been synthesiz.ed.
Guiding this preliminary regional synthesis was
the 1986 research design that had been incorporated
into the 1988 work plan. The research design
proposed alternative models of hunter-gatl1erer
seasonal transhumance along the lower coast based
on earlier hypotheses by Hester (1981) and research
by Alen (1983). TI1ese models provided a theoretical
framework into which regional synthesis could best
fit. In the current investigations, these models have
been expanded and tested, representing a first step
toward achieving a new syntl1esis of the prehistoric
record in the Lower Rio Grande Valley.
This report consists of eight chapters and six
appendixes. Chapter 1 provides introductory information and background environmental data pertinent
to the project. Chapter 2 presents the archeological
background and discusses the previous archeological
work in the region, highlighting tl1e problems of
prehistoric culture chronologies in southern Texas.
Chapter 3 is a theoretical research design that
develops models of hunter-gatl1erer resource use,
mobility, and territoriality, and presents the archeological predictions of these models. Chapter 4
presents the field and laboratory objectives and
methods used on tl1is project. Site descriptions
constitute Chapter 5, and the basic site data are
presented there. Chapter 6 discusses the isotopic
results in tenns of paleoenvironments and paleodiets.
The models outlined in Chapter 3 are tested in
Chapter 7, and a preliminary syntl1esis is offered
on hunter-gatherer adaptations in tl1e Lower Rio
Grande Valley. Chapter 8 presents the substantive
conclusions reached by this work, the assessments
of the individual sites in terms of National Register
eligibility, and the recommendations for future work
at these sites. The first appendix provides detailed
descriptions of the diagnostic artifacts recovered
by this project. Appendix B discusses the results
of a proton magnetometer survey of two sites.
Appendix C presents detailed profile descriptions
of geological backhoe trenches and selected test units.

Appendix D presents and discusses the radiocarbon
dates obtained on this project and provides tree-ringcalibrated ages. Appendix E discusses ,the unique
and advantageous water-screening system used on
this project, and Appendix F reports the findings
of a small survey conducted by Prewitt and Associates, Inc. during April of 1989.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
This section describes the environment of the
project area, providing necessary background information. It presents a general picture of the regional
geology that allows the specific geological findings
to be placed in a broader framework. It also outlines
the climatic and botanic parameters that constitute
the foundation of the hunter-gatherer models discussed in Chapters 3 and 7.
Climate
The Lower Rio Grande Valley region is warm
and is classified as subtropical (Bomar 1983). Given
its proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, the region
receives surprisingly little precipitation. Temperature
extremes become more marked and rainfall decreases
away from the coast. The flow of the upper level
jet streams controls the movement and juxtaposition
of four air masses--maritime polar (Pacific),
continental Arctic, continental tropical, and maritime
tropical-that create weather patterns in South Texas
(Bomar 1983:28-37). Because the polar jet stream
loops fartl1er south during the winter, maritime polar
(cool-wet) and continental Arctic (cold-dry) fronts
occasionally penetrate as far south as the Lower
Rio Grande Valley. These fronts normally are
accompanied by rain as cold and warm moist air
masses meet. The distance from the Arctic and the
proximity of the Gulf of Mexico, however, limit the
number of freezes to one or two days per year near
the coast and slightly more often farther inland.
During the warmer montl1s, the polar jet stream
migrates farther north and tl1e subtropical jet stream
blows in from the south west steering the warm dry
continental tropical air masses over the region,
causing the unusually dry conditions near the Gulf
in South Texas.
Average monthly high temperature readings
taken for the period 1951-1980 at five stations in
the region provide a picture of seasonal and spatial
variability (Fig. 2). Throughout the region, winter

temperatures arc warm; as noted above, cold fronts
are few. As tl1e seasons progress, spatial differences
become more marked wilh August showing lhe
greatest spatial variability. Summer temperatures
arc cooler near lhe coast and progressively warmer
inland. While it is well known !hat temperatures
decrease witl1 increasing elevation, lhe average
normal lapse rate cannot account for !his regional
temperature difference; ratlier, it is due to the sea
breezes lhat normally influence temperatures wilhin
10-15 miles (25-40 km) of the coast (Bomar
1983:184).
The regional average yearly rainfall is approximately 635 mm (25 inches), falling wilhin a semiarid
climatic classification; however, lhe atmosphere is
often very humid because of the proximity of lhe
Gulf of Mexico (Norwinc and Bingham 1986). The
low precipitation is aggravated by a high potential
evapotranspiration rate of 1525 mm (60 inches) per
year. Precipitation is highly variable (coefficient
of variation = 35), and years wilh normal rainfall
(i.e., wilhin 10% of lhe average) occurred only 30%
of the lime between 1900 and 1983 (Norwinc and
Bingham 1986:3- 6). Drought cycles wilh irregular
intervals characterize die twentielh-<:cntury rainfall

record (Fig. 3) and probably existed lhroughout lhe
past. One factor in lhe irregularity in lhe dry-wet
cycles must be lhe occurrence of hurricanes, which
arc related to nonlocal forcing mechanisms. It is
self-evident !hat hurricanes do not occur during major
droughts, and their absence is a factor in the longevity of drought conditions in Soulh Texas. For
example, no hurricanes hit lhe Soulh Texas coast
between 1947 and 1960 (Brown et al. 1980:27), and
tl1is spans the period of lhc worst drought on record
in Soulh Texas.
The seasonal distribution of rainfall is bimodal
wilh lhe greatest peak in September, which is lhe
height of lhe hurricane season, and a smaller peak
in May or June (Fig. 4). Rainfall is low from lhe
beginning of November lhrough April. Precipitation
tends to show a spatial pattern wilh rainfall decreasing from the northeast to the soulhwest.
Geology
The bedrock geology in lhe Lower Rio Grande
Valley is characterized by alluvial and deltaic
deposits. Wind has eroded these to form extensive
eolian deposits lhroughout much of the region,

especially in the northern part of Willacy County
and most of Kenedy County. Surface bedrock
deposits are youngest in the cast and become progressively older to the west. Figure 5 shows the
distribution of bedrock formations in the project area.
Bedrock deposits in the western portion of the
project area consist of the Goliad Formation. These
arc Pliocene fluvial deposits consisting of clays,
sands, marls, and gravels. The only known source
of knappable lithic materials in the project area
occurs in the Goliad Formation as river gravels near
La Joya. Other sources, as yet undiscovered,
probably occur in this deposit. The Goliad Formation
extends from La Joya in the far southwest comer
of the region to La Sal Vieja, a natural salt lake
in an internally draining basin in western Willacy
County.
A thin baIXI of the Lissie Formatim occurs along
the eastern edge of the Goliad Formation in southeastern and eastern Hidalgo County. It is a prograding delta deposit that probably was deposited
during a high sea stand in the Pleistocene, but it is
undated by chronometric methods. The sediments
consist of clays, silts, sands, and gravels, although
no knappablc lithic sources are known from the
Lissie Formation. One site investigated during this
project occurs on this formation.
Most of the sites investigated during this project
occur on the Beaumont Formation. The Beaumont
Formation is the most recent Pleistocene formation
and is a deltaie deposit preserving many channel
meander scars on its surface. It is undated on the
lower Texas coast, but the majority of the deposits
probably date to the last interglacial period between
132,000 and 120,000 years ago, or possibly as late
as 83,000 B.P. For deposition to have occurred at
that elevation, sea level must have been above or
at least near its present elevation. Chappell and
Shackleton's ( 1986) recent study of global sea level
changes in the last 150,000 years suggests that sea
levels have been at least 12 m below I.he modern
sea level over I.he last 112,000 years (Fig. 6), and
in the last 80,000 years, sea levels were at least
27 m below modern levels. On the upper Texas
coast, Aronow (Birdseye and Aronow 1988:7) has
radiocarbon dated seven marine shells from the
Beaumont Formation at the Rose City Sand Pit.
All but one arc infinite dates, and the one finite
date is 35,300 B.P. According to Chappell and
Shackleton (1986:139), at 35,000 B.P. sea level was
65 m below the modem level, and it is difficult to

accept this one finite radiocarbon date from the Rose
City Sand Pit as an accurate age estimate for the
majority of the Beaumont Fonnation.
At the beginning of the last glacial period when
sea levels initially dropped, the Rio Grande began
to cut down, and deposition of the Beaumont Fonna,tion, at least as a delta deposit, ceased. It is possible that limited alluvial deposition did occur during
the last glaciation, but at the peak of the Last Glacial
Maximum only 18,000 years ago, sea level was
150 m (492 ft) below the present level, and the
shoreline was some 150-175 km (60-70 mi) east
of the present coast. The inland fluvial erosion that
must have been stimulated by this dramatic drop
in base level would have removed much of the
previous alluvial deposits in the active Rio Grande
Valley, and this partially may account for the lack
of deposits dating to the last glacial period. It is
possible that alluvial deposits dating between 18,000
and 10,000 B.P. arc present along the Rio Grande;
similar-age deposits, the Deweyville Terraces, are
known from the upper Texas coast and the lower
Trinity River (Aten 1983:110-115). Such deposits
have not been identified yet in South Texas, although
the Rio Grande terrace deposits in I.he western portion
of the region may date to this period.
Frazier (1974:2) has mapped a number of linear
sand bodies offshore in the shallow portion of the
Gulf (upper 180 m). These are most certainly barrier
island deposits, but as sea level rise was so rapid
after the Last Glacial Maximum and barrier islands
would have had too little time to fonn, these probably date to the period between the Last Interglacial
and the Last Glacial Maximum (i.e., 112,00030,000 B.P.). During the period of initial human
habitation of the area, these relict barrier islands
would have been exposed in a similar manner to
the present-day Ingleside Barrier Island/Strandplain
deposits farther up the coast (Price 1933; Birdseye
and Aronow 1988).
At the end of the Pleistocene, sea levels rose
rapidly; submerged freshwater and saltwater deposits
in the Gulf provide measurements of sea level rise
for the end of the Pleistocene and the Holocene
periods (Frazier 1974; Brown et al. 1980; Pearson
et al. 1986; Prewitt and Paine 1987). This rise was
not continuous, but experienced dips at ca. 12,000
and 8200 B.P. (Fig. 7). By ca. 7000 B.P., sea levels
were established near modem levels; however, minor
fluctuations have occurred since that time. Evidence
of a maximum height of 1.5 m above current mean

sea level is documenled at approximately 3500 Il.P.
in the Coastal Ilend region of Texas (Prewitt and
Paine 1987), and there is no reasoo to believe that
this was not experienced throughout the Texus Gu)[
Coast. At or slightly before this time, the barrier
islands (Brazos, Padre, Mustang, and olhcrs) began
to build up, forming Laguna Madre, a saline lagooo.
Barrier island formatioo is dependent on a sourec
of material (e.g., sands from the Rio Grande),
sufficiently strong offshore currents, and a relatively
stable sea level.
Directly south of the Beaumont.Formation. Uic
present Rio Grande floodplain deposils and delta
provide a direct analog for tl1e Bcatunont Formation.
The McAllen-Brownsville geology map of the
modem delta surface (Bureau of Economic Geology
1976) clearly shows meander belts bounded by
overbank alluvial deposits which arc mainly muds.
The Rio Grande Valley becomes extremely flat in
the western portion of the region. This low grade,
extending east to the coast, does not provide the
energy necess!II)' to transport gravels and cobbles,
and lhus it is w1likely that knappable lithic materiols
occur in these recent fluvial deposits. These meanders in the floodplain and distribulary channels in
the delta still functioo as drainage channels known
locally as rcsacas, and in some cases diey form
oxbow Jakes. One large distributary channel of the
Rio Grande is known as the Arroyo Colorado; at
some point in time, it may have been the main
channel of the Rio Grande. Interestingly, the Rio
Grande, like the Brazos River, does not have a large
inlet bay; instead, an extensive delta has developed.
This suggests dial infilling of the Pleistocene-eroded
valleys is complete, which could be due to higher
sediment loads in these river systems than in others
that still have large inlet bays at the coast.
The last major sedimentary process in the Lower
Rio Graude Valley is wind erosion and deposition.
Much of no11hem Willacy and Hidolgo counties, most
of Kenedy Cowity, and most of the coast arc covered
by stable or active eolian dcposils. The inland
distributions of these sand bodies are usually aloog
a southeast to northwest axis, mirroring the modem
prevailing wind direction (Brown et al. 1980:27).
The most likely source or tl1e sands is the shore,
but all of the previously mentioned Ptio--Plei•tocenc
or Holocene fluvial deposiL' are oontrlbutors as well.
Sand dunes arc still active in fa!' northeast Willacy
County and eastern Kenedy County. In fact lhe area
between Kingsville and Raymoudvillc is known as

the South Texas Sand Sheet (Price 1958). Finegrained eolian deposits known as clay dunes occur
along the east side of Laguna Madre and on the
downwind side of some large inland lakes, e.g., La
Sal Vieja. It is likely that clay dune formation along
the coast is linked with sea level rise, and most
extant coastal clay dunes probably prn;tdate the last
highstand at 3500 B.P. A preliminmy inspection
of coastal clay dune orientatlon, ltowever, suggests
that these dunes may date to more than one period
or be the result of seasonal changes in prevailing
winds. Obviously, morc-det11iled work is required
to assess this hypothesis. Clay dunes associated
with inland lakes should have much longer and more
complele records of sedimentation as they are beyond
the effects of marine transgressions and regressions,
These inland lakes arc generally believed to be
blowouts resulting from wind scouring, and the
analysis of Holz and Prewitt (1981) shows that a
great number of blowouls of all sizes occur lluoughout the regioo, often in abandoned channel scars
preserved on the surface of the Beaumont Formation
(Fig. 8).

Environmental Zones
The research objective.~ of die initiill archeological projects in the region were concerned with
predicting site locations according to landforms.
In order IO develop these predictions, the environment
was usually categorized into a large number of
landform types or environmental zooes. While this
is worthwhile within lhe context of sample surveys,
the project reported here has different objectives,
and thus the environmental wnes used in previous
projects (Mallouf et al. 1977; Day 1981; Day et
al. 1981; Hall ct al. 1987) are not used here. One
of the main objectives of the current project is to
develop and test a set of models for prehistoric
hunter-gatherer resource exploitalion in the Lower
Rio Grande Valley (see Oiaptcr 3). '!be previous
environmental zones chosen for site prediction
overlooked environments with important resources
that must have influenced prehistoric hunter-gatherer
mobility, resource use, and territorial divisions. In
order to develop realistic expectations of lhc models
presented in Chnpter 3, a new, less-complex set of
environmental zones is presented below.
These zones are distinguished on tl1c basis or
geologic, climatic, botanic, fauna!, hydrologle, and
topographic charncteristics. Zone boundaries

represent transitional areas and, for the most part,
are not well-defined on the ground. These zones
identify the major resources available throughout
tlie project area and thus help identify the exploitative
potential of the Lower Rio Grande Valley to the
hunter-gatherer groups who oecupied the region
prehistorically. The five mnes discussed below are
the sand sheet, the lowland plain, the upland plain,
the coast, and the Rio Grande floodplain and dclln
(Fig. 9). To maintain continuity with previous
projects, Table l presenl' a correlation between lhese
five zooes and the environmental .zones used in
previous projects.

Surface water would have boen available prehistorically at springs, in blowout playas, or near the
surface in swales between sand dunes.
The most detniled study of the vegctlltion of
lhe sand sheet W1lS accomplished by Johnslon (1955).
Unforrunately, Jolmston's slndy took place during
the mid 19508 in the middle of the worst drought
on record (sec Fig. 3), and the thcn-<:um:nt climatic
conditions must be taken into account when using
hfa srudy. He divided the vegetation into three major
communities: oak mattes, prairies, and bm-,h
(Johnston 1955:47-112). Oak mattes occur most
frequently on the higher sand hills and are replaced
by prairie or brush on lower ground or near die coast
These different communities are considered to .be
sedal progressions with brush being the climax
community except on loose sand where oak mattes
comprise dle ctimax community (Johns~m 1955:48).
Johns toll ( 1955:50) suggests that prairies are retained
only by consistent burning and a lack of overgrazing.
During the 1950s drought with il' associated extreme
overgrazing, it is possible that brush was indeed the
ctimax community, or at least better adapted to those
stressful conditions, but in wetter times and with
natural grazing conditi011<, it is likely that prairies
would have been climax communities in areas not
favored by oak mattes. As the mush community
is more common in oilier environmental zones. it
is discussed in more detail below.
Plant composition in prairie oommunities varies,
and Johnston (1955:95-106) has identified two types
of prairies in the project area. One occurs on loose
sands in the sand sheet zone. Where little disturbed
by overgrazing or drought, a good plant cover exists
and grasses might be up to 3 ft high. Dominant
perennial gntc'lS genera include A11dropogon, PanicW11,
Paspalum, Efyonurus. Brachiaria, Cenchrus. and
Chloris. As overgrazing increases, plant cover
decrenses and perennial grasses are replaced by forlls
and species characteristic of otl1cr plant communities
such as brush.
The oak mottes are dominated by live oak,
Quercus virginiana or Q. oleoides quaterna~ and
most often occur on higher terrain and on loose sandy
soil. Salt spray carried by strong offshore winds
dramatically limits the eastward extension of oak
mattes. Nonnally the moltcs form small groves with
a 15-ft canopy and litd e undcrstory and provide the
only shade in the sand sheet. In this shaded microenvironmcnt, the grasses Vaseyochloa, Sporobolus,
Trichoneura, Paspalum, Digitaria, and Cenchrus

Sand Sheet

This zone is a stabilized and active dune area
Iba! supports a savanna habitat. The b'Cncral vegelatioo paltem is one of grasslands wid1 dispersed live
oak mattes. Mesquite and thorn brush thickets are
documented here but arc not common. Johnston
(!955:2) calls this the eolian plain, while Clover
(1937) labels it theZacatal prairie grass. The sand
sheet includes all of Kenedy and Brooks counties,
northern Hidalgo and Willacy counties, and parts
of Jim Hogg, Starr, Kleberg, Duval, and Jim Wells
countie..'i.
According to Brown et al. (1980:19), the dune.
fields probably developed during the Holocene when
the climate became increasingly arid and the southeastern wind patterns developed; however, it is likely
that the prevailing wind patterns were established
long before the beginning of the Holocene period
at ca. 10,000 B.P. As these dunes have not been
dated chronomctrically, Brown'shypodicsis remains
conjecture. Nevertheless, it is clear that eolian
processes eroded and transported coastal plain
sediments inland, thus creating large dune fields
stretching from Baffin Bay to U1e Rio Grande Valley
(Fig. 10). These active and stabilized dune deposits
overlie the Goliad, Lissie, and Bcarnoont formations.
Few streams drain the surface of this zone
because of the high permeability of the sands, the
low rainfall budget, and Uic extremely flat topography of Uie area. A few streams do drain internal
basins wilh saline lakes, but tlicir calchments are
small. McGraw (1984:9) and Hester ( 1980:34--35)
suggest that groundwater was nearer the surface and
more available prehistorically than today because
of depletion of the underground waler reservoir during
historic times, especially dwing lhe twentieth ccnlllf'y.

occur. Among a variety of other planls commonly
found in oak mottes, Mustang grape (Vitis
candicam), yucca (Yucca treculeana), drummond
wax-mallow (Malvaviscus drummondii'), Mullein
nightshade (Sola11um verbascifolium), western soap-berry (Sapi11dus drununondii), and woolybucket
bumelia (Bumelia lanuginosa) are also present.
Animals in the oak mattes are plentiful and include
deer, turkey, javelin a, turtles, snakc.1, and rodents,

(Desmanthus virgatus depressus) and lhyrsus dalea
(Dalea thyrsif/ora), and composites such as dugweed
(Dy.<sodia tenui/oba) nnd clappia (Clappia
suaedaefolia) (Johnston 1955:73). Brush oommunities
stop at Oie edges of blowouls where lhickets of sugar
hackberry (Ce/tis laevigata) and sweet aeaeia (Acacia
farnesia/lll) or lhick stands of Eragrostis spicata,
a coarse bunch grass, often occur (Fig. 11).
The prairie community most commonly associated with lhe lowland plain is called lhe Sandy Loam
Prairie (Johnston 1955:107-109). Johnston was
unnble to find any undisturbed stands of this community ns most had been invaded by brush species to
some degree. Amoug the plants commonly found
iu lhis community are perennial grasses (Cenchrus,
Eragrostis, Chloris, Aristida, and Sporobolus), and
forbs (Desmanthus virgatus depre.vsus, Cassia
fasciculata, Croton spp., andEriogomun multij/orum).

Lowland Plain

This wne is characterized by a featureless
landscape wilh no naturul drainages. Scattered over
its surface are shallow blowouts Miich form seasonal
playas iinged by lhin eolian deposits on an abandoned
delta of lhe Rio Grande. Most of this area is
intensively farmed today, and nalnral plant oommunities have been removed or recently covered by hm1h
invaders. In the past, lhe upland portion of the zone
had natural prairies, brush thickets, and a few oak
moties, while plants wilh greater water wquirements
surrounded lhe blowouts. This wne nppaiently had
fewer resourres and less water lhan most olher wnes
in lhe project area. All archeological sites investigated during the present project are in this zoue.
Johnston (1955:61-82) identifies two types
of brush communities as "deep brush" and "short
brush." lt is mostly the deep brush community that
characterizes lhe lowland plain zone. Clover
(1937:50) refers to lhese brush plant communities
as "mesquilah:hapnrral" and "rnesquital--nopalera."
The deep brush plant communities consist of
xerophytic short tree,~ and low shrubs which often
grow in impenetrable thickets; many of the species
found in bmsh plant communities are edible (Vines
1960). The most obvions plant species in brush
thickets is mesquite {Prosopis julijlora), attaining
heights of l0-30 ft, but significant othernatJve plants
include spiny hackberry (Celtis pallid11), yucca
(Yucca trecu/eana), several species of prickly pear
(Opunria spp.), Texas lantana (Lantana horrida),
Mexican-marjornm (Lantana macropoda), snffronplum bumelia (Bumelia angustifolia), Humboldt
coyotillo (Karwinskia humboldtiana), bluewood
condalia (Condalia obovata), mbber-plant (Mozinna
spathulata), and barbwire ncanthocewus
(Acamhocereus pelllagonus). Small open glades
scattered throughout brush communities are ol\en
dominated by grasses such as Buchloe, Chloris, and
Heteropogon, legumes such as Rayado bundle-flower

Upland Plain

This zore is distinguished from lhe lowland plain
mainly by a slight rise in elevation, more-rolling
topography, and an increase in perennial and intermittent streams. This small escarpment oonsists
of low calcareous gravelly hills of the Goliad
Fonnation, and the characteristic plant community
is low dense chaparral which Johnston (l 955:67-'68)
has termed "short brush." Anolher major difference
between lhe upland and lowland plain, at least to
the prehistoric inhabitants of this region, is 01e
presence of !mappable lithic resources in lhe upland
plain. The species composition of the short brush
community is similar to lhe deep brush community
with lhe addition of a number of cacti (e.g.,
Eclli1wcereus spp.,Ancistrocactus sp., andNeomammillaria spp.) and perennial herbs (Eriogonum sp.,
Heliotropium spp., Tetraclea sp., and varirus Vemena
family members).

Coast
This zone is a linear strip of land parallel to
the coastline. A number of diverse habitats are
present, including lhe Gulf of Merica, barrier islands,
tldal flals and lagoons, clay dunes, wetlands, estuaries, sand dunes, and low-lying flats. The interplay
between aquatic and terrestrial, and also between
freshwater and saline environments causes this to
be one of lhe most productive, complex, and fragile
environmental zones in South Texas. ln addition,

of this herbaceous community are Borrichia frutesce11s. Mo11a11thoch loe littoralis, and Batis maritima.
'This community commonly occurs on low-lying clay
soils along the coastline, and it SWTOunds clay dunes
in the intertidal flats of Laguna Madre. Some clay
dWles support a short brush community with mesquite, prickly pear, and the bunch grass, Sporobolus
wrightii. Nearest the strand in the harshest of
conditions is a community of succulent. halophytes,
the Batis-Sallcornia-Suaeda community. The
dominant plants include ·n.. maritima, Salicornia
pere1111is, Salicornia bigelovii, Suaeda conferta, and
Suaeda li11earis.
·
Plants are not the most important resources of
the coastal zone; rather, shellfish, fish, and waterfowl
provide the greatest economic opportunities. Prehistorically, the most important shellfish was the whelk,
Busycon sp., but a number of other species are known

the effects of stonns and hurricanes make lhis one
of the most unstable environments in the region.
The plants that inhabit this zone must be adapted
to saline conditions. Offshore breezes deliver an
almost constant source of salt to a wide band of land
flanking the Gulf of Mexico and Lagw1a Madre.
Oaks cannot live with this much exposure to salt,
and thus the oak moues disappear near the coast.
Three distinctive plant communities occur in sequence
and arc conLrolled by their varying resistence to
windbome salt, with increasing salt exposure dramatically reducing the diversity of the plant communities.
The first community is dominated by bunch grass
(Spartina spartinae) with rare occwrnnces of
Houstonia nigricans and Hybamhus verticillatus
platyphyllus. Closer to the saltwater and in moresaJine soils than the first commwnty is tlie BorrichiaBatis-Monathochloe community. The codominants

Elhnohistoric documents (Ruecking 1953 and 1955;
Salinas 1986; Cnmpbell 1988) indicate the importance of fishing along the coast, but the utilized fish
species arc wumown. Migratory and nonmigratory
waterfowl were certainly an important food source,

palmetto palm tree grove but in lesser frequencies.
However, some plants such as Colubrina greggii
occur in Texas only in this plant community, while
others such as vine mimosa (Mimosa nialacophylla)
are more common here than in any other area of
Texas.
LAND MODU'ICATIONS
It is well documented that historic agricullural
practices in the project urea have drastically changed
the local landscape (Mallouf et al. 1977; Day et
al. 1981; Hall et al. 1987). Land leveling, brnsh
clenring and buming, filling of depressions, and
redistribution al' topsoil have substantially altered
the erosional and depositional dynamics of lhe area.
As U1e entire project area has been subjected to
historic farming and associated land-modification
activities, it is doublful that many intact undisturbed
snrfaces now exist (Fig. 12).
In additioo to grrund surface disturbances ca~
by agricultural activities, COfl'itruction of the drainage
ditches has altered the land.<>eape in a more-localized
manner; all archeological sites discussed in this
report have been impacted by ditch construction.
The ditches were dug with large draglines and the
dirt placed in linear spoil piles 10-15 m away from
lbe ditch edges. Access roads were bnilt along both
sides of the ditches. Construction of access roads
often required filling depressions and leveling small
low rises. These roads slope down away from the
ditches, and arc bounded on their outside edges by
shallow ditches cut for water drainage. Road graders
are used to maintain the roads, and dirt scraped off
the roads is piled between the ditches and roads to
form low berms. Through time, these berms build
up wilb a sequence of buried road swfaccs. As part
of road maintenance, clay is often packed into gullies
to prevent deep erosion along lbe sides of the ditches.
Additionally, buried, concrete-lined culverts were
constrncted to allow drainage from intersected
deprcsslons into the ditches. Along tlic ditch banks
al these culverts and at comers, stone or broken
concrete riprap drapes are used to retard erosion.
Most of the landscape, plant and animal communities, and archeological sites in the Lower Rio
Grande Valley have snffercd some form of recent
disturbance. The scale of impact is tremendous and
the rate of disturbance is increasing. Large areas
in Willacy County, previously unfrumed, arc rapidly
being cleared with bulldozers and put under the plow.

Rio Grande Floodplain and De/Ja
This zone includes the Rio Grande floodplain
and its modern delta. The Rio Grande is the major
source of perellllial water in the Jegion and its
importance cannot be overcs!imated. The topography
of this zone is not marked as the stream gradient
is very low. Scattered throughout the zone arc a
number of oxbow lakes which hold freshwater, and
these provide additional environments that are rich
in resource<. Floodplain plllnt communities are found
along some of the larger resacas, e.g., Arroyo
Colorado, as well. The delta is a dynamic wetlands
caused by small and large distributary chllllllcls that
constantly change course.
The plant communities of the floodplain and
delta are nnique in the region. The floodplain is
U1c best-wooded area, snpporting the great lead-tn;e
(Leucaena pu/vernle11ta), Berlandier ash (Fraxinus
berlandieriana), sugarhackberry (Ce/tis laevigala),
anaqua (Ehretia anacua), ebony apes-earring
(l'ithecetlobium flexicau/e), western soapherry
(Sapindus drummo11dii), ard mesquite (Prosopis
ju/iflora). These trees Conn a tall, 50-ft canopy in
the few undisturbed portions of the floodplain;
beneath this canopy are shrubs such as Barbadoscherry malpighia (Ma/pighia g/abra), vines such as
short-fruited scrjania-vine (Seijania brachycarpa)
and saw grccnbrier (Smilax bona-nox), and herbs
such as climbing plumbago (Plumbago scandens)
and drummond wax-mallow (Malvaviscus
drunimondii). Away from the river, this floodplain
community begins to change to a brnsh community
characterized by mesquite and acacia.
In lbe deltn area, a plant community dominated
by palmetto palm trees, Sabal Iexana, has been
documented (Clover 1937; Johnston 1955). 1bis
palm grove looks like a tropical plant community
but js very limited in extent. Many of tl1e trees found
in the floodplain community also occur in this

of the archeological resources in the Lower Rio
Grande VaHey. The current investigations represent
a responsible effort by Hidalgo and Willacy counties
to deal with the loss of archeological resources along
the Hidalgo-Willacy Drainage Ditch.

Many archeological sites have undergone extensive
disturbance and will continue to do so over the next
few years. Previous botanical work has recorded
the plant commWlities, and efforts are underway now
to preserve and restore these communities; however,
no such effort has been mounted for the preservation

Branch. The Coahuiltecan Branch is characterized
by large surface sites along small streams, stone
rather than shell as manufacturing materials, and
denser site distributions.
Mason (1935) analyzed !he Anderson collection
ceramics from !he Rio Grande Delta and Huastecan
ccranrics from Mexico for his study of Mesoamerican
influences north of tl1e Rio Grande. He suggests
!hat !he ceramics from tl1e delta region resemble
Huastecan ceramics primarily in decoration:

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
A brief summary of the major archeological
work performed in tl1e Rio Grande Delta and in
Zapata and Starr counties is presented here. A more
comprehensive overview of tl1e literature on !he
archeology and ethnography of !he region is provided
in Table 2. The first significant archeological work
accomplished in the Rio Grande Delta was by A.
E. Anderson, a civil engineer in Brownsville, who
made systematic collections from over 350 sites in
Willacy and Cameron counties and northeastern
Tamaulipas, Mexico between 1908 and 1940. His
collections served as tl1e basis of study for later
archeologists attempting to synthesize !he prclristoric
cultures of South Texas (Sayles 1935; Mason 1935;
Jackson 1940; Ekholm 1944; MacNeish 1947, 1958;
Campbell 1960; and Prewitt 1974).
Sayles' (1935) synthesis of the archeology of
far South Texas and adjacent nortl1east Mexico uses
broad linguistic divisions. He identifies sites situated
along tl1e coast as the Brownsville Phase of the
Tamaulipan Branch. These sites exhlbit a specialized
shell industry, occasionally contain Rockport or
Huastecan-like pottery, and are geographically and
culturally distinct from his inland Coahuiltccan

Among !he elements common to both
ancient Huaxtec [sic] and Brownsville
vessels, and to a less extent to modem
Huaxtec [sic] vessels, are parallel straight
lines and bands, scallops, triangles, concentric circles with central dot, and animal
figures [Mason 1935:40].
He notes more similarities in vessel shape between
the Brownsville ollas and the modern native pottery
made in !he Tampico region than with ancient Huastecan vessels (1935:38-40). Mason goes on to say
that
as a result of our comparisons we may
probably conclude with reasonable confidence !hat !he Brownsville vessels were
not made by Huaxtecs [sic] ... but show
Huaxtec [sic] influence to a moderate
degree [1935:40].
Inexplicably, MacNeish (1947:7, 1958:186) states
!hat Mason's report confirms !hat vessels from the

Brownsville sites are Huastecan pots. This
misinlCIJJTI"lalion has WlfOllUllalely been incmporated
into the modem literature.
MacNeish (1947, 1958) further subdivides
Sayles' scheme on the basis of the Anderson collection and his own survey data from the Rio Grunde
Delta and Tamaulipas, Mexico. MacNeish distinguishes the Brownsville Complex, confine<l to the
Texas side of the delta, from an earlier Barri!
Complex, located mostly south of the Rio Grande,
and he provides extensive trait lists for each
(MacNeish 1958). MacNeish also defines the
Abasolo Complex (analogous to Sayles' Corumiltecan
Branch) and the Repclo Complex as predating the
Brownsville Complex in the delta but predominlllltly
occurring inland in northern Tamaulipas.

Suhm et al. (1954) identify two cultural units
in the Falcon Reservior area located on the Rio
Grande in Zapata and Starr counties. They use the
Midwestern Taxonomic System (McKcm 1939) and
identify the Falcon Focus, an Archaic culture, and
the Mier Focus, a late Archaic to Late Prehistoric
culture. Both complexes were believed to represent
long, stable adaptations with little culturnl change.
However, this concept was later changed because
of further work !hat suggested a greater diversity
of cultural adaptations relative to microenvirornnental
situations (Nunley 1971; Nunley and Hester 1975;
Mallouf et al. 1977),
To the northwest of the project area, survey and
limited excavation at sites located along tlie Arroyo

representative of lhc Palcoindian, Archaic, and Late
Prehistoric periods (1'cwton 1968). Newton proposes
a continuum of Lerma, Abaso/o, Tortugas, Pandora,
Refugio, Desmuke, Catan, Matamoros, and Starr
projectile point types based on the moJJJhological
similarities of these types and the lack of a cleor
distinction in the tool types ob>'Crved at the sites.
He concludes that lbe archeology in this region
represents a slowly evolving hunting and gailicring
adaptation witlt two cultural zones identified relative
to two resource areas: campsites near the stream
and foraging locales away from the stream. Additional survey work in Ibis area primarily shows
Archaic sites represented by two distinct adaptive
strategies relative to topogrnpbic zones (Nunley and
Hester 1975: Fox 1979). Sites situated on sueam
terraces (i.e., Gallery sites) reflect the utilization
of terrestrial resources available in the floodplain,
and sites on tl1e uplands above die floodplain (i.e.,
Bower sites) reflect an adaptive slratc!,'Y ba'>Cd on
upland resources (Nunley and Hester 1975). It
should be noted !hat tl1cse intc1prctations are based
primarily on surface collections from terroce areas
and bank exposures and generally lack firm chronological controls.
In a recent synthesis, Hester ( 1981) proposes
two major adaptations in South Texas, savanna and
maritime. Tiie former is identified as an inland
phcnoomenon where cultures inhabited grasslands
and riparian environments widi low--<len•ity resource
areas. These areas support vegetatiooal and founal
communities that are more dispersed and limited
in the diversity and quantity of resources as compared to high-density resource areas which contain
multiple rc,'oUICCS and are located in both the
savanna and coastal zones (Hester 1981:120-124).
Hester's maritime adaptation focuses oo the utilization of marme resources, permitting successful
hllllting and gathering activities to he concentrated
along the coast with limited use of adjacent prairies.
lbe Hidalgo-Willacy eolian sand and loess plains,
located roughly between these two wncs and corresponding to the sand sheet utilized here, arc characterized as widely disperned low-density resource
ureas.
Although Andernon identified tlic general topographic settings in which archeological sites occur
in the delta region (Texas Archcological Research
Laboratory n.d.), it was not uutil Prewitt (1974)
defined five distinct settings where sites are most
frequently located that the relationship between site

location and environment could be analyzed. Later
this was more fully developed and a predictive model
for archcological sites in the project area was
established (Mallouf et al. 1977). This model
allowed surveys to focus more prnctically and
effectively on site dL~covery (Day 1981; Day et
al. 1981; Etchieson and Boyd 1982: McreadoAllinger 1983; Hall et al. 1987; Quigg et al. 1989).
These surveys resulted in lbc discovery of 175 pre-historic andfor historic sites along drainage ditch
alignments in Hidalgo and Willacy counties.
Malloufet al. (1977) identified eolian depressions or playas (occasionally spring related) as the
dominant water sources in lite project area attracting
both wildlife and vegetation, Here loo is where
ardleological sites are typically found, although some
sites occur on adjacent elevated areas, perhaps
intended to take advantage of several playas.
Although there has been an increase in survey
activity within the project area, only a handful of
sites have heretofore received some form of excavation. As a result, cultural chronology, subsistence
strategies, and settlement patterns for lhe area remain
poorly known. Intact buried cultural deposits,
absolute dates, and evidence of economic resources
arc sorely needed. Such infonnation is required
before Ute issues mentioned above can be addressed
completely.
CULTIJRAL CHRONOLOGY

Although a substanual amount of survey work
has been accomplished along lite Hidalgo-Willacy
Drainage Ditch, prior to Utls project only six prehistoric sites had undergone excavations ranging from
suhsmface probes to controlled hand excavations
(41HGI 18, 41WY50, 41WY60, 41WY71, 41WY72,
41WY84, and 41WYll3). Two sites, 41HGll8
and 41WY50, yielded radiocarbon dales, but neither
is associated witl1 diagnostic materials. One radiocarbon dale was obtained from human bones from
41WY50, but Ibis was from the inorganic (apatite)
fraction and apatite dates are often um"Cliablc (see
Appendix DJ. The other radiocarbon date was
oblained from soil humates from 4lHG118, and such
dates are also often unreliable. Attempts to interpret
cultural chronology in the Rio Grande Delta therefore
have relied heavily on comparisons with artifact types
from surrounding areas such as UlC Trans-Pecos and
Lower Pecos, Coastal Bend, Central Texas, and
Norlheastem Mexico, and previous investigations
21

Prehistoric Archeology and Pa/eoenvimnments in Hidalgo and Willacy Cou11ties

have emphasized !hat a cultural--chronological
sequence has yet to be developed for the Rio Grande
Delta (Mallouf et al. 1977:86-88; Day el aL
1981 :14--15; Hall et aL 1987:17). The four periods
defined by Suhm et al. (1954) for Soutl1 Texas
remain the current level of chronological resolution
for the projc<.1 area. These ure Paleoindian, An:haic,
Late Prehistoric, and Historic Cootact and arc
discussed briefly below.
The Paleoindian period is poorly represented
in the Rio Grande Delta and the project area by a
few isolated projectile points (Mallouf et al. 1977).
1llis period is commonly characterized by a depen-dence on the hwiting of Pleistocene mcgaf.awia. More
appropriately, this period may have seen use by
small, mobile bands of nonspecialized hunters lllld
galherers occassionally utilizing mcgafouna perhaps
only as the opportunity arose. The closest known
occurrence of megafaunn to the project area is at
a site a! the mouth of the Rio Grande where A. E.
Anderson recovered a Clovis base (Suhm et al.
1954:121). Here W. A. Price observed mammoth
bones eroding from a clay deposit near the site.
Eleven localities at Falcon Reservoir had mammoth
bones eroding from deposits that could have eontained artifacts (Cason 1952:243, 251). Tlie La
Paloma Mammoth Site in northwestern Kenedy
County is the nearest megafaunal site to the north
of lhe project area; bison antiquus was also recovered at this site (Cason 1<}52). Isolated Paleoindian
projectile points have been found immediately to
the north of the Hidalgo-Willacy Drainage Ditch
in the Norias eolian sand lobe; to tlie west at the
La Pcrdida Site, Falcon Reservoir, and just north
of Rio Grande City; and to the soutlrncar lhc mouth
of !he Rio Grande (Mallouf et al. 1977:167; Weir
1956:59, 65, 71, 72; Newton 1968:21; Suhm et al.
1954: 136). No Poleoindian dart points have been
recovered from archeological sites along tlic drainage
ditch, however, and very little environmental and
cultural data exist for the entire South Texas region
for this period. Borrowing from the Southwest and
Cenlral Texas cultural areas, however, the Palcoindian period is presumed to have ended by 7,000
D.P. (Mallouf et al. 1977:67, Table 2).
The Archaic period is also poorly understood
in the project area. Generally, in Texas tl1is period
signifies n shift to hunting smaller game and to plant
gatl1ering; sites in U1e coastal zone also demonstrate
an emphasis on the exploitation of marine resouices.
Only one Archaic culture, tlte Aransas Focus, has

been defined on the Texas Coast, and it is limited
to Aransas and Corpus Oiristi bays far to the north.
To the west, sites located along the Arroyo Los
Olmos appear to have well-represented Archaic
period deposits (Newton 1968; Nanley and Hester
1975), as do sites at Falcon Reservoir (Suhm et al.
1954), although bollt areas lack clear distinctions
between lite Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods.
Earlier work in the Rio Grande Deha did not provide
evidence lo support a well--defincd Archaic period
in the region (Mallouf et al. 1977), but the presence
of Archaic deposits on the delta "ls indicated primarily by unstemmed triangular thin bifaces, gouges,
and infrequent stemmed dart points" (Hall et al.
1987:18). Recent archeological investigations near
the moulh of the Rio Grllllde have been limited to
surveys and have not yielded prehistoric cultural
materials identifiable as belonging to the Aichaic
period (Espey, Huston and Associates, Inc. 1981).
Within the project area, 16 prehistoric sites have
yielded dart points representative of lite Archaic
period (41HG4,41HG5, 41HG6, 41HG9, 41HG96,
41HGll5, 41HGII8, 41HG125, 41WY7,41WY18,
41WY27, 41 WY39,41WY42,41WY44,41WYI 16,
and 41WY117). Of these, only the Sardinas Resaca
Site (41HG118) had been excavated prior to the
current work and, based on a comparison of artifacls
wilh similar forms from South Texas and northeastern
Mexico, the artifact collection from this site is
representative of !ale An:haic and/or Late Prehistoric
periods (Hall et al. 1<}87:62). A radiocarbon date
from bulksoilhumates associated with undiagnostic
prehistoric cultural materials al 4lHG118 indicates
that the earliest occupation was ca. 3500 B.P. (Hall
et al. 1987:63). Based on this evidence and regional
comparisons (Hester 1981), lhc Archaic period in
the project area ls tentatively placed at 7,000.-5,000
to 800 B.P.
The Late Prehistoric is the best known of the
three prehistoric periods for \he Rio Grande Delta;
it is defined by !he presence of lite bow and arrow
and is marked by the production of small arrow
points beginning around 800 B.P. (Hester 1981:122).
Also generally charactcrL~tic of !his period is !he
emergence of agriculture and pottery, but lhe
evidence indicates that tl1ese practices were never
developed in Soulh Texas. Northward along lhc
Texas coast, !he Rockport Focus ceramic tradition
is attributed to lhc Late Prehistoric and Historic
periods, but it is spatially limited to the area between
Baffin Bay and Matagorda Day.

Chapter 2: Archeological Background

The Brownsville and Bru:ril complexes, identified
as Late Prehistoric cultural adaptations present in
this region, are characterized by a well--Oefined shell
industry. MacNeish (1958:186-193) first described
these two complexes in detail based on his survey
work and the work by Anderson (1932), Mason
(1935), and Sayles (1935). The Brownsville Complex was determined by MacNeish to be Late
Prehistoric based on the presence of IO specimens
of Huastccan-like pottery indicative of tlie Panuco
Period VI recovered from two sites in Cameron
County (MacNeish 1958: 186-189). The Barri!
Complex was believed to slightly predate the
Brownsville Complex and is distinguished by tbe
presence of conical bone and columclla projectile
points, while the Brownsville Complex is uniquely
associated wilh conical pumice pipes (MacNeish
1958). The Brownsville Complex occurs throughout
the Rio Grande Delta while tlte Barri! Complex
appears to be located predominately in northeastern
Tamaulipas, Mexico.
Sites assigned to tbe
Brownsville Complex have been observed mostly
in Cameron County near the coast and along the
Arroyo Colorado.
No Late Prehistoric diagnostic materials have
been recovered from lhc Hidalgo-Willacy Drainage

Ditch routes to date, with the possible exception of
a side-notched projectile point from 41HG126 (Hall
et al. 1987:Fig. 19g). Small triangular bifaces have
not been convincingly associated with the Late
Prehistoric period and may prove to be technologically related to resource locations and transportation
rather tlian being temporal indicators. Previous
surveys, however, have recovered diagnostic arrow
points from six sites (41HG4, 41HG5, 41HG6,
41HG9, 41HG36, and 41HG38) in east-central
Hidalgo County, four sites (41WYl5, 41WY19,
41WY31, and41WY32) smrounding the La Sal Vieja
in western Willacy County, and an isolated find in
central Willacy Coonty (Malloufet al. 1977:172-174,
258-265).
Historic Contact period Indian sites are noted
by the presence of materials of European origin
including such items as metal projectile points, other
metal objects, trade beads, and wheel-made or
glazed ceramics. The nearest known Historic Contact
period sites are southeast and east of lhe project
area where wheel-made or glazed sherds were
recovered from four sites (41CFB and three sites
discovered by Anderson). The last record of aboriginal inhabitants in tbe area was in A.D. 1886 near
Reynosa, Mexico (Salinas 1986:258).

MODELS OF LATE HOLOCENE HUMAN ADAPTATION IN THE
LOWER RIO GRANDE VALLEY

3

by Steve A. Tomka

To maximize U1e interpretive potential of the
meager archeological record of the Lower Rio
Grande Valley, a set of alternative models
reflecting varying hunter-gatherer settlement
mobility patterns is proposed. A series of archeological predictions and implications is provided
which can be compared to the available data base
from the region.
The investigation of human subsistence,
settlement, and mobility strategies, as conditioned
by resource opportunities and limitations, is a
primary objective of archeological investigations
in the Lower Rio Grande Valley. Using Binford's
(1980) forager-collector continuum and viewing
resource structure (Conaty 1987) as the primary
factor conditioning subsistence and settlement
strategies (Kelly 1980, 1983), one goal of archeological work along the Hidalgo-Willacy Drainage
Ditch is the extraction of regional land-use
patterns and the explication of factors that conditioned shifts in land use through time.
Although some changes in regional paleoenvironmental conditions are suggested by the
geomorphic data (see Chapters 5 and 7), these
changes probably were not of sufficient magnitude
to significantly alter the resource structure in the
Lower Rio Grande Valley region, but moredetailed data are needed before this can be
assessed. Because of this presumed stability, it is
accepted that the models presented here will
describe the organizational range of resource
procurement practices for much of the late

Holocene. 11lis position implies that changes in
the land-use pattern of a given region occur only
under major environmental shifts or changes in
other factors that alter tl1e structure of the exploited resources, either in tenns of the spatial or
temporal distribution of the resources or human
access to them (Hayden 1986; Conaty 1987). In
the future when more paleoenvironmental data are
available, it may be possible to tailor models to
reflect environmental changes that would theoretically alter human responses, but until such data
are in hand, the models, by default, must be based
on the modem ecology.
In assessing the interpretive utility of the
models, it is important to bear in mind that individual archeological sites discovered along the
linear project area represent only a fraction of the
settlement system and cannot be interpreted in
isolation. The project area must be considered
within the context of the region as a whole before
the overall land-use strategies can be defined.
With this in mind and for the purposes of model.
building, the project area is more broadly defined
as the area bounded by Starr and Duval counties.
in the south and northwest, Nueces County in the
north, the Rio Grande in the south, and the coast
in the east.

THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
This section consists of six parts. The first
provides an explanation of how forager and

collector strategies differ; the second intei,orates
some ideas based on optimal foraging theory; the
third describes the resource structure of the prcject
area; the fourth summarizes ethnohistoric data on
resource use; the fifth presents lhree possible
models of resource und territorial nse of the
region; and the final section presents U1e artifact
predictions under each of the three models.

factors generating different mobility patterns is
crucial in explaining the driving forces of prehistoric settlemenf/snbsistence patterns and developing more precise expectations and testable
hypotheses for future archeological work. Furthermore, the forager-collector continuum is
particularly useful for predicting the expected
·relationships between resource acquisition and
mobility strategies, site function, assemblage
composition, occupation length, group size, and
regional settlement/subsistence patterns.
The following describes the relationship
between environmental and climatological factors,
resource structure, resource accessibility, and
expected resource acquisition patterns.
Tiris
discussion provides the theoretical basis of the
models of resource and land-use patterns outlined
for the project area below.
Binford (1980) argues that the structural
properties of the environment and resources can be
described by the annual mean and seasonal distribution of solar radiation. Tiiis is known as effective temperature or ET (Bailey 1960). The lower
the ET, the more seasonal the environment ood the
shorter the growing season. The higher U1e ET,
the less season.al the environment and the longer
the growing season.
As climatic severity
increases or as die length of Ute growing season
decreases, the number of available resources
usually decrenses and the spatial and temporal
incongruence between them tends to increase.
Binford (1980) intel]lrets this incongruence as the
catalyst conditioning the manner in which resources arc acquired.
Collectors use logislical strategies to resolve
spatial or temporal conllicts in availability among
critical resources (Binford 1980:15). Critical
resources that are reslrictcd in space and time are
acquired by logistical task groups. The exlreme
lack of resources during the winter in temperate
and colder environments is solved through
increased seasonal sedentism and increased storage dependence (Goland 1983). Binford (1980)
finds a relatively good cooeordance among 31
ethnographic cases between dependence on storage
aod decreasing ET. Only groups with an ET
below 15' C practice significant levels of storage.
Stornge dependence seems to increase in environments with growing seasons of less than 200 days.
In conlrasl, tropical rain forest groups maintain a
high degree of mobility in response to evenly

The J<'orager-Collector Dichotomy

Recent works by Binford .(]980), Kelly
(1980, 1983), and Hayden (1986, 1987) illuslrate
how resource acquisition among ethnographic
groups can be categorized in broad terms ns either
forager- or collector-oriented. Foragers tend kl
move the consumers to the resources wherever
they may be found in space or through lime.
Storage plays a minor role in foraging economies
because few resources are available in large
enough quantities to permit bulk acquisition and
processing for lean-period consumption. Also,
most forager groups live in areas where sufficient
resources are available during these lean seasons
to support the group. On the other hand, collectors
move resources to the consumers through the
employment of task groups to exploit resources
occurring in bulk. The quantities obtained are
sufficient to permit storage for delayed consumption. In regions inhabited by collectors today, the
scarcity of lean-season resources is so marked
that storage is necessary. Storage extends the
availability of a resource into resource-scarce
seasons.
The majority of the extensively studied
ethnographic gronps are foragers, while a few are
collectors. Furthermore, some groups are foragers
during a part of their annual cycle and collectors
during the remainder.
The forager-collector
dichotomy characterizes resource acquisition
patterns at the two exlremes of a continuum and in
environmentally exlreme settings (e.g., tundra
versus lropical rain forest). Realizing that most
land-use patterns need to accommodate seasonal
or longer-tenn shifts in the resource base and that
resource acquisition patterns may vary through the
annual cycle from forager- kl collector-oriented,
what is the utility of viewing land-use patterns in
terms of this dichotomy? The answer lies partly
in the factors that condition resource acquisition
modes.
Understanding the underlying causal

26

Chapter 3: Models of Late Holocene Human Adaptation in the Lower Rio Grande Valley

distributed resources. Foraging for food is done
oo an encounter basis, and the eJthaustion of
resources within the foraging radius is followed by
relatively short--{]istance residential moves into the
center of a new foraging area.
Binford's characterization of resource acquisition patterns in terms of ET values is useful in
that it demonstrates tl1e tendency for high ET
environments to be exploited within a forager
system aod low ET environments to be exploited
in a collector mode. It also suggests that in warm
temperate zones characterized by · median ET
values, the resource acquisition patterns may be a
complex mix. of collecting and foraging strategies
which may vary seasonally.
Hayden (1986, 1987) addresses the factors
that generate logistically organized systems in
temperate climates. He concurs that, in general,
in temperate areas a foraging strategy is adaptive
to evenly distributed, scarce, and unpredictable
resources and generates a highly nomadic land-use
pattern. However, in some temperate climates,
once effective means were developed for the
exploitation of small body si1.ed, rapidly reproducing (i.e., r-selected) resources such as grass
seeds, acorns, and rabbits, their utilization may
have been conducted under logistical strategies.
While there is a strong technological component to
this argument, the aspect tl1at is significant for the
purposes of this discussion is the character of the
resource base. Hayden (1986:86) suggests that the
reliability, richness, and seasonal nature of the
resources are the critical aspects conditioning the
mode of resource use. Conaty (1987:60), based
on analogies with predator--{)ptimal foraging
strategies (Hom 1968), sees availability and
distribution (evenly distributed and stable versus
highly clumped and transient) rather than density
of tl1e prey as the critical variables. Foraging
strategies appear to correlate with the exploitation
of evenly distributed and relatively stable resources. Collecting strategies appear to be more
commonly employed in the exploitation of
clumped and transient resources.
Heffley
(1981: 133) suggests the following classifications
of resources as important determinants of settlement patlems: (1) evenly spaced and stable; (2)
mobile, clumped, and unpredictable; and (3)
clumped and predictable. Evenly spaced and
stable resources appear to be exploited by small
groups under a dispersed, relatively mobile settle-

ment pattern (i.e., foragers). Mobile, clumped,
and unpredictable resources are often exploited in
bulk by larger mobile groups, but the larger return
for the energy invested generates storable surplus
which permits some degree of seasonlll sedentism
(i.e., collectors). The highest degree of sedentism
is found in the context of clumped and predictable
resource exploitations (e.g., salmon runs by
Northwest Const groups). Seasonal variations in
the mobility and patchiness of the resource base
can stimulate a shift in mobility strategies by
hunter-gatherers within a single year's cycle.
Groups such as the Tanana (Heffley 1981: 140142), that exploit mobile, clumped, and unpredictable resources for short periods in the spring,
summer, and fall and evenly spaced stable
resources tlrroughoul the remainder of the yellf,
practice a seasonally varying mix of logistical
(colleclor) and residential (forager) mobility.
One approach that characterizes resource
acquisition modes in terms of resource structure,
primary and secondary production, ard biomass
accessibility, is provided by Kelly (1980, 1983).
Because it uses broad measures of resource
availability rather than focusing on a limited set of
arbitrarily chosen environmental attributes, it
offers a theoretically robnst explanation to account
for global differences in resource acquisition.
Different effective temperature regimes and
rainfall amounts produce environmenL' differing in
primary production and primary biomass. It is the
primary production and primary biomass that aid
in defining the struchrre and accessibility of
resources in a given environment. Primary production refers ID the amount of energy in vegetation remaining from the process of photosynthesis
after respiration. Primary biomass is the total
amount of standing plant mass present in a region
at a particular point in time. A third important
element, serondary biomass, represents the amount
of fauna! mass present in a region at a giveu point
in time. Environments with relatively high ETs
have high primary and secondary biomass settings
(e.g., tropical forests). As ET decreases, the
primary and secondary biomass of the environment
also decrease.
Primary biomass is shown by Kelly (1980) to
be inversely related to the accessibility of plant
and fauna! resources, however. While tropical
forests have extremely high primary biomass, the
re.1ources are largely inaccessible to human

27

Prehistoric Archeology and Pa/eoenvironmenls in Hidalgo and Willacy Coanties

as measures of cost and benefit in optimal foraging models. In view of these currencies, a resource item is expected ta be included or excluded
from the diet based on: (I) its rank in energy
gained per unit of handling time relative to other
resources; and (2) the abundance of hlgher-rnnked
resoiuces, or their encounter rate (O'Connell and
Hawkes 1981: 108). Handling time consists of the
time nsed in the search, pursuit, and processing of
a given resource. Search time refers to the time
needed to locate a resource; pursuit time is the
time needed to capture it; and processing time is
the time needed to make the resource edible.
Pursuit time is reduced in the case of stationary
resources (e.g., acorn harvesting). In the case of
mobile resources, search time is e;<pected to
decrease as resource density increases because of
the associated increase in encounter probability.
With increased resource mobility and/or decreased
re.•ource density, search time increases. The
search time for mobile prey that move in predictable patterns is expected to be less than for prey
that move in random patterns. Predictability tends
to increase specialization in individual patch use
by reducing visit.s to unfavorable patches (DysonHudson and Smith 1978:25-26; Smith 1981:4249; Winterhalder 1981:28-32). Predictability also
allows a high degree of acquisition scheduling.
It is unclear, at present, whether for human
foragers the costs of tool manufacture and maintenance should be considered in the overall costs of
exploiting different resources (Shott 1989).
Nevertl1eless, it is expected that in raw-materialpoor ureas and under resource acquisition modes
with high rates of tool failure (e.g., projectile point
failure during hunting), tool replacement cost.s may
significantly increase the acquisition cost.s for
particular resources.
The model indicates that us the encounter
rate for higher-ranked resources goes up, lowerranked resources are eliminated from the diet and
vice versa, regardless of the absolute abundance of
lower-ranked resources.
This suggests thnt
foragers might react quite differently to the same
re.•ource depending on the c.haracteristics of other
resources available in a given situation. That is,
the structure of the resource, it.s composition,
relative density, and spatial distribution relative to
foraging populations condition the particular
resource items included or excluded from the diet.

consumers. On the other hand, cnvironment.s with
low ETs, such as the tundra, have much lower but
highly accessible secondary biomass. Holding ET
constant, the body size of the fauna decreases and
the individuals become more dispersed and less
accessible as primary biomass increases (e.g. in
tropical and subtropical settings). Holding primary biomass constant, as ET decreases the fauna
decreases in density but individuals ure often of
larger body size, more gregarious, and more
accessible (e.g., in the Great Plains and tundra
settings). The implication i• that high primary
biomass environments with small, dispersed,
secondary biomasses are exploited by residentially
mobile foragers, while low biomass environments
with large-bodied, gregarious fauna are exploited
by logistically organized, semisedentary or fully
sedentary collectors,
Optimal Foraging Expectations
One aspect of resource procurement that is
not e;<plained directly by these broad models is
the actual mix of resources utili7.cd by prehistoric
groups given the regional resource structures
outlined above. At present, the detailed botanical
and fauna! information needed to develop rigorous
and quantified expectations regarding the resources
utilized docs not exist. Based on the extensive
literature on hunter-gatherer foraging strategies
(Pyke et al. 1977; Keene 1979; Winterhalder and
Smith 1981; Jochim 1983), however, some broad
expectations can be presented regarding the range
and uti;< of resources utilized and, by implication,
the seasons of use and overall mobility strategies.
These expectations will, in turn, structure the
archeological predictions outlined later in this
chapter.
The optimal diet model predicts that in a
pate.II where resources are encountered nt random
in proportion to their abundl!nce, n predator will
take a resource item only if the returns from
obtaining and processing it are greater than those
gained from searching for and processing another
resource item. The model predicts that if the
return from the item at hand is less than the
alternate choice, then the item will be ignored and
the predator will continue searching for higherranked resources (MacArthur and Pianka 1966;
Charnov 1976). Time and energy are often used

Regional Resource Strncture

1937:80). Complex microniches occur in lhe
extensive areas of Holocene meander segments
and oxbow lakes. The deficient rainfall amounts
in the region preclude the development of freshwater marshes in Uie cutoffs and channel segments
except during wet cycles (Brown el al. 1980:54).
However, they retain slightly more moisture than
the surrounding areas and form microenvironments
inhabited by a variety of moisture-loving species
(Clover 1937:49-50).
The disruption of successional stages due to
anthropogenic factors also contributes to a highly
dynamic setting. Revegetation after overgrazing
results in an increase not only in brush cover but
also in species diversity (Johnston 1955:80).
Mesquite (Prosopis sp.) is the first woody brush
species to become established followed by olher
brush genera such os opuntia and yucca (Clover
1937:54,80; Johnston 1955:74). While the various
cacti are thought to be primarily invaders, Clover
(1937:84) indicates Iha! more species are found in
the western portion of the project area. Alternatively, this relationship could be due to eilher the
correlation of the speeies with calcareous soil
types or the general reduction in rainfall toward
the west. Yucca constricta is rather aliundant
northeast of San Ygnacio in western Zapata
OJunty, occurring in large and dense patches in
open grassy areas (Clover 1937:53), and this
distribution could be due to human interferences
and overgrazing. While lhe overgrazing discussed
by Johnston (1955) was caused by cattle, some
instances of prehistoric overgrazing (e.g., by local
fauna! population explosions) may have occurred
and generated similar vegetational compositions.
The movement of active dunes in the sand sheet
may also generate successional stages mimicking
those seen as a result of overgrazing.
The vegetational and fauna! diversity o[ the
environmental zones ensures that some resources
will be available for human exploitation at any
Lime in lhese settings. However, the distributional
predictability of Ille resources is reduced in some
patches (e.g., active sand sheets). A higher degree
of resource predictability may be afforded by
stabilized dunes; although early formation stages
may be less predictable, lhey offer an increased
variety of potentially useful resources (e.g.,
Atrip/ex, Amaranthus, and Chenopodium).
Two climax communities are noted in Ille

estimate of resource structure in order to aid
comparability with Binford's (1980) and Kelly's
(1980, 1983) work. A calculation of the ET for
Willacy County results in a figure of 16.8° C, wilh
the average arutual precipitation being 27.5 inches.
This ET value falls into Binford's semilropical

327 days in Hidalgo County and 331 days in
Willacy County (Natural Fibers Information

in which elhnographic groups are characterized by
low dependence on storage (Binford 1980:16).
Analyses of global patterns o[ primary
production indicate that, in general, semitropical
and tropical environments have relaLively high
levels of primary production and primary biomass
(Rosenzweig 1968:69; Whittaker and Likens
1975:306; Kel!y 1983:284). Kelly (1983:284)
indicates lhat under conditions o[ high primary
production, primary and secondary biomass are
also high. On lhe other hand, the accessibility of
the primary production lo humans and herbivores
is relatively low.
The project area and die broader region are
composed of five enviromnental wnes (see Chapter 1). These five woes crosscut geologic and
vegetational-community boundaries and represent
relatively homogeneous resource areas. In gen-.
era!, primary production is considered to be high
along the Rio Grande but less so away from the
river. Because of climatological and geomorphic
circumstances, however, the environmental wnes
are seen as being highly dynamic and consistently
changing resource settings. For instance, lhe
different stages of sand dune formation, stabilization, erosion, and migration generate a variety of
microniches with associated vegctal and fauna!
variability. Similarly, hurricanes and storms keep
the vegetation of lhe salt flats, mmshes, and low
islands in stages of progressive and retrogressive
succession (Clover 1937:78). For example, Yucca
treculeana forests once grew nem Boca Chica and
Port Isabel at the mouth of the Rio Grande but
were wiped out by the 1933 hurricane (Clover

woodlands. Both of these communities offer a
relatively high degree of spatial and compositional
predictability. Live oak moues (Querqus virginiana), which form oo stabilized dunes, are
distributed in Brooks, Hidalgo, Willacy, and
KeMedy counties and the coastal strip of Kleberg
and Nueces counties (Johnston 1955:89). According to Clover (1937:84), the most luxurious vegetation community, riparian woodlands, formerly
occurred in the alluvial soils of the Rio Grande
floodplain eastward from Penitas near the
Hidalgo/Starr connty line. Due to the increase in
moisture toward the coast, vegetalion tends to
increase in size and in number of species. Also,
plants with tropical affiuities are more abundant in
the area adjacent to Brownsville (Clover 1937:84).
The wooded communities Seldom grew more than
half a mile from the river due to decreasingly
available moisture. Similar woodlnnds may have
formerly occurred along some of the resacas in
southern Cameron County (Johnston 1955:123).
Another major plant resource was Agave
lechuguif/a, .but it is restricted to patches in the far
west in Zapata and Starr counties (Clover
1937:64).
The assumption is made here that the environmental changes that occurred during the late
Holocene were not so great that the "resource
slructure" (sen,m Conaty 1987) changed dramatically.
More importantly, the changes that
occurred were not great enough to force resource
procurement patterns to move from a foraging
system to a logistically organized pattern. Environmental changes almost certainly did occur, but
these changes were oot as significant as those
thought to have occurred at the end of the Pleistocene or during the middle Holocene. For example, the stable isotope analysis in Omptcr 6
suggests that botanic changes did occur but more
details are required before these chnnges con be
incorporated into model formulations. Jn addition,
some indications exist that the coast may have
seen some chnnges. For instance, Hester (1980)
presents convincing evidence for an increase in the
salinity level of Baffin Bay and Laguna Madre
since ca. 4000 B .P. This hypersalinity changed
the species composition and reduced the overall
availability of local shellfish populatioos. However, seasonal decreases in the salinity of Laguna
Madre caused by variations in rainfall (Brown et
al. l 980) suggest that there may have been a

more-pronounced seasonal shift in the availability
of certain species rather than an overall decrease
in. mollusca. Similar patterns of availability
probably occurred among fish species. Nevertheless, with the exception of early historic period
land-clearing impacts, the vegetational communities described above and in Chapter 1 are viewed
as having characterized the region throughout the
late Holocene for the pwposc of developing this
model of hunter~gatherer exploitation. · Until
more-<letailed data on palcoenvironmental changes
come to light, the assumption of late Holocene
paleoenvironmental stability, at least for purposes
of model building and developing model expectations, is necessary.
In sum, the larger project area is viewed as
a median primary biomass biome characterized by
a secoodary biomass composed of small to
medium herbivores, relatively high species diversity, and dispersed fauna! distribution patterns.
Combining resource structure with the relatively
high ET and relying upon the expectations derived
from Biuford (1980), Heffley (1981), and Kelly
(1983),resource acquisition in the project area nnd
the adjacent region should be characterized by a
foraging system.
Ethnohistoric Re.source Exploitation Patterns
The analysis of regional ethnohistoric
accounts offers a view of the settlement and subsistence patterns used by native groups inhabiting
the project area and its vicWty during the early
historic period. The reader is referred to the extensive etlmohistoric literature reviews found in
Rueeking (1953), Salinas (1986, 1990), and
Campbell (1988) for detailed descriptioos of
Native American social organization, customs,
movements, and trade patterns in Soutli Texas in
general, and the Lower Rio Grande Valley in
particular. Rather than reciting generalities in
these studies, a more selective and judicious use
of these accounts is appropriate for the specific
purposes of this analysis, namely the review of
information relating to settlement patterns and
subsistence practices. A reconstruction of these
patterns and practices can provide, in turn, an
initial assessment of how well the theoretical formulations fit the actual ethnogrnphic observations.
The Coahuiltecan settlement pattern has been
characterized as seminomaclic with camps moving

every two or three days (Ruecking 1953, 1955).
Ruecking (1953:489) no!es that the areas surrounding the camps were never completely exploited permitting the continued exploitation of resources even after the camps were moved to other
locales. Settlements varied in size but most were
small (Campbell 1988:51). During seasons that
allowed some degree of group aggregation, maximum group size did not exceed 150-200 individuals, i.e., approximately 40 houses (Campbell
1988:18, 51). Although no minimum group sizes
are given in the etlmohistoric sources, tl1ey probably consisted of only extended families (e.g.,
maximum of 8-!0 individuals) (Campbell
1988:51). The movement of groups was cyclical
and probably coincided with the ripening of
various plant foods. Because of the generally low
productivity of the area, the majority of the
daylight hours were spent foraging (Campbell
1988:20; Salinas 1986:94). Apparently some
resource processing and consumption activities
occurred in the field while others took place in
camp. During the winter and in low-density
resource patches (e.g., agave collecting), foraging
trips may have extended as far as five to eight
miles from the camps (Campbell 1988:20). Winter food shortages occurred frequently (Campbell
1988:17).
All animals encountered in the environment
were hunted, but lhe principal animal foods were

appears to have been utilized by some groups
during early autumn (Campbell 1988:26, 29).
A seasonal dichotomy is evident in resource
use. Prickly pear was the primary ptant food in
the summer (late May through late August) while
various roots (e.g., agave) served as staples during
the winter months (Campbell 1988:20). Plants
with edible roots were tlunly distributed relative to
prickly pear (Campbell 1988:20). Groups north of
the project area (e.g., in the lower Guadalupe
River valley) substituted various nuts (pecans and
walnuts) for roots in the fall. During lhe period
leading up to and following the prickly pear
season, groups relied on a broad range of sparsely
occurring plant foods (Campbell 1988:29). Althoogh Cabeza de Vaca's reports of large prickly
pear patches refer to lhe area encompassed by Jim
Wells, Duval, Kleberg, and Nueces counties
[Campbell 1988: II), even larger prickly pear
patches are reported in the early twentieU1 century
by Davenport and Wells (1918-1919: 209-211) in
Willacy, Hidalgo, and Cameron counties. If lhese
patches existed in prehistoric times as well, it is
likely that their utilization would have been
largely similar to tlrnt noted among groups living
in the lower Guadalupe River valley. Food
storage was minimal. Prickly pear, mesquite, and
agave were stored, but supplies lasted only short
periods. Fish were dried (Salinas 1986:216) and
stored by delfaic groups.
Most ethnohistoric sources suggest high
aboriginal population densities along the Rio
Grande floodplain and delta and north of Baffin
Bay. It appears that the area between Baffin Bay
and the Rio Grande was sparsely occupied during
the mid eighteenth century. Some etlmohistoric
groups are mentioned in northern Hidalgo and
Willacy counties, and their presence seems to be
correlated with salt exploitation at La Sal Vieja
and El Sal de! Rey. Ruecking (1955:36-38)
associates the Lower Rio Grande Valley with the
Carrizo cluster of Coahuiltecan hunter-gatherers.
He names and shows the location of 51 groups
distributed along the Rio Grande Valley and Delta
extending south to the Rio San Fernando, west to
the lower reaches of Rio Alamo, and north into
modem Willacy County. He notes, however, that
the range of the Carrizo groups may include the
entire area between the mouth of the Nueces River
and Rio San Fernando. It is unclear if this range
is an annual resource procurement range or if it

deer, peccary, rats, mice, snakes. snails) and
unspecified birds including waterfowl (Salinas
1986:213). Communal deer hunts were organized
by some groups but only in association with ceremonial or other large group galherings (Ruccking
1953:485; Campbell 1988:19). Various species of
fish were the main source of food for Indians of
the Rio Grande Delta. Fishing was done with bow
and arrow and yucca fiber nets. In some parts of
the region, fishing may have played a more important role during the winter months when plant
resources were scarce. It is unclear whether this
degree of seasonality also applied to groups in the
Rio Grande Delta or only to groups located farther
inland. Gathered foods included prickly pear,
mesquite, agave, garlic, onion, palm, unspecified
roots, fruits, and herbs (Salinas 1986:218). Pecans
and walnuts were consumed but primarily by
groups nortl1 of the project area in the lower
Guadalupe River valley (Campbell 1988:20).

represents lhe broad distribution of bands lhat
were lumped into lhe Canizo cluster. Table 3
gives lhe name and approximate location of some
of the brnids most frequently described in ethnohistoric accounts as Jiving in lhe vicinity of the
project area (Salinas 1986:54-71; 89-93; 123132).
It is evident from lhe above summary that the
ethnohistoric groups utilizing the region were
highly mobile and had a subsistence pattern lhat
included a broad range of resoorces with some
degree of seasonal procorement. A. large number
of animal species were exploited witl1 some focus
on fish in lhe Rio Grande delta and deer in inland
river valley settings. Group sizes were small,
mobility was extremely high, and storage was
limited. A judicious use of lhe optimal foraging
model would require detailed calculations of
energy yield and handling cost for each of the
potential resoorces wilhin the general project area
and the subsequent ranking of lhese resource items
based on these measures. Such data are oot
available at present. In general, however, it is
evident that the patterns summarized above follow
optimal foraging expectations.
Even though
handling costs appear to be relatively high for
prickly pear and especially mesquite beans
(Castetter and Underhill 1935; Castetter and Opler
1936; Bell and Castetter 1937), ethnohistorically
they were the highest ranked plant resoorces
during lhe summer. Because they occurred in
dense patches, lheir exploitation resulted in higher
yields per foraging trip. The intense utilization of
many or all parts of a resooree may extend its
availability and offer sufficient gains to warrant
lhe higher short-term handling costs. Prickly pear
pads, tunas, and even the tlour made of lhe seeds
were coosumed bolh fresh and in sun-dried form.
Mesquite beans were also consnmed bolh fresh or
dried and ground into flour by some groups
(Campbell 1988:37). Root crops were coosumed
during the winter, and although relatively expensive in terms of handling costs, lhey apPear to
have been the most highly ranked resources during
an otherwise low plant yield season. The increased reliance upon fish during winter also may
have been a response to lhe higher density and
yield of these resoorces during a season when
other high-yield resources were not available
(e.g., prickly pear).
Unfortunately, the ethnohistoric sources

provide no information about individual group
territories and access to resources. It is probable
that under low regional population densities,
hunter-gatherer groups ranged overrelatively large
areas and had unrestricted access to resoorces.
Such a situation may best apply to lhe Archaic
and early Late Prehistoric period oocupations of
the area. With increased regional population
densities, however, it is probable that some
circumscription and reduced resource access may
have occurred. The nonterritorial pattern may
have shifted to small bands occupying adjacent but
relatively well deCiaed territories. Given lhe
types, amoonts, 1llld structure of the resources, a
highly mobile foraging system still should have
characterized resource acquisition in each territory.
The territorial pattern may have characterized land
use during lhe later part of the Late Prehistoric
period.
HUMAN AJJAPTATION D{jRJNG

THE LATE HOLOCENE
The theoretical foondation defined above
argues that mobility is a result of resource scarcity
and low yield. However, three relatively productive patches are present within the project area:
the coastal estuaries in Cameron and Willacy
counties, the lower Rio Grande floodplain and
delta, and the stabilized sand sheet in extreme
northern Willacy and Hidalgo counties and
Kennedy County. It is likely lhat resource utilization patlem> varied in the three patches in
response to the overall demity and dependability
of resources. This may have permitled increased
sensonal sedentism with increased territory definition in the Rio Gr1lllde floodplain 8lld delta, or,
allematively, in highly productive portions of the
coast and stabilized sand dunes. In addition, the
development of defined territories occupied primarily by localized bands may have favored the
development of regional exchange networks in
bolh edible and nonedible resources as a riskreducing strategy (Wiessner 1977, 1982).
OC importance also are salt sources located
at La Sal Vieja and El Sal del Rey, the exploitation of which may have had a .significant effect
upon regional mobility patterns. However, it is
probable that the systematic exploitation and
regional exchange or eXJ]ortation of salt may have
played a greater role during the Spanish colonial

resources in tlie distribution of band territories.
The group occupying the delta and coastal stretch
(Group C) would have had access to both of these
high-yield environmental zrnes. The movement of
this group during the annual foraging round would
have paralleled the coast and would have focused
on the exploitation of marine and estuarine
resoun:es with some access to the sand sheet and
delta/floodplain resources to the north and south,
respectively. No direct access to upland plain
resources is presumed. The bands located on the
interior lowland and upland plains (Groups B and
A) would have had annual north-south-oriented
foraging patterns extending from the Rio Grande
floodplain across the interior plain to the sand
sheet. Intergroup exchange between bands occupying the three broad environmental zones would
have heen minimal. However. am:ss to products
from adjacent environmental zones hy bands
occupying territories at the zone boundaries would
have encouraged interregional exchange networks,
Model III (Fig. 13d) assumes band territories
oriented peI]Jendicular to the coast and paralleling
the Rio Grande Valley. This model focuses on the
importance of coastal resources and their equal
distribution among territorial bands. 111c band
located adjacent to tl1e delta (Group A) would have
had access to a disproportionate amow1t of dellaic
and riverine resources while bands occupying
territories located farther lo the north (Groups B
and C) would have inhabited water-scarce zones.
The annual band foraging territories would have
encompassed the shore and coastal estuaries

presence in the region. The occurrence of precolonial archeological sites on the margins of
these lakes may indicate the utilization of a broad
range of aquatic and terrestrial resources attracted
to such bodies of water rather than the systematic
exploitation of salt.
Overview of the Models
Keeping in mind the spatial distribution of
the relatively more productive resoorce patches
(coastal estuaries, floodplain/delta, and stabilized
sand sheet) and the Ullderlying assumption that
within the territory of each band, resource acquisition patterns were organized on a foraging basis,
three models are proposed for the project area
(Fig. 13), These models grew out of initial
formulations by Hester (1981), which were altered
later by Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (1986),
Model l (Fig, l3b) assumes a single territory
occupied by a single group (A) with a low population density, The lack of territorial boundaries
implies unobstructed access to all high- and lowyield resource patches and nonedible resources
(e.g., lithic raw materials), Seasonal resideutial
moves, while not random, would have been conditioned by patch location, resource productivity,
and rank.
Model II (Fig. !Jc) assumes the existence of
linear band territories oriented pcI]Jendicular to the
Rio Grande and paralleling 01e coast. This
implies equal access of all bands to riverine
environments (i.e., the Rio Grande floodplain). It
emphasizes the importance of riverine and water

and the inland envirorunental zones. Intergroup
exchange networks may have developed and
operated in a south to north direction, particularly
between groups occupying territories aloug the Rio
Grande floodplain and thme lacking access to

groups moved out to exploit less productive
resources {e.g., lowland active dune fields, blowouts, channel remnants, and upland-plain yuccn
and agave patcl1es), residential groups are expected to have fissioned into smllller nuclear or
extended family foraging units. In these less
productive zones, it is expected that residential
base camps would have beeu smaller in size and
occupied for shorter periods because resources
may have been more rapidly exhausted within the
foraging radius of a camp (Kelly 1983). Group
aggregation and fissioning may have had a seasonal character reflecting Iluctuations in resource
availability.
Given the relatively short-term occupation of
prehistoric forager residential base camps and Ute
limited need for bulk-resource processing, it is
expected Utat features and facilities would have
been few and functionally nonspecific, generating
a poorly defined site structure (Binford 1980).
Residential base camps located in or adjacent to
highly productive resources may have contained
processing features or facilities {such as fish
drying racks). These features should have been
located marginal to frequently used site areas.
Artifact assemblages would have contained generalized tool kits reflecting the broad range, low
quantities, and generali7A:d resource-processing
tectmiques employed by foraging groups (Hayden
1986), Variability in assemblage size and composition may reflect differences in the sizes of Ute
occupying units and/or le11gths of occupation, as
opposed to functional differences between residential base camps (Yellen 1977).
While Ute
increased number of site types utilized by collectors increases the likelihood of lithic reduction
activities occruring at sites other than base camps,
under a foraging system a broad range of lithic
manufacturing activities {e.g., manufacture,
resharpening, rejuvenation, and discard) should be
represented at residential base camps.
Fauna! and botanical remains should reflect
the broad range of resources exploited. Botanical
remains may be relatively good indicators of
season of occupation as base camps were positioned across the landscape to take advantage of
different resource harvesting schedules (e.g.,
prickly pear and mesquite in summer, root crops
and fish in winter). Small fauna such as mice,
snalces, and insects, coupled with age-structure
data on medium-sized mammals such as antelope
and deer, may provide similar information.

riverine resources. Exchange of coastal resources
with groups having no access to Ute coast is
expected to have ocGUITed at the extreme western
edge of the project area in the upland plain (e.g.,
Starr County).
In each model, the Rio Grande was used as
a social boundary because Ute .distribution of
prehistoric artifacts known from north and south of
the river has been used to suggest that the Rio
Grande acted as such a boundary in the past (Day
et al. 1981:47). This pattern appears to be supported by the fact that among modem huntergatherers, streams and channels often are used to
form boundaries between neighboring huntergatherers (Yelle11 1977:39). In addition, archeological analyses have demonstrated that stream
channels and/or other landmarks often appear to
correspond with prehistoric territorial boundaries
among groups utilizing a hunter-gatherer form of
subsistence (Schiffer 1975:!05-!06; Sampson
1988).
Instead of developing specific land-use
expectations for each of Ute three models, a
general description of foraging patterns is presented. These patterns describe broad resource
acquisition patterns for Model I and within each
band territory under either Model II or III. Furthermore, it is assumed that band territorial
boundaries would have given rise to resource
exchange networks and would have impacted
intraterritory resource acquisition patterns to a
lesser degree.
Only residential base camps and locations
(Binford 1980) should occur under a foraging
system. Base camps would have been moved
often and over short distances (Kelly 1983). The
number and distance of moves should have been
conditioned by the productivity of Ute resonrce
patch and the size of the foraging unit (Kelly
1983). On a regional level, some differences may
be expected in residential base camp size. Highyield resonrce patches (e.g., prickly pear patches,
stabilized sand sheet oak mottes, floodplain, delta,
and coastal estuaries) may have permitted some
degree of seasonal group aggregation resulting in
longer occupations by larger groups. Once highly
productive patches were exhausted and foraging

'!

Locations as defined by Binford (1980) are
different from residential base camps in that they
represent specialized loci of resource procurement
and processing. Locations generated by foragers
should have been small and would be archeologically less visible due to low-bulk resource procurement and processing activities. Visibility may
increase if a high degree of locational redundancy
characterized foraging activities, for example at
prickly pear patches, oak mattes in stabilized sand
dunes, and water sources. Few features and facilities would have been constructed due to low-bulk
resource extraction and short-term site use. Most
processing activities are expected to have occurred
at residential base camps with the exception of
some related to prickly pear processing (Castetter
and Underhill 1935:23; Kroeber 1935:50-51).
Facilities and features (e.g., hearths) related to the
processing of small quantities of food consumed
on daily foraging trips should have low archeological visibility. Site structure would have been
minimally developed due to U1e lack of maintenance activities on such short-term sites. Tool
kits would have remained relatively generalized
reflecting the overall make-up of subsistence
activities. Artifact assemblages may have been
composed primarily of expedient tools and/or
tools discarded because of high transportation
costs (e.g., hammerstones, anvils, and choppers).
Tool maintenance and rejuvenation debris should
not occur or should be low in frequency at locations, while debitage from expedient tool manufacture may be found in high frequencies. This
relationship between rejuvenation and resharpening
versus manufacture debitage may have been
altered depending on raw material densities in the
region. Fauna! and botanical remains will be
relatively scarce due to low-bulk resource procurement and processing. Locations within foraging systems should have been characterized by a
low degree of resource specificity. That is, a
relatively broad range of resources would have
been exploited from foraging locations resulting in
scarce but highly variable fauna! and botanical
samples.

may be used to investigate land-use patterns.
Furthermore, the procurement of both lithic raw
materials and subsistence resources is subject to
the same kinds of constraints. Given that the
parameters of the tllfee models affect both subsistence activities and resource procurement patterns,
it is assumed that an analysis of lithic asssemblages can serve as a test of the best fit between
the models and tl1e archeological data. Such a test
is presented in Chapter 7, using twelve attributes:
(1) frequency of early reduction debitage; (2) frequency of large debitage; (3) total debitage frequency; (4) core frequency; (5) frequency of
resharpening flakes; (6) frequency of manufacture
failures; (7) frequency of exhausted tools; (8)
frequency of use-broken tools; (9) frequency of
reused tools; (I 0) frequency of edge-modified
debitage; (11) average number of working edges
per uniface; and (12) average number of utilized
edges per edge-modified flake.
Because these attributes are highly sensitive
to differences in distance from raw material
source and site use-intensity, they are well suited
to test the three models. Five factors affect the
spatial distribution and frequency of these attributes: (I) the distributions of raw materials in the
project area; (2) the distances of sites from raw
material sources; (3) the degree of decortication
and the form of the raw materials transported
outside of lithic source areas; (3) the enviromnental zone use-intensity; and (5) the presence and
positioning of band territories with respect to raw
material sources and environmental zones.
At present, lithic outcrops are known to occur
only in the extreme western and southwestern (i.e.,
upland plain and Rio Grande gravels near La
Joya) parts of the project area (Mallouf et al.
1977). For modeling purposes, it is assumed that
this is an accurate picture of the distribution of
usable lithic materials.
Distance from these
sources is assumed to have significantly affected
lithic sample size and distribution. Some attributes are assumed to covary directly with distance
from source while others are expected to be
inversely correlated. The degree of decortication
and the form in which raw materials were transported from the upland plain to material-poor
zones should have affected the nature of the artifact samples in both areas. For this discussion, it
is assumed that raw materials were decortified at
the sources and transported in a decortified state

Analysis Attributes and Predictions
of the Models
Because lithic assemblages are integral elements of most subsistence-related activities, they

37

(i.e., prepared cnres, blanks, preforms, and finished tools) across the project area. 'Ibe useintensity of a given resource patch, defined as the
number of people per occupation episode, the
number of revisits per year, and/or the duration of
individual occupation episodes, should have
affected assemblage size. Holding the distance
from raw material sources constant, it is assumed
that U>e more intensive the site use, the larger the
lithic assemblage. Fiually, the arrangement of
band territories also should have limited access to
lithic resources. Because under Model II only tl1e
upland plain group had access to lithic resources,
it is necessary lo consider the operation of an
interregional raw material exchange network. TI1c
nature of the network, coupled with the exchllllge
paths and the form of the materials exchanged,
will have affected the lithic assemblages encountered at sites in the project area.
Predictions regarding the twelve lithic attrii:>-ules for each of the three models arc shown in
Tables 4, 5, mid 6. These predictions are grounded in cross-cultural ethnographic and ethnoarcheological data and by no means represent the entire
range of variability that could have exis1ed in
prehfatoric contexts. Furlhermore, it is important
to ke<>p in mind that a comparison of the regional
archcological data will! the predictions outlined in
these matrixes is a test of these assumed relationships rather tlian of the models themselves
(Binford 1983:10-15).
The symbols used in the matrixcs (+, =, -)
reflect the predicted frequencies of an attribute in
relation lo a homogeneous distribution tl1roughout
all cells. For example, a "+" in a cell for re-sharpening flakes indicates that the observed value
of resharpening flakes in that purliculur cell should
be greater than if resharpening flakes had an even
distribution across Uie landscape, Thus,"+" refers
to attribu1es occurring in greater tlian predicted
frequencies, "-" reflects less than predicted frequencies, and "=" indicates attribuLcs occurring in
frequencies equal to the predicted values given a
homogeneous distribution.

a single group occupied the entire projcd area and
had unlimited access to all environmental zones
(see Fig. 13). The most intensively used zone was
the Rio Grande floodplain and delta, followed in
decreasing order by the coast, sand sheet, lowland
plain, lllld upland plain.
Even within lowrcsource-yield environmental zones, moreintensive site occupations are expected to hnve
occurred at the boundaries between low- and
high-yield zones (e.g., lowland plain and coast;
upland plain and sand she<>!; and upland plain and
floodplain). Lithic resources were available only
in the upland plain zone, and as a result, the
farther east a site was located, the greater rhe
distance from raw matcl'ial sources.
The model-specific predictions presented in
Table 4 are summarized below. The frequencies
or early reduction debitage, lnrge dcbitagc, total
debitage, and manufacture failures are predicted to
decrease witli increasing distance from raw material sources within the Rio Grande floodplain and
sand sheet. A similar west to cast decrease is
anticipated in the lowland plain, but lower frequencies of the four attributes are anticipated in
the western portion of this zone due to lower useintensity. The coast should have consistently low
frequencies of these attributes due to the great
distance from lithic sources. Conversely, the
upland plain should have consisteutly high frequeucies due to the availability of raw materials.
The frequency of cores is predicted lo be lowest
in the coast due to the distance from source areas.
Because of the low use-intensity of the lowland
plain, equally low frequencies arc anticipated
throughout lllis zone, even in the western ponion
which borders the upland plain. Core frequencies
should decrense from moderate levels in the
western and central portions of the Rio Grande
floodplain and sand sheet to low counts in the
eastern sections. Doth the lower frequencies of
cores in Uu: western portions of the two zones and
the west to east decrease are due to the effects of
increasing distance from material sources. The
frequencies of resharpening flakes lllld use-broken
tools arc assumed lo be conditioned by the smne
factors and should show the same pattem.
Resharpening flakes and use-broken tools are predicted to be equally frequent within all portions
of the Rio Grande floodplain due to the high useintensity and greater length of occupation of the
entire zone, Similarly high frequencies should

The two attributes are anticipated to increase with
increasing distance from lithic sources and
increasing use-intensity. The highest figures arc
anticipated for the coast and the eastern segments
of the Rio Grande floodplain and sand sheet.
Although the western portions of the latter two
zones are close to raw material sources, these
areas are predicted to have moderate frequencies
of edge-modified flakes and mean numbers of
utilized edges per flake due to greater useintensity. 111e entire upland plain and the western
and central portions of the lowland plain should
have low frequencies due to raw material availability and low use-intensity. The eastern portion
of the lowland plain should have slightly higher
frequencies due to greater distance from material
source.

predictions defined for Model II. At the risk of
oversimplification but for the purposes of modeling, it is assumed that three territorial groups
occupied the project area (Groups A, B, and C).
Group territories were arranged perpendicular to
the Rio Grande and provided differential access to
neighboring environmental zones (see Fig. 13c). It
is assumed that the easternmost group (Group C)
had no direct access to the lowland and upland
plains and that the northern and southern portions
of the group territory provided access to the sand
sheet and delta, respectively. No lowland plain
access is assumed for this group because of the
accessibility to the more productive delta and sand
sheet. The central group (Group B) had no direct
access to the coast and upland plain, and its territory contained portions of the Rio Grande floodplain, the lowland plain, and the sand sheet. The
westernmost group (Group A) had no access to the
coast and lowland plain, but the northern and
southern portions of its territory provided access
to the sand sheet and Rio Grande floodplain,

Model II, Rio Grande Territorial Groups
A number of general assumptions that alter
the parameters of the first model underlie the
41

Prehistoric Archeology and Paleoe11viro11me11ts in Hidalgo and Willacy Counties

respectively. It is assumed that in the case of the
westernmost and central groups (Groups A and B)
the most intensively used wne was the Rio
Grande floodplain, followed by the sand sheet and
upland plain (Group A) and lowland plain (Group
B). The easternmost group (Group C) occupied
and used the delta and floodplain most intensively,
followed by the coast and tl1e sand sheet.
Because the Rio Grande delta and floodplain
were the most productive environments in each
group's territory, it is anticipated that these were
occupied the longest and that intergroup exchange
of lithic raw materials occurred there. While the
westernmost group had direct access to raw material sources, Groups B and C received raw materials in the form of decortified cores, finished
tools, and/or blanks and preforms.
Greater
degrees of reduction may have occurred as
artifacts moved eastward from raw material
sources. Because under this model the Rio
Grande floodplain functioned as an artificial lithic
source area, the twelve lithic attributes are anticipated to occur in similar patterns as discussed in
Model I, except that distance-related relationships
should be noted in a soutl1-north fashion from the
floodplain rather than from the actual lithic source
areas in the upland plain.
The differences in the assumptions underlying
Models I and 11 alter the predicted distributions of
the twelve lithic attributes within and across environmental zones (see Table 5). The frequencies of
early reduction debitage, large debitage, total
debitage, cores, and manufacture failures are
assumed to be higher in the western portion of the
Rio Grande floodplain, the territory occupied by
Group A. Because of the nature of the assumed
raw material exchange network, tl1e frequencies of
the five attributes in the Group B and Group C
portions of this zone should be equal but less tl1an
in the Group A territory. The frequencies of the
five attributes should be moderate in the sand
sheet Group A territory adjacent to tl1e upland
plain; however, the frequencies in the other two
group territories in tl1e sand sheet should be
equally low because of the greater distance from
material sources. Similarly low frequencies are
predicted in the lowland plain occupied by Group
B and the coast occupied by Group C. The predicted pattern in the central and eastern portions of
the sand sheet is conditioned by the distance from
the locus of raw material exchange, the Rio

Grande floodplain. The low frequency of the
attributes in the lowland plain occupied by Group
Bis due primarily to low use-intensity. The distance of the coast, occupied by Group C, from
material sources, coupled with the decortified and
relatively finished nature of the artifacts brought to
this zone, should generate low frequencies of early
reduction debitagc, large dcbitage, total dehitage,
cores, and manufacture failures. Conversely, the
availability of raw materials in the upland plain
Group A territory accouots for the high frequencies
of these attributes.
Resharpening flake and use-broken tool frequencies are predicted to be high within the Group
A and B territories and the Group C territory segments located in the Rio Grande floodplain and
the coast. The pattern is assumed to be most
strongly conditioned by the greater use-intensity
of sites in these zones. Moderate frequencies are
anticipated throughout the sand sheet due to low
use-intensity. The frequencies of these are predicted to be lowest in the lowland plain Group B
territory. The frequency of resharpening flakes
and use-broken specimens in the upland plain
Group A territory should be the same as in the
lowland plain occupied by Group B. However,
the pattern should be the result of a combination
of reduced use-intensity and availability of raw
materials. It is anticipated that exhausted tools
will be frequent at the sources of raw materials,
which in tl1e case of Model II is in the upland
plain Group A territory and in the Rio Grande
floodplain occupied by all three groups. Exhausted tools should be found in moderate frequencies
in the sand sheet and coast. The lowest frequencies should occur in the lowland plain Group B
territory due to low use-intensity.
The frequency of reused tools and the mean
number of working edges per uniface is predicted
to be high in the Group B territory in the sand
sheet and in the Group C ten'itory of the coast. A
similarly high frequency and mean should be noted
in the portion of the Group C territory located in
the sand sheet. The pattern is assumed to respond
to the higher use-intensity of these zones and the
lack of raw materials. The moderate frequency in
the Group A territory in the sand sheet is due to
its proximity to the raw-material-rich upland
plain. The moderate frequencies anticipated along
the Rio Grande are assumed to be the result of
less raw material stress in this zone, high
42

Chapter 3: Models of Late Holocene Human Adaptation in the Lower Rio Grande Valley

use-intensity, and the assumed intrazonal
exchange of lithic materials. The lowland plain
Group B territory should have lower frequencies
of these attributes than the Rio Grande floodplain
because of decreased use-intensity. Low frequencies of reused tools and low mean numbers of
working edges per uniface should occur in the
Group A territory in the upland plain due to the
availability of raw materials. The Group B territory, the portion of the Group C territory located
in the sand sheet, and the coastal portion of the
Group C territory should have high frequencies of
reused tools and mean numbers of edges per
uniface because of the more intensive use of these
segments.
The frequency of edge-modified flakes and
the mean number of utilized edges per flake are
predicted to pattern in a similar manner. High
numbers of modified edges should occur in the
Group B territory, the Group C territory segment
located in the sand sheet, and in the coastal Group
C territory. In both cases, the patterns are conditioned by use-intensity and distance from material
sources. The Group A territory in the sand sheet
is anticipated to have moderate frequencies of
these two attributes because of lessened raw
material stress near the upland plain. The lowland
plam should also have a moderate frequency of
edge-modified flakes and a moderate mean uumber of utilized edges per flake because it is
assumed that the lowland plain contains resources
that could be exploited with a tool kit composed
primarily of expedient tools. Because raw material stress is reduced along the Rio Grande and
use of this zone was intensive, the frequencies of
edge-modified flakes and the mean numbers of
utilized edges per tool in all group territories in
the Rio Grande floodplain are anticipated to be
moderate.

respect to the environmental zones, it is assumed
that Group C had no access to the lowland plain
or the Rio Grande floodplain and that its territory
included portions of the coast, sand sheet, and
upland plain. Group B had no access to the Rio
Grande floodplain or the sand sheet, and its territory transected the coast, the lowland plain, and
the upland plain. Group A had no access to the
lowland plain or the sand sheet, and its territory
included portions of the coast and Rio Grande
delta and floodplain; its western segment also
provided access lo the upland plain. In the case
of Group A, the most intensively used zone is
assumed to have been the coast and delta region,
followed by the inland portion of the Rio Grande
floodplain and the upland plain. Group B also
occupied and used primarily the coast, followed
by the lowland plam and upland plain. Group C,
the northernmost group, most intensively used the
coast followed by the sand sheet and upland plain.
It is assumed that each group had direct access to
lithic sources located in the upland plain. Raw
materials were transported from the source areas
in decortified form (i.e., prepared cores, blanks,
preforms, and finished artifacts).
Given these underlying assumptions, the
following lithic attribute distributions are predicted
(see Table 6). The frequencies of early reduction
debitage, large debitage, total debitage, cores, and
manufacture failures arc expected to pattern similarly. The upland plain group territories are predicted to have the highest frequencies of these
attributes. The Rio Grande floodplain occupied by
Group A, the lowland plain occupied by Group B,
and the sand sheet occupied by Group C are anticipated to have moderate frequencies. The intrazonal and iuterwnal patterns in these five attributes are conditioned by distance from the lithic
source areas. The frequencies of resharpening
Hakes and use-broken tools should pattern similarly. The Group A territory segment contained in
the Rio Grande floodplain and the Group C
segment located in the sand sheet should have high
frequencies of these two attributes due to moreintensive use. The coastal portion of each group's
territory also should have high frequencies due to
both distance from material sources and greater
use-intensity.
The lowland plain Group B
territory should have moderate frequencies of
resharpening flakes and use-broken specimens
because of distance from material sources and low

Model Ill, Coastal Territorial Groups
The assumptions underlying this model are
probably oversimplifications but are necessary for
modeling purposes. It is again assumed that three
groups occupied the project area (Groups A, B,
and C). Group territories were arranged perpendicular to the coast, which is assumed to have
been the primary source of dietary resources for
all three groups (see Fig. 13d). Because of the
spatial arrangement of group territories with

43

Prehistoric Archeology and Pa/eoenvironmenrs in Hidalgo and Willacy Counties

use-intensity. All group territories in the upland
plain are unticipnted lo have low frequencies of
the two allribules due to the availability of raw
materials and the low use-intensity.
Exhausted tools are a.<;.~umed to occur frequently in the upland plain because of low
replacement costs. Moderate frequencies are predicted in all other zones. Unlike the Model I
expectations, the lowland plain occupied by Group
B will have moderate frequencies due to the
slighlly greater use-intensity assumed under this
model. The frequencies of reused tools and edge-modified flakes and the mean numbers of working
edges and utilized edges on unifaces and edgemodified flakes are assumed lo respond to similar
conditioning factors. The highest frequencies and
means are onticipated along the coastal portion of
each group's territory, the Rio Grande floodplain
and delta occupied by Group A, and the sand
sheet occupied by Group C. Moderate figures
should occur thraughout lite lowland plain

occupied by Group B because this is the secondranked resource zone in this group's territory. The
lowest frequencies are anticipated for the upland
plain because of tlie availability of raw materia!S.
These expected patterns are proposed here to
serve as hypotheses describing the relationships
between pmticular analytical categories and conditio!ling factors such llS raw material availability
and environmental zone use-intensity. It is hoped
that the interzonal distributional patterns for the
varioas analytical categories can be nsed to characterize the organization of technology of the
groups that utilized the project area, and an
attempt to achieve this goal is presented in
Chapter 7. Regardless, the comparison of these
assamed relationships with actual archcological
patterns should contribute to the refinement of the
ussumptions and the advancement of our understanding of the operation of both land-use systems
and resource procurement strategies under U1e
particular constraints operating in Uie project area.

OBJECTIVES AND METHODS

4

by Gail L. Bailey and C. Britt Bousman

Chapter 3 outlines the research framework
within which the cultural resources of the
Hidalgo-Willacy Drainage Ditch project were
investigated. This chapter presents the objectives
and methods of the National Register testing of
five prehistoric sitcs--41HG 128, 41WYl12,
41WY113, 41 WY134, and 41WY140. The objectives were based on defined gaps in the archeological record of the project area and were intended to provide the infonnation necessary for
assessing National Register eligibility. The field
and laboratory methods were designed lo provide
the specific infonnation required to address the
research design (see Chapter 3), to more
adequately and accurately assess the sparse
archeological record of far South Texas, to assess
the geological context of the archeological occurrences, and to insure that the results of the present
project were comparable to the results of the previous projects on the Hidalgo-Willacy Drainage
Ditch.

l , the Stale Historic Prcserv ation Officer, the
Galveston District Corps of Engineers, and
Prewitt and Associates, Inc. that a select group of
five sites subjected to Phase II excavations would
meet the sampling requirements.
Development of the ethnohistorical, archeological, and paleocnvironmental records, along
with an analysis and synthesis of these data, is the
long-tenn objective of the Hidalgo-Willacy
Drainage Ditch cultural resource investigations.
Salinas (1986, 1990), along with Ruccking (1953,
1955), provides an adequate etlmohistoric record
for the project area, and it is unlikely that
additional ethnohistoric work on known documents
would greatly enhance this data base. The paleoenvironmental and archcological records are still
deficient, however, and their development is the
major concern of tl1is project. Full synthesis of
these data must await construction of more
complete and detailed paleoenvironmental and
archeological records, but a general model has
been proposed (Prewitt and Associates, Inc. 1986)
and is elaborated upon in Chapter 3. Obviously,
analysis and synthesis rarely occur in a single
step, and the development of a research design,
models, hypotheses, and tests of hypotheses should
account for new data as it is recovered and should
be fine-tuned as research proceeds. As part of
this process, an additional objective of this project
was to provide a data base that could be used for
spatial and temporal intersite comparisons and,

ARCHEOLOGICAL OBJECTIVES
The Phase I investigations identified 27
archeological sites that were judged to be
potentially eligible for listing on the National
Register of Historic Places; from these, 7 were
recommended for National Register testing (Hall
et al. 1987:77). Subsequently, however, it was
agreed by the Hidalgo County Drainage District
No. l, the Willacy County Drainage District No.

45

Prehistoric Archeology and Paleoenvironments in Hidalgo and Willacy Counties

more specifically, for the first round of hypotl1esis
testing of the models proposed in Chapter 3.
The five archeological sites reported here
were selected for Phase II testing to provide (I) a
sample of sites across the deltaic plain to assess
spatial variability in the archeological record; (2)
a sample of shallowly and deeply buried archeological sites to flesh out chronological patterns in
the archeological record; and (3) a record of the
depositional environments in which archeological
remains occur. It was hoped that these sites
would yield information on the . sequences of
paleoenvironmental and cultural changes during the
period of known human habitation. The characteristics on which the five sites were chosen for
Phase II testing are presented below.
Site 41HG128 is a large site located adjacent
to a relatively deep blowout depression. Several
tool types (gouges, bifaces, and scrapers) were
collected during the Phase I survey, and mussel
shells and numerous burned clay lumps were
noted. A possible historic component was also
observed. The potential to yield environmental
information and the high frequency of tool types
were factors in recommending this site for further
work.
Site 41WY112 is located adjacent to a
blowout depression. During the Phase I investigations, lithic debitage, mammal bones, one conch
shell fragment, and burned clay lumps were
observed along the ditch banks at ca. 40 cm below
the ground surface. The variety of material types
present and the association with the blowout
suggested that this site could yield both geologically and archeologically significant data.
Site 41WY113 yielded a human burial during
the Phase I investigations and two bifaces during
a follow-up visit (see Appendix A). The initial
excavation was limited to recovery of the burial,
and more information was necessary to determine
if this is also a habitation site. Good bone preservation, the potential for additional burials, and
the presence of tools were also factors in recommending tl1is site for furtl1er work.
Site 41WY134, located at the edge of a
blowout depression, yielded numerous burned clay
lumps, lithic debitage, and mammal bones during
the Phase I work. The variety of materials and
the potential for environmental data from the
blowout deposits made this site a good candidate
for further work.

Among tl1e sites tested, 41WY140 is uniquely
situated adjacent to a small rise. Chipped stones
and burned clay lumps were observed along the
Drainage Ditch banks at depths of 1-1.5 m and
2-3 m below the surface. The topographic setting
and the possibility of deeply buried cultural
deposits suggested that this site could contribute to
an understanding of tl1e geology of the region and
could provide data for intersite compruisons and
hence interpretations of settlement patterns.
The specific goals of the work at each site
were to determine the vertical and horizontal
extent of the cultural deposits, to assess the
integrity of the cultural deposits, to determine
whether or not features are present, to assess the
density of artifacts, to excavate an adequate
sample of the site so that a reasonable estimate
could be made of the amount of cultural materials
present and, lastly, to identify the age of the
cultural deposits through absolute or relative
dating. These data could then be used for National Register assessments and recommendations for
future investigations.
GEOLOGICAL OBJECTIVES

The Phase II geological investigations had
four objectives. The first was to assess the
geological context of the archeological materials
at each site. As this area is heavily disturbed by
historic agricultural activities (Mallouf et al. 1977)
and ditch construction, the effects of these disturbances on the archeological record had to be
identified. A second and related objective was to
establish the chronological sequence of deposition
at the sites. Little is known about the late Pleistocene and Holocene sedimentary chronology from
the Rio Grande Delta region of Texas, and
chronometric dates are sorely needed. A third
objective, establishing tl1e nature of the sedimentary and pedogenic processes active in site formation, required the identification of the depositional
environments reflected by tl1e stratigraphy and
sediments. The last objective was to initiate
paleoenvironmental studies in the project area.
While pollen and phytolith samples were collected, it was decided that the geological deposits
lacked sufficient stratigraphic resolution and
context for these types of studies to provide useful
and unbiased results.
Consequently, stable
isotopes were selected as the most productive type

of paleoenvironmental data that could be obtained

during the present project.

features or artifact concentrations exposed along
the ditch banks.
Test units were numbered
sequentially as they were excavated.
At
41WY113, test units were also placell'over anomalies identified in the magnetometer survey (see
Appendix B). The test units were excavated in
arbitrary 10-cm levels to maintain vertical control
in depositional zones greater than 20--cm thick.
Wilen natural slrntigraphy could be discerned, the
excavation levels corresponded to stratigraphic
zones. The excavation levels were numbered
sequentially starting with Lk'vel 1 at U1e modem
ground surface. This level usually consisted of
the overburden zone which varied in thickness and
was removed as one level. Venical control was
maintained by a line-level datum placed at the
edge of each test unit, All excavated matrix was
water screened through l/4-inch-mesh hardw>lfe
cloth. A sample from each level at all test units
wa> fine screened and COflSisted of the nortl1cast
50x50-cm quadrant of the level.
The water-screening system (sec Appendix
E) consisted of a 5-horsepower agricultural pump
feeding two 3/4-inch-diarneter discharge hoses
(50 and l 00 ft) with control nozzles set up at two
screening stations (Fig. 14). A similar system
using a trash pump was also employed periodically. Wilen needed, a deflocculant (sodium
hydrochloride) was used to soak the excavated
matrix prior to screening. For fine screening, a
1/16-inch-mesh window screen, attached to the
1/4-inch screen frame on one side to prevent
strong winds from blowing it away, was laid into
the screen and another l/4-inch screen was placed
on top. A sample quadrant of each level was
screened through the l/4-inch screen and then
through the fine screen. Artifacts, burned clay
lumps, snail shells, mussel and marine shells,
calcium carbonate and manganese concretions, and
modem materials were collected and tagged with
the appropriate provenience.
The test units, backhoe lrenches, line level
datums, site datums, and general topography were
mapped using a transit and metric stadia rod.
Each site wus also documented with 35-mm color
and black~and-white photographs.

METHODS OF INVESTIGATIONS
Archcolugical Field Methods

The five sites reported here--4IHG128,
41WY112, 41WY113, 41WYl34, and
41WY 140--were located initially during Phase I
investigations through examination of ditches after
their excavation. They were relocated for Phase
II testing using mileage designations on the State
of Texas Site Data Forms. Prior to subsurface
investigations, proton magnetometer surveys were
conducted at 41WYll2 and 41WY113 to evaluate
the utility of magnetometry in the project area
(see Appendix B).
The tasks accomplished
following the magnetometer swvcys are described
below.
The first task was to conduct a pedestrian
swvey of each site. 'This was accomplished with
a six-person crew aligned perpendicular to the
ditch bank and walking paratlel to the drainage
using pin flags LO mark any observed cultural
materials. A semi-permanent datum (a 30-cm
long, l/2-inch-diameter rcbar stake) was then
placed in the spoil pile above the road, witl1 ca. 3
cm of the datum stake exposed above ground
surface. At 41WY112, datum markers were
placed at both U1e east and west ends of the site.
At most sites, the geological trench excava~
tions preceded the excavation of archeological test
units, and this provided a preview of the stratigraphy encountered during the hand excavations.
'This permitted the rapid identification and removal
of distwtJcd historic deposits and overburden in
archeological test units. At one site, 4lHG128,
test units were placed adjacent to geological
trenches, the overburden was removed mechanically, and the hand excavations were begun at the
bottom of tl1e disturbed deposits. This procedure
was not possible at all sites because U1e geological trenches often were placed in areas where they
would provide a comprehensive view of the
sediments, and these locales were not the most
opportune spots for archeological test miits.
A minimum of four lxl~m test units was
excavated at each site. Test units were placed to
sample the entire site area and investigate any

investigations. First., a review of the background
geological literatwe was undertaken. This indicated that no active fluvial deposition occurred at
the sites during the period of human occupation,
and that colluvial and eolian deposition and
pedogenic alteration could be expected.
Two to five trenches were excavated
mechanically across each site for the geological
investigations. A trackhoe with D 150-cm-wide
bucket and an operator were provided by the
Willacy County Drainage District for the excavations in Willacy County, and the Hidalgo County
Drainage District provided a backhoe with an 80cm-wide bucket and an operator for the excavations in that county. Geological trenches were
placed so as to provide a comprehensive view of
the deposits contoining cultural materials.
Backhoe trenches and test unit wall profiles
were described, photographed, and selectively

sampled for textural analysis. Descriptions of the
deposits used the geologically neutral concept of
"zone". Zone transitions were identified by
changes in color, particle size, sorting, cohesiveness, structure, and boundary attributes. Each
recorded stratigraphic entity met the definition of
a woe as "any regular or irregular ... layer ...
of earth moterials . . . charocterized as distinct
from surrounding parts by some particular property or content" (Gary et al. 1972:80). This
versatile concept permits designation of ·any
perceived layer in a profile _as a zone whether it
resulted from pedogenesis, sedimentation, cultural
activity, or an unidentified process as long as it is
readily distinguishable from adjacent zones. When
sufficient information was available, a zone was
assigned a specific label.
All sediment colors were read when lhe
samples were moist using a Munsell Soil Color

Chart. Ail sediment textures were estimated in
the field by feel following the guidelines set forth
by Soil Survey Staff (1962, 1975) and Olson
(1981). Sedimentary structures and evidence of
bioturbation, as discussed by Reineck and Singh
(1975), were identified when possible. Surface
topography was used to assess the environment of
deposition.
Additionally, subsurface evidence
such as buried soils, erosional surfaces, and
particle size changes were used to identify paleogeomorphic features.
After description and assessment, standard
soil horizons as defined in Birkeland (1984:7-9)
were applied. Standnrd master soil horizons (0,
A, E, B, C, and R) were augmented with a subordinate classification system denolL:d by a lowercase letter suffix to the master symbol marked by
a capital letter. 0 horizons refer to the uppermost
zone of a soil that retains identifiable organic
material. A horizons have no identifiable organic
material, but decomposed organic matter is
present as well as mineral matter; U1ese horizons
are usually dark. Some horizons are characterized
by a loss of material, usually clay or other materials, due to a downward movement of water, or
eluviation. These are E horizons. B horizons
have less organic matter but more mineral constituents tlmn A horizons. They are characterized by
the accumulation of minerals moved down from an
E horizon, e.g. illuviation, and are usually not as
dark as A horizons. In C horizons, the parent
material is relatively less affected by pedogenesis
than are the overlying soil horizons, but some
indication of soil formation does exist. R horizons
refer to bedrock, which for this area is unweathered Plio-Pleistocene fluvial deposits. l11e subordinate classifications used include p, b, t, k, and
c. A lower-case p denotes a horizon that has
been disturbed by agricultural activities (i.e., a
plowzone). A lower-case b mdicates a buried soil
horizon and in this report is limited to the upper
horizon in a single solum. A lower-case t is
restricted to B horizons and denotes clay accumulations due to illuviation or in situ genesis. The
lower-case k designation indicates Ille presence of
calcium carbonate in lhe form of nodules or
filaments, while the lower-case c desiguation
indicates the presence of iron or manganese
concretions. When more than one subordinate
designation is indicated, tlrnlr relative positions
reflect eict1er the seqnence of occurrence or the

importance of the attributes. For example, an Apb
horizon is an A horizon that was disturbed by
plowing and later buried, while a Bkc horizon is a
B horizon with more calcium carbonate nodules
than manganese concretions. Roman numerals
preceding the master horizon designation indicate
a lithological discontinuity (Olson 1981). In all
cases, this discontinuity marks a shift to a different sedimentary unit, and an unconformity separates the two units. For example, in this area a
common profile sequence is an A horizon sitting
on a !IC horizon. The A horizon is a Holocene
soil Uiat sits unconformably on a C horizon developed on the Pleistocene Beaumont Formation.
Master soil horizons subdivided by subordinate
classifications arc numbered sequentially in
descending order.
Laboratory Processing Methods
Laboratory processing and analysis of the
culrural materials began immediately after completion of the fieldwork. Laboratory processing
was the first task and consisted of washing all
artifacts and drying all samples. Using India ink,
the artifacts were labeled with a lot number
indicating provenience. After being inventoried,
the sedimeut and charcoal samples to be radiocarbon dated were packaged and submitted to Beta
Analytic, Inc. and Geochron Laboratories, Inc.,
and the remainder were packaged for curation.
The processing of photographs involved labeling
all 35-mm slides with !he site number, a unique
catalog number, and a description; 35-mm b\ackand-white negatives were labeled with the site
number and a catalog number and placed in an
envelope containing a typed description and a
contact print. These procedures Hte in accordance
with those required by the repository at which the
materials generated by this project are curated, the
Texas Archeologlcal Research Laboratory at The
University of Texas nl Austin.
EVALUATION OF THE METHODOLOGY
Several methodologies applied during the
Phase II investigations were notably effective.
The geological investigations, conducted before
and during the archcologicai excavations, identified intact or undisturbed deposits that might
contain in situ cultural materials.
Disturbed

49

artifact frequencies, limited tool assemblages, and
the absence of features (only a few positively
identified hearths exist). Considering tl1e nature of
archeological assemblages in tl1e area, it was
expected tliat lithic tool maintenance would be the
most common activity at these sites, but its archeological visibility would be dependant on recovering microdebitage produced during this activity.
Microdebitage could be recovered only by fine
screening. Titls resulted in the identification of a
component of the lithic assemblages that was
previously undetected. Unfortunately, fine screening was not attempted previously at other prehistoric sites in the region.
Water screening of all excavated deposits
was worthwhile also because it allowed the
excavations to proceed at a rapid pace. Two
water screening systems were evaluated, and the
results are presented in Appendix E.
Of final note is the usefulness of information
from local informants which aided in interpretation
of the depositional environment at each site. The
local farmers and county drainage district employees provided crucial information concerning recent
land use in the project area.

deposits were also recognized. Although this
method is not new, it often occurs with minimal
consultation between the geologist and archeologist
during field investigations, or the geological work
is done after or near the end of the archeological
fieldwork. The geologic studies were aided by the
rapid processing of two radiocarbon samples from
41WY112 before completion of fieldwork. This
provided information that permitted the accurate
assessment of historic disturbance while tl1e
geologist was still conducting fieldwork. Early
identification of these disturbed deposi!s permitted
their quick removal, and thus the majority of the
field time was spent investigating intact deposits.
Use of the backhoe to remove overburden and
disturbed deposits also facilitated data recovery.
Once such deposits were positively identified, they
could be removed in bulk, and tl1e hand excavations could proceed.
The previous work in the project area indicated that cultural materials are extremely sparse.
This area is presumed to have been a resourcepoor environment (Hester 1981:120), and tltls
presumption is supported by the archeological
record which demonstrates tl1at most sites in the
project area reflect limited activities based on low

This chapter describes tlic five prehistoric sites

et al. 1987:99-100). The materials observed at
tl1is site consisted of two bifaccs, one modified
flake, five pieces of debitage, one aboriginal sherd
(possibly of Haustccan influence, see Appendix
A), seven bone fragments, several pieces of
mussel shell (one possibly shaped), one piece of
sandstone (possibly grooved), one piece of glass,
and one possible historic ceramic shenl. These
materials were eroding from tlie north bank of the
drainage ditch. The site was estimated to extend
ca. 40 cm below the modem surface and 350 m
east-west along the drainage bank. Site 41HG128
was assessed as probably eligible for listing on
the National Register of His Lorie Places based on
the quantity and diversity of the cultural materials.

under investigation. Presented for each are descriptions of the site setting, the previous investigations, the work accomplished, !he site extent and
depth, !he sediments and radiocarbon chronology,
any culturnl features observed, !he materials
recovered, and summary comments. The sites are
presented in numerical order by county beginning
with Hidalgo County and followed by Willacy
County.
41HG128
Site Setting
Site 4 lHGl 28 is located north of La Villa,
Texas, along !he South Main Channel approximately l .95 km north-northwest of the intersection
of FM 1925 and FM 491. It lies along the edges
of a relatively deep depression and is exposed on
the north bank of the drainage ditch (Fig. 15a).
The site is at nn elevation of 50 ft ms! and is
surrounded by cultivated fields. The central
portion of the depression is not cultivated, probably because it is too marshy for crops and farm
machinery. During drainage ditch excavation, fill
was placed along the ditch edge to provide a dry
access road (Fig. 15b ).

Wm· k Accomplished

The current investigations consisted of a
pedestrian survey of the site and excavation of
five backhoe trenches and eleven lxl-m test units
(Fig. 16). The survey identified two areas on the
north bank witl1 somewhat dense scatters of
artifacts. Test Units t, 2, 7-9, nnd 11 were
placed along the bank to investigate these scatters;
Test Units 3-6 and 10 sampled the remaining site
area. Table 7 summarizes the test unit excavations. All except Test Units 3 and 4 were excavated into tl1e P!io-Pleistocene bedrock fonnations. Test Units 7-11 were placed adjacent lo
small, mechanically excavated trenches, Overburden was first identified in the trench profiles
and then mechanically removed from the test units.

Sediments and Radiocarbon Chronology

The placement of the five backhoe trenches for the
geomorphlc investigations was based on sampling
the length of the site and the related deposits. The
backhoe trenches ranged in depth from 255 to
300 cm. Sediment and humate samples were
collected from test units and backhoe trenches, The
fieldwork at 41 HGl28 was completed in 52
person-days.

Site 4 lHGI 28 is on the north slope of a winderoded depression. Tiris depression is in an
abandoned channel (Holz and Prewitt 1981) that
appears to be near or on the boundary between the
Lissie and Goliad foimatioru; (Bureau of Economic
Geology, 1976) (see Figs. 5 and 8). The soils
reflect the more recent eolian alteration of the area
(Fig, 17). Over most of the area, Willacy fine
sandy loam soils have formed on a large stabilized
dune deposit that trends southeast to northwest and
covers the bedrock formation discussed above. The
age of this dune is unknown, but it probably was
deposited in the late Pleistocene. Wind erosion
created the large deflationary basin at 41HGl28
and apparently removed Uie stabilized dune in and
around the basin. Rio clay loam soils occur in the
basin, while Racombes fine sandy loam soils
occupy the surrounding slopes (Jacobs 1981).
The distribution of modem soils as mapped on
the U.S.D.A. Soil Conservation Service Soil Survey
Maps for Hidalgo and Willacy counties reflects the
recent geological history of the region (Jacobs
1981; Tumer 1982). In general, sandy clay loam
soils have formed on uneroded Plio-Pleistocene

Site Extent and Depth
Prehistoric artifacts were recovered from B of
11 test units (see Table 7). Based on the distribution of surface and excavated materials, the site
extends a minimum of ca. JO m north-south and
390 m east-west. The vertical distribution of the
artifacts is illustrated in Table 8. The cultural
deposits range in thickness from 16 to 111 cm,
1be densest concentration is located in Level 5 of
Test Unit 5 but it is unclear wheUier these artifacts
were recovered from in situ prehistoric-aged
.~ediments (see Feature 3 below). In comparison
with the other sites under investigation, the central
portion of 4IHG128 contains the highest density
of artifacts (27 artifacts/m') and prehistoric
features.

Most erosional depressions (blowouts) have been
scoured out of these ancient, abandoned channels,
Some channels have clay loam soils, but few
blowouts occur in tl1cse settings as clay loam is not
easily eroded by wind. Within most blowouts, tlie
soils are very clayey because wind erosion has
removed the sands and probably most of the
coarser silts that were originally rrresent or transported in through slopewash. Sandy loam eolian
sediments occur on the north and northwest sides
of many blowouts and apparently formed low dunes
on tl1e flat landscape. Within Ibis century, these
sandy loam dunes have been flattened and pushed
into the blowouts for agriculturnl purposes.

loam with coarse horizontal bedding and subrounded sediment clasts common throughout. The
lower 6 cm are sandy with a very abrupt wavy
lower boundary which is an obvious unconformity.
Zone 4 (106-122 cm) is very dark gray finn loam,
probably compacted by construction, with a gradual
smooth lower boundary. Zone 5 (122-147 cm) is
dark gray sandy loam with common scattered very
dark gray to black clay lumps, rare charcoal flecks,
one single whole snail shell, and an abrupt irregular
lower boundary. Zone 6 (147-149 cm) is grayish
brown to dark grayish brown sand Jens that is
continuous across the entire profile. Zone 6 has
very dark grayish brown silt loam clasts, and in the
eastern profile wall, a small depression is filled
with well-laminated very thin alternating sand and
clay lenses. The very abrupt lower boundary is
smooth to wavy to irregular. All the deposits from
Zone 6 and above are the result of historic agricultural disturbance and land clearing (Zones 4-6) and
ditch construction activities (Zones 1-3). Zone 7
(149-180 cm), an Ab horizon, is very dark grayish
brown loam witl1 friable to finn consistency and
weak medium blocky structure. A few charcoal
flecks and chunks were observed, and it has a
gradual smooth lower boundary. Zone 8 (180230 cm) is dark gray friable silt loam with moderate medium blocky structure and well-developed
ped faces, rare manganese flecks, and a gradual
smooth lower boundary. This is a I!Bc horizon
developed on the Goliad Fonnation. Zone 9 (230270+ cm) is gray silt loam with common strong
brown very fine distinct mottles, common manganese concretions, and many calcium carbonate
nodules which decrease down profile. Excavations
did not extend through this I!Ckc horizon.
Backhoe Trench 3 has five zones identified
(see Fig. l 8). Zone I (0-62 cm) is very dark gray
to dark grayish brown finn to very firm sandy loam
to loam. This zone has been compacted by
construction, and its lower boundary is very abrupt
and smooth. Zone 2 (62-140 cm) is speckled pale
brown to dark grayish brown sandy loam with
subhorizontal dark grayish brown layers and a
gradual smooth lower boundary. Zone 3 (140159 cm) consists of charcoal, white ash, and burned
clay lumps· with a very abrupt wavy to irregular
lower boundary. Zone 3 represents the burning of
a brush pile, which occurred either during historic
land clearing in the early twentieU1 century or when
the ditch was constructed. All the sediments above

Zone 3 represent filling of the depression during
ditch construction. Zone 4 (159-200 cm) is very
dark gray friable loam with weak coarse blocky
structure rare snail shells, a thin sand lens in the
upper 10 cm, and a gradual smooth lower boundary. It is an Ab horizon. Zone 5 (200-310+ cm)
is gray to very pale brown friable sandy loam with
moderate medium blocky structure and common
manganese concretions. The sediment is weathered
Goliad Fonnation, and the soil horizon is classified
as IICc. The backhoe trench was not excavated to
the bottom of this zone.
Zone 1 (0-20 cm) in Backhoe Trench 4 is
loose construction fill with a very abrupt smooth
lower boundary (see Fig. 18). Zone 2 (20-79 cm)
is very dark gray to dark grayish brown finn to
very firm sandy loam to loam with a very abrupt
smooth lower boundary. This zone has been
compacted by ditch construction activities. Zone
3 (79-126 cm) is speckled pale brown to dark
grayish brown loam with subhorizontal dark grayish
brown layers and a very abrupt wavy lower
boundary. Zones 1-3 represent artificial fill placed
in the depression for construction of the ditch
access road. Zone 4 (126-150 cm) is dark gray
very finn to firm loam witl1 coarse medium blocky
structure. It appears to have been compacted
during construction of the ditch. Also present are
rare small burned clay Jumps, a few charcoal
fragments and snail shells, and calcium carbonate
nodules. The lower boundary is very abrupt and
wavy. This is an A horizon disturbed by plowing
and later buried by fill (Apb). Zone 5 (150200 cm) is very dark gray silt loam with weak
medium blocky structure, pale brown sand-filled
cracks and insect burrows, many burned clay lnmps
between 190-195 cm, and a gradual smooth lower
boundary. A bulk humate sample from the top of
this zone (155-165 cm) was dated to 480 ± 80 B.P.
suggesting a Late Prehistoric age for the top of this
Ab horizon. It is likely that the soil continued to
accumulate after 480 B.P. but that most of the
younger sediments were disturbed by agricultural
activities represented by Zone 4. Zone 6 (200235 cm) is dark gray to light gray to light brownish
gray silt loam with weak medium blocky structure,
a few calcium carbonate nodules and filaments, and
a gradual smooth lower boundary. This is a IICk
horizon. Zone 7 (235-300+ cm), a I!Ckc horizon,
is dark gray to light brownish gray silt loam with
weak medium blocky structure and many calcium

carbonate nodules and manganese concretions. The
backhoe trench was not excavated to the bottom of
this zone. A sample of calcium carbonate nodules
was submitted for radiocarbon dating. The outer
and inner portions were removed by acid, and each
was dated in an attempt to obtain a temporal range
of pedogenic carbonate formation.
Ages of
17,350 ± 150 B.P. (Beta-32204a) for the inner
fraction and 12,780 ± 130 B.P. (Beta-32204b) for
the outer fraction were obtained. These ages
suggest that a soil was in place and forming on the
Goliad Formation for at least 4,500 years beginning
during the Last Glacial Maximum.
Four sediment zones were identified in Test
Unit 1 (see Fig. 18). Zone 1 (0-50 cm) is loose
dark gray loam witl1 a clear irregular lower
boundary. This is berm construction fill. Zone 2
(50-114 cm) is very dark gray, very firm loam
with coarse moderate blocky structure and a very
abrupt smooth lower boundary. This zone has a
few light brown sand-filled insect burrows, small
clay lumps, and rare calcium carbonate filaments.
A bulk soil humate sample from the bottom of this
zone was dated by radiocarbon, yielding an age of
290 ± 70 B.P. (Beta-32202). Zone 3 (114134 cm) is very dark gray silt loam with weak
moderate blocky structure and common large
pebble-sized burned clay lumps and charcoal
fragments occurring horizontally in the lower
portion. This is a truncated Ab horizon, the lower
boundary of which is gradual and smooth. Two
radiocarbon dates were obtained from the layer of
burned clay lumps and charcoal fragments (Level
10). A charcoal sample was dated to 4300 ±
130 B.P. (Beta-32200), and a matching humate
sample was dated to 1230 ± 80 B.P. (Beta-32201).
These ages suggest that the soil developed on the
Lissie Formation in this depression began to form
by 4300 B.P. Zone 4 (134-154 cm) is dark gray
to grayish brown silt loam with weak medium
blocky structure and a few calcium carbonate
nodules. This is a I!Ck horizon formed in Lissie
Formation sediments.
Backhoe Trench 5 has six sediment zones (see
Fig. 18). Zone 1 (0-40 cm) is composed of very
dark grayish brown, reddish yellow, and very pale
brown sand to silt loam construction fill with
coarse horizontal bedding, subrounded sediment
clasts common throughout, and a very abrupt wavy
lower boundary. Zone 2 (40-75 cm) is dark gray
sandy loam with common scattered very dark gray

to black clay lumps, rare charcoal flecks, and an
abrupt irregular lower boundary. This is an Apb
horizon. Zone 3 (75-120 cm), a truncated Bkc
horizon, is yellowish brown firm to extremely firm
sandy loam to loam with strong medium blocky
structure, a few small calcium carbonate nodules
and filaments, light manganese coatings on some
ped faces, and a clear smooth lower boundary.
Zone 4 (120-140 cm) is light yellowish brown firm
to extremely firm loam with strong medium to fine
blocky structure, few calcium carbonate nodules
and very many calcium carbonate filaments, and a
gradual smooth lower boundary. This is a IICk
horizon developed on the weatl1ered Lissie Formation, and the upper boundary of this zone is an
unconformity. Zone 5 (140-230 cm) is light gray
friable silt loam with weak medium blocky structure, many large calcium carbonate nodules, and
many manganese concretions. A well-laminated,
30-cm-thick, sand-filled paleochannel occurs at
tl1e bottom of this zone. Zone 5 has a gradual
smooth lower boundary, and it is classified as a
I!Ckc soil horizon. Zone 6 (230-270+ cm) is light
gray friable silt loam with weak medium blocky
structure, few large calcium carbonate nodules, and
many manganese concretions. The paleochannel
observed in the bottom of Zone 5 extends into Zone
6. This is a lICck horizon.
The upper sediments consisting of construction
fill were removed from Test Unit 5. Four zones
were identified in the remaining intact deposits
(Fig. 19). Zone 1 (98-133 cm) is very dark
grayish brown extremely firm sandy loam with
medium moderate to coarse blocky structure and
an abrupt to clear irregular lower boundary. This
is a Apbl horizon. Zone 2 (133-150/182 cm) is
very dark gray firm sandy loam with moderate
medinm to coarse blocky structure and a clear to
abrupt and very irregnlar lower boundary. Also
observed were a few charcoal fragments and one
small burned clay lnmp. Charcoal fragments from
the upper portion of Zone 2 (Level 3) were radiocarbon dated; tl1e resulting age is 120 ± 80 B.P.
(Beta-32977), and the tree-ring calibrated intercepts are 254, 223, 132, 90, 29 and 0 B.P. Thus,
this date cannot be used to determine if Zone 2 is
historic or prehistoric in age, although the configuration of tl1e lower boundary strongly suggests that
it is a manmade stratigraphic feature. Zone 2 is
classified as an Apb2 horizon as it is most likely
of historic origin (see Features below). Zone 3

yellowish brown firm to friable silt loam with few
calcium carbonate filaments, rare calcium carbonate
nodules, and a clear to gradual wavy lower
boundary. Zone 3 is a IICkl horizon. Zone 4
(225-245+ cm), a IICk2 horizon, is gray to grayish
brown and light yellowish brown firm to friable silt
loam with many calcium carbonate nodules. The
lower boundary was not exposed in this test unit.
The outer and inner portions of calcium carbonate
nodules from Zone 4 were racliocarbon dated. The
inner fraction yielded an age of 16,330 ± 130 B.P.

(Beta-32205a), and the outer provided an age of
15,0IO ± 170 B.P. (Beta-32205b). As with the
carbonate ages from Backhoe Trench 4, these also
suggest the existence of a soil during the Last
Glacial Maximum.
In summary, the deposits and racliocarbon ages
at 4lHGl28 demonstrate the existence of a soil
during the Last Glacial Maximum (between ca.
17,500 and 12,000 B.P.) that developed on the
Goliad and Lissie formations. This soil appears
to have been truncated and the upper portion

fine-screen materials from the northeast quadrant
of this test unit were processed, a large amount of
microdebitage (N = 41) was discovered from Level
5 (ca. 154-164cm below surface). Unfortunately,
the stratigraphic boundary was not recognized
during excavation, and U1e level with the microdebitage crosscuts Zones 2 and 3; hence, the
microdebitage could have come from either of these
two zones. A charcoal sample from the upper
portion of Zooe 2 (Level 3, ca. 130-141 cm below
surface) yielded a radiocarbon age of 120 ±
80 B.P. (Beta-32977). Unfortunately this assay
does not provide conclusive evidence as to the age
of the lower portion of Zone 2 (see discussion in
Sediments and Radiocarbon Chronology). The pit-like outline of Feature 3 may indeed be due to
historic land modification, in which case, the
prehistoric artifacts probably originated from the
undisturbed sedimcnls in Zone 3. This feature
seems to Ile typical of the types of disturbances
resulting from historic land modifications, and the
depth of the feature is within the expected range of
modL-rn disturbances.

probably removed by wind erosion. A late Holocene soil began to accumulate by 4300 B.P., and
it continued to develop and apparently accumulate
sediments until historic times. During the historic
period, vegetation was burned, the depression was
filled for agricultural purposes. and the sediments
were then altered by plowing. Lastly, construction
of the ditch required more infilling of the depression for access road construction, and this activity
also compacted a thin zone of deposits below the

construction surface.
Features
Three cultural features were investigated
during Phase IL Feature I is a modem bone dump
exposed along the drainage bank; it is not discussed
further because of its recent age. Feature 2 is a
concentration of wood charcoal, bone fragments,
debitage, and burned clay lumps. Feature 3
consists of a pit-like feature, possibly associated
with a dense zone of lithic debilagc. Al two other
locations--Levels 9-11 in Test Unit 1 and Levels
5-7 in Test Unit 8--substantial amounts of burned
clay lumps and sparse amounl' of debitage suggest
additional dispersed features.
Feature 2 was first observed as a layer of
burned clay lumps exposed in the Backhoe Trench
4 wall during !he gcomorphic investigations. Test
Unit 6 was placed at this location to further
investigate the burned clay lumps. The excavations
revealed a feature (sec Fig. 20) located from 147
to 193 cm below the modem surface (Levels 3-6)
and consisting of 3 large charcoal fragments and
numerous smaller pieces, 38 burned clay lumps,
0.3 g of bone, I flake from the 1/4--inch screen,
and 8 flakes from the 1/16-inch screen. The
feature is in the lower portion of Z-0ne 2 and may
be lying on or near the surface of 7,one 3. No pit
or dense cluster of artifacts was noted. Associated
charcoal yielded a radiocarbon age of 320 ±
90 B.P. (Beta-32978) suggesting that the artifacts
predate historic land modifications and are related
to prehistoric cultural activities. The artifacts
represent a typically sparse occupational zooo.
Feature 3 was found in Test Unit 5 between
154 and 183 cm below the modem surface. An
abrupt boundary between Zones 2 and 3 seems to
outline a pit that was originally believed to be the
result of historic disturbance (sec Fig. 19). Zone
3 is an Ab horizon and clear! y intact. 'W'hen the

Materials Recovered
A total of 116 artifacts was recovered from
41HGl28, consisting of2 projecWe points, 3 biface
fragments, 15 pieces of 1/4-inch-scrcen debitage,
95 pieces of fine-screen deb\tage, and I core.
Other materials observed include burned clay
lumps, charcoal, snail shells, freshwater mussel

shel1s bones, calcium carbonate concentrations;
1

gypsum, siliceous pebbles, and modem debris {see
Appendix A).

Discussion
Site 41HGl28 yielded the highest frequency
of artifacts in the Phase II investigations. The
vertical distribution of artifacts demonstrates that
there are intact prehistoric cultural materials
present in the late Holocene soil, and the artifacts
and associated materials from Features 2 and 3
indicate at least one period of occupation. The
radiocarbon age (Betu-32978) of the Feature 2
materials places it near or in the Historic Contact
period. The high frequency of debitage from the
fine screen suggesl' that tool maintenance was an ·
important activity at this site. No diagnostic
artifacts were recovered in excavations, and the

62

Chapter 5: Site Descriptions

overall sparseness of artifacts suggests nonintensive
use of !he site.

Work Accomplished
The Phase II investigations at 41WY112
consisted of a magnetometer survey, excavation of
three backhoe trenches, and hand excavation of
eleven lxl-m test units (Fig. 22). The magnelometer survey covered a ca. 250x9-m area between
the drainage bank and the spoil pile (see Appendix
BJ. This survey identified several weak anomalies,
but the correspondance of these anomalies with
historic metal artifacts, construction dfaturbance,
and biogenic features (e.g., red ant beds) demonstrates the inability of magnetometer surveys to
provide useful data in highly disturbed contexts
such as exist around the drainage ditch.
A surface survey of the drainage banks was
undertaken to locate and record cultural materials
exposed since the 1986 survey. Based on the
locations of surface artifacts and the need to
sample the entire site area, nine test units were
placed along the ditch bank. Two additional uni L~
(Test Units 4 and 11) were placed on the norlh side
of the access road to determine if nndisturbed
sediments with in situ cultural materials occurred
in these areas. Table 9 summarizes the excavations. Test Units I, 2, 4, and 6-11 were excavated
into or just above the Beaumont Formation and
ranged in depth from 34 to 165 cm. The three
backhoe trenches, ranging in depth from 205 to
275 cm, were excavated for geomorphological
investigations. At each backhoe trench, profiles
were described and sampled. The Phase II investigations at 4 lWY112 were completed in 91 persondays.

Site 4IWYI12 is located on the north side of
the South Main Channel, east of Lyford, Texas,
approximately 2.8 km southwest of the intersection
of FM 498 and FM 2099. It is on a bend of the
drainage ditch (Fig. 21) at an elevation of30-35 ft
ms! and is surrounded by cnltivated fields. An
artesian well located across the ditch is no longer
a water source since the water table has dropped
in recent years. A small natural depression adjacent to the site was known lo contain runoff and/or
spring water in recent times (Jim Riggan and
Douglas Oates, personal communication 1989).
The depression has suffered numerons and substantial alterations during this century when high spots
were leveled and low spots filled in to facilitate
irrigation of the cultivated fields (Douglas Oates,
personal communication 1989). Recently, during
ditch construction, access roads were built tu
county road elevations, and one piece of heavy
machinery was buried in thick muds near 41WY112
after extremely heavy rains (Jim Riggan, personal
communication 1989).

Previous Investigations
Th.is site was identified during the 1986 survey
(Hall et al. 1987:108-109) and subsequently
revisited in 1988. Cultural materials were exposed
in the north bank of the drainage ditch and consisted of a number of burned clay lumps, several
pieces of animal bone, two bilaces, six pieces of
debitage, two pieces of mussel shell, and one
possibly shaped conch shell fragment. As with
most sites along the ditch, only an east-west extent
could be estimated because of the presence of large
spoil piles resulting from excavation of the ditch.
The site extends ca. 250 m along the north side of
the ditch at ca. 40-50 cm below modem ground
surface. Hall et al. (1987:109) suggested that the
site was possibly eligible for listing on the National
Register of Hisloric Places based on "a great
quantity and variety of cultural dellris [which] is
present at !his site and it is relatively deep."

Site Extent and Depth
Based on artifact distributions adjacent to tl1e
diteh, the site covers an area ca. 10 m wide
parallel to the drainage ditch and extending ca.
160 m east-west. The vertical extent of cultural
materials ranges from 10 to 72 cm based on the
thickness of the undisturbed sediments. Eight of
the 11 test units yielded a total of 32 prehistoric
artifacts (see Table 9). Test UniL~ I and II,
located in the westem portion of the site, demonstrate low but consistent densities of artifact:;
distributed vertically in four consecullve levels
(Table 10) and represent the highest artifact
densities at this site. Test Units I and 11 also

tionary basin positioned within an ancient abandoned channel still visible on the present surface
of the Beaumont Formation (see Fig. 8). Before
construction of the ditch drastically altered modem
water drainage patterns, this depression probably
held surface water on a seasonal basis and was a
small playa. The soils within this wind-eroded
depression arc classified as Tiocano clays (Fig.
23). Racombes sandy clay loams occur around the
depression and formed on une!O<led Beaumont
Formation sediments. On the north and northwest
sides of the depression are Willimar fine sandy
loams. These sandy loams are derived from the
depression.
.
The geological sequence at this site is based
on observations and radiocarbon dates from the 3
backhoe trenches and 11 test units. Profile
descriptions for all backhoe trenches and selected
test units are provided in Appendix C, and four
profiles are discussed here to provide the sedimentary sequence for 41WY112.

appear to be located on the western edge of the
depression.
The majority of the excavated artifacts (21 of
25) were recovered from undisturbed or possibly
undisturbed deposits resulting in a density of 6
artifacts/m3• The maximum depth to which artifacts were found is 146 cm with an overburden of
87 cm. Although low, the artifact density at
41WY112 ranks second highest among the sites
tested during this fieldwork.

Sediments and Radiocarbon Chronology
Site 41WY112 is on the Beaumont Fonnation
(Bureau of Economic Geology 1976). According
to Holz and Prewitt's (1981) plottings of abandoned
stream channels on the exposed surface of the
Beaumont Formation and modem wind deflated
basins as shown on aerial photographs on USGS
7.5' topographic maps, this site is on the southern
and southwestern slopes of a small oblong defla64

(Beta-32979) occur in the lower portion. Zone 9
(148-149 cm) is black exlremely finn clay with
fine moderate granular structure and a few fine
calcium carbonate filaments; it is clearly water
deposited. Bulk hiimatcs from this layer were
dated to 104.3% of modem (Beta-31671). This
· 'value is typical of die years 1947 to 1952 when the
C14 concentration in the atmosphere was being
elevated by nuclear testing (M. Tamers, personal
communication 1989). Zone IO consists of gray
fine laminated sands th at fonn discontinuous lenses
and have a very abrupt smooth to wavy lower
bowidary. Zone 11 (151~210 cm) is very dary
gray friable loam with medium to coarse blocky
structure and a gradual smooth lower boundiry.
This is a buried A soil horizon (Ab), and a bulk
humate sample was dated by radiocarbon to
103.6% of modem (Beta-31672). 111e values from
this radiocarbon sample' are also characteristic of
the years 1947-1952. Between 210-250 cm, gray

gray silt loam (Zone 6 clasts) and freshwater marl
deposits, i.e., light brownish gray calcium carbonate
which strongly effervesces in a weak ncid solution.
Snail shells are common in the upper portion of die
zone. The marls indicate water ponding and sit on
an abrupt wavy boundary, between Zones 5 and 6.
Zone 6 consists of very dark gray exlremely finn
silt loam with coarse moderate blocky slructure and
many snail shell fragmems between 106 and
110 cm. The lower bmmdary is clear to abrupt and
smooth. Zone 7 (I I0-120 cm) is dark gray to very
dark. gray friable loam with weak medium blocky
structure and conunon calcium carbonate filaments.
Its lower bowidary is abrupt and wavy. Zone 8
(120-148 cm) is very dark gray to black exlremely
firm elayey sand wiUi medium moderate blocky
slructure and very few snail shell fragmenl,. Small
calcium carbonate nodules occur in the upper
portion of the zone, and brown to pink lenticular
freshwater marls with an age of 9520 ± IW B.P.

1-3 (0-70 cm) consist of loose to firm silt loam
At least two layers of welllaminated sands and possibly a third thin sand lens
within the upper three zones mark temporary road
surfaces used during construction of the ditch.
Very similar deposits were observed washing off
the large >")JOil pile over the access road during the
fieldwork at the site. The association of buried
laminated sand layers with mnssive disturbance of
deposits clearly reflects an abnormal increase in
sediment supply. Zone 4 (70-76 cm) is very dark
grayish brown loam with weak medium blocky
structure that is separated from Zone 5 by a very
abrupt wavy lower boundary. Zone 5 (76-81 cm),
very dark gray extremely firm clay loam with dispersed brown marl deposits, also has a very abrupt
wavy lower boundary. Zone 6 is very dark grayish
brown firm loam with weak blocky structure and
a clear to abrupt wavy lower boundary. Zones 4-6
appear to be due to tweutieth-century agricultural
land-clearing activities and roughly correlate with
Zones 2-9 in llackhoe Trench I. Zone 7 (89100 cm) is very dark gray firm to extremely firm
clay loom with coarse strong blocky structure and
a gradual smooth lower boundary. This is probably
a truncated Btb horizon. Zone 8 (100-120 cm) is
grayish brown finn loam with weak blocky structure, common calcium carbonal£ nodules, and a
gradual smooth lower boundary. This is probably
a Ilkb horizon. A bulk humate sample from Zone
8 was dated to 1260 ± 80 B.P. (Beta-32197).
Zone 9 (120-135+ cm) is dark gray friable loam
with many calcium carbonate nodules. This llllkb
horizon is the pedogenically altered Beaumont
Formation.
Test Unit I has six zones (see Fig. 24). Zone
I (0-26 cm) consists of loose grayish brown silt
loam wid1 an abrupt smooth lower boundary. This
is construction fill (Zone la) and slopewash (Zone
lb, not visible on profiled wall of Test Unit 1).
Zone 2 (26-54 cm) is very dark gray finn loam
with fine to medium weak blocky structm:e. It sits
unconformabl y on Zone 3 and Zone 4 sediments;
small cracks were observed in Zone 2. Zone 3, at
54 cm, is a few millimeters thick and consists of
light gray laminated sands. This is a construction
road surface. Zone 4 (54-89 cm), very dark gray
firm to extremely firm loam, ii an Apb horizon that
has been compacted by ditch construction activities.
A bulk huruate sample from the top of Zone 4 was
dated to 10 ± 60 Il.P. (Beta-32196). Zone 5

extremely firm sandy clay with a few calcium
carbonate filaments and nodules comprises Zone
12, a Bkb horizon. Below 250 cm, pale brown silt
loam with few manganese e-0ncretions and strong
brown mottles forms a nee horizon on the upper
portion of the lleaumont Formation.
The sediment.I and radiocarbon dates indicate
that the zones above Zone 11 are due to historic
disturbance that dismptcd the sediment equilibrium
in this blowout. Some of the deposits between
Zones 2 and 8 are certainly due to land-moving
activities associated with vegetation clearing for
agricultural use of this area. The great age
(9520 B.P.) of the Zone 8 marl deposits is a
reflection of the age of the ground water from
which Uie carbonates fanned and not the age of
depositioo. The radiocarbon date from the Zone
9 clays agrees with a twentieth-century date for the
clearing of this land for agricultural pm:poses.
Thus the sediments in Backhoe Trench 1 indicate
that a soil formed on the Beaumont Formation and
Urnt this soil was covered by historic sediments.
Some of this historic sedimentation was by narurnl
ageuts, i.e., the Zone 9 clays, Zone 8 marls, and
Zone 5 marls, while other deposits above Zone II
may have been moved into the blowout by humans.
Test Unit 10 provides a geologic sequence
toward the edge of the deflationary basin (see Fig.
25). As with Backhoe Trench l, a series of upper
deposits (Zones 1-3) at D-43 cm was created by
construction of Ille ditcli itself. These three zones
consi>t of strongly sloping grayish brown to dHik
gray loam. 11iese sediments are slopcwash and/or
sediment mechanically packed on the sloping ditch
wall. TI1e lower bonndary of Zone 3 marks the
depth of diich construction disturbance. Zone 4
(43-70 cm) consists of very dark gray firm to
extremely firm loam with dispersed freshwater
marl deposits on an abrupt irregular lower boundary. This is an Ap horizon and probably correlates
to Zone 8 in Backhoe Trench 1 and reflects historic
agricultural land-clearing activities and ponding in
the early twentieth century. Zone 4 sits unconformably on Zone 5 (70--108 cm), which consists
of very dark gray firm loam with a few calcium
carbonate filaments. This buried A horizon (Ab)
grades down to dark grayish brown firm to friable
loam in Zone 6 (108-128+ cm), a Bb horizon.
Nine zones were identified in Test Unit 7, but
the upper six appear to be the result of agricultural
activities or ditch construction (see Fig. 24). Zones

(89-124 cm), dark grayish brown firm loom with
medium moderate blocky structure, is a buried A
horiwn that is probably cumulative. Numerous
cracks cm an ale from the upper surface of Zone 4
and extend down into Zone 5. Zone 6 (124145+ cm) is grayish brown firm clay loam with
medium moderate blocky stmcture. This is a Bb
horizon.
The general sedimentary sequence at
41WY112 begins with the upper portion of the
Beaumont Fonnation which has been altered by
Pedogenesis. A date on bulk hnmates from the
lower portion of the soil formed on top of the
Beaumont in Test Unit 7 (Beta-32197) suggests
that Ibis soil began to form by 1260 B.P. Other
dates on bulk humates from the top of this soil in
Backhoe Trench I (Beta-31672) and Test Unit I
(Bela-32196) suggest lbalit continued to fonn and
accumulate tluough modem times. All of the
sediments ubove this soil either date to the twentieth century or were extensively modified by historic
clearing, agricultural activities. or ditch construction. In the central portion of the basin, thick
sedimentation has occurred, some of which reflects
exlensive ponding in the basin. All dates and
temporally diagnostic data support a historic age
for these pond deposits.

and consolidates previously undisturbed deposits
along the access road. Feature I is identified as
the lowennost in the sequence of sutfaccs and is
present in Test Units I, 3, and 5-9. There llfe al
least two additional surfaces related lo ditch
mainrenance operations above Feature I with
disturbed, compacted deposits appearing between
the surfaces. These activities have resulted in a
substantial amount of artificial deposition along the
dileh.
Materials Reco•ered

A total of 32 artifacts consisting of l trianglular projectile point, 1 bifacc, I edge-modified
flake, and 29 pieces of debitage was recovered
during the Phase II investigations. The test unit
excavations produced 15 flakes in the 1/4-inchmesh screens and 10 flakes in the 1/16-inch-mesh
screens. An additional seven artifacts were
collccled from the surface.
Other materials
collected include burned clay lumps, charcoal,
mussel shells, bones, snail shells, manganese
concretions. calcium c!llbonate concretions, siliceous pebbles, and modem materials (see Appendix
A),

Discussion
Feature
The cultural materials recovered from
41WY112 are insufficient to allow meaningful
interpretation of the components represented. The
vertical distribution of artifacts demonstrates that
there are intact cultural materials present within the
thin, undisturbed Holocene deposits, but the sparse
nature of the artifacts does not permit further
temporal assessmenL ln addition, no diagnostic
cultural materials were recovered; however, the age
of the cumulative soil places the earliest possible
occupations al Ibis sire in the Late Prehistoric
period. The sparseness of the cultural materials
suggests noninrensive use of the site.

The single cultural feature identified at
41WY112 represents a modem road surface related
to the drainage ditch construction and maintenance
operations (Fig. 25). Two pieces of dcbitage were
found lying I em above Ibis surface, and it was
initially thought to be a possible prehistoric feature.
Further investigation, however, identified Ibis
surface as a product of drainage ditch activities.
It consists of a series of ca. I-mm-thick fine sand
and silt lenses, ca. 1--<:m in total thickness. The
surfa1>e is compacted and cracked, and it rwghly
follows U1e modem topography. These laminated
sand lenses were eroded by slopewash from
sediments disturbed during ditch construction. As
described in Chapter I, oue commou acxess road
maintenance operation consists of a road grader
cleaning out a small ru1>--off ditch between the road
and the spoil pile. This dirt is moved to the edge
of the bank and is used to maintain the bcnn, This
mainrenanee operation not only adds an additional
sequence of deposits to the berm but also truncates

Site Setting
Site 4!WY113 is located east of Lyford,
Texas, along the South Main Channel approximately 0.6 km east of the intersection of FM 2099
and the drainage ditch. It is at an elevation of

25-30 ft msl and is exposed on the north bank of
the drainage ditch (Fig. 26). Adjacent to the site
is a small, shallow depression in a cultivated field.
The surrounding area is presently under cultivation,
and land leveling and plowing undoubtedly disturbed the surface prior to ditch construction.

41WY113 was assessed as possibly eligible for
listing on the National Register of Historic Places
based on the presence of the partially intact human
burial and wcll-preseived animal bones.

Previous Investigations

The testing efforts at 41WY113 consisted of
a magnetometer suivey and the excavation of two
backhoe trenches and four 1x1-m test units (Fig.
covered a
27).
The magnetometer SUIVey
100x9-m area along the ditch access road between
the bank and the spoil pile; three weak anomalies
were identified. The clearest anomaly was investigated and was found to be a compacted surface
resulting from the use of heavy equipment to
maintain the access roads (see Appendix B). A
surface suivey was undertaken to locate cultural

Work Accomplished

When this site was discovered during the 1986
survey (Hall et al. 1987: 109), a partial skeleton of
a young adolescent human, numerous mammal
bones, several burned clay lumps, four mussel
shell fragments, and one piece of glass were noted.
All of the materials were exposed along the north
bank of the drainage ditch. The site was estimated
to extend 160 m cast-west along the ditch bank,
and the depth was recorded as ca. 40 cm. Site

materials, and an WlSuccessful attempt was made
to relocate the original position of the human burial
removed in 1986(Halletal. 1987:193-196). Four
test wtits ranging in depth from 55 to 104 cm were
excavated to investigate the magnetometer anomaly
and to expose two bone features (Table 11). Test
Units 1-3 were excavated into the Beaumont
Fonnation. and the founh unit reached the top of
the Beaumont Fonnation. Two backhoe trenches
ranging in depth from 250 to 300 cm were excavated on either end of the site to investigate the geomO!phology. Sediment and humate samples were
collected for later processing. The fieldwork on
41WY113 was completed in 18 person-days.

Prehistoric artifacts were recovered from two
of the four test units (see Table 11). Based on the
surface artifacts and eitcavated materials, the
known site area is a 10x80-m strip along the
drainage ditch. The cultural materials arc contained in a 50-cm-thick (maximum) zone of
undisturbed deposits where one feature and four
flakes were found. Two shon-tcnn occupations
may be present at this site. As Table 12 demonstrates, a possible upper cultural zone may exist in
Level 2 of Test Unit 2 where three flakes were
recovered from undisturbed sediments. A possible

on the souU1east side of a small circular deflationary basin positioned within an ancient abandoned
channel on the present surface of the Beaumont
Formation (see Fig. 8). This basin is not as deep
as the one at 41WY112, but it probably held
surface water on a seasonal basis before the ditch
was constructed.
As at 41WY112, the soils in this area reflect
ancient and recent geological history (Fig. 28).
Surrounding the deflationary basin are the
Racombes and Hidalgo sandy clay loams U1at
formed on alluvial overbank deposits of the
Beaumont Formation. 111e soils in the blowout at
41WYI 13 consist of Tiocano clays. Sandy eolian
sediments occur on the west, south, and east sides
of the blowout, but these are not all derived from
the blowout at 4!WY 113 as numerous others occur
nearby. Willimar and Lozano fine sandy loams
have formed on these eolian sandy sediments, and
within this century, these eolian deposits have been
spread and flattened by agricultural practices. In
short, near 41WY113 as in most areas, the
Beaumont Formation is speckled with small
deflationary basins in ancient abandoned river
channels. All of these wind-eroded basins are
ringed by eolian deposits. The uneroded Beaumont
Formation consists of sandy clay loams from which
wind has removed the coarser sandy sediments and
left clay loams in the blowouts.
The geological sequence here is based on
observations and radiocarbon dates from the two
backhoe trenches and four test units. Detailed
profile descriptions for all backhoe trenches and
selected test units are provided in Appendix C, and
four selected profiles are discussed here.
The upper 34 cm (Zone I) of Backhoe Trench
l consists of pale brown sand which is berm
constrnction fill (Fig. 29). At 34-35 cm, Zone 2
is a lens of pale brown silt loam that pinches out
in the profile away (i.e., to the north) from the
ditch bank. This is also related to ditch construction. Zone 3 (35-70 cm) is dark grayish brown
loam with medium to coarse moderate platy to
blocky strncture. The structure in this zone has
been altered by compaction during ditch constrnction and/or by plowing. This is an Apb horizon.
Zone 4 (70-100 cm) is dark grayish brown firm silt
loam with medium moderate blocky strncture and
common calcium carbonate nodules. This is a Bk
horizon. Calcium carbonate nodules increase in
Zone 5 (100-215 cm), which consists of friable

second, lower cultural zone was identified in
Levels 5 and 6 of Test Unit 2. This consists of
Feature I (deer bones and a bone tool) and one
flake. The human burial recovered in 1986 appears
to have been excavated from roughly the same
stratigraphic position as the deer bones, but radiocarbon dates imply that the human burial is
younger. Thus, it may be associated with U1e
overlying artifacts or represent a third intermediate
episode of use at 41WY113.
Artifacts were recovered to 66 cm below the
surface, but at least 16 cm of this thickness is
disturbed historic fill. Five of the eight artifacts
recovered are from in situ deposits, resulting in a
density of 1.25 artifacts/m'. Even though two
features were recovered from this site, the artifact
density is extremely low.
Sediments and Radiocarbon Chronology

Site 41WY113 occurs on the Beaumont
Formation (Bureau of Economic Geology 1976).
Holz and Prewitt's (1981) analysis of abandoned
Beaumont Formation channels and modem wind
deflated basins demonstrates that U1is site occurs

nodules. Zone 4 grades into Zone 5. Zone 5
extends below 250 cm and consists of brown silt
loam with many fine distinct strong brown mottles,
granular structure, and a few calcium carbonate
nodules. This is a I!Ck horizon.
The upper 4 cm of Test Unit 1 consist of pale
brown very thin horizontally laminated sands with
an abrupt smooth lower boundary (sec Fig. 29).
This Zone 1 is very recent slopewash from the
large spoil pile a few meters north of the test unit.
Zone 2 (4-21 cm) is pale brown sandy loam with
granular structure, common rootlets, and an abrupt
wavy lower boundary. This zone also is slope-·
wash, but it appears to have been compacted and
to be old enough for grasses to have developed a
thick root system. The lower boundary slopes

away from the ditch and clearly marks a road
surface used during construction of the ditch. This
section of the ditch was dug before 1984 and the
road surface probably dates to this event. Zone 3
(21-38 cm) is very dark gray extremely firm loam
with medium strong blocky stmcturc and a gradual
smooth lower boundary. The upper surface of this
Apb horizon has been truncated and compacted by
construction activities. Zone 4-.(38-67 cm) is very
dark grayish brown firm loam with few calcium
carbonate filaments and nodules that increase in
frequency down-profile. This is an ABb horizon.
Zone 4 grades into Zone 5 (67-110+), dark
yellowish brown friable silt loam with common
calcium carbonate nodules. Zone 5 is a I!Bk
horizon.

C haprer 5: Site Descriptions

Test Unit 2 has only three stratigraphic zones
(Fig. 30). Zone 1 (G-23 cm) is very dark grayish
brown friable to loose loam with small. very dark
gray and yellowish brown clay loam clasts. The
lower boundary is abrupt and very wavy due to
erosion. This zone is mostly thin (0-J cm) as seen
in the side wall profile (see Fig. 30) but extends
down to 23 cm in an erosional rill in the back wall.
This is construction fill. Zone 2 (23-61 cm), an
ABb horizon, is dark brown extremely firm loam
wilh medium moderate blocky structure and a few
calcium carbonate nodules tliat increase in frequency down-profile. The lower boundary of Zone
2 is gradual and smooth. Zone 3 (61-JOO+ cm) is
yellowish brown silty loam with common calcium
carbonute nodules. This is a llBk horizon.
A bulk humate sample and a deer radius from
near the bottom of Zone 2 in Test Unjt 2 were
radiocarbon dated. The humate assay resulted in
an age of 2740 ± 100 B.P. (Bela-32199). Two
radiocarbon dales were obtained from the deer
bones. The inorganic fraction was dated to 3040 ±
235 B.P. (GX-15122-A). The gelatin fraction was
dated by the AMS method, resulting in an age of
2560 ± JOO B.P. (GX-15122-G). The human
burial excavated in 1986 from near the bottom of
this zone yielded a radiocarbon age from the
inorganic fraction of 1830 ± 210 B.P. (GX-15123A). The organic fraction of the burial was also
dated by the AMS method yielding an age of
1088 ±90 B.P, (GX-15123-G). Unfortunately, the
exact location of tl1is burial was not recorded, but
photographs show the geneml stratigraphic position
to be in the lower portion of Zone 2. The younger
age of the burial suggests that it was placed in a
pit dug down into this zone, but the pit was not
discernible during excavation.

consisting of three long bones and several bone
fragments which represent ut least two mature deer.
The long bones and fragments are identified as one
complete left radius, two left radius proximal
fragments, one right metacarpal, and numerous
metacarpal fragments (see Appendix A). The
bones appear to be lying on or near the contact with
Zone 3. No pit outline or soil change was noted
other than the contact with the Beaumont Fonnation. There is no direct evidence that this feature
is cultural. The surrounding soil contains calcium
carbonute filaments, and calcium carbonate has
formed on portions of the booes obscuring cut
marks if these are present. However, indirect
evidence suggests that this feature is the result of
prehistoric cultural activities. A modified bone
found with the deer bone may represent a fragment
of a compound fishhook (see Appendix A).
Additionally, one flake was recovered from the
arbitrary level associated with Feature 1.
Although the location of the burial recovered
from this site (Hall et al. 1987:193-197) remains
wicertain, it does seem clear that Feature 1 was not
associated with the burial. Figure 31 shows that
the two features were found at similar depths, with
the burial occurring at29-38 cm below the original
ground surface (Howard 1987:193) and Feature I
al 5(}-60 cm below the modem surface or 3444 cm below the original ground surface. But the
radiocarbon dating of bone samples from both
indicates that the burial is significantly younger
than the deer bones (Students t test of samples
GX-15122-G and GX-15123-A:
I = 3.14,
p<0.005). In addition, a humate sample taken from
the same provenience as Feature 1 yielded a radiocarbon age of 2740 ± 100 years Il.P., roughly
coeval with the deer bones but clearly older than
the burial. This suggests that the burial was placed
in a pit, but the outline of the pit was obfuscated
by later pedogenesis and possible bioturbation.
Feature 2 is a recent bone dump consisting of
numerous animal bone fragments lying on the surface of the drainage bank. Test Unit 4 was excavated lo investigate this feature and revea!C<I
fragmentary bones at ca. 20 cm downslope from
the modem road. These bone fragments are a
result of slopewasb. Several recent bone dumps
were noted along the drainage banks including a
recent javalina carcass found during the magnetometer survey.
According to local residents,
dumping animal remains along the ditch banks is
cormnon.

Features
Two cultural features were recorded during the
Phase II investigations. Feature 1, a small amount
of deer booe, is prehistoric, while Feature 2 is a
modem bone dump; both were exposed along tl1e
drainage bank.
Feature 1 was observed eroding out of the
base of the undisturbed sediments just above the
contact with the Beaumont Fonnation at 50-60 cm
below tlie modem surface (see Fig. 30). Test Units
2 and 3 were excavated to reveal a slightly
disturbed feature measuring ca. 25x 15 cm and

occupations of limited duration at this location. A
possible third occupation may be rellected in the
fine-screen debitage from Level 2 of Test Unit 2,
although these artifacts could be associated with the
burial or might be in a secondary context resulting
from historic disturbances. TI1e fact that so few
cultural materials are present suggests very brief
and limited use of this site.

Eight artifacts and one prehistoric bone feature
were recovered from this site. One bone tool and
five pieces of debitage were recovered from the
excavations, and two bifaces were recovered in
surface contexts from the spoil pile and bank slope.
Other materials observed include burned clay
lumps, charcoal, freshwater mussel shell fragments,
snail shells and fragments, bones, gypsum, calcium
carbonate and manganese concretions, siliceous
pebbles, and modem debris (see Appendix A).

Site Setting
Discussion
Site 41WYl34 is located cast of Lyford,
Texas, along the South Main Channel approximately 2.7 km southwest of the intersection of FM
1420 and FM 498. It is at an elevation of 20 ft
ms! and is located along the north bank of the
drainage ditch (Fig. 32). The site lies on the south
side of a shallow depression and probably

Because of the sparse nature of the cultural
materials and the lack of diagnostic artifacts at
41WYll3, it is difficult to identify cultural
components. However, the radiocarbon dates from
the burial and tl1e deer bones, with tl1eir probable
prehistoric cultural association and associated

continues northward into cultivated fields. Agricultural activities, land leveling, and ditch construction have undoubtedly disturbed the Holocene
deposits.

Work Accomplished
The Phase II testing efforts at site 41WY134
consisted of excavating two backhoe trenches and
four lxl-m test units (Fig. 33). A surface survey
.was conducted to locate cultural materials, but none
were found. Two test units were placed adjacent
to the backhoe trenches , and two additional test
units were placed between them (Table 13). All
test units were excavated into the upper portion of
the Beaumont Formation. The two backhoe
trenches excavated at either end of the site for the
geomorphological investigations and to provide
stratigraphic controls for the test units were 250 cm
deep. The fieldwork at 41WY134 was completed
in 24 person-days.

Previous Investigations

This site was discovered by Elton R. Prewitt
and Carolyn Good in 1985 and recorded during the
1986 survey (Hall et al. · 1987:123). Materials
observed include 5 pieces of debitage, 19 bone
fragments, 7 burned clay lumps, 2 marine shell
fragments, and 1 fish otolith exposed along the
north bank of the drainage ditch. The site was
estimated to extend 250 m north-south, an unknown
distance east-west along the ditch, and an unknown
depth below surface. It was assessed as being
possibly eligible for listing on the National Register
of Historic Places based on the density and variety
of artifacts.

Apparently most of the artifacts and numerous
burned clay lumps observed in l 986 were along the
edge of the depression in the plowed field north of
the ditch. As the testing efforts were confined to
the drainage right-of-way, ~1e plowed fields to the
north, i.e., the actual location of the site, were not
investigated. It is clear, however, that 41WYl34

carbonate nodules. Tiiis is a l!Blk horizon formed
on Beaumont Formation sediments. Z-Olle 5 grades
imperceptibly into Zone 6 (235-250+ c1n), a light
brown lo brown friable silt loam with a few
calcium carbonate nodules and mnngcmese concretions. Zone 6 is a I!Ckc horizon.
Backhoe Trench 2 has six wnes as well (see
Fig. 35). Zone 1 (0-56 cm) is grayish brown loose
silt loam with an abrupt irregular lower boundary.
This is construction fill. Zone 2 (56-72 cm) is
very dark gray firm silt loam with coarse moderate
blocky structure and clasts of black silt loam from
Zooe 3. This zooe is due to land leveling associated with vegetation clearing and farming and is
classified as nn Apb horizon. Zooe 3 (72-100 cm)
is black firm silt loam. It has fine to medium
moderate blocky structure witi1 thin clay films on
ped faces, many fine calcium carbouate filaments,
rare calcium carbonate nodules that increase downprofile, and a gradual smooth lower boundary.
This is a lruncated ABLkb horizon. Zone 4 (100125 cm) is a dark gray firm silt loam with medium
moderate blocky structure, very thin clay films on
ped faces, common calcium carbonate filaments,
and few calcium carbonate nodules that gradually
incrnase down-profile. The lower bolllldary is
diffuse, and the zone is classified as a Blk horizon.
Zone5 (125-165 cm) is grayish brown friable clay
loam with medium moderate blocky structure,
common calcium carbonate nodules and filaments,
rare manganese concretions, and a gradual smooth
lower bound111y. Zone 5 is a llB lkc horizon formed
on the weathered Beaumont Formation. Z-Olle 6
(165-250+ cm) is light brown clay loam with less
clay than Zone 5. It has weak medium blocky
structure, a few calcite crystals, and a few calcium
carbonate nodules, some of which are surrounded
by light brownish gray clayey mottles. Tbls is a
IlCkc horizon.
Test Unit I has three zones (see Fig. 35).
Zone 1 (0-48 cm) is very dark gray loose loam
witii elasts of very dark gray sandy loam and
yellowish brown clay loam. This is construction
fill; three layers of well-laminated sands mark
temporary surfaces in the fill. Zone 2 (48-75 cm)
is very dark gray extremely firm loam with strong
fine granular structure. Also present are rare
calcium carbonate nodules and snail shells. The
lower boundary is gradual and smooth. This zone
is classified as an Apb horizon. Zone 3 (7598+ cm) is grayish brown firm loam with weak

Sediments
Site 41WYl34 occurs on the southern upper
slopes of a moderate-size circular deflationary
basin within fill ancient abandoned channel on the
present surface of the Beaumont Formation (see
Fig. 8). This basin is not as deep as the ones at
41WY112 or 41WY113, cmd the modem soil
distribution suggests that this area has been less
intensively eroded by wind. The soils in the basin
near 41WYl34 are sandy clay loams, and most of
the relatively uneroded Beaumont Formation
surface consists of sandy clay loams as well (Fig.
34). This is the easternmost site investigated and
it is nearest to the active dunes along the coast and
in the sand sheet. It is possible that an active dune
blew through the depression cmd left a trail of sand
or more sand may be present in this portion of the
Beaumont Formation than occurs farther west at the
other sites. The sediments in both backhoe trenches
and ooe test unit are described below.
Backhoe Trench 1 has six zones (Fig. 35).
Zone 1 (0-42 cm) is gray loose clay loam with a
very abrupt irregular lower boundary. This is
construction fill. Zone 2 (42-75 cm) is very dark
gray firm silt loam with a few small calcium
carbonate filaments. The lower boundary is very
abrupt and irregular. This is a disturbed and
compacted plow zone, and it is classified as an
Apb horizon. Zone 3 (75-tl2 cm) is very dark
grayish brown very firm silt loam with fiue strong
blocky structure cmd well--Oeveloped ped faces with
clay films. A few calcite crystals were observed
on ped faces. This is a truncated ABb horizon with
a diffuse and smooth lower boundary. Zone 4 is
grayish brown firm clay loam with medium
moderate blocky structure and thin clay films on
ped faces. Calcium carbonate nodules are common, and a few manganese concretions were
observed. The lower boundary is smooth nnd
diffuse. Zone 4 is classified as a Btkc horizon.
Zone 5 (170-235 cm) is light brown friable clay

No radiocarbon dates were obtained from
41 WY134, however, the site has consistent stratigraphy and correlations are clear. A soil has formed
on tl1e Beaumont Formation sediments, and it is
likely that it is truncated. A more recent soil has
formed over this older soil, and it appears to be
cumulative.
If wind-blown sediments were
deposited in the depression as interpreted from the

soil maps, then this could be the primary source of
the materials in the cumulative soil. The upper
portion of this recent soil has been altered by
agricultural activities and tl1en covered by landfill
probably introduced lo provide a dry access road
adjacent lo the ditch.

possibility for the lack of cultural materials is that
they were present in the upper portion of the
Holocene deposits (i.e., Z-0ne 2) along the ditch
banks that were truncated and redeposited by

snail shells, bones, calcium carbonate concretions,
gypsum, silicious pebbles, and modem debris (see
Appendix A). Because of the lack of cultural
materials, the investigations were limited, and
sediment and humatc samples were not collected.
Discussion

41WY140

The previous work at 41WY134 recovered five
lithic artifacts, but the testing efforts did not reveal
any additional surface or buried cultural materials.
The original plotting of the site and the general
discussion of tlie materials collected during the
survey suggest that 41WYl34 is located primarily
outside of the ditch right-of-way along the edge
of the natural depression in a cultivated field. As
areas outside of tlie drainage ditch right-of-way
were not tested, the extent of the cultural deposits
in and around the depression is unknown. Another

Site Setting
Site 41WY 140 is located southwest of Lyford,
Texas, along the SouU1 Main Channel approximately 1.2 km southwest of tlie intersection of
FM 491 and FM 448. It is al an elevation of 3035 ft ms! along the west bank of the drainage ditch
adjacent to a small rise swrnundcd by cultivated
fields (Fig. 36).

Previous Investigations

Work Accomplished

The site was discovered by Elton R. Prewitt
and Carolyn Good in 1985 and recorded during the
1986 suivey (Hall et al. 1987: 127). The materials
obseived included 3 pieces of debitage, 12 bone
fragments, at least 2 burned clay lumps, and
numerous mussel shell fragments. lllC site was
reported lo occur al 100-150 cm below modem
surface with another possible cultural zone at 200300 cm: the horiz.ontal extent was estimated lo be
150 m north-south along tl1e ditch. Site 41WY140
was assessed as probably eligible for listing on the
National Register of Historic Places based on the
possible stratified nature of the cultural deposits
and Ille unusual depth at which tl1ey occur.

The Phase II investigations at 41WY140
consisted of the excavation of two backhoc trenches
and four 1.xl-m test units (Fig. 37). Table 14
summarizes Ille work accomplished. All of the test
units were excavated into the Beaumont Formation.
111e two backhoe trenches were excavated at botll
ends of the site to investigate the geology and to
provide stratigraphic controls for the test unit
excavations. 111e fieldwork at 41WY140 was
completed in seven person-days.

have been recovered from the same stratigraphic
position in this region (Westgate 1987:200-219).
Four stratigraphic zones were identified at
Backhoe Trench 2 (see Fig. 39). Zone 1 (0-5 cm)
is grayish brown firm silt loam with platy structure
and an abrupt irregular lower boundary. This zone
has been altered and compacted by construction
activities. Zone 2 (5-40 cm) is dark grayish brown
extremely finn silt loam with moderate coarse
blocky structure and common calcium carbonate
nodules. This zone is a truncated IIBkl horizon.
Zone 3 (40-105 cm) consists of brown silt loam
with moderate coarse blocky structure and very
many calcium carbonate nodules. This is a 11Bk2
horizon. Zone4 (105-180+ cm) is pale brown clay
loam with medium moderate blocky structure and
clay films on ped faces. Calcium carbonate
nodules occur but decrease sharply down-profile.
This zone is classified as a IICk horizon.
In summary, the sediments indicate that a
truncated soil exists on Beaumont Fonnation
sediments. 1bis soil was defmitely truncated by
ditch construction and possibly by slope erosion of
the natural rise as well. All of the deposits appear
to be pedogenically altered Beaumont Fonnation,
and this implies that the prehistoric cultural remains
are not in primary archeological or geological
contexts. The turtle remains from near the present
top of the soil were dated to 9360 B.P., indicating
that they are not contemporary with the Beaumont
Formation.

Sediments and Radiocarbon Chronology

Site 41WY140 is the only one tested during
the current investigations that is on a low rise
instead of in a depression on the Beaumont Formation (Bureau of Eccnomic Geology 1976). Holz
and Prewitt's (1981) analysis shows that the site is
at the tip of a linear wedge of alluvial overbank
deposits between two abandoned channels on the
Beaumont surface (see Fig. 8, Fig. 38). The
modem soil type is Racombes sandy clay loam
which often develops on Beaumont Formation
alluvial overbank deposits (Turner 1982). The
sediments observed in the backhoe trenches are
described below.
Backhoe Trench 1 has four zones (Fig. 39).
Zone 1 (0-5 cm) is dark grayish brown silt loam.
11tls construction fill shows a clear irregular lower
boundary. Zone 2 (5-80 cm) is dark grayish brown
extremely firm silt loam with platy structure in the
upper 10 cm due to mechanical compaction. Below
the compacted portion, it changes to medium strong
blocky structure with well-developed ped faces and
common calcium carbonate nodules that increase
in frequency down-profile. Manganese concretions
occur also. Zone 2 is a IIBkcl horiwn. Zone 3
(80-150 cm) is light brown extremely firm clay
loam with medium moderate blocky structure, very
many calcium carbonate nodules, and a gradual
smooth lower boundary. Zone 3 is a IIBkc2
horizon. Zone 4 (150+ cm) was observed only in
the large drainage ditch. It is similar to Zone 3
except that it has less clay and calcium carbonate
nodules are not present. 1bis is a IIC horizon.
Large, thick tortoise shell fragments were
recovered in situ from undisturbed Zone 2 deposits
l m south of Backhoe Trench 1 on the sloping
surface of the ditch at 70-80 cm below the surface.
The inorganic (apatite) fraction of the shell fragments yielded a radiocarbon age of 9360 ± 415
B.P. (GX-15125-A). This tortoise is probably the
extinct giant species Gopherus hexagonatus as
numerous other tortoise remains of this species

Materials Recovered

Two pieces of debitage were recovered during
the testing phase, one from the 1/4-inch screen and
one from 1/16-inch screen. No diagnostic artifacts
were recovered. Other materials obseived include
charcoal, snail shells, bones, calcium carbonate
concretions, gypsum, siliceous pebbles, and modem
debris including siliceous flakes from bank stabilizing materials (see Appendix A).
Discussion

The geomorphologic investigations identified
a truncated soil on the Beaumont Fonnation. The
test unit excavations recovered two prehistoric
artifacts from the upper portion of this soil. As
this is a stable or possibly erosional surface rather

cultural resources at this site suggested the possibility of deep ocaapatioos, but it is clear that these

well. This displacement could be due to soil

cracking, biotwbation, agricultural activities, or
dilcb coosblletion. Thus, all of the cultural materials collected at 41WY140 are believed to be from

PALEOENVIRONMENTS AND HUMAN DIETS

6

by C. Britt Bousman

In order to provide the contextual background
necessary for understanding prehistoric human
behavior in South Texas, both paleoenvironmental
and human dietary information must be collected
from as many sources as possible. In U1is chapter,
stable isotopes have been used to provide evidence
of both. More and more geologists, paleoclimatologists, and archeologists are using stable
isotopes (especially carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen)
for documenting past environments, climatic
changes, and human dietary patterns. The sites
discussed in this report generally have poorly
preserved organic remains, and stable isotope
analysis provides an avenue of environmental and
dietary reconstruction U1at is unavailable from
other sources. Stable carbon, nitrogen, or oxygen
isotopes were measured on samples of bones,
pedogenic calcium carbonate nodules, a freshwater
limestone (marl), and bulk soil humates collected
for radiocarbon dating during this project, and
these provide evidence of changing climate, plant
communities, and human diets in South Texas.
The radiocarbon dates are introduced in U1e site
descriptions sections of Chapter 5, while an
analysis of the isotopic information is presented
below. This provides a direct quantitative estimate of Pleistocene and early Holocene climate in
South Texas and provides a view of late Holocene
environmental change. Limited fauna! remains
provide additional data on early Holocene environments. Dietary reconstructions through isotopic
analyses have far-reaching applications and

implications for many aspects of human prehistory
that are unavailable from other sources. Amassing
environmental and dietary data ultimately will
allow modeling efforts, such as presented in
Chapter 3, to become more dynamic with time
trajectories and thus more robust and explanatory.
LATE PLEISTOCENE AND HOLOCENE
PALEOENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE

Virtually nothing is known about how human
behavior was influenced and conditioned by
climatic and environmental changes in the Lower
Rio Grande Valley of Texas. One of the four
major goals of the archeological investigations
conducted for the Hidalgo-Willacy Drainage Ditch
project is to fill Uris gap. The success of completing U1e other major goals of the project
depends on obtaining paleoenvironmental and
climatic data for the period of human habitation.
Many types of paleoenvironmental data can be
found in archeological sites, and careful documentation of the geology, often accompanied by
analyses of pollen and fauna! samples, is traditionally undertaken to assess environmental change
during U1e period of occupation. However, it is
unlikely that the highly weathered sediments
observed in U1e sites discussed here have preserved pollen, and, as fauna! remains are scarce,
other sources of paleoenvironmental and climatic
data were sought. It was determined that stable
isotopes in soil humates and calcium carbonates

91

Prehistoric Archeology and Pa/eoen•irownelt/s in Hidalgo and Willacy Counties

"c, occurs in greater relative abundance in C4
plants than in C3 plants, and thus the isotopic
difference between C3 and C4 plants can be measured accurately with mass spcclrometers. A thifd
group, CAM pl!lllts, has the ability to switch back
and forth between the two photosynthetic pathways
in response to climatic variables, but a study of
the most common CAM plants in South Texas,
prickly pear and agave, suggests that these pl!lllts
normally use a C, pathway (Elckmeier and Bender
1976). In the discussion below, CAM plants are
combined with C4 plants for isotopic analysis.
The measurement of carbon isotope ratios is
calibrated from the "C/"C ratio in a piece of
marine belemnite limestone from the Pee Dec
Formation in South Carolina. As this marine
limestone, known as the PDB standard, has an
enormons amount or "C in relation to 12C, measurements from most terrestrial sources such as
living plants result in negative numbers. The
difference between a 13C/ 1"C ratio and the PDB
standard is represented by 6 13C and is expressed
in parts per thousand or "/oo, The preindustrial
atmospheric 6 13C value is estimated at -6.0 °/oo;
C, plants have much less 1'C, and their average
6 13 Cvalue is approximately-27 '/~; C, and CAM
plants have more 13C, and tlieir average 6 "C value
is near -13 °/oo, i.e., it is higher but heavier,
reflecting more 1'C. In materials that represent 3II
accumulation of both types of plllilts, the 6 "C
value should range between -27 "/oo and -13 °/00,
and, given no further chemical changes, the specific value should reflect the relative biomass conlrlbution of C, and C, plants. Unfortunately, further
chemical changes, known as fractionation effects,
do occur in most materials such a.q soils, calcium
carbonate nndules, and bones, and this complicates
the picture. In fact, the assimilation of carbon
isotopes into plant biomass Urrough the process of
photosynthesis is the first major fractionation step.
Thus, C4 plants have fractionated the atmospheric
source to a lesser extent than have C, plants. As
carbon isotopes pass from plants into animuls,
soils, and other materials, additional fractionation
sleps occur, and the degree of fractionation chllilge
varies by material. The following discussion of
carbon isotopes and fractionation is organized by
material: however, all stable isotopes undergo
fractionation due to unequal moss weights, and it
is diis process that allows meaningful stable
isotope analysis.

would provide the most accurate and accessible
sources or such data available from these sites.
Below is llil analysis or the stable isotope data
that relates direcU y to climatic changes 3Ild paleoenvironments.
Curbon Isotopes

Most researchers argue that increases in
13

Cf 1'C ratios provide a measure or chaoge in C,

3Ild CAM plant versus C, plant composition in the
overall biota (Stuiver 1975; Flexor and Volkoff
1977; Vogel 1978: Krishnamurthy et al. 1982:
Cerling 1984; Dzurec et al. 1985; Cerling and Hay
1986; Haas et al. 1986; Nakai and Koyama 1987;
Schwartz et al. 1987; Volkoff and Cerri 1987;
Natelhoffer and Fry 1988; Guillet et al. 1988;
Cerling et al. 1989; Vitorello et al. 1989). All
trees and many shrubs aod grasses are C 3 plants,
some grasses and herbaceous plnnts such as
Cheno-ams are C., llild most succulents, including
cacti, are CAM plllilts. The photosynthetic pathway used nnd the chemical composition or the
energy molecules prodaced distinguish C, and C,
plants. Plants of the C, group use the CalvinBenson photosyntlietic pathway, which produces a
lhree-carbon molecule, while C, plants use the
Hatch-Slack pathway, with a four--crubon molecule as the resulting product.
During the production or these three- or
four-carbon molecules, the plant may use either or
the two stable carbon isotopes, 13C or 1'C. These
two isotopes of carbon do not chnnge, i.e., decompose, into other clements as does 14 C, and they are
readily available in the atmogphere. Because or
the slight weight differences in the two stable
carbon isotopes, the chemical reactions and physical processes in the two photosynthetic pathways
utilize 1'C and 12 C in slightly different ratios.
Lighter isotopes have higher vibrational frequencies, form weaker bonds, and are more reactive in
chemical processes than heavier isotopes. The C,
and C, pathways have the same basic chemical
steps but the C, pathway has additional steps
allowing it to more efficiently use all the available
carbon. TI1is has two effects. First, C, plants are
more resistaot Lo water stress but less capable of
withstanding cold temperatures, especially minimum temperatures druing the growing season.
Consequently, C,JC4 plant ratios reflect paleoc!imatic parameters. Second, die heavier isotope,

92

Chapter 6 : Paleoenvironments and Human Diets

decrease c5 13C values toward the 6 13C of the
organic material, while decomposition tends to
increase these values. Since decomposition has
the final fractionation effect, this must be considered in paleoenvironmental reconstructions.
Illuviation has a compounding effect on 6 13C
isotopes in sediments.
Several studies have
demonstrated shifts in the CJC4 composition of
biotic sources using a column of stable isotope
measurements, and it is clear that down-profile
leaching of organic materials, including stable
isotopes, occurs (Dzurec et al. 1985; Volkoff and
Cerri 1987; Vitorello et al. 1989). In radiocarbon
dating of sediments, the concept of mean residence
time (MRT) is used to express the mixed source
and time span represented by 14C in a sample.
This concept is applicable to c5 13C values obtained
from sediments as well. The implication is that
sediment 6 13C values represent a time span potentially composed of multiple events, and the resulting measurement is an average of these events.
The 6 13C value of soil carbonate clearly
reflects illuviated carbon and is related to the
isotopic composition of the soil atmosphere,
which, in tum, is controlled by the biomass ratio
of CJC4 plants growing on the surface and soil
respiration rates (Cerling 1984:233). As noted
above, the 6 13 C value of atmospheric carbon is
-6.0 °/oo. As the 12C and 13C isotopes in carbon
dioxide have different atomic weights, they also
have different diffusion rates through the soil
atmosphere. This results in a fractionation shift in
soil carbon dioxide from the soil organic matter.
The carbon isotopic ratio of the soil atmosphere
systematically becomes heavier (i.e., less negative) toward the surface because of soil respiration; however, isotopic gradients in most soils
stabilize below 30 cm. Freezing of soil to the
depth of carbonate precipitation can influence the
fractionation of carbon isotopes, but even during
the Last Glacial Maximum, it is doubtful that soil
freezing at such depths would have significantly
affected stable carbon isotope ratios in South
Texas. The following analysis assumes that an
equilibrium exists between the atmospheric and
soil organic carbon and that little or no inherited
carbon is present in the analyzed samples, i.e., the
carbon source is from plants. Previous research
on pedogenic carbonates in nonlimestone environments suggests that this is a valid assumption
(Cerling and Hay 1986). Cerling (1984:Table 1)

At least five factors are known to influence
isotopic composition of soil materials: (1) CJC4
composition of the biotic source; (2) differential
preservation of plant components such as lignin or
cellulose; (3) variations in plant mass inputs; (4)
decomposition of organic materials; and (5)
illuviation. In alluvial systems, transportation of
materials from nonlocal sources is a sixth possibility. 111e objective in most paleocnvironmental
reconstructions is lo detennine the CJC4 composition of the biotic source, but the other factors
must be considered.
Differential preservation of plant components
could hypothetically complicate the c5 13C values in
sediments. Lignin, which is acid-insoluble fiber,
is more resistant to decomposition than arc the
water-soluble components (e.g., aminos, sugars,
and starches). acid-soluble materials (e.g., holocellulose), and nonpolar extractable components
(e.g. , lipids and waxes) (Berg and Staaf 1980;
Mcclaugherty et al. 1985; Benner et al. 1987).
Each of these materials has a different c5 13C value
with Iignin being the most depleted in 13C and
cellulose the most enriched. Among oak litter and
fine roots, the c5 13C values vary by 5.1 °/oo and
3.6 °/oo, respectively (Natelhoffer and Fry
1988: 1635). Differential preservation, however,
appears to be a significant factor for only short
periods after the introduction of plant materials
(Berg et al. 1984; Tucker el al. 1986). Thus for
most sediment samples that are 100 or more years
old, isolated by burial from introduced nondecomposed plant materials and not uniquely well
preserved, it is unlikely that differential preservation of various plant components would pose a
problem.
Microbial decomposition of organic materials
enriches the 13C content of sediments from the
isotopic values of the original plants (Dzurec et al.
1985; Natelhoffer and Fry 1988). Generally, c5 13C
values increase in single soil solums as total
carbon decreases (Natelhoffer and Fry 1988), and
the implication is that a reduction of carbon
reflects more decomposition of organics. However, a better measurement of organic decomposition is the ratio between total carbon and total
nitrogen (Birkeland 1984: 15), and future studies
should incorporate carbon isotope changes and
C:N ratios for more accurate determinations of the
relationship between decomposition and carbon
isotope fractionation.

Additionally, the carbon isotopes from
sediment humates can be used for assessing the
same botnnic changes between C3 and CJCAM
plants (Stuiver 1975; Flexor and Volkoff 1977;

suggest that a +3 to +4 "fo, shift in carbon isotopes
occurs because of microbial decomposition of
organic materials in the soils. Soil humale 6 1'C

1977; Cerling 1984; Cerling and Hay 1986).
Cerling (1984) argues that oxygen isotopic composition of meteoric water and mean annual
temperature are correlated strongly at continental
locations that receive less than 1000 mm (39.4
inches) of rain annually. Stable oxygen isotopes,
sporadically occurring from ca. 17,350 to
9500 B.P., are available from pedogenic carbonates from 41HG128 and freshwater marls from
41WY112, and it is assumed that they were in
isotopic equilibrium with their coeval meteoric
rainwater. It should be added that the sites in
Willacy and Hidalgo counties would have been
much farther from the coast and much less influenced by marine weather patterns in the late
Pleistocene and early Holocene than today.
Additionally, as the ground surface is flat and
natural drainage systems are lacking, it is likely
that groundwater has accumulated with local
meteoric water as its primary source.
Oxygen isotopes measured from carbonates
are nonnally compared to 180/ 160 ratios in the
PDB standard; however, stable oxygen isotope
ratios in meteoric water arc traditionally compared
to Standard Mean Ocean Water (SMOW).
Oxygen isotope ratios based on the PDB standard
are not equal to those calculated from SMOW,
and they can be corrected with a simple linear
regression formula (Blatt et al. 1980:213), but this

environment was overwhelmingly dominated by C3
plants. Through the remaining 2,800 years, the
isotopic record suggests a rapid and consistent
shift toward more C4 and/or CAM plants, but
never to the levels that existed during the late
Pleistocene and early Holocene. One possible
scenario is that the lower C3 percentages represent
increases in prickly pear, agave, and C4 grasses
due to increasingly drier conditions, and that the
higher C3 percentages represent the influx of more
arboreal species, such as oak, due to increasingly
benign, wetter conditions. It is not mere coincidence that a mesic interval defined by pollen
analysis in the Lower Pecos region is dated to ca.
2500 B.P. (Bryant and Holloway 1985) and that
coeval drops in dated soil humate i5 13C values
occur from a wide range of sites in Texas, from
the Southern Plains to East and Central Texas
(Boyd and Tomka 1990; Collins and Bousman
1990). Clearly a mcsic interval occurred throughout much of Texas at approximately 2500 B.P.,
and it is registered in the carbon isotope ratios
from South Texas.
Oxygen Isotopes
Changes in the 180/ 160 ratios in the calcium
carbonate accumulations reflect temperature of
local meteoric (i.e., rain) water (Cerling et al.
95

Preilistoric Archeology and Paleoenvirmrments in Hidalgo and Willacy Counties

ij('"'0)(0.955) - 1.361](3.975)1 + 84.319.

correctioo is not necessary for the following
analysis.
Stable oxygen isotope ratios in cru:bonates
can be used to estimate their associated 6 1'0
value in meteoric water using a linear regression
(Fig. 42). This linear relationship suggests that
oxygen isotope ratios in pedogenic carbonates and
meteoric water arc in equilibrium. It is well
documented that o"O values in meteoric water are
controlled by temperature (Dansgaard 1964; Gal
1980; Yurtsever and Gat 1981; Heaton. et al.
1986), and the relationship also can be estimated
with a linear regression (Fig. 4 3). Evaporation,
the mechanism controlling the oxygen isotopic
composition of meteoric water (Faure 1986),
selectively removes the lighter 160 isotope first,
and then as evaporation continues, "O isotopes are
vaporized. Thus, during periods of warmer temperatures and increased evaporative activity,
greater amounL' of heavier oxygen isotopes are
removed from water sources, directly increasing
the 6 1'0 values of meteoric water. As meteoric
water is the primary soorce of oxygen isotopes in
pedogenic calcium carbonates, these data can be
used to estimalC temperatures during accumulation
of meteoric waters. The two linear regressions
can be combined in the following formula to
provide an estimation of the mean annual temperature:

The freshwater marl carbonate sample from .
4lWYI 12 has been grouped willl pedogenic
calcium carbonate nodules for the purposes of
climatic estimation. H is possible that the different chemical exchanges that occur in carbonates
from these two different depositional environments
could cause a systematic difference in fractionation of stable isotopes. More potential oxygen
reservoir sources exist for marl than for pc-Oogenic
carbonates. As no natural drainages transport
significant amounts of water into tlie area where
the marl samples were collected, it is suggeste<l
that the primary source of oxygen isotopes in
these marls is from local meteoric water lhat
accumulated and remained in the region. It is very
likely tliat tl1is water moved an unknown distance
subsurface through the Beaumont aquifer, but it is
important IO realize that at 9500 B.P., when this
rain fell, sea levels were much lower and water
tables would have been lower as well. The rapid
rise of sea level would have slowed the movement
of water in lhe aquifer and allowed this old water
lo remain in tl1e system until the historic period
when it was precipitated as marl at 41 WY112.
Until additional data from South Texas are available, it is assumed that the pedogenic carbonates

and freshwater marl arc in isotopic equilibrium
with coeval meteoric water and that no consistent
fractionation difference exists.
111e estimates of temperature derived from
oxygen isotopes suggest that temperature increased
significantly in the late Pleistocene and early
Holocene (Fig. 44). The mean annual temperature
estimate for 17,350 B.P. is 63° F (17.2° C). This
is the modem approximate mean annual temperature for the Southern Plains in Texas today,
although it is unlikely that the late Pleistocene
seasonal temperature variations in South Texas
were the same as those in the Southern Plains
today. The modem mean annual temperature in
the Lower Rio Grande Valley is 73° F (22.8° C),
and this represents an increase of 10° F (5.6° C)
from the Last Glacial Maximum to modem day.
It has been suggested that the 6 180 composition of
oceans was 1.4 °/oo higher during the Last Glacial
Maximum because of the disproportionately large
amounts of 160 isotopes trapped in glaciers
(Shackleton 1977; Kahn ct al. 1981). If this
assumption is figured into the temperature calculations, then the estimated temperature for the
oldest pedogenic carbonate would be 57.6° F
(14.2° C), which would result in a 15.4° F
(8.6° C) difference between modem temperature
and that at 17,350 B.P. Irrespective of which
assumptions arc correct, the most rapid tempera-

turc rise occurred between 17 ,350 and
15,010 B.P. , and this is clearly a period of increasing temperatures worldwide throughout the
late Pleistocene. However, this temperature rise
occurred earlier here than is generally documented
for the late Pleistocene in the northern hemisphere
(CLIMAP 1981), but a major component of the
northern hemisphere records reflects rising sea
levels as a measure of climatic change (Overpeck
et al. 1989:554). Evidence from the unglaciated
southern hemisphere suggests that the rise in
temperature occurred shortly after 18,000 B.P.
(Vogel 1985), and recent entomological evidence
from Iowa suggests that warming may have
occurred earlier in North America as well
(Schwert and Ashworth 1988). The very real
possibility exists that there was a lag between
surface temperatures and sea level response, as
well as earlier warming in lower latitudes. The
drop in estimated temperatures at 12.780 B.P. is
not unexpected as terminal Pleistocene climates
fluctuated a great deal as shown by glacial
sequences from the United States and Mexico
(Richmond and Fullerton 1986; White 1986).
Apparently, the driving mechanism for this terminal Pleistocene climatic fluctuation was cold

to lhe North Atlantic via the St. Lawrence River.
This caused a dramatic drnp in Gulf surface
temperatures during peak meltwater discharge
which appears to have stimulated high pressure
near the surface ood resulted in stronger western
A1lantic lrade winds and drier conditions regionally (Overpeck el al. 1989:555). These drier llJld
cooler condilions belween 13,000 nnd 12,000 B.P.
are seen in pollen speclra from Boriack Bog
(Bryoot 1977; Collins and Bousman 1990).
As Figure 44 shows, slight changes in c,
plant biomass seem to be in part related to
temperature changes; however, lhe apparenl early
Holocene increase in temperature was not accompanied by an increase in C, planls. This might be
due to an early Holooene dry phase, i.e., lhe
Altilhemrnl, well documented in other portions of
tlle continental United States. Clearly, a large
amount of climatic ond botanic variation could
occur between the few dated sample points presented here. More dates and stable isolopes on
pedogcnic carbonates, including ones dating to the
Holocene, could flesh out a paleoclimatic and
paleobotanie reoord that is lacking for tl1e Lower
Rio Grande Valley. It is most unfor1llnate that a
coeval pollen record does not exist for Soulh
Texas, but the pollen record from Bol'iack Bog,
the only pollen sequence from Texas that spoos
lhe late Pleistocene and early Holocene, shows a

significant increase in grasses beginning in the
early Holocene (Brynnt 1977). A similar pattern
may have occWTcd in Soulh Texas, and if so, it
could account for an increase in C, grasses at the
beginning of the Holocene as the temperatures ln
the late Pleistocene may have been too low for C4
grasses. An increase of C4 grasses in Soutb Texas
would account for the higher one values and lhe
lower C3 plant estimate for the early Holocene
sample. As phytolilh evidence does exist for lhe
widespread occWTence of C4 grasses in the early
Holocene in South Texas (Robinson 1979, 1982),
this seems to be a reasonable model. If C, grass
biomass was limited in the Pleistocene because of
lower temperatures, this would have provided a
ceiling on 6 13C value.• and a lower limit on C4
plant estimations, as apparently occurs in the late
Pleistocene samples. This would suggest that the
C, component in lhe late Pleistocene is constituted
of CAM plants, such as prickly pear or agave, and
not of C4 grasses. Further pollen, phytolith, and
isotope data could more fully document lhe natlU'e
of Pleistocene and Holocene environmental
changes in South Texas.

1 m south of Backhoe Trench 1 at 70-80 cm
below surface. The age of the inorganic (apatite)
fraction of the tortoise shell is calculated to be
9360 ± 415 B.P. (GX-15125-A). This tortoise is
probably the extinct giant species Gopherus
hexagonatus, as numerous other tortoise remains
of this species have been recovered from the same
stratigraphic position in this region (Westgate
1987:200-219). These G. hexagonatus remains
were tentatively assigned to an early Wisconsin
age by Westgate (1987:207) because the samples
were all found in the upper Beaumont Formation;
however, no tortoise samples, other than that from
41WY140, were chronometrically dated. It is
generally believed that the Beaumont Formation
was deposited during a period of high sea levels
in the late Pleistocene, and its estimated age span
ranges from 132,000 to 120,000 B.P. (see Chapter
1). In view of I.he difference between the tortoise
radiocarbon age and t11c estimated age span of the
Beaumont Formation, it is significant that
Gopherus is a burrowing tortoise and that
Westgate (1987:204) found a few individuals in a
position that suggested the use of burrows. Thus,
the presumed stratigraphic association of the
Beaumont Formation and t11e tortoises may be not
be correct. Nevertheless, the 41WY140 tortoise
radiocarbon age should not be accepted without
question, as apatite and not collagen was used,
and apatite is notorious for producing unreliable
radiocarbon ages (Taylor 1987:53-61). Unfortunately, gelatin (collagen) was not present in the
tortoise shell. It can be argued that if the tortoise
remains are the same age as the Beaumont
Formation, it is unlikely that . t11e apatite date
would be so recent. More radiocarbon dates on
tortoises, especially on the collagen fraction, are
necessary before a terminal Pleistocene date can
be accepted without reservation, but at present,
this is the only chronometric age estimate for
Gopherus remains in Sout11 Texas. If the age is
correct, then it appears that the tortoise was
present in South Texas when conditions became
warmer in 1.he early Holocene (sec Fig. 44). More
work is required to determine if the tortoise
remains extend back into the Pleistocene and a.re
associated with colder climatic conditions.

archeology using stable carbon isotopes in prehistoric human bone, an explosion of applications has
occurred (van der Merwe 1982; DeNiro 1987;
Price 1989). A great deal more is now known
about stable carbon isotopes, diets, and fractionation effects in bone, and stable isotopes from
other elements, such as nitrogen, now a.re known
to yield additional types of information. Carbon
and nitrogen stable isotope ratios were measured
on all individuals recovered from previous projects
on the Hidalgo-Willacy Drainage Ditch. The
dietary implications of the stable isotope analysis
a.re presented below; however, first it is necessary
to discuss the radiocarbon dating of these samples.

Radiocarbon Dates on Human Bone
The remains of three individual humans were
recovered during previous projects along the
Hidalgo-Willacy Drainage Ditch by Prewitt and
Associates" Inc. (Day et al. 1981; Hall et al.
1987), and all have been radiocarbon dated. One
of these, the burial from 41 WY50 (Prewitt 1981 ),
was rcdated in the current project because the
previous date was obtained from apatite, the inorganic fraction of bone, and the date was not
corrected for carbon isotope fractionation effect.
Much research on bone dating has shown that
apatite dates a.re often Wlfeliable, especially if
secondary carbonates a.re not carefully removed
from the inorganic fraction (Hassan ct al. 1977;
Taylor 1987:53-61). Whenever possible, the
organic fractions (bone gelatin or collagen) should
be dated, but recent research has shown that even
collagen can be altered by diagenesis (Stafford et
al. 1987; Stafford ct al. 1988). Thus all bone
dates, not just apatite, must be considered with
caution. All new dates discussed in this section
were corrected for carbon isotope fractionation
effect and use the 5,570-year half-life.
The previous apatite age of the 41 WY50
burial was 540 ± l lO B.P. (Tx-4256), while the
new gelatin age is 1415 ± 140 B.P. (GX-15124G). The new date is almost tluce times older than
the original radiocarbon assay, and this clearly
represents a significant difference. The present
gelatin date on the 41WY50 burial is considered
more reliable than the previous date, because it
was run on t11e gelatin fraction and corrected for
fractionation effect. Little collagen was obtained
from the 41WY113 burial, and an accelerator date
was required, producing an age of l088 ± 90 B.P.

ST ABLE ISOTOPES AND HUMAN DIET
Since Vogel and van der Merwe (1977:238242) presented the first dietary analysis in
99

Prehistoric Archeology and Pa/eoe11viro11me/l/s in Hidalgo and Willacy Counties

(GX-15123-G). The apatite fraction from this
burial was also radiocarbon dated resulting in an
age of 1830 ± 215 B.P. (GX-15123-A). At Ibis
point in time, the AMS date on lhc gelatin fraction
. from the 41WYI13 burial is probably more
reliable, and Ibis is accepted as the correct age of
lhe burial. The two gelatin dales from 41WY50
and 41 WY l IJ are fairly close in time, but a
Student's Hest (t = 1.964) indicates that the
probability of contemporaneity is less lhan 5%.
Only lhe inorganic apatite fraction could be dated
from the 41 WY67 burial, resulting in an age of
4495 ± 350 B.P. (GX-15254-A). Gelatin was
recovered from lhe 41WY67 bone sample, but the
large differences between the stable carbon imtopes from the gelatin and apatite fractions (see
Appendix D) and a visual inspection of the gelatin
suggested lhat lhe gelatin had experienced diagenetic change (Harold Krueger, personal communication 1989). These radiocarbon dates on human
bone can be used to argue lhat occupation
throughout the late Holocene is likely, but Ibey
provide no evidence of human occupation during
the middle or curly Holocene or during lhe terminal Pleistocene in the Lower Rio Grande Valley.

from carnivore prey diet.
The situation is more complex for omnivores
such as humans. Krueger and Sullivan (1984)
argue that humans incorporate carbon into collagen, a protein, directly from meat protein, but
most of lhe curbon in apatite is acquired initially
from plant carbohydrates, secondly from meat
lipids, and then only a small amount from meat
protein. Circumstantial evidence suggests that
significant amounts of carbon isotopes in human
collagen are obtained from both meat and plants
(Vogel and van der Merwc 1977; Klepinger and
Mintel 1986; Bousman ct al. 1989), but lhe relative contribution of each is · currently unknown
(Sillen et al. 1989). It is also unlmov.n how the
relative contribution of carbon isotopes from each
source changes as one or Ille other food source is
altered within lhe diet. Nevertheless, lhrough one
path or lhe other, it is clear that carbon isotopes in
human collagen are fractionated +5.0 "loo above
either lhe plant foods ingested directly by humans
or lhc plnut foods ingested by herbivore prey
animals eaten by humans. If lhe primary source
of curbon isotopes is tltrough prey animals, lhen
biotic changes should be registered in the human
carbon isotope ratios. This proposition assumes
that prey-animal diets reflect biotic changes.
While this has not been dcmonsliated for Soulh
Texas, data are available from Africa to suggest
Ibis is correct (Sealy t986, 1989; Bousman el al.
1989), Thus, if li 13C values from human remains
mirror changes in the botanical environment, one
can take the extreme viewpoint that the major
carbon pathway is from plant to herbivore to
human, nod Iha! changes in human 6 "C values arc
due simply to environmental changes that are
transferred trophically to humans with no change
of diet. However, if the human and environmental
patterns differ, lhen one must assume that Ibis
reflects a true dietary difference that cannot be
explained as simply a botanical change Iba! is
indirectly registered in human isotopes. Oeurly a
measure of environmental 6 13C change is needed,
and carbon isotopes from radiocarbon--Oated, bulk
soil humates urc lhc best and most easily acquired
source.

Carbon Isotopes
Bone is constructed of organic and inorganic
materials. The inorganic components constitute
approximately 70% of lhe dry weight, the organic
components make up 20%, and bound wuter
accounts for most of the remaining 10%. The
patl1ways for carbon inclusion in the inorganic
fraction, i.e., apatite, and the organic fraction, i.e.,
collagen, are apparently di!Jerent (Krueger and
Sullivan 1984: Sillen et al. 1989).
Krueger and Sullivan (1984) argue that in
herbivores, the source of carbon in collagen and
apatite is carbohydrates from plant foods, although
collagen and apatite phuses fractionate stable
carbon isotopes to different degrees. For herbivores, collagen is on the average 5 "loo higher and
apatite is 12 °100 higher than the diet. More
important for human dietary studies is lhe fractionation Iha! occurs between herbivore diet and
the portions eaten by humans. Lipids (fat) in
herbivores are I 1* less tl1an diet. while herbivore
protein (meat) is 5 'loo higher than diet. In carnivores, ingested meat protein is the greatest contributor to collagen. while ingested lipids contribute most of the carbon to apatite. Carnivore

individual from 41WY113 ate approximately 55%
C3 plants, but the individual from 41 WY50 ate
only 12% C3 plants. This is a dramatic difference
that requires some explanation. First, the mixed
C3 and CJCAM plant diet of the 41WY113
individual seems intuitively reasonable given a
presumed consumption of prickly pear (a CAM
plant), oak (a C3 plant), and deer (herbivores that
eat mostly C3 plants). However, the high CJCAM
plant utilization by the 41WY50 individual is
anomalous. The coast is not an area known for a
great dominance of CJCAM plants such as agave
or prickly pear (see Chapter I), and normally,
µo
13
marine environments mimic C 1 plant 6 C values/L 'i
(i.e., -27 to -20 °/oo). A very limited number of
stable carbon isotopes, however, are available
from Redfish Bay along the Texas coast near
Corpus Christi (Parker 1964), and these indicat:e
that marine plants and animals from this portion of
the Texas coast have fJ 13C values that fall within
the range of C4 and CAM plants. 111e mean value
of five plants and animals is -15.0 °/oo. Assuming
that these plants and animals were all eaten and
contributed equally to human collagen, then fractionation of these values by +5.0 °/oo could produce human collagen values of -10.0 °/oo. The
6 13C collagen value of the 41WY50 individual is
-9.7 °/oo. Thus, it is very likely that the lower
coastal marine environments also have similar
6 13C values which mimic a CJCAM plant signal

the 41WY67 remains are not included because the
collagen was poorly preserved.
In addition,
apatite fJ 13C values are not used because their
chemical taphonomy is poorly understood. The
fJ 13C values from soil humates show a trajectory
from low to high through time; however, the
trajectory for human carbon isotope ratios is
opposite to this environmental trend . This suggests that environmental change does not account
for the difference between the two human carbon
isotope ratios. The older human sample is from
a coastal clay dune at 41 WY50, and the younger
sample is from the inland site 41WY113. A
6.0 °/oo difference exists between the two human
13
fJ C values (sec Appendix D), and the underlying
environmental trend, if registered in the human
isotope ratios, may have helped make this difference less than it might have been with no environmental change. A 6.0 °/oo difference would reflect
a 40-45% difference in C 3 versus CJCAM plant
use, and the coastal human clearly ingested more
CJCAM plants or animals that ate CJCAM plants
than the individual at 41WY113. Given only two
human collagen measurements, it is unreasonable
to suggest a temporal pattern in diets; rather, a
coastal and inland difference in prehistoric diets is
a more reasonable possibility.
If one assumes that the carbon isotope ratios
in these two individuals represent the mix of C3
and CJCAM plants directly ingested, then the

and lhat lhese high 6 13 C values arc reflected in the
stable carbon isotope mtios in the individual from

increasing 6 N values by approximately 3 "/•• for
each trophic level; this occurs in bolh marine lllld
terrestrial food webs (DcNiro 1987). As marine
ecosystems have more trophic levels, !hey generally have higher o"N values thllll terrestrial
systems. For example, the mean 6 "N value for
marine plants is 7 '/oo (DeNiro 1987). If the
nitrogen isotopes traveled through two trophic
levels, i.e., woplankton rn:id fish, before human
ingestion and 100% of the humrn:i diet was from
marine sources, then lhe isotopes would hove
passed through three trophic levels, and U1e predicted 6 15N value for humlUl collagen would be
9 °/oo higher, or 16.0 °/oo. In terrestrial systems,
however, if 70% of a person's diet consisted or
nonlegume plants wilh a 6 "N value of 9 °/., and
30% was derived from animals Iha! ate nonlegume
plants, then lhe predicted o15 N value of lhat
individual's bone collagen would be approximately
13 °/co. If, in lhc same ecosystem, a person
ingested 20% legumes, 50% nonlcgume plants, and
30% animals !hat ate nonlegume pllUlts, then the
predicted o 15N value would be l l.3 "/~.
The second complication consists of environmental effects on 6 15 N values in natural ecological systems (Heaton 1987). Two known
environmental effects are aridity IUld salinity.
Heaton et al. (1986) and Sealy et al. (1987) have
shown Iha! stable nitrogen isotope ratios in human
and mammal bone collagen arc negatively coneIated wilh mean annual rainfall, while Heaton
(1987) has demonstrated 01at 6 15N values in plants
are also negatively correlated with melUl annual
rainfall. Even !hough tlte higher o 1'N values in
plants would be passed on to llllimals, lhe rate of
nitrogen fractionation correlated to aridity is
greater in animals than in plants; regression slopes
between rainfall and plant o"N values range from
ca. -0.3 to --0.4, while regression slopes between
rainfall and animal bone collagen o 15N values
range from en. -l.1 to -1.3. Higher o"N values
in animals appear to be a metabolic response to
water stress, but this response has not Ileen demonstrated for plants. Jn fact, Shearer et al. (1978)
have shown Iha! 6 "N values in total soil nitrogen
are most strongly correlated with aridity, and Ibis
suggests that lhc nitrogen isotopic ratios of soils
are transfoned to plants and probably that no
nitrogen fractionation by plants OCL1lfS. The
mechanisms that control soil 6 "N values are
unknown. Research has shown also that plant
6 nN values are elevated near coasts (Virginia lllld

41WY50.
Nitrogen Isotopes
In terrestrial ecosystems, "N/"N ratios can
be used to separate plants into two groups:
legumes and all other plants (Virginia and
Delwiche 1982). These ratios arc compared to
"Nl"N ratios in air which are used as the standard unit like the PDB standard in carbon isotopes. Legumes have slightly less "N and lheir
corresponding o15 N values are consistently lower.
The difference is not due to isotopic fractionation
by plants, like the fractionation of carbon isotopes
by photosynlhesis, but ralher it is due to lhe ability
of legumes to extract, i.e., fix, nitrogen from two
sources: N, from U1e atmosphere and nitrate and
ammonium ions from the soil. Nonlegume plants
can only fix nitrogen from soil nitrate and ammonium. Atmospheric 6 "N values average 0 '/=, as
it is the stlUldard for measurement, while nitrate
and ammonium have variable but higher 6 15N
values (Letolle 1980). As atmospheric N, hos
lower 6 15 N values U11U1 soil nitrogen, this difference is tr1U1Sfcrred to plllllts with very little alteration. On average, legumes have o"N values near
I '/=, and o"N values of nonlegume plants are
close to 9 °/oo (DeNiro 1987).
Jn marine ecosystems, "N/'4N ratios of
plants arc controlled by lhe isotopic ratios available from inorgllllic sources, which include atmospheric N, and soil nitrates and ammonium dissolved in ocean waters. Only blue--grcen algae
are capable if fixing dissolved N, from the oceans,
and lheir corresponding o"N values rn:e approximately 0 °/oo. Olher marine plants, such as phytoplankton, use only dissolved nitrates and ammonium IUld no atmospheric N,. Correspondingly,
lhcse plants are more enriched in "N and have
higher o"N values. Unfortunately, o 15 N values in
oceans are highly variable geographically, and lhe
base level, starting point for 6 "N values in lhe
Gulf of Mexico and Laguna Madre is unknown.
It is currently impossible to estimate !he expected
environmental 6 15N values of this marine ecosystem.
Two additional factors complicate stable
nitrogen isotope dietary studies. llie first is the
enrichment of "N as nitrogen isotopes pass from
primary producers (plllllts) to co111umcrs (llllimals),

102

Chapter 6: Paleoenvironments and Human Diets

Delwiche 1982; Heaton 1987). As o 15N values of
ocean water are generally higher than terrestrial
sources, it seems likely that sea-spray could
introduce nitrates with high o15N values and that
this would influence the o15N values of plants
growing near the coast. Heaton ( 1987) has demonstrated that plants growing at inland saline
environments similar to La Sal Vieja also have
high o15 N values. It is known that salt can
influence a number of metabolic, physical, and
chemical processes and reactions, and one or a
combination of these apparently accounts for the
elevated o15N values in saline environments.
The o15N values measured in human collagen
from the three burials recovered along the
Hidalgo-Willacy Drainage Ditch are 9.6 °/oo
(41WY50), 6.2 °/00 (41WY67), and 7.6 °/oo
(41WY113) (see Appendix D). As stated above,
the collagen from the 41 WY67 burial is poorly
preserved and the carbon isotope ratios are suspect, but it is unknown if the stable nitrogen
isotope ratios were affected. Assuming the o15N
value from this burial was not altered by
diagenesi s, it appears that the coastal burial from
41WY50 has the highest o15N value, as would be
expected in an individual who intensively utilized
plants and animals from marine and near-marine
environments. It is interesting that the 41WY113
burial has a higher o15N value than the 41WY67
individual, and it is possible that this individual
may have exploited environments that were more
saline, but not necessarily coastal, such as La Sal
Vieja.

a Pleistocene tortoise, Gopherus sp., common to
South Texas may have lived as recently as 9,400
years ago. Radiocarbon dating of human bone
provides the oldest chronometric evidence of
human occupation in the Lower Rio Grande Valley
at ca. 4500 B.P. Humans may have occupied, and
probably did occupy, the region before this time,
but unquestionable evidence is lacking.
Carbon and nitrogen isotopes in human bone
collagen suggest that human diets near the coast
may have been different from those farther inland.
Only three individuals were assessed, and additional assays could and probably would significantly change the picture. This initial attempt was
made to assess the potential of the technique, and
in those terms, it is clear that the technique has
merit and can provide information on human diets
that is unavailable from any other source.
Analyses of stable oxygen and carbon
isotopes from carbonates and carbon isotopes from
soil humates provide the first direct paleoenvironmcntal information from this region. Again, this
was an attempt to assess the potential of the
technique, and it is clear that these isotopic analyses can provide extremely useful paleoenvironmental data for the region. The results suggest
that plant communities were dramatically different
in the late Pleistocene and early Holocene and that
plant communities in the late Holocene were not
stable, but in a state of flux . These data also
provide the first paleotemperature estimates for
the Last Glacial Maximum in Texas. Further
stable oxygen isotope analyses on spelothems
from caves as abound in Central Texas might
provide a more-detailed paleoclimatic record than
is possible from pedogenic carbonates. While far
from conclusive, the paleoenvironmental and
dietary studies presented in this chapter constitute
a step in providing some of the kinds of contextual
data that are needed for interpreting the archeological information that has been collected from
South Texas and in identifying the kinds of data
that need to be recovered in future investigations.

SUMMARY
Stable isotopic analysis in Texas archeology
is just beginning, and the results reported here are
limited. Nevertheless, the potentials are farreaching, and stable isotopes can provide challenging new data on environmental change and
human diets.
The more traditional form of
isotopic analysis, radiocarbon dating, suggests that

tative sample of sites in all five environmental
zones described in Chapter 1. Most sites along
the drainage ditch occur in the lowland plain, the
sand sheet, and the upland plain; no previously
analyzed site collections are available from the
Rio Grande floodplain or delta, and only limited
data are available from the coastal zone. Even
though artifacts were collected from many sites in
Cameron County, especially by Anderson in the
early twentieth century, and these collections could
provide information that might significantly alter
regional interpretations, it was not feasible to
consider analysis of these artifacts during this
project. For this reason, additional sites in the
floodplain, delta, and coastal zones in Cameron
County are not formally included in this assessment of the hunter-gatherer models.
Another problem with the available site
collections is that they are small. Small sample
sizes prohibit meaningful quantified analysis on a
site-by-site basis, and one solution to this problem is to lump sites into groups or spatial clusters.
Seven site clusters were defined within Hidalgo
and Willacy counties (Fig. 46). Table 15 lists the
sites included in each cluster. The first cluster
consists of 16 sites surrounding Laguna La Sal
Vieja in the central portion of the sand sheet. Site
cluster 2 has nine sites located in the eastern
portion of the sand sheet. No site clusters were
defined for the western portion of the sand sheet.
Cluster 3 consists of nine sites in the westernmost
portion of the project area in the center of the

The three models developed in Chapter 3
provide alternative explanations for resource
exploitation patterns in the Lower Rio Grande
region by incorporating optimal foraging theory
and assuming that territorial divisions limited
access to resources. These factors would have
conditioned the intensity of artifact use, curation,
and distribution. In this chapter, an attempt is
made to assess which model best matches the
actual data from the region and , in the process,
provide a more comprehensive picture of prehistoric human adaptations in the Lower Rio Grande
Valley.
THE REGIONAL DATA BASE

A test of the three models necessitates a
broad regional perspective. Such is not afforded
by the small artifact samples from the five archeological sites investigated during this project along
the Hidalgo-Willacy Drainage Ditch. A review of
published artifact analyses from previous projects
revealed that many attributes had been recorded
that were useful for testing the three models.
Some important attributes, however, were not
recorded, and a reanalysis of selected artifact
attributes from previously recorded sites was
undertaken to provide an appropriate and comparable regional data base.
Neither the present archeological project nor
previous investigations (Mallouf ct al. 1977; Day
et al. 1981; Hall et al. 1987) provide a reprcsen-

upland plain. Cluster 4 has 11 sites located near
the junction of Arroyo Colorndo and the Rio
Grande in the southern portion of Ille upland plain.
This is the only cluster located near the Rio
Grande floodplain. Cluster 5, with nine sites, is
located in the western portion of the lowland
plain. Cluster 6 has 24 sites and is located in the
central lowland plain. Forty-two sites comprise
the seventh cluster, and these are located primarily
in the eastern portion of tl1e lowland plain. Some
of the sites in this zone are located in the coastal
environmental zone but have been grouped in the
eastern lowland plain because of very small
artifact sample si7.es. The sites investigated
during this project occur in two clusters. Sites
4IHGl28 and 41WYI40 are in Cluster 6, while
41WYll2, 41WYl13, and 41WY134 are in
Cluster 7.

fragments, and chips (medial and distal fragments)
are considered as early reduction debitage, while
late reduction debitage consists of tertiary (i.e.,
decorticate) debitage. Maximum dimension ,;ize
categories are defined for debitage in I 0-mm
increments. Due to the small size of raw materials, the largest size category consists of flakes
larger than 30 mm. Also, the smallest size class
is not used in the analysis because of different
collection procedures, i.e., fine screening in the
present project. Finally, complete flakes and
proximal fragments are classified as resharpening
flakes or other flakes based on removal intent.
Reshll!Jlening flakes consist of both uniface and
biface resharpening flakes. Tiie first type consists
of flakes with single facets, mmerous microstep
fractures immediately dorsal to the platform
surface, and rounding of the edge formed by the
dorsal facet and striking platform proper. In
general, these flakes are trapezoidal, are slightly
longitudiruilly curved at their distal ends, and have
dorsal ridges running perpendicular to the Jong
axes immediately dorsal to the curves. Biface
reshll!Jlening flakes consist of tertiary flakes with
thin, narrow, multifaceted striking platforms that
exhibit rounding, facet--scar smoothing, and polish
on the platform surfaces and dorsal facets adjacent
the platforms. These flakes, removed by a soft
pcrcussor, have slight longitudinal curves along
their entire lengths, and expand toward their distal
ends. Most of the resharpening flakes in the
collections derive from nnifaee resharpening.
In addition to the usual tool categories of
projectile points, unifaces, and bifaces, four
analytical categories are used to cross classify
formal tools. These are manufacture failures,
exhausted tools, use-broken tools, and reused
tools. Manu[acture rejects and specimens broken
in manufacture are regarded as manufacture
failures. Manufacture rejects are tl10se complete
but unfinished specimens (e.g., Stage 2 and 3
bifaces; Callalian 1979: 18) exhibiting manufacture
problems lhat prohibited tlie successful conclusion
of the manufacture sequence. Manufacture breaks
were identified by comparison with experimentally
produced breaks (Johnson 1979, 1981; Tomka
1986). Those tools on which the length or tlie
functional element (i.e., blade or working edge) is
less than one-third of the total length of the tool
are considered exhausted specimens. The categorization of nonhafted tools is based on a

ANALYTICAL METHODS

In Chapter 3, predictions were developed for
the distributions of individual artifact classes for
each of the three hypothetical models of human
adaptation. These predictions were presented as
deviations from even or homogeneous distributions
of artifacts across tlie landscape. In this chapter,
the real data are presented and compared to the
predictions. The raw data are not directly compared to the models; rather, they are transformed
statistically so that the real deviations can be
compared to the predicted deviations. The discussion that follows presents the criteria used to
define the individual artifact classes and the
statistical techniques used to calculate the deviations.
Attribute Definitions
Based on the data presented in published
reports and on limited reanalysis or selected
artifact attributes, artifacts are categorized into the
analytical 1,>roupings defined in Chapter 3. The
unmodified Jithic debitage is classified by reduction stage, size category, and removal intent. In
addition, relative frequencies are tabulated by site
cluster.
To maintain statisticnlly significant
samples by cluster, both complete and fragmentary
flakes are considered in each analysis.
Primary (i.e., corticate) and secondary (i.e.,
partially decorticate) complete flakes, proximal

recovered from 41HG128, 41WY112, 41WY113,
and 41WY140 is from the fine screen. A comparison of the smallest debitage size frequencies
from these sites with those of previous projects
indicates that the use of fine screening greatly
increases the recovery rate of debitagc smaller
than l 0 mm. The use of fine screening is considered crucial to the nonskcwed recovery of lithic
artifacts in the project area. For example, the
collection of microdebitage allows for a more
accurate assessment of tool maintenance activities.
However, due to the inconsistent debitage recovery
techniques used by different projects, debitage less
than or equal to 10 mm in maximum size recovered during llle present archeological work is
excluded from the formal analysis. Larger size
cate-gories were consistently collected by previous archeological projects, and it is the larger
flakes that are formally analyzed in this report.

comparison of the overall artifact size to the
average size of artifacts of the same type in the
site collection and the analyst's opinion on whether
or not the tool could perform its intended task.
Unifacc resharpening breaks were also determined
based on comparison with experimentally replicated resharpening breaks. Their morphology
resembles that generated as a result of use. As in
the case of manufacture and uniface resharpening
breaks, use-broken tools were identified by
comparison to experimentally produced breaks
(Rondeau 1981; Odell and Cowan 1986). Due to
this similarity in break morphologies, and because
unifaces broken during resharpening represent
finished tools dulled through use and broken during
rejuvenation, they were combined with use-broken
specimens. Those tools that were broken in
manufacture or use and subsequently used to
perform new tasks are considered reused (e.g.,
scrapers made on broken projectile points).
Complete tools lliat show wear traces indicative of
the performance of two distinct tasks (e.g., the
proximal end of a thin biface showing use as a
gouge while the lateral edges exhibit cutting use
wear) are considered reused also. Few complete
reused specimens are present in tl1e collections.
Due to functional similarity and for the sake of
simplicity, distally beveled bifaccs (e.g., bifacial
gouges) arc grouped with unifaces. Flakes with
edge modifications resulting from use are classified as edge-modified flakes . Specimens with
edge modification derived from intentional retouch
are classified as unifaces.
The raw data for each analytical category by
site cluster and environmental zone is presented in
Table 16. The frequencies of certain artifact
categories by site were taken directly from the
respective reports when the data were shown in
sufficient detail. Limited additional analyses were
performed on other artifact categories, during
which some artifact classifications were changed
from those originally reported. Disagreements
between artifact frequencies used here and those
shown in t11e reports and differences in counts of
the same artifact category in Table 16 stem from
such analytical reassignments and the use of a
combination of previously reported and reanalyzed
data.
Different data recovery techniques have been
used on various projects conducted in the region.
For example, the majority of the lithic debitage

Statistical Analysis Techniques
This analysis relies heavily on tlle use of
standardized deviates (sec Table 16) (Mosteller
and Parunak 1985:197). Standardized deviates
provide an analogue of standard deviations but
accomodate categorical (i .e., count) data instead
of measured data. Their calculation is straightforward and simple, and standardized deviates
provide a technique for dissecting and analyzing
count data arranged in tables.
The first step in calculating standardized
deviates is tlle calculation of tlle expected values
such as lllose used in a Chi-Square Goodness-ofFit Test or a Chi-Square Test-of-Independence
(Ott 1977:266-273, 294-298). Parcnllletically, it
should be added that a Chi-Square Goodness-ofFit Test looks at the distribution of only one
element (e.g., artifact class), by itself, while a
Oii-Square Test-of-Independence investigates llle
distributions of two or more elements togetller. If
no independent information is available to suggest
otherwise, tlle calculations of expected values
usually assumes an even distribution of artifact
frequencies through space and time. For example,
if a single artifact class is located at 5 sites and a
total of 25 artifacts are discovered, then llle
expected value of that artifact al each site is 5 (25
divided by 5). This is the metllod used willl a
Chi-Square Goodness-of-:Fit Test, and it assumes
that the distribution of an individual artifact type

the Hunter-Gatherer Mobility and Territorial Models

is the important pattern irrespective of the distributions of any other artifact classes. An example
of this method of calculation in the data presented
in Table 16 is cores, At 7 site clusters, 128 cores
were documented, and an even distribution of
cores among the 7 clusters would result in
approximately 18.3 cores per cluster.
Most contingency table analyses do not
investigate the distribution of a single element,
i.e., a single artifact class such as cores, but rather
look at how one artifact type varies in relation to
anotl1er artifact type or types. Tills is known as a
Chi-Square Test-of-Independence. The expected
values are calculated differently than for the ChiSquare Goodness-of-Fit Test, and these can best
be explained by referring back to Table 16.
Debitage has been classified as eitl1er early reduction or late reduction. The total count of early
reduction debitage from all site clusters equals
1,399, and it comprises 38.6% of the total amount
of debitage. If early reduction debitage was
evenly distributed across each site cluster, then
38,6% of the debitage at each site would be early
reduction and the actual raw number would be
dependent on the sample size of the individual site
clusters. For example, Cluster I (sand sheet) has
a total of 308 pieces of debitage, and 38.6% of
308 equals 118.9. Thus 118.9 is the expected
value of early reduction debitage in Cluster L
This process is used to calculate expected values
for debitage reduction stage, debitage size, frequency of reshrupening flakes, reasons of discard,
tool reuse, and frequency of edge-modified flake
elasses.
With the expected and observed values, standardized deviates are obtained for each artifact
class in each site cluster by applying the following
formula:

Standardized Deviate

~

(0-E)

IE

where 0 = observed value and E = expected
value. For the purposes of the following analysis,
standardized deviates Jess than or equal to -1
represent observed values occurring in less than
expected frequencies, standardized deviates that
are equal to or greater than+ 1 represent observed
values occurring in greater than expected frequencies, and standardized deviates that are between

113

+ 1 and -1 reflect observed values that are
approximately equal to lhe expected vnlues.
The calculation of standardized deviates for
any particular analytical category (e.g:; tool type
or debitage type) takes into account the relative
frequencies of all other categories intentionally
included in the specific malrlx. As a result, it
generates an underlying relationship between
categories within the matrix. This procedure in
lllm requires Oiat the categories in a matrix be
behaviorally related to each other. Because of
these underlying factors, not all analytical categories were included in one malrlx to derive the
standardized deviates to be compared with the
predictions derived from the three models. Rather,
seven matri;<es were used to calculate the standardized deviates, and these contained the following analytical categories: (1) the frequencies of
early and late reduction specimens; (2) debitage
size categories greater than JO mm; (3) the combined unmodified and edge-modified debitage
frequencies compared to the combined frequencies
of tools and cores; (4) the frequencies of resharpening and other flakes; (5) manufacture failure,
exhausted, and use-broken !Doi frequencies, and
tools without technological discard reasons; (6) the
frequencies of resharpened and reused tools and
tools showing neither of the tiails; and (7) edgemodified and unmodified flake frequencies.
For two analytical categories, mean number
of working edges per scraper and mean number of
working edges per edge-modified flake, actual
standard deviations and not standardized deviates
were calculated. If the observed vnlue is within a
single standard deviation range around the mean,
it is considered to be equal to the expected value.
If it is below or above the one standard deviation
range, then the observed vnlue is classified as less
than or greater than the expected value, respectively. It should be noted that significance tests,.
such as Chi-Square, have not been included for the
twelve analytical categories,
Factor analysis is used to investigate the
relationships between the different artifact categories. Factor Llllalysis is a multivariate statisticnl
technique based on the assumption that the stati.•tical covariation among the observ~d artifact
categories, seen as equal and dependent variables,
is due to underlying, unmeasured, and unobserved
independent variables otherwise known as factors
(Kim and Mueller 1978:12). Thus, the various

Prehistoric Archeology and Pa/eoenviro11me11ts in Hidalgo and Willacy Counties

artifact categories are considered as dependent
variables that are controlled by one or more
unidentified independent variable. Factor analysis
searches for and identifies patterns of covariation
among the measured variables. consisting of
artifact categories in this, report, and each distinct
pattern is related to a single factor. The correspondence between factors and actual prehistoric
behaviors must be identified by the researcher,
however, and this can be very easy or very difficult depending on the interpretability of the artifact
categories and tlte naLur~ of their covariation. One
problem with the assumptions of factor analysis i~
tliat it assumes !hat relationships and covarfotions
are linear. The relationships arc characterized by
factor loadings for each variable on each factor.
The factor loadings may be positive or negative,
and it is the extreme positive or negative loadings
that allow for the characterization of an individual
factor. On individual factors, most variables will
have factor loadings near zero, and thus they do
not contribute to the characterization of the factor.
If a factor is characterized by high positive and
high negative factor loadings on cerlnin variables,
then it is characterized as a bipolar factor. On a
bipolar factor, the variables that have similar
factor loadings, either positive or negative, have
positive correlations with each other, and they as
a group have negative correlations with variables
that are inversely loaded. However, factors need
not be bipolar. Factors can have only high positive loadings meaning that variables only have
positive correlations for that individual factor.
This is a nonbipolar factor.
In this analysis, a principal components factor
extraction method was used wiU1 an oblique
solution and a varimax factor rotation. A principal components factor extraction method selects
factors along tl1e axes of maximum variance in N
dimensional space, an oblique solution allows the
factors to be correl!Jted unlike an ortl1ogonal
solution which forces the factors to be uncorrelated, and a varimax rotation tends to increase
the large loadings and decrease the small factor
loadings for individual variables (Afifi and Azeu
1979:320-336). Other important information on
factor analysis includes variable complexity and
an individual factor's proportion of the variance.
Variable complexity indicates the factor density of
a variable. The objective of most factor analyses
is to identify factors wilh simple slructures,

meaning that individual variables arc accounted
for by no more than one factor. Variable complexity is a measure of structural simplicity, and
the ideal simple structure produces variable
complexity values of 1.0 (BrainPower, Inc.
1986:123-124). Proportion of the common variance is a measure of the contribution of an individual factor to the total explained variance by the
factor llllalysis.
DISCUSSION OF RESULTS
Two levels of analysis and comparison are
undertaken in this study. The first is by site
cluster, and the second is by environmental zone.
These provide different scales of comparison that
allow a more complete Wlderstanding of the
regional archeological patterns tlian if only one
level of analysis was achieved. Also, the test of
the models can take place only on the site cluster
level, but import"11t artifact utilization patterns are
seen more clearly at tl1e environmental level.
Lastly, it is only at U:te enviroomental zone level
that new sites can be assessed as to their potential
for providing useful and unique data for the
regional data base.
Sile Closter Comparisons
Tbe simplified standardized deviate categories
for each of the 12 analyzed attributes of the
collections arc shown on maps for each site cluster
in Figure 47. The standardized deviates are
illustrated as one of three states: greater than,
less than, or approximately equal to the expected
values, These maps, along with the numerical
data presented in Table 16, form the spriogboard
for the following analysis, which focuses on the
spatial distributions for tl1e twelve attributes and
a comparison between these standardized deviates
with the predictions for each of the three models
presented and discussed at length in Chapter 3.
The detailed comparisons of the observed standardized deviates with !he individual model
predictions are listed in Tables 17, 18, and 19.
From these comparisons, n scoring system was
developed that allows an unbiased assessment of
lhe three models; the scoring process is discussed
in more detail below. It is through this admittedly
laborious Ulld sometimes tedious process that an

to the Model II predictions.
The overrepresentation of large debitage in
the easternmost portion of the sand sheet is again
aberrant and supports the initial impression of tlie
exploitation of neru·by raw material sources. In
relation to all model predictions, the underrepresentation of large de~itage in the upland plain
site clusters is exiremely surprising. In light of
the overrepresentation of early reduction debitage
in these clusters, this pattern may indicate the
exportation of large tertiaiy flake blanks from
these raw material source areas to raw material
poor areas. Alternatively, the relative lack of
large debitage may be consistent with the use of
many sites in these clusters strictly for raw material procurement. Given that tool manufacture
would be a primary activity at such sites and most
tools would be made from large flake blanks, the
pattern may simply be an indication of Uie
extreme u!iliT.ation or selection of large debitage
for tool blanks. The overrepresentation of the
largest debitage si'ie group in the eastern cluster of
the lowland plain C; also abcITant. Given its
proximity lo the easternmost cluster in the sand
sheet, tl!e pattern may be indicative either of the
importation of large flakes from that cluster or
direct access to the same raw material sources as
those used by people utilizing the eastern sand
sheet sites. The underrepresentation of early
reduction debitage at the eastern lowland plain
sites, however, suggests that importation rather
than direct access to raw materials is the most
plausible explanation. On the other hand, tlie
underrepresentation of large debitage ln the western lowland plain cluster is consistent with the
tentative inlelpretation of U1e early reduction
debitage pattern seen in the same cluster. The
absence of large debitage may be explained by the
reduction of large flake blanks possibly imported
from upland plain sources. Flake blank reduction
would result in tlie further reduction of debitage
size and the underrepresentation of the largest size

dislrilmtion differs from the Model Ill predictions
in the lowland plain.
Because both observed lowland and upland
plain patterns are identical to those predicted
under Model I, it appears that this particular
model might best explain the disiribution of early
reduction debitage. The underrepresentation of
early reduction flakes in the central portion of the
sand sheet is not surprising either, as it is relatively far from known upland plain raw material
sources. In light of this, it is surprising tlmt early
reduction flakes occur in greater than expected
frequencies in the eastern sand sheet cluster. The
observed west to east patterning of standardized
deviates does not reflect the expected fall-off
curve with increasing distance from source.
Clearly. U1e observed pattern in the eastern portion
of the sand sheet is aberrant to all model predictions. Based on the frequency of early reduction
Oakes, it appears that the debitage collections
recovered from the eastern sand sheet sites represent the entire reduction sequence. This pattern
could be due to at least two possibilities. First is
the lransport of lesled cores from upland plain
sourees lo the eastern sand sheet. The equal to
expected early reduction debilage frequencies in
the western lowland plain (Cluster 5) might indicate the eastward lransportation of corticate flake
blanks from the upland plain sources. However,
the western sand sheet and central and eastern
lowland plain clusters have a dearth of early
reduction debitage, and this does not fit a transportation model. The second possibility is that
raw materials were acquired from relatively
nearby but presently unknown sources. As there
is no evidence supporting the long distance transportation of raw materials in most of the site
clusters located in the sand sheet and lowland
plain, the second factor may more likely account
for the observed patterns.

Debi/age Size Frequencies

class.
The observed distribution of the largest flake
size (see Fig. 47b) in the sand sheet differs from
the predicted patterns in all three models (see
Tables 17, l 8, and 19). Large flakes oci:ur in less
than expected frequencies in the cenlral and
southern upland plain rather lhan being overrepresented, as is predicted by the models. The
observed lowland plain patterns are most similar

Debitage Frtquency
The observed pattern of debitage frequencies
(see Fig. 47c) in the sand sheet, again, C; opposite
or different from the patterns predicted under all
three models (see Tables 17, 18, and 19). The
observed debitage frequencies for the upland plain
120

Chapter 7: Testing the Hunter-Gatherer Mobility and Territorial Models

are less than those predicted by any of the three
models. However, the pattern of even distribution
between the central and southern portions of the
upland plain follows the predictions of all three
models. Finally, the observed lowland plain
pattern is identical to the Model II prediction, but
differs from that of Model ill. In general, the
observed pattern is similar to the Model I predictions, although the observed west to east debitage
drop-off rate is much more rapid than predicted.
The overabundance of debitage at the erutern
sand sheet sites is eonsistent with the possibility
of a nearby raw material source. The lack of
debilage overabwidance at the two upland plain
clusters is somewhat surprising considering that
these are near the only known raw material
source. It may, however, be explained by the
exportation of large flake blanks, as opposed to
tl1e selective on-site utilization and discard of
large debitage as tool blanks. The latter pattern
should result in an increase in debitage frequencies
over the observed quantities at the upland ploin
clusters. The consistent underrepresentation of
debitage and associated overrepresentation of tools
and cores at rul lowland plain clusters suggest that
some complete tool manufaclnre sequences
occurred at the procurement sites while subsequent
resharpening and/or rejuvenation took place at
sites outside of the source areas. The early
reduction debitage and large debitage patternings
in the western lowland plain cluster, however,
suggest that the continuous staged reduction of
unfinished tools or tool blanks may have also
occurred as groups moved away from the upland
plain raw material sources.

those of both Models I and II.
The overrepresentation of cores in the
easternmost sand sheet cluster is identical to the
pattern seen in the upland plain clusters. In light
of the patterns already noted in the other artifact
categories, this supports lhe conclusion that the
lilhic debitage from this cluster is the result of the
reduction of locally available raw materials. The
overrepresentation of cores in the central cluster in
the lowland plain is also aberrant. It is impossible at present to explain why cores are overrepresented wbile all the previously discussed
lithic attributes observed in the cluster are underrepresented, A reanalysis of these cores to establish their state of reduction (e.g., degree of
exhaustion or testing) may clarify whether these
specimens represent tested cores that were being
transported to other zones without significant
reduction at sites in the cluster or cores that
arrived relatively well reduced and were subsequently exhausted and discarded there. Also, as
a difference in the raw materials exists between
the upland plain cores and the eastern sand sheet
cores, it would be instructive to identify the source
of the centrru lowland plain cores as an indication
of transportation direction.

Resharpening Flake Frequency
The observed distribution of resharpening
flakes (see Fig. 47e) in the sand sheet clusters is
identical to the Model III predictions (see Table
19). In addition, it is similar to the Models I and
II (see Tables 17 and 18) sand sheet predictions
with the exception that the observed frequency of
resharpening flakes is consistently higher tl1an
predicted by both models. The observed upland
plain pattern ii; identical to the predictions derived
from all three models. The observed pattern in the
low land plain differs significantly from those
proposed for all three models.
The overreprcsentalion of resharpening flakes
in the sand sheet clusters supporls the expectation
derived from optimal foraging theory regarding tl1e
use-intensity of oak mattes found in this zone (see
Chapter 3). Within the same framework, the
overrepresentation of resharpening flakes in the
westernmost and easternmost clusters in the
lowland plain may indicate more intensive use of
these two areas than predicted under the optimal
foraging scenario. In the case of the easternmost

Core Frequency
The high frequency of cores (sec Fig. 47d) in
tl1e eastern sand sheet cluster is opposite the
predictions derived from both Models I and II (see
Tnbles 17 and 18). Instead of a west to eru;t
decrease as in Model I or an even distribution as
in Model II, the observed core frequencies
increase toward tlie east. The pattern differs from
the Model ill predictions as well (see Table 19).
The observed upland plain pattern is identical to
the predictions proposed for all three models. The
lowland plain pattern differs from those of all
tlrrce models although, with the exception of the
central cluster in the lowland plain, it is similar to

121

Prehistoric Arch£alogy and Paleoenviro111nents in Hidalgo and Willacy Counties

cluster, however, the pattern may be generated by
the inclusion of a number of sites within and near
the coastal zone, an area assumed to have been
more intensively used than the lowland plain. The
aberrance of the westernmost cluster cwmot be
explained in a similar manner. The underrepresentation of re.1harpening flakes in both
upland plain clusters indicates that these sites
were used primarily for lithic procurement witll
only a minor amount of tool resharpening and
rejuvenation. In light of the debitage size and
debitage and core frequencies, the overrepresentation of resharpening flakes in the eastern sand
sheet cluster suggests that U1ese sites represent
habitation and lithic and nonlithic resource procurement areas. The possibility of a nearby lithlc
source, the resource richness of the sand sheet oak
mattes, and the proximity of the coast may have
acted in concert to provide a unique resource
nexus [or hunter-gatherers in the region.

central lowland plain clusters, m!lllllfacture failures
occur in frequencies equal to those expected if this
artifact type was evenly distributed across the
landscape. This pattern is consistent with the
distribution of the early reduction debitage and the
debitage size classes in the western lowland plain
cluster and supports the staged manufacture of
unfinished tools as groups moved away from the
upland plain raw material sources.

Exhausted Tool Frequencies
The observed distribution of exhausted tools
in the sand sheet clusters (see Fig. 47g) is greater
than predicted by Models I, II, or lil (see Tables
17, 18, and 19). 11ie upland plain clusters differ
from all model predictions as well; in all cases,
the observed frequencies are less than expected.
The observed lowland plain distributions differ
from those of Models I and II and are most
similar to tl1e Model Ill predictions.
The overrepresentation of exhausted tools in
the sand sheet and their equal to expected (central
portion) and lower than expected (southern portion) frequencies in the upland plain suggest that
tool discard behavior was opposite that assumed
to underlie all three models. That is, instead of
exhausted tools having been discarded at lithic
source areas, they may have been discarded
wherever they became too small to be functional.
This is reasonable if large debitage was curated
and transported to provide tool blanks when
needed. In terms of regioual land use, this
observed pattern follows the Iithic assemblage
organizations expected under highly mobile foraging systems. The assumption that exhausted tool
discard should occur at raw material sources,
within the context of gearing up preparatory to
group moves (Binford 1979:268), may best chru-acterize logistically organized systems. It appears
that the more intensively a resource area is occupied, the higher the expected frequencies of
exhausted tools will be regardless of raw material
proximity. 11ie underrepresentation of exhausted
tools in the soutliem cluster in the upland plain,
combined with the underrepresentation of resharpening flakes al these sarue sites, suggests that the
land-use pattern was not particularly oriented to
the broad based exploitation of ecotones. Instead,
sites in this cluster seem to represent primarily the
exploitation of lithic raw materials. An analysis

Manufacture Failures
The observed distribution of tool mllllllfacture
failures (see Fig. 47!) in the sand sheet clusters is
identical to the predictions derived from Model II
(see Table 18). In general, the sand sheet pattern
is similar to the Model I predictions (see Table
17) although the frequency of manufacture failures
decreases at a more rapid rate thrui proposed by
this model. The sand sheet clusters contain fewer
manufacture failures than predicted by Model III
(see Table 19). The observed upland plain pattern
agrees with the predictions derived from all three
models, while the observed lowland plain pattern
differs from the predictions of aU Urree models.
It differs most from the Model lI predictions while
having some similarity to those of Models I and

Ill.
The underrcpresentatim of manufacture
failures in the eastern sand sheet cluster is somewhat surprL,ing given the previous conclusion that
a significant proportion of the debitage collections
represent early stage core reduction and/or biface
manufacture. This pattern may indicate Uiat, in
contrast to the lithic procurement patterns in the
upland plain zone, core reduction took place at
sites in the eastern sand sheet cluster and furtlicr
reduction of blanks wid preforms occurred at sites
located in other clusters or at sites outside of the
seven clusters analyzed here. In the western and

122

Chapter 7: Te.iring the Hunter-Gatherer Mobility and Territorial Models

of exhausted tool frequencies by tool type in the
upland plain clusters indicates that in the southern
portion, both unifaces and projectile points are
underrepresented while bifaces occur io equal to
expected frequencies (see Table 16). Jn the
centrnl portion, projectile points are overrepresented while the other two tool types occur io
equal to expected frequencies.
This pattern
suggests that projectile point discard may have
been governed by factors different from those
governing the discard of other tool types. In
addition, it suggests that hunting, io association
with raw material procurement, may have been a
significant activity within the central portion of the
upland plain.
The observed values of exhausted tools equal
the expected values in the lowland plain, but the
overrepresentation of unifaces in the western
lowland plain sites is consistent with the overreprcsentation of reshaqJening flakes in that cluster
(see Table 16). The pattern appears to suggest a
greater intensity of use for these sites than for
sites in other clusters in the lowland plain even
though the overall artifact frequency is lower. The
specific reasons for the greater use-intensities
may be determined by a more careful survey of
resource types found in the area. In lhe lowland
plain, exhausted projectile points and bifaccs occur
in frequencies equal to expected, while exhausted
unifaces are overrepre.5ented in the western lowland plain cluster. This distribution suggests that
the western lowland plain was utilized for hide
processing; however, since no microwear analyses
have been conducted on the unifaces, tl1ey could
also represent plant processing (e.g., prickly pear,
agave, and sotol).

Use-broken Toal Frequencies

An even distribution of use-broken tools in
the sand sheet clusters is predicted by Models I
and II, while even but overrepresented frequencies
are predicted by Model III. The observed sand
sheet distribution differs equally from the predictions of Models I, Tl, and III (see Tables 17, 18,
and 19). The observed upland plain pattern differs
from all three models and shows a slight southerly
increase as opposed to the consistent pattern
predicted by all three models. The observed
lowland plain pattern is identical to the Model Ill
predictions, but the observed trend is similar to

123

those suggested under all models.
In the central sand sheet cluster, projectile
points are highly overrepresented, unifaces are
nnderrepresented, and bifaces occur ·]n equal to
expected frequencies (see Table 16). On U1e other
hand, the eastern sand sheet cluster shows the
three tool types occurring in frequencies equal to
those e;.pected. Within this context, the higher
than expected frequencies of use-broken projectile
points may indicate a relatively specialized use
(e.g., hunting) of the central portion of the sand
sheet.
The underrepresentation of use-broken projectile points in the central upland plain cluster is
consistent with the earlier observation that these
upland plain sites appear to have been used
primarily for raw material procurement. The
southern upland plain sites have a frequency of
use-broken tools that is equal to the expected
value. The distribution of use-broken tool types
in this cluster indicates that unifaces are overrepresented while bifaces and projectile points
occur in equal to expected frequencies. · The
implications of this are contrary to those of the
observed resharpening flake and exhausted tool
distributions and support the conclusion that
occupations in ecotonal resource zones also contained a limited resource procurement and/or
processing component in addition to raw material
procurement.

Reused Tool Frequencies
The observed distribution of reused tools in
the sand sheet is identical to that predicted under
all three models (see Tables 17, 18, and 19). The
observed upland plain pattern differs et1ually from
all three model predictions in that the southernmost cluster has a slightly higher frequency of
reused tools than proposed by the models. The
observed lowland plain pattern differs from the
predictions derived frnm all three models, although
it is most similar lo those of Model Ill.
The observed frequency of reused tools in the
centrnl sand sheet cluster is consistent with the
assumption outlined in Chapter 3 that reused tool
frequency increases as the dlstance from raw
material sources and site use-intensity increase.
The overrepresentation of reused tools in the
easternmost cluster, however, does not fit the
assumption if earlier conclusions regarding the

-------------==------iiiiiili--------

Prehistoric Archeology and Pa/eoe11viro11ments in Hidalgo and Willacy Coumies

proximity of raw materials to this cluster are
correct. It is possible that use-intensity conditioned the rnte of tool reuse. In olher words, site
use-intensity may have had an equal or greater
effect on tool reuse frequency than did distance
from raw material sources. This conclusion may
be consistent with the foraging land-use system
suggested for the project area. Reused tools may
represent the use of readily available items (e.g.,
broken tools) as opposed to backup tools to
replace use-broken specimens. The availabllity of
backup tool kits may be more characteristic of
collector systems. The overrepresentation of
reused tools at the westernmost sites in the lowland plain is consistent with the observed freqnencies of resharpening flakes and exhausted tools.
Overall, the pattern of lithic artifact frequencies in
sites in d1is cluster suggests greater occupational
intensity than at sites in clnsters located farther
east.

inverse relationship explanation. The observed
lowland plain pattern follows, with one exception,
the relationship outlined ander Model I although
the edge-modified flake frequencies are higher
than predicted under the model. The overrepresentation of edge-modified flakes in the westernmost cluster of the lowland plain does not follow
the predictions.

Mean Number of Working Edges per Uniface
In the sand sheet, the observed mean number
of workiag edges per uniface differs from all three
model predictions (see Tables 17, 18, and 19). In
the upland plain, the observed ls identical to all
three model predictions. The pattern noted in the
lowland plain is most similar to the predictions
under Model Ill.
Within the sand sheet, the observed pattern
differs from that predicted in the models only in
the central portion of the zone. Here a slightly
lower tlian predicted mean number of working
edges is observed, This pattern is difficult to
explain, especially in light of the overrepresentation of exhausted, use-broken, and reused tools in
this portion of the sand sheet. The increased
nnmber of working edges farther east in the zone
suggests that U1is attribute was conditioned by
distance from mw material sources. The greater
than expected mean number of working edges per
unifoce in the eastern portion of the zone, even in
light of a possible nearby raw material source,
suggests that use-intensity may also have affected
the attribute. The lower than expected mean numbers of working edges in the central and southern
portions of the upland plain support tllis conclusion. That is, given ready raw material availability, tool use-intensity was reduced. The overall
equal to expected mean uumber of working edges
per uniface in die lowland plain is consistent with
the observation that the attribute was at least
partially conditioned by environmental zone useintcnsity. The trend in the lowland plain clusters
indicates that distance from raw material sources
also played an important role in determining the
intensity of tool use.

Edge-modified Flakes
The observed distribution of edge-modified
flakes relative to nnmoilified dcbitage ia the sand
sheet clusters (see Table 16 and Fig. 47) does not
fit any of the three models (see Tables 17, 18, and
19). '!be observed upland plain pattern also differs from the predictions derived from the three
models, as the frequency is more than eJ<pected
for any portion of the npland plain. The observed
lowland plain pattern differs from the predictions
of all models as well. The slight increase in the
relative frequency of edge-modified flakes between the central and eastern portions of the low. land plain suggests a trend similarity to Model I,
although !he western portion is greatly dissimilor.
Based on Model I, the frequency of edgemodified flakes relative to unmodified debitage is
predicted to increase wiU1 increasing distance from
raw material sources in intensively used zones.
The observed sand sheet patlem is the opposite of
this expectation, suggesting that the actual relationship between edge-modified flake frequencies
and raw material distance is the inverse of the one
proposed. However, the likelihood o[ a raw
material source near the eastemmosl sand sheet
cluster may ex.plain the underrepresentation of
edge-modified flukes in a fashion consistent with
the assumptions underlying the Model I predictions. The high frequency of edge-modified
flakes in Ure upland plain clusters supports die

upland plain -differ from the three model predictions (see Tables 17, 18, and 19). The observed
lowland plain pattern shows a spatial trend
through the clusters opposite of that predicted in
Model I and differing slightly from the predictions
of Models II and III.
The decline between the central and eastern
clusters in the sand sheet may be a function of the
availability of raw material sources adjacent to
the easternmost site cluster. The similarity to the
pattern noted in the frequency of edge-modified
flakes supports this conclusion. A decline in the
mean number of utilized edges is expected in the
upland plain compared to the sand sheet; however,
a slight increase is documented. An overall pattern identical to that of the upland plain is seen in
the lowland plain clusters, although the cluster
patterns are notably different.

score in the upland plain. This suggests that the
individual models are able to predict the effects of
known raw material sources with a reasonable and
equal degree of accuracy. Model II ranks slightly
higher than the other two models in the sand sheet,
however, it is clear from the results of the analysis
that an undocumented raw material source in the
sand sheet is a possibility. Once the location of
this source becomes known, models sho1.Jld be
constructed that take this into account. and it is
probable that their scores would improve markedly
in the sand sheet. In the lowland plain, Model I
ranks the highest, and with new model fonnulation
that takes into account a sand sheet raw material
source, the model scores would improve. Additionally, a temporal shift in exploitation patterns
between a coastal-oriented and a Rio Grande
floodplain-oriented system should be considered
as a possibility, but without better temporal
controls on. the material remains, it is impossible
to distinguish between a temporally collapsed
pattern that simply looks like Model I and a
system that actually functions like Model I. Thus,
the higher score for Model I must be viewed
cautiously. As stated above, the highest score is
15 points (41.7%) in Model I. This suggests that
more than half of the obseived variability was not
accounted for by any of the three models.
Clearly, this implies that the models are not very
robust or the specific model expectations need
fine-tWling and adjustment. The integration of a
sand sheet raw material source, if it can be documented, is one such important adjustment.
In an attempt to summarize the patterns
discussed in the analysis above and to consider the
possibility that unrecognized patterns may be
inherent in the data base, a factor analysis was run
on the standardized deviates in Table 16. Again,

Conclusions of Site Cluster Comparisons
A simple procedure is used to assess the
relative merits of the models. For each attribute
distribution, a single point is a warded for an exact
match between the model predictions and the
observed values in a specific environmental zone
(see Tables 17, 18, and 19). For example, the
Model III debitage frequency in the lowland plain
equals one point for an exact match. Also, a
single point is given for a similar trend match,
e.g., a change from higher to lower across an
environmental zone. This is done because at this
level of model development, it must be realized
that the predicted values might vary slightly from
the statistical standardized deviates, and it is the
trend change rather than the absolute predicted
value that is important. An example of a similar
trend match is the Model III manufacture failures
in the lowland plain. As twelve attribute distributions are used in the present analysis and site
clusters occur in three environmental zones, a
perfect score would be 36 for each model. However, if an exact match or a trend match does not
occur between the observed values and the model
predictions, then no score is given. This occurs a
number of times, e.g., debitage size in the lowland
plain in all three models. Table 20 illustrates the
scores for each model by environmental zone, the
total score, and the percent score. Model I has the
highest score (41.7%), Model II the next highest
(36.1%). and Model III the lowest (33.3%).
Interestingly, all three models have the same high
125

Prehistoric Archeology and Paleoenvironments in Hidalgo and Willacy Counties

the dual purpose is summary and exploratory.
The site clusters are used as individual cases and
the analytical attributes as variables; thus, the
results have spatial implications. The factor
analysis uses the manufacture failure, exhausted
tool, and use-broken tool standardized deviates
derived for individual tool categories (i.e., unifaces, bifaces, and projectile points) rather than
those for these categories combined. The factor
extraction method employed is principal components. An oblique rotation with a varimax solution was selected because it does not assume that
individual factors are independent of each other as
does an orthogonal rotation procedure.
Five factors are identified, and the factor
loadings for the artifact attributes are listed in
Table 21. Factor loadings equal to or greater ilian
0.500 are considered significant. In general, the
patterns are in strong agreement with the previous
discussions, but additional insights are gained by
a careful examination of the individual factors.
Factor I has a bipolar pattern with high
negative loadings on four attributes--early reduction debitage, cores, use-broken unifaces, and
projectile point manufacture failures-and high
positive loadings on resharpening flakes, uniface
manufacture failures, exhausted unifaces, reused
tools, and mean number of utilized edges per
uniface. This is a complex factor that appears to
generally characterize tool production and tool
maintenance, but it is likely that raw material
availability, tool curation, and tool use-intensity
all play a role in the characterization of this
factor.
Factor II has a bipolar pattern with high
positive loadings on three attributes--early reduction debitage, debitage frequency, and biface
manufacture failures-and high negative loadings
on exhausted and use-broken bifaces. This factor
can be interpreted as reflecting biface manufacture,
use, and discard. It seems logical that biface
production, as reflected by biface manufacture
failures, occurs with early reduction debitage and
that intensively used bifaces, as indicated by
exhausted and use-broken bifaces, do not occur
with the manufacturing of bifaces. This implies
transportation of bifaces away from the locales of
manufacture.
Factor ill, a bipolar factor, has high positive
loadings on debitage frequency and core frequency
and high negative loadings on edge-modified

flakes and mean number of utilized edges per
edge-modified flake. This factor seems to reflect
use-intensity of edge-modified flakes as conditioned by raw material availability. It can be
argued that it measures at least one dimension of
tool curation where intensively utilized flakes were
not discarded in areas of readily available raw
materials. Or perhaps rather than suggesting the
transportation of edge-modified flakes away from
source areas, the factor is indicative of the moreintensive use of debitage as expedient tools in
environmental zones with low raw material availability.
Factor IV, again a bipolar factor, has high
negative loadings on projectile point manufacture
failures and exhausted projectile points and a high
positive loading on use-broken projectile points.
This factor seems to indicate that exhausted
projectile points were discarded at the loci of
manufacture, as reflected by their association with
manufacture failures. This factor could be used to
suggest that discard patterns among projectile
points differ depending on the reason for discard.
Exhausted projectile points, i.e., projectile points
that remained functional throughout their use-lives,
may have been discarded in expectation of breakage or failure at the loci of projectile point manufacture, while use-broken projectile points were
discarded wherever they broke.
Factor V is the only nonbipolar pattern and
has high positive loadings on large debitage and
use-broken unifaces. This factor seems to indicate the possibility that large debitage was transported away from the material sources to the
locales of uniface use, at least as indicated by the
occurrence of use-broken unifaces.
Taken as a whole, the results of the factor
analysis provide some useful insights into the
assumptions made by the various models. It is
clear that many variables are controlled by more
than one factor (see variable complexity in Table
21). For example, debitage frequency has high
loadings on both Factors II and III suggesting that
the occurrence of debitage is not controlled by a
single process. In this case, the production and
use of bifacial tools and edge-modified flakes are
different activities that are independently correlated among the site clusters as shown by the
intercorrelations in Table 22. It is significant also
that the only two factors that have even moderately high, albeit negative, correlations are Factors

factors do not co-occur in space. Factor II
reflects pattcming of bifaces, and Factor IV
primarily indicates patterning among prnjcctile

of flake blanks from raw material sources in other
areas may explain these inverse patterns, The
observed total debitagc frequencies may b~ due to
the convergent effect of two factors, raw material
nvailobility and environmental wnc use-intensity.
The exportation of large flake blanks may have
reduced debitage frequencies even at source areas.
In addition, the production of only early reduction
stage specimens at procurement locations may
have further conlributed lo low debitage frequencies. Bolh of these factors, combined with low
use-intensity, may characterize and explain the
observed upland plain pattern. The probable
presence of a lithic sonrce near the eastern portion
of the sand sheet, coupled with greater useintensity, may have generated an overreprcsentation of debi!age in this zone in contrast to !he
upland plain. Similarly, the underrepresentation of
debitage in the lo.wland plain is probably due both
to its lack of raw materials and low use-intensity.
The frequencies of manufacture failures
parallel those of cores and early reduction
debitage. Contrary to the raw material blank
exportation hypoU1esis, the lack of a distancerelated trend in manufacture-broken specimen
frequencies suggests that most manufacture
occurred at the sources. The relative frequencies
of exhausted and reused tools parallel each other
and are opposite the trend noted in core frequencies. It appears that, in addition to raw material
availability, these two attributes were also conditioned by resource use-intensity. In the sand sheet
where cores are underrepresented but use-intensity
is presumed to be high, exhausted and reused tool
frequencies arc also high. Where core frequencies
are high but use-intensity is low, l.e., the upland
plain, the relative frequencies of reused and
exhausted tools are also low. Where core frequencies nm low but use-intensity is presumed
moderate, i.e., the lowland plain, the two attributes also occur in moderate frequencies. Usehroken tools are evenly distributed across tile
landscape. There are some indirect and complex
ways in which tool breakage may be related to
distance from raw matelial sources and resource
zone use-intensity. However, the distribution of
use-broken specimens suggests that neither of !he
two variables conditioned U1cir breakage or their
spatial distribution. Rather, it is probable that
loo! breakage and subsequent discard was conditioned by a complex relationship between tool

Environmental Zone Comparisons
The previous discussion focused primarily on
a comparison of observed lilhk atlributes to !he
expected patterns as proposed by the three
models. The goal was to establish the definition
of the land-use patterns employed by the prehistoric inhabitants of the region as exhibited by the
twelve lilhk attributes. This section summarizes
the observed patterns in liUtic attributes by environmental zone (sec Table 17; Fig 48) and relates
them lo lithic procurement strategies and the
organization of teclu10logy.
One of the assumplions underlying the models
outlined in Oiapter 3 is that core freqnencies
should be related to raw material availability as
conditioned by quantity or distance from sources.
Furthermore, from a technological point of view,
raw material availability should affect the relative
frequencies of early reduction debitagc, the largest
nake size class relative to smaller size classes,
and overall debitage. Also, it was assumed that,
in a less direct way, raw material availability
affe<:ts the relative frequencies of resharpening
flakes and manufacture-broken, exhausted, usebroken, and reused tools, as well as the mean
number of working edges per scraper. With tl1c
exception of manufacture-broken specimens, these
attributes also should he affected by resource wne
use-intensity,
The observed overall upland plain pattern
indicates an overrepresentalion of cores; they arc,
however, underrepresented in the other two zones.
The observed frequencies of early reduction
dcbitagc parallel core frequencies, but the frequencies of lnrgc debitagc appenr to heh.ave in an
inverse pattern to core frequencies, with the sand
sheet having the greatest frequency of lnrgc flakes.
As noted earlier, however, the possible occurrence
of a lithic raw material source in the eastern
portion of the sand sheet and/or the transportation

tool use-intensity was inversely related to raw
material availability. However, because of the
consistent overrepresentation of resharpening
flakes in both the sand sheet and the lowland
plain, it appears that their frequencies responded
in a stepped manner rather than in a gradual,
distance-related manner to raw material availability. That is, much of the debitage at sites located
in areas where raw materials were not available,

type, the nature of the task, relationships between
morphologically weak points, break probability
and subsequent potential for reworking and/or
reuse, and raw material type, to mention only a
few.
The frequencies of reshatpening flakes are
inversely related to the frequencies of manufacture
failures, cores, and early reduction debitage. The
pattern supports the underlying assumption that
129

Prehistoric Archeology and Paieoe11vironme11ts in Hidalgo and Willacy Cou/l/ies

regardless of distance from sources, consists of
resharpening flakes. The pattern strongly supports
the suggested limited role of staged reduction
manufacture sequences in the regional land-use
pattern.
The parallels between the mean number of
working edges per uniface and the exhausted and
reused tool frequencies are not surprising. They
indicate, consistent with earlier conclusions, that
tool use-intensity responded to wne use-intensity
and raw material availability. The pallern of
edge-modified flake frequencies, especially in
contrast to total debitage frequencies, presents a
consistent regional picture. The sand sheet, with
a greater than expected overall total debitage
frequency, has a low overall edge-modified flake
frequency relative to w1modified debitagc. The
upland plain, with overall debitage frequencies
equal to the expected, has obseived edgemodified flake frequencies also equal to the
expected. In contrast, the lowland plain, with low
overall debitage frequencies, has greater than
expected frequencies of edge-modified flakes
compared to unmodified flakes. The obscivcd
overall regional pattern supports the inverse
relationship between edge-modified flake and
unmodified debitage frequencies outlined in Model
I. The comparison of the obseived patterns
between the three environmental zones indicutes
that the mean number of working edges per edgemodified flake was conditioned neither by raw
material conslraints nor occupation intensity. This
conclusion is consistent with the general perspective of edge-modified flakes representing expedient tools. The patterns suggest that the use and
discard of expedient tools were not conslrained by
the same factors as were the use and discard of
formal, shaped tools.

understanding of the primary factors that conditioned the spatial distribution of artifacts left by
prehistoric groups occupying the Lower Rio
Gronde Valley during the late Holocene, If ihe
predictions arc accurate, then it is assumed that
the controlling factors are sufficiently understood
so that an explanation of the artifact discard aod
settlement system is more or less at hand,
Although sample sizes from individual sites are
extremely small, it is suggested that lhe regional
data base offers interpretable patterns of resource
use and that these sites provide data that coo be
used as "'' initial test of tlic models.
Two levels of analysis were undertaken.
Sites were first grouped into seven clusters
because of small artifact samples from individual
sites, and the patterns for each cluster were
compared to the model expectations on a cluster
by cluster bnsis. On a larger scale, tl1e same
attribute dislributions were analyzed by environmental zone.
Possibly because of small sample sizes, the
clearest artifact distributional pallems are at the
environmental level. The frequencies of early
reduction debitage, cores, and manufacture failure.~
arc spatially correlated and concenlrated in the
upland plain. Resharpening flakes are inversely
correlated to these three categories with concentrations occurring in the sand sheet and lowlund
plain. These patterns appear to have been conditioned primarily by the availability of raw material. Large debitllge, exhausted tools, reused
tools, and high mean numbers of utilized uniface
edges occur in a distinctive pattern with the greatest concenlrutions in the sand sheet and tl1e least
in the upland plain. It is possible that this pattern
reflects tlie exportation of lithie raw materials into
areas of low raw material availability. Second, it
is possible that the frequencies of exhausted and
reused tools were influenced by enviromnental
wne use-intensity. Edge-modified flakes, with
conccnlrations in the lowland plain, are inversely
associated with debitage frequency, with a concentration in tlie sand sheet. Tiie frequencies of
these artifact categories also appear to have been
conditioned by raw material availability nnd environmental wne use-intensity. Only use-broken
tools occur evenly throughout all three environmental zones, and this may reflect a series of
relationships that are not related to raw material
availability or environmcnLal zone use-intensity.

SUMMARY /\.'ID CONCLUSIONS

111e major purpose of this chapter is to test
lhe three hunrer-galherer mobility and tenitorial
models proposed in Chapter 3. This analysis
provides a framework for understanding the
archeological record from a broad regional perspective. More specifically, these models were
developed to predict li!hic assemblage patterns
recovered from arcbeo!ogical investigations along
the Hidalgo-Willacy Drainage Ditch. The prediction of assemblage patterns is crucial to gaining an

Chapter 7: Testing the Hunter-Gatherer Mobility and Territorial Models

While more difficult to interpret, analysis on
the level of site clusters provides a level of understanding that is complementary to that obtained
from the analysis by environmental zone. 1be site
cluster approach suggests that Model I, a nonterritorial exploitation pattern, may explain more of
the variability observed in the regional data base
than the other two models, but no model accoWlts
for a majority of the variability observed in the
collections.
Early reduction debitage, large
debitage, debitage frequency, and core frequency
all point to the possible existence of an eastern
sand sheet lithic raw material source, or, alternatively, the transportation of lithic materials to the
area in an unreduced form. While some manufacture sequences began and were finished at or near
the lithic procurement areas, some tool manufacture appears to have occurred in staged sequences
across the landscape. Exchange of tool blanks
across hunter-gatherer territorial boundaries is a
possibility, but if a spatial exploitation pattern
similar to Model I was in place for most of the
late Holocene, much of the west to east movement
of raw materials would not have required
exchange between bands. Formal tools were not
discarded with the same constraints as expedient
tools, and, in fact, some types of formal tools
were discarded differently from other types of
formal tools. In general, exhausted tool distributions suggest that these artifacts were not discarded at raw material sources, but rather exhausted
tools were discarded when and where they wore
out. Exhausted projectile points are an exception
to this rule, however, and appear to have been
discarded at the loci of manufacture. These
results suggest that the replacement strategy for
formal tools varies and that some tools were
replaced near a material source in "expectation of
failure," while others were "replaced upon exhaustion" (Kuhn 1989).
Although the three models, by their nature,
are simplified explanations, and the conclusions
from the archeological analyses are preliminary,
the regional perspective offers four important
considerations for future research. First, the
aberrance of the eastern sand sheet is well documented in the lithic analysis, and it highlights the
potential for an unknown lithic raw material
source in this area. As stated above, the certainty
rather than the presumption of a lithic source in
the eastern sand sheet would greatly alter the

expectations of any theoretical model that
attempted to explain hunter-gatherer mobility and
exploitation patterns.
Second, the formal test of the models included only chipped stone artifact samples and other
data can be brought to bear on this issue. Figure
49a illustrates the distribution of all archeological
sites recorded at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory from Hidalgo, Willacy, and
Cameron counties as of December 1989. The
overall distribution of these sites is strongly
controlled by research intensity, and it would be a
mistake to read occupational intensity directly
from recorded site density. Rather, it is more
prudent to compare the occurrence of materials
and the occurrence of known sites.
In this portion of Texas, marine shells are
widely used as alternative materials for tool
manufacture, and it is expected that huntergatherer exploitation patterns that focused on the
coast, or alternatively the Rio Grande floodplain,
would have produced distinctively different distributional patterns of marine shell artifacts. Figure
49b shows that the drop-off rate of marine shells
away from the coast is not dramatic, and this
could support Model I or Model m. On the other
hand, the rather limited distribution of obsidian is
coastal, although only seven sites are known to
have obsidian artifacts and thus this distribution
may be due only to small sample size (Fig. 49c).
Most ceramics in the region are Haustecan or
Haustecan-like and are not considered to be of
local manufacture. The distribution of ceramics
shows greater concentrations along the coast and
Rio Grande floodplain, but again, this may be due
to sample size (Fig. 49d). The stable isotope
analysis of human bones (see Chapter 6) suggests
that distinct coastal and inland dietary groups may
have existed. The stable isotope patterns, as well
as the obsidian and ceramic distributions, tentatively support an exploitation pattern similar to
Model II. Obviously, future investigations should
formally incorporate these and other lines of
evidence to more clearly elucidate the patterning
of hunter-gatherer exploitation in the region.
Third, much of the difficulty of evaluating the
fit between model expectations and observed
archeological patterns is due to the absence of
archeological data from two environmental zones.
The Rio Grande floodplain and delta are not
represented, and insufficient samples are available

from the coast. It is in these areas that ethnographic documents and the models predict that the
most intensive prehistoric utilization occurred, and
thus the models have been tested by investigating
the fringes of the region and not the core areas.
Given this limitation, the testing of the models and
assessment of the organization of technology for
the Lower Rio Grande Valley was surprisingly
successful.
However, future archeological
research should concentrate on clarifying the role
of these two environmental zones in prehistoric
land...:use patterns.
Finally, it is clear that tl1e environmental
variables that conditioned hunter-gatherer
responses are not fully known, especially in terms
of a temporal trajectory. Continued collection of
paleoenvironmental data should help to resolve
this problem; however, a coordinated approach

133

between the collection and analysis of paleoenvironmental data· and archeological research is
important. Otherwise, paleoenvironmental data
will accumulate that will not provide'lnformation
useful for archeological analysis. In addition, it is
unclear if appropriate temporal controls on the
archeological data base can easily be obtained, but
efforts must be made to acquire this data base as
well.
The previous discussion has identified a
number of inaccuracies demonstrating that the
models, and thus the interpretations, require
alteration and fine-tuning. This is a normal and
expected result. The current work constitutes an
attempt to identify where and how this fine-tuning
should proceed, thus providing directions for future
investigations in the region.

CONCLUSIONS AND SITE ASSESSMENTS

8

by C. Britt Bousman and Steve A. Tomka

This final chapter presents a summary of the
results of this project and some conclusions and
speculations on the archeology and paleoenvironments in South Texas. These investigations have
focused on what many might consider unworthy
archeological sites, but it must be remembered that
most of the archeological record for the Lower
Rio Grm1de Valley consists of exactly these types
of sites. It is argued herein that these sites can
provide informative and significant data that
clearly inlluence interpretations of the prehistory
of South Texas. In addition, the integration of
archeological and paleoenvironmental studies,
including gcoarcheology, provides the information
necessary to develop reasonable research strategies that maxirni7!! the retrieval of archeological
and paleoenvironmental data. The sections that
follow present the results of the geological studies,
the archeological interpretations, and an assessment of the individual archeological sites.

which demonstrates a continual development and
build-up of these soil profiles into the historic
period. Most of the archeological sites are
located in or on the edge of small wind-deflated
basins known as blowouts. It appears that these
blowouts were scoured some time before the late
Holocene, although not necessarily synchronously,
and the modern soils began to form after the
scouring events.
Second, the Beaumont, Lissie, and Goliad
formations are presumably much older than tl1e
fusl human occupation in North America and thus
cannot contain in situ archcologicnl remains. Jn
the upper, highly weathered portion of these
formations, calcium carbonate nodules are
common at all sites. These calcium carbonate
nodules file of pedogenic origin, and dated inner
nnd outer frnctions of two samples from 4lHG128
demonstrate the probable existence of a late
Pleistocene soil. Tiie radiocarbon ages range from
17,350 and 16,330 B.P. on the inner fractions to
12,780 nnd 15,010 B.P. on the outer fractious.
These dates show that the nodules did, in fact,
build up chronologically. The degree of weathering in the upper portion of tlie Goliad, Lissie, and
Beaumont formations, the documentation of an
unconformity bet ween tl1e modem soil and the
underlying Pliocene and Pleistocene formations,
and the radiocarbon ages all imply the existence
or a truncated late Pleistocene soil.
Third, the analyses of oxygen and carbon
stable isotopes suggest that climatic warming
occurred very early, i.e., by 15,000 B.P., and that

GEOLOGICAL RESULTS
The results of the geological investigations
can be summarized as three major points. First,
all in situ archeological remains are in a single
cumulative soil that sits unconformably on the
Pliocene and Pleistocene Beaumont, Lissie, or
Goliad formations. The base of this soil has been
dated to 4300 B.P. at 41HG128, to 1260 B.P. at
41 WYl12, and to 2560--3040 B.P, at 41WY113.
A series of more recent dates are scattered
throughout this soil in proper stratigraphic order,

135

Prehistoric Archeology and Paleoe11viro11me11ts in Hidalgo and Willacy Counties

the late Pleistocene and early Holocene plant
communities were dominated by C4 and CAM
species. If the 9360 B.P. date for the tortoise
remains from 41WY140 is correct and if the
tortoise remains documented by Westgate (1987)
are roughly coeval with this individual, then it
appears tliat conditions were not dramatically
harsh at that time. It is possible that tl1c late
Pleistocene soil was still in place. Glacial
sequences from tl1e United States and Mexico
demonstrate that terminal Pleistocene environments
fluctuated greatly (Richmond and Fullerton 1986;
White 1986), however, and the pollen profiles
from Boriack and Gause bogs in east-central
Texas support this interpretation (Bryant 1977;
Bryant and Holloway 1985). Thus, it is possible
that the Willacy County tortoise remains date to
one or more warm interval in the terminal Pleistocene period. Unfortunately, no palcoenvironmental data are available for most of the early
Holocene, so the climatic conditions that accompanied the erosion of the late Pleistocene soil are
undocumented. In general, the paleocnvironmental
data recovered from tl1e Hidalgo-Willacy Drainage Ditch support a general model of fluctuating
climatic conditions throughout the late Pleistocene
and Holocene (Black 1989:12-14), altl1ough it is
clear that more data are needed to provide the
level of detail necessary for meaningful paleoenvironmcntal interpretations for South Texas.
GEOLOGICAL MODEL

T11e three major results discussed above
require explanation and allow the formation of a
model. As most of the tested sites occur on the
edges of and in deflationary basins, the obvious
scenario is that increased wind activity aided by
drier conditions during the early to middle Holocene removed sediments. The dates from the
extant surface soil and from the calcium carbonate
nodules discussed above, indicate that a late
Pleistocene soil was removed sometime between
12,780 and 4300 B.P. The tortoise might indicate
tliat erosion began after 9400 B.P. It was not
until after approximately 5000 B.P. that tl1e latest
episode of sediment storage occurred and cumulative soils began to form in these basins; additionally, direct evidence of the first human occupation
in tl1e region postdates 5000 B.P., i.e., the
136

41WY60 burial dated to 4495 B.P.
T11is model of erosion associated with a dry
episode is supported by geomorphic evidence from
41HGll8 where a gully eroded into a Beaumont
Formation knoll began to fill by 4500 B.P. (Hall
et al. 1987; Collins et al. 1989). This suggests
that early to middle Holocene erosion may have
been fairly widespread. Other supportive evidence
comes from sediment analysis at Arcnosa Shelter
(Patton and Dibble 1982:111) and a variety of
pollen spectra (Bryant and Holloway 1985:56)
from the Lower Pecos River region where an early
Holocene dry period occurs by 9000 B.P. (Fig.
50). To the north of the Lower Rio Grande
Valley at Choke Canyon Reservoir in Live Oak
County and at Cole to Creek in Goliad County,
phytolitl1 analyses suggest that C4 grasses probably
were widespread during the early to middle
Holocene and that a significant dry phase occurred
during this time (Robinson 1979, 1982). All of
these studies demonstrate the existence of an early
to middle Holocene dry interval, and it is likely
that similar climatic conditions existed in South
Texas during this time as well. However, if
erosion removed the late Pleistocene soil and other
surficial sediments in far South Texas, where were
tl1ese sediments deposited?
A few geological studies from nearby areas
provide data that may answer this question. At
Choke Canyon Reservoir (Bunker 1982:498-517),
Applewhite Reservoir (Rolfe Mandel, personal
communication 1989), and the middle Pedemales
River (Blum 1989:13-15), thick, fine-grained,
silty, terrace deposits date from the terminal
Pleistocene to the middle Holocene (see Fig. 50).
The Applewhite terrace sediments comprise a
significant proportion of the middle Medina River
valley fill and are tentatively identified as eolian
silt deposits similar to locss (Rolfe Mandel,
personal communication 1989). In addition, an
unstudied 10-12-m silty teITace, very similar to
the terraces in Applewhite Reservoir, has been
observed by the primary autlmr on tl1c Guadalupe
River as it flows off the Edwards Plateau.
Lastly, between these sites and the HidalgoWillacy Drainage Ditch is tl1e extensive South
Texas sand sheet. The geological history of the
sand sheet is unknown, nevertheless it is possible
that significant portions date to the terminal
Pleistocene and early Holocene, as stabilized
dunes witl1in it arc aligned along the modem

predominant wind directions (as shown by wind
roses in Fig. 50) suggesting recent deposition.
It is possible that terminal Pleistocene and
early Holocene wind erosion removed a significant
amount of sediment from the coastal region of
Texas. Sea levels were ca. 20 m lower at that
time, and unconsolidated fluvial deposits along the
coastal plain would have been available for wind
erosion (see Fig. 50). If large amounts of sediment were transported by wind, then the coarser
sand particles would have been transported the

shortest distances and the finer grained sediments
would have been carried much farther. The
modem surface wind patterns in this region are
dominated by winds from the south to southeast,
and Central Texas is in a direct line from these
prevailing winds (see Fig. 50). Also, the Balcones
Escarpment is the only major obstruction to winds
from the coast, although the smaller Bordas
Escarpment, which is the approximate location of
Choke Canyon Reservoir, is a minor obstructional
feature. Thus, as wind blows up and over the
137

Prehistoric Archeology a11d Pa/eoe11viro11mellfs in Nida/go and Willacy Countie.r

escrupments, it loses energy and speed, and this
loss of energy would be enough to reduce the
amount of sediment transported. It is of more
than passing interest that in a worldwide series of
computerclimutic simulatioru calculated at 3,000year intervals between 18,000 and 0 B.P., based
oo Milankovitch orbital parameters (eccentricity,
axial tilt, and precession), the strongest southern
wind flows in South Texas w~-re simulated for
9000 and 6000 B.P., while levels at 12,000 and
3000 B.P. were near modem wind speeds
(COHMAP 1988: 1048), If the computer simulations are correct, then these early Holocene winds
could have eroded the late Pleistncene soil in
South Texas.
A modem study of eolian deposition on the
Edwards Plateau shows that tl1e Pedemales River
basin, Applewhite Reservoir, and tl1e middle
Guadalupe River valley rue in or downstream
from the portion of tlte Edwards Plateau tlmt
receives the greatest amounts of modem eolian
accumulalions (Robonhorst et al. 1984; Rabenhorst
and Wilding 1986). Unfortunately, the sources of
the modem Edwards Plateau eolian sediments
were not identified in this study, but a significant
sediment source area could be the Texns coast, as
suggested above from modem and simulated wind
pattems. While modern eolian deposition rates
are low (1 cm per 1000 years), the study was
conducted during a fairly wet yeru· (1981) which
would hove reduced the eolian transportation rate.
If fact, Rabenhorst and Wilding (1986:685) state
that variations in eolian sedimentation would be
expected with climatic changes. It is suggested
that changing climate toward more mesic conditions after 5000 D.P. and rising sea levels
throughout the early Holocene culminating with tl1e
+ 1.5-m proposed sea level highstand dated to ca.
4500 D.P. (Prewitt and Paine 1987), would have
limited the amow1t of eolian erosion near the coast
and reduced deposition inland,
In sum, the geological data recovered on this
project and other archeological projects in the
region can be used to construct a geological model
for the late Pleistocene and Holocene. I! is
suggested that an early Holocene dry period was
of sufficient magnitude to allow wind erosion that
removed the late Pleistocene surface soil and pond
deposits from blowouts and otl1cr areas that now
dot the low-lying areas near tl1e present coastline.
Additional sediment sources could have been the

portion of the coastal plain that is now submerged
but was exposed by lower sea levels during the
late Pleistocene and early Holocene, or any of the.
fairly unconsolidated Eocene or more recent
fluviaJ/deltaic formations that ring the coastal
region. In South Texas, wind flow may have been
strong enough to transport significant quantities of
sediment nortl1westword.
The heavier sands
chopped out to form a portion of the South Texas
sand sheet, while the lighter silts continued to be
carried to the Balcones Escarpment where they
were dumped on the flanks and top of the
Edwards Plateau due to a drop in wind speed. It
is possible that the wind-borne sediment loads
were large enough to partially choke rl1c drainage
systems along rl1e edges of the Balcones Escarpment, and this might accouut for the homogeneous
lextures foond in some terraces which were apparently stream deposited. If this model is generally
correct, it may help ID explain why so little
information hos been recovered on late Pleistocene
and eru·Iy Holocene occupations in the Lower Rio
Grande Valley. It can also be suggested that early
Holocene sites with good archeological integrity
are likely to occur in eolioo deposits, such as the
clay dunes near the large inland playas (e.g., La
Sal Viejo). At present this model should be considered as an untested hypothesis that can and
should be assessed by future research, and it is
proposed, in part, as a polemic designed to
enoourage the collection of additional paleoenvironmental data and stimulate more dialogue
on paleoenvironmental change in South Texas.

ARCHEOLOGICAL RESULTS
Five prehistoric sites were tested during
Phase JI investigations along the Hidalgo-Willacy
Drainage Ditch. A summary of the results of
individual site investigations is presented. These
are followed by the results of the radiocarbon
dating of human remains and then by rl1e results of
the artifact analysis.
At 41HG128, eleven lxl-m test units were
excavated, and a total of 107 artifacts were
recovered from the excavations. Another nine
artifacts were collected from the surface. Most of
the excavated artifacts are very small flakes and
were recovered in the upper levels witl1 associated
radiocarbon ages ranging from 120 to 480 B.P. A
small number of artifacts were recovered from

138

Chapter 8: Conclusions and Site Assessments

deposits that could be as old as 4300 B.P. Two
possible cultural features were identified. One
possible prehistoric feature consisted of burned
clay lumps and associated large charcoal fragments. The charcoal yielded a radiocarbon age of
320 B.P. Nine lithic flakes were recovered in
association with this feature. It is possible that
the charcoal and burned clay lumps are the result
of a natural fire and die artifacts are fortuitously
associated. The second feature was a pit clearly
outlined in profile, but the associated radiocarbon
age is young (i.e., 120 B.P.) and it could be
historic in age. Prehistoric artifact associations
with this feature were unclear. In summary, this
site was utilized during the late Holocene and
probably for short periods at sporadic intervals.
At 41WY112, a magnetometer survey was
completed and eleven lxl-m test units were
excavated. A total of 25 artifacts were recovered
from the excavations, and 7 artifacts were collected from the surface. The majority of excavated artifacts at 41WY112 occur in the upper
levels below the zones of historic disturbance and
appear to be younger than 1260 B.P. It is not
possible to provide more accurate chronological
control for these artifacts. 1bis site appears to
have been sporadically occupied during the latter
half of the late Holocene.
A magnetometer survey was completed at
41WY113, and four lxl-m test unit were excavated. Only six artifacts were recovered from the
excavations and two were collected from the surface. Two features have been documented at this
site. In 1986, a human burial was excavated, and
during the present project, a cluster of deer bones
and one bone artifact were documented. Collagen
from the human burial was dated to 1088 B.P.,
and collagen from the deer bones yielded a radiocarbon age of 2560 B.P. As some of the artifacts
are near the top of the undisturbed deposits, this
site reflects very light utilization over a long
period of time during the late Holocene.
At 41WY134, four lxl-m test units were
excavated but as no artifacts were recovered, no
radiocarbon samples were submitted from this
site. lt appears that the focus of prehistoric occupation was north of the ditch right-of-way.
At 41WY140, four lxl-m test units were
excavated, but only two lithic artifacts were
recovered. Also recovered were fragments of a
tortoise from the top of the Beaumont Formation;

these are discussed above in the geological results.
It is unlikely that in situ archeological remains
occur at this site.
Three previously recovered huinan skeletal
remai..rn were dated by radiocarbon and analyzed
for stable isotopes. The radiocarbon ages of the
human burials suggest that occupation of the area
extends back over 4,400 years, and the occurrence
of burials in the Lower Rio Grande Valley is
older than previously suggested (Prewitt 1981). It
is also clear that much care must be given to the
direct dating of human remains. Dating the
organic fraction of bone produces more reliable
dates than dating the inorganic fraction, and isotopic fractionation corrections for radiocarbon
dates should be calculated for every radiocarbon
date. An additional benefit of correcting radiocarbon dates for fractionation effect is isotopic
dietary information. The very limited stable
isotope analysis of human remains obtained during
this project suggests that distinct coastal and
inland dietary patterns may exist. Nevertheless,
many more isotopic measurements are necessary
before such patterns can be accepted without
justifiable skepticism.
A formal analysis of prehistoric artifact collections from sites recorded along the drainage
ditch was designed in order to test a series of
hypothetical hunter-gatherer mobility and resource
exploitation models.
The individual artifact
assemblages from the five sites investigated during
this project were too small for meaningful analysis, and in order to test the models, a broader
regional approach was considered necessary. The
published artifact data from previous archeological
investigations was used to provide the data base
required to test the models. A limited amount of
reanalysis was wtdertaken to obtain data that
could be used to test the models. Still, artifact
numbers from individual sites were too low for
meaningful statistical analysis, and the sites were
grouped into seven clusters that could be compared to the models.
The models were constructed along three
general land-use patterns. The first assumes that
hunter-gatherer territories extended over the entire
region and access to resources was not limited by
territorial boundaries. The second model assumes
that hunter-gatherer territories focused on the Rio
Grande and extended north into the upland plain,
the lowland plain, and the coast. East-west

139

Prehi•toric Archeology and Paleoenvironments in Hidalgo and Willacy Counties

access, however, was limited. 1lte illird model
assumes Iha! hunter-guillerer territories were
centered on the coast, and that north-south access
was limited by neighboring hunter-gatherer

raw material distributions in the project area and
environmental zone use-intensities. Specifically,
raw material sources are not known to exist east
of the upland plain zone and east of ·La Joya in
the Rio Grande floodplain. Based on llil assessment of environmental zone productivity potential,
the foUowing zone use-intensity rankings are
assumed, in decreasing order: eons ta l zone, Rio
Grande lloodplain, sand sheet, lowland plain, and
upland plain. Although the zones generally are
assumed to be internally homogeneous in resource
potential, it is assumed tliut, within low resourceyield zones, use-intensity may have been higher al
Ille boundaries with higher resource-yield zones.
The test of lhe models was equivocnl.
However, Model I, a no-limited-access e• ploitation pattern, was slightly favored over Model II,
a Rio Grande floodplain cxploitacion pattern and
Model lll, a coastal exploitation pattern. Given
Ille nature of tbe data base, illis unclear patterning
is not surprising. The more important consequence
of Ille analysis stems from how tbe results reflect
on the underlying assumptions of litbic artifact
manufacture, use, and discard used in the model
constructions. This analysis allows for lhe refinement of a number of the simplified assumptions
which underlie the models and permits more
precise modeling and understanding of the organization of lithic technology, resource acquisition
practices, and general land-use patterns employed
by inhabitants of the region. 1lte following alterations arc suggested lo the initial assumptions.
(I) The distributions of early reduction
debitagc, large debitagc, total debitagc, and cores
suggest Iha! lhe general assumption regarding lhe
lack of raw material sources east of the upland
plain zone and east of La Joya may be incorrect.
These attributes suggest that raw material sources
do occur in the extreme eastern portion of tltc sand
sheet. Alternatively, this evidence could indicate
lhe long-distance transport of nonprcpared cores
into Uie eastern sand sheet from sources in the
upland plain zone or perhaps from northwest of
this site cluster.
The frequencies of early reduction
(2)
debilage and manufacture failures appear to
support the initially assumed inverse relationship
between the frequencies of such arcifacts and
distance from source. Because of tltc aberrant
patterning noted in the eastern sand sheet, it is
impossible to establish whether use-intensity

territories.
Twelve lithic artifact categories arc used as
Ille primary data base with which to test the
e>planatory value of lhe lhree models, with
specific model predictions being derived for each
of the twelve analytical categories. Underlying
lhese predictions are a series of assumptions
regarding the relationships between lithic categories and distance from raw material sources and
eovironmental rooe use-intensity. While somewhat distinct predictions are outlined for each of
the models. the differences between the models
derive from the manner in which the territorial
boundaries affect access to raw material sources,
determine Ille mix of high- and low-yield environmental zones within each group's territory, and
condition lhe form and location of litltic raw
material exchange networks. The relationships
underlying the prediccions are:
(I) frequencies of early reduction debitag<;!,
large dehitage, total debitage, manufacture failures, and cores are negatively correlated with
distance from raw material source and enviroomental zooe use-interu;ity;
(2) frequencies of resharpening !lakes and
use-broken tools arc positively correlated with
environmental zooe use-intensity;
(3) discard of exhausted tools occurred at
raw material sources Mille the frequency of
exhausted tools is positively correlated wilh
environmental zone use-intensity;
(4) frequencies of reused tools and !he melUl
number of working edges per uniface arc positively correlated with environmental zone use-intensity and distance from raw material source;
and
(5) frequencies of edge-modified Oakes and
the mean number of utilized edges per flake are
positively correlated with distance from raw
material llild use-intensity; however, the response
to distance from material source is assumed to be
somewhat more gradual in the case of the edgemodified flakes than in the case of formal tools.
These assumed relatioru;hips between lilhic
assemblages, raw material availability, and
environmental zone use-intensity are based on a
number of more general assumptions regarding

140

Chapter 8: Conclusions and Site Assessments

contributed to the relationship in the manner
assumed.
(3) The patterning derived from the large
debitage and total debitage distributions may
indicate a more complex relationship between
these categories and distance from raw material
sources and environmental wne use-intensity. It
appears that, in contexts of low regional raw
material availability, the exportation of large flake
blanks may have reduced the overall frequency of
the large debitage class at raw material procurement sites (e.g., the upland plain). In addition, the
exportation of large flake blanks, coupled with the
possibility that only some manufacture sequences
were completed at the procurement sites, may
have resulted in a lowering of overall debitage
frequencies contrary to the pattern assumed.
(4) While the overrepresentation of core
frequencies at the eastern sand sheet cluster is
aberrant, the overrepresentation of cores in the
central lowland plain cluster, a position halfway
between the two possible raw material sources,
does suggest that perhaps raw materials in the
form of cores were transported to this raw material scarce setting.
(5) The overrepresentation of resharpening
flakes at the sand sheet site clusters indicates a
pattern consistent with the assumption that the
frequency of resharpening flakes is directly related
to wne use-intensity. However, the overrepresentation of this category in two of the three
lowland plain site clusters suggests that the frequency of such artifacts was also conditioned by
a relationship between distance from raw material
source and the nature of the artifacts exported
from raw material rich zones. That is, it appears
that, in areas of low raw material availability, the
proportion of debitage derived from tool resharpening was greater than that derived from the other
stages of artifact reduction. However, the overrepresentation of reshaq>ening flakes at the western and eastern lowland plain site clusters, both of
which are relatively near higher-yield resource
zones, may also support the assumption of
increased use-intensity of low-yield zones located
in ecotonal settings.
(6) The exhausted tool distribution also
shows a pattern more complex than initially
assumed, but it appears that the discard of
exhausted tools tended not to occur at the raw
material source. Rather, exhausted bifaces and

unifaces appear to have been discarded at the
locations where they become too small to function.
On the other hand, the distribution of exhausted
projectile points shows a pattern following that
assumed by the models. That is, exhausted
projectile points were discarded at the source
areas in anticipation of future failure as opposed
to being utilized until actual failure, which could
have occurred in zones with low raw material
availability thus reducing the possibility of immediate replacement.
(7) The overall frequency of use-broken
tools also contradicts the assumed pattemings.
Rather than having a distributional pattern showing
a direct relationship to environmental zone useintensity, use-broken specimens appear to be
almost evenly distributed between low and high
use-intensity wnes. 11lis suggests that the breakage of tools during use was not determined by
environmental zone use-intensity. However, the
analysis of use-broken specimen frequencies by
tool type suggests that, rather than searching for
patterns in overall use-broken tool frequencies, a
more productive approach is the focus on use
breakage rates by tool type. This shift in the
scale or focus of the analysis seems to be well
justified as not all tool types are likely to have
been used with the same intensity in all zones.
(8) In general, the frequency of reused tools
and the mean number of working edges per uniface
support the assumed relationship between distance
and environmental wne use-intensity. However,
the overrepresentation of both categories in the
eastern sand sheet cluster, an area that may have
nearby raw material sources, suggests that the
effect of environmental zone use-intensity may be
a stronger conditioning factor than distance from
raw material source.
(9) The distributional patterns in edgemodified flake frequency and the mean number of
utilized edges per flake show contradictory results
across the different environmental zones. Neither
appears to follow the proposed relationships, and
the overall results suggest that the Wlderlying
assumption that these two categories respond to
similar conditioning factors in ways similar to
formal tools may be incorrect.
These alterations in the original assumptions
affect the hypothesized relationships between lithic
analytical categories, raw material source areas,
and environmental zone use-intensity in some

important ways, and, as a consequence, the
specific predictions derived for each of the models
proposed for the project area need reformulation.
It is hoped that such refinement of the models can
serve as the focus of future investigations in the
region.

the National Register eligibility of the five sites
reported in this volume, as well as for site assessments in future projects. Stated simply, any site
that has the capacity to yield substantive data
allowing testing or refinement of these model<
should be considered to contain important information and thus be eligible for listing on the
National Register of Historic Places.
Before assessing the five sites tested during
tl1is project, five general points about the regional
archeology merit mention. First, there is a notable
dearth of published archeological information from
two of the environmental mnes defined for the
area: U1e Rio Grande floodplain and delta and the
coast. All full evaluation of the models presented
here requires a regional perspective, obtaining
information from sites in these settings is an
important objective for future work in the area.
This issue is especially relevant to the HidalgoWillacy Drainage Ditch because sites in one of
these zones, i.e., the coast, may be affected by the
project, and these sites could contribute significant
information to the regional prehistory.
The second point relates to the problems of
chronology and context. Obviously, little chronological control has been obtained to date on most
of the artifact samples from the Lower Rio
Grande Valley. It is for this reason that the
models proposed in Chapter 3 are temporally
static, and wi!hout better chronological data these
models will never contribute much to understanding diachronic changes in exploitation patterns.
This problem is a function of the low density of
an;heological remains and corresponding scarcity
of tempomlly diagnostic anifacts, the paucity of
datable materials, and the lack of well-stratified
sites. While artifact recovery rates increase with
fine screening, most sites in lhe area have sparse
archeological remains. Tiiese sparse sites are an
integral aspect of the archeological record, but
at this point sites with richer records have the
potential to conlribute more-useful information
than sparse sites, and these richer sites should be
considered quite important. Another facet of this
problem is the difficulty of identifying artifacts
Urnt reliably reflect temporal patterning in the
region. It appears that projectile point size can be
influenced by distance to raw material or intensity
of use. Without good chronological controls on
the an;heological record, regional analysis of
archeological data will be stymied.

SITE A.SSESSMENTS A.ND
RECOMMENDATIONS
A number of criteria are used to assess the
eligibility of cultural resources for listing on the
National Register of Historic Places. Specifically,
eligible resources are those that
possess integrity of location, design,
setting, materials, workmanship, feeling,
and association, aruI
A. that are associated with events that
have made a significant contribution to
the broad patterns of our history; or

B. that are associated with the lives of
persons significant in our past; or
C. that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or represent the works of
a master, or possess high artistic
values, or represent a significant and
distinguishable entity whose components
may lack individual distinction; or

D. that have yielded or may be likely
to yield infonnation important in prehistory or history. [U.S. Department of
the Interior, National Park Service,
National Register Division I982:1].
Clearly, the criteria of integrity and ability to
yield important information (Criterion D) are most
relevant to the archeological sites tested in this
project.
The theoretical models of hunter-gatherer
exploitation patterns, mobility, and territorial
divisions described in Chapter 3 provide a starting
point for identifying how individual sites in the
Lower Rio Grande Valley can contribute important
information concerning the prehistory of the region.
Hence, these models offer a basis for assessing

142

Chapter 8: Conclusions and Site Assessments

Third, the radiocarbon dating program of this
project can be used to suggest a number of procedures that would result in better chronologies in
the future. All radiocarbon ages should be corrected for the fractionation effect of stable carbon
isotopes, even for charcoal samples. 1bis can
significantly change radiocarbon ages, and it is
only corrected radiocarbon ages that can be used
in the high resolution tree-ring calibration curves.
Fractionation correction is especially important if
soils or bones are used. Additionally, if bones are
used for radiocarbon dating, the organic or gelatin
fraction should be dated whenever possible. 'The
inorganic or apatite fraction often produces unreliable radiocarbon ages. Additionally, !he stable
isotope values can provide paleoenvironmental and
paleodietary information.
Fourth, in the future a bioarchcological
analysis of cemeteries and burials, especially if
supplemented by stable-isotope analysis and
direct radiocarbon dates, can provide data within
a chronological framework that is directly pertinent to hunter-gatherer economic adaptations,
mobility, and social organization in the Lower Rio
Grande Valley. Such archeological data can add
"flesh to the bones" of etfmohistory, and provide
independent evidence of the adequacy of the
historic record. A regional approach to this
problem will provide the most useful spatial and
temporal patterning.
Fifth, because of their geomorphic contexts,
most sites in the area contain limited or dubious
paleoenvironmental data. When obtained from
good contexts, such data are especially important
in efforts to relate the behavior of past cultural
groups to resource exploitation and mobility
patterns. Should sites containing such data be
identified, they should be accorded special attention. Possible settings for sites with this kind of
data include clay dunes on the coast and inland
eolian deposits in the South Texas sand sheet or
around inland lakes or playas, such as La Sal
Vieja. Lacking well-stratified sites containing
pollen, phytoliths, and fauna, however, alternate
dependable data sources need to be sought. The
paleoenvironmental studies undertaken during this
project, involving analyses of dated stable isotopes, are an attempt to find such sources and
have provided some tantalizilng clues about
environmental changes in the region.
As a group, the five sites tested during this

project-41HG128, 41WY112, 41WY113,
41WY134, and 41WY140-suffer from a number
of shortcomings that have been identified at other
sites tested previously along the Hidalgo-Willacy
Drainage Ditch. All have very sparse cultural
remains, with the largest artifact sample consisting
of microdebitage recovered from the fine screen at
41HG128. Only small quantities of faunal and
macrobotanical remains were recovered at
41HG128. With such small samples, it is doubtful
that any of the sites is capable of yielding sufficient artifactual, ecofactual, or feature data to
permit meaningful analysis. Substantive interpretation is also precluded by the inability to define
reasonably discrete, datable components or periods
of use, as all five sites lack well-stratified contexts. Further, the integrity of the cultural remains
at all five sites is compromised to some extent by
historic land-use practices. In short, while these
five sites have proven useful in assessing the
utility of the hunter-gatherer settlement models
proposed here, they do not have the potential to
significantly contribute to further testing or refineThus, 41HG128,
ment of these models.
41WYI12, 41WY113, 41WY134, and 41WY140
are judged to be ineligible for listing on the
National Register of Historic Places.
Two final recommendations are offered here.
First, at some point it will be crucial to search for
the presumed raw material source in the South
Texas sand sheet. Its existence is strongly implicated by the data, but until this source is documented, the analysis of prehistoric archeological
assemblages will be hampered. This particular
objective may be particularly difficult because of
land access problems. Nevertheless, the discovery
and characterization of this raw material source, if
it does in fact exist, would greatly facilitate the
understanding of prehistoric adaptations in the
Lower Rio Grande Valley.
Second, there are two coastal clay dune sites,
4IWY50 and 4IWY60, that were tested during an
earlier phase of this project and Iha! have the
potential to contribute important information (Day
et al. 1981). These sites appear to have good
stratigraphic and archeological context, as well as
reasonable organic preservation. Sites with such
superior organic and contextual preservation
warrant stratigraphic excavation, and the materials
recovered should be analyzed with many of the
techniques suggested in !he 1988 work plan as
143

Prehistoric Archeology and Paleoenvir01mie/l/s in Hidalgo and Willacy Counties

well as the new techniques exployed in the investigations reported here. As discussed in the 1988
work plan, such sites may require large areal
excavations because it is doubtful that high artifact
densities will be found at any sites in the region,
except possibly along the Rio Grande or near raw

144

material sources. But the increased stratigraphic
control at these sites should allow good spatial
integration of numerous, low-density occupations,
and these are the types of sites needed' to make
significant contributions to understanding the
archeological record of the region.

INTRODUCfION
111is appendix describes the materials
recovered during Phase II investigatinns at
41HG128, 41WY112, 41WY 113, 41WY134, and
41WY140. The cultural materials are discussed
first, of which Jithic artifacts represent the major
type recovered from these sites followed by
modified bone. Also included is a discussion of
a ceramic sherd recovered in 1986 from 41HG128.
The nonartifactnal materials are described next
and consist of burned clay lumps, charcoal,
mollusks (i.e., marine shell, freshwater mussel
shells, and land snails), bones, and miscellaneous
materials. The miscellaneous materials may result
from de]Jositional, postdepositional, and/or
pedogenic JJroCesses rather than prehistoric human
activities at these sites.
UTHIC ARTIFACTS

A total of 157 chipped stone artifacts was
recovered fromfoor sites-41HG128, 41WY112,
41WY113, and 41WY140. None were recovered
at 41WY134. Unmodified debitage makes up the
largest category (93%), followed by hafted bifaces
(3%), nonhafted bifaces (2%), biface fragments
(!%), one edge-modified flake (0.5%), and a
single ICSted cobble (0.5%). Each specimen is
described individually except the unmodified
debitage which is characterized by flake type,
cortex category, platform type, material type, nnd

size.
Hafted Bifaces
Four hafted bifaces were recovered and all
are considered to be projectile JJOints. Two of
these share the beveled-edge trait considered
diagnostic of Olmos bifaces (Hester 1969:29-30,
Shafer and Hester 1971). According to Shafer and
Hester (1971), these bifacial artifacts were hafted
with the beveled edge as the distal end, and
fwictioned as gouges or scra]Jers based on
microwear found on this edge. The bifaces
discussed here, however, lack use wear along any
portion of their beveled edges, and lack hafting
wear along the Intern! edges and/or dorsal or
ventral surface of their pointed ends; thus all four
specimens are considered to be projectile points.
The first specimen (Fig. 51 a), recovered from
the surface at 4 lHGI 28, is similar to Groop 3

167

Olmos bifaccs described by Shafer and Hester
(1971:4-5). It is a mottled cream and tnn chert
complete triangular biface measuring 27 mm in
length, 21 mm in base width. an.<! 7 mm in
thickness.
The base is beveled by three
longitudinally directed tl1inning flakes which
terminate in hinge fractures, and some reworking
of the two comers of the base is evident. The two
lateral edges are beveled on the face op]Josite the
basal bevel. Viewed along its longitudinal axis,
the point is asymmetrically leaning away from the
margin with the steepest bevel. The beveled edges
and longitudinal asymmetry suggest that the
specimen has undergone several rejuvenation and
resharpenh1g episodes. The edge beveling appears
to represent the last sequence of flake removals,
while the longitudinal asymmetry represents an
expedient reworking technique, the goal of which
is to generate a new ti]J by reworking only one
edge rather than realigning both lateral edges of a
proximal bifacc fragment. The specimen a]Jpears
to represent the re working of a biface proximal
fragment.
The second specimen (see Fig. 5lb), from
Level 4 of Test Unit 9 at 41HG128, also
resembles an Olmos biface (Hester 1969, Shafer
and Hester 1971). It is a mottled cream nnd tan
chert complete triangular biface measuring 18 mm
in length, 13 mm in base width, and 3 mm in
thickness. It retains a portion of its original
ventral flake surface.
The blade exhibits
alternately beveled edges with one edge having a
considerably stee]Jer bevel than the other. The
base is beveled on the face Op)Josite the steepest
beveled edge and ti1e comer of the base adjacent
lD the steep beveled edge has also been reworked.
The point is longitudinally asymmetrical, leaning
away from the edge with the steeJJ bevel. The
edge bevel and longitudinal asymmetry again
suggest the reworking of a biface ]Jroximal
fragment witl1 the same technique as noted for the
first specimen. This point has probably undergone
several stages of resharpening and appears to be
exhausted.
The third specimen, from the surface at
4IWY112, is an unty)JCd trinngnlar projectile point
(see Fig. 5Ic). It is complete and measures
26 mm in length, 19 mm in base width, and 7 mm
in thickness. rt is made from reddish brown chert
with small red inclusions and a high luster
indicating heat trea!ment. The point has steep

lateral edges that are alternately beveled and a
straight, bifaeially thinned base. As in the case of
the other two points, this specimen is
longitudinally asymmetrical.
The asymmetry
results primarily from the steep bevel on one of
the lateral edges. This bevel, together with the
removal of flakes from the opposite edge of the
same face, represent U1e last sequence of flake
removals. TI1e point represents U1e reworking of
a proximal fragment in a fashion similar to that of
the specimens dcsc1ibcd above.
The fourth specimen, from the surface at
41WY!l3, is a complete projectile point (Fig.
51d). It measures 36 mm in length, 21 mm in
base width. and 7 mm in thickness and is made

from grayish brown and black chert with small
white inclusions. It has a uniformly distributed
luster diagnostic of heat treatment. The lateral
edges show small rejuvenation flake scars
perpendicular to the long axis of the blade while
large flake scars occur on the interior of both sides
and nearer the base. Several hinge fractures are
present along one edge and represent attempts at
removing a small knot. TI1e base is rounded but
scarred by an internal fracture. Because the
projectile point shows evidence of resharpening, it
was probably discarded during rejuvenation and/or
resharpening. The internal fracture in U1c material
and the unsuccessful attempt to remove a small
knot probably led to its discard.

Appendix A: Materials Rec(Jllered

Nonhafted Bifaces

The lateral edges are slightly convex and flake
scars run perpendicular to the long axis of the
blade. Pressure flake scars measuring 3-5 mm, in
combination with bifacial polish along the edges,
indicate resharpening following a cutting use. The
two fracture morphologies derive from use in a
prying task or as a projectile pomt.
The distal fragment measures 26 mm in
length, 15 mm in width, and 6 mm in thickness
and exhibits steel' alternately beveled edges (see
Fig. 5li). It is made from a cream chert with red
inclusions and gray mottles. Based on break
morphology, the specimen is classified as a usebroken tool. The alternate beveling suggesls that
the tool functioned as a knife (Sollberger 1971),
possibly in addition to serving as a projectile

specimens show evidence of use, although one
may have been functional while the other two
appear to be manufacturing failures or rejects.
The first specimen, from Level 4 of Test
Unit 7 at 4!HGl2B, is a proximal fragment
measuring 18 mm in length, 27 mm in width, and
8 mm in thickness (see Fig. 5 le). It is made from
yellowish brown qmirtzite and has slightly
expanded lateral edges and a convex base. Both
sides exhibit hinge scars indicating difficulty in
reducing this material. The break morphology
suggesls !hat the specimen was broken during
manufaclure.
The second specimen, from the surface at
41WYI12, is a complete bi face measuring 28 mm
in length, 21 mm in width, and 9 mm in thickness
and is oval Jn shape (see Fig. 5 li). It is made
from poor quality yellow and black chert with
quartz crystal inclusions.
Although the poor
quality of material appears to have caused several
hinged flake removals, the specimen may have
been functional.
The third specimen, from !he surface at
41WYl13, is a complete biface measnring 34 mm
in length, 21 mm in width, and 9 mm in thickness
(see Fig. Sig). It fa made from light and medium
gray chcrt with white inclusions. The distal end of
the biface shows evidence of heat treatment in the
form of crazing, luster, and reddening of the white
inclusions. The biface exhibits several hinged
flake removal scars resulting from unsuccessful
attempts to remove a large knot. The knot,
combined with the parent-flake ventral surface
remnant evident on one face, suggest that the
bifaee is a mmmfacture reject.

point.
Edge-modified Fluke
'This catagory consists of one specimen
recovered from the surface at 41WYl12 (see Fig.
5 lj). It is a decorticate chip measuring 22 mm in
length, 21 mm in width, and 3 mm in thickness.
It is a pinkish tan chert with small red and while
inclusions. The dorsal face of the specimen
exhibits use-related microflake scaring on two
edges, both of which appear to have been used in
scraping tasks. l11e fragmentary modified edges
arc 18 and 11 mm in length.

Tested Cobble
One possibly tested cobble was recovered
from the surface at 41HG128. It is made of
reddish brown chert with white inclusions and
retains lhree rather clustered flake scars on one
end. The specimen measures 56 mm in length,
42 mm in widlh, and 39 mm in thickness.
Becanse of the lack of clearly definable platform
surfaces and negative bulbs of percussion and
because the specimen was recovered near the
access road, it is possible that the flake scars are
the result of heavy machinery damage rather than
prehistoric modification.

Miscellaneous Bifnce Fragments
One medial and one distal biface fragment
were recovered from the surface at 41HG!28.
The medial fragment measures 34 mm in length,
25 mm in width, and 7 mm in thickness (see Fig.
51h) and is made from translucent white
chalcedony witl1 tan and gray inclusions and bands.

Unmodified Debitage
A total of 146 pieces of unmodified lithlc
debitage was recovered during the Phase II investigations. Table 23 shows the debitage recovered

from each site in tenns of four attributes, the first
of which divides die specimens into the categories
of flakes and chips. Flakes are defined as
specimens dial have a striking platform and that
may or may not be complete. 01ips are defined
as specimens that lack a slrilting platform. Cortex
category, raw material, and size attributes were
recorded for both flakes and chips. The cortex
category consists of specimens with cortex on the
entire dorsal surface (i.e., primary), specimens

with cortex on some but not all of the dorsal
smfacc (i.e., secondary), and specimens with no
cortex (i.e., tertiary). Platfonn type consists of
cortex, single-fa::et, and lllJlliple-facet categories.
The raw material type consists of chert, quartzite,
chalcedony, and silicified wood. Size is defined

by maximum dimension and is divided into five
groups, 1-10 mm, 11-20 mm. 21-30 mm, 31--40
mm, and 41+ mm. The methodology used for this
analysis is derived in part from more-detailed

170

Appendix A: Materials Recovered

analyses of unmodified debitagc (Tamica et al.
1988; Tomka et al. 1989; Tomka and fields
1990).
It was also designed to maintain
comparability with previous analyses from U1e
region (Mallouf et al. 1977; Day et al. 1981; Ha!l
et al. 1987).
The breakdown of U1e collections by flake
type reveals that the ratios of flakes to ctrips are
roughly lhe same. Initially tlris parity may be
surprising as chips greally outnumber complete
flakes in most collections. Two factors account
for this pattcm The definition of a flake used in
Uris analysis combines both complete specimens
and proximal fragments.
Such a definition
automatically deflates the number of chips. On
the other hand, a majority of the flakes in the
collection appear to be late reduction rejuvenation
and/or resharpening flakes removed by pressure
flaking. The use of the pressure-flaking technique
tends to increru;e tl1e frequency of complete flakes
(Tomka and Fields 1990) contributing to some of
the parity noted above.
The most striking observation regarding
cortex category is the absence of primary flakes
and chips. Most of the debitage consists of
tertiary flakes and chips. Although sample sizes
are small, evidence of early reduction stages is
absent in the collections recovered from lhe sites.
Instead, the collections represent the late stages of
tool manufacture as well as tool rejuvenation and
resharpening.
The analysis of platform type indicates that
the percentages of single- and multi- faceted
flakes are evenly distributed at 41HG128 and
41WYJJ2. It is likely tliat these f1akes derive
from tlie rejuvenation and/or resharpening of
unifacial and bifacial artifact~ (see Chapter 7).
The frequencies suggest a similarity in the
intensity of resharpening and, by implication, of
use of unifaces and bifaces at the two sires.
Platform attributes, in combination with
overall flake morphology, reflect the predominance
of tool resharpening. Using the criteria discussed
in Chapter 7, 93 (64%) of 146 debitage specimens
were classified as uniface and/or biface
resharpening flakes. Of the 93 specimens, 66
(71 %) have striking platforms which exhibit usepolish, rounding, and microstep fracurring
immediately dorsal to lhe platform facet. The
remaining portion consislS of chips (n = 27, 29%)
that retain sufficient mmphological characteristics
(i.e., longitudinal curvature, perpendicular dorsal
ridge, usec-polish, and/or use-generated microstep

171

fracture scars near the former striking platform) to
classify them as derived from tool resharpening.
The most abundant material type observed is
chert, followed in decreasing frequency by
chalcedony, quartzite, and silicified wood. These
malerials are typical of those found along the Rio
Grande and, to a lesser extent, lhe uplands
(Mallouf et al. 1977; Day et al. 1981; Hall et al.
1987).
Although sample sizes are small, analysis by
size category shows a higher percentage of small
size debitagc at 41HG128 and 41WYl12, which
suggests that the primary activity at tliese sites
was !ale-stage reduction, rejuvenation, and
resharpening of tools.
The debitage from
41WY112 reveals tlrnt 86% of the specimens are
evenly distributed between two size groups (1-10
mm and 11-20 mm) while 87% of debitagc from
41HG128 falls into U1e 0-10 mm size (43% of
those were recovered from lhe fine-screen matrix
from Level 5 of Test Unit 5). Tiie debitage
colleclions from 41WYll3 and 41\\'Yl40 are too
small to make any reliable comparisons.
Of the 146 debitage specimens, 112 (77%)
were recovered from the fine screens; had lhe
fme-screening technique not been used, only 23%
(n = 34) of the specimens would have been
recovered (Table 24). In areas of lithlc raw
malerial scarcity, most of the debitage generated
at archeological sites will be of small size. The
distance from raw material sources, coupled with
intensive use and potential reuse of lithic artifacts
contdbute to reduce lhe overall artifact sizes. It is
paramount Uiat future archeological work in tl1e
project area employ intensive data recovery
techniques such as fine screening. The recovery of
the smallest size class debitage potentially can
contribute to an understanding of the degree of raw
material stress in the project area, as well as a
more complete understanding of lithic procurement
practices and the organization of teelmology
(Binford 1979).
In summary, the extremely sparse lithics
recovered from 41WY113 and 41WYl40 do not
allow for meaningful interpretations. Tiiose from
41HG128 and 41WY112, however, exhibit a high
p=ntage of tertiary chips, flakes with single and
multiple facets, and small size debitage. This
suggests that lithic reduction activities al these
sites focused on late-stage preforms and/or the
rejuvenation and resharpening of finished and worn
tools. The sparseness of the artifacts rnay suggest
tliat these sites were only briefly occupied by

Appendix A: Materials Recovered

the convex surface is fire-blackened suggesting an
exterior surface. The interior surface is a creamy
buff color which results from oxidation during the
firing process and underlies a well-polished or
burnished slip of yellowish red (5YR 5/8). The
paste is well-compacted fine clay with naturally
occurring quartz sand inclusions. The sherd is
well made and does not resemble prehistoric
ceramics from the Texas coast such as Rockport
wares, yet it is similar to sherds collected in the
Rio Grande Delta area by A. E. Anderson. The
specimen from 41HG128 is very similar to an olla
described as Huastecan-like from La Loma
Atravasada in northeastern Tamaulipas, Mexico
with regard lo thickness, surface treatment, paste,
and color (Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory n.d.}.
A. E. Anderson describes five types in his
collection of Rio Grande Delta ceramics; one of
these is described as buff colored, thin,
undecorated, and fire-blackened (Anderson
1932:30). Mason ( 1935) made a study of the
ceramics from Anderson's collection, comparing
these specimens with Huastecan ceramics and
Huastecan-influenced ceramics from San
Fernando, Mexico.
He concludes that the
ceramics from Brownsville sites (e.g., Anderson's
collection) are possibly of Huastecan influence,
"As a result of our comparisons we may probably
conclude with reasonable confidence that the
Brownsville vessels were not made by Huaxtecs
[sic] . . . but show Huaxtec influence to a
moderate degree" (Mason 1935:40). The ceramics
from the Brownsville area and Huastecan area are
not as similar in shape as they are in other
attributes such as color, hardness, wall thickness,
materials used in decoration (asphaltum and red
ocher}, and decorative motif. Parallel straight
lines and bands, scallops, triangles, concentric
circles with central dot, and animal figures are
found on ancient Huaxtec and Brownsville vessels
(Mason 1935:37-40).
The sherd from 41HG128 is neither decorated
nor large enough to determine the shape of the
vessel, and the surface context in which it was
found does not provide conclusive evidence that it
was associated with prehistoric activities. The
fact that a possible historic earthenware sherd also
was observed but not collected at the site during
the 1986 survey adds to the uncertainty as to
whether or not the specimen predates the contact

highly mobile groups, although the low frequencies
of debitage may also be due lo overall low
numbers of lithic tools in highly curated tool
assemblages.
MODIFIED BONE
A single modified bone was recovered from
Feature l at 41WY113. This specimen consists of
a small fragment which has been bifacially ground
on both ends (Fig. 52) and may be part of a
compound fishhook similar to those recovered
from other coastal sites (Story 1968:Fig. 48 E, F,
and K).

CERAMIC SHERD FROM 41HG128
During the Phase I investigations, a single
prehistoric ceramic sherd was recovered from
41HG 128 (Hall et al. 1987). This specimen was
described as "one plain aboriginal sherd" (Hall et
al. 1987:99) but was not described in detail.
Before 1986, only three sites with prehistoric
pottery were known--41 WY9 (Mallouf ct al.
1977:189), 41WY60 (Day et al. 1981:335),
41WY72 (Day 1981:47). The sherd from 41WY9
is described as a fine sandy paste sherd with a
brown slip on both surfaces, and the sherds from
41WY60 and 41WY72 are described as sandy
paste wares.
The sherd recovered from 4lHG128 is a
small, thin fragment measuring 23xl8 mm in size
and 4.5 mm in thickness. Vessel forms found in
the Lower Rio Grande Valley (Mason 1935) can
produce small sherds with varying interior/exterior
curvatures (i.e., body, shoulder, or neck
fragments); this specimen is slightly curved and

of undisturbed context that predate historic land
modification in the region were identified
presuming that clay lumps in tl1ese contexts arJ
not historic. Specimens collected from surfaCe:
contexts are considered to be possibly related to
prehistoric activites since these specimens are not
in direct association with anifacts. For purposes
of this analysis, clay lump specimens nre
identified as burned if they exhibit hairline cracks,
angular or sharp edges typically observed on firccracked rocks, discoloration (i.e., reddened or
blackened surfaces resulting from oxidation during
firing), and a maximum diameter equal to or
greater U1an 20 mm (based on Uie obsctvation that
calcium carbonate and manganese nodules present
in the same deposits are usually smaller than or
equal to 20 mm in maximum diameter).
Specimens smaller 01an 20 mm arc usually very
friable and are a likely product of dingensis.

Site 41HG128

Unit 2 revealed four burned clay lumps in
undisturbed context but not directly associated
with rutifacts; however, four pieces of fine-screen
debitage were recovered from Levels 9 and JO.
Level 5 of Test Unit 5 yielded one piece of
burned clay which is possibly associated with the
fine-screen debitage from this level (see Chapter
5). Levels 2-6 of Test Unit 6 revealed 39 burned
clay lumps associated wid1 7 pieces of fine-screen
debitage and 2 pieces of 1/4-inch-screcn dcbitagc
(see Oiapter 5). In addition, fine-screen and 1/4inch-screcn debitage was also recovered from

BURNED Cl,AY LUMPS

Burned clay lumps arc difficult to identify as
a direct or indirect result of human activity even
when the specimens are in good context Those
identified as potentially associated with rnehistoric
human activities are shown on Table 24. When
clay lumps arc not associated wiU1 artifacts but
are within the site area, they should be viewed
only as possible prehistoric cullural materials
(Mallouf el al. 1977:100; Day ct al. 1981:347).
Burned clay lumps occur quite commonly in
tbc project area as a result of recent land clearing
and bmsh burning practices as well as from
natural processes such as grass fires over clayey
surfaces or diagenesis (sec below). 111e burned
clay lumps can be quite han:I or very friable
depending on the degree of burning. A lowtemperature firing resulting from a surface fffe can
create small burned clay lumps Uial may not
exhibit the common characteristics of burning (i.e.,
discoloration and cracking). Through time natural
processes also tend to fragment burned clay
lumps. Ethnographic evidence from South Texas
(Campbell 1988:36-37) indicates that pit ovcos
were used to process plant foods. This could
create burned clay lumps but at present no pit
ovens have been identified.
The magnetometer studies at 41WY112 and
41WYl 13 showed that burned clay lumps did not
produce measurable signals during the controlled
experiments (see Appendix B). Frederick and
Abbott point out that there are at least three
possible causes of clay lumps of this kind: (!)the
specimens may have been fired at low
temperatures which are insufficient lo produce
thennoremancot magnetic signals; (2) the magnetic
mineral content of the clay may be insufficient for
measurement: or (3) the specimens may be unfired
products of diagen.~is. fu this case, diagensis is a
process resulting in the ccmcotation of individual
particles that are bonded together by calcium
carbonate. Most of the clay lumps react to a I 0%
solution of hydrochloric acid showing Ornt calcium
carbonate is present.

Levels 7-9. As the profile of Test Unit 6 shows
(see Oiapter 5), Level 2 is partially disturbed and
the burned clay specimens and artifacts could have
come from either disturbed or undislnrbed
sediments. Level 5 of Test Unit 7 revealed one
burned clay specimen associated with five pieces
of fine-screen debitage. Fine-screen debitage and
one biface also were recovered from Level 4 and
one piece of 1/4--inch-screen debitage was
recovered from Level 6. Levels 5-7 of Test Unit
8 yielded 11 burned clay lumps associated with l
piece of fine-screen debitage.
Site 41WY112 contains at least four
proveniences where burned clay lumps occur in
undisturbed contexts and might represent direct or
indirect results of prehistoric cullnral activities.
Five burned clay specimens recovered from Levels
5 and 6 of Test Unit l are associated with two
pieces of debitage. Levels 7-10 of Test Unit 8
revealed a substantial number of bumed clay
lumps (N = 22) associated with one piece of
debitagc in Level 9. One burned clay lump
recovered from Level 8 of Test Unit 10 is well
below recently disturbed deposits but is not
associated with artifacts. Levels 5 and 6 of Test
Unit II revealed two burned clay lumps
associated with two pieces of debitage. At
41WY!l3, all the burned clay specimens were
recovered from historically disturbed deposils,
hence no determination of origin can be made.
No bwned clay specimens occurred in
contexts indicative of in situ hearths; however,
some might represent displaced hearth stones,
boiling stones, or the result of indirect firing of the
clayey deposits from surface or pit fires.
Although the burned clay specimens and associated artifact frequencies are low, they tend to
support the general scenario of limited human
activity and high mobility (see Chapter 3).

MOLLUSCA
Seven freshwater mussel shell fr~gments and
one couch shell fragment were recovered from the
Phase II excavations (see Table 24), Most of
these specimens were recovered from surface
contexts. Surface finds of freshwater mussel
shells are not a reliable indicator of prehistoric
human activity as mussels inhabit the drainage
bottoms today. The occurrence of mussel shell
fragments on the surface along the drainage may
result from dredging the bottoms where mussels
live or from modem collections by animals or
humans.
Three mussel shell fragments were recovered
from Levels 1, 3, and 7 of Test Unit 1
excavations at 41WYII3. The specimen from
Level 3 is in association with one piece of finescreen debitage and is possibly related to
prehistoric human activities, AU specimens are
small, heavily weathered fr.igments which exhibit
no evidence of human modification.
'The surface collections consist of four
specimens. A single conch shell fragment was
recovered from the surface at 41WY112 at the top
of the drainage bank. This specimen is a small,
heavily weathered columella fragment which is
culturally unmodified. One mussel shell from the
surface of Test Unit 5 at 4lHG128 is considered
modem as it retains portions of the outer
periostracum,
The remaining two specimens
recovered from surface contexts at 41WY112. and
41WYl34 are small weathered fragments which
do not exhibit signs of human modification. There
is no direct evidence that any of these surfacecollected specimens are the result of prehistoric
human activities, although Ille conch shell must
have been transported from the coast and it is
possible that this was done by hunter-gatherers
prehistorically.
The presence of land snails in archeological
sites is usually attributed to natutal rather than
cultural processes; there have been no concentrations observed in the project area that could be the
result of prehistoric human activity, Land snails
occur in dense numbers in many locations along
the drainage ditch (Halt et al. 1987:53). As no
archeological or ethnohistorical data demonstrates
that snails were a source of food for prehistoric
people iu the project area, perhaps a more viable
use of gastropod studies is for environmental

exception of those associated with historic
features, the majority of charcoal specimens weigh
less than l g and consist of small fragments of
unidentified wood.

reconstruction. Adequate and reliable stratigraphic
contexts, however, were lacking at the five
investigated sites; therefore, this type of
paleoenvironmental analysis was not pursued, lo
the future, gastropods excavated from sites with
better stratigraphic contexts shonld be considered
for paleoenvironmeatal analysis.
Site 41HGl28 yielded 176 g of snail shells,
41WY112 yielded 2655 g, 41WYI 13 yielded 419
g, 41WY134 yielded 882 g, and 41WYl40
yielded 2 g. The Rabdotus sp. is by far the most
abundant gastropod species observed in the
collections. This species is tolerant of a wide
variety of environmental conditions and does not
provide specific hubitat data for the sites in the
project area. RabdOlus prefers a habitat of earlyto mid-successional brush in slightly higher
elevations thuo the investigated sites and avoids
direct water. l11ey are a brush and tree snail often
found clinging to branches, but they lay eggs in
soil. Concentrations of whole shells and fragments
can result from rain washing, from wood rats
eating the snail and discarding the shell, or from
road runners collecting and smashing the shells to
get to the snail meat.

Geological Trench 1.22 m below surface:
Only 9.7 g and 4.7 g of bone were recovered
from 41HG128 and 41WY134, respectively. At
4IHG128, a single rnbbit-sfaed unfused distal
femoral condyle was recovered from Level 4 of
Test Unit 8. No bone was recovered from
excavations al 41WY140: however, fragments of
a tortoise shell were collected from sediments
adjacent to Backhoe Trench 1 and this was submitted for radiocarbon dating (see Appendix D).
MISCELLANEOUS MATERIALS
Calcium carbonate and manganese oxide
concretions were noted during !he Phase II
investigations. These mineral concretions are
believed to be formed by individual particles of
the minerals being bonded together by materials
(in this case calcite) precipitated from ground
water. These concretions result from pedogenic
processes in the sediments.
A small amount of gypsum was recovered
from the excavations and is known to occur in !he
deposit• throughout !he pmject area, Gypsum is
a mineral formed by the evaporation of saline
water, usually sea water, in a warm) dry
environment, The gypsum specimeos from these
excavations are usually small, averaging less than
10 mm in maximum diameter and under I g in
weight.
Siliceous pebbles were noted in the test ur1it
excavations and are probably attributable to lateral
fluvial processes contributing to the original
formation of the delta. The presence of tl1ese
specimeos are the result of geomorphic ralhcr than
cultural processes at the sites.
Modem debris was collected from the test
unit excavations to deoote the presence of possibly
disturbed deposits and/or bioturbatioo processes
which could have displaced these materials. Table
24 shows the presence or absence of these
materials which include metal fragments, plastic,
glass, cigarette filters, a 22-caliber bullet, plastic
gun shell casings, modem ceramic fragments, and
petroleum residue.

DONES
Little fa1D1al material was recovered at any of
!he five excavated sites and most were
unidentifiable fragments of bone (see Table 24).
The greatest amount (168.7 g) was recovered from
41WY113, lUld this was due to the recovery of
Feature I. Feature I consisted of one complete
left deer radius, one left deer proximal radius
shaft, and one right deer metacaipal, as well as
!he one bone artifact discussed above. A deer
radius from 41WY113 was submitted for
radiocarbon dating (see Appendix D).
At4lWYll2, a total of25.2g of bone was
recovered from the excavations, and five
specimens were identifiable. Recovered were one
large mammal, tootn fragment (deer size) from
Level 7 of Test Unit 6, one distal deer phalange
from Level 8 of Test Unit 6, one possible deer

phase and the signal fades (Breiner 1973;
Stcpooaitis and Brain 1976).
The proton magnetometer measures U.e overall field strength of the magnetic field at a given
point in time aud space. The total field strength
is a composite of the earth's field strength and local
pennutations caused by induced and remauent
magnetization of nearby objects. Induced, or
viscous, magnetization refers to !be interaction of
a material with the ambient magnetic field where
the presence of the field acts to magnetize U.e
object that in tum, influences the configuration of
the field. Remauent magnetism refers to the
permanent magnetic alignment of material independent of the magnetic field. Of these two types of

This report presents the results of two
magnetic surveys undertaken during the testing
phase of archeological investigations at two sites
in Willacy County, Texas. These sites were
selected for a pilot study designed to evaluate the
utility of magnecomelry in locating subsurface
burned features within the confines of the site
boundaries. The results of the two site surveys,
together with infonnation gathered on the magnetic
susceptibility of some U.crmally altered objects
procured from one of the sites, provide information
useful for future magnetic prospection in this area.
THEORETICAL BACKGROUND

The following sectioo provides a brief introduction to the physics of magnetomelry aud its
application to archeology. For more thorough
reviews, see Breiner (1973). Aitken (1974), and
Weymouth and Huggins (1985). The eartll is
enveloped by a magnetic field similarinconfiguration to one surrounding a simple bar magnet. This
field is composed of lines of magnetic force or flux
that issue from the eartll's magnetic poles. The
intensity of the magnetic field at any locatioo is a
function of the density of the lines of flux aud
varies from approximately 25,000 gammas (a
symbol of magnetic incensity that hereafter is represented by the symbol y) in the lrnpical latitudes
to over 70,000 y at lhe magnetic poles.
Proton magnetometers are portable instruments that provide a measure of the total magnetic
field intensity at a given location independent of
field orientation. 'The sensor consists of a wire coil
surrounding a bottle of fluid rich in hydrogen ions,
snch as water, kerosene, or decaue. The nuclei of
the hydrogen ions behave as small, spinning
magnetic dipoles and precess about au axis parallel
to the magnetic field of the eartll at a rate directly
proportional to its intensity. Under normal conditions, the precession of individual protons in the
fluid is out of phase, aud no current is produced in
the coil. However, when a s1rnng current is passed
through lhe coil, a magnetic field is generated
which temporarily polarizes the protons. After the
current is eliminated, lhe protons resUille precession
in phase aud generate a minute voltage signal in the
coil. 11iis signal is directly proportional to the
total magnetic field intensity and is largely inde-

magnetization, remanent is the more important

archeologically (Breiner 1973; Aitken 1974;
Weymonth aud Huggins 1985).
The most significant form of remanent magnetism for archeological purposes results from
heating aud is termed lhermoremanent magnetism.
Under normal oooditioos, the electron orbits of
magnetic mincrnls oootained within a substance are
locked into randomly oriented alignments. However, when materials oootaining magnetic minerals
arc heated above lhe curie point (ca. 600° CJ, Uie
electroos of the magnetic particles are thermally
agitated aud begin to rotate freely. As the material
cools, the electron orbits tend to align wiU. the
earth's magnetic field and, with further cooling, are
locked in place. Heating to temperatures below the
curie point usually results in partial thermoremauent magnetization, resulting in a less
pronounced but often still detectable overall
magrietization of lhe material.
Thermoremauent magnetism allows U.e
determination of the azimuU. aud inclination of the
magnetic pole at the time that the materinl cooled
and the orbits were frozen aud tlrus provides the
basis of paleomagnetic aud archeomagnetic datirg
(Bradley 1985:86-98; Eighmy 1980). In addition,
tills uniform alignment also tends to give the
material strong magnetic properties that cau
produce dramatic signatmes in archeological
applications (Breiner and Coe 1972; WeymouU.
1979; Weymouth aud Huggins 1985).
Archeological magnetic surveys are designed
to detect spatial anomalies due to localized
phenomena (e.g., burned archeological features).

However, because all readings callllol he taken
simullaneously, the survey data also contains a
temporal component that must be eliminated. The
earlb's magnetic field varies both on a fairly
predictable daily basis (i.e., diurnal variations of
up to several hundred y a day) and ou a random
short-term basis (i.e., micropulsations of 10-100 y
al unpredictable intc1vals). In practice, one of two
methods is typically used lo control for lbe effect'
of these variations: eilher control readings are
taken periodically al a given reference point (e.g.,
Gibson 1986; Hamilton 1986), or a second magnetometer is typically employed as a stationary
recording base station (e.g., Weymoulb 1979, 1987;
Espey, Huston and Associates, Inc. 1988). During
processing, lbcse base data are used to correct for
the effect of diurnal drift on lbe field data.
Magnetic anomalies take U1e form of an
individual or group of monopole or dipole sources.
Monopoles are formed where the lines of flux
corrverge upon a single given point. As Breiner
(1973) points out, many monopole sources arc not
truly monopolar, but rather are dipolar sources of
sufficient size that only one end of the local field
is detected. Dipoles, similar in configuration to the
earth's field as a whole, are the more common
archeological signatures. Typical dipole signatures
consist of paired positive and negative anomalies
that represent the warping of the field around the
source. Unless the object is shallowly buried, lbe
position of the anomaly is usually offset from tlte
position of the source in n direction related to the
orientation and inclination of the ambient field of

variatioos in the magnetic susceptibility of site
sediments. For example, humus-rich sediment is
typically more magnetic than surroonding· soil,
permitting the identification of humus concentrntions, filled pits, and other inconsistencies in lbe
composition of the substrate. Walls and other
structural clements may be constructed of highly
magnetic materials, such as igneous rocks, and
result in a positive anomaly, or they may displace
a highly magnetic soil and result in a negative
anomaly. Continued displacement of surface soil
by the movement of inhabitants can result in lower
magnetism than surrounding soil affected by
incremental viscous magnetization. If the subsurface composition of a site is complex, lben the
results of magnetic survey can be a confusing
juxtapositioo of superimposed anomalies that is
impossible to interpret. At the other extreme, the
contrast iu magnetic susceptibility may be insufficient to indicate any anomalies at all, even in the
presence of burned features.
SURVEY PROCEDURES

Prior to lbe magnetic survey, the entire survey
area was swept with a metal detector in order to
remove any ferrous objects that might mask
anomalies associated with prehistoric features.
Measurement of the magnetic field over the site
was accomplished using two Geomellics G856X
portable proton precession magnetometers. These
instruments have a theoretical sensitivity of 0.1 y
(allbough the practical sensitivity suggested by
repeatability of readings is probably on the order
of 0,5 to 1.0 y ). One of the magnetometers (the
base station) was situated in an untrafficked area
on the northern side of the spoil moond and placed
in automatic mode in order to record fluctuations
in the eartl1's magnetic field (diurnal drift) duriog
the survey at JO-second intervals. The 0U1er
magnetometer was operated by a two-person team;
one person placed the sensor while the other
operated the instrument pack. For this project,
field readings were taken on a l -m grid at a sensor
height of 75 cm,
111e survey grids were established by means
of a transit and two fiberglass measuring tapes with
the comers marked by wooden stakes. Individual
grid points were located by stretching two fiberglass measuring tapes along the long axL' of tlte
survey grid and then placing anotl1er tape between

the source.
Both monopolar and di polar signatures vary
considerably depending upon the sire, magnetic
intensity, deptl1, and orientation of die feature
producing them and the latitude and orientation of
transect lines, The strength of an anomaly as
measured by a magnetometer varies as the inverse
cube of its distance from lbe sensor. Thus, small
features located near the ground surface typically
produce a sharply defined peak witl1 little areal
extent, while large, deeply buried features result in
a more extensive, gradual signature.
As a general rule, archcological anomalies arc
more intense than the surrounding matrix (Breiner
1973). With the exception of ferrous objects,
burned and fired cultural malerials with thermoremancnt magnetic properties produce the strongest
signatures. Other differences arise from strong

paired points every third smvey line. At the end
of each survey, the data collected were dumped
onto a Macintosh personal computer and subsequently corrected for diurnal drift and any errors
incurred in tl1e field. A total of 3,11! m2 was
surveyed during the feasibility study in April, 1989.
The results of the magnetic smvey were
plotted as gray-scale intensity maps in which the
range of values is divided into ten different classes
and each point is assigned to a class. Anomalies
of interest were identified from these plots and
redrawn as line contour maps for closer examination. In consideration of previous theoretical and
empirical studies that have examined bmned feature
magnetic anomalies (Breiner 1973; Gibson 1986;
Sternberg 1987), and a review of results obtained
from previous investigations at Stacy Reservoir in
Coleman, Concho, and Runnels counties, Texas
(Abbott and Frederick l 989a) and Justiceburg
Reservoir in Garza and Kent counties, Texas
(Abbott and Frederick 1989b), only anomalies
exhibiting apparent dipolar signatures were selected
for detailed inspection. In all, 12 anomalies were
selected from the magnetic maps for further
examination and contouring.
Of these, four
appeared to be dipoles with the remaining eight
apparently being complex anomalies.
Depth
estimations for dipolar anomalies were calculated
using the slope teclrnique outlined by Breiner
(1973:31). These anomalies are discussed furtl1er
in the site descriptions sections.
In order to better evaluate the potential signal
strength expected at the two sites, two different
tests of burned clay lumps were performed in the
field. In the first of these, the magnetic susceptibility of one large (about 75 g) clay lump was
evaluated by holding the object away from the
sensor and taking a reading and then immediately
taking another reading with the object adjacent to
the sensor. This procedure was repeated three
times and each time no increase in the magnetic
field was observed during the second reading. The
other test of the magnetic signal produced by these
objects involved gathering approximately IO large
clay lumps and placing them in a pile and then
running a small X-shaped survey over the group.
As in the previous test, no change in the magnetic
field was observed in the vicinity of the objects.
Although both of these tests should provide
a crude indication of the magnetic susceptibility of
the clay lumps, neither produced a measurable

signal. Three possible explanations for this are
presented here: the objects are unfired and are the
products of diagenesis, the objects were fired at a
temperature well below the Curie point of the
material and therefore retain no thermoremanent
magnetic signal, or insufficient amounts of magnetic mineral species are present to result in a
measurable thermoremanent magnetic signal,
SITE 41WY112

The portion of this site chosen for tl1e magnetometer survey was located along a curve in the
road situated on the northern side of the ditch, A
transit and two fiberglass measuring tapes were
used to establish a set of six 25x8-m rectangular
grids that shared comer points on the inside of the
curve, and one l00x8-m grid on a straight portion
of the road immediately west of the curve. For
purposes of analysis, the 100-m grid was subdivided into four segments. The grids were
designated A-J (see Fig. 22 for location and
orientation of prospection grids). Each of the small
grids was rotated in such a mauner as to maximize
the portion of the grid that covered the flat section
of the road, and effectively minimize the portion
of the grid situated over the sloping margin of the
ditch on or below the small berm. In most cases,
the last two and occasionally three readings were
made with the sensor placed on the sloping margin
of the ditch below the berm.
Subsequent to the establishment of the survey
grids, the entire set of prospection blocks was
swept with a metal detector. All of the grid blocks
yielded metallic debris, but the first two (A and B)
contained the most metal.
Items recovered
consisted primarily of shotgun shell cartridges,
pop/beer-can pull tabs, and other, usually
unrecognizable, ferrous objects.
The magnetic survey of this site resulted in
the collection of 2,304 data points recorded on two
successive days. Although all of the grid blocks
were surveyed as a group, each 25-m block was
plotted separately in order to facilitate analysis of
the resulting magnetic map.
Numerous magnetic anomalies were observed
in the plots of the magnetic field strength of this
site (Figs. 53 and 54). All of tl1e resulting magnetic maps shared the distinct trend of exhibiting
a magnetie gradient that was strongest immediately
adjacent to the portion of the survey nearest to the

sloping ditch margin. Evaluation of U1e site
geology and the location of the sensor in this
vicinity indicated that the gradient exhibited on the
magnetic maps was probably a function of two
factors: a thickening of the A horizon toward the
ditch margin below the berm due to scraping and
grading of the road surface, and the proximity of
the sensor to the A horizon on the readings made
along the sloping margin of the ditch. The magnetic intensity of the A horizon was apparently a
function of the amount of organic matter present.

In addition to this gradient, seven discrete
anomalies of variable size and magnitude were
observed and considered worthy of field verification. These anomalies, numbered 1-7, exhibited
a range of morphology, among which were four
dipoles. Illustrations of these anomalies may be
found in Figures 55 and 56. Anomaly 1 was
situated along survey lines 2-6 at the northeastern
end of grid block A (sec Fig. 55a). It consisted of
a complex anomaly which appeared to be a small,
very weak rotated dipole with an amplitude of

20-24 near the soutl1westem end of grid block B
(see Fig. 55c). As witb Anomaly 2, the intensity
and orientation of this feature suggest that it is a
piece of metal that may be located at a depth
between 0.6 and 1.85 m. Anomaly 4 was situated
along suJVey lines 10-12 in the nortlieastcm half
of grid block E. This magnetic feature appeared
to be a complex anomaly characterized by a 1.8 y
gradient present in one 2-m inteIVal in an otl1envise

55d). The source or this feature is unknowr. A

ceramic or very small piece of ferrous metal.
Anomaly 2 was located near the center of the
second grid along survey lines 13-l 6. 111is
anomaly was a rotated dipole possessing an
amplitude of 15.9 y (see Fig. 55b). The orientation and inteoslty of Uris feature indicate that lhe
source is most likely a metal object buried between
0.4 and JJ4 m below the snrface. Anomaly 3 was
a 45.7 y rotated dipole situated on survey lines

located at tl1e southeastern edge of grid block G
(see Fig. 56b). It was present on survey lines 2426 and was of interest because it appeared to be
a magnetic low spot wi01in the uniformly high
region adjacent to the ditch margin. As such, it
could represent a rotated dipole with an intensity
of about 2. 7 y which would be consistent with a
very small piece of metal or ceramic. The contour
plot of this anomaly failed to provide better
resolution, in part due to the location of the
anomaly along the edge of the survey block. The
last anomaly examined at this site (Anomaly 7)

fifth anomaly was a magnetic low spot situated
adjacent to the magnetic high present along the
southern margin of grid block G along survey lines
19-21 (see Fig. 56a). It is possible that this
anomaly is a dipole but that the positive portion of
the anomaly is obscured by the high intensity zone
caused by the organic soil horizon present in this
area. If this is the case, the intensity of the feature
is roughly 14.4 y. If, however, this is simply a
monopolar low, the intensity of the anomaly is
about 2.7 y below the smrnunding field. The
origin of this anomaly is unknown. Anomaly 6 was

Also a complex feature, this anomaly nppeured to
be a small gradient present in a magnetically quiet
portion of the grid (sec Fig. 56c). Table l provides

five anomalies were selected for closer examination. Anomaly l was an elongate 32.8 y dipole
oriented roughly east-west (Fig. 58a). Tiiis
anomaly was situated along tlJC northern murgin of

lines 1-3). The intensity and orientntion of this
feature are consistent with a piece of metal but the
shape of the contoured anomaly indicates that not
all of the feature was within the survey grid making
n depth estimate impractical. The other features
identified at this site were all present in grid block
D, and were all complex anomalies (see Fig. 58b
and 58c). No discrete dipolar features were
observed among any of these anomalies, although
the complex field variations present in both of these
regions initially give such an impression. TIJC
source of these anomalies is unknown. Table 26
provides a summary of the anomalies examined at
this site.

The survey grid estnblishcd at this site
measured l0llx7 m and was situated along a
straight portion of tlie road on the nortl1 side of the
ditch (see Fig. 27 for location and orientation of
prospection grids). A total of 807 data points was
collected on the afternoon ·of April 26, 1989. As
with the survey at 41WYll2, the last two and
occasionally three readings of each swvcy line
were made with the sensor placed on the sloping
margin of the ditch at or below the berm. Likewise, the entire grid was smveyed with a metal
detector prior to the magnetometer survey in order
to remove any ferrous objects that could obscure
more subtle magnetic features. Numerous metal
objects were obtained during this process, but nol
as many items were present on tl1is site as at
41WY112. Prior to processing the magnetic survey
data, the file was split into four 25-m segments
(A-D) in order to facilitate examination of the
magnetic map.
As at site 41WY112, tlic magnetic plots of
this site displayed a magnetic gradient from north
to south, with the most intense portion of the fieW
present along the sloping margin of the ditch (Fig.
57). Tiiis feature was also intcrprete-0 ns a function
of road construction and sensor proximity to the A

CONCLUSIONS
Al01ough both of the survey grids discussed
here were cleared of metallic debris with a metal
detector prior to the magnetic survey, some ferrous
object' appear to have eluded detection. All of the
dipolar anomalies observed on the magnetic maps
appear to be consistent with signals generated by
metallic objects with lhe exception of Anomaly 1
at site 41 WY112 which may be produced by either
a ceramic or metal object. Of the other anomalies
examined at these sites, all appeared to be complex
anomalies characterized by a magnetic gradient in

APPENDIX D: Radiocarbon Dating

C. Britt Bousman

Twenty-four radiocarbon dates were
obtained from a variety of materials in the
Hidalgo-Willacy Drainage Ditch project area.
The dated materials consist of charcoal, calcium
carbonate nodules, freshwater marl, gelatin and
apatite fractions of human and animal bones, and
bulk soil humates, i.e., sediments, from buried
soils and pond deposits. Table 27 lists the
unconected (Libby half-life), the 6 13 C conected,
and when possible, tree-ring calibrated ages, as
well as associated carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen
stable isotope ratios.
The stable isotope
measurements on bones are from the collagen
(gelatin) fractions unless otherwise indicated.
Ages younger than 8100 B.P. were calibrated
using the 20-year atmospheric record which
requires 6 13C cmTected dates (Stuiver and Reimer
1986). The ages within the parentheses represent
the intercepts on the calibration curve, and the two
ages outside of the parentheses represent the one
standard deviation range on either side of the
intercept(s). Ages between 8100 and 13,300 B.P.
can be roughly calibrated by tl1e formula:

the amount of C4 vegetation in this region, dates
on bulk soil humates and bones should always be
concctcd for fractionation effect. This graph
demonstrates why conectcd radiocarbon dates
must be used in tl1e new calibration curves.
Much recent research on bone dating has
shown that apatite dates are often unreliable,
especially if secondary carbonates are not carefully removed from the inorganic fraction (Hassan
et al. 1977; Taylor 1987:53-61). Whenever
possible, the organic fractions (i.e., bone gelatin or
collagen) should be dated, but recent research has
also shown that even these fractions can be altered
by diagencsis (Stafford et al. 1987; Stafford et al.
1988). Thus all bone dates must be considered
with caution.
Two radiocarbon dates have been obtained
from bone from the human burial at 41WY50.
Previously, an apatite sample produced an age of
540 ± 110 B.P. (Tx-4256) (Prewitt 1981); however, this date was not conected for carbon
isotope fractionation effect (Sam Valastro, personal communication 1989). The burial was well
preserved and, in an effort to obtain a more accurate age for the burial, a small sample of gelatin
was extracted for radiocarbon dating aJ!d stable
isotope analysis. The resulting conventional gelatin age of 1415 ± 140 B.P. (GX-15124-G) is
considered more reliable than the previous date,
because it was run on gelatin and conected for
fractionation effect. At 41WY113, gelatin and
apatite fractions from two separate bone samples
were dated as well. The gelatin dates are younger
by 742 years in one case (GX-15123-G versus
GX-15123-A) and 480 years in the other (GX15122-G versus GX-15122-A). In all three cases
where matching gelatin (i.e., collagen) and apatite
radiocarbon dates are available, the difference
between the matched pairs represents a significant
change in estimated age (Student's t = 1.88, p
<0.07 [41WY113, deer], Student's t = 4.91, p
<0.01 [41WY50, human burial], Student's t = 3.25,
p <0.01 [41WYll3, human burial]). In two additional radiocarbon bone samples, i.e., the 41 WY67
human remains (GX-15254-A) and the 41WY140
turtle shell (GX-15125-A), only apatite dates
were possible because of poor preservation of the
gelatin fraction. While both apatite dates are very
interesting and challenging to regional prehistoric
interpretations and models, they must be regarded
witl1 added caution.

Calibrated age= l.05(corrected age)+ 470.

Radiocarbon ages older tl1an 13 ,300 B .P. cannot
be calibrated. Ages younger than 200 B.P. fall
within the nonlinear portion of the calibration
curve and have too many intercepts for useful
calibration. Gelatin samples from the human
burial and deer radius at 41WY113 were so small
that these could be dated only by the AMS (accelerator mass spectrometer) technique, and samples
were prepared by Geochron Laboratories and sent
to the Institute of Nuclear Research at D.S.I.R. in
New Zealand for this analysis. However, the
conventional radiocarbon lab (Geochron) dated the
apatite fractions of tl1cse samples, and has generously made these dates and stable isotopes available.
The graph below (Fig. 59) shows that ages
conected for fractionation effect can change
significantly from tl1e unconectcd ages, especially
when younger than 5000 B.P. Only three dates
were obtained from charcoal. On two of these, the
unconected and concctcd ages are tl1e same; for
the third, the age is reduced by the fractionation
conection. In materials such as bulk soil humatcs,
bones, and calcium carbonate, however, the fractionation conection consistently alters the ages,
sometimes by signifieant amounts. Considering

APPENDIX E: Application and Comparison of Two Water Pump Systems

Colin M. Garvey

INTRODUCTION

utilized by trash and transfer pumps. Also, the
high pressure hoses are far less prone to punctures
and carry a greater pound per square inch (psi)
load without blowing fittings.
To power the agricultural pump in die field,
a 5-horsepower Briggs and Stratton horizontal
gasoline engine was used. This provided a maximum available pressure of 300 psi with a single
discharge line. Although no more than two discharge lines were used, it is possible to operate
the system with more. Each additional discharge
line will reduce lhe psi to each screening station.
For example, each discharge line in a two-line
setup could carry as much as 150 psi, in four lines
75 psi and so on. By comparison, a typical
outdoor household spickct averages 40-60 psi.
While these figures represent ideal performance
levels but do not account for poor equipment
conclitions, it is evident that a system such as this
is extremely useful in providing the various pressure needs encountered in archeological water
screening.

During the current project, two different
water pump systems were employed in water
screening. The following is a brief discussion of
!heir functions as well as advantages and disadvantages to practical archeological field application. This is not intended to be a comparison of
makes and models but simply a comparison of
tested pump alternatives.
THE AGRICUl,TURAL PUMP OR
POSITIVE DISPI,ACEMENT
ROLLER SPRAY PUMP
This apparatus is a proven system in iL~
normal agricultural stop-and-go spraying of
corrosive liquid fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides. This task requires a noncorro.<ive pump
with an ability to run multiple high pressure
discharge lines while protecting lhe sysiem against
power surges. These qualities make it useful for
archeological water- screening applications,
particularly its ability to feed several stations at
once without a great loss of pressure. This is
accomplished by means of a manually preset
pressure relief valve located in the pump outlet
which reduces the chance of engine over-load
(Fig. 60).

Another convenience of the agricultural pump
is lhat it requires only 3/4-inch-diameter high
pressure hoses, eliminating lhe need for lhe
larger-diameter (2-incb or 3- inch) vinyl hoses

The trash pump is commonly used for archeological pnrposes simply because it is generally
more available. Its design emphasizes movement
of large volumes at lhe expense of pressure. An
advantage of these pumps is the speed with which
they con drain flooded excavations by utilizing a
large-diameter hose. Additionolly, many of the
newer models are equipped wilh engines that
include an automatic shut-off protecting against
damages resulting from low or no oil in the
crankcase.
The disadvantages of the trash pump arc
maoy in comparison to lhe agricultural pump.
Since lhe tra~h pump is a volume mover, serious
problem~ from pressure fecclbaek can result due to
alterations such as stepping down lhe main discharge hose size to increase the pressure or
increasing the number of discharge lines off the
moin discharge line (Fig. 61). It is important to
maintain a corc~tant flow of water through lhc
discliargc line or lines since lhc trash pump is not
equipped wilh a relief valve. The ideal would be
to allow the main discharge line to run freely but
this would require handling a two-inch-diameter
hose at the screening station which could be a very
cumbersome task. The trash pump is also snbjcct
to additional strain when attempting lo force water

controllable pressure system using an adjustable
nozzle is preferable to a constant high-volume
low-pressure unalterable flow. An agricultural
pump system is not only more efficient, it is
considerably less expensive to customize or rent.
It can allow for far greater flexibility with less
labor.

placed in some field situations.
SUMMARY

The basic difference between the two pumps
discussed here is their accomodation of pressure
and volume. For most screening operations, a

APPENDIX F: Archeological Reconnaissance of a Realigned Segment
of the Mission-Lateral, Hidalgo County, Texas

INTRODUCTION
Archcological reconnaissance of a realigned
channel segment of the Mission-McAllen Lateral
west of Edinburg, Texas, was conducted for
Hidalgo County Drainage District No. 1 during the
month of April, 1989 by Prewitt and Associates,
Inc., Austin. This work is a continuation of a
survey program intended to mitigate damages to
cultural resources resulting from implementation or
drainage improvements (Mallouf et al. 1977; Day
et al. 1981; Hall et al. 1987).
The Mission-McAllen Lateral ditch realignment lies nearly 9.6 km (6 miles) west or the
Edinburg courU10use and 3.5 km (2.25 miles) south
of Highway 107. It extends from the north-south
Edinburg Canal westward nearly 800 m (0.5
miles) crossing Bentsen Road, then turns 90° north
for another 450 m (0.25 miles) to connect with a
previously sorveyed segment (Fig. 62). The
Mission-McAllen Lateral lies in the lowland plain
(see Chapter I). The realigned segment crosses an
area near an eolian depression, most of which has
been cultivated in the past. Presently, the portion
lying east of Bentsen Road is overgrown \vith
various acacia trees with virtually no ground
cover.
TI1e remaining portion is overgrazed
pasture with sparse grasses :md few acacia trees.

The realigned segment was trav~fs~ .
zigzag fashion between the marked right...:Ot'.:'.
boundaries from Bentsen Road to each end arid:''
back again. The ground surface, including small
water ditches and rodent holes, was inspected for
signs of cultural materials.
No prehistoric or historic sites were discovered during this surface reconnaissance. Materials
obse1vcd include sparse land snails (Rabdotus sp.),
recent garbage, and recent bovid elements in
various stages of decay.
No gravels were
observed except immediately adjacent to Bentsen
Road.
This realigned segment reveals no surface
evidence of archeological resources. However, in
keeping with previous programs of investigations
in the Hidalgo-Willacy Drainage Ditch project, it
is recommended that this high-potential area
adjacent to the depression be reinspected following
th0 excavation of the ditch. Examination of the
ditch banks following construction should permit a
clearer understanding of geology in this area and
an opportunity to recognize buried sites.
