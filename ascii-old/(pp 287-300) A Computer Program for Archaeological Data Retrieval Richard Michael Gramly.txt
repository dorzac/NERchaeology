A Computer Program for Archaeological
Data Retrieval
RICHARD

ABSTRACT
Utilizing the perimeter of one artifact it is possible to select other artifacts
with similar perimeters from a collection of thousands of speeimens.
The selection is based upon a step-by-step comparison of perimeters. Variables of the program permit selection of artifacts with perimeters of varying
exactness with respect to the perimeter of one artifact. This exach~ess or
tolerance can be specified by the investigator.
Possible uses for this program are the rough-sorting of artifaet eoleetions
into artifact classes and the inspection of projectile point eolleetions for the
distribution of projectile points as a clue to the spatial-temporal dinaensions
of traditions and horizons.

INTRODUCTION
This program was designed to eliminate the time-consuming and
inefficient operation of searching a large collection of artifacts for
artifacts of specified character. The program was also created with the
hope in mind that photographs and drawings of artifacts published in
obscure or relatively inaccessible journals of archaeology could be
treated so that part of this information would be at instant recall to
an investigator.
Also there was felt to be a need for a means of gathering data about
m’tifacts from small, private collections that m’e seen for the first, and
perhaps the last, trine in the course of an archaeological survey.
The first section of this paper outlines the nature and limitations of
this computer program for archaeological data retrieval. The second
section gives instructions for the operation of the program: while the
last section sets forth an actual example of the utility of this progn’am.
During this era of increasing awareness of the real value of archaeological research and site salvage, as is anaply evidenced by the great
number of mnateur archaeological excavations and the increased
tempo of professional investigations, the need for a means of assflnilating and comprehending the vast amount of data that has been
gathered is at hand.
Hopefully this program will allow the investigator to master nmch
of this data; but if this system of data retrieval is not the one that is
ultimately put into use, perhaps it will be seen as a step in that
direction.

THE PROGRAM

In essence, the computer is requested to discriminate among artifacts according to their two dimensional shape, that is to say, by the
trace of a perimeter. Real artifacts, of eom’se are three dimensional,
and there are many perimeters to choose from; in the case of projectile points, however, for which this system of data relaieval perhaps
has the greatest utility, the cross-sections of thickness are not norreally used to discriminate types. In the ease of projectile points the
plane containing the dimensions of length and width is considered
most significant for typing.
It is to be expected that two artifacts of similar shape may have
different linear perimeters because of a difference in size. In order
that the computer consider these two artifacts of similar shape but
different size the same type, the linear perimeters of all artifacts are
normalized. Of course, the true length of the artifact is also noted in
order that the investigator be able to subdivide a type into size categories.
Each artifact whose linear perimeter, or perimeters, is stored in the
data bank for this program is accompanied by general fifformation
cards that specify the material from which the artifact was made, the
find locus, a measure of the length of the artifact, and so forth.
If it is desired, that once the computer has sorted the data bank for
artifacts of a specified character, the output could be further sorted on
a card-sorter under the categories of information that are contained
on the general information cards with each artifact in the output.
Thus it would be possible to retrieve all narrow-stemmed points
similar to a certain narrow-stemmed point, sort the output into categories of size, and then discriminate among the projectile points on
the basis of lithic material. The last two operations are done on a
punch-card sorter.
It is foreseen that tavo artifacts that are considered to be the same
type may have similar, but not congruent, linear perfineters even after
the artifacts have been normalized. In order to express this departure
in linear perimeter between two artifacts, any two artifacts . . . not
just those that are considered the same type, the computer sorts artifacts into categories of exactness, that is, categories of diminishing
congruency of the linear perfineter. Figure 6 of this article illustrates
six categories of decreasing congruency with respect to a particular
Adena point and 99 other artifacts.
The investigator is free to choose the extent of the range of the
categories of decreasing eongrueney. As it stands now, it is possible

COIVfPUTER P1RO GHA1Vf

289

in tilis program to output artifacts under 20 categories of decreasing
eongTueney. Artifacts in the 20th category will be least congruent to
tile linear perimeter of the artifact for which the data retrieval was
instigated.
The form of the output of the program can either be sheet listings
or punch-cards. The form of the output is usually specified at the
computing center where the job is executed. If it is desired to sort the
general information cards of the artifacts in the output for the find loci,
let us say, it would be wise to request an output of puneh-exu’ds, which
could be fed directly into a card sorter.
The output of the progTam for each artifact is 1) a listing of the
linear perimeter of the ~’tifaet exactly as it was read by the computer,
2) a listing of the data contained on the general information cards, and
3) the category of decreasing congruency into which an artifact falls
with respect to the linear perimeter of the artifact for which the data
retrieval was instigated. See part III of this paper for an example of
the output of this program"
The machine language used in this program is Fortran IV, and the
computer used to run the example in Part III was the IBM 360, G
level. Several logical IF statements are used in this program; and
before this program is used, the investigator should check to see if
these statements are within the operating capability of his computer.
The investigator also may need to change the first number within
the parentiaeses of the READ and WRITE statements. Once this
change is made it will not have to be made again unless perhaps a
different computer is used.
The required changes in value of the control variables for jobs of
different size or the extent of the range of decreasing congruency are
set forth in Part II of this paper.
Compilation on the IBM 360 takes about 8 seconds. In one minute
the linear perimeters of nearly 1000 artifacts can be examined and the
program executed. At $240.00 per hour, a reasonable estfinate of the
charge for the use of an IBM 360, it would cost about $5.00 to $8.00
to run the program for 1,000 specimens, depending upon the extent
of the range of decreasing congruency.
II. INPUT TO THE PROGRAM
The method of ascertaining the linear perimeter of an artifact
utilizes one of a series of clear plastic grids. All the grids of the series
are photographic reductions of a single, large gTid.
As shown in Figure 1, the smallest, clear plastic grid that will just

290

AI~CHEOLOGICAL

SOCIETY

contain the artifact (in the case of projectile points I consistently place
the tip of the point towards the top of the grid) is used to txaee the
perimeter of the artifact. The artifact is always left-justified in the grid.
There are no other specifications for the placement of the artifact
within the grid.
The method of reading off intersections of an artifact perimeter on
a grid is shown in Figure 1. The values of the intersections are fed
:into a matrix, and each artifact has its own matrix of intersections.
There are a maximum of 84 intersections.
The only rule of reading intersections is that no column have only
one or three intersections. There nmst either be two or four intersections. If for one column an artifaet clearly intersects at one place only,
estimate another intersection one grid greater. Thus, change a cohimn
reading of 07 00 00 00 showing only one intersection to 07 08 00 00.
In addition to the matrix of glJd intersections desclJbing the perimeter of the mlffact, each artifact is alloted 160 information spaces.
This is the amount of information that is contained on two data punehem’ds. Ten spaces of the 160 are reserved for two, five-digit, identification numbers. If a bank of data cards is accidentally dropped and
the cards set out of order, the program is prepared to detect this
disorder using the identification numbers.
In Figure 2, there is given an example of how the 160 information
spaces may be used to describe the find locus and other pertinent
characteristics of an artifact, in this ease a projectile point. The county
and state of a find locus are designated by a unique number code as
set forth by the American Petroleum Institute.1
At the present moment the user of this program will have to design
his own clear plastic grids for the determination of perimeter-intersections. For this program the only requirements of the grids are that
the grids be square and dimensioned into 400 squares (20 by 20
spaces). Also the grids must be members of a propoltionately-reduced
or normalized series.
In the future the program will be modified to incorporate grids of 24
spaces square, and these grids will be furnished to those interested at
no cost.
The importance of constructing a carefully normalized series of grids
is shown in Figure 3. Here two projectile points of similar, but not
eongruent, perimeter will give nearly the same matrix of perimeterintersections when normalized grids are used.

General information cards and perimeter-intersection cards can be
punched at a small cost, and, of course, once this information about an
artifact is recorded, it need never be punched again. Most of the labor
involved in the input of data to this program is the reading of the
perimeter-interseetions of the artifacts. This can be fatiguing. With a
proper series of grids and a standard recording form it is possible to
record 30 to 35 artifacts in an hour’s time.
The last points that must be covered in conjunction with the usage
of this data retrieval system aa’e 1) the user-specific control variables
and 2) the order of the data cards, which specify the control variables
and describe the artifacts, as they are fed into the computer.
Figm’e 4 illustTates the nature and order of the punch-cards (the
data cards), which specify the control variables and describe the
artifacts, as they are fed into the computer.

AN EXAMPLE OF THE OUTPUT

A sample of 100 artifacts, mostly projectile points from Missouri,
was prepared as a data bank and input to the computer. An Adena
point was used as the basis of comparison; thus ITESTll and ITESTL
were the matrix of the perimeter-intersections for this projectile point.
Eight categories of decreasing congruency were specified, and the
range of these categories was 1-8.
A samp!e of the printed output from this artifact-sorting on the
basis of the Adena point is given in Figure 5.
Figure 6, displays the result of this artifact-sorting for categories 1-6.
Figure 7, illustrates a samp!e of the artifacts that were not included
in the six categories shown in Figure 5.

9,96

TEXAS AIRCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

A close inspection of Figure 5 will reveal that the sorting was sueeessful in so far as the computer included no artifacts radically different from the Adena point used as a basis for comparison.
The machine time for this job cost $1.38.

FmuRE 5: The form of the Output for program "RETRIEVE"

Figure 5 shows how each artifact falls into two categories of
decreasing congruency. As is the case for artifacts #11 and 4#82, these
two categories are the same. Artifact #19.9, on the other hand, falls into
two different categories. Choose the category with the most diminished
congruency as the con’eet category for that artifact.
In Figm’e 6, column a contains the artifacts that were selected for
the first category of decreasing congruency with respeet to the perimeter of the Adena point shown in the upper left hand corner of the
figure. Column b contains the arUfaets of the second category of
decreasing congruency; column c contains the artifacts of the third
category, and so forth.

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

CONCLUSION
The operating procedure of a computer program designed for
archaeological data retrieval has been set forth.
The use to which this program is put rests with the investigator.
The author intends to utilize the program as a part of an extensive
archaeological survey to be conducted in the near future. His use of
the program wilt be merely to retrieve ga’oss classes of archeaological
data, for example to distinguish between axes and knives from a data
bank of thousands of artifacts.
Other investigators may wish to study the areal and temporal extent
of traditions (in the archaeological sense) using this program.
Even ff this program does not become widely used, the fact that
this program was written points to a need for a good, working system
for the masteiT of arehaeologieal data.
A limited nmnber of punch card decks containing the program are
available for the cost of postage (about $.50).
These decks may be obtained by writing the author at the following
address: 422 Fairway Avenue, Ehnira, New York, 14904.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The author would like to thai~ C. F. Iglehart of Pan-American
Petroleum Inc., Dr. W. W. Howells, and Daniel Ingersoll both of
Department of Anthropology, Harvard University, for their helpful
advice and attention.
A grant, which made the completion of this project possible, was
obtained through the Tozzer Fund of Harvard University.
