ABSTRACT
In May of 2004, Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) evaluated the
archaeological potential of a proposed 25 mile water supply line within state and county
road rights-of-way in Shelby and Panola counties and a five mile cross-country segment on
private property in Shelby County. The 25 mile segment was found to be too disturbed to
warrant a formal investigation. Within the cross-country section, however, a 1760 foot
segment (0.6 acre) was selected for shovel testing because of its proximity to a previously
recorded prehistoric site (41SY268) and a historic spring. This site was recorded circa
1999 by archaeologists from the Austin based contract firm SWCA. According to
information provided by SWCA, site 41SY268 was described by the original recorder as a
Caddo campsite/farmstead. Although the original recorders only found one undecorated
ceramic fragment and two pieces of debitage in 26 shovel tests, an archaeological survey
of that portion of the water supply route which on a hill overlooking the spring was
recommended by the Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division. The investigation
was conducted by William E. Moore and Edward P. Baxter under Archeology Permit 3419.
No evidence of a prehistoric site was found in the area. It is recommended that
construction of the water supply line be allowed to proceed as planned. No artifacts were
collected.

INTRODUCTION
The Paxton Water Supply Corporation (WSC) plans to provide water to its
customers by connecting 25 miles of new water line and connections in rural Panola and
Shelby counties. The new line will vary from 4" to 8" line in size and will be placed in
ditches with approximately 36" of cover. Therefore, the depth of the ditches will vary
between 40" and 48" below the ground surface. Except for a five mile segment that
traverses cross-country parallel to an existing transmission line, the entire water line will be
placed within existing highway rights-of-way. The Federal agency involved with this project
is the United States Department of Agriculture, Rural Utility Services (RUS), and the
representative for RUS is Steve Kelley.
The plans for this project with accompanying maps were submitted by the client to
the Texas Historical Commission (THC), Archeology Division, for review. Realizing the
potential for significant archaeological sites in this part of East Texas, the THC requested
the project plans be reviewed by a professional archaeologist to identify high probability
areas for formal survey. This request was made in a letter from F. Lawerence Oaks (State
Historic Preservation Officer) signed by William A. Martin and dated April 15, 2004.
Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) was retained by Paxton WSC through
Stolz Engineering & Associates, Inc. of Lufkin, Texas, to conduct an archaeological
assessment of the proposed water line. The project number assigned by BVRA is 04-12.
This assessment identified that portion of the water line route within highway rights-of-way
as too disturbed for survey. A five mile segment, however, traverses cross-country and
was viewed by BVRA as an area worthy of investigation. The records check revealed one
previously recorded site (41SY268) in close proximity to a portion of the overland route.
Following a review of the situation by William A. Martin, it was decided that a small
segment (1760 feet) of the overland route nearest this site be subjected to shovel testing.
Figure 1 depicts the general location of the area shovel tested. The project area, as
depicted on the USGS 7.5' topographic quadrangle Logansport West (3193-333), is
depicted in Figure 2.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
The nearest archaeological survey to the current project area involved a survey of a
40 mile water supply pipeline between an intake station on the Toledo Bend Reservoir
(Sabine River) in eastern Shelby County and the terminus of the pipeline at State Highway
315 in Rusk County in 1999 (Drake 2000). This project was conducted under Archeology
Permit 2201 with Kevin Anthony Miller the Principal Investigator. Twelve archaeological
sites and eight isolated occurrences of cultural materials were encountered and recorded
during this study. Two of the sites are in Shelby County, and one (41SY268) is very close
to the current project area. The area in which site 41SY268 is located was not an original
survey area. It was added after background research indicated that a freshwater spring
was located within 100 meters of the proposed easement. Twenty-six shovel tests were
excavated on and around the site, and three yielded prehistoric artifacts. Artifacts
recovered include a plain ceramic body sherd with bone and grog temper in Level 1 (0-20
cm), a small chert tertiary flake in Level 2 (20-40 cm), and a small petrified wood tertiary
flake in Level 2 (20-40 cm). It is not known if the ceramic sherd can be assigned to a
Caddo occupation or pre-dates this time period. This site is described on the site form as a
campsite/farmstead that is 75% intact. It is located in an upland setting at 275 feet above
mean sea level (amsl) adjacent to a first order tributary (Styles Creek). In the site report,
the size is listed as 25 x 90 meters on page 57 and 25 x 50 meters on page 69. The site
boundaries were defined by the edge of a landform to the west and negative shovel tests
elsewhere. Site 41SY268 was recommended by SWCA archaeologists as potentially
eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or for designation as a
State Archeological Landmark (SAL). According to SWCA archaeologists the significance
of this site is based on the fact that the artifacts were found within a relatively consistent
vertical distribution and restricted geographical space; therefore, the artifact density may be
indicative of a discrete habitation which can be isolated both in time and space. Limited
testing to determine if an isolated component exists was recommended. According to the
site form, the artifacts are curated at TARL. Laura Nightengale, Head of Collections at
TARL, stated that these artifacts have not been submitted to that agency for curation.

METHODS
Prior to entering the field, a check of the site records at TARL was conducted. This
search revealed the presence of several sites in the general area; however, only one site
(41SY268) is in close proximity to the project area as currently planned. This site is located
near a segment of the cross-country section (Appendix I). The Principal Investigator and
Project Archaeologist reviewed the topographic maps for high probability areas suitable for
shovel testing. According to Wayne Stolz, PE, the engineer for this project, the entire line
will be placed in disturbed rights-of-way. Following a discussion with William A. Martin,
Staff Archeologist at the Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division, it was decided
that the entire line should be field checked to confirm this statement. Therefore, on May 4,
2004, the Principal Investigator and Wayne Stolz drove the entire 25 miles looking for
suitable areas for shovel testing. The assessment team utilized topographic maps and
engineering bluelines to guide them through the scattered project area. No attempt was
made to plot the various forms of disturbance at each creek crossing on the topographic
maps since the water line route had been essentially cleared through a verbal conversation
with William A. Martin; the Principal Investigator; and the President of the Paxton WSC, the
Honorable Floyd A. Watson. Based on the field check, BVRA agreed that a formal survey
of that portion of the water supply line in disturbed rights-of-way was not necessary.
However, five miles of the project area traverses cross-country on private property. Since
a portion of this segment is in the vicinity of site 41SY268 and overlooks a historic spring,
BVRA recommended that this area be shovel tested and William A. Martin concurred.
The 1760 foot area overlooking site 41SY268 was shovel tested. Because of the
dense ground cover, a surface inspection was not considered necessary. The field crew
surveyed from the creek to an existing pipeline and adequately covered the landform
adjacent to the site. No shovel tests were placed in the extreme southern portion of the
project area because it is in a low marshy area resulting from the spring. All earth
excavated through shovel testing was passed through 1/4 inch screen, and a log was kept
(Appendix II). The tests were dug to sterile clay when possible and varied in depth from 20
cm to 90 cm. In all, eight shovel tests were dug (Figure 3). The project was documented
with a digital camera.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
A check of the site records at TARL revealed no archaeological sites have been
recorded directly within the route of the water supply line. One site (41SY268), however, is
close to a segment of the water line that traverses cross-country. There is no information
at TARL regarding this site except it is described as a Caddoan campsite that was
recorded during a pipeline survey by SWCA archaeologists in 1999. The field assessment
determined that the route of the water supply line that parallels state and county road
rights-of-way is too disturbed to warrant a formal survey. Shovel testing within the 1760
foot cross-country segment was negative in terms of cultural materials.
The area shovel tested was found to have been disturbed by clearing for an existing
transmission line right-of-way as well as the installation of the transmission towers; a
petroleum pipeline which run parallel to project area; and a water supply line which runs at
a right angle to the project area. The water line passes very close to the southern
boundary of site 41SY268. No records were found that an archaeological survey was
conducted for any of these disturbances.
The "Minimum Survey Standards" for project areas of 200 acres or less were
followed during this project.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Since the 25 mile segment is disturbed, and no archaeological site was found within
the 1760 foot overland area, it is recommended that construction of the water supply line
by Paxton WSC be allowed to proceed as planned.
