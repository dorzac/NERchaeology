ABSTRACT
On behalf of CPS Energy, SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) conducted archival background
research and cultural resources monitoring for the CPS Energy Alameda Theater Annex Duct Bank and
Vault Project in Bexar County, Texas, under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 6596. The project area is
approximately the northern two-thirds of the city block bounded by the 300 block of West Houston Street,
San Pedro Creek, West Commerce Street, and North Laredo Street in downtown San Antonio, Texas. The
project involved the installation of a vault and primary duct bank at the southwest corner of the property,
and the installation of a secondary duct bank extending west to east from the vault across the tract.
Additionally, three associated tie-in connectivity trenches extend from the eastern margin, southeastern
margin, and southwestern corner of the vault and primary duct bank area. Thus, the area of potential effects
(APE) is about 1.7 acres, with anticipated vertical disturbances up to 10.67 m (35 feet) deep. The APE has
been heavily disturbed by prior vegetation clearing, road construction, the erection and demolition of
historic and modern buildings, the existing asphalt-covered parking lot, and the installation of utility
infrastructure.
The investigations included an archival background review and archaeological monitoring during grounddisturbing construction activities. The background review revealed that the project area has been previously
surveyed at a reconnaissance level and that no previously recorded archaeological sites are within or
adjacent to the project area. Within a 0.25-mile radius of the project area, there are approximately 11
previously conducted cultural resources investigations, 15 previously recorded archaeological sites, the
Main and Military Plazas National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) Historic District, eight properties
that are listed on the NRHP, 14 Official Texas Historical Markers, and 126 local neighborhood surveys,
including one for the Alameda Theater (Atlas 2014). Eleven of the archaeological sites are within the Main
and Military Plazas NRHP Historic District.
SWCA’s intensive archaeological monitoring was performed during project-related construction activities
that occurred on an as-needed basis in August 2013 and May 2014 through July 2014. The focus of the
investigations was to identify, record, and characterize any extant historic resources or deposits within the
project area, particularly any remains or materials associated with Spanish Colonial or nineteenth-century
occupations. The goal of the work was to examine and assess cultural deposits revealed during construction,
adequately document identified cultural resources, and collect sufficient information to make
determinations on age and significance.
Monitored excavations consisted of the vault and primary duct bank area, a long trench extending east to
west from the vault across the tract for the secondary duct bank, as well as three associated tie-in
connectivity trenches extending from the eastern margin, southeastern margin, and southwestern corner of
the vault and primary duct bank area. Overall, no definitive evidence suggested by artifacts or features was
observed in the project area that could be associated with the Spanish Colonial era or the nineteenth century.
All of the monitored construction-related excavations were within extensively disturbed deposits,
predominantly dating to the twentieth century, including modern utilities and construction material.
SWCA made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify historic properties within the project area. Based
on the results of the monitoring efforts, the excavations within the Alameda Theater Annex Duct Bank and
Vault project area had no effect on significant cultural properties and no further archaeological work is
recommended.

INTRODUCTION

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA

On behalf of City Public Service Energy (CPS
Energy), SWCA Environmental Consultants
(SWCA) conducted archival background research
and cultural resources monitoring for the Alameda
Theater Annex Duct Bank and Vault Project in
central Bexar County, Texas (Figure 1). The project
area is approximately 76.2 meters (m) (250 feet)
south of the intersection of West Houston and North
Laredo Streets and a block east of Milam Park in
downtown San Antonio, Texas. The investigations
included an archival background review and
subsequent cultural resources monitoring during
project-related, ground-disturbing construction
activities. The purpose of the work was to examine
and assess any cultural deposits revealed in the
construction; adequately document the cultural
resources, including establishing vertical and
horizontal boundaries as appropriate with regard to
the project area; and provide sufficient information
to make determinations on age and significance.

The project area is approximately the northern twothirds of the city block bounded by the 300 block of
West Houston Street, San Pedro Creek, West
Commerce Street, and North Laredo Street (Figure
2). It is within the existing right-of-way (ROW) of
North Laredo Street and an adjacent parking lot in
the southwestern corner of the Alameda Theater
complex. The project area is located on the San
Antonio East (2998-133) U.S. Geological Survey
(USGS) 7.5-minute topographic quadrangular map.
The project involved the installation of a vault and
primary duct bank measuring approximately 12.80
m (42 feet) long, 6.71 m (22 feet) wide, and 5.49 m
(18 feet) deep at the southwest corner of the
property. It also involved the installation of a
secondary duct bank extending west to east from
the vault across the tract that was about 32.77 m
(107.5 feet) long, 1.52 to 1.83 m (5–6 feet) wide,
and 4.42 m (14.5 feet) deep. Additionally, three
associated tie-in connectivity trenches extend from
the eastern margin, southeastern margin, and
southwestern corner of the vault and primary duct
bank area. The connectivity trench along the eastern
margin of the vault measured approximately 2.44 to
2.74 m (8–9 feet) long, 1.52 m (5 feet) wide, and
4.42 to 4.57 m (14.5–15 feet) deep. The
connectivity trench along the southeastern margin
of the vault intended for tie-in with the secondary
duct bank was about 2.0 m (6.56 feet) long, 2.0 m
(6.56 feet) wide, and 2.90 m (9.5 feet) deep. Finally,
the connectivity trench extending from the
southwest corner of the vault measured roughly
10.67 to 13.72 m (35–45 feet) long, 0.91 m (3 feet)
wide, and ranged from 2.06 to 3.96 m (6.75–13
feet) in depth. Thus, the area of potential effects
(APE) is about 1.7 acres, with anticipated vertical
disturbances up to 10.67 m (35 feet) deep.

CPS Energy is a political subdivision of the state
and the work was conducted primarily within City
of San Antonio property; therefore, the
investigations were designed to comply with the
requirements of the Antiquities Code of Texas and
the City of San Antonio’s Historic Preservation and
Design Section of the Unified Development Code
(Article VI, Division 3, Sections 35-630 to 35-634).
All work was done in accordance with the standards
and guidelines of the Texas Historical Commission
(THC) and the Council of Texas Archeologists
(CTA) under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 6596.
SWCA archaeologist Mary Jo Galindo served as
Principal Investigator and Project Manager, while
Laura I. Acuña served as Project Archaeologist.
SWCA archaeologists Greg Sundborg, Rhiana D.
Ward, Allyson Walsh, and Tina Nielsen performed
the fieldwork and monitored ground disturbing
construction activities on an as-needed basis in
August 2013 and May 2014 through July 2014.

The APE is situated within a highly urbanized
setting. It has been heavily disturbed by prior
vegetation clearing, road construction, the erection
and demolition of historic and modern buildings,
the existing asphalt-covered parking lot, and the
installation of utility infrastructure.

As part of the review, an SWCA archaeologist
examined the Texas Department of Transportation
(TxDOT)
Historic
Overlay
Maps,
a
mapping/geographic information systems (GIS)
database system with historic maps and resource
information covering most portions of the state
(Foster et al. 2006). Historic and current aerial
photographs/maps, Bureau of Economic Geology
Maps, and the Natural Resources Conservation
Service (NRCS) Web Soil Survey for Bexar County
were also examined. Finally, Sanborn Fire
Insurance (Sanborn) maps were reviewed to assist
in identifying any historic resources or
disturbances, as well as to provide a record of urban
development.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
GEOLOGY
The underlying geology of the project area is 100
percent Quaternary-age Fluviatile terrace deposits
adjacent to the San Pedro Creek (Barnes 1983).
These terrace deposits consist of predominately
gravel, limestone, dolomite, and chert, with sand,
silt, and clay. Most low-terrace deposits along
entrenched waterways like San Pedro Creek are
above flood level (Barnes 1983).

SOILS
The project area soils are mapped as 100 percent
Houston Black clay terrace deposits with 1 to 3
percent slopes (Taylor et al. 1991:Map Sheet 53).
The Houston series consists of clayey soils that are
very deep, moderately well-drained, and very
slowly permeable. These soils formed from weakly
consolidated calcareous clays and marls of
Cretaceous-age found on nearly level to moderately
sloping uplands (NRCS 2013; Taylor et al.
1991:21).

FIELD METHODS
As part of the compliance process, the San Antonio
Office of Historic Preservation (SA-OHP)
requested that an archaeologist monitor the
excavations at the CPS Energy Alameda Theater
Annex Duct Bank and Vault Project. The
investigations consisted of monitoring all grounddisturbing construction activities associated with
the installation of a 4-unit pre-fabricated vault and
an associated secondary duct bank for the project.
The goal of the monitoring was to gather
information on the nature and types of cultural
resources possibly buried in the project area with a
focus on potentially significant resources related to
the Spanish Colonial-era or nineteenth-century
occupations.

METHODS
BACKGROUND REVIEW
SWCA performed an archival background review
of the project area to determine if the proposed APE
has been previously surveyed for cultural resources
or if any archaeological sites have been recorded
within or adjacent to the APE. An SWCA
archaeologist reviewed the San Antonio East
(2998-133) USGS 7.5-minute topographic
quadrangle map and searched the THC’s Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database.
These sources provided information on the nature
and location of previously conducted cultural
resources surveys, previously recorded historic
and/or prehistoric archaeological sites, National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) districts and/or
properties, State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs),
Official Texas Historical Markers (OTHMs),
Registered Texas Historic Landmarks, cemeteries,
and local neighborhood surveys in or near the
project area.

The archaeologists coordinated all field activities,
including scheduling and safety, with appropriate
personnel and the on-site construction foreman.
The archaeologists complied with all applicable
Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA) regulations and wore all required safety
equipment (e.g., hardhat, safety glasses, and steeltoed boots). Additional safety measures were
employed consisting of wearing rubber gloves
when handling soil and donning a dust mask when
in close proximity to the excavations, based on the
presence of soil contaminated with semi-volatiles,
inorganic contaminants, pesticides, polychlorinated
biphenyls (PCBs), and coal residue (RKEI 2012).
Monitoring consisted of a qualified archaeologist
observing the excavation area and process,

4

examining sediment as it was removed from each
trench, and inspecting the side walls frequently for
cultural materials. If encountered, artifacts were to
be examined, quantified, and assessed as to age and
origin, and generally not collected. Only diagnostic
artifacts or those of particular interest were to be
collected for further study in the SWCA laboratory.
Particular attention was given to any cultural
resources that may date to the eighteenth or
nineteenth century.

CULTURAL RESOURCES LITERATURE
AND RECORDS REVIEW
The archival background review determined that
the project area has been previously surveyed at a
reconnaissance level and that no previously
recorded archaeological sites are within or adjacent
to the project area. Within a 0.25-mile radius of the
project area are approximately 11 previously
conducted cultural resources investigations, 15
previously recorded archaeological sites, the Main
and Military Plazas NRHP Historic District, eight
properties that are listed on the NRHP, 14 OTHMs,
and 126 local neighborhood surveys including one
for the Alameda Theater (Atlas 2014). Eleven of the
archaeological sites are within the Main and
Military Plazas NRHP Historic District.

If intact cultural resource deposits were revealed in
the construction process, the archaeologist
attempted to make a determination as to potential
significance. If such a discovery was made,
construction was temporarily halted so that the
archaeologist could better examine the cultural
materials or features, take photographs, and
thoroughly document the finds. Once the materials
were assessed, construction recommenced and
continued as planned.

In 1979 on behalf of the U. S. Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE), Fort Worth District, the
project area was included in a reconnaissance
survey, along with a large swath of downtown
paralleling the San Antonio River (Atlas 2014; Fox
1979). There is no Texas Antiquities Permit number
associated with this project and the report contains
only general locational information regarding
historic structures and prehistoric sites within its
survey area. The current project area is not
referenced in this report (Fox 1979).

Only if the materials were assessed as extremely
significant (mainly human remains or burials) was
construction in the immediate area to be halted. If a
localized work stoppage was required, the
monitoring archaeologist would immediately call
all involved parties (CPS Energy, THC, HPO, etc.)
to discuss the find and formulate a plan of action.
However, over the course of the project it was not
necessary to implement this emergency
contingency plan.

One other survey and a monitoring project
encompass the project area; however, the Atlas
(2013) contains only locational data about the
survey. The monitoring project was conducted by
the Center for Archaeological Research at The
University of Texas at San Antonio (CAR-UTSA)
under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 657, and
included the existing ROWs of Houston and
Commerce Streets between Camaron and Laredo
Streets (Cox 1992). No cultural resources were
encountered along the portion of these streets that
are near or adjacent to the project area.

RESULTS OF BACKGROUND REVIEW
TEATRO ALAMEDA
The Alameda Theater was one of the most
advanced theaters of its time and an important
Spanish-language venue that attracted Mexican
entertainers touring the southwestern United States
(Atlas 2014). It was built 1945–1949 in the Art
Moderne style, but was reinterpreted to reflect San
Antonio’s Mexican heritage. The interior of the
building was designed by San Antonio sculptor
Pedro Terán who ornamented it with
phosphorescent murals of scenes from Texas and
Mexican history along with two aluminum statues
in the foyer representing the “Spirit of Dance”
(Atlas 2014).

The remaining eight previously conducted cultural
resources investigations occurred within a 0.25mile radius of the project area. In 2012, Raba
Kistner Environmental, Inc. (RKEI) performed an
archaeological survey and trenching for the San
Pedro Creek Restoration Project under Texas
Antiquities Permit No. 6367 (Clark et al. 2013).
Previously recorded sites 41BX179 and 41BX508

5

were revisited during the investigations resulting in
the expansion of the latter’s site boundary.

The
three
closest,
previously
recorded
archaeological sites include 41BX179, 41BX992,
and 41BX1598. Site 41BX179 is the Spanish
Governor’s Palace, which is about 125 m (411 feet)
southeast of the project area (Atlas 2014). Site
41BX992 is Milam Square, which is about 80
meters (264 feet) west, while site 41BX1598
contains features dating to the late 1700s through
the late 1800s and is about 161 m (529 feet) westsouthwest of the project area (Atlas 2014). Sites
41BX992 and 41BX1598 are both within the Main
and Military Plazas NRHP Historic District.

Two archaeological investigations were conducted
in Milam Park (41BX992), the former location of
the first City Cemetery, due west of the current
project area. Archaeological monitoring and the
exhumation, inspection, and temporary curation of
the burial believed to be that of Benjamin Milam
was completed under a revision of the existing
Texas Antiquities Permit No. 1177 by CAR-UTSA
in 1995 for the Milam Park Renovation Project
(Tennis and Winkler 1995). Archaeological
monitoring was conducted at the park in 2013 by
Atkins North America, Inc. (Atkins) under Texas
Antiquities Permit No. 6613 for the Milam Park
(41BX992) Playground Redevelopment Project
(Nichols 2014). Five possible grave markers were
observed within modern fill although no human
remains or coffin hardware was encountered, and
no further work was recommended (Nichols 2014).

MAIN AND MILITARY PLAZAS
NATIONAL REGISTER HISTORIC DISTRICT
Although the project area is not included in an
historic district, the Main and Military Plazas
NRHP Historic District is bounded by Camaron and
West Commerce Streets, and is about 330 m (1,082
feet) due east and 330 m (1,082 feet) due south of
the Alameda Theater project area.

Three cultural resources investigations were
performed southeast of the current project area and
within the 0.25-mile radius. Two of these were
conducted by CAR-UTSA and involved archival
research, eligibility testing, and monitoring during
the modification of Martin and Bowie Streets under
Texas Antiquities Permit No. 606 in 1987 and
testing investigations at the Spanish Governor’s
Palace (41BX179) under Texas Antiquities Permit
No. 1744 in 1996 (Atlas 2014). The third
investigation consisted of an archaeological survey
including monitoring and trenching performed in
2010 by PBS&J for the Bexar County Courthouse
Waterproofing Project under Texas Antiquities
Permit No. 4886 (Atlas 2014).

The Main and Military Plaza NRHP Historic
District is an area in downtown San Antonio
comprised of 13 whole blocks, the two plazas, and
portions of two additional blocks. The district
includes 36 contributing structures, 24 compatible
structures, and an open green space (Main Plaza).
Contributing structures include the primarily
nineteenth- and early twentieth-century two- and
three-story masonry structures, the eighteenthcentury Spanish Governor’s Palace, nineteenthcentury City Hall, Bexar County Courthouse, and
San Fernando Cathedral (National Register
Nomination Form No. 79002914).

HISTORIC MAP AND AERIAL
PHOTOGRAPH REVIEW

Finally, within the 0.25-mile radius, two previously
conducted cultural resources monitoring projects
are located due southwest and south of the current
project area and were performed under Texas
Antiquities Permit Nos. 5843 in 2012 and 6248 in
2013 (Atlas 2014). The former was performed by
CAR-UTSA and information on the Atlas is limited
for such, while the latter was conducted by
GeoMarine, Inc. and involved archaeological
monitoring during the demolition of the City of San
Antonio Police Headquarters Complex (Atlas
2014).

A review of the TxDOT historic overlay maps from
1767–1912 determined that three historic-age
resources are within or adjacent to the project area
(Foster et al. 2006). In addition, a review of
Sanborn Fire Insurance maps from 1885–1904
revealed other historic-age resources within the
project area.
TXDOT HISTORIC OVERLAY
The 1767 map by José Urrutia depicts the project
area among agricultural fields northwest of Military

6

Plaza and along an acequia (Foster et al. 2006).
Besides this map, no others that were reviewed
indicated a nearby acequia, so this may be a
consequence of an error in scale, the mislabeling of
San Pedro Creek, or an inaccurate geo-referencing
of this historic map. The 1836 Siege of the Alamo
map depicts the project area in a clump of trees at
the edge of town and near a cemetery (present-day
Milam Square). A rampart for cannons is north of
Houston Street, near its intersection with Main
Street, and about two blocks east-northeast of the
project area (Foster et al. 2006).

depicted in the area of the proposed CPS Energy
excavations that correlate with the location of a
manhole midway along North Laredo Street. The
remainder of the block contains a billiard hall and
sitting room along North Laredo Street, a wool
hides and grain warehouse, a second-hand store, a
feed store, and a grocery, all fronting West
Commerce Street.
The gas plant is labeled as the San Antonio Gas and
Electric Light Company in the 1888 Sanborn map
(Sheet 8; see Figure 5). Accordingly, the factory has
expanded to include six dynamos and a testing
room in an electric light station. The coal shed has
a few small additions to it, but the rest of the plant
remains the same as it was in 1885. A tenement
building is now depicted within a tract that has
since been platted mid-block, and it appears to be
adjacent to the proposed CPS Energy excavations.
Commercial development along West Commerce
Street has intensified.

The 1868 map of San Antonio reveals that Camaron
Street was once called Calabus Street, Houston
Street was Rivas Street, and Commerce Street was
known as Presidio Street (Foster et al. 2006). The
1869 Mauermann map of San Antonio also includes
this nomenclature, although Calabus Street has
become Camaron Street, along with depictions of a
Masonic building in the southeast quadrant of the
intersection of present-day West Houston and
North Laredo Streets (seemingly in the locale of the
theater), and a cigarette factory near the middle of
North Laredo Street between West Houston and
West Commerce Streets, which is the approximate
locale of proposed CPS Energy excavations (Figure
3; Foster et al. 2006). Neither of these structures
appears on the 1883 C. P. Smith map, which instead
depicts a gas factory southwest of the intersection
of San Pedro Creek and Houston Street (Figure 4;
Foster et al. 2006). The 1887 J. D. Rullmann and
the 1889 J. J. Olsen maps do not provide any details
of the project area, but the 1912 San Antonio
Officials map include it within an area labeled
“Laredito,” or “Little Laredo” (Foster et al. 2006).
Later maps were consulted but did not reveal any
additional information.

The gas company is unchanged in the 1892 Sanborn
map (Sheet 6; see Figure 5); however, a two-story
house has been built to the west of the tenement
building, fronting North Laredo Street. This house
also appears to be adjacent to the proposed CPS
Energy excavations. More details of the gas factory
are included in the 1896 Sanborn map (Sheet 10),
but its footprint remains the same, whereas, the
two-story house has been converted to a rooming
house and the tenement building has been divided
into four “Mexican Dwellings” (see Figure 5).
Commercial development along West Commerce
Street continues to intensify. Finally, the 1904
Sanborn map (Volume 1, Sheet 3) contains much of
the same information, although the gas factory’s
coal shed has shrunk by half and underground oil
tanks have been added in its place.

SANBORN FIRE INSURANCE MAPS
The 1885 Sanborn Fire Insurance map (Sheet 8;
Figure 5) includes details of the San Antonio Gas
Company, which spanned the 1000 block of
Houston Street from Laredo Street to San Pedro
Creek. In addition to two gas holding tanks and the
factory itself, the company grounds occupied the
northern third of the block and included a two-story
residence, a large coal shed, and a series of five
smaller buildings along San Pedro Creek that
housed an office and a fitting shop. Nothing is

SAN ANTONIO GAS AND ELECTRIC LIGHT
COMPANY

RESULTS OF A LIMITED SUBSURFACE
ASSESSMENT

Entrepreneur S. R. Dickson began manufacturing
and distributing gas from the San Antonio Gas
Company on Houston Street about 1860 (CPS
Energy 2013). However, in less than a decade
electric lights began to replace the gas lamps and
Dickson adapted by repurposing and renaming his
factory the San Antonio Gas and Electric Light
Company. By 1917, Dickson and his many
competitors were integrated into the San Antonio
Public Service Company (SAPSCo), which was
owned by the American Light and Traction
Company. In the early 1940s, antitrust law
violations forced the American Light and Traction
Company to sell many of its utility holdings across
the country, including SAPSCo, which was
purchased by the City of San Antonio in 1942 for
$34 million and became the City Public Service
Board of San Antonio (present-day CPS Energy).

RKEI conducted a Limited Subsurface Assessment
(LSA) in 2012 that included the collection of five
groundwater samples and two soil samples from
exploratory borings. The groundwater samples
contained volatiles, semi-volatiles, or inorganic
contaminants. The soil also contained semivolatiles, inorganic contaminants, pesticides,
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and coal residue
between 5 to 12 feet below the surface. In one soil
boring (not specified in the report), wood and nails
were noted between 2 to 8 feet below the surface.

RESULTS OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL
MONITORING
SWCA archaeologists conducted cultural resources
monitoring for the CPS Energy Alameda Theater
Annex Duct Bank and Vault Project on an asneeded basis in August 2013 and May 2014 through
July 2014. The archaeological monitoring occurred
during periods of project-related, ground-disturbing
construction activities. The investigations consisted
of monitoring all trenching and drilling activities
associated with the installation of a 4-unit, prefabricated vault and primary duct bank, and an
associated secondary duct bank for the CPS Energy
project. Specifically, monitored excavations
included those associated with the vault and
primary duct bank area, a long trench extending
west to east from the vault across the tract for a
secondary duct bank, as well as three associated tiein connectivity trenches extending from the eastern
margin, southeastern margin, and southwestern
corner of the vault and primary duct bank area
(Figure 7).

HISTORIC AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY
Nine historic aerial photographs from 1938 to 2012
were consulted for the project area. The earliest one
depicts a blank lot where the theater would be built
in 1942 (Figure 6). No remnant of the former gas
factory is visible. An east to west oriented building
is in the middle of the block, but tree cover obscures
its western end making it impossible to determine
whether the building extends to North Laredo
Street. If it does not, it would appear to be the same
tenement building that was first depicted on the
1888 Sanborn map. In 1959, the theater is evident,
as is tree cover and the same building that was
visible in the 1938 photograph. The 1966 aerial
photograph contains the same information, but by
1977, the modern theater complex layout with a
building at the southwest corner, asphalt-covered
parking lots, and no vegetation had been
established. The 1985, 1995, 2004, 2008, and 2012
aerials continue to depict the same layout.

The project area is within a highly urbanized area
and heavily disturbed by historic and modern urban
development including prior vegetation clearing,
road construction, the erection and demolition of
buildings, asphalt-covered parking lots, and utility
installations. As mentioned, an LSA determined
that soils of the project area are contaminated with
semi-volatiles, inorganic contaminants, pesticides,
PCBs, and coal residue (RKEI 2012).
Consequently, additional safety measures were
employed during construction activities such as
using rubber gloves when handling soils and
donning dust masks while observing excavations.

west towards, and just short of, North Laredo
Street. The archaeological monitoring was
performed on August 12, 13, 15, 19, and 20, 2013.
The fill from the trench appeared extensively
disturbed from previous pipe installation in the
area. Stratigraphic layers encountered consisted of
pale brown (10YR6/3), gravelly, sandy clay loam
mixed with light gray (10YR7/1) sandy loam, and
underlain by very dark, grayish brown (10YR3/2)
clay (Figure 8). The soils at the bottom of the trench
consisted of black (10YR2/1) clay. Materials
encountered included asphalt, gravels, concrete,
mortar, some brick fragments, steel and metal
fragments, cable, wood, plastic and other debris
observed in the trench walls and fill. A large
unidentifiable metal fragment in proximity to a
large piece of plywood—indicating the location of
the existing installed pipe—was observed at
approximately 3.66 m (12 feet) below surface. At
approximately 4.27 m (14 feet) deep, groundwater
seepage appeared in the trench (Figure 9). No
significant cultural materials or features were
encountered during the secondary duct bank
excavations.

Mechanical excavations were used for the most part
during the construction-related excavations,
although jack hammers and hand excavations
occurred in sections where extremely dense buried
utilities were encountered. The archaeologists
monitored the construction activities from near the
edge of the excavation, frequently assessing both
the excavation profiles and spoils for cultural
remains. Special attention was paid to the horizons
of disturbance and development directly atop the
native clay soil, usually found approximately 1 to 3
m (3.28–9.84 feet) below the surface. At times, the
exact termination of the layers could not be
determined as the depth of the excavations
prevented the archaeologist from safely entering the
trench, though backdirt from these layers at lower
depths was examined. Throughout the construction
process, delays in progress occurred due to
inclement weather, pumping water out, mechanical
failures, and the limited availability of dump trucks
to handle the fill and the removal of soil—due to
the contaminated nature of the soil, no excavations
could occur without the presence of dump trucks on
site.

AUGUST 2013 MONITORING
Ground-disturbing
construction
activities
triggering the need for cultural resources
monitoring commenced on August 12, 2013. The
construction activities began with the excavation of
a long backhoe trench approximately 32.77 m
(107.5 feet) long, 1.52 to 1.83 m (5–6 feet) wide,
and 4.42 m (14.5 feet) deep extending west to east
from the vault across the tract for the installation of
the secondary duct bank (see Figure 7). The area
extended from the new slab with ironworks due

Shoring with steel plates was used, and as the
installation was completed section by section the
trench was filled with concrete. Once the trench
was completed, the foreman and superintendent
informed the archaeologist that the proposed
location for the vault and primary duct bank would
need to be adjusted and moved.

MAY 2014 MONITORING
The cultural resources monitoring resumed during
construction-related, ground-disturbing activities
for the installation of the vault and primary duct
bank area (approximately 12.80 m [46 feet] long,
6.71 m [22 feet] wide, and 5.49 m [18 feet] deep.)
The rectangular-shaped area is oriented north to
south along and within North Laredo Street (see
Figure 7). The archaeological monitoring was
performed on May 6–8, 13–15, 21–23, and 27–29,
2014.

Figure 9. Groundwater water seepage at
approximately 4.27 m (14 feet) within the
secondary duct bank trench, facing west.

Initially two exploratory test trenches were
excavated along the western edge (northwest corner
and southwest corner) of the vault and primary duct
bank area to locate existing underground utilities,
specifically gas lines (Figure 10). The trench along
the northwest corner was approximately 7.62 m (25
feet) long, 0.91 m (3 feet) wide, and 0.91 m (3 feet)
deep. The trench along the southwest corner was
roughly 1.52 m (5 feet) long, 0.91 m (3 feet) wide,
and 0.91 m (3 feet) deep. The excavation of these
two trenches was not monitored as they were
entirely within construction fill associated with the
two gas lines that were relocated. However, the
archaeologist was able to assess the trenches before
they were filled with concrete.
Subsequent to the two exploratory test trenches, the
Alameda Theater project proceeded with the
excavation of the vault and primary duct bank area
(Figure 11). The excavations commenced with a
trench approximately 0.61 m (2 feet) wide and 2.44
to 3.05 m (8–10 feet) deep along the perimeter of
the vault and primary duct bank area. The eastern
edge of the vault and primary duct bank area was
excavated first, followed by the western edge. The
western edge had not been completed when
excavation commenced on the southern edge, and
excavation activities switched back and forth
between the two. The northern edge was excavated

last. As each section was completed it was filled
with concrete.
The stratigraphy observed during the excavations
along the western and northern edge trenches
consisted of concrete and asphalt from 0 to 30.48
centimeters (cm) (0–1 foot) below surface,
followed by construction fill with abundant modern
construction material and trash from 30.48 to
121.92 cm (1–4 feet) below surface. The above
layers were underlain by yellow (10YR7/6) clay
loam with 50 percent rounded cobbles and gravels
as well as caliche from 121.92.44 to 243.84 cm (4–
8 feet) below surface followed by white (10YR8/1)
clay mottled with light gray (10YR7/1) and
brownish yellow (10YR6/8) up to approximately
304.80 cm (10 feet) below surface (Figure 12).

Figure 11. Overview of vault and primary duct
bank project area, facing southeast.

A red brick with gray mortar feature, possibly a
footing or foundation, was encountered along the
west wall profile of the western edge trench
approximately 3.66 m (12 feet) north from the
southwest corner of the vault and primary duct bank
area (see Figure 7). Although not fully exposed, the
brick feature was observed at approximately 60.96
cm (2 feet) below surface and measured roughly
1.22 m (4 feet) wide by 2.44 m (8 feet) deep (Figure
13). The feature is at the bottom of an existing CPS
Energy concrete conduit and, per one of the
contractors, it is probably an old manhole.
Additionally, a clay pipe was observed in the west
wall profile of the western trench approximately
0.61 m (2 feet) north from the southwest corner of
the vault and primary duct bank area. It was
encountered at approximately 152.40 cm (5 feet)
below surface. Excavations at the northern edge
trench encountered the elbow bend of a 6-inch iron
pipe at approximately 91.44 cm (3 feet) below
surface at the northwest corner of the vault and
primary duct bank area.

trench.

profile of the western edge trench.

The stratigraphy observed during the excavations
along the eastern and southern edge trenches
consisted of concrete and asphalt from the surface
to 30.48 cm (1 foot) below surface followed by very
dark, grayish brown (10YR3/2) clay loam with 10
to 20 percent gravels from 30.48 to 121.92 cm (1–
4 feet) below surface. The above layers were
underlain by yellow (10YR7/6) silty clay loam with
50 percent rounded cobbles and gravel from 121.92
to 213.36 cm (4–7 feet) below surface, decreasing
to 20 percent rounded cobbles and gravel inclusions
from 213.36 cm (7 feet) to 243.84 cm (8 feet) below
surface (Figure 14).

Once the perimeter trench was completed and filled
with concrete, 14 auger holes (AH 1–AH 14)
approximately 30 cm in diameter were excavated
immediately within the perimeter trench margin
(see Figure 7). All of the auger holes exhibited the
same uniform soil profile consisting of light
brownish gray (10YR6/2) sand/concrete fill from
the surface to 243.84 cm (8 feet) below surface,
followed by light reddish brown (2.5YR7/3) clay
loam with rounded gravels and caliche from 243.84
to 457.20 cm (8–15 feet) below surface. These
layers were underlain by brownish yellow
(10YR6/8) to light gray (2.5Y7/2) clay from 457.20
to 762.00 cm (15–25 feet) below surface, which
was in turn atop yellow to gray angular clay from
762.00 to 1066.80 cm (25–35 feet) below surface.
The exception to this was a 30.48 cm (1 foot) thick
lens of red clay in AH 5 at approximately 853.44 to
975.36 cm (28–32 feet) below surface. The red
brick feature observed in the western edge trench
profile was encountered in the AH 3 profile with
only a few small brick fragments pushed out of the
hole (Figure 15). All auger holes were set with Ibeams and filled with gravel after they were
completed.

Within the eastern edge trench, two pipes were
observed approximately midway along the vault
and primary duct bank margin, one was a 3-inchdiameter conduit pipe at approximately 30.48 cm (1
foot) below surface and the another was a 1-inchdiameter PVC pipe at approximately 182.88 cm (6
feet) below surface. The southern edge trench
encountered a steel pipe with a concrete footing
roughly midway along the south wall profile at
approximately 91.44 cm (3 feet) below surface. In
addition, a 1-inch-diameter PVC pipe extending
from the southwest corner of the vault and primary
duct bank area was observed in the southern edge
trench at approximately 30.48 cm (1 foot) below
surface.

Following the auger holes, the perimeter trench was
re-excavated for anchoring the I-beams and then
filled with gravel. The central portion of the vault
and primary duct bank area was then excavated in
sections progressing from the southern to the
northern edge of the area until reaching the intended
depth of 5.49 m (18 feet) (Figure 16). The profile of
the excavations was reinforced as appropriate with
I-beams and steel shoring plates along the edges.
The soils were consistent with those already
encountered throughout the construction process,
exhibiting extensive disturbances and a high
volume of construction debris. Other materials
noted during the construction excavations include a
few clay pipe fragments at 60.96 cm (2 feet) below
surface and fragmentary wood beams at 152.40 cm
(5 feet) below surface in the northeast portion. Once
the vault and primary duct bank area was
completed, it was sealed with concrete, leaving a
roughly central duct opening (Figure 17). No
significant cultural materials or features were
encountered during these vault and primary duct
bank area excavations.

central portion of the vault and primary duct bank
area, facing north/northeast.

JUNE TO JULY 2014 MONITORING
Archaeological monitoring was performed on June
26 and July 7–9, 11 and 14, 2014, in response to
continued ground-disturbing construction activities
for the Alameda Theater project. The monitored
excavations included three associated tie-in
connectivity trenches extending from the eastern
margin, southeastern margin, and southwestern
corner of the vault and primary duct bank area.

Figure 17. Overview of finished vault and primary
duct bank area, facing southwest.

On June 26, 2014, the archaeologist monitored
excavations for the tie-in connectivity trench
extending due east from roughly midway along the
eastern margin of the vault and primary duct bank
margin (see Figure 7). The trench measured
approximately 2.44 to 2.74 m (8–9 feet) long, 1.52
m (5 feet) wide, and 4.42 to 4.57 m (14.5–15 feet)
deep. The purpose of the trench was to tie-in the
vault and primary duct bank area with existing
utilities buried approximately 2.44 m (8 feet) deep
(Figure 18). The excavations encountered the same
soil stratigraphy as in the southeast portion of the
vault and primary duct bank area.
Figure 18. Overview of excavations within the
eastern connectivity trench, facing east.

The foreman and superintendent informed the
archaeologist that excavation of a tie-in to the
manhole approximately 1.52 to 1.83 m (5–6 feet)
west of the northwest corner of the vault area would
occur the following week. However, since the
construction activities occurred in entirely
disturbed fill associated with roughly three to four
utilities buried approximately 1.37 m (4 feet) deep,
archaeological monitoring was deemed not
necessary at this location.

buried utilities in the area, as well as the recent vault
construction.
The final connectivity trench was excavated along
the southeastern margin of the vault and primary
duct bank area to create a tie-in with the secondary
duct bank (see Figure 7). The trench measured
about 2.0 m (6.56 feet) long, 2.0 m (6.56 feet) wide,
and 2.90 m (9.5 feet) deep. The northern half of the
trench was entirely within fill from the previous
vault construction activities in the area. The
southern half consisted of new excavation and
encountered Houston black clay mixed with
yellowish brown sandy fill and gravel that
increased in density with depth (Figure 20). Again,
the soils within the trench were extensively
disturbed and mottled.

Cultural resources investigations resumed in July
2014 with the excavation of another tie-in
connectivity trench extending from the southwest
corner of the vault and primary duct bank area to
the sidewalk on the opposite side of North Laredo
Street (see Figure 7). The trench extends from the
southwest corner of the vault area at a 45 degree
angle before turning near the middle of the street
and continuing to a manhole in the sidewalk of a
bank building on the opposite side of the street from
the theater. The trench was about 10.67 to 13.72 m
(35–45 feet) long, 0.91 m (3 feet) wide, and ranged
from 2.06 to 3.96 m (6.75–13 feet) in depth, sloping
upwards from the deepest excavations in the eastern
third, towards the shallowest in the western third.
The central third contained a substantially higher
volume of buried utilities compared to the eastern
and western thirds, which had to be bypassed by
tunneling under with the use of a jack hammer and
hand excavations.

The profiles of the excavations were shored as
appropriate with I-beams and steel shoring plates,
and filled with concrete upon completion. No
significant cultural materials or features were
encountered during investigations at the associated
tie-in connectivity trench excavations.

The eastern third of the trench was entirely within
light yellowish brown sandy fill from the vault
construction activities. The central third
encountered fill mixed with gravel, caliche, and
Houston black clay in the upper layers. However,
beneath the utilities, light yellowish brown, sandy
fill with numerous gravels, 40 to 50 percent calcium
carbonate nodules mixed with pockets of darker
matrix, and white cement fill was encountered. A
yellowish brown gravelly fill mixed with small
areas of Houston black clay was observed in the
western third of the trench (Figure 19).
Groundwater seepage was evident at approximately
2.90 m (9.5 feet). Materials observed consisted of
brick fragments mixed with fill that were neither
intact nor in situ; the brick fragments do not appear
to be associated with an intact feature. The soils
throughout the trench were extensively disturbed
and mottled as a consequence of the high density of

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On behalf of CPS Energy, SWCA conducted
archival background research and cultural
resources monitoring for the CPS Energy Alameda
Theater Annex Duct Bank and Vault Project in
Bexar County, Texas. The project area is within the
existing ROW of North Laredo Street and an
adjacent parking lot in the southwestern corner of
the Alameda Theater complex, approximately 250
feet south of the street’s intersection with West
Houston Street.
The background review determined that the project
area has been previously surveyed at a
reconnaissance level and that no previously
recorded archaeological sites are within or adjacent
to the project area. Within a 0.25-mile radius of the
project area are 11 cultural resources investigations,
15 previously recorded archaeological sites, the
Main and Military Plazas NRHP Historic District,
eight properties that are listed on the NRHP, 14
OTHMs, and 126 local neighborhood surveys
including one for the Alameda Theater (Atlas
2014).

Figure 20. Overview of stratigraphy within the
southeastern connectivity trench, facing east.

Overall, the construction monitoring revealed
evidence of recent disturbances consisting of
modern utilities and construction material within
the project area. All of the monitored excavations
were within extensively disturbed deposits
predominantly dating to the twentieth century. In
general, no definitive evidence suggested by
artifacts or features were observed in the project
area that could be associated with the Spanish
Colonial-era or nineteenth-century occupations.
The materials were from disturbed contexts and
likely date to the mid-to-late twentieth century. The
construction debris could possibly correspond with
the former residence and tenement building
identified adjacent to the project area on the
Sanborn maps; however, repeated cycles of historic
construction and demolition have likely
compromised to an unknown degree the integrity of
any historic resources. No significant cultural
materials or features were encountered during the
investigations. All excavations were filled in with
concrete.

The work performed by SWCA included historical
and archival research followed by intensive
archaeological construction monitoring in an effort
to identify, record, and characterize any extant
historic resources or deposits within the project
area. The focus of the study was the Spanish
Colonial period through the nineteenth century.
SWCA’s intensive archaeological monitoring was
performed during ground-disturbing construction
activities that occurred on an as-needed basis in
August 2013 and May 2014 through July 2014. The
goal of the work was to examine and assess cultural
deposits revealed in the construction, adequately
document the cultural resources, and provide
sufficient information to make determinations on
age and significance. All work was done in
accordance with the standards and guidelines of the
THC and the CTA. Work was conducted under
Texas Antiquities Permit No. 6596.
Monitored excavations consisted of the vault and
primary duct bank area, a long trench extending
west to east from the vault across the tract for the
secondary duct bank, as well as three associated tie-

20

in connectivity trenches extending from the eastern
margin, southeastern margin, and southwestern
corner of the vault and primary duct bank area.
Overall, no definitive evidence suggested by
artifacts or features was observed in the project area
that could be associated with the Spanish Colonial
era or the nineteenth century. All of the monitored
construction-related excavations were within
extensively disturbed deposits, predominantly
dating to the twentieth century, including modern
utilities and construction material.
SWCA made a reasonable and good faith effort to
identify historic properties within the project area.
Based on the results of the monitoring efforts, the
excavations within the Alameda Theater Annex
Duct Bank and Vault project area had no effect on
significant cultural properties and no further
archaeological work is recommended.
