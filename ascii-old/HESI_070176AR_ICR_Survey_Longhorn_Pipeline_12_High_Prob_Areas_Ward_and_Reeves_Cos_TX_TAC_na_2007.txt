MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

During the month of November 2007, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon)
conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of 12 archeological high-probability areas
(AHPAs) delineated within 42.0 miles (67.2 kilometers [km]) of proposed extra work spaces
along the Longhorn Partners Pipeline, L.P. (Longhorn) pipeline right-of-way (ROW) in Ward and
Reeves counties, Texas. Due to anomalies within the pipe, the need has arisen for Longhorn to
replace roughly 42.0 miles (67.2 km) of the pipeline with new pipe between Longhorn mileposts
(MPs) 487.0 and 529.0. To facilitate this, approximately 50.0 feet (ft) (15.3 meters [m]) of extra
work space along each side of the existing ROW is necessary to allow for pipe-stringing and
vehicular/equipment traffic. In addition, approximately 200.0 ft (61.2 m) of extra work spaces
along each side of the existing ROW where it crosses the Pecos River are necessary to
accommodate a horizontal directional drill (HDD) under the river. All extra work spaces along
the 42.0-mile (67.2 km) section of pipeline are located on privately held lands. At the request of
Longhorn, Horizon conducted the cultural resources survey of the 12 delineated AHPAs within
the proposed extra work spaces in compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. The purpose of the survey was to determine if
any archeological sites were present within the AHPAs and, if so, to determine their eligibility for
inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The assessed areas within the 12
AHPAs totaled approximately 182.3 acres.
The intensive cultural resources survey of the 12 AHPAs resulted in the documentation
of no archeological sites within the assessed areas. One solitary quartzite projectile point
fragment was found within AHPA WT-6. However, no additional cultural materials were found in
the vicinity of this projectile point, and as such, it was considered to be an isolated find and was
not recorded as an archeological site. The landowner of the parcel where the projectile point
was found informed the field crew that he was aware of a large, unrecorded prehistoric
encampment on a hill a short distance away, outside of the existing ROW and assessed extra
work spaces. The isolated projectile point is likely associated with this unrecorded site. As this
unrecorded site is located on private property beyond the limits of the Longhorn ROW and extra
work spaces, it will not be impacted by pipeline activities and was not formally documented by
field crew.
Aside from the 1 isolated projectile point, no other cultural resources were documented
at any location within the 12 assessed AHPAs. Based on these negative results, it is Horizon’s
opinion that the utilization of the 42.0 miles (67.2 km) of extra work spaces in Ward and Reeves

counties will have no impact on significant cultural resources and that no further investigations
are warranted. Horizon therefore recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted for
the entire 42.0 miles (67.2 km) of proposed extra work spaces. However, in the unlikely event
that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently
discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the ROW and extra
work spaces, even in previously surveyed areas, all work should cease immediately and the
Texas Historical Commission (THC) should be notified of the discovery.

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of 12 Archeological High-Probability Areas along 42 Miles of
Extra Work Spaces on the Longhorn Partners Pipeline Right-of-Way, Ward and Reeves Counties, Texas

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of an intensive cultural resources survey of 12
archeological high-probability areas (AHPAs) delineated within 42.0 miles (67.2 kilometers [km])
of proposed extra work spaces along the Longhorn Partners Pipeline, L.P. (Longhorn) pipeline
right-of-way (ROW) in Ward and Reeves counties, Texas. Due to anomalies within the pipe, the
need has arisen for Longhorn to replace roughly 42.0 miles (67.2 km) of the pipeline with new
pipe between Longhorn mileposts (MPs) 487.0 and 529.0. To facilitate this, approximately 50.0
feet (ft) (15.3 meters [m]) of extra work space along each side of the existing ROW is necessary
to allow for pipe-stringing and vehicular/equipment traffic. In addition, approximately 200.0 ft
(61.2m) of extra work spaces along each side of the existing ROW where it crosses the Pecos
River are necessary to accommodate a horizontal directional drill (HDD) under the river. All
extra work spaces along the 42.0-mile (67.2 km) section of pipeline are located on privately held
lands. At the request of Longhorn, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted
the cultural resources survey of the 12 delineated AHPAs within the proposed extra work
spaces in compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of
1966, as amended. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any archeological sites were
present within the AHPAs and, if so, to determine their eligibility for inclusion in the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
The cultural resources investigations consisted of a delineation of the 12 AHPAs, an
intensive pedestrian survey of each of the 12 AHPAs, and the production of a report suitable for
review by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas
Historical Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and
the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management
Reports. Russell Brownlow (Horizon’s Cultural Resources Director) served as the Principal
Investigator for the project. Jared Wiersema and Michael Mudd (Horizon field technicians)
conducted the field investigations during the last week of November 2007.
Horizon delineated the 12 AHPAs along the proposed extra work spaces based on: 1)
distance from water sources; 2) the location of previously recorded archeological sites within or
near the ROW; 3) the locations and results of previous cultural resources surveys along the
ROW; and 4) areas that have experienced considerable prior impacts that would negate the
potential for intact cultural deposits.

Extra Work Spaces on the Longhorn Partners Pipeline Right-of-Way, Ward and Reeves Counties, Texas

The AHPAs reported herein consist of 12 linear areas along the Longhorn ROW that
total 13.4 miles (21.4 km) in length and extend roughly 50.0 ft (15.3 m) beyond each side of the
existing Longhorn ROW (100.0 ft [30.6 m] total width). On opposing banks of the Pecos River,
the extra work spaces extended approximately 200.0 ft (61.2 m) beyond each side of the
existing Longhorn ROW (400.0 ft [122.4 m] total width) to accommodate an HDD under the
river. Overall, the 12 AHPAs total 182.3 acres. The Texas State Minimum Archeological
Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile on linear projects
measuring 100.0 ft (30.5 m) in width. As such, a total 215 shovel tests were necessary to meet
the TSMASS along the 13.4 miles (21.4 km) of AHPAs. Horizon conducted a total of 205 shovel
tests within the 12 AHPAs. The TSMASS were not met due to the fact that the majority of the
assessed areas consisted of areas of shallow rocky soil or exposed bedrock outcrops where the
potential for buried deposits was minimal. However, this afforded excellent ground surface
visibility along the extra work spaces, allowing for a thorough investigation of the areas
assessed.
The intensive cultural resources survey of the 12 AHPAs resulted in the documentation
of no archeological sites within the assessed areas. One solitary quartzite projectile point
fragment was found within AHPA WT-6. However, no additional cultural materials were found in
the vicinity of this projectile point, and as such, it was considered to be an isolated find and was
not recorded as an archeological site. The landowner of the parcel where the projectile point
was found informed the field crew that he was aware of a large, unrecorded prehistoric
encampment on a hill a short distance away, outside of the existing ROW and assessed extra
work spaces. The isolated projectile point is likely associated with this unrecorded site. As this
unrecorded site is located on private property beyond the limits of the Longhorn ROW and extra
work spaces, it will not be impacted by pipeline activities and was not formally documented by
field crew.
Aside from the 1 isolated projectile point, no other cultural resources were documented
at any location within the 12 assessed AHPAs. Based on these negative results, it is Horizon’s
opinion that the utilization of the 42.0 miles (67.2 km) of extra work spaces in Ward and Reeves
counties will have no impact on significant cultural resources and that no further investigations
are warranted. Horizon therefore recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted for
the entire 42.0 miles (67.2 km) of proposed extra work spaces. However, in the unlikely event
that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently
discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the ROW and extra
work spaces, even in previously surveyed areas, all work should cease immediately and the
THC should be notified of the discovery.

2.0 HIGH-PROBABILITY AREAS

The 12 AHPAs along the extra work spaces bordering the pipeline ROW are located in
Ward and Reeves counties, Texas (see Figures 1 and 2). They can be found on the following
US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute topographic quadrangles: Ozark Lake, L 7 Ranch,
China Lake NE, China Lake, Quito Draw, Soda Lake SE, Soda Lake, Pecos East, Pecos West,
and Sand Lake, Texas (see Figure 2). Horizon delineated the 12 AHPAs along the proposed
extra work spaces based on: 1) distance from water sources; 2) the location of previously
recorded archeological sites within or near the ROW; 3) the locations and results of previous
cultural resources surveys along the ROW; and 4) areas that have experienced considerable
prior impacts that would negate the potential for intact cultural deposits.
For purposes of discussion, each AHPA was assigned a sequential identifier beginning
with WT-1 (WT=West Texas) through WT-12. Table 1 below presents each AHPA, followed by
the county in which it is located, Longhorn’s MPs and engineering station numbers (ESNs)
along the ROW where each AHPA begins and ends, and the length of each AHPA. In all, the
12 AHPAs for the extra work spaces total 13.4 miles (21.4 km) in length and extend roughly
50.0 ft (15.3 m) beyond each side of the existing Longhorn ROW (100.0 ft [30.6 m] total width).
On opposing banks of the Pecos River, the extra work spaces extended approximately 200.0 ft
(61.2 m) beyond each side of the existing Longhorn ROW (400.0 ft [122.4 m] total width) to
accommodate an HDD under the river. Overall, the 12 AHPAs total 182.3 acres.
All of the 12 AHPAs are located on privately held lands. Generally speaking, all of the
AHPAs are located in rural areas that can be characterized as rangeland or desert. Typical of
West Texas, terrain within the assessed areas was generally flat to slightly rolling, with hills and
slopes interspersed with various small drainages, larger creeks, and major rivers such as the
Pecos. Although the existing ROW is cleared and maintained, the delineated AHPAs bordering
the ROW were most often covered with short grasses, creosote bushes, various cacti,
tumbleweeds, and other varieties of desert vegetation. Soils encountered along the ROW,
when present, were almost always shallow and cobbly clay loams and cobbly sandy loams
interspersed with exposed sandstone bedrock outcroppings where the potential for deeply
buried cultural deposits was minimal. Due to the considerable length of the survey effort, a
listing of all soils would be too extensive to include here and is generally unwarranted given the
negative results of the survey effort. However, the types of soils present within each of the 12
AHPAs can be seen in Figures 3 through 15.

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The general temporal framework for most prehistoric archeological sites in Texas is
based on the seriation of projectile point types originally established by Suhm, Kreiger, and
Jelks (1954) and later revised by Suhm and Jelks (1962), Prewitt (1981, 1985), and Turner and
Hester (1999). This temporal framework, consisting of a tri-partite system based on
technological changes in diagnostic artifacts that occurred as a result of indigenous adaptation
to changing environments and subsistence strategies, is broken down into 3 main periods: the
PaleoIndian (pre-8500 BP), the Archaic (8500 to 1250 BP), and the Late Prehistoric (1250 to
250 BP). The Archaic period is further subdivided into the Early Archaic (8500 to 6000 BP),
the Middle Archaic (6000 BP to 3500 BP), and the Late Archaic (3500 to 1250 BP). A brief
breakdown of this general sequence is presented below.

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (PRE- 8500 BP)

The PaleoIndian period is characterized by highly mobile groups hunting over large
areas. Although now-extinct megafauna such as mammoth and bison are often found
associated with sites of this time period, smaller game, such as deer and turtles, were also likely
utilized as food items. Undoubtedly, plant foods made up a portion of the diet as well. Based
upon the low number of diagnostic artifacts recovered from sites of this period, as well as the
low frequency of sites, population densities are considered low and probably consisted of small
family groups. An increase in projectile point frequency toward the end of the period may
suggest an increased population density or, perhaps, an increase in macro-band aggregation
for the purpose of communal hunts. Sites from this time period are found mostly in upland
tributary and spring settings, as well as deeply buried in floodplain alluvium. Clovis and Folsom
points are indicative of Early PaleoIndian occupations, while Plainview, Golondrina, Scottsbluff,
Meserve, Eden, Dalton, San Patrice, and Angostura points are characteristic of the later span of
the period.

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 8500 TO 1250 BP)

The Archaic period, which covers two-thirds of Texas prehistory, is divided into 3
subperiods: Early (8500 to 6000 BP), Middle (6000 to 3500 BP), and Late (3500 to 1250 BP).
The beginning of the Archaic period in Texas represents a similar transition found world-wide at
approximately the same time, the most noted indicators being the extinction of Pleistocene
megafauna and climatic changes. In Texas, there was a gradual decrease in moisture and

HJN 070176 AR

17

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

humidity reflecting the intensification of warming and drying trends first noted during the ClovisFolsom transition. An often-quoted response to these climatic changes was a greater and more
varied use of local resources; in actuality, this was already the case in most places. Plantprocessing implements such as manos and metates and earth ovens become more evident in
the archeological record, while the hunting of game continued. Although still nomadic, people of
the Archaic period restricted their travel to smaller areas than did the PaleoIndian groups.

3.3

EARLY ARCHAIC (8500 TO 6000 BP)

Like the PaleoIndian period, Early Archaic population densities remained low, still
consisting of small, mobile bands. However, a more generalized hunting-and-gathering strategy
is evidenced by the use of river mussels. Early Archaic sites are typically located on terraces
along tributary watercourses, but are also often found deeply buried in floodplain alluvium. Site
locale and an increased use of river mussels possibly indicate a shift in subsistence strategies
in order to exploit the bottomlands of major waterways during this period of wetter climates.
Split-stemmed points such as Gower, Martindale, and Uvalde, as well as Big Sandy, Hardin,
and Hoxie, are diagnostic of Early Archaic occupations.

3.4

MIDDLE ARCHAIC (6000 TO 3500 BP)

During the Middle Archaic, the trend toward bottomland exploitation increases, with
fewer sites found along minor tributaries. Population density remained relatively low, but
obviously increased over prior periods, with broad-spectrum hunting and gathering represented
at larger sites where food sources were more abundant.

3.5

LATE ARCHAIC (3500 TO 1250 BP)

In contrast to earlier time periods, the Late Archaic represents a period of increased
population and site density. Subsistence is focused on hunting and gathering within the
bottomlands of major creeks and rivers. Deer remains are quite common at Late Archaic sites,
and the exploitation of plant foods (nuts) seems to have increased during this period, based
upon an increase in plant-processing tools. Late Archaic sites are typically found on sandy
terraces along tributaries, as well as on clayey floodplains.

3.6

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 1250 TO 250 BP)

The Late Prehistoric period, in general, is characterized by the advent of the bow and
arrow, as well as ceramics, in Texas. Hunting and gathering continued with an emphasis on
deer and other small game. Horticulture also became evident in some areas. As in the Late
Archaic, sites continue to be located on sandy terraces along major creeks and rivers. In fact,
the majority of Late Prehistoric sites contain some traces of Late Archaic occupations. A
marked population increase is highly evident, and increased territorial conflicts possibly explain
the recovery of burials with indications of violent deaths. Furthermore, differentiated burial
practices also suggest the development of non-egalitarian societies.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Archival research conducted via the Internet at the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas web site (Atlas) indicated no previously recorded archeological sites within a 0.8-km (0.5mile) perimeter of the 40 miles of ROW where the pipe replacement will occur (THC 2007). The
Barstow Cemetery, located roughly 305 m (1000 ft) north of the ROW near MP 521, was the
only cultural resource present within the review area. No properties currently listed on the
NRHP or designated as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) occur within or immediately
adjacent to the pipeline ROW in the area of the pipe replacement activities.
In general, the few archeological investigations that have taken place in the region (east
of the Pecos River and south of the Llano Estacado) have typically been limited to pipeline preconstruction efforts (e.g., Abbott 1991 and 1992) or been undertaken by avocational
archeologists. The majority of the recorded sites in Ward County and in nearby Winkler County
are the result of surveys in Monahans Sandhills State Park (Cloud and Sanchez 1993, Warren
and Lohse 1994).
Although many of the sites recorded in the region consist of sparse lithic scatters within
sand dune blowout basins, a few notable sites stand out. Site 41WR1 is an open campsite in
Ward County, with sandstone boulders decorated with a variety of petroglyphs of stylized
figures and geometric designs. The Blue Mountain Rockshelter (41WR4) was one of the first
sites to be excavated in the region. Recovered materials ranged in age from PaleoIndian to
Late Prehistoric (Holden 1938). A later re-examination of the Blue Mountain Rockshelter
materials by Collins (1968) resulted in the identification of ceramics from the Jornada Branch of
the Mogollon.
In 1953, an avocational archeologist reported the presence of fossilized human skeletal
material in association with a projectile point at what is now known as the Scharbauer site near
Midland, Texas. Professional investigations at the site revealed the deposits to be of
PaleoIndian age (Wendorf et al. 1955; Wendorf and Krieger 1959).
Based on a
uranium/thorium measurement produced from a skull fragment taken from the site, a date of
11,600 BP was extrapolated (Davis 1993:14).
More recently, Horizon conducted survey level investigations for the initial development
of UNOCAL’s Keystone Gas Storage Project (Brownlow 2002a) and UNOCAL’s Northern
Natural Interconnect (Brownlow 2002b) in nearby Winkler County. These investigations

resulted in the documentation of 25 aboriginal sites (41WK51 through 41WK75). All 25 sites
consisted of relatively sparse aboriginal lithic scatters and open campsites located within blownout sand dune basins. Each site had been heavily picked over by collectors, leaving only
sparse amounts of lithic debitage, ground stone, and occasional burned rock fragments.
However, investigations on site 41WK53 found a potential burned sandstone feature (partial ring
of burned sandstone) and weathered mammal vertebrae (Bos?) eroding from the sandy bottom
of the basin.

Extra Work Spaces on the Longhorn Partners Pipeline Right-of-Way, Ward and Reeves Counties, Texas

5.0 GENERAL METHODOLOGY

Prior to conducting the field investigations, Horizon set out to delineate the 12 AHPAs
along the ROW based on: 1) distance from water sources; 2) the location of previously
recorded archeological sites within or near the ROW, if any; 3) the locations and results of
previous cultural resources surveys along the ROW; and 4) areas that have experienced
considerable prior impacts that would negate the potential for intact cultural deposits. However,
little to no archeological data were available for the immediate vicinity of the pipeline ROW in
this area. As indicated in the previous section, no archeological sites are documented near the
ROW and only 1 previous survey of a bisecting pipeline ROW was noted on the Atlas. As such,
the 12 AHPAs were primarily determined based on their proximity to water sources that would
have attracted the aboriginal inhabitants of the region and topographical settings such as
terraces and ridgelines where aboriginal sites are typically located.
Subsequent to the delineation of the AHPAs, a 2-person Horizon field crew completed
an intensive pedestrian survey of each the 12 AHPAs during the last week of November 2007.
As the extra work spaces consist of 50.0-ft (15.3-m) wide areas on each side of the existing
ROW, the 2 members of the field crew each traversed the width of the extra work space on
opposing sides of the ROW (i.e., 1 person on each side). On the opposing banks of the Pecos
River, the field crew traversed a minimum of 2 transects over the 200.0-ft (61.2-m) wide extra
work spaces on each side of the existing ROW that were needed to accommodate HDD
activities to bore under the river.
The survey of the 12 AHPAs included both intensive surface inspection and subsurface
shovel testing (when possible) along the length of each AHPA. However, in areas where
shallow clay soils or exposed bedrock were present, shovel testing was not conducted. Shovel
tests averaged 30.0 centimeters (cm) (11.7 inches) in diameter, and all excavated soil matrices
were screened through 6-millimeter (mm) (0.25-inch) hardware mesh. The TSMASS require a
minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile on linear projects measuring 100 feet in width. As such, a
total 215 shovel tests were necessary to meet the TSMASS along the 13.4 miles of AHPAs.
Horizon conducted a total of 205 shovel tests within the 12 AHPAs. The TSMASS were not met
due to the fact that the majority of the assessed areas consisted of areas of shallow rocky soil or
exposed bedrock outcrops where the potential for buried deposits was minimal. However, this
afforded excellent ground surface visibility along the extra work spaces, allowing for a thorough
investigation of the areas assessed.

Chapter 5.0: General Methodology

A non-collection strategy was employed during the survey efforts. Any non-diagnostic
cultural materials (e.g., burned rock, lithic debitage, etc.) observed on the surface or within
shovel tests were to be tabulated and described in the field and subsequently returned to where
they were found. Diagnostic cultural materials (e.g., projectile points, charcoal, etc.) were to be
collected for analysis and further documentation.
During the field investigations, field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils,
land forms, shovel tests, cultural material observed (if any), etc. If any new archeological sites
were encountered, standardized site forms were to be completed and submitted to the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) for permanent housing. Standardized shovel test
forms were completed for each excavated shovel test, and digital photographs with a photo log
were also completed as appropriate. Location data were gathered during the survey via
handheld GPS units utilizing the UTM coordinate system and the NAD 27 map datum. As all
shovel tests were basically surficial or extremely shallow in nature, as well as entirely negative,
the resulting shovel test data and locations have not been included in this document.

6.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

The intensive cultural resources survey of the 12 AHPAs resulted in the documentation
of no archeological sites within the assessed areas. One solitary quartzite projectile point
fragment of what appears to be the base of a Langtry dart point was found within AHPA WT-6
(Figures 16 and 17). However, no additional cultural materials were found in the vicinity of this
projectile point, and as such, it was considered to be an isolated find and was not recorded as
an archeological site. The landowner of the parcel where the projectile point was found
informed the field crew that he was aware of a large, unrecorded prehistoric encampment on his
property, located on a hill a short distance away, outside of the existing ROW and assessed
extra work spaces. The isolated projectile point is likely associated with this unrecorded site.
As this unrecorded site is located on private property beyond the limits of the Longhorn ROW
and extra work spaces, it will not be impacted by pipeline activities and was not formally
documented by field crew. Aside from the 1 isolated projectile point, no other cultural resources
were documented at any location within the 12 assessed AHPAs.

7.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

7.1

SUMMARY OF RESULTS

During the last week of November 2007, Horizon conducted an intensive cultural
resources survey of 12 AHPAs delineated within 42.0 miles (67.2 km) of proposed extra work
spaces along the Longhorn pipeline ROW in Ward and Reeves counties, Texas. Due to
anomalies within the pipe, the need has arisen for Longhorn to replace roughly 42.0 miles (67.2
km) of the pipeline with new pipe between MPs 487.0 and 529.0. To facilitate this,
approximately 50.0 ft (15.3 m) of extra work space along each side of the existing ROW is
necessary to allow for pipe-stringing and vehicular/equipment traffic. In addition, approximately
200.0 ft (61.2 m) of extra work spaces along each side of the existing ROW where it crosses the
Pecos River are necessary to accommodate an HDD under the river. All extra work spaces
along the 42.0-mile (67.2 km) section of pipeline are located on privately held lands. At the
request of Longhorn, Horizon conducted the cultural resources survey of the 12 delineated
AHPAs within the proposed extra work spaces in compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA of
1966, as amended. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any archeological sites were
present within the AHPAs and, if so, to determine their eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP. The
assessed areas within the 12 AHPAs totaled approximately 182.3 acres.
The intensive cultural resources survey of the 12 AHPAs resulted in the documentation
of no archeological sites within the assessed areas. One solitary quartzite projectile point
fragment was found within AHPA WT-6. However, no additional cultural materials were found in
the vicinity of this projectile point, and as such, it was considered to be an isolated find and was
not recorded as an archeological site. The landowner of the parcel where the projectile point
was found informed the field crew that he was aware of a large, unrecorded prehistoric
encampment on a hill a short distance away, outside of the existing ROW and assessed extra
work spaces. The isolated projectile point is likely associated with this unrecorded site. As this
unrecorded site is located on private property beyond the limits of the Longhorn ROW and extra
work spaces, it will not be impacted by pipeline activities and was not formally documented by
field crew. Aside from the 1 isolated projectile point, no other cultural resources were
documented at any location within the 12 assessed AHPAs.

7.2

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

A summary of all of Horizon’s findings and recommendations is provided in Table 2.
Based on the negative survey results within the 12 delineated AHPAs, it is Horizon’s opinion
that utilization of the 42.0 miles (67.2 km) of extra work spaces in Ward and Reeves counties
will have no impact on significant cultural resources and that no further investigations are
warranted. Horizon therefore recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted for the
entire 42.0 miles (67.2 km) of proposed extra work spaces. However, in the unlikely event that
any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered
at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the ROW and extra work
spaces, even in previously surveyed areas, all work should cease immediately and the THC
should be notified of the discovery.
