Appendix B: Photographs of Cleaned Profiles Exposed by
Trenches and Profile Cuts along SH 48
Richard A. Weinstein
Included in this appendix are 53 photographs of
the cleaned wall profiles stemming from excavation of the various trenches and profile cuts in
ROW Areas A, B, C, F, and G (Table B-1). Although 55 trenches/profile cuts were excavated,
two of the profile cuts in Area G (G-1 and G-2)
were not photographed. Overall, these photo-

graphs are provided as a supplement to the few
profiles illustrated throughout the body of the text.
It never was the intention to carefully record and
photograph each trench/profile cut. Rather, these
simply offer an idea of the types of stratigraphy
revealed in each of the lomas examined during the
survey.
