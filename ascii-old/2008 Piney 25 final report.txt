This report documents a cultural resource inventory at Lake Whitney in Bosque, Hill and Johnson Counties, Texas
conducted for the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District (USACE) in compliance with Section 110 of
the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 as amended. The inventory examined 555 acres of USACE property and
included 374 shovel tests plus six controlled test excavation units. Archival research was also conducted on historic
sites Archeological fieldwork was conducted November 13-20 and December 10-16, 2007. Recovered artifacts included
historic ceramics, metal, and glass, and prehistoric lithics, tools, bone, and charcoal. All subsurface artifacts were
recovered and will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory. .
The inventory discovered and recorded six archeological sites. Sites 41HI297, 41HI298, and 41BQ290 are the remains
mid-19th to mid-20th century homesteads and are recommended as not eligible for nomination to the NRHP. Sites
41HI296 and 41BQ291 are the remains of 19th century homesteads. These sites may have potential to inform on early
farming and settlement in the region but at the present time their NRHP eligibility is uncertain. Site 41JN59 is a
prehistoric open campsite with high potential for further archeological research and is recommended as eligible for
nomination to the NRHP under Criterion D

ABSTRACT
This report documents the substantive findings and management recommendations of a cultural
resource inventory conducted at Lake Whitney in Bosque, Hill and Johnson Counties, Texas.
Work was conducted at the request of the Piney Woods Project Office of the United States Army
Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District (USACE). In compliance with Section 110 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 as amended through 1992 (P.L. 89-665 et
seq.), the inventories were completed in order to identify and document historic properties on
selected USACE properties.
The inventory examined 555 acres of USACE property located within four separate parcels in
proximity to Lake Whitney. The pedestrian survey was accompanied by 374 shovel tests. In
addition, archeologists excavated six controlled test excavations on selected sites to obtain
additional information on site integrity and content. Archeological fieldwork was conducted in
two sessions on November 13-20, 2007 and December 10-16, 2007. Recovered artifacts included
historic ceramics, metal, and glass, and prehistoric lithics, tools, bone, and charcoal. All
subsurface artifacts were recovered and will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL). Archival research was also conducted on historic sites.
The inventory discovered and recorded six archeological sites.
Sites 41HI297, 41HI298, and 41BQ290 are the remains of mid-nineteenth to mid-twentieth
century homesteads. No intact cultural deposits were encountered during shovel testing on any of
these sites and none of them have significant research value. These three sites are recommended
as not eligible for nomination to the NRHP and no further management is warranted.
Sites 41HI296 and 41BQ291 are the remains of nineteenth century homesteads. The sites
represent early farmsteads in a region that was very sparsely inhabited until the 1880s and
abundant artifacts demonstrate a continuum of site occupation. With further archival study and
archeological field research, these sites may be determined to have potential to inform studies of
early farming and settlement in the region. At the present time, however, their NRHP eligibility
is uncertain and both sites should be avoided, preserved, and protected until further investigation
can clearly evaluate their NRHP eligibility.
Site 41JN59 is a prehistoric open campsite with a burned rock feature and two stratigraphic
components. Diagnostic artifacts suggest that the lower component was occupied between 1650
and 150 BC. Multiple data sets are available and are contained within intact buried deposits of
high integrity. The site has high potential for further archeological research; it is recommended
as eligible for nomination to the NRHP under Criterion D and should be avoided, preserved, and
protected.

1.0 PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The United States Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District (USACE) is responsible
for managing certain federally owned lands in Texas in association with lakes, reservoirs
and navigable waterways. These management responsibilities include 23,560 acres at
Lake Whitney. In compliance with Section 110 of the National Historic Preservation Act
(NHPA) of 1966 as amended through 1992 (P.L. 89-665 et seq.), the current investigation
was authorized by the USACE to identify any archeological sites, buildings, structures, or
other resources that may be eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP).
The cultural resource inventory was conducted on 555 acres of USACE property located
within four inventory parcels in proximity to Lake Whitney. The pedestrian survey was
accompanied by 374 shovel tests. In addition, the USACE requested that EComm
excavate up to four cubic meters on selected sites recorded during the inventory whose
NRHP eligibility potential could not be accessed using the limited survey data alone.
1.1

LOCATION

The project area consists of four separate parcels totaling 555 acres at Lake Whitney in
Bosque, Hill, and Johnson Counties (Table 1-1, Figure 1-1). Lake Whitney is on the
Brazos Rivers approximately 30 miles northwest of Waco in Bosque, Hill, and Johnson
Counties. Dam and lake construction began in 1947 primarily for power and floodcontrol and was finished in 1951. Elevation of the conservation pool typically varies
seasonally; normal elevations are 533 feet above mean sea level (AMSL) with a record
high of 570 AMSL recorded on 5/29/1957 and a record low of 509 AMSL recorded on
11/1/1956. Flood storage capacity is 571 ft. AMSL.

1.2

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT

The project area is located within the central Brazos River valley on USACE property in
proximity to the Brazos River and its tributaries in areas that feature wide topographic
relief and diverse vegetation communities. This area is listed as being within the Grand
Prairie natural region which is a sub-region of the Blackland Prairie (Diggs et al. 1999).
The Grand Prairie occupies approximately 6.5 million acres of land that extends from the
Red River to Waco and is bounded by the Lampasas Cut Plain and East and West Cross
Timbers natural regions. This area is also commonly referred to as the Cross Timbers and
Prairies eco-region as defined by Gould et al. (1969).
Prior to the nineteenth century, the Grand Prairie was described by early travelers and
frontiersman as being a vast grassland with timber primarily occurring along
watercourses, mottes, hilltops, mesas, and buttes. In 1845, while traveling on an
expedition from Texas to Santa Fe, New Mexico, G.W. Kendall stopped at the middle
Brazos River valley where it intersects the Lampasas Cut Plain and described the region
as follows.
âThe valley of the Brazos at this place is abounded with every species of
timber known in Texas; grapes, plumes, and other fruits were found in great
profusion; honey could be obtained in almost every hollow tree; trout and
other small fish were plentiful in the small creeks in the neighborhoods, and
the woods and prairies about us not only afforded excellent grazing for our
cattle and horses, but teemed with every species of game-elk, deer, bear, wild
turkeys, and, at the proper season, buffalo and mustang.â (Kendall 1845).

Based on early historical accounts and a study on relic climate vegetation by Dyksterhuis
(1946) one plant, little bluestem (Schizachyrum Scoparius), was found to comprise over
two-thirds of the total historic vegetation on the prairies followed by side-oatsgramma
(Bouteloua curtipendula), Indian grass (Sorghastrum nutans), tall dropseed (Sporobolus
compositus), hairy grama (Bouteloua hirsute), and big bluestem (Andropogen gerardii).
Interestingly, no evidence of trees was found in the data (Dyksterhus 1946). The absence
of trees on the prairies is best explained by the frequent wildfires that impacted the region
in historic times which prevented larger plant species such as trees from getting
established. The wildfires also added important nutrients to the soil which facilitated the
density and fast growth of grass species. These fires were caused by either lightning
strikes or were intentionally set by Indian tribes as a means to alter the ecosystem for
such uses as hunting, crop management, fireproofing areas, collecting insects, managing
pests, fighting wars and sending signals, extorting goods from other people, clearing
areas for travel, felling trees, and clearing riparian areas (de Vaca and Bandelier 1905;
Fehrenbach 1968:23; Joutel and Foster 1998; Williams 2004). Also, during the mid to
late nineteenth centuries both the U.S. Army and Indians commonly used fires as a
defensive tactic during conflicts (Clary 1978).
After settlement in the mid-nineteenth century the prairies eventually became subdivided
and fenced to mark property boundaries and facilitate ranching. The new settlers did not
intensely utilize fire on the prairies but instead only used it to clear areas prior to
development or to add nutrients to soils for farming. Accordingly, this promoted the
growth of other woody plant species in the region including some that would later be
classified as nuisance species.
Even though the project area is located within the Grand Prairie natural region, modern
vegetation in the project area is classified as being within the Lampasas Cut Plain
vegetational area of North Central Texas (Diggs et al. 1999). The modern vegetation
within the area is more variable than other areas due to its great topographic diversity.
For example, the eastern portion of this area has deep soils with tall grass prairie
vegetation similar to the Blackland Prairie, and in other places has shallow soils over
hard limestone with vegetation more closely resembling that of the Ft. Worth Prairie.
The western portion of the area resembles the typical butte and mesa country of the
Lampasas Cut Plain with numerous oaks on Edwards Limestone Summits. In addition,
the topographic diversity and deeply cut streams in the region provide important
microhabitat variation which support many species primarily found on the Edwards
Plateau. The vegetation in such areas as the bluffs overlooking the Brazos River in
southern Johnson County is remarkably similar to the Edwards Plateau. Due to such
factors as fire control, overgrazing and disturbance from agriculture, juniper (Juniperus
spp.) within the area have become the most problematic species invading and eliminating
other native species as well as grasslands (Diggs et al. 1999).
The project area is located within the Texan Biotic Provence as described by Blair
(1950), who listed 49 species of mammals, 39 species of snakes, 16 species of lizards,
five species of salamanders and newts, and 14 species of frogs and toads. During our
investigation, we sighted the following species: eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus);

fox squirrel (Sciurus niger); striped skunk (Mephistis mephistis); white-tailed deer
(Odocoileus virginianus); wild hog (Sus scrofa); great blue heron (Ardea Herodias);
cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis); turkey vulture (Cathartes aura); turkey (Meleagris
gallopavo); roadrunner (Coccyzus americanus); common crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos);
and cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis). During prehistoric times large numbers of bison
(Bison bison) periodically inhabited the Grand Prairie environment (McDonald 1981).
1.3

BEDROCK GEOLOGY AND SOILS

The bedrock geology encountered within all four parcels at Lake Whitney is
predominantly comprised of Lower Cretaceous aged Fredericksburg Group limestone
formations such as the Edwards (Ked), Comanche Peak (Kcp) and Walnut Clay (Kwa).
The formations (or facies) associated with the Fredericksburg Group are derived from the
remains of ancient mollusk shells which accumulated to great depths within a reef that
covered Texas during the Lower Cretaceous. Exposed locations of Fredericksburg Group
formations are often sought out by many fossil hunters in Texas due to its large number
of easily accessible fossils. The Fredericksburg Group extends approximately 100 feet
and rests upon the Paluxy Sand Formation of the Glen Rose Group (Sellards 1932).
Holocene alluvium and Late Pleistocene fluviatile terrace deposits occur within the
project area in areas adjacent to the Brazos River and its tributaries (Barnes 1987). The
bedrock formations encountered within each survey parcel is shown within Table 1-2.

The soils encountered in areas away from the floodplain in the Mesquite Creek, Nolan
River and Brazos River parcels are the result of the weathering and erosion of two older
lower Cretaceous bedrock limestone formations, the 400 feet thick Glen Rose and the 300
feet thick Edwards. Typically these limestones weather and erode into relatively flat
topped hills with sloping hill sides. Flat hill tops are formed by erosion of resistant layers
of dense limestone while hill sides from more easily eroded layers of ancient sea shells
and debris. The thickness and ârichnessâ of soils produced by the weathering of
limestone bedrock formations is determined by the amount of shale (clay) embedded in
the limestone. Pure limestone weathers largely by solution, leaving little soil while
limestone with high shale content weathers into clays and silt, which are the weathering
products of shale. Thus, the thin poor soils commonly seen over Glen Rose and Edwards
limestones on the Edwards Plateau and Grand Prairie are primarily the result being

formed/located on bedrock with low shale content. This general process also helps
explain why the Blackland Prairie has developed such deep and rich clay soils. Unlike
the Edwards Plateau and Grand Prairie, the Blackland Prairie formed over upper
Cretaceous bedrock formations with high shale content thus, facilitating deep and rich
soil development (Beaumont 2007). The soils encountered within each parcel are shown
in Table 1-3. Soil descriptions and profiles are from USDA-SCS (2006).

2.0 CULTURAL CONTEXT
2.1

CULTURAL HISTORICAL FRAMEWORK

Traditionally, the middle Brazos River valley has been reported as being within the
Central Texas Archeological Region as defined by Prewitt (1981). In fact, excavations at
the nearby Blum and Kyle rock shelters were instrumental in Jelksâ (1953, 1962)
development of the Austin and Toyah foci of the Central Texas aspect. However,
assigning abstract boundaries such as cultural areas to regions is very problematic in
nature. As time progresses, boundaries tend to shift and blur as new discoveries are
brought to light (Collins 2004). Such is the case within the central Brazos River valley.
Since 1981, more archeological sites in the area have been recorded that contain Late
Prehistoric material that was derived from or heavily influenced by Caddo and Plains
cultures from the north and northeast (see Pertulla et al. 1995:189-195). This prompted
Perttula (2004:13) to expand the southern boundary of the North-central Archeological
Region approximately 50 miles south, incorporating large portions of the Brazos River
valley including the project area.
There has been abundant archeological work done in North Central Texas and the
southern plains, much of which has been summarized in recent overviews of
archeological research in these regions (Hofman et al. 1989; Prikryl 1990; Story et al.
1990; Vehik 1984). However, despite archeological research, a lack of data has made for
a poor and unrefined chronological framework for the region. Probably the most
localized chronology of the middle Brazos River valley was developed by Frank Watt in
1978 based on radiocarbon dates obtained during excavations at Horn Shelter #2
(41BQ46), the Aycock Shelter (41BL28) and the Clark Midden (41ML39) (Watt 1978).
While specific, the chronology doesnât take into account other important sites discovered
away from the Brazos River which when combined helped researchers refine the
chronology of the North-central region. The generalized chronology presented below was
obtained from several sources, including: Ferring and Yates (1997, 1998), Prikryl (1990),
Perttula (2004), and Watt (1978).
2.1.1

Paleoindian Period

The Paleoindian period in North Central Texas spans from 9950 to 6500 B.C. but lacks
extensive archeological evidence. The period is known predominantly from diagnostic
projectile points. These are usually derived either from surface collections or mixed
stratigraphic contexts (Meltzer 1987; Meltzer and Bever 1995). Prikryl (1990) has
suggested that Plainview and Dalton point types are the most common in the region.
Huhnke and Wurtz (2004) have suggested that examination of deeply buried sites such as
the Clovis-age Aubrey site (41DN479) indicates that well-preserved Paleo-Indian sites in
this region will likely only be found in modern flood plains within deeply stratified
Holocene alluvium. However, important Paleoindian sites such as Horn Shelter 2
(41BQ46) have been documented within rock-shelters along the Brazos River (Watt

Ecological Communications Corporation

13

Archeological Investigations at Lake Whitney, Bosque, Hill, and Johnson Counties, Texas

1978). At Horn Shelter 2, Paleoindian points such as one possible Clovis (Story
1990:186), Folsom, Midland, Wilson, Meserve, Plainview/Barber/St. Maryâs Hall, San
Patrice, and Scottsbluff were recorded within deeply buried stratigraphic layers
(Bousman et al. 2004). The site is probably most famous for its 11,200 year old burial of
a man and small girl with associated grave goods; one of only three Paleoindian burials
recorded in North America with grave goods. Located approximately 20 km southeast of
Horn Shelter 2 another Paleoindian site (41HI68) was recorded in 1973 within an
agricultural field along the upper terrace of the Brazos. According to Bousman et al.
(2004:64), the site has the second highest number of recorded Paleoindian components
within TARL records, second only to the Wilson Leonard Site (41WM235). Very little
work has been done at this site to fully document its paleo component.
While evidence from this period is scant, on the basis of comparison with other areas,
researchers have argued that the broad distribution of artifacts over the landscape and use
of nonlocal lithic raw materials suggest a high degree of group mobility (Meltzer and
Smith 1986; Shafer 1977; Story 1990). Despite the assumption that big game hunting was
a major part of the subsistence strategy as in other areas of Texas during the Paleoindian
period, faunal remains recovered from the Horn Shelter 2 and Aubrey site suggest
subsistence did not focus solely on big game animals, but also upon a diverse range of
small game (Ferring and Yates 1997; Watts 1978; Redder 1985).
2.1.2

Archaic Period

The Archaic period in North Central Texas dates from 6500 B.C. to A.D. 700. Generally,
trends during the Archaic period suggest increasingly complex settlement systems which
correspond with decreased mobility, increased population size and density, and the
development of distinct territories (Prikyl 1990; Story 1985). As in surrounding regions,
the Archaic period is subdivided into the early, middle and late Archaic periods.
Early Archaic
The Early Archaic period (ca. 6500-4000 B.C.) is poorly known in the region and based
primarily on surface collections and sites with no isolable Early Archaic components
(Prikryl 1990). Projectile points associated with the Early Archaic period include Early
Split Stemmed and perhaps Angostura (Prikryl 1990; Story et al. 1990). The period is
characterized by small and widely distributed sites, which researchers have suggested is
an indication of a generalized hunting and gathering subsistence strategy with high group
mobility within large, poorly defined territories (Meltzer and Smith 1986; Story et al.
1985; Prikryl 1990).
Middle Archaic
The Middle Archaic period (4000-1500 B.C.) is even less well known and components
from this period are the least represented within sites in the region. As with the Early
Archaic, the majority of Middle Archaic sites consist of surface collections. Projectile

14

Ecological Communications Corporation

Archeological Investigations at Lake Whitney, Bosque, Hill, and Johnson Counties, Texas

points associated with the Middle Archaic period include the Basal Notched group
(Andice, Bell, Calf Creek), Carrollton, Wells, and Bulverde (Prikryl 1990; Story et al.
1990). What evidence is available, (mostly from an intact Middle Archaic component at
the Calvert site, 41DN102), has led Ferring and Yates (1997) to suggest the Middle
Archaic in North Central Texas can generally be characterized by broad cultural
interactions between people, a high degree of mobility, and a subsistence strategy based
on small game and deer.
Late Archaic
The Late Archaic period (ca. 1500 B.C.-A.D. 700) is characterized by an increase in the
total number of sites and a greater distribution of sites over the landscape. Prikryl (1990)
has suggested this settlement patterning is an indication of an increase in population
density and decreased group mobility during the Late Archaic period in North Central
Texas. Projectile points associated with the Late Archaic period include Marshall,
Edgewood, Castroville, Dawson, Ellis, Trinity, Dallas, Palmillas, Yarbrough, Godley,
Gary and Elam (Prikryl 1990; Story et al. 1990; Fields 2004). Investigations at Late
Archaic occupation sites in the region have led researchers to suggest that these were
used seasonally by small bands pursuing a generalized hunting and foraging strategy
(Peter and McGregor 1988; Ferring and Yates 1997). A large number of sites which date
to this time period have been found around Lake Whitney within alluvial terrace settings
along the Brazos River.
2.1.3

Late Prehistoric Period

Describing the Late Prehistoric period in North-central Texas is made complicated by the
apparent movement of peoples and influence from nearby Caddo and Plains cultures
located in North and Northeast Texas. This is evident in sites such as the Harrell Site
(41YN1) which contained artifacts (Perdiz point, ceramics) that point to apparent
interactions with Caddo and Toyah groups (see Ferring and Yates 1997). In addition, a
small number of Caddoan style ceramics has been recorded at sites located on terraces
and rockshelters within the central Brazos River basin (Perttula 1995:190). In all
likelihood, this area contains additional sites with Caddo ceramics whose location is only
known by locals and/or are marked on historic maps (USGS 1924). According to Perttula
et al. (1995:190), the presence of Caddo ceramics within the region can potentially
address important issues relating to the local and extra-local trade and exchange between
Caddoan horticulturalist/agriculturalists and hunter-gatherers as well as perceived
expansions in Caddoan land use patterns.
Within North-central Texas, the Late Prehistoric dates from A.D. 700 to 1700 and is
commonly characterized by the appearance of arrow points and or ceramics in the
archeological record. For North Central Texas, the Late Prehistoric is subdivided into an
early and a late phase (Lynott 1977, Prikryl 1990). The early phase (A.D. 700-1200) is
characterized by a continuation of the hunting and gathering subsistence strategy of the
Archaic period, ceramics tempered with sand and grog, and Scallorn, Catahoula, Alba

Archeological Investigations at Lake Whitney, Bosque, Hill, and Johnson Counties, Texas

and Steiner arrow points (Lynott 1977, Prikryl 1990). The late phase (A.D. 1200 to 1700)
is characterized by evidence of horticulture and bison procurement, shell-tempered
Nocona Plain ceramics, and Maud, Fresno, Washita, Harrell, and Perdiz points (Harris
and Harris 1970; Morris and Morris 1970; Lynott 1977; Prikryl 1990).
The presence of domesticates at the Cobb-Pool (41DL148) site and other nearby
locations has sparked debate surrounding the timing and extent of maize agriculture
during the Late Prehistoric period in North Central Texas (Peter and McGregor 1988;
Brown et al. 1987; Rohn 1998), although the lack of definitive evidence has left the issue
unresolved. Huhnke and Wurtz (2004) suggest the stable carbon isotope value for a single
disturbed burial (41DL373) dated to A.D. 1200 is comparable to those of initial maizeconsuming Caddo populations in Arkansas. Based on these findings they suggest maize
horticulture may have been introduced into North Central Texas around A.D. 1200;
however, without additional samples this suggestion is not convincing.
2.1.4

Historic

The Brazos River served as a major transportation corridor for many Native American
groups during their seasonal migrations. In its southeasterly route from Stonewall
County to the Gulf of Mexico in Brazoria County, the river linked diverse ecosystems,
resources, and cultural groups. As tribes became increasingly sedentary, small villages
appeared along the river and Indians regularly met for Rancherias. These were semipermanent villages where Indian groups from different regions would gather to exchange
news, people, and goods.
By the seventeenth century, various tribes of the southern Wichita Indians had
established settlements along the Brazos River in Hill and Bosque counties. The French
translator Pedro Vial wrote in his diary that he stopped at a Tawakoni village on the
Brazos in 1785. The village was probably in Hill County, or close to it (John 1994). By
the early nineteenth century a âTowash Villageâ was located on the eastern bank of the
Brazos in Hill County in the Lake Whitney area, about six miles downstream from Fort
Graham. This village was depicted on a several maps dating to the 1850s, including the
1855 Bosque County land grant map, and Jacob DeCordovaâs 1855 map of Texas.
Further, about two miles downstream of Fort Graham is the remains of an Anadarko
settlement that was established in Hill County in 1844 under an Indian leader named JosÃ©
Maria. JosÃ© Maria left east Texas in 1843 with approximately 200 Anadarkos and signed
a series of treaties with the Texas government in exchange for protection and trade goods
(Hosmer 2008). His group settled in between 1844 and 1849 on the banks of the Brazos
in Hill County near a Torrey trading post (Austin 2008).
Until the 1850s, the Lake Whitney area occupied the western edge of the upper Texas
frontier. Due to its position, it was recognized as critical terrain not only for preventing
Indian raids into the more settled areas of Texas, but also as a jumping point for
exploration and future expansion. As early as 1839, George Erath and Texas Rangers

16

Archeological Investigations at Lake Whitney, Bosque, Hill, and Johnson Counties, Texas

reached the Bosque River near Valley Mills on a scouting mission for Indians (Bosque
County Collection 2008). The soldiers were impressed with the areaâs beauty and
consequently some of them surveyed the land for themselves. However, permanent
settlement did not come to the area until the end of the 1840s.
One of the key enterprises to facilitate exploration of the upper frontier in Hill and
Bosque counties was a Torrey trading house, which, according to one source, was built
on the Brazos River in what is today the northern part of McLennan County (Armbruster
2008). The Torreyâs trading houses were originally established by three brothersâJohn,
David and Thomas Torrey-- as frontier trading posts. The posts were stocked with goods
from a supply house in Houston, which received goods such as saddles, guns, and
ammunition, shipped from Boston and New York. The goods would then be sent to the
frontier where they would be traded to surveyors, soldiers, Texas Rangers, and Indians in
exchange for animal hides and other products. The Brazos River trading post in
Mclennan County was built 1843. The post not only traded goods to the Indians but also
helped recover stolen horses, runaway slaves, and captured Mexicans.
The Torreyâs trading houses in Texas effectively served as listening posts along the
frontier. So critical were they that Sam Houston requested that the post along the Brazos
be opened as part of his strategy for negotiating with the Indians. In 1845, a major treaty
between George Terrell and Kichai, Tawakoni, Waco and Wichita tribes was signed at
the post located in McLennan County; Indians regularly camped near the posts to trade
and exchange information, and the posts furnished many expeditions and new settlements
with supplies. In 1849, George Barnard bought the Brazos post in McLennan County and
supposedly moved it upstream to Comanche Peak in Hood County (Armbruster 2008).
However, DeCordovaâs 1855 map of Texas shows the trading house located opposite
Kimballâs Bend, in Hill County at the same location that the 1844 Anadarko village was
said to be located. Barnard is also listed in the 1850 census for Hill County, living in that
area. He listed his profession as âIndian Trader.â Possibly the trading house moved
more than once.
Though the Torreyâs trading houses enabled exploration and surveying to take place
along the upper frontier, real settlement did not come to Hill and Bosque counties until
after the United States annexed Texas and the western frontier became the responsibility
of the US Government. The US military established Fort Graham in 1849 as part of a
chain of defenses for guarding the frontier, and to help facilitate westward expansion
toward New Mexico and beyond. Fort Graham was located at the mouth of Bear Creek,
on the east side of the Brazos in Hill County. The command was originally given to
Major Ripley Arnold, whose orders were to provide escorts for supply trains and
travelers, to protect existing settlers from Indian raids, and whenever possible make
attempts toward peaceful negotiations with Indians. According to a reconnaissance
report made by Lt. W. H. C. Whiting in 1849, Fort Graham was one of the most
strategically important posts along the upper Texas frontier due to its proximity to Indian
villages and to the Torrey trading house operated by George Barnard. Nonetheless, it
never had a large troop detachment, even in spite of repeated requests for more men
(Myres 2008).

The establishment of Fort Graham did attract families to settle in the area. The first
permanent settlers of Bosque County came in 1849 and settled at Valley Mills, and along
Steele Creek at its confluence with the Brazos, across the river from Fort Graham
(Bosque County Collection 2008). In 1850, Richard Kimball, a New York merchant sold
27,000 acres of land on the west side of the Brazos to the English Universal Immigration
Company for purposes of founding an English colony named Kent. The land covered
what is today known as Kimballâs Bend and included approximately 30 miles of river
frontage in Bosque County. Kimballâs business partner in the plan was Jacob
DeCordova, who hired James Cason Frazier, one of Bosque Countyâs earliest settlers, to
survey the land. The English families, consisting of approximately 125 people arrived
near the end of 1850. The winter, however, proved to be unforgiving, the English
colonists were unable to make their crops grow, and Indian attacks were a constant threat.
The colony disbanded by the end of 1851, with some of the families moving to the shelter
of Fort Graham and others choosing to settle elsewhere (Renick 1925). The Kent colony
land was later sold back to Kimball and DeCordova, and DeCordova sold a large portion
of the land lying just south of the colony of Kent to James Cason Frazier.
As the frontier expanded westward over the next few years, Fort Graham became more
important as a listening post than a frontier fort. By 1853, the frontier had expanded
beyond the Brazos, and Fort Graham was ordered to be closed, and its troops deployed
northwest to Fort Belknap, which was located in Young County. A noteworthy incident
occurred when Ripley Arnold, who had served as the original commanding officer of Fort
Graham, and who later left the post to establish Fort Worth, returned to facilitate its
closing. Apparently he quarreled with Josephus Steiner, the postâs surgeon, and in a
skirmish, Steiner shot and killed the officer. Though the military attempted to arrest
Steiner they were unsuccessful. Steiner eventually turned himself in to state authorities.
He was tried in a civil court and acquitted (Miller 2008).
The incident is worth mentioning here, as Josephus Steiner and his brother, Thomas, were
not only some of the areaâs earliest settlers, they were also actively engaged in land
speculation in Hill and Bosque counties. They organized the petition to have Hill County
created from Navarro County in 1852, in order to stimulate development (Austin 2008).
Thomas donated land for the Hill County seat in Hillsboro (Austin 2008), while Josephus
donated land for the townsite of Meridian the following year, which was to be the seat of
the newly formed Bosque County (Strickland 2007). Josephus Steiner later moved to
Austin, where he became a prominent and well-respected physician.
Though the populations of both counties grew steadily, Bosque and Hill counties
remained overwhelmingly rural, with no major industries other than agriculture. By
1860, Hill County had 3,653 inhabitants (Austin 2008); Bosque County counted
approximately 312 families (Bosque County Collection 2008), most of whom engaged in
farming or ranching. Both counties voted overwhelmingly for secession during the Civil
War, sending cavalry and infantry units to fight mainly in Louisiana and Arkansas, but
also supplying soldiers to guard the area against Indians (Austin 2008, Strickland 2007).

18

After the Civil War, a number of political clashes took place in Hill and Bosque counties.
Governor E. J. Davis accused officials in Hill County of harboring criminals such as John
Wesley Hardin, Kinch West, and the Cox Brothers. According to one report in the
Austin State Journal, lawlessness was so bad in this part of Texas that killings were
averaging two a week (Stickland 2008). When Hill County officials blocked the arrest of
a two men who murdered an African American couple in Bosque County, the Governor
declared martial law, sending the State Militia to suppress the small rebellion that was
taking place in Hillsboro. This resulted in the arrest of some of Hill Countyâs largest
landowners (Dobbs 2008). Though martial law only lasted two days in Hill County, the
spirit of the rebellion remained alive to many residents well beyond the actual events, and
many Hill and Bosque County residents bitterly resented the Reconstruction Era
government long after the 1870s.
Also during the 1870s, the Chisolm Trail passed through both Bosque and Hill counties,
running near the town of Kimball and crossing the Brazos into northwestern Hill County
at a low point in the river (Austin 2008). The biggest factor in population growth in both
counties, however, was the railroad, which finally reached Hill and Bosque counties in
1881. The railroads catalyzed the growth of towns such as Hillsboro, Meridian, Itasca,
Clifton, and Valley View. They brought new immigrants to the region, goods that were
previously unavailable, and provided an efficient means for local farmers and ranchers to
get people and products to major markets. Due to construction of railroads, the number
of farms and ranches increased dramatically after 1881, and populations in both counties
continued to rise until 1910. After that, population in the Lake Whitney area started a
decline that was not reversed until the 1980s. Floods during the early part of the
twentieth century, insect plagues, the Great Depression of the 1930s, and droughts in the
1940s and 1950s all contributed to economic failure for many agricultural families.
An initiative to dam the Brazos River brought major changes to the area in the 1940s and
1950s, resulting in the sale of many farms along the river. Planning for the dam had
begun as early as the 1930s, when the Brazos River Conservation and Reclamation
District (the name changed to the Brazos River Authority in 1953) developed a master
plan for managing and developing water resources along the Brazos River. The plan
proposed construction of thirteen major dams. In the 1940s, the Brazos River
Conservation and Reclamation District began working with the Corps of Engineers to
built nine dams, one of which was Whitney. Construction of Whitney Dam began in
1947 and was completed in 1951, creating Lake Whitney. The dam features a power plan
that generates electricity that is now sold to the Brazos Electric Power Cooperative
(Breeding 2008).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

The project area is located in North-central Texas Archeological Region in the middle
Brazos River valley. There has been abundant archeological work done in North Central
Texas and the southern plains, much of which has been summarized in recent overviews
of archeological research in these regions (Hofman et al. 1989; Prikryl 1990; Story et al.
1990). Many reservoir projects have been completed in this area and include Lake

Archeological Investigations at Lake Whitney, Bosque, Hill, and Johnson Counties, Texas

Granbury, Lake Whitney, Waco Lake, and Aquilla Lake. Archeological work associated
with the construction of these reservoirs make up the bulk of the previous archeological
research conducted in this area.
Some of the earliest archeological investigations associated with reservoir projects in the
central Brazos River valley were conducted at Lake Whitney, Aquilla Lake, the Bosque
River and the greater Waco area. The University of Texas conducted early excavations at
the Harrell site in 1938 and 1939 at Possum Kingdom Reservoir in Palo Pinto County.
This site was found to be a habitation site occupied from the Middle Archaic through the
historic period, and is the type site for the Protohistoric/historic Henrietta focus (Krieger
1946). No formal early archeological investigations had been completed prior to the
construction of Waco Lake. However, avocational archeologists associated with the
Central Texas Archeological Society conducted archeological investigations in the
general area before Waco Lake was built (Bryan 1935, 1936). Later expansions of Waco
Lake in the 1950s and the 1980s were accompanied by extensive archeological work at
the Baylor and Britton sites by the Texas Archeological Salvage Project, which helped to
establish the cultural chronological sequence for the central Brazos area (Story and
Shafer 1965).
Archeological work in the central Brazos River valley was also conducted at Lake
Whitney in Bosque County. As part of the Smithsonian Institutionâs River Basin Surveys
program, in 1947 Robert Stephenson conducted archeological surveys along a stretch of
the Brazos River (Stephenson 1947). A total of 61 archeological sites were documented
as a result of this survey work, and Stephenson concluded that the area was extensively
occupied during the Archaic period, and was characterized by small open campsites. In
addition to the Archaic occupation, a Late Prehistoric occupation was also recognized for
open and rockshelter sites in the region, as well as sites occupied by immigrant Native
American groups during the nineteenth century (Stephenson 1947). These early
investigations were followed by formal excavations in the 1950s at five significant sites.
The first of these was the Stansbury site, which was a Wichita, Caddo and Tonkawa
settlement. The Steele site was a stratified open campsite with a well-preserved Archaic
component. Lastly, the Pictograph, Buzzard, and Sheep Rockshelters all contained
stratified Late Prehistoric deposits (Stephenson 1970).
Excavations at other rockshelters in the vicinity of Lake Whitney are also significant, and
include the Blum and Kyle Rockshelters (Jelks 1953, Jelks 1962). Excavations at the
Blum Rockshelter in 1952 revealed that it contained stratified deposits dating from the
Archaic through the Late Prehistoric periods. The Dallas Archeological Society (DAS)
and the Tarrant County Archeological Society (TCAS) were active as volunteers around
the same time as Jelks was conducting excavations at the Blum Rockshelter. In 1956, the
TCAS, directed by Robert Forrester, excavated the Ham Creek site near Lake Whitney, a
prehistoric campsite (Forrester 1964). The TCAS and the DAS also excavated three
rockshelters between 1957 and 1958, including Buzzard, Little Buzzard, and Forrester
rockshelters (Long 1961). The Kyle Site (41HI1) was excavated by Edward Jelks with
the DAS and members of the Texas Archeological Salvage Project (TASP) in 1959-60

20

Archeological Investigations at Lake Whitney, Bosque, Hill, and Johnson Counties, Texas

and the data recovered at the site was instrumental in defining the Toyah and Austin
Phases of the Late Prehistoric period in Central Texas (Jelks 1962).
In the 1970s, surveys were completed along Lake Whitney in accordance with plans to
raise the pool level. A survey completed by Skinner and Harris (1971) recorded and
reevaluated 34 archeological sites, including historic Fort Graham. In a survey by
Southern Methodist University (SMU), Skinner and Gallagher (1974) recorded and
reevaluated 47 sites near Lake Whitney in 1971-72. After these surveys were completed
and the pool level was raised, a rockshelter site, later named the Bear Creek Shelter, was
being found after it was being eroded by wave action. The site was excavated in 1976
and 1978 (Lynott 1976, 1978, 1980) and stratified evidence of occupations was found,
ranging from the Middle Archaic through the Late Prehistoric periods. In 1978, Albert
Redder recorded numerous sites within Bosque County, including the Yellow Metate
Shelter (41BQ70), the Dagley Site (41BQ71), and most notably rockshelters in the area
of Spivey Creek Crossing. A total of ten rockshelters were named and numbered as
Hornâs 1 (41BQ47), Hornâs 2 (41BQ46), etc. These sites contained well stratified
deposits, including Paleodindian materials such as points and burials. Watt later drew
information from the Horn shelters, Aycock Shelter, and Clark Midden (41ML39) to
establish a radiocarbon chronology of sites in the central Brazos River valley (Watt
1978).
Archeological work in the central Brazos River valley was also conducted at nearby
Aquilla Lake. SMU conducted surveys at Aquilla Lake in the 1970s, recording a total of
125 prehistoric sites (Skinner and Henderson 1972). The small size of the sites along
Aquilla Creek led Skinner and Henderson (1972) to suggest that the sites were occupied
to conduct seasonally specific activities and that larger and more-permanent base camps
were probably located at areas such as the Brazos River. In 1975, SMU completed an
additional survey and the first test excavations (Lynott and Peter 1977). A total of six
new sites were recorded, 68 previously recorded sites were reevaluated, and test
excavations were completed on 23 of the sites. As a result of this work, Lynott and Peter
(1977) identified three site types: quarries/workshops, foraging stations, and seasonal
campsites.
Additional site testing by SMU continued near Aquilla Lake in 1977-1978 under the
direction of S. Alan Skinner, which resulted in 14 sites ranging in age from Paleoindian
to Late Prehistoric (Skinner et al. 1978). In 1979-1980, the Texas Archeological Survey
of the University of Texas at Austin also conducted excavations at Aquilla Lake under
the direction of Richard Watson, and again in 1982-1983 under the direction of David
Brown. The results of these investigations were combined with the testing done by SMU
into a comprehensive report (Brown 1987). A total of 24 sites are included in the report,
11 of which were located along Aquilla Creek, and all but four of which are now
inundated by Aquilla Lake. The sites ranged in age from Paleoinidan through the Late
Prehistoric period and included sites from the floodplain, terrace, and upland areas.

PREVIOUSLY RECORDED SITES

2.3.1

Sites within the Project Areas

A map and records search was conducted at the archives of the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL), the Texas Historical Commission (THC), and the THC
Atlas online database. These searches determined that no previously recorded
archeological sites are located within any of the four survey parcels. The search also
revealed that no previous archeological projects have been conducted within the project
areas.
2.3.2

Sites within One Mile of the Inventory Parcels

The TARL and THC searches determined that 21 previously recorded archeological sites
are located within one mile (1,600 m) of the four inventory areas. These include two
prehistoric lithic scatters, six rockshelters, two burial sites, one quarry, and ten campsites,
one of which contained Caddo ceramics (Table 2-1).

Six of the sites (i.e., 41BQ23, 41BQ24, 41HI12, 41HI28, 41HI29, 41HI55) were recorded
by R.L. Stephenson in 1947 while conducting a survey for the Smithsonian Institutionâs
River Basin Surveys program (Table 2-1).
Â

Site 41BQ23 is described as an open campsite that is a known Tonkawa village
site of the period 1860-1870.

Â

Site 41BQ24 is a probable Archaic campsite located on a low terrace that was
eroded at the time of recordation.

Â

Site 41HI12 is an Indian burial site located in an area marked by slightly mounded
piles of rocks and dirt on a peninsula. Five of the burials were reported to have
been âdug outâ by locals around 1910-20.

Â

Site 41HI28 is an open campsite located on a terrace edge that contained a small
number of artifacts on the surface. According to locals, a burial is reported to have
eroded out of the site sometime prior to the sites recordation in 1947.

Â

Site 41HI29 is a campsite located on a low terrace containing non-diagnostic
artifacts.

Â

Site 41HI55 (Sheep Shelter) is a rockshelter located along a tributary to the Nolan
River that was excavated in 1947 by Stephenson and found to contain stratified
Late Prehistoric deposits. A small campsite located at the base of the shelter was
later recorded by Henderson in 1972.

Five of the sites (41HI268, 41HI274, 41HI275, 41JN2, 41JN13) were recorded by
archeologist Richard Forrester (Table 2-1).

Ecological Communications Corporation

Archeological Investigations at Lake Whitney, Bosque, Hill, and Johnson Counties, Texas

Â

Site 41HI268 was recorded by Forrester in 1957. It is a 40 m long rockshelter
from which multiple burials were recovered.

Â

Site 41HI274 (Panther Track Cave) is described as a small rockshelter discovered
by Forrester in the 1950âs and later excavated by Jelks in 1962. According to the
site form submitted to TARL, the site contained intact deposits of Late Prehistoric
(Austin Phase) cultural materials.

Â

Site 41HI275 is a small rockshelter along the Brazos River that was discovered by
Forrester in the 1950âs and later reported to TARL in 1994. According to the site
form, the site contained only one blade on the surface and no further research was
recommended.

Â

Site 41JN2 was discovered by Forrester in 1951 and was also excavated by
Forrester from 1955-57. The site form was later submitted to TARL by Forrester
in 1994. The site contained intact deposits of cultural material originating from
the Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric. The Late Archaic component included a
burial of a small child recovered 22 inches below surface with associated
Yarbrough and Ellis projectile points (Forrester 1964). The site is reported to
have been 100 percent destroyed sometime after 1957 by nearby road
construction activities.

Â

Site 41JN13 is described as a small surface lithic scatter on a low terrace that
contained Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric diagnostic materials.

Sites 41HI52 and 41HI56 are both long and narrow rockshelters recorded by archeologist
Dee Ann Story in 1964 (Table 2-1).
Â

At 41HI52 a small number of bone, lithics, and moderate amounts of charcoal
were observed on the surface.

Â

According to the site form, 41HI56 was previously excavated by archeologist
Edward Jelks in 1963 and contained a Late Prehistoric component.

Four of the sites (41BQ89, 41BQ92, 41JN6, 41JN7) were recorded by archeologist Alan
Skinner in 1971 (Table 2-1).

24

Â

Site 41BQ89 is described as a campsite located on a terrace edge that was heavily
eroded and contained a probable Late Archaic component.

Â

Site 41BQ92 is described as a campsite located on a low terrace that contained a
Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric component. According to the site form, the site
contained numerous (unidentified) prehistoric ceramics.

Ecological Communications Corporation

Â

Site 41JN6 is described as a campsite located on a hill side and containing
numerous non-diagnostic lithic materials that has been heavily looted by the
locals.

Â

Site 41JN7 is described as an unknown prehistoric locality that was exposed in a
road cut and contained a few lithic artifacts.

41HI201 (Eaken Burial and Cache) was recorded by THC archeologist Tim Seaman in
1984 at the base of a hill on the low Brazos River floodplain. The site contained a few
fragmentary bones associated with a human burial and a cache of 23 lithic chert blades.
Two of the sites were recorded by USACE archeologist Tim Dalbey between 1994-1996.
Â

41HI270 is a large campsite located along a terrace edge that had been heavily
looted over the years. According to the site form, the site contained large
limestone slab oven features in addition to numerous artifacts associated with the
Late Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and Historic periods. In addition, one Caddo sherd
was recovered at the site.

Â

Site 41HI277 is described as a large prehistoric quarry located along a ridge top.
Diagnostic artifacts were not encountered within the site during recordation.

Finally, site 41JN51 was recorded by archeologist Doug Boyd of Prewitt & Associates in
2004 while conducting a pipeline survey. The site is a prehistoric campsite located
within the USACE Ham Creek Recreational Area on a low terrace where Ham Creek
joins Lake Whitney. The investigation was comprised of a series of backhoe trenches
excavated perpendicular to the Brazos River. During excavations, a dense 60 cm thick
prehistoric component of unknown age was discovered throughout the site. Boyd
concluded the pipeline would not impact the site as long as it was laid down along the
path of the trenches excavated during his recordation.

3.0 METHODS
The 555-acre inventory was conducted from November 13-20, 2007 and was followed by
excavations on December 10-16, 2007. A total of 53 person days were spent in the field
to complete the inventory and excavations. Methods complied with, or exceeded, the
requirements for field tactics stipulated by the USACE for archeological inventories in
Texas.
3.1

FIELD TACTICS

3.1.1 Inventory
For each parcel, a logistical plan was prepared in advance with transect lines indicated at
20 m intervals on aerial photographs. Each field archeologist was given a copy of the
aerial and was assigned a transect line and a targeted number of shovel tests. Transect
lines were designated with an alpha prefix and individual shovel tests along each transect
line were numbered, so that shovel test G-5 identified the fifth test along the seventh
transect (Transect G). In general, each crewmember followed his/her own transect,
walking in parallel with the other crewmembers. Occasionally, for logistical reasons, two
crewmembers doubled up with one person digging the shovel tests and another screening
and recording the field forms, or two crew members would âleapfrogâ along one transect,
each digging alternating shovel tests.
While approximately even coverage was attempted, surveyors deviated from transect
alignments in order to test high probability locations. Areas of obvious deep disturbance,
such as bulldozing, were noted on the field maps and were excluded from shovel testing.
Similarly, areas that were completely inundated were excluded from transect coverage,
including low swampy areas, ponds, and all areas underneath current lake levels.
Recent debris, such as aluminum beer cans and plastic detritus, was commonly observed.
No further attention was paid to such items clearly less than 50 years old.
Shovel Testing
The contractual scope of work issued by the USACE specified that at a minimum of one
shovel test was to be excavated per three acres (0.33 tests per acre). Using this rate of
coverage, a minimum of 185 shovel tests was required to inventory the 555 acres. In
sum, 374 shovel tests were dug, or 189 more than the required minimum. Intensity of
shovel testing varied from parcel to parcel depending on ground visibility, vegetation and
topography. For the project as a whole, final coverage was 0.67 tests per acre, or about
twice the contractual minimum (Table 3-1).

At all positive shovel tests and at selected other tests, GPS readings were taken to verify
transect and shovel test locations. All shovel tests were 30 to 35 cm in diameter. All
tests were dug to the bottom of the Holocene deposits as indicated by clay, or to 80 cm
below ground surface if no clay was present. Tests were individually recorded with
regard to depth, soil type and color, and cultural material present. Tests were dug in
natural stratigraphic levels not exceeding 20 cm in thickness and all excavated material
was screened through Â¼-inch (6.4 mm) mesh.
All cultural material within shovel tests was collected with the exception of recent objects
such as bottle glass shards, nails, and aluminum pop-tabs. These were assumed to
indicate recent disturbance and were not collected. At the historic sites, diagnostic
material and a sample of surface artifacts were collected from the surfaces. All shovel
tests were backfilled.
Site Recordation
Each positive shovel test was further investigated by excavating additional shovel tests in
the immediate vicinity at 5 to 15 m distances for up to six tests in an area. If more than
one of these tests were positive or if more than two artifacts were found in any single test,
then the location was designated as a site. Otherwise, the positive test was designated as
an isolated occurrence. The coordinates of isolates were plotted and the artifacts were
collected, but these were not further recorded. The recorded locations of previously
recorded sites were similarly investigated using multiple shovel tests. On each site, a
permanent site datum was established using a 12-inch iron rod fixed with an aluminum
survey tag. Tags were stamped with âECOMM 2007â and with a temporary site number for
newly recorded sites.
Site boundaries were investigated by excavating multiple shovel tests in the area to
identify zones of zero or low artifact presence. Generally, these tests were in cardinal
directions from the initial positive test, unless topography suggested otherwise. Site
boundaries were defined on the basis of subsurface artifact distribution, complemented by
surface artifacts and features (where present), topography, soil exposures, and other
relevant criteria. Based on the distribution of negative shovel tests or absence of surface

28

Ecological Communications Corporation

Archeological Investigations at Lake Whitney, Bosque, Hill, and Johnson Counties, Texas

artifacts, site boundaries were prominently marked with fluorescent pink flagging tape.
Sites were photographed, sketched and mapped, and all site data were recorded onto State
of Texas site data forms. Artifacts, notes and records will be curated at TARL.

3.1.2 Excavations
In order to assist evaluation of site integrity and research potential, controlled test units
were excavated on three sites. Units were strategically placed in proximity to areas
where shovel tests encountered high artifact densities or where features were encountered
during the survey. All controlled units measured 100 cm by 100 cm and were excavated
in arbitrary 10 cm levels with trowels and shovels. Elevation controls were established in
the highest corner of each unit at the current ground surface. GPS coordinates were
recorded at the southwestern corner of all units and plan view digital photos were taken
of each finished level and the completed unitâs wall profile. All excavated matrix was
screened through a Â¼-inch hardwire cloth. All artifacts recovered from unit excavations
were returned to EComm for processing, analysis and temporary curation.
3.2

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Archival research was conducted on sites whose archeological evidence dated to the
historic period. The purpose of the archival research was to identify historically notable
persons possibly associated with each site. Initial archival research was carried out by
examining the primary sources in the deed, land title, and probate records. This research
was conducted in Bosque and Hill counties. The landowners, their heirs, assigns, and
grantees were identified and their presence in the area during the period of interest was
verified through United States Census data.
The identified persons were then further researched for historic significance. Individuals
of historic significance were defined as those who have merited an individual listing in
The Handbook of Texas Online published by the Texas State Historical Association and
the General Libraries of the University of Texas at Austin. If a person of historical
significance was in any way associated with the properties, capsule biography
information was compiled and the nature of the personâs relationship with the area and
the tracts was further researched to determine the level of the personâs involvement.
Persons residing on a piece of property and/or actively participating in its development
were determined to be significantly associated with the property. Persons owning a piece
of property but not residing there nor actively participating in its development (e.g.,
absentee owners) were determined to be not significantly associated with the property.
3.3

LABORATORY PROCEDURES

Artifacts recovered during the survey and excavations were processed at the EComm
laboratory. Artifacts and project materials were prepared for storage in accordance with
Federal Regulation 36 CFR Part 79, and in accordance with current artifact curation

Ecological Communications Corporation

29

Archeological Investigations at Lake Whitney, Bosque, Hill, and Johnson Counties, Texas

standards established by TARL. All artifacts were washed, labeled, and inventoried
before being sent to TARL for curation along with all records and photographs.

3.3.1 Soil Samples
Twenty-two soil susceptibility and pH samples were collected from the profile of one
unit. The standard procedure was to remove samples in a miniature column fashion.
First, the area of the wall to be sampled was scraped to ensure a recent exposure to the
atmosphere. An approximate 5-cm by 5-cm soil sample was taken vertically from top to
bottom in five-centimeter increments. The samples were collected in labeled bags and
their proveniences then recorded on a field form before being transported to the Center
for Archaeological Studies at Texas State University. Once there, the soils were removed
from bags and placed in plastic two-centimeter cubes. Each sample was then weighed
and placed at room temperature in a Bartington magnetic susceptibility MS2B sensor, its
susceptibility was displayed on an MS2 meter, and the data were recorded in a computer
database. The same samples for magnetic susceptibility analysis were then used to
measure their pH values. Each sample was mixed with tap water in a beaker, and the
50/50 mix was stirred vigorously so that the soil was suspended in the solution. The pH
values of the solution were then measured using a pH meter. The tap water alone was
also measured. The pH value of the tap water was then added or subtracted to the soil
and water value.

3.3.2 Historic Artifact Analysis
At each of the five historic sites, analysis of artifacts was conducted to identify
occupational periods The following background section addresses the majority of typical
artifacts found on historic farmsteads in Texas and their implications for dating.
Bottle and Dinnerware Glass
Glass bottles, jars, and dinnerware glass with makerâs marks are always helpful in
determining approximate date and place of manufacture, as well as likely contents.
Additional attributes can provide clues as to the probable age and contents of bottles,
such as mold seams and scars from the manufacturing process, labeling, closure types,
and glass color. As technology and customer desires changed through the years, so too
did the manufacturing of bottles. It is these discriminators that allow archeologists to
approximate their age. Primary reference sources used for the bottle glass analysis were
Munsey (1970) and Toulouse (1971). Selected pieces with possibly diagnostic
characteristics such as seams, decorations, and makersâ marks were pulled from the
collection for further examination. The individual characteristics of glass often overlap
through time.
In the 1700s, bottles were generally hand blown (thus no mold seams). The lip was then
crudely applied in a separate action. Although a lipping tool was used in the production

30

Ecological Communications Corporation

Archeological Investigations at Lake Whitney, Bosque, Hill, and Johnson Counties, Texas

of this piece, it is considered to be an applied finish and not a âtrueâ tooled finish. A
tooled finish employed the use of a mold, which incorporated the forming, or at least the
pre-forming, of the finish within the mold. After removal from the mold, the bottle was
then âtooledâ of its remaining imperfections. This applied and crudely tooled finish,
typically just called an âappliedâ finish, was placed and shaped on the neck, after the
removal from the blowpipe (Lindsey 2005). After 1850, finishing tools which smoothed
the inside and top of the lip were commonly used.
The year 1904 marked a significant change from handblown bottles to automatic bottlemaking machines. Another technological advancement allowed for the common
manufacture of screw-top bottles and jars. Although screw top bottles had been used prior
to the 1800s, they were considered specialty items and were not common until about
1924 (Polak 1997:24). Various labeling and decorative techniques such as raised
lettering and etching (frosting) were also used beginning in the 1880s.
Additives caused glass colors to change through time. Aqua, amber, olive green, and
brown are natural colors produced in glass manufacture. However, before 1880, the
predominate colors of bottles glass were shades of green and blue. The standard, natural
color of most cheap bottles produced since the beginning of making glass, until about
1900 (and even somewhat later for medicine bottles) was aqua, with varying hues of
green and blue. Glass is a mixture of lime, soda, and sand with traces of iron oxides.
When molten, the iron oxides in the sand cause a chemical which produces the aqua color
(Munsey 1970:69; Kendrick 1966:53).
With the exception of âblackâ glass, glass color was not an important consideration until
around 1880 when food manufacturers began adding manganese to the glass as a
decolorizer. After exposure to the sunâs ultra-violet rays the manganese would change
the color of the glass to amethyst or purple. Manganese worked fine until the outbreak of
World War I in 1915 caused another defining temporal characteristic to occur in bottles.
Prior to 1915, Germany was a main supplier of manganese. When the war broke out, the
supply of manganese was no longer available to the bottle makers and they resorted to
using selenium as a decolorizing agent. Selenium causes the glass to turn an amber color
when exposed to sunlight (Munsey 1970:55; Kendrick 1966:53). By about 1930 the glass
manufacturing process was refined so that neither manganese nor selenium had to be
used, resulting in clear glass with no hue. In addition, milk glass was commonly used in
the production of cosmetic and toiletry bottles, and ointment/cream jars, from the 1870s
to the mid-20th century (Lindsey 2005).
Ceramics
âDinnerware ceramicsâ include undecorated whiteware, as well as the following
decorated whitewares: decal ware (decalcomania), spatterware, band and line, edgeware,
mochaware, redware, and handpainted ware. A few stonewares are present in the
assemblage, as is a small quantity of porcelain and ironstone. Interestingly, no
transferware is present in the assemblage. Transferware is often found on sites occupied

31

Archeological Investigations at Lake Whitney, Bosque, Hill, and Johnson Counties, Texas

in the late 1800s and early 1900s. The term earthenware can be applied to a variety of
baked clay wares, including those listed in the previous paragraph. Undecorated
Whiteware is a highly fired refined clay with a vitreous surface. Whiteware was
commonly imported to America from Britain during the 1800s, but the demand for
undecorated type increased significantly in America by 1860. This type became a
common tableware setting for middle class families in this area of Texas after the 1860s,
replacing pewter and wooden wares (Fox et al. 1989:45), and are still being produced
today (Miller 1991).
Band and Line refers to a decoration technique in which one to three blue, brown, green,
and/or red lines painted under the glaze around the rim. Such vessels were most popular
from about 1875 to 1900 and were common hotel wares such as ironstone plates, saucers
and bowls. They are still being produced in limited quantities today (Miller 1991:7).
Decalcomania refers to a decoration technique in which designs inked in popular bright
colors and floral designs were transferred from thin paper onto the vessel. It is typical of
tableware used for the past 150 years. Developed in 1850 by Mintonâs potters in England
as a way to decorate cheap tableware (Ramsay 1976:291), it became quite popular during
the mid-nineteenth century (Durrenberger 1965:66), and is still used today.
Edgeware pieces are identified by their cockled or non-cockled edges that have been
incised and/or painted. Edgeware was made as early as about 1770 and continued in to
the 1890s. However, the green colored edges were generally superceded by blues around
1840 (Miller 1989; 1991:6).
Handpainted ware refers to polychrome painted table settings with âred, black, and some
lighter shades of blue and greenâ (Miller 1991:8) became popular during the 1830s. By
the 1840s, common designs included sprigs, often combined with the cut sponge
technique. These motifs were superceded in the 1870s by large floral designs (Miller
1991:8), popular through about 1900.
Ironstone is a highly fired earthenware, from about 1860-present in Texas. Also referred
to as âstone china,â âwhite granite,â and âgranite ware,â it can be decorated or
undecorated. Highly fired furnaces enabled the production of ironstone wares around
1813, but they probably became popular in Texas in the 1850 and 1860s. Raised molded
designs began appearing on ironstone wares about 1875. Like softer fired whitewares,
ironstone was a popular, relatively inexpensive utilitarian kitchenware, but was much
more durable and didnât break as easily. It is still being produced today (Fox et al. 1989;
Kovel and Kovel 2001a, b; Miller 1991).
Mocha ware is a soft paste creamware decorated with subtle, drab colors such as buff,
chocolate, terra cotta, and green, and often highlighted with intense black, blue, and
orange colors. Some pieces are banded, and sometimes referred to as banded creamware.
After firing, each vessel was dipped into a solution of tobacco, turpentine, and acid
before decorations were applied using a camelâs-hair brush, feather, or sponge.
Commonly called kitchen wares, mocha vessels were generally made to be used in

cottages and taverns. Although mocha ware was produced in the latter part of the 18th
century in England, it was also produced through the first part of the 20th century. Its
popularity in the U.S. was such that it is sometimes known as a Victorian ware, and thus
can presumably date to between 1880-1920 (Mocha Ware 2008a,b; Rogers 2005).
Porcelain is rarely present on eighteenth and early nineteenth century sites in Texas
because the fragile ware had to be transported from Europe (Ivey and Fox 1981:35), but it
became more common after 1832, when it was commonly manufactured in the United
States (Barber 1976:126-127). A small amount of Chinese porcelain, imported to Mexico
on the Manila galleons, is present on many Spanish colonial sites in Texas. It is
differentiated from European and American porcelain by the very slightly blue gray tint
of the body, and when decorations are present, the grayish blue designs lie beneath the
glaze, or delicately painted orange floral designs lie over the glaze.
Redware is a generic term for any earthenware formed from clay containing a high
concentration of iron oxide. Redware was being made in the U.S. as early as 1625 in the
Jamestown Colony, and is still being produced today. Initially produced under less than
ideal firing conditions, redwares were soft and porous, but it can also be defined as hard
fired. Lead glazes were applied to the softer paste vessels to prevent seepage of liquids
(Redware 2008a, b). Redware with lead glazes have been found in many of the Spanish
Colonial missions in Texas (e.g., Fox 2000). However, these were likely imported from
Mexico, and not made locally.
Spatterware, popular from 1800-1850, is aptly named for its spatter-painted appearance,
as though its been crudely sprayed, or patted onto the vessel. Colors include red, blue,
green, black, brown, pink, green, and yellow; blue is by far the most common (Bagdade
and Bagdade 1991:317; Greaser and Greaser 1967).
Spongeware describes a technique in which sponges are cut into a pattern, the sponge is
daubed in paint, and the pattern applied to the vessel. This technique was popular
between 1845-1900, and most frequently in small floral patterns (Bagdade and Bagdade
1991:325; Greaser and Greaser 1967).
Stoneware is a utilitarian ware and was commonly used in Texas kitchens and dairies
from 1860 through 1950 (Greer 1981:13-26). Popular stoneware found in the area
includes Albany Slip/Bristol glaze and Bristol Glaze. The combination of Albany Slip
(brown slip) and Bristol glaze (white) appeared in the first quarter of the twentieth
century and was continuously used until about 1920. Vessels with an Albany slip on the
inside and Bristol glaze on the outside were generally made before 1900. Bristol glaze on
both the interior and exterior then became the dominant type of stoneware used after
1920, and through about 1950 (Greer 1981:212).
Metal Hardware
Nails can be classified as 1) hand wrought; 2) cut with hand hammered heads or cut with
machine made heads; or 3) wire. Hand wrought nails were commonly used until the

33

Archeological Investigations at Lake Whitney, Bosque, Hill, and Johnson Counties, Texas

1800s, falling off in popularity with the introduction of cut nails. Cut nails with hand
hammered heads were popularly in use between ca. 1790 and 1825, followed by cut nails
with machine made heads which were commonly used from ca. 1825 to present. Though
they were introduced prior to the 1850s, wire nails did not become the dominant type
until the 1890s (Nelson 1968:1-10).
Before 1860, nearly all nuts, bolts, and screws made in the U.S. were either made by
blacksmiths, or made in small shops using hand tools, with limited production. As for
bolts, the small shops used square iron strips and turned them make them round and to
add threads. The end of each piece was left to form the square head. Beginning in 1859,
William Clark was granted a series of patents to manufacture bolts out of round rods,
using a machine to fashion the heads. Nut manufacturing remained much the same, using
square rods, bored through and turned on a lathe to cut the threads, and then cut in small
sections. Production was much faster, and manufactured bolts and nuts were much in
demand from that time through the present (Nuts and Bolts 2001).
The first patented machine to produce screws was designed by Job and William Wyatt in
England in 1760, and they finally opened their the worldâs first screw factory in 1776.
From 1800 to 1860, British screw factories were able to increase screw production from
fewer than 100,000 gross of screws per year to nearly 7,000,000 gross per year. The first
screw factories in the U.S. began operating in 1810 in Rhode Island. Pointed screws were
developed in 1849, Phillips-head screws were designed and perfected during the period
1860-1890, and the socket-head screw was designed in 1907. By 1900, the modern
screws as we know them today were being mass produced so that the U.S. was the
leading producer of screws in the world (Rybczynski 2000:75-86).
Window Glass
Window glass can occasionally be dated, given suitably sized samples. Archeologist
Randall Moir (1988) devised a formula to date window glass, accurate to within a span of
14 years. Moirâs formula yields a regression coefficient of .93 at a 95 percent confidence
level. The technique examines the thickness of window glass to provide an approximate
date within Â±7 years. It should be noted that the regression formula is designed for
window pane glass, but not special plate glass which is usually thicker that the upper 3.3mm parameter set for window glass (Moir 1988:264). Obviously, the date of
manufacture does not necessarily represent the date the glass was brought to the site, or
the date it was broken, but it does offer a reasonable time frame. By examining the
variations in the thicknesses of glass found on a site archeologists are sometimes able to
estimate not only when a house or barn was built, but perhaps even when, and how many
times it was renovated. Dating broken window glass sherd thicknesses has been used
successfully in south and central Texas (e.g., Gross and Meissner 1997:240-241), and
they have also been correlated with hurricanes near the Gulf Coast (Leezer 2006).

4.0 RESULTS
No previously recorded sites were located within any of the four parcels, but the
inventory discovered six new archeological sites. Three sites are present in the Nolan
River parcel and one site each in the Mesquite Creek, Brazos/Nolan and Brazos River
parcels (Table 4-1).
Five sites of the six new sites date to the historic period. All are classified as homesteads,
and together their estimated dates of occupation range from approximately A.D. 1856
through 1951. The single prehistoric site has an estimated date range of 1650 to 150 BC
(Table 4-1).
Detailed results for all sites are presented in Chapters 5-10.

5.0 SITE 41HI296 â BENJAMIN KIMBALL HOMESTEAD
This site was discovered while conducting a pedestrian survey with systematic shovel
testing in Parcel 2. It is an historic homestead with the substantial remains of a wood
house and stone chimney (Figure 5-1), along with a cistern, fenced corral and pen, water
trough, and an automobile chassis (designated Features 1 through 5). These are confined
to a 25,833 square-foot (2,400 m2) area in a wooded upland setting (Figure 5-2). Nolan
Creek courses some 300 m to the south.

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Sites 41HI296 and 41HI297 are located on the same tract of land, which consists of 274
acresâ160 of which was originally patented by Benjamin Kimball in 1873, 17 of which
belongs to the George Alford Survey, and 97 of which belongs to the Simeon Meeks
survey (Table 5-1). Both sites, however, lie within the boundaries of the Kimball Patent.
Benjamin
Kimball
(also
spelled Kimbell) was born in
North Carolina in 1809.
Research for this study has
not ascertained when he
arrived in Texas, though
according to the 1860 census
Kimball was living in Hill
County, near Fort Graham
with his wife M.E. Kimball
and their five childrenâ
Edward, George, Matilda,
Josephine, and William. The
census lists him as a 50-year
old blacksmith, with no
significant
real
estate
holdings, but with almost
$4,000 worth of personal
wealth. An 1862 deed made
in Hill County also attests to
his presence in the area. In
that year he deeded a 16-year
old female enslaved person of
African
descent
(name
illegible in the deed) to his
wife for perpetuity.
In 1873, Benjamin Kimball
patented 160 acres of land on
Figure 5-1. Site map, 41HI296.

Figure 5-2. Upland woodland setting of the Benjamin Kimball homestead, facing northeast.

Nolan Creek (then called Nolandâs River) near its confluence with the Brazos and
established a farm there (Table 5-2). The 1880 census lists him as a 72-year old farmer
living on that property in Hill County. He was living with his wife Pamelia, a son
William, a divorced daughter Matilda Baker, her young son Sterling, and a boarder who
gave his profession as a âminister of the gospel.â It is unclear whether Pamelia was the
same wife as the one indicated on the 1860 census. Neither her name, nor her age match
the 1860 census; but the place of birth, Alabama, does match. Moreover, there are also
discrepancies in Williamâs, Benjaminâs, and Matildaâs ages on the 1880 census, and so it
is possible that Pamelia is the same wife as the one listed on the 1860 census. A deed
record from 1894 (Hill County Deed Records 44/348-349) indicates that Kimball was, in
fact, married twice, and that the five children listed on the 1869 census were all children
by his second wife. He apparently divorced his first wife, L.T. Powell, as she survived
him by a month. Benjamin Kimball died in Whiteflat, Motley County in January of
1894.
Deed records show that after his death, his children sold their interest in the property
along Nolan Creek to W.D. Van Eaton and A.J. Davis. Davis probably lived on the 274acre parcel. He is listed in the 1900 census for this area, living with his wife Elizabeth.
In 1900, he was a 60-year old farmer; his wife was 58. They had no children living with

them. In later years, Davis probably became a real estate speculator, as his name appears
on many deeds in Hill County between 1900 and 1915.
In 1903, Van Eaton sold his interest in the Kimball property to Davis; then in 1904, Davis
sold the 274-acre tract to J.A. Fulbright. Fulbright agreed to pay a principal of $1,000
cash and the remainder in three notes due in 1905, 1906, and 1907 (Hill County Deed
Records 88/280). However, before the remainder of the loan came due, he sold the
property to Annie Parsons (Hill County Deed Records 99/113). Annie Parsons lived in
Hill County but likely lived on property she owned elsewhere in the county. She agreed
to take over Fulbrightâs loan as part of her deed, with notes due in 1907, 1908, and 1909.
She sold the land in 1911 to H.L. Sudderth (Hill County Deed Records 132/564).
Sudderth did live on this property, as he made a formal homestead declaration (Hill
County Deed Records 129/214) shortly after purchasing the property. He also took a
loan to pay for the property. He sold the land to Marshall Cargile, a bachelor, in 1915
(Hill County Deed Records 159/207).
Deed records suggest that by this time the property was burdened with complicated
mortgages and liens which likely prevented any of the owners from holding it for very
long. For instance, in 1914 Sudderth requested an extension on Fulbrightâs 1904 loan
that he had inherited (Hill County Deed Records 155/605). Annie Parsons meanwhile,
was not released from her financial obligations until 1917, more than six years after she
sold the property to Sudderth. And finally, Cargile was not released from his financial
obligations to Sudderth until 1925 (Hill County Deed Records 222/21). Cargile too took
a loan to pay for the property. In 1927, he still owed $765 to the Dallas Trust and
Savings Bank (Hill County Deed Records 232/639).
It is not clear how the property came to be in the possession of A. Cliett, who eventually
sold it to the United States for construction of Lake Whitney. However, Hill County
Deed records indicate that during the 1920s and early 1930s, Cliett acquired hundreds of
properties throughout Hill County. Many of these were purchased from banks or from
Sheriffâs tax sales, suggesting that he acquired them cheaply as owners defaulted on
repayment of their loans. Cliett did not live on the 274-acre Kimball tract. Yet it is
notable that the deed in which he sold the land to the United States does call out
structures located on it. It indicates that a 30 feet by 23 feet wood frame tenant house, a
smokehouse (8 feet by 12 feet), a granary with shed (10 feet by 16 feet), and inside
fences were present on the land at the time of sale (Hill County Deed Records 372/45).
These probably represent the Kimball log cabin represented at 41HI296 and various
remains represented at 41HI297.

FEATURES

5.2.1 Feature 1 â House and Chimney
Feature 1 (Figures 5-2 - 5-5) is a house measuring 15 feet (north to south) by 26 feet (east
to west). The interior of the homestead is now filled with collapsed lumber/structural

debris that was once joined using old construction techniques (e.g., dovetailing, socket
and peg, mortise-and-tongue), as well as square, machine-cut nails. It was a pier and
beam structure, with the cross beams setting on cedar posts. The foundation beams, side
wall framing studs, rafters, and wall covering planks are all made of rough, hand-hewn
wood. Small sections of the original roof planking cedar shingles attached with square,
machine-cut nails were also noted within the debris. The shingles measured 4 inches by 8
inches, and tapered from 1-inch to Â¾-inch thick. Some other construction material that
could be measured are two outer wall support beams each 6Â½ inches by 11 inches and 18
feet long, with 1Â½-inch diameter wooden pin and dovetail connections. The framing
studs measure 3Â½ inches by 3Â½ inches by 10 feet and are dovetailed into an upper cross
beam also 3Â½ inches square. Cedar posts along the southern edge of the house likely
represent the remains of a collapsed porch. As discussed above, it is likely that this house
was built by Benjamin Kimball in the late 1800s.
A very much intact and excellently crafted chimney is located on the western wall of the
house (Figures 5-4, 5-5). It is comprised of cut and hewn tabular limestone, expertly
stacked in courses and held together with fine-grained grayish mortar/Portland cement.
Cut keystones form an arch over the limestone block firebox. Its base measures 5 feet
4 inches square, and at 12 feet above ground it tapers to 3Â½ inches square. It is
approximately 24 feet tall.

included wooden pins and dovetailing, and square, machine-cut nails are still imbedded in the
beams.

Artifacts observed on the surface around the house included the following.

Â

Two galvanized metal washtubs. Galvanization was first developed in France in
1836 and by the 1880s the process was used to enhance the durability of barb wire
fences in the U.S. (Derry and Williams 1961:497-498; Galvanization 2008).
Galvanized washtubs and pails are common on early to mid-1900s historic sites.

Â

Three brown bottles with mold seams running from their bases to their lips. One
is designed to accommodate a Crown cap, âNo Deposit No Returnâ in raised
lettering. The seams and lip especially suggest a modern method of manufacture.
Until the late 1950s, beer and soda bottles were returned to the manufacturer who
paid a voluntary minimal fee for their return because bottles were cheaper to
recycle than to produce. However, as the cost of making bottles got cheaper,
bottlers stopped paying for returned bottles and some manufacturers placed the
âNo Deposit No Returnâ markings on their products. In 1971, Oregon passed the
first law in the nation requiring deposits be placed on bottles to encourage
recycling. This bottle dates from the 1950s or 1960s.

Â

Four pieces of galvanized and corrugated roofing metal 3-foot by 4-foot; these
probably date to the early 1900s through the present.

Â

Two stoneware sherds with Bristol glaze; commonly produced from about 1920
through 1950 (Greer 1981).

Â

A car door from the automobile chassis (designated Feature 3).

Â

A clear glass jar base with a makerâs mark of a large âHâ over an âA.â This mark
was adopted for use by the Hazel Atlas Glass Company in 1921. Hazel Atlas
continued in operation through 1964 (Toulouse 1971:55; 1977:4).

Â

Four tin cans with sanitary, crimped side seals - These could date from the 1890s,
through the present (Busch 1981:26; Fontana and Greenleaf 1962:69).

Â

A metal beer can with church key opening â Beer distributors began marketing
beer in flat top cans in 1935, and the church key can opener was designed at that
time. The need for a church key to open beer cans was replaced in the 1960s by
the design of the pull tab top (Church Key 2008).

Â

A clear glass Mason jar lid â Mason jars lids were manufactured as early as the
1860s, (Toulouse 1977:298), but the clarity of the glass on this specimen suggests
a manufacture date after 1930 (Munsey 1970).

5.2.2 Feature 2 - Cistern
Feature 2 is a barrel-shaped, limestone-lined cistern located 10 feet fom the northeast
corner of the house (Figure 5-6). Its interior dimension is 5 feet 6 inches, and it is now
more than 11 feet to its debris-filled bottom. It has been constructed of hewn limestone
held in place with coarse mortar, and plaster still remains on its interior near the bottom.
The shaped limestone blocks range in size from 2 inches by 4 inches to 4 inches by 16
inches, and are arranged in no apparent courses. Smaller chinking stones have been
placed in between the larger blocks. Deteriorated lumber slats partially covered the
cistern, and on the surface was a piece of sheet metal 3 feet 4 inches long, and shaped as
if to cover the edge of a board. Other observations included a stone footing extending 5
feet to the west of the cistern.

5.2.3 Feature 3 â Automobile Chassis
Feature 3 is a rusted metal car chassis of a 1936 Ford Deluxe Four Door Touring Sedan
(Figure 5-7). It was discovered rolled over into a shallow pit 70 feet south of the house.
One of its spring seats with the cloth or leather material missing lay outside on the
ground, and the interior of the vehicle was generally stripped. A few wooden posts with
barbed wire were on the inside. Several bullet holes were observed in the carâs body. On
the bottom of one of the door frames was a circle with a âVâ and â8â inside it, indicating
it originally had an 8-cylinder engine. Three Davis, Wizard High Speed nylon, blackwall
tires were found nearby. All three were size 6.50-16, and carried a 6-ply nylon rating.
One had a makerâs mark with âWâ and an âAâ inside a shield under a half circle. The
maker could not be determined, but nylon tires were first introduced on the market by
Goodyear in 1947 (Pneumatic Tires 2008). Also nearby was a broken farm implement
disk used on the rear gang of a tandem disk harrow (Ramsower 2001:279), with âLONGâ
in raised lettering, and an âMâ inside a triangle. The identity of the manufacturer has not
been ascertained.

5.2.4 Feature 4 â Fenced Corral and Pen
Feature 4 is a fenced corral with a collapsed pen on one corner (Figure 5-8). They are
located approximately 220 feet (67 m) southwest of the house. The corral measures 25
feet (north to south) by 82 feet (east to west) with a 16-foot opening in the middle of the
north fence, and the pen measures 16-foot square and opens into the corral. The corral is
constructed of cedar posts about 5 feet apart, with woven wire to 3 feet above the ground
and a strand of barbed wire above that. The pen enclosure was constructed of cedar posts
measuring 4 to 5 inches in diameter and 10 feet in length. Corrugated, galvanized tin was
used to either cover it or enclose it. Numerous round and square, cut nails were scattered
around the surface. When these structures were constructed and used is not clear. The
square nails suggest a time frame from 1835 to 1900, while the round nails suggest a
post-1900 time frame. The galvanized tin also suggests a post-1900 time frame.

SHOVEL TESTING

Following a 100-percent pedestrian survey of the site, ten shovel tests were placed on and
around the site to determine the horizontal extent and vertical depth of cultural deposits,
as well as to evaluate site integrity. Sterile intractable clay was encountered between 3050 cmbs. Artifacts were recovered in nine of the ten tests and a total of 133 artifacts were

collected, plus concrete chunks. The artifacts recovered by shovel test and depth are
listed in Appendix B. A discussion of Unique Items (UIs) recovered during the shovel
testing phase follows. The entire artifact assemblage will be synthesized in conjunction
with the excavation results.

5.3.1 Unique Items from Shovel Tests
Â

Medicine bottle. This small whole bottle was found in Shovel Test 7, 0-20 cmbs.
It is made of clear glass and exhibits only a slight amethyst hue and coating of
patina (Figure 5-9). It has mold seams on opposite corners running from its base
to the top of its lip, suggesting a manufacture date of post-1903. Its lip is
designed for a cork or rubber stopper with presumably a glass dropper attached.
On its base are the raised letters âGETS IT.â Its contents are presumed to have
been for medicinal purposes. Based upon its color and hue, it presumably was
manufactured between 1880 and 1915.

Â

Composition button. This specimen is made of a composition material. It has
been formed in a single mold and includes a self shank on its back (Figure 5-9).
They are called composition buttons because they are made from a mixture or
conglomeration of organic materials such as wood fibers or guttapercha latex,
bound together by shellac and rubber (Pool 1987:286). Composition buttons were
generally manufactured in the U. S. between1875-1925, but reached their peak in
popularity
between
1870-1900 (Brown 1942:
43).
This particular
specimen is a line 32
(size), suggesting it was
used on a shirt or dress
(Meissner 1997:125). It
was found in Shovel Test
2 between 0-20 cmbs.

Â

Wood screw. This metal
wood screw was found
in Shovel Test 1 between
20-40 cmbs. It measures
1Â¼-inches and machine
manu-factured with a
head designed for a flathead screwdriver (Figure
5-9). A screw of this
type is commonly used
in door hinges. The first
screws manufactured by
machines were produced

in 1776 (Rybczynski 2000:75).
Â

5.4

Bisque sherd. In addition, a bisque sherd from a doll was recovered in Shovel
Test 6, 0-20 cmbs (not illustrated). Prior to 1880, most ceramic dolls were made
of porcelain and imported from China (Doll Collecting 2008a). Shortly after
1880, a type of ceramic called bisque became the preferred material for making a
childâs doll. Bisque is actually an unglazed porcelain. Dolls with bisque heads
only were popular from about 1880 through perhaps 1910, whole-body bisque
dolls were popular from about 1890 through 1930 (Doll Collecting 2008b).
CONTROLLED EXCAVATIONS

Based upon the positive results of shovel testing two controlled excavation units were
placed on the site. Unit 1 was located 50 cm east of ST2, and was dug through clay loam
with gravels before encountering sterile clay 30 cmbs (Figure 5-10). Unit 2 was placed
50 cm east of ST1. Excavators here encountered clay loam with gravels throughout to 45
cmbs. In addition, the outline of a historic/modern pit feature was encountered during
excavations (Figure 5-11). Numerous historic artifacts were encountered within the
boundaries of the feature: a total of 597 artifacts were recovered, in addition to a femur
from a small mammal, and 50 grams of unidentifiable metal chunks and fragments
(Appendix B).

5.4.1 Unique Items from Excavation Units
Â

Harmonica Frame. Figure 5-12 shows a part of a harmonica frame, indicating
that someone in the family likely played the harmonica for enjoyment,
entertainment, and a pastime. It was recovered from Unit 2, Level 2.

Â

Edgeware. A rim sherd of green edgeware with cream-colored paste (Figure 512) was found in Unit 1, Level 2. Underglaze green edged creamwares were
common until around 1840, but were still being produced through about 1890
(Miller 1991:6).

Â

Ointment jar. A small ointment or salve jar (Figure 5-12) was found in Unit 2,
Level 1. It has been broken in half so that only part of a makers mark remains on
its base. The raised letters are âJ Mâ or âJ H,â and âLLAN.â Without additional
information we were unable to determine the manufacturer. However, other
attributes of the specimen allow for an approximate period of manufacture. No
side mold seams are present, but the base seam is well-made and smooth,
suggesting a two-mold, modern machine process after 1903. In addition, it is dark
brown with a medium coating of patina, and would suggest a date of manufacture
around 1900. However, it has a screw-top with a beaded shoulder seal, a
technique developed in 1915 (Toulouse 1977:298). Thus, we can presume that
this specimen was made some time between 1915 and perhaps 1950.

Â

Bone button. This specimen is nearly whole (Figure 5-12), and was found in Unit
2, Level 1. It is a 4-hole, and has been made with a machine. Although bone
buttons were produced from about 1900-1930 in the U.S., the four-hole, machinemade variety were typically produced beginning in around 1850. Overall, the
peak popularity period for wearing bone buttons in the U. S. was from about 1830
through 1890. This particular button is a line 30 (size), suggesting it was used on
a shirt or dress.

Â

Metal button. This is a Sanders type 3-piece button (Figure 5-12). It was
recovered in Unit 2, 0-20m cmbs, and is a line 30 (size), suggesting it was used on
shirt or dress (Meissner 1997:125). In 1823, Benjamin Sanders invented this
button manufacturing technique that consists of a domed face plate filled with
paper, a back plate, and a loop shank for sewing the thread through. The domed
face of this specimen has been formed out of brass, while the back and loop shank
are made out of ferrous metals. As such, the back is heavily rusted and the loop

Ecological Communications Corporation

Archeological Investigations at Lake Whitney, Bosque, Hill, and Johnson Counties, Texas

shank is all but gone. Although many of the 3-piece buttons were stamped on the
face and/or back, there is no evidence of stamping on this specimen. The 3-piece
buttons were being made in England as early as 1823, and were imported to the
U.S. The three piece button type caught on, and the U.S. has been producing
them and other buttons in mass since around 1865. The metal 3-piece buttons are
still being produced today (Pool 1987:277-281).
Â

Stone marble Figure 5-12 shows one half of a limestone marble found in Unit 2,
between 20-30 cmbs. It measures â-inch in diameter, and has a brown glazed
surface. Stone marbles were commonly produced in Germany beginning in the
1700s and were commercially exported to other countries. Peak production
periods of stone marbles occurred in the mid-1700s, and again in the mid-1800s.
By the 1930s, the production of stone marbles in Germany had all but ceased.
Overall, German toys were shipped in mass to the U.S. through the start of World
War I in 1914 (Alanâs Marble Connection 2008; Zapata 1997:100-118).

Â

Hinge. This broken hinge was found in Unit 1, 0-20 cmbs (Figure 5-12). It is
made of ferrous metal, age unknown.

Â

Blind bracket. A ferrous metal window blind bracket was recovered from Unit 2,
0-20 cmbs. This bracket would have accommodated the end of a spring-wound
blind (Figure 5-12).

Â

Lamp chimney sherd. A machine-beaded chimney rim sherd to a kerosene lamp
was found in Unit 1 between 10-20 cmbs (Figure 5-12). By 1864, kerosene lamps
were very common in the U.S. At that time, most chimney rims were
undecorated, but some were decorated by hand. Although decorated chimney
rims became popular in the U.S. in the 1870s, a machine for producing the beaded
rim decoration was not patented until 1883 (Woodhead et al. 1984:61). It is not
known when electricity came to 41HI296, but nevertheless, kerosene lamps may
have been used or curated well after that time, arbitrarily through 1950.

Â

Unidentifiable Metal Piece. In Unit 4 between 0-20 cmbs, a non-ferrous metal
item measuring 2 inches long (Figure 5-12) was uncovered. It is curved on both
ends, and tiny notches are evenly spaced along one edge. The other edge is raised
and rounded. We are unable to determine its usage.

Â

Mocha Ware. This soft paste creamware sherd has a buff background, light
brown and olive green banded rim, and a pink rose decoration (Figure 5-12).
Mocha ware was most commonly produced and used in the U.S. from about
1800-1920 (Mocha Ware 2008a,b; Rogers 2005).

Â

Redware. Three highly fired redware body sherds exhibit a fine red paste, and are
coated with a dark brown lead glaze on both their interiors and exteriors (Figure
5-12). They were recovered from Unit 1 between 0-10 cm, and Unit 2, between
0-20 cm and 20-30 cm. Although redwares were being produced in the U.S. in

Ecological Communications Corporation

51

Archeological Investigations at Lake Whitney, Bosque, Hill, and Johnson Counties, Texas

the 1600s and redwares with lead glazes have been found in many of the Spanish
Colonial missions in Texas (e.g., Fox 2000), these three specimens have been
very hard fired. Their finely made attributes would seem to indicate a date of
production in the early to mid 20th century, considering the refinement of kilns
and firing techniques in later times.
Â

Hutchinson-type bottle stopper wire. Although somewhat mangled and broken,
this item appears to be the wire portion of a spring bottle stopper very similar to
the Hutchinson type (Figure 5-12). If not a Hutchinson, it could be from any of
dozens of spring wire and rubber or cork seals patented in the 1870s and 1880s. It
was found in Unit 2, 0-20 cmbs. Stoppers for soda and beer bottles first patented
in 1859 were primarily ball stoppers, but by 1879 William H Hutchinson had
designed the spring stopper that bares his name. A Hutchinson type stopper
spring with the rubber seal also missing was found at Sebastopol State Historical
Park in Guadalupe County (Sauer et al. 1998:76). Hutchinsonâs design called for
a shorter wire, thus allowing bottle manufactures to produce bottles with shorter
necks (Odell 2007). This specimen has a longer spring, suggesting it may predate 1879. Nevertheless, the Crown cap design virtually replaced all other
stopper types by 1920.

Â

Bottle spring stopper wire. This item (Figure 5-12) was found in Unit 2, between
0-10 cmbs. It would have served that same function as the Hutchison type
stopper. It is also missing its rubber seal. It somewhat similar in design to the
Hutchinson, except it is much shorter, suggesting that it was the seal for a much
shorter-necked bottle, and would then likely post-date the Hutchinson design of
1879. Nevertheless, it also would have been replaced by the Crown seal by 1920.

5.4.2 Other Diagnostic Items
Three undecorated glass sherds that appear to be from a kerosene lamp globe or lantern
chimney were found in Unit 1, between 10-20 cmbs. The concept of fuel burning lamps
was first patented in 1784, but it wasnât until 1864 that kerosene became readily available
as a fuel source in the U.S. and kerosene lamps became the norm (Woodhead et al.
1984:58).
A total of 86 window glass sherds were found at the site: one in Shovel test 2, 0-20 cm;
86 in Unit 2 0-10 cm; and two in Unit 2, 10-20 cm. All were measured to the nearest
millimeter, and ranged in thickness from 2.0 mm to 5.0 mm. Seven thickness modes
became apparent; correlating to mean dates of 1881, 1898, 1906, 1940, 1944, 1948, and
1965. A review of Appendix B indicates that although only two sherds came from the
lower of the two levels in Unit 2, their thicknesses date them to 1881 and 1940. In
addition, glass of various thicknesses dating them from 1881 through 1965 were found in
Level 1, suggesting that significant mixing has occurred.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

5.5.1 Periods of Occupation
Archival research indicates that this site is located on a 160-acre tract of land patented by
Benjamin Kimball in 1873, and according to census records he was living on the tract and
conducting farming operations no later than 1880. Whether he built the house prior to, or
after that year has not been ascertained, but the archives strongly suggest that he, his wife
and children, and a boarder quite possibly lived there from about. 1873 through 1893.
The property was then sold in 1894 to A. J. Davis who was also a farmer and who lived
on the property with his wife. He apparently occupied the house from about. 1894
through 1900, or perhaps later. In 1911, the tract was purchased by H. L. Sudderth who
lived on the property from about 1911 through 1915.
It is unclear who may have lived in the house after that. But, when the property was sold
to the U.S. Government in 1952, the seller made note of a 23 by 30 foot wood frame
tenant house. These measurements correspond to the archeological measurements of
Feature 11. Thus it appears that this is the same structure which was referred to in the
1952 document. Since the seller called the building a âtenantâ house,â presumably it was
occupied in 1952 by renters.
With those facts in mind, we next examined the approximated ages of artifacts found on
the surface, and in shovel tests and excavation units. Figure 5-13 illustrates the likely
time period of occupations. Assuming the earliest occupation (as suggested by the
archival information) is 1873, then those artifacts that could date prior to then would have
to be either curated keepsakes, or they could have been brought to the site initially in
1873. For example, the limestone marble and the metal button both long periods of
production and use both before and after 1873. The edgeware dinner sherd may have
been a curatorial keepsake, as edgeware was considered a fancier ware that just plain
undecorated whiteware at the time.
As shown in Figure 5-13, there are also items that could date to well after the year 1952,
when the house was sold to the government. Once again, those items have long periods
of production and use. By discounting the artifacts that could date before the 1870s and
those that could date to after the 1950s, a core group of diagnostic artifacts demonstrate a
continuum of site occupation from about 1870 through about 1950. These data appear to
corroborate the occupation periods implied by the archival research.
In summary, the archival and artifact data suggest the following occupations:
Â

1874-1888. The house was presumably built and occupied by the Benjamin
Kimball family.

1

The house foundation was archeologically measured as 15 feet wide; an 8-foot porch would bring the total
dimension to 23 feet. The length was measured as 26 feet, not including the chimney base. Including the
3.5 foot chimney base, the total length is approximately 30 feet.

Â

1891-1905. The house was presumably occupied by the Benjamin Kimball family
and then by A. J. Davis and wife.

Â

1899-1913. The house was presumably occupied by A.J. Davis and H.L.
Sudderth.

Â

1913-1955. The occupants, either owners or tenants, are unknown.

Â

1952. The property was sold to the U. S. Government and is salvaged and/or falls
into disrepair.

Â

1958-1972. Artifacts suggest non-occupation activities including perhaps
picnicking and/or trash dumping.

5.5.2 Summary and Recommendation
Archival research indicates that Benjamin D. Kimball was the original patentee for the land
and the original builder of the house at 41HI296. The artifacts at the site suggest an
occupation continuum from the early 1860s through about 1950. Benjamin Kimball was an
early settler of Hill County. He lived first in the Fort Graham area, working as a
blacksmith, then in 1873 purchased the land encompassing Site 41HI296. He owned the
property until his death, and lived on the property at least through 1880, as he is listed in
the census for that part of Hill County in that year. After his death in 1894 in Motley

54

Archeological Investigations at Lake Whitney, Bosque, Hill, and Johnson Counties, Texas

County, the property was owned for brief periods by several families who did live also live
there, then it was occupied by tenants until it was sold to the USACE.
Though neither Kimball himself, nor any of the subsequent owners and tenants seem to
have made a major impression during the Hill Countyâs overall course of development, the
Kimball property, and the home Kimball constructed, represent good examples of a
farmstead related to the early period of settlement for Hill County. Though the house itself
has been nearly destroyed, there are other intact components such as the fireplace with
chimney and the cistern, in addition to yard features that do have artifacts. With further
archival study and archeological field research the site may be determined to have potential
to inform studies of early farming and settlement in the region. At the present time
however, the NRHP eligibility of the site is uncertain.

6.0 SITE 41HI297
Site 41HI297 consists of the razed remains of an early to mid-20th century homestead.
Scattered surface artifacts, a concentration of shaped limestone boulders, a trash midden,
and two shallow depressions are situated within a 77,500 square-foot (7,200 m2) area.
(Figure 6-1).
6.1

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Site 41HI297 is on the same 160-acre tract patented to Benjamin Kimball in 1873 (see
Table 5-1), and lies 660 feet (200 m) southeast of the Kimball house (41HI296). This
wooded upland area gently slopes toward an unnamed drainage to the west and southwest
(Figure 6-2).
6.2

FEATURES

6.2.1 Feature 1 â
Trash Midden
Feature 1 is an historic
midden deposit covering an
area approximately 6 m in
diameter and sets on the
north edge of a small
drainage (Figure 6-3).
Some artifacts are eroding
downslope. One diagnostic
bottle base was collected
from the surface.
This
specimen (Figure 6-4) is
made of clear, frosted
glass, and exhibits an
amethyst hue. It is wellmade and exhibits no side
mold seams or a mold seam
attaching
the
base,
indicating it was made in a
modern machine one-piece
mold. Raised letters on the
base are âNO. 71; PAT. IN
U.S.; JULY 17, 1906;
DEC. 22, 1908; 2 M.â Its
clarity and hue suggest a
manufacturing date between

1885-1915, while the type of mold
it was made in suggests a date of
manufacture after 1903. The â2
Mâ makerâs mark indicates it was
manufactured by the Maryland
Glass Corporation in Baltimore,
Maryland.
Maryland
Glass
installed its initial two Owens
automatic bottling machines in
1915, and used the âMâ trademark
only up until 1916 (Toulouse
1971:339-341). Thus, by process
of elimination, it appears that this
specimen was manufactured in
1915. Other artifacts observed on
the surface but not collected
include the following.
Â

Two undecorated whiteware sherds. These could
date from ca. 1860-present.

Â

Rusted tin cans. Of 31

cans observed, 25 have
machine crimped, modern
sanitary seals that could date from the 1890s through the present. One, however,
is of the soldered hole-in-top variety manufactured from 1839 through the 1890s
(Busch 1981:26; Fontana and Greenleaf 1962:69).

Â

One-gallon paint cans. Twelve were observed; dates are indeterminate.

Â

Galvanized washtub fragments. The galvanization process was developed in
1836 (Derry and Williams 1961:497-498; Galvanization 2008) and galvanized
washtubs and pails are common on early to mid-1900s historic sites.

Â

Metal items. Miscellaneous metal items include barrel hoops, bed springs, a thin,
round sheet metal piece 24 inches in diameter, metal straps with holes, a pipe
fitting, barbed wire strands, a truck fender.

Â

Enamel coated tin ware. One bucket is coated with black enamel, and one coffee
pot lid is coated with white enamel. The process of coating tinwares with enamel
was perfected in Mexico in the 1870s, and by the late 1880s was very popular in
the U.S. It can still be found for sale today (Enamelware History 2008).

Â

Glass. Numerous glass items include:
Â
22 clear bottle shards;

more than 100 window glass shards;
one whole clear glass bottle, with molded spider web design and âHALF
PINTâ âFEDERAL LAW FORBIDS SALE OR REUSE OF THIS
BOTTLEâ, screw-top lip - this inscription was required on whiskey bottles
from 1943 through 1964 (Odell 2008b);
one clear glass ketchup bottle with screw-top - dates to post-1930;
one clear glass perfume bottle with ribbed design, screw-top - dates to
post-1930; and
one Depression dinnerware sherd, clear frosted with sunflower pattern on
bottom â dates to post-1930 (Schroy 2000:237).

Bricks. A total of five brick fragments were found. Four have a makerâs mark
indicating they were manufactured by the Navarro Brick Company; dates of plant
operation not known. One brick fragment has a makerâs mark of the VVV Brick
Company in Neodesha, Kansas. It could not be ascertained when VVV was
established, but it was manufacturing bricks by 1904, and closed ca. 1945 (Belden
Brick Company 2007; Connelly 1918).

6.2.2 Feature 2 â Limestone and Brick Scatter
Feature 2 is a scatter of 20 large limestone rocks and a single brick fragment within an
area 5 m in diameter (Figure 6-5). One rock was likely a cornerstone. The brick fragment
has a partial makerâs mark of ââ¦BRICK &â¦â AND ââ¦DESHAâ¦,â indicating it could
have been made by the Lumbermanâs Supply Company (Lusco) Brick & Stone
Company. Lusco was founded in 1907, and bought the VVV Brick Company in
Neodesha, Kansas within a few years after that. The VVV brick plant in Neodesha went
out of business in about 1945 (Belden Brick Company 2007; Connelly 1918). VVV
brick fragments were also found in the trash midden designated as Feature 1.

6.2.3 Feature 3 â Depression
Feature 3 is an oval shaped depression of unknown use or origin located east of the stone
and brick scatter designated as Feature 2. The depression is approximately 4 m in
diameter and approximately 80 cm deep in the center. No artifacts were observed on the
surface, but a single shovel test placed within its center was positive; this is discussed in
the following section.

6.2.4 Feature 4 â Depression
A second depression was located to the northeast of the stone and brick scatter and was
designated Feature 4. This depression was also 4 m in diameter, but was somewhat
shallower, at approximately 40 cm deep. No artifacts were observed on the surface. Its
use and origin are also unknown.

6.3

SHOVEL TESTING

Following a 100-percent pedestrian survey of the site, seven shovel tests were placed on
and around the site to determine the horizontal extent and vertical depth of cultural
deposits, as well as to evaluate their integrity. Sterile intractable clay was encountered
between 10-30 cmbs. Three of the tests were positive, with a total of four artifacts
recovered from the shovel tests (Appendix B).

6.3.1 Unique Items from Shovel Tests
Â

Tin can. The top half of a tin can that appears to have held one quart was found in
Shovel Test 1-3, between 0-40 cm beneath the surface. It is crushed and rusted
through (Figure 6-6). It is not a hole-in-top, but rather has a sanitary, crimpsealed lid. Hole-in-top cans were manufactured from 1839 through the 1890s,
eventually being replaced by open-top sanitary cans still in use today (Busch
1981:26; Fontana and Greenleaf 1962:69). In the center lid of this particular
specimen is a stamped circle with a capital âGâ stamped inside it, and the words
âGeneral Can Co. Chicagoâ stamped around the circle. A search of the internet
for General Can Company produced no information about the company.

Caboose Marker Lamp.
This unique item was found
in Shovel Test 1-3, 0-40
cmbs near Feature 3, a
shallow pit. It is identified
as a passenger service
caboose marker kerosene
lamp (Figure 6-7). The
lamp measures 26 by 16 cm
and is marked with âSanta
Feâ mark on bottom and the
serial number S24284. The
âSanta Feâ mark indicates
that it was manufactured by
Adams & Westlake &
Company of New York,
Chicago, and Philadelphia
(Roundhouse Acres 2008;
Adams Lanterns 2008).
This is the Adalke Kero 250
model, produced between
about 1926 and 1930
(Adalke Lantern 2008).
Santa Fe Rule 19 states that
signals will be displayed to
the rear of every train, as
markers, to indicate the rear
of the train.
The most
common marker lamps from
around 1900-1950 were oil
lamps carried on brackets on
the corners of the caboose.
A red lens was always
placed in the lamp so that it
faced to the rear, with either
amber or green lenses in the
front and side openings.
Santa Fe rules state that
amber lenses must be on the
side and front openings. In
the late 1950s and 1960s,
reflectors replaced many
traditional
lamps
(Sperandeo 2008).

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Although site 41HI297 is located on the 160-acre tract of land patented in 1873 by
Benjamin Kimball, the approximated ages of the artifacts suggest an occupation period
after 1930 through perhaps 1945. Archival research indicates that the property was
owned by a series of owners during that time frame through several complicated and
convoluted acquisition and financing maneuvers. Whether any of them actually lived on
the property could not be ascertained. The inhabitants of what was likely a small frame
house at this site are unknown, and no artifacts were found that could infer occupation or
family structure.
The structures that existed at this site, if any, have been razed, and no intact cultural
deposits were encountered during shovel testing. An analysis of the artifacts suggest an
occupation period of no earlier than perhaps 1930. A search of the internet and local
archives revealed no significant information about the occupants that suggest they made a
significant contribution to the area, region, or state. Its location on the landscape could
lend itself to a further study of historic settlement patterns in rural areas in north-central
Texas. Otherwise, we assess the site as having no significant research value that could
contribute to the history of the region or the state. We recommend that site 41HI297 be
considered as not eligible for nomination to the NRHP.

7.0 SITE 41HI298
Site 41HI298 consists of the razed remains of an early to mid-20th century homestead.
Archival research suggests that two structures may have been at this location.
Recognizable features include a partially intact chimney, a concrete grain silo, and an
historic trash midden (Figure 7-1). These cover approximately one acre on what is now a
level flood plain created by the construction of the Lake Whitney Dam. The site appears
to have been underwater at some point in recent history, as evidenced by modern debris
observed 3 m above the ground surface in nearby trees. Numerous large willow trees up
to 1 m in diameter were observed growing in the center of the house location (Figure 72).
7.1

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

41HI298 is located on a 640-acre tract originally patented by George Meeks in 1851
(Table 7-1). The complete
chain of title for the property
has not been researched for
the dates prior to 1897, since
the features present at this site
are clearly of twentieth
century origin. Between 1897
and 1925, the property was
owned
exclusively
by
absentee landowners.
In
1897,
William
Phelps
acquired 829 acres of land in
Hill and Johnson Counties
from
M.M.
Dickinson.
Dickinson was a resident of
North Carolina; Phelps was a
resident of Apache County,
Arizona (Hill County Deed
Records 50/248). During the
late 1890s, Phelps acquired 10
tracts of land in Hill and
Johnson County totaling
several
thousand
acres.
Though Phelps lived in
Arizona for most his life, a
deed from 1907 suggests that
he died in Hill County. His
children, however, were all
residents of New Mexico or

Arizona (Hill County Deed Records (Hill County Deed Records 92/635). When he died,
he left his property in Hill and Johnson Counties to his grandson, William Phelps Greer, a
resident of El Paso (referenced in Hill County Deed Records 92/635). William Greer and
his wife Ethel Greer held onto the land until 1924, though apparently never paid taxes on
it. Eight hundred and twenty seven acres of the land, including all of the George Meek
640 acres, was made over to the Alliance Trust Company through a sheriffâs deed in
1924. The following year the Alliance Trust Company sold the same tract to William
Burton, who sold the land the same day to E.A. Walls and his wife, Sarah Elizabeth (Hill
County Deed Records 304/291).
Walls is listed in the 1930 census as living in the Hill County 6th Justice Precinct, which
is where 41HI298 is situated. He gave his profession as a farmer, who owned his
property. He lived with his wife, a son, and two daughters. An older married son, Edgar
Jr., lived in the residence next door with his wife. The Walls owned the property until
1950, when they sold it the U.S. prior to construction of Lake Whitney.

FEATURES

7.2.1 Feature 1 - Chimney and House Remains
Feature 1 is a partially standing chimney constructed of hewn, stacked limestone blocks
with gray mortar. One face of the front of the chimney is covered with concrete,
apparently as an interstice filling between the chimney and the frame of the house (Figure
7-3). In addition to numerous pieces of clearly modern trash, artifacts observed on the
surface around the house area include the following.
Â

Glass items. One whole bottle of brown glass with a screw-top and a makerâs
mark of âAâ inside a circle and â62â in raised inscription was observed. This
mark was manufactured by the American Glass Works between 1908-1935 and
also by Armstrong Cork Company, Glass Division between 1938-1969. The â62â

is likely a mark used by Armstrong when they manufactured this bottle in 1962.
Also found were three clear glass bottles with â11â inscription; the date of these
bottles is indeterminate.
Â

Metal items. Metal artifacts in association with the chimney Feature 1 included a
leaf spring, presumably from an automobile, and a galvanized #3 washtub of the
type commonly found on early to mid twentieth century sites in Texas.

7.2.2 Feature 2 â Silo
Feature 2 is a concrete silo measuring 15 feet tall, 13 feet in diameter, and with 5 inch
thick walls located approximately 70 m east of Feature 1 (Figure 7-4). Rounded river
gravels of various sizes provide a coarse matrix for the concrete. The structure has three
openings. A large lower door opening measures 2 feet by 4 feet and has a square top and
a rounded bottom. To the right of this opening is a square window or chute opening
measuring 12 inches square. An upper door opening is directly above the lower door and
also measures 2 feet by 4 feet. A square bolt protruding through the wall to the right of
the lower door opening, with a nut, washer, and loosely hanging wire, apparently served
as a latching for the now-missing door. The interior of the silo was empty except for
rusty baling wire mounded to 60 cm high. There was no roof on the structure during the

No
artifacts were observed on
the ground surface around
the silo.

7.2.3 Feature 3 â
Trash Midden
Trash scattered on the
surface southwest of the
house on the edge of the
flood plain covers an area
about 4 m in diameter and
was designated as Feature
3. Two whole bottles were
collected from this feature
(Figure 7-5).

modern
sealing point and mold seams from its base all the way to the top of its lip. The
lip has been smoothed and polished. Deformities in the glass include parallel
striations running from top to bottom developed during the molding process, and
slight crazing from being exposed to sunlight. Mold designs include three parallel
lines running from its base to just below its shoulders. The base bears a raised
makers mark of a âJâ inside a raised keystone figure. This is the mark of the
Knox Glass Bottle Company of Mississippi in Jackson, Mississippi. This mark
was used beginning in 1932, and through the 1950s (Lockhart 2004; Toulouse
1971:271-272; 1977:298).

Â

Dr. PepperÂ© bottle. A clear glass Dr. PepperÂ© bottle was found on the surface
within Feature 2. On one side it has the iconic â10-2-4â on a raised letter,
circular, and dimpled clock face. Below that in raised letters is â6Â½ OZSâ. On
the reverse side is âDr. Pepper,â with âGOOD FOR LIFE!â inside a banner.
Although the 10-2-4 clock has been used on Dr. PepperÂ© bottles since 1926, this
particular design was invented by John B. OâHara and filed for patent on July 15,
1929 (Odell 2003; Peacock Collectibles 2008). This specimen is made of clear

Miscellaneous items. Other items included: a rubber boot heel with tack âXKâ
stamped inside; two rubber shoe or boot soles, size 2Â½; and one red brick

SHOVEL TESTING

Following a 100-percent pedestrian survey of the site, seven shovel tests were placed on
and around the site to determine the horizontal extent and vertical depth of cultural
deposits, as well as to evaluate their integrity. Five of the seven tests were positive
recovering a total of 142 artifacts between 0-40 cmbs. Also recovered were 87 grams of
unidentifiable nail types and metal fragments covered with coarse concrete. The artifacts
recovered are listed by shovel test and depth in Appendix B. The majority of subsurface
artifacts (88 percent) were encountered in ST1 located within Feature 3, a trash midden.
Intractable sterile clay was encountered during excavations between 5-40 cmbs.

7.3.1 Artifacts from Shovel Tests
Unique Items recovered from the shovel test on 41HI298 include the following
Â

Safety pin. A broken safety pin was recovered between 0-20 cmbs in Shovel Test
1 (Figure 7-6). The safety pin as we know it today was invented and patented by
Walter Hunt in 1849 (Byars 2002).

Â

Barb. This ferrous metal item found in Shovel Test 1 between 0-20 cmbs appears
to be a barb from a strand of barbed wire (Figure 7-6). Barbs of this type were
patented in the 1870s. This one most resembles the Swanâs âHâ Plate, patented in
1879 by Frank Swan of Joliet, Illinois, the Watkinsâ Vee Plate patented in 1876
by William Watkins of Joliet, Illinois, and the Cherry-Wheelerâs Double Diamond
patented in 1877 by Hamilton Cherry and Harry Wheeler of Aurora, Illinois
(Clifton 1970:188-194). Although these types were patented in the 1870s, we are
unable to determine how long they were in use on farms and ranches throughout
Texas.

headstamped with the
letter âUâ inside a circle. Rim fire cartridges were produced beginning about
1845, and the .22 caliber bullet was developed for the Smith & Wesson First
Model revolver in 1857. The âUâ on this specimen indicates it was manufactured
by the Remington Arms-Union Metallic Cartridge Company in Bridgeport
Connecticut (Headstamp Codes 2006:45). Remington and Union Metallic were
combined into the Remington Union Metallic Company in 1912 at Bridgeport, but
the company was closed in November 1946 (Remington 2008). Although bullets
remain in firing condition for years if stored properly, we conclude that the
specimen found in Shovel Test 5 had to have been manufactured no earlier than
1912 and no later than 1946.

Other items found in the shovel tests included three undecorated glass sherds that appear
to be from a kerosene lamp globe or lantern chimney were found in Shovel Test 1,
between 0-20 cmbs. The concept of fuel burning lamps was first patented in 1784, but it
was not until 1864 that kerosene became readily available as a fuel source in the U.S. and
kerosene lamps became the norm (Woodhead et al. 1984:58).
Two slate fragments were found in Unit 2, 10-20 cmbs and another came from in Unit 3,
10-20 cmbs. No other slate material was observed on the site, suggesting that it was not

Archeological Investigations at Lake Whitney, Bosque, Hill, and Johnson Counties, Texas

likely used as roof construction material, but rather may represents a slate board for
writing. Although the slate board could have been used during the earliest occupation of
this site, slate boards were also being used well after the turn of the twentieth century.

7.4

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Although this site is located on a tract of land patented in 1851, the archives indicate that
it was not likely lived on until shortly after E. A. and Sarah Elizabeth Walls purchased
the property in December 1924. They apparently lived there through 1950 when they
sold the land to the government. This period of occupation is corroborated by a
predominance of the estimated ages of the artifacts. Although the archives indicate that E.
A. and Sarah had a son and two daughters living with them, the artifact assemblage
contains no items clearly associated with the children other than the fragments of slate.
In addition, their oldest son supposedly was married and living ânext door.â No evidence
was found of a second house nearby. It could be that ânext doorâ means down the road,
or the house could be under Lake Whitney. Upon further review of a series of historic
aerial photos of the area, it appears there may have been another structure just over onehalf mile to the east-northeast along a dirt road leading from 41HI298. However, no
evidence of a structure was found at that location.
Except for the silo, all the structures that existed at this site have been completely razed
and no evidence of intact cultural deposits was encountered during shovel testing. A
search of the internet and local archives revealed no significant information about the
occupants to suggest they made a significant contribution to the area, region, or state.
Analysis of the artifact assemblage suggests an occupation period between 1925 and
1950. As with 41HI297, the location of this site on the landscape could lend itself to a
further study of historic settlement patterns in rural areas in north-central Texas.
Otherwise, we assess the site as having no significant research value that could contribute
to our understanding of the history of the region or the state. Therefore, we recommend
that the site be considered as not eligible for nomination to the NRHP.

8.0 SITE 41BQ290
Site 41BQ290 consists of the remains of a fully razed historic homestead located along a
wooded terrace that overlooks Mesquite Creek to the north. The site measures 100 m by
85 m (Figure 8-1). Features on the site include two depressions where structures likely
stood, two other depressions, a brick and stone pile, and a stone fence.
8.1

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Site 41BQ290 is located on Mesquite Creek, on land originally granted to William
Martin in 1847 (Table 8-1). The property is part of a 149.5-acre tract sold to the U.S. by
James Ladwig in 1951 (Bosque County Deed Records 164/589), prior to construction of
Lake Whitney. Ladwig did not live on this property, but in the town of Meridian,
according to a declaration of homestead on file at the Bosque County Clerkâs office
(Bosque County Deed Records 132/295). Ladwig acquired the land with his brother in
1921 from Harvey L.
Whisenant (Bosque County
Deed Records 103/510).
Harvey Whisenant was the
son
of
Lota
Lewis
Whisenant, who was the
first person to occupy the
property on which Site 290
is located.
Lota Whisenant came to
Bosque County in 1876 after
she received five tracts of
land from her fatherâs estate.
She was the daughter of
Samuel K. Lewis, who came
to Texas in 1838 as a
surveyor for Stephen F.
Austin. He first lived in
Brazoria County on land he
acquired as a surveyor. In
1848, Lewis settled in
Fayette County, where he
built a home that also served
as a stage coach stop and inn
on the Sawyer and Risher
Stage line between Houston,
Brenham and Austin. The
home is now well-known as
Winedale (Collins 2007).

Lewis owned many properties throughout Texas; he acquired the Martin Survey in
Bosque County from William Martin himself (referenced in Bosque County Deed
Records Q/414-418), though the deed in which the transaction was referenced does not
provide a date. The Bosque County Clerkâs office, where research was conducted, does
not have deed indices pre-dating 1882, so it is not clear when Lewis began acquiring land
in Bosque County, though it would have had to have been before his death in 1867 (Giles
2007). He never lived on this land, however, as he died in Fayette County and is buried
there (Center for American History 2007).
Lota Lewis, daughter of Samuel K. Lewis, was born around 1843, according to the 1850
census (Center for American History 2007). In 1859, she married J.A. Wilm in Fayette
County. The couple had one son, Samuel Julius Wilm, born in 1862. J.A. Wilm,
however, died a few months later, leaving Lota a widow. Lota returned to the Lewis
home at Winedale and eventually began teaching in Chapell Hill. There she met Frank
Whisenant, and the two were married in 1874. They moved to Bosque County in 1876
with their young son, Ross, and Lotaâs son Samuel Wilm from her first marriage. The
area was known as Powelldale, named after the Powell family who were the Whisenantâs
neighbors, and one of the richest families in Bosque County (Powell 2007). Though the
Whisenants are not listed in the census records for Bosque County in 1880, an affidavit
made in 1940 indicates that Lota Whisenant did live on the 804-acre tract that
encompasses the Martin Survey for more than 25 years prior to her death in 1919
(Bosque County Deed Records 132/297). She is listed in the 1900 census for that area,
living with her 20-year old son Harvey who was considered the head of the household, a
daughter Kate, and a German boarder named Henry Buas, who worked on their farm.
According to the reminiscences of her granddaughter, Lotaâs second husband Frank
Whisenant died in 1888, after which she relied on her older son Sam, to head the family

(Collins 2007). She lived on the Whisenant Ranch, as it was called by family members,
until her death in 1919. She was buried in the Kopperl cemetery (Collins 2007). Her will
divided the land equally among her children (Bosque County Probate Records U/187).
The executor of her estate was her oldest son Samuel Wilm. In 1919, Lotaâs heirs deeded
their interest in the land to Harvey Whisenant, her youngest son, who sold it to the
Ladwig brothers in 1921.

FEATURES

8.2.1 Feature 1 â Depression
Feature 1 is a depression measuring 14 feet long by 8 feet wide by 3 feet deep. The
depression is apparently excavated and likely represents the location where a structure
stood. It is filled with bricks, clear glass, and shaped limestone blocks. The estimated 60
reddish orange bricks measured 8 inches long by 3Â¾ inches wide by 2Â¼ inches thick.
Their numerous irregularities, impressions, and worn edges suggest they were probably
hand made and poorly fired. Two had been faced with soft, pasty mortar. The shaped
limestone slabs range in thickness from 6 inches to 2 feet although most are about 12
inches long. Although surface visibility around the depression was heavily impeded due
to dense grasses, archeologists observed a clear glass sherd with thick patina, ten brick
fragments similar to those in the depression, and a galvanized metal washtub.

8.2.2 Feature 2 â Brick and Stone Mound with Depression
A brick and stone pile associated with a depression on its northeastern edge is designated
as Feature 2, and may be where a second structure once stood. The mounded pile consists
of approximately 50 bricks of the same type described above in association with Feature
1. Two of the bricks still have gray, soft pasty mortar adhering to their faces. The stones
are shaped limestone slabs similar in size and shapes as those in Feature 1. The
depression measures 5 feet by by 8 feet and is 2 feet deep. The only artifact observed on
or around Feature 2 was a metal barrel hoop.

8.2.3 Feature 3 â Depression
Feature 3 is a third depression and lies south of Feature 1. It is about is 4 feet in diameter,
and 2 feet deep. No artifacts were observed in association with the depression.

8.2.4 Feature 4 â Depression
Feature 4 is another depression west of Feature 1. It is approximately 6 feet wide, 8 feet
long, and 2 feet deep. As with Feature 3, no artifacts were observed.

8.2.5 Feature 5 â Stone Wall
Feature 5 is a dry stacked stone wall approximately 100 m in length with two dog-legs.
The stone fence is built with tabular limestone slabs, some of which appear to have been
quarried from the nearby creek bed. The wall is collapsed in locations but in places is
about 40-50 cm high and 30-40 cm thick (Figure 8-2). An opening in the fence where a
gate probably once stood is just southeast of Feature 1, a second opening with a modern
road cut through it is along its northern line, and an old barbed wire fence cuts across it
near the middle.

SHOVEL TESTING

Following a 100-percent pedestrian survey of the site, nine shovel tests were placed on
and around the site to determine the horizontal extent and vertical depth of cultural
deposits, as well as to evaluate their integrity. Five tests were positive, but only eight
artifacts were recovered from below the surface, and none are temporally diagnostic
(Appendix B). A prehistoric chert flake was found in ST7 was the only artifact of its
kind observed, and is considered intrusive to the historic component. Intractable sterile
clay was encountered during excavations between 10-30 cmbs.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

This site is interesting because it is located on property once owned by of one of the
earliest settlers and entrepreneurs in Texas, Samuel Knight Lewis, and his daughter Lota
who later moved onto the property perhaps as early as 1876. However, whether or not
she lived at this particular site has not been ascertained by the archival research, and the
paucity of artifacts recovered generally do not suggest an occupation at that time (the sole
exception is a single square nail). The hand-made bricks with gray, pasty mortar are
indeterminate but could indicate date a before the twentieth century.
Although Samuel Knight Lewis once owned this parcel and was a significant historical
figure in Texas, he never lived here, and he also owned dozens of other parcels
throughout the state. The other occupants have apparently contributed to the rural
agrarian society and economy in Bosque County, but nothing beyond that which can be
otherwise ascertained. The stone wall is the only recognizable structure. On this basis, we
assess the site as having no significant research value that could contribute to the history
of the region or the state. We recommend that the site be considered as not eligible for
nomination to the NRHP.

9.0 SITE 41BQ291 - JAMES FRAZIER HOMESTEAD
Site 41BQ291 consists of the remains of a mid-nineteenth to early-twentieth century
historic homestead with a collapsed superstructure, remains of two out-buildings, a well,
and a stock pond. These together cover about 2.5 acres on a slightly elevated and wooded
terrace overlooking the river floodplain to the east (Figure 9-1).
9.1

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Site 41BQ291 is located on land that was owned and occupied by the same family for
nearly 100 years (Table 9-1). Prior to construction of Lake Whitney the U.S.Government
purchased the land from Frank Frazier. Frazier had inherited this land from the estate of
his father James Cason Frazier who was one of the earliest settlers in Bosque County.
According to one report, James Cason first came to Bosque County in 1851, when he was
hired
by
the
U.S.
government to take 100
cavalry horses from Austin
to the recently established
Fort
Graham
(Bosque
County
Historical
Commission
2007).
Though another source
suggests he was in the area
in 1850, surveying land for
Jacob de Cordova and
Richard Kimball who were
developing the English
Colony of Kent (Renick
1925). Kent was located
between
Kopperl
and
Kimball on the west bank of
the Brazos under a rock
formation
known
as
Solomonâs Nose (Strickland
2007), in an area now
known as Kimballâs Bend.
That colony failed after
only a year and the settlers
dispersed.
Frasier
apparently made his home
on a neighboring tract to the
south
and
would
occasionally visit with Kent
colonists (Renick 1925).

The deed for his property dates to 1856, when he purchased an undivided one half
interest in 2160 acres of land, then known as the Kimball Bend Farm (Bosque County
Deed Records B/13), from Richard Kimball. This was a portion of the same land
Kimball sold to the Universal Immigration Company of England in 1850 as part of the
Colony of Kent.

Deed

Frazier was apparently already settled on this property. He is listed in the 1860 census as
a 29-year old farmer, born in Tennessee, who lived with his wife, Emily, and two
children, Jacob and Ella. In later years, Frazier became a lawyer, establishing the law
firm Renick and Frazier in Waco. He nevertheless kept his primary residence in Bosque
County. He and his family are shown in the 1870, 1880, and 1900 censuses for the
Kimball area. The 1900 census is noteworthy, as it indicates that not only did J.C.
Frazier still reside on the same land, but so too did his three grown sons Jacob, Frank and
Tom, and a grown daughter, Ella Little, and his son-in-law J. Ansell. While his children
maintained separate households for their own families, the extended family apparently all
occupied larger Frazier tract. All the male heads of households listed their profession as
farmers. Ella Little was a school teacher. They also had boarders and servants living
with them at that time.
J.C. Frazier died in 1917. His will divided his property equally among his eight children.
His wife, who survived him, served as executrix of his estate. His probate will listed his
real estate holdings, two mules, five head of cattle, eight hogs, farm implements, and
household furnishings (Bosque County Probate Records T/496-500). After his death,
Frank Frazier, his youngest son, received the tract on which 41BQ291 is located.

FEATURES

9.2.1 Feature 1 â House Remains
Feature 1 is a 20-foot by 40-foot collapsed historic structure believed to be a house,
aligned at bearing 50Ë east of north. The structure was manufactured from limestone
cobble/rubble that was cemented in place forming walls which were then plastered over
using cement. The cobble walls appear to have been made from whatever was locally
available on site, combined with a rough course-grained cement mixture (Figure 9-2).
Upon close inspection, the walls also contained unmarked homemade red bricks
cemented in place alongside the limestone rubble. In addition, the walls contained spaces
where 2-inch by 6-inch floor joists would have been located, creating a floor that featured
a 3-foot crawl space underneath. The structure had a wall that went down the middle
forming two rooms that probably mirrored each other, with each room having two doors
and three windows (Figure 9-1, inset). The eastern room was completely filled with
structural debris as much as 5 feet deep. The remains are similar in appearance to
buildings located within nearby Kimball Bend Park.
Artifacts observed on the surface around the house include the following.
Â

Ceramics and Stoneware. Ceramics observed in association with Feature 1
included twelve undecorated whiteware sherds; one whiteware sherd with royal
blue design; one stoneware sherd with blue exterior glaze; one stoneware sherd
with blue and green interior and exterior glazes; one stoneware sherd with pale
gray glaze; and two stoneware sherds with indeterminate glaze.

Â

Glass Items. Numerous glass shards included: 24 window glass sherds; 24 clear
bottle glass sherds (date to post-1930s); nine bottle glass sherds with amethyst hue
(date to 1880-1915); two brown bottle glass sherds (dates indeterminate); three
aqua bottle glass sherds (date to before 1900); one whole clear syrup bottle (date
to after 1930s); one blue bottle glass sherd (dates indeterminate); and one thick,
ice blue depression glass sherd (dates 1930s to present, Schroy 2000).

Â

Metal Objects. Various metal items in association with the house feature
included: a round rod, 18 inches long, threaded on both ends, with square nuts; a
fencing staple; 17 pieces of sheet metal; one bucket; and strands of barbed wire
and hog wire.

Â

Miscellaneous Items. Other miscellaneous items associated with the house
included: a plastic button; several fragments of a carbide battery stick (developed
for commercial use in 1896 and mostly replaced by 1947 (Carbon Batteries
2008a, b); one limestone marble; and one machine-made brick with no makerâs
mark.

9.2.2 Feature 2 â Depression
Feature 2 is a circular depression measuring about 2.1 m in diameter and about 40 cm
deep. It is located about 15 m west of the house. No artifacts were found in or around the
depression.

9.2.3 Feature 3 â Shed or Barn
Feature 3 is an area measuring about 4 m by 3 m and containing five limestone support
blocks on the surface. Three pieces of galvanized and corrugated roofing tin were in
association. This may have been the location of a shed or barn.

9.2.4 Feature 4 - Animal Pen
Feature 4 is a 3Â½-foot by 7-foot configuration of four 5-foot cedar posts with galvanized
metal attached with round wire nails (Figure 9-3). The feature is interpreted as an
expedient animal pen.

9.2.5 Feature 5 â Stock Pond
A stock pond formed by the construction of an earthen dam across a low area east of the
house was designated as Feature 5. The dam is U-shaped and is approximately 40 m long.

9.2.6 Feature 6 â Well
Feature 6 is a water well with what appears to be a modern concrete well cover and the
iron well casing enbedded in concrete (Figure 9-4). It is located southwest of the house.
9.3

SHOVEL TESTING

Following a 100-percent pedestrian survey of the site, nine shovel tests were placed on
and around the site to determine the horizontal extent and vertical depth of cultural
deposits and to evaluate their integrity. Six tests were positive (67 percent ubiquity)
returning 143 artifacts to 40 cmbs (Appendix B). A majority of the artifacts were
recovered from Shovel Tests 4 and 6, indicating the presence of a probable buried trash
dump. Overall, intractable sterile clay was encountered between 10-40 cmbs.

9.3.1 Unique Item from the Surface
A limestone marble found on the surface measures 1-inch in diameter and has traces of
the original brown glaze. Stone marbles were commonly produced in Germany
beginning in the 1700s and were commercially exported to other countries. Peak
production periods of stone marbles occurred in the mid-1700s, and again in the mid1800s. By the 1930s, the production of stone marbles in Germany had all but ceased.
Overall, German toys were shipped in mass to the U.S. through the start of World War I
in 1914 (Alanâs Marble Connection 2008; Zapata 1997:100-118).

9.3.2 Unique Items from Shovel Tests
Diagnostic artifacts recovered from the shovel tests include the following.
Â

86

Handpainted whiteware. A handpainted sherd of whiteware (Figure 9-5) with
creamy white paste was found in Shovel Test 4, between 0-20 cmbs. The broken
piece exhibits a portion of a large green leaf. Polychrome painted table settings
with ââ¦red, black, and some lighter shades of blue and greenâ¦â became popular

during the 1830s (Miller 1991:8). By the 1840s, common designs included
sprigs, often combined with the cut sponge technique. These motifs were
superseded in the 1870s by large floral designs, popular through about 1900.
Â

Pressed glass tumbler. Twenty-two sherds of a pressed glass tumbler base and
partial body were collected from Shovel Test 4, 0-20 cmbs. Part of the base can
be reconstructed sufficiently to reveal a starburst design on the bottom. Pressed
glass has been produced for over 200 years, with nearly all of it being clear until
around the 1880s (Husfloen 1994). Its clarity and hue suggest a manufacture date
between 1880-1915. It is not unlike those listed for sale in the 1895 Montgomery
Ward & Co. catalogue (Montgomery Ward & Co. 1968).

Â

Stoneware sherd. A stoneware sherd found in Shovel Test 6 between 20-40 cmbs
has a slightly rippled, greenish gray exterior typical of salt glazing, while its
interior has been coated with Albany slip (Figure 9-5). This combination of
coatings wase commonly used on stoneware produced between 1850-1900 (Greer
1981:197, 200).

Â

Decalcomania. Two sherds recovered from Shovel Test 6 between 0-20 cmbs are
body sherds with faint traces of a gold leaf pattern (Figure 9-5). The third is an

Ecological Communications Corporation

87

Archeological Investigations at Lake Whitney, Bosque, Hill, and Johnson Counties, Texas

undecorated rim sherd. The gold leaf pattern was transferred from thin paper onto
the vessel. It is typical of tableware used as a cheap tableware since about 1850,
and is still being used today (Durrenberger 1965:66; Ramsay 1976:291).
Â

Band and Line ware. Three shades of green decorate a rim sherd (Figure 9-5)
found in Shovel Test 4, between 0-20 cmbs. The outer band is a thin, light olive
green. The center band is even thinner, and is a darker green. The thickness of the
aqua-green inner band cannot be determined because much of that portion is
missing. Band and Line vessels were most popular from about 1875 to 1900.
They were common hotel wares consisted of ironstone plates, saucers and bowls.
They are still being produced in limited quantities today (Miller 1991:7).

Â

Spent bullet casing. This spent casing bears a headstamp of â.38 S&W,â
indicating it was for a .38 caliber bullet manufactured by Smith & Wesson
Ammunition Company of Rock Creek, Ohio (Figure 9-5). Smith & Wesson
introduced the .38 caliber revolver in 1899. The revolver and ammunition are still
being used today (Cartridge Collectors 2006; Smith & Wesson 2008). This
specimen was found in Shovel Test 4, 0-20 cmbs.

9.3.3 Other Items of Interest
One undecorated glass sherd that appears to be from a kerosene lamp globe or lantern
chimney was found in Shovel Test 1, between 0-20 cmbs. The concept of fuel burning
lamps was first patented in 1784, but it was not until 1864 that kerosene became readily
available as a fuel source in the U.S. and kerosene lamps became the norm (Woodhead et
al. 1984:58).
An iron railroad spike was found in Unit 2, 0-10
cmbs, and a second spike was recovered from Shovel
Test 6, 0-20 cmbs. Both spikes have broken heads.
The Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe railroad was placed
in operation from Kopperl to the south, through
Blum, and then to Cleburne to the north on October
21, 1881 (Osborn 2008) so presumably these two
specimen could date to 1881. The line south of
41BQ291 was abandoned in 1953 due to the
construction of Lake Whitney.
Other items of interest, but which can not be reliably
dated, include a brass gear, possibly for a watch or
clock, and a small electric motor part (Figure 9-6).

CONTROLLED EXCAVATIONS

On the basis of the shovel testing results, three controlled excavation units were placed
on the site. Unit 1 was located adjacent to the southwest of ST5, and was dug through
clay loam with gravels before encountering sterile clay at 30 cmbs (Figure 9-7). Unit 2
was placed adjacent to the southeast of ST6. Excavators here encountered clay loam with
gravels throughout to 50 cmbs. Unit 3 was located 10 m south of the site datum, and was
excavated to 30 cm through clay loam to sterile clay. Together, 608 artifacts were
recovered, in addition 131.3 grams of unidentifiable metal fragments, a tiny chunk of
charcoal (< 1 gram), four prehistoric chert flakes, and a heat spall (Appendix B).

9.4.1 Unique Items from Excavation Units
Diagnostic artifacts recovered from the controlled excavation units include the following.
Â

Stoneware Sherds. Two stoneware sherds were recovered. A body sherd from
what was probably a bowl was recovered from Unit 2 between 10-20 cmbs. Its
interior is coated with a light brown Albany slip, while its exterior is a light gray
Bristol glaze. Over the glaze is a decorative design of what appears to be an
abstract floral pattern in cobalt blue metallic oxide slip, probably painted on using
a small flared brush (Figure 9-8). Cobalt blue designs were especially popular on
salt-glazed vessels. The combination of an Albany slip interior and a salt glazed
exterior was most common between 1850-1900 (Greer 1981:148, 197, 200). A
second stoneware sherd was recovered from Unit 2, Level 1. It is covered with

bowl sherd.)

Bristol glaze on both its interior and exterior. Stamped on its exterior using a dark
gray cobalt metallic oxide can be deciphered what appears to be âREGâ¦â and
ââ¦PPERSâ¦â (Figure 9-8). The technique of using stamps became very
common beginning around 1900. However, the combination of Bristol glazed
interior and exterior suggests a manufacture date between 1920-1950 (Greer
1981:148, 159, 175, 212).
Â

90

Panel bottle. This is a clear glass rectangular base commonly used in bottles
manufactured during the latter part of the nineteenth, and earlier part of the
twentieth centuries that held medicines, oils, and other household liquids (Figure
9-8). They were called panel bottles because embossed lettering (and later
applied paper labels) decorated the two paneled faces. Portions of the bottle
exhibit a heavy patina coating, but the more relative characteristics of this
specimen is that is made of clear glass and exhibits a slight amethyst hue,
suggesting a manufacturing date of between 1880 and 1915.

Ecological Communications Corporation

Archeological Investigations at Lake Whitney, Bosque, Hill, and Johnson Counties, Texas

Â

Bitters bottle. A total of 19 sherds from a shattered bitters bottle were found in
Shovel Test 6 from 0-20 cmbs and in Unit 2 from 30 to 40 cmbs. Unit 2 and ST6
are very near each other. The neck and base sherds recovered are shown in
(Figure 9-8).
Toulouse (1971:111) indicates that the profusion of bitters
producers came about rapidly after the Revenue Tax of 1862 was passed which
taxed liquor at a much higher rate than proprietary medicines such as bitters. As a
result, manufacturers simply increased the alcohol content of bitters. Most bitters
bottles were manufactured between 1860 and 1905 (Polak 1997:84). Enough
remains of the base to identify the bottle as common square style (Odell 2008a),
and the lip can be described as a broad sloping collar type above a beveled ring.
The lip has been tooled smooth to prevent mouth and tongue damage when
drinking from it. There is not enough left of the neck and lip to observe any mold
seams. The dark amber color suggests a manufacture date within the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, while the apparent improved tooled lip
finish indicates approximately an early 1870s through 1903 manufacture period
(Deiss 1981:51). In sum, it appears this specimen was probably manufactured
between 1870 and 1903.

Â

Prong buckle. Two pieces of a prong buckle (Figure 9-8) were found in Unit 2,
30-40 cmbs. Another piece of a probable prong buckle was found in the same unit
between 20-30 cmbs. Belt buckles were originally designed for the military,
especially sailors. Otherwise suspenders were the common means of holding up
menâs trousers. Although this specimen could well date to the 1800s, belts and
belt buckles became more common for menâs trousers beginning in the early
1900s (Belt Buckle History 2006).

Â

Garter catch snaps. What appears to be metal snaps that are normally attached to
garter catches (Figure 9-8) were recovered from between 0-20 cmbs and 20-30
cmbs in Unit 2. These pieces at some point became detached. Both men and
women commonly used garter hooks and catches to hold up stockings throughout
the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

Â

Metal button. This small button was found in Unit 3 between 10-20 cmbs. It is
made of what appears to be cast pewter, has four holes and is machine-made with
a self shank (Figure 9-8). In the early 1800s, metal buttons were generally made
from cast pewter and brass in one-piece molds. By the 1860s, 4-hole, one-piece
metal buttons were generally made from iron or brass and were commonly
stamped with a design or makerâs mark (Pool 1987:277-279; South 1977:115).
Because this particular specimen is made of cast pewter and has no stamp, it
likely dates to between 1800-1870. It is a line 22 (size), suggesting it was used on
a shirt (Meissner 1997:125).

Â

Button back. This metal specimen consists of two pieces, the back and loop
shank, to a Sanders type 3-part button (Figure 9-8). It is a line 40 (size),
suggesting it would have been used on a coat or cloak (Meissner 1997:125). Both

Ecological Communications Corporation

91

Archeological Investigations at Lake Whitney, Bosque, Hill, and Johnson Counties, Texas

pieces appear to have been made from cast pewter. Although cast pewter was
used in the early 1800s for one-piece metal buttons, pewter was relatively cheap
and was thus used through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The same
technique is still used today (Pool 1987:277-281).

92

Â

Tee handle. This brass item was recovered from Unit 2 between 0-20 cmbs
(Figure 9-8). It is a tee handle for a water faucet.

Â

Ceramic pipe sherd. A sherd from a ceramic smoking pipe was recovered from
Unit 2, 20-30 cmbs (Figure 9-8). This specimen is made of highly fired gray clay,
with a smooth and burnished surface. Although it is a small piece, its curvature
indicates that it would have had an opening of approximately 200 mm, and it
decreases in thickness from 41 mm at the bottom to 19 mm at the top. Clay
ceramic smoking pipes have been found at many historic sites in Texas that were
occupied in the nineteenth century, such as the Burleson homestead in Hays
County (Bousman and Nickels 2003), Fanthorp Inn in Grimes County (Sauer et
al. 1998), and the Landmark Inn in Medina County (Parsons and Burnett 1984) to
name a few. A highly fired ceramic, this specimen is technologically equivalent to
dinnerware and utilitarian ware produced during the latter decades of the
nineteenth century.

Â

Spongeware. Three small
sherds
of
sponge
decorated ware were
recovered from Unit 2,
20-30 cmbs (Figure 9-9).

what
appears to be a blue
floral pattern, a technique

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

9.5.1 Periods of Occupation
Archival research indicates that this site is located on a tract of land acquired in 1856 by
James Cason Frazier, one of the earliest settlers in Bosque County. Several sources
indicate that he lived in this area since 1850 or 1851. He can be linked to several early
Fort Graham. He and his family lived there as farmers until his death in 1917, and then
some of his heirs remained on the property until it was sold to the U.S. Government
around 1950. It is not clear whether the house remains at Site 41BQ291 represent the
original Frazier home, or a later house built for one of his children, or even a boarder.
Though in form and material use, the house could date to the middle nineteenth century,
close examination indicates that it has likely undergone renovations through the years, as
a Portland concrete mixture was observed on the facing of at least one exterior wall.
Artifact analysis supported this archival information. Figure 9-10 illustrates the likely
time period of occupations based on the temporally diagnostic artifacts. Assuming the
earliest possible occupation is 1856, then those artifacts that could date prior to then
would have to be either curated keepsakes, or they could have been brought to the site
initially in 1856. For example, the 3-piece buttons have long periods of production and
use both before and after 1856. Some artifacts could date to well after the year 1950,
about the time when the house was sold to the government. Once again, those items have
long periods of production and use and their use as temporal makers is discounted. By
eliminating artifacts that could date before the 1850s and after the 1950s, a core group of
diagnostic artifacts demonstrate a continuum of site occupation from about the 1850s
through about 1950. These data appear to corroborate the occupation periods implied by
the archival research.

9.5.2 Site Integrity
The architectural component of this site consists of collapsed remains. To evaluate the
integrity of archeological deposits, the artifact assemblage was examined in terms of
relative ages versus depth below the surface. Figure 9-11 illustrates that contemporaneous
artifacts occur at all four levels below the surface, indicating that some mixing has
occurred between levels. However, this is to be expected given that the property was
continuously owned and occupied by the same family for almost 100 years. In addition,
five presumably prehistoric chert artifacts were recovered from the excavations,
including four interior flakes and one heat spall. These were mixed with historic artifacts
in the same levels. Two of the prehistoric artifacts were recovered from 10-20 cmbs and
three were from 40-50 cmbs.

9.5.3 Recommendations
The above-ground components of the site are in poor condition and architecturally they
lack integrity. An analysis of artifacts recovered during the excavations indicate that there
are materials dating from the middle of the nineteenth through the middle of the twentieth
centuries, though mixing has occurred at all levels beneath the surface. While these
artifacts in themselves are not extraordinary, given that the site is associated with a
prominent family in the region, who lived on this property for almost 100 years, further
research-oriented study of the site and its artifacts could yield significant data about the
daily lives and practices of some of the regionâs earliest settlers. A conversation with a
representative of the Bosque County Historical Commission has found that in fact, there
are several boxes of records and photos pertaining to the Frazier family at the Historical
Commission archives. Further historical research in these archives could help establish
whether this site is part of the original Frazier home, or whether it was built during a later
period for one the many Frazier children that also lived on this property. The research
could also help establish whether the site is eligible for the NRHP under Criteria A and B related to significant individuals, and significant events that contribute to broad trends in
history. Meanwhile, pairing that research with further archeological information derived
from research-oriented excavations could establish whether the site has potential to
contribute new data to the understanding of these people and events under Criterion D.
Pending such research, the NRHP eligibility of the site is currently unknown.

10.0 SITE 41JN59
Site 41JN59 is a prehistoric open campsite with a burned rock feature and at least two
stratigraphic components. The site was discovered through systematic shovel testing
across the area in 30 m intervals. Obvious disturbances visible on the surface include a
bladed roadcut and the construction of a barbed wire fence through the eastern portion of
the site. Covering an area of 0.5 acres, it is situated on T1 and T2 terraces at the
confluence of an intermittent drainage and the Brazos River (Figure 10-1). Ranging in
elevation from 540-550 feet above mean sea level (amsl), it lies within an area of
meandering drainages and steep stream cuts. Hilllco series loamy clay sustains the
growth of cedars and hardwood forest oaks, and a dense understory consisting
predominately of greenbriar, along with assorted herbaceous weeds and grasses. Other
than in the road cut and stream cuts, surface visibility in December 2007 was less than 20
percent. A Dawson dart point and what is likely an unfinished Yarbrough dart point
found during the excavations in the lower component suggests a Late Archaic
occupation, approximately
1650-150 BC (Fields 2004:
351).

staining from burning. The mussel shells were generally lying horizontal, with a few in a
vertical position. The flakes were made from chert; some were thermally altered, and all
were less than 5 cm in length. In addition, two chert bifaces were observed. Soils above
the feature were dark brown (10YR3/3), contrasting with the dark grayish brown
(10YR4/2) soils within the feature. Although the eastern portion was disturbed as a result
of blading, much of the western extent of the feature was believed to be possibly still
intact. Results of shovel testing upslope and west of the road cut indicated that the feature
extended in that direction to a depth of at least 80 cm.
10.2

SHOVEL TESTING

In addition to a 100-percent examination of the siteâs surface, 19 shovel tests were
excavated, with 294 artifacts and cultural items (including burned rock) found in 15 of
the shovel tests (79 percent ubiquity). No historic artifacts were visible on the surface,
and the only prehistoric cultural material observed was eroding from the road cut.
Cultural material was recovered in every level from 0-80 cmbs. Vertical distribution of
cultural material is strongly unimodal, with more than 60 percent of the artifacts recovered
from the upper 20 cmbs (Table 10-1). Bedrock or caliche was encountered between 4080 cm in nine of the tests, indicating that soils were shallowest from north to south through

the center of the site, and on the east edge of the intermittent drainage. Deeper loamy
soils are present on the western portion of the site (STs 6-2, 6-3 and 6-4), near the
confluence of the drainage and the Brazos River (STs 5-3 and 5-4), and in the area where
Feature 1 is located (ST 1).
The results from ST 1, which was placed above the burned rock feature, suggest there
may be two components in this immediate area. In this test, a frequency mode is between
0-20 cmbs with a second between 40-80 cmbs. Otherwise, as shown in Figure 10-3, the
total number of flakes recovered by level suggests continuum of occupation between 0-80
cm.
10.3

CONTROLLED EXCAVATIONS

In addition to the shovel tests, two controlled 1 m by 1 m units were excavated to further
investigate the integrity and content of the cultural deposits. The two units were placed
adjacent to positive shovel tests that contained both artifact and fire cracked rock.
Cultural material recovered and observed within the two units is shown in Table 10-2.

10.3.1 Test Unit 1
Unit 1 was placed slightly upslope from Feature 1, on the lip of a T1 terrace west and
adjacent to the roadcut and 12 meters west of the intermittent drainage that courses
through the eastern edge of the site. Excavators noted clay loam to a depth of 87 cm
below datum before encountering silty clay, then gravels over decomposing bedrock
sloping from 100-110 cmbs. Disturbances observed during excavations included roots
and rootlets between 40-60 cmbs and 70-80 cmbs.
Figure 10-4 illustrates the north wall profile of Test Unit 1, along with flake and fire
cracked rock frequencies, snail counts, and soil susceptibility and pH values. Trends in
densities of artifacts and snails strongly suggest there are two identifiable archeological
components in Unit 1: one component is between 20-30 cmbs and a second component is
between 70-90 cmbs. The high modes in soil susceptiblity values support this
interpretation. Although less pronounced, trends in pH values also generally correlate
with these occupation zones. It appears that the normal pH values for soils within the
profile range between ca. 6.45 and 6.5. There is clearly a peak in pH between 20-30 cmbs
and 70-80 cmbs where one would expect higher values because of the human occupations
in those zones. Otherwise, fluctuations outside the norm are likely caused by either
organics within certain zones, differing sediment packages, and/or illuviation (water flow
through). Noting that, archeologists observed an increase in roots and rootlets between
40- 60 cmbs, and an increase in caliche and fragmented limestone bedrock between 100110 cmbs.

Groundwater has caused many of the artifacts in the assemblage to become heavily
encrusted with calcium carbonate, particularly in the lower levels. While analyzing the
chipped stone, notes were made regarding the area of encrustation if any. The implication
is that if an artifact was encrusted on one side only, it likely lay in situ in a horizontal
position. If the encrustation covered both sides, it could have been flipped over at some
time. On the other hand, if the encrustation occurred on the end and partially up both
sides, then it could have been lying in a vertical position. In the lower occupation zone
between 70-90 cmbs, a total of 98 complete flakes contained encrustation; of those 86
were encrusted on either the dorsal or ventral surface only, suggesting that 88 percent
were in situ. Of the ten bifaces within the same zone, nine of those (90 percent) exhibited
encrustation on one face only. Of the five unifaces in that zone, all five (100 percent)
exhibited encrustation on one face only.

10.3.2 Test Unit 2
Unit 2 was placed in a wooded area slightly upslope and 25 m west of Unit 1 on what
appears to be a T2 terrace (Figure 10-1). Excavators noted silty loam at 35-38 cmbs
before encountering silty clay loam, silty clay, and finally clay with dense gravels from
50-60 cmbs. Disturbances observed during excavations included an extensive root system

near the surface, declining in density to 38 cmbs. Excavations in the south half of the unit
were terminated at 50 cmbs, while the north half was dug through clay with dense
limestone gravels to 60 cmbs. Cultural material recovered from Unit 2 are listed in Table
10-2. Figure 10-5 illustrates the west wall profile, along with flake and fire cracked rock
densities, snail counts, and soil susceptibility and pH values. No soil samples were
collected from Unit 2, but very much like Unit 1, trends in densities of artifacts and snails
strongly suggest there are also two archeological components in Unit 2, one between 1020 cmbs and the second between 30-40 cmbs.
Again using encrustation as a potential indicator of in situ or disturbed artifacts, of the
seven encrusted complete flakes between 30-40 cmbs, none were encrusted on more than
one face, suggesting they were lying horizontally.

EXCAVATED ASSEMBLAGE

This section describes the results of analysis of the cultural remains collected at 41JN59.
The purpose of this section is to evaluate the type and degree of tool technology, and
probable subsistence base while the site was occupied. These data are directly applicable
and necessary for evaluating the siteâs NRHP eligibility. The total assemblage consists of
1,302 pieces of chipped stone, one hammerstone, 41 fragments of animal bone (42 g),
331 snails, 1,165 fire cracked rocks (weighing more than 67 kg), 110 mussel shell umbos
(983 g), one piece of ocher, and one charcoal sample (Appendix A). Intrusive material
included two pieces of glass, two bullets, and a small chunk of lead in ST 5-4 located on
the outer edge of the site and one glass shard in Unit 2.

10.4.1 Chipped Stone
All 1,302 chipped-stone artifacts were examined. The artifacts were subdivided into the
following classes: projectile points (n=3), bifaces (n=16), unifaces (n=13), cores (n=7), a
tested pebble (n=1), and unmodified debitage (n=1,262). After artifacts were catalogued,
classes were analyzed according to a variety of attributes. The attributes provided a
technological and morphological characterization of the lithic assemblage at the site.
Projectile Points
The following attributes were recorded for projectile points: raw material type, raw
material quality, burning, projectile point subgroup, projectile point type, serration,
beveling, completeness, break type, maximum length, blade length, blade width, haft
length, neck width, base width, and maximum thickness.
Two dart points and a point preform were found (Bradley 1975). The points and preform
were assigned to a projectile point type based on commonly accepted point types
identified in Central and East-Central Texas (e.g. Fields 2004; Turner and Hester 1999;
Prewitt n.d.). A point that could not be assigned with confidence to a previously
established type was coded as âuntypable,â a designation generally reserved for
fragmentary specimens lacking enough diagnostic attributes to determine their size or
shape. If a point was incomplete, the break was coded as either use/resharpening related,
manufacture, post-depositional, or indeterminate. Additional data including dimensions
and results of ultraviolet light evaluations were also recorded. Finally, the area and
percentage of calcium carbonate encrustation were recorded. Figure 10-6 shows the
fragmented and whole points recovered during the excavations.

104

Â

Untypable dart point. A heavily burned and fractured stem with partial barbs
remaining was found in Unit 1, between 70-80 cmbs. It is made from a flake of
gray, fine-grained chert. Because of its significant damage, it was impossible to
surmise if it was broken before being exposed to intense heat. However, because
of its overall morphology and fine flaking patterns, it appears this was at one time
a finished product. Measurements that could be taken include a stem width of
14.8 mm, and a stem length of 15.4 mm. Although that it is categorized as
untypable, its parallel stem and shoulders are very similar to those of the Dawson
point described in the following paragraph, or similar to other stemmed Middle
and Late Archaic points (e.g., Prykril 1990).

Â

Yarbrough preform. This specimen was found at a depth of 90 cm in Unit 1. It is
made from fine grained light brown chert with light tan chert inclusions. It is
slightly discolored and waxy from being heat treated. A fine grained inclusion of
gray chert and a small bit of cortex are present at the very end of its base. A single
basal thinning flake scar runs from its base half way up its stem on its ventral
surface; otherwise the base of the stem is naturally thin. Post-depositional damage
is evident on the left lateral edge of its dorsal surface, and some may have
occurred to its right lateral edge before being covered with encrusted calcium

cmbs is made from
(Left to right: untypable; Yarbrough perform; Dawson)
tan chert that has
been reddened from exposure to heat. Reddened cortex remains on its base, and
the reddening subtly degrades upward on the stem, suggesting it was exposed to
heat as part of the technological manufacturing process. Although it is whole, the
remaining cortex suggests it may or may have been finished. It has been made
from a flake blank, and is encrusted with calcium carbonate on its right ventral
surface only, an indicator that it was likely lying horizontal in the ground.

Non-diagnostic Bifaces
Chipped stone artifacts that had been flaked on both sides of the same lateral edge are
classified as bifaces. The goal of analyzing non-diagnostic bifaces at 41JN59 was to
evaluate the manufacturing technology that was occurring at the site. A total of 16 bifaces
provides a credible sample size. Included in the assemblage are six unbroken specimens.
Selected bifaces are shown in Figure 10-7.
For each specimen, the following attributes were recorded: raw material type, raw
material grain, burning, presence or absence of cortex, tool completeness, length, width,
stage of reduction, and evidence for tool recycling. Appendix G presents a compilation of
data for the entire assemblage. Colors ranged from grayish white to yellowish brown and
brown.
Raw material grain was simply noted as fine or coarse. Burning or heating was coded as
either being present or absent, and was determined by the presence of crazing, and/or
discoloration with a waxy feel. Tool completeness was coded as complete, incomplete, or

indeterminate. All bifaces were measured to the nearest millimeter, and their attributes
are summarized and discussed in the following paragraphs.
The stage of reduction of a biface was coded as either early, middle, late, or
indeterminate, following Collins (1975). Early stage bifaces (n=7) usually retain a small
to large amount of cortex and have relatively few flake removals, all of which were
removed by hard hammer percussion. The edges of these bifaces are generally very
sinuous when viewed in profile. Middle stage reduction bifaces (n=1) are typically
thinner than early stage bifaces, have little or no cortex remaining, and have numerous
flake scars, many of which may extend beyond the mid-line of the biface. The edges are
less sinuous than those of early stage specimens. However, in this case the single biface
that was categorized as middle stage is a specimen morphologically similar to a Clear
Fork gouge made from marbled chert. It is not completely finished and shows no signs
of utilization, yet it exhibits flake scars well beyond an early stage of reduction. Late
stage reduction bifaces (n=8) are thin, have no cortex, and have numerous flake scars.
Most of the flakes from late stage reduction are removed by billet or soft hammer
percussion. Flake scars are, therefore, relatively longer and more shallow than in early

106

Archeological Investigations at Lake Whitney, Bosque, Hill, and Johnson Counties, Texas

stage reduction. The edges of late stage bifaces are usually straight when viewed in
profile.
It is realized that bifaces may be utilized at any stage in the reduction process. For
example, artifacts functionally, and typically classified as âchoppersâ are normally early
stage bifaces with a cortex covered proximal end and a crudely flaked distal end. Their
distal ends commonly show use-wear derived presumably from activities such as
butchering and woodworking (Turner and Hester 1999). With the exception of the
functional classification of the crude Clear Fork gouge, none of these existed in the
assemblage.
Biface shape was coded as either ovate, pointed-ovate, triangular, round, or
indeterminate. The pointed-ovate form is characterized by a rounded, or convex base with
a pointed blade. A triangular biface has a pointed blade and straight base.
Break type was classified as manufacture, use, post-depositional, burning, or
indeterminate. Manufacture breaks typically result from either lateral biface thinning
failures or basal thinning failures (Tomka 1986). A common break type associated with
lateral biface thinning failures is known as a perverse fracture. Defined by Crabtree
(1972:82), perverse fractures are easily identified by the twisting of the fracture plane on
a rotational axis that corresponds to the direction of the force that initiated the fracture.
Use breaks commonly result from impact with a hard surface or material, or from prying
(Tomka 1986). End shock, resulting in a transverse fracture, is caused when the elastic
limits of the material are exceeded (Crabtree 1972:60). In replication studies, Tomka
(1986:94) demonstrates that end shock type breaks result from using a biface to pry
something, as well as from the suspended weight of the shaft when hafted bifaces were
thrown with sufficient force to penetrate wood. Impact occasionally results in the
removal of burin-like flakes along the lateral edge of a biface and/or crushing at the point
of impact (Tomka 1986:94).
Post-depositional breaks are typically the result of force applied to the lateral surface of a
biface. This results in a bulb of percussion originating not from the edge of the artifact,
but from its face (Tomka 1986:96). Post-depositional breaks can result from numerous
activities including natural and artificial factors.
Breaks resulting from burning are heat fractures, or pot lids and are the result of
differential expansion and contraction of the parent material. Unlike a fracture resulting
from direct force on the material, as is the case with the removal of a flake, burning
fractures and pot lids lack compression rings (Crabtree 1972:84).
Excluding the tool that is similar to a Clear Fork gouge, the remaining 15 bifaces are all
made from fine grained chert varying in colors from gray, tan and chocolate brown.
Based on their horizontal planes, it appears that nine were made from flake blanks, and
three were made from nodules; the remaining three were indeterminate. Seven exhibited
minimal flake scars and shaping indicative of early stage reduction, none could be

categorized as middle stage, and eight were finely flaked and shaped to a late stage of
reduction. Four of the 15 exhibited slight discoloring and a waxy feel from apparent heat
treating. One was heavily burned and spalled; an apparent post-depositional event. Ten
of the 15 were broken; five were broken during the manufacturing process, two were
broken during use, and on three specimens the break type could not be determined.
The specimen that resembles a Clear Fork gouge was found in the upper occupation
component of Unit 2, 10-20 cmbs (Figure 10-8). It is made from a nodule of fine
grained, heat treated marbled chert in various shades of light tan and brown. Placing
Clear Forks within a specific period is difficult. Turner and Hester (1999:246-249) cite
examples of these tools that have come from Paleoindian through Middle Archaic
contexts in south-central Texas and the Trans-Pecos regions. However, citing several
examples from the Texas Plains, Hughes (1991:19) and Boyd (1997:262-264) surmise
that Clear Fork tools could have been used from the Paleoindian through the Late
Prehistoric periods.
Unifaces
Stone tools that have flakes removed on one surface are classified as unifaces. The
attributes recorded for unifaces are very similar to those described above for bifaces, and
the data can be found at Appendix H. Twelve unifaces were recovered during this
project. Selected specimen of unifaces are shown in Figure 10-9.
All 12 pieces are made from fine grained chert varying in colors from gray, tan and
chocolate brown. Nine of the 12 were complete and eight appear to have been heat
treated. Based on their horizontal planes, it appears that all 12 were made from flake
blanks. Four had been modified on their distal ends, six had been modified on one lateral
edge, and two exhibited modification on both lateral edges. The shapes of the edges
where modification occurred were seven straight, one concave, three convex, and one
piece with multiple edges flaked. Of the seven unifaces with calcium carbonate
encrustation recovered below 70 cm, all seven (100 percent) were encrusted on one
surface only.
The degree of retouch for unifaces is a subjective category. The possible classifications
are expedient, minimal, formal, and indeterminate. Expedient unifaces are flakes that
have been modified through use, but not by intentional flaking or shaping. With the use
of a Loupe and magnifying glass, all 1,302 pieces of debitage were examined for the
presence/absence of expedient unifaces, finding a total of three. Minimally retouched
unifaces have not been drastically altered from their original form, but some flaking has
been used to alter the shape of one or more of its edges; ten were found within the
assemblage. Formal unifaces include artifacts functionally classified as scrapers, gouges,
or unifacial knives. One or more their edges have been significantly shaped through the
deliberate patterning of flake removals. No formally shaped unifacial tools were
recovered.

Cores and Tested Pebble
Cores are cobbles that have multiple flake removals from one or more directions. The
measurement of cores allows for comparisons between core size and size of flakes
recovered. Tested cobbles, or in this case a tested pebble, are either split open or exhibit a
single flake scar, presumably for examining the raw material quality before proceeding
further. One tested cobble four complete cores and three core fragments were recovered
from the site. The raw material type and quality, any evidence of burning or heating,
percentage of cortex remaining, number of flake scars, and flake scar direction were
recorded and then measured (Appendix C).
All seven cores and core fragments were made from fine grained gray, tan, or brown
chert, except for one core fragment made from grayish brown with chocolate brown
banding. Three of the seven showed some evidence of being heated. Four of the seven
exhibit flake scars in a bi-directional pattern, while the remaining three have flake scars
in multiple directions. The tested pebble has been split in half so to expose both light
purple and grayish brown fine grained quartzite beneath light brown, smooth cortex.
Three of five (60 percent) cores and fragments between 70-80 cm in Unit 1 contained
calcium carbonate encrustation on one face only. The other two exhibited encrustation on
one edge. However, given the irregular shape and multiple edges on cores and fragments,
this is not likely an indicator that these two pieces have been moved following their
initial deposition.
Unmodified Debitage
The largest category of chipped stone recovered was unmodified debitage (n=1,262). The
goal of the analysis of this category was to reconstruct the types of reduction strategies
represented in the assemblage. First, the debitage was separated into three categories by
using an approach in which each is assigned to a predefined flake type: complete flakes,
incomplete flakes, and shatter.
Complete flakes are defined as those with intact platforms and a measurable feathered or
hinge termination; incomplete flakes lack one or both of these attributes. Shatter is
defined as angular debris that is a by-product of producing stone tools, but has none of
the characteristics of an intentionally removed flake. A total of 277 complete flakes and
677 incomplete flakes were separated within the assemblage for further examination,
while the 49 shattered pieces were only counted.
Prior to the analysis of the complete flakes a series of flake types which are defined on
the basis of a list of attributes that are most characteristic of specific reduction techniques
were determined. For each flake being analyzed, a limited number of measurements and
attributes were coded. The alternative to this approach would have been to record
multiple attributes for each flake and subsequently develop a flake typology. Problematic
to such an approach is that it is very time consuming. The method employed during this
analysis, on the other hand, results in the immediate identification of flake type. For a
more detailed description of this method of analysis see Mehalchick et al. (1996).

110

For each complete flake the following attributes were recorded: raw material type, raw
material quality, length, width, thickness, platform faceting, amount of dorsal cortex,
flake type, encrustation, and evidence of burning or heating. Platform faceting was
characterized as either single, double, multiple (more than three), or corticate. The
percentage of dorsal cortex was estimated. Flake types that could be in the assemblage
included
biface
manufacture,
biface
thinning/
resharpening,
uniface
manufacture/resharpening, blade, platform preparation and/or core preparation, notching,
sequence, channel, or indeterminate. These are defined below.
Â

Biface Manufacture Flakes (n=100). These flakes are defined as primary and
secondary flakes having moderate to large dorsal flake scar ridges and with
minimal to considerable longitudinal curvature. The striking platforms on this
type range from single to multi-faceted, although single and double faceting is
most common. These flakes are usually removed with a hard hammerstone or
large billet, and the dorsal flake scarring is indicative of sequential flake removals
and flake removals from opposite edges (Mehalchick et al. 1996). In the system
employed during this analysis, overshot flakes are classified as biface
manufacture flakes.

Â

Biface Thinning/Resharpening Flakes (n=35). In other studies, biface thinning
flakes have been separated from biface resharpening flakes (cf. Mehalchick et al.
1996), but because much of the distinction between the two is based on the
presence of use-wear, this study did not attempt any such separation. These types
of flakes are generally tertiary flakes which were removed by pressure or by a soft
hammerstone or billet. They are characterized by a moderate to large number of
dorsal flake removal scars, but unlike biface manufacture flakes, this type has
shallow flake scar ridges. Longitudinal curvature ranges from moderate to slight
depending on the type of parent artifact. The striking platform is generally
multifaceted and may be ground (although this was not coded), with some lipping
on the ventral edge (Mehalchick et al. 1996).

Â

Uniface Manufacture/Resharpening Flakes (n=1). As with biface thinning and
resharpening flakes, the primary distinction between uniface manufacture and
uniface resharpening flakes is that uniface resharpening flakes show evidence of
use wear on the platforms. For the purposes of this study, the two flake types are
treated as one category. These flakes are generally small to medium in size no
bigger than two centimeters, with single-faceted platforms. Often, there is a slight
longitudinal curvature at the distal end of the flake, usually accompanied by a
discernable ridge oriented perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the flake. This
ridge is formed by the intersection of the original dorsal surface of the blank and
the subsequent flakes scars originating from the lateral edges of the blank. Other
characteristics of uniface manufacture/resharpening flakes are that the dorsal
surface generally is marked by a series of parallel flake scars and small step
fractures, the result of use or previous manufacture activity, at the proximal end
(Mehalchick et al. 1996).

111

Archeological Investigations at Lake Whitney, Bosque, Hill, and Johnson Counties, Texas

112

Â

Blades (n=5). Generally, a blade is defined as a flake that is twice as long as it is
wide (Mehalchick et al. 1996), although in this study, the definition is restricted to
flakes removed from a blade core. These flakes are characterized by single or
multiple dorsal ridges that are roughly parallel to the longitudinal axis of the
flake. These ridges are indicative of earlier blade removals. The longitudinal
curvature of blades is slight to moderate. Striking platforms are generally single
or corticate faceted, although double and multiple-faceted platforms occur as well
(Mehalchick et al. 1996).

Â

Platform Preparation and/or Core Preparation Flakes (n=131). Platform and core
preparation flakes are highly variable in size, shape, amount of dorsal cortex, and
platform faceting, but they all represent an attempt to prepare a platform or core
for subsequent flake removals. Size and platform faceting are dependent upon the
stage of reduction during which they were removed and the size of the parent
material which may be a core or artifact. Likewise, shape is dependent on the type
of core from which they were removed. The amount of dorsal cortex is also
highly variable, ranging from 0 percent to 100 percent, depending on the stage of
reduction (Mehalchick et al. 1996).

Â

Notching Flakes (n=1). These small flakes are usually 5â15 mm long, and are
removed by pressure flaking during the creation of notches on projectile points or
other notched tools. The flakes have distinctive U-shaped platforms and scalloped
dorsal surfaces indicative of prior notching flake removals (Mehalchick et al.
1996).

Â

Sequence Flakes (n=3). Sequence flakes are indicative of a particular core
reduction strategy in which a cobble is first split lengthwise and then flakes are
removed in sequence beginning at one end of the core. These flakes can be
recognized by a double-negative bulb centered above or on the platform with a
tabular surface. Sequence flakes are unique to a particular type of core
technology, but without a series of them, they are most likely accidental in nature
(Jelinek et al. 1971). This method of flake removal may have been useful in an
environment where raw material was commonly available as tubular cobbles
rather than as tabular or spherical cobbles.

Â

Channel Flakes (n=0). Channel flakes are produced as a result of fluting
projectile points. They are most commonly found on Paleoindian sites, but may
also be found where later point types such as Pedernales have been fluted. âThey
are generally parallel-sided, flat in longitudinal section, slightly plano-convex in
lateral cross section, and have well prepared, isolated, ground platformsâ. (Frison
and Bradley 1980:26).

Â

Indeterminate Flakes (n=1). If a flake could not be assigned with certainty to one
of the types described above, it was coded as indeterminate. Generally, flakes

Ecological Communications Corporation

Archeological Investigations at Lake Whitney, Bosque, Hill, and Johnson Counties, Texas

displaying attributes associated with two or more different types were included in
the indeterminate category.
Table 10-3 summarizes the variety of raw materials represented in the assemblage of
complete flakes. The site occupants clearly preferred fine grained chert. Sixty one of
the complete flakes (22 percent) had been heated. It would appear that the manufacturing
of bifaces took place at the site. The use of Â¼-inch screen through which uniface
manufacturing/resharpening flakes would likely pass, may skew that data. However, as
discussed above, no formally shaped unifaces were discovered. Over half of the whole
flakes (n=146) exhibited slight edge damage, not uncommon in clayey soils.

Hammerstone
A purple quartzite hammerstone was found in Unit 1 between 20-30 cm. Except for a
single flake scar along one rounded edge, it is a complete specimen, measuring 6.7 cm
long, 5.7 cmwide, and 3 cm thick. It has deep pock marks from apparent battering on
two lateral edges.

10.4.2 Other Items
Miscellaneous items recovered include worked mussel shells, ocher, and a limestone
concretion.
Â

Ocher. A piece of soft red ocher (Figure 10-10) was found in Unit 1 between
70-80 cmbs. It weighs 2 grams, measures 2.51 cm by 13.3 cm by 8.3 cm, and is
slightly encrusted with calcium carbonate on both faces. No evidence of
smoothing or striations were observed, so the item may not have been used.

Â

Mussel shell pendant. A fragile pendant made from a mussel shell (Figure 10-10)
was found in Unit 2, 20-30 cmbs. It appears to have been drilled and notched. The
hole in the middle exhibits a smoothed interior surface.

Â

Possible Mussel shell pendant. This specimen collected from Unit 1, between 6070 cm may have been drilled, but because it is slightly shattered such evidence
does not remain. It was singled out because it was the only mussel shell in the
unit that had a hole in it and was also much larger than the others (Figure 10-10)
It weighs 41 grams and measures 6.35 cm by 7.25 cm, and the hole measures 1.16
cm by 1.29 cm. Its ventral surface is heavily encrusted with calcium carbonate.

Â

Limestone concretion. A limestone concretion that seemed out of context with
the associated cultural and non-cultural material in Unit 1 between 70-80 cmbs
was collected for further examination. Other than apparent reddening from
exposure to heat possibly in a cooking feature, there is no evidence that it has
been culturally altered.

10.4.3 Subsistence Items
Snails
Snails as Evidence of Paleoenvironment
The Dawson and Yarbrough-like dart points collected from Unit 1, 90-100 cmbs suggests
a Late Archaic occupation sometime between 1650-150 BC. This places it in the Late
Holocene (4000 BP-present).
There are indicators that climate fluctuated in the Late Holocene. Nordt et al. (1994)
suggest a warm and dry episode between 3000 and 1500 BP based on stable carbon ratios
from deposits at Fort Hood. Grass pollen frequencies in the Weakly Bog pollen spectra
indicate drying episodes at 1600-1500 BP and 500-400 BP (Bousman 1994:80).
Brown (1998) demonstrated that the mean oxygen isotope values for fresh water mussel
shells from Denton Creek (41DL270) in the north-central Texas area can be used to make
general inferences about past air and water temperatures, rainfall, and evaporation.
Higher isotope values occurring in mussel shells from dated contexts suggests a cool and
wet climate around 3500 BP a warm, dry climate around 2850 BP, then cooling off and
becoming wetter between 2500 and 1500 BP, and finally a warming trend occurring after
1500 BP (Brown 1998:164). The conclusions reached from Brownâs study of fresh water
mussels are generally comparable to those of Humphrey and Ferringâs (1994) study of
soil carbonate stable isotopes.
The carbon isotope data from north-central Texas indicates that between 4500 and 2000
BP the climate was moist, but began drying by 2000 BP, and for the next 500 years the
area was much drier. However, around 1500 BP another shift occurred, and after 1500 BP
the climate again returned to wetter conditions. Data from Ferndale Bog suggests oaks
and pines, which adapt to drier conditions, peaked around 700 years ago, dropping in
quantity slightly through the present, while sedges have increased significantly in the past
few hundred years (Bryant and Holloway 1985). In sum, at the time 41JN59 was
occupied, it was apparently nearing the end of a dry period during which grasslands
dominated the landscape, but approaching a climate not too unlike the present.
Using snail species as an indicator of environment can be accomplished through various
means. One of the less scientific, but viable means is by examining species diversity.
Goodfriend (1986:204) submits that âBecause of the low mobility of land snails, their
populations tend to reflect geographical variation of the environment, with little blurring
of this pattern.â In studying grasslands versus wooded habitats in Central Texas,
Randolph (1973) found that Rabdotus selectively thrive in grasslands. Grasslands are
considered to be a higher variable environmental habitat for snail reproduction than are
woodlands. Randolph demonstrated that in the higher variable grasslands, snail species
diversity was less than in a woodlands habitat. Cheatum and Fullington (1971:2) also
found that âWith the exception of east Texas, snails are found in greater numbers and in a

Ecological Communications Corporation

115

Archeological Investigations at Lake Whitney, Bosque, Hill, and Johnson Counties, Texas

greater variety of species in woodlands along water courses where limestone
outcroppings occur.â Of the 331 snails collected at 41JN59, all but one were Rabdotus,
indicating extremely limited diversity in species, and implying that grasslands were
prevalent over woodlands when the site was occupied ca. 4650-4050 BP.
Snails as Indicators of Seasonality
Snails burrow deep and become dormant during cold weather in the winter, or to escape
long periods of drought. In the summer, some may be above the surface in a state of
dormancy to conserve energy. Metcalf (1998:179) has opined that ââ¦land snails seem to
have been gathered and brought to camp. They may have been found and collected at any
time of the year, but perhaps it was especially easy to collect them at times when snails
were dormant and attached to various plants.â However, Malofâs gathering of snails for
his MA Thesis (2001:114) proved that ââ¦snails will be most visible during rainy
periods.â Experimenting with Polygyridae and Rabdotus snails, both indigenous to
Texas, Randolph (1973) also found that they are most active when it rains, and they tend
to climb well above the surface. During hot, dry periods, the Polygridae tend to hide
under vegetation lying on the surface, while the Rabdotus tend to cling to vegetation 2040 cm above the surface, taking adavantage of increased air convection at that level.
Rainfall and temperature data collected by the Cleburne Weather Station in Johnson
County from 1931 through 1990 (World Climate:2008) indicates the rainiest months are
April and May, with temperature data indicating a typical seasonal pattern.
Snails as a Food Source
Several archeologists (e.g., Simmons 1956; Allen and Cheatum 1960; Jelks 1962;
Johnson 1964; Hester 1995, 2000) have long believed that snails, specifically Rabdotus,
were a part of prehistoric diets. And quite frequently, Cabeza de Vacaâs observations are
cited as a first-hand account of snails being consumed by Native American groups in
protohistoric times (Favata and FernÃ¡ndez 1993).
Snails (particularly Rabdotus) are prevalent on many archeological sites in Texas. Some
researchers (e.g., Matteson 1959; Neck 1987) assert that they are drawn by calcium-rich
mussel shells also commonly found in abundance and in association with large quantities
of Rabdotus (e.g., Nickels 2000). This could possibly the case at 41JN59. Although it is
inconclusive whether snails feast and thrive on living or dead organisms (both plant and
animal) many researchers (e.g., Mueggenborg 1994; Neck 1994; Wright 1997) believe
snails are attracted in large quantities to the decomposing organics left behind in
prehistoric cultural middens. On the other hand, Brown (2002:248) points out that the
snails may be attracted not to the human organic garbage, but rather to the lush, moist
vegetation that springs up in the enriched soils soon after a site is abandoned, but before
it is entirely covered over; this would account for the direct association of snails with
middens. Problematic with this argument, however, is that if middens accumulate with
repeated and continuous use, then snails should only be present in the uppermost portion

116

Ecological Communications Corporation

Archeological Investigations at Lake Whitney, Bosque, Hill, and Johnson Counties, Texas

of the midden (Brown 2002:248). Such is not the case in most midden deposits, where
snails are prevalent throughout (e.g., Mueggenborg 1994).
Brown (2002:248) opines that it is very doubtful that snails would naturally be attracted
to, or survive on an archeological site while it was occupied for several reasons: 1) the
intended and unintended clearing of vegetation would remove both the vegetal nutrients
presumably consumed by snails; 2) cleared areas allow for the moisture snails need to
evaporate quickly; 3) the compacted soils from human use would contribute to a
significant decrease in the moisture absorption needed for snails to survive, and; 4) the
mere trampling by humans would kill the snails. In sum, at the Smith Creek Bridge site
(41DW70) he believes Rabdotus were most likely gathered as a food source while the site
was occupied, and they then were attracted to the site during periods of human
abandonment. That being the case, then larger snail population densities should overlie
cultural stata, not embedded within it (Brown 2002:265).
Neck (1994:496) suggests that if the snail population in an archeological context are both
juveniles and and adults, then it is likely that they were very much alive and producing
young while occupying the site. On the other hand, if only the larger adults are found,
then it could be that they were the ones selectively gathered, brought to the site, and
prepared for human consumption. Following his analysis of gastropod remains at
41MV120, a stratifed Late Archaic site in Maverick County, Metcalf (1998:176-181)
concluded that the overabundant ratio of mature Rabdotus to juveniles indicated that they
were being brought to the site for human consumption. He further cites several examples
of archeological sites, as well as ethnographic accounts where the same practice was
implied.
Following the protocol of Cheatum and Fullington (1971), Malof (2001), and Brown
(2002), the 330 Rabdotus snails recovered from 41JN59 were analyzed to determine their
adult or juvenile status. Specifically, they were examined first and foremost for the
presence or absence of a carina ridge at the top of the whorl, extending from the base of
the aperture. A Rabdotus with no carina ridge is considered a mature adult. A Rabdotus
with a carina ridge, but not prominent, is considered as a mature juvenile (possibly
adolescent). A Rabdotus with a pronounced carina ridge is considered as an immature
juvenile. Other attribues recorded were the degree of development of an apertural ridge,
and the presence or absence of a fully developed callus. One that is fully developed
should exhibit a sheen in appearance. Mature adults should have both a fully developed
ridge and callus. Measurements were then taken of the snailâs body length and aperature
length (equaling total body length), as well as the snailâs body width.
Of the 330 Rabdotus, seven were damaged so that they could neither be categorized as
adults nor juveniles, leaving 323 identifable; 94 percent (n=304) were adults, and 6
percent (n=19) were juveniles. The adults ranged in body width from 0.96 cm to 2.3 cm,
while the juveniles ranged in body width from 0.58 cm to 1.19 cm. The ratio of adults to
juveniles (16:1) is admittedly problematic because Â¼-inch screen (0.64 cm) was used to
collect the snails, and the number of juveniles that may have passed through the screen is

Ecological Communications Corporation

117

Archeological Investigations at Lake Whitney, Bosque, Hill, and Johnson Counties, Texas

inknown. Nevertheless, of the 19 juveniles that were caught by the Â¼-inch screen, 18
were wider than Â¼-inch (.64 cm).
Removing snails from their shells for consumption can be difficult. However,
experiments have shown that the easiest way is to place them in cold water, and bringing
it to a boil. The snails react by protruding a small portion of their body from the heated
shell. They can then be easily extracted using a sharp instrument (Cheatum and
Fullington 1971; Malof 2001). Notably, of the 330 Rabdotus found at 41JN59, 279 (84.5
percent) exhibited minimal or no shell damage so that sufficient measurements could be
obtained, suggesting they were extracted being boiled instead of having to break the
shells. In addition, few showed of evidence of burning. Those shells that did appear to
have been exposed to flames could have been deposited in fire after the snails were
extracted.
In sum, Brownâs (2002) analysis of several species of snails at 41DW70, as well as a
Masterâs Thesis by Andy Malof (2001) provide both theoretical and innovative
methodological approaches to answering the question of why there are so many snails on
archeological sites. The ratio of adults to juveniles at 41JN59 suggests that the Rabdotus
were being collected and brought to the site for human consumption.
Arguing that the snails collected during this project were a part of the subsistence base,
we feel justified in using snail densities as corroborating evidence for human occupation.
Regardless of the reason the snails are present, a general consensus seems to be that snail
densities increase and decrease commensurate with increases and decreases in cultural
remains densities, such as flakes (e.g., see Brown 2002; Nickels 2000).
Mussels
A total of 110 mussel shell umbos were counted within the 942 total grams of mussel
shells found (Appendix B). Fresh water mussel shells are commonly found on
archeological sites throughout Texas, and are still thriving today in some bodies of water
(Howell et al. 1996). Although they are not high in nutritional value, they were undoubtedly an important supplement (Neck 1982; Parmalee and Klippel 1974).
Vertebrate Fauna
Although only 42 total grams of heavily shattered faunal remains were recovered, all
from Unit 1 (Appendix B), the small sample is fairly well preserved. An informal
analysis indicates the presence of probable deer, small mammals, and a large bird.
Attributes recorded on each piece if they could be discerned included the degrees of
weathering and burning if any, and the breakage type. In addition, each item was
examined for was examined for evidence of gnawing or cut marks. Weathering,
chemical etching, burning, breakage, and gnawing by other animals causes taphonomic
wasting. Taphonomic wasting can then be used to infer subsistence habits.

118

Archeological Investigations at Lake Whitney, Bosque, Hill, and Johnson Counties, Texas

Because of the highly fragmented nature of the assemblage, an estimation of minimum
number of individuals (MNI) or number of identifiable specimens (NISP) was
impossible. Therefore fragments from the same provenience that appeared to be from the
same animal were placed into 13 separate lots. One additional highly carbonized piece of
probable deer bone was pulled from the assemblage for potential dating. It was
carbonized to a degree that none of the described attributes beyond burning could be
recorded.
Weathering
No evidence of weathering was observed on any of the pieces, suggesting that weathering
was apparently not a significant factor in the taphonomic wasting of faunal remains at
this site.
Chemical etching
Signs of chemical etching in the form of irregular pitting and pock marks was present on
all bone in all 13 lots. This etching was limited to random and irregular pitting along the
bonesâ surfaces. In this case, the sometimes common root and rootlet systems, along
with demonstrated leaching of pH in Unit 1 are believed to be the cause for the etch
marks observed on the entire assemblage.
Burning
With caution regarding possible range fires, bones that were smoke-stained or charred,
are interpreted as being roasted by humans (Lyman 1994a:389). Nine out of 13 lots
showed no evidence of being exposed to heat. The inference is that the meat was stripped
from the bone before being cooked, and the bones tossed away from the fire. Three lots
had calcined bones. These bones are presumed to have been thrown into the fire after the
meat was stripped from them. One lot had been charred; the presumption here is that the
meat was roasted on the bone. Admittedly problematic because of the nature of the
assemblage, it can be said that the probable deer bones were both unburned and calcined,
the probable small mammal bones were all unburned, and the probable large bird bones
were charred.
Breakage
The bones in nine of the 13 lots had angular fractures, with the remaining four exhibiting
spiral breakage. The rib bone exhibited an angular break as expected. However, six of
the nine long bones had angular fractures, infering that they had been broken open to
expose the marrow.
Gnawing
Tiny rodent-size gnawing marks were observed on two bones. All others apparently had
not been disturbed by gnawing carnivores, but the degrees of chemical etching may have

Ecological Communications Corporation

119

Archeological Investigations at Lake Whitney, Bosque, Hill, and Johnson Counties, Texas

erased some evidence for that. Although very limited, the overall inference of rodent
gnawing on two pieces and the overall absence on the remaining pieces is that the bones
were not exposed to the surface very long, suggesting a rapid deposition, perhaps over a
yearâs seasonal cycle.

10.4.5 Radiocarbon Dating
A fully carbonized piece of bone was found in Unit 1 between 70-80 cm. The specimen
was submitted to Beta Analytic for AMS testing (BETA Lab #242419) and yielded a
radiocarbon age of 3670 Â± 40 BP (Table 10-4; Appendix L). This date equates to the
early stages of the Late Archaic.

10.4.6 Analysis
The vertical distribution of artifacts within distinct soil zones strongly suggests two
occupations at the site. Specifically, an upper occupation zone was identified between
10-20 cmbs in Unit 2 and in 20-30 cmbs in Unit 1, and a lower occupation zone was
identified between 30-40 cmbs in Unit 2 and in 70-90 cmbs in Unit 1.
Sedimentation Rates
Notably, Unit 2 is positioned on a T2 terrace, higher on the landscape than Unit 1 on a T1
terrace. Dense gravels and sterile clay was encountered 60 cmbs in Unit 2, and
fragmented bedrock was encountered at 100 cmbs in Unit 1. It would appear that the
same components are represented in both units, the difference in depths being a matter of
soil deposition rates on the T1 versus T2 terrace. Although no diagnostics were recovered
in Unit 2, a Dawson and a Yarbrough preform were found in Unit 1. The Dawson was
located between 80-90 cmbs, and the Yarbrough was found exactly at 90 cmbs. Given
approximate dates for both points as spanning the period 3650-2150 BP (Fields 2004),
and assuming constant and uninterrupted aggradation, sedimentation rates along the T1
terrace could range from 2.47 cm to 4.19 cm every 100 years.
Lithic Technology
As discussed above, the types of flakes present together with bifaces and bifacial cores
suggest a predominantly bifacial technology this site. The following analysis examines
flake attributes to evaluate possible differences in lithic technology between the two
components. Statistical analysis allows evaluation of differences and similarities in

technological assemblages, and here adjusted residuals as well as row and column
percentages are used to identify significant patterns. Adjusted residuals measure the
difference between observed and expected values in contingency table cells, and converts
this difference to a z-score (Haberman 1978; Norusis 1999). Adjusted residuals with the
value of either +1.96 or greater, or -1.96 or less are considered significant (a more
complete explanation is presented below).
The first step in a contingency table analysis is to separate the table into row and column
variables, tabulate the individual cell values, and sum the row and column tables. Then
expected values are calculated. In doing so, we assume that the percentage of each type
or class will remain the same as the overall percentages for each type or class. Next, in a
contingency table analysis is to examine the difference between the observed value and
the expected value of each cell. However, these numbers may not be useful, depending
on the sample size of each type or class to be compared. The variation in sample size can
be offset by examining the difference between the observed and expected values in each
cell and then dividing this number by the square root of that cellâs expected value. The
result is called the standardized residual:
Standardized Residual = Oi-E//(Ei)
Although standardized residuals are not easily interpreted in statistical terms, if they are
divided by their estimated variance for each individual cell, then the interpretation is
much more straightforward. The result of this calculation is called the adjusted residual.
Adjusted residuals have the same distribution as a z-score, and thus can be easily
interpreted in terms of significance. For purposes of this analysis, a 5 percent level of
significance will be used, which equates to an adjusted residual of greater than 1.96 or
less than 1.96.
Flakes
Table 10-5 presents the results of calculating adjusted residuals comparing flake sizes
(measured in cm3) in the upper components of Units 1 and 2. The only slightly significant
differences in the two assemblage is in the 2.1 cm to 3 cm range. More flakes of that size
were recovered from Unit 2 than were expected, while fewer than expected were found in
Unit 1. Otherwise, the flake sizes are what would be expected if the lithic reduction
stages were the same in both of the upper components.
Table 10-6 presents similar flake size data from the lower components of Units 1 and 2.
The only slightly significant differences in the two assemblages is in the smaller than 0.5
cm range. More flakes of that size were recovered from Unit 2 than were expected, while
fewer than expected were found in Unit 1. This could be due to later stage reduction
activities occurring on the upper terrace in the area of Unit 2. Otherwise, the flake sizes
are what would be expected if the lithic reduction stages were the same in both of the
lower components.

Next, we combined data and compared the complete flake sizes in the upper and lower
components of both units (Table 10-7). Note that there are significant differences
between the two components on the smallest flake sizes and the larger flake sizes. These
data suggest that there is more late stage reduction activity occurring in the lower
component than in the upper component, yet more early stage reduction as well.
To further evaluate lithic reduction stages we used the percentage of cortex present on the
complete flakes (Table 10-8). There is no statistically significant difference in the amount
of cortex remaining on the flakes in the upper component versus those in the lower
component. These data suggest then suggest that there is little difference in reduction
strategies between the two components.

Next, flake types were reviewed to explore any differences between the two components.
Notably, 185 of the 193 complete flakes were either biface manufacturing, biface
thinning, or platform/core preparation flakes. Those data are shown in Table 10-9. It is
clear that core reduction and bifacial manufacturing technology occurred during both
occupations. However, the significant increase in bifacial thinning flakes in the upper
component would imply that bifaces were in their final stage of production. Conversely,
the data would suggest that bifaces were being manufactured in the lower component, but
generally not reduced to a finished form.

Bifaces
Lower Component
In the upper component, two of four bifaces (50 percent) were in their late stage of
reduction, and in the lower component five of ten (50 percent) were in their late stage.
Although the complete flake data does not appear to corroborate the stages of reduction
recorded on the bifaces recovered from the two components, a site analysis should
include not only those artifacts left behind, but should also consider those that are
missing from the assemblage. Excluding the Clear Fork gouge, ten bifaces were
recovered from the lower component in Units 1 and 2. The complete flake data suggest
that late stage, completed bifacial tools were not being manufactured in large numbers in
the lower component, but instead they were being brought to the site, and once used up or
broken were discarded. Notably, six of the ten bifaces in the lower component were
broken. Of those, four (40 percent) appear to have been broken during manufacture, three
(30 percent) were broken post-depositionally, and the cause of breakage on the remaining
three (30 percent) could not be determined. The flake data and biface data once again
complement each other by suggesting that while at the site, a limited number of new,
completed bifacial tools were being manufactured for use while at the site. The relatively
larger number of biface manufacturing flakes suggests that bifaces were being reduced to
a portable size and weight for transport to the next campsite or hunting expedition where
quality raw material may not have been readily available.
Upper Component
Although only four bifaces were found in the upper component, all in Unit 2, data
recorded on them can be useful when comparing flake datasets. Two of the bifaces (50
percent) were reduced to a late stage, presumably finished tool. One was completed to a
middle stage, and one only worked to an early stage. One was broken during
manufacture, one during use, and the cause of breakage on the remaining two could not
be determined. The complete flake data appears to corroborate the biface data, with both
suggesting that final stage, completed tools were being manufactured in greater numbers
in the upper component than in the lower component. At the same time, some core
reduction and biface manufacturing was occurring, but to a much lesser degree than in
the lower component. This could be the result of different subsistence and mobility
patterns that represented in the lower component occupation, or possibly a shortage of
raw material at or near the site.
Cores
Five cores and core fragments were found in the lower component, but only one in the
upper component. Two of the five (40 percent) exhibited bi-directional or multidirectional flake scars. Although the prevalence of multi-directionally flaked cores is
compatible with the prevalence of expedient and minimally retouched unifaces in the
chipped stone assemblage, and is analogous with Late Prehistoric assemblages usually

124

Ecological Communications Corporation

thought to consist of expediently produced stone tools from nonstandardized cores, and
specialized tools such as end scrapers and side scrapers (Collins 1995; Hester 1995), that
does not appear to be the case here. Unifaces are few in number, and there are no formal
scrapers in the entire assemblage. Assuming the multi-directional cores here were used
for biface production, these numbers complement the complete flake and biface data; a
significantly greater number of biface manufacturing flakes in the lower component
represent a significant increase in the second stage of bifacial core reduction, and that the
production of probable bifacial blanks for transport elsewhere was likely occurring. Also,
the greater number of cores and flakes suggest that raw material was readily available at
or near the site while the lower component was occupied. Likewise, while the upper
component was occupied, the one bi-directional core, with relatively fewer biface
manufacturing flakes, and a greater number of finished bifaces, suggests that the
reduction strategy focused on finishing tools rather than manufacturing them through the
initial stages of production. Once again, this could represent changes in subsistence and
mobility strategies, and/or raw material availability between the two site occupations.
Unifaces
Eight unifaces were found in the lower component compared to one in the upper
component, indication that the occupants of both components employed some usage of
unifaces in their stone tool assemblage. Of the eight in the upper component, three (37.5
percent) had been expediently used without any preparation flaking, and the remaining
five (62.5 percent) had been only minimally shaped; there were no formally finished
unifaces. This observation alone suggests that the occupants of the lower component
were practicing expedient core reduction to simply knock off a sharp flake, perhaps
sharpen it or shape it only slightly, and then use it for cutting or scraping. The relative
degree to which they may have employed this expedient tool technology versus formal
bifacial technology can be measured when the core, flake, and biface datasets are
introduced.
Once again employing statistical methods to evaluate the degrees of bifacial and unifacial
technology employed in each of the two components, Table 10-10 shows the already
demonstrated statistically significant difference in bifacial flakes between the two
components. But more importantly, the data indicate that although bifacial technology
was predominant, when unifacial technology products are compared against the entire
tool assemblage, the use of unifacial tools was equally important to the occupants of both
components.
10.5

SUMMARY

Several lines of data have been used to evaluate the vertical integrity of the site. These
data indicate the presence of two isolated and intact buried cultural deposits and suggest
an overall high integrity in the portion of 41JN59 tested during this project. Cultural
materials in the upper component are concentrated in an apparent horizontal continuum
discovered between 20-30 cmbs in Unit 1 on the T1 terrace, and sloping upward to Unit
2 on the T2 terrace to 10-20 cmbs. Cultural materials in the lower component are also

concentrated in an apparent horizontal continuum exposed between 70-90 cmbs in Unit 1,
and again between 30-40 cmbs in Unit 2. Data from soil samples taken in Unit 1
corroborate the high integrity of both occupations. Diagnostic Dawson and Yarbrough
points suggest that the lower component was occupied sometime between 1650 BC and
150 BC
A wide diet breadth is suggested by the subsistence items recovered from the relatively
limited excavations. Snails may have been a supplemental food source in a broad diet
scheme. Snails as a food source suggests an occupation of the site other than during
winter, and possibly other than during a long, dry summer. Snails burrow deep and
become dormant during cold weather, or to escape long periods of drought. Also, the
exploitation of mussels as a food source suggests a late summer or early fall occupation
when water levels are low. The attributes recorded on the limited faunal assemblage
suggests that the bones were buried rather rapidly, perhaps in single flooding events or
fall dense leaf covers.
Technologically, the occupants of both components were using primarily bifacial tools,
although expediently utilized or slightly retouched flakes were also a minor part of their
tool kit. The data from the lower component suggests that while at the site, a limited
number of new, completed bifacial tools were being manufactured for use while at the
site. Other bifaces were being reduced to a portable size and weight for transport to the
next campsite or hunting expedition where quality raw material may not have been
readily available. Data from the upper component suggests that completed bifacial tools
were being manufactured in greater numbers than in the lower component, but not to the
finished product as seen in the lower component. This phenomenon could be the result of
a difference in subsistence and mobility patterns from that of the lower component
occupation, or possibly a shortage of raw material at or near the site at the time of
occupation.
Finally, it cannot be said that the occupants were not without some form of style. To wit,
a very finely worked shell pendant, another larger possibly drilled shell pendant, and a
piece of red ocher were recovered.

10.5.1 Conclusions and Recommendations
At 41JN59, an abundance of data sets has been obtained from only two excavation units.
Specifically, diagnostic projectile points, identifiable diversity in stone tool technology,
datable carbonized bone, a diversity of well preserved subsistence remains (bone, snails,
mussels), and evidence of style forms were found in two clearly distinct upper and lower
cultural occupation zones. Based on the analysis of the diagnostic projectile points found
during the excavation of the two units and the carbonized bone sample submitted to Beta
Analytic for AMS testing, the lower component dates to the Late Archaic. The upper
component however cannot be accurately dated due to the lack of diagnostic materials.
In sum, the site meets the guidelines set forth for nomination to the National Register of
Historic Places under criterion D. Site 41JN59 should be avoided, preserved and
protected.
Future Research Issues
Some of the following research issues can be pursued with limited effort, while others
require a much more extensive investigation. Additional excavations at 41JN59 may
provide an adequate sample size to address all of them. We also acknowledge that these
few research issues can naturally branch into several others.
1) Subsistence and mobility. This site has demonstrated data necessary for a detailed
study of diet breadth, optimal foraging, and seasonal mobility both at the site and
within the North-central Texas region.
a) Vertebrate faunal diversity. Even with a small collection, potentially three
different vertebrate species were identitified, suggesting a diet breadth worthy of
further investigation with a larger sample size.
b) Botanical remains. Floatation samples should be collected and examined for
charred plant material.

c) Fish Otoliths. The site is adjacent to a major river and screens with smaller
openings may trap fish otoliths which can inform on diet as well as seasonality
and paleoenvironment.
d) Mussels and Snails. A more in depth study of these items could provide
significant information on seasonality and the paleoenvironment. Dating by snail
amino acid racemization may be possible with further study.
2) Stone tool technology. Smaller screen openings could trap tool resharpening
manufacturing flakes that could reveal additional information regarding tool use and
their application to subsistence and mobility.

127

Archeological Investigations at Lake Whitney, Bosque, Hill, and Johnson Counties, Texas

3) Raw Material. A variety of lithic raw material types were identified in the
assemblage. The data from the current excavations in some cases suggests that raw
material may have not been available at certain times at this site, or that the occupants
were preparing for movement to an area where raw material availability was either
unknown or scarce. Raw material deposits in the area or region should be mapped,
samples collected, and those then compared with the site artifacts. Also, a few
sequence flakes were identified in the 41JN59 assemblage. Normally, these result
from reducing tabular raw material.
4) Archeomagnetic Studies. Samples should be collected from burned rocks and clay
that can provide temperature and integrity of campfire remains.
5) Geomorphology. Although some studies have been conducted along the Brazos
River on a macro scale, a study in the immediate area of the site along the Brazos and
intermediate drainage on the east edge of the site should reveal significant
information regarding sediment deposition and site formation processes.

11.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
The archeological inventory surveyed 555 acres in four parcels including 229 acres in
Bosque County, 291 acres in Hill County, and 35 acres in Johnson County. Individual
sizes of the four parcels ranged from 19 acres to 275 acres. The pedestrian survey was
accompanied by excavation of 374 shovel tests for a net rate of two tests per three acres
(0.67 ST/acre). Six previously unknown archeological sites were discovered and
documented (Table 11-1).

Site 41HI296 is the remains of the historic Kimball homestead. Abundant artifacts
demonstrate a continuum of site occupation from about 1870 through about 1950. The
site represents an early farmstead in a region that was very sparsely inhabited until the
1880s. With further archival study and archeological field research the site may be
determined to have potential to inform studies of early farming and settlement in the
region. At the present time, however, the NRHP eligibility of the site is uncertain and it
should be avoided, preserved, and protected.

Site 41HI297 is the razed remains of an early to mid-20th century homestead. No intact
cultural deposits were encountered during shovel testing. The site has no significant
research value and is recommended as not eligible for nomination to the NRHP. No
further management is warranted.
Site 41HI298 is the razed remains of an early to mid-20th century homestead. No intact
cultural deposits were encountered during shovel testing and the artifact assemblage
suggest an occupation after 1930. The site has no significant research value and is
recommended as not eligible for nomination to the NRHP. No further management is
warranted.
Site 41BQ290 consists of the remains of a mid-nineteenth to early-twentieth century
historic homestead. No intact cultural deposits were encountered during shovel testing.
The site has no significant research value and is recommended as not eligible for
nomination to the NRHP. No further management is warranted.
Site 41BQ291 is the remains of the historic Frazier Homestead. The above-ground
components of the site are in poor condition and architecturally lack integrity. Artifacts
indicate an occupation from the middle of the nineteenth through the middle of the
twentieth centuries. Further archival research is needed to establish whether this site is
part of the original Frazier home, or whether it was built during a later period. Further
archeological research is needed to establish whether the site has potential to contribute
new data to the understanding of these people and events. Pending such research, the
NRHP eligibility of the site is currently uncertain and it should be avoided, preserved,
and protected.
Site 41JN59 is a prehistoric open campsite with a burned rock feature and at least two
intact buried stratigraphic components. The lower component dates to the Late Archaic,
based on diagnostic projectile points and AMS testing of a carbonized bone sample. The
upper component cannot be accurately dated due to the lack of diagnostic materials.
Multiple data sets are available including temporally diagnostic projectile points,
diversity in lithic technology, radiometrically datable materials, and a diversity of well
preserved subsistence remains. These are contained within intact buried deposits of high
integrity. The site has high potential for further archeological research; it is
recommended as eligible for nomination to the NRHP under Criterion D and should be
avoided, preserved and protected.

LITHIC SOURCING AT 41JN59
Antonio E. Padilla
Raw material studies have always played an important role when analyzing lithic material
from archeological sites. Not only do such studies identify the potential depositional
sources of raw material, they also may allow archeologists to determine whether lithic
materials found on sites have been made from local raw material, or if they were made
from raw material transported by humans from other areas. In addition, such studies may
help determine the preferred local sources, and the preferred type and quality of raw
material. For this project Ecomm looked at the various lithic materials found during
shovel testing and the excavation of 41JN59, within the project area, and researched the
underlying geology of these areas.
The geological formations that provide the setting for the region surrounding Lake
Whitney is comprised of Lower Creatceous formations derived from the Washita,
Fredericksburg, and Trinity Groups. Washita Group Formations noted within the area
include the Paw Paw (Kpw), Weno Limestone (Kwl), Denton Clay (Kdc), Fort Worth
Limestone (Kwl), and Duck Creek (Kdc). Fredericksburg Group formations mapped
within the area include the Kiamichi (Kki), Edwards Limestone (Ked), Walnut Clay
(Kwa), and Comanche Peak Limestone (Kcp). Formations associated with the Trinity
Group that are mapped in the area include Paluxy Sand (Kpa), Glen Rose (Kgr), and
Twin Mountains (Ktm). Holocene Alluvium (Qal) and Pleistocene fluviatile terrace
deposits (Qt) are mapped along the Brazos River and its tributaries (Sellards et al
1932:270; Barnes 1987).
The following briefly describes the composition of the geologic formations recorded
under the Washita, Fredericksburg, and Trinity Groups. The Paw Paw Formation (Kpw)
is comprised of claystone, mudstone, and sandstone, with marine megafossils and
averages 10-25 feet thick. Weno Limestone (Kwl) is comprised of limestone underlain by
alternating clay and limestone underlain by limestone and averages 2-20 feetthick.
Denton Clay (Kdc) consists of marl, clay, marine megafossils, and limestone alternating
throughout the unit and averaging 6-25 feetthick. Fort Worth Limestone (Kwl) consists of
clay, marine megafossils, and limestone and averages 25-35 feetthick. The Duck Creek
Formation (Kdc) consists of limestone, marine megafossils, and pyrite nodules and
averages 30-300 feetthick. The Kiamichi Formation (Kki) is comprised of limestone,
clay, marine megafossils, and sandstone alternating throughout the formation and
averaging 20-50 feetthick. Edwards Limestone (Ked) is comprised of entirely of
limestone ranging from sharp fragmentary facies to sparry limestone and averages 40
feetthick. Comanche Peak Limestone (Kcp) is comprised of limestone, numerous marine
megafossils, and clay and averages 90 feetthick. Goodland Limestone (Kgl) intergrades
with Comanche Peak Limestone (Kcp) and includes massive resistant limestone beds
with few, thin clay beds and averages 90 feetthick. The Holocene alluvium (Qal) consists
mostly of gravel, sand, silt and silty clays. The Pleistocene fluviatile terrace deposits (Qt)
located along the banks of the reservoir and are comprised of sands, silts, gravels, and
clays of different ages (Barnes 1987).

Based on the underlying geological formations at Lake Whitney, raw materials for lithic
tool manufacturing were widely available to the prehistoric peoples of the area. The
limestone beds found with the formations would have provided the majority of chert for
tool manufacture. These local materials are widely seen throughout the numerous shovel
tests and in the artifact collection of the excavation at 41JN59. The majority of artifacts
collected at 41JN59 consisted of Edwards chert. Included in the artifact assemblage were
other cherts such as a chocolate brown banded chert and a chocolate tan-brown marble
chert, quartz, quartzite, and Ogallala quartzite. Origins of these types of materials are not
know, however it is possible that these items may have been brought in to the area either
by humans or by natural deposition of lag deposits from Pleistocene river systems. Given
that Ogallala quartzite originates form the Ogallala formation in the Llano Estacado it is
possible that these materials (chert, quartz, Ogallala quartzite) found were transported
through these Pleistocene river systems (associated with the Brazos and Red Rivers) that
transverse through the Llano Estacado and were deposited within the Fluviatile terrace
deposits. These materials are typical of what is known as the Uvalde gravels.
Uvalde gravels are not related to the under lying geological formation. Rather, Uvalde
gravels are lag deposits of water-worn cretaceous gravels that are typically found at high
elevations, along ridge tops and upper valley walls, and in matrices of gently rolling
stream divides. Uvalde gravels, a rather generic term for a variety of gravels ranging in
size from pebbles to boulders, and composed of jasper, chert, quartzite, limestone, and
silicified wood, are considered part of the soil rather than a mappable geological unit
(Byrd 1971).
The source of Uvalde gravels in Texas is not exact, and there are no known sources
within the modern major stream basins of Texas containing coarse siliceous gravels.
These siliceous gravels and the large size of some boulders suggest that the transportation
of these gravels must have occurred prior to the formation of existing drainage systems,
explaining the deposits of these gravels at higher elevations (Byrd 1971). The Uvalde
Gravel beds were eroded from Paleozoic and Lower Cretaceous rock formations far to
the west. Uvalde gravels are caliche-cemented gravels which include well-rounded chert,
quartz, and igneous cobbles found on todayâs modern ridgetops (Byrd 1971; Barnes
1987). Although they are now commonly found on ridgetops today, they were once the
ancient riverbeds of robust rivers flowing from the Rocky Mountains. Quite simply, the
gravels formed a firm âcrustâ within the ancient riverbottoms. Then, during the Pleiocene
and Pleistocene epochs, about 15,000 to 5.2 million years ago, as a result of thousands of
years of changes in climate, cohesive downcutting and channel shifting, along with the
uplifting and sinking of landscapes, what were the ancient riverbottoms are now todayâs
modern ridges (Byrd 1971).
The Southern Rocky Mountains located in central New Mexico are a likely source for
both Ogallala and Uvalde gravels. The formation of the Llano Estacado in northwest
Texas occurred from the eastward runoff of ancient streams whose headwaters were
located in the Southern Rocky Mountains, depositing sediments containing both Ogallala

and Uvalde gravels. The Ogallala formation of the Llano Estacado contains the quartzic
material in Uvalde gravels (Byrd 1971).
The Llano Estacado is bound on the North by the Canadian River, and on the West by the
Pecos River in New Mexico. Its eastward front is an escarpment hundreds of feet high
upon which originates the incised headwaters of the Red, Brazos, and Colorado Rivers.
The Pecos River flows southward through Texas into the Rio Grande, while the Red,
Brazos, and Colorado flow southeastward to the Gulf of Mexico. Uvalde gravels are
present in the surrounding areas along these modern alluvial planes, thus making it
probable that the Uvalde gravels found in Texas may very well have been the gravels
carried by ancient alluvium which formed the Llano Estacado (Byrd 1971).
