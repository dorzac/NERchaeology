The Boggy Creek Sites of Washington
County, Texas
ROBERT A. HASSKARL~ JR.

Introduction
AN ARCHEOLOGICAL survey of the Boggy Creek area was initiated in
July, 1955, when mention of it was made by Nathan L. Winfield, Jr.
of Chappe!l Hill, Texas. The Boggy Creek sites (53D5-2) are located
ten yards west of Farm Road 1155 at Long. 96° 15’ and Lat. 30° 122
approximately fourteen miles east of Brenham, Texas.
The initial phase of work done at Boggy Creek involved locating the
main shell midden and testing and locating several nearby sites in
the immediate area. In August, 1955, Dee Ann Suhm and Rudolph C.
Troike of The University of Texas visited the Boggy Creek area and
aided in the work. This basic phase culminated in the partial excavation of the largest site in November, 1955.
The archeology of the surrounding area is very poorly known.
Several small sites have been located, but only at the Boggy Creek sites
have large shell middens been found. "Occasional collecting of projectile points has been under way there since before World War I,"
relates Henry Hughes, a local landowner familiar with the region.
Henry Stzeleske, the present owner of the Boggy Creek sites reports
that, "the hill has always bothered people and in the past several have
dug for gold in it. The time selected for digging was always at night
when the moon was full. Whiskey was poured in a circle around the
area to be dug and then set afire. The fire and the whiskey were to
keep away evil spirits. No one has ever found any gold." Since the late
1800’s, this locality has been populated by Polish immigrants and their
descendants. The folklore of these people about hidden gold is stilI
strong and there are four or five favorite spots which are believed to
contain Indian or Spanish gold.
The landowner’s family was told that they could have all the gold

found as a result of the excavations, and at least one member of the
family was always present while this work was being carried out.
Henry Stzeleske further relates that, "because no crop will grow
on that hill my family has left it alone." As for projectile points found,
he states that he has collected "two shoe boxes of arrow points in the
past and sold them to strangers." Projectile points that members of
his family have found in the fields used for crops "were broken, because they will get wedged in the horses’ hoofs."

Geology and Topography
The surface of this general area is composed of overlapping formations that dip in the direction of the Gulf of Mexico, which is about
eighty miles away. Boggy Creek is located on the edge of the coastal
plain, and is a tributary to New Year Creek, a small stream that flows
into the Brazos River from the west. The present land surface is of
Pleistocene, Oligocene System and Gueydan group origin. The strata of
the Gueydan group are largely pyroclastic sediments consisting of
light-colored ash, tuff, and tuffaceous clays interbedded with lentils of
quartzitic sand and conglomerate (Sellards, Adkins, and Plummer,
1954: 700).
The topography of this region is characterized by rough, rolling,
and dissected terrain about twenty miles wide and located west of the
Brazos River in Washington County.
The stream course of Boggy Creek is fringed with large, old trees
and a discontinuous natural levee of sand and silt. This stream joins
New Year’s Creek, which flows into the Brazos River approximately
four miles away. During flood periods, this stream frequently overflows its banks and inundates wide areas of bottomland, so that the
natural knolls upon which the two larger sites are located are the
only land above water. Perhaps for this reason these locations were
selected by the Indians as places of habitation.
The center of the larger knoll (53DS-2A) was completely excavated
during the 1930’s by the Texas Highway Department (see Fig. 1).
The dirt which was removed from the heart of the knoll was used to
fill county roads. This excavation greatly impaired future archeological work.

The Historic Indians o] the Boggy Creek Area
The Boggy Creek sites are located on the edge of the northern geographic range of the Akokisa Indians. The Han or Akokisa, occu-

pied the eastern end of Galveston Island while the Capoques (Cocos)
of Karankawa affiliation lived on the western end of the island. From
Orobio Bazterra’s information, the location of four or five groups of
Indians in this general area can be made. The Bidai, who occupied
the area around Huntsville, Texas, informed Orobio that the Akokisa
ranged from the Neches River to a point halfway between the Trinity
and Brazos. The Mayeye (Tonkawa) lived west of the Bidai, and
south of them, toward the coast, lived the Cocos. By 1779, these tribes
had united and could be found on the coast between the Colorado and
the Brazos. Occupying the coast, westward from the mouth of the
Brazos, were the Karankawa (Wheat, 1953: 160-161 ).
Other Indian groups occupying Washington County included the
Wacos, on the northern border of the county. Situated between the
Wacos and the Akokisa were the Tonkawa proper. In the west and
southwestern sections were the Tamique and the Xarame.
The Akokisa and related tribes depended upon hunting, fishing, and
food-gathering as their main subsistence. Larger game such as deer
and bear were often hunted. De Bellisle mentions the gathering of
bird eggs in quantity, and the use of shellfish as food. Many local types
of flora were also utilized by these Indians (Wheat, 1953: 161).
Cannibalism is said to have been practiced by the Akokisa, but was
not economically important to them. Only one human bone was found
in the Boggy Creek sites.
No accurate data exists as to the exact house type used by the
Akokisa. Orobio Bazterra mentions that the winter habitations of the
Bidai were bear-skin tents. Because of the geographical closeness of
the" Akokisa and their affiliation with the Bidai, perhaps some similar type of impermanent structure was used by the Akokisa.
Pottery was used by the Akokisa, but descriptive details are lacking. Much of the pottery used by them came from trade with other
Indians rather than being of local manufacture (Wheat, 1953: p. 162).
Since flint is not common in the Boggy Creek area, it also probably came to these people as a result of trading or was transported to
the sites by them. The most common flint found is similar to flint
found in large quantities in the northwestern section of Washington
County in the region occupied by the Tonkawa. However, other varieties of flint were found in the excavations.

Description o] the Boggy Creek Sites
Three sites (Fig. 1) were recorded during the survey of the Boggy
Creek area. Two of these sites occupy high kno!ls south of Boggy

Creek. These are the Central Midden (53D5-2A) and the smaller
South Knoll (53D5-2B). The third site, named the Greek Site, 53D52C) is located at the base of the larger knoll (Central Midden) on the
banks of Boggy Creek. Other sites reported to exist in this region could
not be verified upon investigation.
Central Midden(53DS-2A). As mentioned, this midden has been
the victim of much indiscriminate digging, collecting, and road work
excavation. On the northern slope there remain many shallow depressions, all less than one foot in depth, possibly the result of digging by
both man and animals. The site itself is completely exposed and devoid of any flora with the exception of several local types of grasses.
One of its outstanding characteristics is the presence of inmamerable
mussel shells.
The area for excavation was selected because the surface had the
appearance of having been undisturbed and the dig would cut through
the maximum depth of the midden. A grid system of four-foot squares
was staked off, and excavation was done by levels of 35 crn. Originally
smaller levels were planned, but the low yield in artifacts prompted
a change to 35 cm. levels. All material was screened and the artifacts
were segregated by square and level. Depth was measured from the
surface at the level of the designator stake for that square.
The soil of this site consists of a loose, sandy, dark-colored mixture
of varying proportions of clay. No definite stratification could be seen.
Numerous flint flakes, bone fragments, mussel shells, and small gastropod shells were found in each level. Mussel shells in all levels frequently showed the effects of fire, but fire-fractured rocks (hearthstone fragments) were noted only in levels 4 and 5.
Arrowpoints (Perdiz and Scallorn) were confined to the top level
(see Table 1), in which dart points of types Gary, Morrill, and Palmillas also occurred. Below the top level only dart points were found,
but potsherds were collected from all levels. Gary points are represented in all levels. Kent and Pedernales points were found only in
the three lowest levels (3, 4, and 5) ; and Edgewood, Ellis, and Ensor
points occurred only in levels 2 and 3. Yarbrough points were clustered
in intermediate levels (99,, 3, and 4). Other chipped flint artifacts (gravers, knives, scrapers, and choppers) show no significant vertical distributions.
South Knoll (53DS-2B). This is located about 450 feet south of the
Central Midden and is 10 feet lower in elevation. Here cultural debris
is thickest in the central portion of the knoll, thinning out towards the
perimeter. As at the Central Midden, no plants except native grasses

grow on the surface. Prior to excavation only a few mussel shell fragments could be seen on the surface.
The same excavation procedure was followed as is described above
for the Central Midden. The top layer consists of a tan, sandy soil
with a maximum thickness of eight inches. Below is a dark, sandy
midden deposit having a maximum thickness of l0 inches, and this
stratum produced all of the artifacts found at this site. Below the midden is a very thin (one-inch) layer of white sand, which in turn lies
upon limestone bedrock.
The dark midden zone contained numerous deer bones, one antelope
tooth, and also one human bone. Mussel shells were rarely encountered. Included in the midden were Lange, Morrill, Pandora, and
Pedernales dart points, two knives, and part of a large ceremonial
knife or blade. No arrowpoints or potsherds were encountered. The remainder of the artifacts consisted of gravers, scrapers, and misce]-

are given in Table 2.
Creek Site (53D5-C2). This is located near the main channel of
Boggy Creek about 200 feet north of the Central Midden. The site is
a small oval midden that rests on a sandy natural rise on the east
bank of Boggy Creek at the point where the stream makes a 90° turn
to the northeast. The midden is about 12 feet long (north-south) and
nine feet wide.
Human occupation was indicated by surface debris--hearthstone
fragments, animal bones, mussel shells, and a few artifacts (gravers,
scrapers, heavy bifaces, a chopper, and one unshaped grinding slab).
A small test pit was dug in order to determine the thickness of the
midden deposit. From the grass roots to a depth of 1.8 feet sparse camp
debris occurred in a dark, sandy soil. In this zone (see Table 3) were
both arrowpoints (Perdiz and Scallorn) and dart points (Ellis and
Kent), gravers, knives, scrapers, heavy bifaces, a chopper, a hand
stone, and a few potsherds. The only identifiable animal bones consisted of an antelope tooth and a fragment of deer bone. Although
animal bones were very rare, mussel shells were numerous in this
midden deposit.
Below 1.8 feet to a depth of 3 feet (limit of excavation) no artifacts
were encountered. This zone contained less sand and was somewhat
more consolidated than the midden zone above it.

Food Remains at the Boggy Creek Sites
Throughout the period of occupation represented by the Boggy
Creek sites fresh-water mussels were consistently and abundantly
used for food. The only exception is South Knoll, where mussel shells
were rare. Deer was probably the second most important local source
of food. In the Central Midden deer bones (see Table 4) were found
at all levels, although the concentration in level 5 was heavier than in
the four levels above. In the South Knoll site (see Table 5) there was
much less bone refuse than in the Central Midden, but it was concentrated at depths between 8 and 18 inches. Excavation at the Creek
site yielded no animal bones, yet three fragments were collected from
the surface, one an antelope tooth and the others probably from deer.
Although the excavation sample is small at the Creek site, it would
appear that the occupants relied more on mussels than deer for food.
The rarity of antelope remains suggests that it was not commonly used
for food. As only one human bone occurred at the three sites, it is an
open question as to whether this indicates cannibalism. The low frequency of milling tools at the Boggy Creek sites suggests that certain
plant foods were not commonly utilized in the immediate area.

Ceramics
A total of 14 potsherds was found at the Boggy Creek sites, seven in
the Central Midden and an equal number in the Creek site. These
sherds appear to fall within the type defined as Goose Creek Plain
(Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks, 1954: 378-380).
All of the sherds are small body sherds (Fig. 2, J) and give no indication of vessel forms. Possibly some three to five vessels are represented, judging from wall thickness, temper, and other criteria. Wall
thickness ranges from 5 to 9 ram., with an average of 6 ram. Seven of
the sherds are sand-tempered, and the remaining seven also include
pulverized bone in small amounts. Of the seven sherds from the Central Midden, three show pulverized bone; and of the seven from the
Creek site, four show pulverized bone. Paste texture ranges from
coarse to fine and rather compact. Surface color ranges from orangered through brown, brownish-gray, dark gray and black; core color
ranges from orange-red to black. Both surfaces (interior and exterior)
have been smoothed.
The sherds from the Central Midden were well distributed through
the midden deposit--Level 1 (top), one sherd; Level 2, one sherd;
Level 3, two sherds; Level 4, one sherd; and Level 5, two sherds. Bone
temper was noted in one sherd each from Levels 2, 4, and 5. tt would
appear that pottery was used throughout the occupation of the Central
Midden and that pottery came into use before the introduction of the
bow and arrow. The same situation occurs in the Addicks I~eservoir
some 40 miles southeast of the Boggy Creek sites (Wheat, 1953: 243).

Stone Artifacts
Projectile points from the Boggy Creek sites have been classified
according to the Handbook (Suhm et al., 1954). Most of the points
have also been examined by T. N. Campbell and Dee Ann Suhm of
The University of Texas. No new or provisional types were found at
the Boggy Greek sites.
The types of projectile points found in each of the three sites are
listed in Tables i-3 (see also Fig. 2, A-K). Analyses of these artifacts
and their stratigraphic positions permit certain conclusions to be
drawn about the probable sequence of occupation in the Boggy Creek
area.
Arrowpoints, which appear only in the upper part of the Central
Midden and in the Greek site, evidently represent the latest phase of

occupation. These arrowpoints (Perdiz and Scallorn) were confined to
the top level in the Central Midden (see Table 1), but a few dart
points (Gary, Morrill, and Palmillas) also appeared in the same level.
Below the top level only dart points were found; however, some potsherds were collected from each of the five levels. Lange, Kent, and
Pedernales points were found only in the three lowest levels (3, 4, and
5). Edgewood, Ellis, and Ensor points were found in higher levels (2
and 3, but not in 1), bearing out the common supposition that sidenotched and corner-notched points are relatively late in the Archaic
Stage of Texas.
Other lithic artifacts from the Boggy Creek sites (Fig. 2, L-O) include knives (11 specimens), heavy bifaces (3), choppers (3), endscrapers (6), side-scrapers (20), gravers (20), miscellaneous chipped
flint fragments and unclassifiable specimens (33), and hand stones
(1). As most of these classes of artifacts occurred in each of the three
sites, it is believed that they are best referable to Archaic occupations.
In the Central Midden, with some measure of vertical control, there
seemed to be no significant stratigraphic segregation of any of these
artifact classes.
In October, 1960, after this report had been prepared, four lanceolate knives (Fig. 3) were exposed by erosion in the road cut through
the Central Midden. As these knives were all found at one spot, it is
likely that they represent a cache. They differ from other knives
found at the Boggy Creek sites, and their status cannot be determined
until further work is done in the area.
Summary and Conclusions
As a result of archeological survey work and limited excavation in
1955, information has been obtained on three sites near Boggy Creek
in eastern Washington County, Texas. These sites are in a part of
southeastern Texas that is poorly known archeologically.
The three sites, which are designated Central Midden, South Knoll,
and Creek, are midden sites. The Central Midden and Creek sites contained an abundance of fresh-water mussel shells and can be characterized as shell middens. The Creek site is located on a slope near the
stream, but the other sites are on low elevations farther away from the
stream. No structural features or burials were encountered during
excavation at these sites.
The Central Midden, although badly disturbed, yielded the best
information on the sequence of human occupations along Boggy Creek.

knife found on the surface in

October, 1960, on the road cut through the Central Midden. Apparently this was a cache
of knives, as all four artifacts were found together.

Its lower levels contained artifacts, particularly dart points, attributable to the Archaic Stage, but small amounts of pottery indicate a
transition from the Archaic to the Neo-American Stage. Only in the
uppermost level did arrowpoints occur. The appearance of pottery
before the bow and arrow duplicates a similar sequence reported in the
Addicks Basin some 40 miles to the southeast. The undecorated pottery
from the Central Midden appears to be Goose Creek Plain, which was
found abundantly, along with Goose Creek Incised, in the Addicks
Basin sites (Wheat, 1953).
The Creek site yielded undecorated pottery and arrowpoints, as
well as late Archaic styles of dart points, and presumably had the
same occupational history as the Central Midden. The South Knoll
site, however, contained no pottery and no arrowpoints and appears
to represent occupation earlier in the Archaic Stage than at the other
two sites.
The various peoples who lived along Boggy Creek seem to have
lived by hunting, fishing, and food collecting. No evidence of horti-

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

culture was found. Presumably a seasonal abundance of natural food
products in the Boggy Creek area led to repeated occupations of these
three sites over a considerable span of time.
Acknowledgment. Animal bone identifications from the Boggy
Creek sites were made by Robert A. Hasskarl, M.D.
