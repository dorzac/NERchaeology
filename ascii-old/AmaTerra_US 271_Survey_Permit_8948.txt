Abstract
On behalf of the Texas Department of Transportation, AmaTerra Environmental conducted an
archeological survey for the proposed improvements to US Highway (US) 271, a rural principal
arterial, between Farm-to-Market (FM) 16 and State Loop (SL) 485 on the south side, and between
SL 485 and the Gregg/Upshur County Line at the north end. The US 271 improvements include
widening and reconstruction SL 485, a minor suburban arterial, around Gladewater, Texas that
connects two segments of US 271.
The project is located in Gregg and Smith Counties, Texas. The project was completed in compliance
with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (Section 106) and the Antiquities Code of
Texas (ACT) under Permit no. 8948. Work was conducted June 17–24, 2019 and consisted of a 100
percent intensive pedestrian survey with backhoe trenching within surveyed locations within the APE.
In total, 238 shovel tests and three backhoe trenches were excavated in the APE. Three archeological
sites were recorded: 41SM495, a historic artifact scatter; 41GG132, a multi component site; and
41GG133, a buried prehistoric lithic scatter. Sites 41SM495 and 41GG133 are recommended as
not eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or as a State Antiquities
Landmark (SAL). The historic component of 41GG132 is recommended as not eligible to the NRHP
or as a SAL, but the prehistoric component may be eligible to the NRHP. No further work within the
surveyed portion the APE is warranted with the potential exception of site 41GG132.
In addition to the three newly identified sites, one Isolated Find (IF-1) was recorded. No previously
recorded sites were located within the APE. Sites 41SM495, 41GG133 and IF-1 do not contain
significant, intact archeological deposits within the APE. The prehistoric component of 41GG132 has
potential to contain significant intact deposits, but the historic component has been impacted by
construction and the demolition of structures. No further work is recommended to complete Section
106 and ACT requirements within the surveyed portion of the APE, except at 41GG132, which may
warrant testing. No artifacts were collected as part of this project. All field notes and documentation
will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas.

Management Summary
The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Tyler District proposes improvements to US Highway
(US) 271, a rural principal arterial, between Farm-to-Market (FM) 16 and State Loop (SL) 485 on the
south side, between SL 485 and the Gregg/Upshur County Line at the north end, and SL 485 in
between in Gregg and Smith Counties, Texas. The project is located northeast of Tyler in Gladewater,
Texas.
Proposed improvements include widening and reconstructing the US 271 roadway and includes
widening and reconstructing SL 485, a minor suburban arterial, around Gladewater, TX that connects
two segments of US 271. The proposed improvements to US 271 and SL 485 would add lanes with
inside and outside shoulders, left turn lanes, a curb-and-gutter section, multi-use paths and
sidewalks.
Between FM 16 and SH 135, US 271 would be reconstructed as a four-lane divided section with a
76-foot depressed median, two 12-foot lanes in both directions with 10-foot outside shoulders and
4-foot inside shoulders. From SH 135 to the southern terminus with SL 485, US 271 would be
reconstructed as a five-lane undivided section comprised of two 12-foot travel lanes in both
directions, one 16-foot two-way center left turn lane, and 10-foot outside shoulders. Due to its current
condition, the 1,187.5-foot bridge across the Sabine River would also be reconstructed.
Between US 271 and the UPRR bridge, SL 485 would be widened and reconstructed as a five-lane
undivided section with two 12-foot travel lanes in both directions, one 16-foot two-way center left
turn lane, and 10-foot shoulders. Between the UPRR bridge and US 80, SL 485 would become a fivelane curb and gutter section with 12-foot inside lanes, 14-foot outside lanes, and a 16-foot two-way
center left turn lane. North of US 80 to US 271, SL 485 would be reconstructed as a five-lane
undivided section with two 12-foot travel lanes in both directions, a 16-foot center left turn lane, and
10-foot outside shoulders. Additionally, a 12-foot multiuse path would be constructed just outside
the clear zone of SL 485 and the UPRR bridge would be reconstructed.
From its northern intersection with SL 485 to the Gregg/Upshur County Line, US 271 would be
reconstructed as a five-lane curb and gutter section with 12-foot inside lanes, 14-foot outside lanes,
and a 16-foot two-way center left turn lane. This section would include 6-foot sidewalks directly
adjacent to the back curb on both sides.
This project’s area of potential effect (APE) is defined as the proposed project footprint and the
maximum depth of impact including all easements and project specific locations. The APE will cover
a total distance of 10.4 miles and encompass approximately 349-acres of existing Right of Way
(ROW), 123.84-acres of new ROW, and 1.97-acres for temporary easements. Maximum depths of
impacts are expected to be between three and 19 feet, with a typical depth of three to five feet.
On June 17–24, 2019, an intensive archeological survey was conducted in order to inventory and
evaluate archeological resources within the footprint of the proposed project to support compliance

with the National Historic Preservation Act, as amended and the Antiquities Code of Texas. The field
work was carried out under Texas Antiquities Permit 8948 by Brittany S. McClain (Project
Archeologist), Katherine Seikel (Principal Investigator), Bo Nelson, Emory Worrell, and Danielle Blut
of AmaTerra Environmental.
Intensive survey was conducted on all parcels for which right-of-entry (ROE) was given (approximately
248.52-acres). Many properties for which access was denied or for which ROE had yet to be granted
were visually examined from adjacent properties or the current ROW (comprising approximately
100.48-acres). Overall, much of the APE has been heavily impacted by the construction of US 271
and SL 485 and the formation of steep embankments, hilltops, artificially levelled surfaces,
residential and commercial developments, and the installation of various utility infrastructure. As
such, these disturbances have greatly impacted the potential for intact archeological deposits
throughout the APE.
In all, 238 shovel tests and three backhoe trenches were excavated within the APE. Thirteen of the
238 shovel tests contained cultural material consisting of prehistoric and historic archeological
material. Three archeological sites were recorded: 41SM495, a historic artifact scatter; 41GG132, a
multi component site; and 41GG133, a buried prehistoric lithic scatter. In addition to the three newly
identified sites, one Isolated Find (IF-1) was recorded. Sites 41SM495 and 41GG133 are
recommended as not eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or as a
State Antiquities Landmark (SAL). The historic component of 41GG132 is recommended as not
eligible to the NRHP or as a SAL, but the prehistoric component may be eligible. No previously
recorded sites were located within the APE.

Sites 41SM495, 41GG133 and IF-1 do not contain significant, intact archeological deposits within
the APE. The prehistoric component of 41GG132 has potential to contain significant intact deposits,
but the historic component has been impacted by construction and the demolition of structures. No
further work is recommended to complete Section 106 and ACT requirements within the surveyed
portion of the APE, except at 41GG132, which may warrant testing. No artifacts were collected as
part of this project. All field notes and documentation will be curated at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas.

Introduction
This project was conducted by AmaTerra Environmental on behalf of the Texas Department of
Transportation Tyler District (TxDOT). The purpose of the intensive archeological survey
supplemented with backhoe scraping/trenching was to identify any cultural resources within the
project footprint for the proposed improvements to US Highway (US) 271, a rural principal arterial,
and State Loop (SL) 485 in Gregg and Smith Counties, Texas. The project is located northeast of Tyler
in Gladewater, Texas.

Proposed Facility
The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) is proposing improvements to US Highway (US) 271,
between Farm-to-Market (FM) 16 and State Loop (SL) 485 on the south side, and between SL 485
and the Gregg/Upshur County Line at the north end (Figures 1 and 2). The US 271 improvements
include widening and reconstruction SL 485 around Gladewater, TX that connects two segments of
US 271. This project is located within Gregg and Smith Counties, Texas (0165-02-061, 0165-03-036,
016-03-037, 3290-02-008, 3290-02-009, and 0248-06-017) The project length is approximately
10.4 miles long.
Within the project limits, existing US 271 has two 12-foot lanes with 8-foot shoulders and continues
as such to SH 135. At SH 135, US 271 transitions to a four-lane undivided highway with 12-foot lanes
and 10-foot shoulders and continues to the intersection with SL 485. A 1,187.5-foot bridge is located
within this southern section and includes four 14-foot lanes and 3-foot raised shoulders. Beginning
at the southern intersection with US 271, SL 485 continues with two 12-foot lanes and 8-foot
shoulders around the city of Gladewater. Located in this central section is a 145-foot bridge with 12foot lanes and 8-foot shoulders. This bridge crosses over the Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR). Starting
at SL 485’s intersection with US 80 and continuing north, SL 485 transitions to an undivided four

lane section with 12-foot lanes and 4-foot shoulders. At its northern intersection with SL 485, US 271
continues north as a two-lane section with 12-foot lanes, no existing shoulders and a 14-foot center
left turn median. This northern section continues as such until the Gregg/Upshur county line.
The proposed improvements to US 271 and SL 485 would add lanes with inside and outside
shoulders, left turn lanes, a curb-and-gutter section, multi-use paths and sidewalks. Between FM 16
and SH 135, US 271 would be reconstructed as a four-lane divided section with a 76-foot depressed
median, two 12-foot lanes in both directions with 10-foot outside shoulders and four-foot inside
shoulders. From SH 135 to the southern intersection with SL 485, US 271 would be reconstructed
as a five-lane undivided section comprised of two 12-foot travel lanes in both directions, one 16-foot
two-way center left turn lane, and 10-foot outside shoulders. Due to its current condition, the 1,187.5foot bridge in this section would also be reconstructed. Between US 271 and the UPRR bridge, SL
485 would be widened and reconstructed as a five-lane undivided section with two 12-foot travel
lanes in both directions, one 16-foot two-way center left turn lane, and 10-foot shoulders. Between
the UPRR bridge and US 80, SL 485 would become a five-lane curb and gutter section with 12-foot
inside lanes, 14-foot outside lanes, and a 16-foot two-way center left turn lane. North of US 80 to US
271, SL 485 would be reconstructed as a five-lane undivided section with two 12-foot travel lanes in
both directions, a 16-foot center left turn lane, and 10-foot outside shoulders. Additionally, a 12-foot
multiuse path would be constructed just outside the clear zone of SL 485 and the UPRR bridge would
be reconstructed. From its northern intersection with SL 485 to the Gregg/Upshur County Line, US
271 would be reconstructed as a five-lane curb and gutter section with 12-foot inside lanes, 14-foot
outside lanes, and a 16-foot two-way center left turn lane. This section would include six-foot
sidewalks directly adjacent to the back curb on both sides.
The project is being funded with federal transportation dollars provided by the U.S. Federal Highways
Administration (FHWA) and will take place on Right-of-Way (ROW) owned or to be acquired by TxDOT.
Therefore, Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (Section 106) and the Antiquities
Code of Texas (ACT) apply.
Area of Potential Effects (APE):
The Area of Potential Effects (APE) for the archeological resources is defined as the footprint of the
proposed project the maximum depth of impact including all easements and projects specific
locations. Thus, the APE for archeological resources will cover a total distance of 10.4 miles and
encompasses approximately 349 acres of existing Right of Way (ROW), 123.53 acres of new ROW,
and 1.97 acres for temporary easements. The maximum depths of impact would be between three
and 19 feet, with a typical depth of three to five feet.
The project’s horizontal area of potential effects (APE) for archeological resources corresponds with

- Horizontal limits: US 271 and SL 485 from FM 16 to the Upshur County Line

- Typical width of any existing ROW (if variable, provide upper and lower limits): 130–-215
feet

- Typical width of entire ROW, including existing and proposed new ROW (if variable, provide
upper and lower limits): 198–-370 feet

- Typical depth of impacts: three to five feet
- Maximum depth of impacts: 19 feet


No Survey Area:

There were portions of the APE that were unable to be surveyed due to denied/pending Right of
Entry (ROE), inundated areas, or disturbed areas containing parking lots or asphalt lots associated
with commercial or residential properties. A total of 100.48 acres were visually inspected from
the roadway, as shovel testing could not occur due to denied or pending ROE properties. In
addition, two small parcels north and south of US 271 west of the Sabine River were inaccessible
due to inundation.


Access Denied Area:

Most of the APE was accessible during the time of survey, however some parcels were not
accessible due to pending and/or denied ROE and are indicated on the Results Map (Appendix A).
 Survey Area:
The survey area encompasses approximately 349 total acres, comprised of 223.19 acres of existing
ROW, 123.53 acres of proposed new ROW, and 1.97 acres of temporary easements.
Parcel Number(s): N/A
Project Area Ownership: Public and private ownership. All numbered parcels are privately owned (see
attached schematics) except parcels 234, 239, 243, 253, 256, 258, 263, 279, 283 and 330, which
are owned by the State of Texas, Gregg County, the City of Gladewater, and the Gladewater County
Line ISD, a public entity. TxDOT owns the existing ROW.

Project Setting


Natural Setting
Topography: The project area falls within the South-Central Plains ecoregion (Omernik and
Griffith 2009). Locally known as the Piney Woods, this ecoregion is dominated by low rolling
hills punctuated by incised drainages and vegetated predominantly by pine forests of long leaf
and loblolly interspersed with hardwood species such as pine, white oak, black walnut,
mockernut hickory, and birch. The APE crosses one major waterway, which occurs when US
271 crosses the Sabine River southeast of Gladewater, Texas. Elevation varies from 180 to
750 feet above mean sea level.
Geology: Queen City Sands (Eqc), Alluvium (Qal), and Terrace (Qt) deposits (Figure 3). The
alluvium and terrace deposits are Quaternary in age and Queen City Sand is Tertiary in age.
Soils: The APE is defined by two soil types, Kirvin-Cuthbert-Bowie and Mollville, Latch-Bienville
soils, which consist of sands and sandy loams (USDA-NRCS 2019). (Figure 4). These soils are

derived from clayey fluviomarine deposits, clayey residuum, loamy marine deposits, loamy
alluvium, and sandy alluvium. The tertiary uplands are formed by Eocene sediments, with minor
Paleocene and Cretaceous sediments and are mostly well drained. Floodplains and low terrace areas
of the APE are defined by Holocene alluvial floodplains. These areas are either poorly drained are very
poorly drained and loamy (Omernik and Griffith 2013).

Potential Archeological Liability Map: N/A
Vegetation: Vegetation within the project area consists of various short to tall grasses within
the existing ROW, with small to medium hardwoods, secondary growth, greenbrier, dew
berries, and scrub brushes within wooded areas within the new ROW.
Estimated Ground Surface Visibility: 20–30%


Human Environment:



Historic Land Use: Euro-American settlement in the area began in the late 1820s. Both
farming and the lumber industries initially drove the regional economy. In 1873, the Texas
and Pacific Railway Company founded the city of Gladewater at the Sabine River. When it was
announced that Gladewater would be the only mail stop, residents from other small
communities moved closer to Gladewater, creating a small economic center. Despite drawing
from surrounding communities, the region remained rural with a population of 259 in 1900
(Perry 2010). Oil became an important economic driving force beginning in 1931 when the
first oil well was drilled. The regional population grew rapidly during this time with Gladewater
growing to 8,000 residents. Following the initial boom, oil industry influence slowly added
while lumbering and agriculture again became the region’s main economic staples (Gregg
County Historical Commission 2009; Perry 2010).
The project area consisted of cultivated agricultural lands, timber forests, and oil fields for
much of its history. Highway maps from 1939 depict residential development in the APE that
was impacted during US 271’s construction (Figures 5a and 5b). Topographic maps from
1974 show that US 271 occupied much of the APE with only scattered residential
development along the highway (Figures 6a, 6b, and 6c). Currently, the property flanking the
project area is residential in nature, with the SL 485 loop passing through the outskirts of
urban development.



Current Land Use: Currently, parcels within the APE are primarily roadway or used for utility
easements. Isolated residences and small businesses dot the area around US 271 within the
APE. Most of the new ROW along US 271 south of SL 485 appears to be undeveloped and
forested. Areas around SL 485 that make up the northern portion of the project area primarily
consist of isolated residences and small to medium businesses. Existing ROW within this area
are primarily roadways or utility easements, with new ROW consisting of residential or
commercial lots or sparse vegetation. Disturbances within the APE include artificially raised,
graded and levelled surfaces, paving, drainage ditches and culverts, and buried utilities and
utility poles.

Previous Investigations and Known Archeological Sites: The Texas Archeological Sites Atlas shows
that six previous surveys, two historic markers, two cemeteries, and six archeological sites are
located within one kilometer of the APE (Figure 7). Of the six previously conducted surveys (Table 1),
three overlap with the APE and were conducted by USACE in 1981, and by SWCA in 2002 and Cojeen
Archaeological Services in 2006 on behalf of TxDOT. These surveys did not document any
archeological sites which overlap with the project footprint. Although these three surveys overlap
small sections of the APE, less than 75 percent of the project area has been previously surveyed.

Of the six archeological sites recorded within a kilometer of the APE, none overlap with the
project area or have the potential to extend into the project area. These sites are summarized
in Table 2 below. These six prehistoric sites were largely documented along stream and river
terraces around the project area where alluvial deposits have developed. No other obvious
patterning in site locations is apparent since few sites have been identified, partly due to the
sparse distribution of previous surveys in the area.

Two cemeteries are located within a kilometer of the APE: the Pinkston Cemetery and
Rosedale Cemetery. Based on the mapped boundaries of the cemeteries, neither cemetery
overlaps with the APE. Pinkston Cemetery is an African American cemetery that was
established in 1877 and its known boundary is within 150 feet of the APE. Rosedale Cemetery
was established in 1856 and is within 10–50 feet of the APE. Rosedale Cemetery is still in
use and the last known burial in the Pinkston Cemetery took place in 1985.



The historic markers located within a kilometer of the APE are associated with the cemeteries.
The Rosedale cemetery marker (#9993) was placed in 1978. The Pinkston Cemetery was
designated as a Historic Texas Cemetery in 2010 and a Historic Marker (#17350) was placed
alongside US 271 in 2012.



Evaluation of Project Setting:
The APE consists of paved roadways and driveways of variable widths, modified/built up
shoulders, lawns, and patches of woods. Much of the project APE has already been altered
or heavily modified by roadway construction, maintenance and utilities installation, with
the addition of some drainage culverts and bridges. A few scattered residences and
structures, mostly located outside the existing and proposed new ROW, are adjacent to
the project footprint. The APE is flanked by highly developed, commercial areas in locations
along the northern terminus. These various activities and improvements have impacted
the landscape throughout the APE (Figures 8 and 9). Overall disturbances within the
majority of the APE were extensive with the potential to contain intact archeological
resources and historic sites within the new and existing ROW rated as low to poor, with
moderate to high potential for intact buried deposits along the Sabine River due to deep
alluvial terrace deposits.

Survey Methods


Surveyors: Brittany McClain (PA), Bo Nelson, Emory Worrell, Danielle Blut, and Katherine
Seikel (PI)
Description of Methods: Survey efforts involved visual inspection supplemented with the
excavation of 238 shovel tests (see Appendix B: Shovel Test Log). Shovel test spacing followed
the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) minimum standards for linear surveys of one test
every 100 meters except where roadways, drainage and culvert improvements, utilities or
flooded areas precluded shovel testing. Tests were excavated in all undisturbed areas of the
APE and were terminated upon depths of 80 centimeters below surface (cmbs), sterile clay,
or water table, whichever was encountered first. All tests were marked using a hand-held GPS
unit and logged on standardized forms that recorded profile characteristics, depth, and
contents. In areas with denied or pending ROE, surveyors conducted visual reconnaissance
and took representative photographs of these properties from the roadway. In site areas, or
areas of positive tests, shovel testing interval spacing was decreased to one every 20 meters.
Additional shovel tests were excavated at site areas to delineate boundaries and assess depth
and integrity of deposits. Investigators took photographs of the landscape and various

disturbances to sites. Artifacts from positive shovel tests were photographed and field
inventoried but not collected.


Other Methods: Trenching; archival and deed research.



Collection and Curation:



Comments on Methods: The methods used during the survey exceed the Council of Texas
Archeologist (CTA) standards, which call for one shovel test every 100 meters (16 per mile)
for linear projects. The subsurface test rate for this project equaled 1.04 shovel tests per acre.
The linear spacing equaled approximately 22.9 per mile. This exceeds the CTA’s minimum
standards for surveys if steep slopes, waterways, or areas of extreme disturbance are factored
into the surveyed areas. All subsurface tests were spaced approximately 100 meters apart,
except where conditions prevented or obviated the need for excavation of shovel tests. In
areas with potential for buried archeological deposits, shovel test spacing ranged from 20 to
50 meters apart. In site areas with buried deposits, additional shovel tests were excavated to
define site limits horizontally, as well as to characterize and assess the site’s contents and
integrity. Shovel tests were excavated to a maximum depth of 100 cmbs, where possible.

☒ NO

☐ YES If yes, specify facility:_Records at TARL_.

In areas with moderate to high potential for intact deeply buried deposits along the Sabine
River, one backhoe trench (BHT3) was placed west of the Sabine River to assess the deep
alluvial deposits within proximity to the river. Other areas adjacent to the river were unable to
be explored with backhoe trenches due to high water levels and the high level of ground
saturation. Two additional backhoe trenches (BHT1 and BHT2) were placed within the existing
ROW adjacent to the Rosedale Cemetery to identify the potential for unmarked graves outside
of the fenced cemetery boundary. An additional backhoe trench was to be placed within the
existing ROW of Pinkston Cemetery to identify the potential for unmarked graves outside of
the fenced cemetery boundary. However, the landscape was sloping and undulating, and
utility lines were present within the ROW making trenching unadvisable (Figure 10).

Survey Results


Survey Area Description: The archeological survey occurred between June 17 and June 24,
2019 and was completed using a four-person crew for survey and a two-person crew for
backhoe trenching. The project encompasses 10.4 miles of US 271 and SL 485 with
associated easements and included several areas of commercial and residential
development within and adjacent to the APE. Topography is flat to gently rolling throughout
the project area with some terraformed landscapes within the existing ROW and heavily
wooded areas within the new ROW. Most of the trees observed appeared to be less than 50
years in age and many were less than 20 years in age. Due to leaf litter, pine duff, and other
vegetation consisting of medium to tall grasses, ground surface visibility was varied between
20-30 percent throughout most of the survey areas. Most of the areas adjacent to the Sabine
River were extremely flooded or marshy at the time of fieldwork. In general, the ROW from the
edge of the road for a distance of at least 20 meters from it was disturbed from grading and
drainage cuts. Other disturbances within the ROW include steep embankments at hilltops,

artificially levelled surfaces, and various utility infrastructure. Due to past disturbances from
roadway construction, utility installations, and commercial and residential development within
and adjacent to the APE, overall potential for undisturbed intact deposits is low within the
existing ROW and moderate within the proposed new ROW.

Newly Identified Archeological Sites

41SM495


Site 41SM495 is an early twentieth century historic trash scatter and is located approximately
seven meters northeast of US 271 within the existing ROW (Figure 11). No new ROW is
proposed near 41SM495. This site is located on a flat grass strip bordered by a barbed wire
fence line to the northwest and US 271 to the southeast. Vegetation within the site consisted
of small to medium grasses between US 271 and the fence line, with secondary growth, small
to medium hardwoods, and greenbrier within the wooded area northwest of the fence line.
This site consists of two positive shovel tests containing a total of 14 subsurface glass shards
recovered between 0 to 20 cmbs. Cultural material located within BN-6 and BN-7 consists of
one aqua, one green, four brown, and five colorless vessel glass shards. According to the
USDA-NRCS Web Soil Survey (2019), soils within the site area consist of Kirvin very fine sandy
loam (1– 5 percent slopes) and Bowie fine sandy loam (1–5 percent slopes). Soils recorded
within the positive shovel tests consisted of dark yellowish-brown or yellowish-brown sandy
loam and was terminated at strong brown sterile clay at 45 cmbs. The soils contained
concentrations of sandstone gravels from 14 cmbs to maximum depth.
The site area encompasses 0.056 acre and was defined through shovel testing, the landform,
and the project boundary. There is a structure located outside of the ROW and northwest of
the site boundaries. However, the presence of the aqua bottle glass and the 1965 aerial
imagery showing no structure nearby indicate it is unlikely that the material recorded within
the site is associated with the structure outside of the existing ROW. The aqua and green
vessel glass likely dates 41SM495 to the early to mid-twentieth century. Based on the review
of historic maps and aerials, there is no clear association with any structure within or outside
the existing ROW in the early to mid-twentieth century.
This site contains shallowly buried deposits of historic glass, which has most probably been
impacted due to the construction of US 271 and the installation of utility lines and property
fences. This site lacks integrity and substantive research potential within the APE due to the
limited nature of materials recorded, lack of clear association with a structure, and evidence
of disturbance around the site area. The site is recommended not eligible within the existing
ROW for inclusion in the NRHP. No further work is recommended within the project area at
41SM495.

41GG132


Site 41GG132 is a surficial and buried multicomponent site located within existing and
proposed new ROW five meters northwest of US-271 (Figure 12). The site was not delineated
outside the APE. Most of the site is located within an open field that is bisected northeast to

Report for the Archeological Survey of US 271 and SL 485, Smith and Gregg Counties, Texas.

southwest by a barbed wire fence. The northwestern portion of the site is located within an
open grassy field, while the southeastern half of the site exhibits large areas of asphalt paving
and remnants of asphalt and/or concrete, which appears to be the remnants of a former
commercial parking lot. The southeastern portion of the site typically exhibits more
disturbance than the northwestern portion. Vegetation within the site consists of short to tall
grasses and weeds, bull nettle, dew berries, and secondary growth.
The site was delineated by eight positive shovel tests containing a total of 63 subsurface
artifacts recorded between 0 to 100 cmbs. The historic component was mainly contained
between 0 to 60 cmbs and the prehistoric between 20 and 100 cmbs. Observed cultural
material consists of both prehistoric and historic artifacts, a surface scatter of various historic
material and asphalt across the site, and a push pile of building rubble at the east end of the
site. Subsurface prehistoric cultural material was comprised of seven quartzite flakes, one
petrified wood flake, one nutshell fragment, and two unidentified faunal bone fragments
(Figures 13–15). The subsurface historic component was comprised of 42 bottle glass shards
(containing brown, colorless, melted brown, amber, green, and light green glass), one
colorless window glass shard, four mirror fragments, two ceramic tile fragments, two wire
nails, and one faunal rib bone (Figures 16-17). The scatter of artifacts on the surface was
made up of window and bottle glass of various colors, asphalt, concrete, and plastic (Figure
18). The push pile located on the east end of the site boundary may be the remnants of
building rubble from a previous structure (Figure 19).
41GG132 is within 170 meters of Carter Creek. According to the USDA-NRCS Web Soil Survey
(2019), soils within the site area consist of Sacul fine sandy loam (5–12 percent slopes) and
Kullit very fine sandy loam (1–3 percent slopes). Soils recorded within positive shovel tests
consisted of reddish-brown or yellowish-brown sandy loam and was terminated at orange-red
sterile clay between 50 and 100 cmbs or the water table at 50 cmbs. Mixed soils, gravel and
asphalt fragments were recorded between zero and 40 cmbs, indicating disturbance and
construction activities at the site. Subsurface disturbance was more marked closer to US 271.
The site area encompasses 1.32 acres and was defined through shovel testing, inundated
soil, and the boundary of the APE.
The historic component likely dates sometime between 1942 when US 271 was established
and 1957. The 1939 highway map does not depict structures in this location (see Figure 5),
while structures are present in the 1957 aerial imagery (Figure 20). Based on the 1957 aerial
imagery, the historic component of this site likely dates to the mid-twentieth century and is
located where the now defunct Wagon Wheel Club and Blue Jean Club used to be (Roy 2014).
These two buildings were windowless honky-tonks located on the ‘strip’ just across the Gregg
County line from Smith County where alcohol and country music were consumed. As of the
2019 survey, the structures are no longer standing but can be seen in the 2013 aerial
imagery. The push-pile documented at the eastern end of the site is likely comprised of a mix
of structural remnants and pavement.

According to deed research, this property is presently owned by Oxbow Investments and
consists of 482.661 acres. Oxbow acquired the property from Olan Harvey Lewis on
September 30, 2016 who had acquired it from Carter Gladewater Farms, LP on March 27,
2013 and it has since switched hands between farm management companies many times
since Mark Christopher Grayson deeded it over on December 21, 2009. Prior to this, county
records for this property were not available, so there is not clear association of the honkytonks with an individual or individuals at the time they were in operation.
This site is densely buried and contains both historic and prehistoric material. Based on the
survey, Site 41GG132 contains buried cultural material at depths ranging from 0–100 cmbs.
However, a portion of the site has likely been significantly impacted by the construction of US
271, utility installations, and the honky-tonks, while the remaining portion within the new ROW
has been impacted by land clearing and blading. These activities impacted native soils and
the integrity of the site. Due to heavy soil disturbances to at least 40 cmbs in much of the site,
the historic component of the site lacks substantive research potential and is considered not
eligible for the NRHP within the APE. Historic and prehistoric cultural materials overlap
between 20 and 60 cmbs, however, potentially intact prehistoric deposits extend to depths of
100 cmbs. The prehistoric component of 41GG132 is at least partially intact and may have
research potential within the APE.
41GG133


Site 41GG133 is a diffusely buried prehistoric site located approximately 15 meters north of
SL 485 within the existing ROW and adjacent to private commercial lot storing assorted
machinery (Figure 21). No new ROW is proposed near the site location. The site is located on
a manicured terraformed landscape bounded by a chain link fence to the north, and a
drainage culvert and SL 485 to the south. Vegetation within the site consisted of small to
medium grasses. This site contained two positive shovel tests consisting of one yellowishbrown jasper flake recovered between 20 to 40 cmbs, and one brown petrified wood flake
recovered between 40 to 50 cmbs. 41GG133 is located within 350 meters of a floodplain
associated with a tributary to the Sabine River. According to the USDA-NRCS Web Soil Survey
(2019), soils within the site area consist of Bienville loamy fine sand (0–3 percent slopes).
Soils recorded within the positive shovel tests consisted of dark yellowish-brown or pale brown
sandy loam and was terminated at strong brown sterile clay between 89 to 95 cmbs. Mixed
gravels were recorded in the shovel tests between 30 and 90 cmbs.
The site area encompasses 0.016 acre and was defined through shovel testing, the landform,
and the project boundary. The site contains sparse and diffuse deposits of cultural material
and does not contain a diversity of materials. Additionally, 41GG133 has limited integrity
within the APE due to landscape modifications associated with the drainage culvert. The site
lacks substantive research potential and it is considered not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP
within the existing ROW. No further work is recommended within the project area.

Backhoe Trench Summary (see Appendix C: Trench Log)


BHT1 measures 75 centimeters wide by 6.5 meters long, with a maximum depth of 130
centimeters and runs in a southwest to northeast direction (Figure 22). The trench was located
on the east side of SL 485, and approximately two meters north of the Rosedale Cemetery
near a small cemented culvert. The trench location was determined based on the proximity to
the cemetery boundary fence to investigate the possibility of unmarked graves outside of the
fence line. The topography is defined as a hillslope with the trench placed at the bottom of
the terraformed slope. Vegetation consisted of medium grasses and secondary growth, with
small to medium hardwoods, scrub brush, and bushes around the perimeter of the Rosedale
Cemetery fence line. The trench was separated into six different soil zones. Asphalt tar soil,
concrete chunks, brick tile fragments, and asphalt tar residue was pocketed throughout the
fifth soil zone between 90 to 120 cmbs. This indicates all prior zones were previously
disturbed due to terraforming and road construction activities for SL 485. No other unique
soil characteristics were observed, nor any artifacts recovered.



BHT2 measures 75 centimeters wide by 15.5 meters long, with a maximum depth of 120
centimeters and runs in a north to south direction (Figures 23 and 24). The trench was located
approximately two meters to the east of SL 485, north of Rosedale Cemetery adjacent to the
roadway shoulder at the top of the hillslope. The trench location was determined based on
the proximity to the cemetery boundary fence to investigate the possibility of unmarked graves
outside of the fence line. The topography is defined as a hillslope with the trench placed at
the top of the terraformed slope. Vegetation consisted of medium grasses and secondary
growth. The trench was separated into five different soil zones. Similar to BHT1, asphalt tar
inclusions were dispersed throughout all five soil zones of BHT2 indicating all previous zones
up to 120 cmbs were previously disturbed due road construction activities for SL 485. No
other unique characteristics of the soils were observed, nor any artifacts recovered. The
trench excavation was terminated at the water table and sterile clay.



BHT3 measures 75 centimeters wide by six meters long, with a maximum depth of 110
centimeters and runs in a northeast to southwest direction (Figure 25). The trench was located
approximately 20 meters north of US 271 and west of the Sabine River. The trench location
was determined based on the proximity to the Sabine River in order to investigate the potential
to contain intact deep alluvial deposits. The topography is defined as an alluvial terrace, with
vegetation consisting of small grasses within a manicured lawn. The trench was separated
into two different soil zones. An unmarked utility line was inadvertently uncovered and
subsequently avoided at approximately 80 cmbs. No other unique soil characteristics were
observed, nor any artifacts recovered. The trench excavation was terminated upon the
discovery of the unmarked utility line in the northern portion of the trench and at the water
table in the southern portion of the trench.

Archeological Materials Identified:


One Isolated Find (IF-1) consisting of a lithic flake was found in ST DB29 between 40 and 60
cmbs. IF-1 is located within 110 meters of Carter Creek on a narrow stream terrace and was
located within the existing right of way approximately 10 meters north of US 271. As this find
is in close proximity to US 271, it is likely that the area is disturbed due to road construction,
utility line installation, and blading. Therefore, this area does not contain intact deposits and
the remaining subsurface deposits have been disturbed.



APE Integrity: The majority of the APE has low integrity for archeological materials because it
has been heavily impacted by the construction of US 271 and SL 485 and the installation of
various utilities. In addition, these areas have been impacted by land clearing, grading,
culverts and drainage structures, and commercial and residential developments. As a
consequence of extensive activity along the edges of the ROW and heavy impacts from grading
and roadway construction, field crews commonly encountered underlying clays at relatively
shallow depths. However, in some areas shovel testing identified cultural deposits below
disturbed soils. Shovel testing at 41GG132 determined that there is disturbance as evidenced
by intermixing of historic and prehistoric deposits to 60 cmbs in addition to obviously
disturbed soils to 40 cmbs in some portions of the site. It is not clear how much of the
prehistoric deposits below 60 cmbs may be intact. Therefore, the historic component of
41GG132 has little to no integrity, and the prehistoric component has undetermined but
potential integrity and research potential within the ROW below 60 cmbs.

Recommendations
The archeological survey resulted in the identification of three sites (41SM495, 41GG132, and
41GG133) and one Isolated Find (IF) IF-1. No further testing is recommended at 41SM495 and
41GG133, as they are recommended not eligible for NRHP-listing within the TxDOT ROW. The historic
component of 41GG132 is considered not eligible within the TxDOT ROW, however, portions of the
prehistoric component appear to be intact below 40 cmbs and may have research potential.
Therefore, the prehistoric component of 41GG132 may warrant testing. Additionally, areas of
proposed new ROW for which ROE was denied or pending should be evaluated once access is
available.



Comments on Evaluations: At Sites 41SM495 and 41GG133 it has been determined that
there is no potential for future research within the APE. The prehistoric component of
41GG132 may warrant testing to determine NRHP eligibility.

Further Work: No further work is recommended for the surveyed portion of the APE, except at
41GG132. Areas of APE where ROE was pending or denied should be surveyed once those areas
become available, particularly in areas where new ROW is proposed which have not been
significantly impacted by development along the roadway.
Justification: All work for this survey was conducted in compliance with Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act under the guidelines presented in 36 CFR 800, and in
compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas, whose guidelines are outlined under 12 TAC 26.
