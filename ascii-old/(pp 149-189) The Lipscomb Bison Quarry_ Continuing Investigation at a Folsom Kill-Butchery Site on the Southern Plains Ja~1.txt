The Lipscomb Bison Quarry:
Continuing Investigation at a Folsom Kill-Butchery
Site on the Southern Plains
Jack L. Hofman, Lawerence C. Todd, C. Bertrand Schultz,
and William Hendy
ABSTRACT
Since the initial investigations by the Nebraska State Museum in 1939, the
Lipscomb Bison Quarry in Lipscomb County, Texas has been a key Paleoindian
site. Although repeatedly cited in discussions on Folsom lifeways, published
information on Lipscomb is limited to a brief repor t on the first excavation. Recent
study of collections and field work allow an expanded documentation of the site.
Within the 138 square meters excavated at Lipscomb, the remains of more than 50
bison and more than 40 Folsom artifacts have been collected. Significant variation
exists in the state of preservation, articulation, and fragmentation of the bone.
Distributional patterning in the chipped stone assemblage is also indicated but the
extent and degree of spatial variation is yet to be determined for either lithics or
fauna. Information on excavations in 1939, 1946, and 1988, together with recent
analysis of collections are summarized in terms of Lipscomb’s rote in the
interpretation of early Paleoindian adaptations on the Southern Plains.

INTRODUCTION
The 1930s was a dynamic and exciting period for research in Early Man in
North America (e.g., MacCurdy 1937; Wormington 1957). Following the Folsom
discovery in 1926 and its widespread acceptance by 1928, there was a flurry of
research pertaining to the association of prehistoric Americans and Pleistocene
faunas. Much of this activity was centered at the University of Nebraska State
Museum (Barbour and Schultz 1932, 1936; Schultz 1932, 1938, 1943, 1983;
Schultz and Eisley 1935, 1936).
Roberts’s (1935, 1936, 1940) detailed research at the Lindenmeier Folsom
Campsite in Colorado, however, overshadowed most other Folsom studies of the
period. Investigation of the Lipscomb site in 1939 provided relatively anticlimactic
documentation of a second key Folsom bison kill site. A preliminary report on the
investigation at Lipscomb (Schultz 1943) has provided the source for continuing
discussion and speculation concerning the nature of the site and circumstances of
this highly significant Folsom bison kill. This paper provides an up-to-date account
of the history of investigations at the site and an assessment of the place of the
Lipscomb site in Folsom period research and Paleoindian studies in general. The
Lipscomb site is in the northeastern corner of the Texas Panhandle (Figure 1).

HOT AND COLD RUNNING BISON:
PREVIOUS INTERPRETATIONS OF THE LIPSCOMB SITE
The first published documentation on the Lipscomb site appeared in the
Bulletin of the University of Nebraska State Museum (Barbour and Schultz
1941:67-68). Because this early report includes information about the history of
investigations at Lipscomb, it is included here in full, with the exception of a table
listing measurements of a bison skull from the site.

In the fall of 1938 a large deposit of bison bones was reported to the
University of Nebraska State museum by bar. Charles H. Falkenbach of the
Frick Laboratory, American Museum of Natural History. The deposit was
located on the farm of Mr. Commodore Hopper, 16 miles north of
Canadian, near Lipscomb County, Texas, on Sand Creek, a branch of Wolf
creek. A preliminary examination had been made by Mr. Falkenbach, who
arranged to exchange the prospect with the University of Nebraska for

Hofman, Todd, Schultz, and Hendy-- Lipscomb Bison Quarry

excavating privileges in certain Nebraska quarries. On May 20, 1939, the
Texas bison locality was visited by a field party consisting of Messrs.
Charles H. Falkenbach, John C. Blick and N. Z. Ward of the Frick
Laboratory, and Messrs. E. E. Brier, John Adams, Lynn Robert Wolfe, and
C. Bertrand Schultz of the University of Nebraska State Museum.
A careful examination of the bone deposit showed that the remains,
although they were very near the present surface of the ground, were well
fossilized and at one time had been deeply buried. Several terraces are well
developed along Sand Creek and the bones appear to be located in the
highest (35 to 40 feet) terrace.
A flint scraper was found in situ among the bones and it was at once
decided to make further excavations to determine the species of bison and
the type of artifact. A field party composed of Messrs. John Adams,
William Hendy, and James Crosby was sent from the University of
Nebraska to the Lipscomb Bison Quarry, as it is called in the field records.
The group arrived at the quarry on June 10 and immediately began
excavations. A grooved Folsom-type dart point was found in situ on the
first day of excavation. Work at the site continued until August 26, with
Messrs. Harry Tourelot and Robert Kubicek joining the party on July 31.
Mr. and Mrs. C. Bertrand Schultz visited the site three different times
during the season, and aided in the excavating.
A total of nine essentially complete grooved Folsom points, nine
partial Folsom points, four large scrapers or knives, and a snub-nosed
scraper were found. A number of chips of flint, including a longitudinal
channel flake from a groove of a Folsom point, gave evidence that Early
man probably camped at the site and chipped artifacts there. Charcoal and
burned bones were found at various places throughout the quarry, especially
along the borders. Some of the skeletons of the bison were almost
completely ,articulated, but the bones around the fringe of the quarry were
disartic ulated and badly broken. Most of the skulls were closely associated
with each other at the south end of the excavation.
A total of thirty-eight boxes and crates of fossil bison material was
collected from the site to add the Morrill Paleontological Collections. a
study of the specimens shows that the bison is identical with the form found
at the Folsom quarry in New Mexico, i.e., Bison antiquus taylori. The
measurements of one of the largest male skulls is given here for reference.
A complete report on the bison from the Lipscomb quarry, together with
a record of the fossil bison from other localities in America, will be
published in a forthcoming paper.
The more extensive 1943 report by Schultz included more details about the site
and excavation as well as two tables, one describing the artifacts collected from the
site and the second providing the metric description of a large bison skull. The 1943

152

report (Schultz 1943:244-248) is in part redundant to the 1941 paper, but contains
substantial information published for the first time and is reproduced here in part.
The bones appeared to be larger than typical Bison bison, and since the
members of the staff of the University of Nebraska State Museum were
anxious to obtain comparative material of late Pleistocene and early recent
bison, excavating privileges were obtained from the Frick Laboratory in
exchange for rights in certain Nebraska fossil quarries.
The members of the field party making this preliminary investigation
found a "snub-nosed" scraper ~1. XII, No.17001-39) in situ among the
bones protruding from the bank, but this type of artifact was, of course, not
diagnostic. On the slope of the hill west of the bone deposit, however, a
fragment ofa Folsom point (No. 17000-39) had been previously found on
the surface, so it was considered a possibility that more artifacts would be
encountered when the bones were excavated .... Dr. and Mrs. Loren C.
Eiseley of the University of Kansas, Dr. and Mrs. E. H. Sellards of the
University of Texas, and Mr. Floyd Struder of Amarillo, Texas were
visitors at the site during the excavations.
The location of the bones had been known for at least twenty years by
persons in the neighborhood, and some excavating had been done by local
citizens. There was no visible excavation showing previous work but
undoubtedly the numerous bones and bone fragments in the talus below
the outcrop were the result of digging rather that erosion.
Excavations were begun on the west side of the deposit in the area
where the bones were the thickest. A trench was started but it soon became
evident that this method of removal would have to be altered because there
were a number of articulated skeletons in the quarry and the bones lay close
together. The quarry was marked off in five-foot squares and the outlines
of the various important specimens were plotted on a large-scale sketch
map. A topographic map was also made showing the region along Sand
Creek in the vicinity of the site. Several terraces are well developed along
this drainage, and the bones appear to be located in the highest (35 to 45
feet), or oldest, of these.
Most of the overburden covering the bones had been removed as a
result of erosion by wind and water, only six or seven inches remaining at
the northeast side of the deposit and thirty inches at the southeast edge. On
the west side, where the bones were exposed along the bank, the depth of
the deposit varied from seven to fifteen inches. The bones nearest the
surface were in a poor state of preservation because of the penetration of
grass roots.
The quarry extended for a distance of about one hundred feet from

north to south and twenty feet from east to west. At the north end of the
quarry the fossils were badly broken and scattered, but those to the south
were mainly complete and in most cases articulated. Fourteen articulated
skeletons, including skulls, were located in a section which was only

Hofman, Todd, Schultz, and Hendy m Lipscomb Bison Quarry

twelve feet wide and twenty feet long. The skeletons were headed chiefly
in an easterly or southerly direction and overlapped one another,
considerably. Nine additional skulls were unearthed in the area immediately
surrounding the skeletons. The skeletal remains of some individuals were
entire, even including the caudal vertebrae. From a paleontological
standpoint, the Lipscomb Bison Quarry is an important site because of the
completeness and preservation of the bones, including skulls. At the
original Folsom quarry in New Mexico many of the bones were crushed
and incomplete, and accurate measurements were difficult to obtain.
Twenty-two artifacts and a number of flint chips, all in situ, were
found scattered throughout the quarry. Four additional specimens were
recovered from the quarry talus. The artifacts compare favorably with
those of the Folsom complex which Dr. Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr., reported
from the Lindenmeier site in Colorado, but show much more variation in
form than do those the original Folsom locality. Some of the most
diagnostic specimens from the Texas site are figured in P1. XII, and all of
the archaeological material recovered is listed in Table 1. One of the chips
(17013-39) which was found in situ in the quarry resembles the "gravers"
found by Roberts, but no evidence of worked bone was observed. The
artifacts are made of a light to dark gray flint and flinty chalcedony which
is occasionally streaked with red.
Charcoal and ashes were associated with the bones in many parts of
the quarry, especially in the southern part, where there was evidence of
individual fires. Along the north and east sides of the deposit the bones
were scattered and many of them had been split and cut by the ancient
hunters. The artifacts as well as the bones often were incrusted with lime
on the lower side and the flint itself was found to be deeply patinated. Some
large pieces of limestone, foreign to the immediate area, were uncovered
among the bones in the northern part of the quarry. The stones may have
been employed in the breaking and shattering of the bones.
The chips of flint found in the quarry would suggest that tools were
resharpened at the site, but the presence of the complete channel flake 0~1.
XII, No. 17070-39) ofa Folsom point would not necessarily mean that the
projectile points were made there. This flake had probably been used as a
knife by the hunters.
It is difficult to postulate why so many articulated animals had been
left in the concentration which was mentioned in a previous paragraph.
Perhaps there was more food than necessary, and after the butchering of
a sufficient supply had been completed, only the pelts were taken from the
remaining animals. Burial must have taken place shortly afterward, or the
carnivores would have dismembered the skeletons.
Thirty-eight boxes and crates of fossil bison material were collected
from the Lipscomb site to add to the Morrill Paleontological Collections.
Although the specimens show a great amount of variation, they compare

favorably with the collection of Bison antiquus taylori from the Folsom
Quarry in New Mexico (see Table 2). There is a certain amount of
overlapping in the size and form of the smallest Lipscomb individuals and
modem Bison bison. The bison material from Lipscomb is also being
compared with the extensive collection from the Scottsbluff Bison Quarry
in western Nebraska, where Yuma points were collected in 1932, in order
to determine whether the bison associated with the two artifact complexes
differ from each other.
Several important aspects of Schultz’s (1943) report are summarized as

There was a distinct concentration of articulated and partially articulated
bison in a small area of the site.
There were at least 23 bison represented by 14 partially articulated skeletons
and 9 additional skulls. A concentration of skulls was noted in the southern
area (Barbour and Schultz 1941).
The skeletons were oriented primarily toward the east and south.
There was evidence of fire and probable hearth areas located primarily on
the margins of the dense bone bed. Other evidence of processing activity on
the margins of the bone bed were split bones and limestone cobbles found
in the northern part of the excavation.
Variation in the condition of the bone was correlated with depth below the
surface and was apparently due to differential weathering and the action of
grass roots. Bone at the north end of the quarry was relatively shallow and

poorly preserved, whereas bone at the south end was more deeply buried and
better preserved.
6. The articulated skeletons were seen as evidence for very limited postoccupation carnivore disturbance to the bonebed. Also, encrusted lime or
carbonates on the lower surface of bones and tools indicated that they had
not been greatly disturbed.
7. The limited evidence for butchering of the many articulated units were
interpreted to reflect overkill or a surplus of usable bison products.
8. The central area of the bone bed was interpreted to have been buried soon
after the kill, judging by its intactness, lack of carnivore evidence, and
degree of preservation.

The significance of the site as a paleontological resource is noted by
comparison with the less well preserved remains from the Folsom site.
The number of projectile points, flakes, and tools in conjunction with the
evidence of hearths suggested processing and perhaps camping by Folsom
hunters adjacent to the kill.

Most interpretations and discussions of Lipscomb that have appeared to date
are based on Schultz’s 1943 paper, but there has been considerable variation in the
interpretations offered for the Lipscomb kill as witnessed by the following quotations. These are ordered chronologically and are only a selection intended to show
the perspectives of various researchers on the Lipscomb site.
Sauer (1944:543) has suggested that fire drive was used to trap the bison at
Lipscomb an interpretation noted subsequently by Wedel (1961:76). Sauer’s
comments follow.
A herd of lumbering animals, feeding on the plains, could be cut off
by a line of fire before they gained the shelter of a valley. Or, panicstricken, they could be driven toward a valley in such a fashion that they
piled up in the ravines at its edge of tumbled over the rimrock that hems
many plains valleys. In either case the fire hunters had only to dispatch
maimed and injured animals. That such kills sometimes far exceed the
needs of the hunters is indicated the the piling up in one spot of numerous
complete skeletons. The conditions at the Lipscomb Bison Quarry are
especially illustrative.

Sellards (1952:58-59), who visited the Lipscomb site during excavations in
1939, provides an extended discussion of the site.
In the Lipscomb County, Texas, Schultz (1943) excavated a site
which evidently represents a bison kill by Folsom man. The bones at this
place were distributed over an area about 100 by 20 feet. In the part of the
quarry where the bones were most concentrated Schultz reports fourteen
articulated skeletons, including skulls, in an area 12 by 20 feet. "The
skeletons were headed chiefly in an easterly or southerly direction and
overlapped one another considerably. The skeletons of some individuals
were entire, including even the caudal vertebrae" (Schultz, 1943, p. 246).
Twenty-two artifacts were found by Schultz at this locality in 1939.
Of these were eighteen were projectilepoints, and of the eighteen projectile
points (whole or broken) fifteen were found situ in the bone bed and three
in the talus removed in excavating. The remaining artifacts include
scrapers, flake knife, and one channel flake. The projectile points are of the
Folsom culture.
The description of the skeletons as heading in one direction, one
overlapping the other, suggests that the animals, during a storm, entered
one of many depressions of the plains where the snow was of such depth
as to compel them to stop, some to freeze, and others to be killed by man.

158

Texas Archeological Society

Certain it is that the skeletons were in a natural depression and many of the
animals, if not all, entered the depressions at the same time as a herd or part
of a herd.
An incident of modern bison caught by a snowstorm and falling an
easy victim to hunters is relatedby Garreston (1938, p. 88) from Shoemaker
as follows: "The buffalo were all huddled together, up to their necks in
snow, in a great hollow space known as the sink in the heart of the White
Mountains, near the present town of Weiket, Union County, Pennsylvania.
The animals were numb from cold and hunger, and were unable to move,
so deep were they crusted in the great drift. The hunters started at once to
slaughter the helpless bison. Some were shot, but most of them were killed
by cutting their throats with long bear knives. Many of the tongues were
saved, and that was about all, as the snow was too deep to attempt skinning
them."
Hornaday (1899, p. 384) records an incident in which bison in the
vicinity of Hay and Peace Rivers near Great Slave Lake, Canada, caught
in an exceptionally heavy snowstorm of 1821, froze to death by the
thousands, their skeletons having persisted on the plains until at least as
late as 1871.
S uhm, Kfieger, and Jelks (1954:65) described Libscomb somewhat inaccurately
as follows:
Pleistocene lake bed site 11 miles southwest of Lipscomb, Texas.
Extinct bison the principle fauna. Eighteen points of Folsom type, two
scrapers, a flake knife, and a channel flake in association with the bison.
Excavated in 1939 by C. Bertrand Schultz for Nebraska State Museum.
Wormington (1957:40), provided this paragraph concerning theLipscomb site.

Another interesting site, which was reported by C. Bertrand Schultz
(1943), is the Lipscomb Bison Quarry, which lies eleven miles southwest
of Lipscomb, Texas. Here were found fourteen articulated bison skeletons
and nine skulls which, for the most part are like those found at the Folsom
Quarry. Eighteen artifacts were found scattered among the bones, and four
were found in the quarry talus. They closely resembled those obtained at
the Lindenmeier Site. They included Folsom points, scrapers, channel
flakes, and utilized flakes that probably served as knives.
Wedel (1961:62), in his widely used source book, summarized the t-mdings at
Lipscomb.

At the Lipscomb bison quarry, sixteen miles north of Canadian,
Texas, eighteen projectile points, several side scrapers, an end scraper, two
flake knives, and a number of chips were found in association with a mass
of fossil bison skeletons. Charcoal and ashes were noted among the bones,
as well as indications of hearths; and some of the bones had been split and

Hofman, Todd, Schultz, and Hendy ~ Lipscomb Bison Quarry

159

cut. Many of the skeletons are reported to have been in articulation,
including fourteen with skulls in an area measuring but twelve by twenty
feet. Of these, it was said that the "skeletons were headed chiefly in an
easterly or southerly direction and overlapped on another considerably."
It has been suggested that the animals may have been a herd which, caught
perhaps in a snow storm, wandered into a depression, stopped, and
perished by the hand of man.

In his 1968 dissertation, Henry Irwin commented on the Lipscomb site as a kill
having no campsite debris and stated that
Lubbock and Blackwater are kill sites by pond edges, while the type
site and Lipscomb are kill sites of the kind where the bison were undoubtedly
captured by drive and surround techniques. Bonfire shelter represents an
excellent instance of a drive over the cliff, and in [is] the earliest evidence
we have for such a kill technique.
Wheat (1972:160) provided this discussion of the Lipscomb situation.
There is one Folsom period site which indicates the use of a mass kill
technique, although the published evidence is not detailed enough to
reconstruct more than the broad outlines of the kill. This is the Lipscomb
Bison Quarry site (Schultz 1943:244-248). Here the evidence suggests
that a pond or gully in or near S and Creek had been used as a trap for a small
herd of bison driven or stampeded over a low hill to the west. The bone bed
extended about 30m. north to south, and 7m. east to west, and varied from
18 to 38 cm. in thickness. At the south end of the quarry there were 14
articulated skeletons, including skulls, in an area only 3.6 m. wide and 7.0
m. long. All were oriented east or south, and overlapped each other to a
considerable extent. Some of these skeletons were entire, but others had
been partly butchered. In the area immediately surrounding the skeletons
were 9 additional skulls. At the north end of the quarry most of the
skeletons had been more heavily butchered and the bones were badly
broken and scattered. Folsom points and other artifacts were scattered.
Folsom points and other artifacts were scattered throughout the quarry,
and charcoal and ashes were associated with the bones in several parts of
the bone bed, especially in the southern part where separate fires were
indicated. The fact that many of the bison were not completely butchered
suggests the the hunting party was not large, or that only meat, skins, and
so forth, for immediate need were taken.
Frison (1974:12) suggests that "the Lipscomb site (Schultz 1943) could have
been a trap or drive over bank of a stream. Unfortunately the actual number of
animals is not given, but complete specimens were found."
Frison (1978:114, 247) also mentions Lipscomb in his discussion of Folsom
culture and the evolution of bison hunting on the plains.

The Lipscomb site on the Southern Plains (Schultz 1943) with 14
articulated or partially articulated bison skeletons may be a communal kill.
Analysis of the Lipscomb dentitions should yield information on the
nature of the kill (whether a single event or several events over a period of
time) and possibly also some information of seasonality ....The evidence
suggests that systematic, communal hunting began early. Folsom groups
were aware of bison jumping methods if the data from Bonfire Shelter have
been properly interpreted. Trapping methods appear almost certain to have
been around considering the age structure of the Folsom site bison and the
number of animals at the Lipscomb Bison Quarry.
Johnson (1978:99) suggests that Lipscomb represented a single-event bison
drive.
These localities, such as Plainview, Lipscomb, and Rex Rodgers, are
multiple-animal bison drives into narrow draws or stream channels.., the
bison were all killed in single drives, and none of these areas was used
again for that purpose.
Nicholson (1982) has argued that Paleoindian bison hunting was a small group
affair with no convincing evidence for organized communal bison hunts until
Archaic times. He incorporates Lipscomb into the discussion (1982:7).

Several sites such as the Lipscomb Bison Quarry (Schultz 1943) and
Plainview (Sellards 1947) indicate that the bison were driven over low
hills or shallow escarpments which, in themselves, would not have
constituted a trap or a serious fall. A further indication of seasonality is the
presence [sic] at Plainview of several near full term fetal skeletons
(Sellards 1947). If these low areas were filled with snow, they would have
constituted an effective trap. Many of the areas where Paleoindian kills are
recorded are locations where, due to the growth of tall reeds or brush such
as willows, concealment would be offered to waiting hunters, and snow
could accumulate in deep drifts so that a stampeded herd would flounder
and be severely restricted in mobility. Hunters, wearing rawhide or
basketry snowshoes, would be able to approach and dispatch the animals
under these circumstances.
Evidence for something as ephemeral as a snowdrift trap is going to
be extremely difficult to recover or to demonstrate in a convincing manner.
If it can be assumed that gestation and seasonality of birth are identical in
extinct and extant species of bison, then the precise aging of thanatic
assemblages may indicate whether these "open spaces" kills occurred at a
time when the digging of holes in frozen ground would have been a
problem, and when deeply drifted snow could have been present. The same
sort of precision in aging, coupled with exact provenience, might indicate,
through vertical and/or horizontal stratigraphy, whether kills were
catastrophic single events or accretional deposits built up over several

months. It may be that some distinctive pattern associated with processing,
such as the restriction of elements associated butchering artifacts to
pathways which had been trampled in the snow, could be identified as
winter bison procurement complex, utilizing snow entrapment, developed
on the High Plains, the technology may have been lost with the reduction
in both precipitation and the number of bison available during the
Altithermal, a period of supposed desiccation of the environment.
Johnson (1987:157) mentions Lipscomb in what has become a fairly common
perspective on Folsom bison hunting as a small-scale version of the larger kills of
later times.
By Folsom times the scaled-down version of large-scale bison kills
was beginning to occur. Twenty-three animals each were recorded at
Folsom (Wormington, 1957) and Lipscomb (Schultz, 1943), and a larger
number from Bonfire Shelter (Dibble and Lorrain, 1968). The kill at Lake
Theo (Harrison and Smith, 1975; Harrison and Killen, 1978) appears to be
another smaller version of the large-scale kill. Such kills continued into
post-Folsom times, exemplified by Jurgens (Wheat, 1979) with 35 bison.
In their recent general discussion of Folsom bison hunting, Bonnichsen and
others (1987:413) use Lipscomb as a possible example of an arroyo trap.
Folsom bison-hunting techniques include cliff drives such as at
Bonfire, arroyo knickpoint traps at Folsom and possibly Lipscomb, and
especially simple ambush around springs and playa lakes such as at the
Linger and Zapata sites. Compared to later Piano kill sites, Folsom kill
sites have usually less than 10 animals. These small and under-utilized
bison kills may reflect an opportunistic hunting strategy rather than the
larger well-organized communal bison kills seen in the ensuing Paleoindian
periods on the Plains.

Gunnerson (1987:15) recently summarized the Lipscomb site.
The Lipscomb Bison Quarry, located in the northeast comer of the
Texas Panhandle, is interesting and potentially important, but excavation
there has never been fully reported. In a preliminary article Schultz (1943)
lists 26 stone artifacts, several of which are illustrated. Included are 18
projectile points or fragments (of the 10 illustrated, all are fluted and some
conform to the classic Folsom shape), one end scraper, 4 side scrapers, 2
possible flake knives, and a channel flake. Eleven chips were also
recovered. Bison antiquus remains included 14 articulated skeletons with
the bones well fossilized; detailed measurements are given on one of the
largest male skulls. Charcoal and ash from the site gave evidence of fire.

Summary of Previous Interpretations:
What Was Lipscomb Really Like?
There have been a variety of interpretations offered for the Lipscomb site as to
nature of the kill, number of bison present (cf. Agenbroad 1978; Hester 1967:180;
Wendorf and Hester 1962), hunting methods used, and topography and geomorphology of the site area. The Lipscomb site has been interpreted as a fire drive, a
snow drift trap, a surround, and a possible arroyo trap. The land surface has been
reported as a pond, gully, Pleistocene lake bed, shallow escarpment, and natural
depression. The question or possibility of multiple kills has been noted, and the site
has been said to lack campsite evidence, to have campsite evidence, and to represent
a simple kill and processing site.
These diverse interpretations highlight the need for further investigation of the
site’s geochronology, seasonality studies, paleoecology, bone bed analysis, and
functional-technological lithic analysis. Detailed reconsideration of the 1939
investigations and further field work are needed in order to clarify misunderstandings and erroneous interpretations, and to develop an accurate picture of the site’s
history. S tudy of the seasonality and taphonomic aspects of the bone bed have been
discussed (Toddetal. 1988). Aspectsofthegeology, geomorphic history, soils, and
paleoecology must await further fieldwork.
1939 EXCAVATIONS AT LIPSCOMB

The most extensive field work at the Lipscomb site was in 1939, and by far,
most of materials recovered from the site came from the 1939 field season. As noted,
this work extended from June 10 through August 26, with a field crew consisting
of three to five. Schultz’s (1943) report has provided some interpretation of the 1939
work in terms of geological setting, taphonomic circumstances, nature of the bone
bed, description of the artifacts, and comparison with other localities. These aspects
of the analysis will be considered in more detail below, and deserve continued
research. The 1939 field notes prepared by William Hendy (1939) are very
insightful, of high quality, and provide an important body of information about the
Lipscomb site. Aspects of these notes that pertain to the field methods, historical
information about the site, the nature of the bone bed, condition of the bone, and the
associated artifacts are reproduced here. Catalog numbers assigned each day are
also listed in the field notes. For many days, the last number listed was the first to
be used on the following day.
Saturday. June 10. 1939.---The bones are exposed along a bank for
about 50 feet and are about 6" to 1 foot beneath the surface. The bank is
about 3’ high and is about 20 feet above an intermittent stream to the west.
We screened some of the wash at the base of the bank without any results.
We started to follow some of the exposed bones back and found those near
the surface quite soft and rotten though hard and in good condition where
exposed. John Adams found a Folsom point in place and partially exposed.

Hofman, Todd, Schultz, and Hendy ~ Lipscomb Bison Quarry

The bone in which the point was found was pretty well disintegrated but
was probably a scapula.
Sunday. June 11. 1939.--William Hendy uncovered another Folsom
point in place near the upper end of radius (?) and about 15" from point
found yesterday. John Adams found a point at the base of the bank
associated with some fragmentary bones. The upper part of a small point
was also screened out of the material removed.
The procedure followed was to skim offthe sod with a shovel and then
work back from the exposed ends of the bones with hand tools.
Bones collected mostly lower extremities of limbs 16,100-39 to
16,110-39.
Monday, J0ne 12, 1939.---Rain soaked into the working face of
quarry making the bones very fragile and hard to work out. Bones collected
mostly limb bones. 16,111-39 to 16,120-39.
Tuesday. June 13. 1939. Bones are so thrown together that it is
difficult to work individual bones out. Many of them are scattered. Are
beginning to uncover some vertebra. One small flint chip was collected.
Bones collected included a number of ribs and limb bones, 16,121-39 to
16,124-39.
Wednesday. June 14. 1939.--Work progresses rather slowly due to
the bones being so jumbled together. Many of the limb bones are in an
articulated condition, also a number of vertebra but usually a number of
miscellaneous bones are scattered in with these. Bones collected 16,125-39
to 16, 135-39.
Thursday. June 15, 1939.--Work still progresses rather slowly due to
jumbled mass of bones which necessitates slow work with hand tools.
Uncovered several ramii but all in poor condition... Bones collected
16,136-39 to 16,138-39.
Friday. June 16, 1939.--Uncovered a fair scapula and a number of leg
bones which usually have poor ends. Quite a few of the bones are those of
immature animals. Bones collected 16,139-39 to 16,150-39.
Saturday. June 17.1939.--Spent the morning in sieving and working
wash at base of ledge with hand tools but only found one possible flint chip.
Continued work on bone pile in afternoon. Bones collected 16,151-39 to
16,156-39.
Sunday. June 18. 1939.--Met H. Tourtelot who had a tent, sack of
plaster, and a sure seal for us.
Monday. June 19.1939.--Uncovered a horn core today but did not get
it worked out enough to tell much about its size or condition of skull to
which it is attached. Only seems to be one horn on the skull and probably
several skulls in close proximity to one another. Bones collected 16,15739 to 16,174-39.
Tuesday. June 20. 1939.--Bones collected 16,175-39 to 16,182-39.

163

164

Texas Archeological Society
Thursday, J0ne 22, 1939.--One skull minus one horn was removed,
also an immature skull and another large skull was uncovered. A number
of vertebra were removed.
John Adams found the top of a small point while digging out the skull.
It was evidently associated with as ulna found under the skull. William
Hendy uncovered a small point at the lower end of a humerus.
Bones collected 16,183-39 to 16,197-39.
Friday. June 23. 1939.---The tip of a point was found by John Adams
in the wash at the base of the bank to the north of the main area.
SundaY, Jone 25.1939.--The large skull does not seem to have been
hurt by the rains and as far as it is uncovered is complete. A Mr. Baldwin
who once owned the land on which the quarry is located visited the site and
said he first noted the bones exposed here about 30 years ago. Commodore
Hooper said he first noted the bones at this exposure about 1911 or 1912.
Bones collected 16,197-39 to 16,207-39.
M0ndav, June 26, 1939. Are still working at the same spot and the
bones are still in abundance. So far we have not found a scapula, ulna,
pelvis and some of the vertebra complete, but with the amount of material
apparently at the site we should be able to get a complete skeleton. Bones
collected 16,207-39 to 16,230-39.
Tuesday, June 27,1939.--William Hendy uncovered a point in place
between the ribs of a young specimen. It was some distance back of the
scapula which was articulated with the rest of the front leg bones. The point
was protruding from between the ribs toward the outside on the fight side.
It had apparently entered from the left side and had worked through to the
fight side during burial.
A small skull partly disintegrated was removed from over the large
skull which is complete. The left horn is partly gone but the fight horn is
complete. Bones collected 16,230-39 to 16,240-39.
Wednesday, June 28, 1939.--Bones collected 16,240-39 to 16,24339.
Thursday, June 29. 1939.--Completed the removal of the large skull
today. It was articulated with a number of vertebra which were in good
condition except for the spines. A large radius and ulna were articulated
with this skull and vertebras but the scapula was in poor condition. A
number of ribs in good condition are showing up. John Adams found
several flint chippings in some fibs. Bones collected 16,243-39 to 16,25039.
Friday, June 30,1939.--Worked out a number of vertebra articulated
with the large skull and also a number of ribs. Bones collected 16,400-39
to 16,410, 16, 250-39 to 16, 265-39.
Saturday. July 1.1939. bAr. Schultz suggested that we sieve some of
the wash along the base of the cliff in preparation for putting a trench

Hofman, Todd, Schultz, and Hendy ~ Lipscomb Bison Quarry
around the site to determine its limits. A knife was found in the wash at the
south end. Bones collected 16,410-39 to 16, 431-39.
Sunday, July 2, 1939. --C. B. Schultz began the digging of a trench
at the south end of the site and work was also started at the northern limit
of the bones which were found to be scattered and only to extend about 18"
back from the face of the bank. Some articulation of metapodials and
phalanges was found. A few pieces of flint were found in the wash while
sieving.
Monday. July 3. 1939.--WiUiam Hendy found a point.., associated
apparently with a radius. The radius was broken off near the lower end and
[the] point was in a matrix lying on two phalanges as if it may have been
associated with them.
The afternoon was spent in wrapping all bones, cleaning up all
fragmentary bones and fencing in the site. Bones collected 16,265-39 to
16,290-39.
Saturday, July 8, 1939.--Continued working on the trenches to
outline the extent of the site today. Found a knife in the trench.
Monday, July 10,1939.---Continued work on the trenches this morning.
Worked on a trench through the center of the site to intersect the trench
outlining the area. Bones collected 16,290-39 to 16,300-39.
TuesdaY, July 11, 1939. Finished the trench around the outside of
the area. Found bones in only a few scattered places and at approximately
the level of the floor making them deeper than in [the] main part of the
quarry. Made two extensions of the trench at the southeast corner of the
site. Found a few fragments of bone 6’ south of the corner and some teeth
11’ east but nothing beyond these extremities.
Wednesday, July 12, 1939. Made casts and collected the bones
exposed. Bones collected 16,301-39 to 16,331-39.
Thursday. July 13, 1939.--Continued work on the trench through the
center of the quarry. Began the removal of a second articulated skeleton
which runs off in a southerly direction. Bones collected 16,331-39 to
16,341-39.
Friday, July 14, 1939.--Completed the trench through the center of
the quarry. The bones thin out as the outer trench is reached and the present
picture seems to indicate there was a pile of carcasses here. Bones collected
16,341-39 to 16,350-39.
Saturday, July 15, 1939.---Laid off the area in 5’ squares in order to be
able to plot the position of important finds. James Crosbie found a knife
associated with a radius and ulna. Bones collected 16,350-39 to 16,364-39.
Monday, July 17, 1939.--Uncovered a square (5 x 5) north of the
central trench and began working down from the top. Two skulls in poor
condition and one with one hom and upper part of skull gone due to
proximity to the surface werepartially uncovered. Most of the bones in this
area are articulated. Bones collected 16,364-39 to 16,379-39.

165

166

Texas Archeological Society
T0~sday. July 18. !939.--Began the uncovering of a square in the
south east comer. The bones are scattered here and are from 1’ to 2’ below
the surface. The bones are better preserved in this area much of which
seems to be overlain with a calcareous soil, the bones being at the edge of
this or in a sandy zone below.
Wednesday. July 19. 1939.--Continued work in same area in which
we were working yesterday. Uncovered a skull in fair condition. Removed
two small but complete scapulas and a number of scattered metapodials
and phalanges, all in good condition. Bones collected 16,379-39 to 16400-39.
Thursday. July 20. 1939---Completed casting and removal of the
skull today. One ramus was broken off and lay underneath the skull. A
complete scapula lay underneath and to the back of the skull.
Did some work in the area worked the t-n’st of the week. Uncovered a
mandible lying across the nasals. This skull is apparently twisted and
turned so that it lies top up on its own vertebra. The atlas and axis are visible
at the back. Removed several articulated bones, one piece including the
entire front leg from humerus on.
Friday. July 21, 1939.--Mr. Schultz and Dr. Eiseley accompanied by
their wives arrived about 10:00. A few minutes later Dr. Sellards, State
Geologist of Texas and wife arrived to inspect the work which apparently
has his approval, bar. Schultz and Dr. Eiseley did some digging in the
afternoon. Removed a skull in poor condition and several leg bones. Mr.
Schultz said he did not believe it worth while to save unassociated and
badly broken bones. Bones collected 16,451-39 to 16,476-39.
$~urday. July 22. 1939.--Removed an unassociated ramus and
scapula from the southwest comer both in good condition. Bones collected,
16,476-39 to 16,487-39.
M0ndav. July 24. 1939.--Worked around skull which appeared to be
lying on its own vertebra but find that there is no skull attached to the
vertebra underneath it and the skull is attached to vertebra at its side some
of the spines of which lie across the skull. The vertebra underneath have
two scapulas and front leg bones articulated with them. Bones collected,
16,487-39 to 16, 494-39.
Tuesday. July 25. 1939.--Had a visit this morning from Judge Mead
of Miami, Texas and W. D. Mateer, late of Oklahoma but now with the
Bureau of Economic Geology of Texas. Both men seemed to be interested
in doing some excavating at our site. Continued work on northeast part of
quarry. Bones collected, 16,494-39 to 16,510-39.
Wednesday, July 26, 1939.--Worked out several more vertebra
belonging to the large skeleton and uncovered part of the sacrum and
pelvis. Continued work on the two skeletons on the north side of our site
(skeletons A & B) but they are so closely associated that it is difficult to
block our parts to be cast.

Hofman, Todd, Schultz, and Hendy ~ Lipscomb Bison Quarry

Thursday, July 27, 1939.---Cast the skull and the vertebra and
scapulas belonging to another skeleton which lay underneath it. The entire
front leg bones are also there. Removed the top toward the northeast and
found a skull with the mandible and maxillary left. Toward the edge the
bones are almost at the surface and scattered. The[re] were a number of
calcareous rocks associated with the bones here. Found two rounded
pieces of quartz associated with the bones in this area. Bones collected,
16,510-39 to 16,539-39.
Friday, July 28. 1939.--Found a mandible and maxillary partly
overlaying the vertebra of skeleton C. to the cervical vertebra of this
skeleton we found a scapula and front leg attached. Underneath was
another complete leg but no scapula was found. Toward the edge of the site
just west of here there seems to be a concentration of limb bones and
lumbar vertebra. Bones collected, 16,431-39 to 16,438-39 and 16,539-39
to 16,550-39.
Saturday, July 29, 1939. ---Continued work this morning on skeleton
C and completed its removal. Bones collected, 16,550-39 to 16,560-39.
Sunday. July 30. 1939.---C. B. Schultz arrived about 7:00 and we
spent an hour and a half at the site receiving directions for the continuation
of the work. Tourtelot and Kubicek are to join us tomorrow.
Monday. July 31. 1939. Uncovered 3 more skulls and parts of
several others in the same area. The skeletons seem to be completely
articulated and do not appear to have been butchered though they are much
twisted in the position they occupy.
Harry Tourtelot and Robert Kubicek arrived about 10:30 P.M. John
Adams found a broken point on the bank of [the] eastern extension of the
trench on the southern edge of the quarry. It was partly in the matrix
characteristic of this area and was probably thrown out with some of the
loose dirt worked away from the bones. Bones collected, 16,660-39 to
16,671-39.
Tuesday. Auuust 1. 1939.--Dug a trench to the north along the edge
of the bone bed. Found no bones more than 3’ from the bank so that there
is not a very great concentration of bones to the north of the main area.
Uncovered more in the afternoon and began to work out some blocks.
Wednesday. Auuust 2. 1939. --Jack Crosbie, Harry Tourtelot and
William Hendy made a map of the quarry this morning. In the afternoon
they began a general map of the area while John Adams and Robert
Kubicek continued work in the quarry. Bones collected, 16,674-39 to
16,678-39.
Thursday. August 3. 1939.--Work was continued on the map and at
the quarry by the parties mentioned yesterday. The party at the quarry is
working on several blocks of bones. Bones collected, 16,678-39 to 16,68739.

167

Texas Archeological Society

Friday, August 4.193%--Work was continued in the afternoon at the
quarry and on the map. One large block was removed at the quarry. Bones
collected, 16,687-39 to 16,692-39.
Saturday, August 4. 1939.--The mapping party finished work this
morning. All of the personnel worked at the quarry this afternoon. Are
starting to block out several large areas of bones to be case.
Bones collected, 16,692-39 to 16,698-39.
Sunday, A0~ust 6. 1939.--Jack Crosbie and William Hendy made a
traverse to measure the elevations of the various terraces.
Monday, August 7. 193%--Robert Kubicek found a piece of a point
associated with the bones. All work is being concentrated on the northern
part of the area in working out several large blocks of bones.
The bones near the edge at the north are only a few inches below the
surface, though they become deeper and the thickness of the layer
increases rapidly to the south. There have been a number of rather large
calcareous rocks (2" to 6" in largest dimension) found associated with the
bones around the periphery of this area. A definite slope to the south and
west is noticeable which in the floor which contains many calcareous
concentrations (lumps crumble when dug out).
Tuesday, Ao~ust 8. 1939.--Continued work on several large blocks.
In order to get them out it is necessary to remove some of the bones which
interlace the area together but by careful work it is possible to save most
of the bones. Bones collected, 16,698-39 to 16,706-39.
Wednesday, August 9. 1939.---Continued work on the blocks being
taken out and got most of them blocked out and ready to be cast. Began
work on the south side of the quarry. Uncovered several scapulas and ramii
about 18" below the surface. The matrix is more sandy and the[y] rest on
the sandy floor. Quite a number of invertebrates are recovered in this area
(Gastropods). Bones collected 16,706-39 to 16,710-39.
Thursday, August 10,193~.--Continued work on the south part of the
quarry. The bones lie about 15" to 18" below the surface and are in a more
sandy matrix. They are more scattered and are in better condition. Two
skulls were uncovered about in the center along the south trench.
Friday, August 11.1939.--Harry Tourtelot found the base of a point
at the back of a skull and on turning the skull over found a point in the
matrix of the maxillary, no mandible being attached. William Hendy found
a knife or a flake from the center ofapoint near a scapula and slightly below
the floor on which the bones rest. Another skull upside down also found
close to the one carrying the point. Bones collected, 16,710-39 to 16,72439.
Saturday. Auzust 12, 1939.--Continued work on the south side. In
one area six scapulas were found, a few front limb bones and a few
scattered vertebra. Bones collected, 16,724-39 to 16,736-39.

Hofman, Todd, Schultz, and Hendy m Lipscomb Bison Quarry

Monday. August 14. 1939.--Continued work on the south side.
Along the bank on the west the bones are only a few inches below the
surface and are in poor condition, deeper several columns of vertebra were
found. Bones collected, 16,736-39 to 16,741-39.
Tue~clav. August 15.1939.~Mr. F. V. S tuder paid us a visit today and
seemed pleased with the finds we were making. He was very much
interested in the artifacts. Work was continued on the south side of the
quarry. Bones collected, 16,741-39 to 16,571-39.
Wednesday. August 16. 1939.---Removed two skulls and uncovered
a third one, which is upside down and in poor condition. Bones collected,
16,745-39 to 16,751-39.
Thursday. August 17.1939.--Continued work on the south side again
today. Uncovered a small skull complete with mandible. A large flint flake
was found at the front of the mandible. Bones collected, 16,751-39 to
16,759-39.
Friday. August 18. 1939.---Along the bank on the west side of the
quarry a skeleton complete, except that due to the nearness to the surface
the skull and parts of the spines on the vertebra and the ribs are in poor
condition, has been uncovered. Bones collected, 16.759-39 to 16,767-39.
Saturday. August 19. 1939.--Removed the skull found Thursday.
Several ramii were near itbut it had a complete mandible. Bones collected,
16,560-39 to 16,568-39.
Sunday. August 20. 1939.--Worked at the quarry all day casting all
possible material in preparation for removing remaining bones the first of
this coming week.
Monday. August 21. 1939.--Uncovered the remaining bones in the
main part of the quarry and began to work out several blocks. Found two
skulls in the area and the back of another including the horn cores. John
Adams found a point associated with a radius and ulna. Bones collected,
16,568-39 to 16,578-39.
Tuesday, August 22, 1939.--Worked on the north end of the quarry
and took out most of [the] dirt along the edge with a shovel. The bones were
very scattered with a concentration of bones being found at intervals and
with few or no bones between the spots where they are concentrated.
William Hendy found the tip of a point and John Adams found a knife.
Upon discovery of these artifacts more pains were taken is removing the
matrix but no more artifacts were found. Most of the bones in this area were
limb bones, but a few vertebra, ribs, scapulas and teeth were also found.
These bones were from 4" to 8" below the surface and the grass roots had
broken up all but smaller heavier bones. We worked back to the trench
previously excavated along the eastern side of this and removed all
material between it and the from the bank.
Commodore Hopper informed me that the land had been sold to Mr.

Summary of the 1939 Lipscomb Excavations

Several key aspects of Hendy’s 1939 excavation field notes should be emphasized:
1. The field methodology was quite good and was geared to recovery and
preservation of the bison fauna; care also was taken to locate and record artifacts in
situ (Table 1). Screening (seiving) of the fill was apparently standard practice, but
it is uncertain whether the fill that was removed from around the dense bone
concentrations was always screened. The five-square grid map with plotted bones
has not been found
.2. Clusters of skulls are noted in the excavation. Some of these were still
articulated, but others may reflect butchering/processing activities or even intentional postprocessing arrangement. Patterned placement of crania was evident at the
Vore site (Reher and Frison 1980), and patterned distribution of elements is noted
for other Paleoindian kill sites (e. g., Wheat 1972). An illustration of the Folsom site
bone bed (Wormington 1957:Figure 3) shows two overturned skulls adjacent to one
another. A unique Folsom feature at the Lake Theo site located near the Caprock
escarpment 120 km south of Lipscomb, contained a small circular arrangement of
selected elements, consisting of a thoracic vertebra, mandibles, tibiae, and a femur
all placed in an upright position in a small pit (Harrison and Killen 1978). It has been
suggested that a bison skull was placed atop this feature as an offering.
3. Patterned occurrence of projectile points with forelimb elements is indicated
by the in situ finds of Folsom points mentioned in the field notes (Table 2, Table 3).
All eight projectile points found in situ were associated with the front half of the
bison, from the ribs just behind the scapula to the crania. This information provides
some limited clues to the actual tactics used in bison hunting by Folsom hunters.
4. Differenttypes ofsedimentunderlie thebone bed; sediments on the south end
of the deposit contain sand and gastropods. The presence of gastropods in the bone

bed level and a sandy substrate was also noted in the southern area during the 1988
testing.
5. The land surface on which the bone bed occurs, which was apparently the
surface at the time of the kill, slopes to the southwest. This lower southwest part is
also where the sandy substrate occurs and where the gastropod fauna is common.
If the animals were moving to the south and east, as suggested by the orientation of
the articulated units in the bone bed, they would have been moving downgrade, but
perhaps also up the east bank of a stream, pond, or gully located to the west of the
kill spot.
6. Different kinds of materials, such as the large rocks and charcoal
concentrations, and uneven frequencies of elements in different areas of the
excavation may reflect butchering and processing activities at the margins of the
bone bed. Present evidence suggests possible processing and camp activities at the
northern end of the bone mass and, possibly, similar activities in the less well
documented areas to the east and south.
7. Nothing in the field notes (or in the present topography) suggests any natural
features that might have contained, impeded, or demobilized the bison. This is
similar to many other Paleoindian sites that lack evidence for natural or man-made
features that might have aided in procurement (Frison and Todd 1987; Stanford
1978; Emory and Stanford 1982). It had been interpreted that a common Folsom
hunting tactic was the simple stalking and ambush of small herds 0~mory and
Stanford 1982; Bonnichsen et al. 1987:413).
1946 EXCAVATIONS AT LIPSCOMB
Information for the 1946 field work comes primarily from small maps that were
made by W. D. Frankforter from field notes and are now in the University of
Nebraska State Museum. These maps have been redrafted ~igures 2 and 3) and

172

indicate the extent of excavations at Lipscomb in 1946 which were less intensive
than during 1939. This is also corroborated by participants in the work (Lloyd G.
Tanner, personal communication). Only 44 catalog numbers were assigned to
materials from the 1946 work, whereas more than 1000 numbers had been assigned
to materials collected during the 1939 season. The most important part of the 1946
work was documentation of the relationship of the excavation units of the two
seasons and of the specific provenience of test pits and artifacts found during the
1946 work (Figure 2).
According to Hendy’s (1939) notes, the excavated area was outlined with a
narrow trench, and two exploratory extensions of this trench were extended from the
southeast comer of the excavation (Figure 2). It is uncertain whether the entire area
within the 1939 perimeter trenches was excavated. In 1946, one flake was recovered
from an irregular excavation made in the northwest part of the 1939 excavation area
(Figure 3). The obtuse angle at the northeast comer of the 1939 excavation was
encountered during the 1988 excavation, and the area directly inside the perimeter
trench did not appear to have been previously excavated. It is likely that the
excavation in 1939 extended only to the perimeter trenches in the locations where
bone was still being encountered.
No artifacts were mapped in the 1946 excavation units that were east and south
of the 1939 area. Three Folsom points---one complete point and two base fragments-were collected in 1946 from the west slope of the terrace; two of these were
found on the surface; the third was from screening of the slope sediment. A fourth
Folsom point base was found in 1946 on the high terrace about 400 meters southeast
of the site. A flake tool, flake, smooth stone, and flat rock were mapped in the actual
excavation. Also, 20 pieces of bone that were considered worked were plotted in the
1946 excavation area. These pieces have not been restudied, and, considering the
difficulty in distinguishing natural from purposeful human modification of bone
pieces, the presence of bone tools at Lipscomb remains to be verified. The flat rock
and cobble from the 1946 excavation are concordant with the 1939 records, which
indicate that several limestone rocks were found in the northern part of the bone bed
where the bones were more scattered and fractured. As initially suggested by
Schultz (1943), this may have been a processing area adjacent to the main area of
the kill.
1988 EXCAVATIONS AT LIPSCOMB
Goals of the 1986 survey and 1988 testing at Lipscomb were fairly simple, but
further investigation is needed before they will be attained. The goals are as follows:
1. Relocate the site and assess its situation with regard to potential disturbances.
2. Relocate the earlier excavation units.
3. Prepare a map of the site vicinity.
4. Determine whether intact buried deposits remain at the site.
5. Assess the potential for dating the site.
6. Evaluate the topographic and geologic setting.

7. Evaluate the site’s long-term research potential.
8. Provide a better understanding of the geologic context from which the
Lipscomb bison fauna was collected.
Upon relocating the Lipscomb site, it was leamed that the land-owners were
very much aware of the site, had controlled access to it, and had not allowed any
indiscriminate digging there. Some erosion of the western edge of the site has
occurred during the past decades, so the shallowness of the deposit leaves the site
highly susceptible to future disturbance.
A depressed area about 6 meters (20 feet) long (north to south) and 3 to 3.5
meters (10-12 feet) wide (east to west) was noted on the edge of the terrace where
many small pieces of bison bone had eroded out. Testing at the edge and outside of
this depressed area was done to evaluate whether it represented part of the
University of Nebraska State Museum excavation (Figure 4). Based on the current
information from testing in February and August of 1988, this depressed area does
correlate well with the location, size, and shape of the primary 1939 excavation
(Figure 5). The distinctive obtuse angle of the northeast comer of the 1939
excavation (perimeter trench) was encountered during the 1988 test work (Figure
6); this angle provides a key reference point for correlating the current testing efforts
with the previous excavation. Unfortunately, the 1946 excavation plan was not
found until after the 1988 test work was completed, more testing will be required
in order to gain full confidence in the precise location of the various earlier
excavation units with regard to the 1988 tests (Table 4) and the modem edge of the
terrace.
The results of the 1988 testing were significant in several ways. Because the
primary concern of the original University of Nebraska State Museum excavations
was the collection of a comparative sample of late Pleistocene to early Holocene
bison, the portions of the site which did not yield well preserved bone or which had
only a limited amount of bone were not fully investigated. These marginal areas are
the ones most likely to contain evidence of bison processing or camping activities.
The finding of artifacts north of the main bone bed during the 1946 excavation, the
presence ofapoint in the eastern extension trench excavated in 1939, and the finding
in 1988 of two flakes at the north edge of the 1939 excavation area and a flake tool
10 meters further to the north (Figure 7) all suggest that there remains much to be
learned about the type and positioning of activities surrounding the main bone bed
at Lipscomb.
In 1988, evidence of intact bone bed on the fringes of the 1939(?) excavation
unit was also found The bone is in a relatively poor but variable state of preservation,
and the nature and extent of the remaining bone bed is unknown. Testing at the south
end revealed in place a poorly preserved and overturned bison skull, a sacrum, a
metacarpal, and a tibia, as well as many small bone fragments (Figures 8 and 9). In
the matrix surrounding these elements were scattered flecks of charcoal and
gastropods were common. The extremely small samples of charcoal have been
submitted for radiocarbon dating to the University of Arizona and to Beta Analytic.
The feasibility of dating the samples has not yet been determined. However, if the

sample should prove too small to date, it should be possible to collect a more
substantial charcoal sample from the site.
S tudy of the stratigraphy and geomorphology of the Lipscomb site remains one
of the key issues, for this information should aid in deciphering the nature of the land
surface on which the kill occurred. Paleoecological study, through analyses of
snails, phytoliths, and perhaps pollen, will also enhance understanding of the site
area at the time of the kill.

Research on the Lipscomb bison bone collection, reported in more detail
elsewhere (Hillerud 1970; Todd et al. 1988), indicates that a minimum of 54 bison
are represented in the kill at Lipscomb. This figure is based on the number of left
astraguli, and is significantly higher than the MNI of 23, which is usually cited for
the site. This larger size of the kill herd has implications for better understanding of
Folsom period bison hunting, which usually has been interpreted as a small group
activity involving few animals (e.g., Hofman and Ingbar 1988:Table 3), although

the possibility of a communal hunt at Lipscomb was noted by Frison (1978). The
large number of bison at Lipscomb makes any interpretation of an ambush kill
unlikely, unless there was some form of containment such as a snow drift, brush
corral, of arroyo. Considering the season, a snow drift is unlikely but not
impossible, and there is not yet any documented evidence for a natural or man-made
trap or enclosure.
Study of dental eruption and wear documents the time of year of the kill as late
summer or early fall (Todd et al. 1988). This, of course, could represent the end of
or just after the rutting season. This season has implications for the physical
condition and composition of the bison herd and the weather conditions which are
likely to have existed at the time of the kill. The mature male bison tend to be in their
poorest condition at this time of year, just following the rut, and the daily
temperature at the time of the kill and during subsequent processing may have been
to high for the beneficial effects of natural refrigeration (Frison 1982). In early fall,

neither the fat content nor the quality of the bone marrow of the bison skeletons
would have been prime. This, together with the probable warm weather and limited
immediate need for fats by the hunters, may account in part for the limited
butchering and processing of the Lipscomb bison.

DISCUSSION OF THE LIPSCOMB QUARRY
AND OTHER FOLSOM SITES
The true significance of the Lipscomb Quarry becomes apparent upon
comparison with other Folsom sites in the region, including Folsom, Lubbock Lake,
Lake Theo, Adair-Steadman, Shifting Sands, and Blackwater Draw. Without
exception, the bison fauna from Lipscomb is the premier Folsom bison assemblage
in existence. Through Hillerud’ s (1970) research and continuing study, the Lipscomb
bison can serve as a comparative baseline for investigation of terminal Pleistocene
bison in the Southern Plains. Eruption and wear study of the Lipscomb bison
dentition has allowed an accurate assessment of the season of the kill, which appears
to have been late summer or early fall, and which indicates either a single event or
several very closely spaced events (Todd et el. 1988). The importance of Paleoindian
kills during this time of the year is discussed elsewhere. Taphonomic analysis
documents the limited amount of carnivore attrition and probable rapid burial of the
carcasses after the kill, thus supporting Schultz’s original interpretation of the
situation. Lipscomb was originally excavated primarily as a paleontological site,
rather than an archeological one, and this resulted in extreme care being taken with
the bison remains both in the field and during subsequent curation.
The lithic assemblage from Lipscomb is more extensive than those from the
Folsom site and Lubbock Lake and is enhanced with better contextual information

Hofman, Todd, Schultz, and Hen@ m Lipscomb Bison Quarry

than exists for from Lubbock, Folsom, and most of the Folsom material from
Blackwater Draw. Lipscomb provides a highly useful complement to campsites
such as Frank’s site (Stanford and Broilo 1981), also referred to as the Mitchell
locality (Bouldurian et al. 1987), Shifting Sands (Amick et al. 1988), and Elida
(Hester 1962). It is also complementary to the study of woP~shop/camp and tool
production sites such as Adair-Steadman (TunneU 1977).
Documentation of the resharpening of projectile points at Lipscomb indicated
that the Edwards chert pieces are more commonly reworked than are the Alibates.
It has been argued (Hofman 1988a) that this reflects prior usage and retooling of the
Edwards chert projectiles before they were used at Lipscomb, whereas no such
evidence exists for the Alibates artifacts. On this basis it is plausible, considering
the sources for these materials, to postulate a south to north (or southeast to
northwest, then northeast) movement of this particular Folsom band prior to the kill
atLipscomb. If it is assumed that the season of the kill is late summer or slightly later,
the authors suggest that the group moved northward during the summer from central
Texas (where the Edwards chert was acquired). Movement may have been along the
eastern Caprock of the Llano Estacado, which would have provided easy hunting
access to the short-grassed, playa dotted High Plains to the west and to the more
protected well watered dissected rolling plains to the east. Sites such as Lake Theo,
just east of the Caprock, and Blackwater Draw and Lubbock Lake on the Llano
Estacado, attest to the use of these different Plains environments by Edwards cherttoting Folsom groups. The possibility of seasonal variation in the most intensive use
of these distinct environments has been addressed (Hofman 1988b), and it is likely
that the well-watered, more protected and wooded settings in the lower dissected
plains would have been preferred in times of severe weather. The authors therefore
postulate a pattern of movement for the Lipscomb group and perhaps other Folsom
bands in the region, as follows:
1.

2.

3.

4.

The Lipscomb group spent the winter in the dissected Low Plains (of
Central or North Central Texas?) where there were both adequate fuel and
good lithic resources.
The Lipscomb group spent the spring and summer on the High Plains and
along the Caprock Escarpment in pursuit of bison and in general foraging.
They brought Edwards chert assemblages into the region during this part
of the cycle, and they reworked used assemblages at sources such as the
Tecovas Alibates outcrops.
In the Fall groups were oriented toward making substantial kills to garner
the products of a prime bison herd in preparation for winter. By late fall,
they probably moved toward the low dissected Plains, with their more
adequate fuel supply and protected settings.
By midwinter, the groups, which might be significantly further south or
east than they were during the late summer and fall, would be investing
time in retooling equipment, as long as there was adequate food on reserve
or to be foraged for in the vicinity.

184

This scenario, though oversimplified, is provided as a target for evaluation and
discussion. The authors do not assume that Folsom people occupied stringently
defined territories, within which they followed an entrenched seasonal subsistence
cycle (Kelly and Todd 1988). It is evident, however, that Folsom groups who
camped and hunted in western Oklahoma, western Texas, and eastem New Mexico
relied heavily upon cherts from the Cretaceous Edwards Formation of Central
Texas (Broilo 1974; Hester 1972; Hofman 1986; Stanford and Broilo 1981).
Considering the substantial elevation and the topographic and vegetational variation in the Southern Plains between the Llano Estacado and the dissected Prairie
Plains to the east, it is reasonable to predict that these regions may have been used
with differing seasonal intensity. An important factor to consider, however, is that
the extremes of seasonal temperatures may have been notably less severe during late
Pleistocene times than they are today (Graham and Lundelius 1984).
In summation, evidence from Lipscomb indicates that a Folsom group made a
kill of more than 50 bison in late summer or early fall. The group used implements
made of both Edwards chert and Alibates agatized dolomite; there is evidence
evidence of reworking before final breakage or loss of the Edwards, but not of the
Alibates pieces. This suggests that the Edwards pieces had been in the tool kits
longer and had been curated after use in previous kill-butchery episodes. The
relation of the Lipscomb site to the geographic locations of Edwards and Alibates
source areas supports the interpretation that the group had moved from the south or
southeast before the time of the Lipscomb kill. Collection of Alibates dolomite may
have involved movement of the whole group, or it may have been accomplished by
a special task group. Where the group went from the Lipscomb site is unknown, but
the incomplete butchering of the bison at Lipscomb may indicate that 1) the group
had all the resources it needed or could use from the kill, 2) the group was too small
to fully utilize the bison killed before they spoiled, or 3) they elected to follow and
monitor another herd or the remainder of the Lipscomb herd, rather than lose touch
with this key resource. The time of the kill, during or soon after the rutting season,
has implications for the herd composition and condition of the animals. The limited
evidence for marrow extraction and the apparent incomplete butchering may reflect
gourmet butchering (Todd 1983, 1987), or simply warm weather conditions. It
seems lighly likely that there were associated processing, hide working, and camp
area(s). The nature of the kill and topographic setting in which it happened remains
to be determined.
