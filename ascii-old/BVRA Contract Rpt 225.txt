ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey for the proposed National Center for Therapeutics
Manufacturing on a 130-acre tract in central Brazos County, Texas was conducted by
Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) on November 19 and 20, 2009 under
antiquities permit 5456. The project is on property owned by The Texas A&M University
System. The area was investigated by a surface inspection as well as shovel testing
and probing. The area recorded as site 41BZ38 was visited, and found to have been
destroyed. No previously unrecorded prehistoric or historic sites were identified and
recorded, and no artifacts were collected. It is recommended that The Texas A&M
University System be allowed to proceed with construction of the National Center for
Therapeutics Manufacturing as planned. Copies of the final report are on file at the
Texas Historical Commission, the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL),
The Texas A&M University System, the Texas State Library, Aviles Engineering
Corporation, and BVRA.

INTRODUCTION
BVRA was retained by Aviles Engineering Corporation as a sub-consultant to
The Texas A&M University System to conduct a Phase I cultural resources survey at
the 130-acre site of the proposed National Center for Therapeutics Manufacturing on
land owned by The Texas A&M University System in central Brazos County (Figure 1).
Based on an examination of the project area as depicted on the topographic map, the
soil survey for Brazos County, and a conversation with other archaeologists, the project
area was considered to be a low probability area in terms of containing significant
prehistoric and/or historic sites. Prehistoric site 41BZ38 was recorded by the author in
1978, and it is at the very edge of the project area on its southeastern boundary. Since
the construction of this project will be financed by a municipality of the State of Texas,
an Antiquities Permit was required, and permit 5456 was assigned to this project. The
field survey was accomplished on November 19 and 20, 2009. The project area is
depicted on United States Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5â topographical quadrangle
Wellborn (3096-421), dated 1961 and photo-revised in 1980 (Figure 2).

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area is located within the West Gulf Coastal Plain section of the
Coastal Plain physiographic province as defined by Fenneman (1938:100-120). This
physiographic section is subdivided according to the age of the geological formations
(Gulf series) that roughly parallel the Texas coastline. The area is hilly and situated
within the East Texas timber belt. Gould (1969) describes it as an area characterized
by gently rolling to hilly topography with light colored soils that are acidic sandy loams or
sands. The climate is subhumid to humid, and the weather is considered to be
predominately warm. Annual rainfall for Brazos County is 39.21 inches. A January
minimum temperature of 42 degrees Fahrenheit and a July maximum temperature of 95
degrees Fahrenheit combine to produce a growing season of 274 days (Kingston and
Harris 1983:180). The altitude above mean sea level in the county varies from 200-400
feet. In the project area, the altitude is 320 to 340 feet above mean sea level. According
to the soil survey for Brazos County (Chervenka 2003:Sheet 32), the soils in the project
area consist of Booneville fine sandy loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes (BoA) Booneville fine
sandy loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes (BoB), and Zack very fine sandy loam, 1 to 5 percent
slopes (ZaB). These are upland soils located on footslopes. The native vegetation in
this area consisted of open savannah with mid and tall grasses. Today, the area is
covered with mixed hardwoods and a thick understory (Figure 3). A typical profile of
both soils consists of a surface layer of sandy loam from 0 to 17 inches. The subsoil is
clay from 17 to 36 and 41 inches. These soils are somewhat poorly drained, and the
depth to the water table is 0.5 to 1.0 foot. Runoff is slow, and soil permeability is very
slow.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
According to the Office of the State Archeologist, Brazos County is located in the
Southeastern Region of Texas (Figure 3). A check of the records at TARL revealed that
significant prehistoric and historic sites have been recorded in the county. Prehistoric
sites in this area are typically found on sandy ridges and uplands in close proximity to
dependable sources of water such as creeks and rivers. Artifacts associated with the
Archaic and Paleo-Indian periods have been found at a few sites, but no sites that date
solely to these periods are known in the county, and Late Prehistoric sites are the most
numerous. One site (41BZ132) containing an Archaic projectile point and burned rock
was found during a previous survey of the Traditions Golf Course (Moore 2000), but
additional work is needed to determine if this is a pure Archaic site. Prehistoric burials
have been found at sites in adjacent counties such as 41BU16 and 41BU17 in Burleson
County and eroding from the Brazos River, but no burials have been reported at sites in
Brazos County. Site 41BZ38 was recorded by the author in 1978 based on two
possible cores and two flakes on a sandy hill adjacent to Farm-to-Market Road 60
(Raymond Stoltzer Parkway). The three largest surveys in the county were for the
Tradition Golf and Country Club at University Ranch by BVRA (Moore 2000), the Bush
Presidential Library Center by Archaeology Consultants (Moore and Warren 1993), and
the White Creek Archaeological Project by the Archaeological Research Laboratory at
Texas A&M University (Thoms 1993). Historic sites are not always tied to water and can
consist of standing structures dating to the 19th and 20th centuries and isolated features
associated with farming and ranching such as cisterns, wells, and outbuildings. In
certain areas historic bridges and cemeteries are present. One major historic site is the
Richard Carter house site (41BZ74) that dates to the 19th century (Carlson 1983, 1987).
This site represents the earliest historic settlement in the county at circa 1831.Two early
log structures have been reported in the county. One is an early cabin (41BZ93), and
the other is a log crib or cabin (41BZ89) that has been destroyed. The town of Boonville
(41BZ91), including Boonville Cemetery, was the first county seat of Brazos County and
was established in 1841 (Webb 1952:188).

METHODS
Prior to the commencement of the field survey, the Texas Historic Sites Atlas and
the site files at TARL were checked for previously recorded sites and surveys in the
project area and vicinity. Archaeologists William A. Dickens and Bradley F. Bowman
were consulted, and they shared their knowledge of sites in the area. The project area
was examined on November 19 and 20, 2009, and investigated through a surface
inspection and shovel testing. The area was covered by following transects spaced
approximately 300 feet apart and a thorough surface inspection of areas not covered
with thick woods and brush. Shovel tests were dug to clay when possible; however,
some tests were terminated due to the presence of water. Three areas marked for
shovel testing were avoided due to standing water at the surface. The size of each test
was 30 x 50 cm and varied in depth from 10 to 60 centimeter below the existing ground
surface. All excavated fill was screened through Â¼ inch hardware cloth. Data obtained
from shovel testing were recorded on a shovel test log (Appendix I). In all, 43 shovel
tests were dug. The project area was documented through digital photography.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Examination of the files at TARL revealed one prehistoric site (41BZ38) has been
recorded at the southern edge of the project area. According to the Texas Archeological
Sites Atlas, professional archaeologists have not surveyed this area. Site 41BZ38 was
recorded by the author in 1978 based on the presence of two flakes and two possible
cores. The area where these artifacts were observed has been disturbed to the point
that it is no longer recognizable, and no cultural materials were found in any of the
shovel tests near the site area as previously recorded. It should be stated here that the
artifacts observed in 1978 were found in the road and outside of the current project
area. The project area was adequately covered, and the only cultural materials found
were the fragmented base of a modern bottle and a small unidentifiable bone fragment.
It is concluded that the project area was not a likely setting for prehistoric occupation
based on the shallow soils, shallow water table, and the fact that the only streams in the
area are the upper reaches of two minor tributaries. In historic times, the area was
probably used as pasture as indicated by the soil survey for Brazos County based on
the soil types present. No evidence of structures or features associated with farming or
ranching were observed. Disturbance along the tributaries consists of clearing and the
construction of ponds or stock tanks. In an aerial photograph dated 1974, the tributaries
appear to be undisturbed, but disturbance is visible in a 1996 aerial photograph.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No previously unrecorded sites were found in the project area, and site 41BZ38
was determined not to contain research potential. Therefore, it is recommended that
The Texas A&M University System be allowed to proceed with construction as planned.
It is always possible that archaeological sites are missed during any cultural resources
survey. Should areas containing prehistoric or historic artifacts not discussed in this
report be discovered during construction, the THC must be notified immediately and all
work stopped in the area of concern until the situation can be evaluated.
