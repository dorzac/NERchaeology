ABSTRACT

Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI), was contracted by the City of Dallas to conduct an archeological and
historic-age resource survey within a portion of the Dallas Zoo, for the African Savanna Exhibit.
A site visit was conducted on November 3, 2008 and archival research was conducted November
6 -7, 2008. The archeological reconnaissance determined that the area of potential effects (APE)
is heavily disturbed and there is no potential for intact archeological deposits. The historic-age
resource survey revealed two historic-age resources, the former Skinner Brothers Rubber
Company manufacturing plant at 641 E. 15th Street and a portion of the Zoo Annex Building at
627 E. 15th Street. Each of the two historic-age buildings have undergone multiple alterations and
each has, as a result, lost nearly all of the seven aspects of integrity required for a building to be
considered significant and eligible for listing in the NRHP. Therefore, the proposed African
Savanna Exhibit will have no effect on historic or archeological properties, and the project may
proceed without further investigation.

INTRODUCTION

Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI), was contracted by the Sedalco Company, a contractor for the City of
Dallas, to conduct archeological investigations and a historic-age resource survey of a portion of
the Dallas Zoo property, located west of Marsalis Avenue and south of the DART line. An
archeological investigation, consisting of a field reconnaissance, was conducted by Duane Peter
on November 3, 2008. Archival research was conducted by Jessica Forbes on November 6 â 7,
2008.

PROJECT AREA
The project area is located west of Marsalis Avenue and south of the DART line within the Dallas
Zoo (Figures 1 and 2). The project area is part of the Elephant, Giraffe, Lion, and Warthog
Exhibit at the Dallas Zoo, now known as the African Savanna Exhibit. The total project area is
approximately 11 acres.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY
The landscape of southern Dallas County consists of low, rolling hills between 500 ft and 750 ft
in elevation. The study area is drained by various minor streams that flow into Fivemile Creek
and Tenmile Creek, tributaries of the Trinity River, which in turn drains into the Gulf of Mexico
at Galveston.

GEOLOGY AND SOILS
The entire project area is underlain by the Austin Chalk, a Cretaceous-age limestone formation
(Coffee et al. 1980). There are numerous surface exposures of this formation throughout the
project area (see Chapter 5). Soils within the project area are mapped as Lewisville-Urban Land
and Austin-Urban Land complexes. They are well-drained, variably permeable soils on 0 to 4
and 2 to 5 percent slopes, respectively. Both of these complexes are very shallow, with combined
A and B horizons extending no more than 20 inches in depth (Coffee et al. 1980).

CLIMATE
In general, the greater Dallas area has a mild subtropical humid/subhumid climate with hot
summers and cool winters (Larkin and Bomar 1983). Summer temperatures average 84Â°F, with
an average daily maximum of 94Â°F and a record high of 111Â°F in 1954. Winter temperatures
average 48Â°F, with an average daily minimum of 38Â°F and a record low of 7Â°F in 1971. The
average yearly rainfall of 36 inches is seasonally biased toward a maximum in April/May and a
minimum in August. Much of the rainfall occurs in the form of heavy thunderstorms. Snowfall,
which is rare, averages less than 2 inches per year and is generally present for less than one week
(Coffee et al. 1980).

FLORA AND FAUNA
Dallas County is part of the Texan biotic province (Blair 1950). Almost the entire county falls
within the Blackland Prairie, one of several tall grass prairies present in the Northcentral part of
Texas. Blackland Prairie vegetation is dominated by uplands grasses; woodlands are restricted to
stream courses and river bottoms. Before Historic-period disturbances, the wooded areas would
have been covered by a water-oak/elm/hackberry forest, with occasional grassy clearings and
shallow water marshes and ponds. Today, this bottomland forest can include cedar elm,
American elm, willow oak, southern red oak, white oak, black willow, cottonwood, red ash,
sycamore, pecan, bois dâarc, flowering dogwood, dewberry, and coral-berry. Among the grasses
expected to occur within the prairie setting are little bluestem, big bluestem, Indiangrass,
dallisgrass, hairgrama switchgrass, rescuegrass, bermudagrass, sideoats grama, Texas
needlegrass, Torrey silver bluestem, eastern gamagrass, Virginia wildrye, Johnsongrass, giant
ragweed, and yankeeweed (Coffee et al. 1980). Most of this vegetation was probably present in
prehistoric times.
The faunal community in the region has undergone massive changes due to the expansion of the
Dallas-Fort Worth metropolis. Among the wildlife that would have previously inhabited the
region would have been openland species (bobwhite, quail, pheasant, meadowlark, field sparrow,
cottontail, and red fox), woodland species (wild turkey, ruffled grouse, woodcock, thrushes,
woodpeckers, squirrel, gray fox, raccoon, and deer), wetland inhabitants (ducks, geese, heron,
shore birds, muskrat, mink, and beaver), and rangeland species (antelope, deer, sage grouse,
meadowlark, and lark bunting), along with various species of reptiles (Coffee et al. 1980).

CHAPTER 3
CULTURAL SETTING

ARCHEOLOGICAL AND HISTORICAL CONTEXT

Prehistoric Context
Although the chronological framework for the upper Trinity River basin is not well developed,
the available data allow the delineation of the generalized chronology outlined below. The
application of this sequence to the study area is based primarily on investigations at Joe Pool
Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988).

Paleo-Indian Period
The Paleo-Indian period in Northcentral Texas (ca. 9500â6500 B.C.) generally includes the
remains of human presence that can be dated to the very late Pleistocene and the immediate postPleistocene periods (for reviews of this period relevant to Northcentral Texas, see Hofman 1989a;
Johnson 1989; Prikryl 1990; and Story 1990). Unfortunately, the Paleo-Indian occupation of the
upper Trinity River basin is known primarily through diagnostic projectile points from surface
collections or from stratigraphically mixed contexts (Meltzer 1987; Meltzer and Bever 1995).
The Field Ranch site (41CO10) along the upper Elm Fork is a prime example of typical site
contexts (Jensen 1968).
Clovis and Plainview points are commonly found along both Denton and Clear creeks in the
Cross Timbers, northwest of Dallas. Until recently, the Lewisville Lake site (41DN71) was the
best known Paleo-Indian site within the region, containing large burned features interpreted as
hearths and a low density of artifacts including a Clovis point (Crook and Harris 1957, 1958,
1961). Although the original radiocarbon dates on the hearths suggested an anomalous early age
for Clovis points (ca. 37,000 yrs before present [B.P.]), later work by the Smithsonian Institution
(Stanford 1981) appears to have resolved the controversy concerning the date of the occupation
there. It appears that the presence of naturally occurring ligniteâeither as a fuel in these hearths
or as an inadvertent inclusionâcontaminated the radiocarbon samples. Consequently, the usually
accepted date of 10,000â12,000 yrs B.P. for Clovis period occupations is probably a reasonable
estimate for the first human occupation of Northcentral Texas.
6

A spectacular exception to the generally limited data on Paleo-Indian sites in Northcentral Texas
is the deeply buried Clovis-age Aubrey site (41DN479), located on the Elm Fork of the Trinity
River north of Dallas (Ferring 1989). The discovery of this site, buried approximately 7â8 meters
(m) below the top of the Elm Fork floodplain just below the Lake Ray Roberts dam, suggests that
well-preserved Paleo-Indian sites in Northcentral Texas will only be found by examining deeply
stratified Holocene alluvium in modern floodplain situations. Ferring has suggested that PaleoIndian sites similar to the Aubrey site may occur below 18 m of sediment in the Dallas area.
Despite the lack of extensive data relating to the early Paleo-Indian period in Northcentral Texas,
some attempts have been made to generalize regarding settlement mobility and intensity of site
occupation, drawing on what is known and on assumptions based on comparisons with other
areas. For instance, a number of researchers have seen evidence for a high degree of group
mobility in the broad distribution of Paleo-Indian artifacts over the landscape and in the variety of
presumably nonlocal lithic raw materials from which the artifacts were made (Meltzer and Smith
1986; Shafer 1977; Story 1990). Likewise, the well-documented exploitation of large megafauna
by Paleo-Indians in the western United States, coupled with the known presence of similar faunal
species in Northcentral Texas between 11,000 and 9,000 years ago (see Slaughter and Hoover
1963), has resulted in the popular (and logical) conclusion that âbig game huntingâ was part of
the Paleo-Indian subsistence strategy in Northcentral Texas. However, the recent important
excavations at the Aubrey site have indicated that subsistence efforts did not focus on big game
animals alone. Rather, the occupants of the site used the entire range of prairie and forest species,
including bison, deer, rabbits, squirrels, fish, and abundant turtle (Ferring 1989; Ferring and Yates
1997). Interestingly, although mammoth remains are present, their exploitation has not been
substantiated (Ferring and Yates 1997). Whether this pattern of a more generalized foraging
subsistence system is characteristic of Clovis adaptations on the fringes of the Eastern Woodlands
and that the focus on now-extinct, big game species is more characteristic of a Plains adaptation
remains to be documented; Ferring and Yates (1997:5) suggest that, in general, the Clovis people
probably employed âvery flexible adaptive strategies.â

Archaic Period
The Archaic period in Northcentral Texas is tentatively dated between 6000 B.C. and A.D. 700.
As is true for many areas, a threefold division of the Archaic period, consisting of Early, Middle,
and Late âsubperiods,â has been applied in Northcentral Texas (Prikryl 1990). Thus, the Early
Archaic has been dated from 6000 to 4000 B.C., the Middle Archaic from 4000 to 1500 B.C., and
the Late Archaic from 1500 B.C. to A.D. 700 (recent overviews that cover the Archaic in this
portion of Texas include Hofman 1989a; Prikryl 1990; and Story 1985, 1990). Archaic remains
are usually found in upland settings and are frequently mixed with later material. In fact, the
initial treatments of the Archaic period in Northcentral Texas that defined the Carrollton and
Elam foci (Crook and Harris 1952, 1954) were based upon materials from such mixed terrace
contexts. Consequently, these time-space constructs are no longer recognized as being acceptable
for this area of Texas (Peter and McGregor 1988; Prikryl 1990; Yates and Ferring 1986). General
trends that have been proposed as characterizing the Archaic period in Northcentral Texas
suggest increasingly complex settlement systems, increasing population size and density,
gradually decreasing mobility, and development of distinct group territories (Prikryl 1990; Story
1985:52).

7

Late Prehistoric Period
The beginning of what is called the Late Prehistoric period in the upper Trinity River basin (ca.
A.D. 700â1600) is marked by the initial appearance of arrow points. The A.D. 700 date for the
start of this period is based upon dated contexts for similar material in the Brazos River drainage
to the west. Both Lynott (1977) and Prikryl (1990) have proposed that the Late Prehistoric period
be divided into an early and a late phase: the early phase reflecting a continuation of the foraging
subsistence system of the preceding Late Archaic period, and the late phase reflecting Southern
Plains influences. In this view, the early phase dates between A.D. 700 and 1200 and is
characterized by sand- and grog-tempered ceramics and by Scallorn, Steiner, Catahoula, and Alba
arrow points (Lynott 1977; Prikryl 1990). The late phase dates from A.D. 1200 to 1600 and is
associated with the appearance of Nocona Plain ceramics of the Henrietta focus, various
unstemmed triangular points (e.g., Maud, Fresno, Harrell, Washita), and the Perdiz point (Lynott
1977; Prikryl 1990). Evidence of horticulture and bison procurement also appears in sites of this
period (Harris and Harris 1970; Morris and Morris 1970).
Investigations at the Cobb-Pool site (41DL148) at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988)
have resulted in a reformulation of the Late Prehistoric period. The Cobb-Pool site has yielded
house structures, roasting pits, Alba points, grog-tempered ceramics, and charred corn cupules.
Radiocarbon dates from several features indicate the site was occupied during the late twelfth or
early thirteenth century. Present evidence suggests that the site does not represent an intrusive
Caddoan occupation; consequently, a significant adaptive change appears to have occurred, in at
least some areas, during a middle phase of the Late Prehistoric period. It is also likely that
ceramics were not introduced to the region before this time.
Whether the Cobb-Pool site merely represents a local experiment or reflects a regional adaptive
change separate from that emerging to the north remains to be fully documented; however,
analysis of a Native American burial salvaged along Spring Creek (site 41DL373) in Dallas
County also suggests maize consumption (Peter and Clow 2000). The individual was a female
around 50 years old. Radiocarbon dating indicates that this individual lived between A.D. 1155
and 1275; a carbon isotope ratio of -17.7 â° suggests that, although maize was consumed, it did
not form a major part of her diet (Peter and Clow 2000). These indications of maize consumption
contrast with a small grouping of disturbed human remains recovered from the Harbor Pointe site
(41DL369) in Dallas County (Cliff et al. 1996). This site, located on Rowlett Creek (a tributary
of the East Fork of the Trinity River) yielded remains of at least four individuals dated by
radiocarbon dating of bone collagen to cal A.D. 1010 (1035) 1165. No pottery was recovered
with these remains, although shell beads and a shell gorget were present; and a carbon isotope
ratio of -21.6 â° suggests that the groupâs diet was not high in maize (Cliff et al. 1996). Given
the slightly earlier date of the Harbor Pointe burials compared to Cobb-Pool and 41DL373, it is
possible that maize agriculture was introduced to the Dallas area ca. A.D. 1200; conversely, this
same evidence may indicate that divergent subsistence patterns were practiced by groups in the
Dallas area.

Protohistoric and Historic Native American Period
Within Northcentral Texas, the time from A.D. 1600 to 1800 has been designated the Protohistoric
period. Prior to the founding of New Mexico in 1598, the European presence in the Southwest
and on the Southern Plains had been sporadic at bestâCoronado in 1540â1541, the Rodriguez8

Chamuscado party in 1581, Espejo in 1582â1583, among others. After 1598, however, Spanish
influence was never absent from the Southern Plains, although actual contact with Europeans
continued to be limited and there are only brief records of journeys into or through the area
(Hofman 1989b; John 1975). Despite this, it was not until the beginning of the nineteenth century
that the physical presence of Europeans on the Southern Plains became commonplaceâthe result
of increasingly peaceful relations between the Spanish in Texas and the Plains Indians to the
north, and the acquisition of Louisiana by the United States in 1803. Prior to about 1725â1750,
Apachean groups appear to have dominated the western portion of the Southern Plains, known as
the High Plains, while after this time the area was increasingly controlled by the Comanche and
Kiowa. On the eastern portion of the Southern Plains, within the area now known as the Lower
Plains and Northcentral Texas, the Wichita tribes became dominant (Bell et al. 1967; Hofman
1989b:91).
Unfortunately, since good historical documentation is very sparse for the upper Trinity River
basin during the Protohistoric period, it is not clear which specific aboriginal groups were
residing in the Dallas area at the beginning of this period. What is clear is that the Protohistoric
period in Northcentral Texas was a time of population fluctuation, movement, and amalgamation
(see Newcomb 1993). Available data suggest that many, if not all, of the aboriginal occupants of
the eastern margin of the Great Plains, which includes Northcentral Texas, were Caddoanlanguage speakers, from the Arikara in the north to the Wichita and Kichai in the south. In this
light, it is worth noting that it has also been suggested that the Socoatino, encountered by the
survivors of the de Soto expedition in the sixteenth century, were Caddoan speakers and were the
same group as the Canohatino, identified by the French in the latter part of the seventeenth
century, apparently located at that time âon the Blackland Prairies between the Guadalupe and
Trinity rivers to the east of present-day San Antonio, Austin, and Wacoâ (Newcomb 1993:24). If
the prehistoric occupants of the eastern margin of the plains in Texas were indeed Caddoan
speakers, it would explain how they were absorbed very early by other Caddoan-speaking groups
(such as the Yojuane, Kichai, Tawakoni, Taovayas, Iscani, and Wichita proper) who arrived in
Northcentral Texas in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. Most of these groups,
in turn, amalgamated to form the historic Wichita Tribe, but some were probably absorbed by the
united Caddo Tribes, and some may even have joined amalgamations of a variety of groups, such
as the Tonkawa, during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.
The term Wichita has been used to refer to a group of linguistically related tribes, including the
Wichita, Taovayas, Tawakoni, Yscani, Waco, and Kichai, many of whom apparently entered the
Southern Plains in the seventeenth century, probably from Kansas and southern Nebraska, to
escape the hostilities of the Osage (Webb and Carroll 1952:2:904). The Wichita were true Plains
Villagers, with an economy that was jointly dependent upon agriculture and bison hunting. They
occupied permanent villages of beehive-shaped, grass houses, from which they conducted
seminomadic bison hunts. In 1719, their villages were located along the Arkansas River in
northern Oklahoma (Hofman 1989b:95). By 1750, they had moved some of their villages to
southern Oklahoma, along the Red River. Others were located on the upper end of the Sabine
and Neches rivers in Texas, and subsequently on the middle Trinity and upper Brazos rivers. In
1772, the year they concluded a nominal peace with the Spanish, one of their villages was on the
Salt Fork of the Brazos on the Lower Plains west of Dallas (John 1975:Map 3; Webb and Carroll
1952:2:705). Wichita groups were included in treaties made with the Republic of Texas in 1843
and with the United States government in 1837 and 1856 (Webb and Carroll 1952:2:709). In
Texas, they continued to live between the upper Brazos and Trinity rivers until 1855, when the
Tawakoni and Waco were placed on the Brazos Indian Reservation, south of Fort Belknap, in
9

company with a number of other Native American remnant groups (Smith 1996; Webb and
Carroll 1952:1:212, 2:905). As a result of increasing animosity from white settlers, the groups
were subsequently removed to Indian Territory in 1859 (Smith 1996; Webb and Carroll
1952:1:210). The remnants of the Wichita moved to Kansas during the Civil War but returned to
Oklahoma after the war to settle permanently near present-day Anadarko (Hofman 1989b:95).
The Comanche were a Shoshonean group originally residing along the upper Yellowstone and
Platte rivers. About the beginning of the eighteenth century, they left those areas and began to
migrate into the Southern Plains, where they drove a wedge between the Apache to the west
(driving them farther south and west) and the Pawnee and Wichita to the east. By the early
nineteenth century, their range was at its greatest extent, stretching from central Kansas to Austin,
and from Oklahoma City westward to Raton Pass in New Mexico. The most important divisions
of the Comanche included the Yamparika (root-eaters), who ranged along the Arkansas River; the
Kotsoteka (buffalo-eaters), who were just to the south of the Yamparika; the Nokoni (wanderers),
who occupied the territory along the Red River; the Quahadi (Antelope People), located on the
High Plains; and the Penateka (honey-eaters), who were the southernmost Comanche grouping in
Texas (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:385). Their earliest known raid in Texas was in 1758, when
they helped in the destruction of the mission of San SabÃ¡ de la Santa Cruz in present-day Menard
County; and for the next 117 years, they waged intermittent warfare first against the Spanish, then
the Mexicans, the Texans, and, finally, the United States (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:385). The
Comanche were nomadic Plains hunters, whose lifestyle depended upon the bison as a source of
meat and raw material for clothing, shelter, etc., and upon the horse as a means of hunting and
transport. The Comanche were signatories to the Medicine Lodge Treaty with the United States
in 1867, in which they agreed to cede all of their territory except for a 5,546-square-mile
reservation in southwestern Oklahoma. Following a general uprising of the Comanche and
Kiowa in 1874, they were defeated by the United States army in 1875 and permanently confined
to their Oklahoma reservation (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:385).
Archeological remains that can be associated with these Protohistoric groups are rare compared to
the remains of earlier periods. Within the upper Trinity River basin, and in Dallas County itself,
little evidence of these historic Indian groups has been found, with the exception of a few Native
American sites with European items (Sollberger 1953). In actuality, all of these groups are better
represented in the regions that surround the upper Trinity River valley.
Groups of the Wichita Confederacy, being Plains Villagers, have left much more substantial
archeological remains. A number of villages belonging to historic Wichita groups have been
identified and investigated in Oklahoma, in Northcentral Texas, and along the boundary of
Northcentral Texas and Northeast Texas (Bell 1984; Fox 1983:41â46). On the basis of
excavations at the Pearson site in Rains County, Texas, due east of Dallas County, the NorteÃ±o
focus has been proposed for these historic Wichita components (Duffield and Jelks 1961). The
most extensive archeological work has been done at several sites along the Red River in Texas
and Oklahoma, near the present-day Texas town of Spanish Fort, northwest of Dallas County,
which is believed by some to be the site of the village attacked by Parilla in 1759 (Bell et al.
1967). The excavations at the Longest site (34Jfâ1) in Oklahoma documented the presence of a
fortified enclosure and circular grass-covered lodges. Artifactual material recovered from these
Wichita sites shows a mixture of artifacts of Native American manufacture and of materials
obtained in trade with the French or the Spanish. Artifacts of Native American manufacture
include triangular arrow points (i.e., Fresno, Harrell, and Washita), thick end scrapers on flakes,
diamond-shaped beveled knives, T-shaped perforators, bifacial gun flints, bison scapula hoes,
10

pottery elbow pipes, and Womack Engraved pottery. Trade artifacts found to be present at
Wichita sites include metal knives and knife handles; axes; splitting wedges; kettle fragments;
awls; chisels; scissors; buttons; flintlock gun parts; bullets and shot; bridle parts; metal ornaments
such as bells, finger rings, and bracelets; and numerous trade beads (Fox 1983:45).
The pressure of the westward movement of Anglo-American settlers displaced numerous Native
Americans from their homelands north and east of Northcentral Texas. Delaware, Chickasaw,
Waco, Cherokee, Shawnee, Caddo, and Kichai sought refuge in Northcentral Texas. As the
Comanche and Kiowa attacked the less populated areas, skirmishes and raids were frequent in the
1830s.

Historic Context of Dallas County
In 1841, the Republic of Texas authorized the Texas Emigration and Land Company, also known
as the Peters Colony, to recruit settlers for a 1,300-square-mile area. Difficulties with local tribes
initially led many Anglo immigrants to settle in the area known as Birdâs Fort, which was located
south of present-day Euless. In 1843, a treaty between the Republic of Texas and area Native
American chiefs was signed, securing the Dallas County area for new settlers, while the west side
of Fort Worth would be occupied by Native American tribes. In the mid-1840s, other
communities outside of Dallas began to develop and the county was officially formed by order of
the state legislature (Maxwell 2008).
Many residents of Dallas and Tarrant counties were born in the South and naturally supported the
Southern position on secession. Although no Civil War battles occurred in Northcentral Texas,
the war created several major problems for the inhabitants of the region. The war made it
difficult to import manufactured goods into the region, and the economic woes of the
Confederacy led to such severe inflation that residents could not purchase products even when
they were available. In addition, the withdrawal of fighting men from the region contributed to
the retreat of the frontier, giving an increased potential for Native American attacks (Maxwell
2008).
Throughout Dallas County, the arrival of railroads brought changes in land use, the economy, and
community development. The railroads first arrived in the city of Dallas in 1872, with the
Houston and Texas Central running northâsouth. One year later, the Texas and Pacific Railway,
running eastâwest, intersected with the Houston and Texas Central, near the present-day
intersection of Pacific Avenue and Central Expressway within the city of Dallas. The railroads
provided a far-reaching transportation system and markets for exporting agricultural products,
and at the same time, brought building supplies and mechanized farm implements to county
residents, thus promoting both rural and town economies. The railroads also impacted
surrounding land use, community development, and demographics. Towns were established,
moved, or died as a direct result of the railroads (Maxwell 2008).
Between 1880 and 1920, Dallas Countyâs economy was based on agriculture. Crops included
cotton, hay, corn, wheat, oats, and sugar. Manufacturing, however, was taking hold and by 1920,
492 manufacturing plants employed nearly 9,000 people. At that time, 70 percent of the countyâs
population resided in Dallas, Oak Cliff, Carrollton, Lancaster, Garland, Grand Prairie, Mesquite,
and Richardson (Maxwell 2008).

11

During the 1930s and 1940s, the trend toward greater industrialization continued in towns, though
much of the surrounding area remained agrarian. As of 1950, Dallas County was 89.8 percent
urban. In the years following, agricultural interests reduced significantly: in 1950, 3,519 farms
were registered in the county, but by 1987, that had fallen to 927. On the other hand,
manufacturing was on the rise, with 1,068 manufacturers listed in 1947 and 3,616 in 1987. The
population of the county has also been steadily rising, tripling from 614,799 in 1950 to 1,852,810
in 1990 (Maxwell 2008).

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS IN THE STUDY AREA
The history of archeological investigations within the upper Trinity River drainage and the
culture-historical framework for the area are aptly summarized in three, major reports concerning
the archeology of the upper Trinity River basin (Peter and McGregor 1988; Prikryl 1990; Yates
and Ferring 1986). Although the combined efforts of professional and avocational archeologists
have resulted in the documentation of numerous sites, much research remains to be done. As
noted by McGregor (1988:27-29), much of the excavation efforts within the upper Trinity River
basin have focused on reservoir development, especially along the Elm Fork (Brown and Lebo
1991; Crook and Harris 1957, 1958, 1961; Ferring and Yates 1997, 1998; Lebo 1995a, 1995b;
Lebo and Brown 1990; Skinner 1982a, 1982b; Skinner and Baird 1985) and the East Fork
(Dawson and Sullivan 1973; Lorrain and Hoffrichter 1968; Lynott 1975; Ross 1966). Although,
investigations at Joe Pool Lake (Jurney et al. 1988; Peter and McGregor 1988) and test
excavations at the River Bend site, 41TR68 (Peter et al. 1987), have provided the initial data
assemblage necessary for understanding prehistoric adaptations along the West Fork of the
Trinity River.
In addition to these large projects, many smaller cultural resources investigations have been
conducted within or near the current project area. During 1974 and 1975, North Texas State
University (NTSU; now known as the University of North Texas) conducted an archeological
reconnaissance within the flood plain of Fivemile Creek (McCormick 1976). Six sites were
investigated during this project, two of which, 41DL80 (designated 41-DA-5 NTSU) and
41DL102 (designated 41-DA-6 NTSU), are within the Floodway Extension APE. In 1981,
Environment Consultants, Inc., undertook a survey for the Dallas Floodway Extension (Bennett et
al. 1981). Twenty-two sites were investigated during this project, of which 13 (sites 41DL69,
41DL70, 41DL73, 41DL80, 41DL84, 41DL91, 41DL99, 41DL104, 41DL204, 41DL205,
41DL206, 41DL208, and 41DL220) are located within the present Floodway Extension APE. In
1990, AR Consultants conducted an archeological survey for the Rochester Park Levee, and two
previously recorded sites, 41DL69 and 41DL70, were investigated. In addition, archival research
was conducted for the project area and an oral history of the nearby Metzger Dairy was recorded
(Skinner et al. 1990). Also in 1990, AR Consultants began a cultural resources survey of a
proposed new levee and associated borrow pits at the Central Wastewater Treatment Plant
(Skinner et al. 1991), after which AR Consultants continued to monitor the sites found at the
Central Wastewater Treatment Plant (Skinner and Whorton 1995). Sites 41DL318, 41DL319,
41DL337, 41DL338, 41DL355, 41DL356, and 41DL357 were all recorded during these
investigations. AR Consultants again visited the area in 1993 for an archeological survey around
Little Lemmon Lake (Skinner and Whorton 1993). Two sites (41DL350 and 41DL351) were
located, both of which are within the Floodway Extension APE. Finally, between 1995 and 1997,
AR Consultants monitored several construction projects within the Dallas Floodway immediately
north of the Project APE (Skinner, Whorton, and Trask 1996; Trask et al. 1997). Two historic
12

sites, 41DL370 and 41DL371, were recorded during one of these projects (Skinner, Whorton, and
Trask 1996).
Finally, in 1997, GMI conducted an archeological, architectural, and
geoarcheological evaluation of the area of the proposed Dallas Floodway Extension, which is to
run from the existing Dallas Floodway south to Interstate 20 (Cliff et al. 1998). These
evaluations have provided the basis for the current investigation.
Two archeological surveys have been conducted within a one-mile radius of the current APE
(Figure 3). Information related to the survey conducted near the project area, other than it was
performed in August of 1992, is totally lacking. Given that the Texas Historic Commission Site
Atlas does not show any sites within the project area, it is assumed that none were found (THC
Site Atlas). The only other survey within a one-mile radius was conducted in relation to the
South Oak Cliff Dart Line in 1992. A residential trash deposit dating to the first quarter of the
twentieth century was recorded along the bank of Cedar Creek as site 41DL347 (THC Site Atlas).

METHODOLOGY

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK
The cultural resources investigation documented in this report was undertaken with three primary
management goals in mind:
1. to locate all historic and prehistoric archeological resources occurring within the
designated project area;
2. to evaluate the significance of these resources in regard to their potential for inclusion in
the National Register (NRHP); and
3. to make recommendations for the treatment of these resources concerning the proposed
undertaking, based on their NRHP evaluations.
Ultimately, management decisions regarding cultural resources properties are a function of the
potential importance of such properties in addressing defined research needs. The assessment of
significance of a cultural resources property is based on federal guidelines and regulations. The
criteria to evaluate properties for inclusion in the NRHP are codified under the authority of the
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended. These criteria are presented in 36 CFR
Â§ 60.4 (aâd), which provides the guidelines used to determine a siteâs eligibility for inclusion in
the National Register. Subsequent to the identification of relevant historical themes and related
research questions, these four criteria of eligibility are applied:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and
culture is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity
of location, design, setting, material, workmanship, feeling, and association and
(a) that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad
patterns of our history; or
(b) that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
(c) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction,
or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that
represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack
individual distinction; or
(d) that have yielded or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or
history [39 CFR Part 60].
15

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH
Prior to fieldwork, GMI personnel performed a search of the available data sources. Records
maintained by the THC and TARL at the University of Texas at Austin were queried to identify
known sites within the project area and one-mile radius outside the project area. A literature
review to obtain information from previous investigations and data from geologic maps, soil
surveys, and aerial photographs was undertaken. This information was used to determine the
locations all known archeological sites as well as national and state historic landmarks, historic
cemeteries, and historic districts. Within the one-mile radius outside the project area there are
four historic districts: (1) Lancaster Avenue Commercial Historic District, (2) Miller and
Stemmons Historic District, (3) North Bishop Avenue Commercial Historic District, and (4)
Tenth Street Historic District. The results of the research were used to guide the field methods
and to locate landforms with a high potential to retain prehistoric archeological deposits or the
remains of historic structures.
ARCHEOLOGICAL SURVEY
The archeological survey methodologies employed in the current study are in accordance with the
State of Texas Antiquities Code and the guidelines of the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA)
as approved by the THC office of Division of Archeology and overseen by the State Historic
Preservation Officer (SHPO). The Department of the Interior's guidelines for addressing cultural
resources were also followed. The archeological investigations consisted of a review of historic
Sanborn maps and aerial photographs, a search for previous projects and recorded sites within the
Site Atlas, and a field reconnaissance of the entire 11-acre project area. A professional
archeologist with significant experience in Northcentral Texas conducted the field investigations.
HISTORICAL RESEARCH
Geo-Marine conducted a historic-age resource survey within the APE and evaluated such
resources for their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), as
per Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended. Typically,
resources that are 50 years of age or older are evaluated for NRHP eligibility under the standard
National Register Criteria A-D (Â§36CFR60.4). For this investigation, a letting date of 1 year
(based on the date of proposed demolition and beginning of new construction on the property)
was used; as such, all resources constructed in or before 1959 were evaluated for their eligibility
for listing on the NRHP.
Historians conducted a site visit on November 3, 2008 to photograph the APE and the extant
buildings. Typically, the date of construction for buildings and other pertinent information can be
derived from county tax appraiserâs records; however, in this instance, as a result of the cityâs
ownership of the property on which the buildings sit (presumably lumped together in one parcel)
Dallas Central Appraisal District records were not available for these individual buildings. In
order to determine the age of the buildings on the property, Sanborn Insurance Maps, accessed
through TexShareâs online database, were examined as were aerial photographs of the site,
ranging from 1942 to 2007. Banks Environmental Data provided the aerial photographs. An
architectural historian visited the Dallas Public Library and reviewed contextual materials and
Dallas City Directories dating from 1944 through 1972. Once buildings were determined to be
historic-age they were evaluated for their eligibility for listing on the NRHP using the criteria
discussed above.

CHAPTER 5
RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

ARCHITECTURAL RESOURCES
Currently, six mobile homes/pre-fabricated buildings, three warehouses, a former rubber factory
and one small commercial building are located within the APE. Of the eleven structures present
on the property, two are historic-age (constructed in or before 1959). The only buildings within
the APE that were present in 1959 or earlier are the former Skinner Brothers Rubber Company
manufacturing plant at 641 East 15th Street (Figure 4) and a portion of the current Zoo Annex
Building at 627 East 15th Street (Figure 5). The research and analysis revealed that the Annex
Building was not constructed for the Lyon-Gray Lumber Company, though one wall of the
current structure was part of a building on that property. The asymmetrical brick building at the
corner of 15th Street and Ewing Avenue, once numbered 801 South Ewing Avenue (Figure 6),
was not present until 1960. The large warehouse at 725 S. Ewing Avenue (Figure 7) was
constructed between 1972 and 1984 and, therefore, is not of historic age. The large warehouse
(originally addressed 803 Black Street) located across 15th Street from the Skinner Brothers
building was not present until 1960 (Figure 8). The mobile homes present within the APE
(Figures 9â12) are not of historic age and were not present on the site in or before 1959.
The historic-age structures located in the APE have undergone numerous alterations since their
original construction, thus, compromising their integrity in the materials, workmanship and
design. The buildings, located in a former industrial area, were all associated with industrial
activities in their historic period. Now used as part of the zoo operations, the buildings no longer
retain their integrity of association to their historic function. Their setting has been altered as
they are now located within a single, gated parcel that is not reflective of their historic setting in
an industrial area on a publicly accessible street. The compromises to the aforementioned aspects
of integrity impact the aspect of feeling, which is based in part on the cumulative presence and
quality of the other aspects of integrity. For each of the two historic-age buildings on the
property, multiple aspects of integrity are compromised or lost. Of the two historic-age buildings
on the Zoo property, neither is considered eligible for inclusion on the NRHP. The following is a
discussion of each of the historic-age buildings.

641 East 15th Street (Skinner Brothers Rubber Company Building)
The former Skinner Brothers Rubber Company manufacturing plant is located on a lot situated on
the northwest corner of 15th Street and what was formerly Black Street. Now vacant, the
company owned the building and operated the business at the time the Zoo/City of Dallas
purchased the property. The building was constructed circa 1950. City directories indicate that
no business was located at that address until 1950 when Skinner Brothers Rubber Company
opened their manufacturing plant and, prior to that date, all listings on that block of East 15th
Street were residential.
Originally, the building consisted of a one-story building with a rectangular footprint abutting
Black Street. The building now consists of five components that form an L-shaped footprint: (1)
a one-story red brick building with a rectangular footprint, (2) a one-story red brick hyphen at the
rear elevation of the rectangular building, (3) a one-story red brick and concrete block building
with a square footprint at the west elevation, attached to the rectangular building by the hyphen,
(4) a one-story shed addition, constructed of horizontal wood siding, located on the west elevation
of the rectangular building, and (5) a second-story addition at the front elevation, which appears
to have served as a business office, and, based on its Modern architectural style, appears to have
been added in the 1960s. All components of the building have a concrete foundation and a flat
roof.

22

Sanborn Insurance Maps show that in 1952, the factory consisted of one building with a
rectangular footprint (Figure 13) and a small attached warehouse at the rear (north end) of the
building on the west elevation. The current hyphen (Figure 14) and attached building (Figure 15)
are constructed of similar materials to that of the original rectangular building, and the attached
building features eight-light windows with metal muntins as does the rectangular building. The
center four lights of these windows are part of a single sash, hinged at the top, creating an awning
window in the center of the larger, fixed window. A variety of doors are present on the building.
A single-panel sliding corrugated metal door is located near the north corner of the east elevation.
On the west elevation of the rectangular building, an exterior stairway leads to the second floor
addition which is accessible through a single-door entry. A double-door entry and one roll-top
corrugated metal door are present on the west elevation. One single-panel sliding door is located
on the hyphen as well as the attached building. Many windows on the building have been altered,
having been partially bricked in, covered with plywood, or modified to cater to the operational
needs of the industrial equipment on both the interior and exterior of the building (Figures 16â
18). Though it reflects its historic use as an industrial facility, the addition of the second floor
office space at the south elevation (Figures 19 and 20), the wood frame attached shed (Figure 21),
as well as the other alterations contribute to the loss of the buildingâs integrity of materials,
design and workmanship. The buildingâs integrity of setting, association, and feeling are also
compromised. As a result, the building is not considered eligible for listing on the NRHP.

627 East 15th Street (Zoo Annex Building)
The building currently located at 627 E. 15th Street consists of one brick building and an attached
corrugated metal warehouse (Figure 22). The building was believed to have been part of the
Lyon-Gray Lumber Company lumber yard. Research suggests that the current building was not
constructed for Lyon-Gray, but a portion of it initially operated as the Dallas Broom and Mop
Manufacturing Company, and later, as part of the Dallas Wholesale Builders Supply Company.
The brick building, the historic-age component of the structure, has a concrete foundation and a
flat roof. The corrugated metal addition has a concrete foundation and a front-gabled roof. The
east elevation of the brick building has one roll-up industrial door at the north end of the
elevation, several bricked-in windows and two one-light fixed windows, one with a canvas
awning and vertical bars over the exterior and one with a one-light exterior screen.

figure

22.

627 East 15th Street, looking north-northeast

Figure 22. 627 East 15th Street, looking north-northeast.

The faÃ§ade appears to have been added in the late 1970s or early 1980s and consists of a shed
roof awning that runs the width of the south elevation of the brick building (Figure 23). One half
of the space beneath the awning is open, and the original brick is visible. The west half of the
space beneath the awning has been enclosed. Like the wall surface above the awning, the
enclosed area is covered with diagonal wood siding. Windows on the faÃ§ade addition are fixed,
one-light windows. The front elevation of the corrugated metal addition has one roll-up industrial
door. The diagonal paneling of the rectangular buildingâs faÃ§ade extends along the visible
portion of the east elevation of the corrugated metal warehouse addition and to part of the south
or primary elevation. The west elevation of the corrugated metal addition is constructed of
concrete block, and as a review of historic maps and aerials demonstrates, was originally part of a
building on the Lyon-Gray Lumber Company complex.

641 East 15th Street, looking northwest

Figure 23. 641 East 15th Street, looking northwest.

The Lyon-Gray Lumber Company opened its facility on East 15th Street in 1951 (The Daily Times
Herald, âOpening Set For New Yard,â 11 November 1951). The lumber yard facility was
addressed at 700 S. Marsalis Avenue and covered the majority of the block northeast of the
intersection of South Marsalis and East 15th Street. The block was bounded by the Gulf Coast &
San Francisco Railway to the north and Nabors Street to the east. On the 1922 Sanborn map with
revisions to 1950, no buildings are present on the northeast corner of Nabors and 15th streets. In
1952, the block was occupied by one rectangular building abutting Nabors Street and a complex
of structures associated with Lyon-Gray Lumber Company west of the rectangular building. The
majority of component structures associated with the Lyon-Gray Lumber Company were attached
and combined to form a complex L-shaped footprint.
In 1952, the rectangular building at 627 E. 15th Street was labeled on the Sanborn map as âMop
and Broom Factory.â City directories confirm that the Dallas Broom and Mop Manufacturing
Company operated from that address beginning in 1950 (Worleyâs Greater Dallas City Directory,
1950). In 1952, a narrow strip of land separated the broom and mop factory from the east wall of
the Lyon-Gray lumber complex. Aerial photographs reveal that between 1958 and 1972 a
building was constructed on the property between the two buildings, joining them. Dallas Broom
and Mop Manufacturing Company moved out of the building in 1958, and in 1959, the building
was listed as vacant (Polkâs Greater Dallas [Dallas Co., Texas] City Directory, vol. LXVII, 1959).
By 1960, Dallas Wholesale Builders Supply Company was listed at 627 East 15th Street and was
listed at that address in 1972 (Polkâs Greater Dallas [Dallas Co., Texas] City Directory, 1960;
1972). The construction of the adjoining structure between the Lyon-Gray building and the brick
building at 627 East 15th Street took place under the ownership of the Dallas Wholesale Builders
Supply Company.
29

An aerial taken in 1984 reveals that all but the Lyon-Gray warehouse, which formed the northern
third of the original building, was still extant and adjoined to the shared wall between the LyonGray structures and the adjoining building. The attached Lyon-Gray warehouse has since been
demolished. The current Dallas Zoo Annex Building consists of the mop and broom factory
building seen on the 1952 Sanborn and the adjoining building constructed between 1958 and
1962 which connected the factory building to the Lyon-Gray building. The only portion of the
Lyon-Gray complex that is extant is the concrete block wall that is now the west elevation of the
Zoo Annex building. The former broom and mop factory has been altered significantly with the
addition of the current wood faÃ§ade. Combined with the addition of the corrugated metal
warehouse in the 1960s, the buildingâs integrity of design, materials, and workmanship are no
longer present. The buildingâs integrity of setting, association, and feeling are also compromised.
As a result, the building is not considered eligible for listing on the NRHP.

ARCHEOLOGICAL RESOURCES
The field reconnaissance of the project area was implemented to determine if any undisturbed
areas remain within the APE. A review of the 1942 historic aerial photograph (Figure 24a) in
relation to the modern aerial photograph (Figure 24b) clearly indicates that post World War II
development in the APE (construction of industrial buildings) has effectively removed or
destroyed any archeological deposits associated with the dwellings that once existed within the
APE along 15th Street. Within the one area thought to potentially contain archeological deposits a
large drain pipe and a sunken area for a former teaching facility preclude the potential for
archeological deposits (Figures 25 and 26). Farther south in an area with the appearance of
potential contextual integrity, bedrock outcrops in numerous places (Figure 27); therefore, there is
no potential for archeological deposits with contextual integrity. Within the tree line paralleling
Marsalis Avenue, one finds a drainage ditch and the steep-sided berm supporting the elevated
Marsalis Avenue. Consequently, the reconnaissance survey revealed that the potential for
archeological deposits with contextual integrity is extremely limited within the proposed APE.
Therefore, it was decided that shovel testing was unnecessary.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

An archeological assessment and a historic-age survey of a portion of the Dallas Zoo property,
located west of Marsalis Avenue and south of the DART line was conducted by Geo-Marine, Inc.
to determine the potential impact of the proposed construction of the African Savanna Exhibit
sponsored by the City of Dallas on archeological and historic-age resources. The archeological
reconnaissance of the proposed APE revealed an area with significant disturbance and little soil
overlying limestone bedrock. Therefore, the potential for archeological deposits with contextual
integrity is extremely limited and it is recommended that no further archeological investigations
are necessary. The historic-age resource survey revealed two historic-age resources, the former
Skinner Brothers Rubber Company manufacturing plant at 641 E. 15th Street and a portion of the
Zoo Annex Building at 627 E. 15th Street. Each of the two historic-age buildings have undergone
multiple alterations and each has, as a result, lost nearly all of the seven aspects of integrity
required for a building to be considered significant and eligible for listing in the NRHP.
Therefore, the proposed African Savanna Exhibit would have no effect on historic or
archeological properties, and the project may proceed without further investigation.
