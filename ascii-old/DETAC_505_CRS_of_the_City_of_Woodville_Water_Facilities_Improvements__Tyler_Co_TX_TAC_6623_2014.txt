ABSTRACT
On the 16th of August 2013 Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants
(DETAC) conducted a cultural resource management survey of the proposed 0.8 hectare
(2 acre) water well location and 1,117 meters (3,665 feet) of raw water pipeline right-ofway north of Woodville, Texas. The pedestrian survey was conducted with a
combination of visual examination and shovel testing. The visual examination found the
water well location was highly disturbed and the proposed pipeline will parallel an
existing gas line corridor. Shovel testing of both the well area and the pipeline right-ofway were negative. The visual examination did find a steam engine boiler reused as a
culvert near an abandoned railroad grade along the pipeline route. No artifacts were
recovered in the 36 shovel tests excavated in the project area or during the surface
inspection; therefore, no artifacts were curated.
No further investigations are
recommended; however, if any cultural material is recovered during construction, then
excavation should stop and DETAC contacted to evaluate the impact. DETAC is
requesting concurrence with the determination of “no effect” on NRHP eligible
properties for the proposed project area.

INTRODUCTION
In August 2013, Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants (DETAC)
conducted a cultural resources survey of the City of Woodville, Water Facilities
(DRS220123 22053.1; GLOO 12-488-000-666) northeast of Woodville, Texas (Figure
1). Proposed construction includes clearing and leveling the well site and water line
right-of-way followed by excavation of a trench for the water line. The archaeological
survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit #6623.
The purpose of this survey was to locate, describe and record any cultural
resources within the project area boundaries. No cultural resources were found during
the surface inspection shovel testing of the project area; therefore, no artifacts were
curated. The pedestrian survey did find the well pad area was heavily impacted by past
industrial uses and the pipeline route will be adjacent to existing utility lines. The report
was prepared following the short report format outlined by the Council of Texas
Archaeologist (CTA) (1995a) with modifications requested by the THC (Martin 1999).
DETAC requests concurrence with a determination of “no effect” to properties listed or
eligible for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The project included construction of a water well and a raw water pipeline to an
existing facility. The water well pad will be approximately 91 meters (m) (300 feet (ft))
square or 0.8 hectares (ha.) (2 acres (ac.)). The raw water pipeline will be in a right-ofway approximately 9 m (30 ft) wide and 1,117 m (3,665 ft) long. The total project area is
roughly 1.8 ha. (4.4 ac.). Topographically, the well location will be on the summit of an
upland ridge. The raw water pipeline will cross two drainages separated by an interfluve
and end on the summit of a second upland ridge. Vegetation at the well location was
limited to pasture grasses while vegetation adjacent to the existing utility line was young
soft and hard wood trees with a dense understory of various bushes and shrubs. Ground
cover includes leaf litter in areas with trees and grasses along utility line.

PREVIOUS RESEARCH AND CULTURAL HISTORY
Tyler County has been studied in numerous linear and area surveys. Most of the
investigations were for road (e.g., Williams 2011) or pipelines and other industrial
developments (e.g., d’Aigl 2010). Other work was performed for the Corps of Engineers
around Steinhagen Lake (e.g. Jones 2009) in the northeastern portion of the county and in
the Big Thicket (e.g., Moore and Baxter 2007) in the eastern portion of the county.
These surveys generally show that sites were found adjacent to stream channels in the
floodplains on first terraces or along the toe slopes of higher ridges.
In addition to the fieldwork referenced above, several documents have added
significantly to available information on the archaeological record in this region. Initially,
Aten (1983) described coastal adaptation while Shafer and others (1975) described inland
adaptation along the lower Trinity and Neches rivers to the north. D.A. Story (1990) and
J.A. Guy (1990) discussed the area as part of their description of the Gulf Coastal Plain
which extends from southern Arkansas to the Gulf Coast. Finally, Ricklis (2004:181-204)
has the most up to date description of the southeast Texas region which extends from the
Gulf Coast to Angelina County.
The occupation of the area includes the Paleo-Indian (ca. pre-7000 B.C.), Archaic
foraging cultures (ca. 7000-200 B.C.), Early Ceramic Period (ca. 100 B.C. - A.D. 600),
Late Prehistoric Period (A.D. 800 - 1680), and the Historic Period (Perttula and
Kenmotsu 44:1993). The Paleo-Indian period is characterized by small, mobile bands of
hunters and gatherers that consumed a variety of native plants and animals principally
distributed in the valleys of major stream basins (Ricklis 2004:184). The Archaic refers
to hunter-gatherers who implemented more regionally specialized approaches toward
exploiting their environment (Story 1990). When compared to Paleo-Indian artifacts,
Archaic lithic assemblages are more functionally varied; however, tool types are
generally less well made and of increasingly more local materials than the Paleo-Indian
period and earlier Archaic (Ricklis 2004:184). Cemeteries date to the Archaic period as
well (Story 1990) and become an integral part of the late Archaic (Ricklis 2004:186).
The Early Ceramic period represents the diffusion of Tchefuncte ceramics and later Goose
Creek ceramic technology into the area from the Texas-Louisiana coastal area (Aten
1983:297; Ricklis 2004:189). The late prehistory of southeast Texas began with the arrival

3

of the bow and arrow and the wide spread use of grog tempered pottery, e.g., San Jacinto
Plain and Baytown Plain ceramics although earlier varieties continued (Ricklis
2004:200).

Larger aggregates of people became increasingly sedentary with the

introduction of the bow and arrow with populations specializing in environmental zones
(Aten 1983:91). The Historic Period describes both the history behind the current cultural
setting of the area and marks a transition from the native populations’ domination of the
area to the American immigrants’ establishment of farms, towns, and counties. The first
non-native inhabitants of the area were Spanish and American settlers competing for Land
Grants in the 1830’s. Tyler County was formed in 1846 from Liberty County (Biesele
2013). Town Bluff was the county seat until Woodville was established on donated land
along Turkey Creek. Plantations did not succeed in the area leaving the population to rely
on subsistence farming. Corn and sweet potatoes were the most valuable crops. The Civil
War and Reconstruction, while hard, were not substantial detriment to the population.
The first economic boom to the area was the arrival of the railroad and the timber industry
in the 1880s (Biesele 2013). Siviculture, which dominated the economic setting into the
1950s, was joined by oil/gas exploration in the late 1930s. The economy continues to rely
on siviculture and oil.gas exploration; however, ranching and poultry have added
significantly to the modern economy (Biesele 2013).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
The investigations were performed in compliance with the Texas Antiquities
Code following survey standards described by the Texas Historic Commission (2013)
and report guidelines set forth by the CTA (2005b). All fieldwork and reporting comply
with the ethics standards of the Texas Archaeological Society and the Register of
Professional Archaeologists.
The program of site definition was conducted in accordance with the National
Park Service criteria (36 CFR, part 60.4) for determining eligibility of a cultural resource
to the NRHP. The objectives of the survey were to locate prehistoric and historic cultural
resources sites within the survey areas. If sites were found, then the investigations were
to delineate the vertical and horizontal extent of each site, determine each site’s integrity,
and provide a preliminary evaluation of each site’s potential for NRHP eligibility.
Before initiating fieldwork, DETAC conducted a records and literature review
using the Texas Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2013). The atlas contains a current
database with published and unpublished data regarding cultural resource surveys, location
maps, and cultural resources records. In addition, these records show State Archaeological
Landmarks (SAL) and NRHP eligibility of previously recorded sites.
DETAC conducted a 100 percent pedestrian survey of the area. The pedestrian
survey relied on shovel testing and visual examination of the project area to locate sites.
Shovel testing included excavating an area approximately 30 centimeters (cm) in diameter
in 10 cm (4 inch (in)) levels down to the clay substrate or 90 cm (35 in). According to the
THC guidelines, the 0.8 ha. (2 ac.) for the well pad area required a minimum of two shovel
tests per every one acres while the pipeline required a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile.
Following these guidelines, the pedestrian survey included a surface inspection focused on
areas with exposed soil (e.g., erosional features and ant mounds) along with a minimum of
18 shovel tests. Shovel test locations were recorded with Ashtech GPS units with submeter post-processing accuracy. Notes were made about soil color, texture, and shovel test
depth.

RESULTS
The literature search and records review of the Texas Archaeological Site Atlas
(2013) found four archaeological investigations and four archaeological sites within 1.6
kilometers (km) (1 mile (mi)) of the project area. The surveys included two for the Texas
Water Development Board (TWDB) and one each for TxDot and a biorefinery.
Initially, Jurgens (1988) then Prewitt & Associates (1990) conducted pedestrian
surveys for the TWDB at various locations throughout the city of Woodville to include a
large portion of the Turkey Creek floodplain. Two archaeological sites, 41TL37 (lithic
scatter) and 41TL38 (prehistoric scatter and historic period home site) were documented
in the Turkey Creek floodplain.

Site 41TL38 was considered potently eligible for

inclusion to the NRHP and testing was recommended. Parsons Brinkerhoff Quade &
Douglas, Inc. conducted a pedestrian survey for TxDot as part of Hwy 69 improvements
(Campbell 2001). The survey included a 4.3 km (2.7 mi) long corridor to reroute Hwy 69
around Woodville following an abandoned railroad grade. No sites were documented
during the survey near the current project area, but site 41TL14 was revisited. Site
41TL14 was recorded as a mound site. Shovel testing by Campbell (2001) found a lithic
scatter and an Evans dart point near the mound; NRHP eligibility remained
undetermined. Finally, CRC, LLC conducted an archaeological survey for a biorefinery
(2010). The biorefinery survey included the proposed well location for the current
project area; no cultural resources were found during the survey.
One other archaeological site was documented within one mile of the project area.
Site 41TL24 is a reported mound. According to local folklore, it is the burial mound for
a Cherokee Princess from the 1830s when the Cherokee stayed in the area during
relocation to Oklahoma (Dean 1982). The mound is described as roughly 3.5 x 4 m (11 x
13 ft) in size and one meter (3 ft) tall. There are four beech trees at each corner. This
description is more similar to an early historic house site than a proto-historic mound, but
the landowner will not allow any testing of the area.

Well Site
The proposed well site encompasses a 96 m (300 ft) square area centered on the
water well location. Construction will include a gravel access road, a drilling rig, a well
head, and a 400 square foot (roughly 20x20 ft square) building. The building will be
constructed once the well is complete. The well site is on the summit of an upland ridge
overlooking Douchette Branch to the west and an unnamed tributary to the east.
Vegetation is exclusively pasture grasses.
Soils at the well location are described as Woodville (WnB) fine sandy loam
approximately 20 cm (9 in) deep over clay (NRCS 2013).
The pedestrian survey found the well area heavily disturbed. Bare areas with
asphalt and gravel dominated the northern half of the location. Grass covered mottled
gravelly clay soils over the southern half of the area (Figure 2). Shovel tests 1 through 5
found shallow disturbed soils (Table 1 and Figure 3). No cultural resources were found
in the shovel testing or the surface inspection. No further work is recommended for the
well site.

Pipeline
The proposed pipeline will be on the south side of an existing asphalt road from
the well location to an abandoned railroad grade and then it will follow an existing gas
utility corridor. The total pipeline length is approximately 1,117 m (3,665 ft) from the
well site to an existing water facility. The utility corridor is approximately 5m (15 ft)
wide. All drainages are spanned with culverts and approximately 60 cm (24 in) of fill is
in place over each culvert. Topographically, the pipeline will span two drainages divided
by an interfluve. Both the east and west ends of the pipeline are on upland ridges.
Vegetation is mixed pine and hardwood with a dense to moderate understory of various
bushes and shrubs. Soils include Woodville (WnB and WnD) on the western ridge,
Redco (ReD) on the interfluve, Alazan (AaB) on the drainage floors, with Hillster (HhD)
and Boykin (BoB) on the eastern ridge backslope and summit respectively (NRCS 2013).
Woodville series soils include fine sandy loam roughly 20 cm (9 in) deep over clay.
Redco series soils include a clay A horizon 15 cm (7 in) deep over clay. Alazan series

loam roughly 25 cm (10 in) deep over clay. Hillister series soils include loamy sand 71
cm (28 in) deep over sandy clay loam. And Boykin series soils consist of loamy fine
sand 60 cm (24 in) deep over sandy clay loam.
Surface inspection of the pipeline west end found the pipeline will be between
existing buried utilities and a ditch along the road surface. The modern disturbance and
slope in this area is sufficient to suggest shovel testing would not be successful. It is
uncertain if the proposed water line will use the north or the south side of the utility
corridor; therefore, both sides were examined and shovel tested. Examination of the
pipeline route found the topography highly dissected. Several culverts were found near
the drainage channels and many of the slopes were steep with several draws and gullies
on the ridge backslopes. All of the culverts were plastic tubes between 20 cm (9 in) and
90 cm (36 in) in diameter except for the western most culvert. The western culvert was a
railroad steam engine boiler. Use of steam engine boilers for culverts is common in areas
with logging histories and in close proximity to an abandoned railroad grade. The boiler,
while interesting, is out of context and was not recorded as an archaeological site (Figure
2).
Shovel testing along the pipeline found most of the soils highly eroded with
significantly less sandy and loamy deposits than were described in the soil descriptions.
Shovel Tests 6 thru 22 were excavated on the south side of the utility corridor and tests
23 thru 36 were excavated on the north side of the corridor. Shovel tests west of the
drainages found 20 to 40 cm (8 to 16 in) of reddish brown sandy loam. Shovel tests
between the drainages include scattered tests of black clay 20 cm (8 in) deep to sandy
loam 30 cm (12 in) deep. Shovel tests east of the drainages found 20 to 60 cm (8 to 24
in) of loamy sand and sandy loam soils on the toe slope and summit of the ridge. No
shovel tests were excavated along the steep slopes at the west or east end of the pipeline.
No artifacts were found in the shovel testing effort.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The proposed city of Woodville, Texas water well and raw water line will utilize
a 0.8 ha. (2 ac) area on an upland ridge summit and approximately 1,117 m (3,665 ft) of a
9 m (30 ft) wide corridor between two upland ridges for the project area. A surface
inspection found the well area was heavily disturbed and the pipeline route paralleling an
existing gas line corridor. The excavation of 36 shovel tests found soils similar to the
descriptions but shallower because of modern activity at the well location and along the
pipeline corridor.
The only noteworthy feature is the use of a steam engine boiler as a culvert near
the abandoned railroad grade.

No cultural resources were documented during the

surface inspection or the shovel testing of the project area. Based on the shovel test
results and the visual examination, there is little chance of encountering undiscovered
cultural resources in the project area; however, in the event that human remains and/or
archaeological materials are discovered during construction, then the project activity will
immediately cease and the THC shall be notified of the discovery. DETAC requests
concurrence with a determination of “no effect” to properties listed or eligible for the
NRHP as defined by the National Historic Preservation Act.
