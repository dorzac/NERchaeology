ABSTRACT
In March 2010, Geo-Marine, Inc., under contract to HNTB Corporation, conducted an intensive
archeological survey of a 0.54-acre (ac) parcel for a proposed bridge replacement at Stagecoach
Road and Lake Hardin Branch in southwest Montgomery County. The area of potential effects
(APE) is 97.5 meters (320 feet) long and 21.3 meters (70 feet) wide and is confined to the
existing roadway right-of-way. Vertical impacts within the APE will be restricted to the upper
0.9 meters (3 feet) except at the stream crossing, where depth of construction could extend to a
depth of 3 meters (10 feet). The archeological field investigation involved pedestrian survey and
judgmental shovel testing of the entire APE. The majority of the area was determined to be
disturbed from the construction and maintenance of Stagecoach Road and the existing bridge
structure. Two shovel tests were excavated in a forested area west of Stagecoach Road
determined to have the highest probability of containing intact deposits, and two shovel tests were
placed near the stream bank in the northwest quadrant to test the area to be affected by a proposed
temporary construction easement west of Stagecoach Road. No cultural materials were recovered
in any of the four shovel tests. Overall, the archeological integrity of the APE is low.
All data generated from this project will be permanently housed at the Texas Archeology
Research Laboratory in Austin at the conclusion of the project.

INTRODUCTION
The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) is proposing to replace the existing twosimple-span, timber stringer bridge on timber substructure at Stagecoach Road and Lake Hardin
Branch, Montgomery County, with a 26-foot C-span bridge-class culvert (Figures 1 and 2). The
proposed survey segment is approximately 97.5 meters (m; 320 feet [ft]) long with a current
right-of-way (ROW) width of approximately 21.3 m (70 ft). According to the engineering
schematics available (Figure 3), most of the construction activities will occur within the top 0.9 m
(3 ft) except at the stream banks where drilled support shafts could extend to a depth of 3 m
(10 ft). A small portion, approximately 21.3 m (70 ft) long and 18.3 m (60 ft) wide (0.1 acres), of
construction easement is required. The total 0.54 acres (ac) of current ROW and construction
easement comprises the area of potential effects (APE) for the project and includes a depth of 3 m
(10 ft) at the creek. The project area occurs within both state-owned ROW and private property.
TxDOT is required under the Antiquities Code of Texas (13 TAC 26.12) to provide an
environmental and cultural assessment of the area to be affected by the proposed construction
activities associated with the bridge replacement. HNTB was contracted to provide the
environmental consulting services for the project. Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI; project #
30007.13.01.02), of Plano, Texas, was then subcontracted by HNTB to provide the cultural
resources investigation portion of the project. Fieldwork was conducted on March 17, 2010, by
Ben Fullerton and Lindsey Skelton of GMI. Melissa Green, also of GMI, served as Principal
Investigator.
The purpose of the cultural resources investigation in this APE was to conduct an inventory or
determine the presence/absence of archeological resources (36 CFR 800.4) and to evaluate
identified resources for their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP), as per Section 106 (36 CRF 800) of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as
amended, or for designation as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL) under the Antiquities
Code of Texas (13 TAC 26.12). This project was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit
5560.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
This project corridor falls in a mostly rural, upland setting. The underlying geology for the
project consists of the Quaternary (Pleistocene) Willis Formation (Bureau of Economic Geology
1992). Soils in the project area fall within the Conroe association, which is composed of soils
that are deep, gently sloping to rolling, moderately and well-drained sandy soils that have clayey
lower layers (McClintock et al. 1972). The specific soil mapped within the project area is Conroe
loamy fine sand, 0 to 5 percent slopes (McClintock et al. 1972:12) and is nearly level to gently
sloping, occupying broad ridges with convex slopes. The profile consists of 7 centimeters (cm; 3
inches [in]) of grayish brown loamy fine sand with few ironstone concretions and overlays 53 cm
(21 in) of light yellowish brown loamy fine sand. This is followed by 7 cm (3 in) of sandy clay
loam with prominent red mottles, which grades into 30 cm (12 in) of yellowish brown clay with
prominent red mottles overlying 38 cm (15 in) of coarsely and prominently mottled red, brownish
yellow, and light gray clay that ends in 53 cm (21 in) of reticulated weak red, light gray, and
strong brown clay (McClintock et al. 1972:12).

CULTURAL HISTORY
Six archeological time periods have been associated with Native American occupations in
southeast Texas. These include Paleoindian, Archaic, Ceramic, Late Prehistoric, Protohistoric,
and Historic Indian. Archeologists within the region agree on the general framework, but there is
some discrepancy regarding the temporal boundaries of these periods. Pattersonâs (1995)
chronology includes Early Paleoindian (10,000â8000 B.C.), Late Paleoindian (8000â5000 B.C.),
Early Archaic (5000â3000 B.C.), Middle Archaic (3000â1500 B.C.), Late Archaic (1500 B.C.âA.D.
100); Early Ceramic (A.D. 100â600), Late Prehistoric (A.D. 600â1500), Protohistoric (A.D. 1500â
1700), and Historic Indian (A.D. 1700â1800). In contrast, Ensor (1990) offers a chronology that
includes Paleoindian (10,000â8000 B.C.), Early Archaic (8000â5000 B.C.), Middle Archaic
(5000â1000 B.C), Late Archaic (1000 B.C.âA.D. 400), Early Ceramic (A.D. 400â800), and Late
Ceramic (A.D. 800â1750). Despite the differences, the chronologies developed by researches are
based primarily on changes in projectile point technologies and the introduction of pottery.

METHODS
Prior to beginning fieldwork, the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas was consulted to determine if
any previously recorded cultural properties or cultural resources management projects have
occurred within a 1-kilometer (km; 0.6-mile [mi]) radius of the project area. The review indicates
that there are no archeological sites recorded or any cultural resources surveys that have been
conducted within a kilometer of the project area. Based on the information available, the
potential for identifying prehistoric or historic sites is fair to low.
The Houston District Potential Archeological Liability Map (PALM) was also consulted to
determine the type of archeological investigation recommended for the project area. PALM is a
predictive model that utilizes geoarcheological knowledge to identify areas that have the potential
for containing preserved archeological sites (Abbott 2001). PALM was used in this archeological
investigation as a planning tool for the conditions that were likely to be encountered in the field.
According to PALM, the project area falls within areas underlain by deep Holocene deposits that
exhibit low to moderate surficial disturbances. As a result, PALM data recommended a surface
survey with shovel testing and deep reconnaissance if deep impacts were anticipated; however,
deep reconnaissance was determined to be unwarranted due to extensive surface and subsurface
disturbances associated with the construction and maintenance of Stagecoach Road, and the
presence of the existing bridge structure, the Lake Hardin dam, and associated artificial
landforms. Additionally, the existing ROW west of Stagecoach Road where deposits appeared to
remain intact was inaccessible to machinery due to the presence of a steep slope and a dense
hardwood forest.
The project area was first traversed to inspect the ground surface and exposed stream banks for
the presence of cultural materials. Following this, shovel tests were judgmentally excavated in
areas that appeared to be minimally disturbed from previous construction activities. In some
cases, shovel tests were also excavated in order to estimate the degree of disturbance in specific
areas. The number of shovel tests excavated within the project is consistent with the survey
standards of three shovel tests per acre in survey areas of 2 acres or less as recommended by the
Council of Texas Archeologists and approved by the Texas Historical Commission. Each shovel
test was approximately 35 cm (14 in) in diameter and excavated in approximately 20-cm (8-in)
5

arbitrary levels to 80 cm (32 in) below surface (bs), or until subsoil was encountered. The soils
removed from shovel tests were processed through 0.635-cm (0.25-in) mesh screen. The soils
and any artifacts observed in each shovel test were recorded on standardized forms. Digital
photographs were used to document the survey conditions, disturbances, and any cultural features
observed. Details of each photograph were recorded on standardized forms.
All data generated from this project will be permanently housed at the Texas Archeology
Research Laboratory in Austin at the conclusion of the project.

RESULTS
The project area consists of Stagecoach Road, the existing two-simple-span, timber, stringer
bridge on timber substructure (Figure 4) underlain by a gabion filled with riprap (Figure 5), a
corrugated metal pipe culvert immediately north of the existing bridge structure (Figure 6), a
portion of the Lake Hardin earthen dam (Figure 7) east of Stagecoach Road, and a forested area
west of Stagecoach Road (Figure 8).

The survey began with an inspection of the ground surface and other exposed areas along the
creek banks for the presence of cultural materials or buried surfaces where intact cultural
materials could potentially be preserved; however, no archeological materials or buried surfaces
were noted during this process. During this initial walkover it became clear that the area within

the APE has been severely impacted by construction activities. Over 50 percent of the APE is
composed of Stagecoach Road and its intersection with Hartman Road at the southern boundary
of the APE. The entire APE to the east of Stagecoach Road is very narrow and consists of the
existing Lake Hardin earthen dam (see Figure 7), which has significantly compromised the
integrity of the deposits within this setting. To the west of Stagecoach Road, a 20â30 degree
slope descends into the creek bed of Lake Hardin Branch. Here, two distinct modern debris piles
are separated by a large spoil heap (Figures 9 and 10). Modern bricks, corrugated sheet metal,
rebar, concrete and plastic culvert debris, and asphalt were observed within these debris piles
(Figure 11). North of these disturbances within the northwest quadrant of the APE, an
approximately 2-m-high (6.6 ft) south-facing stream cutbank, was observed (Figure 12). The soil
profile exposed in this cutbank was determined to closely resemble the description of the Conroe
loamy fine sand, 0 to 5 percent slopes, soil unit mapped within the project area. This indicated
that the only intact deposits present within the project area were likely located in the northwest
quadrant between this cutbank exposure and the northern extent of the project area. As a result,
the majority of shovel testing was concentrated in this area.

Four shovel tests were excavated within the 0.54-acre project area, resulting in a total density of
7.84 shovel tests per acre (Table 1; see Figure 2). Shovel Tests 1 and 3 were excavated
approximately 10 m (33 ft) apart in the northwest quadrant of the forested area below the slope
descending from the west of Stagecoach Road. The profiles of the shovel tests were nearly
identical and consisted of a dark brown (10YR 3/3) sandy loam between 0 and 10 cm bs (0â4 in),
a yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) sandy clay loam with brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) and light gray
(10YR 7/2) mottles between 10 and 25 cm bs (4â10 in), a brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) sand

sandy loam with strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) mottles (Figure 13). Sporadic charcoal flecks were
noted between 10 and 25 cm bs (4â10 in) in both shovel tests; however, no cultural materials
were found in association with the charcoal. As a result, the charcoal was attributed to natural
burning.
Shovel Test 2 was excavated in the northwest quadrant directly to the north of the stream cutbank
exposure described above. It was excavated approximately 22 m (72 ft) to the west of
Stagecoach Road and the culvert in the area to be affected by the proposed temporary
construction easement. The profile consisted of a brown (10YR 4/3) sandy loam between 0 and
10 cm bs (0â4 in), a brown (10YR 4/3) sandy loam with very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) and
brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) mottles between 10 and 20 cm bs (4â8 in), a brown (10YR 4/3)
sandy loam with pale brown (10YR 6/3) mottles between 20 and 50 cm bs (8â20 in), and a
yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam with yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) mottles between 50
and 80 cm bs (20â32 in). No cultural materials were recovered from the shovel test.
Lastly, Shovel Test 4 was excavated on an elevated area separating two debris piles (see Figure 9)
within the area to be affected by the proposed temporary construction easement. The profile
encountered was very disturbed, consisting of a yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay with very pale
brown (10YR 8/2) and red (2.5YR 5/8) mottles between 0 and 80 cm bs (0â32 in). Concrete and
asphalt inclusions were noted throughout the profile, indicating that the elevated area likely
represents a spoil pile resulting from previous construction activities.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The archeological investigations undertaken within the project area did not recover any cultural
materials and indicated that the majority of the project area has been disturbed by modern
construction activities. No historic properties as defined under 36 CFR 60.4, 13 TAC 26.5(6), 13
TAC 26.5(32), and 13 TAC 26.8 were identified during the archeological investigation of the
current project APE. As a result of these investigations, there appears to be little potential for the
presence of significant archeological deposits within the project area. In accordance with 36 CFR
800.4(d)(2) and 13 TAC 26.2, no further investigation is necessary. Consequently, it is
recommended that construction be allowed to proceed. If archeological deposits are encountered
during construction, work should cease and the Texas Historical Commission should be notified.
