THE PETROLIA CALABOOSE

INTRODUCTION
I have visited all 254 Texas counties and it was not until April of 2013 that I saw
my first Texas calaboose. That name was familiar to me from the many western movies I
had seen as a child. Being locked up in the calaboose was a phrase I had heard often but I
had never equated it with anything but the typical western jail as depicted by Hollywood.
Behind the local grocery store in Gause, Texas is a small concrete structure that
immediately caught my attention. When I asked one of the local residents about this
interesting building I was told that it was their calaboose. One of my first thoughts was
how unpleasant it must have been to be locked up in a small building with a dirt floor
andono plumbing or electricity. The summer heat must have been unbearable as would
have been cold winter days and nights.
There is no formal definition for a calaboose. The name was derived from a very
old Spanish word (Calabozo) that means jail or dungeon. These tiny structures were
mainly used for short term or overnight stays for minor offenses such as drinking and
fighting. They also served as holding facilities for the more serious prisoners until
transportation to the county jail could be arranged. My current definition of a calaboose is
a small one-story structure that varies in size from 72 square feet to 363 square feet. The
most common type only has one room or cell. Those with two cells are the next most
common and only three with three cells have been identified so far.
My visit to Petrolia in Clay County was one of many trips across the state. At the
time of this writing, I have visited more than 80 similar structures and identified many
more that are now gone. I have a website (www.tinytexasjails.com.) that documents my
progress, and I greatly value any comments and learning about calabooses that I am not
aware of. Each calaboose has been recorded at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory on the campus of The University of Texas at Austin as a historic site. The
number assigned to the one in Petrolia that is 41CY21.
I visited Petrolia on July 1, 2013 and documented a small calaboose that is located
at 114 Benton Street (cover photo). It is privately owned and access to the interior was
not possible. To the casual observer this small structure does not look as if its original
purpose was a place to hold prisoners until they could be released or taken to the county
jail in Henrietta, a distance of fourteen miles. The door has been replaced or covered
with wood. When it was built, the door could have been solid metal or a frame with one
of many varieties or patterns of metal bars. According to a local informant the metal bars
were removed from the window openings and new wooden double-hung window were
added. This building served a secondary function as a small office for the city water
department.

The age of this calaboose is not known but it is likely that it was constructed
sometime during the early to middle part of the 20th century. The town of Petrolia was
established circa 1904. By 1905, it was booming and contained such profitable
businesses as a post office, hotel bank, drugstore, barbershop, livery stable, dry-goods
store, hardware store, furniture store, meat market, lumberyard, icehouse, two oilfieldsupply stores, and at least one cotton gin. It seems reasonable that sometime during the
early days of Petrolia the need for a jail became apparent and the one still standing on
Benton Street was constructed.
The calaboose rests on a concrete slab. The walls consist of a double row of
bricks, probably a construction technique designed for better security. Fired brick was
chosen to create the new calaboose. One exposed brick bears the name “Globe,” but it is
not known if that brand was used for the entire structure. The roof is wood covered with
a cement slab. There are two windows (60 cm x 118 cm). One is on the northeast side
(Figure 1) and the other is on the back wall (Figure 2). The door measures 83 cm x 200
cm. The front is 4.3 m wide and the sides are 2.94 m long. The distance from the
ground to the top of the walls is 2.36 m. There are several places where bricks are
missing and there is a large crack in the northwest wall. A portion of the outer wall on
the front is missing and this enables a view of the double wall method of construction
(Figure 1).

As	
  stated	
  above,	
  this	
  building	
  is	
  not	
  easily	
  recognizable	
  as	
  a	
  former	
  calaboose.	
  	
  
However,	
  the	
  floor	
  plan	
  is	
  consistent	
  with	
  others	
  that	
  I	
  have	
  visited.	
  	
  The	
  door	
  is	
  not	
  
centered	
  and	
  that	
  suggests	
  that	
  the	
  interior	
  consists	
  of	
  two	
  rooms.	
  	
  Upon	
  entering	
  the	
  
calaboose	
  one	
  would	
  encounter	
  an	
  open	
  room	
  that	
  was	
  probably	
  used	
  by	
  law	
  
enforcement	
  officers	
  as	
  a	
  place	
  to	
  administer	
  to	
  the	
  needs	
  of	
  the	
  prisoners	
  without	
  
opening	
  a	
  door	
  to	
  the	
  outside.	
  	
  The	
  cell	
  would	
  have	
  been	
  to	
  the	
  right	
  of	
  the	
  outside	
  door	
  
and	
  would	
  have	
  been	
  separated	
  by	
  metal	
  bars.	
  	
  The	
  calaboose	
  in	
  Lakeview	
  (Hall	
  
County)	
  has	
  a	
  similar	
  floor	
  plan	
  except	
  the	
  cell	
  is	
  to	
  the	
  left	
  of	
  the	
  door	
  (Figure	
  3).

Because	
  entry	
  into	
  the	
  calaboose	
  was	
  not	
  possible,	
  the	
  only	
  measurements	
  taken	
  
were	
  of	
  the	
  exterior	
  (Figure	
  4).	
  	
  	
  The	
  only	
  statement	
  that	
  can	
  be	
  made	
  about	
  the	
  cell	
  is	
  
that	
  the	
  bars	
  would	
  have	
  stopped	
  short	
  of	
  the	
  door	
  on	
  the	
  outside.
