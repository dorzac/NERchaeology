ABSTRACT
General
A cultural resources survey in Franklin, Morris, and Titus counties, Texas
was performed by Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) in October and
November of 2012 for Tri Special Utility District of Mount Pleasant, Texas
(Antiquities permit 6353). The area investigated consists of approximately twenty
miles of proposed water line (36.36 acres) that will be placed on private property.
The Area of Direct Effect or project Area of Potential Effect (APE) is the footprint of
the proposed water line that is 15 feet wide. The Area of Indirect Effect includes all
cultural resources within 100 feet of the APE. Cultural resources recorded and
visited include archaeological sites, cemeteries, historic structures, areas where
structures once stood, historic above ground features, and a prehistoric locality.
These are discussed below.
Franklin County Cultural Resources
Five new sites were recorded in Franklin County. They are 41FK140 –
41FK144. They are discussed below in terms of their eligibility. No features were
observed at any of these sites, and various forms of disturbance were observed at
each site. These sites are discussed in detail in the section entitled “Franklin
County Cultural Resources” below.
Site 41FK140 is a multi-component site that did not yield a large number
of artifacts. The prehistoric component consisted of only four flakes, and the
historic component consisted of two stoneware ceramic sherds and a shotgun
shell casing. This is a shallow site with all artifacts found between the surface
and 20 cm. The portion of site 41FK140 located within the project area APE is
not eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.
Site 41FK141 is a prehistoric site that yielded eight flakes. The portion of
site 41FK141 located within the project area APE is not eligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places.
Site 41FK142 is a prehistoric site that yielded three flakes and a metate
fragment. This is a shallow site with all artifacts found from 0 to 33 cm. The
portion of site 41FK142 located within the project area APE is not eligible for
listing in the National Register of Historic Places.
Site 41FK143 is a historic site that probably represents a small trash
scatter that was associated with a nearby tenant house. The portion of site
41FK143 located within the project area APE is not eligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places.

ii

Site 41FK144 is a multi-component site. The prehistoric component
consists of flakes and Caddo ceramics found on a very disturbed surface and in
shovel tests that did not exceed 30 cm in depth. The historic component is a
trash scatter that may have been associated with structures about 140 m to the
southwest. The portion of site 41FK144 located within the project area APE is
not eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.
Locality 1 is the Murphree family cemetery (FK-C019) that contains the
remains of members of the Murphree, Goode, and Price families. The graves are
marked with carved headstones, ferrous rocks, and bricks; and the oldest is
dated 1904. The APE is approximately 50 feet to the nearest known grave. It is
recommended that the water line be placed at a distance sufficient to avoid direct
effect to this historic site.
Locality 2 is the Smith family cemetery (FK-C020), and the earliest marked
grave is for Mary E. Smith who died in 1891. This cemetery is in thick woods, and
only three graves were visible when local historians B. F. Hicks, and Doris Meek
visited it. They described it as a “lost cemetery in the woods” about one-fourth mile
north of the Murphree Cemetery. There will be no direct effect to this cemetery by
the proposed water line.
Locality 3 is a recent burial of one individual on private property and not
part of a dedicated cemetery. It is recommended that the water line be placed on
the opposite side of the road to avoid direct effect to this historic site.
Locality 4 is the Midway Cemetery (FK-C021). This is a well-maintained
cemetery that dates to circa 1900. According to Mr. Hicks, it is at least 75 feet from
the APE, and there is a paved parking lot between the road and the cemetery.
There will be no direct effect to this historic site by the water line as currently
proposed. The Midway Church depicted on the map is no longer there.
A portion of the historic Cherokee Trace follows the route of CR 2110 along
the north-south section of the APE. According to B. F. Hicks who has researched
the Trace, it was used for hundreds of years and evolved from a trail to a road for
wagons, and eventually CR 2110. The APE is on private property outside of the
right-of-way and footprint of the Trace. There will be no direct effect to this historic
site by the water line as currently proposed.
Morris County Cultural Resources
Two previously recorded sites (41MX62 and 41MX141) and five new sites
(41MX143 – 41MX147) are located within the APE. They are discussed below in
terms of their eligibility. Disturbance was observed at each site, and the various
types include overhead utility lines, fences, road construction, existing water lines,
and agricultural activities. The only site where features were observed was
41MX144. These sites are discussed in detail in the section entitled “Morris County
Cultural Resources” below.

iii

Site 41MX62 is a prehistoric site that yielded twelve flakes, one Gary point,
and one medial segment of a biface. The presence of flakes made from novaculite
suggests trade and interaction with groups in areas outside of Texas. The age of
this site cannot be determined based on a single diagnostic artifact, but Gary points
are usually associated with the Archaic. The original recorder of this site reported
finding a San Patrice point that may represent a Paleo-Indian component. The
apparent absence of pottery and arrow points suggests that a single Archaic
component may be present. The eligibility of that portion of site 41MX62 located
within the project area APE for listing in the National Register of Historic Places is
undetermined, and avoidance or significance testing is recommended.
Site 41MX141 is a prehistoric site that yielded a Yarbrough point, a medial
segment of a biface, and eleven flakes. The age of this site cannot be
determined based on a single diagnostic artifact, but Yarbrough points date to
the Archaic. Since no ceramics or arrow points were found in an area that was
thoroughly shovel tested, it is possible that this is a single component site that
dates to the Archaic period of Texas prehistory. This statement is supported by
the fact that all cultural materials were found at depths of 20 cm to 40 cm, and it
appears that most of the site area is uniform in terms of depth. The eligibility of
that portion of site 41MX141 located within the project area APE for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places is undetermined, and avoidance or
significance testing is recommended.
Site 41MX143 is shallow prehistoric site with large areas of subsoil clay
exposure. Seven shovel tests were dug at this site, and two were positive. Artifacts
recovered include one quartzite flake at 0-14 cm and one flake made from jasper at
0-10 cm. In addition, one chert flake and three quartzite flakes were observed on
the surface. The portion of site 41MX143 located within the project area APE is not
eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.
Site 41MX144 is a multi-component site that yielded both prehistoric and
historic artifacts. The prehistoric component is represented by two quartzite
flakes, and the historic component is represented by a well and cellar within the
APE, a concrete tiled well several meters to the north, and artifacts that include a
porcelain ceramic sherd, wire nail, and possible bathroom tile fragment. It is
recommended that the well and cellar be avoided during the construction of the
water line. Charles Russell lives in the area and he stated that this site was
owned by Ervin Vaught who built a house there in the 1940s. The house was
destroyed by fire sometime after 1980. The portion of site 41MX144 located
within the project area APE is not eligible for listing in the National Register of
Historic Places. It is recommended that the wells and cellar be avoided.

iv

Site 41MX145 is a historic site that yielded a small amount of assorted glass
and a whiteware ceramic sherd. Along the southern edge of the site is a large pile
of flat sandstone rocks that were brought in to fill in a pond. The survey recovered
artifacts in an area near an existing house, and they may be related to this
structure. The rock feature is not part of the historic site and is not significant. The
portion of site 41MX145 located within the project area APE is not eligible for listing
in the National Register of Historic Places.
Site 41MX146 is a multi-component site that contained both prehistoric
and historic artifacts. The prehistoric component consists of two quartzite flakes,
and the historic component consists of ten fragments of clear glass, one clear
glass rim for a screw top jar, and a flowerpot fragment. The historic component
is probably a trash scatter that is related to nearby structures. The portion of site
41MX146 located within the project area APE is not eligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places.
Site 41MX147 is a prehistoric site that yielded two quartzite flakes, one
flake made from jasper, and one novaculite flake. The portion of site 41MX147
located within the project area APE is not eligible for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places.
Locality 5 is the Robert L. Talley house that was erected during the latter half
of the 19th century. The original plan included a dog run in the center, but it was
later modified when other rooms were added and the back porch was converted to
a bathroom with modern plumbing. This house is not eligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places. All above ground water line components will
be greater than 100 feet from this structure; thereby avoiding all indirect effects.
Locality 6 is the site of a house that is depicted on a 1908 soil map of
Franklin, Titus, and Morris counties prepared by the United States Department of
Agriculture, Bureau of Soils. Charles Russell lives in the area and he stated that it
was probably erected in the 1940s. At the time of this survey there was no
evidence of a house. There will be no direct or indirect effects caused by above
ground water line components.
Locality 7 is the Ned Walker house that was built in 1859 for one of the early
settlers of the area, J. G. Henderson. The Walkers are credited with preserving it,
and the house was recognized as a Registered Texas Historic Landmark in 1967.
During the initial restoration, some of the original lumber was sold, and very little of
the original structure remains today. This site is not eligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places, and all above ground water line components
will be greater than 100 feet from this structure; thereby avoiding all indirect
effects.

v

Locality 8 is a wooden frame house that was first owned by J. C. Cherry;
however, the date it was constructed is not known. All above ground water line
components will be greater than 100 feet from this structure; thereby avoiding all
indirect effects.
Locality 9 is an isolated well. According to Charles Russell, it was part of the
J. C. Cherry Estate (see Locality 8) and never associated with a house. There will
be no direct or indirect effects to this feature caused by above ground water line
components.
Locality 10 is the site of a house that is depicted on a 1908 soil map of
Franklin, Titus, and Morris counties prepared by the United States Department of
Agriculture, Bureau of Soils. According to Charles Russell, it was known as the
McCollum Place. He said it was destroyed by fire, but he does not know when
that occurred. At the time of this survey there was no evidence of a house.
There will be no direct or indirect effects caused by above ground water line
components.
Locality 11 is a single quartzite interior flake found in a shovel test that was
excavated on the east side of US Highway 259 and the west bank of an unnamed
tributary of Okry Creek. The portion of this locality in the project area APE is not
eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places, and no further work is
recommended.
Titus County Cultural Resources
Four previously recorded sites (41TT100, 41TT101, 41TT873, and
41TT875) are located within the APE or in close proximity to it, and four new sites
(41TT919 – 41TT922) were recorded within the APE. No features were observed
at any of these sites, and various forms of disturbance were observed at each site.
These sites are discussed in detail in the section entitled “Titus County Cultural
Resources” below.
Site 41TT100 is a prehistoric site that was recorded on the basis of ceramics
and flakes collected by archaeologists from TxDOT in 1975. Archaeologists from
PBS&J visited the site in 2009 and excavated twenty-two shovel tests, but not one
contained artifacts. Since the location of the artifacts collected during the previous
visits is not depicted on the site maps, it is not known if they are near the APE.
Based on thorough coverage of the area through shovel testing, the portion of site
41TT100 within the project area APE does not appear to be eligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places.

vi

Site 41TT101 is a multi-component site that contains both prehistoric and
historic artifacts. The prehistoric component consists of chert and quartzite flakes
observed during the two visits to this site, and pottery was reported by local
residents. The historic component is a trash scatter that consists of whiteware,
transfer ware, baked clay, brown glass, crockery, bone, and metal wire. This site is
at least 10 m east of the APE, and there will be no direct effect to this site. The
eligibility of this site for listing in the National Register of Historic Places is
undetermined, and avoidance or testing may be necessary if it is threatened by
future development.
Site 41TT873 is a prehistoric site that was recorded on the basis of two
flakes between 10 and 20 cm. The recovery of only two flakes suggests that this
site is not significant, and some archaeologists would have recorded it as an
isolated find. The portion of site 41TT873 located within the project area APE is
not eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.
Site 41TT875 is a prehistoric site that was recorded on the basis of two
flakes. The recovery of only two flakes suggests that this site is not significant, and
some archaeologists would have recorded it as an isolated find. This site is not
within the APE, and it is not eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic
Places, and no further work is warranted.
Site 41TT919 is a prehistoric site that yielded three quartzite flakes at 0-20
cm below the surface. The recovery of only three flakes suggests that this site is
not significant, and some archaeologists would have recorded it as an isolated
find. The portion of site 41TT919 located within the project area APE is not
eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.
Site 41TT920 is a prehistoric site that yielded three quartzite flakes at 0-32
cm. The recovery of only three flakes suggests that this site is not significant,
and some archaeologists would have recorded it as an isolated find. The portion
of site 41TT920 located within the project area APE is not eligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places.
Site 41TT921 is a multi-component site with both prehistoric and historic
artifacts. The prehistoric component is a pimple mound that has been disturbed
by construction of the county road. The artifact yield was of twenty flakes, and
the historic component consists of one clear glass fragment. This is a shallow
site with all artifacts found at depths of 0-20 cm. The historic artifacts may
represent a minor trash scatter related to a barn and possible residence on the
other side of the road. The portion of site 41TT921 located within the project
area APE is not eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.

vii

Site 41TT922 is a multi-component site with both prehistoric and historic
artifacts. The main part of the site is the top of the landform where the Hollis
residence is located. Mr. Hollis stated that numerous projectile points and pottery
sherds were found when the hill was scraped to create a level surface for the house
foundation and in the gardens and other disturbed areas on top of the hill. The
prehistoric component yielded thirty-one quartzite flakes and one Yarbrough point.
The presence of dart points, arrow points, and ceramics in the Hollis collection
suggests that it was occupied during the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods. The
historic component is represented by two clear glass fragments. The portion of the
site where the main concentration of artifacts has been found by Mr. Hollis may be
eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places, but the portion of this
site located within the project area APE is not eligible for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places.
Locality 12 is a wooden frame house with a metal pyramid or hipped roof.
The double doors on the front suggest separate rooms. The date of construction
and original owner are not known. All above ground water line components will be
greater than 100 feet from this structure; thereby avoiding all indirect effects.
At one time, the Paris and Mount Pleasant Railroad crossed the project area
near the intersection of CR 1828 and FM 71 in the City of Talco. No site number
was assigned to this area.
Copies of the report are on file at the THC, Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL), the Texas State Library, Tri Special Utility District, and BVRA.
The artifacts were returned to the landowners, and the records are curated at
TARL.

INTRODUCTION
Tri Special Utility District of Mount Pleasant, Texas plans to install
approximately twenty miles of six-inch water line throughout parts of Franklin,
Morris, and Titus counties (Figure 1) that includes 36.36 acres. The water line will
be on private property, and the pipe will be placed in a trench eighteen inches
wide and beneath three feet of cover. The trench will be within thirty feet of the
highway right-of-way and within a fifteen foot (4.573 m) working easement. In
those areas where the terrain and vegetation present problems putting the pipe
this distance from the road, it will be placed as close to the fence as possible.
Funding will be provided by the United States Department of Agriculture, Rural
Development. The field survey was conducted on October 1-5, 8-11, and
November 15, 2012. Because of the involvement of Rural Development, this
project falls under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966.
The proposed water line crosses several streams in the Big Cypress and
Sulphur River drainage basins in the East Texas Pineywoods. Named streams
in the project area include Boggy Creek, Cobb Jones Creek, Lewis Creek, and
Okry Creek. The photograph on the cover is Boggy Creek. The topography of
the project area includes upland ridges, toe slopes, terraces, and floodplains.
Elevations in the three counties range from 300-600 feet in Franklin County, 228598 feet in Morris County, and 300-462 feet in Titus County. Most of the
proposed water line improvements depicted on the Hagansport and Talco
quadrangles are located on what is known as the Daphne and Talco prairies.
These prairies are relatively flat in the uplands and dotted with continuous pimple
or prairie mounds. Most of the project area is in pasture and woods, but a few
areas include grass in the yards of residences that are regularly maintained. The
vegetation in the areas depicted on the Talco and Hagansport quadrangles is
primarily hardwood forests and occasional pines. The vegetation in the area
depicted on the Cookville and Naples quadrangles is composed of a mixture of
pine and hardwood forests. Soils in the area where sites were recorded consist
mainly of fine sandy loam over clay. Specific soil types can be found in the site
descriptions that were taken from the soil survey for Camp, Franklin, Morris, and
Titus counties (Roberts 1990). The footprint of the proposed water line passes
through three previously recorded prehistoric sites. They are 41MX62 and
41MX141 in Morris County and 41TT873 in Titus County. In addition, the water
line will pass near three dedicated cemeteries, a single grave on private property,
four houses greater than 45 years of age, a well, and two areas where houses
may have been present in 1908.
The project area is depicted on five 7.5’ USGS topographic quadrangles
(Appendix I). They are Cookville (3394-224), Hagansport (3395-142), Naples
(3394-213), Talco (3395-141), and Wilkinson (3394-232).

CULTURE SEQUENCE
Prehistoric Sequence
The project area is part of the Northeastern Region of Texas as defined by
the Office of the State Archeologist (Figure 2). According to a statistical overview
published by the THC (Biesaart et al. 1985), there were 2396 known sites in this
region that equated to 11.85% of the state total. Within this region, there were 60
known sites in Franklin County, 9 sites in Morris County, and 209 sites in Titus
County. Today there are 139 known sites in Franklin County, 142 known sites in
Morris County, and 918 known sites in Titus County. The increase is due to
construction projects and oil and gas production that require cultural resource
surveys at the state or federal level. At the time the overview was published, the
known sites were described as Paleo-Indian (n=5), Archaic (n=109), and Late
Prehistoric (n=167).
Native Americans first appeared in the Pineywoods region of East Texas
during the period referred to by archaeologists as Paleo-Indian. The first
inhabitants ranged through its forests, grasslands, broad floodplains, and
wetlands as mobile hunter-gatherers. There are various dates for the span of
time that can be attributed to the Paleo-Indian period. One of the leading
archaeologists in Texas was Dee Ann Story, and she (Story et al. 1990) states
that Paleo-Indians were active in this area from 9500 B.C. to 7000 B.C. Fields
and Tomka (1993:Table 2.3.2) provide a listing of sites in Northeast Texas that
may contain a Paleo-Indian component. They state that their data is skewed
because most sites in the table were from large-scale projects such as Jewett
Mine and Lake Limestone. According to Fields and Tomka (1993:72), isolable
Paleo-Indian components may be equally common in other parts of Northeast
Texas, but their discovery will require geologically oriented archeological
investigations focusing on site context and chronology. Their table lists 41FK35
as the only known site in the vicinity of the current project area that may have a
Paleo-Indian component. Unlike later sites with perishable materials and
numerous features, Paleo-Indian sites are usually almost solely represented by
lithic artifacts with many documented as surface finds.
The next period is referred to as the Archaic that lasted from 7000 B.C. to
200 B.C. (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993). Story et al. (1990:213) states that there
was a greater dependence on plant remains during the Archaic, and this
statement is based on the presence of milling stones and baking pits. There was
also a decrease over time in the size of their territories. Projectile points and
other stone tools were predominantly made from local materials, were more
“functionally varied,” and more “cheaply produced” (Story et al. 1990:213). As
with Paleo-Indian sites, the Archaic site database is also skewed, and Fields and
Tomka (1993:72) believe that isolable Archaic components may be equally
common in other parts of Northeast Texas as well.

Fields and Tomka (1993:Table 2.3.2) list six sites in the vicinity of the
current project area that may have isolable Archaic components. Three are in
Franklin County (41FK7, 41FK10, and 41FK35), and three are in Titus County
(41TT15, 41TT26, and 41TT95). Fields and Tomka (1993:70) state that the body
of useful information for Archaic sites in Northeast Texas is limited because
cultural materials are often mixed with later remains. Therefore, few discrete
components have been identified or investigated. These early sites have been
found on a variety of topographic and geomorphic settings such as alluvial
deposits along the major river valleys and their tributaries, colluvium in the
uplands above the valleys of rivers and streams, and deposits that may contain
mixed alluvial and colluvial components in intermediate topographic settings.
They also state that the uplands should not be ignored because colluvial and
possibly eolian processes appear to have played active roles in burying upland
sites in some parts of the region.
Following the Archaic, a sedentary lifestyle emerged. According to
Perttula et al. (1993:97), this time period in Northeast Texas is poorly understood
because research has not been directed towards this topic. They state that the
archaeological evidence available at the time suggests that sedentary settlement
systems were in place in Northeast Texas by at least A.D. 800. They believe that
the period from circa 500 B.C. to A.D. 1000 was a period of transition where
mobile hunters and gatherers began residing in one place for longer periods.
The extent of a sedentary lifestyle prior to the Caddo settlement in the area is not
known. Hallmarks of the change from the Archaic are the introduction of
ceramics and the bow and arrow, and the resulting period is commonly referred
to as Late Prehistoric or Early Ceramic (200 B.C. to A.D. 800). Two Early
Ceramic sites in the general vicinity of the current project area are 41TT2
(Goldschmidt 1935) and 41TT42 (East Texas State University 1971). Both are in
the Sulphur River drainage basin. This vibrant and sophisticated prehistoric
Caddo culture also developed in adjoining parts of northwestern Louisiana,
southwestern Arkansas, and southeastern Oklahoma. The prehistoric Caddo
were prosperous horticulturists and traders, lived in dispersed sedentary hamlets
and villages along well-watered streams, and were temple and burial mound
builders whose construction of earthen mounds served to mark the sacred
ceremonial and religious places of important priests and chiefs across the
cultural landscape (Story et al.1990; Schambach 1996). The use of cultigens also
played a major role in the development of a sedentary lifestyle. Story (1981)
divided the Caddo into the Formative Caddo, Early Caddo, Middle Caddo, and
Late Caddo periods. Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993:Appendix 2.5.1) list five sites
in Franklin County, one site in Morris County, and fourteen sites in Titus County
that date to the Formative, Early, and Middle Caddo periods. They (Kenmotsu
and Perttula 1993:Appendix 2.5.3) list thirteen sites in Franklin County, sixteen
sites in Morris County, and twenty-six sites in Titus County that date to the Late
Caddo period.

According to Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993:47), the final chronological
period is the period referred to as Historic Contact that dates after A.D. 1680.
The Caddo continued to live in parts of Northeast Texas until as late as the late
1830s. They lived near and interacting with the European and American
colonizers of their land until they moved to the Brazos River in the 1840s-1850s.
In 1859, they moved to Oklahoma (Smith 2005).
Historic Sequence
According to Simons and Hoyt (1992), there is evidence that Luis de
Moscoso Alvarado passed through or near what is now Franklin County in 1542
while leading the Moscoso Expedition. In 1719, Jean Baptiste Bernard de la
Harpe established the French fort Le Poste des Cadodaquious in what is now
Bowie County, and this is the first documented European contact in this part of
Texas (Weddle 1991). The fort was located near a Caddo village and named for
this tribe. Historic Indian tribes in the area included the Caddo who had inhabited
the area since prehistoric times and bands of Delaware, Kickapoo, and Shawnee
who migrated to the area in the 1820s. These intrusive groups did not stay long
as most of them had abandoned their settlements by sometime during the 1830s.
The Cherokee Indians are credited with creating a historic trail that traversed
East Texas and Northeast Texas circa 1821. Known as the Cherokee Trace, this
route was followed by Indians and early settlers. It crossed Big Cypress Creek
into what is now Titus County. The segment of Franklin County Road 2110 that
parallels the county boundary in the APE is a portion of the trace.
White settlement in this part of Texas began in the late 1830s. According
to Meining (1969:43), “the typical East Texan derived from the back country folk
of the Carolinas, and the pivot of his westward progression had been either
Alabama or Tennessee.” At the time, Jefferson was a major portal through which
most immigrants passed. The first settlers constructed log cabins and other
structures based on their cultural heritage and modified them, if necessary, to “fit
the physical and cultural setting of the new homeland” (Jordan 1978:4). Perhaps
the most common style of cabin in East Texas was the basic double-pen house,
also referred to as “dogtrot” or “dogrun.” Jordan (1978:119) states that this type
is most common in the eastern section of Texas that was settled by immigrants
from the Lower South. He (Jordan 1978:Figure 6-11) illustrates the double-pen
type of construction to be a major type in Titus County. An example of the
double-pen house in the project area is the Robert L. Talley house (see below).
According to Jordan (1978:99-103), there were three chimney types in East
Texas (brick, stone, and stick-and-dirt), and all three have been documented in
Titus County. Drury Blakeley Alexander (1966) provides a detailed discussion of
the methods of construction for double-pen cabins.

6

Titus County was created in 1846 and named for Andrew Jackson Titus, a
planter and Stage Legislator (Moore 1975). The new county was taken from
Bowie County. As the area grew, the need for more local centers of government
became apparent. Franklin and Morris counties were created and organized in
1875 on land that was taken from Titus County (Moore 1975). These new
counties were named for Benjamin C. Franklin (early settler) and William Wright
Morris (planter and stage Legislator).
During the early days of settlement, lack of adequate transportation was
the most important factor that inhibited growth. The early settlers relied mainly
on subsistence agriculture until the arrival of the railroad in 1876 that made it
possible for most farmers to have access to markets for their goods. In 1909, the
Paris and Mount Pleasant Railroad was chartered by the citizens of Paris. The
first segment connected Paris and Bogata (24.06 miles) and began operations in
1910. In 1913, it was expanded to include service from Bogata to Mount
Pleasant (27.26 miles). The company was sold to the Texas Power and Light
Company in 1952 and abandoned in 1956. The railroad passed through Talco,
and part of this route crossed the project area near the intersection of CR 1828
and FM 71 in the City of Talco. The first farmers brought their produce and other
goods to market in wagons on roads that were often impassible in bad weather.
In 1937, the first Farm-to-Market road in Texas was completed, and this signaled
the beginning of a three-year pilot program for the construction of 7205 miles of
Farm-to-Market roads with the cost to be shared equally by the stage and federal
governments. The creation of these roads greatly improved the ability of farmers
to sell their products. Three such roads constructed in the general area are FM
71 in Franklin County, FM 144 in Morris County, and FM 1896 in Titus County.
Cotton was the main cash crop, and corn was the main food crop. Other
changes to the overall economy were the discovery of oil near Talco in 1936;
other mineral resources such as ceramic clay, lignite coal, industrial sand, and
gas; livestock and timber production; industry; and recreation. Much of the
agriculture was made possible by the use of tenant farmers who constituted a
large percentage of the labor. In Titus County, for example, sixty-one percent of
the farmers in 1930 were tenants. By 1969, this number was less than seven
percent because of a reduction in staple crop agriculture. Today, the three
counties have stable economies that rely mainly on minerals (lignite coal, oil, and
gas), agriculture, and recreation.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Literature Review
One of the early archaeologists who played a major role in identifying and
recording sites in Northeast Texas was A. T. Jackson. During the 1920s and
1930s he was the Archeologist in Charge under J. E. Pearce at The University of
Texas at Austin. He worked with Dr. J. Gilbert McAllister, Director of Research,
during the late 1930s for the WPA and University of Texas at Austin, and he
continued to work in Texas archeology with the university in the 1940s. Jackson
documented numerous sites in the area, and he reported his many of his findings
in the Bulletin of the Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society (Jackson
1933, 1934, 1935, 1936). His papers are on file at The Center for American
History (formerly the Barker Texas History Center) at The University of Texas at
Austin.
There are several overviews and statistical studies that are relevant to this
project. The first major overview of East Texas was compiled by Suhm, Krieger,
and Jelks (1954) in their monumental Volume 24 of the Bulletin of the Texas
Archeological and Paleontological Society. In this volume, they presented the
current information for East Texas, mentioned significant sites, and discussed the
Titus Focus that is centered on sites in the valleys of the Upper Sulphur and
Upper Sabine rivers and major streams such as Big and Little Cypress creeks.
They state that the “heart of the area lies in Titus, Franklin, Morris, Camp, and
Upshur counties.” Their work provided archaeologists with data that has been
the basis for future work, and the Titus Focus is still recognized as a viable
temporal period for Caddo sites in Northeast Texas. Story (1981) also published
an overview of East Texas prehistory in Plains Anthropologist.
Lynne A. Biesaart, Wayne R. Roberson, and Lisa Clinton Spotts (1985)
conducted a statistical overview of prehistoric sites in Texas that provided the
first systematic study of data by site, county, and region. Although sites are not
linked to trinomials, this study provides a window into the status of Texas
prehistory in 1985.
The next major source for the area is a planning document prepared by
the Texas Historical Commission (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993) designed to
“carry out preservation planning for archeological sites in the eastern area of the
state.” It identifies threats to cultural resources, planning goals, the sequence of
cultural periods from Paleo-Indian to Historic times, and lists of significant sites in
the area.

William A. Martin (1990) compiled the first comprehensive bibliography for
he Northeastern Region of Texas. Although bibliographies only contain sources
for a specific time period, they are a valuable source for all work to that date. In
addition to the bibliography, Martin includes a county and regional index, index of
key words in titles, selected ethnohistorical and historical bibliographies, list of
county histories and soil surveys, and a discussion of early investigations.
The most recent overview of Northeast Texas and Caddo archaeology
appears in The Prehistory of Texas by Timothy K. Perttula (2004b). In this
volume, two chapters are relevant. They are “The Archeology of the Post Oak
Savannah of East-Central Texas” (Fields 2004) and “The Prehistoric and
Caddoan Archeology of the Northeast Texas Pineywoods” (Perttula 2004a).
Timothy K. Perttula and Bo Nelson (2012) documented 347 Caddo
vessels in a private collection that were taken from sites in Camp and Titus
counties. The majority of specimens were from the Tuck Carpenter site (41CP5),
Shelby Mound (41CP71), and Tankersley Creek (41TT18). The ability to
examine this extensive collection has added valuable information to the database
for ceramics in Northeast Texas.
There are numerous contract reports and articles in journals that contain
useful information regarding the current project area, and many of these can be
found on the Archeological Sites Atlas.
Previous Investigations in Morris County
There are two previously recorded sites in Morris County that are within
the boundaries of the APE. They are 41MX62 and 41MX141.
Site 41MX62 is depicted on the Atlas as being on the east and west sides
of US Highway 259. Michael G. Turner, who was a member of the Texas
Archeological Stewardship Network at the time, reported this site to the
archaeological community in 1973 (TARL site files). He stated that artifacts had
been found on the east side of the highway in a cultivated field and on the west
side of the highway in a private rodeo arena. Materials reported as having been
collected from this site by collectors include pottery vessels and sherds, dart points,
Maud arrow points, flint flakes, and human teeth and bone fragments. Turner
visited the site several times and collected dart points, grinding stones, and lithic
debitage. The dart points included one San Patrice and Early and Late Archaic
types. No arrow points or ceramics were observed. He only investigated the
west side of the highway where there was good surface visibility, but he believes
that the site extends to the other side of the road and occupies a much greater
area in all directions.

9

Milton Bell visited the site prior to highway improvements by the Highway
Department in September of 1973. Bell’s methods are not stated on the site form,
and no formal report was available. These kinds of investigations by the Highway
Department are typically documented in an in-house letter report that is not at
TARL. Bell describes the site as a “cemetery and earlier camp” and dates it to the
“Caddoan to Archaic” periods.
Site 41MX141 was investigated by Prewitt & Associates, Inc. during a
survey of a bridge and relief structure replacement location (Gadus 1999). Five
backhoe trenches were excavated on the east and west banks of the main
channel of Boggy Creek on the north side of FM 144, and two shovel tests were
dug adjacent to the trenches to confirm that the absence of artifacts was not the
result of poor examination of the backdirt. Two additional shovel tests were
excavated on the upland landform at the east end of the project area. No cultural
materials or features were observed, and construction was allowed to begin.
In April of 2006, TxDOT received a report that artifacts had been
discovered during construction. The project was halted and Geo-Marine, Inc.
was called to confirm the presence of cultural materials. The area was
investigated using a non-controlled surface inspection and shovel testing. One
small chert flake was found on the scraped surface and one flake was found in
each of the three shovel tests. The area was recorded at TARL as 41MX141.
They observed that the portion of the site within the highway right-of-way had
been destroyed by mechanical scraping, and no further work was recommended
for the site area within the right-of-way. The recorders stated on the site form that
intact deposits might be present on private property to the east. This
investigation is documented in an interim report on file at Geo-Marine, Inc. in
Plano, Texas.
Previous Investigations in Titus County
There are four previously recorded sites in Titus County in close proximity
to the path of the proposed water line (41TT100, 41TT101, 41TT873, and
41TT875). Site 41TT873 is the only one within the APE.
One of the early investigations in Titus County was carried out under the
supervision of Walter R. Goldschmidt (1935) for The University of Texas at
Austin. They investigated village sites with burials and mounds in the vicinity of
Mount Pleasant. His report discusses two separate phases of East Texas
culture. According to Goldschimidt (1935:97), the Farrar culture is “poor in
pottery and shows inferior technique in ceramic and stone artifact manufacture,”
while the other has a “relatively high grade of pottery and stone work, and is rich
in amount as well as quality of materials found in burials.”

10

The Farrar culture was defined on the basis of only two sites, while the
latter is “a representative of a more widespread group extending to the southeast
and into the Sabine River Valley.” At the time of his excavations, it was not
known if the mounds could be attributed to the Caddo, although he believes it is
probable.
In 1975, Milton Bell visited two areas within the right-of-way of US
Highway 271 in Titus County where artifacts have been found during the early
phases of highway construction. This visit resulted in the recording of sites
41TT100 and 41TT101. Artifacts observed at the two sites consisted of plain
ceramic sherds and flakes. According to the site form, the soil at 41TT100 was
sandy loam over shallow red clay. The recommendation was that this site be
tested to determine its limits. The artifacts observed at site 41TT101 were found
on the western slope of a high hill, and Bell believes that the main site area is
probably on the hill that is outside of the right-of-way. No formal report was
written, and no further investigations were recommended
In 2006, archaeologists from PBS&J (Maynard et al. 2009) conducted an
intensive archaeological survey for a TxDOT bridge replacement and roadway
widening project. The area involved the right-of-way of US Highway 271 that
extended from 2.11 miles north of FM 1896 to 1.83 miles south of FM 896. This
study involved a pedestrian survey and geo-archaeological investigations of the
floodplains of White Oak Creek and Ripley Creek. Four previously recorded sites
(41TT100, 41TT101, 41TT102, and 41TT103) were relocated, and five new sites
(41TT872, 41TT873, 41TT874, 41TT875, and 41TT876) were recorded. All of
the sites recorded and visited are located in the uplands or upland margins
overlooking the bottomlands along White Oak Creek, Ripley Creek, and Johnson
Branch. The authors state that the lack of sites in the floodplain areas along the
creeks are probably due to a lack of identifiable rises such as pimple mounds
and a buried floodplain surface. No buried sites were found in the floodplain of
Ripley Creek, but permission to use a backhoe in the floodplain of White Oak
Creek was not granted. Ceramics were only found at one site. No artifacts were
collected.
Site 41TT100 was subjected to a controlled surface inspection consisting
of three transects at intervals of approximately 30 m and 22 shovel tests
excavated at intervals of 20 m. Not one of the shovel tests produced artifacts.
The only cultural materials observed were two chert flakes and one quartzite
flake on the surface. This site was determined to be not significant, and no
further work was recommended.

11

Site 41TT101 was subjected to a controlled surface collection, and 34
shovel tests excavated at intervals of 10 m. Artifacts included chert flakes,
quartzite flakes, whiteware, transfer ware, baked clay, brown glass, crockery,
bone, and metal wire. The recorders state that this site has the potential for
“significant data resources,” but they do not make any recommendations for
further work.
Site 41TT873 was recorded as a prehistoric site based on the presence of
lithic debitage and no diagnostics. The site was subjected to a controlled surface
inspection (intervals not mentioned on the site form) and eight shovel tests were
excavated, two of which were positive. The only artifacts observed consisted of
one chert flake and one quartzite flake found at 10-20 cm below the surface in
two shovel tests. The recorders state that this site probably extends to the west
side of US 271. They believe that it has “limited potential to harbor significant
data resources,” and no further investigation was recommended.
Site 41TT875 was recorded as a prehistoric site based on the presence of
three flakes and one burin. The site was subjected to a controlled surface
inspection and ten shovel tests at intervals of 10 m. Ten tests were excavated,
and the artifacts were found at 30 to 60 cm below the surface. At the time of the
survey, the site was on a small rise in a densely wooded area about 900 m north
of Johnson Branch. Its size is approximately 15 m north south by 20 m east west.
The recorders state on the site form that this site has “limited potential to harbor
significant data resources,” and no further investigation was recommended.
Archaeologists from Geo-Marine, Inc. (Allday and Bastis 2008) were
unable to locate sites 41TT100 and 41TT101 during an archeological impact
evaluation in the TxDOT Atlanta District. They found the areas where the sites
had been recorded in the highway right-of-way to be completely void of cultural
materials due to road construction and maintenance.
Regional Investigations
Most of our early knowledge of Northeast Texas prehistory was obtained
as a result of reservoir projects during the early days of salvage archaeology.
Virtually all of the major reservoirs were investigated, and Southern Methodist
University was a major participant. Those nearest the current project area are
Lake Bob Sandlin in Camp, Franklin, Titus, and Wood counties (Sullivan n.d.),
Lake Monticello in Titus County (McCormick 1973), Lake Swauano in Titus
County (McCormick n.d.a), and Welsh Reservoir in Titus County (Cliff et al.
1974). These surveys documented numerous sites and provided the
archaeological community with the first systematic data of prehistoric and historic
utilization of this part of Texas.

12

Some of these surveys were followed by testing of sites believed to be
significant. At Lake Monticello, a botanical survey was conducted and several
sites were tested. According to Mahler (1973:1), the botanical survey was
designed to evaluate the endemic flora from a perspective of “re-establishing a
natural environment” following mining operations at a lignite mining area and
testing at the six sites “filled in some gaps in our knowledge concerning the
prehistory of this area in east Texas as well as testing our economic and
settlement hypotheses.”
Two significant Caddo sites were identified during pre-construction
planning for SH 49 (Bell 1981) and FM 3417 (Young 1981). The Alex Justiss site
(41TT13) is a Caddo cemetery on Swauano Creek. Testing at this site revealed
the presence of what Bell describes as a typical Titus Focus cemetery that dates
to the Late Caddo IV period (Bell 1981:iii). Test excavations at the Tankersley
Creek site (41TT108) revealed a multi-component site that was occupied during
the Early LaHarpe Aspect to Caddo IV times (Young 1981:iii). According to
Young, the major significance of this site was that it increased the database for
Archaic components in this area. The Archaic component represents one of the
few Archaic sites that was occupied at a time when the Gary point was not in
use, and the Caddo I component represents one of the few non-ceremonial sites
of this period to be examined. Young believes that the evidence obtained from
41TT108 indicates that the Caddo I period began before the introduction of the
bow and arrow.
Archaeologists from Texas A&M University analyzed and interpreted
archaeological materials from 41MX5 in Morris County in1987 that had been
excavated by TxDOT personnel (Brewington et al. 1995). They describe this site
as a Caddo farming hamlet that was occupied for a brief time between A.D. 1300
and A.D. 1500. At one time, there were probably two or three structures, and
human remains were found associated with each one. In addition to the Caddo
component, a small amount of Middle and Late Archaic artifacts were recovered.
The deposits at this site were shallow (less than 50 cm) and greatly disturbed by
natural and human agents. According to the authors (Brewington et al. 1995:iii),
this report “demonstrates that with appropriate methods, such shallow disturbed
sites can yield significant insights into Caddoan lifeways.”
There have been numerous culture resource investigations in the three
counties, but it is beyond the scope of this project to attempt to name them all.
The interested researcher can find this information on the Atlas and some of the
sources mentioned above.

13

METHODS
The purpose of this survey was to identify all cultural resources within the
path of the proposed water line and make a determination as to which ones need to
be avoided because they have research potential. Prior to the field survey, archival
research was conducted that included checking the site records at TARL and
reviewing the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas for the presence of previously
recorded sites and prior surveys and projects in the project area and vicinity.
Relevant archaeological reports documenting work in the three counties and
historic maps were reviewed, and the project was discussed with archaeologists
who have experience in the area and local historians. B. F. Hicks is a local
historian who shared his knowledge of cemeteries and the Cherokee Trace.
In 1952, Arthur Newell Strahler proposed a hierarchy of streams as a way
to define the size of perennial streams that contain water continuously throughout
the year and recurring streams that contain water only part of the year. Stream
sizes range from first order to twelfth order. A first order stream is the smallest
of the world's streams and consists of small tributaries. These are the streams
that flow into and feed larger streams but do not normally have any water flowing
into them. First through third order streams are also called headwater streams
and constitute any waterways in the upper reaches of the watershed. Streams
that are classified as fourth through sixth order are medium streams while
anything larger is considered a river.
Although most stream crossings were investigated, it is the opinion of the
Principal Investigator that prehistoric sites in the APE are most likely to be found on
hills and terraces adjacent to medium streams (forth through sixth orders). All
stream crossings were visually inspected, and shovel tests were dug at most of
these. The only area where shovel tests were not excavated at stream crossings
was a segment of the water line depicted on the Wilkinson topographic quadrangle
(Appendix I, Map 6) and referred to as Area A in this report. The south bank of
White Oak Creek is a floodplain. At the beginning of this segment, four shovel tests
were dug, and the sandy mantle turned to clay at a maximum depth of 60 cm. The
last two tests encountered clay at 10 cm. Therefore, it was decided that the rest of
the area south of the creek could be evaluated with shovel probes. Probes were
dug, and they confirmed the shallow nature of the soil in this area. The creek at this
point is shallow, and backhoe trenching was not considered necessary.
The north bank was not shovel tested because shovel probes revealed
shallow soils with clay at or near the surface (within 10 cm). On the topographic
quadrangle, it appears that there is high ground overlooking the creek, but this was
not the case. The landform in this area is flat and featureless. Previously recorded
prehistoric site 41TT70 was clearly visible to the south and east of this area on a
prominent landform rising above the lower area within the APE. The topography
from this site to the APE is flat and contains shallow soils.

14

The road makes a right angle turn to the east and crosses the creek. At the
point where the road turns, clay was visually observed at or near the surface in
areas that had been disturbed through cultivation. The next high probability area is
at the point where the road turns to the north. Four shovel tests were dug, and
each one was negative. The first three tests encountered clay at a maximum depth
of 50 cm, and the fourth test was only dug to 20 cm. The next subsurface
examination was a shovel probe and it appeared that the soil was becoming
shallower in this area. Therefore, shovel probes were used to evaluate the APE
until deeper soils were found. Past this point, the creek decreases in size and
resembles a first or second order stream before ending beyond the northern portion
of Area A. Much of this area had been disturbed through agricultural activities, and
surface visibility was excellent in some areas. Shovel probes are an effective
method of testing the soil. They are not screened and assigned individual numbers.
If a probe encounters sandy soil, it is continued and recorded as a shovel test.
Area B (Appendix I, Map 6) is also depicted on the Wilkinson topographic
quadrangle. There are no major stream crossings and most of the area is flat and
low lying with a significant portion in marsh. During the reconnaissance prior to the
survey, this segment was considered to be a low probability area. What appears to
be a stream on the topographic quadrangle is a gully caused by erosion and runoff.
The two high points depicted on the topographic quadrangle were probed with a
shovel and found to contain clay at or near the surface, usually less than 20 cm.
What appears to be a stream on the topographic quadrangle is a gully caused by
erosion and runoff.
As stated above, shovel tests were excavated at stream crossings and all
high probability areas that were identified in the field. Areas where soil was
exposed due to erosion, animal burrows, and construction were visually examined
for exposed and displaced cultural materials and historic features such as wells,
cisterns, and foundations. The normal shovel test interval was 20 m, but the
distance between tests varied in some areas according to the landform. Each test
was 35 cm x 35 cm in size. The majority of tests were dug to clay, but a few tests
were terminated when the water table was reached. The excavated soil was
screened using quarter-inch hardware cloth. Each test was recorded on a shovel
test log. In all, 315 shovel tests were excavated. Appendix II documents the tests
that were dug at the sites, and Appendix III documents the negative tests that were
dug in areas where no sites were found. It is BVRA policy not to name sites except
in special circumstances.
The survey was restricted to the fifteen foot working easement on private
property. Therefore, site boundaries were determined by negative shovel tests on
each end of the long axis or natural barriers such as streams rather than the four
cardinal directions that would be the case in an APE that was not as limited in size.
It is difficult to estimate the size of a site when only a portion of it is examined. The
site sizes in this report refer to the distance between positive tests within the
easement. All artifacts recovered in the tests were collected for analysis.

15

Since the water line will be in a trench that will not exceed three feet in
depth, backhoe trenching was not necessary. Each recorded site is depicted on a
topographic quadrangle, and this information can be found in Appendix IV.
Previously recorded sites 41MX62 and 41MX141 were visually inspected,
and the subsurface was examined through shovel testing. As with the other
previously recorded sites, shovel tests were confined to the 15-foot working
easement.
Twelve shovel tests were dug at site 41MX62, and seven were positive. The
tests were dug in sandy loam and terminated when clay was encountered. Artifacts
were found from Level 1 (0-10 cm) to 80 cm and consist of twelve flakes, a Gary
point, and biface fragment. The lithic debitage was identified as predominantly
interior flakes of quartzite and silicified wood; but two were made from novaculite.
In addition to shovel tests, the area was subjected to a surface inspection. The site
is on a terrace with several natural rises. The area investigated represents only a
small portion of the site, as the tests were dug on the western edge of the landform.
Fourteen shovel tests were excavated at site 41MX141, and eleven were
positive. The tests were dug in sandy loam and terminated when clay was
encountered. Artifacts were found from Level 1 (0-10 cm) to 86 cm) and include
ten flakes, a Yarbrough point and a biface fragment. The lithic debitage was
identified as predominantly interior flakes of quartzite; but two were made from
Jasper. Quartzite and Jasper were locally obtained. In addition to shovel tests, the
area was subjected to a surface inspection.
The water line will pass through the western edge of the area depicted on
the site map as 41TT100. Since this has been extensively shovel tested with
negative results, no additional work was conducted during this study. The most
recent site form refers to this site as having “no potential to harbor significant data
resources.” The area recorded as site 41TT100 is not eligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places.
Site 41TT101 is at least 10 m east of the APE. Thirty-four shovel tests were
dug in the site area, and prehistoric and historic artifacts were recovered. This site
is described on the site form as having “potential to harbor significant data
resources.” Since this site is not in the APE, shovel testing was not necessary.
At the time of this investigation, the water line along US 271 was to be
placed in the highway right-of-way. Later, the decision was made to place the
water line on private property. The water line will be placed within the center of the
15-foot working easement that is adjacent to the 60-foot highway right-of-way.
When this change was announced, it was discovered that site 41TT873 is within
the APE. The sites in this area are discussed below.

16

41TT873 is within the APE. Eight shovel tests at this site only recovered two
possible flakes, and boundaries had been established in three directions by two
negative tests. Since it was not possible to excavate tests outside of the APE,
additional shovel tests were not necessary. The most recent site form refers to this
site as having “limited potential to harbor significant data resources.”
Site 41TT875 is at least 10 m west of one of the two positive shovel tests.
Ten shovel tests at this site only recovered two possible flakes, and boundaries had
been established in all directions by negative tests. Therefore, additional shovel
tests were not necessary. The most recent site form refers to this site as having
“limited potential to harbor significant data resources.”
At the time the Principal Investigator assessed previously recorded sites in
Titus County, he was not sure if shovel tests had been excavated in a portion of site
41TT922. Therefore, six tests were dug and two flakes were recovered. This
information does not change the research potential of this site in the APE.
All standing structures greater than 45 years of age within 100 feet of the
APE were photographed and described. When possible, the original owner and
age of each structure was identified. Two structures that may have been in the APE
in 1908 were identified, and their location is depicted on topographic quadrangles in
Appendix IV. The structures are no longer standing, and there are no significant
cultural features associated with these sites within the APE, and the location of
these structures on the map is not exact.
Archaeologists working for Prewitt & Associates, Inc. excavated backhoe
trenches and shovel tests in the floodplain of Boggy Creek below site 41MX141
(Gaddus 1999). When archaeologists from Geo-Marine, Inc. conducted an
investigation in the White Oak floodplain at site 41TT922 (Allday and Bastis 2008),
they did not have landowner permission to investigate certain areas. BVRA dug
two shovel tests in one of these areas during the current study. Photographs were
taken at each site.
Since the images of the prehistoric sites typically only depict the landform
and vegetation present, a representative sample of photos are presented in this
report. All site photos have been saved on archival paper and are part of the
records curated at TARL. All features at the historic sites were photographed, and
each image is included in this report. The artifacts were washed, analyzed, and
catalogued in the laboratory. Timothy K. Perttula examined and described the
ceramics (Appendix V), and William A. Dickens analyzed the lithics (Appendix VI).
Jay Robinson photographed the projectile points, and Lili G. Lyddon prepared the
figures and edited the report. Site maps were drafted, and they can be found in
Appendix VII. The Principal Investigator is the sole author of this report and is
responsible for its content. This survey was conducted in accordance with the
Minimum Survey Standards as outlined by the THC. The 320 shovel tests in a 20mile area resulted in an average of 16 tests per mile.

41FK140
This multi-component site is depicted on the 7.5’ Hagansport topographic
quadrangle (Appendix IV). It is on a large north-facing toe slope at an elevation
ranging from 350 to 360 feet AMSL (Appendix VII). The soil in the site area is
Woodtell fine sandy loam, 5 to 20 percent slopes (WoE). The site area is covered in
chest high weeds and small hardwood and cedar trees growing along the fence at
the edge of a recently planted pine plantation tree farm. The landform overlooks
Cobb Jones Creek about 30 m to the north in the Sulphur River drainage basin.
Disturbances to the site area include a fire lane adjacent to the fence that was
created over the existing Tri Special Utility District water line. Seven shovel tests
were excavated in the site area, and four were positive. Clay was encountered in
all of the shovel tests at depths of 24 cm to 31 cm. The prehistoric component
consists of four flakes in shovel tests and a tested cobble on the surface. The age
and function of this component is not known. The historic component consists of a
stoneware ceramic base sherd observed on the surface and a stoneware sherd
and shotgun shell casing found in shovel tests. This is a shallow site with all
artifacts found between the surface and 20 cm. Its linear distance is estimated at
61 m, and its overall size is about 279 square meters. The site is bounded on the
north by the creek and on the south by two negative tests. The portion of site
41FK140 located within the project area APE is not eligible for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places. The temporary number assigned to this site was FK-F.
41FK141
This unknown prehistoric site is depicted on the Hagansport topographic
quadrangle (Appendix IV). At the time of this survey it was in manicured pasture on
the edge of a terrace ranging in elevation from 340 to 350 feet AMSL. The site is
bounded on the south by a relief channel of Cobb Jones Creek in the Sulphur River
drainage basin, and the northern boundary was established by three negative
shovel tests (Appendix VII). Disturbance to the site included recent feral hog
activities and an existing Tri Special Utility District water line. Nine shovel tests
were excavated in Woodtell fine sandy loam, 5 to 20 percent slopes (WoE). Clay
was encountered in all of the shovel tests in the site area at depths that varied from
17 cm to 73 cm. Seven tests were positive, and they yielded eight quartzite flakes
at depths of 20 cm to 60 cm. The linear distance of this site is estimated at 122 m,
and its overall size is about 558 square meters. The portion of site 41FK141 located
within the project area APE is not eligible for listing in the National Register of
Historic Places. The temporary number assigned to this site was FK-G.

This unknown prehistoric site is depicted on the 7.5’ Hagansport topographic
quadrangle (Appendix IV). At the time of this survey, it was in pasture on a terrace
at 320 feet AMSL about 20 m north of a relief channel of Lewis Creek in the
Sulphur River drainage basin (Appendix VII). Shallow ruts were observed in the
cutbank of the relief channel, and these may represent older routes of CR 2110 that
parallel and cross the site. Additional disturbance includes a Tri Special Utility
District water line a couple of meters from the private property fence. Eight shovel
tests were excavated in Woodtell fine sandy loam, 5 to 20 percent slopes (WoE).
Clay was encountered in all of the shovel tests in the site area. Three of the shovel
tests were positive and contained three quartzite flakes and a metate made of
ferruginous stone (Appendix VI). This is a shallow site with all artifacts found from
the surface to 33 cm. Its linear distance is estimated at 30 m, and its overall size is
137 square meters. The northern boundary was determined by five negative tests,
and the creek forms the southern limits of this site. The portion of site 41FK142
located within the project area APE is not eligible for listing in the National Register
of Historic Places. The temporary number assigned to this site was FK-H.
41FK143
This historic site is depicted on the 7.5’ Hagansport topographic quadrangle
(Appendix IV). It is on the edge of a toe slope at an elevation of 335 feet AMSL. At
the time of this survey, it was in pasture with a single large oak tree along the fence.
Lewis Creek is located about 200 m to the south (Appendix VII). Disturbances to
this site are from construction activities related to the county road and a Tri Special
Utility District power line. This site was identified when a metal strap fragment,
whiteware sherds, stoneware sherd, and bottle fragment were observed on the
surface. Five shovel tests were excavated in Freestone fine sandy loam, 1 to 3
percent slopes (FrB). Clay was encountered in all of the shovel tests in the site
area with depths of 10 cm to 16 cm below the surface. Three tests were positive,
and they yielded two whiteware sherds, a stoneware sherd, and a piece of purple
glass. The artifacts may be associated with a nearby tenant house. This is a
shallow site with all artifacts found between the surface and 15 cm. Its linear
distance is estimated at 20 m, and its overall size is about 91 square meters. The
northern boundary of this site was determined by three negative tests, and the
southern boundary is the intersection of county roads 2110 and 1820. The
landowners stated the property has been in their family since the late 19th century,
and tenants lived in the house and assisted in cultivation activities during the
depression. The portion of site 41FK143 located within the project area APE is not
eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. The temporary number

41FK144
This multi-component site is depicted on the 7.5’ Hagansport topographic
quadrangle (Appendix IV). The landform is a southwest facing finger slope at an
elevation of 340 feet AMSL (Appendix VII). There are two small tributaries of
Lewis Creek on either side of the finger slope. At the time of this survey it was in
pasture with scattered mature pecan trees and assorted hardwood trees growing
along the fence (Figure 3). This site has been disturbed by the county road,
gravel entrance road, fence, and a Tri Special Utility District water line; and these
disturbances have caused erosion in some areas. The site probably extends to
the northeast and southwest along the finger slope. The site was identified when
lithic debris and Caddo sherds were observed on the surface within the APE.
Eleven shovel tests were excavated in the Woodtell-Raino complex, 1 to 3
percent slopes (WrB). Clay was encountered in each test between 11 and 30 cm.
Five tests were positive, and they contained nine pieces of quartzite lithic debris,
five ceramic sherds, and historic artifacts consisting of glass and metal. This is a
shallow site with all artifacts found between the surface and 20 cm. Its linear
distance is estimated at 74 m, and its overall size is about 338 square meters.
Two negative tests were dug between the creek that forms the eastern boundary
and the site. Four negative tests were dug to the west and north. The prehistoric
artifacts may relate to a nearby Caddo farmstead, while the historic artifacts may
be associated with structures shown on the 1963 topographic map. The map
depicts the structures about 140 m to the southwest, but they are no longer
standing. The landowners stated they have located lithic debris, dart points, and
Caddo ceramics to the southwest of the site near the tip of the finger slope. The
portion of site 41FK144 located within the project area APE is not eligible for
listing in the National Register of Historic Places. The temporary number
assigned to this site was FK-J.

Locality 1
The Murphree family cemetery (FK-C019) is depicted on the 7.5’
Hagansport topographic quadrangle (Appendix IV) and referred to on that map
as the Murphy Cemetery. It is located on a hill on the south side of CR 2110 that
parallels its northern boundary (Figure 4). This is a small family cemetery with
about twenty-five graves that contain the remains of members of the Murphree,
Goode, and Price families. The oldest grave contains the remains of Lillie Mae
Murphree who died in 1904. The graves are marked with carved headstones,
ferrous rocks (Figure 5), and bricks (Figure 6). In Terry Jordan’s (1988:43)
excellent treatise on Texas graveyards, he states that ferrous sandstone is the
most common type found in Texas cemeteries. When cast iron stoves replaced
chimneys in the latter part of the 19th century, bricks from these chimneys were
used as grave markers (Jordan 1988:48). They were placed upright at the head
and foot of the grave and were often used as footstones when the more elaborate
headstones were available. According to local historian B. F. Hicks, CR 2110
was originally a wagon road from the community of Lake Chapel to Midway. The
hill was not altered for the construction of this road or the later creation of the
county road. Since graves are typically six feet deep, it is highly unlikely that any
are within the existing right-of-way. Mr. Hicks is one of the local authorities on
cemeteries in Franklin County, and it is opinion that no unmarked graves are
present in the road right-of-way. B. F. Hicks and Doris Meek (1972) discuss this
cemetery in their book about cemeteries of Franklin County. In addition, there is
an existing water line in the highway right-of-way below the cemetery. The
distance from the top of the hill to the road is approximately 50 feet.

The Smith family cemetery (FK-C0-20) is depicted on the 7.5’ Hagansport
topographic quadrangle (Appendix IV). It is located on the north side of CR 2110.
The earliest marked grave is for Mary E. Smith who died in 1891. This cemetery is
in thick woods, and only three graves were visible when Hicks and Meek visited it.
According to them (Hicks and Meek 1972), it is a “lost cemetery in the woods” that
is about one-fourth mile north of the Murphree Cemetery. It will not be affected by
the water line as currently proposed.
Locality 3
This recent burial is depicted on the 7.5’ Hagansport topographic quadrangle
(Appendix IV). It is located on the north side of CR 2110 (Figure 7). It is on private
property and not part of a dedicated cemetery. According to Mr. Hicks, the practice
of burying family members on private property is becoming more common. This
grave is 25 feet from the APE. It will not be affected by the water line as currently
proposed.

This prehistoric site is depicted on the 7.5’ Naples topographic quadrangle
(Appendix IV). The history of earlier work at this site is discussed in the Previous
Investigations section above. The site is on the south side of Okry Creek in the
Sulphur River drainage basin, and it is on a terrace with several small rises at an
elevation of 340 feet AMSL (Figure 8). The soil in the site area is Kullit very fine
sandy loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes (KtB). Twelve shovel tests were excavated in the
APE, and seven were positive. Cultural materials were found at 0-80 cm. The
boundaries were established by two negative tests to the north and three negative
tests to the south. Its linear distance is estimated at 130 m and its overall size is
about 594.5 square meters. Disturbance to this site has been caused by
construction and expansion of the highway, the fence that separates the highway
right-of-way from private property, agricultural activities, and erosion.

Artifacts recovered include twelve flakes, one Gary point, and one medial
segment of a biface. The majority of the artifacts consist of medium to fine
grained quartzite, a material commonly found in East Texas sites. Other raw
materials include chert and novaculite. Novaculite is a non-local material that
occurs naturally in Arkansas, and its presence at this site suggests trade and
interaction with groups in areas outside of Texas. The age of this site cannot be
accurately stated based on the finding of one diagnostic artifact. Suhm et al.
(1954:430) date Gary points to sometime between 2000 B.C. and A.D. 1000 and
possibly as late as A.D. 1500 to A.D. 1600, while Turner and Hester (1985:101)
describe it as Middle to Transitional Archaic (circa 2500 B.C. to A.D. 700 to 800).
At site 41WA55 in Walker County a small point was found that has the classic
Gary shape but is not much larger than some arrow points. Perhaps this
represents the transition from dart points to arrow points. This is consistent with
the statement by Ford and Webb (1956) that there is evidence that this type
became smaller in size in more recent times. Bell (1958) says that Gary points
are common throughout the Caddoan area and are most often found at preGibson Aspect sites. Therefore, the presence of a Gary point at a site in a
known Caddo area is not surprising. The original recorder of this site reported
finding a San Patrice point and no pottery. If this is true, site 41MX62 may have
a Paleo-Indian component that dates to circa 7500 B.C. based on estimates for
the San Patrice type by Turner et al. (2011:158-159). The apparent absence of
pottery and arrow points suggests that 41MX62 may be a single component
Archaic site. The Gary point and biface fragment are described and illustrated in
Appendix VI, and a map of this site is in Appendix VII. The eligibility of that
portion of site 41MX62 located within the project area APE for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places is undetermined, and avoidance or
significance testing is recommended.
41MX141
This prehistoric site is depicted on the 7.5’ Cookville topographic
quadrangle (Appendix IV). The history of earlier work at this site is discussed in
the Previous Investigations section above. The site is on the east side of Boggy
Creek in the Big Cypress Creek drainage basin, and it is on a small rise on the
floodplain at an elevation of 320 feet to 340 feet AMSL (Figure 9). At the time
this site was visited for the current survey, the site was in pasture. Disturbance to
this site has been caused by construction and expansion of the road, the fence
that separates the road right-of-way from private property, agricultural activities,
an existing Tri Special Utilitiy District water line, a Bowie-Cass Electric
Cooperative, Inc. overhead electric power line, and erosion. The soil in the site
area is Lilbert loamy fine sand, 2 to 5 percent slopes (LbC). Seventeen shovel
tests were excavated in the APE, and eleven were positive. Clay was
encountered at each test at depths from 26 cm to 63 cm. Cultural materials were
found at depths of 20 cm to 40 cm, and it appears that most of the site area is
uniform in terms of depth.

26

Figure 9. Site 41MX141 (facing west)
Of the eleven positive tests, only two yielded artifacts other than debitage,
and they were found between 20 and 40 cm. The boundaries were established
by one negative test and the creek to the west and three negative tests to the
east. Its linear distance is estimated at 200 m, and its overall size is about 914.6
square meters. The artifacts found at this site consist of a Yarbrough point, a
medial segment of a biface, and eleven flakes. All of the artifacts consist of
medium to fine grained quartzite except for two chert flakes. Both materials are
common in the area, and that is typical of sites in East Texas where these
materials are common. The age of this site cannot be accurately stated based on
the finding of one diagnostic artifact. However, the presence of a Yarbrough
point is an indicator of an Archaic occupation. Since no ceramics or arrow points
were found in an area that was thoroughly shovel tested, it is very possible that
this is a single component site that dates to the Archaic period of Texas
prehistory. According to Suhm et al. (1954:492) Yarbrough points are Early
Archaic and possibly later and date to circa 500 B.C. to A.D. 1000. They also
state that the Yarbrough point is a major type of the East Texas Aspect (Archaic
Stage), and it may also be associated with sites belonging to the Alto Focus and
other foci of the Gibson Aspect (Neo-American Stage). It is a common point type
in East Texas. The Yarbrough point and biface fragment are described and
illustrated in Appendix VI. A map of this site is in Appendix VII. The eligibility of
that portion of site 41MX141 located within the project area APE for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places is undetermined, and avoidance or
significance testing is recommended.

41MX143
This prehistoric site is depicted on the 7.5’ Cookville topographic
quadrangle. At the time of this survey, it was in a scattered grove of small
hardwood and cedar trees in pasture. It is approximately 240 m west of Boggy
Creek in the Big Cypress Creek drainage basin (Appendix IV). The landform is
on the east side of a finger slope overlooking the Boggy Creek floodplain at an
elevation ranging from 330 to 340 feet AMSL (Appendix VII) and has shallow
soils with large areas of sub-soil clay exposure. The soil in the site area was
identified as Cuthbert fine sandy loam, 8 to 25 percent slopes (CsE). Eight
shovel tests were dug, and each one reached clay at depths of 5-21 cm.
Artifacts were found in three tests and included one quartzite flake at 0-14 cm
and one flake made from jasper at 0-10 cm. In addition, one chert flake and
three quartzite flakes were observed on the surface. The linear distance of this
site is estimated at 40 m, and its overall size is about 183 square meters. The
boundaries were determined by two or more negative shovel tests. The road has
cut into the landform 2-3 m below the original surface, and this has resulted in
this portion of the site being subjected to erosion. Other forms of disturbance
include an existing Tri Special Utility District water line that parallels the fence
line and a Bowie-Cass Electric Cooperative, Inc. overhead power line. The
portion of site 41MX143 located within the project area APE is not eligible for
listing in the National Register of Historic Places. The temporary number
assigned to this site was MX-A.
41MX144
This multi-component site is depicted on the 7.5’ Cookville topographic
quadrangle (Appendix IV). It is located in the corner formed by the intersection of
FM 144 and CR 3311 (Appendix VII). According to Charles Russell, Ervin
Vaught built a house there in the 1940s, and it was destroyed by fire sometime
after 1980. The site is located several hundred meters from Boggy Creek in the
Big Cypress Creek drainage basin on the edge of an upland setting at an
elevation at 360 feet AMSL. At the time of this study, the area was in pasture.
Stands of hardwoods, privet bushes, and small cedar trees were present around
the historic features and along the fence. Additional vegetation consisted of
ornamental iris and lily plants. The site had been disturbed by an overhead
power line belonging to Bowie-Cass Electric Cooperative, Inc. and a Tri Special
Utility District water line that parallels the fence. The soil in the site area is
Cuthbert fine sandy loam, 8 to 25 percent slopes (CsE). Five shovel tests were
excavated, and each one encountered clay at depths of 14-38 cm. The
prehistoric component was identified by two quartzite flakes at 20-37 cm.
Artifacts associated with the house consisted of a porcelain ceramic sherd, wire
nail, and possible bathroom tile fragment at 0-20 cm. The linear distance of this
site is estimated at 10 m, and its overall size is about 46 square meters.

The western boundary was determined by negative shovel tests, and
County Road 3311 forms the eastern boundary. A well and cellar were observed
within the APE, and a concrete tiled well was observed several meters to the north
(Figure 10).

Figure 10. Well at 41MX144
The well in the APE is approximately four feet in diameter and has been
filled in with soil. The rim of the well consists of sandstone rocks mortared together,
and they extend about 1.5 feet below the surface, and the rest of the wall consists
of clay. The rock probably extended a few feet above the surface, but it appears
that it was bladed even with the current surface when the well was filled with soil. At
the time of this study, the well was greatly obscured with vegetation (Figure 11).
The cellar is located on the northeast side of the well (Figure 12). It was
constructed with concrete that was measured at one foot thick. The cellar is about
74 inches deep and rises to about 18 inches above the surface. The dimensions
are seven feet north/south by ten feet east/west. A brown sewer tile serves as the
source of ventilation in the center of the roof of the cellar. The entrance is on the
east side of the cellar. It extends from the roof to the base of the cellar floor and it
is three feet wide. At the time of this study, a thin piece of sheet metal covered the
entrance. On the floor of the cellar were various pieces of modern garbage and
several rolls of old barbed wire that had been removed from previous fences. The
well and cellar are on the northern edge of the proposed water line, and they can
easily be avoided during construction activities. All features at this site must be
avoided.

This historic site is depicted on the 7.5’ Naples topographic quadrangle
(Appendix IV). It is on a large finger slope at an elevation of 370 feet AMSL
between two small tributaries of Okry Creek in the Big Cypress Creek drainage
basin (Appendix VII). The soil in the site area is Bowie fine sandy loam, 2 to 5
percent slopes (BoC). Seven shovel tests were excavated at this site, and each
one encountered clay at depths of 24-31 cm. Its linear distance is estimated at 60
m, and its overall size is about 274 square meters. Three tests were positive and
contained a small amount of assorted glass and a whiteware ceramic sherd. One
piece of glass is solarized and dates to the latter part of the 19th and/or early part of
the 20th century. Disturbance to the site consists of road construction and an
existing Tri Special Utility District water line that is about 2 m inside the fence and
parallels it. Along the southern edge of the site is a large pile of flat sandstone
rocks that were measured at one to three feet in diameter and up to 70 cm in
thickness surrounded by small hardwood and cedar trees. The rocks are located in
what was once a small stock tank, and they appear to have been brought in to fill in
the old pond area. The survey recovered artifacts in an area near an existing
structure, and they may be related to the house. The rock feature is not part of the
historic site and is not significant. The portion of site 41MX145 located within the
project area APE is not eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.

This multi-component site is depicted on the 7.5’ Naples topographic
quadrangle (Appendix IV). It is on the edge of a large toe slope at an elevation
range of 360 to 380 feet AMSL (Appendix VII). At the time of this survey, the site
was in an abandoned pasture that was overgrown in weeds and small hardwood
brush beginning to reclaim the area. It is located about 60 m east of a small
tributary of Okry Creek in the Big Cypress Creek drainage basin. The only known
disturbance is an existing Tri Special Utility District water line about 2 m from the
fence. Nine shovel tests were excavated in Kirvin very fine sandy loam, 3 to 8
percent slopes (KfC). Each test encountered clay at depths from 26- 66 cm. Its
linear distance is estimated at 40 m, and its overall size is about 183 square
meters. Three tests were positive and yielded two quartzite flakes and historic trash
at depths of 20- 60 cm. The age and function of the prehistoric component is not
known. The historic component consisted of ten fragments of clear glass, one clear
glass rim for a screw top jar, and a flowerpot fragment. The historic component
probably dates to the 20th century, and it may be related to nearby structures. The
historic component likely represents a trash scatter that has no research potential.

from 340 to 350 feet AMSL (Appendix VII). At the time of this survey, it was in
pasture. The site is about 15 m north of a relief channel of Okry Creek in the
Sulphur River drainage basin. This site is probably larger than what was
documented in the APE, and it might be related to or associated with recorded
archeological sites in the area. Disturbances to the site include a pasture that was
a private rodeo arena about 15 to 20 years ago and a Tri Special Utility District
water line that parallels the fence. Eight shovel tests were excavated in Bowie fine
sandy loam, 2 to 5 percent slopes (BoC). Four tests were positive and contained
two quartzite flakes, one flake made from jasper, and one novaculite flake, all were
found at 0-20 cm below the surface. Its linear distance is estimated at 60 m, and its
overall size is about 274 square meters. The age and function of this site is not

Locality 5
The Robert L. Talley house is depicted on the Cookville 7.5’ topographic
quadrangle (Appendix IV). It is located on the north side of FM 144 and east of the
intersection with CR 3315 in Morris County (Figure 13). The first owners were
Robert L. Talley and his wife Florence. Mr. Talley owned sixty acres and was a
cotton farmer. The Talley’s raised ten children, and the first child was born in the
house in the 1890s. Robert Talley died in 1936, and his wife inherited the property.
Another daughter (Annie Mae Gilstrap) lived there from 1936 until 1997, and she
became the next owner in 1961 when Florence passed away. Between 1997 and
2004, the house was abandoned. Charles Russell acquired the house from the
Gilstrap estate in 2004 and is the current owner. The original floor plan included a
dog run in the center that was later changed to create two rooms with doors to the
outside. The original structure was moved to the current site from another location,
and other rooms were added and outbuildings were constructed behind the house.
At one time the screen porch behind the house was used for storing canned goods
and other household supplies. Later, part of the porch was converted to a
bathroom. There was also a side room behind the house where the hired hand
lived. The well was on the west side on a porch behind the house. Russell is 84
years old, and he provided the above information regarding the history of his house.
There is an existing water line very close to the house that was installed in
the 1940s. The new water line will be placed between it and the highway. There is
no current address on file at the Tri Special Utility District. All above ground water
line components will be greater than 100 feet from this structure; thereby,
avoiding all indirect effects. This house is depicted in figures 14-15.

6 and 8 (figures 16 and 17). According to a historic marker on the house, it was
built in 1859 for J. G. Henderson; one of the early settlers of the area. The
Henderson family lived there until 1929 when they sold it to a Mr. Cason who sold it
to Carlos Mendoza (date unknown). Mendoza never lived there, and he sold it to
the Walkers in the 1960s. The Walkers are credited with preserving it, and the
house was recognized as a Registered Texas Historic Landmark in 1967.
The Blue family purchased the house in 1999 and began a second
restoration. At the time, the house was in very poor condition and livestock were
often seen inside the deteriorating structure. Mrs. Blue said that the house was
once much larger but the Walkers sold some of the timber from the back of the
house. The only part of the house that is original today is the interior framing that
consists of hand-hewn timber. The original house had two doors on the front, and
the current owners installed one door in the center, added rooms on each end, and
made other changes that are not consistent with the original structure. At the time it
was owned by the Casons, Mr. Hex Kneif lived there as a stepson. He visited the
current owners in the late 1960s when he was 98 years old and shared his
memories of the house. According to him, the well was in the front and produced
some of the best water in the area. He also said that the house had been
constructed on one of the original 640-acre Texas land grants and the architect had
built six other houses in the area and was well known. The water line will be 200
feet behind the house, and it will have no effect on the structure. The location of this
house is depicted on the 7.5’ Cookville topographical quadrangle (Appendix IV).
This house is not eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places
because of its altered condition through various phases of renovation. Because
very little of the original structure remains, this site is not eligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places, and all above ground water line components
will be greater than 100 feet from this structure; thereby avoiding all indirect
effects.

Locality 8
A wooden frame house is located on the west side of FM 144 in Morris
County and directly across from a private road leading to a landing strip (figures 18
and 19). According to Charles Russell, the first owner was J. C. Cherry, and the
current owner is the J. V. Hampton Trust. At the time of this survey, this house was
inhabited by renters. The new water line will be placed 200 feet behind the house,
and there will be no visual obstructions as a result. This locality is depicted on the
7.5’ Naples topographic quadrangle (Appendix IV). The well at Locality 9 was part
of the Cherry estate. All above ground water line components will be greater than
100 feet from this structure; thereby avoiding all indirect effects.

Locality 9
This isolated well is depicted on the 7.5’ Naples topographic quadrangle
(Appendix IV). It is on the west side of FM 144 between localities 8 and 10
(Figure 20). According to Charles Russell it was part of the J. C. Cherry Estate
(see Locality 8) and never associated with a house. There will be no direct or
indirect effects caused by above ground water line components to this feature.
The land is owned by the J. V. Hampton Trust.

Locality 10
A house is depicted in this area on a 1908 soil map of Franklin, Titus, and
Morris counties dated 1908 and prepared by the United States Department of
Agriculture, Bureau of Soils. According to Charles Russell, it was known as the
McCollum Place. Russell said it was destroyed by fire, but he does not know
when that occurred. The supposed location of this house is depicted on the 7.5’
Naples topographic quadrangle (Appendix IV). There will be no direct or indirect
effects caused by above ground water line components. The J. V. Hampton
Trust owns it.
Locality 11
This locality is located on the east side of US Highway 259 and the west
bank of an unnamed tributary of Okry Creek. It was discovered when one quartzite
interior flake was found in Shovel Test 64 between 20 cm and 40 cm. This positive
test was flanked by two or more negative tests in each direction. They are shovel
tests 63 (20 m to the north and 65 (20 m to the south). This locality is depicted on
the on the 7.5’ Naples topographic quadrangle (Appendix IV, Map 2). This area is
referred to as a locality instead of an isolated find because Isolated finds are best
defined as a single artifact on the surface with no apparent association of other
artifacts or structures. Since flakes and other forms of debitage often represent tool
manufacture or repair, it is always possible that more artifacts are present at this
site and would be recovered if additional shovel tests were dug. The presence of
only one flake flaked by negative tests is not enough to warrant additional work,
and the portion of this locality in the project area APE is not eligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places. No further work is recommended.

41TT873
This prehistoric site was recorded by archaeologists from PBS&J
(Maynard et al. 2009) during an intensive archaeological survey for a TxDOT
bridge replacement and roadway-widening project (see Previous Investigations
above). The site was investigated by a surface inspection and shovel testing.
Eight shovel tests were excavated, and two were positive. One flake was found
in each of the positive tests at a depth of 10-20 cm. The recorders refer to this
site as having “limited potential.” The water line passes very close to one of the
positive tests (Figure 21). The recovery of only two flakes suggests that this site
is not significant, and some archaeologists would have recorded it as an isolated
find. Since this site had been adequately tested, and it was not possible to work
outside of the APE, no additional work was conducted during this study. The
portion of site 41TT873 located within the project area APE is not eligible for
listing in the National Register of Historic Places. Should the water line be
moved to within the right-of-way, additional shovel tests is recommended.

41TT875
This prehistoric site was recorded by archaeologists from PBS&J
(Maynard et al. 2009) during an intensive archaeological survey for a TxDOT
bridge replacement and roadway-widening project (see Previous Investigations
above). The site was investigated by a controlled surface inspection and shovel
testing. Ten shovel tests were excavated, and two were positive. Three flakes
were found at depths of 30-60 cm. A burin was observed on the surface. It was
photographed and not collected. The recorders refer to this site as one having
“limited potential.” The water line will pass approximately ten meters west of the
site (Figure 22). The recovery of only two flakes suggests that this site is not
significant, and some archaeologists would have recorded it as an isolated find.
Since this site had been adequately tested and it is not within the APE, no
additional work was conducted during this study. Although the significance of
this site is undetermined, the water line will have no direct effect on this site.

41TT100
This prehistoric site was recorded in 1975 by Milton Bell who visited this
area because it was reported that artifacts had been found during the early
phases of highway construction (see Previous Investigations above). Artifacts
collected during this survey included plain sherds and flakes (number and area of
finds not stated). The site was recommended for further work, and the site was
visited in 2009 by archaeologists from PBS&J. They observed three flakes on
the surface but did not collect them. Twenty-two shovel tests were excavated in
the area, and not one was positive. The water line will pass through the western
edge of the area that was shovel tested (Figure 23). Since the site area has
been extensively shovel tested with negative results, no additional work was
conducted during this study. The area recorded as site 41TT100 is not eligible for
listing in the National Register of Historic Places.

41TT101
This multi-component site was recorded in 1975 by Milton Bell who visited
this area because it was reported that pottery had been found during the early
phases of highway construction (see Previous Investigations above). During the
visit by Mr. Bell, flakes and ceramic sherds were observed but not collected. The
site form does not mention the methods employed by Milton Bell and his
colleagues. Many of these early surveys by Highway Department personnel did
not incorporate shovel testing, and no report documenting this investigation was
available for review. It was recommended that further work be conducted, and
the site was visited in 2009 by archaeologists from PBS&J led by Lynne O’Kelly
who conducted a controlled surface inspection and dug thirty-four shovel tests at
intervals of 10 m. Artifacts collected included chert and quartzite flakes,
whiteware, transfer ware, baked clay, brown glass, crockery, metal wire, and
bone. No artifacts were collected. Ground surface visibility was estimated at
75% at the time of their visit. The size of this size was determined to be 130 m
north south by 50 m east west based on the location of positive tests (Figure 24).
The site form does not give the depth of cultural materials and it contradicts itself
when it says that the thickness of deposit is unknown because there were no
subsurface artifacts. The site area was mapped using a compass pacing. No
features were observed that would be associated with the historic component.
They described this site as having “potential for significant data resources” and
they also say that it is unknown if there were “multiple habitations or one late
native habitation.” Since the APE is at least 10 meters west of the site, no
additional work was conducted during this study. Although the significance of
this site is undetermined, the water line will have no direct effect on this site.

41TT919
This unknown prehistoric site is depicted on the 7.5’ Talco topographic
quadrangle (Appendix IV). It is located at the southern tip of a large toe slope at an
elevation of 330 feet AMSL (Appendix VII). It is possible that this site extends to the
north and south on this landform. At the time of this investigation, the landform was
covered in small to medium sized hardwood trees with an understory of shrubs and
briars. The major stream in the area is Lewis Creek that is part of the Sulphur River
drainage basin. The site is situated between the headwaters of a small tributary of
Lewis Creek 100 m to the east and another small tributary of the same creek 60 m
to the west. Seven shovel tests were dug in Woodtell fine sandy loam, 2 to 5
percent slopes (WoC). Clay was encountered in each test at depths of 10-32 cm.
Its linear distance is estimated at 30 m, and its overall size is about 137 square
meters. The eastern and western boundaries were determined by two or more
negative shovel tests. Three quartzite flakes were found at 0-20 cm below the
surface. Disturbance to this site consists of road construction, fence construction,
and erosion. No diagnostic artifacts were recovered, and no features were
observed. Therefore, the age and function of this site is not known. The portion of
site 41TT919 located within the project area APE is not eligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places. The temporary number assigned to this site
was TT-K.
41TT920
This prehistoric site is depicted on the 7.5’ Talco topographic quadrangle
(Appendix IV). It is located on top of a saddle on a southward facing finger slope
at an elevation of 330 feet AMSL (Appendix VII). There are two small tributaries
on either side of the landform. The distance from the tributary on the eastern
side is about 100 m, and the distance from the tributary on the western side is
200 m. Both flow south to Lewis Creek that is part of the Sulphur River drainage
basin. At the time of this investigation, the vegetation in the site area consisted
of small to medium sized hardwood trees with an understory of shrubs and
briars. Disturbance in the site area consists of an entrance road that was
overgrown with small hardwood trees about five years old, the fence that
separates the highway right-of-way from private property, and evidence of land
clearing activities. Several push piles were observed in the area that may be
related to the land clearing. Eight shovel tests were excavated in Woodtell fine
sandy loam, 2 to 5 percent slopes (WoC). Each test was dug to clay and
terminated at depths of 22-38 cm. Its linear distance is estimated at 40 m, and its
overall size is about 183 square meters. The eastern and western boundaries
were determined by two or more negative shovel tests. Three quartzite flakes
were found at 0-32 cm in two tests at the top of the landform. No diagnostic
artifacts were recovered, and no features were observed. Therefore, the age
and function of this site is not known. The portion of site 41TT920 located within
the project area APE is not eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic
Places. The temporary number assigned in the field to this site was TT-L.

45

41TT921
This prehistoric site with a minor historic component is depicted on the 7.5’
Talco topographic quadrangle (Appendix IV). This site is located along the edge of
fairly level prairie terrain dotted with prairie mounds at an elevation of 220 feet
AMSL. A small tributary of Big Slough Creek in the Sulphur River drainage basin is
about 5 m north of the site. At the time of this investigation, the site area was in
pasture with thick waist high weeds mixed with improved grasses. Eight shovel
tests were excavated in Woodtell fine sandy loam, 2 to 5 percent slopes (WoC) to
depths of 18 to 38 cm. The creek forms the northern boundary, and the southern
boundary was determined by two negative tests (Appendix VII). Its linear distance
is estimated at 77 m, and its overall size is about 252 square meters. Four tests
were positive, and they yielded 20 quartzite flakes, one piece of milk glass, and one
clear glass fragment at depths of 0-20 cm. When the county road was constructed,
it cut through the mound about 1.5 m in depth. The two tests dug in the mound
area contained the majority of all artifacts recovered at the site. The topographic
quadrangle depicts a barn and possible residence on the east side of the county
road, and the historic artifacts may represent a minor trash scatter related to these
structures. Their presence in the site area is not significant in terms of a need for
additional research. The portion of site 41TT921 located within the project area
APE is not eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. The
temporary number assigned to this site was TT-M.
41TT922
This prehistoric site with a minor historic component is depicted on the 7.5’
Talco topographic quadrangle (Appendix IV). It is located on a slope ranging in
elevation from 305 to 330 feet AMSL approximately 60 m north of a tributary of
Big Slough Creek in the Sulphur River drainage basin (Appendix VII). The main
part of the site is the top of the landform where the Hollis residence is located.
Mr. Hollis stated that numerous projectile points and pottery sherds were found
when the hill was scraped to create a level surface for the house foundation and
in the gardens and other disturbed areas. Eighteen shovel tests were excavated
by Bo Nelson and the Principal Investigator. Thirteen tests were positive and
yielded 33 quartzite flakes, one Yarbrough point, and two clear glass fragments.
The tests were dug in Woodtell fine sandy loam, 2 to 5 percent slopes (WoC),
and clay was encountered at depths of 10-32 cm. Two shovel tests may contain
evidence of slope wash due to soil color change with an appearance of an
unnatural layered soil matrix. At the time of this investigation, the site area was
in pasture and the yard in front of the house was well maintained. The western
edge of the site has been disturbed by highway construction that removed about
5 m from the surface of the landform; the pond to the north; Mr. Hollis’ house;
and agricultural activities that includes gardens, fences, and outbuildings. This
linear distance of this site within the APE is 230 m, and its overall size is 1052
square meters.

The portion of site 41TT922 located within the project area APE is not
eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. The temporary
number assigned to this site was TT-N. The Yarbrough point is described and
illustrated in Appendix VI.
Locality 12
This house is depicted on the Talco topographic quadrangle (Appendix IV).
It is located on the east side of US Highway 271 in Titus County just before the
road takes a sharp turn to the east (Figure 25). This is a wooden frame house with
a metal pyramid or hipped roof. The double doors on the front suggest separate
rooms. A later addition to the back of the house is visible in Figure 22. According
to Aaron Gann, the water line will be installed 60 feet in front of the house. The Tri
Special Utility District does not have the name of the current owner or the address
of the property in their files. All above ground water line components will be
greater than 100 feet from this structure; thereby, avoiding all indirect effects.
This house is depicted in figures 26 and 27.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Prehistoric Sites
Eighteen sites that yielded prehistoric artifacts are discussed in this report.
Of this number, four (41FK140-41FK42, and 41FK144) are in Franklin County;
six (41MX62, 41MX141, 41MX143, 41MX144, 41MX146, and 41MX147) are in
Morris County; and eight (41TT100, 41TT101, 41TT873, 41TT875, and
41TT919-41TT922) are in Titus County. All of these sites are within the project
area APE except 41TT101 and 41TT875. Since the provenience of artifacts from
site 41TT100 is not known and the twenty-two shovel tests excavated at the site
were negative, it is cannot be stated with certainty if the artifact producing areas
of this site are within the project area APE.
Most of the prehistoric sites were recorded on the basis of lithic debitage,
and no features were observed at any of these sites. Sites where lithic debitage
is the only artifact type recovered are 41FK140-41FK141; 41MX143, 41MX144,
41MX146, and 41MK147; and 41TT919-41TT921. It is the opinion of the author
that the portion of these sites located within the project APE is not eligible for listing
in the National Register of Historic Places.
A single flake was found in one shovel test, and this area is described in this
report as Locality 11. Lithic debitage usually is indicative of tool making or
maintenance. Most of the flakes are small interior flakes made from quartzite.
Other raw materials identified are chert and novaculite. Quartzite and chert are
local materials that are present in the gravel deposits of nearby streams and
rivers and are common at sites in the area. Novaculite is a non-local material
found in Arkansas, and its presence suggests trade. Age cannot be determined
for sites where diagnostic artifacts are not present. These sites probably represent
limited activity areas or temporary camps. Collectively, the prehistoric sites in the
project area are shallow in terms of depth of deposits of cultural material. The
maximum depth for cultural materials at eleven of the sites was 40 cm or less. It is
the opinion of the author that the portion of these sites located within the project
APE is not eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.
Diagnostic artifacts were found at four sites during this survey. The
Archaic period is represented by a Gary point at site 41MX62 and Yarbrough
points at sites 41MX141 and 41TT922. Since no arrow points or ceramics were
found at either site, it is possible that these are single component Archaic sites.
Michael G. Turner reported finding a San Patrice point at 41MX62, and this find
may represent a Late Paleo-Indian component. The eligibility of that portion of
sites 41MX62 and 41MX141 located within the project area APE for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places is undetermined, and avoidance or
significance testing is recommended.

49

Although thirty-one flakes and a Yarbrough point were found at site
41TT922, that portion of the site within the project APE is on a slope and not
believed to be the main part of the site. Therefore, the portion of this site in the
project area APE is not eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic
Places.
Pottery was found at sites 41FK144, 41TT100, and 41TT101. The
ceramics from site 41FK144 were identified by Timothy K. Perttula as Caddo,
and he dates them to sometime after A.D. 1250 or during the Late Caddo period
(circa A.D. 1450-1680) that is associated with the Titus phase. Pottery is usually
associated with sites that were occupied on a more permanent basis and this
artifact type can be indicative of cooking and storage. A metate fragment was
found at site 41FK142, a type also associated with plant procurement,
processing, and/or consumption.
The artifacts at 41FK144 were found on a very disturbed surface and in
shallow shovel tests that did not exceed 30 cm in depth. Therefore, the portion of
this site located within the project area APE is not eligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places. Extensive shovel testing at site 41TT100
failed to recover additional artifacts. Based on thorough coverage of the area
through shovel testing, the portion of site 41TT100 within the project area APE
does not appear to be eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic
Places. Site 41TT101 is not in the project APE; therefore the eligibility of this site
for listing in the National Register of Historic Places is undetermined, and
avoidance or testing may be necessary if it is threatened by future development.
Historic Sites
Nine sites with historic artifacts are discussed in this report. Of this
number, three (41FK140, 41FK143, and 41FK144) are in Franklin County, three
(41MX144, 41MX145, and 41MX146) are in Morris County, and three (41TT921,
41TT922, and 41TT101) are in Titus County. Site 41TT101 is the only site with
historic artifacts that is not in the project APE. Most of the historic sites were
recorded on the basis of trash on the surface and in shovel tests at depths of less
than 20 cm. Some of the artifact scatters are believed to be associated with
nearby structures. The only site where features were present is 41MX144. Two
wells and a cellar were observed, and they were part of a homestead owned by
Ervin Vaught who built his house in the 1940s. It is the opinion of the author that
the portion of these sites located within the project APE is not eligible for listing in
the National Register of Historic Places. It is recommended, however, that the
wells and cellar be avoided during construction of the water line. The eligibility of
41TT101 for listing in the National Register of Historic Places is undetermined,
and avoidance or testing may be necessary if it is threatened by future
development.

50

Other Cultural Resources
Other sites and areas of interest in the area are four historic age
structures, two areas where structures once stood, an isolated well, three
cemeteries, a recent grave on private property, a segment of the Paris and
Mount Pleasant Railroad, and a portion of the Cherokee Trace.
The historic structures in or near the project APE are the Robert L. Talley
house (Locality 5), the J. C. Cherry house (Locality 8), the Ned Walker house
(Locality 7), and a house whose original owner and builder are not known
(Locality 12). All above ground water line components will be greater than 100
feet from these structures; thereby avoiding all indirect effects.
Other structures observed within 100 feet of the easement are a wooden
shed in poor condition and several modern pole barns that were not recorded as
sites. Two houses may have been in close proximity to the APE, but they have
been demolished (localities 6 and 10). They are depicted on a soil map sheet of
Franklin, Titus, and Morris Counties dated 1908 and prepared by the United States
Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Soils. These sites are not significant, and
avoidance is not recommended.
The Murphree Family Cemetery (FK-C019) is the only cemetery within 75
feet of the project area APE. It is recommended that the water line be placed at a
distance sufficient to avoid direct effect to this historic site. It is referred to in this
report as Locality 1.
The Smith family cemetery (FK-C020) is in thick woods, and only three
graves were visible when B. F. Hicks, and Doris Meek visited it. They described it
as a “lost cemetery in the woods” about one-fourth mile north of the Murphree
Cemetery. The earliest marked grave is for Mary E. Smith who died in 1891.
There will be no direct effect to this cemetery by the proposed water line. It is
referred to in this report as Locality 2.
A recent burial of a single individual was observed on private property.
This grave (Locality 3) is not part of a dedicated cemetery. It is recommended
that the water line be placed on the opposite side of the road to avoid direct effect
to this historic site.
The Midway Cemetery (FK-C021) is a well-maintained cemetery that dates
to circa 1900. According to Mr. Hicks, it is at least 75 feet from the APE. There is a
paved parking lot between the road and the cemetery, and the Midway Church is
no longer there. There will be no direct effect to this historic site by the water line
as currently proposed. It is referred to in this report as Locality 4.

51

Locality 9 is an isolated well. According to Charles Russell it was part of the
J. C. Cherry Estate (see Locality 8) and never associated with a house. There will
be no direct or indirect effects to this feature caused by above ground water line
components.
At one time, the Paris and Mount Pleasant Railroad crossed the project area
near the intersection of County Road 1828 and Farm-to-Market Road 71 in the City
of Talco. No site number was assigned to this area.
A portion of the historic Cherokee Trace follows the route of Franklin County
Road 2110 along the north-south section of the APE for about thirty miles. Since
the road covers the original Trace, there are no areas where the Trace is visible in
the APE. According to historian B. F. Hicks, sections of the Trace are exposed in
other areas.

52

RECOMMENDATIONS
The recommendations below are based on the footprint of the APE as
currently proposed. Should the water line be moved to an area not investigated
during the current project, it is possible that the new area will need to be examined.
Copies of the report are on file at the THC, Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL), the Texas State Library, Tri Special Utility District, and BVRA.
The artifacts were returned to the landowners, and the records will be curated at
TARL.
Franklin County Cultural Resources
Site 41FK140 is a multi-component site that did not yield a large number
of artifacts. The prehistoric component consisted of only four flakes, and the
historic component consisted of two stoneware ceramic sherds and a shotgun
shell casing. This is a shallow site with all artifacts found between the surface
and 20 cm. The portion of site 41FK140 located within the project area APE is
not eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places, and no further
work is recommended.
Site 41FK141 is a prehistoric site that only yielded only eight flakes. The
portion of site 41FK141 located within the project area APE is not eligible for
listing in the National Register of Historic Places, and no further work is
recommended.
Site 41FK142 is a prehistoric site that yielded only three flakes and a
metate fragment. This is a shallow site with all artifacts found from 0 to 33 cm.
The portion of site 41FK142 located within the project area APE is not eligible for
listing in the National Register of Historic Places, and no further work is
recommended.
Site 41FK143 is a small trash scatter that may have been associated with
a nearby tenant house. The portion of site 41FK143 located within the project
area APE is not eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.
Site 41FK144 is a multi-component site. The prehistoric component
consists of flakes and Caddo ceramics found on a very disturbed surface and in
shallow shovel tests that did not exceed 30 cm in depth. The historic component
is a small trash scatter that may have been associated with structures about 140
m to the southwest. The portion of site 41FK144 located within the project area
APE is not eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.

53

Locality 1 is the Murphree family cemetery (FK-C019). Based on
information provided by local historian B. F. Hicks, it is unlikely that any graves
are in the APE. Also, there is an existing 6” water line that was placed there in
1976 by Tri Specialty Utility District. The new water line will be placed adjacent
to the existing one and at the same depth. Since no graves were encountered
during the installation of the previous water line (Aaron Gann, personal
communication), the new line should have no direct effect on this historic
cemtery. Placing the new water line on the opposite side of the road is not
considered necessary.
Locality 2 is the Smith family cemetery (FK-C020). It is in thick woods about
one-fourth mile north of the Murphree Cemetery. There will be no direct effect to
this cemetery by the proposed water line.
Locality 3 is a recent burial of one individual that is on private property and
not part of a dedicated cemetery. It is recommended that the water line be placed
on the opposite side of the road to avoid direct effect to this historic site.
Locality 4 is the Midway Cemetery (FK-C021). According to B. F. Hicks, it is
at least 75 feet from the APE. There is a paved parking lot between the road and
the cemetery, and the Midway Church is no longer there. There will be no direct
effect to this historic site by the water line as currently proposed.
A portion of the historic Cherokee Trace follows the route of Franklin County
Road 2110 along the north-south section of the APE. All evidence of the trace has
been obliterated by the county road. Therefore, it is recommended that
construction in this area proceed as planned.
Morris County Cultural Resources
Site 41MX62 is a prehistoric site that yielded twelve flakes, one Gary point,
and one medial segment of a biface that appears to be a broken dart point of an
unknown type. Flakes made from novaculite suggests trade and interaction with
groups in areas outside of Texas. The presence of a Gary point dates this site to
sometime within the Archaic. The original recorder of this site reported finding a
San Patrice point and no pottery. If this is true, site 41MX62 may have a PaleoIndian component. The apparent absence of pottery and arrow points suggests
that a single Archaic component may be present. The eligibility of that portion of site
41MX62 located within the project area APE for listing in the National Register of
Historic Places is undetermined, and avoidance or significance testing is
recommended.

Site 41MX141 is a prehistoric site that yielded a Yarbrough point, a biface
medial section that may be a broken dart point, and eleven flakes. Yarbrough
points date to the Archaic. It is possible that this is a single component site that
dates to the Archaic. This statement is supported by the fact that all cultural
materials were found at depths of 20 cm to 40 cm, and it appears that most of the
site area is uniform in terms of depth. The eligibility of that portion of site
41MX141 located within the project area APE for listing in the National Register
of Historic Places is undetermined, and avoidance or significance testing is
recommended.
Site 41MX143 is shallow prehistoric site with large areas of sub-soil clay
exposure. Artifacts recovered include one quartzite flake at 0-14 cm and one flake
made from jasper at 0-10 cm. In addition, one chert flake and three quartzite flakes
were observed on the surface. The portion of site 41MX143 located within the
project area APE is not eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.
Site 41MX144 is a multi-component site that yielded both prehistoric and
historic artifacts. The prehistoric component is represented by two quartzite
flakes, and the historic component is represented by a well and cellar within the
APE, a concrete tiled well several meters to the north, and a small trash scatter.
The portion of site 41MX144 located within the project area APE is not eligible for
listing in the National Register of Historic Places. It is, however, recommended
that the well and cellar be avoided during the construction of the water line.
Site 41MX145 is a historic site that yielded a small amount of assorted glass
and a white ware ceramic sherd that may be related to a nearby house. The
portion of site 41MX145 located within the project area APE is not eligible for listing
in the National Register of Historic Places.
Site 41MX146 is a multi-component site that contained both prehistoric
and historic artifacts. The prehistoric component consists of two quartzite flakes,
and the historic component consists of ten fragments of clear glass, one clear
glass rim for a screw top jar, and a flowerpot fragment. The historic component
is probably a trash scatter that may be related to nearby structures. The portion
of site 41MX146 located within the project area APE is not eligible for listing in
the National Register of Historic Places.
Site 41MX147 is a prehistoric site that yielded only four flakes. The portion
of site 41MX147 located within the project area APE is not eligible for listing in
the National Register of Historic Places.

Site 41TT873 is a prehistoric that was recorded on the basis of two flakes.
The portion of site 41TT873 located within the project area APE is not eligible for
listing in the National Register of Historic Places.
Site 41TT875 is a prehistoric site that was recorded on the basis of two
flakes. This site is not within the APE, and it is not eligible for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places, and no further work is warranted.
Site 41TT100 is a prehistoric site that was recorded on the basis of flakes
and ceramics during highway construction. Twenty-two shovel tests were
excavated in the area and not one was positive. This site is not eligible for listing in
the National Register of Historic Places, and no further work is recommended.
Site 41TT101 is a multi-component site located at least 10 m east of the
APE. The eligibility of this site for listing in the National Register of Historic Places
is undetermined, and avoidance or testing may be necessary if it is threatened by
future development.
Site 41TT919 is a prehistoric site that yielded only three quartzite flakes at
0-20 cm below the surface. The portion of site 41TT919 located within the
project area APE is not eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic
Places.
Site 41TT920 is a prehistoric site that yielded only three quartzite flakes at
0-32 cm. The portion of site 41TT920 located within the project area APE is not
eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.
Site 41TT921 is a multi-component site with both prehistoric and historic
artifacts. The prehistoric component is a pimple mound that has been disturbed
by construction of the county road. The artifact yield was of twenty flakes, and
the historic component consists of one clear glass fragment. This is a shallow
site with all artifacts found at depths of 0-20 cm. The historic artifacts may
represent a minor trash scatter that is related to a barn and possible residence
on the other side of the road. The portion of site 41TT921 located within the
project area APE is not eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic
Places.
Site 41TT922 is a multi-component site with both prehistoric and historic
artifacts. The main part of the site is the top of the landform. The prehistoric
component yielded thirty-one quartzite flakes and one Yarbrough point that dates to
the Archaic. The historic component is represented by only two clear glass
fragments. The portion of the site where the main concentration of artifacts has
been found by Mr. Hollis may be eligible for listing in the National Register of
Historic Places, but the portion of this site located within the project area APE is not
eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.

APPENDIX V
Analysis of Caddo Ceramic Sherds from 41FK144,
Franklin County, Texas
Timothy K. Perttula
Introduction
Recent archeological investigations along a proposed waterline right-ofway recovered a small sample of prehistoric Caddo ceramic sherds (n=12) from
a newly recorded site (41FK144) in the White Oak Creek stream basin in
northern Franklin County, Texas. The analysis of these sherds follows the
recently developed Council of Texas Archeologists Ceramic Protocol for East
Texas Woodland and Caddo sites (Perttula 2010).
Analytical Approach
The initial sorting procedure involved an examination of each sherd to
identify any sherds that could be joined together and determined to be part of the
same vessel (i.e., fitters). If fitters were identified, they were to be treated as
single sherds for purposes of analysis; no fitters were in the small assemblage.
Treating conjoined sherds as single sherds avoids skewing the analysis toward
attributes over-represented by multiple fragments of a single vessel. Next, the
detailed analysis of the ceramic sherds was based on differences in temper, type
of sherd (i.e., rim, body, or base), rim and lip form (cf. Brown 1996:Figure 2-12),
decoration (if present, including the identification of motifs and elements), surface
treatment (smoothing, burnishing, or polishing; see Rice 1987), and firing
conditions (cf. Teltser 1993). Sherd cross-sections were inspected
macroscopically and with a 10X hand lens to determine the character of the
paste and its inclusions. Determining the firing conditions was based on the
identification of the firing core in the sherd cross-sections and the identification of
oxidation patterns as defined in Teltser (1993:535-536 and Figure 2a-h).
Attributes employed in the analysis of the Caddo ceramic sherds from
41FK144 included: (a) temper, the deliberate and indeterminate materials found
in the paste (Rice 1987:411), including a variety of tempers (grog or crushed
sherds, burned bone, etc.); (b) observations on ceramic sherd cross-sections
permitted consideration of oxidation patterns (Teltser 1993:Figure 2), namely the
conditions under which a vessel was fired and then cooled after firing; and (c)
finally, wall thickness was recorded in millimeters (mm), using a vernier caliper,
along the mid-section of the sherd.

With respect to interior and exterior surface treatment on the Franklin
County sherds, the primary methods of finishing the sherds on Woodland and
Caddo sites in East Texas are smoothing, and burnishing; polishing of vessel
surfaces is rare. Smoothing creates “a finer and more regular surface…[and] has
a matte rather than a lustrous surface” (Rice 1987:138). Burnishing creates an
irregular lustrous finish marked by parallel facets left by the burnishing tool
(perhaps a smoothed pebble or bone).
41FK144 Ceramic Sherds
The sample of Caddo sherds from 41FK144 consists of two plain base
sherds, six plain body sherds, one decorated rim sherd, and three decorated
body sherds. This includes seven sherds from the surface between ST 184 and
ST 186, and five sherds between 0-12/20 cm bs in three shovel tests (Table 1).
The density of sherds in the positive shovel tests is 1.67, or ca. 13.4 sherds per
m 2.

The larger sherds in the assemblage (n=10, or 83% of the sherd sample)
were analyzed in detail (Table 2). This analysis indicates that the majority of the
sherds are from vessels tempered with grog (90%), which is consistent with other
East Texas Caddo sites, but a significant portion of the sherds are from vessels
that also have crushed and burned bone temper, either in combination with grog
(50%) or as the sole temper (10%).
Half of the sherds analyzed in detail are from vessels that were fired in a
reducing environment, and then cooled in the open air, with another 20% of the
sherds coming from vessels both fired and cooled in a reducing or low oxygen
environment.
Only two of the sherds had evidence of surface treatment (see Table 2).
One body sherd, probably from a jar, was smoothed only on its interior surface,
but a red-slipped sherd from a bowl was smoothed on both interior and exterior
surfaces.
Four sherds in the small sample from 41FK144 are decorated: one fine
ware sherd with a red slip, and three utility ware sherds with brushing (n=2) or
tool punctates (n=1) (see Table 2). The brushed sherds have horizontal brushing
marks on one rim, and parallel brushing marks on the body; it is likely that the
brushing on the body of the one sherd was actually vertically oriented. The tool
punctated body sherd has a single row of punctations.
Summary and Conclusions
A total of 12 sherds have been recovered at 41FK144 during the present
investigations. They are from at least four separate vessels tempered with grog,
bone, and grog-bone inclusions. The sherds were from vessels fired primarily in
a reducing environment, then cooled in the open air; this is a common method of
firing vessels used by prehistoric Caddo potters in East Texas (Perttula 2010).
Vessel walls range from 4.8-9.2 mm in thickness for plain and decorated body
sherds, 9.2 mm for the base sherds (likely from durable and substantial vessels,
likely a jar), and 7.1 mm for the one decorated rim sherd. Combined with a few
sherds with interior and/or exterior smoothing for a surface treatment, this is
consistent with the sherds being from plain jars and bowls, as well as the
decorated portions of utility ware jars and fine ware bowls.

The four decorated rim and body sherds from 41FK144 provide a few
clues as to their age and cultural affiliation. It seems probable that the sherds are
from a post-A.D. 1250 Caddo occupation at the site because of the occurrence of
both brushed sherds and a red-slipped sherd, as both decorative treatments on
utility wares and fine wares are most common in Caddo sites in this area (i.e.,
Big Cypress Creek basin) only after ca. A.D. 1250 (Perttula and Ellis 2012:Table
8-24), in the Middle and Late Caddo periods. The site also falls within the
northern limits of the Late Caddo (ca. A.D. 1450-1680) Titus phase (Perttula
2012:Figures 13-1a-b; Thurmond 1990), and ceramic assemblages associated
with this Late Caddo culture do have considerable amounts of brushed pottery,
some red-slipped pottery (especially in the northern and western parts of the
Titus phase area), as well as punctated and incised utility ware jars, and
engraved carinated bowls and bottles. A larger sample of decorated sherds from
41FK144 is needed to more definitively establish its chronological age and
cultural affiliation.

LITHIC ANALYSIS

Metate from 41FK142
Material: ferruginous stone
Length: 95.33 mm
Width: 84.44
Thickness: 34.38 mm
Cross-section: Plano-convex
Condition: fragment
Discussion: This is a metate fragment made from a ferrous stone that is common
in East Texas. The surface has been ground to form a slight concave
depression. Numerous vertical striations cover the entire surface.

Gary Point from 41MX62
Material: Quartzite
Length: 36.03 mm
Maximum Width: 19.52 mm
Thickness: 7.66 mm
Basal Width: 9.12 mm
Basal Depth: n/a
Shoulder Width: 19.52 mm
Juncture Width: 12.61 mm
Stem Length: 11.54 mm
Blade Shape: straight
Stem Shape: contracting
Condition: complete
Discussion: This specimen is made of quartzite. It is a typical example of the
Gary type. Some re-working around the distal tip suggests previous damage.
There is a slight “nick” on one shoulder.

Biface Fragment from 41MX62
Material: Quartzite
Length: 37.76 mm (incomplete measurement due to fracture)
Maximum Width: 21.18 mm (incomplete measurement due to fracture)
Thickness: 9.41 mm (incomplete measurement due to fracture)
Shoulder Width: 21.44 mm (incomplete measurement due to fracture)
Juncture Width: 16,76 mm
Condition: medial section
Discussion: This specimen is made of gray quartzite. It probably represents a
broken dart point. The tip and base are missing, and there is some damage to
the lateral edge.

Yarbrough Point from 41MX141
Material: Quartzite
Length: 54.31 mm
Maximum Width: 26.62 mm
Thickness: 9.18 mm
Basal Width: 16.08 mm
Basal Depth: n/a
Shoulder Width: 26.62 mm
Juncture Width: 16.17 mm
Stem Length: 15.45 mm
Stem Smoothing: n/a
Basal Smoothing: n/a
Blade Shape: straight
Stem Shape: straight
Condition: damaged lateral edge near tip
Fracture Type: material flaw
Discussion: This specimen is made of marbled reddish-brown quartzite. It is
complete except for a fracture on the lateral near the tip. The break was not due
to impact. A small inclusion near the tip probably cause the fracture, but the
event that precipitated it is not known.

Biface Fragment from 41MX141
Material: Quartzite
Length: 22.45 mm (incomplete measurement due to fracture)
Maximum Width: 23.71 mm (incomplete measurement due to fracture)
