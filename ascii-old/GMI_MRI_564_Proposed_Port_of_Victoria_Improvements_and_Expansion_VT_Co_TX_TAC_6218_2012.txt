ABSTRACT

This report presents the results of a cultural resources survey for the proposed improvements to
the Pickering Basin and the development of the Port of Victoria Industrial Park South in southern
Victoria County, Texas. This investigation was conducted by Geo-Marine, Inc., under
subcontract to CivilCorp Engineers and Surveyors, for the Port of Victoria. The purpose of this
document is to provide data for use in the management of cultural resources in partial fulfillment
of obligations under National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 [42 U.S.C. §§ 4321–
4347; P.L. 91-190; 83 Stat. 852], the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as
amended through 2000 [16 U.S.C. § 470 et seq.; P.L. 89-665; 80 Stat. 915], and the Antiquities
Code of Texas. These cultural resources investigations were conducted under Texas Antiquities
Permit No. 6812. Investigations consisted of a records search to identify previous cultural
resources surveys conducted in the area and the archeological and historic sites recorded by those
efforts, visual inspection of the project area, subsurface investigations via the excavation of
backhoe trenches and shovel tests, and archival research regarding historic-period resources
encountered within the project area. Fieldwork for this project was conducted in April and May
2012.
Thirteen archeological sites, 41VT155 41VT167, were documented and one previously recorded
archeological site, 41VT98, was revisited during this survey effort. In addition, the location of a
small rural cemetery (41VT168) was documented. Site 41VT98 has been previously determined
to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. This site extends into the proposed Industrial Park
South APE and is likely to preserve deeply buried cultural deposits. It is recommended that site
41VT98 be avoided by ground-disturbing activities or be subjected to additional testing prior to
ground-disturbing activities at the site. Site 41VT168, an unnamed historic period cemetery, is
also recommended for avoidance. Based on NHRP eligibility criteria, all remaining sites
encountered within the survey areas are recommended not eligible. Prehistoric site 41VT165 and
sites with prehistoric components (41VT156, 41VT158, 41VT166, and 41VT167) lack artifact
assemblages or intact cultural features that would retain sufficient data to contribute important
information regarding prehistoric technology, settlement-subsistence patterns, or extra-regional
interaction. The historic sites (41VT155, 41VT156, 41VT157, 41VT159, 41VT160, 41VT161,
41VT162, 41VT163, 41VT164, and 41VT167) and sites with historic period components
(41VT158 and 41VT166) either lack verifiable historical documentation and contextual integrity
or offer only redundant data, severely impeding their ability to yield significant information
iii

regarding historic period development and community patterns in Victoria County. All artifacts
and records associated with this project will be submitted to the Museum of the Coastal Bend in
Victoria, Texas, for curation.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

This report presents the results of a cultural resources survey for proposed improvements to the
Pickering Basin and the development of the Port of Victoria Industrial Park South located
approximately 10.5 miles south of Victoria in southern Victoria County, Texas. Proposed
improvements to the Pickering Basin include the construction of oil dock piers, ramps, and
mooring dolphins, encompassing an area of potential effects (APE) of approximately 7.6 acres.
The proposed Industrial Park South encompasses an APE of approximately 1,390 acres, which
would be impacted by development of built-to-suit manufacturing and transportation facilities
and related infrastructure.
Due to the potential of the proposed Pickering Basin improvements and the development of the
proposed Industrial Park South to adversely affect cultural resources (i.e., archeological sites and
historic-era buildings and structures), this investigation was conducted by Geo-Marine, Inc.,
under subcontract to CivilCorp Engineers and Surveyors, for the Port of Victoria. The purpose of
this document is to provide data for use in the management of cultural resources in partial
fulfillment of obligations under National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 [42 U.S.C.
§§ 4321–4347; P.L. 91-190; 83 Stat. 852], the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of
1966, as amended through 2000 [16 U.S.C. § 470 et seq.; P.L. 89-665; 80 Stat. 915], and the
Antiquities Code of Texas. Intensive cultural resources investigations were conducted under
Texas Antiquities Permit No. 6812.
Cultural resources investigations consisted of a records search to identify previous cultural
resources surveys conducted in the area and the archeological and historic sites recorded by those
efforts, visual inspection of the project area, and subsurface investigations via the excavation of
backhoe trenches and shovel tests. Fieldwork for this project was conducted on 10 April, 25–27
April, and 5–17 May 2012. Thirteen new archeological sites, 41VT155–41VT167, were
documented, and one previously recorded archeological site, 41VT98, was revisited during this
survey effort. In addition, the location of a family or community cemetery (41VT168) was
documented. Two of the sites (41VT98 and 41VT165) were recorded as having exclusively
prehistoric components and eight (41VT155, 41VT157, 41VT159, 41VT160, 41VT161,
41VT162, 41VT163, and 41VT164) were identified as exclusively historic period sites.
Additionally, four isolates (Isolate 4, Isolate 10, Isolate 11, and Isolate 13) were exclusively
prehistoric in nature while 13 isolates (Isolates 1–3, Isolates 5–9, Isolate 12, and Isolates 14–17)
consisted of historic period items.
v

Site 41VT98 has been previously determined to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. This site
extends into the proposed Industrial Park South APE and is likely to preserve deeply buried
cultural deposits. It is recommended that site 41VT98 be avoided by ground-disturbing activities
or be subjected to additional testing prior to ground-disturbing activities at the site. Site
41VT168, an unnamed historic period cemetery, is also recommended for avoidance. Based on
NHRP eligibility criteria, all remaining sites encountered within the survey areas are
recommended not eligible. Prehistoric site 41VT165 and sites with prehistoric components
(41VT156, 41VT158, 41VT166, and 41VT167) lack artifact assemblages or intact cultural
features that would retain sufficient data to contribute important information regarding prehistoric
technology, settlement-subsistence patterns, or extra-regional interaction. The historic sites
(41VT155, 41VT157, 41VT159, 41VT160, 41VT161, 41VT162, 41VT163, and 41VT164) and
sites with historic period components (41VT158 and 41VT166) either lack verifiable historical
documentation and contextual integrity or offer only redundant data, severely impeding their
ability to yield significant information regarding historic period development and community
patterns in Victoria County.
Proposed improvements to the Pickering Basin and development of the Industrial Park South will
have no adverse effect any significant cultural resources, as defined under 36 CFR 60.4 and TAC
26.8. Provided the project is carried out as proposed, no further cultural resources investigations
are recommended. All artifacts and records associated with this project will be submitted to the
Museum of the Coastal Bend in Victoria, Texas, for curation.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

This report presents the results of a cultural resources survey for proposed improvements to the
Pickering Basin and the development of the Port of Victoria Industrial Park South, located
approximately 16.9 kilometers (km 10.5 miles [mi]) south of Victoria, in southern Victoria
County, Texas (Figure 1). The proposed improvements to the Pickering Basin include the
construction of oil dock piers, ramps, mooring dolphins, and expansion of the Basin
encompassing an area of potential effects (APE) of approximately 7.6 acres (Figure 2). The two
proposed oil dock ramps measure approximately 24.7 meters (m; 81 feet [ft]) in length by 3 m (10
ft) in width. The depth of proposed impacts below the ground surface for ramp construction is
expected to be between 3.6 and 4.2 m (12 and 14 ft). The area projected for the potential
expansion of Pickering Basin is approximately 7 acres, measuring 172-x-165 m (565-x-540-ft).
The proposed Industrial Park South encompasses an APE of approximately 1,390 acres (Figure
3), which would be impacted by development of built-to-suit manufacturing and transportation
facilities and related infrastructure.
Due to the potential impacts of the proposed projects to cultural resource properties (i.e.,
archeological sites and historic-era buildings and structures), Geo-Marine, Inc., was contracted by
CivilCorp Engineers and Surveyors, to conduct an intensive cultural resources survey (GeoMarine, Inc., project number 30694.00.01) of the proposed project areas for the purpose of
recording and providing a preliminary evaluation of cultural resources within the APE, as
required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 [42 U.S.C. §§ 4321–4347;
P.L. 91-190; 83 Stat. 852], the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended
through 2000 [16 U.S.C. § 470 et seq.; P.L. 89-665; 80 Stat. 915], and the Antiquities Code of
Texas. Intensive cultural resources investigations were conducted in April and May 2012 under
Texas Antiquities Permit No. 6812. These investigations consisted of (1) background research
regarding previously recorded cultural resources within the APE and the vicinity; (2) backhoe
trenching adjacent to the Pickering Basin and within the floodplain portion of the proposed
Industrial Park South APEs to determine the potential for deeply buried archeological sites and to
provide geomorphological information regarding the study area; (3) pedestrian reconnaissance of
the project area; (4) systematic shovel testing along the Guadalupe River valley margin and
across the Pleistocene upland portions of the APE; and (4) archival research regarding historic
period sites recorded within the Industrial Park South APE. Fieldwork in the Pickering Basin
portion of the project area was conducted by Project Archeologist Ben Fullerton. Fieldwork in
1

the proposed Industrial Park South project area was conducted by Project Archeologist
Christopher Goodmaster and Field Technicians Cullom, Willi Hermann, Brett Lang, and Megan
Statham. Tanya McDougall conducted archival research focusing on the historic period resources
documented within the project area. Melissa Green served as the project Principal Investigator
throughout the process of this investigation. All artifacts and records associated with this project
will be submitted to the Museum of the Coastal Bend in Victoria, Texas, for curation.

CHAPTER 2
ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT

The proposed project areas are located along the eastern escarpment of the Guadalupe River
valley and the adjacent Pleistocene uplands in southern Victoria County, Texas. Situated within
the Western Gulf Coastal Plain, the topography of the project areas range from nearly level across
portions of the Pleistocene uplands and Guadalupe River floodplain to moderate slopes along the
valley escarpment. The soils of the project area derived from in situ weathering and development
of alluvial and eolian sedimentary deposits. This region is located within the Texan biotic
province (Blair 1950; Dice 1943) and supports a wide variety of flora and fauna.

GEOLOGY
Victoria County is located within the Western Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic region of Texas
(Fenneman 1938; Griffith et al. 2004). This region is characterized by nearly level upland plains
underlain by the unconsolidated sands and clays of the Pleistocene-aged Beaumont and Lissie
formations, whereas the Guadalupe River valley is infilled with clay-rich Holocene alluvium. A
comprehensive investigation of the geological setting encompassing the project areas (McGowen
et al. 1976) provides a detailed interpretation of the geological deposits that occur within the
lower Guadalupe River valley. In general, the project areas are situated within McGowen’s
Holocene–Modern Fluvial System, flanked to the east by deposits derived from a Pleistocene
Fluvial-Deltaic System and to the west by a Pleistocene Fluvial System (McGowen et al.
1976:Figure 4). The geological development of this region is concisely described by Abbott
(2001:12), in reference to an adjacent portion of the Western Gulf Coastal Plain, as representing
“a series of coalescent fluviodeltaic bodies arranged in an offlapped sequence, with interdigitated
and capping eolian, littoral, and estuarine facies making up a relatively minor component of the
lithology.” The influential force propelling this coastal development is the infilling of the Gulf of
Mexico from the Late Cretaceous period to the present, resulting in a series of generally parallel,
seaward-dipping sedimentary deposits transgressing toward the shoreline. The fluvial systems of
the region are largely controlled by glacioeustatic sea level changes, causing the lower reaches of
coastal-bound rivers to entrench their valleys during periods of low sea levels and deposit
sediments within prograding estuary environments created along the coastline during periods of
high sea levels. During intervals of higher sea level, floodplains were created along inland river
courses and result in fluvial terraces during subsequent periods of entrenchment during intervals
7

of low sea level. Fluctuations in sea level are also a driving force in channel meandering and
avulsion processes (Aslan and Blum 1999; Aslan et al. 2005; Makaske 2001; Slingerland and
Smith 2004; Stouthamer and Berendsen 2007; Taha and Anderson 2008). Subsequent reworking
of these sediments, largely by eolian processes during the Pleistocene and Quaternary periods,
has served to obscure evidence of the alluvial processes responsible for their initial deposition.
In the immediate vicinity of the project areas, the underlying geology consists of the Pleistoceneaged Beaumont Formation, one of a series of coastward-dipping fluvial and fluvial-deltaic
deposits that forms the generally level uplands of the Western Gulf Coastal Plain. Characterized
by clayey deposits, relatively well-preserved relict fluvial geomorphic features, prominent
vertisols, and well-developed gilgai microtopography (Nordt et al. 2006, Van Siclen 1985), the
Beaumont Formation is the youngest of these Pleistocene-age deposits, attributed to fluvialdeltaic processes during an interglacial period. Although vertebrate fossils have been recovered
from the Beaumont Formation, the most commonly documented fossils are marine and brackish
water invertebrates such as Rangia cuneata and Ostrea virginica (Deussen 1924; Sellards et al.
1932). The precise geological age of the Beaumont Formation is disputed (Aiuvalasit 2007;
Aronow 1988; Birdseye and Aronow 1991:A223; Blum and Aslan 2006; Blum and Price 1998;
Durbin 1999; Durbin et al. 1997; Gaston 1979; Heinrich 2007; McFarlan 1961; Nordt et al. 2006;
Otvos 1971); however, all estimates predate the earliest generally accepted commencement of
human inhabitation of the region. Thus, the potential for archeological site burial by Holocene
depositional processes is minimal, except in specific landscape settings.
Whereas the Beaumont Formation represents alluvial deposition during periods of relatively high
sea level during Pleistocene interglacial periods, alluvial deposition also occurred during periods
of falling and low sea levels associated with glacial periods. The best-preserved deposits of this
nature are series of alluvial features formed during the last glacial period that are inset into and
form terrace surfaces below the Beaumont Formation. First noted by Barton (1930), these
terraces were formally named the “Deweyville beds” by Bernard (1950) for deposits exposed
along the Sabine River in southeastern Texas. Deweyville terraces exhibit relict channel
dimensions considerably larger than modern river channels and are lower in elevation than the
Beaumont Formation but higher than the modern floodplains. Details regarding the extent,
origin, and significance of the Deweyville terraces has been the subject of considerable
speculation for some time, with Blum and Aslan (2006) providing the most comprehensive
discussion to date.
The Deweyville streams occupied valleys incised into the Beaumont Formation, and these
incision events essentially define the modern river valleys along the coast to this day. Blum and
Aslan (2006:191–194) note that the larger streams along the Texas coast exhibit at least three
suites of Deweyville landforms/deposits that represent streams that were graded to lower sea
levels than modern. The deposits of the Deweyville streams are significantly different from the
Beaumont Formation deposits in that they are predominantly coarse-grained, with fine-textured
sediments largely confined to lenticular channel fills. Laterally extensive vertical accretion facies
(fine-grained deposits) are rare, and in this regard, the Deweyville stream deposits present a stark
contrast to the Beaumont Formation alluvial deposits that are largely fine-grained. Dating of the
Deweyville deposits is ongoing, with the most recent studies suggesting ages ranging from ca.
58,000 to 14,000 years B.C.

8

Within the Guadalupe River valley, the Deweyville terraces have been examined by several
projects. In a paleogeographic study of the lower Guadalupe River valley, Weinstein (1992)
identified the older Deweyville 1 and a younger Deweyville 2 terrace that correlate to the
identification of a High Deweyville (i.e., Deweyville 1) and a Low Deweyville (i.e., Deweyville
2) in the proposed Victoria County Station project area (Tinsley 2010). The chronology of these
deposits was long debated (Blum et al. 1995), but recent dating by optically stimulated
luminescence (OSL) within the valley of the Guadalupe River (Aiuvalasit 2007) dated the High
Deweyville terrace to 50,000–60,000 years ago, and the Deweyville deposits at the Buckeye
Knoll site (41VT98) yielded OSL dates between 49,000 and 53,000 years ago. This correlates
reasonably well with a 52,000 date for High Deweyville terraces along the Nueces River (Durbin
et al. 1997). The ages of these deposits preclude the presence of archeological materials
preserved within intact deposits of Deweyville. However, archeological materials are routinely
recovered in the upper portions of Deweyville deposits (Abbott 2001) where these sediments
have presumably been reworked by eolian and/or slope processes, as they were at both the
Buckeye Knoll (41VT98) and McNeill Ranch (41VT141) sites. A recent study of site formation
processes in Deweyville deposits demonstrates that both localized secondary deposition during
the Holocene and bioturbation processes can bury archeological materials (Aiuvalasit 2007).
The Low Deweyville terrace forms a well-defined constructional alluvial surface below High
Deweyville remnants at the foot of the valley wall. This surface was often incorrectly mapped by
the Bureau of Economic Geology (1975) as Holocene alluvium and McGowen et al. (1976) do
not differentiate Deweyville terraces from Holocene-aged floodplain features (Tinsley 2010).
Unlike the High Deweyville remnants that lack surficial expression as a terrace, the Low
Deweyville deposits exhibit typical terrace morphology of level tread and scarp slopes. Along
the Nueces River, this terrace was identified as the Middle Deweyville and dated by
thermoluminescence (TL) and OSL to 40,000–41,0000 years ago (Durbin et al. 1997).

GEOMORPHOLOGY
The project areas occupy three distinct landscapes. Each of these landscapes contains a unique
suite of landforms with distinct geomorphic histories. The Guadalupe River floodplain in the
vicinity of the project area is relatively flat and underlain by fine-grained Holocene alluvium;
however, some fluvial features are still evident as microtopography. The Guadalupe valley
margin is a gently to moderately sloping escarpment of Deweyville and Beaumont terrace
deposits that have been dissected by several low-order ephemeral drainages. The Pleistocene
uplands occupy the generally level and featureless Beaumont Formation. With the exceptions of
efforts by Abbott (2001) and Weinstien (1992), few large-scale surveys of Gulf Coastal Plain
geomorphology, as it relates to the archeology of the region, have been conducted. Archeological
site contexts within the coastal plain vary significantly, with factors such as paleogeography,
alluvial sedimentation and erosion, eolian deposition, and colluvial deposition affecting the
patterns of past human habitation of the region and the integrity of the archeological record left
by those populations.
The Pickering Basin is located at the northern terminus of the Victoria Barge Canal, an artificial
waterway constructed in the late 1960s extending south along the Guadalupe River floodplain to
San Antonio Bay. The area proposed for Pickering Basin improvements occupies a heavily
modified portion of the upland escarpment adjacent to the Guadalupe River floodplain. Project
area elevations range from approximately 6 m (20 ft) above modern sea level (amsl) at the
9

location of the proposed oil dock ramps to 7–12 m (23–39 ft) amsl at the location of the Pickering
Basin expansion area (Figure 4). Prior to the construction of the Pickering Basin, this area was
the juncture of the Guadalupe River floodplain and a northwest-trending ridge of Deweyville or
Beaumont terrace deposits extending toward the floodplain. Blue Bayou occupied the floodplain
in this area prior to its channelization to the west of the Victoria Barge Canal.
The proposed location of the Industrial Park South expansion spans the Guadalupe River
floodplain, the terrace escarpment, and the uplands (Figures 5 and 6). The floodplain portion of
the project area is generally level and occupies an elevation range of 3.5–6 m (11.5–19.7 ft) amsl.
The Guadalupe valley margin, formed when the Guadalupe River occupied an arcuate channel
against the eastern valley wall during the Deweyville period (Weinstein 1991:Figure 2-7), has
been subsequently eroded into a gently to moderately sloping escarpment of 2–20 percent slopes
across an elevation range of 6–17 m (19.7–56 ft) amsl. Sandy deposits on the escarpment along
the western portion of the escarpment may represent the remnants of a High Deweyville terrace
or eolian deposits mantling the Beaumont Formation. A small, ovoid rise is evident along the toe
slope of the terrace escarpment and may represent a Low Deweyville terrace remnant. In recent
history, Black Bayou extended from the uplands in the eastern portion of the escarpment and
occupied a former channel of the Guadalupe River, feeding Atascosa Lagoon before flowing
south to Hog Bayou. Since the 1950s, Black Bayou has been dammed and channelized, changing
the drainage patterns of floodplain and obscuring the original channel. Atascosa Lagoon, which
once encompassed an area of more than 100 acres, is now represented by a wide, shallow
depression and a small stock tank of less than an acre in size to the southeast of the project area
boundary. The generally level upland portions of the project area occupy an elevation range of
17–20 m (56–65.6 ft) amsl and have been heavily modified by historic and modern agriculture.

SOILS
The proposed project areas are situated across seven soil series and one soil complex (see Figures
4 and 5). All information regarding the soils of the project areas has been synthesized and
summarized from data provided by the Soil Conservation Service (Miller 1982) and the Natural
Resources Conservation Service (NRCS 2012). Clay soils of the Trinity and Meguin series
dominate the floodplain portions of the project area, and the loamy sands and fine sandy loams of
the Kuy and Runge series mantle the valley margin. The uplands are largely composed of the
clay and sandy clay loam soils of the Laewest and Dacosta series; however, the fine sandy loams
of the Telferner series comprise a significant portion of the uplands within the Industrial Park
South project area. The undifferentiated Dacosta-Contee complex is a minor constituent of the
uplands. Typical soil profiles associated with each of these soil units are summarized in Table 1.

HYDROLOGY
The Western Gulf Coastal Plain landscape is traversed from northwest to southeast by the lowgradient alluvial valleys of the Frio, San Antonio, Guadalupe, Lavaca, Colorado, Brazos, San
Jacinto, and Trinity rivers. The proposed project areas are located within and adjacent to the
Guadalupe River valley, approximately 5 km (3.1 mi) downstream from the confluence of the
Guadalupe River and Coleto Creek. The Pickering Basin project area is situated approximately
2.1 km (1.3 mi) northeast of the modern Guadalupe River channel, whereas the Industrial Park
South project area is situated between 0.5 and 1 km (0.3 and 0.6 mi) northeast of the modern
channel. Prior to its channelization during construction of the Victoria Barge Canal, Blue Bayou

occupied the floodplain to the west of what is now the Pickering Basin. Atascosa Lagoon, a
naturally occurring water body that occupied an abandoned meander channel of the Guadalupe
River, extended into the Industrial Park South project area during the early period of European
settlement in the area. The lagoon was documented on early land plats of the area, but
channelization of local drainages and agricultural practices have largely drained the feature and
obscured its original location. Lin Lake, another natural water body occupying an abandoned
meander of the river, is located approximately 3.4 km (2.1 mi) southwest of the Industrial Park
South project area.
Several channels drain the upland escarpment within the Industrial Park South project area,
including one historically identified as Black Bayou. Many of these drainages have been
dammed to create stock tanks along the escarpment and channelized within the floodplain.
Likewise, two unnamed drainages spanning the upland portion of the Industrial Park South
project area have been extensively modified through channelization and modern agricultural
practices.

FLORA
The vegetation patterns within the project areas have been severely altered from their natural
states by modern agriculture and industrialization. Aerial photographs of the project areas
indicate that the majority of the area has been timbered and converted for use as cropland,
pasture, and industrial development during the twentieth century. In addition to modern
agricultural and industrial land use, other vegetation types were observed in the project areas.
Several areas composed of upland savannah-like characteristics exhibited intermittent dispersal of
dense live oak (Quercus virginiana) mottes, with mustang grapes (Vitis mustangensis)
encroaching many of the mature trees, and ground cover dominated by stinging nettle (Urtica
dioica) and bluebonnet (Lupinus subcarnosus). In some areas, honey mesquite (Prosopis
glandulosa), huisache (Acacia farnesiana), and sugarberry (Celtis laevigata) dominate the
hardwood uplands, with Cherokee rose (Rosa laevigata) encroaching on many of the mature
trees. Hardwood bottomlands within the Industrial Park South project area are dominated by
pecan (Carya illinoinensis), sugarberry, cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia), chinaberry (Melia
azedarach), and huisache, with mustang grape, palmetto (Sabal spp.), and Cherokee rose ground
cover. A significant portion of the Industrial Park South project area is covered by immature
huisache and honey mesquite brushland, likely because these areas were agriculturally abandoned
in the recent past.

FAUNA
The Western Gulf Coastal Plain supports a wide variety of fauna. Mammals include whitetail
deer (Odocoileus virginianus), beaver (Castor Canadensis), armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus),
raccoon (Procyon lotor), opossum (Didelphis marsupialis), gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus),
and rabbit (Sylvilagus spp.). Birds residing in the area include herons (Ardea spp.), ducks (Anas
spp.), geese (Branta spp.), turkey vultures (Cathartes aura), hawks (Accipiter spp.), and owls
(Strigidae spp.). Several species of snakes, lizards, frogs, and turtles are among the reptiles and
amphibians living within the region. Some of the aquatic species native to the area are gar
(Lepisosteus spp.), gafftopsail catfish (Bagre marinus), eel (Anguilla spp.), clam (Rangia
cuneata), eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica), and several mussel species (McGuff 1978;
White et al. 1989).

CLIMATE
The modern climate across the Western Gulf Coastal Plain is a function of proximity to the Gulf
of Mexico. The climate of the region is Subtropical Humid (Bomar 1995; Larkin and Bomar
1983), characterized by warm to hot and dry summers and mild winters. Temperatures are
modulated by southeasterly, warm, moisture-laden winds from the Gulf of Mexico. Cold, highpressure Canadian air masses from the north result in cool weather and rainfall across the region
in winter (Miller 1982). Average low temperatures range from approximately 15–21° Celsius (C;
59–70° Fahrenheit [F]), while average high temperatures range from 27–29° C (81–84° F).
Precipitation across the region is generally bimodal, with peaks occurring in the fall (September–
October) due to tropical disturbances and occasional hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, and as
slow gentle rains and thundershowers in the spring (April–June).

CHAPTER 3
CULTURAL CONTEXT

INTRODUCTION
This chapter presents a brief synopsis, based on regional archeology, of Native American cultural
chronology and Euro-American history of the central Texas coast culture area. Given the size of
the region and the depth and breadth of cultural complexity that has developed in the area, this
discussion must necessarily be limited in scope. References are provided to supplement the
information summarized here.

NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURAL CONTEXT
The central Texas coast culture area is typically defined as extending from the Colorado River
south to the northern reaches of Baffin Bay (Ricklis 2004). The following brief discussion of the
prehistoric archeological record of the region draws from previous summaries by Black (1989),
Campbell (1960), Ricklis (1995, 2004), and Weinstein (1992).
Thomas N. Campbell (1960) first synthesized the prehistoric archeology of the central and lower
Texas coasts, creating a two-part chronology: the pre-ceramic Archaic Aransas focus, followed
by the Late Prehistoric Rockport focus using artifact typologies and apparent stratigraphic
relationships. Campbell’s taxonomic designations, however, were created without chronometric
information derived from radiocarbon dating. In the decades since Campbell’s synthesis, there
has been a significant increase in archeological research efforts along the central Texas coast
resulting in new attempts to organize and synthesize regional archeological data. Following
Campbell’s original framework, Stephen L. Black (1989) elaborated the taxonomic cultural
sequence of the central Texas coast by defining a series of phases to characterize shorter temporal
intervals focused on the latter half of the region’s prehistory. Recent work by Richard Weinstein
(1992) and Robert A. Ricklis (2004, 2007, 2011) seek to further expand and elaborate the
prehistoric cultural chronology of the central Texas coast. A generalized cultural sequence of the
region is outlined in Table 2.

Paleoindian Period (ca. 10,000–6500 B.C.)
The Texas coastal region underwent dramatic changes in geomorphology throughout the late
Pleistocene and early Holocene. By the peak of glaciation within the Pleistocene (ca. 20,000
B.C.), sea levels were at least 100 m (328 ft) below current levels. Global warming trends ca.
18,000 years ago triggered sea level increases, which by 9,000 years ago allowed for the initial
formation of the modern bay systems of the central Texas coast (Brown et al. 1976; McGowan et
al. 1976). Evidence suggests human migration into the region by approximately 10,000 B.C.,
although the exact timing and nature of the arrival is the subject of some dispute. Due to the
dynamic nature of the Texas coast during the early Holocene, evidence of Paleoindian archeology
is sparse on the central Texas coast and primarily consists of isolated, scattered finds.

18

Despite the lack of good data relating to the Paleoindian period along the central Texas coast,
some attempts have been made to generalize settlement mobility and intensity of site occupation,
drawing on the limited data that are known and on assumptions based on comparisons with other
areas. The people of this period are often characterized as living in small bands of highly mobile
hunter-gatherers, specializing in the hunting of now-extinct Pleistocene megafauna using
thrusting spears with distinctive fluted Clovis-style projectile points. A number of researchers
have seen evidence for a high degree of group mobility in the broad distribution of Paleoindian
artifacts over the landscape and in the variety of presumably nonlocal lithic raw materials from
which they were made (Meltzer and Smith 1986; Shafer 1977; Story 1990:177). Likewise, the
well-documented exploitation of large megafauna by Paleoindians in the western United States
has resulted in the popular conclusion that “big game hunting” was the hallmark of the
Paleoindian subsistence strategy. Increasing evidence suggests that Paleoindian groups were less
dependent upon big game hunting than has been assumed in the past. A more accurate view of
Paleoindian life likely included use of a much wider array of resources (Ferring 1989). Later in
the Early Paleoindian period, Folsom culture subsistence strategies appear to have focused on
hunting bison (Bison antiquus), which would have required a high degree of mobility
accompanied by low population densities (Amick 1996). These populations, however, likely
supplemented their diet with other sources of game (e.g., deer and pronghorn), as well as plant
species (Peter and Weston 1993).
The late Paleoindian period generally appears to be distinguished by the divergence of the earlier,
widespread fluted point tradition into several distinct subtraditions. Like earlier periods of the
Paleoindian stage, the Late Paleoindian period continued to rely on large game. Extinction (or
evolution) of Bison antiquus, however, leads to the focus on modern bison (Bison bison). Some
Late Paleoindian sites also show evidence of use of other animal species. At the Hinds Cave site
in Val Verde County, Texas, the largest proportion (42 percent) of faunal material came from
deer (Lord 1984). A significant amount of smaller vertebrate material was discovered at the site
as well (Lord 1984; Shafer and Bryant 1977). This subsistence strategy is supported by similar
evidence at the Horn Shelter No. 2 site near the Brazos River in Bosque County, Texas, where
skeletal remains from many small animals (e.g., bird, reptile, and small mammal) were found in
association with bison bones (Forrester 1985). In the vicinity of the project area, the Berger Bluff
site (41GD30) appears to display this expanded resource exploitation strategy (Hester et al. 1989;
Weinstein 1992), where bones from small animals such as rabbit, gopher, turtle, fish, and bird
were found in association with Paleoindian living surfaces (Brown 2006).
Late Paleoindian period sites in the region have yielded a variety of point types. Absent are the
fluted point types of the Clovis and Folsom periods, having been replaced by unfluted, lanceolate
projectile points. The Buckner Ranch site (41BE2), for example, produced Plainview,
Golondrina, Angostura, and Scottsbluff points. Meserve points were recovered with Plainview
and Angostura examples at the Morhiss Mound site (41VT1) (Campbell 1976). At the Miller site
(41VT5), Gower and Bell points were recovered in conjunction with other Late Paleoindian types
(Hester 1980). A comprehensive inventory of artifacts found at the Buckeye Knoll site
(41VT98), in the immediate vicinity of the project areas, has not been published, but preliminary
reports indicate the presence of Angostura among other Late Paleoindian point types (Ricklis and
Doran 2003). Typically, the Late Paleoindian period is associated with increased regionalization;
however, Weinstein (1992) also suggests that point type variation seen at some coastal Texas
region sites may reflect chronological differences. However, the Johnson and J-2 Ranch phases
defined within the Late Paleoindian subperiod (Weinstein 1992:59–60) are tentative constructs
based on evidence from a single site each and therefore require supporting evidence from
additional sites before these proposed phases provide interpretive utility.
19

Archaic Period (ca. 6500 B.C.–A.D. 1000)
With the end of Pleistocene glaciation, the prehistoric residents of the region began to develop
into populations of efficient hunter-gatherers exploiting localized resource bases. This period,
and the subsistence pattern that characterizes it, has become termed the “Archaic” period.
Representing a significant period of time (over 7,000 years), this period is characterized by
gradual changes in subsistence patterns, lithic technology, and projectile point styles. The
Archaic period marks the beginning of a more sedentary lifestyle on the central Texas coast.
Archaic populations are usually portrayed as generalized hunters and gatherers with more limited
geographic ranges than the preceding Paleoindian peoples. Local resource use became more
intensive and the material culture displayed much greater diversity, as marked by the appearance
of grinding tools, roasting ovens, rock-lined hearths, and a variety of notched and stemmed
projectile points (Collins 2004). As bison became less available, other resources, including plants
and smaller animal species, were exploited more intensively. Broadly speaking, the archeological
sites dated to this period are larger and more numerous, suggesting a growing human population.
As is true for many areas, a threefold division of the Archaic period, consisting of early, middle,
and late subperiods, has been applied in the region. Dates regarding the Archaic stage
subdivisions vary by area and author (e.g., Black 1989; Collins 2004; Hester 2004; Ricklis 2004;
Ricklis and Doran 2003; Weinstein 1992), but the changes between subperiods are generally
marked by differences in subsistence strategy and projectile point typology (Hofman 1989).

Early Archaic (ca. 6500–4000 B.C.)
The coastal Texas region experienced a rise in sea level as the climate began its transition from
the anathermal to the warmer and wetter altithermal (Frazier 1974). This may have led to
increased shellfish exploitation, particularly oysters (Crassostrea virginica), in substitute of large
game (Ricklis 2004). Within the central Texas coast, Early Archaic projectile points such as
Gower, Wells, Bell, Andice, and Uvalde have been found (Gadus et al. 1993; Weinstein 1992).
Unfortunately, these finds have been in mostly surficial contexts and good dates are not available
for this period in the region (Fox and Hester 1976; Gadus et al. 1993; Weinstein 2002).
Consequently, the dates provided for this region’s Early Archaic period are based on similarities
in point morphologies with dated materials in Central Texas (Weinstein 1992, 2002).

Middle Archaic (ca. 4000–2000 B.C.)
The Middle Archaic brought sea level stabilization and increased exploitation of coastal resources
in the region (Ricklis and Blum 1997) with the extension of the San Antonio estuary system
farther north than in previous periods (Prewitt and Paine 1988; Weinstein 1992). Sites with
Middle Archaic components are slightly more numerous than earlier periods. As with the Early
Archaic, many Middle Archaic sites in the region lack secure radiocarbon dates (Gadus et al.
1993). Consequently, temporal estimates for this period are inferred based on point type
chronologies developed in Central Texas (Hester 1980). Generally, the Middle Archaic across
the Texas coast is marked by the proliferation of triangular dart points (Hester 1980). Middle
Archaic projectile point types found in the area include Bulverde, Nolan, Travis, Palmillas,
Pedernales, Kinney, and Tortugas styles (Weinstein 2002). At the nearby Buckeye Knoll site,
early triangular and Refugio dart points were discovered with evidence of short-term occupation
(Ricklis and Doran 2003). Both the Blue Bayou (41VT94) and Sentinel Oak (41VT79) sites have
20

been tentatively associated with the Middle Archaic subperiod (Weinstein 1992). Dated oyster
reef deposits collected 4.8 km (3 mi) north of Green Lake indicate that by the end of the Middle
Archaic, productive estuary resource systems were well established for the lower Guadalupe
River valley (Weinstein 1992). With the gradual stabilization of sea levels and establishment of
active estuary systems throughout the Middle Archaic, the central Texas coast likely became a
more predictable environment for the procurement of marine and brackish-water fish and
mollusks. Throughout this period, Pleistocene terraces were the preferred locations for habitation
sites.

Late Archaic (ca. 2000 B.C.–A.D. 1000)
In the early part of the Late Archaic subperiod, a rapid rise in sea level took place, but returned to
a stable, modern level by the middle Late Archaic (Prewitt and Paine 1988; Ricklis and Blum
1997). The number of archeological sites attributed to the Late Archaic period on the central
Texas coast is substantially greater than for previous periods. The number of sites in estuarine
habitats increases dramatically during the Late Archaic. It has been suggested the combination of
sea level stabilization, increase in river sediments, and the gradual formation of Matagorda Island
would have acted to reduce salinity of the San Antonio Bay system, thereby increasing the
productivity of oysters and other estuarine resources (Nelson and Bray 1970; Pearson et al. 1986)
and leading to an increase in local populations. Concomitantly, evidence of Late Archaic
subsistence is dominated by fish species—black drum, redfish, spotted sea trout, and Atlantic
croaker—whose annual cycle is tied to estuary bay systems (Ricklis 2004). Although fishing
appears to be a primary subsistence strategy during this period along coastal Texas, the presence
of projectile points and mammal faunal material indicates that hunting was not abandoned in the
Late Archaic (Ricklis and Blum 1997). Late Archaic projectile point types common to the area
include Marshall, Williams, Castroville, Ensor, Darl, and Fairland dart points (Weinstein 2002).
From Morhiss Mound, Late Archaic diagnostic material includes Morhiss, Marshall, Lange,
Marcos, Darl, Ensor, and Fairland projectile points (Campbell 1976; Suhm and Krieger 1954) and
Campbell (1976) suggests that the majority of the burials from Morhiss Mound were interred
during the Late Archaic period. Pedernales, Morhiss, Lange, Fairland, and Ensor style projectile
points were among the artifacts recovered from the nearby Buckeye Knoll site. In addition, the
site produced several hearths and a formal cemetery dating to the Late Archaic (Ricklis 2011;
Ricklis and Doran 2003).
In addition to the increased reliance upon estuarine resources, the archeology of the Late Archaic
reveals a diverse shell tool industry and evidence of basketry (Campbell 1947, 1952; Ricklis
1990, 2004). Although perforated oyster shell and edge-flaked clamshell scrapers are known
from the Early Archaic and continue to be found in later periods, the use of conch shell for tools
appears to begin only in the Late Archaic (Campbell 1952; Ricklis 1990, 2004). Additionally, the
number of bone artifacts (e.g., awls, socketed points) increases dramatically in the archeological
record of the Late Archaic. As the central Texas coast estuary bay systems began to increase its
biotic productivity throughout the Late Archaic, areas such as the lower Guadalupe River valley
possibly began to offer more opportunities for prehistoric activities. In addition to the continued
use of existing site locations (e.g., Morhiss Mound and Buckeye Knoll) in the region during the
Late Archaic, other areas (both upriver and downriver) were for the first time associated with
significant increases in prehistoric populations. The increase in both the number of sites and use
of estuarine resources is a trend that continues into the Late Prehistoric period.
21

Late Prehistoric (ca. A.D. 1000–1700)
Using a socio-cultural evolutionary taxonomic system, the end of the Late Archaic period on the
central Texas coast, like the remainder of the state, is marked by the widespread adoption of the
bow and arrow and ceramics (Hester 1975, 1981; Suhm and Krieger 1954). Based on changes in
artifact types and suspected shifts in subsistence practices, the Late Prehistoric period for the
central Texas coast has been divided into various phases by several authors. Weinstein (1992:63–
65) subdivided the period between A.D. 700 and A.D. 1700 into a Late Prehistoric period and a
tentative Protohistoric period, with the former period further divided into two phases (Blue Bayou
[A.D. 700–950] and Anaqua [A.D. 950–1150]) and the later (A.D. 1150–1700) divided into an
inland (Berclair phase) and a coastal (Rockport phase) geographic expressions. Ricklis (2004),
conversely, has proposed only two subperiods spanning the Late Prehistoric interval: the Initial
Late Prehistoric (ca. A.D. 1000–1250/1300) and the Final Late Prehistoric (ca. A.D. 1250/1300–
1700).
The Initial Late Prehistoric phase along the central Texas coast is characterized by Scallorn and
Fresno arrow points along with plain, sandy paste ceramics similar to Goose Creek of the upper
Texas coast (Ricklis 2004; Weinstein 1992). By the Final Late Prehistoric phase, Perdiz arrow
points predominate along with a prismatic blade technology, thin bifacial knives, and Rockport
sandy paste ceramics (Fritz 1975; Ricklis 1996). Rockport ceramics are quite distinctive because
many have asphaltum decorations and were produced in a variety of shapes (e.g., bowls, jars, and
ollas) (Ricklis 1996).
Fishing continued to be a major focus of subsistence in the Late Prehistoric period and was
possibly of even greater importance than in the Late Archaic (Ricklis 1990, 1996; Weinstein
1992). At several sites (e.g., 41CL2) along the central Texas coast, Late Prehistoric fish-rich
middens are stratigraphically above Late Archaic shell middens, suggesting a possible shift in
resource selection (Weinstein 1992). Additionally, by A.D. 1250/1300, bison became a significant
resource for the region as numerous upland hunting camps, such as 41RF21, have been dated to
this period (Ricklis 1989, 1990, 1996). The abundance of subsistence data gathered from Late
Prehistoric sites has made it possible to address issues of seasonality and group migration.
Analysis of fish otolith data from large shoreline sites has shown that the most important species
(black drum and redfish) were collected during the fall through early spring periods (Ricklis
1988, 1990, 1996). Additional data from Rangia cuneata shells in river margin sites have
revealed late spring through summer occupations (Aten 1981; Carlson 1988; Ricklis 2004).
Collectively, these data along with site size information suggest large aggregations of groups
occurred during the fall and winter months along the coast, followed by a late spring and summer
dispersal of smaller groups into upland river margin settings. Ricklis (1990, 1992, 1996), using
archival sources, has suggested similar seasonality patterns existed within the early historic
period Karankawa along the central Texas coast.
Late Prehistoric sites occupy a range of settings from the upper reaches of San Antonio Bay to
just north of Victoria along the Guadalupe River. Some of the major sites from earlier periods
(e.g., Morhiss Mound, Sentinel Oak, Buckeye Knoll) have very small Late Prehistoric
components, but others (e.g., the Linn Lake [41VT81] and Blue Bayou sites) either continued or
took on greater significance during the Late Prehistoric period (Weinstein 1992). The larger sites
for this period appear to be near the coast and appear to have operated as large aggregation
centers for winter fishing. One such aggregation center is the Guadalupe Bay (41CL2) site.
Although first established in the Late Archaic, the Guadalupe Bay site has a significant Late
22

Prehistoric component composed of Rockport ceramics, Fresno arrow points, and large amounts
of faunal material. Smaller sites for this period are those located upstream along upland settings,
often at the river margin. Many of the smaller upland sites are indicative of hunting camps such
as the Mellon site (41RF21), which yielded concentrations of deer and bison bone (Ricklis 2004).
Settlement patterns appear to have changed by the Late Prehistoric, whereby the larger sites
upstream along the river margin such as Buckeye Knoll and Morhiss Mound were largely
abandoned, as large aggregation sites along the coastal edge, such as Guadalupe Bay, became
prevalent. At the same time that upland sites such as Morhiss Mound were falling out of use,
many more were being created upstream along the river margin as short-term hunting/fishing
camps. In some cases, sites that were active in earlier periods such as Linn Lake appear to be the
focus of hunting and possible trade activities well into the historic period (Hester 1985; Weinstein
1992).

Early Historic Period (ca. A.D. 1700–1800)
The current review is limited to the earliest component of the established historic record and
focuses solely on sites with primarily indigenous components; however, few sites in the region
meet these criteria. Subsistence and seasonality data from the early historic period are severely
lacking and currently restrict our understanding of indigenous adaptation for the central Texas
coast during the first few centuries of European interaction. Multicomponent sites Blue Bayou
and Linn Lake both contain early European artifacts; additionally, a glass Guerrero-style
projectile point was found at Linn Lake (Hester 1985). Downstream in the Green Lake vicinity,
Spanish artifacts have been recovered at several sites (41CL77, 41CL7, and 41CL2) that are
believed to have been associated with the late eighteenth-century Mission Nuestra Señora de
Refugio or one of its associated ranches. Although the original location of this mission is not
known, it is has been suggested that site 41CL10 may in fact represent its eighteenth-century
location (Henson 1992).

HISTORIC CONTEXT

European Exploration and Early Settlement
The first European explorers reached the vicinity now encompassed by Victoria County during
the early sixteenth century. In 1528, Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, traversed the area but made
no attempt at permanent settlement. More than a century later, in 1685, René Robert Cavelier,
Sieur de La Salle, established Fort St. Louis, on behalf of France, on the west bank of Garcitas
Creek. The Spanish government soon took exception to French encroachments in the Gulf Coast
area. On 14 April 1689, Alonso de León discovered the Guadalupe River while on a mission
from the Spanish government to find and destroy Fort St. Louis. Father Damián Massanet, who
accompanied the expedition, named the river in honor of the patron saint of Mexico. De León
ultimately discovered that Fort St. Louis had been abandoned, with its colonists fallen victim
either to disease or to armed engagements with local Native American tribes (Morris 1953:n.p.;
Roell 1990:126).

23

In 1722, Presidio Nuestra Señora de Loreto, built on the ruins of Fort St. Louis at Garcitas Creek,
marked the first Spanish settlement in what became Victoria County. On the east bank of the
creek in what is now Jackson County, Mission Nuestra Señora del Espíritu Santo de Zúñiga (La
Bahía) was established (Morris 1953:n.p.), but both the mission and presidio were moved to the
Guadalupe River in August 1726. The Spanish built a dam across the river and added an
irrigation system to supply nearby agricultural fields. The area around the mission became
known as Mission Valley, an appellation it has retained (Morris 1953:n.p.). The mission and
presidio moved again in 1749, this time to the San Antonio River in present-day Goliad County.
Despite the relocations, the settlers enjoyed stability and prosperity by cultivating crops and
producing enough hay and corn to export their surplus to San Antonio and settlements in East
Texas. The mission also raised livestock, and an 1858 inventory listed 3,220 branded cattle, 120
horses, and 1,600 sheep (Roell 1990:126).
After La Bahía moved to the San Antonio River in 1749, no further permanent settlement
occurred in Victoria County other than isolated individual holdings, such as Carlos de la Garza’s
rancho at Anaqua and Margaret Wright’s homestead at Mission Valley (Roell 1990:126). In
1821, Mexico won its independence from Spain. The newly formed Mexican government
retained control over the vast holdings in what is now the American Southwest, including Texas.
Three years later, Don Martín de León successfully petitioned the Mexican government to
establish a colony on the Texas gulf coastal plain. The colony encompassed all of the territory of
present-day Victoria and Calhoun counties, as well as parts of Lavaca, Jackson, and DeWitt
counties. The center of government for the colony was the Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe de
Jesús Victoria settlement. Soon known as Guadalupe Victoria, the community prospered, with a
population of approximately 300 in 1834.
In 1824, the government of Mexico approved a charter petitioned by Don Martín de León to
establish a colony of 41 families between the Guadalupe and Lavaca rivers. The De León Colony
settled in what is now present day Victoria. Each colonist received a town lot, one league (4,228
acres) and one labor (177 acres; Roell 2012). Early General Land Office (GLO) maps of presentday Victoria County show land grants patented in the 1830s to numerous individuals with
Spanish surnames. In 1833, Polito Castillo, a colonist of the De León Colony, was granted 4,428
acres of land on the west bank of the Guadalupe River approximately 7.5 miles south of Victoria,
which coincides with the proposed Industrial Park South project area (GLO 2012). In that same
year, Polito Castillo sold the entire league of land to Philip Dimitt, who owned the land until his
death in ca. 1845.
The Texas Revolution began in 1836, and the nearby towns of Victoria and Goliad became
crucial points in the Revolution. Goliad was the later name of the former Spanish presidio La
Bahía, and it stood 26 miles west of the town of Victoria. Representing the northeastern point of
defense for the Texas revolution, James W. Fannin, Jr., commanded 500 soldiers at Goliad.
While determining what move to make in support of the revolution in early 1836, Fannin received
orders from Maj. Gen. Sam Houston to march to San Antonio to assist the Texan soldiers at the
Alamo. Houston soon rescinded the orders, however, and commanded Fannin to meet with other
troops in Victoria. Fannin, concerned that Goliad might be attacked, did not leave immediately.
When he finally headed his troops toward Victoria, they soon encountered Gen. José de Urrea of
the Mexican Army. Outnumbered, Fannin surrendered, believing that his troops would be treated
properly as prisoners of war. He and his troops were marched back to Goliad, however,
whereupon Mexican President Santa Anna ordered their execution.
24

After the declaration of Texas independence, Victoria County stood among the original 23
counties established by the First Congress of the Republic of Texas in March 1836, and three
years later, the city of Victoria became the third city to receive a formal charter by the republic.
John J. Linn, an Irish immigrant and member of one of the original 41 families of Guadalupe
Victoria, served as a delegate to the convention in which Texas declared its independence and
established the Republic of Texas. Linn not only served in the republic’s congress and helped to
draft the new nation’s constitution, but also was Victoria’s first mayor (Hammonds 1999:11;
Roell 1990:127; Shook 1990:113). Although the de Leóns and other Hispanic settlers in
Guadalupe Victoria supported the Texans in their bid for independence, most were ostracized
after the war and forced to flee. Anglo-Americans eventually resettled the area (Hammonds
1999:9, 11–12; Roell 1990:127; Shook 1990:113).
After Texas voters approved an annexation ordinance and state constitution, Texas joined the
United States in 1845, with formal transfer of government taking place the following February.
The same year, the Texas legislature settled conflicting territorial claims among Victoria, La
Vaca, Jackson, and Calhoun counties, and Victoria County’s boundaries were finalized to its
present configuration (Roell 1990:127).

Nineteenth-century Development
Victoria County was a crossroads for southern Texas long before statehood had been established.
A cart road extended from the port at Indianola to San Antonio and New Braunfels, and the old
Goliad Road traversed from east to west. Located alongside the Guadalupe River, the city of
Victoria strove to secure its position as a trade center. In 1840, the county commissioners
approved rates for a municipal ferry across the river. A toll bridge, built by Richard Owens and
Sylvester Sutton, followed in 1851 (Roell 1990:127). Both Kemper’s Bluff and White’s Ferry,
also in Victoria County, posed the most serious competition to Victoria as trade centers and
embarkation points (Roell 1990:127). Situated along the Guadalupe River, Kemper’s Bluff stood
north of the present site of the McFaddin community, while nearby White’s Ferry was a short
distance southeast and downriver at the confluence of the Guadalupe and Old rivers.
The competition among the river towns reflected the Guadalupe River’s early supremacy in
creating trade routes. The 255-mile-long river rises in Kerr County and flows into San Antonio
Bay, and its tributaries include the Blanco, Comal, and San Marcos rivers. The Guadalupe joins
the San Antonio River at the southeast corner of Victoria County (Morris 1953:n.p.). The
legislature of Coahuila and Texas attempted to improve the river’s navigability in 1828, 1833,
and 1835, but the Texas revolution foiled these efforts. The Republic of Texas authorized
improvements in 1840, and Victoria devoted one-fourth of the proceeds from the sale of its public
lands for this purpose. The Texas state legislature authorized further work in 1853 (Morris
1953:n.p.; Roell 1990:127).
Construction of the San Antonio & Mexican Gulf Railroad from Victoria to Port Lavaca in 1861
marked the decline of river dominance in transportation. During the Civil War, Confederate
General John B. Magruder rendered the Guadalupe River impassable by sinking boats and trees
to prevent Federal troops from using the waterway. Magruder ordered destruction of the railroad
tracks as well, but these were rebuilt immediately after the war. The Guadalupe River, on the
other hand, fell out of use until the 1880s. Storm and flood damage to the port town of Indianola
in 1875 and 1886 further hampered efforts to resume river commerce (Morris 1953:n.p.; Roell
1990:128).
25

Victoria County voted for secession in 1861 and approximately 300 male residents served with
the Confederate Army. Camp Henry E. McCulloch was established about 4 miles from Victoria
under the command of Colonel R. R. Garland. The county also functioned as a transportation,
military, and supply center through the early years of the Civil War. The city of Victoria stood on
the Cotton Road, which provided access to guns, ammunition, medicine, and supplies from
Mexico in exchange for crops. Confederate troops withdrew from the area following Magruder’s
order in 1863 to destroy navigation on the Guadalupe River and the tracks of the San Antonio &
Mexican Gulf railroad (Hammonds 1999:14–15; Victoria Sesquicentennial, Inc., 1974:51).
Major General David S. Stanley arrived in July 1865 with Federal troops to occupy the city, thus
beginning the Reconstruction period. In addition to ruined transportation routes, the county
suffered extensive economic losses as a result of the Civil War, with the value of all property
declining from $3,088,476 in 1860 to $1,503,295 in 1870. The 1860 property enumeration
included considerable value that was embodied by the county’s 1,413 slaves, but the 1870s
census did not include slaves as property (Hammonds 1999:14–15; Roell 1990:128).
The agricultural economy that had depended on slave labor for much of its profitability had to be
reconstituted. For the short term, labor-intensive cotton was abandoned in favor of raising cattle
and other livestock. Production figures for 1870 showed that only 205 bales of cotton were
produced, while the number of cattle grew to 61,651 (Roell 1990:129). A growing manufacturing
base also developed, with the number of manufacturing establishments increasing from 10 to 25
by 1870. Reflective of the local agricultural economy, one of the area’s first meat-packing plants
was established in 1869. An ample labor supply could be drawn from freed African Americans,
migrants from other parts of the United States, and European immigrants. Since the 1840s,
German immigrants had been arriving in Victoria County, many of them lured by the German
Immigration Society and seeking relief from the revolutions and oppression of their native
country. Italians provided a substantial portion of the labor for railroad construction and often
settled permanently in Victoria (Hammonds 1999:11; Roell 1990:127, 129; Shook 1990:115).
Victoria’s strategic geographic location and transportation routes provided the basis for the
county’s economic resurgence after Reconstruction ended. The city’s bridge across the
Guadalupe River was rebuilt as early as 1865 by Jessie Obadiah Wheeler. By 1873, the Gulf,
Western Texas & Pacific Railroad connected Victoria with Cuero and the coast, and in 1882, the
New York, Texas & Mexican Railroad provided the first cross-country route. These lines, as well
as the old Goliad and Indianola roads and the city’s status as county seat, made Victoria the
logical focal point for shipping and commercial activity for both Victoria and surrounding
counties (Hammonds 1999:15; Roell 1990:129). Improved transportation also spurred more
development in the city. For example, in 1882, A. de Rollepot established an ice manufactory in
Victoria. Local ranchers seized on the opportunity, and the following year, James McFaddin,
along with Thomas M. O’Connor, G. A. Levi, Leo N. Levi, J. M. Mathis, Tobe Wood, and others,
founded the Texas Continental Meat Company. With a capital of $1 million, the joint stock
company’s mission was to use the manufactured ice to run refrigerated train cars filled with fresh
meat to eastern cities (Petty 1961:75–76). The history of cattle ranching in the region earned
Victoria County the nickname “Cradle of the Texas Cattle Industry” (Hammonds 1999:19).

CONCLUSIONS
Although the body of knowledge regarding central Texas coast archeology has grown greatly in
recent decades, it is still poorly understood overall. The prehistory of the region was intricately
tied to its slowly evolving estuary systems and resulting changes in biotic productivity. As sea
26

levels began to reach modern levels ca. 3,000 years ago, prehistoric settlement along the central
Texas coast began to increase. During the Paleoindian and Early–Middle Archaic periods, sites
predominate along river margin settings. Middle Archaic–Early Historic period sites, such as
Linn Lake, attest to the long-term suitability of this area for prehistoric habitation, with increased
use of bay/shoreline localities as estuarine productivity developed. Historically, settlement along
the central Texas coast was intrinsically tied to water courses such as the Guadalupe River, much
like the preceding prehistoric periods. Early mission settlements and later ranches and
homesteaders were closely tied to the Guadalupe River and its tributary systems. Postbellum
settlement of the region continued to focus on waterways, and the rapidly developing road
system.

CHAPTER 4
METHODOLOGY

The cultural resources survey recorded in this document was designed to identify both prehistoric
and historic archeological sites and important architectural resources located within the proposed
project areas. This work was undertaken with two primary management goals:
1. To locate cultural resources occurring within the designated survey areas
2. To assess the significance of each resource in regard to its potential for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or designation as a State Archeological
Landmark (SAL)
The first of these goals was accomplished by a program of background and archival research,
intensive pedestrian survey, and excavations undertaken using the field methods described in this
chapter. The second goal consists of assessment and evaluation based on National Register of
Historic Places criteria defined in 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) §60.4 (National Park
Service 1990) and the Antiquities Code of Texas.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Although some important archeological sites in the Guadalupe River valley were initially
documented in the early 1880s (Morhiss Mound [41VT1] and the Peach Knoll [41VT89] site
[Rose 1883:9]), professional archeological investigations in the region were not initiated until the
early 1930s. A. M. Woolsey surveyed sections of the Guadalupe River valley in 1932 (Campbell
1976; Weinstein 1992). Woolsey’s work included surveys of the lower Guadalupe River from
San Antonio Bay to Green Lake, recording and testing a series of shell midden sites (Weinstein
1992). At that time, Woolsey also surveyed and tested the Morhiss Mound site along the
Guadalupe River, just north of Coleto Creek (Campbell 1976). Further excavation of Morhiss
Mound was performed as part of a 16-month Works Progress Administration (WPA) project that
began in 1938 (Duffen 1940). During the later portion of the twentieth century, the activities of
local vocational archeologists, university graduate students and research staff, and professional
cultural resources management firms have contributed to documenting archeological sites and
synthesizing the history and prehistory of the region.

29

To determine the extent and intensity of previous cultural resources survey efforts as well as the
locations of previously recorded historic or archeological resources in the vicinity of the project
areas, the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas online database maintained by the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) was consulted, as well as background literature and cultural resources
management reports from the region. Review of these records indicated that eight previous
cultural resources surveys have been conducted within a 1.6-km (1-mi) radius of the proposed
project area (Figure 7).
In the early 1980s, prior to the widespread implementation of modern cultural resources
management surveys along the Victoria Barge Canal, two prehistoric archeological sites, Sentinel
Oak (41VT79) and Blue Bayou (41VT94), were documented by local vocational archeologists.
Reports of the excavation and bioarcheological analysis of human skeletal remains from the Blue
Bayou site were published as Master’s theses (Comuzzie 1987; Huebner 1988). A detailed
summary of the excavation and biological analysis of the Blue Bayou (41VT94) site is provided
by Weinstein (1992:52–54). In 1982, as part of an archeological reconnaissance survey for the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Galveston District, Carolyn Murphy recorded a series of sites
along the Victoria Barge Canal, including sites 41VT98 and 41VT99 in the vicinity of the project
area (Weinstein 1992). Coastal Environments, Inc., began intensive archeological survey along
approximately 16 km of the Victoria Barge Canal in 1998, recording six new archeological sites,
including sites 41VT101, 41VT102, and 41VT103 in the vicinity of the current project areas, and
evaluating seven sites adjacent to the canal, including nearby sites 41VT98 and 41VT99
(Weinstein 1992). Site 41VT98 was revisited in 1991 to assess the impacts of a pipeline
relocation project and to make recommendations regarding which portions of the site should be
avoided. Fifteen auger tests and one test unit were excavated in the southwestern portion of the
site, confirming the significance of the archeological deposits preserved in the central site area
(Weinstein 1991:28). Cultural resources survey and evaluation for proposed dredge disposal
areas along the barge canal was performed by Prewitt and Associates, Inc., in 1993 and resulted
in the recording of site 41VT113 (the Dalton Bridge site) and revisiting nine previously recorded
sites (including 41VT98, 41VT99, and 41VT103) to determine their condition and make
recommendations regarding eligibility for inclusion in the National Register (Gadus et al. 1993).
More recent work by Prewitt and Associates was conducted between 1995 and 1998 as part of the
proposed widening of the Victoria Barge Canal (Gadus et al. 1999). Test excavations were
carried out at six sites, including 41VT103, which was recommended not eligible for inclusion in
the NRHP (Gadus et al. 1999). Site 41VT98 underwent continued testing/mitigation excavation
by Coastal Environments in 2000. Directed by Robert Ricklis, the continued work at 41VT98
involved the excavation of a large prehistoric cemetery (approximately 75 individuals) in addition
to extensive cultural deposits dating from the Early Archaic to the Late Prehistoric periods
(Ricklis 2011). A detailed published report of the 41VT98 excavations is forthcoming (Ricklis
2007, 2011). In January and February 2008, Geo-Marine, Inc., conducted a cultural resources
survey for the Port of Victoria’s proposed barge mooring facility (Meyer 2008). This survey
encompassed an area of approximately 193 acres of the Guadalupe River floodplain immediately
adjacent to the current proposed Industrial Park South project area (see Figure 7). With the
exception of two historic period isolated localities, no resources were encountered during the
survey (Meyer 2008:47 48). As a result of these previous surveys, eight archeological sites have
been previously documented within a 1-km (0.6-mi) radius of the proposed project areas (Table
3).

Based on the sampling strategies and geoarcheological investigations utilized during the nearby
Victoria County Station cultural resources survey (Peter and Prior 2008; Tinsley 2010), it is clear
that archeological site potential is highly variable across the various landforms that occur within
the lower Guadalupe River valley. Cross-referencing the locations of nearby previously recorded
prehistoric archeological sites with geomorphic features such as landforms and soils suggests that
prehistoric occupation of the area was typically confined to upland escarpments and terraces
along valley margins and to prominent point bar and natural levee landforms near the Guadalupe
River. Based on the documentation and geomorphic position of previously recorded prehistoric
archeological sites in the vicinity of the proposed project areas, portions of both project areas
were determined to have a high potential of containing prehistoric archeological sites. Although
the Pickering Basin project area has been adversely impacted by industrial development, the soils
in the proposed project area are likely of sufficient depth to contain prehistoric archeological
deposits. In the proposed Industrial Park South project area, the floodplain of the Guadalupe
River has the potential to preserve deeply buried prehistoric archeological deposits. In addition,
there is a high potential for prehistoric and historic period archeological sites to occur on
landforms along the valley margin and escarpment. Conversely, the relatively level, featureless,
and poorly drained uplands hold a low potential for prehistoric archeological sites to occur;
however, historic period sites may occur in areas of historic development and along transportation
corridors, such as the Old Bloomington Road. Various sources of historical and geographic data
were consulted to ascertain the likelihood of historic-era structural resources existing within the
proposed project area. These sources include historic highway maps, topographic maps, and soil
surveys (which often record cultural resources such as cemeteries, houses, and related features),
and aerial photography. Based on a review of these historic records, it is evident that the region
in general has experienced a dynamic history. Evaluating these sources with more recent records,
however, indicates that the substantial development that has occurred in recent years has altered
much of the historic landscape. Historic period habitation within the proposed project areas was
minimal during the nineteenth century. Settlement increased markedly during the twentieth
century, primarily along Old Bloomington Road.

32

ARCHEOLOGICAL SURVEY METHODS
Due to the variability in prehistoric and historic habitation and archeological site preservation
across the landforms found in the proposed project areas, several survey and sampling methods
were used during this investigation. These investigations included the use of backhoe trenching
and systematic shovel testing at varying intervals to locate and define cultural deposits.
In the Pickering Basin project area and the floodplain portion of the Industrial Park South project
area, systematic backhoe trenching was the primary survey method used to locate archeological
deposits deeply buried by Holocene alluvium. Backhoe trenches were approximately 5–7 m (16–
23 ft) in length and were excavated to a depth of 4 m (13 ft) where possible. Samples of the
trench fill from each natural strata were screened or otherwise inspected for artifacts, and a
portion of the exposed soil profile was inspected, recorded by natural strata, and photographed.
Along the Guadalupe valley margin and within the Pleistocene uplands, systematic shovel tests
were the primary method used to locate archeological deposits. Shovel tests consisted of handexcavated units 40 centimeters (cm; 15.7 inches [in]) in diameter excavated in 20-cm (7.9-in)
levels, with the excavated soil passed through a 0.64-cm (0.25-in) hardware mesh screen to
recover artifacts. Shovel tests were excavated to the Bt horizon, typically to depths ranging
between 20 and 130 cm (8–51 in), based on varying soil conditions encountered. The location,
results, and exposed soil profile of selected shovel tests were recorded with a submeter-accurate
Trimble® GeoXH™ global positioning system (GPS) unit. Shovel tests not recorded via GPS
were plotted on field maps and manually entered into the project’s geographic information system
(GIS).
Along the Guadalupe valley margin, shovel tests were excavated in 100-m (328-ft) intervals, with
additional shovel tests placed judgmentally in areas deemed to have a high probability of
preserving archeological deposits and in areas where artifacts were exposed at the surface.
Shovel tests excavated across the Pleistocene uplands were placed in 3-acre quadrats, at the
locations of map-documented historic period structures, and where surface artifacts were
encountered.

ARCHEOLOGICAL SITE DEFINITION
An archeological site is typically considered to be a spatially discrete area containing cultural
resources. The recognition of a “site” is therefore contingent on the basis of content and extent.
Content refers to artifacts recovered from surface or subsurface contexts, architectural features, or
other manifestations of past human activity. The extent of a site is based on the vertical and
horizontal spatial arrangement of these cultural remains. For surficial materials, a site is defined
as five or more artifacts of at least two different materials or functional classes or at least two
cultural features located within the same vicinity (typically a 400-m2 [0.1-acre] area). The extent
of the surface artifacts and cultural features are then defined as the site boundary. When artifacts
are encountered in buried contexts, a site is defined within the extent of the culturally positive
excavations. In cases where shovel tests yielded cultural materials, additional delineation shovel
tests were excavated to define the boundary of the sites. Shovel tests used to define and delineate
historic period site boundaries were placed at 20-m (66-ft) intervals in a cruciform pattern around
the initial positive shovel test until two negative shovel tests were reached. For prehistoric sites,
delineation shovel tests were excavated in a 20-m-interval (66-ft) grid until two negative shovel
tests were encountered in each grid direction.
33

The spatial extent of a site is defined within the extent of culturally positive shovel tests plus a
20-m (66-ft) buffer. Sites may also be defined within the extent of surface artifacts or features
and positive excavations, within the prescribed buffer, when both are present. Cultural remains
meeting these criteria are designated as a site, recorded on a Texas Archeological Site Data Form,
and submitted to the Texas Archeology Laboratory (TARL) to be included in the Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas database. Depending on depositional integrity and cultural content,
archeological sites can be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. Conversely, discovery of cultural
materials that do not meet these criteria are considered isolated occurrences of past human
activity and are simply documented by location and content. Modern materials and features (i.e.,
less than 50 years old) are not considered sites, with only location and content documented.
Cultural isolates and modern features are not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP because of their
failure to meet site definition and their inability to contribute important information.

NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC PLACES ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
The assessment of significance of a cultural resources property is based on federal guidelines and
regulations. The criteria (36 CFR 60.4 [a–d]) for evaluating properties for inclusion in the NRHP
are codified under the authority of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended,
and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation has set forth guidelines to use in determining
site eligibility. Based Advisory Council guidelines, any resource that is included in or eligible for
inclusion in the National Register is a “historic property.” “The term ‘eligible for inclusion in the
National Register’ includes both properties formally determined as such by the Secretary of the
Interior and all other properties that meet National Register listing criteria” (36 CFR §800.2 [e]).
Subsequent to the identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions, the
following four criteria for eligibility are applied:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design,
setting, material, workmanship, feeling, and association and
(a) that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of
our history; or
(b) that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
(c) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant
and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
(d) that have yielded or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history.
[36 CFR 60.4 (a–d)]

The principal research objective is to determine whether a cultural resources property possesses
the potential to contribute to one or more of the above-defined criteria. Therefore, adequate
information on site function, context, and chronological placement from both archeological and,
if appropriate, historical perspectives is essential for cultural resources evaluations. Because
research questions vary as a result of geography, temporal period, and project design,
determination of site context and chronological placement of cultural properties is a particularly
important objective during the inventory process. The objective of this current project was to
locate and define both horizontally and vertically any cultural resources, document and describe
those resources, and then, when adequate data were present, evaluate each for NRHP eligibility.

STATE ARCHEOLOGICAL LANDMARK DESIGNATION
Under the Antiquities Code of Texas, archeological sites may be considered significant at the
state level and be recognized or designated as an SAL, provided that at least one of the following
conditions is met:
(1) The archeological site is situated on lands owned or controlled by the State of Texas or one of its
political subdivisions; or
(2) The archeological site is situated on private lands that have been specifically designated as an
SAL . . . and fits at least one of the following criteria:
(A) Preservation of materials must be sufficient to allow application of standard archeological
techniques to advantage;
(B) The majority of artifacts are in place so that a significant portion of the site’s original
characteristics can be defined through investigation;
(C) The site has the potential to contribute to cumulative culture history by the addition of new
information;
(D) The site offers evidence of unique or rare attributes; and/or
(E) The site offers a unique and rare opportunity to test techniques, theory, or methods or
preservation, thereby contributing to scientific knowledge [Texas Natural Resources Code
1977; Title 9, Chapter 191, Texas Antiquities Committee, Section 191.094 and Chapter
41.7, Antiquities Code of Texas].

If a property is owned by a political subentity of Texas, such as the Port of Victoria, it technically
meets SAL Condition 1. At issue, however, is whether a site meeting that criterion is significant
and eligible for designation as an SAL or for inclusion in the National Register. The principal
research objective at the survey level of investigation is the determination of whether a cultural
resources site possesses the potential to make a contribution to one or more of the aforementioned
criteria. The objective is to determine which cultural resources could yield further data regarding
regional, methodological, or theoretical research questions. Therefore, adequate information on
site function, context, integrity, and chronological placement from both archeological and, if
appropriate, historical perspectives is essential for cultural investigations. Because research
questions vary as a result of geography and temporal period, determination of site context and
chronological placement of cultural resources is a particularly important objective during the
inventory process.

ARTIFACT TREATMENT AND ANALYSIS METHODS
All artifacts recovered in subsurface contexts and temporally or functionally diagnostic artifacts
encountered in surface contexts were briefly examined, bagged, and labeled by provenience in the
field. Upon arrival at the Geo-Marine laboratory facilities in Plano, Texas, artifacts were
inventoried, cleaned, analyzed, and catalogued (Appendix A). Each artifact was thoroughly
examined in order to identify and determine, to the extent possible, its function or role and
cultural or chronological affiliation within the identified contexts.

Prehistoric Artifact Analysis
The majority of the prehistoric artifacts recovered during this project consisted of chipped lithic
artifacts, specifically chipped lithic debitage. The chipped stone artifact category includes all
chipping or flaking debris and intentionally chipped or flaked stone artifacts. Prehistoric chipped
35

stone artifacts, likewise, include several classes of tools representing different uses and functions.
Debitage refers to the waste flakes and angular material (shatter) generated during the
manufacture and maintenance of chipped stone tools. In some cases, these flakes served as
expedient tools for a variety of cutting, scraping, or perforating functions. All lithic artifacts were
classified to the most specific morpho-functional class possible, and counts, weights, and raw
material types were recorded for each artifact or group of similar artifacts from each provenience.
The prehistoric ceramic assemblages recovered by these investigation consists of two categories
of artifacts: fired clay and ceramic vessel fragments. Fired clay is a general category for all
fragments of thermally altered clay that do not exhibit characteristics identifiable to a function or
other ceramic artifact class. The single prehistoric ceramic vessel fragment recovered through
this survey effort was identified based on tempering agent and surface treatment.

Historic Artifact Analysis
Historic period artifacts recovered during this survey were examined by laboratory staff for
particular attributes and diagnostic traits using morphological and/or functional classification
systems developed by South (1977). Analysis of the recovered materials assigned artifacts to one
of four primary categories—Activities, Architectural, Domestic (including Furnishings), and
Personal (see Appendix A). The Activities category includes nonhousehold items, transportation
items, farm-related equipment, tools, and firearms. The Architectural category includes all items
related to buildings such as brick, mortar, plaster, nails, window glass, and electrical items. The
Domestic category designation is used for items related to food service (tableware) and food
storage (including food preparation and tin cans); a Furnishings classification, a subcategory of
Domestic, encompasses household items such as furniture, stove parts, and lamp glass. The
Personal category generally contains items of individual use such as clothing, buttons, shoes,
dolls, and smoking pipes. Those artifacts such as unidentifiable pieces of glass and metal that
cannot be specifically placed in one of the above major categories are classified as Indeterminate.

Artifact Analysis Database
Various observations for each artifact classification mentioned above were recorded and entered
into an ACCESS database format on an IBM network system. In addition, computer printouts of
all data were compiled and archived with the permanent project files. The results of the analyses
of this collection are presented with the descriptions for each site in the following chapters, and
the raw data are presented in Appendix A.

CHAPTER 5
RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

This chapter presents the results of the cultural resources survey and assesses the effects of the
proposed for proposed improvements to the Pickering Basin and the development of the
Industrial Park South on cultural resources in the vicinity. Management considerations and
recommendations based on the findings of this survey are presented in the final chapter.

BACKGROUND AND ARCHIVAL RESEARCH RESULTS
Background research and review of THC records indicated that eight previous cultural resources
investigations have been conducted within a 1.6-km (1-mi) radius of the proposed project areas
(see Figure 7). These previous surveys documented seven prehistoric archeological sites
(41VT79, 41VT94, 41VT98, 41VT99, 41VT101, 41VT102, and 41VT103) and one historic site
(41VT113) within the search radius (see Table 3). With the exception of site 41VT98, the
proposed project will have no adverse effect on these previously recorded archeological sites
because they are beyond the current APE of the proposed projects. Site 41VT98 extends into the
proposed Industrial Park South APE and was revisited as part of this survey effort.
Archival research focused on the historic period settlement in the immediate vicinity of the
proposed Industrial Park South project area. The project area is located on the Polito Castillo
league, originally consisting of 4,428 acres granted by the Mexican government in 1833 to Polito
Castillo, a colonist of the De Leon Colony (GLO 2012). The original 4,428-acre league has been
divided several times since 1845. The 1864 von Rosenberg map of the San Antonio and
Colorado rivers indicates little development had occurred in this area prior to the mid-nineteenth
century. The first major division of the Polito Castillo league occurred in 1881, when the Peter
Byrne estate was distributed to his heirs. After 1881, the land continued to be sold and
subdivided for farming, ranching, and domestic purposes.
In 1881, ownership of the Polito Castillo league was divided in four parts: the north half of the
north half owned by Peter Byrne; the south half of the north half owned by Patrick Hughes; the
north half of the south half owned by Peter Byrne; and the south half of the south half owned by
Winn Traylor. Although it is unknown when the lower three quarters of the land were sold, it is
known that prior to 1881, Peter Byrne established a homestead on the west half of the north half
37

of the south half. Peter Byrne maintained ownership of both quarters of the league until his death
in ca. 1881, at which time the County Court of Victoria County distributed his estate. The
distribution of the Peter Byrne estate caused the land to be further subdivided. The land located
on the north half of the north half of the original league was labeled Block One and divided into
five long lots. Each lot began on the east bank of the Guadalupe River and extended to the
eastern boundary line of the Polito Castillo league. These five lots were granted to (from north to
south) Ida Byrne, Walter Byrne, Eugene Byrne, H. M. Bingham (widow of Peter Byrne), and
Robert Byrne. The land on the north half of the south half of the league was split into three
sections labeled Block Two, H. M. Bingham 200-acre homestead, and Block Three. Block Two
was divided into five long lots extending from the east bank of the Guadalupe River east to the
west boundary line of the 200-acre homestead granted to H. M. Bingham. The five lots within
Block Two were granted to (from north to south) H. M. Bingham, Ida Byrne, Eugene Byrne,
Walter Byrne, and Robert Byrne. Block Three, also divided into five long lots, extended from the
east boundary line of the 200-acre homestead east to the eastern boundary line of the Polito
Castillo league. These five lots were granted to (from north to south) H. M. Bingham, Ida Byrne,
Eugene Byrne, Walter Byrne, and Robert Byrne (Figure 8; Victoria County Clerk [VCC]
1881:Deed Book [DB] 54:366–374).

Early twentieth-century development in the vicinity appears to have been sparse. In 1909, A.
Levi and Company attempted to establish a subdivision in the Placedo/Dacosta area with a series
of 40-acre lots extending along what is now DuPont Road to the Guadalupe River; however, the
venture never came to fruition. The 1927 United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
Victoria County 1:63,000-scale soil map depicts several structures within the proposed Industrial
Park South project area, primarily along the now defunct Bloomington Road that extends across
the upland portion of the project area. By the mid-twentieth century, several additional structures
existed along Bloomington Road, as depicted on the 1951 United States Geological Survey
(USGS) Bloomington 1:24,000-scale topographic map.

CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY RESULTS
The proposed project areas were intensively investigated to determine the presence of cultural
resources using the field methods described in the preceding chapter. The 7.6-acre Pickering
Basin project area and the 1,390-acre Industrial Park South project area were investigated during
this cultural resources survey. Eight backhoe trenches and two shovel tests were excavated
within the Pickering Basin project area. Twenty-nine backhoe trenches and 682 shovel tests were
excavated in the Industrial Park South project area.

Pickering Basin
In the Pickering Basin project area, two trenches were excavated at each of the two proposed oil
dock ramps (Backhoe Trenches [BHTs] 1–4), and four trenches (BHTs 5–8) were excavated
within the area proposed for the potential expansion of Pickering Basin (Figure 9). The trenches
measured approximately 6 m (20 ft) in length and 2 m (6 ft) in width and were excavated until
sterile subsoil or gleyed deposits were encountered, or until collapsing sand deposits prevented
deeper excavation. Two shovel tests (Shovel Tests [STs] 1 and 2) were then excavated in the
proposed soil disposal area. The shovel test units were excavated to a depth of 80 cm below
surface (cmbs; 32 in below surface [inbs]).
BHTs 1 and 2 were excavated near the central portion of the existing barge slip where an oil dock
ramp leading down to the slip is proposed (Figure 10). The soil profiles encountered in the
trenches were very similar and consisted of an upper layer of sandy fill with a dense
concentration of recently imported chert cobbles between 0 and 50 cmbs (0 and 20 inbs)
underlain by naturally deposited dense clay floodplain deposits grading from black (10YR 2/1) to
light yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) with depth. The color changes below the fill material in BHTs
1 and 2 were gradual, indicating long-term natural soil development as opposed to an abrupt
deposition that would indicate recent placement of individual layers of fill or spoil deposits.
Redoximorphic features consistent with extended periods of saturation were common between 50
and 280 cmbs (20 and 110 inbs), and sterile subsoil consisting of light yellowish brown (2.5Y
6/4) friable silty clay with abundant calcium carbonate masses was encountered below 280 cmbs
(110 inbs). No cultural materials or evidence of buried, low terraces were found in the trenches.
BHTs 3 and 4 were excavated at the location of the second proposed oil dock ramp on a ridgeline
above the floodplain encountered in BHTs 1 and 2 (Figure 11). Based on observations of the
soils eroding on the slopes leading down into the basin and on the basin side walls, it appears that
the Pickering Basin was cut out of a broad Pleistocene-age terrace capped with eroded Holocene

alluvium at the location of BHTs 3 and 4. The deposits encountered in BHTs 3 and 4 consisted of
a black (10YR 2/1) clay loam A-horizon between approximately 0 and 50 cmbs (0 and 20 inbs)
and grayish brown (10YR 5/2) to light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) sterile clay with calcium carbonate
between approximately 50 and 180 cmbs (20 and 71 inbs). These horizons were underlain by
thick deposits of light gray (10YR 7/2) coarse sand with small polished limestone pebbles and
calcium carbonate inclusions to depths exceeding 400 cmbs (157 inbs), followed by a grayish
brown (2.5Y 5/2) gleyed clay loam with common pressure faces. The basal coarse sands and
gleyed deposits are consistent with the Pleistocene Beaumont or Lissie formations, indicating that
backhoe trench excavations reached deposits predating human occupation in the region. No
cultural materials were encountered in BHTs 3 and 4.
The remaining four backhoe trenches were spread evenly throughout the potential expansion area
of Pickering Basin (see Figure 9). BHT 5 was excavated below the ridge encountered in BHTs 3
and 4 and consisted of fill materials of large concrete chunks, nails, and iron fragments between
approximately 0 and 170 cmbs (0 and 67 inbs), underlain between 170 and 300 cmbs (67 and 118
inbs) by thick Pleistocene sand deposits similar to those encountered in BHTs 3 and 4. BHT 6
was excavated on the same landform as BHT 5 and also consisted of highly disturbed deposits
consistent with fill materials. Extremely dense masses of calcium carbonate intermixed with
heavily mottled clay were encountered to approximately 300 cmbs (118 inbs) and were underlain
by light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sterile clay subsoil with brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) mottles,
slickensides, and calcium carbonate nodules between 300 and 330 cmbs (118 and 130 inbs). BHT
7 was excavated on a ridgetop adjacent to an existing oil pipeline. The profile encountered
seemed relatively intact and consisted of brown (10YR 4/3) to strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) sandy
loam and sandy clay loam between 0 and 90 cmbs (0 and 35 inbs), and light gray (2.5Y 7/2) clay
with calcium carbonate masses and redox features between 90 and 130 cmbs (35 and 51 inbs).
These horizons were then underlain by pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine loose sand between 130 and
250 cmbs (51 and 98 inbs) and light gray (2.5Y 7/2) clay with abundant calcium carbonate
masses between 250 and 300 cmbs (98 and 118 inbs). The trench excavation was terminated at
300 cmbs (118 inbs) because it was clear that sterile subsoil deposits had been encountered. BHT
8 was excavated below the ridge southeast of BHT 6. The profile consisted of very pale brown
(10YR 8/3) sandy loam between 0 and 30 cmbs, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay intermixed
with dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) clay between 30 and 300 cmbs (0 and 118 inbs), and
yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay with calcium carbonate masses between 300 and 330 cmbs
(118 and 130 inbs). The trench was terminated with the encounter of sterile subsoil clay deposits
between 300 and 330 cmbs (118 and 130 inbs). No cultural materials were encountered in BHTs
5–8.
Finally, two shovel tests (STs 1 and 2) were excavated in the 30.5-x-30.5-m (100-x-100-ft) soil
disposal area located adjacent to the northeastern corner of the potential expansion area of
Pickering Basin (see Figure 9). The soils encountered in STs 1 and 2 were similar to the upper
portion of the BHT 7 profile and consisted of brown (10YR 4/3) sandy loam between
approximately 0 and 40 cmbs (0 and 16 inbs), dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) sandy clay loam between
approximately 40 and 70 cmbs (16 and 27 inbs), and strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) sandy loam
between approximately 70 and 80 cmbs (27 and 31 inbs). No cultural materials were encountered
in either shovel test.

42

Industrial Park South
The Industrial Park South project area was separated into survey areas based on geomorphology
and the probability of archeological site occurrence, each with survey strategies reflecting the
probability of cultural material. The Guadalupe River floodplain survey area encompasses
approximately 175 acres of the Industrial Park South project area, the Guadalupe River valley
margin encompasses approximately 255 acres, and the Pleistocene uplands encompass the
remaining 960 acres of the project area (Figure 12).

Guadalupe River Floodplain
To determine the presence of deeply buried archeological deposits in the Holocene alluvium of
the Guadalupe River floodplain, backhoe trenching was conducted. For purposes of this project,
the floodplain was defined as areas below an elevation of 6.1 m (20 ft) amsl. Approximately 175
acres of the proposed Industrial Park South project area occur within the Guadalupe River
floodplain. Twenty-nine backhoe trenches were semi-systematically excavated across the project
area, with 25 trenches excavated within the floodplain and an additional four trenches excavated
along lower Guadalupe River valley margin landforms (Figure 13). Where vegetation and land
use allowed, trenches were excavated along transects extending from the Victoria Barge Canal to
the lower slopes of the Guadalupe River valley margin.
Soil profiles exposed within the backhoe trenches excavated in the floodplain were generally
similar, with two areas of comparable soils noted. The majority of the backhoe trenches across
the floodplain were characterized by a surface layer of very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silty clay with
subangular blocky structure transitioning gradually to dark gray (10YR 4/1) silty clay by depths
ranging from 50 to 80 cmbs (20 to 31 inbs), in turn gradually transitioning to light gray (10YR
7/1) clay extending to depths up to 4 m (13 ft). Within these soils, vertical burrows, carbonate
nodules, slickensides, and faint oxidation mottling were ubiquitous. In the easternmost portion of
the floodplain, BHTs 1–3 and 6–8 exhibited a surface horizon of very dark gray (10YR 3/1) to
gray (10YR 5/1) silty clay gradually transitioning to gray (10YR 6/1) clay with carbonate
concretions, vertical burrows, and faint mottling increasing with depth. Soils in this area were
typically saturated within 1–2 m (3.2–6.4 ft) of the surface and represent lacustrine sediments
deposited within the Atascosa Lagoon prior to its infilling and surface modification by modern
agricultural practices.
In addition to the two general areas described above, several unique soil profiles were
encountered during this survey. In BHT 2, thin layers of light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very
fine sandy clay loam were evident between 75 and 82 cmbs (29 and 32 inbs), likely representing
episodes of erosion from the valley margin into the former Atascosa Lagoon. A buried alluvial
fan deposit was encountered in BHT 5, characterized by dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay
loam gradually transitioning to very pale brown (10YR 7/4) medium sand at a depth of 36 cmbs
(14 inbs), which formed a distinct boundary over black (10YR 2/1) clay with common carbonate
concretions. BHT 10 was excavated on a low rise generally parallel to the floodplain margin in
the east-central portion of the floodplain. The rise, approximately 1–2 m (3.2–6.4 ft) higher than
the surrounding floodplain, consisted of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine loamy sand
gradually transitioning to dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) fine loamy sand at a depth of
approximately 40 cmbs (16 in), overlying a discontinuous calcic horizon with a maximum
thickness of 20 cm (8 in). The calcic horizon, in turn, overlies a thick (2.5 m [8.2 ft]) very pale
43

brown (10YR 8/2) loamy sand deposit characteristic of Deweyville terraces (Aiuvalasit 2006:37–
44). BHT 15, excavated near the floodplain margin in the central portion of the project area,
exhibited a typical surface layer of very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silty clay gradually transitioning to
dark gray (10YR 4/1) silty clay with few carbonate concretions by a depth of 70 cmbs (27 inbs).
These typical floodplain deposits, however, overlie dark gray (10YR 4/1) coarse sandy clay loam
that gradually transitions to light gray (10YR 7/1) coarse sandy clay loam with strong brown
(7.5YR 5/6) and reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8) mottles. This soil profile likely indicates the
location of a former channel of the Guadalupe River, possibly dating to the late Pleistocene or
early Holocene (Weinstein 1992:Figure 10-2). An abandoned channel, approximately 20 ft (6 m)
in width, was indicated in this general vicinity in GLO survey data during the mid-nineteenth
century. The channel has been obscured by historic and recent agriculture and is no longer
evident on the surface. This survey resulted in the documentation of one historic period
archeological site (41VT167, discussed below).

Guadalupe River Valley Margin
The Guadalupe River valley margin encompasses approximately 255 acres of the proposed
Industrial Park South project area. Based on geomorphology and the locations of previously
recorded archeological sites in the region, the Guadalupe River valley margin is believed to hold
the highest probability of containing archeological sites, particularly locations of prehistoric
inhabitation, resource extraction, and mortuary sites. Four backhoe trenches, excavated during
the investigations of the Holocene floodplain deposits, extend to the lower slopes of the
Guadalupe River valley margin (see Figure 13). These trenches provided insight to the soils
encountered along the valley margin.
BHTs 4 and 9 were excavated along the toe slopes of the Guadalupe River valley margin. BHT 4
exhibited very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silty clay and silty clay loam overlying yellow (10YR 7/6)
clay loam. BHT 9 exhibited dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sandy loam and dark yellowish
brown (10YR 4/4) fine loamy sand overlying very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) sandy clay. It
is likely that the underlying Pleistocene Beaumont Formation was encountered in both of these
trenches. BHT 25 was excavated at a valley margin toe slope below site 41VT98 to determine if
cultural deposits, buried by alluvial or colluvial processes, existed in this location. The soil
profile exposed in BHT 25 indicated that the uppermost 30–45 cm (12–18 in) has been disturbed,
probably by construction associated with the Victoria Barge Canal. These disturbed soils overlie
grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam to a depth of approximately 120 cmbs (47 inbs) where
a 20-cm-thick (6-in) light gray sandy loam horizon separates the overlying soil from gray (10YR
5/1) clay loam. BHT 29 was excavated on a toe slope above an unnamed ephemeral drainage
extending southeast toward an intermittent stream draining the uplands. This trench exhibits a
complex depositional history. The surface layer consisted of a 60-cm-thick (24-in) layer of very
pale brown (10YR 7/4) medium loamy sand gradually transitioning to a 12-cm-thick (5-in) layer
of very pale brown (10YR 8/2) medium loamy sand overlying a dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2)
medium sandy clay loam with red (2.5YR 5/8) mottles from 72 to 118 cmbs (28 to 46 inbs). A
brown (7.5YR 4/4) medium loamy sand with strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) mottles was encountered
from 118 to 300 cmbs (46 to 118 inbs), which gradually transitioned to brown (7.5YR 4/4) coarse
sandy clay loam. The sandy constituents of this profile indicate deposition of sandy soils from
the adjacent uplands to the west, but the dark grayish brown sandy clay loam horizon is likely to
have derived from alluvial deposition of eroded clay-rich Beaumont Formation deposits from the
uplands to the east.
46

The primary survey method used across this portion of the survey area was shovel testing.
Shovel tests were systematically excavated in 100-m (323-ft) intervals across valley margin
landforms at locations of surface artifacts and at map-documented locations of historic period
structures (Figure 14). A variety of landforms and soil types were encountered during the cultural
resources survey in this area. The westernmost portion of the survey area consists of a generally
level upland escarpment slightly lower in elevation than the adjacent Pleistocene uplands and
dissected by several ephemeral drainages (see Chapter 2). This area, mantled by deep loamy sand
deposits, likely represents a High Deweyville terrace with a mantle of Holocene sand deposited
by eolian processes. The central and eastern portions of the valley margin exhibited more
variable soil conditions, with some areas mantled by sandy loams and others by clay or clay
loams, largely dictated by the deposition and erosion of eolian sands during the Holocene. In
total, 376 shovel tests were excavated across the Guadalupe River valley margin. This survey
resulted in the recording of four archeological sites (41VT156, 41VT158, 41VT165, and
41VT166) and five isolates (Isolates 9–13) and the documentation of one historic period cemetery
(41VT168) location. In addition, the boundary of one previously recorded site (41VT98) was
extended.

Pleistocene Uplands
The Pleistocene uplands encompass approximately 960 acres of the proposed Industrial Park
South project area. Based on geomorphology and the locations of previously recorded
archeological sites in the region, the Pleistocene uplands hold the lowest probability of containing
prehistoric archeological sites; however, numerous historic period sites, particularly those dating
to the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, are likely to exist. As with the Guadalupe
River valley margin, the primary survey method used across this portion of the project area was
shovel testing. Shovel tests were systematically excavated in 110-m (360-ft) intervals across the
majority of the survey area at locations of surface artifacts and at map-documented locations of
historic period structures (see Figure 14). In total, 304 shovel tests were excavated across the
Pleistocene uplands. This survey resulted in the recording of eight historic period archeological
sites (41VT155–41VT162, 41VT163, and 41VT164) and eight isolates (Isolates 1–4 and Isolates
14–17).

Site 41VT155
Site 41VT155 consists of a low-density, late nineteenth- to mid twentieth-century domestic site
located within proposed Industrial Park South APE. The site occupies the northwestern corner of
an agricultural field situated on a level, featureless portion of the upland coastal plain along the
now defunct Bloomington Road (Figure 15). Presently wooded, the site is encompassed by an
active agricultural field (Figure 16). Surface artifacts were exposed within the wooded area and
within adjacent portions of the plowed field, with artifact density rapidly decreasing with distance
into the plowed field. Twelve shovel tests were excavated to define the site boundary, in
conjunction with the surface artifact scatter. Four positive shovel tests occupy the central portion
of the wooded area. Site 41VT155 encompasses approximately 1.5 acres, measuring
approximately 90 m (295 ft) north-to-south by 90 m (295 ft) east-to-west at an elevation of
19.5 m (62 ft) amsl. Several areas of recently discarded items (televisions, modern bottles and
cans) were also observed at the site. Three dilapidated and collapsing outbuildings, likely barns
and a shed, were observed and photodocumented at the site (Figures 17–19).
47

Soil profiles examined during this survey indicate that the site is mantled by very dark gray
(10YR 3/1) to black (10YR 2/1) clay. Based on maps and soil descriptions prepared by the
NRCS (2012), the site occupies an area near the transition between Dacosta sandy clay loam and
Laewest clay; however, the soils encountered during this survey suggest that the site is entirely
within the Laewest clay map unit.
Numerous historic period surface artifacts were observed across site 41VT155 and were
concentrated in the central, wooded, portion of the site. Surface artifacts consisted primarily of
refined earthenware and bottle glass.
The collected artifact assemblage encountered at the site consists of historic period domestic
items recovered in four shovel tests at depths ranging from 0–20 cmbs (0–8 inbs) (n=31) and
from the general site surface (n=21), for a total of 52 artifacts: Domestic (n=31), Architectural
(n=2), Furnishing (n=4), Personal (n=1), and Indeterminate (n=14) items. The Domestic artifacts
are further subdivided into ceramics (n=18) and glass (n=13). The refined earthenwares consist
of blue-tinted, high-fired ironstone (n=5; 1850–1910), porcelain (n=1), flow blue (n=1; 1830–
1860), light blue tinted whiteware (n=2; 1880–1930), pure white whiteware (n=2; post-1890), and
light ivory tinted whiteware (n=1; post-1920). Utilitarian ceramics are Bristol glazed
interior/exterior stoneware (n=2; post-1900), natural clay slipped interior/Bristol and natural clay
slipped exterior stoneware (n=1; 1890–1915), natural clay slipped interior/exterior (n=1; 1875–
1900), and yellowware (n=2). Domestic glass consists of amber/brown (n=2), aqua (n=1), ashtint (n=4; post-1915), colorless (n=2; post-1880), and manganese/solarized (n=2; 1870s–1920)
body sherds, as well as non-applied, turn-molded clear and aqua bottle lips (1880–1910).
Architectural items are a wire nail (post-1890) and a piece of aqua window glass. Furnishings
include three glass fragments related to electrical lamps: two clear light bulb fragments and a
portion of an electric lamp base. The remaining Furnishings artifact is a piece of table glass that
has melted but was probably originally oval shaped. Three sides appear to have original edges,
but the fourth is broken. One edge has two thick beads that are present on both sides of the
artifact. The two remaining edges have thickened segments that are roughly rectangular in cross
section and irregular in depth. The thickened segments are only visible on one side of the artifact.
Finally, there is a series of wavy, ridged lines on the interior of the artifact that occur on the same
side as the thickened segments. The Personal artifact is a porcelain four-hole button. The
Indeterminate artifacts are thin iron fragments (n=10), modern plastic fragments (n=3), and a
possible reflector fragment. The possible reflector is a piece of red glass with large knobs
approximately 9 mm in diameter and 5 mm in height protruding from one surface. It does not
appear to match any Depression glass or pattern glass designs and is likely a reflector fragment.

County 1:63,000-scale soils map and the 1951 USGS Bloomington 1:24,000-scale topographic
map. Additional archival research was conducted, focusing on the ownership of the property.
Site 41VT155 is located on the west half of the north half of the north half of the Polito Castillo
league, on a portion of land that was known as Lot One of Block One and granted to Ida Byrne by
the Victoria County Court in 1881. Ida Byrne maintained ownership of the land until 1897, at
which time she sold Lots One, Two, Three, and Four of Block One (850 acres) to W. P. Stafford
and C. L. Thurmond (VCC 1897:DB 36:516). Between 1897 and 1924 the property was granted
to L. G. Kreisle, who owned the land until his death in 1924. After the death of L. G. Kreisle, the
land was willed to his brother Emil Kreisle of San Antonio (VCC 1924:DB 105:29). Emil

Kreisle continued to maintain a permanent residence in San Antonio until his death in 1945, but
according to his obituary he was devoted to farming and ranching in his later years (San Antonio
Express 17 November 1945). Between 1924 and 1945, Emil Kreisle granted the property to his
daughter Myrtle Kreisle Trip, who in 1974 granted the property to her son Gustav T. Trip Jr.
(VCC 1974:DB 860:476). In 1975, Gustav T. Trip Jr. granted the property to his cousins Lexina
K. Miguez and Lissette Trip Wilson, who in 1977 sold the property to the Gulf Oil Corporation of
Pennsylvania (VCC 1975:DB 869:255; VCC 1977:DB 942:655). Between 1977 and 1980, the
Gulf Oil Corporation consolidated several tracts from the Polito Castillo league and formed one
tract of land containing 1,955.21 acres. In 1984, the Gulf Oil Corporation sold the property to
Ralph R. Gilster, Jr., D. H. Braman, Jr., Dennis O’Connor, and Tom O’Connor, Jr., trustees for
the Kate S. O’Connor Trust for Junie O’Connor Gilster, Ralph Richard Gilster III, Kathryn
Carlisle Gilster, Thomas Donald O’Connor, Dennis O’Connor III, Clay Stewart O’Connor, and
Virginia Drake Lebermann (VCC 1984:DB 1248:772). Finally, in 2007, Ralph R. Gilster, Jr.,
D.H. Braman, Jr., Dennis O’Connor, and Tom O’Connor, Jr., (trustees) sold the property to the
current owner, Victoria County Port Facilities Corporation (VCC 2007:DB 3644:11; VCC
2012:DB 3914:17).
Site 41VT155 likely represents the location of a late nineteenth- to mid-twentieth-century
farmstead. Like many of the historic period farmsteads in the region, the site may have been
occupied by a tenant farmer rather than the property owner; thus, determining the precise
occupant at a given period is problematic. Demolition of the associated structures has adversely
affected the site’s integrity of design and materials. Given the site’s minimal, fragmentary, and
redundant artifact content, and the lack of architectural features, coupled with disturbances to the
site by modern agriculture, 41VT155 is considered to have little research potential. As such, the
site is not likely to yield any additional information relevant to understanding rural domestic life
or community and regional development in the Guadalupe River valley of the central Texas
coastal region. Thus, it is recommended that site 41VT155 is not eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP under the criteria enumerated in 36 CFR 60.4 or for designation as an SAL under 13 TAC
26.8. No further investigations are recommended at site 41VT155 for purposes of developing the
proposed Industrial Park South, as it is presently defined.

Site 41VT156
Site 41VT156 consists of a low-density, late nineteenth- to early twentieth-century domestic site,
with a minor, nondiagnostic prehistoric component, located within proposed Industrial Park
South APE. The site occupies a prominent ridge extending southwest from the upland
escarpment (Figure 20). Two two-track roads intersect near the center of the site, where a
modern windmill and two concrete stock tanks are located (Figure 21). Observed surface
artifacts were exposed within each of the two-track roads and were concentrated at the
escarpment and along the northwestern slope of the landform. Thirty-six shovel tests were
excavated to define the site boundary. Seven positive shovel tests occupy the highest and most
level portion of the landform. Site 41VT156 encompasses approximately 3.6 acres, measuring
roughly 145 m (476 ft) north-to-south by 175 m (574 ft) east-to-west at an elevation ranging from
14–18 m (46–59 ft) amsl. The site is primarily covered by pasture.

54

21. Field photograph of site 41VT156, view to the northeast

Figure 21. Field photograph of site 41VT156, view to the northeast.

Soil profiles examined during this survey indicate that the site is mantled by a fine sandy loam
that gradually transitions from very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) to dark yellowish brown
(10YR 3/4) at the surface to a subsoil ranging from dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/6) to brownish
yellow (10YR 6/6). Based on maps and soil descriptions prepared by the Natural Resources
Conservation Service (NRCS 2012), the site occupies an area near the transition between Runge
fine sandy loam and Laewest clay; however, the soils encountered during this survey suggest that
the site is entirely within the Runge fine sandy loam map unit.
Surface artifacts were observed in several eroded areas of the site but were concentrated within
the portion of the roadway bisecting the escarpment in the southwestern area of the site and
within the roadway descending the northwestern slope of the landform. Surface artifacts
observed at site 41VT156 consisted of 12 prehistoric artifacts and 45 historic period artifacts.
Prehistoric surface artifacts were concentrated in the southwest portion of the site and consisted
primarily of chipped lithic debitage (n=11) and a single fragment of burned rock. Historic period
surface artifacts consisted of manganese/solarized, ash-tint, colorless, amber, aqua, cobalt, and
black bottle glass (n=22), undecorated refined earthenware (n=14), window glass (n=3), one
fragment of coarse earthenware, a cut nail, a fragment of cast iron, a pocket knife, a cartridge
case, and an unidentifiable lead mass. The single oyster shell observed on the surface could not
be positively associated with either the prehistoric or historic component of the site.
The subsurface artifact assemblage encountered at site 41VT156 consists of a single piece of
chert shatter (0–10 cmbs [0–4 inbs]) from ST C-5 (10–30 cmbs [4–12 inbs]), as well as historic
period items (0–40 cmbs [0–16 inbs]) recovered in seven shovel tests. Thirty-six historic artifacts
56

were collected, consisting of Domestic (n=18), Architectural (n=7), Activities (n=1), Furnishing
(n=1), Personal (n=1), and Indeterminate (n=6) artifacts. The Domestic ceramics consist of
porcelain (n=2), blue-tinted, high-fired ironstone (n=1; 1850–1910), pure white whiteware (n=2;
post-1890), and coarse earthenware (n=1) with a natural clay slipped interior and salt glazed
exterior and cobalt blue decoration (1840–1900). The Domestic glass items are amber/brown
body sherds (n=3), ash-tint body sherds (n=2; post-1915), and colorless body sherds (n=4; post1880). A fragment of an amber/brown bottle base is probably from a square or rectangularshaped panel bottle and exhibits a rounded depression in the interior of the base. The artifact is
heavily weathered; thus, no mold seams could be observed. An amber/brown bottle lip fragment
was also collected, with an apparent Brandy finish. A piece of manganese/solarized table glass
exhibits a molded facet and a series of molded ribs approximately 3 millimeters (mm) wide. The
seven Architectural artifacts consist of cut nails (n=5; 1840–1880), a wire nail (post-1890), and a
piece of light green window glass. The Activities-related artifact is a portion of a shotgun shell
base or rimmed center-fire cartridge. Unfortunately, the artifact was slightly deformed and the
mouth was no longer present, making identification more difficult. In addition, no headstamp
was discerned on the artifact. The internal diameter measured between .40 and .42 inches,
consistent with a .410 shotgun shell base or a variety of straight-case .40-caliber rifle cartridges.
The Furnishing-related artifact is a piece of ash-tint lamp glass (post-1915). The Personal artifact
is a fragment of a double-sided, 78-rpm record (1915–1955) that appears to be burned. The
Indeterminate artifacts are wire (n=1), thin iron fragments (n=4), and ash-tint angular glass
fragments.
A primary structure is depicted at the location of site 41VT156 on the 1927 USDA Victoria
County 1:63,000-scale soils map. Additional archival research was conducted, focusing on the
ownership of the property. Archival research indicated that site 41VT156 is located on the west
half of the south half of the north half of the Polito Castillo league. In 1881, this quarter of the
league was owned by Patrick Hughes, who arrived in Victoria in 1852 and quickly established
himself as a rancher. In 1865, Patrick Hughes married Eliza Traylor, the daughter of Winn
Traylor. Eliza Traylor died the following year. Prior to her death, she gave birth to the couple’s
only child, Eliza Hughes, who in 1882 married J. J. Welder (Victoria Advocate 12 May 1968a).
After the death of his wife, Patrick Hughes continued to live on and maintain his ranch until
1884, at which time he sold the property to Henry C. Traylor. In 1891, Henry C. Traylor divided
the land and granted 395.3 acres to his son Winn Traylor, who in 1912 sold 200 acres to Charles
G. Taylor, and being the same property on which site 41VT156 is located. Charles G. Taylor
maintained ownership until 1919, at which time he sold the land to C. E. Stubblefield and his wife
Elizabeth Stubblefield (Gaddus et al. 1999:274). C. E. Stubblefield maintained ownership of the
property until his death in 1952, at which time it was willed to his wife Elizabeth Stubblefield,
who in 1977 sold the property to the Gulf Oil Corporation of Pennsylvania (VCC 1953:DB
350:79; VCC 1977:DB 942:629). Between 1977 and 1980, the Gulf Oil Corporation
consolidated several tracts from the Polito Castillo league and formed one tract of land containing
1,955.21 acres that is now under the ownership of the Victoria County Port Facilities Corporation
(VCC 2007:DB 3644:11; VCC 2012:DB 3914:17).
Site 41VT156 likely represents the location of a late nineteenth- to early twentieth-century
farmstead, with a minor prehistoric component. Like many of the historic period farmsteads in
the region, the site may have been occupied by a tenant farmer rather than the property owner;
thus, determining the occupant at a given period is problematic. Demolition and neglect of the
associated structures has adversely affected the site’s integrity of design and materials. Given the
site’s minimal, fragmentary, and redundant artifact content, and the lack of architectural features,

coupled with disturbances to the site by modern ranching, 41VT156 is considered to have little
research potential. As such, the site is not likely to yield any additional information relevant to
understanding rural domestic life or community and regional development in the Guadalupe
River valley of the central Texas coastal region. Thus, it is recommended that site 41VT156 is
not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under the criteria enumerated in 36 CFR 60.4 or for
designation as an SAL under 13 TAC 26.8. No further investigations are recommended at site
41VT156 for purposes of developing the proposed Industrial Park South, as it is presently
defined.

Site 41VT157
Site 41VT157 consists of a low-density, late nineteenth- to mid-twentieth-century domestic site
located within proposed Industrial Park South APE. The site occupies a small pasture area
situated on a level, featureless portion of the upland coastal plain located along the now defunct
Bloomington Road (Figure 22). Surface artifacts were exposed around a barn and within an
unnamed two-track road paralleling a drainage ditch that forms the northern edge of the site.
Nine shovel tests were excavated to define the site boundary, in conjunction with the surface
artifact scatter. Two positive shovel tests occupy the central portion of the pasture. Site
41VT157 encompasses approximately 1.4 acres, measuring approximately 80 m (262 ft) north-tosouth by 100 m (328 ft) east-to-west at an elevation of 19.5 m (62 ft) amsl. A barn, currently in
use for modern ranching purposes, is located along the edge of the pasture on the western edge of
the site (Figure 23).
Soil profiles examined during this survey indicate that the site is mantled by very dark brown
(10YR 2/2) sandy clay loam that gradually transitions to dark grayish brown clay loam by depths
of approximately 40–50 cm (16–20 in). Based on maps and soil descriptions prepared by the
NRCS (2012), the site occupies an area of Telferner series fine sandy loam. The soils
encountered during this survey suggest that the site is within the Telferner fine sandy loam map
unit.
Observed surface artifacts consisted entirely of historic-period Domestic artifacts: undecorated
refined earthenware (n=4), porcelain (n=1), and a cut rib bone. The subsurface artifact
assemblage encountered at site 41VT157 consists of five historic period domestic items recovered
in one shovel test (Shovel Test [ST] WH-2) at depths from 0–30 cmbs (0–12 inbs) and a single
mass of concrete (not collected) encountered in ST C-1. Five historic artifacts were collected
from site 41VT157, all consisting of Domestic items: two pieces of blue-tinted, high-fired
ironstone (1850–1910), two ash-tint glass body sherds (post-1915), and one aqua glass body
sherd.
A primary structure is depicted at the location of site 41VT157 on the 1927 USDA Victoria
County 1:63,000-scale soils map and the 1951 USGS Bloomington 1:24,000-scale topographic
map. Additional archival research was conducted, focusing on the ownership of the property.
Site 41VT157 is located on the west half of the north half of the south half of the Polito Castillo
league, along the west side of Old Bloomington Road. This tract of land was known as the H. M.
Bingham 200-acre homestead in 1881, and was owned by H. M. Bingham, the widow of Peter
Byrne. Between 1881 and 1920, H. M. Bingham granted the property to Ida Byrne, who
maintained ownership of the homestead until her death in 1920. After Ida Byrne’s death, the
property was willed to her niece Elizabeth Woodhouse, who sold the portion of the tract on the

west side of Old Bloomington Road to C. H. Stiernberg and D. D. Spencer (VCC 1920:Probate
Minutes [PM] 16:589; VCC 1945:DB 209:56). In 1960, C. H. Stiernberg and D. D. Spencer sold
the property to Joseph B. Bumgardner, who in 1977 sold the property to the Gulf Oil Corporation
of Pennsylvania (VCC 1960:DB 517:673; VCC 1977:DB 943:315). Between 1977 and 1980, the
Gulf Oil Corporation consolidated several tracts from the Polito Castillo league and formed one
tract of land containing 1,955.21 acres that is now under the ownership of the Victoria County
Port Facilities Corporation (VCC 2007:DB 3644:11; VCC 2012:DB 3914:17).
Site 41VT157 likely represents the location of an early- to mid-twentieth-century farmstead. As
with many of the historic period farmsteads in the region, the site may have been occupied by a
tenant farmer rather than the property owner; thus, determining the occupant at a given period is
problematic. The relocation and repurposing of the associated structure has adversely affected
the site’s integrity of design and setting. Given the site’s minimal, fragmentary, and redundant

Site 41VT158
Site 41VT158 consists of a prehistoric habitation site largely disturbed by a historic period
component located within proposed Industrial Park South APE. The site occupies the escarpment
of the Guadalupe River valley, with the remnants of a prehistoric midden occupying a lower slope
bench of the valley margin, which has been disturbed by Stubblefield Road (Figure 24). Seventythree shovel tests were excavated to define the site boundary, in conjunction with the surface
artifact scatter. Seventeen positive shovel tests span from the summit to the toe slope of the
landform, with eroded artifacts extending to the floodplain below the site (Figure 25). Site
41VT158 encompasses approximately 4.8 acres, measuring approximately 300 m (984 ft)
northeast-to-southwest by 150 m (492 ft) northwest-to-southeast at elevations ranging from 5 m
(16 ft) amsl at the floodplain to 18 m (59 ft) amsl at the summit of the landform. A small,
corrugated metal shed and several fences occupy the midslope of the landform.
Soil profiles examined during this survey indicate that the site is mantled by very dark gray
(10YR 3/1) to black (10YR 2/1) clay loam. Based on maps and soil descriptions prepared by the
NRCS (2012), the site spans areas of Runge fine sandy loam at the summit of the landform,
Laewest clay along the slopes, and Meguin silty clay at the foot of the slope. The soils
encountered during this survey suggest that the sandy surface layer of the landform summit has
been eroded, most likely by historic agriculture.
Surface artifacts observed at the site consisted of both prehistoric and historic period artifacts.
Prehistoric artifacts observed on the site surface included chipped lithic debitage (n=18; seven
pieces collected), one biface fragment (collected), burned rock, burned bone, and burned brackish
shell and marine shell. The biface fragment is a possible medial section of a chert dart point that
shows evidence of fine retouching along the extant lateral edges and is well flaked on both faces
with a symmetrical cross section. These artifacts were observed in an area of dark soil exposed
within Stubblefield Road, which appears to have disturbed a prehistoric midden deposit (Figure
26). Organic-rich deposits extended approximately 180 m (590 ft) along Stubblefield Road, with
prehistoric lithic artifacts concentrated near the escarpment of the lower slope bench above the
floodplain. Historic period artifacts observed on the site surface included undecorated refined
earthenware (n=6), machine-made brick fragments (n=6), coarse earthenware sewer or drain pipe
(n=1; collected), and bottle glass (n=9) including colorless (n=1), aqua (n=3), cobalt (n=2), olive
green (n=1), black (n=1), and light green (n=1). Four surface artifacts were collected. One is a
clear glass bottle base with an Owens ring (post-1910). The light green bottle glass, a portion of a
panel bottle, is embossed “. . .McLEAN . . .” and probably represents DR. J. H. McLEAN'S
VOLCANIC OIL LINIMENT (post-1854; Hoolihan 2008:475–476). The fragment of sewer or
drainpipe exhibits a series of irregular, deeply incised annular lines on the exterior. The fourth
collected surface artifact is a piece of asbestos fragment that is curved and is therefore identified
as a piece of pipe lagging; the exterior is two-tone buff and green, suggesting that the artifact was
painted. Historic period artifacts were concentrated within Stubblefield Road near the bottom of
the slope.
The subsurface prehistoric artifact assemblage at site 41VT158 includes eight artifacts recovered
from eight shovel tests (from 0–20 cmbs [0–8 inbs]). Prehistoric artifacts consist of six pieces of
chipped lithic debitage, one possible expedient edge-modified flake tool, and one undecorated
sandy paste ceramic sherd with bone tempering. Prehistoric artifacts at the site appear to be
concentrated in two loci; one located on the lower slope bench above the floodplain and another
at the summit of the landform (see Figure 24). None of the prehistoric lithic artifacts recovered

from site 41VT158 were temporally or culturally diagnostic. The single ceramic sherd, recovered
from ST CG-14 at the summit of the landform, can be assigned to Weinstein’s (1992:89–95)
Goose Creek Plain, var. Traylor Ranch, category; however, the interpretive utility of this tentative
type-variety classification system is limited. The presence of this single ceramic sherd indicates
that the site may date to the early portion of the Late Prehistoric period (ca. A.D. 1000–
1200/1300) or include a Late Prehistoric component.
The collected subsurface historic period artifact assemblage from site 41VT158 includes 28
artifacts recovered in nine shovel tests (from 0–20 cmbs [0–8 inbs]): Domestic (n=16),
Architectural (n=4), Furnishings (n=1), Activities (n=2), and Indeterminate (n=5) artifacts.
Among the Domestic artifacts, only one ceramic was collected: a single fragment of buffware
with brown glazed exterior and brown slipped interior. Thirteen of the Domestic glass artifacts
are body sherds, consisting of amber/brown (n=1), amber/brown with stippling (post-1940), ashtint (n=4; post-1915), and colorless (n=7; post-1880). The remaining Domestic glass items are
two clear fragments of possible table glass. The Architectural artifacts are three wire nails (post1890) and a piece of light tinted plate glass. The two Activities-related artifacts are a fence staple
and possible rat trap mechanism (post-1894; Hooker 1894). The rat trap mechanism is composed
of a single strand of wire bent at a 90° angle, with a wire coil wrapped around the wire strand
next to the bend. Although this artifact is also consist with a piece of single strand barbed wire
(cf. Glidden's Coil, Hanging-barb One-Strand Variation or Glidden’s Barb, One Strand Variation
[Clifton 1970:30–31]), the bent, single strand wire makes the identification as a hammer and
spring from a traditional mouse or rat trap seem more likely. The single Furnishing-related
artifact is a piece of colorless lamp glass (post-1880). The Indeterminate artifacts are four pieces
of unidentified thin iron and an iron can lid fragment that was originally oval with a rolled rim.
No structures are depicted at the location of site 41VT158 on any of the historic maps reviewed
during this project. Additional archival research was conducted, focusing on the ownership of the
property. Site 41VT158 is located on the west half of the north half of the north half of the Polito
Castillo league, on a portion of land that was known as Lot Five of Block One and granted to
Robert Byrne by the Victoria County Court in 1881. Between 1881 and 1897, Robert Byrne
granted the property to W. P. Stafford and C. L. Thurmond, who sold a 321-acre tract, containing
a portion of Lot Five, to Austin Hickey (VCC 1897:DB 38:623). The 321-acre tract was located
from the east bank of the Guadalupe River to the west side of the Old Bloomington Road along
the north boundary line of the Polito Castillo league with a south boundary line along
Stubblefield Road. Austin Hickey lived on the property and maintained ownership of the 321acre tract until his death in 1903 (Advocate 3 October 1903), at which time the land was passed to
his heirs Tina Hickey, Mary Hickey, Richard Hickey, Andrew Hickey, and Joseph Hickey. In
1905, the Austin Hickey heirs foreclosed on the property and the 321-acre tract was sold in a
Sheriff’s sale to Mary T. Glass, who sold the property to Adolph Fromme in 1906 (VCC
1905:DB 53:186; VCC 1906:DB 56:261). Adolph Fromme is known to have lived on the
property in the “Austin Hickey Place” in ca. 1910, and maintained ownership of the property until
his death in 1943 (Daily Advocate 4 November 1910). In 1943, the property was passed to
Adolph Fromme’s widow Teresa Fromme, who maintained ownership of the property until her
death in 1976 (Advocate 18 January 1976). After the death of Teresa Fromme, the property was
willed to her two surviving sisters Ernestine Ackermann and Elizabeth Ackermann, who in 1980
sold the property to the Gulf Oil Corporation of Pennsylvania (VCC 1980:DB 1068:473).
Between 1977 and 1980, the Gulf Oil Corporation consolidated several tracts from the Polito
Castillo league and formed one tract of land containing 1,955.21 acres that is now under the
ownership of the Victoria County Port Facilities Corporation (VCC 2007:DB 3644:11; VCC

Site 41VT158 represents a possible Late Prehistoric site with a late nineteenth- to mid-twentiethcentury domestic occupation. Unfortunately, the prehistoric component of the site has been
largely destroyed by ground-disturbing activities related to both the historic period component at
the site as well as the construction and maintenance of Stubblefield Road, which bisects the
prehistoric midden deposit on the lower slope bench. Although lithic debris and a variety of
burned faunal remains are clearly visible within Stubblefield Road, only two artifacts were
recovered from the 24 shovel tests excavated along the roadway (see Figure 24). It appears that
much of the midden deposit has been displaced during the process of grading the road. During
the historic period, the site may have been occupied by a tenant farmer rather than the property
owner; thus, determining the occupant at a given period is problematic. The possible demolition
of any additional structures associated with the site has adversely affected the site’s integrity of
design and materials. Given the site’s minimal and fragmentary artifact content, coupled with
disturbances to the site by the current agricultural and ranching activities in the vicinity, 41VT158
is considered to have little research potential. As such, the site is not likely to yield any
additional information relevant to understanding rural domestic life or community and regional
development in the Guadalupe River valley of the central Texas coastal region. Thus, it is
recommended that site 41VT159 is not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under the criteria
enumerated in 36 CFR 60.4 or for designation as an SAL under 13 TAC 26.8. No further
investigations are recommended at site 41VT158 for purposes of developing the proposed
Industrial Park South, as it is presently defined.

Site 41VT159
Site 41VT159 consists of a low-density, late nineteenth- to mid-twentieth-century domestic site
located within proposed Industrial Park South APE. The site occupies a narrow pasture area
situated on a level, featureless portion of the upland coastal plain located adjacent to the now
defunct Bloomington Road (Figure 27). Ten shovel tests were excavated to define the site
boundary, in conjunction with the surface artifact scatter and architectural remains. Three
positive shovel tests occupy the northern portion of the pasture. Site 41VT159 encompasses
approximately 1.2 acres, measuring approximately 110 m (361 ft) northwest-to-southeast by 55 m
(180 ft) northeast-to-southwest at an elevation of 19 m (62 ft) amsl. Two small concrete
foundations are located in the central portion of the site and a small brick feature, possibly
capping a well, is located in the northeastern portion of the site (Figure 28). A shed, currently in
use, is situated near the northern end of the site (Figure 29) and two accumulations of historic and
modern domestic, agricultural, and industrial debris is located to the north and south of the shed.
Soil profiles examined during this survey indicate that the site is mantled by very dark gray
(10YR 3/1) to black (10YR 2/1) clay. Based on maps and soil descriptions prepared by the
NRCS (2012), the site occupies an area of Laewest clay. The soils encountered during this
survey confirm this identification.
Surface artifacts observed at the site, in addition to those observed within piles of debris
previously mentioned, consisted of domestic artifacts, including undecorated refined earthenware
(n=2), molded refined earthenware (n=1), and a cobalt glass Vicks bottle. The bricks capping the
probable well are red-paste, dry-pressed, machine-made bricks manufactured by D’Hanis Brick
and Tile Company and bear the Common Brick Manufacturers Association symbol (c. 1920s;
Steinbomer 1982).

The subsurface artifact assemblage encountered at site 41VT159 includes a single core flake of
chert (20–30 cmbs [8–16 inbs]) and 61 historic period artifacts recovered in three shovel tests (0–
40 cmbs [0–16 inbs]), with the majority (n=51) recovered in ST CG-1, excavated adjacent to one
of the debris piles. Artifacts recovered in shovel tests consist of Domestic (n=20), Architectural
(n=12), Activities (n=3), Personal (n=1), and Indeterminate (n=25) items. The Domestic category
includes six ceramic sherds: one blue-tinted, high-fired ironstone (1850–1910), one blue-tinted,
non-vitrified ironstone (1850–1910), two pure white whiteware (post-1890), porcelain, and
Bristol interior/unglazed exterior stoneware. The Domestic glass includes three amber/brown,
one aqua, four ash-tint (post-1915), four colorless (post-1880), and one light green body sherd.
Finally, a tin can rim fragment with rolled rim was collected. The Architectural artifacts are a cut
nail (1840–1880), wire nails (n=7; post-1890), two light tinted and one aqua window glass
fragments, and a concrete fragment. The Activities-related items are a chunk of asphalt, a fence
staple, and a “D”-shaped handle consistent with those used on galvanized tubs. The single
Personal artifact is a copper rivet that is sheared at one end and with an embossed star on the
remaining rivet head. This artifact is interpreted as a clothing rivet. The Indeterminate category
includes a heavily corroded piece of iron that might be part of a square rod; braided iron wire that
is probably a piece of wire rope; a fragment of iron sheet metal consisting of two pieces
connected with a locked seam and evidence of a third seam; eight unidentified thin iron
fragments; 12 iron wire fragments; and two pieces of modern plastic (post-1945).
Three structures are depicted at the location of site 41VT159 on the 1927 USDA Victoria County
1:63,000-scale soils map and the 1951 USGS Bloomington 1:24,000-scale topographic map.
Additional archival research was conducted, focusing on the ownership of the property. Site
41VT159 is located on the west half of the south half of the north half of the Polito Castillo
league. In 1881, this quarter of the league was owned by Patrick Hughes, who arrived in Victoria
in 1852, and quickly established himself as a rancher. In 1865, Patrick Hughes married Eliza
Traylor, the daughter of Winn Traylor. Eliza Traylor died the following year, but prior to her
death gave birth to the couple’s only child, Eliza Hughes, who in 1882 married J. J. Welder
(Victoria Advocate 12 May 1968a). After the death of his wife, Patrick Hughes continued to live
on and maintain his ranch until 1884, at which time he sold the property to Henry C. Traylor. In
1891, Henry C. Traylor divided the land and granted 395.3 acres to his son Winn Traylor, who in
1912 sold 200 acres to Charles G. Taylor, being the same property on which sites 41VT156 and
41VT159 are located. Charles G. Taylor maintained ownership until 1919, at which time he sold
the land to C. E. Stubblefield and his wife Elizabeth Stubblefield (Gaddus et al. 1999:274). C. E.
Stubblefield maintained ownership of the property until his death in 1952, at which time it was
willed to his wife Elizabeth Stubblefield, who in 1977 sold the property to the Gulf Oil
Corporation of Pennsylvania (VCC 1953:DB 350:79; VCC 1977:DB 942:629). Between 1977
and 1980, the Gulf Oil Corporation consolidated several tracts from the Polito Castillo league and
formed one tract of land containing 1,955.21 acres that is now under the ownership of the
Victoria County Port Facilities Corporation (VCC 2007:DB 3644:11; VCC 2012:DB 3914:17).
Site 41VT159 likely represents the location of a late nineteenth- to mid-twentieth-century
farmstead. As with many of the historic period farmsteads in the region, the site may have been
occupied by a tenant farmer rather than the property owner; thus, determining the occupant at a
given period is problematic. Demolition of the associated structures has adversely affected the
site’s integrity of design and materials. Given the site’s fragmentary and redundant artifact
content, coupled with disturbances to the site by the current agricultural and ranching activities in
the vicinity, 41VT159 is considered to have little research potential. As such, the site is not likely
to yield any additional information relevant to understanding rural domestic life or community
68

and regional development in the Guadalupe River valley of the central Texas coastal region.
Thus, it is recommended that site 41VT159 is not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under the
criteria enumerated in 36 CFR 60.4 or for designation as an SAL under 13 TAC 26.8. No further
investigations are recommended at site 41VT159 for purposes of developing the proposed
Industrial Park South, as it is presently defined.

Site 41VT160
Site 41VT160 consists of a late nineteenth to early twentieth century domestic site located within
proposed Industrial Park South APE. The site occupies the northwestern portion of a pasture area
situated on a level, featureless portion of the upland coastal plain located near the now defunct
Old Bloomington Road (Figure 30). Surface artifacts were exposed in the central portion of the
site by animal (likely feral hog) rooting activity (Figure 31). Twenty-four shovel tests were
excavated to define the site boundary, in conjunction with the surface artifact scatter. Twelve
positive shovel tests occupy the northwestern portion of the pasture. Site 41VT160 encompasses
approximately 6.1 acres, measuring approximately 125 m (410 ft) northwest-to-southeast by
250 m (820 ft) northeast-to-southwest at an elevation of 19 m (62 ft) amsl. A Kinder Morgan
pipeline right-of-way intersects the site. Although currently in pasture, the field encompassing
the site was recently planted in corn, as evidenced by corn stubble and planting rows observed at
the site and in recent aerial imagery.
Soil profiles examined during this survey indicate that the site is mantled by very dark brown
(10YR 2/2) sandy clay loam that gradually transitions to dark grayish brown clay loam by depths
of approximately 40–50 cm (16–20 in). Based on maps and soil descriptions prepared by the
NRCS (2012), the site occupies an area of Telferner series fine sandy loam. The soils
encountered during this survey suggest that the site is within the Telferner fine sandy loam map
unit.
Surface artifacts observed at the site (n=17) consisted primarily of domestic artifacts, including
decorated (n=2) and undecorated refined earthenware (n=6), Bristol glazed interior/exterior
stoneware (n=2), porcelain (n=1), milk glass (n=1), and aqua glass (n=1), and architectural items
of red paste, machine-made brick fragments (n=2), a mortar fragment, and a piece of dressed
sandstone.
The collected artifact assemblage encountered at site 41VT160 includes 112 historic period
artifacts recovered in 12 shovel tests (0–40 cmbs [0–16 inbs]), as well as six artifacts from the
general surface for a total of 118 historic artifacts from the site. Historic material consists of
Domestic (n=79), Architectural (n=25), Furnishing (n=3), Activities (n=3), and Indeterminate
(n=8) items. The Domestic category is further subdivided into ceramic, glass, and metal artifacts.
The ceramics include blue-tinted, non-vitrified ironstone (n=1; 1850–1910); undecorated
porcelain (n=4) and porcelain with floral decalcomania decoration (n=1; 1890–1950); light blue
tinted whiteware (n=4; 1880–1930), pure white whiteware (n=4; post-1890), and a discolored
whiteware. The ironstone fragment (from the surface) has a partial maker’s mark stamped “. . .S
& G . . .” that might indicate either Evans & Glasson (1850–1862; Godden 1964:241)or an L. S.
& G. mark used by Rubian Art Pottery Ltd (1906–1930; Godden 1964:401, 455), but neither can
be definitively attributed to the sherd. Utilitarian ceramics include natural clay slipped
interior/Bristol exterior stoneware (n=1; 1890–1915), Bristol interior/exterior stoneware with
sponged cobalt decoration (n=1; post-1900), and a piece of buffware. The buffware sherd has a

black paste, a brown glazed interior, and a reddish-brown slipped exterior. Of the 60 Domestic
glass items collected, 58 are from body sherds, while the remaining two are bottle lip and bottle
neck. The body sherds are amber/brown (n=13), aqua (n=4), ash-tint (n=8; post-1915), colorless
(n=22; post-1880), light green (n=1), manganese/solarized (n=2; 1870s–1920), milk glass (n=3),
and olive (n=2; pre-1900 [Lindsey 2012]). The bottle lip is from an aqua bottle, but is too small
to discern more than that it was probably a bead lip. The bottle neck is also from an aqua bottle.
Although it is missing the lip, enough remains to indicate that this was a non-applied, turnmolded neck with Packer’s lip (1880–1910). The Architectural artifacts consist of colorless (n=3;
post-1880), light green (n=8), and light-tinted (n=9) window glass, wire nails (n=3; post-1890),
and a piece of slate. The Furnishings-related artifacts are two ash-tint (post-1915) and one
colorless (post-1880) lamp glass fragments. The Activities-related artifacts are a fence staple, a
piece of barbed wire, and a possible piece of safety glass. The barbed wire is composed of a twopointed barb wrapped around a single strand of wire. It is consistent with Glidden's Coil,
Hanging Barb One-Strand Variation or Glidden's Barb, One-Strand Variation (post-1876; Clifton
1970:30–31). The possible safety glass consists of a piece of clear, flat glass filled with internal
bubbles or fractures. The Indeterminate artifacts are amber/brown (n=1), colorless (n=4; post1880), and light green (n=1) angular glass fragments; an iron rod fragment; and a piece of modern
plastic (post-1945). The plastic is probably from some type of vessel, because it is curved and
laminated with thick white plastic on the interior and a thin green veneer on the exterior.
In addition to the historic period component of the site, two prehistoric artifacts were also
recovered from ST C-2. These two artifacts, both small Edwards chert core flakes, indicate the
potential of minimal use of this area at some time during the prehistoric period.

A primary structure is depicted at the location of site 41VT160 on the 1927 USDA Victoria
County 1:63,000-scale soils map and the 1951 USGS Bloomington 1:24,000-scale topographic
map. Additional archival research was conducted, focusing on the ownership of the property.
Like site 41VT157, site 41VT160 is located on the west half of the north half of the south half of
the Polito Castillo league, along the west side of Old Bloomington Road. This tract of land was
known as the H. M. Bingham 200-acre homestead in 1881 and was owned by H. M. Bingham, the
widow of Peter Byrne. Between 1881 and 1920, H. M. Bingham granted the property to Ida
Byrne, who maintained ownership of the homestead until her death in 1920. After Ida Byrne’s
death, the property was willed to her niece Elizabeth Woodhouse, who sold the portion of the
tract on the west side of Old Bloomington Road to C. H. Stiernberg and D. D. Spencer (VCC
1920:Probate Minutes [PM] 16:589; VCC 1945:DB 209:56). In 1960, C. H. Stiernberg and D. D.
Spencer sold the property to Joseph B. Bumgardner, who in 1977 sold the property to the Gulf
Oil Corporation of Pennsylvania (VCC 1960:DB 517:673; VCC 1977:DB 943:315). Between
1977 and 1980, the Gulf Oil Corporation consolidated several tracts from the Polito Castillo
league and formed one tract of land containing 1,955.21 acres that is now under the ownership of
the Victoria County Port Facilities Corporation (VCC 2007:DB 3644:11; VCC 2012:DB
3914:17).
Site 41VT160 likely represents the location of a late nineteenth- to early twentieth-century
farmstead. As with many of the historic period farmsteads in the region, the site may have been
occupied by a tenant farmer rather than the property owner; thus, determining the occupant at a
given period is problematic. Demolition of the associated structure has adversely affected the
site’s integrity of design and materials. Given the site’s fragmentary and redundant artifact
content, coupled with disturbances to the site by the Kinder Morgan pipeline and modern
agriculture, 41VT160 is considered to have little research potential. As such, the site is not likely
to yield any additional information relevant to understanding rural domestic life or community
and regional development in the Guadalupe River valley of the central Texas coastal region.
Thus, it is recommended that site 41VT160 is not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under the
criteria enumerated in 36 CFR 60.4 or for designation as an SAL under 13 TAC 26.8. No further
investigations are recommended at site 41VT160 for purposes of developing the proposed
Industrial Park South, as it is presently defined.

Site 41VT161
Site 41VT161 consists of a low-density, late nineteenth- to mid-twentieth-century domestic site
located within proposed Industrial Park South APE. The site occupies a pasture area situated on a
level, featureless portion of the upland coastal plain located adjacent to the now defunct Old
Bloomington Road (Figure 32). Fourteen shovel tests were excavated to define the site boundary,
in conjunction with the surface artifact scatter and architectural remains. Five positive shovel
tests occupy the central portion of the pasture. Site 41VT161 encompasses approximately 1.4
acres, measuring approximately 85 m (279 ft) north-to-south by 85 m (279 ft) east-to-west at an
elevation of 19 m (62 ft) amsl. A windmill and a steel stock tank are situated in the central
portion of the site (Figure 33). The ruins of a shed or barn are immediately northwest of the
windmill.
Soil profiles examined during this survey indicate that the site is mantled by very dark gray
(10YR 3/1) to black (10YR 2/1) clay. Based on maps and soil descriptions prepared by the
NRCS (2012), the site is situated in an area of Laewest clay. The soils encountered during this
survey confirm this identification.

Surface artifacts observed at the site, in addition to those observed within piles of debris
previously mentioned, consisted of two domestic artifacts, a piece of undecorated porcelain and a
faceted cobalt blue glass bead . The glass bead, which was collected, is football-shaped with a 1mm diameter hole through the long axis. It measures 20.5 mm in length and 14.5 mm at the
maximum diameter.
The subsurface artifact assemblage encountered at site 41VT161 (n=21) recovered from five
positive shovel test at depths ranging from 0–20 cmbs (0–8 inbs) consists of Domestic (n=12),
Architectural (n=5), Furnishing (n=1), and Indeterminate (n=3) artifacts. The Domestic category
contains four ceramics: blue-tinted, non-vitrified ironstone (1850–1910), pure white whiteware
(post-1890), and two piece of porcelain. The Domestic glass includes three amber/brown, one
clear (post-1880), one light tinted, and one milk glass body sherds. An amber/brown bottle lip
with Packer’s finish was also collected; unfortunately, this artifact is too heavily patinated
(“sick”) to identify whether mold seams were present. Finally, a clear glass (post-1880) basal
fragment was identified solely by its wedge-shaped cross section. The Architectural-related
artifacts are two aqua, one clear (post-1880), and two light tinted window glass fragments. The
Furnishing-related artifact is a piece of clear with ash tint lamp glass (post-1915). The
Indeterminate artifacts are two unidentified pieces of thin iron and a rubber fragment. The rubber
fragment exhibits a deep, broad incised/molded line on the exterior, whereas the interior has a
series of fine, shallowly incised/molded lines. No function is currently ascribed to this artifact.

74

A structure is depicted at the location of site 41VT161 on the 1951 USGS Bloomington 1:24,000scale topographic map. Additional archival research was conducted, focusing on the ownership
of the property. Site 41VT161 is located on the west half of the north half of the north half of the
Polito Castillo league, on a portion of land that was known as Lot Two of Block One and granted
to Walter Byrne by the Victoria County Court in 1881. Between 1881 and 1897, Walter Byrne
granted the property to Ida Byrne who in 1897 sold Lots One, Two, Three, and Four of Block
One to W. P. Stafford and C. L. Thurmond (VCC 1897:DB 36:516). Soon after obtaining the
land in 1897, W. P. Stafford and C. L. Thurmond sold a 321-acre tract to Austin Hickey (VCC
1897:DB 38:623). The 321-acre tract was located from the east bank of the Guadalupe River to
the west side of the Old Bloomington Road along the north boundary line of the Polito Castillo
league with a south boundary line along Stubblefield Road. Austin Hickey lived on the property
and maintained ownership of the 321-acre tract until his death in 1903 (Advocate 3 October
1903), at which time the land was passed to his heirs Tina Hickey, Mary Hickey, Richard Hickey,
Andrew Hickey, and Joseph Hickey. In 1905, the Austin Hickey heirs foreclosed on the property
and the 321-acre tract was sold in a Sheriff’s sale to Mary T. Glass, who sold the property to
Adolph Fromme in 1906 (VCC 1905:DB 53:186; VCC 1906:DB 56:261). Adolph Fromme is
known to have lived on the property in the “Austin Hickey Place” in ca. 1910, and maintained
ownership of the property until his death in 1943 (Daily Advocate 4 November 1910). In 1943,
the property was passed to Adolph Fromme’s widow Teresa Fromme, who maintained ownership
of the property until her death in 1976 (Advocate 18 January 1976). After the death of Teresa
Fromme, the property was willed to her two surviving sisters Ernestine Ackermann and Elizabeth
Ackermann, who in 1980 sold the property to the Gulf Oil Corporation of Pennsylvania (VCC
1980:DB 1068:473). Between 1977 and 1980, the Gulf Oil Corporation consolidated several
tracts from the Polito Castillo league and formed one tract of land containing 1,955.21 acres that
is now under the ownership of the Victoria County Port Facilities Corporation (VCC 2007:DB
3644:11; VCC 2012:DB 3914:17).

Site 41VT162
Site 41VT162 consists of a low-density, late nineteenth- to mid-twentieth-century domestic site
located within proposed Industrial Park South APE. The site occupies the boundary between an
overgrown pasture and a plowed agricultural field and is situated on a level, featureless portion of
the upland coastal plain located adjacent to the now defunct Old Bloomington Road (Figure 34).
Eleven shovel tests were excavated to define the site boundary, in conjunction with the surface
artifact scatter. The one positive shovel test is in the central portion of the site. Site 41VT162
75

encompasses approximately 1.9 acres, measuring approximately 185 m (607 ft) northeast-tosouthwest by 60 m (197 ft) northwest-to-southeast at an elevation of 19 m (62 ft) amsl. A
concrete steel stock tank are situated immediately south of the site.
Soil profiles examined during this survey indicate that the site is mantled by very dark gray
(10YR 3/1) sandy clay loam to black (10YR 2/1) clay. Based on maps and soil descriptions
prepared by the NRCS (2012), the site occupies the boundary of the Dacosta sandy clay loam and
the Laewest clay. The soils encountered during this survey confirm this identification.
Surface artifacts observed at the site (n=34) consisted largely of domestic artifacts including
undecorated refined earthenware (n=16), undecorated porcelain (n=5), porcelain with floral
design (n=1; collected), Bristol interior/exterior stoneware (n=1; post-1900), and bottle glass.
One ash-tint (post-1920) bottle finish exhibited a machine-made, continuous thread screw and a
crown or Goldy closure with a molded bead directly below the continuous thread screw element;
this artifact was also collected.
The subsurface artifact assemblage encountered at site 41VT162 consisted of a single piece of
stoneware with a salt-glazed exterior and a natural clay slipped interior (1840–1900) recovered in
ST C-3 (0–10 cmbs [0–4 inbs]).
A structure is depicted at the location of site 41VT162 on the 1927 USDA Victoria County
1:63,000-scale soils map. Additional archival research was conducted, focusing on the ownership
of the property. Site 41VT162 is located on the west half of the north half of the south half of the
Polito Castillo league, along the east side of Old Bloomington Road. In 1881, this portion of land
was known as the H. M. Bingham 200-acre homestead and was owned by H. M. Bingham, the
widow of Peter Byrne. Between 1881 and 1920, H. M. Bingham granted the property to Ida
Byrne, who maintained ownership of the homestead until her death in 1920. After Ida Byrne’s
death, the property was willed to her niece Elizabeth Woodhouse, who in that same year sold the
portion of the tract on the east side of Old Bloomington Road to Pete Rydolph and his wife
Gertrude Rydolph (VCC 1920:PM 16:589; VCC 1920:DB 96:104). In 1972, Gertrude Rydolph
granted the property to her daughter Ross Ella Giles, who in 1977 sold the property to the Gulf
Oil Corporation of Pennsylvania (VCC 1972:DB 812:823; VCC 1977:DB 955:679). Between
1977 and 1980, the Gulf Oil Corporation consolidated several tracts from the Polito Castillo
league and formed one tract of land containing 1,955.21 acres that is now under the ownership of
the Victoria County Port Facilities Corporation (VCC 2007:DB 3644:11; VCC 2012:DB

Site 41VT163
Site 41VT163 consists of a very low-density, late nineteenth- to early twentieth-century domestic
site located within proposed Industrial Park South APE. The site is situated on a level, featureless
portion of the upland coastal plain and occupies a portion of a plowed agricultural field located
adjacent to the now defunct Old Bloomington Road (Figure 35). Five shovel tests were
excavated to define the site boundary, in conjunction with the surface artifact scatter. No artifacts
were recovered in any of the shovel tests within or surrounding the site. Site 41VT163
encompasses approximately 0.5 acres, measuring approximately 100 m (328 ft) northeast-tosouthwest by 25 m (82 ft) northwest-to-southeast at an elevation of 19 m (62 ft) amsl.
Soil profiles examined during this survey indicate that the site is mantled by very dark gray
(10YR 3/1) to black (10YR 2/1) clay. Based on maps and soil descriptions prepared by the
NRCS (2012), the site occupies the boundary of the Dacosta sandy clay loam and the Laewest
clay. The soils encountered during this survey confirm this identification.
Surface artifacts observed at the site (n=9) consisted largely of historic period domestic artifacts
including undecorated refined earthenware (n=3), undecorated porcelain (n=1), a ceramic tile
(n=1), solarized/manganese glass (n=1; post-1900), and two brick fragments. A single prehistoric
artifact, consisting of a medial fragment of a biface, represents the only prehistoric artifact
associated with the site. This lone prehistoric artifact may represent a hunting loss or an item
collected and brought to the site by its historic period inhabitants.
A structure is depicted at the location of site 41VT163 on the 1927 USDA Victoria County
1:63,000-scale soils map. Additional archival research was conducted, focusing on the ownership
of the property. The site is located on the west half of the north half of the north half of the Polito
Castillo league, on a portion of land that was known as Lot Four of Block One and granted to H.
M. Bingham by the Victoria County Court in 1881. Between 1881 and 1897, H. M. Bingham
granted the property to Ida Byrne, who in 1897 sold Lots One, Two, Three, and Four of Block
One to W. P. Stafford and C. L. Thurmond (VCC 1897:DB 36:516). Between 1897 and 1924, the
property was granted to L. G. Kreisle, who owned the land until his death in 1924. After the
death of L. G. Kreisle, the land was willed to his brother Emil Kreisle of San Antonio (VCC
1924:DB 105:29). Emil Kreisle continued to maintain a permanent residence in San Antonio
until his death in 1945, but according to his obituary, he was devoted to farming and ranching in
his later years (San Antonio Express 17 November 1945). Between 1924 and 1945, Emil Kreisle
granted the property to his daughter Myrtle Kreisle Trip, who in 1974 granted the property to her
son Gustav T. Trip Jr. (VCC 1974:DB 860:476). In 1975, Gustav T. Trip Jr. granted the property
to his cousins Lexina K. Miguez and Lissette Trip Wilson, who in 1977 sold the property to the
Gulf Oil Corporation of Pennsylvania (VCC 1975:DB 869:255; VCC 1977:DB 942:655).
Between 1977 and 1980, the Gulf Oil Corporation consolidated several tracts from the Polito
Castillo league and formed one tract of land containing 1,955.21 acres that is now under the
ownership of the Victoria County Port Facilities Corporation (VCC 2007:DB 3644:11; VCC
2012:DB 3914:17).
Site 41VT163 likely represents the location of a late nineteenth- to early twentieth-century
farmstead. As with many of the historic period farmsteads in the region, the site may have been
occupied by a tenant farmer rather than the property owner; thus, determining the precise
occupant at a given period is problematic. Demolition of the associated structures has adversely
affected the site’s integrity of design and materials. Given the site’s minimal and fragmentary
78

artifact content, coupled with disturbances to the site by the current agricultural and ranching
activities in the vicinity, 41VT163 is considered to have little research potential. As such, the site
is not likely to yield any additional information relevant to understanding rural domestic life or
community and regional development in the Guadalupe River valley of the central Texas coastal
region. Thus, it is recommended that site 41VT163 is not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP
under the criteria enumerated in 36 CFR 60.4 or for designation as an SAL under 13 TAC 26.8.
No further investigations are recommended at site 41VT163 for purposes of developing the
proposed Industrial Park South, as it is presently defined.

Site 41VT164
Site 41VT164 consists of a low-density, late nineteenth- to early twentieth-century domestic site
located within proposed Industrial Park South APE. The site is situated on a level, featureless
portion of the upland coastal plain and occupies a portion of an overgrown pasture located
adjacent to McCoy Road (Figure 36). Eleven shovel tests were excavated to define the site
boundary, in conjunction with the surface artifact scatter. One positive shovel test was
encountered in the central portion of the site. Site 41VT164 encompasses approximately 0.4
acres, measuring approximately 55 m (180 ft) north-to-south by 55 m (180 ft) east-to-west at an
elevation of 19 m (62 ft) amsl.
Soil profiles examined during this survey indicate that the site is mantled by very dark gray
(10YR 3/1) to black (10YR 2/1) clay. Based on maps and soil descriptions prepared by the
NRCS (2012), the site occupies an area of the undifferentiated Dacosta-Contee complex. The
soils encountered during this survey support this identification.
Surface artifacts observed at the site (n=10) consisted largely of historic period domestic artifacts
including undecorated refined earthenware (n=3), a milk glass canning jar lid insert (n=1), thick
plate glass (n=1), milk glass (n=1), and four brick fragments. An additional fragment of
undecorated refined earthenware was observed outside of the project area to the southeast.
The subsurface artifact assemblage from 41VT164 consists of three Domestic artifacts recovered
from a depth of 10 to 30 cmbs (4 to 12 inbs) in ST BL-1. All of the artifacts recovered in the
shovel test are ceramics and include one fragment of blue-tinted, non-vitrified ironstone (1850–
1910), a light blue tinted whiteware (1880–1930), and a pure white whiteware sherd (post-1890).
A structure is depicted at the location of site 41VT164 on the 1927 USDA Victoria County
1:63,000-scale soils map. Additional archival research was conducted, focusing on the ownership
of the property. The site is located on the west half of the south half of the south half of the
Polito Castillo league. In 1881, this portion of land was owned by Winn Traylor, who moved to
Victoria County in 1840, and established himself as ranchman. Winn Traylor lived on the west
side of the property, near the Guadalupe River, until his death in 1882 (Victoria Advocate 12 May
1968b). After the death of Winn Traylor, it is unknown to whom the property was passed, but it
was probably inherited by his heirs. In 1934, Mrs. Lena Mae Traylor, et ux., granted the property
to John W. Maroney, who between 1934 and 1945 granted the property to D. D. Spencer and wife
Opal Spencer (VCC 1945:DB 204:343). Between 1945 and 1972, D. D. Spencer and Opal
Spencer sold the property to Pete Rydolph and his wife Gertrude Rydolph. In 1972, Gertrude
Rydolph granted the property to her daughter Ross Ella Giles, who in 1977 sold the property to
80

the Gulf Oil Corporation of Pennsylvania (VCC 1972:DB 812:823; VCC 1977:DB 955:679).
Between 1977 and 1980, the Gulf Oil Corporation consolidated several tracts from the Polito
Castillo league and formed one tract of land containing 1,955.21 acres that is now under the
ownership of the Victoria County Port Facilities Corporation (VCC 2007:DB 3644:11; VCC
2012:DB 3914:17).
Site 41VT164 likely represents the location of a late nineteenth- to early twentieth-century

designation as an SAL under 13 TAC 26.8. No further investigations are recommended at site
41VT164 for purposes of developing the proposed Industrial Park South, as it is presently
defined.

Site 41VT165
Site 41VT165 consists of a prehistoric habitation site located within proposed Industrial Park
South APE. The site is situated on an upland escarpment above the former channel of Black
Bayou, now an intermittent stream that has been dammed for use as a stock tank. An unnamed
two-track road bisects the site. Thirty-nine shovel tests were excavated to define the site
boundary, in conjunction with the surface artifact scatter (Figure 37). Ten positive shovel tests
were encountered, with the majority clustering around the central portion of the site. Site
41VT165 encompasses approximately 3.3 acres, measuring approximately 140 m (560 ft) northto-south by 150 m (492 ft) east-to-west at an elevation ranging from 11 to 16 m (36 to 52 ft) amsl.
Soil profiles examined during this survey indicate that the summit of the landform is mantled by
very dark gray (10YR 3/1) to black (10YR 2/1) clay loam, with dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2)
fine sandy loam occurring on the slope around the summit of the landform. This is nearly
opposite the data provided by the NRCS (2012); current investigations indicate that erosion has
likely removed the sandy mantle that once occupied the summit of the landform and redeposited
it along the adjacent slopes.
Surface artifacts observed at the site (n=33) consisted primarily of chipped lithic debitage (n=28)
exposed within the two-track road bisecting the site. Three surface lithics, all of chert, were
collected from the two-track road at the crest of the knoll: two biface thinning flakes and a small
edge-modified flake with a minimally worked distal edge forming a small concavity. Several
marine and brackish water mollusk shells were also observed and are presumably part of the
prehistoric archeological assemblage. Only two historic periods artifacts, consisting of aqua
bottle glass and a single chain link, also exposed within the two-track road were present.

82

The subsurface artifact assemblage from 41VT165 consists of 17 chipped lithic artifacts, several
fragments of burned clay, and several fragments of burned shell. Of the chipped lithic artifacts,
the majority consists of chipped lithic debitage (n=16); seven are biface thinning flakes and one is
a primary reduction core flake. The remaining eight flake fragments are fragmentary and could
not be classified with more detail. A single chipped lithic tool, a distal fragment of a biface, was
recovered. Unfortunately, the biface is too fragmentary to be temporally or functionally
diagnostic, although it likely was part of a Late Archaic period dart point. The majority of the
artifacts recovered from shovel tests (n=15) at site 41VT165 were encountered in the uppermost
30 cm (12 in), with the exception of two pieces of debitage recovered from 40 to 50 cmbs (16 to
20 inbs) and 60 to 70 cmbs (24 to 28 inbs) in ST CG-11, located on the western slope of the
landform (see Figure 37). Burned clay, burned shell, and charcoal were noted in STs CG-4, CG5, CG-6, and CG-21. With the exception of ST CG-4, all of the shovel tests that exhibited
evidence of midden deposits (i.e., burned clay, burned shell, and charcoal) were located along the
shoulder slope that retains a portion of the loose, fine sandy loam surface soil. It is likely that the
midden deposit has eroded from the summit of the landform. The accumulation of surface
artifacts along the shoulder slope within the two-track road and a series of narrow linear gullies
roughly paralleling the two-track road in the southwestern portion of the site provide
corroborating evidence of slope erosion at the site.
Site 41VT165 represents a prehistoric habitation site of uncertain temporal affiliation. The
cultural deposits at the site have likely lost their original integrity due to erosion of the fine sandy
loam soils at the site. Although some midden-like deposits were encountered on the shoulder
slope of the landform, these deposits are likely to have been eroded from the landform summit.
No temporally diagnostic artifacts were recovered at the site, and no cultural features were
encountered. Given the site’s minimal and fragmentary artifact content, coupled with
disturbances to the site by natural and artificial erosion due to historic and modern agricultural
and ranching activities in the vicinity, 41VT165 unlikely to retain sufficient data to contribute
important information regarding prehistoric technology, settlement-subsistence patterns, or extraregional interaction. As such, the site is considered to have little research potential. The site is
not likely to yield any additional information relevant to understanding the prehistoric period
within the central Texas coastal region. Thus, it is recommended that site 41VT165 is not eligible
for inclusion in the NRHP under the criteria enumerated in 36 CFR 60.4 or for designation as an
SAL under 13 TAC 26.8. No further investigations are recommended at site 41VT165 for
purposes of developing the proposed Industrial Park South, as it is presently defined.

Site 41VT166
Site 41VT166 consists of a low-density prehistoric site with a late nineteenth- to early twentiethcentury domestic component located within proposed Industrial Park South APE. The site is
situated on a dissected upland escarpment, likely a High Deweyville terrace (Figure 38).
Currently in pasture, the groundcover consists of a wide array of forbs, grasses, and herbaceous
plants (Figure 39). The site was initially discovered during the survey of the Guadalupe River
valley margin (high probability area [HPA]) when a shovel test (HPA ST CG-12) encountered
bone fragments and a charcoal fragment between 80 and 100 cmbs (32 and 39 inbs). Although
the results of the shovel test are ambiguous (i.e., not definitively cultural in origin and not
temporally diagnostic), additional radial shovel tests were excavated to determine if cultural
deposits were, in fact, present at the location. Radial shovel tests excavated at 20-m intervals in
two orthogonal directions from HPA ST CG-12 encountered both prehistoric and historic
84

artifacts. Thirty-three shovel tests were excavated to define the site boundary (see Figure 38).
No surface artifacts were encountered at the site. Nine additional positive shovel tests were
encountered on the summit and along the eastern shoulder slope of the landform. Site 41VT166
encompasses approximately 1.7 acres, measuring approximately 90 m (295 ft) north-to-south by
103 m (338 ft) east-to-west at an elevation of range of 10 to 14 m (33 to 46 ft) amsl.
Soil profiles examined during this survey indicate that the western portion of the site is mantled
by very pale brown (10YR 7/4) loamy fine sand to depths extending to 100 cmbs (40 inbs)
overlying brown (7.5YR 5/4) sandy clay. Ant mound spoils observed in the southern portion of
the site indicate that the deeply buried brown sandy clay Bt horizon is being brought to the
surface by the insects. Soils in the eastern portion of the site consist of dark grayish brown
(10YR 4/2) fine sandy loam extending to approximately 50 cmbs (20 inbs) and overlying very
dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) sandy clay loam in the eastern portion of the site. Based on maps
and soil descriptions prepared by the NRCS (2012), the site occupies the interface between Kuy
loamy sand and Runge fine sandy loam. The soils encountered during this survey support this
identification.
No surface artifacts were observed at the site. The subsurface artifact assemblage from 41VT166
consists of both prehistoric and historic artifacts. Prehistoric artifacts were encountered in nine of
the 10 positive shovel tests, but historic period artifacts were confined to five shovel tests
generally along the summit of the landform (see Figure 38).

86

Prehistoric artifacts recovered from site 41VT166 consist of 25 chipped lithic artifacts. The
dominant artifact class is chipped lithic debitage (n=21), consisting of one blade, eight biface
thinning flakes, one core flake, six fragmentary flakes that could not be classified in more detail,
and five fragments of angular or blocky chipping debris (shatter). In addition, two unifacial tools,
one bifacial knife, and one biface fragment are present in the assemblage. The biface fragment is
a medial portion of a probable arrow point, indicating a Late Prehistoric occupation at the site;
however, the artifact is too fragmentary to be stylistically diagnostic. Prehistoric artifacts were
recovered at depths between 0 and 90 cmbs (0 and 35 inbs) across the site with no significant
concentrations in the vertical profile. The majority of the prehistoric artifacts (n=18) were
recovered from STs CG-9, CG-12, CG-13, and CG-14, which form a transect that traverses the
major axis of the landform (see Figure 38).
Twenty-seven historic period artifacts were collected from site 41VT166, consisting of
Architectural (n=14), Domestic (n=7), Furnishing (n=4), and Indeterminate (n=2) artifacts. The
Thirteen cut nails (1840–1880) and one light green window glass fragment represent the
Architecture-related artifacts recovered from the site. The Domestic category contains four
ceramics: a blue-tinted, high-fired ironstone (1850–1910), a blue-tinted, non-vitrified ironstone
(1850–1910), pure white whiteware (post-1890), and alkaline glazed interior/exterior stoneware
(1840–1900). The three Domestic glass include amber/brown, clear with ash tint (post-1915),
and olive (pre-1900; Lindsey 2012a) body sherds. The Furnishing-related artifacts are three light
tinted and one colorless (post-1880) lamp glass fragments. The Indeterminate artifacts are two
pieces of iron wire. Historic period artifacts were recovered at depths between 10 and 80 cmbs (4
and 32 inbs). The majority of the historic period artifacts were recovered from Level 7 (60–70
cmbs [24–28 inbs]; n=10) and Level 8 (70–80 cmbs [28–32 inbs]; n=6). Historic period artifacts
were encountered across the most level portion of the landform and were concentrated in STs
CG-5 (n=8) and ST CG-9 (n=12).
No structures are depicted at the location of site 41VT166 on either the 1927 USDA Victoria
County 1:63,000-scale soils map or the 1951 USGS Bloomington 1:24,000-scale topographic
map. Additional archival research was conducted, focusing on the ownership of the property.
The site is located on the west half of the north half of the north half of the Polito Castillo league,
on a portion of land that was known as Lot One of Block One and granted to Ida Byrne by the
Victoria County Court in 1881. Ida Byrne maintained ownership of the land until 1897, at which
time she sold Lots One, Two, Three, and Four of Block One to W. P. Stafford and C. L.
Thurmond (VCC 1897:DB 36:516). Soon after obtaining the land in 1897, W. P. Stafford and C.
L. Thurmond sold a 321-acre tract to Austin Hickey (VCC 1897:DB 38:623). The 321-acre tract
was located from the east bank of the Guadalupe River to the west side of the Old Bloomington
Road along the north boundary line of the Polito Castillo league with a south boundary line along
Stubblefield Road. Austin Hickey lived on the property and maintained ownership of the 321acre tract until his death in 1903 (Advocate 3 October 1903), at which time the land was passed to
his heirs Tina Hickey, Mary Hickey, Richard Hickey, Andrew Hickey, and Joseph Hickey. In
1905, the Austin Hickey heirs foreclosed on the property and the 321-acre tract was sold in a
Sheriff’s sale to Mary T. Glass, who sold the property to Adolph Fromme in 1906 (VCC
1905:DB 53:186; VCC 1906:DB 56:261). Adolph Fromme is known to have lived on the
property in the “Austin Hickey Place” in ca. 1910, and maintained ownership of the property until
his death in 1943 (Daily Advocate 4 November 1910). In 1943, the property was passed to
Adolph Fromme’s widow Teresa Fromme, who maintained ownership of the property until her
death in 1976 (Advocate 18 January 1976). After the death of Teresa Fromme, the property was
willed to her two surviving sisters Ernestine Ackermann and Elizabeth Ackermann, who in 1980
87

sold the property to the Gulf Oil Corporation of Pennsylvania (VCC 1980:DB 1068:473).
Between 1977 and 1980, the Gulf Oil Corporation consolidated several tracts from the Polito
Castillo league and formed one tract of land containing 1,955.21 acres that is now under the
ownership of the Victoria County Port Facilities Corporation (VCC 2007:DB 3644:11; VCC
2012:DB 3914:17).
Site 41VT166 represents a prehistoric habitation site of uncertain temporal affiliation with
evidence of a late nineteenth- to early twentieth-century domestic occupation. The cultural
deposits have likely lost their original integrity due to bioturbation of the deep loamy sands at the
site. This is exemplified by the majority of historic period artifacts occurring below the majority
of the prehistoric artifacts recovered from the site, despite the lack of evidence for historic period
trash pits or privies to explain the mixed deposits. No temporally diagnostic prehistoric artifacts
were recovered at the site, and no cultural features were encountered. The site may have been
occupied by Austin Hickey and/or Adolph Fromme in the late nineteenth century and early
twentieth century, respectively. However, as with many of the historic period farmsteads in the
region, the site may also have been occupied by a tenant farmer rather than the property owner,
making a precise association of occupancy at a given period problematic. Demolition of the
associated structure or structures has adversely affected the site’s integrity of design and
materials. Given the site’s minimal and fragmentary artifact content, coupled with disturbances
to the site by bioturbation and natural and artificial erosion due to historic and modern
agricultural and ranching activities in the vicinity, 41VT166 is unlikely to retain sufficient data to
contribute important information regarding technology, settlement-subsistence patterns, or extraregional interaction during the prehistoric period or rural domestic life and community and
regional development in the Guadalupe River valley or Victoria County during the historic
period. As such, the site is considered to have little research potential. The site is not likely to
yield any additional information relevant to understanding the prehistoric or historic periods
within the central Texas coastal region. Thus, it is recommended that site 41VT166 is not eligible
for inclusion in the NRHP under the criteria enumerated in 36 CFR 60.4 or for designation as an
SAL under 13 TAC 26.8. No further investigations are recommended at site 41VT166 for
purposes of developing the proposed Industrial Park South, as it is presently defined.

Site 41VT167
Site 41VT167 consists of a possible low-density prehistoric lithic scatter and a low-density, earlyto-mid-twentieth-century historic activity area located within the proposed Industrial Park South
APE. The site is situated on a level portion of the Guadalupe River floodplain and occupies the
western corner of a pasture located adjacent to Stubblefield Road (Figure 40). Four shovel tests
were excavated in an attempt to define the site boundary, but no subsurface artifacts were
encountered. The site boundary is defined within the surface artifact scatter. Site 41VT167
encompasses approximately 0.6 acres, measuring approximately 70 m (230 ft) north-to-south by
50 m (164 ft) east-to-west at an elevation of 5 m (16 ft) amsl.
Soil profiles examined during this survey indicate that the site is mantled by very dark gray
(10YR 3/1) clay or clay loam. Based on maps and soil descriptions prepared by the NRCS
(2012), the site occupies an area of Meguin silty clay. The soils encountered during this survey
support this identification.

88

Surface artifacts observed at the site (n=10) consisted of six possible pieces of prehistoric chert
debitage and four historic period domestic artifacts including undecorated refined earthenware
(n=1), stoneware with natural clay slipped interior/exterior (n=1), milk glass (n=1), and aqua
bottle glass (n=1). Identification of the six prehistoric artifacts is tenuous due to the presence of
chert cobbles and gravels within Stubblefield Road. All observed materials at the site were
situated within Stubblefield Road or around the western edge of the adjacent agricultural field.
No artifacts were collected from the site.
No structures are depicted at the location of site 41VT167 on either the 1927 USDA Victoria
County 1:63,000-scale soils map or the 1951 USGS Bloomington 1:24,000-scale topographic
map. Additional archival research was conducted, focusing on the ownership of the property.
The site is located on the west half of the north half of the north half of the Polito Castillo league,
on a portion of land that was known as Lot Five of Block One and granted to Robert Byrne by the
Victoria County Court in 1881. Between 1881 and 1897, Robert Byrne granted the property to
W. P. Stafford and C. L. Thurmond, who sold a 321-acre tract, containing a portion of Lot Five,
to Austin Hickey (VCC 1897:DB 38:623). The 321-acre tract was located from the east bank of
the Guadalupe River to the west side of the Old Bloomington Road along the north boundary line
of the Polito Castillo league with a south boundary line along Stubblefield Road. Austin Hickey
lived on the property and maintained ownership of the 321-acre tract until his death in 1903
(Advocate 3 October 1903), at which time the land was passed to his heirs Tina Hickey, Mary
Hickey, Richard Hickey, Andrew Hickey, and Joseph Hickey. In 1905, the Austin Hickey heirs
foreclosed on the property and the 321-acre tract was sold in a Sheriff’s sale to Mary T. Glass,
who sold the property to Adolph Fromme in 1906 (VCC 1905:DB 53:186; VCC 1906:DB
56:261). Adolph Fromme is known to have lived on the property in the “Austin Hickey Place” in
ca. 1910, and maintained ownership of the property until his death in 1943 (Daily Advocate 4
November 1910). In 1943, the property was passed to Adolph Fromme’s widow Teresa Fromme,
who maintained ownership of the property until her death in 1976 (Advocate 18 January 1976).
After the death of Teresa Fromme, the property was willed to her two surviving sisters Ernestine
Ackermann and Elizabeth Ackermann, who in 1980 sold the property to the Gulf Oil Corporation
of Pennsylvania (VCC 1980:DB 1068:473). Between 1977 and 1980, the Gulf Oil Corporation
consolidated several tracts from the Polito Castillo league and formed one tract of land containing
1,955.21 acres that is now under the ownership of the Victoria County Port Facilities Corporation
(VCC 2007:DB 3644:11; VCC 2012:DB 3914:17).
Interpretation of site function at 41VT167 is problematic. The chert debris accumulated at the
site may have been transported to the location with road surfacing materials, or has been created
by vehicle traffic over chert road surfacing material. The historic period artifacts at the site likely
represent an early-to-mid-twentieth-century activity area related to local agricultural operations,
such as a convenient location to eat lunch while working in the fields. Given the site’s minimal
and redundant artifact content, 41VT167 is considered to have little research potential. As such,
the site is unlikely to retain sufficient data to contribute important information regarding
technology, settlement-subsistence patterns, or extra-regional interaction during the prehistoric
period or rural domestic life and community and regional development in the Guadalupe River
valley or Victoria County during the historic period. Thus, it is recommended that site 41VT167
is not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under the criteria enumerated in 36 CFR 60.4 or for
designation as an SAL under 13 TAC 26.8. No further investigations are recommended at site
41VT167 for purposes of developing the proposed Industrial Park South, as it is presently
defined.

Site 41VT98, revisited
Site 41VT98, also known as the Buckeye Knoll site, consists of a prehistoric habitation site and
associated cemetery located on both sides of the Victoria Barge Canal near its intersection with
DuPont Road. The site was initially discovered in the 1960s by vocational archeologist Ed Vogt
during the construction of the barge canal (Weinstein 1992:271). The site was formally recorded
in 1982 by Carolyn Good during a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reconnaissance survey of the
barge canal prior to its expansion (Weinstein 1992:274). Due to limited access and the lack of
subsurface testing, Good was not able to fully evaluate the site, but determined that cultural
materials existed on both sides of the barge canal. In 1989, a large portion of the site west of the
barge canal was subjected to extensive excavations to determine the NRHP eligibility of the site
(Weinstein 1992), although the 1989 investigation also included a small portion of the site to the
east of the barge canal (Weinstein 1992:277–283). Investigations east of the barge canal
consisted of 14 auger tests and the excavation of one 1-x-1-m test unit. These investigations
indicated that deposits east of the barge canal differed significantly from those encountered in
excavations west of the barge canal. Excavations west of the barge canal encountered thick
prehistoric midden deposits, a suite of temporally diagnostic artifacts, and abundant faunal
remains, but the excavations east of the barge canal recovered only minor amounts of
nondiagnostic prehistoric lithic debris. Based on the findings of the 1989 excavations, the site
was deemed eligible for inclusion in the NRHP (Weinstein 1992:327). Site 41VT98 was briefly
revisited in 1991 during a pipeline relocation project when additional auger tests and an
additional 1-x-1-m test unit was excavated in the southwestern portion of the site (Weinstein
1991). In 2000 and 2001, data recovery excavations to mitigate the adverse effects related to the
expansion of the Victoria Barge Canal on site 41VT98 were conducted. The site is now
understood to span prehistory from the Late Paleoindian to the Late Prehistoric periods and
preserves one of the earliest and largest prehistoric cemeteries in North America. Seventy-five
burials, primarily dating to the Early Archaic period, were excavated at the site, yielding evidence
a complex mortuary tradition based on individual status and the incorporation of exotic prestige
items with the burials of high status individuals. Excavations at the site provided a wealth of
knowledge regarding the regional prehistoric chronology, evidence of extra-regional trade,
complex mortuary behaviors, and hunter-gatherer subsistence data. Although publication of the
final report of the project is forthcoming (Ricklis 2007), a recent article summarizes the findings
of the investigations (Ricklis 2011).
Site 41VT98 is situated on a dissected upland escarpment extending into the Guadalupe River
valley. The site is bisected by the Victoria Barge Canal. The western portion of the site has been
the focus of archeological mitigation and research in recent decades. Conversely, the portion of
the site east of the barge canal has had relatively little attention from archeologists due to its
apparent lack of dense prehistoric cultural deposits and its location outside of the barge canal
right-of-way. The eastern portion of the site does, however, extend into the proposed Industrial
Park South APE. Therefore, this area of the site was revisited as part of this survey effort.
One hundred fourteen shovel tests were excavated to define the site boundary within the proposed
Industrial Park South APE (Figure 41). Forty-eight positive shovel tests were encountered across
the summits and shoulder slopes of the three contiguous portions of the landform. The eastern
portion of site 41VT98, within the Industrial Park South APE, encompasses approximately 9.2
acres, measuring approximately 190 m (623 ft) north-to-south by 380 m (1,247 ft) east-to-west at
an elevation range of 8 to 15 m (26 to 49 ft) amsl (Figure 42).

Soil profiles examined during this survey indicate that the portion of the site investigated is
mantled by very pale brown (10YR 7/4) loamy fine sand to depths extending to 100 cmbs (40
inbs), overlying brown (7.5YR 5/4) or reddish yellow (7.5YR 7/8) sandy clay. Ant mound spoils
observed near the eastern margin of the site indicate that the deeply buried reddish yellow sandy
clay Bt horizon is being brought to the surface by the insects. Based on maps and soil
descriptions prepared by the NRCS (2012), the soils at the site are mapped as Kuy loamy sand.
The soils encountered during this survey support this identification, although the northern
(upslope) extension of the nearby Meguin floodplain soils is overestimated in NRCS data.
Two surface artifacts, consisting of chipped lithic debitage found near the eastern margin of the
Victoria Barge Canal, were encountered at the site.
The collected prehistoric artifact assemblage from 41VT166 consists of 247 artifacts encountered
in 48 positive shovel tests and one flake from the general surface. The majority of the artifacts
(n=243) consist of chipped stone debitage recovered from 0–130 cmbs (0–52 inbs). Debitage, in
turn, consists of biface thinning flakes (n=117), core flakes (n=20), blades (n=5), blocky or
angular debris (shatter; n=14), and flake fragments that could not be classified in more detail
(n=87). In addition, three edge-modified unifacial tools and one biface fragment were recovered
from depths ranging from 40 to 110 cmbs (16–43 inbs). The biface fragment is too fragmentary
to be stylistically or temporally diagnostic. The majority of the chipped stone (n=241) was
produced from various cherts. Finally, one half of an intensively burned siliceous concretion,
measuring 33.13 mm in length, 48.1 mm in width, and 17.69 mm in thickness and weighing 29.8
grams, representing a possible hammerstone or mano, was recovered from a depth of 100 to 110
93

cmbs (39 to 43 inbs) in ST CG-4. The prehistoric artifacts recovered at depths between 0 and 130
cmbs (0 and 51 inbs) across the site showed with no significant differences between Levels 3
through 10 (30–100 cmbs [12–39 inbs]) in the vertical profile. Although artifacts were recovered
from depths greater than 100 cmbs (39 inbs), too few shovel tests were excavated to depths
greater than 100 cmbs (n=6) to provide a statistically valid sample. Shovel tests with the largest
amount of recovered artifacts are STs CG-4 and CG-1, with 30 and 31 artifacts, respectively
(Figure 43). Artifact density at the site is concentrated on the summit of the westernmost knoll.

43. Site 41VT98 artifact density map

Figure 43. Site 41VT98 artifact density map.

In addition to the prehistoric material, two pieces of modern translucent plastic sheeting (post1945) were found in SH WH-6 at 80–90 cmbs (32–35 inbs) and likely associated with pipeline
installation south of this shovel test.
The eastern portion of site 41VT98 most likely represents prehistoric hunting loci within the
overall site context. The vast majority of artifacts recovered within the eastern portion of the site
is classified as bifacial thinning flakes, consistent with refurbishing chipped stone tools. No
organic-rich midden deposits, like those encountered on the western portion of the site, appear to
be present within the eastern portion of the site. The cultural deposits within the uppermost 100
cmbs (39 inbs) have likely lost their original integrity due to bioturbation of the deep loamy sands
at the site and by ground-disturbing activities associated with the construction of a buried pipeline
that parallels DuPont Road through a portion of the site (see Figure 41). No temporally
diagnostic prehistoric artifacts were recovered within the eastern portion of the site, and no
cultural features were encountered. The uppermost 100 cmbs (39 inbs) of site 41VT98 is unlikely
94

to retain sufficient data to contribute important information regarding technology, settlementsubsistence patterns, or extra-regional interaction during the prehistoric period due to minimal
artifact content, bioturbation, and industrial disturbances. As such, the shallow portion of the site
is considered to have little research potential and is not likely to yield any additional information
relevant to understanding the prehistoric period within the central Texas coastal region.
However, more well-preserved deposits may exist beyond the depth evaluated by shovel testing.
Based on previous excavation data from the western portion of the site, as well as nearby site
41VT94, significant cultural deposits, including burials and other mortuary remains, may be
preserved at depths that could not be evaluated via shovel testing. Thus, it is recommended that
deep testing via backhoe trenching be conducted to evaluate the potential for deeply buried
deposits at the portion of site 41VT98 within the Industrial Park South APE if this area will be
adversely affected by ground disturbing activities.

Unnamed Cemetery (41VT168)
During the course of these investigations, an unnamed early-to-mid-twentieth-century cemetery
was located within proposed Industrial Park South APE (Figure 44). The cemetery is situated on
the toe slope of the Guadalupe River valley margin and extends to the floodplain, occupying a
pasture adjacent to several large live oaks (Figure 45). The cemetery is delineated by a modern
wire fence and a gate, but is overgrown with thistle and other herbaceous weeds and wildflowers.
Several small fragments of concrete and mortar were observed within the fenced enclosure. One
small mortar fragment was decorated with several marine shells adhered to it. Two wooden
posts, one with attached barbed wire remnants and another exhibiting hinge hardware, were
located and mapped within the fenced enclosure (see Figure 44). These posts are likely to have
either marked the original entrance to the cemetery or served to delineate part of a family plot
within it. One monument, constructed of concrete coated with mortar, is in relatively good
condition and records the name and dates: “ANDREW LEWIS. / BoRN.MAY.13.1867. / DIED.
DEC. 9.1946.” (Figure 46). Archival research indicates that an Anderson Lewis was born in the
nearby town of McFaddin on 17 February 1867, and died on 9 December 1946, in Bloomington.
It is likely that Anderson Lewis was a tenant farmer on the property or one of the associated
properties during the early to mid-twentieth century. Two large masses of rough concrete may
represent additional monuments. The number of additional interments and the identities of those
interred could not be ascertained through archival research.
For purposes of this survey, the cemetery boundary is defined as the modern fenced enclosure.
No excavations took place in the vicinity of the cemetery. No evidence of graves was observed
outside of the fenced enclosure. The unnamed cemetery encompasses approximately 0.7 acres,
and measures approximately 45 m (148 ft) northeast-to-southwest by 133 m (436 ft) northwestto-southeast at an elevation range of 5–8 m (16–26 ft) amsl.
This unnamed cemetery is likely to represent a family or community cemetery, perhaps for
tenants of the surrounding farmsteads, in use at least during the 1940s. Cemeteries are typically
not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under the criteria enumerated in 36 CFR 60.4 or for
designation as an SAL under 13 TAC 26.8. However, it is recommended that this cemetery
(41VT168) be avoided by ground-disturbing activities associated with the development of the
Industrial Park South.

Isolated Surface Artifacts
Based on systematic surface inspection of the proposed project areas, 13 historic period artifacts
and four prehistoric artifacts were located as isolated surface artifacts. Typically, shovel tests
were excavated at or near the locations of these isolates to determine if additional extensive
deposits were present in these locations. In the absence of additional artifacts, these isolated
surface finds were simply documented by location and content. Although isolated surface
artifacts were typically not collected, but merely documented as to location and content, a single
stoneware fragment from Isolate 3, was collected (Table 4; see Figure 14).

None of the isolated surface artifacts documented during this survey is believed to have the
potential to contribute significant information regarding the history of the area. In the absence of
additional artifacts in more well-preserved contexts, none of these isolated surface finds meets the
criteria for archeological site designation and is therefore not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP
or for designation as an SAL, as per 36 CFR 60.4, 13 TAC 26.5(6), 13 TAC 26.5(32), and 13
TAC 26.8. It is therefore recommended that no further work is necessary at these locations.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

SUMMARY
This cultural resources survey was undertaken to document and assess cultural resources within
the 7.6-acre APE for expansion of the Pickering Basin infrastructure and within the 1,390-acre
APE for the development of proposed the Industrial Park South and to provide adequate and
relevant information for use in the management of cultural resources within the project area.
Information regarding previously recorded archeological sites was gathered through a literature
review as well as a review of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas online database maintained by
the THC. Prior to field investigations at the proposed project area, a suite of archival sources
including historic aerial photographs and maps was examined to determine the former locations
of historic-age structures within the project area. Due to the variability of archeological site
potential across the survey areas, a survey strategy consisting of systematic shovel testing and
backhoe trenching was employed during this cultural resources survey. Shovel testing was
performed in systematic 100-m intervals across the Guadalupe River valley margin, in 3-acre
intervals across the Pleistocene uplands, in areas where surface artifacts were present, and to
define archeological site boundaries. Systematic backhoe trenching across the Guadalupe River
floodplain was also conducted. In total, 685 shovel tests and 37 backhoe trenches were excavated
within the proposed project areas (see Figure 12). All shovel tests and backhoe trenches were
excavated on property owned by the Port of Victoria. The depths of shovel test excavations were
highly variable across the project area and ranged from 20 to 130 cm (8 to 51 in) in depth.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Thirteen new archeological sites were documented and one previously recorded site, 41VT98,
was revisited during the course of these investigations. Sites 41VT155, 41VT156, 41VT157,
41VT158, 41VT159, 41VT160, 41VT161, 41VT162, 41VT163, 41VT164, 41VT166, and
41VT167 represent or have components that represent late nineteenth- to mid-twentieth-century
domestic sites (Table 5). All of these sites have been adversely affected by demolition and
modern agricultural practices. Furthermore, associating occupancy of these sites with owners and
tenants based on archival information is problematic. The integrity of location, design, materials,

Recommendation

and association is severely compromised at all of these sites. The artifact assemblages associated
with them consist of highly fragmentary items typical of late-nineteenth-to-mid-twentieth-century
domestic refuse. No clearly associated architectural features remain at any of these sites. Given
the limited information potential associated with the historic period components of sites
41VT155, 41VT156, 41VT157, 41VT158, 41VT159, 41VT160, 41VT161, 41VT162, 41VT163,
41VT164, 41VT166, and 41VT167, it is unlikely that they will provide any additional
information relevant to understanding community and regional development in Victoria County
or the Lower Guadalupe River valley during the late nineteenth through early twentieth centuries.
Thus, the historic period components of these sites are recommended to be not eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as an SAL, under criteria enumerated in 36 CFR 60.4
and 13 TAC 26.8, respectively.
Prehistoric site 41VT165 and the prehistoric components of sites 41VT156, 41VT158, 41VT166,
and 41VT167 all lack assemblages of temporally diagnostic artifacts, isolable components, and
intact stratigraphy and cultural features, or have sufficient data to contribute important
information regarding prehistoric technology, settlement-subsistence patterns, or extra-regional
interaction. Thus, the prehistoric components of these sites are recommended to be not eligible
for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as an SAL, under criteria enumerated in 36 CFR
60.4 and 13 TAC 26.8, respectively. No further investigations are recommended within the
proposed project area at these sites.
Due to the vertical extent of archeological deposits at site 41VT98, the portion of the site within
the proposed Industrial Park South APE was not completely evaluated. Based on the results of
extensive excavations in other portions of the site, as well as the similarities to nearby site
41VT94, site avoidance is recommended. In the event that site 41VT98 cannot be avoided by
ground-disturbing activities, it is recommended that deep testing be conducted to thoroughly
evaluate the potential for deeply buried, significant archeological deposits at the site prior to
ground-disturbing activities.
Due to the sensitive nature of historic period graves and human remains, it is recommended that
site 41VT168 be avoided by ground-disturbing activities.
All artifacts collected and records generated by this project will be curated at the Museum of the
Coastal Bend in Victoria, Texas, at the conclusion of the project.

diamond pattern, with a
slightly raised circle or oval

Unidentifiable fragments

Common nail; 8d; 6.3 cm

Artifact consists of a single
strand of wire bent at a 90°
angle next to a coil of wire;
athough this could be a piece
of barbed wire (cf. Glidden's
Coil, Hanging-barb OneStrand Variation (Cliffton
1970:30]) it looks much more
like the hammer and spring
from a traditional mouse trap
(Hooker 1894)
