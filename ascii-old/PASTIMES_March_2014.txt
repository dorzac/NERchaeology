The guest speaker at the PAS meeting on March 19 will be Todd Smith, a career law enforcement officer, who is currently the Chief Investigator for the District Attorney’s office in Lubbock. Approximately two years ago he and other investigators from this office,
other historians and volunteers began searching for the “Battle of Blanco Canyon”. Using skills developed in criminal cases, this team used research and boots on the ground
to locate and identify this battle site.

Shell Disk Beads from the Southern High Plains
By Scott D. Brosowske
Shell beads and ornaments are relatively common artifacts recovered at prehistoric sites of the Southern High Plains. Generally, these seem to occur primarily in post-Archaic (A.D. 400) contexts, although the
miniscule shell bead recovered at the Folsom age Shifting Sands site near Midland, Texas indicates that shell
working technologies have great antiquity in the region (Hofman et al. 2000). This brief article discusses an
uncommon bead type that has previously received little attention in the literature: the shell disk bead.
Recently, a small number of small, disk shaped shell beads were recovered during excavations at Eastview (41RB153), a small Antelope Creek phase residential site in Roberts County, Texas (see Brosowske 2013).
These beads were distributed throughout the northernmost house examined at the site. None of these beads
were associated with the living floor of the house, but occurred within the fill following house abandonment.
Table 1 provides metric measurements for 24 of the 29 shell disk beads recovered from the site.

Table 1 Metric Attributes of Shell Disk Beads from the Eastview Site
The shell disk beads from Eastview are generally circular in outline and flat in side view with slightly
rounded edges (Figure 1). The majority are fairly symmetrical in shape, although some have holes that are
drilled slightly off center, others are noticeably ovoid in outline, and others have uneven thicknesses. The average dimensions are 3.84 mm in diameter (Range 2.9 mm to 6.1 mm), 1.85 mm in thickness (Range 1.2 mm
to 2.7 mm), and the average hole diameter is 1.86 mm (Range 1.42 mm to 3.02 mm). The method used for
drilling the beads varied. Thirteen of the beads have slightly bi-conical shaped holes

Continued on page 4

indicating that they were drilled from both sides. The remaining beads have slightly tapered or straight holes
suggesting they were drilled from one side.

Figure 1 Shell Disk Beads from the Eastview Site
Just how common these bead types are in the region is difficult to access. Given their small size they
are unlikely to be recovered unless matrix is fine screened or unless they are encountered in large numbers
(Figure 2). It should be noted that these beads are much smaller than the “washer” shaped beads present as
early as the Early Ceramic period in the Central and Southern Plains. A few sites in the region where shell
disk beads have been documented include Stamper (Watson 1950:39), Two Sisters (Duncan 2002:165),
Landergin Mesa (Lintz 2014, personal communication), and a burial at Caprock Canyonlands State Park
(Lintz 2014, personal communication). Perhaps most impressive, an estimated total of just over 1700 shell
disk beads were documented from a bell-shaped pit at the Barnes site in southeastern Colorado (Lindsey
2005). It is generally concluded that these small disk beads were likely manufactured and obtained through
exchange with Puebloan groups (Brosowske 2005; Lindsey 2005; Lintz 2014, personal communication).

“Diggers” Petition

There is a growing movement among archaeologists, historians, and historic preservationists to push back against irresponsible and uncontrolled metal detecting on historic sites
which are conducted primarily to recover artifacts and sell them. The focus of the campaign
is to remove from cable television three separate but similar programs, including the National Geographic Channel’s “Diggers,” the Travel Channel’s “Dig Wars” and Spike TV’s
“American Diggers.” The consensus is that these programs promote looting and disrespect of
our national heritage.

A petition has been drafted and has over 1,100 signatures to date. Letters of support and
protest letters directed to the various programs and channels have been written by close to
one hundred local, state, regional, national, and international organizations.

If you wish to read the petition, learn more about the arguments, and see a list of supporting organizations, click on the link below. You can also go to the change.org website and enter “diggers” in the search box.
