ABSTRACT
In April and May 2014 Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants (DETAC)
conducted a cultural resource management survey of the proposed recreation trail, toilet
facility, and parking area in Emory, Texas. The total Area of Potential Effect is roughly
1.2 hectare (2.9 acre). The pedestrian survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities
Permit #6893 in compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas. The survey was
conducted with a combination of visual examination and shovel testing. Shovel testing
did not recover any cultural material; therefore, no artifacts were curated. The visual
examination documented site 41RA90 as two brick foundations and a cut stone roughly 5
meters (16 feet) away from the proposed trail route near Sandy Creek. The brick
manufacture and other features suggested a late nineteenth or early twentieth century
construction date. The cut stone was not identifiable as a mill stone. Deed research
found that the property has been in the same family since the turn of the century. A
review of maps and an interview with a family member of the previous owner did not
show any buildings in the area. A review of the local newspaper found an early owner of
the property had a mill but it is uncertain if it was on the same property. Shovel testing in
the area found disturbed soils from stream channel maintenance and a power line rightof-way. DETAC requests the foundations and stone be avoided by the proposed trail
construction. Construction fencing should be placed around the foundations and the
stone to avoid impacting the features. If trash, bones, dark stains, or other foundations or
stones are discovered during trail or bridge construction, than all work should stop and
DETAC contacted to evaluate the impact. Provided the foundations are avoided, DETAC
is requesting concurrence with the determination of “no effect” to State Archaeological
Landmarks or National Register of Historic Places eligible properties for the proposed
project.

INTRODUCTION
In April and May 2014, Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants (DETAC)
conducted a cultural resources survey of the proposed recreation trail and associated
facilities in Emory, Texas (Figure 1). The survey was conducted at the request of the
City of Emory in compliance with the Texas Parks and Wildlife (TPWD) Grant
Application for Texas Recreational Trails Fund. The project was reviewed by the Texas
Historical Commission (THC) under Section 106 and Texas Antiquities Permit #6893 in
compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) because
the money for the project is provided by the Federal Government and the Antiquities
Code of Texas because the funds are used by a subdivision of the State of Texas.
The purpose of this survey was to locate, describe and record any cultural
resources within the project area boundaries. No artifacts were found during the shovel
testing of the trail route; therefore, no artifacts were curated. The surface inspection
found two brick foundations and a cut stone (41RA90) near Sandy Creek. The use of
rebar and a style of brick suggest a turn of the century date for the foundations. The
foundations will not be disturbed by the proposed trail construction. Orange construction
fencing should be placed around the foundations and stone to ensure they are undisturbed
during construction.
The report was prepared following the short report format outlined by the Council
of Texas Archaeologist (CTA) (2005a) with modifications requested by the THC (Martin
1999). Based on fieldwork, DETAC recommends a determination of “no effect” to
National Register of Historic Places eligible or State Archaeological Landmarks cultural
resources for the proposed trail provided the foundations and the stone are not disturbed.

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The projects includes a 900 meter (m) (2,950-foot (ft)) gravel surface trail 2.4 m
(8 ft) wide, a building for a public toilet along the trail, and a 0.85 hectare (ha) (2.1 acre
(ac)) parking area south of North Street. Two bridges will be built to cross Sandy Creek.
Each bridge will be single construction metal structures with an open-bottom placed over
the existing stream channel with fill on the sides and top to provide a bed for the trail.
The parking area will be constructed by improving an existing overgrown gravel surface.

PREVIOUS RESEARCH AND CULTURAL HISTORY
Overall, Rains County was part of broad studies and investigated in both larger
examinations and numerous small surveys. The larger investigations in the area are
limited to those along Lake Fork Reservoir (e.g., Brusheth et al 1977) to the northeast
and Lake Tawakoni (e.g., Turpin and Caran 1997) to the south. The smaller surveys
were typically for road and water system improvements (e.g., Shelton and Davis 2009
and Galan 2010). These investigations found, tested, and conducted data recovery efforts
on a variety of historic and prehistoric sites. Most of the surveys mentioned above
focused on low lands and areas adjacent to perennial streams and well developed
floodplains. The numerous small surveys in the area include both upland and lowland
settings. The investigations that documented archaeological sites found that prehistoric
and early historic sites were found adjacent to stream channels in the floodplains on first
terraces or along the toe slopes of higher ridges.
In addition to the fieldwork referenced above, several documents have added
significantly to available information on the archaeological record in this region. The
documents of primary importance are D.A. Story and others (1990) and J.A. Guy's (1990)
discussions of the Gulf Coastal Plain. Additionally, the Texas Historical Commission,
Department of Antiquities Protection developed a document for the eastern Texas portion
of the Texas State Plan (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). This document includes several
historic contexts, each of which deals with a particular facet of northeast Texas
prehistory. This plan serves to synthesize the current state of archaeological research in
the region and identify problems and objectives to be addressed in future research and
cultural resources management. Several weak areas in archaeological knowledge of the
region are identified in these studies. Cultural chronology, aboriginal settlement patterns
and subsistence, and historic continuities are some of the general research directions that
these recent studies emphasize as important for developing future archaeological research
designs. More recently, Perttula (2004:370-407) describes the Caddoan archaeology of
northeast Texas which encompasses the area between the Red River in the north, the
Trinity River in the west, and Angelina River in the south.
The occupation of the area ranges from the Paleoindian (ca. pre-7000 B.C.) to
Archaic foraging cultures (ca. 7000-200 B.C.), Early Ceramic Period groups (ca. 200

3

B.C. - A.D. 800), the sedentary Caddoan occupation (A.D. 800 - 1680), and ends in the
historic Euro American settlement (Perttula and Kenmotsu 44:1993). The Paleo-Indian
period (ca. 10,000-7000 B.C.) is characterized by small, mobile bands of hunters and
gatherers that consumed a variety of native plants and animals (Story 1990). The Archaic
(7000-200 B.C.) refers to hunter-gatherers who implemented more regionally specialized
approaches toward exploiting their environment (Story 1990). The Early Ceramic (200
B.C.-A.D. 800) stage, also referred to as the Woodland period, represents an increasing
utilization of the environment by local groups to include a greater reliance on cultigens,
prolonged occupations at specific locales indicating an increasingly sedentary lifestyle,
and the emergence of social and ritual ceremonies (Story 1990). The prehistory of
northeast Texas in the Late Prehistoric period essentially concerns the Caddoan culture
(A.D. 800-1600). This culture is an indigenous development strongly influenced by the
Mississippian tradition of the Lower Mississippi Valley (Story 1990:323).

Larger

aggregates of people became sedentary and constructed villages with public ceremonial
areas.

Cemeteries are found in association with large ceremonial mounds (Perttula

2004:379). A stratified social structure developed, corresponding to the chiefdom level
as first defined by Service (1962, 1975). Extensive commercial networks were also
established. The Historic period (1680-present) describes both the history behind the
current cultural setting of the area and marks a transition from the native populations
domination of the area, to the American immigrants establishment of farms, towns, and
counties. The earliest American settlers in the area were James Hooker and William
Garrett. Hooker settled along the Sabine River in the 1840’s. The area was initially part
of Woods County. Senator Emory Rains of Woods County help survey the area that
became Rains County in 1869 (Schrimsher 2010). Springville, renamed Emory, was
named the Rains County seat in 1870. Arrival of the railroad in 1873 expedited export of
cotton, corn, wheat and oats. Lignite mining and the manufacture of “Ginger” bricks
added to the economy near the turn of the century. The county continued to diversify
with the completion of Lake Tawakoni in 1960 and the addition of tourism to the
agricultural and mining industries (Davis 2010).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
The investigations were performed in compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA
and the Texas Antiquities Code following survey standards described by the Texas
Historic Commission (2014) and report guidelines set forth by the CTA (2005b). The
purpose of these investigations was to locate prehistoric and historic cultural resources
within the project area, delineate the vertical and horizontal extent of each site, and make
a preliminary evaluation of each site's integrity and potential for State Archaeological
Landmark (SAL) designation and/or National Register of Historic Properties (NRHP)
eligibility. All fieldwork and reporting comply with the ethics standards of the Texas
Archaeological Society and the Register of Professional Archaeologists.
Before initiating fieldwork, DETAC conducted a records and literature review
using the Texas Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2014) and resources at the East Texas
Research Center (ETRC) in the Library at Stephen F. Austin State University. The atlas
contains a current database with published and unpublished data regarding cultural resource
surveys, archaeological site location maps, and cultural resources records. In addition, these
records show State Archaeological Landmarks (SAL) and NRHP eligibility of previously
recorded sites. The records at the ETRC contain county early maps and records from Rains
County and the City of Emory.
DETAC conducted an intensive pedestrian survey of the project area relying on
shovel testing and visual examination to locate archaeological sites within the Area of
Potential Effect (APE). Shovel testing included excavating an area approximately 30
centimeters (cm) square in 10 cm (4 in) levels down to the clay substrate or 90 cm (35
in). According to the THC guidelines, the trail required a minimum of 16 shovel tests per
mile. Following these guidelines, the pedestrian survey included a surface inspection
focused on areas with exposed soil (e.g., erosional features and ant mounds) along with a
minimum of nine shovel tests. Shovel test locations were recorded with Ashtech GPS
units with sub-meter post-processing accuracy.
texture, and shovel test depth.

RESULTS
The literature search and records review of the Texas Archaeological Site Atlas
(2014) found one archaeological investigation within 1.6 kilometers (km) (1 mile (mi)) of
the project area. AJ Consulting conducted an archaeological survey for the City of
Emory wastewater pipeline roughly 0.9 miles south of the current project area; no
cultural resources were found during the investigations (Todd 2011). The next closest
surveys were conducted for FMHA (Miller 2005) and the Soil Conservation Service
(Baker 1982).
No archaeological sites are recorded within one mile of the current project area;
however, there are two historical markers and one National Register of Historic Places
site within the Emory City limits. Closest to the current project area is the Emory City
Cemetery (Marker 10861) which is the final resting place of Emory Rains. Rains served
as an Alaclade under Mexican Rule, as a counselor in Shelby County during the
Regulator-Moderator War, and as a State Senator during the Constitutional Convention.
The next closest markers are for Rains County settlers and the Amis House (marker
10854) built in 1910. James Amis built the house and was a business man of local
interest. The Rains County Courthouse is a NRHP listed property as an intact example of
the Classical Revival design from 1909 (THC 2014).
Relevant research at the ETRC was limited to a 1908 map of Emory (TSGS
2014).

The map uses symbols consistent with Sanborn Fire Insurance maps for

buildings, but the map is not labeled as an insurance map. Unfortunately, the map comes
no closer to the project area than Woods Street which is located two city block east of the
project area. There is record of a Sanborn Fire Insurance map from 1938 listed online
(Hunt and Woodruff 2014); but, a search online and at the ETRC could not produce a
map. Other records at the library include cemetery and marriage records, and newspaper
abstracts.
The project includes a crossing for Alexander Street from the Ruby McKeowan
park to the west, a 900 m (2,950 ft) loop around the perimeter of the property, a toilet
facility along the trail, and a 0.85 ha. (2.1 ac.) parking area south of North Street. The
trail will be a gravel surface. The two bridges will be single construction metal structures
with an open-bottom placed over the existing stream channel with fill on the sides and

top to provide a bed for the trail. Topographically, the trail will cross Sandy Creek in two
locations and utilize the adjacent upland slopes and ridge summits. The toilet facility and
parking area are on a ridge summit overlooking the stream along North Street.
Vegetation varied from pasture grasses south of Sandy Creek and along an existing
powerline right-of-way to wooded with mixed pine and hardwood trees with moderate to
dense understory of various bushes and shrubs.

Soils include Wooodtell (WtC) along

the upland ridge backslopes with Wolfpen (WoC) and Freestone (FrB) on the ridge
summits (NRCS 2014). Woodtell series soils include an a horizon of fine sandy loam
roughly 15 cm (6 in) deep over a Bt horizon of clay with slick-n-slide features below 30
cm (12 in). Wolfpen and Freestone series soils include A and E horizons 50 to 65 cm (20
to 27 in) deep over a sandy clay Bt horizon.
Shovel tests were excavated along the trail route with an emphasis on elevated
landforms overlooking the drainage channels. Fewer tests were excavated in disturbed
areas adjacent to modern road surfaces and the steeper, concave slope along the power
line right-of-way. A total of 19 tests were excavated along the 900 m length of the trail
(Figure 2 and Table 1). Shovel tests along the ridge summits were 20 cm (8 in) deep or
shallower in light brown sandy loam.

Shovel tests along the ridge shoulders were

between 30 and 50 cm (12 and 20 in) deep in brown sandy loam and sandy clay loam.
Shovel tests adjacent to the drainage channels were 60 to 90 cm (24 to 36 in) deep in
brown to grayish brown sandy loam and sandy clay loam. No artifacts were found in the
shovel testing effort.
Surface inspection of the trail found most of the surface was covered in pasture
grasses. The northeast corner of the trail was in a stand of mixed hardwood and pine
trees with a moderate to dense understory of various bushes and shrubs. Ground cover in
the wooded area was leaf litter and scattered patches of grass. The segments along the
powerline right-of-way and adjacent to North and Pierson streets in the southeastern
corner were highly disturbed. The area for the toilet facility was on a slope and the
proposed parking area was a gravel surface with grass growing throughout (Figure 3).

Brick Foundations Site (41RA90)
The visual inspection found two brick foundations and a cut stone on the south
side of the creek bank 15 m (50 ft) south of the western crossing (Figures 2, 3 and 4).
The first foundation (F-1) is 0.3 m (1 ft) high, 0.9 m (3 ft) wide, and 4.0 m (13 ft) long.
The second foundation (F-2) is 0.7 m (2.3 ft) high, 0.6 m (2 ft) wide, and 2.5 m (8.2 ft)
long. Both foundations were made of frogless brick using both soft-mud and dry pressed
techniques. Each foundation has two ½-inch smooth rebar protruding from the upper
surface. The cut stone is roughly 60 cm (24 in) across and 50 cm (20 in) high, roughly
cylindrical, but unlike a mill stone, there was no hole in the center for either an axel or
supply of grain and the visible surface was not cut with grooves like a mill stone.

Consultation with the THC suggested the foundations were from the late
nineteenth to early twentieth century based on the use of hand-pressed brick and the
condition of the mortar (Denton, personal communication 2014). The closest brick
manufacture was in Ginger, Texas by what was known at one time as the Fraser Brick
Company. Overall, the brick was manufactured in Ginger between 1880 and 1940’s
(Hazelwood 2010a). The Ginger-based company manufactured brick for the Emory
Courthouse which was constructed in 1884 after a fire destroyed the earlier wood
courthouse. The Fraser Brick Company used the “A MANO” brand (Gurcke 1987:200).
None of the brick observed was branded or of the same quality as that used in the
courthouse suggesting an earlier construction or a different manufacturer.
After the field work was complete, DETAC archaeologists visited the Emory
Public Library. The library had no early records from the city but did have a map title
“Plat of Town of Emory Rains County, Texas Proposed Waterworks” from 1938 which
shows the town streets and public buildings. The Waterworks map shows Pierson Street
east of and adjacent to the project area as well as Alexander Road west of and adjacent to
the project area.

There are no buildings visible along either street, but the Ruby

McKeowan Park is visible at the current location along Sandy Creek. There are no
buildings visible along Sandy Creek north of Quitman Street.
Historical research revealed the earliest remaining deed records show the
purchase of the property by G.W. and J.E Alexander in 1905 from the partition of
Marshal and Bettie Alexander. The property was passed down through three more
generations of the family to the landowner, Ed Holley, who sold the property to the city.
Mr. Holly stated he had no information on a building near the creek (Holley 2014
personal communication).

His family home was located on the adjacent uplands

overlooking the creek; it was torn down in the 1970’s. Another possible source of
information was the county newspaper, the Rains County Leader which began
publication in 1912. A review of the newspaper index found members of the Alexander
family mentioned in various places, but the one of particular interest was on 14
September 1917 G.W. Alexander stated “I now have my mill up in good shape and will
grind every Saturday” (Bay 1999:107). No other information was available to confirm or
deny that the observed foundations and stone were part of the Alexander mill.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The City of Emory, Texas will use Federal funds administered by the Texas
Wildlife Department to build a gravel trail, toilet facility, and parking area on unused
property.

The project was reviewed under Section 106 of the National Historic

Preservation Act and the Antiquities Code of Texas. The archaeological survey was
conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit #6893.
The purpose of this survey was to locate, describe and record any cultural
resources within the project area boundaries. No artifacts were found during the shovel
testing of the trail route; therefore, no artifacts were curated. The surface inspection
recorded two brick foundations and a cut stone near Sandy Creek as an archaeological
site (41RA90) 5 m (16 ft) away from the proposed trail route. The observed brick was
manufactured as early as the late nineteenth century based on the brick characteristics,
mortar, and use of rebar. A review of city maps from 1908 and 1938 did not reveal any
buildings in the area. Deed research revealed the property was in the same family for
five generations and an informal interview with a family member did not provide
additional information on the foundations. A mill is mentioned in the local newspaper by
a family member who owned the property in the early twentieth century, but the
reference was vague as to the location of the mill. Shovel testing near the site found
disturbed soils near the foundation from a power line right-of-way and stream channel
maintenance.
The foundations and nearby stone should be avoided by the proposed trail
construction. To ensure the site is avoided, orange fencing should be place around the
foundations and stone before construction and the area avoided by heavy equipment.
Based on the shovel test results and the visual examination, there is little chance
of encountering any additional undiscovered cultural resources in the project area;
however, in the event that human remains and/or archaeological materials are discovered
during construction, then the project activity will cease in the immediate area and
DETAC shall be notified of the discovery.

Provided the foundations are avoided,

DETAC requests concurrence with a determination of “no effect” to properties listed or
eligible for the NRHP as defined by the National Historic Preservation Act and SAL as
defined by the Antiquities Code of Texas.
