Abstract
On July 10 and 11, 2017, archeologists from aci consulting conducted a pedestrian
survey and backhoe trenching prior to construction of an approximately 2,207linear-foot (672-linear-meters), 18-22-foot-wide (5.4-6.7 meters-wide) sidewalk,
which includes a pedestrian bridge over Cottonwood Creek, from FM 1660 to
Cottonwood Creek Elementary in Williamson County, Texas. The Area of
Potential Effect (APE) for the intensive pedestrian survey is the Right-of-Way
(ROW) for the proposed sidewalk, which varies in width, but is approximately
1.07 acres (0.43 hectares).
The 1.07-acre (0.43-hectare) survey was conducted in accordance with Council of
Texas Archeologists (CTA) and Texas Historical Commission (THC) and in
compliance with Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26) under Permit No. 8056.
The project is funded through the City of Hutto, thus the project is also conducted
in compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966,
as amended, for any additional compliance for impacts to US Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE) regulated waters.
The investigation did not result in the location of any new archeological sites,
historic structures, or additional historic properties. Based on these results, no
further archeological work is recommended. Records from this investigation will
be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory. Julie Shipp served as
Principal Investigator.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
The City of Hutto is proposing the construction of an approximately 2,207-linearfoot (672-linear-meters), 18-22-foot-wide (5.4-6.7 meters-wide) sidewalk from FM
1660 to Cottonwood Creek Elementary in Williamson County, Texas. The project
includes a pedestrian bridge over Cottonwood Creek. The Area of Potential
Effect (APE) for the intensive pedestrian survey is the Right-of-Way (ROW) for
the proposed sidewalk, which varies in width, but is approximately 1.07 acres
(0.43 hectares) (Figures 1 and 2). In addition, two backhoe trenches will be
excavated within the 300-foot area along Cottonwood Creek where Tinn soils are
mapped.
The 1.07-acre (0.43-hectare) survey was conducted in accordance with Council of
Texas Archeologists (CTA) and Texas Historical Commission (THC) and in
compliance with Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26) under Permit No. 8056.
The project is funded through the City of Hutto, thus the project is also
conducted in compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation
Act of 1966, as amended, for any additional compliance for impacts to US Army
Corps of Engineers (USACE) regulated waters. The investigation will consist of
an intensive pedestrian survey, shovel testing, backhoe trenching, site recording,
assessment of sites for listing on the national Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
or for designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL), data analysis, and
reporting in accordance with THC and Council of Texas Archaeologists (CTA)
standards.

2.0 BACKGROUND INFORMATION
2.1 Environmental Setting
The project area is located in central Texas along the eastern edge of the Edwards
Plateau in the Balcones Canyonlands. The Balcones Canyonlands are
approximately 1000 feet higher in elevation than the Gulf Coastal Plain to the
east. Erosion along the edge of the Edwards Plateau has resulted in steep, stairstep topography characterized by canyons, sinkholes, and karsts. The Balcones
Canyonlands are relatively well watered in comparison to the larger Edwards
Plateau and the Blackland Prairie to the east (Wermund 1995).
2.2 Geology and Soils
The APE is underlain by Fluviatile terrace deposits and the Navarro Group
(USGS 2017). There are four main soil series present with the project area:
Branyon clay, Altoga silty clay loam, Houston Black clay, and Tinn clay (NRCS
2017) (Figure 3). They are all described as calcareous, moderately alkaline, and
eroded or prone to erosion (Werchan and Coker 1983). The Altoga, Branyon, and
Tinn are alluvial soils, and the Houston Black is an upland soil derived in situ
from calcareous mudstone. The majority of the soils within the project area have
been previously determined to have a low probability to contain archeological
sites according to the Potential Archeological Liability Maps (PALM) model
created by TxDOT ENV for highway projects in the Austin District (Figure 4).
However, the Tinn series, which is mapped along Cottonwood Creek, has a
moderate to high probability to contain archeological sites (Abbott 2013).

3.0 REGIONAL HISTORY AND CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY
3.1 Prehistoric Background
The project area falls within the Central Texas archeological region (Collins
1995). Prehistoric archeological sites in Central Texas represent continuous
human occupation starting around 11,500 years ago. Michael B. Collins (1995)
authored a synthesis of Central Texas archeology in which he divides the
prehistory of Central Texas into three periods: (1) the Paleoindian, (2) the
Archaic, and (3) the Late Prehistoric. Each of these is further divided into
subperiods, such as early and late. Dates are presented as Before Present or BP in
Table 1.

4,000-1,200 BP
1,200-500 BP
500 BP +

The Paleoindian period dates between approximately 11,500 and 8,800 BP
(Collins 1995:381-3). The Early Paleoindian in Central Texas is part of a larger,
regional cultural horizon, the Clovis horizon. Clovis sites record a general
hunter-gatherer lifeway based upon a wide variety of fauna including large
herbivores as well as smaller animals. Evidence of plant resources is less
common, but it is presumed that local flora was also important to subsistence. In
contrast, later Folsom sites indicate a greater reliance upon big game hunting.
The Late Paleoindian seems transitional between the Paleoindian and Archaic in
that burned rock features are present, but they are not as large or ubiquitous as
those associated with the Archaic. Other artifacts, features, and faunal remains
seem more similar to those found later in the Archaic.
Archaic (Collins 1995:383-385) sites in Central Texas are most often associated
with the use of heated rock in hearths, ovens, middens, and scatters. The period
as a whole is defined by the intensified use of local resources and diversity of

material culture in comparison to the Paleoindian period. The climate ranged
from mesic (relatively moist) in the Early Archaic and the later part of the Late
Archaic to xeric (relatively dry) during the Middle Archaic and beginning of the
Late Archaic. Subsistence during mesic times is centered on the live-oak savanna,
while a shift in emphasis toward xerophytes may have occurred during xeric
intervals.
The Late Prehistoric saw the migration of several new linguistic groups,
primarily from the Great Plains, into the region. The introduction of ceramics
into the archeological record takes place in the region during this time as well.
The movement of Europeans inland from the coast and north from Mexico ended
the prehistoric era.
3.2 Historic Background
Historic exploration and settlement of the Williamson County area began in the
late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries when Spanish explorers traveled
through the region searching for better routes to the missions in East Texas.
Captain Alonso De León followed the Camino Real from San Antonio to Bastrop
several times during the 1680s, and, at least once, he traveled on the Camino de
Arriba, which crossed Brushy Creek and the San Gabriel River. In 1716, Louis
Juchereau de St. Denis, a French explorer, and Captain Domingo Ramon, a
Spanish explorer, led an expedition through the area and camped on the banks of
Brushy Creek and the San Gabriel River. They named them Arroyo do las
Bendítas Ánimas and Rio de San Xavier, respectively. In 1721, the Marques de
Aguayo led a large group of soldiers, livestock, and provisions through presentday Williamson County to replenish supplies at the eastern missions. In the mideighteenth century, the San Xavier missions were established along the San
Gabriel River, just east of the Williamson/Milam County line. By 1753 drought
and disease made the missions uninhabitable, and Spanish influence in the area
declined (Odintz 2002).
Anglo-American influence in the area began with a series of land grants from the
Mexican government in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. In
1835 continual attacks by local Indians prompted Captain John J. Tumlinson and
his company of Texas Rangers to construct a fort and Indian lookout near the
headwaters of Brushy Creek in southwestern Williamson County. Tumlinson

Fort, as it was called, was abandoned in 1836 when General Santa Ana invaded
Texas (Odintz 2002).
Following the defeat of General Santa Ana at the Battle of San Jacinto, several
veterans of the battle settled in Williamson County. In 1838 Dr. Thomas Kenney
and his family built a fort on Brushy Creek, in what is now eastern Williamson
County. Kenney’s Fort became the first civilian settlement in Williamson County.
However, Indian attacks were a frequent problem, and numerous settlers,
including Kenney, were killed by Indians. By 1846 the Indian threat had waned
and settlement in the region increased. In 1848 the Texas legislature established
Williamson County, naming it after Robert Williamson, a Milam County Judge
and state senator (Odintz 2002).
By 1850, the county had a population of 1,379 whites and 155 slaves. Most of the
population was located in the eastern part of the county on Brushy Creek and the
San Gabriel (Odintz 2002), but a few families were living in the western half.
During the 1850s and 1860s, towns, lumber mills, and tanneries sprang up
around the county. Although urbanization and industrialization increased
somewhat, the bulk of the county remained rural and agricultural. The majority
of the families lived on subsistence farms in log houses and raised corn. During
the 1850s and early 1860s, the slave population increased and the agricultural
patterns within the county became more diverse. Wheat and corn were the
predominant crops in the Blackland prairies, and cattle and sheep ranching was
widespread throughout the county. Cotton was introduced in the 1850s, but it
was not a significant cash crop (Odintz 2002).
The economy of Williamson County slumped during the Civil War but picked
up again in the 1870s with the growth of the cattle and sheep industry and the
expansion of cotton farming. The cattle industry was sustained by the Chisholm
trail, which was established in 1864 and passed close to Round Rock. Many cattle
drives passed through or originated in Williamson County. The 1870s and 1880s
were also marked by the arrival of railroads to Williamson County (Odintz 2002).
By the early twentieth century, cotton farming had surpassed the cattle industry
in importance. With the dramatic growth in cotton farming, a shift in farm
tenancy developed. As late as 1880, 77 percent of the farms were still worked by
Limmer Loop Sidewalk Project

austin • denver

owners. By 1890 43 percent of the farms were worked by owners, and by 1930
only 29 percent of the farms were worked by owners. The tenancy rates
continued to drop during the Great Depression (Odintz 2002).
The cotton industry suffered economically during the 1920s from the effects of
soil depletion, falling prices brought on by overproduction, and the boll weevil
infestation. The Great Depression of the 1930s worsened the economic situation
and encouraged farmers to shift away from cotton to livestock. Cotton
production was reduced by nearly half, while sorghum and wheat became
important crops. Along with cattle and sheep, poultry farming intensified
(Odintz 2002).
Significant population and economic changes occurred in the 1960s, 1970s, and
1980s. The construction and expansion of roads throughout the undeveloped
areas of Williamson County meant urban populations now had easier access to
the Hill Country and vice versa. The consolidation of rural schools also meant
children could now attend schools outside of their rural communities. For
example, during the 1910s and 1920s, Rock House School was one of the largest
schools in Williamson County. In 1903, the school boasted a population of 96
students and 2 teachers. The school was consolidated with Liberty Hill School in
1947, and by the 1990s, Rock House had become a dispersed agricultural
community (Odinzt 2002).
Suburbanization of the portions of the county bordering Austin caused the
population of Williamson County to boom in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1970, the
population of Williamson County was 37,305. By 1982, the population had grown
to over 85,700. A pattern of absentee ownership and of non-agricultural use of
the land also intensified following World War II. Austin, Georgetown, and
Liberty Hill grew rapidly (Odintz 2002).
4.0 LITERATURE REVIEW
No portion of the Limmer Loop project area has been previously surveyed, and
no sites have been previously recorded within the area (Atlas 2017) (Figure 5).
There are two previously recorded sites within one kilometer (0.6 mile) of the
project area, both of which were located during a 2008-2009 survey for a

5.0 FIELD METHOD
An intensive pedestrian survey was conducted within the entire 1.07-acre (0.43hectacre) APE. This investigation included the excavation of two backhoe
trenches in the 300-foot stretch of the project area where Tinn soils are mapped.
Field forms included a daily journal and photograph log.
The western portion of the 300-foot area along Cottonwood Creek has been
channelized and inundated. The two backhoe trenches were then excavated on
the east side of the creek within the ROW and where Tinn soils are mapped. The
trenches were approximately 20 feet (6 meters) long, 5 feet (1.5 meters) wide, and
5 feet (1.5 meters) deep. The trench walls were examined for the presence of
cultural material, and a 1-meter- (3-foot-) wide section of a wall for both trenches
were profiled in detail. Each trench was photographed and the location recorded
on a GPS device.
6.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATION
The survey and backhoe trenching were conducted under pleasant conditions in
the morning, under a clear sky, with a light breeze. The survey began on the west
end of the APE as it runs along Limmer Loop. The proposed limits of the
sidewalk are within the existing ROW which is previously disturbed from road
and utility construction (Figures 6 and 7). Furthermore, the ground surface
visibility was good, approximately 50 percent. Thus, no subsurface testing was
conducted outside of the flood plain of Cottonwood Creek.
The Tinn soil series is mapped in an approximately 300-foot section of the project
area that crosses Cottonwood Creek (see Figure 3). While Tinn soils have a
moderate-high potential to contain archeological sites, the western half of this
section is within the channelized, inundated portion of Cottonwood Creek. Two
backhoe trenches (BHTs) were therefor excavated within the remainder of the
Tinn soil, between the culverts at the creek and FM 1660 to the east (Figure 8).
The two trenches were placed between the City of Hutto water line and the ROW
fence line.

7.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On July 10 and 11, 2017, archeologists from aci consulting conducted a
pedestrian survey and backhoe trenching prior to construction of an
approximately 2,207-linear-foot (672-linear-meters), 18-22-foot-wide (5.4-6.7
meters-wide) sidewalk, which includes a pedestrian bridge over Cottonwood
Creek, from FM 1660 to Cottonwood Creek Elementary in Williamson County,
Texas. The Area of Potential Effect (APE) for the intensive pedestrian survey was
the Right-of-Way (ROW) for the proposed sidewalk, which varies in width, but is
approximately 1.07 acres (0.43 hectares).
The investigation consisted of a pedestrian survey and the excavation of two
backhoe trenches on the east bank of Cottonwood Creek. The investigation did
not result in the location of any new archeological sites, historic structures, or
historic properties. Based on these results, no further archeological work is
recommended. It should be noted that no level of survey intensity can be
guaranteed to locate all cultural features within a project area. Therefore, should
previously-unrecorded cultural resources including human remains be
discovered during the course of construction for this project, the City of Hutto or
Binkley Barfield will contact the Texas Historical Commission or other
