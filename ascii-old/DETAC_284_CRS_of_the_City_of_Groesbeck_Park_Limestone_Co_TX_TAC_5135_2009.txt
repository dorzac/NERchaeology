ABSTRACT
In February 2009 Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultant (DETAC) conducted a
cultural resource management survey of a proposed sports park for the City of Groesbeck
in Limestone County, Texas. Texas Antiquities Permit #5135 was obtained and all terms
of the permit were carried out. The proposed park includes roughly 22 ha. (54 ac.) along
the northwestern portion of the city. A visual examination and shovel testing found no
historic or prehistoric cultural resources with the project area boundaries. The absence of
cultural resources was attributed to the upland setting and distant from any reliable
sources of surface water. No artifacts were collected and no further investigations are
recommended. DETAC is requesting concurrence with the determination of “no effect”
on NRHP eligible properties for the proposed project area.

INTRODUCTION
On 5 February 2009 Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultant (DETAC)
conducted a cultural resource management survey of a proposed city park for the City of
Groesbeck, Texas in Limestone County. Texas Antiquities Permit #5135 was obtained
and all terms of the permit were carried out. The report was reviewed by the Texas
Historical Commission.
The proposed project focused on developing a pasture owned by the city into a
sports park with baseball fields, a walking trail around the perimeter, a parking lot, and a
field house in the center of the complex with plumbing and electricity. The purpose of
this survey was to locate, describe and record any cultural resources within the project
area boundaries. The report was prepared following the short report format outlined by
the Council of Texas Archaeologist (CTA) (1995a) with modifications requested by the
THC (Martin 1999).

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The project area included approximately 22 hectares (54 acres) on the northeast
corner of Groesbeck, Texas between F.M. 1245 and Hwy 164 (Figure 1). The project
plans included leveling the area for the baseball fields and parking lot along with shallow
grading of the trail route to build the trail. Currently, the area was in half in pasture and
half in mesquite trees on the slope of an upland ridge overlooking the headwaters of an
unnamed stream to the south and west of the property. Project area boundaries were
delineated by fence lines.

PREVIOUS RESEARCH AND CULTURAL HISTORY
Overall, Limestone County has been studied in numerous small surveys and larger
investigations. The small surveys have focused on oil and gas exploration, farm to
market roads by TxDOT, and rural development throughout the county by FHWA and
the TWDB, e.g., Davis (1998). Of these small surveys, the ones crossing lowland areas
have recorded more sites than the upland surveys. The larger investigations have focused
on the Jewitt Mine land and various electric transmission and pipeline right-of-ways, e.g.,
Watkins and Sherman (2008).

Large area surveys have found both prehistoric and

historic resources adjacent to the floodplains on first terraces or along the toe slopes of
higher ridges. A majority of these resources are prehistoric open campsites near year
round water and on sandy knolls, tow slopes, or ridges.
The occupation of Limestone County ranges from the Paleoindian (ca. prior to
6000 B.C.) to Archaic foraging cultures (6000-700 B.C.), Late Prehistoric (700 B.C –
A.D. 1700), and Historic (A.D. 1700 – present) (Kenmotsu and Pettula (1993). These
stages were based on changes in environment, technology, and/or population requiring
cultural adaptations to meet varying circumstances.

The Paleo-Indian period is the

earliest generally accepted cultural period in the New World and included populations
that inhabited North America from the Late Pleistocene to the early Holocene. These
populations are characterized by small, mobile bands of hunters and gatherers that
consumed a variety of plants and animals (Story 1990). The Archaic refers to huntergatherers who implemented more regionally specialized approaches toward exploiting
their environment (Story 1990). The Archaic was further divided into Early, Middle, and
Late divisions (Prikryl 1990) with specialized tools that changed form between the
periods with increasing population.

The Late Prehistoric in the region showed the

gradual adaptation of the bow and arrow, horticulture/agriculture, and the spread of
ceramics. Projectile points found in the region suggested an emphasis on buffalo hunting
(Prikryl 1990). The Historic period (1680-present) describes both the history behind the
current cultural setting of the area and marks a transition from the native populations
domination of the area to the European immigrants establishment of farms, towns, and
counties. The region saw Spanish exploration and American Colonization in the early
19th century followed by a change to farming and ranching in the early 20th century and
the addition of industry in the later part of the 20th century (THA 2009).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
The investigations were preformed in compliance with the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966 (PL89-665), as amended in 1974, 1976, 1980, and 1992; the
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL91-190, 83 Stat. 915, 42 USC 4231,
1970), the guidelines set forth by the CTA (1995b), and the Register of Professional
Archaeologists.
The program of site evaluation was conducted in accordance with the National
Park Service criteria (36 CFR, part 60.4) which present the guidelines for determining
eligibility of a cultural resource for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP). The objectives of the survey were to locate prehistoric and historic cultural
resources sites within the survey areas. If sites were found, then the investigations were
to delineate the vertical and horizontal extent of each site, determine each site’s integrity,
and provide a preliminary evaluation of each site’s potential for NRHP eligibility.
Before initiating fieldwork, DETAC conducted a records and literature review
using maps and files listed on the Texas Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2009). The Site
Atlas was consulted for published and unpublished data regarding cultural resource surveys
as well as State Archaeological Landmarks (SAL) and NRHP sites within or in close
proximity to the project area.
DETAC conducted a 100 percent pedestrian survey of the area. To locate sites, the
pedestrian survey relied on visual examination and shovel testing. Visual examinations
were conducted in areas with exposed soil surfaces in a continuous effort between shovel
tests at all locations with exposed surfaces. Shovel testing was conducted in accordance
with the Texas Historic Commission’s guidelines for cultural resources surveys.
According to these guidelines, project areas between 4.0 and 40.5 hectares (11 and 100
acres) require a minimum of 1 shovel test per 0.8 ha (2 acres); therefore, a total of 12
shovel tests were required for the 23 ha (57 ac) area. Shovel testing included excavating an
area approximately 30 cm (12 inches) in diameter in 10 cm (4 inch) levels down to the
clay substrate or 90 cm (35 inches). The excavated matrix was screened through a 0.635
cm (0.25 inch) wire mesh screen. The depth, soil type, and color of each shovel test was
recorded along with a GPS position with 3 to 5 meter accuracy.

RESULTS
The previous investigation research found one previously recorded cultural
resources within a mile of the proposed park and three previous surveys around the city of
Groesbeck. The closest documented archaeological site is 41LN94 approximately 540 m
(1770 ft) southwest of the project area. Site 41LN94 was documented as a prehistoric site
with lithic debitage and both human and non-human bone (Bryan 1930). The next closest
previously recorded site is 41LT93 roughly 2.1 km (1.3 miles) to the northwest of the
project area and was recorded without an artifact collection. Both sites overlook Frost
Creek and are on similar topographic features as the project area. The closest documented
archaeological surveys were conducted for TxDot in 1982 and 1984. The 1982 survey was
along F.M. 1245 roughly 50 m (164 ft) north of the project area while the 1984 survey was
conducted within the city. Neither survey documented any cultural resources.
Soils in the project area were described as Ellis clay, eroded, on the north and east
(upslope) portions of the project area and Heiden clay and Wilson clay loam on the west
and southern portions (down slope) of the project area. Ellis and Heiden clay consist of
clay in excess of 100 cm (40 inches) deep while Wilson clay loam consists of 20 cm (7
inches) of clay loam over clay (NRCS 2009).
Overall, the area slopes toward the southwest into unnamed drainages (Figure 2).
The pedestrian survey found that the area consisted of three low ridges separated by low
draws that fed the defined drainage channel. A power line right-of-way delineates the
southwest boundary and crosses the northwest corner of the property. The northwest,
northeast, and eastern boundaries were defined by a fence line shared with private
residential homes. Vegetation was exclusively pasture grasses over the northern half and
mesquite trees with shin-high grass over the southern half. A total of 64 shovel test were
excavated across the project area with more shovel tests along the ridge crests
overlooking the draws. Shovel testing found soil conditions similar to the soil survey
with brown to dark brown clay and clay loam 10 to 30 cm (4 to 12 inches) deep over
clay. The deepest tests were clustered on an isolated spot near the southern boundary.
No cultural material was observed in the shovel testing or during the surface inspection of
ant and burrowing animal mounds. Shovel test results are described in Table 1.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The proposed city park will utilize a pasture and stand of mesquite trees for
baseball fields, a walking trail, a parking lot, and a field house. The area has relatively
uniform clay and clay loam soils as described by the NRCS and as discovered in the
shovel testing.

Surface inspection and shovel testing found no evidence of either

prehistoric or historic period occupation.
In conclusion, the investigations did not document any cultural resources. Based
on the investigations, there is little chance of encountering cultural resources in the
project areas. DETAC is requesting a concurrence with the determination of “no effect”
on NRHP eligible properties for the proposed project area.
