ABSTRACT

Centerpoint Energy Gas Transmission Company (CEGT) is proposing to construct a
new 16-inch intrastate natural gas steel pipeline that extends northwest to southeast
approximately 17.77 kilometers (11.04 miles) from just south Marshall to south of Elysian
Fields in Harrison and Panola counties, Texas. The pipeline project is referred to as the Line
CP-3 (Penn-Virginia) pipeline project. The project is generally designed to follow and parallel
existing pipelines and transmission lines. The project will include the use of 11 existing access
roads, the installation of several measurement facilities and extra temporary workspaces, as well
as a pig launcher and receiver.
HRA Gray & Pape, LLC (HRA Gray & Pape), was contracted by Gulf Engineers &
Consultants, Inc. (GEC, Inc.) to conduct a cultural resources survey of the proposed pipeline
route. The Area of Potential Effect (APE) is defined as the 60-meter (200-foot) wide study
corridor, which includes a 23-meter (75-foot) wide temporary construction right-of-way, extra
temporary workspaces, and a 15.25-meter (50-foot) permanent easement. Project attributes
located outside of the study corridor that were also surveyed include 11 existing access roads
and two facilities located at either end of the pipeline route. Fieldwork was conducted between
August and November of 2007.
The lead federal agency for this project has been identified as the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC). This work was conducted to satisfy requirements set forth by
the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). All work was conducted following accepted
standards set forth by the Texas Historical Commission (THC) and the Council of Texas
Archeologists (CTA). The project is located entirely on privately owned properties. Therefore,
it did not require a Texas Antiquities Permit.
This report presents the results of an intensive pedestrian cultural resources survey of
17.77 kilometers (11.04 miles) of the proposed 17.77 kilometers (11.04 miles) Line CP-3
(Penn-Virginia) pipeline route. The total area surveyed for this project is approximately
139.84 hectares (345.55 acres) including the entire proposed route and facilities, portions of
an abandoned pipeline route, and all 11 access roads. As a result of archaeological
investigations conducted for this project, no new cultural resources were recorded.
Based on the lack of cultural resources located within the 60-meter (200-foot) wide
study corridor along the proposed pipeline route, HRA Gray & Pape recommends no further
work and that the proposed project be allowed to proceed as planned.

CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTION

Between August and November of 2007, HRA Gray & Pape, LLC (HRA Gray &
Pape), of Houston, Texas, at the request of Gulf Engineers & Consultants, Inc. (GEC, Inc.)
under contract with Centerpoint Energy Gas Transmission Company (CEGT), conducted an
intensive pedestrian archaeological investigation of approximately 139.84 hectares (345.55
acres) of property associated with the proposed Line CP-3 (Penn-Virginia) pipeline project in
Harrison and Panola counties, Texas.
The lead federal agency for this project has been identified as the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC).
CEGT is proposing to construct a new 16-inch intrastate natural gas steel pipeline that
extends northwest to southeast approximately from just south Marshall to south of Elysian
Fields in Harrison and Panola counties, Texas. The project is generally designed to follow and
parallel existing pipelines and transmission lines. The project will include the use of 11 existing
unpaved access roads, temporary workspaces, and extra temporary workspaces at all road and
water body crossings, and the installation of two facilities including a pig launcher and metering
station.
This work was conducted to fulfill the requirements set forth in the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (NHPA). The goals of the cultural resources survey
were to determine if land altering activities required to complete this project would affect any
previously identified historic properties as defined by Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended (36 CFR 800) and to establish whether or not
previously unidentified cultural resources were located within the project’s Area of Potential
Effect (APE) (Advisory Council on Historic Preservation [ACHP] 1999). Fieldwork and
reporting activities were conducted following accepted standards set forth by the Texas
Historical Commission (THC) and the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA). The project is
located entirely on privately owned properties. Therefore, it did not require a Texas
Antiquities Permit.

PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION
The project area is located on the De Berry, Grand Bluff, Stricklin Springs, and
Colliers Creek United States Geologic Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle
maps in Harrison and Panola counties, Texas (Figure 1). The Line CP-3 (Penn-Virginia)
pipeline route is approximately 17.77 kilometers (11.04 miles) and is generally oriented
northwest to southeast and is designed to follow and parallel existing pipeline routes and
existing utility transmission corridors. The environment consists primarily of upland
timberland and pasture. The proposed route crosses four perennial streams. These include
Quapaw Creek, Caddo Creek, Caney Creek, and Jackson Creek, as well some of their
drainageways.

The archaeological APE consists of a 60-meter (200-foot) wide study corridor, which
includes a 15.25-meter (50 foot) wide permanent easement, a 23-meter (75-foot) wide
temporary construction right-of- way (ROW), and temporary workspaces. Project attributes
located outside of the study corridor, but also included in the APE, include the use of 11
existing access roads and two facilities located at either end of the pipeline route.
According to information provided by CEGT, no belowground disturbances or
changes to the existing roads are anticipated during pipeline construction within the
boundaries of the 11 existing access roads that are proposed for use. CEGT has indicated
that these roads will not be widened or altered during pipeline construction. If project plans
change and indicate that modifications to these roads, such as widening or the construction of
turnarounds are required during pipeline construction, then additional surveys will be
required prior to conducting such changes.
It is unlikely that historic resources will be affected by below ground pipeline
construction, but above ground markers and other pipeline infrastructure can result in
viewshed-related concerns. Therefore, the APE for above ground resources included
properties immediately adjacent to the archaeological APE.

CHAPTER II. GEOMORPHOLOGY AND SOILS

The project area lies within the Texas Coastal Plain, which is part of the larger Gulf
Coastal Plain. The coastal plain is characterized by a low topographic relief and extends
from Florida to Mexico. The Texas Coastal Plain reaches as far north as the Ouachita uplift
in Oklahoma, and as far west as the Balcones escarpment in central Texas. The basic
geomorphological characteristics of the Texas coast and associated inland areas, which
includes Harrison and Panola counties, resulted from depositional conditions influenced by
the combined action of sea level changes from glacial advance in the northern portions of the
continent, and subsequent downcutting and variations in the sediment load capacity of the
region’s rivers. Harrison and Panola counties are underlain by relatively recent sedimentary
rocks and unconsolidated sediments ranging in age from the Eocene to Holocene (Dolezel
1975; Golden et al. 1994).

SOILS
A review of Harrison and Panola County soil surveys indicates that the proposed
pipeline route crosses eight soil units. Panola County contains two of these types and
Harrison County contains the other six types. The soils found in Panola and Harrison
counties that are located within the pipeline study corridor are of Eocene, Pleistocene, and
Holocene age.
The soil types in Panola County are Bowie fine sandy loam and Cart-Erno complex.
The Bowie soils are gently sloping soils that are located on uplands. They are moderately
slowly permeable and well drained (Dolezel 1975). The first layer is a dark grayish brown
fine sandy loam followed by a pale brown fine sandy loam. The next layer is a yellowishbrown sandy clay loam mottled with brown, yellow, and red. The final layer is a sandy clay
loam mottled with yellow, brown, red, and gray. The Cart-Erno complex is nearly level and
is located on wide terraces near creeks and rivers. It is a moderately slowly permeable soil
that is well drained (Dolezel 1975). The soil ranges from a brown fine sandy loam in the
upper strata to a red and yellowish-brown sandy clay loam in the lowest stratum with
yellowish-brown and strong brown sandy clay loam in the middle strata.
The soil types in Harrison County are Scottsville very fine sandy loam, Bernaldo fine
sandy loam, Bonn-Cart complex, Eastwood very fine sandy loam, Iuka fine sandy loam, and
Socagee silty clay loam (Golden et al. 1994). Scottsville soils are of Eocene age. These soils
are located in the uplands and are very slow in permeability and are very well drained. It
ranges from a dark brown and yellowish brown very fine sandy loam in the upper strata to
light gray clay in the lowest stratum with the middle strata including yellowish brown loam
and clay loam. The project area contains mostly Scottsville soils.

The Bernaldo fine sandy loam is a gently sloping soil located mainly on stream
terraces. It is moderately permeable and well drained. It is primarily loam with colors
ranging from brown to strong brown and yellowish-brown to brownish-yellow (Golden et al.
1994).
The Bonn-Cart complex is located on mounded stream terraces that are nearly level
near creeks and bayous. It has slow to very slow permeability and is poorly drained (the Cart
soils are well drained). The surface ranges from a dark brown silty loam to a dark grayish
brown very fine sandy loam. The subsurface ranges from a grayish brown silty loam to a
light yellowish brown very fine sandy loam. The subsoil ranges from a gray loam with a
mottling of dark yellowish brown to a brownish yellow very fine sandy loam that has strong
brown mottling. A second layer ranging from a grayish brown clay loam to yellowish brown
brittle very fine sandy loam is next. The lowest layer ranges from a light gray stratified silty
clay loam to a brownish yellow sandy clay loam with yellow and brown mottling (Golden et
al. 1994).
Eastwood soils are of Eocene age. Eastwood fine sandy loam is a moderately sloping
soil on upland slope sides and has very slow permeability and is moderately well drained.
The surface is a grayish brown very fine sandy loam with a subsoil ranging from red clay
with light gray mottling to light gray clay loam with brownish yellow, strong brown, and
reddish yellow mottling. The substratum consists of light yellowish brown silt loam and
light gray siltstone with brownish yellow and strong brown mottling (Golden et al. 1994).
Iuka fine sandy loam is nearly level and is located on flood plains. It is moderately
permeable and drains moderately well. The surface is a dark grayish brown fine sandy loam
mottled with a dark yellowish brown fine sandy loam. The subsoil ranges from fine sandy
loam to a silty loam and colors range from strong brown to brownish yellow to gray with
yellowish red and light gray mottling. The substratum is pale brown, dark yellowish brown,
light brownish gray and dark brown mottled loamy fine sand with underlying light gray and
light brown loamy sand (Golden et al. 1994).
The Socagee soils are of Holocene age and are made up of recent Holocene alluvial
deposits. Socagee silty clay loam is nearly level located on flood plains near large streams.
It has moderately slow permeability and drains poorly. The surface is a gray silty clay loam
with mottling of dark yellowish brown. The subsoil ranges from gray silty clay loam with
dark yellowish brown and yellowish brown mottling to light gray clay loam to a grayish
brown clay loam to a light brownish gray clay loam a mottling of brownish yellow and
yellowish brown. The substratum is a light brownish gray loam with brownish yellow and
strong brown mottling (Golden et al. 1994).

CHAPTER III. CULTURE HISTORY

The following discussion of culture history follows Perttula’s (2004) recent synthesis
of Texas prehistory. The project area is located in east Texas which is dominated by the Post
Oak Savanna, Piney Woods, and to a lesser extent the Blackland Prairie biotic communities.
Prehistoric resource exploitation practices and settlement patterns are closely linked to the
physical environment. It follows that the properties of the biotic communities play an
important role in how prehistoric peoples adapted to their environment, and how, in turn,
those adaptations are manifested in the surviving archaeological record.
The Post Oak Savanna and Piney Woods communities are located on the Gulf Coast
Plain and represent the western edge of the eastern U.S. woodlands. The Post Oak Savanna
is a narrow transition zone between the drier Blackland Prairie to the west and the moister
Piney Woods to the east. Though dominated by trees, both deciduous and evergreen, the
Post Oak and Piney Woods communities are mosaics of forests and prairie. Water is
available year round and swampy conditions exist in the bottomlands of major drainages.
The modern climate, with its abundant flora and fauna, arose approximately 3,000 years ago.
Since that time the region has been intensively occupied by Native American groups and
others. While cyclical periods of wet and dry climate undoubtedly affected all groups in the
area, the agriculturally based Caddo were probably affected the most (Perttula 2004).
Identified archaeological sites tend to date from the Late Holocene because
landscape-changing forces have either destroyed earlier sites through erosion, or deeply
buried later sites. Paleo-Indian, Archaic, Woodland/Late Prehistoric and Historic periods
are all represented within the Northeast Texas Archaeological Region. However, in terms of
archaeology in Texas, the Caddo are perhaps the most remarkable cultural group because
they represent the southwestern most expression of the Mississippian Culture area.

PALEO-INDIAN PERIOD (ca. 11,500-8,000 YBP)
In northeast Texas, the Paleo-Indian Period is primarily represented by surficial,
mixed or isolated finds of diagnostic projectile points. Temporal information concerning
these finds is often derived from comparisons with well dated and stratified sites to the east
and west of the region. Among the most substantial Paleo-Indian sites within the region is
the Forrest Murphey Site (41MR62) located above Big Cypress Creek. The Forrest Murphey
site produced several discrete concentrations of stone tools, lanceolate points, and diagnostic
artifacts including Clovis, Plainview and Dalton projectile points, some of which were found
in apparent association with extinct elephant bones, a true rarity (Story 1990). The other
substantial Paleo-Indian site from the region is the Delta Bone Quarry 5 Site (41DT86),
which contained an antler tool and fire hearth. Carbon dated charcoal from the hearth
indicates the site is contemporaneous with Clovis, Folsom, and Dalton complexes within the
6

CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION--DO NOT RELEASE

region (Perttula 1989). Undoubtedly other, more substantial Paleo-Indian sites remain
undiscovered within the region as is evidenced by a poorly known site eroding out of the
Lake Palestine shoreline. Avocational archaeologists have reported a plethora of PaleoIndian material from the site, including 35 Paleo-Indian lanceolate projectile points (i.e.
Folsom, Scottsbluff, and Dalton), projectile point preforms, drills, scrapers, and channel
flakes. The materials are made of non-local cherts from the Edwards Plateau and cherts and
quartzite from the Ouachita Mountains (Story 1990).
Paleo-Indian occupations are principally located in valleys of major stream basins and
resource rich areas, i.e. the Ouchita Mountain escarpment. Generally, Paleo-Indian
adaptation within the region was limited to the use of small encampments and a generalized
tool kit (Anderson 1996; Thurmond 1990a). One model suggests that the earliest PaleoIndian occupation of the southeastern U.S. (including Texas) occurred in the resource rich
Mississippi River Basin and spread throughout the wooded areas with occupations/sites
separated by 250 to 400 kilometers (155 to 249 miles). The widely scattered distribution of
sites across diverse landform types and within different settings suggests that Paleo-Indian
groups were very mobile hunter-gatherers rather than mega fauna specialists (Anderson
1996).

ARCHAIC PERIOD (ca. 8,000- 2,200 YBP)
In the Northeastern Texas Archaeological Region, the Archaic Period is divided into
three sub-periods: Early Archaic, Middle Archaic, and Late Archaic. The division of the
period into sub-periods emphasizes the underlying common characteristics of the period
while also recognizing change over time. Archaic Period groups were largely aceramic
hunter-gatherers who ranged over a variety of environmental settings. The archaeological
record reveals an increase over time in reliance on native plant species, expedient lithic
technologies, and long term or repeated use of site loci. There also appears to have been a
population increase and a concomitant emergence of territorialism between groups.
Ceramics make their first appearance in the prehistory of the region at the end of the Archaic
Period. The sub-periods are defined in part by projectile point sequences established by
Johnson (1962), Story (1990), and Thurmond (1990b). Straight and expanding stem forms
are representative of the Early and Middle Archaic, while contracting stem forms are
diagnostic of the Late Archaic.
The first 4,000 years (ca. 8,000 to 4,000 YBP) of the Archaic Period was much drier
than today according to recent paleoenvironmental data (Ferring 1995). Prairies comprised a
greater proportion of the habitat in the region, although the xeric conditions did not preclude
human occupations. During the Early Archaic (ca. 8,000 to 6,000 YBP) groups were highly
mobile and subsisted on a variety of food species, concentrating on deer and slack water
aquatic species as well as hickory nuts and acorns. Occupation sites reflect a pattern of
repeated occupations by small foraging groups utilizing an expedient lithic technology. Sites
are found along major drainages as well as in the interior uplands (Anderson 1996).

7

CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION--DO NOT RELEASE

During the Middle Archaic (ca. 6,000 to 4,000 YBP) occupations became more
substantial and extensive within the major river basins of the region. Less intensively used
sites are also located on minor tributaries and headwaters. “Open camps” are a typical site
type with lithic assemblages comprised of projectile points, generalized cutting and scraping
tools, cores and debitage. Tools were primarily made of locally available lithic material;
however, there is evidence for a limited exchange of finished tools made of non-local
material (Fields and Tomka 1993; Perttula 1984). In the case of sites at Lake Cooper, the
non-local raw material originated in the Red River basin to the north (Fields et al. 1997).
Increased utilization of plant material is generally associated with the presence of
groundstone artifacts and burned rock features. The burned rock features probably represent
hearths, ovens, or cooking pits.
By the Late Archaic (ca. 4,000 to 2,200 YBP) prehistoric groups were exploiting
nearly all of the region’s varied environmental settings. Late Archaic sites are found along
major streams, near springs, on spring fed branches, on upland ridges and on tributary
drainages of all sizes (Cliff and Hunt 1995; Cliff et al. 1996; Dixon et al. 1997; Thurmond
1990b). Settlement data suggest widely dispersed camps and foraging areas, higher
population densities, more limited group mobility, and the possible establishment of
territorial ranges (Perttula 2004). Late Archaic peoples still followed a generalized foraging
subsistence strategy; however, the presence of extensive burned rock features, pits, and
hearths at many sites indicates an increased emphasis on the cooking and bulk processing of
plant species. The intensive use of some sites along major drainages is further evidenced by
the presence of earthen middens (Cliff et al. 1996). Unlike other areas of North America
during this period, there is no evidence for the cultivation of native plant species by
prehistoric groups in the Northeastern Texas Archaeological Region during the Late Archaic
(Fritz 1994). The argument for relatively limited inter-regional interaction between groups is
based in part on the paucity of non-local lithic material (Fields and Tomka 1993; Perttula and
Bruseth 1995). By contrast, contemporary assemblages from sites in the neighboring
Mississippi River Basin abound with non-local lithic raw materials (Saunders and Allen
1997).

WOODLAND PERIOD (ca. 2,200 -1,600 YBP)
For the most part, peoples of the Woodland Period were hunter-gatherers who
followed a seasonal foraging strategy but lived in increasingly larger groups and resided for
longer periods of time at certain sites. In the vicinity of the project area, Woodland Period
sites account for 25 to 50 percent of the identified prehistoric sites. Use and occupation of
the region was variable and site types range from limited use camps to moderately sized
settlements. For example, sites along the Red River ranged in size from one to four hectares
(2.5 to 9.9 acres) (Schambach 1983). The presence of middens, structural remains, and
burials provides evidence for increasing sedentism, although not to the scale of later Caddo
occupiers.
One reason for the increase in sedentism may be the adoption of limited horticulture
and the desire to be close to a certain plant food during a particular season (Corbin 1998).
8

CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION--DO NOT RELEASE

The Woodland diet included a variety of wild terrestrial and aquatic animal species, nuts,
native seeds, as well as cultivated squash (McGregor 1996). Furthermore, chipped stone
axes and hoe-shaped tools suggest horticulture related activities including colonizing weedy
annuals and clearing forests. During this period, maize was not a significant food source
(Rose et al. 1998).
One distinguishing characteristic of the Woodland Period from the Archaic Periods is
the appearance of ceramics. The use of ceramics within the region is variable, with some
sites (particularly along the Red River) yielding copious numbers of ceramic artifacts while
others (notably between the Sulphur and Sabine Rivers) producing far less. Because
ceramics are associated with boiled foods (particularly those rich in carbohydrates) and
increased sedentism, archaeologists have suggested that sites with high numbers of ceramic
artifacts reflect different dietary habits and settlement practices than sites with few ceramics
(Perttula 2004; Skibo and Blinman 1999). Ceramic types tend to be of the Lower Mississippi
Valley type and include Tchefuncte Stamped, Churupa Punctated, Marksville Incised,
Marksville Stamped, and Troyville Stamped. The ceramics may have been traded, or local
potters may have adopted these styles from neighboring groups (Perttula and Bruseth 1995;
Schambach 1982).
In addition to the introduction of ceramics, the advent of the bow and arrow was a
major technological development during the Woodland Period (Turner and Hester 1993;
Newcomb 1961). The diagnostic points of this period are Catahoula, Friley, Alba, and
Bonham (Turner and Hester 1993).
Mortuary practices from the Woodland Period provide more evidence for sedentism
within the Woodland Period. While Woodland mounds are present in nearby areas of
Arkansas and Louisiana, no Woodland Period burial mounds have been documented in the
immediate region. The Hurricane Hill Site along the Sulphur River has yielded flexed,
bundle, and cremation burials in a small burial ground (Perttula 1999). At the Snipes Site
(41CP8), shallow extended burials included whole vessels, boatstones, celts, and bifaces used
as funerary objects (Schambach 1982). Burial practices at the Hurricane Hill Site and the
Johnny Ford Site across the Red River in Arkansas are comparable to one another,
suggesting shared belief systems among Woodland Period groups (Perttula 2004).
Furthermore, Perttula (2004) maintains that formally bounded cemeteries at Woodland sites
suggest the presence of distinctive social groups based on kinship or residence.

PREHISTORIC CADDO CULTURE (A.D. 800-1600)
The Caddo Culture in Texas, which represents the southwestern most expression of
the Mississippian Tradition, was part of a larger culture area that spanned east Texas and
parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, and Oklahoma. More is known about the Caddo
Culture than any of the previous prehistoric periods largely because their story includes
prehistory, history and ethnography. Archaeologists have used contact period accounts by
Europeans to augment their understanding of the archaeological record. After contact, the
Caddo remained in northeast Texas, much reduced in numbers, until they either migrated or
9

CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION--DO NOT RELEASE

were removed (1854) to Oklahoma, where they reconstituted as a now federally recognized
tribe. Caddo Culture history is divided into five major periods: Formative, Early, Middle,
Late and Historic. The Late Caddo Period is further subdivided into five phases within Texas
including Angelina, Frankston, McCurtain, Texarkana/Belcher and Titus.

FORMATIVE (A. D. 800-1000), EARLY (A. D. 1000-1200), AND MIDDLE (A.
D.1200-1400) CADDO PERIODS
Sites of the Formative, Early, and Middle Caddo Periods are found primarily on
elevated landforms (alluvial terraces and rises, natural levees and upland edges) adjacent to
streams, minor tributaries, and spring fed branches. There was a preference for sandy loam
soils, perhaps for the good quality of drainage and fertility. All habitats within the region
were utilized, either intensively via sedentary communities or farmsteads, or periodically
through logistical camps for short-term resource exploitation. The economy, which was a
mix of hunting, foraging and agriculture, supported a complex, hierarchical socioeconomic
system symbolically centered on mound structures (Perttula 2004).
The settlement pattern involved a variety of site types ranging in size, intensity, and
occupational duration. The smallest sites were periodically used for limited resource
exploitation. Medium size sites included agricultural hamlets and farmsteads occupied by
one or more families on a seasonal or permanent basis. The largest sites were permanently
occupied villages associated with mounds or mound complexes (Bruseth 1998; Bruseth and
Perttula 1981; Cliff 1997; Cliff et al. 1996; Cruse 1994, 1995; Largent et al. 1997;
Middlebrook 1994, 1997; Perttula et al. 1986; Thurmond 1990b). The George C. Davis Site
is perhaps the most thoroughly understood site of this type in Texas. The site was occupied
from ca. 800 to 1350 AD and consisted of a village with three mounds. Mounds A and B
were flat-topped platform mounds while Mound C was a burial mound that contained 25 to
30 elite ranking burials (Story 1997, 1998, 2000). The Oak Hill Village Site (41RK214) is a
non-mound site with 42 circular to rectangular post structures arranged around a central
plaza. There were also extensive middens, a possible granary and two large circular
structures that may have served as public structures (Cruse 1994, 1995; Rogers et al. 1994;
Rogers and Perttula 1999).
The subsistence strategy was a mix of hunting, foraging and agriculture. Hunting and
gathering activities focused on fish, deer and other animal species as well as the collection of
nuts and tubers. Cultivated foods included native seed, maize, and squash (Perttula and
Bruseth 1983). However, maize does not appear to have been cultivated prior to ca. A.D.
1300, although by ca. A.D. 1450 it constituted more than 50 percent of the diet in some areas
(Burnett 1990; Perttula 1996; Rose et al. 1998). The presence of granaries at some sites
indicates that surpluses were common. Burnett (1990) suggests that in the rural Caddo
communities south of the Red River, maize was not a dietary staple, as is evidenced by a low
frequency of dental caries and porotic hyperostosis, conditions often associated with
dependence on maize and other starchy foods.

10

Regular food surpluses catalyzed the development of a rich material culture, helped
divert labor efforts to the construction of mounds, and support a rank of social elites. The
material culture of Formative, Early, and Middle Caddo groups included well made corner
notched and rectangular stemmed arrow points, siltstone and greenstone celts, perforators
and borers, Gahagan bifaces, ceramic earspools, ceramic figurines, and long stemmed Red
River and cigar shaped ceramic pipes (Hofman 1967; Newell and Krieger 1949). Mortuary
practices reflect both the wealth of material culture and hint at a hierarchy of social statuses.
The burial of a single child, perhaps 3 to 4 years old, contained a wealth of grave offerings
including eight ceramic vessels, two paired deer antlers, carved shell inlays, two carved bone
earspools, 32 olivella shell beads, three columella beads, a turtle rattle, a cache of mussel
shell, polished stones, two pitted stones, a cache of six deer ulna awls, two beaver teeth, and
a cache of lithic pebble cores, flaked preforms and a notched shell projectile point
(Middlebrook 1994).
The mounds and mound complexes are manifestations of an extensive, integrated
socioeconomic system. Both temple (flat-topped platform) mounds and burial mounds were
built. The larger sites with multiple mounds and attendant villages served as important civic
and/or ceremonial loci. These sites emerged after ca. A.D. 900 and are more or less evenly
spaced along the Red River, Sabine River and Big Cypress Bayou. Thurmond (1990a)
suggests that this distribution indicates a regional system of interaction and redistribution.

LATE CADDO PERIOD (ca. A.D. 1400-1600)
The Late Caddo Period is characterized by a sedentary, agriculturally based complex
society led by social elites who lived at mound centers. In the Late Caddo Period, the larger
Caddo Culture area (covering parts of Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Texas)
is subdivided into ten phases. Five of these phases are present within Texas: Angelina,
Frankston, McCurtain, Texarkana, and Titus. The Belcher Phase is located along the
Texas/Louisiana border.
Within the Piney Woods of Texas, the manifestation of the Late Caddo Period has
been characterized as part of a rural Caddo community system (Perttula 1992a). Settlements
tend to be along secondary drainages and are widely dispersed hamlets and farmsteads. The
rural community system was part of a hierarchy of interrelated site types. At the base of the
hierarchy were the short-term camps used for resource exploitation and the dispersed hamlets
and farmsteads. Next in the hierarchy were larger “towns” of linear but dispersed
compounds with specialized structures such as brush covered shelters and storage platforms.
At the top of the hierarchy were civic-ceremonial centers with platform and/or burial mounds
(Schambach 1983).
Titus Phase sites, located north of the project area, provide good examples of the sites
within the hierarchy. Small settlements covering 0.2 to1.8 hectares (0.5 to 4.5 acres) account
for 73 percent of the known Titus phase settlements within the Cypress Creek Basin. These
small settlements were occupied year-round, but probably for no more than a generation.
Structures were usually circular and constructed of poles covered with grass or wattle and
11

CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION--DO NOT RELEASE

daub. The interior of the structures was made of racks and benches for sleeping, and some
refuse debris on the unprepared floor. Children tended to be buried beneath house floors.
Household refuse was mostly disposed of in designated areas outside of the house. These
refuse dumps were either communal or associated with a particular structure. Pits, drying
racks, hearths, and armadas/arbors were common exterior features (Thurmond 1990a).
Within the Cypress Creek basin, large settlements (larger than 1.8 hectares [4.5
acres]) account for only four percent of the sites. The Pilgrim’s Pride site (41CP304) is a
well-studied Titus Phase site. Residential areas cover between 2-4 hectares (5-10 acres).
The village consisted of several circular structures, over 100 pit features, refuse deposits,
over 20 burials, and an open plaza. Burials were interred in house floors, as well as a
planned cemetery that contained 19 burials (Thurmond 1990b).
Mound centers tend to be concentrated along major drainages and are not found in the
project area. Mound centers are typically located on the floodplain floor of a major drainage
or on an upland projection. Occupations associated with the mound centers are not found on
the floodplain floor, but rather are located on rises within the floodplain, terraces or upland
projections (Perttula 2004). There are three types of Late Caddo Period Mounds: temple
mounds, burial mounds, and fire mounds (Kelley 1998; Webb 1959). Mound centers served
civic-ceremonial functions and were presided over by resident social elites. In part, evidence
for social ranking comes from burials. High status burials consisted of large shaft tombs with
multiple internments, a high percentage of grave offerings with a great number of arrow
points and ceramic vessels, and the inclusion of specialty grave offerings such as large Galtstyle bifaces. Only males were interred in these burials (Perttula 2004).
The only Late Caddo Period Mound located in either Anderson or Houston Counties
is the Frankston Phase A. C. Saunders site (41AN19), a small 7-foot (2.2-meter) high mound
covering approximately 9230 square feet (858 square meters). The mound probably
represents a fire temple (Jackson 1936; Kleinschmidt 1982). Small mound centers within the
Titus Phase area lack either burial mounds or large platform mounds. Instead, the mounds
appear to bury burned structures.
Late Caddo Period people buried their dead in a variety of ways. Children in
particular were interred beneath house floors (Perttula 2004), and small family cemeteries
were maintained at hamlets, farmsteads and in the larger settlements. In addition, formally
maintained, community or supralocal cemeteries are extant, with little incidence of burials
intruding one upon another. This suggests that the cemeteries were planned and periodically
expanded (Perttula 1992b). Family cemeteries contain single, extended interments with
graves placed in rows. Graves have a roughly east-west orientation. Grave offerings differ
by age and by sex. The fewest number of offerings were included in children’s burials while
the greatest numbers were buried with adults. Males tended to be buried with clusters of
arrow points, while females were buried with polishing stones or ceramic vessels (Thurmond
1990b). Community cemeteries contained individuals from nearby communities. They
typically contain 60 to 70 individuals, but some have as many as 150 to 300 individuals
(Perttula 1992a; Perttula and Nelson 1998, 1999; Story 1990; Turner 1978). At the Tuck
Carpenter (41CP5) site dating from A.D. 1350 to 1550 and the H.R. Taylor site (41HS3)
12

researchers have found evidence for the segregation of graves based on status (Perttula
1992a, Turner 1978).
The material culture of the Late Caddo Period is rich, particularly in decorated
ceramics and adorned luxury items. Ceramics from previous periods were heavily influenced
by Lower Mississippi Valley traditions. It was not until ca. A.D. 700 to 900 that Caddo
ceramics dominated the assemblages of northeastern Texas. Even so, Lower Mississippi
Valley styles remained highly influential (Story 1990). There was a plethora of vessel types
including bowls, bottles, and jars with a wide variety of shapes, sizes and embellishment.
Caddo pottery makers produced both utility wares and fine wares. Ceramics appear to have
had an importance in Caddo life for cooking and serving food and drink, for storing
foodstuffs, as personal possessions, and as exemplars of beauty and craftsmanship.
Furthermore, Caddo ceramics served as status markers for subgroups within the society
(David et al. 1988; Thurmond 1985). The reader is referred to Perttula (2004) for an
overview of Caddo ceramics.
A variety of artifacts have been recovered from Late Caddo Period sites. Earspools
were made of ceramics, slate, and in one case, they were plated with copper. Elbow and
biconical pipes were decorated with incised lines painted with hematite or kaolin clay
(Jackson 1933; Turner 1992). Lithic tools and debris are most conspicuous because of their
relative scarcity. This probably reflects a shift to utilization of bone and wood for tool
manufacture. Chipped stone tools include triangular and corner-notched arrow points, flake
tools, drills, and scrapers. Groundstone implements include petaloid and tabular celts, manos
and metates, abrading slabs, and battered and polished cobbles and pebbles (Thurmond
1990a; Turner 1992). Bone tools include beamers, punches, awls, pins and rattles for turtle
carapaces. Exotic materials such as lithic raw materials and Gulf Coast shells suggest that
trade existed between the Caddo rural communities and the larger population centers. In
addition, people of the Caddo Cultural area maintained trade links with horticulturalists in the
southwestern U.S., as well as the Southern Plains and the Lower Mississippi Valley (Baugh
1998; Kidder 1998).

HISTORIC CADDO PERIOD (A.D. 1542-1835)
Spanish explorers first encountered the rural Caddo communities of northern Texas in
1543 when Luis de Moscoso led a group of men returning to Mexico following the death of
de Soto (Glover 1935). While there was a long hiatus between contacts with Europeans,
Caddo culture was affected by the introduction of trade goods and new epidemic diseases. In
1679 a group of Spanish soldiers were stationed at Caddo Lake, which later became the now
vanished town of Port Caddo. At the time of contact the Caddo were organized into
confederacies within the Caddo culture area. Prior to European contact, the Hasinai Caddo
groups occupied permanent settlements along the Neches and Angelina river basins as far as
the Trinity River. They continued to live in this region until the Republic of Texas removed
them in 1836.
Beginning in the late 17th century, with the intrusion by La Salle into the Hasinai
territory in the 1680s, Caddo groups in northeast Texas became caught up in the rivalry
13

CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION--DO NOT RELEASE

between the Spanish to the west and the French to the east. French traders were in residence
at many of the major Caddo settlements by the mid 18th century. The Caddo found
themselves on the edges of both the “Horse Frontier” and “Gun Frontier”. Native American
groups to the west had horses, but no guns, while groups to the east had guns but no horses.
For a time, Caddo groups exploited this situation by expanding their hunting territories to the
west using both guns and horses, and at times serving as middle men to provide guns and
horses to those in need. In addition, they became involved with the European fur trade,
mainly supplying buffalo and deerskins. The Caddo also engaged in the Apache slave trade.
The Caddo traded Apache children for European goods at the French and Spanish markets at
Natchitoches and Los Adaes. Their economic stature and skill as mediators made them
desirable partners for the vying French and Spanish, which was manifested in annual gifts to
the Caddo from the European powers.
Population upheavals further altered the character of the Caddo heartland.
Displacement of northern Wichita speaking tribes to the south resulted in an alliance with the
Hasinai in the margins of the Post Oak Savanna. Caddo populations were greatly reduced by
epidemics and decimated groups merged with one another. At the same time eastern tribes
(Biloxi, Alabama, Coushatta, Choctaw and Cherokee) sought and were granted permission to
resettle in the Caddo heartland after being displace from their lands by Anglo settlers. By
between 1836 and 1842, the Hasinai, Nadaco, and Cadohadacho Caddo groups were forced
from east Texas. Some moved west of the Brazos River for a short time before being
forcibly relocated to the Indian Territories (present day Oklahoma).

HARRISON COUNTY, TEXAS
Located in northeastern Texas along the Louisiana border and north of Panola
County, Harrison County encompasses 894 square miles in East Texas. Before the Spanish
arrived in the 16th century, the Caddo Indians, being agriculturalists, had lived in the area for
centuries. Due to the Spanish invasion, the settlers who were arriving in the area, mainly
from the southern U.S. with their slaves and “cotton-plantation society,” had few problems
(Campbell 2007). The Congress of the Republic of Texas officially established Harrison
County in 1839 and was named for the Texas revolutionary Jonas Harrison. In 1842,
Marshall became the county seat. By the mid 1800s, the county was one of the richest and
most productive counties in Texas. After the Civil War, the population of the county, as was
most of the southern states, were bitter towards federal authority and the Republican Party,
until 1948 when the views of the county changed and people started voting Republican
(Campbell 2007).
Through the 1930s, the county remained mainly agricultural. The number of farms
grew and cotton production rose. Harrison County also saw the expansion of the railroad to
Shreveport, Dallas/Ft. Worth and Texarkana. The 1930s brought the Great Depression and
hard times fell on the people of Harrison County, as it did for the entire nation. The workers
of the county relied heavily on non-agricultural jobs for the first time (Campbell 2007). As
time went on, fewer people worked in agriculture and cotton nearly disappeared. Although
more and more people were moving out the county, and the agricultural economy was
14

CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION--DO NOT RELEASE

declining, growth was occurring. Automobiles and paved roads were becoming more
prevalent and electricity was finding its way to more and more rural areas. First discovered
in 1928, oil has been, and still is, contributing to the county’s economy (Campbell 2007).
Today, Harrison County is still chiefly agricultural, although oil and gas, lumber, and pottery
have continued to be key contributors to the area’s successful economy. Marshall, the county
seat, is still the largest populated city in the county (Campbell 2007).

PANOLA COUNTY, TEXAS
Located in northeastern Texas along the Louisiana border and south of Harrison
County, Panola County covers 842 square miles in East Texas. During the 16th and 17th
Centuries when the European countries were trying to stake their claims in the New World,
Spain and France both claimed the area of Texas from the Sabine River and to the south and
west. As in Harrison County, the encroachment of the Europeans eventually pushed the
Indian tribes living in the area, namely the Caddo and Hasinais, out, giving the soon to be
settlers few problems. After warfare and numerous feuds, the Texas legislature established
Panola County in 1846 (LaGrone 2007). The village of Pulaski was ultimately named a
temporary county seat until 1848 when, because of debates on the “legality of the choice,” a
small townsite now known as Carthage was decided on as the county seat (LaGrone 2007).
Through the early 1900s, Panola County was largely farmland that included cotton
and vegetable crops. Livestock was also an important part of the economy. By the 1880s,
logging became an integral part of the economy. As the 1930s approached, changes came.
As was happening in other parts of the nation, the Great Depression created a decline in
farms and the population of the county. Oil and gas discoveries, in 1917 and 1936,
respectively, helped the population decline to be not as severe as other areas. In 1944, the
Jordan well, a mile west of Carthage, tapped into an underground reservoir under half of the
county. Due to the large production of this well, the population the county started to rise.
Numerous improvements occurred, including a county airport, radio station, two newspapers,
a hospital, and even a county flag (LaGrone 2007).
Today, Panola County’s economy is comprised primarily of gas and oil-field
operations, agriculture, timber, and food processing. Farming and ranching are also large
pars of the county’s growing economy. The largest town in Panola County is Carthage, the
county seat, with 6,664 citizens as of the 2000 census (LaGrone 2007).

CHAPTER IV. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

LITERATURE REVIEW AND SITE FILE RESEARCH STRATEGY
Background and site file research was conducted prior to fieldwork mobilization.
The background literature search included a review of both archaeological site files and
architectural resource files, and a review of previously conducted cultural resource surveys in
the vicinity of the proposed project. This information was obtained by reviewing records
through the on-line Texas Archaeological Sites Atlas, maintained by the THC.
Site file research was performed in order to identify all previously recorded
archaeological sites within a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile) radius extending 0.8 kilometers (0.50
miles) from each side of the proposed pipeline centerline, and all recorded historic structures
eligible for National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) listing located adjacent to the
project APE.
Site file research was used to provide a historic context to the archaeological survey,
and additional documentary research was conducted in order to provide an understanding of
the development and history of the APE, the surrounding area, and southeast Texas in
general. This research then was used to prepare an overview history of the area, and
provided an understanding of the contextual framework of prehistory and history in Harrison
and Panola counties.

FIELD SURVEY METHODS
Per THC guidelines, minimum standards for surface reconnaissance and subsurface
testing on linear projects call for 16 shovel tests per 1.6 kilometers (1 mile), within a 100-foot
(30-meter) wide corridor. Our survey strategy surpassed the minimum requirements, while
focusing survey efforts on sections of the pipeline route that contained the highest potential
for discovering buried resources.
The archaeological investigation consisted of a combination of reconnaissance
(surface) survey and intensive pedestrian (subsurface) survey across the entire pipeline route
and associated access roads and facilities. Archaeological investigation within the 60-meter
(200-foot) wide pipeline study corridor included the 23-meter (75-foot) wide temporary
construction right-of-way, a 15.25-meter (50-foot) permanent easement, and extra temporary
workspaces at all road and water body crossings. Systematic shovel testing was conducted
across the entire pipeline route along two parallel transects spaced 30 meters (100 feet) apart
within the 60-meter (200-foot) wide survey corridor (Figures 2-10).

Archaeological investigation of proposed project attributes located outside of the study
corridor included visual reconnaissance of 11 existing unpaved access roads and shovel
testing within a the limits of proposed facility extending outside of the survey corridor at the
northwestern end of the pipeline route.
All shovel tests measured 30-centimeter by 30-centimeter (12-inch by 12-inch) in
diameter. Vertical control of each shovel tests was maintained by excavating in arbitrary 10centimeter (4-inch) levels. One wall of each shovel test was profiled and the walls and floor
of each shovel test were inspected for color or texture change potentially associated with the
presence of cultural features. Whenever possible, shovel tests were excavated into sterile
subsoil, and soils were screened through 0.64-centimeter (0.25-inch) wire mesh; soils with
high clay content were hand sorted.
If buried resources were located, an attempt was made to define their boundaries.
Additional delineation shovel tests were excavated in four radiating directions in intervals
between 10 and 30 meters (33 and 100 feet) within the confines of the study corridor. In
general, two sterile shovel tests were used to define a site’s size and location. At a minimum,
between six and eight delineation shovel tests were excavated unless surrounding landforms
or topography suggested the presence of a natural site boundary.
When encountered, standing structures immediately adjacent to the study corridors
that appeared to be 50 years in age or older were photographed during the survey and their
locations plotted on field maps with Global Positioning System (GPS) points collected.
General characteristics of each resource were noted on standardized forms.

Probability Modeling
Prior to initiating the field survey, the topographic quadrangle maps were closely
examined and information about previously recorded sites in the general area was collected
in an effort to determine which areas along the pipeline route were most likely to contain
archaeological sites. Using this information, the route was divided into areas of low and high
probability for containing buried, intact archaeological sites.
The field strategy entailed surveying areas considered to have a low probability at a
less intensive shovel test interval, thereby allowing the survey crew to concentrate their
efforts on areas most likely to contain intact, significant buried resources. Previously
completed surveys and linear pipeline studies in east and southeast Texas have successfully
utilized this strategy in the past (Brownlow 2001; Nash 1995) or have resulted in evidence
that support the use of this survey strategy (Cliff and Hunt 1995; Dixon et al. 1997; Hughey
et al. 2004; Hughey and Picklesimer 2004; Turner and Hughey 2007a, 2007b, and 2007c).
Sections of the pipeline route that were more intensely investigated, referred to as
high probability areas (HPAs), were generally located within 100-200 meters (300-600 feet)
from existing or remnant waterways. While in the field, the HPAs were verified; if field
observations suggested that these zones should be extended to include additional high
26

CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION--DO NOT RELEASE

potential landforms, additional areas were investigated. Likewise, field verification allowed
for certain suspected HPAs to be surveyed at a less intensive shovel test interval if evidence
of prior disturbance, the presence of saturated soils, excessive slope, or other factors were
noted.
Within the HPAs, such as at creek crossings and stream terraces, the shovel test
interval was decreased to between 30 and 60 meters (100 and 200 feet). At each creek
crossing, a series of close-interval shovel tests were excavated on each transect on each side
of the creek. At these locations, shovel tests were excavated as close to the creek banks as
possible and were sometimes offset to capture notable elevations in topographic relief that
may have been excellent places for temporary prehistoric campsites.
All remaining portions of the pipeline route not considered HPAs, were surveyed at a
less intensive shovel test interval, while adhering to the Texas state minimum standards.
These areas, referred to as low probability areas (LPAs), were shovel tested at a 100-meter
(300-foot) interval along two transects within the study corridor, with judgmental shovel
testing conducted on notable landforms.

CHAPTER V. RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

All 17.77 kilometers (11.04 miles) of the proposed Line CP-3 (Penn-Virginia)
pipeline route including all extra workspaces have been surveyed within the 60-meter (200foot) wide study corridor. In addition to the pipeline and extra workspace surveys, the 11
existing access roads and measurement facilities have also been surveyed. The total area
surveyed for this project is approximately 139.84 hectares (345.55 acres). Survey efforts did
not result in the identification of previously recorded or newly identified cultural resources
within the project’s study corridor. The results of literature review, site file research, and field
survey are provided below.

RESULTS OF LITERATURE REVIEW AND SITE FILE RESEARCH
Site file review indicated that no previously identified archaeological sites are located
within the 1.6-kilometers (1-mile) wide study radius. Site file research indicated that one
historical marker is located near the proposed pipeline route. Historical Marker No. 10233
(Woodley House) is located approximately 500 meters (0.30-mile) south of the pipeline route
(see Figure 1) within the study radius. Two additional historical markers are located
immediately outside the study radius. Historical Marker No. 10225 (Ware Home) is located
northeast of the northwestern end of pipeline route and Historical Marker No. 10136 (Bailey
Anderson) is located northeast of the southeastern end of pipeline route (see Figure 1). No
previous archaeological investigations have been conducted within the 1.6-kilometer (1-mile)
radius of the pipeline study corridor.
Although no previously recorded sites are located within the study radius, site file
research indicated that numerous archaeological sites have been previously recorded five
kilometers (three miles) outside of the project area. The high frequency and density of these
sites indicated that the current archaeological investigation was likely to result in the
identification of new archaeological sites and historic structures. Based on this information,
a random sample of 20 previously recorded sites located west and east of the current project
area were chosen for review in an effort to develop an understanding of common site types
and attributes in the general area. Information regarding geographic and environmental
setting, depth and stratigraphy of archaeological deposits, site size, and temporal affiliation
of sites was obtained where possible using the site forms available on the Texas
Archaeological Sites Atlas.
Typical prehistoric sites located west of the project area include 41HS481, 41HS681,
41HS682, and 41HS701. These sites, among others, were identified in 1996 during a large
area survey conducted by Southern Archeological Consultants, Inc. (SAC, Inc). All are
located in Harrison County and can be found on the Colliers Creek USGS 7.5-minute
topographic quadrangle map. These sites are small, buried lithic scatters located on perennial
28

CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION--DO NOT RELEASE

stream terraces with thick sandy loam alluvial deposits. The vertical deposition of artifacts
associated with these sites is typically widely distributed, with deposit depth ranging from
between the ground surface to 90 centimeters (35 inches) below the surface. Using the site
forms, it is unclear if these deposits are widely dispersed across one thick soil stratum, or
dispersed across multiple strata. The depositional integrity associated with these sites is also
unclear, although there is some documentation that the majority of these sites have been
partially disturbed as a result of mining, natural erosion, and mechanical earth-borrowing
activities.
Typical historic sites east of the project area include Sites 41HS854, 41HS86, and
41HS865 located in Harrison County on the Stricklin Springs USGS 7.5-minute topographic
quadrangle map. In 2005, the Northeast Texas Archaeological Society and Harrison County
THC Steward recorded these sites. These sites are generally located in the outer floodplain
and on gentle slopes near perennial streams. Historic sites in the area are generally
composed of late eighteenth century to mid-twentieth century artifacts including wire-cut
nails, window and bottle glass fragments, whiteware and stoneware fragments, and
handmade brick fragments. The site forms indicate that vertical artifact deposition associated
with these sites typically ranges from exposure on the ground surface to a depth of 40
centimeters (15.75 inches) below the surface. The depositional integrity associated with
these sites is not entirely clear using the information available online.

RESULTS OF INTENSIVE PEDESTRIAN SURVEY
Field survey efforts conducted with the 60-meter (200-foot) wide study corridor did
not result in the identification of any newly recorded archaeological sites or historic
structures. Representative shovel test profiles are provided on Figure 11 below. Selected
photographs captured during survey within the study corridor are shown in Plates 1-4.
Based on the results of the site file research and data gathered from examination of
the topographic quadrangle maps, the pipeline study corridor was divided into areas of low
and high probability for containing archaeological resources (referred to as LPAs and HPAs).
Using the information obtained from previously recorded prehistoric and historic sites in the
general area, similar sites within the project area were expected to be located near the creek
crossings and terraces within sandy loam alluvial deposits.
A total of six HPAs were surveyed in the vicinity of Quapaw Creek, Caddo Creek,
Caney Creek, and Jackson Creek and a few of their associated natural drainageways (see
Figures 2-10). The HPAs were surveyed using close interval shovel test placement with no
more than 30 to 60 meters (100 to 200 feet) between shovel tests (see Figure 3-10). The
remaining length of pipeline route was considered LPA and was surveyed in accordance with
the Texas state minimum standards at an average of 16 shovel tests per 1.6 kilometers (1
mile) within the 60-meter (200-foot) wide study corridor along two transects spaced no more
than 30 meters (100 feet) apart (see Figures 3-10).

The 11 existing access roads were visually inspected by conducting a walkover
survey (see Figures 3-10). The total area covered during pedestrian survey of the access
roads was 23.73 hectares (58.65 acres).
The majority of the pipeline study corridor is located immediately parallel to existing
and maintained pipeline ROW and utility transmission corridors. In many cases, subsurface
survey of one of the two survey transects was investigated by reconnaissance survey only
because of its overlap into these disturbed areas.
In addition, major disturbances observed within the study corridor included extensive
pine timber farms and numerous water-filled, mechanically excavated borrow pits. Timber
farms are characterized by equally spaced rows of trees with furrows between each row (see
Plate 1). Timber farming involves long-term repetitive clearing, planting, and harvesting that
can result in extensive disturbance to the ground surface and below, often exceeding one
meter (three feet) in depth. Information obtained from the CEGT field agents indicated that
large borrow pits were excavated out of a need to build up the rail bed during previous
railroad construction. At the time of survey, these mechanically excavated borrow pits were
filled with water and appeared to have been used as stock ponds for a long period of time.
The banks were overgrown with dense vegetation and many of them were partially eroded
along the banks (see Plate 4).
Other information that may contribute to lack of cultural resources within the
surveyed involves the condition of the soils within the HPAs. According to a review of the
published soil surveys for Harrison and Panola counties, soils within the HPAs include the
Socagee, Bonn-Cart complex, and Cart-Erno complex (Dolezel 1975, Golden et al. 1994).
These soils are typically located on floodplains near large creeks and on mounded stream
terraces near small creeks and bayous. However, these soils are generally considered poorly
drained, have slow permeability, and are described as highly mottled, indicating frequently
saturated ground surfaces. Frequent flooding would have made these locales unfavorable for
prehistoric and historic period habitation.
Based on the soil descriptions above, the soils observed within the HPAs differed
slightly from the published descriptions in these locations. The observed soils did not
contain the highly mottled qualities or loam content described by Dolezel (1975) and Golden
et al. (1994). The observed soils were also most commonly composed of sand with uniform
color in the upper strata followed by sandy soils with high clay content in the lower horizon.
It may be possible that recent land clearing and modification activities have
contributed to increased erosion and flooding of these areas, thus contributing to the observed
changes in the sediment at these locations. If this scenario is plausible, then it is also
possible that if any intact archaeological deposits were located within the previously
undisturbed soils, they have likely been displaced as a result of increased erosion and
flooding, thus contributing to the lack of observed archaeological resources.

CHAPTER VI. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

This report presents the results of an intensive pedestrian cultural resources survey of
17.77 kilometers (11.04 miles) of the proposed 17.77-kilometer (11.04-mile) proposed Line
CP-3 (Penn-Virginia) pipeline route and associated appurtenances within the 60-meter (200foot) wide survey corridor.
Including the 11 existing access roads, portions of an abandoned pipeline alignment,
the entire proposed route, and proposed facilities, a total of 139.84 hectares (345.55 acres)
were surveyed during this investigation.
All shovel tests excavated as a result of the survey were negative for artifacts or
cultural features. No buried archaeological sites or aboveground historic structures were
recorded. No exposed sites or artifacts were observed on the ground surface as result of the
visual reconnaissance of the access roads.
Based on these results, no prehistoric or historic cultural resources will be affected by
the proposed project. HRA Gray & Pape recommends no further work within the surveyed
area and that the project be allowed to proceed as planned.

INTRODUCTION
In December of 2007, a crew from SURA, Inc. conducted a Phase I cultural
resources survey of several areas near Marshall, in northeast Texas, where the
Centerpoint pipeline was to be rerouted. These areas are shown by Figures 1 and 2 below.
The SURA crew consisted of three persons, Dr. Malcolm K. Shuman, Mr. Troy Martin
and Mr. Karl M. Shuman. Dr. Shuman has approximately 30 years’ experience doing
surveys in pine hill environments, primarily in Kisatchie National Forest, Louisiana.

ENVIRONMENT
The surveyed areas may be described as tertiary uplands; they consist of hilly
topography covered by pine forest, with hardwoods in the bottoms. Fauna are composed
of a wide assortment of mammals, such as deer, rabbit, squirrels, raccoons, coyotes,
opossums and, at least formerly, wolves and bears. Avian life includes a number of
songbirds, game birds and raptors.

Figure 2. Topographic map of survey area 4. Survey area in red.

SURVEY AREAS/RESULTS
The areas examined consisted of the three adjacent parcels shown in Figure 1 and
the location depicted in Figure 2. The three adjacent parcels consisted of six acres on the
east side of Blocker Road (Area 1); 1.6 acres adjacent to Area 1, on the north (Area 2);
and .5 acres on the west side of Blocker Road, directly across from Area 2 (Area 3). Area
4 consisted of about 3 acres.
Area 1:
The terrain is rolling pine hills with hardwoods in the bottoms (Figure 3). Soil is
sandy. Some bare spots show sandstone and sandstone gravels, but it is not known if
these were deposited in recent times for stabilization purposes. There is a pumping station
in the NW corner of the tract (Figure 4) and a metering station at 379583E, 3587902N, or
about midway E-W on the north side of the tract (Figure 5). An existing pipeline ROW
extends from this metering station due south all the way across the tract (Figure 6). Width
is about 10 m. The east edge of the area is bounded by an open space with sandy soil
(Figure 7). Undergrowth was minimal at this time, though ground cover was about 75%
obscured by oak leaves and pine needles. There are several E-W trending paths through

this area. Shovel tests were excavated each 30 m on E-W transects spaced 30 m apart
(Figure 8). Distances were determined by pacing, so are not exact. A list of shovel test
profiles appears in Appendix A. In general, these tests show a 10YR5/1 humus of
seldom more than 5 cm thickness, underlain by a 10YR5/3 silty sandy loam to about 15
cm below surface (cmbs), which is itself underlain by a silty sandy loam heavily mottled
with 10YR5/8 sandy clay, ending at approximately 45 cmbs. The lowest stratum
observed is composed of 10YR5/8 sandy clay. No shovel tests were positive for cultural
artifacts and there were no standing structures in the survey area other than the pumping
and metering stations. A total of 26 shovel tests were excavated in Area 1.
Area 2:
Area 2 is a smaller rectangle adjacent to Area 1, on Area 1’s north boundary; the
west boundary of Area 2 fronts Blocker Road (Figures 1 and 8). The topography, soils
and stratigraphy are similar to those of Area 1, although several shovel tests were made in
a drain; their profiles are not detailed with the other shovel test profiles in Appendix B.
Seven shovel tests were excavated in this area, as shown in Figure 8. A trailer home was
located adjacent to Area 2, on the east, and part of the area was crossed by an unpaved
driveway to this home. A single standing structure occurred in Area 2. This was a crib or
shelter in the northeast corner of the area (Figure 9). It was of modern construction, with
a corrugated aluminum roof and wire nails. It was in poor condition and thus, even were
it to be 50 years old, it would fail the test of integrity for National Register of Historic
Places eligibility.

Area 3:
Area 3 is shown in Figures 1 and 8. The SURA crew was instructed to examine
the open field indicated on Figure 8 and shown in Figure 10. This is a ridge that slopes
down to the south at about 20%. Surface visibility was about 5%, as this was a pasture
covered with low grass (Figures 10, 11). Two shovel tests were excavated on an east-west
line along the top of the ridge (i.e., in the pasture) about 30 m apart, and two were
excavated on the slope, about 30 m apart, also on an east-west line. The profiles for these
shovel tests are provided in Appendix C. In general, the surface had been eroded by both
slopewash and agriculture. All shovel tests were negative.
Area 4:
This area was several miles to the southeast of the first three areas and is shown in
Figure 2. The width of the ROW was 200 ft (61 m) and the reroute surveyed extended for
about 2,600 ft (793 m), generally in a NW-SE direction (Figure 12). The SURA crew was
directed by a Centerpoint employee in the field and the area indicated for survey was
considerably less than the full 2,600 ft (793 m). The SE terminus of the reroute was on a
knoll with a pine thicket on the southwest (Figure 13). The route extended northwest
downslope, crossing a small stream and then ending on higher ground just northwest of
the stream. A barbed wire fence that marked a property boundary constricted the ROW
on the north to about 100 ft (31 m) from the top of the slope shown

in Figure 12 to the stream. Two transects along the ROW were conducted, each one about
50 ft (15.2 m) from the center of the ROW, except where the fence required the
northernmost transect to be pulled in toward the center of the ROW. This ridge top was
heavily eroded, with clay subsoil occasionally on the surface at shovel test locations.
Much of the area was a 20% slope down to a creek and on the top of the knoll, at the SE
terminus, the young pine thicket indicated heavy forestry disturbance. No standing
structures were noted in the survey area. All shovel tests were negative.

CONCLUSIONS
No evidence of prehistoric or historic human activity was found by the pedestrian
survey or shovel testing; the areas surveyed had been subjected to considerable
disturbance, with Pleistocene clays never more than about 50 cm below the present
surface. The only artifact recovered was an archaeological shovel stuck upright in the
ground, with the handle marked at 10 cm intervals, found at the SE terminus of Area 4. It
is our opinion that no portion of the four areas surveyed qualifies for nomination to the
National Register of Historic Places. A total of 45 shovel tests were excavated in the
course of the survey and 11.1 acres were surveyed.
