ABSTRACT
On April 12, 2016, personnel from POWER Engineers, Inc. (POWER) performed an intensive
archeological survey of portions of a proposed electrical transmission line on state-owned Texas
Municipal Power Authority property in Grimes County, Texas. The investigation was undertaken
under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7609. Approximately 14.8 acres were surveyed, consisting of
7,160 feet of 90-foot-wide proposed transmission line right-of-way. No cultural resources were
recorded during the survey. Much of the proposed right-of-way has been disturbed by activities
associated with the construction of the Gibbons Creek Steam Electric Station and associated roads,
railroads, and power plant and mining. Due to the lack of cultural materials in the project area,
POWER recommends that construction activities within the project area be allowed to proceed
without further consultation. If, during construction of the transmission line cultural resources are
encountered, all activities at the location should be halted until the Texas Historical Commission is
notified and an appropriate course of action is determined.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Under Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC) Docket 44547, CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric,
LLC (CenterPoint) received a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity (CCN) amendment to construct
the Brazos Valley Connection 345 kV transmission line that will extend from the CenterPoint-owned
Zenith substation in Harris County, Texas, approximately 1.57 miles southwest of the intersection of
State Highway 99 and House Hahl Road, and approximately 1.98 miles northeast of the intersection of
Longenbaugh Road and Katy Hockley Cut Off Road in Harris County, and will end at the Gibbons
Creek substation. The Gibbons Creek substation, which is owned by the Texas Municipal Power Agency
(TMPA) and located in Grimes County, Texas, is approximately 1.87 miles north of the intersection of
State Highway 30 and County Road 171, and approximately 1.16 miles southeast of the intersection of
Farm-to-Market Road 244 and County Road 173 in Grimes County (Figure 1). The northern extent of
the proposed transmission line crosses the state-owned TMPA Gibbons Creek property. In accordance
with the Antiquities Code of Texas, personnel from POWER Engineers, Inc. (POWER) performed an
archeological survey of portions of the proposed project on state-owned land. This includes
approximately 14.8 acres along 7,160 feet of the 100-foot-wide proposed right-of-way (ROW). The
survey was undertaken on April 12, 2016 in partial fulfillment of Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7609.
POWER archeologists Darren Schubert M.A., RPA, Jahleen “Liz” Sefton, and Stephanie R. Martin
performed the surface and subsurface survey (i.e., shovel tests) for the proposed project. Mr. Schubert
meets the Secretary of the Interior’s Professional Qualifications Standards for Archeology (48 Federal
Register [FR] 22716 or 36 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] Part 61).

INTRODUCTION

CenterPoint proposes to construct and operate approximately 59 miles of 345 kilovolt (kV) double circuit
transmission line. The proposed transmission line project extends between the CenterPoint-owned Zenith
substation in Harris County, Texas, and will end at the TMPA-owned Gibbons Creek substation located
in Grimes County, Texas (Figure 1). Approximately 7,160 feet of the proposed transmission line will be
constructed on state-owned TMPA property within a 90-foot-wide ROW. In accordance with the
Antiquities Code of Texas, archeologists from POWER surveyed approximately 14.8 acres, consisting of
the proposed ROW on TMPA property, on April 12, 2016 (Figures 1 and 2). The survey was undertaken
in partial fulfilment of Texas Antiquities Permit 7609. CenterPoint proposes to construct double circuit
monopole supporting structures, spaced up to 850 feet apart. Anticipated subsurface impacts are
anticipated at each tower footing location where soil will be excavated and concrete tower footings will
be constructed. Preliminary engineering and structure spotting has not been completed to date. The
typical monopole structure will be 160 to 220 feet tall.
The project area is located within the Eastern Planning Region as delineated by the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) on the western margin of the southeast Texas archeological region
(Patterson 1995; Story et al. 1990; Perttula 2004).

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

3.1

Geology

The project area is within the Interior Coastal Plains subprovince of the Gulf Coastal Plains
Physiographic Province (BEG 1996). The Interior Coastal Plains are comprised of alternating belts of
resistant uncemented sands among weaker shales that erode into long, sandy ridges (BEG 1996). The
project area is located within the central extent of the province. Within the project area, elevations
range between 250 and 270 feet above mean sea level (amsl). The geology of the area is mapped as
Wellborn and Manning Formations (Barnes 1981), Eocene-aged, fossil-bearing sedimentary rocks as
well as unconsolidated clay, silt, sand, and gravel. Bedrock in these formations is composed primarily
of sandstone, siltstone, and mudstone, with lesser amounts of conglomerate, limestone, and lignite
coal beds (Barnes 1981).

3.2

Cultural Background

3.2.1

Prehistoric Period

The project area is located on the western margin of the southeast Texas archeological region
(Perttula 2004; Patterson 1995; Story et al. 1990). This region extends from the Sabine River along
the upper Texas coast southwestward to the Brazos River delta, and encompasses the gulf coastline as
well as the adjacent inland coastal plain. Very generally, the sequence of recognized archeological
manifestations in southeast Texas has been divided into three periods: Paleoindian, Archaic, and
Ceramic/Late Prehistoric periods. Ricklis (2004) proposes a prehistoric cultural sequence for
southeast Texas consisting of four occupational periods: Paleoindian (ca. 11,500 to 8,000 B.P.
[Before Present]); Archaic (ca. 8,000 to 1,500 B.P. [inland]; 5,000 to 2,220 B.P. [coastal]); the
Ceramic Period (ca 2,000 to 1,200 B.P.); and a final Late Prehistoric period (ca 1,200 years ago to
300 B.P.).

3.2.2

Paleoindian Period (11,500 to 8,000 B.P.)

The earliest well-established human occupation of North America is referred to as Paleoindian. In
southeast Texas evidence of the Paleoindian period is evidenced almost exclusively by isolated
projectile points collected from the ground surface. The earliest of these artifacts are represented by
large fluted Clovis and Folsom points found primarily along major water sources (Ricklis 2004).
Later Paleoindian occupation is represented by San Patrice and Scottsbluff points closer to the
coastline and Plainview and Angostura points along the western margin of the southeast Texas
archaeological region (Ricklis 2004). Story et al. (1990) summarized the distribution and context of
Paleoindian remains in southeast Texas, and found that except for well inland of the modern
coastline, Paleoindian artifacts on the upper Texas coast are from disturbed or secondary contexts.
Because such limited data exist for the Paleoindian period in this area, only certain assumptions can
be made regarding Paleoindian cultural development in the region. The presence of large projectile
points suggests that hunting large mammals was undoubtedly an important component of the
subsistence strategy, although a collection of readily available plant foods probably also contributed
to the diet (Collins 2002). Environmental changes that brought about the extinction or dislocation of
Rancholabrean megafauna triggered a shift away from Paleoindian adaptations toward a broad-based
subsistence orientation termed the Archaic (Willey and Phillips 1958).

3.2.3

Archaic Period (8,000 to 1,150 B.P.)

Ricklis (2004) discusses the Archaic period in southeast Texas in terms of inland and coastal
adaptations. Inland, the Archaic generally extended from 8,000 to 1,500 years ago. Numerous sites
dating to this period have been found along primary streams throughout the region and contain stone
projectile points that are diverse and reduced in size from the earlier Paleoindian period. These dart

points also tend to be made of poorer quality local resources suggesting reduced group mobility and
tighter group territories. A lack of faunal and botanical remains at inland archeological sites precludes
inferring more than a generalized hunting and gathering subsistence system. Well-established
cemeteries also appear in the archaeological record of inland southeast Texas by the middle Archaic.
By the late Archaic, cemeteries have increased substantially in size and most burials contain a diverse
array of grave goods (Ricklis 2004). Story (1985) suggests that the abundance of cemeteries on the
western margin of the coastal prairie zone indicates increased territoriality amongst groups in
response to an ever-increasing population. Hall (2000) posits that highly productive environments
such as river valley bottoms and the floodplains of major streams were home to an aggregate of
resources that were predictable, concentrated, and fixed on the landscape. Such resources allowed late
Archaic groups to operate within smaller, more exclusive territories.
The Archaic period on the upper Texas coast extended from about 5,000 to 2,200 years ago (Ricklis
2004). However, very few intact early Archaic components are known from this region and Aten
(1983), and Story (1985), suggest the inland margin of the coastal plain may have been occupied
more intensely than the coast as sea levels rose during the early Archaic. The coastline reached its
current location between 7,000 and 5,000 B.P. (Aten 1983) and the earliest known shell middens in
the area date to this period (Howard et al. 1991). Coastal Archaic sites that have been tested or
excavated near the modern shoreline generally consist of shell-bearing sites with lithic tools and
debitage, shell and bone tools, and the bones of fish, mammals, and reptiles (Story 1985). Excavation
of site 41AU36 on the lower Brazos River revealed a cemetery in use from the middle Archaic
through the early Ceramic period (Hall 1981). Story (1985) suggests the establishment of cemeteries
along major streams on the coastal plain indicates increased territoriality during the middle and late
Archaic.
Beginning around 3,000 years ago, subsistence systems increasingly focused on coastal zone
resources (Aten 1983; Story et al. 1990). Aten (1979, 1983) hypothesized the establishment of
seasonal rounds, including regular movements from littoral to inland areas during the late Archaic.
Historic native groups have been demonstrated to move in a yearly round from small, dispersed bandsized or less groups during the warm seasons to aggregated villages during the colder months (Aten
1979; Newcomb 1961). Grave goods from site 41AU36 indicate the inhabitants of the site during the
late Archaic were involved in an import-export sphere extending as far as Arkansas (Hall 1981).

3.2.4

Ceramic Period (2,000 B.P. to 1200 B.P.)

Pottery first appeared in southeast Texas along the coast around 2,000 years ago ushering in the
Ceramic period. Based on stylistic elements, they arrived in the region via diffusion from Louisiana
or the Lower Mississippi River Valley, suggesting an increasing interregional influence from
neighboring groups. There were no apparent major shifts in lifeways during the early years after
pottery was introduced. The contents of shell-bearing sites along the upper Texas coast during the
early Ceramic period vary little from the late Archaic shell middens, except for the addition of pottery
and a few evolving dart point types, primarily Gary and Kent types (Ricklis 2004). Discrete
cemeteries located close to major streams continue to enforce the notion of well-established group
territories in response to increasing populations first evident during the Archaic (Aten 1983).
Ceramics appeared in inland southeast Texas several centuries later and most likely disseminated
from the coastal zone where sandy-paste wares had become commonplace (Ricklis 2004).

3.2.5

Late Prehistoric Period (1,200 B.P. to 300 B.P.)

Around 1,300 years ago, small, light, straight and expanded stem arrow points began to appear in
archaeological assemblages, indicating the introduction of the bow and arrow – a hallmark of the Late
Prehistoric period in southeast Texas. Findings at the Mitchell Ridge site on Galveston Island suggest

PAGE 8

POWER ENGINEERS, INC.
Brazos Valley Connection 345 kV Transmission Line Project – Cultural Resource Survey

that the Late Prehistoric period in the region can be divided into two sub-periods. The initial Late
Prehistoric is associated with the introduction of the bow and arrow as evidenced primarily by the
presence of Scallorn arrow points. The final Late Prehistoric period in southeast Texas correlates with
changes taking place throughout much of Texas. These changes include the appearance of bison bone
in archaeological assemblages around 700 to 800 years ago in association with a variety of stone
tools. Stone tools associated with the appearance of bison include Perdiz arrow points, thin bifacial
knives, expanded base drills and perforators, and unifacial end scrapers. The occurrence of bison bone
with these tools suggests a significant shift towards reliance on bison and other large game hunting
and the processing of meat and hides (Ricklis 2004).
Although the adoption of the bow and arrow and shift to bison and large game hunting was occurring
across much of eastern Texas, some areas adapted more slowly to the new technology and subsistence
strategy. In the southern Post-Oak Savannah region, the continued presence of large dart points in
archaeological assemblages indicates that the atlatl continued to be a popular tool even after the bow
and arrow were introduced. This was particularly true during the first half of the Late Prehistoric
period. At the Jewett Mine site, a full one-third of the projectile points were large dart points. Overall,
there appears to have been a subsistence economy that used a variety of animals as well as a variety
of plant foods including hardwood nuts, seeds, and tubers (Fields 2004).
Ceramics in the region continued to evolve during the Late Prehistoric period. Grog and bone
tempering are introduced and decorative elements become more elaborate. The change in external
design elements along the upper Texas coast reflect those of various types of the Coles CreekPlaquemine sequence occurring in coastal Louisiana and the Lower Mississippi River Valley,
suggesting a continued interaction with groups from the east (Ricklis 2004).
As noted above, ceramics were introduced to inland populations several centuries after they appeared
on the East Texas Coast. Archaeological evidence also indicates that the use of ceramics remained
comparatively unimportant to inland groups into the Late Prehistoric period. Ceramic sherds in Late
Prehistoric contexts at Jewett Mine and Gibbons Creek Mine sites are generally equal in number to
shaped stone tools. The ratio of ceramic sherds to shaped stone tools is significantly higher in the
Sabine River valley (Fields 2004).

3.2.6

Historic Period

At the time of European contact much of the region was inhabited by the Bidai, a migratory hunting
and foraging group with limited agriculture (Christian and Leffler 2016; Jackson 2016a). A generally
peaceful group, the Bidai openly traded with Spanish and French settlers in the seventeenth and
eighteenth century. Tensions between Spain and France put the Bidai in a precarious position. The
Spanish suspected the Bidai of working against them by trading guns and munitions with the French
and their allies, the Lipan Apaches (Christian and Leffler 2016; Jackson 2016a; Sjoberg 1951). A
single epidemic introduced by Europeans decimated the Bidai such that by the early 1800s,
approximately 100 members remained. They continued to live peacefully among white settlers as
well as other neighboring tribes, often serving as protection against raids from the Comanches and
Apaches (Jackson 2016a). As European settlements expanded west, the remaining Bidai were
eventually moved to reservations in Oklahoma where their identity was lost (Jackson 2016a).
In 1821, Stephen F. Austin founded a colony of 300 settlers between the Brazos and Colorado Rivers
(Barker 2016; Jackson 2016a). Fertile land and numerous creeks and rivers attracted settlers to his
colony, including Jared Groce, who, in 1921, established the Bernardo Plantation, the first large
cotton farm in Texas, west of present day Hempstead in Waller County (Christian and Leffler 2016;
Holbrook 1970). By 1824, seven of Austin’s original 300 colonists had claimed land in what is now
Grimes County (Jackson 2016a), including the site of what would become the town of Stoneham
(Jackson 2016b).

The Texas Revolution, which began in October 1835 and ended on April 21, 1836 at the battle of San
Jacinto, did little to dissuade settlement in southeast Texas (Barker and Pohl 2016). The battle and
advancing Mexican military would cause families and homesteaders to abandon their homes
temporarily but only to repopulate quickly after the threat passed. Germans, Polish, and Czechs were
a significant part of the influx of immigrants to Texas; however, the immigrants that would have the
greatest effect on the population and culture of Texas were those from the lower States, whose cotton
plantation-based economy helped incorporate Grimes and nearby Harris, and Waller Counties into the
antebellum culture of the Deep South (Campbell 2016). By 1850, slaves would make up 50 percent of
the population and the crops and money they produced would affect the economy and local
government significantly (Christian and Leffler 2016; Holbrook 1970; Jackson 2016a).
From the Texas Revolution to the eve of the Civil War, Texas saw a shift from a frontier life of
raising cattle, sheep, and oxen to that of major agricultural production. By 1860, corn and cotton were
the primary crops in Grimes County. The livestock economy, though diminished, increased over 275
percent in value. The number of slaves in Grimes, Harris, and Waller Counties continued to grow in
the last decade leading up to the Civil War (Christian and Leffler 2016; Henson 2016; Jackson
2016a), particularly in Grimes County, where slaves made up 53 percent of the population (Jackson
2016a).
In the late 1850s, railroads such as the Houston and Texas Central, which served to expand the
economy, also transported soldiers and supplies during the Civil War. The antebellum culture that
dominated Texas particularly with a reliance on slaves for agriculture made secession from the United
States an easy decision (Campbell 2016; Jackson 2016a). During the war, the area saw an influx of
immigration from Southern farmers seeking refuge from the war, bringing with them their property
and slaves. The defeat of the Confederacy in the Civil War in 1865 and the emancipation of slaves
brought slow recovery to the area as the economy struggled to support itself on a foundation formerly
built on slave labor. Epidemics of cholera and yellow fever contributed to the slow recovery and
added to the hostilities toward recently freed slaves. To help facilitate the emancipation, the
Freedman’s Bureau was established to oversee legal contracts and protect emancipated slaves from
exploitation and violence (Jackson 2016a). Their efforts were in vain as violence and homicide
toward the freed group continued to grow.
In April of 1868 in Navasota, the Ku Klux Klan emerged as a vigilante effort against AfricanAmericans. In response, the Loyal League was formed, serving as a means to better organize and
protect against the violence of the Ku Klux Klan. The size of the African-American population in
Grimes and Waller Counties assured Republican support in local government until the establishment
of the White Man’s Union in 1898, which used intimidation to keep African-American and other
minorities from the polls (Christian and Leffler 2016; Jackson 2016a; Long 2016). The hostile tactics
caused a massive migration from the area and temporarily crippled the economy, allowing for a
growing Hispanic population to take jobs that were otherwise occupied by African-Americans (Long
2016). The continuing immigration of Germans, Czechs, Polish, French, and other European and
Asian nationalities helped to diversify the area culturally as small enclaves established themselves
such as the German settlement of Rodolph, north of Anderson in Grimes County (Jackson 2016a).
Recovery after the Civil War was slow and violent, and the economy did not reach its pre-civil war
levels until the twentieth century (Jackson 2016a). A shift away from agriculture is seen in Grimes
and Waller Counties, as the early part of the twentieth century saw a steady decline in the cotton
industry (Christian and Leffler 2016; Jackson 2016a). The growing urban economy along with
periods of economic hardship contributed to the steady decrease in population from Grimes County.
The Great Depression in the 1930s caused an over 16 percent decrease in the population of Grimes
County (Jackson 2016a). Of the 15 manufacturing companies that existed in the county, only six
companies survived the Depression (Jackson 2016a). The discovery of oil in 1934 in Waller County

helped to diversify the economy and provide jobs to the dwindling working class in the area
(Christian and Leffler 2016).
Farming in Waller County during and after World War II turned to ranching and rice agriculture, and
the number of farms in Grimes County dropped, shifting into lumber and diversifying into cane,
sorghum, pecans, and vegetables like potatoes and soybeans (Christian and Leffler 2016; Jackson
2016a). Oil was not discovered in Grimes County until 1954. Despite the discovery, the population
continued to decline until the 1970s, after which the oil industry in the area expanded during the
1980s (Jackson 2016a).

Previous Investigations

During the preparation of an environmental assessment and routing study for the proposed BVC
transmission line, POWER (2015) obtained historical and archeological site location data from the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL). Prior to the archeological survey, POWER also
obtained updated files for the TMPA project area from TARL dated February 16, 2016. POWER also
consulted the THC Texas Historical Sites Atlas (THSA), THC Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
(TASA), Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) historical bridge data, and the National Park
Service in February and March 2016 to identify the locations and descriptions of previously
documented cultural resources within one mile of the project area.
Based on the review, the bulk of the proposed ROW was surveyed for archeological sites in 1977, and
the southern extreme of the ROW was surveyed in 1991 (Figures 2 and 3). As a result of these and
other surveys near the project area, 15 archeological sites have been recorded within one mile of the
project area. One site, 41GM66, is mapped as adjacent to the transmission line. Site 41GM66 was
recorded in 1976 as historic structure footings and an associated scatter of glass and ceramics that was
described as “very disturbed.” The additional sites within one mile of the project area are briefly
described in Table 1. These include six prehistoric lithic scatters, six prehistoric campsites, one
prehistoric scatter of debitage and ceramics, and an historic house site with the remains of a chimney
and foundation piers and associated scatter of ceramics and glass.

RESEARCH DESIGN

To comply with the Antiquities Code of Texas, portions of the proposed transmission line on stateowned lands were surveyed for cultural resources. The objective of the survey was to identify
prehistoric and historic cultural resources within the project area that could be adversely affected by
the construction of the transmission line, and, to the extent possible based on survey-level data, assess
the potential of such resources for designation as State Antiquities Landmarks or for listing on the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Survey methods followed the Archeological Survey
Standards for Texas established by the THC along a single transect. The entirety of the survey
corridor on state-owned land was pedestrian-surveyed in an effort to identify surface scatters and
aboveground non-archeological cultural resources. Shovel testing was conducted in areas that did not
show clear evidence of heavy disturbances. All soil matrices were sifted through 6.3-millimeters (¼­
inch) mesh hardware cloth unless the matrix was dominated by clay. Clayey matrix was finely
divided by hand and visually inspected.
The location, maximum depth, and a description of the soil strata were recorded on standardized
shovel test logs. For each stratum, the color, thickness, texture, and the presence or absence of
cultural materials was recorded. A no-collection strategy was proposed for the survey, with the
provenience (site, shovel test number, level, depth and description) of any artifacts recovered in
shovel tests or observed on the surface recorded in the field and photographed. With the approval of
the TMPA, rare or unusual cultural materials would be collected and held-in-trust at TARL.
Cultural resource location information near the project area was obtained from TARL on February 16,
2016, to determine whether previously recorded cultural resources existed near the project area.
Surface and subsurface surveys were performed April 12, 2016 by three POWER archeologists. The
Principal Investigator for the project, Darren Schubert, M.A., RPA, meets the U.S. Secretary of the
Interior’s Professional Qualification Standards for Archeology (48 FR 22716 or CFR Part 61). The
surveys were performed in partial fulfilment of Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7609, issued in April,
2016.

RESULTS

A review of the TASA database indicated that one previously recorded archeological site, 41GM66,
is adjacent to the project area. No artifacts or features were expressed at the ground surface within the
proposed ROW during the pedestrian survey or identified during the shovel testing near the
previously recorded site or elsewhere in the project area. Ground surface visibility ranged from less
than thirty percent in forested areas in the southern extent of the project area, to 100 percent on
eroded hilltops east of the existing power plant (Figures 3 and 4). Disturbances observed in the
proposed ROW include the removal of soils near the power plant and site 41GM66 (Figure 5), and
mining between the power plant and Gibbons Creek Lake, as depicted on the topographic map and
visible in the field as grassy hummocky areas with mixed soils. Seventeen negative shovel tests were
excavated to an average depth of 40 centimeters below the surface. Heavily disturbed areas between
the power plant and railroad tracks at the northern end of the project area and eroded, disturbed
hilltops with excellent ground surface visibility were not shovel tested during the survey, resulting in
fewer shovel tests than stipulated by the Archeological Survey Standards for Texas established by the
THC. The shovel test locations are plotted in Figure 6, and Table 2 summarizes the soils encountered
during shovel testing.

RECOMMENDATIONS

POWER archeologists performed an intensive archeological survey of approximately 14.8 acres of
proposed transmission line on TMPA property in Grimes County, Texas. No cultural resources were
recorded during the survey of the proposed ROW. Much of the proposed transmission line on ROW
TMPA property has been disturbed by the removal of soils and levelling during the construction of a
nearby power plant and features associated with the power plant, and surface mining. Due to the lack
of cultural materials in the project area, POWER recommends that construction activities within the
project area be allowed to proceed without further consultation. If, during construction of the
transmission line, and access road, cultural resources are encountered, all activities at the location
should be halted until the THC is notified and an appropriate course of action is determined. POWER
offers this report in partial fulfillment of Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7609.
