MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT
The unusual amount of rain that we have
received this year throughout Texas has
been overdue and overdone; but greatly appreciated and needed. However, it has
changed many of our plans, more than a few
times. The Sprague site, like any that are
near a river or creek has been flooded numerous times in the past few months. TCAS
has had plans to expand our scope of activities out there, all have been postponed, but
hopefully we will be able to get back to work
soon. Thanks to Carol Macaulay, Brian Jameson and an outstanding
crew of Baylor students, some very unique and important features
have been recorded in Area D. Multiple shell middens, hearths, lithic
reduction station and a tool making area have been uncovered; all at
the same level and general proximity. Clearly, we have more work to
do there; we will be returning soon, but first must get some backhoe
work done, site preparation and new units laid out.

I would also like to thank a few of other members, Mickey Miller,
David Opper and Glynn Osburn. Mickey gave us a very informative
and professional presentation last month at our July meeting. We
have mostly professional speakers at our meetings; but I find it espe12
cially gratifying when one of our own members can make a profes28-30
sional presentation too. David took on the daunting task of being
12-13
our newsletter editor this year and I think we can all agree that he is
doing a wonderful job. David, like all of our past editors is always
25-29
looking for something written by our members to include in our publication. So far this year we have had a few submitted. Recently two
1-30
good articles were written by both Glynn - on Understanding ArcheoJune
logical Classifications ( I saved that one for my Field book); and most
9-16
recently by David with a humorous recap of his experience of being a
11
crew chief for the first time this year at TAS Field School. As menJuly 9tioned at our last meeting we would really like hear from any of our
27
members on any of your archeological specialties, events or outings,
even if only by some photos that you took and a small caption on
13
each of them.
Oct.
Lastly, I want to remind everyone that the TAS Annual Meeting in San 26-28
26Antonio on October 26-28th. Please plan on attending this year; if
28
you have never been before, you’re missing out on one of the best
events to keep you abreast of Texas Archeology.
Hope you are having a wonderful summer.

A new tas website

TAS PRESIDENT CAROLYN SPOCK TAKES US ON A TOUR
Co-Webmaster Butch Fralia moved online the TAS website
that has been under development for about a year and a
half. It has a new look and a new organization, though essentially all that was there previously is still there.
Navigation should be much easier on the website now. The
top menu has drop-down menu items that will, in some
cases, take you directly to the page you seek. Where there
are multiple pages in an area (true in a number of cases,
such as with the various TAS activities), each area's home
page will have a supplemental menu in a textured box that
will move you to a destination in the next level of pages.
That textured menu box will be at the top of each of the
area's pages, allowing you to move around in that venue.
There is also a site map to help you navigate the new pathways. It would probably be a good idea to remove old bookmarks and start setting up new links. An intercept page has
been provided that should redirect users of out-of-date links
to the new TAS Home page.
The new site has some new interactive areas.
<>Still under development (though portions are active) is
the Members Area linked from the Home page. This area is
accessible through a password login. Information about TAS
business may be found here, and you may make changes to
your personal profile, updating addresses and contact information. TAS members must register here and be accepted
before they can enter this section. A caveat: one of the administrators with a current membership list must approve
the applicant, so please do not expect acceptance to be
immediate. This function is new to all of us.
<> Already available is a redesigned, database calendar.
Registered members may log in and post/update items to
the list. Members may only work on their own submissions;
administrators may work on everyone's submissions. As the
date of an event passes, the item is removed from the viewable calendar.
<> A Whatzit page has been discussed but not yet implemented. The current system of submitting items to Bob for
posting to the Listserv will continue.
<> Also a treat to come is a section on artifacts, based on
documentation published in the TAS Bulletin. Some contributions in this section will be there with the stipulation that
they be available ONLY to members.

And, the site boasts some new additions.
<> Curricula for each of the Academies has been added;
this should help readers gauge what each course contains.
An archive of previous Academy information is online, as are
most of the reports that were generated from the Archeology 101 courses.
<> An archive of previous Field School information is also
online, as well as some new information intended to help
newcomers find out what to expect at Field School. There is
a page of generic camp rules; currently on that page are
lists of items one should bring to Field School -- field and
camp equipment. There will be photographs of some of the
equipment posted later.
<> Annual Meeting also sports archives from previous years
-- of course, everyone should be looking at the information
for this year and planning to attend the meeting at the
Menger Hotel. Registration may be done online.
<> There is a section for each of the committees. At this
time the committee description in the Bylaws is the primary
component.
<> There is a spot for each region, and a place for a profile
and picture of the Regional Director.
<> Scholarships and Grants are now in the top level of
menus.
<> A page on recording collections links to the THC's PDF of
their brochure.
<> There is a new section that Pam has supplied that provides press releases on upcoming events for the media.
<> A FAQ page is up but still being developed.
<> A glossary page will be prepared.
<> There is the Site Map that was mentioned above.
When you get a chance, please check out the revised TAS
website. We think you will like it. Of course, suggestions for
new items or modifications are always welcomed!

2007 PECOS CONFERENCE
Deliberately informal, the Pecos Conference affords Southwestern archaeologists a
superlative opportunity to talk with one another, both by presenting field reports and
by casual discussions. It is a chance to see old friends, meet new ones, pick up fresh
information, organize future conferences, and have a great time.
The tradition of research collaboration and sharing that began in 1927 at Pecos Pueblo
returns to its home at Pecos National Historical Park, under the guidance of dedicated
archaeologists, Federal, state and local agency sponsors, and tribal representatives...

This year, 2007, marks the 80th anniversary of the Pecos Conference, first convened by
Alfred V. Kidder at Pecos Pueblo, New Mexico, in 1927. Because the Conference was
not held during certain years (due to World War II and other circumstances [cf. * Woodbury 1993]), this year’s meeting will not be the 80th annual gathering. This year is, in
fact, the 70th annual meeting of the Pecos Conference. In the early 1990s, the numbering of the Pecos Conference became confused, when the anniversary year was substituted for the actual count of prior conferences. Clearly, we cannot mend past problems
with the numbering of the Pecos Conference. Our solution is to indicate that this year’s
conference will be the 70th occurrence and refer formally to this year’s event simply as
the Pecos Conference 2007.

DEBITAGE

noun: lithic debris and discards found at the sites where stone tools and weapons were made.
From HARRY SHAFER

The TAS meeting in San Antonio may end up to be all party and no papers. I have
received only three paper abstracts thus far and no symposia. Submission for symposia deadline is August 15. Get going folks, and send me your abstracts. Otherwise
you will have to put up with Elton dressed as Devine in Hairspray.

Texas Archaeologist Jay Blaine Given SAA Crabtree Award Allen archeologist Jay
Blaine turned a hobby into a profession that has gained him ntional recognition, he was
presented with the Society for American Archaeology's Crabtree Award for his services
to the archaeological communities. "There were thousands of people there from everywhere," Blaine said, "I was tickled to death, because this was the first plaque I had gotten. There it was a piece of wood with all that stuff on it."

From Katrina Nuncio

The August 2007 issue of National Geographic Magazine has a 41 page article / pictures
that is titled "Maya, How a Great Culture Rose and Fell." There is also one of those wonderful map supplements of Mexico and Central America in this issue that should be a great
item to have.
I have not had time as yet to read the article, but the photography and maps alone are
worth the purchase price of the magazine if you are interested in Mesoamerica.

IN THE NEWS
A LINK BETWEEN THE ANASAZI AND CLIMATE WARMING?
Weekend Edition Sunday, July 29, 2007 · As modern officials try to
assess the risk global warming might present to the American
Southwest, they're paying a lot of attention to what scientists say
about how climate changes affected the region's ancient past.
Archaeologist Kristen Kuckelman has spent many years digging in
the ruins of ancient farming villages on the Colorado Plateau and
analyzing the artifacts and specimens she takes from them.
The people who lived in these ancient villages, which are known as
pueblos, were part of a large culture that thrived for several hundred
years in the high desert plain that covers parts of modern Utah, New
Mexico, Colorado and Arizona. Archaeologists call them Anasazi, or
Ancient Pueblo People. One of the best known of their pueblos is in
Mesa Verde National Park in Colorado.
But sometime in the late 1200s, the Anasazi abandoned all of their
pueblos. And for more than a hundred years, archaeologists have
been perplexed about why.
Kuckelman thinks she may have found the answer. "I think we're
finally really making some important inroads into answering that
question," says Kuckelman, who works for Crow Canyon, a nonprofit
archaeological center in southwestern Colorado. "It had to have
been a pretty important reason (for them) to leave and never come
back."
Kuckelman thinks the reason was climate change. A major drought
hit the area in the 1270s. Kuckelman says her research from one of
the villages, Sand Canyon Pueblo, shows that the drought destroyed
the people's ability to grow corn to feed themselves and their turkey
flocks. They were forced to revert to hunting and gathering.
She figured this out by analyzing their garbage. She compared refuse from the early days of the settlement to what was left in the
kivas when the residents moved away.
"I wasn't particularly looking for anything," Kuckelman says. "At some
point, it just sort of jumped out of the data at me."
It was turkey bones, lots of them.
"The percentage of turkey bones is 96 percent of the identified animal bones — 96 percent! That's huge," Kuckelman exclaims.
But of the bones left over from the final days of the pueblo, only 13
percent were from turkeys. Most were from wild game.
"That can't be accidental," she says. "It has to mean something. And
what it means is, when they first moved here, they were eating primarily turkey. And at they very end they weren't. So why?"
This and other evidence convinced Kuckelman that the corn crops
that fed the ancient farmers and their turkeys failed because of the
drought..
She believes other villages' corn crops failed, too. There wasn't
enough wild food to go around, so people were hungry, and that led
to violence.
Kuckelman puts it simply: "The system fell apart."
Kristen Kuckelman couldn't have come up with her theory if it weren't for the work of scientists who study the growth rings of trees. The
rings reveal important secrets about the distant past, such as when
kivas were built, and when the great drought hit. That information
enabled Kuckelman to link the collapse of the pueblo's crops and
turkey flocks to the Great Drought of the 1270s.

A few hundred miles northeast of where Kuckelman is digging, University of Arizona Climate Science Professor Connie Woodhouse was
doing her summer field work, high in the Rocky Mountains.
Her team uses a chainsaw to cut slices of the remnants of old dead
trees to take back to the lab for analysis.
To sample live trees, Woodhouse drills into one with a hand tool,
called a tree borer, and extracts a sample of the tree's rings the size
and shape of a drinking straw. It shows distinct sections, each of
which holds information about the past.
"The wide rings are wet years and the narrow rings are dry years,"
Woodhouse says, "And when you put together the information from
the tree rings into what we called the tree ring chronology, it gives
you a picture of the moisture in that area where we collected it."
Woodhouse and her colleagues recently presented an alarming picture of the ancient history of the Colorado River. They sampled the
oldest trees they could find — dead and alive — and used them to
estimate stream flows all the way back to the year 762. Their results
show that the droughts over the last hundred years weren't as severe or as long as earlier droughts. And in fact, the first part of the
20th century was unusually wet.
"Not only was it wet in the context of 100 years, but there was not a
wet period like that for at least 400 years," Woodhouse says.
That has major ramifications for modern people who rely on the
Colorado River for water. The laws that are used to divvy up the river
assume that the extremely wet period was normal.
Woodhouse says the lesson from the tree rings is that longer dry
spells, like the one that chased the pueblo farmers from their villages, could return.
Some experts believe they already have.
Eric Kuhn, the chief water manager for western Colorado, says the
rivers are flowing at only 70 percent of their normal rate. Other tributaries of the Colorado are flowing at only 40 percent.
It is the seventh dry year the river has had in the past eight years.
"The water community is all hoping that this is a drought," Kuhn
says. "Drought implies things will return to normal someday."
But he doesn't think they will. Kuhn believes the lower river levels
over the last several years represent a new, drier normal. And because of climate change, he expects the river to become even drier
in the future.
With that in mind, Kuhn thinks that the tens of millions of people
who rely on the Colorado River to irrigate their fields, water their
lawns and fill their bathtubs, should take the experiences of the
ancient pueblo farmers seriously.
"They obviously didn't have our technology. They didn't have Hoover
Dam and Glen Canyon Dam. And when there was a change in the
climate, they could not adapt to it," he says.
Kuhn notes that while modern society has a lot of technology, it also
has a thirst for the Colorado that is greater than its supply. He believes that what happened to the ancients could still happen today.
"We're used to a certain amount of water," he says. "If that changes
just a little bit, it's going to cause some big disruptions in how we
deal with life here in the southwest."
