ABSTRACT
On behalf of Medallion Delaware Basin, LLC (MDB), SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA)
conducted an intensive archaeological survey of portions of three parcels in Loving County owned by the
Texas A&M University (TAMU) System that will be affected by the proposed MDB Project. MDB is in
the process of establishing a gathering system consisting of approximately 55 miles of existing and
proposed pipelines and associated ancillary facilities within the Delaware Basin portion of the Permian
Basin. A combined total of approximately 1.65 miles across three parcels owned by the TAMU System will
be affected by the proposed undertaking. As the undertaking will be located on TAMU System Lands,
investigations were conducted in accordance with the requirements of the Antiquities Code of Texas under
Texas Antiquities Permit 7514.
The background literature review revealed that no portion of the project area on TAMU System lands has
been previously surveyed for cultural resources and no previously recorded archaeological sites, cemeteries,
or historic features are located within or immediately adjacent to the project area. Additionally, no
previously conducted cultural resources surveys or recorded archaeological sites were located within 1 mile
of the project areas.
Investigations of portions of the three parcels owned by the TAMU System involved an intensive pedestrian
survey augmented by shovel testing of approximately 1.65 miles (19 acres). During the survey, a total of
29 shovel tests were excavated. No cultural materials were observed on the ground surface or any of the
shovel tests.
Based on the negative results of the survey and previous disturbances within portions of the three subject
properties, it is SWCA’s opinion that no cultural resources will be affected by any construction activities
within the project area. SWCA therefore recommends that no further archaeological investigations of the
affected portions of the three subject properties. No artifacts were collected; project paperwork and
photographs will be curated per the requirements of the Antiquities Code of Texas.

approximately 1.65 miles of the proposed Delaware Basin Gathering System on three parcels of land owned
by the TAMU System within Loving County, Texas. The project will be constructed within a typical 70foot-wide corridor and will consist of 30-foot-wide 10-year-termed easement which will include the
installation of 6- and 8-inch diameter pipelines, an aerial power line, and access road, and a 40-foot-wide
temporary construction easement. The anticipated depth of project impact is estimated at 5-6 feet below
surface.
Location. Parcel 1 is located along the eastern bank of the Pecos River approximately 5.95 miles northeast
of Orla, Texas, and approximately 2.45 miles southeast of the intersection of State Highway 652 and the
Pecos River. Parcel 2 is located along the eastern bank of the Pecos River, approximately 6 miles northeast
of Orla, Texas, and approximately 0.5 miles southeast of State Highway 652 before it crosses the Pecos
River from Loving to Reeves County, Texas. Parcel 3 is located approximately 7 miles northeast of Orla,
Texas, and approximately 3.5 miles east of the crossing of State Highway 652 and the Pecos River.
Number of Acres Surveyed. Approximately 19 acres were surveyed.
Principal Investigator. Antonio E. Padilla
Purpose of Work. As the proposed undertaking will be located on TAMU System lands, investigations
were conducted in accordance with the requirements of the Antiquities Code of Texas under Texas
Antiquities Permit 7514.
Number of Sites. None.
Curation. No artifacts were collected, thus nothing will be curated except project paperwork and
photographs, as per the requirements of the Antiquities Code of Texas.
Comments. Based on the negative results of the survey and previous disturbances within portions of the
three subject properties, it is SWCA’s opinion that no cultural resources will be affected by any construction
activities within the project area. SWCA therefore recommends that no further archaeological investigations
of the affected portions of the three subject properties. No artifacts were collected; project paperwork and
photographs will be curated per the requirements of the Antiquities Code of Texas.

INTRODUCTION
On behalf of Medallion Delaware Basin, LLC (MDB), SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA)
conducted an intensive archaeological survey of portions of three parcels in Loving County owned by the
Texas A&M University (TAMU) System that will be affected by the proposed MDB Project (Figure 1).
MDB is in the process of establishing a gathering system consisting of approximately 55 miles of existing
and proposed pipelines and associated ancillary facilities within the Delaware Basin portion of the Permian
Basin. A combined total of approximately 1.65 miles across the three parcels owned by the TAMU System
will be affected by the proposed undertaking.
The proposed project will be constructed within MDB’s 10-year-termed easement on parcels owned by the
TAMU System, totaling approximately 19 acres in Loving County. As the undertaking will be located on
state-owned University Lands, cultural resources investigations were conducted to satisfy the requirements
of the Antiquities Code of Texas under Texas Antiquities Permit 7514.
The purpose of the work was to locate and identify all prehistoric and historic archaeological sites within
the two project areas, establish vertical and horizontal site boundaries as appropriate with regard to the
project areas, and evaluate the significance and eligibility of any site recorded within the property. Patricia
Neuhoff and Robert Brush conducted the fieldwork on January 5–7, 2016.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
MDB proposes to construct a combined total of approximately 1.65 miles of the proposed Delaware Basin
Gathering System on three parcels of land owned by the TAMU System within Loving County, Texas. The
project will be constructed within a typical 70-foot-wide corridor and will consist of 30-foot-wide 10-yeartermed easement which will include the installation of 6- and 8-inch diameter pipelines, an aerial power
line, and access road, and a 40-foot-wide temporary construction easement. The anticipated depth of project
impact is estimated at 5-6 feet below surface.
Approximately 0.3 miles (3.14 acres) of the project will occur within Parcel 1, located along the eastern
bank of the Pecos River approximately 5.95 miles northeast of Orla, Texas, and approximately 2.45 miles
southeast of the intersection of State Highway 652 and the Pecos River (see Figure 1). Within Parcel 2,
located along the eastern bank of the Pecos River, approximately 6 miles northeast of Orla, Texas, and
approximately 0.5 miles southeast of State Highway 652 before it crosses the Pecos River from Loving
to Reeves County, Texas, approximately 1.3 miles (15.75 acres) will be constructed within TAMU lands
(see Figure 1). The remaining 0.06 miles (0.12 acres) of the proposed project will be located in Parcel 3
which is located approximately 7 miles northeast of Orla, Texas, and approximately 3.5 miles east of the
crossing of State Highway 652 and the Pecos River (see Figure 1). The project areas are situated within
areas marked by intensive oil and gas exploration.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project areas are situated within the Chiuahuan Basin and Playas ecoregion. This ecoregion includes
river valleys, internally drained basins, and alluvial fans below an elevation of 3,500 feet. The formation
occurred during an event called the Basin and Range tectonism, where the Earth’s crust stretched causing
a fault collapse (Griffith and Omernik 2016). From this event, basins were formed and through time have
filled with saline or alkaline soil. This region is the hottest and most arid region in Texas, and as a result,
agricultural activity is limited (Griffith and Omernik 2016).

Geology
Given the nature of the formation of the area, the underlying geological formation of the project area is
comprised of Holocene-aged terrace deposits (Parcels 1and 2) and sand sheet deposits (Parcel 3). These
deposits consist of areas of large dunes from windblown sands comprised of predominately sand intermixed
with silt. Typical depths of the deposits are undetermined and are characterized as having a shallow
watertable with soils that are moderate to very high permeability and have a low to moderate water holding
capacity (Barnes 1992).

Soils
Soils of Parcel 1 are comprised of Monahans-Pajarito complex soils. Monahans and Pajarito series are
comprised of coarse-loamy soils that are very deep and well-drained. Monahans soils are commonly found
undulating upland plains and fan skirts and are derived from calcium carbonate and gypsum-mixed ancient
alluvium (Natural Resources Conservation Service [NRCS] 2016). Pajarito series soils are located in
bajadas, plains, and alluvial fans and are derived from mixed sandy sediments (NRCS 2016). Depths of the
soils of the Monahans-Pajarito complex range from 152 to 165 cmbs
Soils of Parcel 2 include Harkey-Patrole association and Holloman-Reeves complex soils. Harkey and
Patrole series soils are characterized as well-drained, very deep soils (NRCS 2016). Harkey soils are derived
from sedimentary material and formed within a mix of alluvium and calcareous sediments. These soils are
commonly encountered along stream terraces and within floodplains. Patrole soils are commonly found on
level floodplains and are derived from stratified silt underlain by clay alluvium. Depths of soils of the
Harkey-Patrole association range from 177 to 203 cmbs (NRCS 2016).
The Holloman-Reeves complex is comprised of the Holloman series and Reeves series soils. Holloman
series soils are characterized as well-drained, moderately permeable soils that are typically found adjacent
to terraces, basins, or valley floors. These soils are derived from loamy, gypsiferous, and calcareous
sediments and are considered shallow to very shallow (NRCS 2016). Reeves series are characterized as
fine-loamy soils formed in calcareous and gypsiferous alluvium, that are well-drained and very deep. These
soils are typically encountered along basin floors, plateaus, or on hillslopes (NRCS 2016). Depths of soils
of the Holloman-Reeves association vary from 152 to 200 cmbs and are often intermixed or underlain by
gypsum.
Soils of Parcel 3 consist of Wickett-Sharvana complex soils. Wickett series and Sharvana are well-drained
loamy to sandy loamy soils typical of desert grasslands (NRCS 2016). Wickett soils are moderately deep
soils derived from windblown sand and loam. These soils are commonly encountered on level to gently
sloping uplands. Sharvana soils are well-drained soils derived from windblown deposits from the
Pleistocene-aged Blackwater Draw Formation. Wickett-Sharvana complex soils reach a depth of 203 cmbs
(NRCS 2016).

CULTURAL CONTEXT
The project area is located within Delaware Basin portion of the Permian Basin of the Southern High Plains
(Llano Estacado) archeological region, which lies immediately to the east of the Pecos River, a
physiographic dividing line of the Trans-Pecos and the Southern High plains archaeological regions
(Perttula 2004; Turner and Hester 1999). Both archaeological regions have been extensively researched and
comprehensive chronological sequences have been established for these regions (Turner and Hester 1999).
According to research conducted at archaeological sites in both regions, evidence of human occupation in
the regions roughly spans 12,000 years before present (B.P.) (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004; Johnson and
Holliday 2004). These 12,000 years of occupation are typically divided into four main periods based on
technological and cultural changes seen throughout the archaeological record. These four main periods are
as follows: the Paleoindian (12,000/11,500–8500/8000 B.P.); the Archaic (8500/8000–2000 B.P.); the Late
Prehistoric (2000/1500 B.P.–1650 A.D.); and the Historic (A.D. 1650–1950s) (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004;
Johnson and Holliday 2004). The following is a general overview of trends seen during each period,
followed by a discussion of what occurred in the Southern High Plains and the Tran-Pecos regions.

Paleoindian Period
The Paleoindian Period was commonly characterized throughout Texas by nomadic big-game hunters who
heavily relied on megafauna of the Pleistocene (e.g., mammoth, mastodon, bison, camel, and horse) for
subsistence (sensu Willey 1966). However, a more accurate description of this stage is presented by
Bousman et al. (1990:22): “…this period may have seen use by small, mobile bands of nonspecialized
hunters and gathers occasionally utilizing megafauna perhaps only as the opportunity arose.” Thus,
according to Bousman et al. (1990), Paleoindians used a wider variety of resources than previously thought.
Evidence of this broader resource subsistence is based on the works of Johnson (1977), Collins (1998:1505–
1506), and Collins and Brown (2000). Johnson (1977) reviewed reports on numerous Paleoindian sites that
indicated a range of small and medium fauna were harvested in addition to big game. Investigations at the
Wilson-Leonard site (41WM235), the Gault site (41BL323), and Lubbock Lake (41LU1) provide evidence
of small and medium faunal remains (i.e., turtle, rabbit, squirrel, snakes, gopher, and deer) associated with
megafaunal remains (i.e., bison and mammoth) (Collins 1998:1505–1506). Clovis and Folsom points are
the primary diagnostic artifacts associated with this period (Turner and Hester 1999; Collins 2004).

Archaic Period
The Archaic stage signifies a shift from big-game hunting subsistence strategies to a less mobile, more
generalized subsistence strategy. This change in subsistence strategies shows a greater exploitation of local
environments with the exploitation of plants and animals located in the immediate vicinity. Along with the
change in subsistence practices a change is also seen in lithic technology. Evidence of this is apparent in
the archaeological record where lanceolate-shaped points gave way to dart points that were stemmed and
barbed and the application of groundstone (Black 1989; Collins 2004). Although Archaic peoples were still
nomadic in nature, traveling became seasonal, utilizing food resources specific to certain localities.

Late Prehistoric Period
The Late Prehistoric is marked by the replacement of the atlatal with the bow and arrow and by the
production of small arrow points (Hester 1981:122). With this technological advancement an apparent
increase in warfare is reported (Black 1989; Story 1985). During this stage new technological adaptations
came about. As previously mentioned, Late Prehistoric peoples began to use the bow and arrow; however

SWCA Environmental Consultants

Proposed Medallion Delaware Basin Project

this is not the only technological innovation of this time period. Ceramics and agriculture became an
important technological advancement in the lifeways of the Late Prehistoric peoples.

The Southern High Plains Region in Relation to the Cultural Chronology
Although a complete chronological sequence is well represented in the Southern High Plains region, it is
limited to the northern half of the Southern High Plains. Representation of archaeological sites in the
southern half of the Southern High Plains is generally scarce, and knowledge of prehistoric lifeways in this
area is incomplete. This is in part due to a lack of resources within the area. This lack of resources kept
populations low, therefore keeping sites to a minimum. A review of archaeological sites found in the region
revealed that the majority of sites are open campsites consisting of scatters of lithic debris on the surface or
are shallowly buried and burned rock features. Although these types of sites are commonly found
throughout Texas, they are easily disturbed by erosion and modern intrusion (Turner and Hester 1999).
Although the southern half of the Southern Plains region is lacking in long-term occupation sites and
quarries, the region does contain an important site dating to the Folsom period (10,800–10,300 B.P.). This
particular site, unearthed at Scharbauer Ranch in 1953, is known as the Midland Minnie Site (41MD1). The
Midland Minnie Site is one of the earliest sites known within this region. Investigation of the site revealed
the remains of what researchers believed to be a Folsom period (ca. 9000 B.P.) female buried with fossil
evidence of extinct mega-fauna (Leffler 2016).
As the Southern High Plains moved into the Archaic Period, the southern half of the Southern High Plains
entered a long altithermal phase that lasted around 4000 years (7000–3000 B.P.). The altithermal is
characterized as a period with a warmer and drier climate that ultimately leads to severe xeric conditions.
According to researchers, the altithermal phase resulted in the “decreased use, if not complete
abandonment” of the region (Johnson and Holliday 2004; Stafford 1981). Most sites recorded in the
Southern Panhandle Plains region date to the Middle Archaic through Late Prehistoric period, which reflects
a return to more mesic conditions, and an increase in population throughout Texas.

The Trans-Pecos Region in Relation to the Cultural Chronology
The Trans-Pecos region, much like the Southern High Plains contains well established chronological
sequence, however it encompasses a considerably more dynamic cultural environment than the southern
half of the Southern Plains around Midland/Odessa. The Trans-Pecos Region is characterized by its
numerous natural rock shelters that formed in limestone cliffs, abundant lithic material, and isolated microenvironments formed in mountain ranges or at springs. Limitations of accessibility between various
environments contributed to distinctive prehistoric site types (Turpin 1995). Prehistoric sites are often found
within natural rock shelters located in many of the limestone cliffs, which are ideal conditions for the
preservation of burned rock middens, organic materials, burials, and various types of rock art. Native
peoples utilized these rockshelters throughout all periods of prehistory well into the historic period.
Paleoindian sites in the Trans-Pecos occur rather infrequently. However those that are known are primarily
kill sites found in or near rock shelters where ancient peoples processed mega fauna such as bison, camel,
and bear (Turpin 1995). Other evidence of the existence of Paleoindian inhabitants comes from Paleoindian
tools or points found in isolated occurrences or points found within multicomponent scatters (Seebach
2001).
During the Archaic, habitation sites within rock shelters became more prevalent, along with rock art. The
Late Archaic (4000–1500 B.P.) is the best known period of the three for expansion into all available
ecological niches, and the use of specialized food processing earth ovens (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). In
the Late Archaic the more common site types in the Trans-Pecos are massive burned rock middens, used

Intensive Archaeological Survey of Portions of Texas A&M University System Lands in Loving County Affected by the
Proposed Medallion Delaware Basin Project

for large scale food processing. These middens are typically found exposed on mesa tops overlooking the
surrounding canyons and waterways.
During the Late Prehistoric, sites found in the Trans-Pecos region consisted of tipi rings, cairn burial sites,
rock shelter sites with pictographs and petroglyphs, and pit houses built on river and stream terraces. It was
during this time that the lifeways of the Late Prehistoric peoples changed, with the development of protoagriculture, use of the bow and arrow, and the manufacture of ceramics. Material culture associated with
this social organizational change includes Perdiz arrow points, flake drills, end and side scrapers, beveled
knife fragments, ground stone items, end-notched sinker stones, small bone and stone beads, tiny turquoise
beads, and a few Olivella shell beads.

Historic Euroamerican Settlement
Prior to the Civil War (1860–1865) there were very few Euroamerican settlers in West Texas. The few
settlers that were present were associated either with trading posts or military sites. The Civil War had little
immediate effect in the area. However, following the Civil War period there was renewed interest in
establishing settlements in west Texas (see for example, Barton 1998; Freeman 1990a, b).
Early settlers met with strong resistance from the indigenous Comanche, Kiowa, and Kiowa-Apache, who
had occupied the area for between 200 and 500 years. According to Jim Cook, a former Comanche captive
living in Odessa in 1932, the Blue Mountain rockshelters were occupied by Comanches in the nineteenth
century (Odessa News-Times). In a series of battles of the 1870s, most notably the Red River War, the U.S.
Army forcibly removed the Native Americans to Oklahoma Territory. Following these events, the Llano
Estacado and Rolling Plains were settled rapidly. At the same time, the exploitation and ultimate
extermination of buffalo on the Plains in the 1870s was carried out in earnest (Anderson 1974), and the vast
grasslands were then further available for cattle ranching (Rathjen 1973).
The Permian Basin area was no exception. The Comanche Indians also ruled this part of west Texas until
1875. Because of good grasslands, most of the area was inviting to both ranchers and farmers. Since surface
water was almost nonexistent, wells were essential to sustain livestock and farms, and most settlement
occurred only after wells could be mechanically dug. When ranchers and farmers drilled water wells they
often found evidence of oil or gas. The first commercial oil well in the Permian Basin was completed in
1921 in Mitchell County, on the east side of the basin; completed at a total depth of 2,498 feet, it was the
discovery well of the Westbrook field. Early oil prospecting was started in southeastern New Mexico about
the same time as in West Texas.

METHODS
Background Review
SWCA conducted a background review to determine if the project area has been previously surveyed for
cultural resources or if any archaeological sites have been recorded within a 1-mile radius of the project
area. To conduct this review an SWCA archaeologist reviewed the Orla SE and Orla NE, Texas U.S.
Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle maps on the Texas Historical Commission’s
(THC) Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA). These sources provided information on the nature and
location of previously conducted archaeological surveys, previously recorded cultural resources, locations
of National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) properties, sites designated as State Antiquities Landmarks,
Official Texas Historical Markers (OTHMs), Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks, cemeteries, and local
neighborhood surveys. As a part of the review, an SWCA archaeologist reviewed the Texas Department of
Transportation (TxDOT) Historic Overlay, a mapping/geographic information system database with
historic maps and resource information covering most portions of the state (Foster et al. 2006).

Archaeological Survey
The field survey consisted of a team of two SWCA archaeologists walking a single transect within a 100foot-wide (roughly 30 m) survey corridor. Subsurface explorations to be used during the survey included
the excavation of shovel tests at a rate of 1 per 100 m along a single transect. SWCA keyed the utilization
of shovel tests to the level of disturbance of the proposed project area and the nature of the soils, geology,
and topography.
Shovel tests measured roughly 30 x 30 centimeters (cm) in size and were excavated in 20-cm arbitrary
levels to a depth of 1 m or to culturally sterile deposits, whichever came first. All excavated soil was
screened through ¼-inch mesh hardware cloth to retrieve any cultural materials that might be present. The
location of each shovel test was recorded using a Trimble GEO XT handheld global positioning system
(GPS) receiver. Data for each shovel test was recorded on appropriate field forms. Soils were described
utilizing standard terminology and colors were identified with a Munsell Soil Color Chart. Areas with
previously recorded or newly discovered cultural resources required additional shovel testing, per THC
standards, to explore the nature and extent of the cultural deposits. Photographs were also taken at each
location and were recorded on appropriate field forms.

RESULTS
Background Review
The background literature review revealed that no portion of the project area has been previously surveyed
for cultural resources and no previously recorded archaeological sites, cemeteries, or historic features are
located within or immediately adjacent to the project area. TASA records indicate that no previously
conducted cultural resources surveys or recorded archaeological sites were located within 1-mile of the
project area (TASA 2015).

Archaeological Survey
Investigations of portions of the three parcels owned by the TAMU System involved an intensive pedestrian
survey augmented by shovel testing of approximately 1.65 miles (19 acres). During the survey a combined
total of 29 shovel tests were excavated. No cultural materials were observed within the survey corridor and
no cultural materials were encountered within the shovel tests. Depths of shovel tests ranged from 30 cm
below surface to 100 cmbs and were terminated due to depth, caliche, or bedrock.

Of the proposed 1.65-mile project length, approximately 0.3 miles (3.15 acres) are located on Parcel 1. The
project area within Parcel 1 is located on the eastern bank of the Pecos River and is situated in an open field
intersected by various two-track roads and fence lines. Vegetation of the area consisted of mesquite, scrub
brush, and short grasses allowing for 10 percent surface visibility (Figure 2).
A total of 5 negative shovel tests (PN-2, PN-3, and RB-4–RB-6) were excavated within this segment (Figure
3). Shovel tests excavated within parcel 1 comprised of brown (7.5YR 5/4 and 5YR 4/4) sandy loam or
sandy clay loams. All shovel tests were excavated to a depth of 100 cmbs. No cultural materials were
encountered (Appendix A).

Parcel 2
Approximately 1.3 miles (15.75 acres) of the proposed undertaking is located on Parcel 2. Parcel 2 is located
on the eastern bank of the Pecos River, approximately 1 mile north of Parcel 1. The project area within the
parcel is situated within open field marked by sand dunes. Vegetation of the area consisted of mesquite,
scrub brush, and short grass, allowing for approximately 10 percent ground visibility (Figure 4). This
segment of the proposed pipeline is intersected and paralleled by various pipelines, transmission lines, and
road (Figure 5).

A total of 21 shovel tests (RB-10 thru RB-20, and PN-6 thru PN-15) were excavated within the project area
in Parcel 2 (Figure 6). Shovel tests were excavated and varied in depth from 30 to 100 cmbs, and all were
negative for cultural material (Appendix A). Shallow depths of the shovel tests were due to a distinct
landform adjacent to the survey corridor in the northern portion of the project area. Shovel tests along the
southern portion of the line near the Pecos River exhibited a pink to light brown (7.5YR 8/4 to 7.5YR 6/4)
sand, while shovel tests on the northwest/southeast trending portion of the line exhibited a reddish brown
to pink (5YR 5/4 to 5YR 8/4) sand with degraded caliche and sandstone. Shovel tests were terminated due
to depth and bedrock.

Parcel 3
The remaining 0.06 mile (0.12 acres) of the proposed project is located along the southeastern corner of
Parcel 3, located approximately 2 miles northeast of Parcel 2. The project area within Parcel 3 is situated
on an undulating plain with vegetation consisting of creosote and scrub brush, allowing for 50 percent
ground surface visibility (Figure 7). A total of three shovel tests were excavated, two within the
boundaries of the TAMU lands and one immediately south of the property, all negative for cultural
material. Shovel tests exhibited a reddish yellow (7.5YR 7/6) sand and were terminated at a depth of 50
cmbs due to bedrock (see Appendix A).

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On behalf of Medallion Delaware Basin, LLC (MDB), SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA)
conducted an intensive archaeological survey of portions of three parcels in Loving County owned by the
Texas A&M University (TAMU) System that will be affected by the proposed MDB Project. MDB is in
the process of establishing a gathering system consisting of approximately 55 miles of existing and
proposed pipelines and associated ancillary facilities within the Delaware Basin portion of the Permian
Basin. A combined total of approximately 1.65 miles across three parcels owned by the TAMU System will
be affected by the proposed undertaking. As the undertaking will be located on TAMU System Lands,
investigations were conducted in accordance with the requirements of the Antiquities Code of Texas under
Texas Antiquities Permit 7514.
The background literature review revealed that no portion of the project
surveyed for cultural resources and no previously recorded archaeological
features are located within or immediately adjacent to the project area.
conducted cultural resources surveys or recorded archaeological sites were
project areas.

areas have been previously
sites, cemeteries, or historic
Additionally, no previously
located within 1-mile of the

Investigations of portions of the three parcels owned by the TAMU System involved an intensive pedestrian
survey augmented by shovel testing of approximately 1.65 miles (19 acres). During the survey a combine
total of 29 shovel tests were excavated. No cultural materials were observed within the survey corridor and
no cultural materials were encountered within the shovel tests.
Based on the negative results of the survey and previous disturbances within portions of the three subject
properties, it is SWCA’s opinion that no cultural resources will be affected by any construction activities
within the project area. SWCA therefore recommends that no further archaeological investigations of the
affected portions of the three subject properties. No artifacts were collected; project paperwork and
photographs will be curated per the requirements of the Antiquities Code of Texas.
