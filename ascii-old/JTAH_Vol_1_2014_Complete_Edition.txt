FOREWORD TO VOLUME 1 (2014):
PUBLISHER’S REFLECTIONS
Every journey begins with a first step. The seed thought for this Journal germinated during lunch at
the Bob Bullock State History Museum barely a year ago. From that late November discussion with
Tim Perttula, we have traveled much farther and faster than ever imagined. The rough concept we
outlined that day has grown and matured rapidly. Today, we are putting the polishing touches on the
premier volume and readying it for publication.
As I pen these thoughts, it is a time to give thanks and reflect on one’s blessings for the year past. The
Journal of Texas Archeology and History could not have been possible without the generous
participation of many individuals who believe in our mission and purpose. Chief among these is our
editor-in-chief, Tim Perttula, who has invested a great deal of his time to ensure the quality and
accuracy of the Journal’s content. Supporting Tim is our outstanding editorial board, Steve Black,
Chris Lintz, Robert Z. Selden Jr., Frank de la Teja, Juliana Barr, and Todd Smith. These individuals
have provided expert editorial review services to make sure the peer review process has been solid and
seamless. Several subject matter experts also stepped up to add their expertise to the review process. It
is important to note for posterity that everyone involved with this effort contributed freely and
cheerfully their time and efforts to support this publication, indicating their commitment and
enthusiasm to the goals of this Journal: free, open access to digital publication of archeological and
historical research of the region.
Ranking highest on my list on this day of thanksgiving are the author Ranking highest on my list on
this day of thanksgiving are the authors who trusted us with the fruits of their labor at an untested,
unproven new publication. Researchers and writers pour their blood, sweat, and tears into their
works. It is no small thing that they entrusted us with its safekeeping. So, to the 11 courageous authors
of Volume 1, I salute you!
Finally, looking toward the future, we have already begun to assemble content for Volume 2. Based
on early indications, we will build on the success and quality of the premier volume in size, breadth of
coverage and concept of content. Beyond that, the Journal of Texas Archeology and History has
broad plans to publish several “Special Publications” of important themed materials from multiple
research groups and may offer Spanish and French versions as well. We hope to strengthen our ties
with researchers and writers in the surrounding states and northern Mexico. 2015 will be an
interesting and busy year at the Journal of Texas Archeology and History!

THE IMPORTANCE OF SHRUBLAND AND GRASSLAND
PLANT COMMUNITIES TO THE DIET OF THE LATE
PREHISTORIC (A.D. 900-1535) HUNTER-GATHERERS
OF THE EASTERN TRANS-PECOS REGION OF TEXAS
Casey W. Riggs

ABSTRACT
The Eastern Trans-Pecos archeological region of Texas is an area rich in
botanical diversity, a resource heavily utilized by both prehistoric and historic
hunter-gatherers. A comparison of four paleoethnobotanical investigations of
archeological sites dating to the Late Prehistoric Era (A.D. 900-1535) with
ethnobotanical information of the Mescalero Apache reveal that the botanical
component of prehistoric and historic diets have been similar for the past
1,000 years. Differences in the degree of similarity can be contributed to
differential preservation and analytical techniques. Further, ecological sites
from the Ecological Site Information System are demonstrated as a novel and
useful tool for landscape-scale archeological analysis.

INTRODUCTION
This study examines the use of locally available plant food species at four Late Prehistoric Era
(A.D. 900-1535) hunter-gatherer and forager-farmer sites in the Eastern Trans-Pecos archaeological
region of Texas (Figure 1). The overarching objective of this study is to understand how Late
Prehistoric hunter-gatherers utilized local landscapes for the botanical portion of their diet, specifically
the kinds of plants consumed, and not necessarily the importance of a given taxa nor the primary
foods consumed, processed, or stored at a given archeological site. With such subsistence related data
available future studies can be expanded to examine seasonal dietary variation as well as changes in
subsistence patterns, logistical strategies, and socio-cultural identities through time.
To identify potential food resources of Late Prehistoric peoples in the Eastern Trans-Pecos this
study compares archeologically encountered plant foods to the ethnographically described diet of the
Mescalero Apache. This comparison is undertaken at a site specific level through data extraction from
an ecological spatial model. Data for this model were generated in a geographic information system
via the Ecological Site Description system developed by the United States Department of AgricultureNatural Resource Conservation Service (USDA-NRCS) in tandem with the United States Department

al. 2013).
The results demonstrate that there is a dramatic overlap between historic and prehistoric plant
diet with only two ethnographically confirmed dietary outliers within the archeological record. Here a
dietary outlier is considered plant taxa used for food by Late Prehistoric peoples but not by the
Mescalero Apache. The Mescalero Apache show a more varied diet, although this discrepancy is
likely the result of preservation bias as well as a lack of microbotanical analyses within the Eastern
Trans-Pecos. Finally this project’s utilization of a novel spatial ecological model, the USDA-NRCS
Ecological Site Description system, for archeological inquiry demonstrates the utility of this model for
related landscape level archeological investigations.

ECOLOGICAL AND ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
The Eastern Trans-Pecos archeological region (see Figure 1) constitutes a large portion of the
northeastern Chihuahuan Desert eco-region, and as such is an arid to semi-arid area with a bimodal
precipitation regime (Hoyt 2000; Pronatura Noreste et al. 2004). Climatically the study area has cool
dry winters and warm dry summers, is prone to frequent and intense droughts, and is heavily
influenced by the El Niño-La Niña Southern Oscillation system (Poulos 2007; Warnock 2010).
Paleoenvironmental studies have demonstrated that little natural ecological change has occurred
from A.D. 900 to the present (Wells 1966; Hoyt 2000). However, Euro-American arrival, settlement,
and landscape use caused dramatic ecological change, primarily by removing fire as a disturbance and
through livestock overgrazing (Poulos 2007; Warnock 2010). Both of these occurrences led to the
transition from grassland to shrubland communities in many areas. Despite this, 91 plant
communities, predominantly grasslands and shrublands, lie within the bounds of the Eastern TransPecos according to USDA-NRCS plant community data. Higher elevation mountains support sky
island ecosystems that are more pine (Pinus spp.) forest in nature, while the two rivers (Pecos River
and Rio Grande) on the periphery of the study area, and several creeks, support a variety of tree
species (Hatch et al. 1990; Powell 1994, 1998).
The Eastern Trans-Pecos is archeologically defined as the area lying south and west of the Pecos
River, bordering the Lower Pecos region, north of the Rio Grande, west of Lobo Valley and the Great
Salt Basin in Culberson County, and south of the Texas-New Mexico state border. Archeological
remains demonstrate that this area was culturally distinct throughout prehistory, but more
prominently so in the Late Prehistoric period. This is signaled by a lack of settlements, farming, and
pottery production in comparison to the Western Trans-Pecos, with the exception of the La Junta
District (Mallouf 1985; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004; Perttula 2004). In terms of distinguishing the
Eastern Trans-Pecos from other archeological regions, the Southern Plains to the north of the study
area show higher mobility and greater emphasis on bison (Bison bison) procurement (Perttula 2004).
The Central Texas region to the east of the study area lacks the regionally specific Livermore, Diablo,
Means, and Alazan arrow points and was dominated by the settlements of Austin phase and Toyah
phase groups during the Late Prehistoric (Arnn 2012; Collins 2004; Johnson 1994; Mallouf 2012,
2013). Within the Lower Pecos to the southeast groups did not utilize the Livermore, Diablo, Means,
and Alazan arrow points in their hunting equipment nor is the Cielo Complex present within the
region (Mallouf 1985).
Within the Eastern Trans-Pecos the Late Prehistoric period is demarcated by the reliance on bow
and arrow hunting technology with diagnostic arrow point types including Livermore, Toyah, Perdiz,
and Fresno (see Turner et al. [2011] for a discussion of these types) as well as the recently defined
Diablo, Means and Alazan types (see Mallouf [2012, 2013] for discussion of their morphological
attributes). Pottery was minimally utilized throughout this era, with wares of local (created within the
La Junta District) and exotic origin (originating from northern Mexico, the Western Trans-Pecos,
central and southern New Mexico, and far East Texas) (Cloud 2004; Cloud et al. 2004; Kenmotsu
2013). Most pottery artifacts are encountered on sites in the La Junta District and the Pecos River
valley (Mallouf 1985). Although horticulture occurred in the region, it was solely within the La Junta

3

JOURNAL OF TEXAS ARCHEOLOGY AND HISTORY.ORG

District; cultigens are not examined in this study, as it focuses specifically on Late Prehistoric era
hunter-gatherers and their collecting practices. Additionally, two primary archeological huntergatherer groups have been identified in the archeological record: the Livermore phase and the Cielo
Complex.

Livermore Phase
Defined by Kelley et al. (1940) and revised by Kelley (1957), the Livermore phase (ca. A.D. 9001300) is typified by nomadic hunter- gatherers who utilized bow and arrow hunting technology and
occupied the area between southeastern New Mexico and northeastern Chihuahua. At this time the
Livermore phase remains poorly defined, although elements of mountain-top ritualism and material
culture remains are known (Seebach 2007). Projectile points typically found in association with one
another include the Livermore, Toyah, and Fresno (Mallouf 1999) as well as Diablo, Means, and
Alazan (Mallouf 2012). Mountain-top ritualism is noted because of the presence of two large arrow
point caches, the Livermore and Means caches, atop two mountainous peaks in the study area
(Mallouf 2009). Kelley (1957) posits that the Livermore phase indicates an incursion of Plains-based
hunter-gatherers, while Mallouf (1999) cautions that the archeological culture it represents may be
that of an indigenous group.

Cielo Complex
Another hunter-gatherer group in the study area, the Cielo Complex (ca. A.D. 1250-1680)
represents a unique archeological complex identified by Mallouf (1985). Classic Cielo Complex sites
have stacked stone-based wickiup structures atop readily defendable locations at both long term and
short term locales (Mallouf 1999). Cielo Complex groups predominately utilized the Perdiz arrow
point, but Garza and Soto points become more common later in prehistory (Mallouf 1999). Other
chipped stone tool types include blades, blade drills, formal end scrapers, beveled knives, and
prismatic blade cores. These chipped stone tools are also diagnostic of the Toyah phase of Central
Texas (Johnson 1994), although a key difference between these two archeological groups is the
absence of pottery at Cielo Complex sites. Mallouf (1999) suggests the Cielo Complex may be
ancestral to the Protohistoric and Historic era Jumano, while Mallouf also hypothesizes that this
archeological complex could be the remains of one or more indigenous groups in the region.
Relying on Spanish accounts it is understood that the majority of the Eastern Trans-Pecos
inhabitants were hunter-gatherers during the Protohistoric period (A.D. 1535-1700) (Cloud 2004;
Mallouf 1999; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). The primary hunter-gatherer groups mentioned include
the Jumano, Chisos, and Gediondo, while the La Junta District farmers are described primarily as the
Patarbueye (Arnn 2012; Kelley 1986; Kenmotsu 1994; Kenmotsu and Wade 2002). Later, during the
Historic Era (A.D. 1700-Present) these indigenous groups were replaced by Athabascan speakers (i.e.,
Mescalero Apache), later by settlers from Spain and Mexico, and finally Euro-Americans. All of these
groups, whether Late Prehistoric, Protohistoric, or Historic/modern, have had a direct relationship
with the biotic communities present within the Eastern Trans-Pecos. Although these relationships are
obviously different (e.g., modern groups do not rely on foraging for subsistence as the Chisos hunter-

4

VOLUME 1 (2014)

gatherers would have), this harsh landscape undoubtedly left major impressions on these groups. With
the understanding that all cultural groups have some sort of relationship with the landscape they
inhabit, this study utilizes for the examination of biotic community relationships a spatial ecological
proxy currently used by modern entities within the Eastern Trans-Pecos for natural resource
management.

Plant Communities, Ecological Stable State Theory, and Archeology
Originally named the Soil Erosion Service, today’s USDA-NRCS serves as a technical and
financial assistance organization to help landowners in the United States maintain healthy landscapes
(USDA-NRCS 2013). In this capacity the NRCS coordinated with the Bureau of Land Management
and the U.S. Forest Service to create an interagency, standardized classification system of rangeland
types to better monitor, inventory, evaluate, and manage the United States’ rangelands (USDA-NRCS
et al. 2013). This classification system, known as ecological site descriptions (ESD), is based upon soil
characteristics, temperature and precipitation data, and topographic characteristics (e.g., slope and
aspect), and plant community descriptions that define plant assemblages and disturbances that typify
specific plant communities. These plant community descriptions provide taxa lists that typify the
community as well as the percentages of the different taxa within the different communities (USDANRCS et al. 2013).
The ESD system is based on ecological stable state theory, wherein an ecosystem can experience
a variety of stable states depending largely upon incipient ecological disturbance regimes (Beisner et
al. 2003; Holling 1973; Law and Morton 1993). Once these disturbance regimes are altered (e.g., an
increase or decrease in fire frequency, livestock overgrazing, global climate change, etc.) beyond a
certain point the ecosystem then enters a transitional state. Upon entering its transition the ecosystem
can revert to the previous stable state, if the original disturbance regime returns, or enter a different
stable state (USDA-NRCS et al. 2013). It should be noted that this system only applies to small scale
changes and not to more massive ecological transitions such as occurred in the Pleistocene-Holocene
transition. However, the introduction of Old World plant taxa to the Americas is demonstrated in
ecological sites as transitions away from the historic climax plant community.
Another key component to the ESD system is that the distinct plant communities can remain
stable for extended periods of time (USDA et al. 2013), making them useful for archeological inquiry.
Additionally, the entities involved with implementing the ESD system rely heavily upon
paleoenvironmental data, historic accounts, and historic ecological data, as well as reference
communities that possess little anthropogenic alteration since Euro-American settlement to define
historic plant communities (USDA-NRCS et al. 2013). This, combined with studies demonstrating
negligible environmental and climatic change since A.D. 900 within the Eastern Trans-Pecos (Davis
1989; Elias and Van Devender 1992; Hoyt 2000; Van Devender 1990), makes this system well suited
as a spatial model for determining the availability of resources to Late Prehistoric era inhabitants
within the study area. At this point the ESD system has not been fully completed for the study area—
specifically that the species composition data for the historic climax plant community have not been
determined—but the spatial extent of 70 ecological sites is currently available. This is unsurprising

5

JOURNAL OF TEXAS ARCHEOLOGY AND HISTORY.ORG

given the amount of data required to delineate and describe ecological sites and that the system
classification was initiated only 17 years ago (USDA-NRCS 2007). How this shortcoming was dealt
with analytically is described in later portions of this article.

METHODS
To determine how hunter-gatherer peoples in the Eastern Trans-Pecos utilized the landscape
around them for botanical food resources, four archeological sites are examined from the study area:
Arroyo de la Presa Site (41PS800) (Cloud 2004), Tres Metates Rockshelter (41PS915) (Seebach 2007),
Granado Cave (41CU8) (Hamilton 2001), and 41PC502 (Antiquities Planning and Consulting 2002)
(Figure 2). These archeological sites were included because they were the only available data sources
at the time of analysis. Data from these reports are then compared to the available native botanical
dietary resources of the Mescalero Apache via data extraction from a spatial model (ESD system) in a
GIS. Implications of the incomplete ESD System are quantified as is the degree of botanical taxa
diversity within each site catchment area. Finally, a series of queries and comparisons are undertaken
to best understand (a) the applicability of historic group diet to prehistoric group diet as well as (b)
determining the applicability of ESD historic climax plant community descriptions within
archeological methodological frameworks.

The Late Prehistoric Eastern Trans-Pecos Botanical Diet Record
The Arroyo de la Presa site (41PS800) is a multi-component open campsite in southeastern
Presidio County, located very close to the Rio Grande. Approximately 84 m3 of the deposits were
excavated via 19 hand excavated units and four backhoe trenches. Eight stratigraphic zones were
encountered with occupations in Zone IV beginning around A.D. 700 and occupation continued
sporadically through A.D. 1260, dating this site primarily to the Late Prehistoric period. Twentyseven radiocarbon dates were obtained to date this zone. Investigations indicate that the Arroyo de la
Presa site was predominantly a plant processing location based on feature types and macrobotanical
analyses of feature contents. The recovery of faunal remains, combined with chemical analyses,
demonstrated that terrestrial mammals and lotic (i.e., moving freshwater) resources were also
processed at this location. Specific for this analysis, 33 matrix samples were analyzed for
macrobotanical remains from 12 features: three stone hearths, five pits, two fire-cracked rock (FCR)
concentrations within pits, a pavement of FCR, and a ring midden (Cloud 2004).
Tres Metates Rockshelter (41PS915) is located in southwestern Presidio County and was used
first around A.D. 1200 and then again between A.D. 1440 and 1640, all during the Late Prehistoric.
The presence of Toyah, Garza, and Livermore arrow points, a Perdiz arrow point preform, a Jornada
Mogollon or Casas Grandes brownware sherd, a Carretas polychrome sherd, and two radiocarbon
dates (750 ± 60 B.P. and 360 ± 40 B.P.) from six excavation units demonstrate that there were two
occupations at the site. Evidence from a plant-lined storage pit demonstrate that the rockshelter was
primarily used as a locale for plant food gathering, processing, and storage (Seebach 2007). Seebach
(2007) also postulates that this site was utilized by La Junta District forager-farmers to gather local
plant species before transporting them back to villages along the Rio Grande and Rio Conchos.

Figure 2. Map of archeological sites in the study area.
Granado Cave (41CU8), a sinkhole cave in eastern Culberson County, was occupied between
A.D. 200 and A.D. 1450 based on 20 radiocarbon dates. Time diagnostic artifacts include five arrow
points (one of which is a Livermore), and five pottery types: Matta Red-on-Brown, Chupadero Blackon-White, Convento Vertical Corrugated, Chihuahuan Brownware, and Jornada Brownware. The
cave was used for habitation, food processing, and as a burial place based upon the variety of
recovered artifacts and identified features. Botanical food sources were identified through pollen
analysis of 16 human coprolites, one colon sample, and 10 sediment samples from human burials.
These analyses indicate that the original inhabitants made full use of the limited faunal and many
botanical resources of the surrounding landscape (Hamilton 2001).
41PC502, an open air campsite in eastern Pecos County on the Stockton Plateau, proved to be a
multi-component site occupied during the Late Prehistoric. Eight radiocarbon dates were gathered
from a hot rock oven facility and indicated that site use dated from A.D. 900 to A.D. 1430. Within
this time frame the facility was used four times as a oven for processing members with side scrapers of

7

the Agavaceae family. A crescent midden and hot rock baking pit (Feature 3) received the most
attention during the excavations. Ten flotation and three macrobotanical samples were analyzed for
macrobotanical remains (Antiquities Planning and Consulting 2002).

Ethnographic and Ethnohistoric Comparisons
To determine the degree to which Late Prehistoric groups utilized available plant species as food
resources, the recorded diet of the historic Mescalero Apache is used for comparative analysis. This
group was selected because the Mescalero Apache are historically known to be hunter-gatherers
(Basehart 1960; Castetter and Bell 1936); the tribal group occupied the Chihuahuan Desert (Basehart
1960; Castetter and Bell 1936); there is ethnohistoric and archeological evidence for the displacement,
absorption, or both, of peoples by Apache groups already occupying the Eastern Trans-Pecos (Mallouf
1999; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004; Seymour 2004); and ethnographic studies are available that provide
extensive botanical diet information (i.e., Basehart 1960; Castetter and Opler 1936).
The Mescalero Apache had occupied virtually all of the study area by ca. A.D. 1500 based on
ethnohistoric information and historic accounts (Arnn 2012; Hickerson 1994; Kelley 1986,;Kenmotsu
and Arnn 2012). Additionally, archeological information from the Cielo Bravo site indicates that
possible Athabascan speakers not only used the same site, but also occupied the same habitation
features, as previous residents had done (see Mallouf [1999] for further discussion). This cultural
absorption provides a unique grounds for dietary acculturation, this being a dynamic and complex
phenomenon that can result in mixing of food ways by both cultural entities, wherein the immigrating
group (i.e., the Mescalero Apache) adopts foods of the host, incipient group(s) (Satia-Abouta 2003).
The extent of food way adoption is regulated by many factors such as religion, cultural beliefs and
attitudes, as well as personal taste, texture, and color preferences (Satia-Abouta 2003). Hypothetically,
dietary acculturation could have taken place in the Eastern Trans-Pecos by means of cultural contact
or absorption. Examination of the literature indicate that dietary acculturation processes have never
been examined in an archeological context but are increasing in number in applied anthropology
situations to better understand processes of globalization (e.g., Kim et al. 2007; Regev-Tobias et al.
2012).
From an environmental deterministic perspective all Apachean groups would have needed to alter
their diet to accommodate their adoption and use of resources in newly entered regions. The
Mescalero Apache and other Athabascan speakers originated far to the north of the study area
(Seymour 2012). Although two routes for ancestral Apachean migrations have been proposed
(mountain [Seymour 2012] or plains [Wilcox 1981] routes), the Chihuahuan Desert is vastly different
ecologically than any area Athabascan speakers originated from or moved through. If the newly
arrived Apachean groups had not adapted their diet to the new environment, their likelihood of
survival would have been greatly diminished.
Regardless of whether food adoption occurred as a result of cultural absorption/dietary
acculturation, environmental adaptation, or a combination of the two, it should be reiterated that a
primary purpose of this study is only to identify the similarity between the prehistoric and Mescalero

8

VOLUME 1 (2014)

Apache use of dietary species. No attempt was made to identify aspects of cultural change or
conditions for the adoption of practices from the host group(s). Future studies should be concerned
with establishing the reasons for this dietary similarity as it may relate to dietary acculturation in order
to better understand the cultural changes Apachean groups underwent after arriving in the American
Southwest and Texas.
To determine how similar Late Prehistoric and Historic era native plant diet are, an examination
of the ethnographic literature is needed. Castetter and Opler’s exemplary study of plant use by
Mescalero and Chiricahua Apache was undertaken from 1931-1934. During this three year period a
variety of data was gathered from ethnographic fieldwork on the Mescalero Reservation in south
central New Mexico that was concerned with the botanical characteristics of Chiricahua and
Mescalero Apache cultures (Castetter and Opler 1936). That being said, some aspects of material
culture, linguistics, hunting, religion, and social organization were also discussed. Most importantly
for this study, 70 different plant taxa were identified for food use, and information was gathered as
well concerning their preparation strategies. As such, Castetter and Opler’s study provides the greatest
amount of ethnographic information specific to plant diet compared to a second Mescalero Apache
ethnobiological study by Basehart (1960).
In contrast to the work completed by Castetter and Opler (1936), the study by Basehart (1960)
was undertaken primarily to better understand the subsistence patterns and political organization of
the Mescalero Apache. Interviews and field work were undertaken on the Mescalero Reservation
from 1957-1960. I am most concerned with the subsistence patterns described by Basehart (1960),
because while Basehart did not identify as many plant taxa as Castetter and Opler (1936), he did
identify the staples of native plant diet as well as seasonal movements to procure these resources.
When taken together these two data sources indicate 70 different native plant taxa constituted the
plant-heavy diet of the Mescalero Apache (Castetter and Opler 1936). Seasonally, this group relied
heavily upon three taxa: agave (Agave spp.), prickly pear (Opuntia spp.), and datil yucca (Yucca baccata)
(Basehart 1960). Small seeds from grasses, berries, greens, piñon (e.g., Pinus edulis) nuts, oak (Quercus
spp.) acorns, and the starchy bases of hydrophytic plants (e.g., cattail [Typha spp.]) were important
portions of the native plant diet depending upon the season (see Castetter and Opler [1936] and
Basehart [1960] for more detailed information).

Spatial Data Extraction
The exploitation of a plant community for native plant food resources from an archeological
context is gained through knowledge of both plant communities and paleoethnobotanical remains, as
well as comparisons with ethnographically described cultures of the same or similar geographic areas.
To collect this knowledge, spatial and comparative analyses were undertaken to determine locally
available dietary plant species use in hunter-gatherer and forager-farmer diets.
To identify what plant species were available, county level USDA-NRCS spatial data was
downloaded from the “Web Soil Survey for Brewster, Culberson, Hudspeth, Jeff Davis, Pecos,
Presidio, Reeves, and Terrell Counties in Texas.” These data were incorporated into a Microsoft

9

JOURNAL OF TEXAS ARCHEOLOGY AND HISTORY.ORG

Access Database, and the ecological site names and their plotted extent was loaded in an ESRI
ArcGIS 10.0 blank ArcMap document using the SoilViewer PlugIn 6.1.
Because only portions of Hudspeth, Jeff Davis, Presidio, and Terrell counties are within the
Eastern Trans-Pecos archeological region, a georeferenced regional map from Cloud and Piehl (2008)
was outlined and the counties clipped to the study area. Site locations for Arroyo de la Presa, Tres
Metates Rockshelter, Granado Cave, and 41PC502 were then gathered from the Texas Archeological
Site Atlas and plotted on the ecological site map for the area.
Ethnographic information has generally concluded that the maximum one day catchment for
individuals gathering plant resources is 15 kilometers (km) (Kelly 1995). Although the foraging radius
from these sites may be smaller, by utilizing the maximum distance all possible variation in the
distribution of plant resources is incorporated into the analysis. For the spatial analysis a 15 km buffer
was generated around each site location and a union performed between the reconstructed foraging
radii and the ecological site names layers (Figures 3 and 4). It should be noted that this analysis does
not account for the consequences of terrain variability and labor expenditure in gathering plant
resources but instead seeks to analyze the maximum possible ecological variability that occurs around
these specific archaeological sites.

Plant Taxa Diversity and Evenness
To examine botanical diversity an index, Shannon’s Diversity Index (SDI or H’) (Figure 5), was
added to the analysis as it is frequently used in landscape ecology to determine taxa richness
(McGarigal et al. 2013; O’Neill et al. 1988). Here R is the total number of species in the site catchment
and pi the proportion of S made up of the ith species (Shannon and Weaver 1949). Results of this
index are relative and the value increases as the number of unique taxa increases (McGarigal et al.
2013). A table was also generated to determine the number of unique taxa within each taxa, as well as
the number of taxa which are encountered multiple times
within the site catchment.

Figure 5. Shannon’s Diversity Index (SDI)
(Shannon and Weaver 1949).

Figure 6. Shannon’s Evenness Index (SEI)
(Shannon and Weaver 1949).

Another index, Shannon’s Evenness Index (SEI)
(Figure 6), was also used as this identifies how evenly species
are dispersed in a given landscape (O’Neill et al. 1988). For
this, the SDI (H’) is divided by the natural log of the total
number of species on the landscape, H’max (Shannon and
Weaver 1949). With this index the closer the result (E) is to 1
the more evenly distributed species are on the landscape
(McGarigal et al. 2013).

Comparative Analysis
To determine available plant species a process had to be developed to compile this data because
the species composition for the ecological sites/plant communities are not available from the Web
Soil Survey county level downloads. Identifying which ecological sites are present within the
reconstructed foraging catchment was determined by copying the relevant attribute data from the
ecological site name-foraging radii spatial union. For determining plant taxon composition the ESD
System for Rangeland and Forestland Data was accessed and the species copied and pasted into an
Excel spreadsheet. To double check the ESD System for Rangeland and Forestland Data, a series of
“Area of Interest” was generated in a Web Soil Survey session approximating the reconstructed
foraging radii. Species composition missing from the ESD System for Rangeland and Forestland Data
was then incorporated into the plant community spreadsheets. When taxa were encountered in the
archeological record but not the current ecological data Powell (1994, 1998) and the USDA PLANTS
Database (USDA-NRCS 2013) were examined to determine if the particular taxa could be present
within the site catchments.
In order to compare the sizeable amount of botanical data, a table was developed that compared
the prehistoric diet from each archeological site to the wild plant foods utilized by the Historic
Mescalero Apache available within the site catchments. The reason for compiling information in this
manner was to determine if prehistoric foragers were utilizing the same botanical species in the plant
communities surrounding these archeological sites as the Mescalero Apache might have.

RESULTS
Results of the comparative analysis portion of the study identify a few unique observations as well
as some complications in the use of the USDA-NRCS historic climax plant community data. Before
an examination of the archeological-ethnohistoric comparisons, the missing plant species data from
the ecological proxy must be addressed.
Two major hurdles encountered in the comparative analysis was the presence of areas with no
defined ecological site within the site catchments and the existence of defined ecological sites with no
available plant species composition data. The occurrence of these phenomena is likely due to a lack of
reporting from the USDA-NRCS, BLM, and USDA-Forest Service, which is unsurprising given the
large amount of work involved and that the ESD System was only recently initiated (USDA-NRCS
2007). Analytical implications for this primarily relate to not knowing the full vegetative suite within
the ecological sites. However as Table 1 indicates, the SDI values are not very high (> 6), which is
indicative of the fact that the landscapes are mildly heterogenous at the site catchment scale. The most
hypothetically important ecological sites (i.e., riparian corridors) are missing plant species data. In the
near future, this deficit will be righted as the USDA-NRCS, BLM, and USDA-Forest Service continue
their efforts in reporting; at this time no attempt was made to account for this missing data.
Table 1 identifies the percentage of site catchment areas that have unknown ecological sites,
known ecological sites with no historic climax community plant taxa data, and known ecological sites

12

VOLUME 1 (2014)

with historic climax community plant taxa data. In the future it is expected that this missing data will
gradually be included. The two sites from Presidio County (Arroyo de la Presa site and Tres Metates
Rockshelter) are the most reliable in terms of known data for the total site catchment areas.

In relation to ecological information, Table 2 presents data regarding the total number of plant
taxa, their frequency and uniqueness, and results of the SDI and SEI. The SDI demonstrates that the
site catchment for Tres Metates Rockshelter (41PS915) has the most variation (SDI = 5.65) between
the number of taxa while Granado Cave (41CU8) has the least variation (SDI = 4.43). In terms of the
relative evenness of taxa, the SEI shows that the catchment of the Arroyo de la Presa (41PS800) site
are dominated by fewer plant taxa (SEI = 0.83) than the three other site catchments. However, Tres
Metates Rockshelter has the least evenly distributed number of taxa (SEI = 0.91). This combined
information demonstrates that for the Tres Metates Rockshelter catchment area there are a higher
amount of botanical taxa dominating the landscape with a high amount of variation compared to the
other three site catchment areas. It should be noted that none of the site catchments have complete
ecological data and these values will potentially change in the future.

Granado Cave (41CU8) had eight ecological sites but two do not currently have described plant
species composition data. Unfortunately, these two ecological sites account for 50.7 percent of the site
catchment area. However, for the six plant communities which do have known compositions, there
are 97 plant taxa available (see Table 1). Of the plant species 14 (14.4 percent) would have been used
by the Mescalero Apache as food resources but only seven are encountered archeologically (Table 3).
One taxa is present in the archeo-dietary record, grape (Vitis sp.), but not in the ecological data.
According to Castetter and Opler (1936), Arizona grape (Vitis arizonica) was consumed by the
Mescalero Apache in the summer and fall and thus is not a dietary outlier. Powell (1998:256)
concluded that Arizona grape is present in Culberson County, Texas, where Granado Cave is located.
However, Arizona grape requires access to large amounts of water for growth and, despite being in an
arid area, there are two riparian zone ecological sites (Bottomland [R042XC017NM] and Draw,
Desert Grassland [R042XC242TX]), within the site catchment area but neither have historic climax
plant community botanical taxa data. The presence of these riparian locales and the presence of the
taxa in recent prehistoric archeological deposits suggests that grape plants are a component of the
incomplete plant taxa dataset. In addition to this, the coprolite study from Hamilton (2001)
demonstrated that grass (Poaceae) pollen is present in a significant portion of the coprolites.
Unfortunately non-cultivated members of the family Poaceae cannot be identified beyond the family
level with pollen (Bryant 2006), so which of the three taxa used by the Mescalero Apache and present
in the site catchment (muhly grass [Muhlenbergia spp.], vine mesquite [Panicum obtusum], and sand
dropseed [Sporobolus cryptandrus]) cannot be determined; consequently, they must be treated as one
taxonomic unit in the analysis.

41PC502 had 12 ecological sites with only seven currently having species composition available.
The seven ecological sites with known plant taxa account for 52.8 percent of the site catchment area
and they have 109 botanical taxa present (see Table 1). Fourteen (12.8 percent) of these taxa would
have been used as food by the Mescalero Apache but only four are archeologically represented. Two
additional taxa (lambsquarters/amaranth [Cheno-Ams] and purslane [Portulaca sp.]) are encountered
in the archeological record and are known to have been eaten by the Mescalero Apache (Castetter and
Basehart 1936) but are currently absent in the ecological data (Table 4). It should be noted that the

14

VOLUME 1 (2014)

taxonomic unit of Cheno-Ams consists of members of the family Chenopodiaceae and the genus
Amaranthus in the family Amaranthaceae, but are difficult to separately discern in many archeological
contexts (Dering 2004). The absence of Cheno-Ams and purslane in the ecological data is most likely
due to the incomplete ecological proxy. However, the USDA PLANTS Database indicates these are
ubiquitous across the Eastern Trans-Pecos (USDA-NRCS 2013) and are likely to contribute to the
taxa composition of the missing ecological site data.

The reconstructed foraging radius for the Arroyo de la Presa site (41PS800) had a total of nine
ecological sites, although only eight currently have plant species composition data. These eight
ecological sites account for 84.9 percent of the site catchment area. Within the reconstructed foraging
radius there are a total of 135 plant taxa currently known (see Table 1). Thirteen (9.6 percent) of these
are known to have been consumed by the Mescalero Apache, but only four are found in archeological
samples (Table 5). As at 41PC502, Cheno-Ams are present in the samples and were consumed
historically by the Mescalero Apache (Castetter and Basehart 1936). Cheno-Ams are not currently in
the ESD System data but most likely are present in the biota as mentioned above. The fruits of one
taxa, saltbush (Atriplex spp.), were encountered in the archeological record but were not apparently
used by the Mescalero Apache. The presence of these seeds may be due to the use of saltbush as fuel
(see below).
Tres Metates Rockshelter (41PS915) has the most ecological variability (SDI = 5.65, SEI = 0.91)
within this reconstructed foraging radius compared to the other three sites. Sixteen ecological sites are
present in the site catchment area while four have yet to be described. Those presently having plant
taxa composition data available account for 76.9 percent of the site catchment area. Of the 12 plant
communities with available plant taxa data, 174 different taxa are present (see Table 1). Nineteen of
these taxa have recorded dietary use among the Mescalero Apache and 15 are encountered
archeologically (Table 6). Of those recovered in the archeological record, four have no known food

15

JOURNAL OF TEXAS ARCHEOLOGY AND HISTORY.ORG

use among the Mescalero Apache (Castetter and Opler 1936; Basehart 1960). These include saltbush,
bristlegrass (Setaria ssp.), buffalo gourd (Cucurbita foetidissima), paspalum grass (Paspalum spp.), and
plantain (Plantago spp.). Of these four only buffalo gourd is not present in the current ESD System
data.

DISCUSSION
Results of this study indicate there are four overlying patterns concerning Late Prehistoric Era
native plant diet among hunter-gatherers and forager-farmers in the Eastern Trans-Pecos archeological
region. These patterns can be grouped into three primary observations: similarity between the historic
and prehistoric groups; preservation induced bias; and problems with the ecological proxy.
As demonstrated in Table 7, there is a wide variation in prehistoric subsistence use of plant taxa
compared to the Mescalero Apache. However, the prehistoric samples are dominated by four taxa:
prickly pear (Opuntia spp.), mesquite (Proposis spp.), yucca (Yucca spp.), and agave (Agave sp.) (see
Tables 3-6). This furthers the dietary similarity between the historic and prehistoric groups as these
four taxa are also the dominant botanical dietary species for the Mescalero Apache (Basehart 1960).

Results of the comparative analysis indicate that there is not complete dietary overlap between the
Mescalero Apache and Late Prehistoric groups that occupied the four sites, but the dietary plant
species are quite similar. Any dissimilarity is caused by the presence of three confirmed dietary taxa
based on the ethnographic record that are also present in archeological samples. Plantago seeds were
encountered in the feature fill from 41PC502 and the seeds of one species, woolly plantain (Plantago
patagonica), are known to have been consumed by three cultural groups (Moerman 2010). Because this
taxa has no recorded use among Apachean groups it may never have been adopted by these
immigrating peoples and would be indicative of dietary acculturation processes. The same can be said
for buffalo gourd, which was used by four groups across the American Southwest and California as a
food source, is present in the storage feature at Tres Metates Rockshelter, but was not used by the
Mescalero Apache or any other Apachean group (Moerman 2010).
This analysis also questions the inclusion of two grass (Paspalum spp. and Setaria spp.) and one
shrub taxa (Atriplex spp.) as dietarily important within the Eastern Trans-Pecos archeological region.
Paspalum grass seeds were present at Tres Metates Rockshelter but were not used by the Mescalero
Apache. In fact, only one species of paspalum grass, thin paspalum (Paspalum setaceum), is known to
have had an ethnographic dietary use according to Moerman (2010) but this species is not found in
Trans-Pecos Texas (Powell 1994; Vestal and Schultes 1939). However, four species of paspalum grass
are known to occur in the Trans-Pecos Region (Powell 1994). Bristlegrass seeds and florets are also
present at Tres Metates Rockshelter, but have no known ethnographic use (Moerman 2010). Because
of this, and the fact that Seebach (2007) indicates grass was incorporated into the lining of the storage
pit, it is likely that the bristlegrass and paspalum grass seeds are not reflective of diet but were
incorporated instead because of these of these grasses in feature construction. Finally, one other plant

17

JOURNAL OF TEXAS ARCHEOLOGY AND HISTORY.ORG

taxa, saltbush (Atriplex spp.), may not have been used as a food resource in the region but was
included in features for non-dietary reasons.
Within the Trans-Pecos region there are four native taxa of saltbush: tubercled saltbush (Atriplex
acanthocarpa), obovate leaf saltbush (Atriplex obovata), spiny saltbush (Atriplex confertifolia), and fourwing saltbush (Atriplex canescens) (Powell 1998). Three of these (obovateleaf saltbush, spiny saltbush,
and four-wing saltbush) are used primarily as flavorings for a variety of dishes or as greens (Moerman
2010). Of those present in the Trans-Pecos, spiny saltbush and four-wing saltbush are the only two
whose seeds have been ethnographically documented as food sources (Chamberlin 1911; Moerman
2010). Obovate leaf saltbush was used as a spice and for greens (Colton 1974; Whiting 1939), while
tubercled saltbush has no known dietary use (Moerman 2010). Spiny saltbush only occurs in the very
far western portion of the region and obovate leaf saltbush is present only in the southwestern portion
of the study area, making the identification of the saltbush seeds at 41PC502 as most likely four-wing
saltbush, which is found throughout the Trans-Pecos (Powell 1998). Because the seeds of four-wing
saltbush seeds are rarely consumed but used as a spice among the Ramah Navajo (Vestal 1952), and
saltbush was a fuel or kindling source at 41PC502 (Antiquities Planning and Consulting 2002), it is
more likely that the seeds reflect their incorporation in fuel/kindling or use as a spice used in cooking
rather than as a food source.
Four-wing saltbush seeds are also present at Tres Metates Rockshelter in a plant-lined storage pit
(Seebach 2007). However, as stated above, this taxon is a rarely used food source. Seebach (2007:26)
did indicate that wooden sticks were included in the storage pit’s structure but identification of these
materials was not presented in the report. Therefore, if any of these wooden elements are from fourwing saltbush, which is present in the site catchment, there is a high likelihood that these seeds were
originally from the structural elements rather than a stored food source.
Of the taxa which are not observed in the archeological samples, the vast majority are taxa
utilized for fruit and starchy foods. While it is possible to recover starch residue from archeological
contexts (e.g., Messner 2011; Perry and Quigg 2011), and I have attempted to obtain sources of this
proxy, none have been published for the Late Prehistoric Era in the Eastern Trans-Pecos archeological
region. Fruit and starchy foodstuffs are also the least likely to be preserved in the archeological record
(Pearsall 2010). Unfortunately, the fruit foods were key to the warm season diet among the Mescalero
Apache (Basehart 1960; Castetter and Opler 1936), and it can only be assumed that these were vital to
Late Prehistoric peoples as well.
An overarching issue with this analysis are the incomplete ESD System historic climax plant
community descriptions. At this time, 13 of the 34 plant communities within the reconstructed
foraging radii are missing. This is most likely the reason some of the plant taxa found in the
archeological samples are missing in the ecological proxy. However, with continued completion of
these plant community descriptions, specifically those in the vastly important riparian areas, an even
better understanding of prehistorically available native plant species can be developed. Regardless, this
study demonstrates that the ESD System can be used for archeological landscape use studies as the
majority of botanical taxa (80.2 percent) documented in the archeological samples are present in
current plant community descriptions. Additionally, despite the incomplete ESD System for the study

18

VOLUME 1 (2014)

area, the results indicate that many more plant taxa would have been available to prehistoric huntergatherers than the archeological record indicates. However, future studies focusing on microbotanical
remains, specifically starch grains and phytoliths, are needed to confirm this.
Finally, findings of this study support a hypothesis proposed by Seebach (2007) that La Junta
District forager-farmers traveled away from villages to procure foodstuffs. Seebach (2007:44-45) stated
that individuals utilized Tres Metates Rockshelter as a location for procuring and storing locally
available foods. The 15 km reconstructed foraging radius for this archeological site has the most
ecological variability of all four radii in both number of known botanical taxa, number of ecological
sites, and heterogeneity of taxa across the site catchment (see Table 2). This variability is a potential
reason why forager-farmers utilized this archeological site in addition to the food storage and
preservation capabilities of the rockshelter.

CONCLUSIONS
The native botanical component of diet between the Historic Mescalero Apache and the Late
Prehistoric inhabitants of the eastern Trans-Pecos is quite similar when comparing recovered plant
remains to ethnographic information. A cursory examination of these data indicate that the Late
Prehistoric native plant diet was much more restricted than the Mescalero Apache wild land botanical
diet. However, plant parts with low preservation values (i.e., fruits, leaves, flowers, and flower stalks)
account for 57 percent of plant species utilized as wild land foods in this group (Castetter and Opler
1936). Despite being of vital importance, these plant parts are highly unlikely to be encountered in the
archeological record. By utilizing proxies solely derived from the archeological record,
paleoethnobotanists would be greatly amiss in assessing hunter-gatherer paleonutrition. Results of this
study also indicate native plant diet for Late Prehistoric era peoples was probably much more diverse
than the archeological record indicates and that some form of dietary acculturation occurred during
the absorption of incipient groups by the Mescalero Apache. However, four staples (prickly pear,
mesquite, yucca, and agave) dominated native botanical foods for these Late Prehistoric Era peoples.
The utility of ESD historic climax plant community descriptions is also demonstrated to be of
value in archeological analysis despite their incomplete status. Unfortunately, users of this spatial data
system can only wait until the involved entities complete their reporting, but in the interim a similar
analysis should be conducted in areas where the ESD System has been completed to further test the
use of the system. Regardless, by utilizing a proxy that is more descriptive and more frequently used
than others (e.g., Texas Parks and Wildlife Department Vegetation Types or U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency Ecoregions as suggested by Arnn [2012]) for current landscape management, it is
possible for multiple scientific fields to converge and expand the utility and accuracy of these plant
community descriptions.

POST OF LAMPASAS: FORGOTTEN RECONSTRUCTION
ERA U.S. ARMY POST (1867-1870)
Richard S. Jones

ABSTRACT
While it is well known that troops were stationed in and around Lampasas
during the Reconstruction era (1865-1877), the existence of an army post in
Lampasas County, Texas, has been rediscovered through the recent
digitization of army post returns. The post returns, available through the U.S.
National Archives and Records Administration and Ancestry.com, indicated
that the post operated between 1867 and 1870. These post returns are utilized
to highlight significant events that occurred in this area during the
Reconstruction era. Circumstantial evidence obtained while conducting this
research has identified the actual location of the post within the City of
Lampasas.

INTRODUCTION
A letter from W. B. Pace, Chief Justice of Lampasas County and four citizens to Texas Senators
Burney and Cooley, dated August 15, 1866, stated that:
This is one more to the long list of depredations that have been committed on the frontier
within the past fifteen months, and which are now of almost daily occurrence. It is not our
wish to exaggerate the reality is bad enough. It will be observed that these depredations are
now extended to Cattle, and not confined, mostly, as heretofore, to horses…This shows the
audacity of the parties, and the impunity with which they expect to carry on their robberies.
This country used to count its horses by the thousands, now scarcely a hundred can be
mustered, and still the work goes on, each moon, diminishes the number of stock and
settlers and unless a remedy is applied, and that immediately, the Frontier will and must be
abandoned… Can the Government be ignorant of our situation? We think not, will it
continue to be deaf to the call of justice and humanity? We trust not. Then why delay,
when the lives and property of its citizens are in danger? Is there any interest of more vital
importance, or that requires more immediate action? (Jackson, McCaleb, Mullins, Pace,
and Townsend 1866).
From this letter, it is evident that the citizens of Lampasas were living in fear; one must ask
whether or not the U.S. Government answered the call for aid. Until my recent analysis of post
returns, it was believed that very little, if any, aid was provided by the U.S. Government during this

time. Until recently it was thought that the aid provided by the government consisted only of setting
up a temporary encampment that was sometimes used by a cavalry detail (Clardy et al. 1991; O’Neal
2012). This article delves into the violent background of the Lampasas area around the mid-nineteenth
century and provides evidence that proves the U.S. Government did indeed answer the call for help
from the citizens of Lampasas by establishing U.S. Army Post Lampasas.

HISTORY OF VIOLENCE
The chaotic and violent nature of the Reconstruction period in Texas has its roots both in U.S.
Government Indian policies as well as the greatest conflict this Nation has ever faced, the Civil War,
which strained the very fabric of the Nation and had an adverse impact on almost every man, women,
and child that lived in this country at the time. From the Civil War extending into the Reconstruction
period, areas surrounding Lampasas County, including Hamilton, Coryell, and Bell counties, were
under constant threat of attack from Comanches and numerous outlaw gangs, as well as the threat of
mob violence primarily conducted by groups like the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) that were very active in
this region by 1868 (Howell 2012).

Comanches
The Comanche were by far the most populous Indian tribe in Texas with around 20,000 members
reported in 1849 to 1851, according to population estimates by Indian agent Robert Simpson
Neighbors and ethnologist Frederick Webb Hodge (Kavanagh 1996). Their territory during the late
eighteenth to early nineteenth centuries included a vast expanse of land including northeastern New
Mexico, southeastern Colorado, western Oklahoma, the Texas panhandle, and the Central Texas Hill
Country (Gelo 2013). In the nineteenth century, the Comanches were comprised of six
bands/divisions: Kotsotecka (Buffalo Eaters), Yamprika (Root Eaters), Kwahadi (Antelope), Nokoni
(Wanderers), Penateka (Honey Eaters, Wasps), and Tenewa (Downstream People) (Gelo 2013). The
area around Lampasas and adjacent areas were within the range of the Penateka band/division
(Richardson 1933). Muguara was the Peneteka division leader until his death in 1840, after which
Buffalo Hump, Ketumse, Sanaco, and Yellow Wolf filled the breach (Gelo 2013). Raids against
Anglo-Americans increased after 1840 when the Comanches formed an alliance with the Kiowa and
Cheyenne to stop the Anglo-American western expansion. This effort was largely successful during
this time and towns such as Lampasas were under the constant threat of attack. O’Neal (2012:15)
summarizes the conditions in the Lampasas area:
From 1857 to 1874, usually in the spring and summer, Comanches raided at will in
Lampasas County. The raiders stole large numbers of horses, often at night under a
“Comanche Moon,” and sometimes murdered and mutilated unwary settlers. This long
Comanche menace retarded population growth, forced many settlers to leave for a safer
county, and filled others who stayed with a nagging fear. The Lampasas Dispatch reported
that in 1871, “the population of the county was about fifteen hundred, and they lived in
constant dread of the murdering savages of the plains.”

28

VOLUME 1 (2014)

News reports at the time reflect similar sentiments. For example, the Southern Intelligencer (SI)
reported in March 1866 that an Indian raid occurred where “a large number of horses, the number
being variously estimated at from two to four or five hundred” were taken; locals lamented that: “[w]e
are now waiting to hear of help from some quarter. If the government knew our conditions, they
undoubtedly would lend a helping hand. The marauders took nearly all the horses in the town of
Lampasas” (SI, March 1, 1866).
In Texas, the homeland of the Comanches was not secured by the U.S. Government until after
the Civil War when several treaties were made and reservation set up within Texas and later in
western Oklahoma. However, resistance by Comanches to reservation settlement continued until their
unsuccessful attack on the Adobe Walls trading post, after which they were forced back onto the
reservation in a concerted campaign by the U.S. Army between 1874-1875 (Gelo 2013).

Outlaw Gangs
During the Civil War, the region was a safe haven to numerous outlaw gangs comprised of
confederate and union deserters, profiteering horse/cow thieves, and outcast union civilian
sympathizers (Cooper 1863; McCulloch 1864). These gangs were generally attracted to areas
surrounding Cowhouse Creek and the Lampasas River because of several factors: (1) the region’s
remote location on the frontier; (2) virtually no law enforcement presence; (3) dense concentrations of
cedar thickets that provided highly defensible positions; and (4) support from some in the local
populace who backed Sam Houston and his belief in not seceding from the Union.
Two of the main gangs that were active in Hamilton, Lampasas, Coryell, and Bell counties were
led by Elisha (or Lige) Bevins and Samuel S. Gholson, both of whom were confederate deserters.
According to reports, the two gangs had around 100 to 300 men that roamed the area stealing at will
and threatening the local populace (Cooper 1863). Confederate Major John Henry Brown in a July
1863 letter to Major General Magruder believed them to be an armed Union guerrilla force that was
in secret consultation with noted Union sympathizer George Washington Pashal (Brown 1863).
Major Brown also stated that he had information from spies that had infiltrated the gangs that they
were actively plotting executions and attempting to stockpile weapons from Mexico for some
unknown purpose (Brown 1863). In response to this letter, General Magruder sent Company B, 37
Texas Calvary led by Captain George Cooper to the area for a temporary assignment in August 1863.
While the gangs still avoided capture, Captain Cooper and his men were successful in temporarily
lowering tensions in the area. As their assignment came to an end the citizens of Bell County, fearing
a return to gang violence, petitioned General Magruder to allow Captain Cooper to stay until the
gangs were dealt with (Petition from Citizens of Bell County 1863).
Of note, one of the modus operandi of these gangs was to dress up in Indian garb in order to fool
victims and settlers into believing Indians were responsible. One story reported in the Weekly Telegraph
(WT) in November 1863 stated: “One Thomas Fulgum and others have been arrested in Coryell
County, having in their possession an abundance of Indian arrows, moccasins, and other Indian
disguises, by the aid of which they had been playing Indian on the frontier, stealing, shooting stock,

29

JOURNAL OF TEXAS ARCHEOLOGY AND HISTORY.ORG

etc. They were in communication with men who had deserted and concealed themselves in the
woods. One Augustus (Gus) Fore was associated with the same gang of deserters” (WT, November
17, 1863). Gus Fore was a known member of the Lige Bevins gang (Brown 1863). Another story
reported in the Georgetown Watchman (GW) in June 1869 reported that “[w]e are informed by Mr. D.
T. Guinn, just down from Lampasas Springs, that the late Indian depredations reported in the county
are erroneous. That there have been depredations committed is true, but the depredators are white
men” (GW, June 5, 1869).
The Bevins and Gholson gangs that roamed the area were eventually routed and defeated by a
combined force led by Captain George Cooper from Company B, 37 Texas Cavalry, a civilian
volunteer mob led by Belton resident Dred Hill, and a squad of men from Company B, 30 Texas
Cavalry. This campaign lasted over five months (August to December 1863) and ended when Lige
Bevins was captured and hung with several comrades while Gholson and remaining stragglers fled
toward Mexico before getting stopped by Confederate Forces near Eagle Pass (Brown 1863; Frontier
Times [FT], July 1926; WT, December 1, 1863; Williams 1930-1934). Following the Civil War,
Gholson was known as one of the best cattle men and frontiersman of his day, having established his
own cattle ranch in Coleman County before moving to New Mexico where he was reported to have
teamed up with legendary ex-Texas Ranger Ira Aten, range boss of the vast XIT Ranch (Dallas Herald
[DH], May 25, 1872; FT, February 1927 and July 1928; Gillett 1921:9-10; Intelligencer-Echo [IE],
November 4, 1874; Stevens 1975; Williams 1930-1934).
Of further interest, the possible association of gangs in the region with Union forces first suspected
by Major John Henry Brown in 1863 is corroborated in a May 20, 1864, letter from Captain William
Pace, who commanded the Confederate Second District State Troops in Lampasas. In this letter
Captain Pace noted:
Sir: William E. Willis and Gideon Willis came into this county about ten days ago from
Mexico, for the purpose, as they say, of recruiting for the Federal Army, and taking a list of
all would be Union men. They have recruited until their forces are said to be about 100
strong. They pass over the country in small parties with perfect impunity, and threaten
destruction of property of secessionists. In view of these outrages and the fatal results of a
longer stay in the country by them, we beseech you to come immediately to our relief
(McCulloch 1864).
Major General McCullouch, Commander Northern Sub-District, forwarded Captain Pace’s letter
to Brig. General J. E. Slaughter, Chief of Staff, on May 30, 1864 with the accompanying statement:
General: I herewith transmit a letter from Captain Pace to Lieutenant Colonel Jackson,
which will call your attention to the condition of affairs on our border. Lampasas is in the
edge of a rough mountainous region, which extends to the Concho country, and I have no
doubt a large portion of the deserters and disloyal men who are embodied are in that region
of country, and if it were to clean out all that country, commencing on Cowhouse Creek
and Lampasas, Pecan bayou, Colorado, Concho, and notify me of the time, so that I could
co-operate with them from above that place. I do not know that any force can be spared

from below, but this section is far from me, out of my district, and needs immediate
attention, if it is possible to give it, and I feel that it is my duty to so inform the general
commanding (McCulloch 1864).
When the Civil War ended, many of these deserters and criminals ended up settling in this region,
with some becoming honorable citizens while others continued their criminal lifestyle. Notable
outlaws that were active in the area during the Reconstruction period included: John Wesley Hardin,
the James Gang, Sam Hasley, John Early, William Perryman, the McRae Gang, Ace Langford, King
Fisher, Bat Masterson, the Horrell brothers, and the Shackelford Gang, to name a few (For a
complete history of outlaw violence in the Lampasas area the reader is referred to O’Neal [2012].)

Mob Violence
In addition to threat of attack from Indians and outlaws, the citizens of Texas during the
Reconstruction period also had to deal with the specter of organized mob violence. During this period
Texas was home to more than 60 organized groups that went by various names, including the KKK,
the Knights of the White Camellia, the Teutonic Knights, the Sons of Washington, the White
Brotherhood, and the Knights of the Rising Sun. All these groups were generally comprised of exconfederate Anglo-Americans that were committed to perpetuating violence against minorities,
freedman, and the occupying Union forces. In particular, the newly established Freedman’s Bureau
locations and employees were a favorite target of these groups (Howell 2012). Violence and lynching’s
from these type mobs in Texas persisted throughout the Reconstruction period and into the midtwentieth century in many local communities.

POST LAMPASAS
Based on the information presented above, it is clear the settlers in the Lampasas area lived in a
constant state of fear every day of their lives for almost a quarter of a century (1853-1875). During the
early Reconstruction period, the violence was so severe that citizens including W. B. Pace, Chief
Justice of Lampasas, pleaded to the U.S. Government for help. From recently digitized post returns, it
is now known that on May 30, 1867, the U.S. Government finally came to the aid of the citizens of
Lampasas by establishing a post within the city that was permanently occupied by a company of
soldiers from the 26th Infantry, and later 4th Calvary, from 1867 to 1870. From detailed entries within
these post returns it is now known that the soldiers of Post Lampasas were tasked to protect the local
populace from attacks from both Comanches and outlaw gangs. They were sent on multiple scouts to
make their presence known on the frontier and to also search and destroy any hostile parties
encountered, with some U.S. soldiers even losing their lives while performing these duties.
A substantial amount of historical information regarding the activities and duties of soldiers
stationed at Post Lampasas can be gleaned directly from the post returns that the U.S. Army required
every post commander to fill out every month (Figure 1). These post returns are a valuable and often
underutilized primary resource that show monthly summaries of events, deaths, wounded in action,
desertions, units present, numbers of soldiers and officers present/absent/sick, numbers of horses and

artillery, and official communications (see Appendix 1). These post returns have recently been
digitized and are available for viewing at the U.S. National Archives and the website Ancestry.com.
Prior to my analysis of post returns from Post Lampasas, recent publications (Clardy et al. 1991;
O’Neal 2012:25) described troops stationed at Lampasas as never occupying more than a temporary
encampment:
But none of the reopened or new forts were near Lampasas, and Comanches continued to
raid throughout the county. So a cavalry detail sometimes was assigned to Lampasas,
camping in the grove at Hancock Springs. There were no permanent buildings, so this little
outpost was not designated “fort” or even “camp.”
In this article, the analysis of post returns has filled the void regarding what was previously known
about this post, and these post returns clearly indicate that the U.S. Government did indeed answer
the citizens of Lampasas’ call for help and established a post that was permanently occupied by U.S.
Army troops from 1867-1870. In addition, the post returns designate this location as an actual U.S.
Army post called “Post Lampasas.” It is evident that the post was not just a temporary encampment
that was intermittently utilized by a cavalry sensu O’Neal (2012).

JOURNAL OF TEXAS ARCHEOLOGY AND HISTORY.ORG

May 1867 to January 1868: 26th Infantry, Company K
The 26th was a company out of Austin that was the first stationed at Post Lampasas. The 26th
Infantry was moved to the Rio Grande valley in January 1868.

January 1868 to March 1869: 17th Infantry, 2nd Battalion
Post returns for the 17th and 35th Companies while stationed at the post either were not
completed, were lost, or were not turned in by the post commanders. It has been documented that the
17th Infantry, 2nd Battalion was stationed in Austin to assist in frontier defense. According to Richter
(1987:180), elements from the 35th Infantry were sent in March 1869 to relieve elements of the 17th
Infantry in frontier garrisons within Texas. The mention of 35th Infantry troops on the post returns in
May 1869 suggests that there were troops from the 17th Infantry stationed at this garrison before the
arrival of the 35th.

March 1869 to May 1869: The 35th Infantry, Company H
This company likely relieved elements of the 17th around March 1869 (Richter 1987). Proof for
the presence of 35th Infantry, Company H is found in the May 1869 post return completed by the 4th
Cavalry post commander and also in the May 8, 1869 Georgetown Watchmen newspaper article that
mentioned the post was commanded by 35th Infantry, Company H 1st Lieutenant Thomas Stevens.
The Post Lampasas commissioned officer roster also listed 1st Lieutenant Stevens as present during
May 1869.

May 1869 to June 1870: 4th Cavalry, Companies A and M
These companies were sent out of Austin and, thereafter, were stationed at the post. The 4th
Cavalry, Company A under Captain Beaumont was sent to San Antonio in April 1870. Company M
under the command of Captain William O’Connell closed the post in June 1870 and was then sent to
Fort Concho.

Notable Officers
Eugene Beauharnais Beaumont (August 2, 1837-July 17, 1916).
Eugene Beaumont was a graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1861,
ranking 32nd out of 45 cadets. He was a Union Army officer in the Civil War (Figure 3) and a
recipient of the United States Military’s highest decoration, the Medal of Honor. His Medal of Honor
Citation reads, in part:
Obtained permission from the corps commander to advance upon the enemy’s position
with the 4th U.S. Cavalry, of which he was a lieutenant; led an attack upon a battery,
dispersed the enemy, and captured the guns. At Selma, Ala., charged, at the head of his
regiment, into the second and last line of the enemy’s works. After Civil War served with
4th Cavalry on numerous Texas posts including: Camp Sheridan, Fredericksburg, Ft.
Mason, Ft. Chadborn, Ft. McKavett; Lampasas, San Antonio, Ft. Richardson, and Ft.
Clark (Cullum 1920:802).

At Fort Clark, Beaumont was engaged in the attack on the Kickapoo and Lipan villages in
Mexico on May 18, 1873. At Fort McKavett, he led an expedition into Indian Territory from August
18th to December 29, 1874. Beaumont commanded a battalion of 4th Cavalry troops in the fight at
Palo Duro Canyon on September 28, 1874, which resulted in the destruction of numerous camps and
the capture of 1700 horses and mules, and the defeat of a band of Comanches (Carter 1935:25).
Beaumont also served as Assistant Instructor of Cavalry Tactics at the Military Academy from March
1, 1875, to August 28, 1879. He retired on May 6, 1892, as a Lieutenant Colonel (Figure 4).
Beaumont died at the age of 78 in Harvey’s Lake, Pennsylvania. He was buried in Hollenback
Cemetery in his hometown of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania (Figure 5).

William O’Connell (date unknown)
William O’Connell was born in Ireland and served as an enlisted man in the Dragoon
Detachment at the U.S. Military Academy. In April 1855, he transferred to the 1st U. S. Cavalry.
O’Connell was promoted to First Sergeant in June 1855. He served at Fort Leavenworth in 1857 and
participated in the Cheyenne and Utah expeditions of 1857 and 1858. He also served at Fort Riley,
Fort Smith, Indian Territory, and Fort Arbuckle. In 1860, he engaged in the Kiowa and Comanche
Indian expedition and later participated in the Battle of Wilson’s Creek, Missouri.

36

VOLUME 1 (2014)

In October 1861, he was promoted to Second Lieutenant in the 4th U.S Cavalry and attained
First Lieutenant in 1862. O’Connell served with the Army of the Potomac in Maryland and Virginia
in 1863 and the Army of the Cumberland in 1863. He commanded a regiment in Alabama and
Georgia from March to May 1865, and was transferred to Texas in 1866; he was promoted to Captain
in 1869. O’ Connell was awarded Brevet Captain for gallant and meritorious services in action at
Middleton, Tennessee, and Brevet Major for gallant and meritorious services at the capture of Selma,
Alabama. He was stationed at Post of Lampasas, Texas, in 1870 and later transferred to Fort Concho
(Henry 1873:160). Captain O’Connell was described as one of the best old Irish soldiers in the U.S.
Army (Carter 1935:35). He died in 1895 and was interred in the San Francisco National Cemetery,
California.

Significant Events
May 1867 to January 1868: Post Established
Post Lampasas was established May 30, 1867, per Special Order No. 50. The 26th Infantry,
Company K was then stationed at the post. A skirmish with citizens occurred at 10 p.m. on June 17 in
which 2nd Lieutenant Roe and 16 men participated. 1st Sergeant George C. Lyon and Private Track
were wounded. Private Henry Pearson died June 4, 1867 of typhoid fever. Private Pearson is likely
still buried at the post. Private Daniel Jones, Company L 6th U.S. Calvary, died at the post on
September 17, 1867, from wounds received while in discharge of duty on August 17, 1867, near
Lampasas, Texas. Private Jones is likely also still buried at the post. The incident is recorded in the
Georgetown Watchman, which describes the shooting of Mr. Jackson, a local merchant, “and probably
the death of a soldier” killed by “three men, who were armed each with a double-barreled gun and
two six-shooters. They had just before driven away the inmates of a house in the suburbs of the town
[Lampasas] and robbed it. They resisted, and a running fight ensued, in which Mr. Jackson was shot
dead, and one of the soldiers shot through the lungs”(GW, August 24, 1867). The post was evacuated
per Special Order No. 228 HQ District of Texas, Austin, Texas, on December 28, 1867. The 26th
Infantry, Company K then left Post Lampasas.

January 1868 to May 1869: Lost Post Returns
The 35th Infantry, Company H left this Post May 17, 1869. Complete Post returns for the 17th
and 35th Infantry units, which would show events during the period from January 1868 to May 1869,
were either not completed by the commander or were lost.

May 1869 to June 1870: Scouting Parties and Post Closure
The garrison had been employed in furnishing escorts and scouting parties to the Sheriff and other
civil authorities during this time period. Each of these is listed in further detail below:


Unsuccessful pursuit (May 25th, 1869): 2nd Lieutenant James H. Jones 4th Cavalry left on
May 22 with six men and a non-commissioned officer in an unsuccessful pursuit of J. W.
Nash (or J. McNash), an absconding Deputy Colonel of a Reserve unit from Burleson
County.

37

JOURNAL OF TEXAS ARCHEOLOGY AND HISTORY.ORG



First scout (June 17, 1869): a detailed 10 day route of scout consisting of 26 enlisted men and
one officer is provided under Record of Events. The scout covered 200 miles and traversed
west to the San Saba area, north to the abandoned Civil War Confederate Camp Colorado
(south of Brownwood), northeast across Pecan Bayou, south to San Saba, and then returned
to Post Lampasas. No Indian signs were discovered.



Second scout (June 28, 1869): approximately 20 men left the post in an unsuccessful pursuit
of Indians that were reported to have attacked herders and driven off 100 horses 10 miles
from the post. The distance traveled was 200 miles.



Third scout (March 14, 1870): Captain E. B. Beaumont, 2nd Lieutenant James H. Jones, and
25 enlisted men left the post on a scout for Indians. The detachment proceeded to Antelope
Gap, Lampasas County, a distance of 25 miles and there encamped. Five Indians with more
were seen but the soldiers did not camp for want of a competent guide with the detachment.
The scout returned to the post on March 19, 1870, for want of forage after marching a
distance of 85 miles.



Fourth scout (April 13, 1870): 2nd Lieutenant James H. Jones, 4th U.S. Cavalry, with a
detachment of 25 enlisted men left the post to watch the mountain passes at Antelope Gap,
Lampasas County, with the intent of intercepting bands of hostile Indians. The detachment
was out 10 days and returned for want of forage. No Indians were seen or heard during the
distance marched, over 90 miles.



Fifth scout (May 18, 1870): A small scouting party consisting of two non-commissioned
officers and nine privates from Company M, 4th Cavalry, was sent out under command of
2nd Lieutenant (Brevet Major) William Russell (Figure 6) in pursuit of Indians. The Indians
were overtaken at Mount Adam, Lampasas, Texas, on May 14, 1870, at about 2 p.m. and in
the ensuing skirmish 2nd Lieutenant Russell was mortally wounded. The scout returned to
the post on May 15, having traveled about 80 miles. Two privates of Company M, 4th
Cavalry, were slightly wounded, one horse was killed, and two horses were wounded.

Second Lieutenant Russell died at midnight, May 15th, in the line of duty. The surgeon’s report
indicated “the ball from a Remington revolver, entered just beneath the tenth rib of the right side, at
about four inches from the vertebral column” and that “a citizen extracted the ball by incision some
two hours before the writer arrived upon the spot. There had been extensive hemorrhage” (Otis
1871:51). The surgeon decided an autopsy would be impractical but suggested the ball likely
penetrated Russell’s liver, and the immediate causes of death seem to have been the shock of the
injury and the hemorrhage (Otis 1871:51). Second Lieutenant Russell was initially buried at Post
Lampasas but was moved two years later and interred at Albany Rural Cemetery, Albany, New York.
This incident was covered by numerous Texas newspapers such as the Belton Weekly Journal, which
reported the particulars of this sad event:

38

After the charge, the Major seeing the unequal position, ordered ‘dismount and retreat in
front of horses’ which gave evidence of discretion and coolness; but most unfortunately as
he was in the act of alighting he received a mortal wound which took effect in the region of
the liver. The Commander being thus cut down so early in the action, of course, gave rise to
more or less confusion; consequently the fighting ceased and the Indians in a manner were
the victors. However, the general impression of those who were present is, that had not the
gallant Major been so unfortunate at the particular crisis he would have whipped them and
recaptured all the stolen property (The Belton Weekly Journal, May 28, 1870).

DISCUSSION
Post Lampasas was established by the U.S. Army at the request of citizens of Lampasas County
for the purpose of providing frontier protection to residents who suffered continual attacks from both
Comanches and outlaw gangs. Despite being undermanned at times, the troops stationed there did an
exemplary job performing their mission during the three years (1867-1870) the post was active.

39

JOURNAL OF TEXAS ARCHEOLOGY AND HISTORY.ORG

The analysis of the post returns was a key factor in providing a clear understanding of this
Reconstruction era post on the frontier that has never been fully researched and studied by historians.
The post returns revealed that Post Lampasas was anything but a temporary encampment that was
sporadically utilized as a campsite with no permanent buildings (cf. O’Neal 2012:25). On the
contrary, the post returns suggest this installation was in fact a well-established U.S. Army Post that
was permanently occupied between 1867 to 1870 by hundreds of soldiers from two infantry and two
cavalry companies. Post returns revealed that these troops were active building stables and other
infrastructure. This likely indicates that Post Lampasas would have had a number of permanent
wooden structures (with rock fireplaces) used to house troops during the approximately three years of
occupation.
While the exact location of Post Lampasas was never mentioned in the post returns, I was able to
ascertain its location by assembling strong circumstantial evidence uncovered in newspaper reports
and the Post Return Officer Roster. The key to confirming the location was found in a newspaper
article in the Georgetown Watchman. The newspaper article states “Col. Stevens is in command here
with two companies Infantry and one of Cavalry. They have a beautiful camp around the oaks at the
upper springs” (GW, 8 May 1869). This Colonel Stevens is in all likelihood 1st Lieutenant (Brevet
Captain) Thomas Stevens, who commanded Company H, 35th Infantry while the unit was stationed
at Post Lampasas and left May 17, 1869, just nine days after this newspaper article was released. Also,
this article mentions that the post is located around the oaks of the Upper Springs. The name Upper
Springs is another key in locating the post.
Historian Bill O’Neal (2012:3) writes that in Lampasas “…to the southwest, in a magnificent
grove of shade trees, was a bubbling spring with the greatest flow in the area. Because of the location
it was often called the Upper Springs; because of its bubbling action (not its brisk, cool temperature) it
was sometimes known as the Great Boiling Spring; it also occasionally was called Rock Springs. But
within a few years it would become Hancock Springs, after settler John Hancock acquired the
property.” Accordingly, Upper Springs is most likely one and the same as Hancock Springs, and the
presence of 1st Lieutenant Stevens mentioned above confirms that Post Lampasas is at this location.
Since the post was abandoned in 1870, the current area around Hancock Springs (Figure 7) has been
significantly altered with a golf course, roads, buildings, and parking lots covering much of the area.
However, it cannot be ruled out that remains of the original Post Lampasas including such features as
building foundations, piles of rock from toppled chimneys, activity areas, and other features remain
hidden in the ground waiting to be discovered through archeological investigations.
The analysis of post returns has led to the discovery and reporting of the existence of this
previously unknown Reconstruction era U.S. Army post. It is hoped that by demonstrating the
importance of these documents, more historians and scholars will utilize this primary source material
that has been digitized and is now easily accessible. When combined with traditional secondary
source materials, researchers studying historic U.S. Army garrisons should arrive at a more accurate
understanding of what was actually taking place at these historically significant sites, clearing a path
for future research.

EVIDENCE FOR A LONG-DISTANCE TRADE IN
BOIS D’ARC BOWS IN 16 TH CENTURY TEXAS
(MACLURA POMIFERA, MORACEAE)
Leslie L. Bush

ABSTRACT
A piece of wood charcoal identified as bois d’arc (Maclura pomifera) was
recovered from the Janee site (41MN33) in Menard County, Texas. The
specimen has been directly dated to 400 ± 30 B.P., a period when no
naturally-occurring bois d’arc stands are believed to have been present within
400 miles of the site. Bois d’arc ecology, economic uses of bois d’arc wood,
and historical accounts of bois d’arc trade indicate the specimen is best
interpreted as part of a trade item related to Caddo bow-making traditions in
Northeast Texas and adjacent areas of other states.

INTRODUCTION
A single fragment of bois d’arc wood charcoal was recovered from Feature 2-B at the Janee site
(41MN33) on the Edwards Plateau of Central Texas (Figure 1). A direct date on the specimen
produced a measured radiocarbon age of 400 ± 30 B.P. with a 13C/12C ratio of -25.1‰, resulting in a
conventional radiocarbon age of 400 ± 30 B.P. and 2 sigma calibrated age ranges of A.D. 1440 to
1520 and A.D. 1590 to 1620 (Beta-305763). The Janee site lies on terrace 3-4 m above the San Saba
River near Menard, Texas, far outside what is typically cited as the range of bois d’arc trees during
that period. The feature in which the bois d’arc was found belongs to a thick (25 cm) buried Toyah
phase component with well-defined activity areas (Arnn 2007:393). The feature represents the
remnant of a large burned rock feature, most of which was destroyed in the backhoe trench (BHT 5)
that revealed the cultural deposits (Arnn 2007:396). The site is interpreted as a “broad spectrum
hunter-gatherer residential base” (Arnn 2007:403). This article discusses the probable origin and use of
the bois d’arc specimen in light of the evolutionary ecology of bois d’arc and historic accounts of its
use and trade in the North American midcontinent.

BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY OF BOIS D’ARC
The tree known botanically as Maclura pomifera has many common names, including bois d’arc,
bodark, bowwood, Osage-orange, yellowwood, hedge-apple, horse-apple, monkey balls, and Indiana
brains. It is a small deciduous tree with wind-pollinated male and female flowers produced on
separate individuals, which can be completely separate trees or separate stems within a single stand of

trees (Bonner 2008) (Figure 2). Bois d’arc fruits are large (8-15 cm diameter) syncarps, aggregate fruits
composed of single-seeded drupelets (Figure 3). Each fruit can thus have several male and female
seeds, making it possible for a single fruit to generate a fertile stand of trees (Burton 1990; Carey 1994;
Coder 1999; Smith and Perino 1981; Starr et al. 2003). Sterile fruits are also possible, however, when a
female tree is not fertilized. The coarse fruits contain latex, which renders them unpleasantly sticky to
most people. Bois d’arc fruits require contact with bare soil for germination and sunlight. The growing
plants require direct sunlight, and sources agree that even mature bois d’arc is shade intolerant (Carey
1994; Smith and Perino 1981). Hence, it is not a tree of climax forests (Burton 1990; Smith and Perino
1981:30) Bois d’arc prefers deep bottomland soils such as those associated with forest edges or stream
channels, but its taproot helps it tolerate a wide variety of situations as long as the requirements for
bare soil and light are met (Elias 1980:257). Bois d’arc branches typically have thorns, although
thornless cultivars exist today (Coder 1999). The branches are often curved or crooked (Coder 1999;
Smith and Perino 1981:28), but the tree sprouts after cutting (coppice growth), typically providing
straight wood under those circumstances (Carey 1994; Coder 1999; Starr et al. 2003). Bois d’arc wood
is dense, with a specific gravity of 0.81 at 12 percent moisture (Hoadley 1990:Table 5.1). The wood is
deep orange in color and highly resistant to decay thanks to the antifungal agents in the wood
(Hoadley 1990; Smith and Perino 1981:34). Bois d’arc wood has extremely high strength and
toughness under bending pressure. At 261 kilojoules per cubic meter (kJ/m3), the work-to-maximum
load value for bois d’arc is the highest of any wood for which the USDA Forest Service provides data
(Table 1), making it particularly suitable for use in bow making (Hamilton 1982).

BOIS D’ARC AS AN ECONOMIC PLANT
Since its discovery by Euro-Americans in the early 19th century, bois d’arc trees have been
commonly used as hedge plants. Their tough, durable wood has been in demand for fence posts,
railway ties, and wooden wheels (Smith and Perino 1981; Westbrook 1973). Bois d’arc wood and root
bark make yellow dye (Smith and Perino 1981). The coarse, sticky fruits are not considered edible by

humans, but they are not toxic to horses and cattle (Smith and Perino 1981:33-34). Proteolytic
enzymes are found in the fruits, which makes them valuable in processes such as cheese-making and
tenderizing meat that involve breaking down proteins into peptides or amino acids (Smith and Perino
1981:33). The fruits are widely considered to repel cockroaches (Ball 2000; Peattie 2007; Smith and
Perino 1981; Turner 2009).
Bois d’arc’s principal use among Native Americans gives the plant its common name. “Wood of
the bow” was so named by the French explorers, soldiers, and trappers who were the first European
inhabitants of the region where bois d’arc grew. Nineteenth century observers indicate that bois d’arc
bows were highly prized on the American plains (Moerman 1998), and many authorities consider bois
d’arc one of the two best bow woods in the world (Schambach 1995:11). In 1810, John Bradbury

reported that the cost of a bow made from bois d’arc for Arikara Indians was a horse and a blanket.
He described war clubs made of the same wood (Bradbury 1817:159-160). Prince Maximilian of
Wied-Neuwied reported that Blackfeet Indians of Montana bartered for bois d’arc bows in the 1830s
(Peattie 2007:387). On September 8, 1853, Lieutenant A. W. Whipple encountered a group of Kiowas
on the Llano Estacado with outstanding bois d’arc bows (Whipple 1856:32). Archeological evidence
indicates a long tradition of such use of the wood; an Early Caddo period (ca. A.D. 1000-1200) bow
reportedly made from bois d’arc was excavated at the Mounds Plantation site (16CD12) in Caddo
Parish, Louisiana (Webb and McKinney 1963, 1975). A few uses of bois d’arc for purposes other than
bows are known among Native people. Kiowas and Pimas used the roots and wood for dye, and
Comanches used a decoction of the root as an eyewash (Moerman 1998).

BOIS D’ARC RANGE
Pre-Holocene
Just as bois d’arc biology is unusual, so is its history, or at least what is known of its history. Ann
Early (2000) pointed out more than a decade ago that much less is known about the evolutionary and
geographical history of bois d’arc than is generally realized. Although recent progress has been made

*good bow wood, probably not present in Central Texas at the advent of bow technology.
in distinguishing pollen from different genera of the botanical family to which bois d’arc belongs
(Moraceae) (Burn and Mayle 2008), pollen studies frequently include both Morus (mulberry) and
Maclura in a single category (sometimes with the Urticaceae [nettle family] as well), rendering them
less than useful for understanding the prehistoric range of Maclura. Researchers thus rely on the record
of fossil woods, leaves, and fruits.
Widely-cited secondary sources indicate an extensive Pleistocene range for the genus Maclura in
North America (e.g., Barlow 2000; Peattie 2007). Examination of the primary sources, however,
reveals the wide range to be an extrapolation from a very few data points. Hugo Martínez-Cabrera
and colleagues report fossil woods from early Miocene sediments in Baja California that may be
ancestral to Maclura tinctoria, the species of Maclura found today in the Caribbean, Mexico, and
Central and South America (Martínez-Cabrera et al. 2006). Theodore Delevoryas (1964:584)

55

JOURNAL OF TEXAS ARCHEOLOGY AND HISTORY.ORG

identifies “a multiple fruit, most closely allied to the Moraceae” from Upper Cretaceous deposits in
South Dakota. Perhaps the most commonly cited finding for determining the Pleistocene range of bois
d’arc is the presence of Maclura pomifera leaves and/or wood in the Don Beds in Ontario (Coleman
1933:9-10; Terasmae 1960; Woodcock 1989). The deposits date to the last interglacial period,
125,000-75,000 years ago (Woodcock 1989). The Don Beds wood in general is characterized as
decaying and much flattened by glaciers (Coleman 1933:9), but the leaves are not described, and the
criteria for identification of individual wood and leaf taxa are not discussed. It appears that D. P.
Penhallow, the botanist at McGill University who made the initial identifications, passed away prior
to completion of the project (Coleman 1933:9). Two successor botanists are mentioned, Arthur
Hollick and J. H. White, and they may have confirmed Penhallow’s identifications. Fossil Maclura is
known outside North America as well (Cheng et al. 2011).

Pleistocene-Holocene Transition
These spotty and imprecise records undergird the current theory that the genus Maclura had a
wide distribution during the Pleistocene, with M. pomifera extending into what is now southern
Canada and M. tinctoria (or its ancestor) present in Mexico. Daniel Janzen and Paul Martin (1982)
have proposed that plants like bois d’arc were dispersed by Pleistocene megafauna. Although they
mention bois d’arc only in passing, their theory has such explanatory power that it has been widely
adopted for that species (Barlow 2000; Bonner 2008; Peattie 2007; Turner 2009). As North American
populations of the dispersal organisms to which Maclura is adapted became reduced and eventually
extinct (e.g., Pleistocene horses and camels), so Maclura’s distribution shrank over the Holocene. As
discussed below, historic records that explicitly refer to bois d’arc date to the early years of the 19th
century, by which time its range seems to have been restricted to a small area in Northeast Texas and
adjacent parts of Arkansas and Oklahoma.
The Janzen-Martin hypothesis has the virtue of explaining several oddities about bois d’arc. The
large fruits are poorly dispersed by the small animals that are attracted to them today (Smith and
Perino 1981). The larger animals (i.e., bison) available to disperse large fruits during most of the
Holocene apparently cannot consume bois d’arc fruits because they lack upper incisors (Barlow 2000).
Although the tree can grow over a very wide swath of the North American continent under Holocene
conditions, it apparently did not do so until it was planted extensively in the second half of the 19th
century. Even in conditions where bois d’arc has naturalized after an initial planting, reports of its
continued reproductive success are mixed. Starr et al. (2003) argue that bois d’arc should be
considered invasive in Hawai’i. They note bois d’arc is already prohibited as an invasive plant in
Elburn, Illinois, and it has become a pest in Italy (Starr et al. 2003). Clearly, bois d’arc is a good
pioneer species, but whether it is capable of persisting in a more mature landscape is unclear (Burton
1990; Coder 1999; Smith and Perino 1981). Bois d’arc stands were being shaded out by oaks in
Hueston Woods State Park in Ohio as of 1981 (Smith and Perino 1981).

56

VOLUME 1 (2014)

On the Possibility of Pleistocene Remnant Populations
Several logical possibilities exist for the origin of the bois d’arc specimen at the Janee site. One is
that it derives from Pleistocene refuge stands of bois d’arc that could, theoretically, have been present
in West Texas during Toyah phase times. Anomalous stands of bois d’arc are known in Trans-Pecos
Texas, for example in the Chisos Mountains and various locations around Marathon, Texas (Powell
1998:100-101; Roberts 2011; Simpson 1999:195; Turner et al. 2003; Wilson 1966:228). Some Chisos
Mountain trees, notably Texas pinyon (Pinus remota), are believed to represent species that have
managed to survive in small patches of microclimates to which they are well-suited (refugia) since
Pleistocene times (Lanner and Van Devender 2000:173-174). The bois d’arc populations in West
Texas do not have indicators of great antiquity in these locations, however. Botanists collecting the
specimens have not indicated morphological differences between the West Texas and East Texas
specimens that could be expected to have accumulated over a separation of 12 millennia. The Chisos
Mountains specimens were collected in the 1930s and the identification re-checked by Dr. B. L.
Turner in 2006 (TEX-LL 2007). To my knowledge, no archeological or geological specimens of Early
or Middle Holocene-age bois d’arc have been recovered in Texas. Linguistic evidence also argues
against great antiquity for these stands. The only Spanish name for bois d’arc I am aware of indicates
an exotic origin for the plant: Naranjo Chino. Although its taproot makes bois d’arc relatively drought
tolerant once established, even springs in West Texas may not provide enough moisture for long-term
survival: of the 12 West Texas stands of bois d’arc known in the 1930s, only seven were alive in 2009
(Roberts 2011). Finally, bois d’arc populations are less numerous and contain fewer individuals than
the more certain refugia populations of pinyon in West Texas (Thomas Alex, personal
communication, September 6, 2011).

On the Possibility of Holocene Native American Bois d’Arc Arboriculture
Since the success of modern plantings indicate bois d’arc is capable of growing over a much larger
range than it did in the early 19th century, and Native Americans quickly adopted tree crops such as
peaches (Gremillion 1993), the question of why Native Americans (apparently) did not plant this
economically valuable tree deserves serious consideration. Frank Schambach, one of the few
researchers who has approached the question, proposes a radically restricted range for bois d’arc
trees—confined to Bois d’Arc Creek in Fannin County, Texas—that came under the control of a
group that monopolized the resource for economic and political advantage during the Late Prehistoric
(Schambach 1995). Although she comes to a slightly different conclusion about the Late Prehistoric
range of bois d’arc trees, Ann Early also considers the possibility of Native American planting. She
reviews historic accounts and General Land Office Records and concludes that bois d’arc range in the
early historic period extended at least into the Little Missouri River valley if not the Arkansas River
valley in Arkansas (Early 2000:108). She suggests that Caddo agricultural plots provided optimal
growing conditions for casually-introduced bois d’arc fruits (Early 2000:110). Deliberate establishment
of bois d’arc stands would require a great deal of effort, and the deposition of a fertile fruit or viable
cutting at exactly the right spot for optimum growth would likely provide only a fairly slim chance of
a reward in bow wood 10-15 years in the future (Early 2000).

The possibility of deliberately-introduced bois d’arc stands becomes correspondingly less probable
in the less hospitable climate of West Texas. As noted above, small stands of bois d’arc currently exist
in West Texas. Bois d’arc trees fruit for only about 75 years (Burton 1990; Coder 1999) and the oldest
known trees are less than 200 years old (Smith and Perino 1981:28). Transplanted bois d’arc
populations in West Texas must therefore have reproduced over several generations if they represent
Late Prehistoric plantings. Many historically-known stands of bois d’arc died in the drought of the
1950s, suggesting the trees would not have survived through severe Late Prehistoric droughts such as
those of the 12th and 16th centuries A.D. (Stahle et al. 2000; Woodhouse et al. 2010). (It should be
noted, however, that the population at Bois D’Arc Springs in the Chisos Mountains, documented in
1937, survived the drought of the 1950s, and was still alive as of July 2011 [Thomas Alex, personal
communication, September 6, 2011]). Perhaps more significantly, the wood from these bois d’arc
stands, located far from their optimal habitat, is small and brittle, and thus ill-suited to bow-making
(Thomas Alex, personal communication, September 6, 2011).

17th Century
The earliest historic reference to bois d’arc is believed to be that of Henri Joutel, who notes a bowmaking tradition in the Texas-Oklahoma-Arkansas-Louisiana area in 1687. He indicates that the
wood is of excellent quality for bow-making (“du bois très proper à en faire [les arcs]”), that people
travel great distances (50 or 60 leagues) to obtain the bows, and that the tree grows in quantity in the
area (Margry 1879:412). Neither the wood nor the tree from which it came are named or described,
however, either in the most recent English translation (Foster 1998:248) or in the French printed
editions (DeMichel 1713:282; Margry 1879:412, 424). Joutel’s omission is odd since he was
reportedly the son of a gardener (Harisse 1872:165), and he took the trouble to describe a sweetgum
tree that La Salle had marked near the Trinity River (Foster 1998:202, fn22) and palm trees near
Garcitas Creek (Foster 1998:124). It seems likely that Joutel did not actually encounter a bois d’arc
tree himself but only the bows or talk of bows. Ann Early (2000:102) points out it is possible that the
entire bow-trading episode was inserted into Joutel’s published account by the editors from Henry de
Tonti’s account of the expedition or a forged account falsely attributed to Tonti that circulated in Paris
prior to 1713 (Delanglez 1985). To determine whether the episode was inserted into Joutel’s account
by an editor, a copy of the Joutel manuscript in the United States Library of Congress was examined
but found to be inconclusive: the notebook covering the period of the Joutel’s first mention of the bow
trade (Cahier 14) was missing from the French National Marine archives at the time of transcription
(Joutel 1684-1687) (Figure 4). A second reference to the bow trade is present, however, in the
manuscript and in the Margry edition (Margry 1879:424). Although the notebook is missing, the first
episode seems plausible given the second manuscript reference, the early 19th century distribution of
bois d’arc, the suitability of bois d’arc for bow making, and a probable history of bois d’arc bows in
the area as evidenced by an Early Caddo bow reportedly made from bois d’arc recovered at Mounds
Plantation in Caddo Parish, Louisiana (Webb and McKinney 1963, 1975).

18th Century
Although there are few to no historic records of bois d’arc for the 18th century, it is likely that bois
d’arc expanded its range into West Texas during this time. Horses became common among Native
American communities in Texas at the turn of the 18th century, re-introducing a possible large
mammal dispersal agent for bois d’arc populations. In his 1846 journal, Ferdinand Roemer indicates
travelers progressed through Texas on horseback at about 40 miles per day (Roemer 2011:61). Horses
have a gut rate of about 24 hours (Town and Country Veterinary Hospital, personal communication,
2011). Bois d’arc stands reproduce after about 10 years (Smith and Perino 1981). Calculations from
these data point to a maximum rate of advance for bois d‘arc populations of about 40 miles per decade
or four miles per year. In this scenario, the earliest bois d’arc could possibly become horse-dispersed in
Menard is about 1804. Thus, the West Texas stands of bois d’arc could have become established prior
to most European settlement but after the collapse of Toyah/Caddo trade networks.

19th Century (Early)
After 1803, historic references to bois d’arc become numerous. Meriwether Lewis famously sent
bois d’arc samplings, which had been transplanted at an Osage village, to President Thomas Jefferson
in 1804, with a note that their original source was 300 miles away, presumably on the Red River
(Jurney 1995; Turner 2009). William Dunbar and George Hunter reported bois d’arc in the Ouachita
River valley in 1804 (Early 2000:103; Jurney 1995). Peter Custis saw a very large specimen near
Natchitoches in 1806 that may have been transplanted (Flores 1984:260). Anthony Glass described
the first large wild stands in 1807 on the Red River, including the population on Bois D’Arc Creek
that Schambach believes was the post-Pleistocene remnant population (Early 2000:106; Jurney 1995).
Smith and Perino (1981:Figure 2) noted that the extent of the “natural” range of bois d’arc was
not known and provided four possible native distributions, all of which included Northeast
Texas/Southwest Arkansas and two of which centered on that region. Later authors’ examinations of
documentary evidence have clarified the probable distribution of bois d’arc, at least as of 1860 in
Texas.
Archeologist David Jurney (1995) and historian Del Weniger (1996) attempted to reconstruct the
early historic and late prehistoric range of bois d’arc trees. Their efforts have focused on Texas, using
historical accounts and General Land Office records prior to 1860. Weniger restricts the range of bois
d’arc to 12 counties in Northeast Texas (Figure 5). Jurney (1995) comes to very nearly the same
conclusion but couches it in more satisfying ecological terms by naming the streams along which he
believes the major populations of bois d’arc were dispersed: the East Fork of the Trinity River and one
tributary, Rowlett Creek; the North Fork Sulphur River and some tributaries; and Bois D’Arc Creek,
a tributary of the Red River in Fannin and Lamar counties, Texas. In the absence of Pleistocene
megafauna, most authors believe water became the main dispersal agent of bois d’arc fruits (Barlow
2000; Jurney 1995). Weniger’s and Jurney’s findings may probably be extrapolated to areas
immediately across the Red River in Oklahoma and Arkansas.

19th Century (Late)
The Prairie Farmer magazine was instrumental in greatly expanding the range of bois d’arc in the
last half of the 19th century, when it began to promote the tree as a hedge plant (Turner 2009). The first
issue of Prairie Farmer in 1841 featured an editorial inquiry seeking information about such a use of
bois d’arc. Over the next 14 years, bois d’arc discussions become increasingly commonplace in the
journal, such that by 1855 another editorial attempted to settle the question of who should receive
primary credit for introducing bois d’arc as a hedge plant. Bois d’arc place names can be found today
throughout much of the United States, reflecting the success of the planting program. In fact, modern
visitors to the Janee site usually travel Bois D’Arc Road to reach it.

THE JANEE BOIS D’ARC SPECIMEN
Identification of bois d’arc from fossil specimens, including archeological specimens, typically
faces several difficulties, the most important of which is that identification is not usually made from
the entire plant but from one or more parts of it. Maclura pomifera wood is ring-porous and packed
with tyloses (Hoadley 1990; Panshin and deZeeuw 1980). It can be separated from mulberry (Morus
spp.) and locust (Robinia pseudoacacia and R. neomexicana), which share these characteristics, by the
presence of vestured intervessel pits (in Robinia) or crystals (in Maclura), or on the basis of ray seriation
(the number of cells across the widest point in a ray). Mulberry wood has the widest rays, typically 7-8
seriate, while black locust rays are usually 3-5 seriate and bois d’arc’s are 2-4 seriate (Hoadley 1990).
The Maclura specimen at Janee was identified on the criterion of ray seriation: it has rays that are
usually 2-3 seriate, with the largest rays being 4 seriate. It was not examined for the presence of
vestured intervessel pits or crystals, but since the range of Robinia pseudoacacia, another good bow

61

JOURNAL OF TEXAS ARCHEOLOGY AND HISTORY.ORG

wood, is even more distant from the Janee site than bois d’arc, and R. neomexicana is also distant (250
miles, in the Guadalupe Mountains) and at 12-15 feet in height too small to provide good bow wood,
examination of ray seriation is believed to be sufficient in this instance. Wood tissue of Maclura
tinctoria, the Central American species, is diffuse-porous and easily distinguishable from Morus,
Robinia, and Maclura pomifera in transverse section at low magnification.
Bois d’arc wood charcoal has been identified at post-A.D. 900 Caddo sites in East Texas,
including Stallings Ranch (41LR297), Henry M. (41NA60), and Murphy Branch (41MX5)
(Brewington et al. 1992; Bush 2008; Perttula et al. 2010). As discussed above, available evidence
indicates the range of bois d’arc did not include Central Texas during the early 16th century, when the
Janee specimen was growing. The question of how and why bois d’arc wood arrived at the Janee site
is thus more interesting than is usual for wood charcoal specimens on archeological sites.
Other woods identified at Janee are interpreted as fuel wood, both from their archeological
contexts (hearths) and their taxa identifications. The six wood charcoal samples identified consisted of
pecan, oak (red group, white group, and live group), mesquite, acacia, elm, and hoptree. These are all
types of trees that would have grown along the San Saba River or in the uplands nearby, and which
continue to grow in the area today. Both the transportation costs and properties of bois d’arc wood
argue strongly against its use as a fuel wood at the Janee site. The transportation costs of using nonlocal wood for fuel are generally prohibitive (Asch and Asch 1986; Shackleton and Prins 1992),
making the exotic bois d’arc an unlikely fuelwood. Further, although its wood is very dense,
producing high heat and good coals, bois d’arc also produces so many sparks that it makes a distinctly
unpleasant firewood (Graves 1919; Smith and Perino 1981:33). Given the probable range of bois d’arc
in the early 16th century and the wood’s historically-documented uses among Native Americans, the
Janee bois d’arc specimen was probably part of a bow or a stave for bow making.
Early historic trade routes between East Texas and La Junta (the confluence of the Rio Conchos
and the Rio Grande) are documented through the Menard area, making it possible to identify the
traders and the routes they traveled into Northeast Texas where the bows or their raw material would
have been available. Arnn (2007:218, 420 and Figure 10.2) emphasizes the frequency and routine
nature of travels by Jumanos between La Junta and Caddo villages in Northeast Texas. Exotic items
other than bois d’arc were recovered from Janee in the form of arrow points (Arnn 2007:361), and
exotic items are known from other Toyah phase sites in the area as well (Arnn 2007:359). Arnn
proposes a continuity between the Late Prehistoric Toyah in this area and historic Jumano traders.
Mariah Wade (2003:221, 248, note 44) notes that one sub-group of the Jumanos were known as the
Good Bows (Arcos Buenos; also Arcos Fuertes or Arcos Tuertos or Los que Hacen Arcos). The
“twisted” bows of this group are also referred to as “Turkish” bows; the term apparently describes a
re-curved or double-curved bow. Double-curving does not necessarily make for a good bow (Hamilton
1982:6) but use of bois d’arc wood often does. Given the known location of large bois d’arc
populations in Northeast Texas and the early historic evidence that Jumano traders with good bows
traveled through the Janee site area, it seems likely that the bois d’arc fragment at Janee is best
interpreted as part of a trade item from Northeast Texas, a bow or stave intended for bow-making.

DEFLATION TROUGHS, WATER, AND PREHISTORIC
OCCUPATION ON THE MARGINS OF THE
SOUTH TEXAS SAND SHEET
Juan L. González, Russell K. Skowronek, and Bobbie Lovett

ABSTRACT
Within the South Texas Plains, the area broadly defined by the Rio Grande to
the south and the Nueces River to the north, a distance of ca. 175 km,
evidence of open human occupation is remarkably abundant. Because it is
predominantly a region of loose, sandy soils and active and relict sand dunes
where wind processes dominate, the area is known as the South Texas Sand
Sheet (STSS). There is no running water within the STSS and all streams are
ephemeral. Existing drainage systems are small, localized, and not integrated,
carrying water for a few days and up to two weeks after the passage of a
storm. The lack of running water makes human occupation on this semi-arid
area even more remarkable. The STSS and the adjacent wind deflated areas
have hundreds of small and shallow elongated deflation troughs. Most of
these poorly drained swales retain seasonal fresh water that sustain high
moisture plants and are ephemeral wetlands; a small percentage of them hold
water year round. As a result, the long history of human occupation of the
STSS was possible due to the presence of the deflation troughs. This study
explores the connection between human occupation of the STSS and deflation
troughs at four previously unreported archeological sites in northern Hidalgo
County using a combination of intensive archeological and geological survey,
oral history, GIS technology, and existing soil maps.

INTRODUCTION
Located in the central part of the general area defined by the Rio Grande to the south and the
Nueces River to the north is the South Texas Sand Sheet (STSS) occupying an area of approximately
4,200 km2 of predominantly loose, sandy soils, and active and relict sand dunes where wind processes
are dominant. The STSS includes most of Kenedy and Brooks counties, and parts of northern Hidalgo
and northwestern Willacy counties (Figure 1). There is no running water within the STSS or the areas
adjacent to it; all streams are ephemeral, carrying water only for a few days to a few weeks after the
passage of a storm (Brown et al. 1980). The area is considered a subtropical desert with limited
precipitation and high summer temperatures. In the interior away from the gallery forests that line the

two bounding rivers and their adjacent resacas, vegetation cover consists mostly of sparse grasses and
brush; stands of live oak trees cover most of the relict dunes and provide the only shade in the sand
sheet. Deflation (wind erosion) is evident on the land surface in the form of hundreds of small,
shallow, deflation troughs across the STSS and adjacent areas, and these serve as temporary water
reservoirs following occasional heavy rains. Areas north and south of the STSS lack loose sediments
but are also subject to wind erosion. In the study area, located outside the STSS in central Hidalgo
County, the surface geology is a deeply deflated bedrock surface of the Pleistocene Beaumont
Formation. North of the STSS, in the vicinity of Baffin Bay, deflation troughs are abundant on the
surface of the Pliocene Goliad Formation.
Despite the lack of running water and high temperatures for much of the year, evidence of human
use and occupation of the STSS and deflated areas that border it is remarkably abundant and extends
back to ca. 3500-6000 B.C. This research study from an area outside the STSS, where running water is
absent and deflation is the dominant geologic process, can be used to explain the long history of
human occupation of this harsh environment. We contend that human occupation was made possible
by natural water storage in deflation troughs following heavy rains.

CLIMATIC CHARACTER OF THE STSS
There is a climatological gradient along the STSS with a reduction in rainfall from north to south
and east to west (Figure 2) (Norwine et al. 1978; Le Houerone and Norwine 1988). Average annual
rainfall for Kleberg and Kenedy counties in the northeast is 67.6 cm and 67.3 cm, respectively, while
Willacy and Hidalgo counties in the south receive 65.5 and 50.5 cm (Brown and Macon 1977; Brown
et al. 1980). Over 55 percent of the precipitation occurs between May and September when ca. 65
percent of the days have temperatures greater than 32 degrees C, enhancing evaporative losses
(Southern Regional Climate Center 2014). Precipitation is often bimodal with peak amounts in MayJune and September-October, the later period associated with tropical storms (Norwine et al. 1978; Le
Houerone and Norwine 1988). Across the STSS annual evaporation values range from 50 to 70 cm,
matching and sometimes exceeding precipitation values; thus there is a water deficit throughout the
STSS (Brown et al. 1980).

WIND EROSION AND DEFLATION TROUGHS
The landscape of the STSS is shaped by both wind deposition and deflation; much of the sheet is
covered with active dune complexes that migrate under the influence of the prevailing southeasterly
winds. According to Brown and Macon (1977), in areas underlain by a shallow water table the
amount of deflation is controlled by soil moisture derived from the intersected water table. Where this
occurs, the land surface is marked with hundreds of small, 50 to 500 m diameter, circular, oval, or
irregularly-shaped deflation troughs that average 1.0 m in depth (Figure 3). Such is the case in parts of
southern Brooks County and in western Kenedy County, where deflation troughs are the most
conspicuous geomorphic element of the landscape, reaching densities of 10 troughs per km2.

Observations from exploratory boreholes drilled in central Hidalgo County indicate that the water
table is often deeper than 3.5 m and thus we favor the idea that eolian erosive forces are stymied when

underlying clay and clay/loam substrate soil layers are encountered (Hernandez-Salinas et al. 2012;
Garcia et al. 2014). Most of these poorly drained swales hold water only after the passage of a storm.
A small percentage of them retain some water year-round and become ephemeral wetlands that
sustain high-moisture plants like California bulrush, common three-square bulrush, spikerushes,
flatsedges, cattails, white-topped sedge, paspalums, and gulf cordgrass (Texas Coastal Sand Sheet
Wetlands 2014). Water levels fluctuate during the course of the year depending on seasonal rains and
tropical storms: a graphic example is shown in Figure 4 for a small area in central Hidalgo County

(centered around Lat. 26°32′27.37″N. Long. 97°57′27.32″W). The four deflation troughs in the images retain water
during wet years (1962, 2009, and 2010), and shrink during drought years (1950, 1995, 2003, 2005, and 2012).
It is unclear when deflation started in the STSS and adjacent areas. In South Texas the Holocene
climate became increasingly arid as glaciations ended and sea level rose. Assessments of climate
stability using isotopic studies (Ricklis and Cox 1998), and geologic mapping (Price 1958; Fisk 1959;
Brown and Macon 1977, Brown et al. 1980; Russell 1981) have concluded that little variability in
climate occurred in the Holocene. More recently other studies have presented evidence suggesting
climatic instability. Forman et al. (2009) used luminescence dating to recognize two episodes of dune

74

VOLUME 1 (2014)

formation at 2700-2000 years B.P., most likely occurring with decreased ground cover caused by
climatic fluctuations, and 200 years B.P., likely associated with historic land use grazing practices.
Collins et al. (2011) used the distribution of time diagnostic projectile points to infer several climatic
intervals characterized by different moisture regimes. Furthermore, Hall et al. (1987) and Collins et al.
(1989) have suggested that Early to Middle Holocene erosion may have been fairly widespread. This
observation is supported with geomorphic evidence from 41HG118, where a gully eroded into a
Beaumont Formation knoll, the Pleistocene basement in the area, began to fill by 4500 ± 130
radiocarbon years B.P. (Beta-17434) (4835-5578 radiocarbon years B.P., calibrated at 2 sigma) B.P.
On these grounds we assume that deflation started at least by 8000 years B.P., if not at the onset of the
Holocene, and deflation troughs have been an important part of the landscape since then. Some
evidence, however, seems to indicate that at least some of the troughs may have been formed in the
Late Pleistocene, and may be inherently related to antecedent topography. Evidence for this include a
radiocarbon date from a fragment of a molar identified as Bison latifrons found in organic-rich
sediments from one trough north of Edinburg, Texas, excavated to increase water capacity (Armando
Vela, personal communication, August 2013). It yielded an age of 18,670 ± 45 radiocarbon years B.P.
(UGA-17416), (2 sigma calibrated age range of 22,670-22,930 radiocarbon years B.P.). In addition,
excavations of La Paloma site (41KN18) in Northern Kenedy County encountered Pleistocene fauna,
including mammoth, ground sloth, horse, and extinct bison (Suhm 1980), in close proximity to large
deflation troughs.

SOILS AND DEFLATION TROUGHS
The shape, dimensions, and general orientation of the deflation troughs are best observed on
satellite images and aerial photographs of the land surface (see Figure 3). But to understand why the
troughs can retain water and become temporary lakes, it is best to examine soil maps. The removal of
the top sandy soils by wind action causes the formation of depressions. The Soil Survey for Hidalgo
County (Jacobs 1981) describes a soil unit that is most common on deflation troughs throughout
Hidalgo County in an area south of the STSS where deflation is intense: soil unit 60, Rio clay loam
(Figure 5). Deflation troughs in neighboring Willacy County are characterized by soil unit 67,
Tiocano clay. Both soil types are described as poorly drained, with very low permeability, and high
water capacity. Areas of the land surface where these soils are exposed contain pond water from
runoff and most of the year are saturated with water.

Deflation Troughs as Water Reservoirs
In the STSS and peripheral deflated areas water collects in deflation troughs following rain events.
Observations made in the field confirmed that water starts ponding quickly during moderate rain
events, even after a prolonged drought (Figure 6a-b). In exceptional cases involving extreme rainfall,
water depths can exceed 1 m in some troughs. This was well documented when, following Hurricane
Beulah’s landfall in South Texas in 1967, many troughs retained water for more than a year. Once
filled with water the temporary ponds serve as haven for local fauna, offering not only a source for
food and water, but also ground cover for wildlife habitats and protection from predators. Waterfowl,
particularly ducks, gather at the larger depressions during the rainy season in September and October.

or elongated deflation troughs. This soil type has low permeability and high water capacity.

HUMAN OCCUPATION OF THE STSS
Evidence abounds of prehistoric human use and occupation of the STSS and adjacent areas where
deflation occurs and water is limited. The Texas Archeological Site Atlas indicates that there are more
than 300 recorded sites in Willacy, Kenedy, Brooks, and central Hidalgo counties (Table 1). This
record is biased, however, and underestimates the extent of occupation since the majority of the
reported sites occur along main highways, drainage canals, and transmission power lines, and they
were recorded as part of cultural resource management surveys. Beyond these survey projects, only a
handful of archeological sites have been excavated in the region (Mallouf et al. 1977:87; Day et al.
1981; Hall et al. 1987; Bousman et al. 1990; Kibler 1994; Hester 2004). These investigations have
revealed the archeological record in the STSS and adjacent areas to be characterized by poorly
stratified campsites, low preservation of non-lithic remains, and overall very sparse cultural remains
(Hester 2004:129). As a result, cultural chronology, subsistence strategies, and settlement patterns for
the sand sheet and adjacent water-limited areas remain poorly known. The lack of a reliable
radiocarbon chronology further hinders an understanding of the region’s prehistory. For these reasons
Ricklis (2004:177) described the area as “virtually unknown archeologically.”

There is limited environmental and cultural data suggesting a human presence in the STSS during
the Paleoindian and Early Archaic periods. At a site in Kenedy County (41KN18), located in the
northeastern part of the sand sheet, mammoth and bison bones were found close to several dart points
and one fluted lanceolate specimen. Suhm (1980) radiocarbon-dated four samples of mammoth bone,
only two of those yielded reliable ages: 9,560 ± 120 radiocarbon years B.P. (TX- 2195), (calibrated at
2 sigma to 10,575-11,202 radiocarbon years B.P.), and 9,830 ± 110 radiocarbon years B.P. (TX2196), (calibrated at 2 sigma to 10,794-11,709 radiocarbon years B.P.). An isolated Lerma projectile
point, dating from the Early Archaic period (3500-6000 B.C.), was reported by Mallouf et al.
(1977:167) on a site in Willacy County to the east of the sand sheet. Both Mallouf et al. (1977) and
Bousman et al. (1990) excavated a number of low-density sites in northern Hidalgo and Willacy
counties and their findings suggest a human presence from as early as the Early Archaic.
The later part of the Archaic period is also poorly represented and understood (Kibler 1994).
Early to Middle Archaic periods sites are rare, and Mallouf et al. (1977:118) suggest that the sparse
distribution of sites could be related to migrating aeolian deposits that have effectively buried cultural
deposits. Bousman et al. (1990) interpreted their rarity as being due to the onset of more xeric
conditions and to aeolian deflation of occupational surfaces during the Early and Middle Archaic
periods. Most evidence of prehistoric land use comes from surface-collected artifacts, primarily
unstemmed triangular thin bifaces, gouges, and stemmed dart points (Hall et al. 1987).
Late Archaic period sites are not infrequent in the region but often their components are mixed
with cultural materials from later Late Prehistoric assemblages. Hall et al. (1987) propose that it is
probably no coincidence that the apparent increase in sites during the Late Archaic is
contemporaneous with the beginning of landscape stability, in agreement with the chronologic data
that constrained eolian activity of the STSS (Forman et al. 2009). Finally, evidence of occupation
during the Late Prehistoric period is widespread. The Late Prehistoric period is defined by the
presence of small triangular arrow points on sites (Hester 1981, 2004:143-147).
Water as the limiting factor for human occupation of the STSS and neighboring areas was first
discussed by Mallouf et al. (1977) in a study prepared for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers assessing
the potential impact of drainage canal construction on cultural resources. In their predictive

78

VOLUME 1 (2014)

assessment of cultural resources in Hidalgo and Willacy counties, Mallouf et al. (1977:113)
recognized that the distribution of archeological sites was closely associated with the location of
deflation troughs as the only source of fresh water, remarking that “archeological sites are associated
with intermittent water supplies provided by the eolian plain depressions.”
The rapidly changing cultural environment that characterizes South Texas at the beginning of the
twenty-first century is rapidly erasing millennia of human occupation. These changes are serving as an
opportunity to reexamine Mallouf et al.’s (1977) observations regarding the juxtaposition of deflation
troughs, ponded water, and prehistoric archeological sites in the STSS and its margins.

IDENTIFICATION OF ARCHEOLOGICAL SITES
BY THE CHAPS PROGRAM
The Community Historical Archaeology Project with Schools (CHAPS) Program at The
University of Texas-Pan American reaches out to farmers and ranchers in northern Hidalgo County to
salvage the rapidly disappearing cultural heritage associated with this way of life. Collected
information includes oral histories focusing on natural disasters (hurricanes, floods, and droughts),
soil types, depth to the water table, and observed changes in flora and fauna. Archeological and
biological surveys are conducted of each property, while title searches trace the land use history of
each parcel to the era of Spanish colonial and more recent land grants. In the last three years, the
CHAPS Program has worked with four families (the Atwood, Eubanks, Norquest, and Sekula
families) around the city of Edinburg. These families have either a long farming tradition or work
history in agriculture and have found prehistoric lithic artifacts that can be precisely located on their
properties. Classifying these collections led to the identification of four previously undocumented
archeological sites and has enabled us to test the hypothesis that prehistoric human occupation in an
area adjacent to the STSS, where there is no running water, was possible because deflation troughs
provided temporary storage for rainwater.
For this project an area of approximately 70 km2 in central Hidalgo County (see Figure 1) was
studied using geographic information systems (GIS). The surface geology of this area, located just
south of the STSS and north of the Rio Grande and its associated resacas, consists of deflated
sandstones and siltstones of the Goliad Formation. It has a long history of human occupation and is
dotted with hundreds of small deflation troughs.
On a base map of Hidalgo County all areas that are known to flood during episodes of heavy rain
were plotted. Topographically, much of the pooled water coincides with circular, oval, or irregularlyshaped deflation troughs (Figure 7A). A plot of the distribution of the Rio clay loam soil for Hidalgo
County (Figure 7B), which matches the locations prone to flooding, validates the notion that
impermeable soils promote the ponding of rainwater in the wind-carved troughs. Next, each newly
discovered archeological site was plotted on the flood map, and a 5 km diameter collection catchment
circle was drawn around each site to indicate a one hour walk distance. Finally, a projectile point
chronology, using Turner et al. (2011), was built to provide an estimate on the history of occupation
for each site.

Norquest Site
Following their emigration from Sweden in the 1860s the Norquests arrived, by way of Nebraska,
in Edinburg in the 1920s. The Norquests have been engaged in commercial agriculture for the last 90
years. Evidence of a prehistoric human presence on what is today the Norquest’s farm includes an
assortment of projectile points, a whelk shell, and a stone pestle collected over years of farming. The
projectile point types found on the farm indicates continuous human presence from the Early Archaic
to the Late Prehistoric (Figure 8) (Hernandez-Salinas et al. 2012:22-24). The closest point of the Rio
Grande, the nearest source of running water, is 23 km away. There is a large northwest-southeastoriented deflation trough within the defined collection catchment circle associated with this site
(Figure 9). The flood map suggests that about 40 percent of the area contained within the collection
catchment circle would have been under water following heavy rains.

Atwood Site
The Atwood family has farmed their land since the 1920s. Only one diagnostic Hidalgo point,
dated to the Early Archaic period, has been found in their property (Figure 10) (Garcia et al. 2014).
This point is made of the distinctive El Sauz chert, which outcrops 62 km west of the Atwood’s farm
in Starr County (Gonzalez et al. n.d.). The Atwood property is located 4 km due west from the
Norquest farm, so the collection catchment circles for the two sites overlap. This site is located 21 km
from the Rio Grande. There are several large and small troughs that retain water within the 5 km
diameter circle around the site (see Figure 9).

Eubanks Site
The Eubanks have been in the citrus growing business since 1979. A large collection of whole and
broken points has been recovered from their orchard. Like the Norquest family collection, the
projectile points from the Eubanks farm spans the periods from the Early Archaic to the Late
Prehistoric (Figure 11) (Bacha-Garza 2014). The citrus grove is located 25 km north of the Rio
Grande. The associated collection catchment circle circumscribes two small troughs, and several
others are just outside it (see Figure 9). The circle intersects the Atwood and the Norquest sites,
suggesting that perhaps this area north of Edinburg was a favorite seasonal camp by many prehistoric
groups.

Sekula Site
Danielle Sekula worked for many years as the entomologist for the Rio Queen Citrus Groves. She
gathered and cataloged an impressive collection of projectile points in the Rio Queen orchard. The
projectile point types in this collection date from the Early Archaic to the Late Prehistoric period
(Figure 12) (Leal 2013). The Rio Grande flows 18 km from the Rio Queen orchard. Many small
troughs are within an hour’s walk from the site (Figure 13).

DISCUSSION
We draw three conclusions from the archeological record discussed above. First, there is evidence
for a human presence in northern Hidalgo County, dating to as early as the Early Archaic period. This
is an area far from the nearest source of running water, the Rio Grande. Second, deflation troughs
known to have held fresh rainwater are widely distributed in this area. And third, newly identified
single and multi-component archeological sites lie adjacent to these potential water sources associated
with deflation troughs. Mallouf et al. (1977) acknowledged the role of deflation troughs in human
occupation in the STSS and neighboring water-poor areas. Our findings lend further support to the
hypothesis that these aeolian features, which have been a persistent element of the landscape on the
STSS for most of the Holocene, were determinants of settlement and subsistence strategies, and thus,
most of the evidence of widespread human occupation in the STSS and neighboring areas, even if it is
in the form of sparse surface materials, owes it presence to deflation troughs.

Traversing the STSS in prehistoric times between the nearest sources of running water, the Rio
Grande to the south and the Nueces River to the north, a distance of over 175 km, would have been

88

VOLUME 1 (2014)

possible only seasonally or after heavy rains. The only other prehistoric sources of water were seeps
that originated from underground aquifers; Brune (2002) reported on a saline spring in Hidalgo
County. Even today the unforgiving conditions of the STSS claim on average the lives of 100
immigrants who die of dehydration and exposure trying to cross it to enter the United States (The
Monitor, May 18, 2014).
The lack of water, the high constant temperatures for eight months of the year, and the limited
protection from sun exposure precluded year round use and occupation of the STSS. In our view the
annual cycles of drought and high temperature that alternated with wetter periods and cooler
temperatures favor the interpretation that prehistoric groups only made seasonal incursions into this
harsh terrain and established temporary camps. This observation underlines Ricklis’ (2004:180)
interpretation of the fact that most investigations in the STSS show low densities of archeological
material remains and thus suggest short-term occupations by highly mobile groups. The motivation to
venture into the STSS and neighboring deflated areas for a stay, of few weeks to a few months, either
from the Nueces River to the north or from the Rio Grande, would have been driven by the
procurement of salt from one of the three salt lakes at the southern boundary of the STSS or for
hunting and gathering forays. It is also possible that river flooding following episodes of heavy rain
along the course of the Rio Grande encouraged prehistoric peoples to move temporarily into the STSS
where they would find drier land as well as plant, animal, and water resources clustered at the
deflation troughs.
If, as proposed by Forman et al. (2009), the onset of dune movement in the STSS most likely
occurred between 2700 and 2000 B.P. with decreased ground cover probably caused by climatic
fluctuations, then our findings of a number of Early and Middle Archaic points at or near the land
surface in an area of deeply deflated bedrock but lacking moving sand, provides additional support to
Mallouf et al. (1977) explanation regarding the sparse distribution of sites. Migrating aeolian deposits
have effectively buried archeological sites of comparable ages in the STSS.
A century of commercial agriculture plowing and other surface altering activities has not
completely obliterated the deflation troughs, which made feasible the prehistoric occupation of the
STSS and areas peripheral to it. Building from the observations made by Mallouf et al. (1977)
regarding the use of the STSS in prehistory and using a combination of intensive archeological and
geological survey, oral history, GIS technology and existing soil maps, details of this occupation are
being systematically salvaged and recorded before it is lost through development. Future research will
focus on coring the organic-rich sediments that have been deposited in deflation troughs to obtain
botanical macrofossils (seeds, pollen, or peat), and faunal remains that are dateable and can shed light
on changing climatic conditions and plant and animal communities in the STSS and its margins.

A PRECISE CHRONOLOGY OF MIDDLE TO
LATE HOLOCENE BISON EXPLOITATION IN THE
FAR SOUTHERN GREAT PLAINS
Jon C. Lohse, Brendan J. Culleton, Stephen L. Black, and Douglas J. Kennett

ABSTRACT
In regions on the margins of the Great Plains grasslands, documenting the
intermittent history of bison exploitation has presented challenges to
archeologists. Chronologies based on archeological associations have long
been useful in regional research, but can be imprecise and of inadequate
resolution for constructing precise sequences of prehistoric events. Here, we
present a record of directly dated bison from archeological contexts spanning
the last 6000 years on the very southern extent of the Great Plains. This study
includes 61 specimens from archeological contexts that were dated by XAD
purified AMS radiocarbon, with reported errors of only 15-20 14C years for
most dates. The resulting record of bison exploitation for this area defines four
main periods (Calf Creek, Late Archaic 1 and 2, and early Toyah) during
which bison were exploited. Several dates also indicate an early historic
presence of bison; this period may represent a late facet of the Toyah horizon.
This study adds significant chronological resolution to the regional record of
bison in parts of Texas and begins to help correlate cultural chronologies with
important climatic data. It also points to the research value of obtaining
additional directly dated bison samples from temporally and geographically
diverse archeological contexts in our study area and beyond.

INTRODUCTION
The North American genus Bison was among the very top-ranked resources available to huntergatherers up to and even following the arrival of European explorers. Millennia of bison hunting on
the Plains are documented from Early Paleoindian times onward (Bamforth 1988, 2011; Bement and
Buehler 1994; Bozell et al. 2011; Carlson and Bement 2013; Cooper 2008; Frison 1991, 1998, 2004;
Guthrie 1980). In Late Prehistoric times, agriculturalists in the American Southwest and Mississippi
River drainages to the east often hunted bison or traded for their products, bringing them into frequent
contact with Plains tribes (Creel 1991; Spielmann 1991; Speth 2004; Speth and Newlander 2012;
Vehik 1990, 2002). Bison exploitation, for meat and other uses, has played a significant role in
shaping prehistoric and early historic economies across the Plains. As a top-ranked food resource, the

presence of bison would have had tremendously important implications for prehistoric subsistence
practices, mobility, the organization of labor, and other social characteristics.
While bison were present almost continuously in the cool, predominantly C3 grasslands of the
Northern Plains, only occasionally in the Middle to Late Holocene periods did they extend into other
environments characterized by mixed grasslands or other habitats. These areas include parts of the
Great Basin (Grayson 2006), northern Mexico (List et al. 2007), and the southern limits of the Plains
that include Central and coastal Texas (Baugh 1986; Dillehay 1974; Huebner 1991; Lynott 1979;
Mauldin et al. 2012; Ricklis 1992). Understanding precisely when bison were present in regions
located around the periphery of the Plains is important not only for our general knowledge regarding
bison ecology, climate, and environmental change in North America, but also for providing insights
into human responses during these periods.
In this study, we present and evaluate AMS radiocarbon data for 61 XAD purified samples of
bison bone recovered from archeological contexts at seven sites located in Central and South Texas.
The culture history of these areas shares much with Plains traditions to the north during some time
intervals, while maintaining their own distinct patterns during others (Collins 1995, 2004; Hester
2004; Lohse et al. 2014a). Precisely defining periods when bison were present in these areas has been
a challenge, largely as a result of the traditional reliance on dating bison by association with other
archeological remains. Our approach involves directly dating bison from archeological contexts as a
way to avoid the imprecision that can result from dating by association. The resulting chronology
defines four primary periods of prehistoric bison exploitation beginning around 6000 cal B.P. and also
indicates an early Historic use by North American Indians. Earlier periods of bison presence remain
to be worked out for these areas, ideally using a similar methodology to the one we discuss herein.
This precise chronology not only clarifies regional prehistoric subsistence and related technological
practices, but can also help researchers correlate cultural developments with environmental or
paleoclimatic data that may be associated with periods of rapid cultural change.

DATING BISON IN THE STUDY AREA AND THE PRESENT SAMPLE
Beginning with Dillehay (1974), many investigators have examined the issue of bison presence in
the region (Baugh 1986; Collins 1995; Huebner 1991; Lynott 1979; Mauldin et al. 2012; Quigg 1997;
Ricklis 1992). These studies commonly evaluate the presence of bison at a regional scale based on
archeological components that are themselves dated by radiocarbon or by cross-dating using
associated time-marker artifacts (Table 1). Typically, bison presence is modeled as a series of long
periods of presence or absence, the beginnings and endings of which are imprecisely dated.
In contrast to regional models, single-site records (such as the one at Wilson-Leonard, 41WM235
[Collins 1998]), where bison were not present for certain intervals when they appear elsewhere,
exemplify the limitations of site-specific studies. A given site’s stratigraphy may be compressed or
mixed, affecting an analysts’ ability to precisely reconstruct periods of bison exploitation. This
condition most directly and adversely affects bison chronologies that rely on archeological
association. In other cases, a single site’s occupation history may not include periods during which

bison were present nearby. For example, Bonfire Rockshelter (41VV218) offers a fascinating record of
bison hunting during certain periods in the Lower Pecos of southwest Texas, including Late Archaic,

Folsom, and perhaps Clovis times (Bement 1986; Dibble and Lorrain 1968). However, this record
does not include bison remains from the Calf Creek horizon, material traces of which are reported in
nearby Eagle Cave (41VV167, Ross 1965) as well as from Jeff Davis and Brewster counties some 150
km to the west (Gray 2013; Walter 2013), indicating that the record at Bonfire Rockshelter does not
completely reflect the character of regional bison histories.
Our study draws from several sites geographically dispersed across a wide area. We do not imply
that our study area corresponds with any particular archeological region(s). Indeed, the size of what
might be called a “bison catchment” that is represented by this study is not precisely known.
However, previous research indicates the potential size of prehistoric bison ranges. Carlson and
Bement (2013) estimate mobility ranges from ca. 100 km (Clovis times) to up to ca. 600 km (late
Folsom times) in diameter in an area centered on Oklahoma that includes southern Kansas, the Texas
Panhandle, and eastern New Mexico. Widga et al. (2010) reconstruct inter-annual movements of
≤500 km over a period of about 4-5 years for Early/Middle Holocene (ca. 7-8.5 ka) bison in the
eastern Great Plains of eastern Nebraska, South Dakota, western Iowa, and southwest Wisconsin. An
area of ca. 600 km in diameter easily encompasses all of the sites from which samples in this study
were taken (Figure 1).

VOLUME 1 (2014)

mobility patterns comparable to those reconstructed elsewhere in North America. Sites dated in this study are shown in
yellow; other sites discussed in the text are shown in red.
The presence of bison in the archeological record is, first, the result of environmental process and,
second, a reflection of hunter-gatherer behavior. The key to building reliable bison chronologies,
therefore, involves the number of temporal components that are sampled (i.e., selected for direct
dating) within a given bison range. We propose that bison histories can be accurately reconstructed
using sites with intermittent occupation records, so long as each period of bison presence in the total
study area is well represented in at least one site’s deposits. Alternatively, large portions of a bison
chronology can also be compiled from a small number of sites, assuming that each period during
which bison were present on the landscape is represented in site components and has been sampled.
In this approach, compiling a large number of assays (i.e., high sample density) helps to ensure that all
or most intervals of bison presence within the region are included. A weakness of this approach is that
the geographic limits of bison territorial ranges will likely remain poorly known until sampling
densities clearly define the geographic limits for each temporal period of bison presence.

Minimally, the patterns presented below are valid for the sites and time periods included in our
study. Although we consider it likely that these patterns reflect larger-scale trends across a much
broader area, only future sampling following the methods we employ here can precisely identify the
extent of territorial ranges that are associated with the temporal periods in our chronology. For
example, reports of bison presence throughout the Holocene at Lubbock Lake (41LU1) (Johnson
1987; Johnson and Holiday 1987) seem to suggest that the chronology presented here does not extend
to the Texas Panhandle (see Figure 1).
Our sample draws heavily from 41HY160 and HY165, sites that are associated with Spring Lake,
formed by impounded freshwater springs at the headwaters of the San Marcos River in Hays County,
Texas. Based on temporally diagnostic artifacts and radiocarbon data (Figure 2), the Spring Lake sites
exhibit a nearly continuous record of occupation from Clovis to historical periods (Lohse 2013). These
sites are important to this study because their essentially continuous sequence means that remains of
bison, as a top-ranked food resource, should be expected to occur whenever bison were present on the
surrounding landscape. The occupation record of these sites distinguishes them from others, like
Bonfire, with intermittent histories of site use. Controlled excavations at Spring Lake have generally
not extended below the Early Archaic archeological deposits and intensive archeological sampling has
only been conducted to ca. 6000 cal B.P. depths (Lohse et al. 2013), which represents the temporal
limit of our study. Another site (41HY188) is less than 5 km from Spring Lake and evidences Late
Prehistoric and Late Archaic occupation associated with bison (Bettis 1996). Two other specimens
come from Eagle Bluff (41ME147) in Medina County (Hester 2010, 2011), one from Gault (41BL323)
in Bell County, two from McNeill (41VT141) in Victoria County, and one from Cervenka
(41WM267) in Williamson County (Peter et al. 1982). Each site contains deep, multi-component
deposits in stratified alluvial settings, and is interpreted as a long-term encampment, making it
unlikely that bison were killed at any of these locations. Rather, butchered remains were likely
transported from kill sites back to these occupation areas for additional processing.
Assemblages from 41HY160, 41HY165, and 41HY188 were examined for bison remains suitable
for dating. Virtually all specimens identified as bison were fragmented to the point that age and sex
could not be consistently estimated. Therefore, no age and sex data are presented for the bison from
any of our study sites. All cataloged contexts were evaluated, and specimens were selected from as
many different proveniences by depth and site area as possible. Through this approach, every time
period characterized by bison presence (and sampled by controlled excavation) had an equal chance
of being identified. As noted, high sampling density was a priority in order to better model periods of
bison presence. Samples were included from the other sites based on accessibility, preservation, and
the limits of available funding.
Selected specimens were pre-treated for collagen extraction and purification using a XAD process
modified from earlier work by Stafford that isolates individual amino acid chains (Stafford et al. 1988,
1991). Two modern approaches to removing exogenous carbon from bone collagen samples have
been developed and refined over the last two decades: modified Longin (1971) extraction with
ultrafiltration (Brown et al. 1988) and XAD-purification (Stafford et al. 1988, 1991). Ultrafiltration works

by retaining long-chain gelatin molecules (typically larger than 30kDa) and filtering out smaller,
potentially degraded gelatin molecules and contaminating humates smaller than 30kDa. The lower
yield of datable gelatin that results from ultrafiltration can limit its use on very poorly preserved bone
(e.g., in cases where little or no long-chain protein survives), but smaller chains may be recoverable.
One advantage of the modified XAD method is that all of the crude gelatin extracted from the bone
can be processed for stable isotope measurement and AMS 14C dating. Another advantage is that
exogenous carbons that can remain following ultrafiltration treatments are removed, ensuring greater
accuracy of measured ages.
Stafford et al. (1988, 1991) argued that gelatinization as described by Longin (1971) is not
adequate to disassociate all humic and fulvic acids bound to collagen and that contaminants may
cross-bind with smaller degraded collagen chains to create longer chains that would be retained in the

99

filter. Our approach to eliminating these contaminants is to break the collagen down to individual
amino acids by hydrolysis in concentrated (6N) HCl, thereby releasing humic and fulvic acids into
solution. Polar contaminants are then removed from the solution by chromatography using a column
filled with XAD resin. The method used in this study is adapted from that of Stafford et al. (1988,
1991). Similar methods of XAD amino acid dating has been used to reliably reevaluate pre-Clovis,
Clovis, and other Early Paleoindian chronologies in North America (Waters and Stafford 2007, 2014;
Waters et al. 2011) by dating osseous remains and artifacts clearly associated with Terminal
Pleistocene cultural deposits.
At the Human Paleoecology and Isotope Geochemistry Lab at Pennsylvania State University,
each sample was cleaned and sectioned with disposable Dremel cut-off wheels and then
demineralized in 0.5 N HCl for two to three days at 5°C. The demineralized collagen pseudomorph
was then gelatinized at 60°C in 4-5 mL 0.01N HCl for eight to 10 hours. Sample gelatin was pipetted
into a pre-cleaned 10ml disposable syringe with an attached 0.45 μm Millex Durapore PVDF filter
(precleaned with methanol and Nanopure H2O) and driven into a thick-walled culture tube. The
filtered solution was then lyophilized and percent gelatinization and yield determined by weight. The
sample gelatin was then hydrolyzed in 2mL 6N HCl for 22 hours at 110°C. Supelco ENVI-Chrom®
SPE (Solid Phase Extraction; Sigma-Aldrich) columns were prepped with two washes of methanol
(2mL) and rinsed with 10ml DI H2O. With a 0.45 μm Millex Durapore filter attached, the SPE
Column was equilibrated with 50mL 6N HCl and the washings discarded. 2 mL collagen hydrolyzate
as HCl was pipetted onto the SPE column and driven with an additional 10ml 6N HCl dropwise with
the syringe into a 20 mm culture tube. The hydrolyzate was finally dried into a viscous syrup by
passing UHP N2 gas over the sample heated at 50°C for ca. 12 hr.
Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope measurements, %C and %N, were determined on amino acid
hydrolyzate samples (~0.7 mg) at the University of California, Irvine Keck Carbon Cycle Accelerator
Mass Spectrometer facility, on a Fisons NA1500NC elemental analyzer/Finnigan Delta Plus isotope
ratio mass spectrometer with a precision of <0.1‰ for δ13C and δ15N. Only samples with atomic C:N
ratios between 3.0-3.4, indicative of good collagen preservation (Ambrose and Norr 1992; DeNiro
1985; van Klinken 1999), were submitted for AMS 14C dating and are included in this study. AMS
samples (~4.0 mg) were combusted for three hours at 900° C in vacuum-sealed quartz tubes with CuO
wire and Ag wire to produce sample CO2. Sample CO2 was reduced to graphite at 550°C using H2 and
a Fe catalyst, with reaction water drawn off with C-9 Mg (ClO4)2 (Santos et al. 2004). Graphite
samples were pressed into targets in Al boats and loaded on a target wheel with OX-1 (oxalic acid)
standards, known age bone secondaries, and a 14C-free Pleistocene whale blank. The 14C
measurements were made on a modified National Electronics Corporation compact spectrometer
with a 0.5MV accelerator (NEC 1.5SDH-1). Analytical error in the 2-3‰ range was achieved, which
for the current study translates to standard deviations in the range of ± 15-20 14C years. Radiocarbon
ages were δ13C-corrected for mass dependent fractionation with δ13C values measured on the AMS
(Stuiver and Polach 1977), and compared with samples of Pleistocene whale bone (background, >48k

C B.P.), a ca. 12400 14C B.P. horse bone, ca. 1840 14C B.P. bison bone, late A.D. 1800s cow bone,
and OX-1 oxalic acid standards for calibration. All dates are calibrated with the IntCal13 curve

before present (cal B.P.). In order not to imply undue precision, all results are rounded to the nearest
five-year interval (Table 2).
Regarding data presented in Table 2, a small number (n=4) of statistical outliers are present in our
sample. Statistical outliers in each temporal period that contain five or more specimens are those
samples with δ13C values more than 1.5 times the interquartile range below the first quartile or higher
than the third quartile (Fenner 2007). These specimens are identified in Table 2 as having very low
(negative) δ13C values. No statistical outliers were identified based on δ15N. Outliers such as these are
often reported from archeological bison herds such as at Folsom (Meltzer 2006:Table 6.19) and JonesMiller (Tieszen et al. 1997), and elsewhere we have speculated that these may represent sexually
mature bulls that had migrated into the study area from elsewhere (Lohse et al. 2014b). We are not
aware of any research to date that has focused specifically on explaining or interpreting these outliers,
but they are not uncommon in archeological studies of prehistoric bison isotopes.
We define periods of bison presence (also called temporal groups) based on the clustering of
calibrated 14C dates. In addition to standard calibration we calculate the duration of each period as the
Difference of the earliest and latest samples in each group using OxCal, and summarize the range with
means of those dates. Because we are unlikely to have directly dated the earliest or latest bison for any
of our temporal groups, future dating is likely to affect the span of one or more groups. OxCal’s Sum
command is used to visually summarize the distributions within each group of dates, but this is merely
a heuristic rather than an analytical tool. Because of the high density of samples taken from 41HY160,
41HY165, and 41HY188, it is possible that the same animals from these sites may have been dated
more than once. If such cases exist, however, they do not adversely affect our chronology, since
assays are only used to indicate when bison were hunted, and are not used to reconstruct herd
population dynamics. Evaluating the individual carbon and nitrogen isotope measurements for each
sample (shown in Table 2) shows that no two samples returned the same radiocarbon and isotope
values. This suggests that any duplicate measurement of the same animal is minimal.
As noted, one result of our analytical approach is that the resulting chronology has greater
precision than temporal models based on traditional (i.e., non-pretreated) bone dating and/or those
relying on archeological association. While such methods have long provided useful information
about the general timing of events, they are not well suited for addressing the precise timing of
prehistoric events or when researchers are interested in documenting periods of rapid or punctuated
cultural adaptations. Precise chronologies, sometimes also called “short chronologies” (e.g., Denham
et al. 2012; Kennett et al. 2011, 2014; Tzedakis 2003; Wilmshurst et al. 2011) because they cover
shorter spans of time than “long chronologies” of the same phenomena, are based on careful selection
and AMS 14C measurement of short-lived, pretreated species that minimizes the difference between
the dated and target events. This approach can be differentiated from simple “dating,” which might
include no particular strategy to help ensure greater chronometric precision, and “high precision”
dating, which we see as efforts that begin with the kind of sample selection and treatment we use but
that also employ appropriate statistical manipulation, such as Bayesian statistics, of constrained data

to construct or build chronological models characterized by greatly reduced age range probabilities.
While this study focuses on precisely dating bison, we include an example of high-precision
chronology, below, based on our work with the Calf Creek archeological component at Spring Lake.

RADIOCARBON RESULTS
Prehistoric bison exploitation is dated to four main periods in our study area, the first lasting from
ca. 5955-5815 cal B.P.; the second and third involving two pulses between 3295-3130 cal B.P. and

105

JOURNAL OF TEXAS ARCHEOLOGY AND HISTORY.ORG

2700-2150 cal B.P. separated by a 400+ year hiatus from ca. 3130 to 2700 cal B.P.; and the fourth
consisting of a short Late Prehistoric interval from 650 to 530 cal B.P (Figure 3). Four historic period
dates range from approximately 400-150 cal B.P. This last interval is hard to date precisely because of
variations in atmospheric radiocarbon concentration during this period. However, historic documents
record widespread bison hunting across Texas and nearby regions (e.g., Speth 2004; Wade 2003), and
this period is critical for understanding regional culture historical events for the preceding three or four
centuries. The prehistoric periods include the widespread Calf Creek horizon, found across the
Southern Plains (Thurmond and Wyckoff 1999); two different periods in the regional Late Archaic
(termed Late Archaic Bison 1 and Late Archaic Bison 2, LAB1 and LAB2, to distinguish these bison
periods from subdivisions in the regional chronology); and what appears to be an early facet of the
Toyah phase or horizon (Kenmotsu and Boyd 2012).

Figure 3. Summed probabilities for 61 XAD-purified AMS dates on bison bone from archeological contexts in Central
and South Texas.

Calf Creek: ca. 5955-5815 cal B.P.
The earliest period of bison presence in our study is associated with the Calf Creek horizon. This
period, which marks the end of the Early Archaic in Central Texas (Lohse et al. 2014a), is defined by
the widespread occurrence of distinctive basally notched Bell and Andice points (Figure 4) often
found in direct association with bison. Calf Creek materials are reported across Oklahoma (Bement et
al. 2005; Duncan 1996; Neal 1999; Neal and Duncan 1998; Thurmond and Wyckoff 1999; Wyckoff
1994, 1995; Wyckoff et al. 2009); Central and South Texas, the Trans Pecos, and northern
Tamaulipas (Calame et al. 2002; Collins 1994; Gray 2013; McReynolds 2002; Prewitt 1983; Ricklis
1988; Ross 1965; Sorrow et al. 1967; Walter 2013); western Arkansas (Dickson 1970); and into
eastern New Mexico (Carmichael 1986). They are also present but less well documented in eastern
Colorado, Missouri (O’Brien and Wood 1998), and Kansas (Stites 2006). Two Calf Creek points have
recently been reported as far north as southern Utah (Wyckoff and Richens 2010). The brevity of this
period has made it difficult to date these deposits with any precision. For example, this horizon is not

106

VOLUME 1 (2014)

represented in Dillehay’s (1974) model for the Southern Plains (see Table 1), and is only poorly
resolved at many sites (e.g., Wilson-Leonard). Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope data from samples
in this study indicate that Calf Creek climates were among the coldest and perhaps driest experienced
in the entire Holocene (Lohse et al. 2014b).

Figure 4. Examples of basally notched Calf Creek horizon points (Bell type). Top two rows are from Zapata County in
South Texas (courtesy of Richard McReynolds). Bottom two rows are from the Hopper’s Landing site (41RF11)
(courtesy of the Museum of the Coastal Bend). All line drawings by Richard McReynolds.
Our Calf Creek bison data derive from three sites: Spring Lake (41HY160), Eagle Bluff, and
Cervenka; the latter two have only a single date each. A bison bone sample associated with a Bell
point from Feature 2 at the Landslide site (41BL85; Sorrow et al. 1967) was curated at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory and was submitted for dating as part of this study, but did not
yield enough collagen to be reliably measured. Two separate contexts at Spring Lake, over 40 m apart,
have yielded Calf Creek remains including 11 AMS dates on bison (Lohse et al. 2013).
Conservatively, the 13 dates together span the interval from 5990-5715 cal B.P., taking the extreme 2
sigma ranges for the earliest and latest dates. However, most dates fall onto an ideal part of the
calibration curve, centering around 5900 cal B.P., between a modest reversal at about 5960 cal B.P.
and a minor plateau spanning from approximately 5850-5770 cal B.P. (Figure 5). The effect of these
two parts of the curve is to draw out or extend the calibrated probabilities of the earliest and last dates.

107

JOURNAL OF TEXAS ARCHEOLOGY AND HISTORY.ORG

However, the difference of the earliest and latest dates allows us to estimate the duration of the Calf
Creek components to be between 25 and 260 calibrated years (mean=140 cal years).

Figure 5. Calibrated probabilities for 13 Calf Creek dates superimposed on IntCal13 calibration curve.
Radiocarbon dates reported in association with Calf Creek materials commonly span over seven
hundred years (see Wyckoff et al. 2009), and some “long” chronologies ascribe as much as a thousand
years to this period (e.g., Collins 2004). Based on our results, however, we argue that this horizon
may have been considerably shorter in duration. A moderately conservative treatment of these dates
suggests a period of about 140 years. However, Bayesian modeling of the calibrated dates from Spring
Lake suggests the presence of bison during a very short interval of no more than about 40 years
(Figure 6), from 5937-5897 cal B.P. (Amodel=122.3). This model indicates the short duration that can be
identified with calibrated radiocarbon dates under ideal circumstances and with high-density
sampling. The single date from Eagle Bluff is slightly earlier than this range, indicating regional
variation in terms of timing and age of different site components. This model substantially narrows
the overall age span for Calf Creek, and creates an opportunity to develop and test hypotheses relating
to the overall chronology of bison movements and cultural responses during this period.

VOLUME 1 (2014)

Figure 6. Simple Bayesian phase model of AMS 14C from Calf Creek deposits at Spring Lake. These data suggest that
the occupation during this horizon may have been limited to only a single event or a few rapid visitations.
Other than our data, very few precise assays are available for this time period. A Calf Creek point
embedded in a juvenile bison (B. occidentalis) skull found in river gravels near Tulsa, Oklahoma
(Bement et al. 2005) and dated at 5120 ± 20 14C years B.P. (approximately 5925-5760 cal B.P.) falls
squarely within the range of dates we report. The Calf Creek component at the Kubik site, also in
Oklahoma, has produced three dates: 4990 ± 100 (NZA6601) (5950-5465 cal B.P.), 5020 ± 120
(NZA6602), and 5050 ± 60 (Beta 98146) radiocarbon years B.P. (Neal 1999). The latter two dates,
from a split nut hull, average to about 5895-5735 cal B.P. All three partially overlap with but are
generally younger than our bison dates by a couple of centuries. The large 2 sigma probabilities of the
Kubik dates relate to their large standard deviations compared with samples in our study, and also
partly to a reversal in the calibration curve that occurs at ca. 5800 cal B.P. (see Figure 5). However,
the nutshell dates are considered highly reliable, and the Kubik data suggest that the Calf Creek
horizon extended later in Oklahoma than in our study area. Additional sampling using precision
dating protocols will be necessary to define the temporal extent of the Calf Creek horizon as it
occurred elsewhere on the Southern Plains.

Late Archaic: ca. 3295-3130 and 2700-2150 cal B.P.
Following Calf Creek, bison appear to have been absent from the landscape for more than two
thousand years, from ca. 5750-3300 cal B.P. Regional models (see Table 1) show bison throughout the
Late Archaic, but are vague about when they appear and tend to treat the Late Archaic as a single
undifferentiated period. Single component sites with bison dating to this time are uncommon. Most
sites, like Wilson-Leonard, have mixed or compressed Late Archaic components. Our Late Archaic
bison dates come from four sites: two Spring Lake sites (41HY160 and 41HY165), 41HY188, and
Gault.
Our data suggest that Late Archaic bison exploitation took place over two distinct intervals. The
first period (LAB1) began by 3295 cal B.P. (mean of 3355-3220 cal B.P., UCIAMS-95718) and
continued until approximately 3130 cal B.P. (mean of 3215-3005 cal B.P., UCIAMS-80138). The
duration of the period is estimated at between 55 and 270 cal years, with a mean of 165 cal years. This
bison pulse is followed by a hiatus of at least 400 years (the 2 sigma difference is 380-700 cal years)
after which a subsequent pulse, LAB2, lasts from about 2700-2150 cal B.P. The more than 400 year
hiatus after 3130 cal B.P. is previously unreported, likely as a result of the reliance on archeological
associations for reconstructing cultural patterns (Figure 7). Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope data
indicate that Late Archaic climates were relatively stable for the entire LAB1 and LAB2 periods, and
that both periods were somewhat warmer and had more effective moisture than the earlier Calf Creek
or later Toyah periods (Lohse et al. 2014b). However, both also correspond with a period of globally
cool climates (Wanner et al. 2011). Importantly, Viau et al. (2006) identify the period around 3000
B.P., approximately the middle of our postulated hiatus, as among the warmest of the entire North
American Holocene and van Geel et al. (1996) identify a cool, moist period in Europe and North
America starting by around 2650 cal B.P. If verified, these temperature changes could help explain or
contextualize bison movements into and out of the study area at different times during the Late
Archaic period.
Although there appears to be a gap in bison exploitation in LAB2 between ca. 2275 and 2415 14C
B.P. (see Table 2), this gap is likely an artifact of the calibration curve. A plateau in the curve occurs
during LAB2, followed by a steep decline and then another mild reversal. These statistical plateaus
affect the interpretation of radiocarbon data most obviously by creating very broad calibrated
distributions for the dates in these groups. Indeed, the estimated length of LAB2 (200-550 cal years) is
the longest in our study, and it is possible that the duration of this period is overestimated because of
fluctuations in the calibration curve during this interval.
A less obvious effect of the plateaus and associated steep segments of the curve is that even with
precise measurements and very dense sampling, conventional ages corresponding to plateaus will be
overrepresented, and those during steep sections may tend to be underrepresented (Calf Creek is an

Figure 7. Calibrated probability distributions for 24 Late Archaic AMS 14C bison dates. The LAB2 occupies a relatively
flat part of the curve from about 2700-2360 cal B.P., which contributes to temporal imprecision during this interval. The
steep decline following this plateau creates the appearance that a brief hiatus separates this period from a third Late
Archaic period of bison exploitation.
exception; see Figure 5). This phenomenon can be modeled with OxCal using the R_Simulate
command, which produces a conventional age from a calendar age with a given measurement error,
and then calibrates it. To better understand the effect of the curve on our calibrated sample, we
simulated a group of 170 dates (10 dates every 25 years) from 2500 to 2100 cal B.P. assuming a
measurement precision of ± 20 14C years to mirror the precision of our study. This very dense dataset
is analogous to recovering and dating 40 bison per century from the archeological record, or roughly
10 times what we have sampled for the period. Plotting the frequency of conventional ages
demonstrates that even at this density, conventional ages from ca. 2380 to 2260 cal B.P. are relatively
unlikely (roughly 10-20 percent as likely) to be sampled compared with ages on the plateaus before
and after that time (Figure 8). The congruence between the distributions of simulated and observed

111

JOURNAL OF TEXAS ARCHEOLOGY AND HISTORY.ORG

conventional ages through this period suggests that the apparent gap is an artifact of the calibration
curve, and that further sampling is unlikely to produce many more conventional ages between 2415
and 2275 ca. B.P.

Figure 8. Frequency of simulated 14C ages (gray columns) versus measured 14C ages (black columns) on bison across
two plateaus in the Late Archaic from 2500-2100 cal B.P. (2560-2040 14C yr B.P.) and the apparent gap in 14C ages
that is an artifact of the calibration curve. Simulated ages were generated in OxCal 4.17 (Bronk Ramsey 2010) using
R_Simulate, assuming 10 dates every 25 cal years and a precision of ± 20 14C yr, comparable to the precision of the
dates in this study. The “gap” in LAB2 14C ages is likely not a true hiatus in bison exploitation.

Toyah: 650-530 cal B.P.
Following the Late Archaic, bison again appear to have been absent from the study area for
approximately 1500 years, until ca. 650 cal B.P. They reappeared suddenly and may have been
present for less than 120 cal years before once again disappearing. This Toyah bison interval is the
shortest in our study. Climatically, our early Toyah bison period occurred immediately after the onset
of the Little Ice Age (LIA), a prolonged cool and dry period, the beginning of which corresponds with
one of the largest volcanic events of the entire Holocene as well as severely reduced solar activity
(Mayewski et al. 2004; Wanner et al. 2011). Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope data (Lohse et al.
2014b) indicate that temperatures during this brief interval were not as cool as the Calf Creek period,
and that effective moisture was slightly greater than in the Calf Creek period. However, the period
was still cooler and drier than either LAB1 or LAB2. The LIA was complex climatologically, and
significant variation has been documented within it. Based on over a thousand tree-ring, ice core,
coral, sediment, and other proxy records, Mann et al. (2009) reconstruct a brief cold period in the
northern hemisphere centering around A.D. 1340 (ca. 610 cal B.P.) that precedes a short warm
interval before temperatures decline once again just prior to ca. A.D. 1500 (ca. 450 cal B.P.). The
reconstructed cool periods correspond with the Wolf and Spöer grand solar minima, respectively

112

VOLUME 1 (2014)

(Bard et al., 2000; Steinhilber and Beer 2011), brief intervals of reduced solar activity (e.g., sun spots,
solar flares, etc.) that are associated with global cooling.
The bimodal calibrated distributions of our 20 dates from this period (Figure 9) partially reflect
the shape of the calibration curve during this interval, which exhibits a sharp reversal resulting in
paired intercepts for each assay. Taking the difference of the oldest and youngest dates in our Toyah
bison period, the period lasted between 10 and 120 cal years, with a mean of 70 cal years. Toyah dates
come from five sites: two Spring Lake sites (41HY160 and 41HY165), 41HY188, Eagle Bluff, and
McNeill.

Figure 9. Calibrated probability distributions for 20 early Toyah AMS 14C bison dates. The reversal at ca. 575 cal B.P.,
resulting in bimodal distributions, causes the calibrated span of time to cover a longer period than is likely.
Nonetheless, this is the shortest period of bison exploitation documented in our study.
The brevity of this period of bison exploitation is significant in the culture history of North
America. In the regional sequence, the Toyah horizon begins by approximately 650 cal B.P. or A.D.
1300, and lasts as late as A.D. 1700. Native American cultural practices extending to the end of this
sequence are difficult to link with earlier prehistoric antecedents because of the influences of Spanish
entradas and colonization, not to mention population declines and social disruptions due to European
diseases and group displacement practices that started in the early 1500s (Arnn 2012; Kenmotsu and

113

JOURNAL OF TEXAS ARCHEOLOGY AND HISTORY.ORG

Hester 2001). Nonetheless, Toyah culture has typically been defined as exhibiting a technological
focus on the exploitation of bison (Johnson 1994; Kenmotsu and Boyd 2012; Prewitt 2012; Ricklis
1994) and artiodactyls generally (Black 1986). Some have noted variation in Toyah subsistence
practices (e.g., Dering 2008; Mauldin et al. 2013), including what appears as a decreased emphasis in
bison, but temporal controls frequently lack the precision needed to demonstrate whether this
variation is temporal or geographic in nature.
Archeologists argue that Toyah is important for our broader anthropological understanding of
hunter-gatherer cultural patterns just prior to ethnographically-documented foragers that occupied the
region when the Spanish arrived (Collins 1995). Our data suggest that the Toyah horizon may have
been characterized by more varied subsistence practices and associated social and technological
adaptations than conventional views suggest. From the early A.D. 1500s through the late 1700s,
historical groups were recorded pursuing bison across Texas (Arnn 2012; Speth 2004; Wade 2003),
and it has been widely presumed that this pattern is an extension of practices that began as early as
A.D. 1300 (ca. 650 cal. B.P.). Prior research on the southern Plains has documented widespread trade
between Puebloan settlements to the west and Plains groups focusing on bison meat, hide, and other
products (Boyd 1997; Creel 1991; Krieger 1946; Prewitt 1982; Speth and Newlander 2012; Spielmann
1991; Vehik 1990, 2002). Considering the sudden appearance of bison and their role in both
subsistence and economic patterns, we suggest that early Toyah (ca. A.D. 1300-1420, or 650-530 cal
B.P.) can be partly understood as a southern extension of this interregional system. Our findings
suggest, however, that middle Toyah sites, those dating after around 530 cal B.P. (A.D. 1420), but
pre-dating the reappearance of bison in the mid-1500s, may have maintained an altogether different
orientation, with significantly less reliance on bison than previously thought. Although sites with late
Toyah material such as the Rush site (41TG346, ca. A.D. 1575; Quigg 1997) or the upper Toyah
component at Rowe Valley (41WM437; Prewitt 2012) contain bison and appear to support this threepart model of Toyah chronology, dating resolution is so far lacking to demonstrate the postulated
middle Toyah facet. However, the four historic dates in our sample provide partial support for this
model. More dates are needed from this late period before this model can be further developed.

DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS
Our record of 61 AMS dates on bison bone recovered from archeological contexts from the
southeastern periphery of the Great Plains adds to what is known about the exploitation of a topranked resource starting approximately 6000 years ago. We show that bison were present only
occasionally since the Early-Middle Holocene. While our study is generally consistent with previous
regional models, it adds important precision to the overall understanding of these periods. It is well
known that bison were present in the region prior to 6000 cal B.P., but this part of the record has not
been directly dated using the XAD-based protocols we report here. Because the early sequence for
bison exploitation is dated primarily by archeological association, in our view it remains imprecise.
In spite of its limitations in terms of geographic and temporal coverage, our record of XADpurified AMS 14C dates on bison offers one of the most precise models for the presence and prehistoric
exploitation of this key resource anywhere in North America. In addition to refining local and

114

VOLUME 1 (2014)

regional chronologies, our findings also contribute to hypotheses about fluctuations in “Plains-like”
cultural patterns that depended, in part, on environmental and climatic change and the subsequent
exploitation of bison for subsistence and economic purposes. For example, what appears as the
sudden onset of bison-related cultural patterns, especially Calf Creek and Toyah, may have been
associated with rapid climate change (Mayewski et al. 2004). This important possibility, which
deserves further attention, would have significant implications for how archeologists understand the
nature and timing of prehistoric culture change. Additionally, the rapid appearance of widespread
horizons associated with the Calf Creek and early Toyah periods is ostensibly linked to the sharing of
weapons- and processing-related technologies involved with logistically organized bison hunting at
these times. Projectile point styles associated with these intervals are among the most widespread postPaleoindian styles in Texas (cf. Prewitt 1995), and may reflect the distances traveled by bison hunters
and the kinds of social encounters that occurred as part of these forays.
More than only subsistence practices are implicated as well. Trade patterns beginning by A.D.
1250 (ca. 700 cal B.P.) in the Southern Plains and focused on bison are also well known (e.g., Creel
1991; Speth 2004). Toyah sites commonly show a sharp increase in exotic materials compared with
earlier periods (Kibler 2012), suggesting that exchange networks also extended south into Central and
southern Texas. Like connections with climate change, this proposition also requires much additional
research before these economic processes are fully understood. Future AMS radiocarbon dating work
on Toyah sites should be mindful of our evidence suggesting a three-part bison chronology. Sample
selection should avoid large carbonized wood fragments susceptible to the old wood effect and focus
instead on annuals or perennials. Radiocarbon results should be matched against zooarcheological
assemblages indicating the presence or absence of bison.
Our study highlights the research value of adding to the record of XAD-purified AMS dates of
bison remains. Adding samples with greater time depth and from additional sites will help improve
the bison record and increase its usefulness as a means for understanding larger cultural and
environmental processes at the southern extent of the far Southern Plains.

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH OF THE HISTORY OF THE
FRANCISCO FLORES RANCH
Adriana Muñoz Ziga

ABSTRACT
The Francisco Flores Ranch, located northwest of Floresville, Texas,
encompassed five sitios of land and one labor on the west bank of the San
Antonio River at the paraje known as Chayopines. The Flores Ranch is one of
the last surviving privately owned colonial ranches that have been identified in
the San Antonio River valley containing standing structures possibly dating to
the original date of occupation. I outline previous research on the property
and offer new interpretations on the farm and ranch complex.

INTRODUCTION
Francisco Antonio Flores de Abrego was a Canary Island immigrant who settled the area around
the town of Lodi, which became present day Floresville (Hazlewood 2010). The Francisco Flores
Ranch, located northwest of Floresville, Texas, encompassed five sitios of land and one labor on the
west bank of the San Antonio River at the paraje known as Chayopines. In order to understand the
property, one must comprehend the history of the area and early settlement along the San Antonio
River.
Much of the area along the San Antonio River belonged to the San Antonio missions (Figure 1).
The main goal of the missions was to become self-sufficient, which meant that they each had to grow
enough food and raise enough cattle to support its inhabitants (Cargill et. al. 1998:7). Missions had
additional land outside their complexes that was used for agriculture and grazing. The boundaries of
these ranch areas were never clearly defined as “none of the [San Antonio] missions were established
with their later ranch lands included in the original land grant,” and ownership shifted between
missions at diff rent periods in time (Cargill et al. 1998:7). Once private ranchers began settling in the
area, confusion between the mission land and private ranches’ boundaries was common, since in
many cases no title existed and descriptions were based on individual accounts.
Evidence suggests that multiple Chayopines ranchos on either side of the river existed since the
area was first settled. Archival documents show that at least four ranches using the name Chayopines
were present in the area between 1760-1810, including Francisco Flores’ ranch; this has added to the
confusion concerning the property’s history over the years. I attempt to reconcile the differences
through archival research of primary and secondary sources, including original Spanish documents.

RANCHO DE SAN YLDELFONSO DE LOS CHAYOPINES
The first recorded private settler of the area around the Flores Ranch appears to have been Martin
de la Pena with his Rancho de San Yldelfonso de los Chayopines in 1768 (Oca 1778). As mentioned
previously, mission ranch lands were not included in their original land grants, and this created
confusion concerning the boundaries between the missions and their private neighbors. This
confusion led to the litigation of 1768-1772 between the lands of Mission Concepcion, Espada, and
Valero and private landowners including Vicente Alvarez Travieso, the heirs of Martin Lorenzo de
Armas, Domingo Delgado, Jacinto Delgado, and Manuel Delgado (Pena 1770). During the litigation,
the ranch lands of the three missions were re-surveyed using actual field measurements of the areas
the missions were actively using and those that were not being actively used (Ivey 1991:35). At that
time it was determined that Martin de la Pena’s ranch was occupying land belonging to Mission
Espada, which led to litigation between the two parties (Pena 1770). The notice issued by Don Simon
de Arocha in June of 1770 regarding this issue reads as follows:
respecto a que dicha informacion resulta a si mismo que Don Martin de la Pena en las
tierras que tiene pobladas como de tres anos esta parte esta entrado como un cuarto de
legua en las que posee dicha mision de la Espada por la parte del norte en el Paso que
llaman de los Chayopines (Pena 1770).

128

VOLUME 1 (2014)

In respect to said information, resulting indeed that Don Martin de la Pena in the lands he
has inhabited for about three years, has encroached about a quarter of a league in the ones
owned by the said Mission Espada, on the north part at the crossing known as Chayopines
(all translations are by the author).
Martin de la Pena responded to this notice:
desde el ano de mil cetecientos sesenta y ocho es verdad aver poblado el paraje de los
chayopines con mi hijo y tres mozos, que me puse con buena fee, siendo con el permiso
expreso de el Senor Governador interino Don Hugo Oconor y con la licencia del Senor
Capitan Don Luis Antonio Menchaca, aviendome informado primero de que dicho sitio
no estaba comprehendido en los agostaderos de la Mision de la Espada…pues estando el
terreno que ocupo entre el paso de los Chayopines y el que llaman de las Mujeres (Pena
1770).
From the year of 1768, it is true I have inhabited the paraje de los Chayopines with my son
and three servants, that I settled in good faith, being with the expressed permission of the
Interim Governor Don Hugo Oconor and with license of Captain Don Luis Antonio
Menchaca, informing myself first that said land was not included in the pastures of Mission
Espada…thus being the land I occupy between the Chayopines crossing and the one called
las Mujeres.
It is known that Rancho las Cabras on the west bank of the river belonged to Mission Espada
(Cargill et. al. 1998:7). If Pena encroached 1/4 of a league (0.66 miles) over the north boundary of
Mission Espada lands, it is likely that his ranch was on the west bank of the river north of Las Cabras.
At the end of the litigation Espada’s northern boundary was moved south at Janisos/Los
Alamos/Pena creek, and the area between Pena’s southern boundary at Chayopines crossing and the
new northern boundary for Las Cabras (Figure 2) was made available to private ranchers for lease
(Ivey 1991:38). Pena never received clear title during the 1770 litigation, which opened him up to a
lawsuit between Juan Joseph Montes de Oca and his Rancho de la Candelaria and Ygnacio de la
Pena, Jose Martin’s son and the Rancho de los Chayopines in 1778 (Oca 1778).
To clarify further we can look at the 1778 claim over this land. According to Montes de Oca his
lands went:
de la junta del Rio de Medina con este de San Antonio hasta donde entra el arroyo de los
alamos con el propio rio lindando por el sur con tierras pertenesientes al rancho de la
Mission de la Espada por el Poniente con el arroyo del Borrego y por Norte y oriente con
tierras de la Mission de San Juan que serán quatro sitios de ganado mayor de largo y de
ancho quando mas tres cuartos de legua de tierra (Oca 1778).

available to the author at this time. Further research is necessary to confirm boundaries.
From the mouth of the Medina River at the San Antonio, to the mouth of Elm Creek with
the said river, adjoining to the south, lands belonging to the ranch of Mission Espada, to the
west with Borrego creek, and to the north and east with lands of Mission San Juan. That
might be four sitios of ganado mayor in length and at least 3/4 of a league in width.
His account appears problematic since the area Montes de Oca describes is much larger than the
four sitios he claims it to be. However, all of the markers noted on his description are located west of
the San Antonio River. On January 1778 Baron de Ripperda wrote after visiting the de la Pena family
to settle Montes de Oca’s claim:
Halle poblado el rancho llamado los Chayopines por Don Martin de la Pena padre de Don
Josef Antonio Yldelfonso de la Pena cura parroco que era de esta poblacion donde se puso
desde el mes de marzo de mil setezientos sesenta y ocho hallándose Juan Josef Montes en
el rincón de la Candelaria como expresa con una laborcita aunque no de continua
asistencia y retirándose de dicho parage continuaron los hijos del sitado Don Martin de la
Pena teniendo poblado aun quando todos los ranchos se despoblaron por las hostilidades
de los indios nortenos mediante su mas favorable situación en cuya atención y el perjuicio
que a dichos pobladores resultava devolverse a establecer el sitado Juan Josef Montes en el
referido parage no permitiéndoselo condecendi a que se estableciera tres o mas leguas rio

arriba junto al paso de Josef Miguel con motivo de tener a su cuidado unas reses dadas al
ssma. donde hizo corral y jacal pero sin mantenerlo poblado mas que para las juntas de su
ganado manifestándose no procede con la devida realidad en lo que expone respecto ser
parte de las tierra que zita comprehendidas en las medidas que de superior orden se
hicieron y posee la misión de la espada como por que componen mucho mas que
duplicado terreno de los quatro sitios de ganado mayor de largo y tres quartos de legua de
ancho que supone (Oca 1778).
I found the ranch named los Chayopines inhabited by Don Martin de la Pena, father of
Don Josef Antonio Yldelfonso de la Pena, who was parochial priest of this town, where he
settled since the month of March of 1768, being Juan Josef Montes at the Rincon de la
Candelaria as he expresses, with a small labor although not of continuous assistance, and
[after] removing himself from the said paraje, the sons of the said Don Martin de la Pena
continued inhabiting even when all the ranches became uninhabited due to the hostilities of
the northern Indians. Through his most favorable situation in which attention and the
perjury that re-establishing caused those inhabitants not permitting the said Juan Josef
Montes at the said paraje, I conceded him to establish three or four leagues upriver next to
the Josef Miguel crossing so that he could have under his care some cattle given to His
Excellency, where he built a corral and jacal but inhabiting it only while gathering his cattle.
Manifesting to not proceed with the necessary reality in what he presents in respect to being
part of the lands he cites within the measures that by superior order were made and belong
to the Mission Espada, as they compose much more than double land from the four sitios de
ganado mayor in length and 3/4 of a league in width that he supposes.
Baron de Ripperda noted the issue between Montes de Oca’s claim and the actual size of the
described property. On a subsequent letter Martin de la Pena described the boundaries of his ranch as
follows:
desde el Paso que llaman de Jose Miguel en el Rio de este Presidio por de este lado, hasta el
de las Mugeres con su fondo correspondiente hasta el complete de sinco sitios de ganados
maiores (Oca 1778).
From the crossing called Jose Miguel at the River of this presidio, through on this side, to
the Mujeres with its corresponding end at the completion of five sitios of ganado mayor.
The boundaries of the property were expanded considerably from the description given by Martin
de la Pena in 1770 to the one from 1778 (Figure 3). It is important to note that during this time
Ignacio Calvillo was petitioning to rent land from Chayopines to Mujeres crossing that he had been
using since 1775 as his Rancho de las Mujeres (Ivey 1991:41). Calvillo had settled the area between
the northern boundary of Las Cabras (as determined during the 1770 litigation between the private
ranchers and the missions) and the southern boundary of Pena’s ranch just south of Chayopines
Crossing. Although this area appears to have stayed in control of Mission Espada, private citizens
were allowed to lease this land, which allowed Calvillo to rent and establish his ranch as mentioned
previously. No full legal title appears to have been issued to Pena or Montes de Oca during the 1778

131

JOURNAL OF TEXAS ARCHEOLOGY AND HISTORY.ORG

lawsuit but the Pena family occupied the land until at least 1791 (Ivey 1991:41). Montes de Oca did
not receive his request to dispossess Pena of his land, but does seem to have been granted a ranch on
the north side of the San Antonio River, between La Bahia Road and Mission San Juan lands to the
north, and Salado Creek to the west (Ivey 1991:41). At any rate, evidence seems to be clear in locating
the Pena ranch on the west bank of the river north of Las Cabras.

Figure 3. Map showing lands of Ygnacio de la Pena in 1778.

FRANCISCO FLORES ACQUISITION OF CHAYOPINES RANCH
In 1773, Ignacio Calvillo requested title of the Rancho de las Mujeres between Rancho de las
Cabras and Chayopines Crossing. It is likely he received it since he was recognized as a landowner in
the area in future documents. At some point after securing a lease to use the land, he lost part of the
property due to failing to pay rent in about 1780, and it appears the two sitios he lost were immediately
re-granted to Francisco Flores (Ivey 1991:42). According to the proceedings of a case between
Mariana Curbelo versus Vizente Flores in 1783, Vizente, his father Francisco, and his cousins Juan
Jose and Joaquin were operating a ranch at Chayopines (Curbelo 1783). It is important to note that
the proceedings included Ygnacio Penaas one of the persons who accompanied Vizente when he
reportedly stole cattle from his grandmother Mariana Curbelo, Vicente Alvarez Travieso’s widow
(Curbelo 1783). In 1809, Calvillo finally received clear title to his remaining two sitios of land (Ivey
1991:42).

132

VOLUME 1 (2014)

By 1783, Francisco Flores and his son Vicente were operating Chayopines (Ivey 1991:42). The
Flores property extended from about Chayopines crossing downriver about five miles (Figure 4); this
was the portion Calvillo lost in 1780. Eventually the de la Pena family sold their rights to half of the
original Rancho de San Yldelfonso del Chayopin in 1792 to Francisco Flores, losing control over
Chayopines Crossing (Ivey 1991:42).

Figure 4. Map showing Flores Ranch in 1783.

THE SOLIS EXPEDITION OF 1767-1768
Th first accounts of settlement in the area near the location of the Flores Ranch were written by
Fray Gaspar Jose de Solis in 1767-1768 during his inspection trip to Texas. Evidence suggests that
multiple Chayopines ranchos on either side of the river existed since the area was first settled. In 1791
there were at least two ranches with the Chayopines name: Ygnacio de la Pena’s Rancho de San
Yldelfonso del Chayopin and Dona Manuela Montes’ Rancho de Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe del
Chayopin (Cabildo’s Report 1791), apparently the northernmost section of Simon de Arocha’s San
Rafael ranch adjacent to Chayopin crossing (Ivey 1991:44). Previous research has shown that Solis
passed through the Flores rancho, owned by Pena at the time. In order to clarify this matter, and
because there were multiple Chayopines ranches in the vicinity, it is important to look at Solis’
accounts of his trip.

133

JOURNAL OF TEXAS ARCHEOLOGY AND HISTORY.ORG

In 1767, Solis traveled from Mexico to Bexar to inspect the Texan missions. He crossed the Rio
Grande close to present-day Laredo, Texas, and then traveled north on the Camino Real to La Bahia
(present day Goliad); from there he traveled along the San Antonio River north to the San Antonio
missions. Afterwards, he traveled back south along the river down to the area near the intersection
with Cleto Creek before turning northeast on his way to East Texas. Upon his return from East Texas
he visited missions La Bahia and Concepcion, traveled upriver for a second time to Mission San Jose,
and made his way to Rancho El Atascoso before returning to Mexico (Figure 5). His travel diary
provides a description of the ranches along his route.

Figure 5. Overlay of the route of the Fray Gaspar Jose de Solis expedition in 1767-1768 on Domingo Cabello’s (1780)
map of the San Antonio River valley.
According to the translation of the diary by Kress (1932), after leaving La Bahia he “passed
through the ranch of the S. S. Joseph, which belongs to the captain of La Bahia…journeyed almost to
the River of San Antonio de Vejar going upstream…[and] came to La Escondida” (Kress 1932:47-48).
The next day he “passed through La Parrita, through the ranch called El Capote, which is on the bank
of the San Antonio River; through the ranch of La Mora belonging to the Mission of San Juan
Capistrano on the bank of the same river…came to the Rancho de Labor of Father Cardenas, also on
the bank of the river” (Kress 1932:48). It is important to note that all of these landmarks are located
on the west bank of the river; until this point it is clear Solis was traveling upriver on the west bank.
He then continued: “I passed through the goat ranch on the bank of the same San Antonio River,
through La Mota and Arroyo del Padre Mariano…crossed said river [emphasis added] and came to the

134

VOLUME 1 (2014)

corral of San Juan Capistrano” (Kress 1932:48). According to the landmarks mentioned in his account
Solis crossed on to the east bank of the river somewhere near present day Mariana/Picosa Creek,
likely through Mujeres Crossing on to Pataguilla, Mission San Juan’s Ranch (Ivey 1991:23). The next
day he “passed the Salado River at the crossing of the San Antonio River, near the Mission of San
Juan Capistrano” (Kress 1932:48). If there was a Chayopines ranch on the west bank of the river it
would have been further upriver from where he crossed over to Pataguilla on the east bank of the
river.
Fray Gaspar Jose de Solis then visited the San Antonio missions and traveled back the same way
on his way to East Texas. He “left the mission of San Joseph…went by the Mission of San Juan
Capistrano, crossed the Salado River…and came to the pool of Quinones…that is on the edge of the
big woods, or Monte del Diablo” (Kress 1932:53). He remained there for the next day because of bad
weather and then he “set out, passing through the Calaveras, and came to the Chayopines crossing of
the San Antonio River…said mass and set up the Holy cross” (Kress 1932:53). After leaving Mission
San Jose, on the west bank of the river, he implied crossing over to the east bank since he passed by
Mission San Juan and Calaveras Creek, both located east of the river. His description puts
Chayopines south of Calaveras Creek on the east bank of the river. The Chayopines that Solis stopped
at, said mass, and set up a cross at, was close to the Pena ranch but on the east bank of the river. The
next day he “passed through La Patanya, through Los Pajaritos, and came to Marcelino creek” (Kress
1932:53), all located east of the river. This corroborates the possibility mentioned above that at this
point he was traveling on the east bank of the river. After going by the ranches of San Bartolo, Guerra,
and Amoladeras he continued his travel to East Texas.
On his way back to San Antonio from East Texas and after stopping at the missions of La Bahia
and Rosario he wrote that he “came to La Escondida…reached the ranch of the Honorable Captain of
the Presidio of San Antonio de Bejar, which is called San Francisco…reached the Chayopines, ranch
of the honorable Priest of said presidio” (Kress 1932:73). From there, he traveled upriver to Mission
San Jose. Solis’ account is unclear and not very descriptive, making it difficult to locate exactly where
he was along the river. He first noted crossing La Escondida after passing through the ranch of S. S.
Joseph on his initial travel from La Bahia to San Antonio; this is likely Escondida Creek, west of the
River. He then mentioned stopping at San Francisco, which belonged to Captain Jose Antonio
Menchaca and was located on the east bank between the river and Marcelinas Creek (Jackson
1986:93). Solis did not mention crossing the river, so it is possible that he left La Bahia, traveled on
the east bank, passed by the mouth of Escondida Creek at the river, continued on to San Francisco,
and then upriver to Chayopines.
According to Solis, he stopped at the Chayopines ranch of the “honorable Priest of the said
presidio” (Kress 1932:73). It is possible, although highly unlikely, that this priest was Jose Antonio
Yldelfonso de la Pena, Martin de la Pena’s son, who was priest at the parochial church of Nuestra
Senora de la Candelaria in San Fernando (Ivey 1991:41). Solis did not mention which route he took
from Chayopines to Mission San Jose. On his previous visit he had followed the east bank of the river
up to Calaveras Creek, went by Mission San Juan, and then crossed the river to get to Mission San
Jose. It is likely that he would have followed his previous route. If he was at San Francisco on the east

135

JOURNAL OF TEXAS ARCHEOLOGY AND HISTORY.ORG

bank of the river he would have had to cross over to the west bank to get to Pena’s ranch, then go
back to the east bank to follow his previous route to Mission San Jose.
It is also known that Simon de Arocha settled Rancho de San Rafael by 1766 on the east bank of
the river and that he was head of the Bexar militia. Thus it is possible that Solis was referring to the
Arocha’s settlement ( Jackson 1986:91). According to a letter from Santiago de Zuniga written in 1788
regarding “an order of payment issued against Don Simon de Arocha, when [Zuniga] called upon him
to make payment, he offered to do so with cattle from his Rancho de los Chayopines” (Santiago de
Zuniga 1788). The Chayopines rancho owned by Simon de Arocha in 1788 does not appear on a 1791
report of ranches along the San Antonio River (Appendix A). It is unknown at this time if his Rancho
Chayopines changed name and became San Rafael, or if he originally had two ranches. The 1791
report does list the Rancho de Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe del Chayopin owned by Manuela
Montes de Oca (Cabildo’s Report 1791), Juan de Dios Arocha Curbelo’s widow. Juan de Arocha was
Simon’s brother, suggesting that the Chayopines rancho referred to in Zuniga’s letter later became
Juan’s rancho. It is likely that the Chayopines ranch visited by Solis was Manuela Montes’ and not
Martin de la Pena’s, as previous research had shown. My research indicates that it is highly possible
Solis did not visit the Flores property during his trip.

FLORES RANCH
As mentioned previously, the Pena family was occupying their land up until at least 1791
(Cabildo’s Report 1791), and Francisco Flores and his son Vicente were operating Chayopines by
1783 (Ivey 1991:42). It appears that Francisco Flores acquired two sitios of land that Ignacio Calvillo
lost due to failing to pay rent to Mission Espada in 1780 (Ivey 1991:42). It is likely that the Francisco
that acquired Calvillo’s property and inhabited Chayopines in 1783 was Francisco Javier Flores de
Abrego, Juan Jose Flores de Abrego’s brother, and not his grandson Francisco Antonio, who received
title to the Flores Ranch in 1834.
According to land grant #694 at the Bexar Archives, Ignacio Villaseñor and Concepcion Flores
requested title of one sitio of land for ganado mayor in 1809 (Villaseñor 1809). Concepcion Flores was
Francisco Antonio’s sister and Ignacio Villaseñor was their brother in law, married to Maria
Gertrudis Flores. Th document reads as follows:
nuestro padre Don Pedro Flores ya difunto conpro al defunto Don Ygnacio Pena, un Citio
de tiera de ganado mayor. Mi padre no obtuvo titulo de propiedad, ni el que le vendio lo
tubo y de ese modo estamos manteniendo nuestros vienes en aquel citio en terreno
nomvrado los chayopines (Villaseñor 1809).
Our father Don Pedro Flores, deceased, bought from Don Ygnacio Pena, deceased, …my
father did not get a property title, neither he who sold to him had it and in that way we are
maintaining our property in that location at the site known as Chayopines.
It is unknown why if Francisco Javier Flores and his son Vicente inhabited the property in the
1780s, his niece Concepcion claimed the land was inhabited by his father Pedro. However, it is

136

VOLUME 1 (2014)

possible that as noted previously although Pedro’s brothers Juan Jose and Joaquin were at
Chayopines in the 1780s, Pedro might have taken over the rancho at some point.
Jose Flores responded to Ignacio Villaseñor and Concepcion Flores’ request after visiting the
property as follows:
[el terreno] se haya citado en las marjenes del Rio San Antonio y Medina, en los
agostaderos nombrados San Yldelfonso de los Challopines…se haya el suplicante radicado
con jacal y corrales, a la parte de abajo ynmediato a las fabricas del interesado se ha
establecido Don Francisco Farias…con un chamacuero y corral y labor…[en el] llano que
esta enfrente de la fabrica del interesado; en dicho llano se halla una senal o mojonera de
piedra la qual se ignora quien la puede haver puesto, respecto a que el padre Frai Pedro
Norema dice se hayan los documentos de las Miciones en el archivo de Gobierno y
algunos de los interesados dicen haverlas puesto sin medida de Juez los padres de las
Miciones (Villaseñor 1809).
[the site] is located at the bank of the San Antonio and Medina Rivers, at the pastures
named San Yldelfonso de los Chayopines…the applicant is found residing with jacal and
corrals, on the lower part immediate to the applicant’s building Don Francisco Farias has
established…with a chamacuero and corral and labor…[at the] plain that is in front of the
applicant’s building; in said plain there is a stone signal or mojonera and is unknown who
placed it there, in respect to Father Pedro Norena saying that the documents of the
Missions are at the Government archives and some of the interested parties say the
Missions put them without any measurement of a Judge.
The Chayopines rancho that Concepcion and Ignacio were claiming was located immediately
south of Francisco Farias’ settlement (Figure 6). Francisco Farias was Maria Micaela de la Pena’s
son, and Micaela was Ignacio de la Pena’s sister. A list of sindicos in the area published in 1810 shows
two ranches in the Chayopines area: the Ranch of San Ildelfonso de los Chayopines occupied by Jose
Francisco Farias and his wife Maria Encarnacion Rosales, and the Ranch of los Dolores y Chayopin
occupied by Ignacio Villaseñor and Maria Gertrudis Flores (Appendix B). It is likely that at least by
1810, the original San Ildelfonso de los Chayopines was still owned by the Pena family (or at least
part of it), and the sitio that Concepcion Flores and Ignacio Villaseñor requested in 1809 was the area
between Chayopines and Las Cabras that Ignacio Calvillo had lost. However, if this was the case,
Pena would have to have acquired the land Calvillo lost and then sold that to Flores. It is unknown
why Concepcion requested title to only one sitio in 1809 if according to Ivey (1991:42), by 1792 the
Flores family was occupying half of the original San Yldelfonso de los Chayopines land which would
have amounted to more than one sitio of land.
It is also unknown if Concepcion Flores’ claim was found valid in 1809 since title to the Flores
property was not issued until 1834. It is possible that since a mojonera was found at the site and the
records of the mission lands were not available for reference, the claim remained unprocessed. It is
also possible that the mojonera found in 1809 marked one of the original boundaries of former Mission
Espada lands, which would substantiate the fact that Flores was granted part of Ignacio Calvillo land

137

JOURNAL OF TEXAS ARCHEOLOGY AND HISTORY.ORG

that had belonged to the mission. Regardless, this document provides clear evidence that Pedro
Flores, Francisco Antonio’s father, purchased land from Pena prior to 1809.

Figure 6. Map of Flores Ranch in 1809.
According to the property’s 1834 survey, Francisco Antonio Flores initially requested title to four
sitios of land in 1827 (Figure 7). His request reads as follows:
hago presente que tanto mi difunto padre como yo despues de su muerte hemos ocupado y
poceido de buena fee con nuestros vienes de campo y labores el terreno sobre la banda
occidental del Rio de Bexar en el paraje Nombrado los Chayopines y que hayandome en el
dia con numerosa familia y algunos vienes de ganado mayor que me vinieron por erencia
del sitado mi difunto padre y que con mi industria e procurado conservar y aumentar en los
tiempos mas aciagos de la Guerra y revoluciones padecidas en esta frontera…suplico a V.S.
que havida consideración al merito y derecho que por todo lo espuesto tengo adquirido
sobre el referido terreno se sirva mandar se me marsenen en el cuatro citios de tierra para
labor y agostadero…otorgándome de ellos el correspondiente titulo (Flores 1834).
I make present that my deceased father, as well as myself after his death, have occupied and
possessed in good faith, with our field goods and labor, the site on the west bank of the Rio
de Bexar at the paraje named los Chayopines, and that finding myself this day with
numerous family and some ganado mayor that came to my by inheritance from the said my

138

VOLUME 1 (2014)

deceased father, and that with my industry I’ve procured to conserve and augment in the
hardest times of War and revolutions endured in this frontier…I ask His Lordship, that
taking into consideration the merit and right that I have acquired over the said site due to all
the previously exposed, to order the four sitios of land for labor and pasture furrowed…
giving me the corresponding title over them.
According to his request he and his family had inhabited the land prior to 1827 with cattle and other
goods he inherited from his father. He also claimed that his father settled the land before him, thus
implying an even earlier date for the occupation of the ranch by the Flores family. Flores’ request was
approved by the Governor in 1828 (Flores 1834).

Figure 7. Survey of four sitios granted to Francisco Flores in 1828 showing location of the ranch as indicated
in the survey notes (“Flores” 1834).

139

JOURNAL OF TEXAS ARCHEOLOGY AND HISTORY.ORG

In 1833, Flores requested an additional two sitios and two labores adjacent to the four he
previously received on the west bank of the San Antonio River, or wherever there was vacant land
available (Flores 1834). In his request he stated he was over 50 years old, that the land he had at that
time was not large enough to contain sufficient cattle for him to comply with the Law of Colonization
no. 190, that he met the requirements of the article 12 of Law no. 128 of 1830 and that he was making
his request according to a certification issued by the City of San Fernando de Bejar which included a
list of all public positions he served on (Flores 1834). A response to his request was issued a few
months later stating that no land was vacant on the river banks and that at that time it was not
possible to verify if any land was vacant to the west of his property since there were too many claims
over the same area. The response also stated that if the land has not been awarded to anybody else, he
should have priority over such land.
In 1834, the Governor awarded him one sitio and one labor of land (per the Law no. 128 of 1830)
in the area he initially requested as long as title had not been previously issued to anyone else
(Figure 8). The land, including five sitios and one labor, was surveyed by Byrd Lockheart in 1834. The

140

VOLUME 1 (2014)

Figure 9. Overlay of original survey showing the location of the existing structures on site (Flores 1834).
1834 survey clearly showed that a structure existed on the property. It is likely that at the time the
property was surveyed, the original adobe rooms of the main house (still extant) were present and
according to page 14 of the deed, the “Rancho de Don Francisco Flores” was identified both in the
survey notes and the metes and bounds (Flores 1834). The location of the Rancho on the survey
corresponds to the location of the structure today, clearly supporting the premise that the building was
present by 1834 (Figure 9). Francisco Flores claimed to be over 50 years old in 1833 and according to
Ivey, Francisco Flores and his son Vicente were operating Chayopines by 1783 (Ivey 1991:44); it is
likely that the original adobe structure at the Ranch was built prior to at least the 1780s.
According to a 1932 interview of Bruno Villareal, who was 88 years old at the time, “the old
Flores house…had only three rooms when he was a boy of eight [in 1852]…the roof was thick with
adobe…at each of the four corners of the house there was a little fort. The corners were just big
enough for one man and had loopholes…when Indians were on the warpath, people from miles
around came to the Flores house for protection” (Hagner 1940). It appears that a stone church was
located across from the house, and a cemetery with at least three to eight graves and a monument
with a partially legible description (Figure 10) were found in the church yard (Harlohs 1968:2).

The present-day ranch complex includes a small adobe house with multiple additions in wood
and brick. Th main house was documented and recorded in the Historic American Building Survey
(HABS) in 1936 (Figure 11-14). Evidence visible from the interior of the structure shows the original
flat roof was extended to form a gable roof at some point after its original construction. The exterior
walls of the house have remains of the plaster cladding, which has a red tint and scoring to give a
stone block appearance to the walls. The house has wooden doors and windows. In front of the house
there is a brick oven with a pyramidal corbel that forms the top. Across from the main house, there are
the remains of a large tree and evidence of a stone wall is visible.

CONCLUSIONS
Investigation of primary and secondary sources, including original Spanish documents,
demonstrates that it is likely that the Francisco Flores rancho was acquired in part from lands that
belonged to Ygnacio Pena and Mission Espada/Ignacio Calvillo. The archival information also
demonstrates that at least four “Chayopines” ranchos existed in the area. The information I have
collected shows that although Father Solis did stop at one of the Chayopines ranchos during his
expedition in 1767-1768, it is likely he visited one of the other Chayopines ranchos and not the
Francisco Flores property. Further investigation of additional available archival records in the Bexar
Archives and others may clarify some of the questions about these ranchos. In addition, further
investigation of the history of the surrounding ranches may clarify the boundaries and timeline for the
use of these properties.
