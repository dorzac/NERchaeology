A Key to Eleven Common Genera
of Carbonized Wood
Using Scanning Electron Microscope Photographs
Michael W. Pendleton
ABSTRACT
Eleven genera of carbonized wood conunonly found in the southern United
States are keyed, using characteristics that can be observed using darkfield light
microscopy. Scanning electron photomicrographs (SEM) are used to demonstrate these characteristics, since SEM photos have much greater depth of field
than do light photomicrographs.

INTRODUCTION
With increasing interest in prehistoric environment and diet, archeologists
have developed techniques (Struever 1968; Pendleton 1979) that efficiently
recover great quantities of botanical material from archeological sites. Much of
this plant material consists of carbonized wood, since this material does not
readily decay in soil contexts in sites (Western 1963). Carbonized wood fragments commonly retain considerable morphological detail (despite occasional
heat cracking), which allows identification to genus level in many cases (Maby
1932). However, many of the techniques for examining such wood charcoal
characteristics are laborious (Leney and Casteel 1975) because they can involve
the production of thin sections embedded in paraffin and synthetic resins. Such
techniques may not be available to archeologists in on-site situations where
identification of large numbers of charcoal samples may be required (Dimbleby
1967).
Leney and Casteel (1975) have developed a simplified procedure for preparing charcoal specimens for identification. Instead of embedding and thinsectioning the sample (Carlquist 1975), Leney and Casteel (1975) suggest that
the transverse (Figure 1, area A), tangential (Figure 1, area B), and radial (Figure
¯ 1, area C) planes of section for each unknown charcoal fragment be produced
first by breaking the specimen along the appropriate planes. Leney and Casteel
(1975) note that the identification of a charcoal fragment prepared in this way is
facilitated by the use of dark field incident light microscopy (Burrells 1961) in
conjunction with keys such as those written by Panshin and DeZeeuw (1970).
However, a dark field light microscope has a very limited depth of field in a
single focus plane, whereas images of charcoal obtained by scanning electron
microscopy have much greater depth of field than those obtained by light
microscopy. Although scanning electron micrographs of charcoal specimens
have great depth of field, a dark field light microscope can be focused through

several focus planes and serially show much of the detail obtained using an
electron microscope. Scanning electron photomicrographs (Figures 1-35) of 11
common charcoal genera are provided, together with a taxonomic key incorporating characteristics that can be observed using a light microscope.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
All 11 genera of charcoal used in this study were obtained from the Texas
A&M Ethnobotany Laboratory. They included hickory, Carya sp. (Figures 1,
12, 13, 14), willow, Salix goodingii (Figures 2, 3, 4, 5), elm, Ulmus capestris
(Figures 6, 7, 8), oak, Quercus marilandica (Figures 9, 10, 11), ash, Fraxinus sp.
(Figures 15, 16, 17), walnut, Juglans cinerea (Figures 18, 19, 20), cottonwood,
Populus deltoides (Figures 21, 22, 23), birch, Betula sp. (Figures 24, 25, 26),
beech, Fagus sylvalica (Figures 27, 28, 29), sycamore, Platanus occidentalis
(Figures 30, 31, 32), and pine, Pinus stobus (Figures 33, 34, 35). These specimens were taken from living trees, identified to the lowest taxaonomic level
possible, then carbonized in a kiln for 30 minutes at 350°F. Each uncoated
charcoal specimen is a 1-cm cube mounted on aluminum scanning electron
microscope stubs with liquid colloidal silver manufacted by Ted Pella, Inc., of
Tustin, California. A Jeol JSM-25SII scanning electron microscope was used to
produce Figures 1 through 35. The operating conditions of the microscope were:
condenser setting at 12, tilt from 0 to 50°, 5 KeV, 15 to 700 magnification,
contrast from 4.4 to 5.4, aperture 3, and a working distance of 48 mm. For each
charcoal taxa, one tangential and two transverse sectional photomicrographs
were made with the scanning electron microscope using Kodak Tri-X Pan
Professional Film 4164 (ISO 320). Figures 33 through 35 are SEM photos
provided by Kathy Cushman.
RESULTS

The following definitions will make the key to carbonized wood genera
easier to use. A transverse section is produced by breaking the carbonized
specimen across the longitudinal axis of a branch; the tangential section is
produced by breaking a section of the specimen parallel to the growth (or
cambial) layer and perpendicular to the parenchymous ray cells (Leney and
Casteel 1975).
A tree cambium produces xylem cells (as well as fiber cells and thin-walled
parenchymous cells) in annual increments that usually form growth rings that
are visible in transverse section. Trees growing outside the temperate zone will
not always show growth rings because there are no definite periods of growth
and dormancy influenced by climatic changes over single seasons (Western
1963). The annual growth increment pattern for many wood species is for early
wood (tissue produced in the spring) to have xylem cells that are larger in
diameter and thinner walled (Figure 2, area D) than the late wood (produced in
the summer and fall) (Figure 2, area E).

Growth increments in angiosperms (hardwoods like Salix) may have ring
porous wood with a definite band of large early wood pores and a band of
smaller late wood pores in transverse section (Figure 2). These pores are the
vessel elements that are present in most of the angiosperms but not in the
gymnosperms, except for the order Gnetales. Gymnosperms use tracheids rather
than the vessels for water transport through tissues and are termed nonporous
woods. If pores in a growth increment of an angiosperm appear to be the same
size, the wood is termed diffuse-porous (Barefoot and Hankins 1982). Tyloses
are thin walls of tissue that divide larger pores into separate compartments in
transverse section.
Although most gymnosperms do not have vessels, their tracheid cells (which
serve as the conductive ceils in xylem much like vessels in the angiosperms)
may change in diameter gradually or abruptly, depending on the tree’s growth
pattern (Figures 33-35).
The lines of cells that radiate from the center of a tree through both xylem
and phloem in a transverse section of wood are the ray cells. Ray width and
height are best observed in tangential section. Rays can be one cell wide
(uniserate) in tangential section, two cells wide (biserate), or more than two cells
wide (multiserate).
DISCUSSION

This key (Table 1) is based on ones developed by Volman (1981) and
Panshin and DeZeeuw (1970). The charcoal taxa keyed in this study are all from
common tree types that grow in the southern United States so this key should be
useful to archeologists working there.
Although Leney and Casteel (1981) advocate the use of three sectional
views of a carbonized wood fragment for positive identification, Panshin and
DeZeeuw (1970) note that the transverse and tangential sections provide the
most important information for identification for most wood taxa. Ray width
cannot be determined by observation of a radial section. Therefore this key does
not require the examination of the radial section, and radial views are not
included in the illustrations. The transverse sectional views shown in the illustrations have important aids to identification, such as the depiction of scalariform perforation plates (Barefoot and Hankins 1982) in the transverse section of
Betula (Figure 26).
Because scanning electron photomicrographs have great depth of field
(Goldstein, et al. 1984), they provide more information for use in conjunction
with a charcoal identification key than would either thin section or dark field
light photomicrographs alone.
