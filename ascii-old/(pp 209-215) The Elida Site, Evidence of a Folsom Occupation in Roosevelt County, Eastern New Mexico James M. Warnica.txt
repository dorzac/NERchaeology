The Elida Site, Evidence of a Folsom
Occupation in Roosevelt County,
Eastern New Mexico
JAMES M. WARNICA

EARLY MAN SITES afford us a dim view into a distant past, but because
of their scarcity the knowledge has come to us very slowly, bit by bit.
The information these sites provide is priceless, and for the most part a
great amount of time and labor is required to collect and compile the
data obtained from them. Hunting or kill sites give us a very good
idea of how the early hunters ki!led and butchered large game animals, which was their primary source of food. This knowledge comes
mainly from the projectile points that were left in the animal when
it was killed and butchered. Today as excavations are carried out
these projectile points are found with the fossil animal remains and
are assumed to be, for the most part, the primary cause of death at
the hands of Early Man.
Campsites generally provide a better record of the culture of these
early peoples. This record te!ls something of their way of life that
would not be known were these campsites not found and the information they provide not published. This paper is an account of the discovery of a Folsom campsite and the artifacts found there.
This site, here named the Elida site, is located in a sand dune area
six miles east and 12 miles south of Elida, Roosevelt County, New
Mexico, on the Bill Smith Ranch. This locality is some 27 miles southsouthwest of Portales, New Mexico. At one time the site was a cultivated field, but it has long since been abandoned and wind erosion has
scoured it down to a caliche formation over a large area. The artifacts
were found resting on this caliche formation, which normally underlies a red sandy-clay stratum. It is believed that the surface-collected
artifacts were originally in the lower part of the sandy-clay stratum or
in the top part of the caliche. The materials collected suggest that the
Elida site was not only a campsite but a workshop area.
The site was first visited in the afternoon of April 29, 1956, by

ELIDA SITE, NEW MEXICO

Charles Harrison and James M. Warnica of Portales, New Mexico.
Because of the lateness of the hour only a short time was spent at the
site. One complete projectile point (Fig. 1, A), one basal fragment of
another point (Fig. 1, J), and one scraper were collected on this visit.
At the time it was not realized that this was a Folsom campsite.
A second visit to the site was made two days later. The individuals
making this second visit were Charles Harrison, D. L. Hankins, and
James M. Warnica of Portales, New Mexico, and Don Krieble of
Lubbock, Texas. The artifacts collected at this time included one complete projectile point (Fig. 1, C), another point with the distal tip
missing (Fig. 1, B), and a third point that seems to have been broken
when fluting was attempted (Fig. 1, H), as well as several scrapers and
tiny, finely chipped gravers, and a large number of small flint chips,
the residue from manufacture of artifacts. This assemblage seemed
to indicate a Folsom campsite, and Dr. E. H. Sellards of the Texas
Memorial Museum in Austin, Texas, was notified.
A third visit to the site was made in June, 1956. The party consisted of Dr. E. H. Sellards and Otto Schoen of the Texas Memorial
Museum, Don Krieble of Lubbock, Texas, and James M. Warnica.
The time was spent in collecting artifacts from the surface and studying the site. One complete projectile point (Fig. 1, I), two basal fragments (Fig. 1, D, K), and a few scrapers and gravers were collected.
To date a total of 82 artifacts has been collected from the Elida site.
These include eight complete or relatively complete points, 16 fragmentary points, 32 scrapers, 13 gravers, four channel flakes from
fluted points, nine miscellaneous implements, and a large number of
flint flakes.
One point (Fig. 1, H) appears to have been broken when the Folsom
people attempted to remove a channel flake. The person who made the
point roughly shaped it; then he seems to have placed the tip against
a solid object and struck the base a sharp blow. The fracture traveled
up the face for 23 mm. and then turned abruptly through the middle
of the blade, breaking it into two parts. Evidently the force of the blow
caused a smaller flute to travel from the tip for 20 mm. back toward
the base on the opposite face of the blade from the main flute. When
found the point was in three pieces some distance apart. When placed
together they fit perfectly. Only the channel flakes are missing.
The only fossil remains found in the campsite area were a few fragments of animal teeth, but there is no proof of their association with
the artifacts.
It must be assumed that the climate was considerably different

near the site today is to be found in pluvial lake beds that are dry
except after heavy rains. There also must have been a shortage of

local materials for artifacts, for it seems as though every piece of flint
that was large enough was utilized for some purpose. Very small
chips were made into gravers or flaked on one edge so as to be of some
use. One channel flake (Fig. 3, A) was made into an end-scraper. The
nearest available flint supply lies near the Pecos River, 45 miles to
the west of the campsite.
Projectile points, with one exception, seem to be of cruder workmanship than is normally found on Folsom points. This may prove to
be of significance in comparative studies.
Unfortunately the site had been exposed by wind erosion when discovered and no stratigraphy could be determined, but further investigations of the locality may yield significant stratigraphic information.
Three additional projectile points were found near the campsite but
outside the area from which the Folsom points were collected. Two of
these points resemble the Agate Basin type and one is a Scottsbluff
point. One of the Agate Basin points is made of obsidian and has a reworked distal tip. These points, which are considered to be later than
Folsom, probably represent a later occupation of the Elida locality.
