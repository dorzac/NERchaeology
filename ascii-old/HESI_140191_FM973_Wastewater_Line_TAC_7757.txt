ABSTRACT

On 17 and 18 August 2016, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted an
intensive cultural resources survey of Phase 1 of the proposed Farm-to-Market Road (FM) 973
Wastewater Improvements Project located south of Austin-Bergstrom International Airport (ABIA)
in Travis County, Texas (Project Area). The City of Austin (COA) is proposing the construction of
approximately 13,950.0 linear feet (4,253.0 meters [m]) of gravity wastewater main to serve the
Austin [re]Manufacturing Hub, an eco-industrial park located in Austin’s southeastern quadrant.
The proposed right-of-way (ROW) for the undertaking would extend along utility easements that
primarily border FM 973. These utility easements are located on COA property at ABIA and within
public easements on private property. As the undertaking is located on public property, it falls
under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). In addition, the proposed ROW
would also traverse a tributary of Onion Creek. This crossing would require the use of a
Nationwide Permit (NWP) issued by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). As NWPs are
federal permits, the portion of the undertaking under the purview of the USACE also falls under
the regulations of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as
amended. At the request of Civil Land Group, LLC (CLG), Horizon conducted the cultural
resources survey of Phase 1 of the undertaking on behalf of the COA in compliance with the ACT
and Section 106 of the NHPA. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any significant
archeological deposits are located within the Project Area and, if any exist, to determine if the
project has the potential to have any adverse effects on sites eligible for formal designation as
State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs) or sites listed on or considered eligible for listing on the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
Phase 2 of the proposed FM 973 Wastewater Improvements Project is located within
heavily disturbed landfill contexts that have been previously assessed for cultural resources with
negative results. As such, Horizon’s current survey efforts did not include a reassessment of
Phase 2 of the undertaking.
The cultural resources survey of Phase 1 of the proposed FM 973 Wastewater
Improvements Project resulted in the observation of no significant archeological deposits within
the Project Area. No cultural materials were observed on the modern ground surface of the
Project Area or within any of the 40 excavated shovel tests. While the Project Area does extend
across or in close proximity to several previously recorded historic-era archeological sites
(41TV1427, 41TV1630, 41TV1635, and 41TV1654), no standing structures or cultural deposits

associated with these sites were observed within the Project Area during the survey efforts. This
is likely due to the fact that all of the structures on these sites (aside from those associated with
the Moore-Burleson Homestead/Olson Farm complex [41TV1635]) were removed from the flight
path/safety zone of ABIA’s eastern runway when the airport was converted from military to civilian
use. In addition, although the Project Area is situated near 2 additional previously recorded
prehistoric sites (41TV541 and 41TV1629), no prehistoric deposits associated with these sites
were found to extend into the current Project Area.
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the development of
Phase 1 of the proposed FM 973 Wastewater Improvements Project would have no adverse effect
on significant cultural resources that are considered to be eligible for formal designation as SALs
or any cultural resources that are listed on or considered eligible for listing on the NRHP. Horizon
therefore recommends that the development of the property be allowed to proceed relative to the
jurisdiction of the ACT and Section 106 of the NHPA. However, in the unlikely event that any
cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any
point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance within the Project Area, even in previously
surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should cease immediately, and the THC
should be notified of the discovery.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of an intensive cultural resources survey of Phase 1 of
the proposed Farm-to-Market Road (FM) 973 Wastewater Improvements Project located south of
Austin Bergstrom International Airport (ABIA) in Travis County, Texas (Project Area) (Figures 11 and 1-2). The City of Austin (COA) is proposing the construction of approximately 13,950.0
linear feet (4,253.0 meters [m]) of gravity wastewater main to serve the Austin [re]Manufacturing
Hub, an eco-industrial park located in Austin’s southeastern quadrant. The proposed right-of-way
(ROW) for the undertaking would extend along utility easements that primarily border FM 973.
These utility easements are located on COA property at ABIA and within public easements on
private property. As the undertaking is located on public property, it falls under the regulations of
the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). In addition, the proposed ROW would also traverse a
tributary of Onion Creek. This crossing would require the use of a Nationwide Permit (NWP)
issued by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). As NWPs are federal permits, the portion
of the undertaking under the purview of the USACE also falls under the regulations of Section
106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. At the request of
Civil Land Group, LLC (CLG), Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted the
cultural resources survey of Phase 1 of the undertaking on behalf of the COA in compliance with
the ACT and Section 106 of the NHPA. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any
significant archeological deposits are located within the Project Area and, if any exist, to determine
if the project has the potential to have any adverse effects on sites eligible for formal designation
as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs) or sites listed on or considered eligible for listing on the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
The overall ROW (Phases 1 and 2) measures approximately 13,950.0 feet (4,253.0 m) in
length and 70.0 feet (21.3 m) in width, with a total area of 22.4 acres. Phase 1 of construction
measures approximately 11,250.0 feet (3,430.0 m) in length and 70.0 feet (21.3 m) in width, with
a total area of 18.1 acres. The majority of Phase 1 is situated on ABIA property bordering FM 973
where several previously recorded archeological sites have been documented. Only Phase 1 of
the undertaking was assessed during the current survey efforts.
Phase 2 of the undertaking consists of the extreme southern 2,700.0 feet (823.1 m) of the
proposed ROW on Austin Landfill property along FM 973. As Phase 2 is located within heavily
disturbed landfill contexts that have been previously assessed for cultural resources with negative
results, it was not included in the current survey efforts.

Chapter 1.0: Introduction

The cultural resources investigations consisted of an archival review, an intensive cultural
resources survey of the Project Area, and the production of a report suitable for review by the
State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas Historical Commission’s
(THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council of Texas
Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports. Russell K.
Brownlow (Horizon’s Cultural Resources Director) served as the project’s Principal Investigator,
while Briana Smith and Jared Wiersema conducted the field investigations.
Horizon conducted the survey of the Project Area on 17 and 18 August 2016. This entailed
intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing efforts along the length of Phase 1 of
the undertaking. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require
a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in
width. As Phase 1 of the undertaking totaled 11,250.0 feet (3,429.9 m) in length, a minimum of
34 shovel tests was necessary in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the
TSMASS by excavating a total of 40 shovel tests within the Project Area.
The cultural resources survey of Phase 1 of the proposed FM 973 Wastewater
Improvements Project resulted in the observation of no significant archeological deposits within
the Project Area. No cultural materials were observed on the modern ground surface of the
Project Area or within any of the 40 excavated shovel tests. While the Project Area does extend
across or in close proximity to several previously recorded historic-era archeological sites
(41TV1427, 41TV1630, 41TV1635, and 41TV1654), no standing structures or cultural deposits
associated with these sites were observed within the Project Area during the survey efforts. This
is likely due to the fact that all of the structures on these sites (aside from those associated with
the Moore-Burleson Homestead/Olson Farm complex [41TV1635]) were removed from the flight
path/safety zone of ABIA’s eastern runway when the airport was converted from military to civilian
use. In addition, although the Project Area is situated near 2 additional previously recorded
prehistoric sites (41TV541 and 41TV1629), no prehistoric deposits associated with these sites
were found to extend into the current Project Area.
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the development of
Phase 1 of the proposed FM 973 Wastewater Improvements Project would have no adverse effect
on significant cultural resources that are considered to be eligible for formal designation as SALs
or any cultural resources that are listed on or considered eligible for listing on the NRHP. Horizon
therefore recommends that the development of the property be allowed to proceed relative to the
jurisdiction of the ACT and Section 106 of the NHPA. However, in the unlikely event that any
cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any
point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance within the Project Area, even in previously
surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should cease immediately, and the THC
should be notified of the discovery.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

GENERAL PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

The Project Area consists of Phase 1 of the FM 973 Wastewater Line Project in
southeastern Travis County, Texas (see Figures 1-1 and 1-2). It can be found on the US
Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute Montopolis, Texas, topographic quadrangle (see Figure 11). The overall ROW (Phases 1 and 2) measures approximately 13,950.0 feet (4,253.0 m) in
length and 70.0 feet (21.3 m) in width, with a total area of 22.4 acres.
Phase 1 of construction measures approximately 11,250.0 feet (3,430.0 m) in length and
70.0 feet (21.3 m) wide, with a total area of 18.1 acres. It begins east of ABIA near the intersection
of Peace Lane and FM 973 (Figure 2-1). From there, it extends southeastwards approximately
6,500.0 feet (1,981.7 m) to the intersection of Elroy Road and FM 973. This entire stretch of the
Project Area is covered with dense stands of ragweed and other vegetation that decreased
surface visibility to almost 0% in many locations (Figures 2-2 and 2-3). From Elroy Road, the
proposed ROW turns to the southeast in a public easement for 2,400.0 feet (731.7 m) to Linda
Vista Road (Figure 2-4). This area consists of undeveloped land with standing water from heavy
rains that were occurring during the survey efforts (Figure 2-5). From Linda Vista Road, it then
turns back to the southwest for another 1,600.0 feet (487.8 m) until it reconnects to FM 973 on
Austin Landfill property (Figures 2-6 and 2-7). Phase I also includes a short wastewater main
extension that begins at the intersection of FM 973 and Elroy Road and extends southwards
adjacent to FM 973 within a public easement for approximately 750.0 feet (228.7 m) to the
northern portion of Austin Landfill property (Figures 2-8 and 2-9). Only Phase 1 of the undertaking
was assessed during the current survey efforts.
Phase 2 of the undertaking consists of the southernmost 2,700.0 feet (823.2 m) of the
proposed ROW on Austin Landfill property along FM 973. As Phase 2 is located within heavily
disturbed landfill contexts that have been previously assessed for cultural resources with negative
results, it was not included in the current survey efforts.

Blackland Prairie. Elevations within the Project Area range between approximately 450.0 and
520.0 feet (137.2 and 158.5 m) above mean sea level. Hydrologically, the Project Area is situated
within the Colorado River Basin. The northern portion of the Project Area is drained to the
northwest via overland sheet flow into Onion Creek, while the southern portion is drained to the
northwest by an unnamed tributary of Onion Creek. Onion Creek flows to the northeast, joining
the Colorado River approximately 3.9 miles (6.3 kilometer [km]) northeast of the Project Area.

2.3

CLIMATE

The climate in Travis County is generally cool in the winter, with an average temperature
of 49.0 degrees. In the summer months, the average temperature is 83.0 degrees, with an
average daily maximum temperature of 95.0 degrees. The average annual total precipitation is
about 32.0 inches (NRCS 1974).

2.4

FLORA AND FAUNA

The Project Area is in the western portion of the Texan biotic province (Blair 1950), an
intermediate zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian provinces and the
grasslands of the Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces. Some species reach the limits
of their ecological range within the Texan province. The boundary, characterized as

10

140191_arch_survey_report

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of Phase 1 of the Proposed
FM 973 Wastewater Line Right-of-Way in Travis County, Texas

“approximate,” between Blair’s (1950) Texan and Balconian provinces passes through western
Travis County in the vicinity of the Project Area.
The fauna associated with this region are represented by a mixture of species from the
Austroriparian, Tamaulipan, Chihuahuan, Kansan, Balconian, and Texan biotic provinces.
Common mammalian species include white-tailed deer, opossum, eastern cottontail rabbit,
raccoon, striped skunk, hispid cotton rat, white-footed mouse, nine-banded armadillo, and fox
squirrel. Common bird species include northern bobwhite, eastern meadowlark, mourning dove,
killdeer, field sparrow, red-tailed hawk, turkey vulture, belted kingfisher, and mockingbird. Reptile
and amphibian species common to this biotic zone include six-lined racerunner, rat snake, eastern
hognose snake, Gulf Coast toad, Texas spiny lizard, rough green snake, copperhead, western
diamondback rattlesnake, green treefrog, Blanchard’s cricket frog, diamondback water snake,
Houston toad, and green anole. Although small herds of bison and antelope were common during
the late prehistoric and early historic periods, these species are no longer native to this region
(Jurney et al. 1989:13-14).

3.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

3.1

DATABASE REVIEW

Archival research conducted via the Internet at the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
(Atlas) website indicated the presence of 65 previously recorded archeological sites,
2 cemeteries, and 1 NRHP district within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) radius of the Project Area (THC
2016), while a review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) NRHP Google Earth map layer
indicated the presence of the same NRHP district within the review perimeter (NPS 2016). These
documented cultural resources and their distances from the Project Area are summarized in
Table 3-1, while their locations relative to the Project Area are presented in Figure 3-1. As can
be seen in Table 3-1 and Figure 3-1, a total of 7 documented cultural resources are located within
or adjacent to the Project Area. From north to south along the alignment, these consist of
41TV1654, 41TV1629, 41TV1630, 41TV1635, 41TV1427, 41TV541, and the Moore’s Crossing
Historic District.
Site 41TV1654 is located just to the northwest of the Project Area. It consists of a historicera homestead that was identified on historic-era maps and aerial imagery by Hicks & Company
(Hicks) in 1993. When the location was physically assessed by Hicks, the site recorders noted
an old road and landscaping but found that the house had been destroyed and its location was
covered with modern construction. They also noted that artificial fill covered most of the site.
Because the site was destroyed, they assessed it as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP.
Site 41TV1629 is a large prehistoric campsite located just to the northwest of the Project
Area. Also documented by Hicks in 1993, the site was found to possess lithic debris, burned rock,
and faunal remains that occurred mainly along the middle of the terrace slope above Onion Creek.
While Hicks noted that additional testing investigations would better clarify the temporal and
spatial extent of the site as well as its overall significance, they further noted that any testing on
top of the terrace (near where the current Project Area is located) would be futile due to modern
construction and elevated platforms of fill material.
Site 41TV1630 is a historic-era dairy complex whose boundaries overlap the current
Project Area. Documented by Hicks in 1993, the site recorders noted that the site was completely
destroyed, with all structures removed. They also noted a gravel parking lot covering the site. As
the site was destroyed, they assessed it as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP.

Site 41TV1635 is the Moore-Burleson Homestead/Olson Farm. Consisting of a standing
log cabin built in 1847 and several later residential structures, the site was assessed as being
eligible for inclusion in the NRHP when documented by Hicks in 1993. While the Project Area
extends across the boundaries of this site along FM 973, all of the structures composing the

complex are located well to the northwest, outside of the Project Area. Because the current
undertaking would pose no adverse effects to the complex of structures and the ground surface
would be restored to pre-construction conditions, the THC’s History Programs and Architecture
Division indicated that no additional investigations were required for the undertaking with regard
to above-ground historic resources.
Site 41TV1427 is a historic-era homestead documented a short distance to the southeast
of the current Project Area by S.A. Garza Engineers, Inc. in 1989 for a water line project. The
recorders noted that the house has been removed, leaving only a shed, a sidewalk, several mortar
piers, and a scatter of debris on the site. Because the site had been largely destroyed, it was
assessed as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP.
Site 41TV541 is an extensive prehistoric lithic procurement site whose westernmost
boundary is near the current Project Area. Assessed by David Brown in 1981, PBS&J in 2003,
and Hicks in 2007, the site was documented on all occasions as an upland lithic scatter
representing the aboriginal usage of the location for the acquisition of chert raw material. Because
the upland site lacked buried deposits, all recorders assessed the site as ineligible for inclusion
in the NRHP.
Finally, the current Project Area is situated in roadside utility easements that extend
around the perimeter of the Moore’s Crossing Historic District. This NRHP district is composed
of numerous rural architectural structures dating from the early 20th century, including a cotton
gin, a low-water ford and metal truss bridge, a meat market, a general store, and several
homesteads. Because the current undertaking would pose no adverse effects to the structures
composing the district and the ground surface would be restored to pre-construction conditions,
the THC’s History Programs and Architecture Division indicated that no additional investigations
were required for the undertaking with regard to this NRHP district.

3.2

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

Based on the Atlas database, roughly half of the Project Area is situated within areas that
have been previously assessed for cultural resources (Figure 3-2). These prior surveys include
a large area survey conducted in 1979 for a project permitted by the US Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA), a large area survey conducted in 1988 for a municipal utility district (MUD), and a
linear highway project conducted in 2006 for a Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT)
project.
Although not mapped on the Atlas database, the vast majority of the remaining portions
of the proposed ROW were assessed in 1993 and in 2008 by Hicks (Masson et al. 1994; Stotts
and Jones 2008). The 1993 survey was conducted on behalf of the COA as part of the airport
relocation project and covered all the area of the proposed ROW within the ABIA north of Elroy
Road (Figure 3-3). This survey was responsible for documenting the majority of the sites on or
near the current Project Area. The 2008 survey was conducted for another wastewater line along
FM 973 on Austin Landfill property (Figure 3-4). The 2008 survey covered the southernmost
2,700.0 feet (823.2 m) of the currently proposed ROW referred to as Phase 2. It resulted in

negative findings and a determination that the entire stretch of this portion of the proposed ROW
is within heavily disturbed landfill contexts that possess no integrity.

3.3

MAP REVIEW

Based on the areas covered by the prior surveys mapped on the Atlas database and those
assessed by Hicks in 1993 and 2008, only the southernmost 2,000.0 feet (609.8 m) of the current
Project Area is not located within an area that has been previously assessed for cultural
resources. This segment consists of the short curve in the proposed ROW from Linda Vista Road
to FM 973 that crosses a tributary of Onion Creek (see Figures 1-1 and 1-2). The topographic
quadrangles suggest that the proposed ROW extends through the Linda Vista subdivision, while
recent aerial photography suggests that all structures associated with this subdivision have been
removed. Structures associated with this subdivision first appear on the 1973 aerial imagery of
the location and the 1975 topographic quadrangle. While they are still present on the 1998
topographic quadrangle, most appear to have been removed by 2008 on the aerial imagery. As
the structures associated with this short-lived subdivision reflect a late 20th-century development,
the review of the maps and imagery containing this unsurveyed portion of the Project Area
suggested that historic-era resources would not be present in this area.
In regard to the portion of the Project Area north of Elroy Road, where all of the previously
recorded archeological sites on or in proximity to the Project Area are located, aerial imagery as
early as the 1950s and topographic quadrangles from the 1960s depict structures all along the
north side of FM 973, many of which represent the historic-era sites documented along this route.
While the more recent topographic quadrangle (1988) still depicts most of these structures, the
aerial imagery shows that all of the structures in this stretch between Elroy and Pearce roads had
been removed by 2004 with the exception of the cluster of structures composing the MooreBurleson Homestead/Olson Farm (41TV1635) (see Figure 2-2).

3.4

INFORMANT INTERVIEW

During the initial meeting between Horizon and CLG to discuss the cultural survey of the
Project Area, Mr. Greg Ulcak of CLG informed Horizon that the majority of the structures located
on the north side of FM 973 on ABIA property had been removed shortly after the airport was
converted from military to civilian use. These structures were all located within the flight
path/safety zone of ABIA’s eastern runway. As they posed a safety hazard for incoming and
departing aircraft, all structures were removed from this area with the exception of the cluster of
structures composing the Moore-Burleson Homestead/Olson Farm (41TV1635). Because this
site had been assessed as being eligible for inclusion on the NRHP, the log cabin and other
structures on the site were left in place. To date, nothing has been done to these structures and
they currently exist in a dilapidated state.
In addition to the structures on ABIA property along FM 973, Mr. Ulcak also indicated that
the Linda Vista subdivision that is traversed by the Project Area was located within a noise
mitigation area associated with ABIA. Because of this, all residents were bought out and this late
20th-century subdivision was abandoned.

PROBABILITY ASSESSMENT

As discussed above, the vast majority of the Project Area has been previously assessed
for cultural resources. While several historic-era and prehistoric sites were documented within
these previously surveyed areas, all were described as being destroyed, having deposits that did
not warrant further investigations, or only having the potential for significant deposits in areas set
away from the current Project Area. Based on these prior assessments, coupled with the
presence of eroding upland clay soils within the Project Area, it was Horizon’s opinion prior to the
field efforts that there existed a relatively low potential for deeply buried and stratified cultural
deposits that could be eligible for formal designation as SALs or for inclusion in the NRHP within
the Project Area.

4.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

4.1

AGENCY REQUIREMENTS

In a letter dated 11 March 2016, the COA initiated consultation regarding the undertaking
with the THC. The THC responded to the COA’s request in a letter dated 17 May 2016. In this
letter, the THC’s Archeology Division indicated that the route was located in proximity to several
previously recorded archeological sites and requested a pedestrian survey of the proposed ROW
to assess the condition of any of the sites located within or in proximity to the proposed ROW.
In this same letter, the THC’s History Programs and Architecture Division noted that the
proposed ROW is located in immediate proximity to the Moore’s Crossing Historic District, which
is listed on the NRHP, and the Moore-Burleson Homestead/Olson Farm complex (41TV1635),
which has been determined to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. Because the undertaking
would not disturb any above-ground features associated with these historic properties and the
ground surface would be restored to pre-construction conditions, the History Programs and
Architecture Division indicated that no additional investigations were required for the undertaking
with regard to above-ground historic resources.

4.2

METHODOLOGY

To comply with the THC’s Archeology Division pedestrian survey request, a 2-person
Horizon archeological field crew conducted the survey of the Project Area on 17 and 18 August
2016. This entailed intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing efforts along the
length of Phase 1 of the undertaking. The TSMASS require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per
mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width. As Phase 1 of the undertaking
totals 11,250.0 feet (3,429.9 m) in length, a minimum of 35 shovel tests was necessary in order
to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 40 shovel
tests within the Project Area (Figure 4-1). Due to the fact that soils within the Project Area
consisted of sticky clay soils that were saturated by heavy rains, all excavated matrices were
trowel-sorted since the gumminess of the soils prohibited successful screening.
Phase 2 of the undertaking consists of the extreme southern 2700.0 feet (823.0 m) of the
proposed ROW on Austin Landfill property. As Phase 2 is located within heavily disturbed landfill
contexts that were previously assessed by Hicks in 2008 with negative results, it was not included
in the current survey efforts.

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of Phase 1 of the Proposed
FM 973 Wastewater Line Right-of-Way in Travis County, Texas

Field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, land forms, shovel tests, and
cultural materials observed (if any). Standardized shovel test forms were completed for every
shovel test. These forms included location data, depth, soil type, and notations on any artifacts
encountered. If any new archeological sites were recorded, standard site forms were to be
completed and filed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) for permanent
housing. Similarly, if any previously recorded archeological sites were assessed, updated site
forms were to be completed and filed at TARL.
A selective collection strategy was utilized during the survey efforts wherein only
diagnostic cultural materials were to be collected for eventual curation at an approved facility or
for return to the appropriate landowner. Non-diagnostic artifacts were to be tabulated and
assessed in the field and placed back where they were found. Digital photographs with a photo
log were completed as appropriate. The locations of all shovel tests were recorded via handheld
global positioning system (GPS) units utilizing the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)
coordinate system and the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83) (see Figure 4-1). Shovel
test data are presented in Appendix A.

4.3

FIELD CONDITIONS

Horizon’s survey efforts were conducted in the middle of an 11-day stretch in August
during which heavy rains occurred across Texas. As a result, the clay and silty clay soils within
the Project Area were heavily saturated, with standing water present on the surface at several
locations. The standing water made surface inspection impossible at many locations, while the
sticky, wet clay soils precluded successful screening attempts of the excavated shovel test
matrices. In addition to the wet conditions, dense stands of ragweed covered extensive portions
of the Project Area, further obscuring the surface visibility across the Project Area (see Figures 22 and 2-3). While large features would have been observable, the dense vegetation and, in some
spots standing water, greatly diminished the potential for observing smaller individual cultural
materials, if present.

5.0 RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

5.1

RESULTS

The cultural resources survey of Phase 1 of the proposed FM 973 Wastewater
Improvements Project resulted in the observation of no significant archeological deposits within
the Project Area. No cultural materials were observed on the modern ground surface of the
Project Area or within any of the 40 excavated shovel tests. While the Project Area does extend
across or in close proximity to several previously recorded historic-era archeological sites
(41TV1427, 41TV1630, 41TV1635, and 41TV1654), no standing structures or cultural deposits
associated with these sites were observed within the Project Area during the survey efforts. This
is likely due to the fact that all of the structures composing these sites (aside from those
associated with the Moore-Burleson Homestead/Olson Farm complex [41TV1635]) were
removed from the flight path/safety zone of ABIA’s eastern runway when the airport was
converted from military to civilian use. In addition, although the Project Area is situated near
2 additional previously recorded prehistoric sites (41TV541 and 41TV1629), no prehistoric
deposits associated with these sites were found to extend into the current Project Area. Horizon’s
observations regarding each of the sites that had been previously documented within or in
proximity to the Project Area are discussed, from north to south along the proposed ROW, below.
5.1.1

41TV1654

Site 41TV1654 is a historic-era homestead located just to the northwest of the Project
Area at its northern end. Hicks originally documented the site in 1993 based on its location on
historical maps. However, when they assessed the physical location, they found that the house
had been destroyed and its location was covered with modern construction. They also noted that
artificial fill covered most of the site. Because the site was destroyed, Hicks assessed it as
ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP.
As would be expected, Horizon’s field efforts also found little evidence of this site at the
mapped location. The field crew did note the presence of decorative limestone and mortar circular
beds ringing 2 trees near the edge of FM 973 that were likely at the driveway entrance to this
homestead (Figure 5-1). However, no other evidence of the occupation was found within the
Project Area, and dense gravels in the excavated shovel tests are likely from the modern parking
area on the site. Because the site has been destroyed, the current undertaking would pose no
adverse effects to any significant cultural deposits.

Chapter 6.0: Results of Investigations

5.1.2

41TV1629

Site 41TV1629 is a large prehistoric campsite that is also located northwest of the Project
Area on a terrace above Onion Creek. When documented in 1993 by Hicks, the recorders noted
that prehistoric deposits were prominent on the northern slope of the site down by the creek.
However, they also noted that any testing on top of the terrace (near where the current Project
Area is located) would be futile due to modern construction and elevated platforms of fill material.
Horizon’s field crew excavated numerous shovel tests within the Project Area to the
southeast of this linear site (see Figure 4-1). All of the excavated tests revealed shallow clay soils
underlain by dense gravel deposits. None of the shovel tests produced any evidence of
prehistoric materials. Based on the negative shovel testing results, the cultural deposits
associated with site 41TV1629 do not appear to extend into the current Project Area. As such,
the current undertaking would pose no adverse effects to any significant cultural deposits.
5.1.3

41TV1630

Site 41TV1630 is a historic-era dairy complex whose mapped boundaries overlap the
current Project Area. When documented by Hicks in 1993, the site recorders noted that the site
was completely destroyed with all structures removed. They also noted a gravel parking lot
covering the site. As the site had been destroyed, they assessed it as ineligible for inclusion in
the NRHP.

30

140191_arch_survey_report

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of Phase 1 of the Proposed
FM 973 Wastewater Line Right-of-Way in Travis County, Texas

Horizon’s field efforts found no evidence of this site within the current Project Area aside
from gravels from the noted parking lot. A large chinaberry tree is present at the mapped location,
possibly reflecting an ornamental tree planting during the utilization of the site (Figure 5-2).
However, nothing else associated with the utilization of the location as a dairy was noted within
the Project Area. Because the site has been destroyed, the current undertaking would pose no
adverse effects to any significant cultural deposits.
5.1.4

41TV1635

Site 41TV1635 is the Moore-Burleson Homestead/Olson Farm. It consists of a standing
log cabin built in 1847 and several later residential structures (Figures 5-3 and 5-4). When
documented by Hicks in 1993, they assessed it as being eligible for inclusion on the NRHP. While
the currently proposed ROW would extend across the mapped boundaries of this site where it
borders FM 973, the complex of structures comprising the site is located several hundred feet to
the northwest of the proposed ROW and would not be affected. Moreover, Horizon’s shovel
testing efforts within the Project Area across this site adjacent to FM 973 revealed only sterile
shallow clay soils that were incapable of containing buried and stratified cultural deposits
associated with the utilization of the site. The THC’s History Programs and Architecture Division
originally indicated that no additional investigations were required for the current undertaking with
regards to above-ground historic resources since it would pose no adverse effects to the complex
of structures and the ground surface would be restored to pre-construction conditions. Based on
the negative shovel testing efforts, it is Horizon’s opinion that the undertaking would pose no
adverse effects to any subsurface cultural deposits associated with the site.
5.1.5

41TV1427

Site 41TV1427 is a historic-era homestead documented a short distance to the southeast
of the current Project Area by S.A. Garza Engineers, Inc. in 1989 for a water line project. The
recorders noted that the house has been removed, leaving only a shed, a sidewalk, several mortar
piers, and a scatter of debris on the site. Because the site had been predominantly destroyed, it
was assessed as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP. The Atlas depicts the location of this site
on the alignment of FM 973, suggesting that its original location is now covered by the highway
or is within the modern road ROW.
Horizon’s field efforts found no evidence of this historic-era homestead within the limits of
the current Project Area. Because the site was described as being destroyed and no portion of it
is present within the current Project Area, the current undertaking would pose no adverse effects
to any significant cultural deposits.
5.1.6

41TV541

Site 41TV541 is an extensive prehistoric lithic procurement site whose westernmost
boundary is near the current Project Area. Assessed by David Brown in 1981, PBS&J in 2003,
and Hicks in 2007, the site was documented on all occasions as an upland lithic scatter
representing the aboriginal usage of the location for the acquisition of chert raw material.

Figure 5-4. Historic-era house on site 41TV1635, outside of Project Area
Because the upland site lacked buried deposits, all previous recorders assessed the site as
ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP.
The alignment of the current Project Area is located in proximity to the westernmost edge
of this site as mapped on the Atlas database. At this location, the Project Area would be within
existing, heavily disturbed utility and drainage easements along the southern edge of Elroy Road
(Figure 5-5). During Horizon’s field efforts, the crew found no evidence of prehistoric materials
within the Project Area at this location. If any had ever been present on the upland surface, the
modern development would have served to erase any evidence of them. Due to the existing
disturbances at this location and lack of observed prehistoric materials associated with this site,
it is Horizon’s opinion that the undertaking would pose no adverse effects to any cultural deposits.

The alignment of the current Project Area is situated within existing, heavily disturbed
roadside utility and drainage easements that border the southeastern end of the Moore’s Crossing
Historic District (Figure 5-6). This NRHP district is comprised of numerous rural architectural
structures dating from the early 20th century, including a cotton gin, a low-water ford and metal
truss bridge, a meat market, a general store, and several homesteads. Because the undertaking
would pose no adverse effects to the structures composing the district and the ground surface
would be restored to pre-construction conditions, the THC’s History Programs and Architecture
Division indicated that no additional investigations were required for the undertaking with regard
to this NRHP district.

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of Phase 1 of the Proposed
FM 973 Wastewater Line Right-of-Way in Travis County, Texas

Horizon’s field efforts found the alignment of the Project Area in the vicinity of this NRHP
district to be within heavily disturbed landfill and utility easements ringing the perimeter of the
mapped boundaries of the district. Shovel testing efforts within the heavily disturbed contexts
revealed no cultural deposits associated with the utilization of this rural district. They also
revealed no potential for these easements to contain intact, buried cultural deposits. Based on
the shovel testing efforts, it is Horizon’s opinion that the undertaking would pose no adverse
effects to any subsurface cultural deposits associated with this NRHP district.

5.2

RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the development of
Phase 1 of the proposed FM 973 Wastewater Improvements Project would have no adverse effect
on significant cultural resources that are considered to be eligible for formal designation as SALs
or any cultural resources that are listed on or considered eligible for listing on the NRHP. Horizon
therefore recommends that the development of the property be allowed to proceed relative to the
jurisdiction of the ACT and Section 106 of the NHPA. However, in the unlikely event that any
cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any
point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the proposed access road, even in
previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should cease immediately,
and the THC should be notified of the discovery.
