Firearms and Related Artifacts from the Vinson Site
Jay C. Blaine

ABSTRACT
This paper describes the European firearms and related artifacts (primarily
gunflints) from the Vinson Site in Limestone County, Texas. Analysis of this
material indicates that the firearms at the site date between ca. 1760 and 1790.

INTRODUCTION
A small sample of European firearms and related armament artifacts have
been recovered at the Vinson Site over the years (see Smith, this volume). These
specimens are described in this paper, with the primary focus of the analysis
being the determination of the origin, kind, and dating of the gun parts found at
the site.
Virtually all the analyses were done by the author in 1968. At that time
pertinent reference materials were scarce, and consequently some promising
artifact categories were treated in considerable detail. Although later available
sources on firearms and related artifacts have been added to this paper, no
significant changes in the original findings were required.
An excellent explantion of the problems involved in identifying the origin
and dating of gun parts found in North American archeological sites may be
found in Indian Trade Guns (Hamilton 1960). Peterson (1956) also outlines
some of the difficulties in dealing with these materials. Harris et al. (1965:316320) and Blaine and Harris (1967:33) outline the general scope of the problem
concerning analysis of such material from Texas and Oklahoma sites.
The latter authors conclude that a primary research need continues to be the
publication of detailed descriptions and illuslrations of such material from archeological sites, in conjunction with interpretive analyses. Hopefully, with the
compilation and publication of such gun parts data, generally reliable and useful
interpretations can be obtained.
Before beginning the discussion of the firearms material from the Vinson
site, it is important to point out that because of frequently severe oxidation and
no major cleaning for most of the iron or steel parts, only those dimensions that
(in the author’s judgement) could be determined within 0.79 mm (1/32") of the
original have been listed. Thickness measurements on brass specimens were
taken along the center line of the long axis when possible; most of the brass is
cast brass that is irregular in thickness.

Unless otherwise noted, the general size of the gun parts appears more
suitable for comparatively light fusils (smooth bore) or pistols than from
regulation-sized muskets. All gun parts are assumed to be from flintlocks since
no uniquely percussion gun traits are noted in the assemblage.
ANALYSIS OF FIREARMS MATERIAL
FROM THE VINSON SITE
The reader is referred to Blaine and Harris (1967:Figure 26 and 27) for
illustrations of the type of weapon parts described from the Vinson site. The
terminology of flintlock muskets also is based on Blaine and Harris (1967).
Cock

No. of Specimens: 1
Provenience: surface
The cock is made of iron. The comb is plain and rectangular with the long
axis fore and aft, and it is narrow and ungrooved with a step in the forward
surface ~igure ld). The comb end is plain, while the cock base is flat-faced with
beveled edges. The form of the cock is a goose neck with a sharp general
curvature. The cock jaw outline appears oval, but oxidation has severely damaged the edges. The jaw screw hole appears stripped of its threads.
Measurements: Total length, 71.5 mm; dimension from center of tumbler
hole to jaw top is 38 mm.
Remarks: From the basis of its size, proportions, and general curvature, this
cock would fit comfortably amid those from the Gilbert Site; that is, cocks believed to be representative of guns utilized in the mid-eighteenth century French
trade (Blaine and Harris 1967:43-47 and Figure 30-31). However, it would be
unique among that group in one attribute: the comb, although narrow, is rectangular in cross-section with a long axis parallel to the long axis of the jaw. Comparison with the author’s reference collection from several areas at the Spanish
Fort sites that have significant amounts of eighteenth century French trade
materials show the same type of gun cock. It would appear that this gun cock
was a very minor type used in the French trade, probably within the second half
of the eighteenth century, although a non-trade gun from an English source is
also possible. In any case, it is from a civilian, non-militaryfusil.
Frizzen
No. of Specimens: 1
Provenience: surface
The term frizzen refers to the combined "steel" and flashpan cover of the
firearm. The top of the steel section is rounded, the front is beveled with one
facet at the top, and there are two more facets parallel to the long axis that extend
down to the flashpan cover section (see Figure lg). The frizzen is slightly curved
and smooth-faced on the striking surface or the "steel."

Figure 1. Vinson Site Firearms: a-b, sideplates; c, butt plate; d, cock; e-f, barrels; g, frizzen.

Measurements: Length of steel, 39.9 mm; width of steel, 22.6 mm; width of
pan cover, 22.9 mm; width of pivot body, 7.9 mm.
Remarks: The size and general form of this frizzen is comparable with
seven of the ffizzens from the Gilbert Site (Blaine and Harris 1967:38, 51). The
outer pan cover edge is broken, and whether it was round or straight-edged
cannot be determined. This frizzen is smaller than those common to English
Northwest guns of the nineteenth century.
It is doubtful that this type and size of frizzen indicates the use at the Vinson
site of Northwest trade guns dating after the last quarter of the eighteenth
century. However, it does agree in size and form with those from ca. 1750 era
guns used in the French trade. Unfortunately, typical examples from English
trade guns of the same period are not well defined, meaning we cannot rule out
the possibility that this frizzen might be from such a weapon.

Flashpan

No. of Specimens: 2
Provenience: surface (1), House 4 (1)
Both flashpans are made of iron, and are poorly preserved. Flashpan No. 1
may have been removable, although a possible tang on the pan could be a
fragment of the lock-plate edge. The shape or size of the piece cannot be
accurately estimated, but one attribute stands out: a prominent flash or drip
shield.
Measurements: None feasible.
Flashpan No. 2 is removable and the tang has been twisted and bent. The
lower pan surface appears to be of the faceted or shallow "V" form, while the pan
is bridled (i.e., has a strap that extends to support the frizzen screw).
Measurements: Width across flashpan, approximately 24.6 mm.
Remarks: While not measurable with accuracy, the flash or drip shield on
Flashpan No. 1 is significantly taller than those on typical flashpans for ca. 1750
guns commonly used in the French trade (Harris et al. 1965:321-323; Blaine and
Harris 1967:40-41). The relatively high shield was a consistent attribute for the
Northwest or English trade gun by ca. 1775 (Hanson 1955:65-67). Flashpan No.
1, then, appears most likely to be from an eighteenth century English trade
affiliatedfusil or military firearm.
Flashpan No. 2, being removeable and faceted, is typical of mid-eighteenth
century French trade guns. However, the pan is bridled, a characteristic the
author has not found among the typical ca. 1750 French trade gun flashpans.
Hanson (1955:36) notes that the reinforcing bridle does not appear on Northwest
guns until ca. 1820. This attribute indicates a better quality (possibly military)
eighteenth century gunlock, one not common on ordinary quality locks until the
mid-nineteenth century. In any case, a post-1750 date seems indicated for this
flashpan; a ca. 1775-1820 Kentucky type rifle is a very remote possibility for the
specimen.
Frizzen Spring
No. of Specimens: 1
Provenience: House 5
This frizzen spring has broken into two parts, and the break occurred in the
apex of the spring bend; break surfaces are uniformly oxidized and both spring
fragments match in size and edge shape (Figure 21, m). The spring screw of the
piece engaged from within (hidden) and the bulbous finial is complete. The
upper leaf of the frizzen spring is not notched for a bridle rink.
Measurements: Lower leaf, center of screw hole to apex of outside bend,
34.6 mm; upper leaf, end spring to apex of outside bend, 46 mm; maximum
width (spring stud not included), 11.5 mm.
Remarks: The frizzen spring is sized in the upper range for tradefusils but
below military musket in dimensions. Based on its condition, it was probably
still in use when it was broken.

Provenience: House 2 (1), House 5 (1)
Spring No. 1, from House 2, is complete.
Measurements: Total length, 33.3 mm; width, 9.65 mm.
Remarks: The size of Spring No. 1 definitely suggests that it is from a
military musket.
Spring No. 2, from House 5 (Figure 2k), has the spring loop or tab partially
broken away.
Measurements: Estimated total length, 30 mm; width, 8.5 mm.
Remarks: Spring No. 2 probably is within the upper size range for light

fusits.

Side Screw

No. of Specimens: 2
Provenience: surface (1), House 1 (1)
Side screws are used to hold the lock plate onto the gun (Figure 2i-j). One to
three such screws pass through the side plate (if used) and the wood stock,
screwing into the inside of the lock plate.
Measurements: Side screw No. 1, length, 44.5 mm; head diameter, 11.9
mm. Side screw No. 2, length, 44.5 mm; head diameter, 11.43 mm.
Remarks: Both side screws could be from the samefusil based on their size.
Trigger Guard
No. of Specimens: 7
Provenience: surface (2), House 2 (1), House 3 (1), Feature 25 (1), House 5 (2)
Guard fragment No. 1 (brass) is a cast finial and a portion of the tang (see
Figure 2a and Figure 3a). It is convex on the external surface, slightly concave on
the internal surface, and thickest in the center. There is a hole through the tang,
and the tang is broken across one end of the piece.
Measurements: Maximum width, 12.7 mm; thickness, 1.65 to 2.0 mm.
Remarks: This is probably the rear tang and finial for a trigger guard and it
was held to the stock by a screw. The shape of the finial, and the cross section of
the tang, do not match any trigger guard examined by the author from eighteenth
century sites such as Womack, Angola (Harris et al. 1965:324-327) and Gilbert
(Blaine and Harris 1967:71-81) where French trade materials were predominant.
The finial shape also does not match those from the ca. 1740 probable English
guns at Fort Frederica (Shiner n.d.) nor described English trade guns dating after
approximately 1770 (Hanson 1955:41).
Guard fragment No. 2 is a cast brass tang section that has been broken
across both ends. One end break was through a countersunk screw hole into the
convex exterior surface of the piece. The cross section of guard fragment No. 2 is
piano-convex, but viewed laterally the tang section is now bent in a "U" shape
with the convex surface to the outside of the specimen. The screw hole is
unusually small in diameter. In plan view the trigger guard is widest at the end
with the screw hole, measuring 1.52 mm wider here than on the other end.
Measurements: Maximum width, 12.7 mm; thickness, 1.65 mm to 2.3 mm.
Remarks: This possible trigger guard tang section also does not match those
from the Womack or Gilbert sites, where ca. 1720 to 1750 French trade guns
were found.
The edge of the break through the countersunk hole has been lightly
smoothed, and the "U" bend is opposite to that normally produced by the
wrenching of such parts from the gun stock. Also, the convex surface has been
left to the outside. All these factors suggest an attempt was made to alter a trigger
guard to a ring (finger?) form. The size of the screw hole probably is indicative
of a screw and guard too small to be practical on a military musket.

Figure 3. Vinson Site Firearms: a-b, trigger guard fragments; c, butt plate; d-h, side plates.

Guard fragment No. 3 is a cast brass bow section that has been broken at
each end (see Figure 2c and Figure 3b). The plain bow is piano-convex in crosssection (the piano-surface has a strong mold line), but is slightly asymmetrical
and undecorated.
Measurements: Maximum width, 23.1 mm; thickness of 2.79 mm at the
point of maximum width.
Remarks: This bow section may be from the trigger guard of a light English smoothbore, or trade gun, prior to the period of its final type standardization. There is some resemblance to the bow from a ca. 1775 trade gun illustrated
by Hanson (1955:plate XXIA) except that the Vinson bow is not "cupped," nor
perhaps quite so deep, and it is of brass, not iron. The Vinson bow more closely
resembles those from sporting guns.
The trade gun illustrated by Hanson (1955) also does not have the final
deep bow typical of the Northwest gun in the nineteenth century. Since S. James
Gooding (1960:85) mentions the possible use of the large guard as early as 1740
in Northwest guns, it may have taken fifty or sixty years for this type of trigger

170

guard to be established as a regular feature. In contrast, the usual bow sections
from weapons believed to be ca. 1720 and 1750 French trade guns bear no resemblance to this Vinson bow (Harris et al. 1965:324-327; Blaine and Harris
1967:71-81). The lack of symmetry and decoration do suggest the piece is of
ordinary quality.
Guard fragment No. 4 is brass, cast, and broken across one end (see Figure
2b). The specimen is from the piano-convex shaped tang, and a single facet
bevels the convex surface across the finished end. The complete end is 0.8 mm
wider than the broken end of the guard fragment.
Measurements: Maximum width, 11.9 mm; thickness 3.30 mm.
Remarks: This is probably a trigger guard tang end. Similar tang ends are
noted on many American "Kentucky" or "Pennsylvania" and "Plains" rifles of
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.
Guard fragment No. 5 is of iron, and it has been broken in bow and tang
as well as having been flattened.
Remarks: This specimen is too fragmentary and battered for measurements,
but its appearance is similar to iron and brass trigger guards on French trade
guns in the eighteenth century (Blaine and Harris 1967:71-81). The earliest identified Northwest gun types, dating ca. 1775, have iron guards (Hanson 1955:41).
This guard is not a Northwest type from this period, but could represent an earlier
period English trade or sporting gun.
Guard fragment No. 6, from House 5, is cast in brass (see Figure 2d). It is
part of the bow, broken across both ends, and it is piano-convex in cross-section. The guard has deep, apparently filed, lines that border each edge of the
exterior surface.
Measurements: Maximum length, 19.7 mm; thickness, 2.8 mm; maximum
width (tapered in plan), 15.5 mm.
Guard fragment No. 7, also from House 5, is cast in brass (see Figure 2e).
This complex fragment probably is from the rear, or proximal, part of a guard
bow; it is broken twice across one end of the bow and once across the rear tang
juncture. It is piano- to bi-convex in cross-section.
Measurements: Maximum length, 17 mm; maximum width (tapered in
plan), 14.4 mm.
Remarks: Both House 5 guard fragments are from different trigger guards.
Neither are common mid-eighteenth century French trade examples. Fragment
No. 7 is a guard of split-tail variety. Such guards occur by the late eighteenth
century on English style civilian-oriented fowlers and Pennsylvania (Kentucky)
dries, but usually the guards are much narrower on the latter rifles. The author
is inclined to assign Fragment No. 7 to an English style civilian smooth-bore. A
more complete example of this style of guard was found at the Stansbury site on
the Brazos River (Stephenson 1970:Plate 8K).

Trigger Plate
No. of Specimens: 1
Provenience: House 2
This iron trigger plate is complete. The trigger slot is centered laterally,
while the upper plate (toward the muzzle) end has a threaded hole. This end is the
thickest when viewed laterally, and the plate slightly tapers towards its lower
end.
Measurements: Thickness, upper end, 4.83 mm; thickness, lower end, 4.57
mm; distance from the upper end to the center of the threaded hole, 7.11 mm;
total length, 61 mm; maximum width, 16 mm; length of trigger slot, 19.8 mm;
diameter of threaded hole, 4.32 mm.
Remarks: This style of trigger plate was used with a breech tang screw that
passed downward through the tang and engaged the plate. The gun parts from the
Gilbert Site had the same type of trigger plate attachment (Blaine and Harris
1967:61).
Hanson (1955:16-18) notes that all the ca. 1770-1830 Northwest guns he
examined had tang screws coming up from below the tang. Shiner’s (n.d.) report
on 10 trigger plates from the ca. 1740 guns from Fort Frederica included only
one trigger plate from afusil-sized gun. This suggests that trigger plates were not
generally used by the English at that time and with that class of weapon. Unfortunately, the description of the Fort Frederica breech plugs does not indicate
whether the tang screw holes were threaded or were externally countersunk; the
direction these screws were attached to the plate was not determined. Nevertheless, in the light of present knowledge, this trigger plate, if from a trade gun, is
more likely to be from a ca. 1750 French trade gun than from an English
Northwest gun dating after 1830.
Butt Plate

No. of Specimens: 2
Provenience: House 1 (1), House 4 (1)
Butt plate No. 1 (House 1) is a tang and finial section of cast brass that was
broken in the neck of the tang. It is slightly concave underneath the piece and
convex on the external surface. The finial is pierced with a square hole. The
specimen is engraved with an abstract foliate pattern (see Figure 3c).
Measurements: Length, 58 mm; maximum width, 20.3 mm; thickness, 1.52
mm to 2.03 mm.
Remarks: Hamilton (1960:Figure 52, Item 4) illustrates a similar tang from
a Little Osage site dated between 1730-1775. Similar tangs come from a site at
Spanish Fort, Montague County, Texas (J. C. Blaine collection), and the Longest
Site, Jefferson County, Oklahoma (Blaine 1967:Figure 55).

172

Texas Archeological Society

Shiner (n.d.) illustrates four similar tang and finial sections from Fort
Frederica, and the deposition of the Fort Frederica specimens likely dates between 1736 and 1743, but certainly no later than 1760 (Manucy 1959). If the
author understands Shiner correctly, the butt plates with these tangs were relatively flat and held to the stock with seven small nails. The ca. 1755 Northwest
gun discussed by Hanson (1955) also had a nailed butt plate; however, the tang
and finial are undecorated and simpler in overall outline (Hanson 1955:16,74-75).
This butt plate finial and tang section probably is from an English utility
light musket, orfusil, dating between ca. 1700-1770. The Fort Frederica data
showed that similar weapons certainly were in Colonial service by about 1740.
Apparently by then they were also suitable trade goods for Indian use. By the
middle eighteenth century some of this type of gun’s characteristics were shared
by the English Northwest guns, but it has not been determined whether this was
the type of weapon originally intended for the Indian trade (see Hamilton
1980:Figure 51 for additional examples of this type of gun).
Buttplate No. 2, from House 4, is a toe section of cast brass (see Figure lc).
The plate is broken twice, with one break passing through a countersunk screw
hole. The plate has been battered, but appears to have been thickest in the area
around the screw hole. The plate edges are beveled or rounded.
Measurements: Maximum thickness, 2.79 mm; maxumum diameter of screw
hole, 8.64 mm.
Remarks: Butt plate sections similar to No. 2 from Vinson are found on
such sites as Womack (Harris et al. 1965:337-341) and Gilbert (Blaine and Harris
1967:61-67) where ca. 1720 and 1750 French trade materials have been found.
Hanson (1955:18) indicates that English and Belgian manufacturers of the
Northwest trade gun who supplied the American nineteenth century trade furnished two screw butt plates. One of these screws would be in the toe section;
this butt plate section would be similar to the specimen from the Vinson site.
However, Hanson (1955:16, 40, 75-76) further states that all Northwest guns
haveflat butt plates of sheet brass and this appears to be the case from 1775 on.
This Vinson specimen is not flat nor of sheet brass, and it has beveled to rounded
edges. Furthermore, from ca. 1775 to ca. 1826, the butt plate of the standard
Northwest gun was fastened with six or seven small, square, iron spikes (Hanson
1955:16, 40). Additionally, at Fort Frederica, the plates from English light
muskets orfusils were held on the stock by seven square spikes (Shiner n.d.).
Hamilton (1960:Figure 50) illustrates a butt plate section similar to the No.
2 Vinson specimen in company with some butt plates of the nailed-on Northwest
gun type from a site dated 1790-1815. However, he does note that the specimen
used a screw attachment but further contrasts with the Northwest type guns by
virtue of the more rounded butt plate edges.
J. N. George’s (1947:104) description of the good to fine grade eighteenth
century English sporting gun indicates that these weapons also utilized a screw in
the toe area of the butt plate. He illustrates the details of finials, side plates, and
escutcheons believed to be typical or standard for that class of weapon. To date,

Blaine ~ Vinson Site Firearms

173

the author has not matched any gun parts from Texas sites with those illustrated
by George (1947). It seems likely that the finer quality English guns were not a
significant item in the Indian trade in Texas.
In light of the above information, this toe section of butt plate from the
Vinson site is probably from an eighteenth century French trade gun.
Side Plate
No. of specimens: 7
Provenience: House 1 (1), House 2 (2), House 3 (2), House 5 (2)
Sideplate No. 1 (House 1) has been fashioned into a metal arrowpoint from
a probable cast brass side plate (see Figure 3d). The specimen has been lightly
pounded and re-shaped on all edges. An engraved design on the piece, consisting
of a fern-like (flax?) leaf or frond, indicates its probable side plate origin.
Measurements: Length, 39.4 mm; width, 14 mm; thickness, 1.52 mm.
Remarks: Blaine (1967:172 and Figure 55q) describes a side plate from the
Lower Tucker Site, Montague County, Texas, that incorporates two decorative
elements virtually identical to that on No. 1 from Vinson. On the Lower Tucker
specimen each frond or leaf extends from a central design with scalloped borders; the frond on the Vinson specimen also seems based upon a section of
scalloped design. A side plate from the Roseborough Lake Site, Bowie County,
Texas (R. K. Harris collection), has a similar decorative configuration although
the extended floral elements are slightly different.
I presently believe that such side plates probably are from fusils (light
muskets or fowlers) originally introduced in the French Indian trade during the
second half of the eighteenth century. This particular decorative design has not
been found at the ca. 1750 Gilbert Site (Blaine and Harris 1967:68-71).
Side plates No. 2 and No. 3 are from House 2, while Side plate No. 4 is from
House 3. They are all of cast and flat brass. The flat outer surfaces of the
sideplates have fine detailed line engravings. The plate outlines probably were
produced in the casting of the pieces, and then the edges were finish-filed to an
undercut form (i.e., beveled toward the interior surfaces).
Side plate No. 2 (see Figure 3e) is broken across both ends, and Side plate
No. 3 (see Figure 30 has been broken distally at the upper front of the coil. This
piece is complete with a screw hole in the proximal end, and notched along the
coil’s outer edge.
Side plate No. 4 (see Figure 3g) is broken at both ends and through the top
screw tab. The top screw tab also bears head scoring from a side screw.
Measurements: No. 2, Thickness, 1.35 mm to 1.65 mm. No. 3, Thickness,
1.35 mm to 1.60 mm. No. 4, Thickness, 1.27 mm to 1.57 mm.
Remarks: Side plate fragments No. 2 through 4 are from "Dragon" or
"Serpent" side plates; No. 2 is a distal fragment, No. 3 a proximal part, and No. 4
is the medial part of a side plate. Side plates No. 2 and No. 4 closely match in
engraving technique and pattern and may be from the same side plate. Two or

174

Texas Archeological Society

possibly three stylistically similar individual fusils appear to be represented by
the serpent side plates.
The dragon or serpent was used as a decorative motif for side screw plates
from the early seventeenth century to the late nineteenth century. Russell
(1957:127-130) has traced some of the different versions in use through this
period. However, shortly after 1700 the use of serpent side plates was relatively
confined to trade guns and light secondary military or sporting fusils such as
those at Fort Frederica (Shiner n.d.), and eventually the serpent side plates were
used only on trade guns. Their use on trade guns lasted until after the Civil War
in America (Hanson 1955:71). Where the English trade gun is concerned, one
particular form of the serpent plate became standard by the late eighteenth
century (Hanson 1955:15-16, 38-39).
Although the Vinson Site specimens are broken, each fragment can be
matched in general outline with a corresponding portion of a complete standard
serpent plate. The post-1780 standard version is of brass and apparently cast in
an iron mold (Hanson 1955:3, 15). However, the casting produces details of the
serpent both in outline and in low relief. I believe that the fiat specimens like
those from the Vinson Site also were cast in molds that formed them in outline
but left the surface flat. The details of the serpent were then engraved into this
surface. These differences in treatment of surface detail appear to have chronological significance. For convenience, the flat engraved serpent side plates from
the Vinson Site are labelled as engraved-detail and the "standard" version characterized as cast-detail.
Hanson (1955:7) describes the earliest example of a serpent side plate
closely comparable in form to the "standard" version. This side plate, like those
from Vinson, is of flat brass with engraved detail. It is mounted on a early
eighteenth century British light service musket by Walker. W. Keith Neal (cited
in Hanson 1955:39) also states that the design of the serpent side plate later found
on the English trade guns was based upon the side plate of the Queen Anne light
musket. Hanson’s example appears to be just such a weapon; it represents a
direct precursor of the eventually characteristic nineteenth century English trade
gun side plate. The light service muskets or fusils sent to America were obviously more suitable for eventual Indian use than the regulation full-size musket.
Gooding (1960) illustrates a serpent side plate from a pistol by T. Green and
relates that Green made up pattern guns for the Hudson Bay Company in 1715.
As Gooding (1960:87 and Figure 23d) points out, there is a striking similarity
between Green’s side plate and those that later became standard for the Northwest trade gun. Shiner (n.d.) describes engraved-detail flat serpent plates excavated at British Fort Frederica on St. Simons Island, Georgia. These side plates
were found in a 1738-1743 smithy that was sealed over by the 1760s (Manucy
1959:49-51). Hamilton (1960:135-136) illustrates and describes engraved-detail
flat serpent plates from Osage sites in Missouri and assigns them a tentative date
of 1750. Blaine and Harris (1967:70-71 and Figure 38a) note a similar serpent
plate from the ca. 1750 Gilbert Site in Texas and another has been described by

Blaine m Vinson Site Firearms

175

Blaine (1967:172 and Figure 55g) from the Longest site in Oklahoma. Side plate
fragments of this type also have been found at the 1750 Aranama Mission in
Goliad County, Texas. Thus, the spatial distribution of engraved-detail serpent
plates is wide, and temporally they are usually found in sites initially occupied by
at least the third quarter of the eighteenth century.
Therefore, the use of such side plates dates from about 1700 and, as the
following data appear to suggest, they terminate rather abruptly with the appearance of the cast-detail versions. Where Shiner (n.d.) encountered in a ca. 1740
feature some seven engraved-detail flat serpent or similar zoomorphic side plates
at Fort Frederica he found no cast-detail plates. In sharp contrast, however, at
Fort Michilimackinac, Maxwell and Binford (1961:103 and Figure 16a-c), did
not recover from a ca. 1760-1780 English context flat engraved-detail serpent
plates but rather found three fragments of cast-detail plates.
The English occupation of this post dates from 1761 to 1781 (Maxwell and
Binford 1961:13-16). These cast-detail side plates were found in features dated
1734, 1770, and 1772 (Maxwell and Binford 1961:103). The 1734 specimen
could either represent the earliest known cast-detail example of this particular
side plate type, or more likely, be either intrusive or from a similar specimen
from a higher grade, not trade, weapon. There is no present evidence available to
support the use of cast-detail side plates on early eighteenth century trade guns.
Hanson (1955:2, 15-16) describes the earliest known example of the standard cast-detail serpent plate on a complete and datable weapon. This is a trade
gun by a Birmingham maker named Grice, whose work dates from 1770 to 1780.
The only major differences between this side plate and the typical nineteenth
century versions (and apparently the 1770-1772 Michilimackinac specimens)
seems to be in the normally more slender outline and thinness of the earlier side
plates (Hanson 1955:16-18).
In summary, the flat engraved-detail serpent side plate apparently did not
continue to be used on English trade guns after the appearance of the cast-detail
plate. These latter side plates were in use by ca. 1770. Based upon available
information, Blaine (1967:172) proposed that flat engraved-detail serpent side
plates were no longer produced by ca. 1775.
The flat engraved-detail side plates from the Vinson Site probably were
used on the same type of weapon described for the butt plate from House 1; that
is, an English utility light musket orfusil. These weapons date from about 1700
to 1780.
Most of the eighteenth century archival sources note that the guns among
the Indians of Texas are thought to have been from French sources or traders. For
instance, a good supply of French guns and ammunition was noted among the
Tawakoni as late as 1772 (Bolton 1914, Volume I:101). Bolton (1914, Volume
1:74, 77) also notes that by 1772 English firearms had already appeared among
the Taovayas on the upper Red River.
The earliest appearance of English guns among Native Americans in significant numbers in Texas was ca. 1770. In 1772, Captain Luis Cazorla "notes

176

Texas Archeological Society

with surprise" numerous guns with an English trademark "stamped upon the
barrel." Captain Cazorla found these English guns and other European trade
good materials among the Karankawas, Cocos, Bidais, and Xaranames along the
Brazos River a short distance below present Richmond (Castafieda 1939:286).
Cazorla’s investigation of the source of this trade next took him to a village on
the Trinity River above Orcoquisac (near present Liberty). The tribes at this
rancheria--Orcoquisacs, Cocos, Bidais, and Attacapas--were also armed with
English guns. Here Cazorla learned that the English guns had been obtained from
the French trader Dutrive and his brother, who had a trading post one and onehalf days away in Louisiana. These French traders had obtained the guns from
English sources (Castafieda 1939:287).
Possible Side plate No. 5 is the second specimen from House 3 (see Figure
3h). It is made of brass, possibly sheet brass. Decorative detail on the piece was
produced by engraving the side plate’s flat surface. The narrow end of the side
plate had been broken, while the wide end was smoothed across the edge.
Measurements: Thickness, 1.35 mm to 1.47 mm.
Remarks: Side plate No. 5 may be an unknown side plate type based on its
asymmetrical outline, thickness, and decoration.
Side plates No. 6 and No. 7 are distal ends of flat engraved detail serpent
side plates from House 5. Both show the same production characteristics as side
plates Nos. 2-4 described above. Sideplate No. 6 (see Figure lb) has a side screw
hole in the front tab with a screw head scoring mark, while Side plate No. 7 (see
Figure la) has no screw hole and the engraved serpent tongue extends into the
center of the area normally pierced by a front screw hole. Both side plates were
broken across the neck immediately behind the head of the pieces. The plates
were hammered on their interior surfaces to stretch and/or flatten the brass for
final production.
Measurements: No. 6, thickness, 1 mm to 1.4 mm; No. 7, thickness 1 mm to
1.5 mm; No. 6, scoring mark diameter, 13.1 mm.
Remarks: These sections, Side plates Nos. 2-4, and butt plate No. 1 are from
the same type of firearm. The enigmatic lack of a screw hole on Side plate No. 7
is an attribute the author has not previously noted on serpent plates. Hamilton
(1980:Figure 37) illustrates an evolutionary series of serpent side plates, with one
in the series (Hamilton 1980:Figure 37e) very similar to Side plate No. 6 from
the Vinson site.
Ramrod Guide
No. of Specimens: 2
Provenience: surface (1), House 5 (1)
The two specimens are from the same ramrod guide. They are of sheet
brass, and tubular in shape (see Figure 2f, g). This was an intermediate or upper
guide. The flanges have been pierced for two transverse pins to hold it in the
stock. The guide is split lengthwise, while portions of a decorative annular ring

Blaine ~ Vinson Site Firearms

177

parallel each end of the piece. The two annular rings were formed by repousse
while the blank was open.
Measurements: Length, 38.9 mm; thickness at flange, 0.7 mm; thickness at
break, 0.4 mm.
Remarks: The ramrod guides do not closely resemble any the author has
examined from Spanish Fort, Gilbert, or other Texas and Louisiana Historic
Indian sites. It seems unlikely, then, that they are from ordinary or "regular"
French or English tradefusils since both commonly utilized a single pin. Some
French military models did use two pins on ramrod guides before 1750, but the
general appearance of those military rampipes is not similar to this Vinson
specimen (Boudriot 1963:Modeles 1717-1734). Hamilton (1980:Figure 33e, f)
does illustrate one set of French rampipes with two pinning holes, but these are
substantially heavier and more contoured or bellied in profile than the rampipes
from House 5.
Screw
No. of Specimens: 2
Provenience: House 2 (1), House 5 (1)
Both screws are of iron. One is a wood screw and the other is probably a
gun screw (bolt).
The head of the House 2 screw is slightly convex on the exterior surface and
it was beveled underneath it to fit a countersunk hole.
Measurement: Length, 35.8 mm; approximate screw head diameter, 11.4
mm.
Remark: This wood screw probably was used to fasten a butt plate to a gun
stock. This is based on the curvature and size of the head, plus the condition of
the screw itself.
The probable gun screw (bolt) was found in House 5. It is broken in the
shaft and the assumed threaded end is missing. The head is small and underneath
it is flat. It was likely used as a breech tang screw that engaged the tang from
below; this is typical for the earlier English gun.
Measurements: Head diameter, 9.3 mm.
Additional wood screws were found in Feature 31 and House 5, but they
appear to be modem intrusives. These are uniform in size, flat on the head face,
and have uniformly centered and formed screwdriver slots.
Gun Barrel
No. of Specimens: 10
Provenience: surface (2), House 2 (1), House 3 (1), Feature 25 (2), House 4 (1),
Feature 31 (1), and House 5 (2)
The usual gun barrel shape in the French trade is heavier and "octagonal" in
the short breech (proximal end), then tapering smoothly into the lighter and
round forward (distal) part. The breech style, often described as "octagonal,"
usually has only five truly flat upper surfaces (see Figure lf).

178

Texas Archeological Society

Part No. 1 is a round barrel section of extremely oxidized iron that was split
lengthwise. One end is broken or roughly cut while the other, with straight and
smooth edges, may be the muzzle end.
Measurements: Total length, 57.15 mm; estimated bore, 14 mm to 16 mm
(between .56 and .60 cal.).
No. 2 is an iron barrel lug, also called a pin or wire loop, used with a transverse pin to help secure a barrel in the gun stock (see Figure 2h). These pieces
were made separately from the barrel, then secured to the lower barrel surface.
Measurements: Length, 12.3 mm; width, 9.5 mm; height, 6.8 ram.
Remarks: Barrel part No. 1 may be from a .58 cal. smooth bore barrel that is
common to eighteenth century French and English trade guns. The barrel lug or
pin loop is also common on these types of guns.
Part No. 3, from House 2, is a tapered "octagonal" breech section that has
been broken across both ends, so the normal area of maximum diameter is
missing.
Measurement: Maximum diameter remaining is approximately 25.4 mm;
estimated bore, 14.5 to 15.5 mm (.58 to .62 cal.).
Remarks: If the breech was originally over 25.4 mm in diameter, a mideighteenth century French trade gun would be indicated. Given the breakage, it
could also be either an eighteenth century English trade gun, or a nineteenth
century trade gun (Hamilton 1960:126).
Part No. 4, from House 3, is a possible round fragment of a gun barrel. It is
iron, of open ring form, with one rounded ring end and the other broken and
oxidized. The "ring" form is widest opposite the ends of the piece.
Part No. 5, from Feature 25, is an iron breech plug. The tang has been
broken off and flattened by hammering on (or with) the broken end of the breech
plug.
Measurements: Maximum width (as measured across the breech end), 28.6
mm.

Remarks: This breech plug may be from an eighteenth century trade gun, or
conversely from an eighteenth or nineteenth century military gun. The plug’s
screw portion is too badly oxidized for a bore estimate.
Part No. 6, also from Feature 25, appears to be a flattened gun barrel section
from the round part of the barrel.
Part No. 7, from House 4, is a part of "octagonal" breech section with the
breech plug broken off in the bore. The plug end is heavily battered while the
opposite end was broken and collapsed inward toward the bore of the piece.
Measurements: Maximum diameter, 27.9 mm.
Remarks: Barrel part No. 7 is from either an eighteenth century trade or
military gun or an nineteenth century military weapon.
Part No. 8, from Feature 31, is another iron breech plug. It has been broken
across the tang and the breech bore plug base.
Measurement: Maximum width (across the breech end), 28.6 ram.

Blaine u Vinson Site Firearms

179

Remarks: The tang screw direction cannot be determined on this fragmentary
barrel, nor can the bore be estimated. Its length across the plug body where it
contacts the back of the breech again indicates only an eighteenth century trade
gun or an eighteenth or nineteenth century military gun.
Parts No. 9 and No. 10 are from House 5. Part No. 9 is an "octagonal"
section of breech, broken at both ends, with the larger end pounded inward
around its entire circumference. The area of maximum diameter is missing on
the piece.
Measurement: Estimated maximum diameter across the flats, 25.4 mm;
bore estimate, 15 mm to 16 mm (approximately .59 to .62 cal.)
Part No. 10 is a flattened section of round barrel that was subsequently
"mushroomed" by impacts at one end.
Measurement: Length, 52.5 mm; maximum width, 35.5 mm.
Remarks: Native Americans commonly recycled the thinner round barrel
sections by pounding them flat and breaking them into segments by bending.
When these flat segments did not split laterally they sometimes were sharpened
at one end and hammered from the other, then used as chisels. When they did
split, the result was two rectangular pieces of flat iron of relatively uniform
thickness; these provided excellent stock for metal scrapers and other tools.
Lead Shot and Ball and Folded Lead
No. of Specimens: 12
Provenience: surface (4 shot), House 2 (1 ball), House 3 (1 shot, 1 folded lead),
Feature 25 (1 shot), Feature 26 (1 folded lead), and House 5 (3 shot)
Note: All shot "sizes" are based on a table for dropped shot by E. Baker
(George 1947:211).
The first four shot are from the surface. No. 1 weighs 12.2 grains (BB shot);
No. 2, 3.8 grains (#2 shot); No. 3, 2.3 grains (#5 shot); and No. 4, 2.1 grains (#5
shot).
Remarks: Only No. 1, unfired, appears old, but this assessment is based
primarily on the thick patina that obscures how it was formed. Shot Nos. 2-4
appear to be chilled, modern specimens; these three pieces of shot have been
fired.
No. 5 is a hemispherical-shaped lead "ball."
Measurements: Weight, 210.5 grains.
Remarks: This possible bullet from House 2 appears to have been fired. Its
weight indicates a ball of approximately .53 cal. if the ball is intact.
No. 6, from House 3, is a lead shot.
Measurements: Weight, 2.3 grains (Shot size is #5).
Remarks: Shot No. 6 was fired. It appears to be modern, chilled shot like
three of the shot specimens from the surface.
No. 7, from House 3, is a folded piece of lead.

180

Texas Archeological Society

Measurements: The folded piece of lead is a single sheet 2 mm in thickness.
It is approximately 16.5 mm x 18 mm in size.
Remarks: This folded lead piece was probably cut from a larger piece of
sheet lead since its thickness is relatively uniform. Folded lead pads were used
primarily by the military to help secure a gunflint in a gun cock vise. One native
gunflint from the Gilbert Site was held in a lead pad (Blaine and Harris 1967:84).
No. 8, from Feature 25, is a fired and much flattened shot.
Measurements: Weight, 72.0 grains.
Remarks: By weight this shot is small buck, if the shot is intact.
No. 9 (Feature 26) is about half of a plain lead disc that was broken through
a fold.
Measurements: Thickness, 2 mm; length, 33 mm; width, 13 mm.
Remarks: This piece may have been formed from sheet lead.
Nos. 10-12: The last three specimens are shot from House 5. No. 10 weighs
4.5 grains (#2 shot); No. 11 weighs 3.25 grains (#3 shot); and No. 12 weighs 1.25
grains (#8 shot).
Remarks: The shot sample was examined to isolate early forms of dropped
shot, such as "Rupert" shot (Baird 1973). While the shot needs additional cleaning, those that do not appear relatively modern are probably of the post-1769
variety of dropped shot (see Blaine [1973:153] for a general discussion on
problems and procedures in analysis of archeological shot; note, however, that
Baird’s data [1973:83-85] on the "Rupert" form of early dropped shot was not
available for that discussion).
Gunflints
The spaU gunflint is the major form exported to North America between ca.
1700 to 1750, but it was obsolete by 1770. The French blade gunflint then
became dominant by 1775 in Colonial military sites (Witthoft 1966:25, 28).
Apparently the vast majority of both gunflint forms were exported through
French commercial activities. The French blade gunflint then remained dominant
until ca. 1840 in the eastern United States, outnumbering by a 3:1 ratio the
"British" blade gunflint (Witthoft 1966:32). Witthoft (1966:36) also suggests the
earliest "British" blade gunflints date from the period of the American Revolution. Principal lithic sources for the exported spall type come from the low
countries of northern Europe, but from French and English sources for the blade
type (Witthoft 1966:25-40).
Vinson Site spall gunflints with reasonably intact ventral surfaces were all
produced as individual flakes from prepared cores. In color they are primarily
mottled grays with a tan or brown cast. However, three other specimens are dark
to very dark gray, and very similar in color to the "Black" English gunflints of
the nineteenth century (Figure 4).
Four of the blade gunflints (produced by segmenting prismatic blades into
individual gunflints) are of the typical waxy blond appearance characteristic of

conventional French gunflints. One additional broken blade gunflint has a darker
brownish-gray color and was made by a different technology. It was square
heeled, not rounded like the blond chert specimens, and the remnant of a lateral
demi-cone is present; both attributes are characteristic of English blade segmenting techniques. Since this is almost certainly an English gunflint and, if not
intrusive, it is indicative of a post ca. 1776 occupation (see Witthoft 1966:36).
The 27 possible native gunflints (Table 2) are made of opaque cherts. As a
group, they generally are not as skillfully knapped as the native gunflints from
the Womack and Gilbert sites.
Because of breakage, extensive use-damage and/or reworking, only dimensions of two spall gunflints, one blade gunflint, and 10 native gunflints were

Blaine ~ Vinson Site Firearms

183

usefully measureable. As used here, length refers to the measurement between
the designated thinner striking edge and the opposite thicker edge (no European
double working edge gunflints were found at Vinson). Width is the measurement
across the striking (working) edge of the gunflint.
Native-made gunflints commonly have thin striking edges on all four sides,
as they are usually carefully bifaced, and the dimensions given here are simply
oriented to the most suitable striking edge. Possible native gunflints were identified on the basis of their shape and size. However, none of the "possible" native
gunflints have straight-edge battering that is consistent with repeated impact
against a frizzen nor are they carefully bifaced; rather, they had only one edge
suitable for gunflint use.
As noted above, two spall gunflints are reasonably intact. They are 30.6
mm and 21.3 mm in length; widths are 21.1 mm and 30.5 mm, respectively.
One intact blade gunflint is 23.9 mm long and 22.1 mm in width. Ten native
gunflints range from 16.3 to 30.2 mm in length (20.6 mm median length) and
were 14.7 to 27.9 mm in width (median width of 21.3 mm). The largest specimen in this group, measuring 30.2 mm long and 27.9 mm wide, is suitable for
a military musket.
Blaine (1973:152) cautions against using spall and blade gunflint ratios
derived from Colonial military sites in the Eastern U.S. to isolate eighteenth
century Historic Indian sites in Texas. He suggests that the Texas archeological
data may indicate that the spall gunflint was used later here. Hamilton and Fry
(1975:119-121) also make the case that all imported spall gunflints are not
"Dutch" in origin and these gunflints must also be examined for additional
technological attributes for determinations of manufacturer origins.
According to de Lotbiniere (1980:154-159) spall gunflint production in
Britain can be documented through the eighteenth century with some exported to
North America as early as 1700 "as a present for ye Indians." From the foregoing, it is probable that "Dutch," French, and English primary sources are represented among the Vinson Site spaU gunflints, with only a minor (possibly three
flints) English spall representation in the sample. The English blade gunflint
from House 1 remains a key find since this type of gunflint was not made before
ca. 1776 at the earliest.
SUMMARY

The Englishfusils discussed above were being produced before ca. 1740
and it is very unlikely they were still in production by ca. 1775. There is only a
minor indication at Vinson that the ca. 1720 through ca. 1750fusils commonly
utilized in the French trade were present in the Vinson gun parts sample.
The gun parts are from a minimum of five firearms. When such firearms
are recovered in a village context, such as at Vinson, it is common for them to
be found disassembled and certain parts obviously recycled. The absence of some
gun components is to be expected. However, at this site certain gunlock parts

such as sears, tumblers, and the short lock screws are notably absent; this lack
of representation has not been previously documented in other Texas sites with
an adequate gun parts sample. The missing parts never seem to occur in an altered or recycled condition, and thus at Vinson these parts were inexplicably
not simply discarded with the other metal gun parts.
European gunflint sample ratios indicate that the spaU form is dominant on
Texas Indian sites that date as late as ca. 1775 when the combined type sample
numbers 20 or more specimens. A single English blade gunflint dates after ca.
1775, probably via a flintlock user in the general site area prior to ca. 1860.
When compared to a ca. 1750-era site such as Gilbert that was marked by
having numerous and varied French trade affiliated goods, the Vinson Site presents a strong contrast. In terms of what materials entered the archeological
record, the folk at Vinson did not often have or use up such tools as hatchets,
axes, hoes, or other common types of metal tools (see Smith, this volume). Their
access to French trade firearms, knives, and brass kettles appears very limited
in kind as well as quantity when compared to Gilbert.
For the above reasons, it is likely then that the Vinson Site occupation
occurred after the 1760s. Also, the inhabitants may have been unable to supply
the deer hides, bear oil, and other products that brought in abundant trade goods;
tribute or treaty goods also appear to have been negligible. Finally, the examined gun parts indicate that the occupation did not extend past ca. 1790.
