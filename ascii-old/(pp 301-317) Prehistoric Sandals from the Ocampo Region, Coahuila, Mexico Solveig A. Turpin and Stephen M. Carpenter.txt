Prehistoric Sandals from the Ocampo Region,
Coahuila, Mexico
Solveig A. Turpin and Stephen M. Carpenter

ABSTRACT
Fifty-seven sandals unsystematically collected from dry rock shelters in the
Ocampo region of Coahuila provide evidence of variability in the northern
Mexican fiber industry approximately 1000 years ago. The assemblage is dominated by 27 braided sandals, a type defined at Frightful Cave, some 60 km to the
southeast near Cuatro Ci6nagas, where only six specimens were recovered. One
braided sandal fragment from the E1 Fuste collection produced a stable carbon
isotope corrected radiocarbon date of 1110_+ 60 B.P. (TX-7814) which calibrates to the range from A.D. 870 to 990. Braided sandals reflect a break in the
chronological and spatial continuum usually attributed to the cultural complexes
of northern Mexico and southwestern Texas.

INTRODUCTION
An assortment of fiber artifacts unsystematically collected from dry rock
shelters in the Ocampo region of Coahuila, Mexico, was analyzed to determine
their scientific value and their relationship to similar assemblages from the
Cuatro Ci6nagas Basin, 60 km to the southeast, and the Lower Pecos region of
Texas, 280 km to the northeast (Figure 1). The 57 complete and partial sandals
that make up the bulk of the collection proved to be the most informative and are
the focus of this report. Descriptions and photographs of these specimens, the
few items of basketry, miscellaneous cordage, and other artifacts will be filed at
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, The University of Texas at Austin, and with the Instituto Nacional de Antropologfa y Historia in Mexico.

NATURAL SETTING
This collection can be generally attributed to three dry rock shelters on the
western flank of the Sierra el Fuste, a small mountain range that fol!ows the same
northwest-southeast trend as its northeasterly neighbors, Sierra de la Encantada,
Sierra de la Carmen, and Serranfas del Burro (Smith 1970; Abbott 1905). The
majority of the sandals came from one shelter, Red Arrow Cave, that faces south
from the palisaded wall of a tributary canyon that enters the Potrero Cuervo

the southeastern boundary of the Llano el Macho.
On a larger scale, the Sierra el Fuste is one of the small mountain ranges
included in the Bolson de Mapimf, best known as the arid sanctuary from which
hostile native people retaliated against Spanish expansion into the desert north.
The area is also on the northern periphery of the Laguna District, so named for
the numerous playa lakes that cover large portions of the valley floors. Visible
from the passes that lead to the Potrero Cuervo Chico is the broad barren expanse
of the Laguna la Leche, a dry lake bed that supports an abundance of salinetolerant plants when it intermittently fills with runoff. The shelter dwellers,
however, would have been supplied potable water by springs that seep from the
mountainsides or casual water retained in natural cavities in the limestone bedrock. One deep tinaja was reported in the bottom of the canyon, below the E1
Fuste caves, and another, in an adjacent canyon, had apparently collapsed in
relatively recent times.

Another possible source of the mesic vegetation seen in the collection is
suggested by a large reservoir that was created by damming a small gap in the
foothills that is the only outlet of Potrero Cuervo Chico. Runoff from the encircling mountain slopes may have been impounded there naturally in prehistoric
times as well, supporting the sedges and reeds used by prehistoric people in the
E1 Fuste caves.
The area is classified as Chihuahuan desert scrub with semidesert grasslands flourishing at higher elevations (Brown and Lowe 1980; Smith 1970:Figure 20). The modern vegetation is dominated by creosote bush and cacti on the
plains and in the basins (Bryant and Riskind 1980), giving way to grasslands
with scattered agave, yucca, and cacti on the slopes. In the Potrero Cuervo Chico,
the desert scrub grades into the piedmont scrub of the Sierra Madre Oriental
vegetational community (Bryant and Riskind 1980) above the elevation of the
rock shelters, ca. 1550 meters amsl. The most important attribute of the Chihuahua Desert, in terms of human occupancy, is the wide variety of plant communities in proximity (Bryant and Riskind 1980:11-12).
The shelters all appear to be relatively small and shallow. Burned limestone
and ashy ill! reflect a long history of site use but stone tools and debitage are not
abundant. All of the lithic material was collected from the surface of one site. A
splintered fragment of highly polished wood that bears battering and scrape
marks on its burnished point, reflecting its hard use as a digging stick, and a
smoothed deer bone weaving tool complete the inventory of non-fiber artifacts.

Also among the collected items is a bundle of dry sedges, probably bull rushes,
that grow only in marshy habitats, such as the nearby Laguna la Leche during its
intermittent ponding. Reportedly, one unoccupied cave that may have served
only mortuary purposes also held large quantities of tules, or generic reedy
plants, and a dehydrated peyote bud was observed in Red Arrow Cave but not
kept.
The overall impression of the El Fuste caves is of sheltered sites occupied
sporadically for short periods when it would not be too uncomfortable to have
interior fires in small spaces. A number of geometric and abstract pictographs
painted on the walls and ceilings of the various shelters, however, point to more
than a simple expediency of occupation. Polychrome zigzag lines, herringbones
and diamonds, an intricate multi-colored maze design, anumber of monochromatic "tally marks," and a solid, red contracting stem barbed dart or arrow point,
are the most discernible designs. The bulk of the E1 Fuste collection can be
attributed to Red Arrow Cave where the maze pictograph so intrigued treasure
hunters that they dug a huge hole directly beneath it, exposing a number of
artifacts. Random linear cut marks have been incised into the dense smooth
indurated skin of the limestone in at least one of the sites. All of these designs
would fit well within the desert geometric tradition of the north central Mexican
states (Heartfield 1976) and the Lower Pecos region of Texas (Turpin 1986).

CULTURAL CONTEXT
Although no formal archeological work has been carried out in the
immediate area of the Sierra el Fuste, in the 1940s Walter W. Taylor (1988)
excavated or collected specimens from Frightful, Fat Burro, and 14 other caves
near Cuatro Cifinagas, 60 km to the southeast. In large part, these data formed the
basis for his cultural chronology, settlement pattern model, and artifact typologies
(Taylor 1964, 1966). Although only a few of his findings have been published,
fortunately for this study Taylor (1988) reported the sandal component of the
fiber industry in great detail.
Subsequently, considerable research in the Laguna Mayran district, southwest of the Sierra el Fuste, concentrated on open sites (where perishable artifacts
could not survive), mortuary caves, and rock art (Heartfield 1976). The analyses
of the textile industry from the most famous cave in Coahuila, Candelaria,
unfortunately did not include a description of the more mundane specimens such
as sandals (Weitlander-Johnson 1977). In his popular descriptions of Coahuilan
prehistory, Cardenas (1978:n.p., 1990:26) illustrates sandals which he collected
or observed in the Ocampo region, but details of their construction are difficult to
reconstruct from the figure reproductions.
The topographic constraints exercised by the many small mountain ranges
of the Bolson de Mapimf suggest that cultural similarities would follow the
northwest-southeast trend of the valleys, leading to the Big Bend region of

Turpin and CarlTenter ~ Prehistoric Sandals from the Ocampo Region

305

Texas. However, the few early descriptions of sandals from dry rock shelters in
that region lack the detail necessary for meaningful comparisons (Smith 1933).
Some 280 km north of Ocampo, the dry caves of the Lower Pecos River
region provide a comparative collection of basketry, matting, cordage, and other
perishables (Andrews and Adovasio 1980; McGregor 1992). This includes a
large number of sandals that have been analyzed in detail (Collins 1969; King
n.d.; Maslowski 1978; Schuetz 1956, 1963; Thomas 1933; Williams-Dean n.d.).
Based on his extensive experience with the fiber industry in northern Mexico,
especially Frightful Cave, and the Lower Pecos region, as represented by Hinds
Cave, Adovasio (1980:97-98; Andrews and Adovasio 1980:368) proposed that a
broad tradition, evidenced by shared technology, environment, and economy,
persisted from about 7500 B.C. until European contact in the sixteenth century.
The sandals from the Sierra el Fuste, however, illustrate one deviation from this
remarkably uniform prehistoric technological trajectory.

THE SANDALS OF SIERRA EL FUSTE
This collection includes 49 complete and 8 fragmentary sandals that were
divided into groups, following where possible typological categories established
by Taylor (1988) and Schuetz (1956). The types added to Schuetz’ classificatory
system by King (n.d.), based on her analysis of the Hinds Cave materials, are not
represented in the E1 Fuste collection. The general characteristics of 56 specimens, omitting one fragment that was destroyed during radiocarbon assay, are
tabulated for ease of reference (Table 1).

Group 1 (Figure 3a) includes two specimens that correspond to Taylor’s
(1988:44) Flai, a subtype of his more general category of plaited sandals:

. . . plaited, two warp [sandals]. The warp frame is made of two elements laid parallel to form the lateral margins and to support the wefts;
each warp element is turned inward to the opposite side at the toe-end
and is turned around the warps ("plaited") in figure eights back toward
the heel, forming the wefts; ties and padding are added to complete the
construction.
Plaited sandals dominate Taylor’s assemblage through time; 596 examples
of subtype Flai were recovered from four sites with the majority, 570, coming
from Frightful Cave. Plaiting is considered one of the characteristics of the Big
Bend sandal industry (Smith 1933)¯
The two specimens in Group 2 (see Figure 3b) do not con’espond to any of
Taylor’s types but they do conform to Scheutz’ Type C (Williams-Dean n.d.:l 1):

¯ . . construction has a double frame in which lecheguilla strands are
loosely woven back and forth. When completed, the sandal is simply
folded in half at the toe. The two halves are held together by tie-strings
(Schuetz 1956: ! 30).
Adovasio discusses one poorly provenienced specimen of this type from
Moorehead Cave in the heart of the Lower Pecos region (Maslowski 1978: 247).

lower levels of Hinds Cave, suggesting to her that they are a very early style
unique to the Lower Pecos region.
Group 3 (Figure 4), the largest and most informative in the E1 Fuste sample
(n=27), was the rarest of Taylor’s types. He recovered only six braided sandals,
five from Frightful Cave and one from Fat Burro Cave. He describes them as
"footgear made of two bundles of fiber doubled over each other and braided from
toe to heel, where they are turned over and woven back up the sandal to form the
padding" (Taylor 1988: 103). From the standpoint of manufacturing technique,
Taylor considered these distinctive sandals to be unique and unrelated to the
plaiting process by which the majority of the Coahuila foot gear was made.
Braided sandals have no warp frames or pads; rather, they rely upon a single set
of fiber elements and a single step of manufacture. None of his specimens

retained toe strings, but he felt that they too would be unlike any of the ties he
had observed on the plaited sandals.
Group 4 consists of three complete sandals and one heel fragment. It seems
to be an elaborate form of the braided type (Group 3) which has been folded in
half and stitched together.

310

Sixteen sandals were assigned to Group 5 (see Figure 3c), which equates to

Coahuila type Flc (Taylor 1988:96), checker-pad sandals or "footgear made by
sewing reinforcing and padding elements through the sides and across the ground
side of a checker-plaited fabric" (Taylor 1988:96). Although Taylor (1988)
recovered only seven checker-pad sandals from Cuatro Ci~nagas, all from Frightful Cave, he considered this technique to be culturally related to twill padding but
later in time.
Group 6 is miscellaneous untyped specimens. This group includes four
untyped square-toed sandals whose warp, if present, is undetectable (see Figure
3d), and one fragment that is too deteriorated to classify.

DISCUSSION OF SANDAL TYPES
Comparing the 57 sandals from the Sierra el Fuste to Taylor’s collection
of over 1000 from the Cuatro Ci~nagas Basin identifies both variability and
complementarity in areas such as chronology, technology, raw materials, and
the distribution of types. Group 1, with only two specimens or 3.5 percent of
the E1 Fuste collection, contrasts dramatically with the 884 examples that
constitute 92.2 percent of the Frightful Cave inventory. Group 2 also consists
of only two specimens of a type not found in Taylor’s assemblage, but is
represented in the Lower Pecos region by Schuetz’ Type C. The 17 checkerpad sandals of Group 5 comprise 29.8 percent of the E1 Fuste collection as
opposed to less than 1 percent at Frightful Cave. The most dramatic difference,
however, is in the relative percentage of braided sandals, Group 3 and possibly
Group 4. Taylor (1988) recovered only six braided sandals, again less than 1
percent of his total inventory, contrasted with 31, or 54.4 percent of the E1 Fuste
sandals. This much larger sample contributes to a better description of this type
and permits some speculation on the variable distribution of the different styles.

Chronology
The five braided sandals in Frightful Cave were attributed to the Top Level,
which postdates 1900 B.C. or 3850 years ago (Taylor 1988:Table 4-2). A braided
sandal fragment from the Sierra el Fuste assemblage has a stable carbon isotope
corrected age of 1110 + 60 B.P. (TX-7814; C~3 ratio of-11.0). Calibrated, there is
a 97 percent probability that this date falls between A.D. 870 and 990 or the
range from 960 to 1080 years ago (Stuiver and Reimer 1987). Twelve two-warp
sandals from Frightful Cave and others from Fat Burro and Nopal caves were
radiocarbon-dated to the range from approximately 1400 to 6200 years ago
(Taylor 1988:Appendix B), so the differences in the two collections may be
partially attributable to the disparate ages of these two styles. A basket fragment
from another E1 Fuste cave, not associated with sandals of any type, produced a

Turpin and Carpenter ~ Prehistoric Sandals from the Ocampo Region

311

stable carbon isotope corrected radiocarbon date of 1340 + 80 B.P. (TX-7804;
C~3 ratio of-11.2) which calibrates to the range from 1177 to 1312 years ago
(Stuiver and Reimer 1987), adding another two centuries to the span of occupation at E1 Fuste.

Technology
In the stratigraphic sample from Frightful Cave, which spans several millennia of sandal construction, the braiding technique represents a distinct rupture
in what might be perceived as a stylistic evolutionary continuum. Nearly all the
sandal types in Cuatro Ci6nagas and the Lower Pecos region use some variation
of warp and weft construction in which the warp is a passive or stationary
element around which the weft, or active element, moves. In the braided sandal
type, all the elements are active; there are no warps. The fibers are first braided to
create the top of the sandal, then folded over and interbraided from toe to heel to
form the sole (see Figure 4). The tightness of the fabric indicated to Taylor the
use of an awl, such as the one recovered from the caves in the Sierra el Fuste
(Figure 5), in backweaving the padding. These sandals are well-made, of innova-

tive design, and show none of the cultural devolution sometimes attributed to the
later phases of the Coahuilan Archaic period.
The braided sandals from Frightful and Fat Burro caves are missing their
toe strings, a loss Taylor attributed to rodent gnawing. The few remaining parts
indicated to him, however, that the style of toe strings was unlike any of the
complete specimens in the Cuatro Ci6nagas collection. Twenty-one of the braided
sandals from E1 Fuste have intact or partial ties.

312

Texas Archeological Society

The sandal ties are generally made from two strips of techuguilla that converge at the toe but, unlike most of the other sandal types, do not cross (Figure
6). They are drawn through the sole and tied off or, in some instances, brought
back up through the padding to be knotted together on top. From the toe, each
strip runs to the middle of the sandal where it loops around the side elements of
the pad, from inside to outside, and continues back to form the heel loop. The
two elements are interlooped at the heel, like the links of a chain, and brought
back to tie onto the toe strap near its midpoint. The heel strap is attached by a
loose granny knot that slides along the toe strap, making it adjustable. In a few
of the more complete specimens, the dextral (right element) passes across the
arch in front of the ankle, connecting to the sinistral (left element). Considerable ingenuity went into the design of this tie style.

adjustable tie string style tbund on braided sandals.

Raw Material Selectivity

The Frightful Cave sandal makers displayed an obvious preference for
Hesperaloefunifera, or zamandoque, the raw material used in 93 percent of the
plaited sandals. The few made of Agave lechuguilla were more prevalent in the
Bottom Level, leading Taylor (!988:67) to suggest that selectivity changed over

Turpin and Carpenter m Prehistoric Sandals from the Ocampo Region

313

time. Five of his braided sandals are of zamandoque; the one example from Fat
Burro Cave is yucca.
Lechuguilla was the mainstay of the E1 Fuste sandaleras who used it almost
exclusively. Williams Dean (n.d: 33) noted that the Lower Pecos people were
among the few who used lechuguilla rather than yucca in their sandal industry
and suggested that the contrast may be an example of cultural bias. The Hinds
Cave sandals were constructed primarily of lechuguilla, with some use of yucca,
sotol, and beargrass (King n.d.:10). The Chihuahua Desert has such a high
degree of topographic and edaphic diversity, however, that differences in construction materials may be a simple matter of expediency rather than purposeful
selectivity. Certainly, today the slopes of the Potrero Cuervo Chico abound in
lechuguilla in contrast to the more limited distribution of zamandoque.

IMPLICATIONS OF THE EL FUSTE COLLECTION
Only two sources provide a cultural context for the variability introduced
into prehistoric Coahuilan sandal assemblages by the collection from the Sierra
el Fuste. Fortunately, both Taylor (1966, ! 988) and Adovasio (1980; Andrews
and Adovasio 1980) emphasized the fiber industry, especially as present at
Frightful Cave, only 60 km southwest of the current study area.
Based on his long experience in Coahuila, Taylor defined four complexes
that differ from the usual cultural-historical sequences in that they encompass
three basic traditions or industries: wood, plant fiber, and stone (Taylor 1966:67).
The Coahuila Complex, which is roughly analogous to the Archaic stage in
North American parlance, endured from the beginning of human occupation until
well into the post-European contact period. In the last 1000 years of prehistory,
congeries of new traits define the Jora and Mayran complexes chronologically,
but they remain overlays on the main corpus which was the enduring traditions of
the Coahuila Complex.
The two radiocarbon dates derived from fiber artifacts, a braided sandal
1110 years old and a coiled basket 1340 years old, place the E1 Fuste collection
in Taylor’s (1966: Figure 30) Mayran or Jora complexes, temporally equivalent
to the Late Prehistoric period in the Texas chronology. Taylor (1966:Figure 17)
attributed braided sandals to the late Coahuila, Jora, or Mayran complexes since
he had no absolute dates from specimens of this type. The latter is primarily a
mortuary complex and may encompass the basketry in the E1 Fuste collection
that was associated with a child burial (Turpin et al. 1993). No item exclusively
mentioned on Taylor’s Jora Complex trait list securely attributes the E1 Fuste
collection to that tradition but the variability in sandal design and technology is
consistent with his impression of an overall increase in diversity. To Taylor, the
Jora Complex was signalled by a number of introduced traits, possibly of foreign origin.

314

Texas Archeological Society

Adovasio (1980; Andrews and Adovasio !980) treated the spatial parameters of the Coahuilan fiber industries, especially as manifested in basketry,
matting, and cordage. The similarities between the northern Mexican assemblage, largely from Frightful Cave, and the Lower Pecos samples, such as that
from Hinds Cave, were so close that Adovasio postulated that the latter must
have been directly derived from the former. This tradition was, in his opinion,
remarkably stable and ultra-conservative, reflecting the "essential immutability
of the socio-economic milieu" within which the artifacts were produced (Andrews
and Adovasio 1980:361).
Although the E1 Fuste collection of perishable artifacts is small when compared to the massive amount of material recovered from Frightful and Hinds
caves, the rarity of fiber assemblages from the Ocampo region, and Coahuila in
general, gives it a significance beyond that warranted by its size. The most
important observation is the distribution of sandal types within each of the inventories. The dominant type at E1 Fuste, the braided sandal, appears to be of
local design and manufacture. This particular style has not been identified in
any collections from the Lower or Trans-Pecos, the Greater Southwest, the Great
Basin, or adjacent areas of Mexico. Outside of the E1 Fuste collection, only six
specimens have been reported in other areas of Coahuila. Thus, the braided
sandals constitute one class of fiber artifacts not shared with the Lower Pecos
region of Texas and perhaps not with adjacent areas of northern Mexico.
Secondly, the braiding technique represents a break in a stylistic evolutionary continuum that was the driving force behind sandal production in Frightful
Cave for over five millennia. This variability is perfectly consistent with
Taylor’s recognition of a number of new traits that he called the Jora Complex.
The quality of construction and the innovative design, especially of the adjustable tie strings, is also consistent with what Taylor considered to be a reintegration of Coahuilan culture during the last millennium of prehistory. However,
the localized distribution as it is currently known mitigates against external influence as the impetus for the adoption of this style.
Inferences about the processes that fostered diversity in the last 1000 years
of northern Coahuilan prehistory become baseless speculation in the total absence of information about the context in which they operated. Taylor’s (1964,
! 966) settlement pattern model has not been tested or improved upon in the last
quarter of a century. No paleoenvironmental reconstructions have been attempted in this part of Coahuila. Prior to this study, all the radiocarbon assays
were obtained from the Cuatro Cidnagas collections where the development of
a lithic typology was frustrated by theft of the specimens. Ceramics are so poorly
represented that no serious effort has been devoted to their analysis. The information contained in the E1 Fuste collection underscores the need for a comprehensive program of archeological research in the Ocampo region.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

This collection was excavated without scientific controls and brought back
into the United States. The collection, despite its lack of exact provenience,
offers information not previously obtained fi’om this region of Mexico that
warrants dissemination. The publication of this analysis should not be construed
as condoning the illegal importation of artifacts from Mexico by the authors or
the Texas Archeological Society. The Instituto Nacional de Antropologfa e
Historia has been informed, and details of the analysis have been provided to the
Monterrey regional center for the use of Mexican researchers.
Kenneth M. Brown and Christine Ward generously contributed their experience in analyzing perishable artifacts from Lower and Trans-Pecos collections.
David Riskind, Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, provided information on
plant communities and their distribution in the Chihuahua Desert. Carole Medlar
photographed the artifacts for publication and for the archives, while David G.
Robinson drew the schematic illustrations of sandals and ties.
