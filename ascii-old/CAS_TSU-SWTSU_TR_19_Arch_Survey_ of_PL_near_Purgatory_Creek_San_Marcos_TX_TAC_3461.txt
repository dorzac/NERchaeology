Abstract
In July 2004, the City of San Marcos contracted with the Center for Archaeological Studies (CAS)
of Texas State University-San Marcos to conduct an archaeological site assessment via a pedestrian
survey along with limited shovel test and backhoe trench excavations of a 2,775-m-long pipeline right-of­
way. The minimum standards of 16 shovel tests per linear mile, and at least six shovel tests on
archaeological sites were either met or exceeded, except on site 41HY388, which is a historic rock wall
and limestone quarry. CAS conducted the fieldwork in August 2004, under Texas Antiquities Permit No.
3461, issued by the Texas Historical Commission-Department of Antiquities Protection (THC-DAP). A
total of eight chert flakes were collected from three shovel tests and a backhoe trench. Collected artifacts,
documents, and photographs related to this project are curated at CAS.
One new historic site (41HY388) and two new prehistoric sites (41HY386 and 41HY387) were
documented. 41HY388 consists of a rock wall and quarry. The City of San Marcos has agreed to avoid
the wall. Because of the condition of the quarry we recommend no adverse impact will occur if the pipeline
is constructed through it. 41HY386 is an ephemeral lithic scatter in secondary context. As such, we have
determined that no adverse impact will occur if the pipeline is constructed through it. 41HY387 is an
ephemeral lithic scatter and karst feature. The lithic scatter is not recommended as eligible for listing on
the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Prior excavation of the karst feature determined that
it lacked archaeological significance.

The 2,775-m wastewater pipeline right-of-way
that is the focus of this report is located on the
western edge of San Marcos, in Central Texas
(Figures 1 and 2). In July 2004, Project Coordinator,
Kathryn J. Woodlee, acting on behalf of the City of
San Marcos Department of Environment and En­
gineering, contracted with the Center for Archaeo­
logical Studies (CAS) of Texas State UniversitySan Marcos to conduct an archaeological site
assessment. This assessment consisted of a pedes­
trian survey and the placement of limited shovel

The authors of this report conducted the field­

Lithic resources in the form of Edwards For­
mation chert were occasionally observed in the
survey area. These resources suggest that raw
materials for making stone tools were available in
the immediate area. Five soil types are present in
the project area (Figure 5). Soils in the uplands are
Comfort-Rock Outcrop Complex, undulating (CrD).
Their thin surface layer is extremely stony, dark
brown clay, over dark reddish-brown clay loam.
Large cobbles and others stones may be found
throughout and originate from the underlying indu­
rated, fractured limestone (Batte 1984:69). Anhalt
Clay Soils (AnA) are also found in the uplands.
They form from residual material weathered from
limestone and are a typical shrink-swell vertisol.
They can be up to 28 in thick, but the bottom zone
will likely be indurated fractured limestone (Batte
1984:14-15). Rumple-Comfort Association (RUD)
soils are along broad ridge tops or gentle slopes just
below the Edwards Plateau. They are usually not
very thick, about 25 cm (14 in) of darker brown clay

Project Area Description
The project area lies on the eastern edge of the
Edwards Plateau, or on the edge of the Central
Texas Hill Country, so named for its rugged, streameroded topography. The parcel is best described as
gently rolling, although areas around it are com­
monly eroded by swift and deep-cutting streams
emanating from the higher, elevated Edwards Pla­
teau region (Figures 3 and 4). To the east of this
tract of land lies the western edge of the Blackland
Prairie (see Figure 3). The environmental zone on
which this particular parcel is located can be
classified as upland, overlooking the prairies to the
east. The annual average rainfall is about 33½ in,
with 238 growing-season days per year between
frosts (Batte 1984:96-97).

The nearest running water is the spring-fed
San Marcos River, although in the more immediate
area is Purgatory Creek, which flows during peri­
ods of heavy rainfall. The predominant vegetation
(Figure 6) that occurs across the area is oak
(Quercus), Texas cedar (Juniperus ashei), Texas
persimmon (Diospyros texana), and Texas mul­
berry (Morus microphylla), with a dense under­
story of invasive grasses and weeds (Simpson
1988). The prickly Agarita bushes (Berberis
trifoliolata) are the most common among the lower
shrubs, and thick patches of assorted cacti includ­
ing Texas prickly pear (Opuntia lindheimeri), purple
prickly pear (Opuntia violacea), and tasajillo
(Opuntia leptocaulis) were also observed during
the survey (Tull and Miller 1991).

loam, above perhaps another 25 to 30 cm (14 to 18
in) of reddish-brown clay loam. Regardless, these
soils almost always contain indurated fractured
limestone and chert cobbles which have eroded
from the underlying sedimentary limestone bed­
rock (Batte 1984:37-38). Denton Silty Clay Soils
(DeB) are located on valley slopes within the
uplands. Four zones of clay of varying colors
totaling perhaps 36 in thick lie above a layer of
fractured limestone embedded with calcareous
clayey marl. Denton Silty Clay is a high shrinkswell soil (Batte 1984:22). Orif Soils (Or) are
commonly found on floodplains located near major
creeks and rivers. They are made up of gravelly
loam, gravelly sandy loam, gravelly loamy sand
and/or a very gravelly counterpart. Orif soils are
extremely susceptible to water erosion (Batte
1984:34).

Environmental Context

Two ecological settings dominate the project area
landscape within the ecotone: uplands (see Figure
4) and creek zones (Figure 7). Historic alterations
to the primary landscape include plowing, over­
grazing, stream rechannelization, controlled burn­
ing, and the introduction of deep wells. These have
undoubtedly lowered water tables, and altered
plant and animal communities. Many springs feed­
ing the streams emanating from the Balcones Fault
are now seasonally dry (Brune 1981:75).

The importance of the wide variety of land­
forms and vegetation regions in the area, along with
the presence of permanent water, cannot be over­
emphasized in considering the history of the area.
This variety of resources available within a short
distance made this a rich region from the viewpoint
of its prehistoric inhabitants. Availability of water
would seldom have been a problem, for throughout
the area were numerous rivers, creeks, and springs
(Brune 1975). An ecotone incorporating an inter­
face of diverse ecological communities is located
just north of the Balcones Escarpment (Johnson
1967:73). These include Juniper-Oak-Mesquite
Savanna in the Edwards Plateau region and the
Blackland Prairie to the east (Black 1989a:39–41).

Cultural Chronology
Prehistoric
The most recent synthesis of the available
chronological evidence of cultural history in Cen­
tral and South Texas is presented below and in
Figure 8 (Black 1995; Hester 1995; Collins 1995).
All dates are approximate and given as years before
present (B.P.), i.e., before the introduction of ra­
diocarbon dating in 1950.

The geographic location of the project area
provides a dynamic setting for a greater diversity in
riverine, uplands, and xeric vegetation and fauna.

Pre-Clovis

deposits may prove this presumption to be true
(Collins and Hester 2004).

According to Collins and Hester (2004), mount­
ing evidence suggests that humans may have in­
habited the Central Texas landscape before 11,500
B.P. Excavations at the Gault Site (41BL323) in
Bell County have yielded artifacts that are very
similar to Upper Paleolithic artifacts found in Eu­
rope. Large, thin bifaces found at the Gault Site are
very similar to those attributed to the Solutrean
culture in Europe between 20,000 and 16,000 B.P.
Clovis blade and blade cores from Gault resemble
not only Solutrean specimens, but Aurignacian
(40,000-20,000 B.P.) and Magdalenian specimens
(16,000-11,000 B.P.) as well. Although not similar
in design to those found in Upper Paleolithic cul­
tural assemblages, 30 engraved stones were found
at Gault. The many similarities in artifact assem­
blages suggest migrations from Europe may have
resulted in a pre-Clovis occupation of North
America and Central Texas. Additional research
and reliable dating from well-stratified cultural

Paleoindian
This phase spans the period estimated at be­
tween ca. 11,500 and 8800 B.P. in Central Texas
(Collins 1995:381–383) and between 11,200 and
7950 B.P. in South Texas (Hester 1995:433–436).
Diagnostic artifacts include Clovis and Folsom
projectile points. The wide distribution of Clovis
points across most of North America and into
Central America suggests a wide dispersal of the
people who made them (Wenke 1990:201). Within
the political boundaries of Texas, Meltzer and
Bever (1995:47–81) have documented the pres­
ence of 406 Clovis points in 128 of 254 counties.
Other artifacts associated with the Clovis culture
include bifaces, prismatic blade cores and blades,
engraved stones, bone and ivory points, stone
bolas, ochre, and shaft straighteners.

In general, the Paleoindian adaptation has been
considered to be one of small bands of nomadic,
big-game hunters following herds of Late Pleis­
tocene fauna across North America, including
mammoth, mastodon, bison, camel, and horse (Black
1989b). Although they undoubtedly hunted the
larger animals as well (Dibble and Lorrain 1968),
recently, emphasis has been placed on the wide
diversity of plants and animals used for subsistence
by these early Americans (Collins 2000; Black
1989b; Hester 1983), such as turtles and tortoises,
alligators, mice, badgers, and raccoons (Collins
1995:381). Known Clovis sites include kill sites,
quarries, caches, open campsites, ritual sites, and
burials (Collins 1995:381–383; Hester 1995:433–
436). A Folsom interval follows Clovis. Folsom
artifacts are fairly common in Central and South
Texas; however, no campsites or kill sites have
been found south of Pavo Real (41BX52) in Bexar
County (Collins et al. 2003; Hester 1995:434–435).

Collins (1995:383) argues that the Early Ar­
chaic spans the period from 8800 to 6000 B.P. in
Central Texas, with three divisions based on pro­
jectile point types. However, Hester (1995:436–
438) identifies the Early Archaic with Early Cor­
ner Notched and Early Basal Notched dart points
roughly dating between 7950 and 4450 B.P. The
extinction of large herds of megafauna and the
changing climate at the beginning of the Holocene
stimulated a behavioral change by the Prehistoric
inhabitants of South Texas (McKinney 1981).
While the basic hunter-gatherer adaptation prob­
ably remained intact, an economic shift away from
big game hunting was necessary. In general, more
intensive exploitation of local resources in Central
Texas—such as deer, fish, and plant bulbs—is
often indicated by greater densities of ground stone
artifacts, fire-cracked rock cooking features, and

more specialized tools such as Clear Fork gouges
and Guadalupe bifaces (Turner and Hester 1999:246,
256). Weir (1976) speculates that Early Archaic
groups were small and highly mobile, an inference
from the fact that Early Archaic sites are thinly
distributed and that diagnostic projectile points are
seen across a wide area, including most of Texas
and northern Mexico. Story (1985) believes that
population densities were low during this period,
and that groups consisted of related individuals in
small bands with “few constraints on their mobility”
(Story 1985:39). Their economy was based on their
utilization of a wide range of resources, especially
such year-round resources as prickly pear, as well
as rodents, rabbits, and deer (Story 1985:38).

Escarpment led to intensive plant gathering and
acorn processing. He also believes that the widely
scattered bands prevalent in the Early Archaic now
began to coalesce, at least during the acorn-gather­
ing season, into larger groups who shared the
intensive work of gathering and processing the
acorn harvest (Weir 1976:126).
Many researchers believe burned rock middens
are a result of this endeavor (Creel 1986; Prewitt
1991; Weir 1976). Other investigators doubt this
conclusion (Black et al. 1997; Goode 1991) but the
exact processes which formed the burned rock
middens are still a matter of controversy (Black
1989a:28; Black et al. 1997; Leach and Bousman
2001; Mauldin et al. 2003).

Middle Archaic
The common presence of deer remains in
burned rock middens encourages the view that deer
processing took place at burned rock midden sites
(Black and McGraw 1985:278; Weir 1976:125).
Bison bone is encountered in archaeological sites
in Central and South Texas, at least occasionally,
during all but the earliest part of the Middle Ar­
chaic (Dillehay 1974).

Collins (1995:383) defines this intermediate
interval of the Archaic as lasting from about 6000
to 4000 B.P. in Central Texas, but Hester
(1995:438–441) suggests that the period between
4450 and 2350 B.P. more correctly reflects the
Middle Archaic in South Texas. Based on the large
number of sites from this period in South and
Central Texas, the Middle Archaic appears to have
been a time of increased population (Story 1985:40;
Weir 1976:125, 128). The reasons for this increase
are not known, but the amelioration of a very dry
period (Altithermal) during the Middle Archaic is
often seen as the primary cause (Sollberger and
Hester 1972:338; Story 1985:40).

There has been a tendency to equate the pres­
ence of burned rock middens with the absence of
bison (Prewitt 1981). However, examinations of
several recent faunal reports show that after about
4500 B.P., bison and burned rock middens are
contemporaneous, though not at the same sites, at
least in the southern Edwards Plateau and northern
South Texas Plain (Meissner 1993).

On the South Texas Plains, exploitation of
widely scattered, year-round resources such as
prickly pear continued (Campbell and Campbell
1981:13–15), as did the hunting of deer and rabbit.
However, a shift to concentrated, seasonal nut
harvests in the riverine environments of the
Balcones Escarpment seems to have occurred
(Black 1989b). Weir (1976) believes that an expan­
sion of oak on the Edwards Plateau and Balcones

Late Archaic
Collins (1995:384) dates the final interval of
the Archaic in Central Texas from approximately
4000 to 1200 B.P. Hester believes the Late Archaic
in South Texas may better be defined as between
2350–1250 B.P. Some researchers believe popula­
8

tions increased throughout the Late Archaic (Prewitt
1985; Skinner 1981), while others feel populations
remained the same or declined during this period
(Black 1989a:30).

placing the Transitional Archaic from 2250 to 1250
B.P. Hester states that more evidence will likely
result in what could be termed as a Terminal
Archaic period during the latter part of the Late
Archaic in South Texas. This Terminal Archaic
period is represented by diagnostic projectile points
such as Ensor, Frio, and Matamoras points, which
appear to overlap the Late Archaic and Late Prehis­
toric periods (Hester 1995:442). Weir (1976) be­
lieves this marked a transition period characterized
by localized area sites, a disappearance of burned
rock middens and bison, and a reappearance of
highly mobile hunters and gatherers. Others (Black
and McGraw 1985; Peter 1982; Skelton 1977)
argue that in some locations burned rock middens
did not disappear, and sites were more intensely
occupied during the Transitional Archaic period.

Prewitt (1981:80–81) asserts that the accumu­
lation of burned rock middens nearly ceased dur­
ing the course of this period. However, excavations
at the Blue Hole site in Uvalde County
(Mueggenborg 1994:1–74), the Honey Creek
midden in Mason County (Black et al. 1997), the
Jonas Terrace site in Medina County (Johnson
1995), and a cluster of middens in Brown County
observed by the senior author provide evidence
that large cooking features up to 15 m in diameter
were still very much in use (see also Black et al.
1997). Subsistence is assumed to have become less
specialized and focused on acorns, in favor of a
return to a broad spectrum subsistence base (Black
1989a:30). By about 1450 B.P., bison had again
disappeared (Dillehay 1974).

Late Prehistoric
Collins (1995:385) recognizes that the com­
monly used date of 1200 B.P. for the end of the
Archaic and beginning of the Late Prehistoric in
Central Texas is arbitrary, and Hester (1995:442)
acknowledges the problematic issue of selected
tools appearing at both Late Archaic and Late
Prehistoric sites. A series of distinctive traits marks
the shift from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric
period, including the technological shift to the bow
and arrow, and the introduction of pottery to Cen­
tral Texas and the northern South Texas Plain
(Black 1989a:32; Story 1985:45–47). Most re­
searchers agree that the early Late Prehistoric
period was a time of population decrease (Black
1989a:32; Collins 2004; Prewitt 1981, 1985). Even
though small burned rock middens associated with
Scallorn and Edwards points have been found (e.
g., Goode 1991:71), they are rare. Settlement shifts
into rockshelters, such as Scorpion Cave in Medina
County (Highley et al. 1978), Classen Rockshelter
in northern Bexar County (Fox and Fox 1967), and

Although inhabitants of the South Texas Plain
near Brownsville and Rockport had begun to make
pottery by about 1750 B.P., the northern part of the
plain was still “pre-ceramic” until 1,000 years later
(Story 1985:45–47). Late Archaic points tend to be
much smaller than Middle Archaic points. The
most common are Ensor and Frio types (Turner and
Hester 1999:114,122), both of which are short,
triangular points with side notches. The Frio point
also has a notched base (Turner and Hester
1999:122).

Transitional Archaic
A late subperiod or interval of the Late Archaic
is frequently referred to as the Terminal Archaic or
Transitional Archaic. Weir (1976) defines the Ter­
minal Archaic as the period between 1650 and 1150
B.P., while Turner and Hester (1999) cite data

three historically significant Spanish entradas
reached Texas. The first was Cabeza de Vaca’s
shipwreck on the Texas coast near Galveston Is­
land in 1528. It was followed by the Coronado and
Desoto expeditions reaching the Southern High
Plains and East Texas in the 1540s. Although this
marks the beginning of the Protohistoric period in
Central Texas, the region was not to be visited
again for over 100 years.

Beginning rather abruptly at about 650 B.P., a
shift in technology occurred. This phase is charac­
terized by the introduction of blade technology, the
first ceramics in Central Texas (bone-tempered
plainwares), the appearance of Perdiz arrow points,
and alternately beveled bifaces (Black 1989a:32;
Huebner 1991:346). Prewitt (1985) and Black
(1989a) suggest this technology encroached from
northern Central Texas. Patterson (1988), how­
ever, notes the Perdiz point was first seen in south­
east Texas by about 1350 B.P., and was introduced
to the west 600 to 700 years later. Hester (1995:444)
recognizes this phase as the “best documented Late
Prehistoric pattern” throughout South Texas, with
dates ranging from ca. 650/700 to 300/350 B.P.

When the Spanish missions were established
in East Texas in the late 1600s, Spanish entradas
began to travel regularly through Central Texas.
Beginning with Alonso de León’s expedition of
1680, the Camino Real (King’s Road) was estab­
lished from Villa Santiago de la Monclova in
Mexico to East Texas. This roadway followed
established Native American trade routes and trails.
These expeditions provide the first detailed written
observations on the Native American inhabitants
and the landscape of the San Marcos area.

Steele and Hunter (1986) argue for the occur­
rence of a distinct change in diet between the Late
Archaic and the Late Prehistoric based on their
examination of components in two sites in Choke
Canyon Reservoir in South Texas. Analysis of the
number of identified specimens (NISP) shows a
marked increase in artiodactyla elements present
during the late Late Prehistoric, an increase largely
due to the addition of bison to the diet (Steele and
Hunter 1986:468). Huebner (1991) suggests that
the sudden return of bison to South and Central
Texas resulted from a more xeric climate in the
plains north of Texas and increased grassiness in
the Cross-Timbers and Post Oak Savannah in north­
ern Central Texas, forming a “bison corridor” into
the South Texas Plain along the eastern edge of the
Edwards Plateau (Huebner 1991:354–355).

Written records show that various groups
camped near San Marcos Springs during the
Protohistoric period in the seventeenth and eigh­
teenth centuries, though little is known about these
native inhabitants. Some of these groups probably
lived permanently at or near the springs, while
others were on bison hunting trips to the Blackland
Prairie and their villages were in South and West
Texas (Newcomb 1993; Johnson and Campbell
1992; Foster 1995:265-289). Later, groups migrat­
ing south, such as the Tonkawa from Oklahoma,
and the Lipan Apache and Comanche from the
Plains, moved into the region, and replaced the
former groups through attrition from warfare, dis­
eases, and settlement at missions (Dunn 1911;
Campbell and Campbell 1985; Newcombe 1961,
1993).

Protohistoric
The interval between the earliest European
contact and permanent European settlements is
called the Protohistoric period. During the 1500s,

Spanish settlement in Central Texas first oc­

10

curred in San Antonio with the establishment of
Mission San Antonio de Valero (the Alamo) in 1718
and the later founding of San Antonio de Béxar
(Bolton 1970 [1915]; Habig 1977; de la Teja 1995).
The first recorded crossing of the San Marcos
River was in 1690 by Alonso De León (Foster
1995). After the first crossing of the San Marcos
River in 1690 by Alonso De León, at least eight
expeditions visited the San Marcos area during the
ensuing 37-year period. However, the first Spanish
settlement in San Marcos was not until 1755. We
have found no documents that describe the com­
munity or the people at San Marcos, and thus we
are placing this within the Protohistoric period.
What we do know from the documents is that in
August of 1755, three missions were abandoned on
the San Gabriel River near Rockdale and then
established on a temporary basis at the San Marcos
River.

Indian harassment and severe flooding (Horrell
1999:63-71). No further attempts at settlement by
either the Spanish or Mexicans were made, and the
area was then under the control of Native American
groups until the mid 1800s.

Settlement of San Marcos
In order to safeguard travel, Post San Marcos
was erected at the headwaters of the San Marcos
River to facilitate the building of a more direct road
between San Antonio and the newly established
capitol in Austin. Adjunct General Hugh McLeod
laid out the fort, which was to be garrisoned by a
company of 56 men. Captain Josef Wiehl’s com­
pany, the First Infantry Regiment, occupied the
fort. The fort and route were completed in October
1840, and shortened travel between the two impor­
tant towns by ten miles. The exact location of the
fort has never been determined. In March 1841, the
Texas army was disbanded and Post San Marcos
troops were marched to Austin and discharged.
The road still exists and is known in San Marcos as
Post Road.

Even though the exact location is not known,
historic records clearly indicate that between 1755
and 1756, the San Xavier Missions were tempo­
rarily located on the San Marcos River (Bolton
1970 [1915]). When the missions were located
along the San Marcos River, over 1,000 Lipan
Apaches resettled in the area. In 1756 the material
property from the San Xavier Missions was moved
to the Santa Cruz de San Sabá Mission near the
present-day town of Menard (Weddle 1964), and
the Native Americans were assigned to missions in
New Braunfels and San Marcos.

The town center was laid out in 1851. Early
Euro-American settlers within the San Marcos
area included Thomas G. McGehee and William
W. Moon. Both were living in the area by 1847.
The first store and post office were in operation by
1847, and in 1848, 387 inhabitants were in the
county seat of the newly designated Hays County.
A stage line to Austin and San Antonio beginning
in 1848 and the arrival of the railroad in 1881
helped establish San Marcos as a commercial cen­
ter for the shipment of products to the coastal ports
of the Gulf of Mexico. With the establishment of
Southwest Texas State Normal School in 1903,
and the San Marcos Baptist Academy in 1907, the
city continued to thrive around these two institu­
tions (Greene 2004).

Historic Settlement
The first permanent Spanish settlement near
San Marcos was along the San Marcos River,
downstream from the present town, at a village
named San Marcos de Neve, founded April 1,
1808, by Don Filipe Roque de la Portilla (Horrell
1999:66). However, the small village was aban­
doned in 1812 due to Tonkawa and Comanche

Hays County Court (1848-1861)

appear before the court, and it was this money that
was used by city planners “to build their first
substantial court house”(San Marcos Daily Record
1974). Contractor C.F. Millet was then hired to
construct the building, and on October 29, 1861, the
finished courthouse was accepted by the commis­
sioners’ board. At that time, the board noted that
the total cost of the building was $3,356.50, not
$2,000. They had previously paid Mr. Millet the
$2,000, and then ordered that he be paid the
remaining $1,356.50 owed for complying with the
contract to build the courthouse (CCM:A150).
Erhard (1874:1) states that the building was “con­
structed of choice pine”, and given “a roof of
juniper.” Unfortunately the courthouse stood only
seven years. While court was in session, the build­
ing caught fire and was destroyed in 1868 (Erhard
1874).

The original court of Hays County was held in
a multipurpose building. It was built in 1848 on
land that was donated for the creation of a town
square by San Marcos founders William Lindsey,
Edward Burleson, and Eli Merriman. “Constructed
of cypress and elm boards and logs”, the building
not only served the early community of Hays
County as a courthouse, but as a church and school
as well (Erhard 1874). Following an attempt by
outside pressures in 1858 to move the county seat
away from San Marcos to a more central site,
commissioners voted to build a new and more
impressive structure that would serve solely as a
courthouse, allowing them to retain the county
seat.

First Courthouse (1861-1868)
In a meeting of the County Commissioners
Court Board on November 21, 1860, the members
noted the recent public vote to locate the county
seat in San Marcos, and conceived it then “to be
their duty to proceed and erect public buildings for
the benefit of the citizens” (Commissioners Court
Minutes, Volume A, page 124 [CCM:A124],
Records on file, Hays County Records).

Second Courthouse (1872-1881)

Specifications for the new building cover three
pages in the Court minutes, and in part state that the
new building was “to be built of stone on a clay
bottom 18″ thick to the top of the ground & 1 foot
thick from there up, the foundation to be 6 inches
above the ground at the lowest places. Good sub­
stantial plain rock work…, the building to be 36 by
40 feet from outside to outside of front”
(CCM:A133-135).

On February 2, 1869, the commissioners or­
dered that “publication be made in the Daily Austin
Republican and San Antonio Herald for the bilding
[sic] of the court house in this county” (CCM:B3).
On June 28, 1869, the court accepted John M.
Campbell’s bid for erecting a second courthouse
for Hays County. According to court minutes, Mr.
Campbell’s bid was accepted because it was the
lowest submitted at only $13,500 (CCM:B23). At
least some of the labor that went into building the
new courthouse was done by prisoners. On April 5,
1870, the court was ordered to pay John Campbell
the sum of one hundred dollars out of the county’s
account for keeping prisoners, but to credit that
money toward the account set aside for Campbell’s
courthouse contract (CCM:B42).

In his writings of early life in San Marcos,
Cayton Erhard, an early settler and founder, states
that a fortified murder bond of $2,000.00 was
collected by the city after a defendant failed to

Regardless of who was doing the actual labor,
it appears there were problems with paying for the
work. On August 15, 1870, John Campbell’s attor­
ney, Mr.W. W. Martin, appeared before the court

12

with a brief stating that Campbell had complied thus
far with the terms and provisions of the contract,
but the court was in arrears “in the sum of about
three or four thousand dollars.” (CCM:B51). In
response, the court ordered that an additional four
hundred dollars worth of bonds be sold and the
proceeds paid to Campbell (CCM:B52-53). Mr.
Campbell likely had a valid claim, but the remain­
der of the brief intimates a protective, defensive
tone against being held responsible for the quality
of workmanship at the new courthouse. To wit:

Between February and April 1872, a step was
installed, the chimneys were finished, and doors
and doors sills were installed (CCM:B113, 116, 118,
121). Finally, on May 27, 1872, the district clerk was
ordered to move his office with all records and
books onto the second floor of the new courthouse
until the first floor was finished (CCM:B122). A
blackboard and new furniture was purchased for
the building beginning in June (CCM:B125). By
October of 1872, a Mr. A. Feltner had completed
the unfinished masonry, plastering, flooring, and
painting, and had installed stone steps at each main
entrance (CCM:B121, 127, 138). After all work
was apparently completed, Mr. Tom Steen was
paid $7.08 for cleaning off the construction debris
from the courthouse yard in November 1872
(CCM:B143).

“Hence said Campbell hereby
demands an immediate compliance
with the terms and provisions of said
contract on the part of said county
court, and respectfully notifies said
court that he, J. M. Campbell will not
hold himself liable or in any wise
responsible for any losses, damages,
or liabilities that have heretofore been,
or may hereafter be sustained by said
county of Hays in consequence of any
failure on the part of said county court
to comply with the terms of said con­
tract.” (CCM: B51)

The courthouse itself stood as a “2-story, 45 x
53 foot” (Texas Historical Marker 10280:1974)
monument constructed of “soft stone quarried near
San Marcos and brought to the site to be hewn”(San
Marcos Daily Record 1971). In 1876 an unknown
arsonist tried to burn the new courthouse (San
Marcos Free Press 1876). Though slightly charred,
the courthouse stood for another five years before
the commissioners’ court condemned it due to
structural instabilities brought on not by the fire but
by the material originally used for its construction.
Although Ehard (1874) states the foundation of the
courthouse was weakened due to some kind of
“earth tremors,” the most likely cause was the soft
stone material used during its construction rather
than seismic vibrations. A careful inspection by the
commissioners and many other citizens has re­
vealed the fact that a considerable part of the
material of which it was built was not really stone
at all, but a sort of earth, which will readily crumble
to the touch (San Marcos Free Press 1881).

On September 2, 1871, the county had the
money to pay Mr. Campbell the balance due on the
first and second installments owed him, as well as
the final payment upon the completion of the
courthouse (CCM:B94). Two months later, on
December 15, 1871, Mr. Campbell was paid for the
work he had thus far completed (CCM:B106) and
Mr. Ed Northcraft and Mr. Chauncey Donaldson
were hired to finish the building for $4,100.00.
They were to “complete the windows, painting,
roofing, guttering, cupola, and all carpenter work”
(CCM:B106-107). They went on to say that once
this work was accomplished, then the County
Treasurer would accept the building (CCM:B107).

upper story of the building. In this particular
instance, the court “records were saved because
they were in the separate building in the office of
the County Clerk” (San Marcos Daily Record
1974).

The commissioners theorized that because of
the overwhelming number of weak stones found
within the walls, it was also likely that they were a
part of the foundation as well, which would explain
the poor condition of the building in general. “The
false stones are everywhere to be seen crumbling
and broken... and every indication of a speedy
wreak and ruin” was present (San Marcos Free
Press 1881). Following this article, the commis­
sioners made plans to condemn and demolish the
weathered courthouse and to begin construction on
a new courthouse made of a harder, more durable
material (CCM:C173; CCM:C172; CCM:C246).
In September the remains of the old courthouse
were sold at public auction to William Giesen
(CCM C171).

Fourth Courthouse (1909-Present)
After the loss of the third courthouse, Hays
County officials contracted the Austin firm of
C.H. Page and Brother with the task of once again
rebuilding the county seat. “The fourth and present
courthouse, in eclectic style, was…completed and
accepted by the county court on Dec. 13, 1909”
(Texas Historical Marker 10280:1974). In the
1940s, steel rods were incorporated into the build­
ing in an attempt to “retain damaged and weakened
portions of the exterior brick” (San Marcos Daily
Record 1971). Sidewalks, porches, and an eleva­
tor were added to the structure to assist with its
modernization in the 1950s. In 1971–1972, resto­
ration work was undertaken that included general
“repairs and additional space and extra vaults in
the offices of the County Clerk, County Judge, Tax
Collector and motor vehicle division” (San Marcos
Daily Record 1974). Though many improvements
have been made on its exterior, the Hays county
courthouse still has its historical charm on the
inside.

Third Courthouse (1882-1908)
Once debris had finally been cleared, county
commissioners approved the plans and specifica­
tions of architect F. E. Ruffini of Austin and local
contractors B. F. Donalson and J. C. Rogers to
construct a new 50x60-ft, 2-story building at a cost
of $27,474 (CCM:C188;C209; San Marcos Daily
Record 1974). The cornerstone was laid on June
13, 1882 (CCM:C252).
Although Mr. Ruffini was to be the project’s
overall superintendent, Mr. C. Wilhelm was hired
as superintendent to erect the stone walls (CCM:
C275). This time the commissioners made sure that
the stone was “sufficient and suitable building
rock” (CCM:C246). Finally, on February 26, 1883,
the courthouse was officially received from archi­
tect Ruffini, and then from contractors Donalson
and Rogers on March 10. Two years later, commis­
sioners accepted their new courthouse which was
constructed with a higher quality limestone and
other hard rocks. The third Hays County court­
house stood for many years until a fire broke out on
February 28, 1908, and completely destroyed the

Archaeological Investigations
Previous Investigations
As of August 2004, the three sites documented
during this project were issued the state’s trinomi­
als of 41HY386–388, indicating there are now 388
sites recorded in Hays County. Possibly the most
significant prehistoric archaeological sites in Hays
County, and perhaps Texas, are around Aquarena
Springs in San Marcos, approximately 6 km (3.75

14

The Current Project

mi) northwest of the project area, along the escarp­
ment. Projectile points ranging in age from the
Paleoindian through Late Prehistoric intervals have
been recovered during archaeological investiga­
tions over the past 23 years (e.g., Shiner 1979,
1981; Garber et al. 1983). An examination of
earthen cores drilled to bedrock in an area close to
the springs have revealed evidence of human
occupation that may lie stratigraphically below the
Paleoindian occupation. Ongoing investigations
around the springs could potentially yield addi­
tional Clovis, and perhaps even pre-Clovis cultural
material.

Project Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological
issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with
limited shovel test and backhoe excavation. The
issues addressed were site type, distribution, den­
sity, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The theoretical
framework is structured around patterns of settle­
ment, mobility, subsistence, and social systems for
the Central Texas region.
The goals of the project were to
1) locate and record cultural locations and
sites in the project area using a systematic
survey methodology;
2) measure, quantify, and analyze site type,
site distribution, site density, and site size,
as well as depth, and stratigraphy; and,
3) measure and quantify the lithic collection
and to place any diagnostic artifacts within
the regional time frame.

There are three archaeological sites within a
few hundred meters of the pipeline right-of-way
surveyed during this project. The remains of the
Donaldson farmstead/dairy (41HY191) are situ­
ated on a prehistoric lithic procurement site ap­
proximately 15 m to the east of the end of the rock
wall that is part of 41HY388. The site was origi­
nally documented in 1986 during a survey for the
Indian Creek subdivision, and revisited in 1999
during a survey for the Westover Addition
(Gearhart and Lara 1986; Espey, Huston & Asso­
ciates 1999). 41HY72 is a small lithic procurement
source located approximately 200 m west. It was
discovered during a San Marcos Watershed sur­
vey in 1974 (Patterson and Ivey 1974). Approxi­
mately 200 m to the north is 41HY192, a very large
lithic procurement and primary reduction site ex­
tending from an upland area to the edge of an upper
tributary of Purgatory Creek. It was discovered
during the Indian Creek Subdivision survey in
1986, and again revisited during a survey for the
Wonder World Drive extension in 2002 (Espey,
Huston & Associates 1986; Karbula et al. 2003). A
karst feature (WWD-52) encountered at site
41HY387 was also subjected to prior excavation
during a biological assessment for the Wonder
World Drive extension (Veni 2002).

Methodology
Prefield Preparation
Before the official survey began, the Co-Prin­
cipal Investigator and Project Archaeologist in­
spected the project area to better understand the
topography, surface visibility, and site potential. A
thorough review of the literature pertaining to the
area was conducted. Site and survey reports from
the area were examined. A Hays County soils
survey book, a geological atlas sheet, and the San
Marcos North and South USGS 7.5 quadrangle
maps were consulted.

15

The Survey

Twenty-eight shovel test units were placed
approximately 100 m apart across the 2,755-linear­
meter project area (Figure 9). Exceptions to the
100-m distance were when bedrock was encoun­
tered over extended areas. They were dug in 10­
cm levels to the lesser depth of either 50 cm or to
bedrock. All sediments were screened through ¼­
in wire mesh.

The pedestrian survey began in the northeast
corner of the project area. The surveyors mean­
dered within the 12-m-wide proposed right-of-way
to insure better surface coverage. When an artifact
was found, flagging tape was placed under the
artifact, as well as in a tree or bush above it.
Distance between the surveyors allowed for con­
stant communication regarding discovered arti­
facts, and the project archaeologist was able to
examine all finds. Although diagnostic artifacts
would have been collected for further examina­
tion, none were found. The only artifacts collected
were those recovered from shovel test units and a
backhoe trench. However, those artifacts were
determined to be of little significance, and are of
the types repeated throughout the archaeological
record.

Three backhoe trenches were also placed on
the tract to examine the underlying soil stratigra­
phy (Figure 10). The first was excavated on a lower
terrace deposit adjacent to an unnamed tributary.
The second was excavated on 41HY386, located
on the same terrace and tributary but farther down­
stream. The third was positioned on a lower terrace
of Purgatory Creek. Soil samples from each zone
were collected for magnetic susceptibility analy­
sis.

Figure 9. Twelve shovel tests were excavated on two archaeological sites in addition to twentyeight shovel tests along the linear pipeline right-of-way.

by laboratory personnel using water and tooth­
brushes. Once the artifacts were washed, they were
allowed to air dry on mesh racks before being
transferred to cardboard flats for temporary stor­
age. Throughout this process, the provenience
information was kept with the materials. After all
the artifacts had been processed, CAS laboratory
personnel catalogued them using an Excel spread­
sheet.

When artifacts were discovered, abundant flag­
ging tape was hung in the trees to facilitate return­
ing to the area for further documentation. Upon
completion of the pedestrian survey and excava­
tion of shovel tests, each potential site was revisited
by the survey team. The area was intensely exam­
ined to further determine the extent of cultural
material present on the surface, and additional
shovel tests were excavated. A nail was driven into
a tree as a site datum, and Universal Transverse
Mercator (UTM) coordinates for the datum were
obtained using a hand-held Trimble GEO III Glo­
bal Positioning System (GPS) (Figure 11). In
addition, the GPS unit was used to map the site
boundary, shovel test locations, backhoe trenches
if applicable, and any natural or artificial features
present.

Mapping
In addition to collecting data on the site’s
datum and boundary, GPS readings were also
taken at shovel test and backhoe trench locations,
as well as at selected surveyor’s pins for orienta­
tion. Data collected in the field was downloaded
into a permanent database to create a site map and
an overall map, which was then superimposed over
the USGS Quad map and a surveyor’s plat pro­
vided by the City of San Marcos.

Laboratory Methods
Artifacts were brought to the CAS Laboratory
at the end of the field survey. Artifacts were washed

backhoe trenches, archaeological sites, and certain terrain features.

Results of the Current
Investigation
Pedestrian Survey
A single, unifacial scraper was found in an
upland area (Figure 12). Otherwise, no artifacts
were observed on the surface other than those at
41HY387. Surface visibility ranged from 5 percent
along the open pasture and lower stream areas to
100 percent in the uplands where large areas of
exposed bedrock were common. There was also
evidence of disturbance over much of the survey
area, primarily from road and artificial berm con­
struction. Numerous mechanically pushed mounds
of dirt and rocks were present in some areas.
Crushed gravels were a common occurrence on the
surface in those areas.

Shovel Test Excavtions

Geoarchaeological Investigation

As expected after reviewing soils and geologi­
cal maps of the area, surface examination and
excavation of shovel test units revealed large areas
of exposed bedrock and boulders in the upland

The focus of the geoarchaeological investiga­
tion was to assess the upper late Quaternary geo­
morphic history and potential for buried archaeo­
logical deposits within the survey area. Though
limited in scope, this project allowed for the de­
scription of subsurface sediments, soils, and bed­
rock in the upper reaches of Purgatory Creek, and
should complement any further geoarchaeological
studies in the area. For field expediency and con­
sistency, the distinct layers of deposits were desig­
nated zones. A zone is considered to be a geologi­
cally neutral term acceptable for labeling sediment
layers. Similar sediment layers receive the same

areas, generally shallow stony clay loam in colluvial
settings, with slightly deeper stony clay and loam
along the stream edges. Figure 13 shows the depths
of shovel tests along the 2,755-linear-meter rightof-way, and Figure 5 shows their locations. Those
dug to less than 50 cm are where bedrock was
encountered. No artifacts were found in any of the
28 tests. The results of shovel tests on archaeologi­
cal sites are discussed below.

upper portion of Zone II, and are discussed below
(41HY386). A thicker, 70-cm organic zone was
encountered in BHT 3, situated on a lower terrace of
Purgatory Creek. This is not surprising as Purgatory
carries a higher volume of sediment than its first
order tributary by which BHT 1 and 2 were placed.
No evidence of cultural occupation was observed in
BHT 3.

Backhoe Trench 1 (BHT 1) was placed on a
small lower terrace of an unnamed tributary, ap­
proximately 175 m upstream from its confluence
with Purgatory Creek. The darker, organically
enriched clay loam was very shallow, no evidence
of cultural material was found, and weakly ce­
mented gravels were encountered 18 cm below the
surface. BHT 2 was placed downstream on the
same intermittent drainage and terrace, approxi­
mately 20 m above the Purgatory Creek channel.
A total of five flakes was recovered from the

Soil samples were collected from each of the
four zones in the three trenches. Figure 14 illus­
trates the magnetic susceptibility values of the

values are very similar for BHTs 1 and 2. These
similar patterns suggest similar depositional epi­
sodes and similar sediment packages. The higher

values in BHT 2 suggest enriched organics on the
lower area of the stream as it loses some of its
energy near its confluence with Purgatory. The
enrichment has occurred because of probable cul­
tivation on that part of the field where BHT 2 is
located. Although we found artifacts in BHT 2 and
in surrounding shovel test units, most conspicuous
is that there is no distinct high node from the norms
between the two trenches suggesting a probable
human occupation zone. It is likely since the arti­
facts were found in and on a gravel lens, they are
not located in primary context. As such, the basic
soil susceptibility values are premised upon sedi­
ment zones and not prehistoric human occupation.

Description
This site is a small, ephemeral lithic scatter
situated in a grassy, tree-lined clearing located on a
lower terrace of an intermittent tributary of Purga­
tory Creek (Figures 15 and 16). Sloping toward the
southwest, the site ranges in elevation from 620 to
622 ft, and covers an area of 55x36 m. ComfortRock Outcrop Complex, undulating (CrD) soils
support native grasses between stands of oak,
mesquite, cedar, and various shrubs. Surface

area. The site has been impacted by erosion,
bioturbation, and rapid stream runoff, as well as a
two-track road and a push pile located in the
southeast corner near site datum. In addition, the
semi-cleared area with some secondary growth
suggests that the area has been cleared and likely
cultivated in historic times. The proposed 12-m­
wide pipeline right-of-way will run through the
length of the site.

ered. The five flakes appeared to come from the
upper portion of Zone III within smoothed limestone
gravels up to 12 cm in size, and approximately 50
percent by volume; an apparent dispersed gravel
bar with a gradual, sloping lower boundary (see
Table 2). An examination of the artifacts revealed
evidence of heavy weathering, suggesting longterm exposure, but they also exhibited fresh nicks,
irregular flake scars, and smoothed edges as would
be expected if they were stream transported.

Level of Work and Results

Seven shovel tests were excavated in the imme­
diate area to determine the vertical and horizontal
extent of the site, and to evaluate the site’s integrity
(Table 4). As shown in Table 4, three flakes were
recovered. However, two of the three were within
gravel deposits, and all three exhibit fresh nicks and
scars on older surfaces, suggesting they have been
transported within alluvium.

Although no artifacts were visible on the sur­
face, this site was discovered when five flakes were
recovered from back dirt during the excavation of
a backhoe trench (BHT 2). The backhoe trench was
excavated slowly in 5-to-10-cm levels, and back
dirt from the trench was slowly spread, thus allow­
ing archaeologists to determine with near certainty
the contexts from which any artifacts were recov­

Conclusions/Recommendations

41HY387

Based on results of the shovel tests and back­
hoe trench, our assessment is that the artifacts were
in a secondary context, likely transported within
rapid stream alluvial deposits. Additional distur­
bance that has occurred to this immediate area in
the forms of a two-track road, an obvious machin­
ery pushed dirt and rock pile, and probable historic
cultivation make the research value of this site
minimal. Notably, two pieces of crushed chert
found in Shovel Test 34 lend further support to this
contention. Therefore, no further work is recom­
mended, and no adverse impacts will occur with the
construction of a pipeline through the site.

Description
41HY387 is located on a slope on the northern
side of a large hill overlooking a small, intermittent
tributary of Purgatory Creek (Figures 17 and 18).
The site ranges in elevation from 690 to 700 ft and
encompasses an area roughly 26x19 m. ComfortRock Outcrop Complex, undulating (CrD) soils
support a moderately dense growth of mesquite,
persimmon, hackberry, and cedar trees, with as­
sorted cacti, various shrubs, and herbaceous weeds
as understory. Erosion has exposed numerous
patches of limestone bedrock throughout the area.

Otherwise, large chunks of irregular, broken bed­
rock predominate the slope. A natural karst feature,
located on the northwestern portion of the site, has
been filled in with these chunks of bedrock. Shat­
tered chert and limestone caused by cattle treading
and heavy machinery was observed across the site.
In addition, a powerline crosses over the northern
portion of the site.

the karst. An ephemeral lithic scatter of cultural
origin was observed mixed with heavy machinery
crushed chert 10 m to the east of the karst. The
clearing of two apparent bulldozer trails running
from north to south and east to west across the site
caused the crushed chert. The artifacts consisted
of a crude biface exhibiting evidence of mid-stage
reduction, a uniface with right lateral edge retouch,
and two interior flakes. Six shovel tests, dug to
between 8 and 20 cm before encountering bedrock,
were all negative.

Level of Work and Results
The infilled karst feature was discovered while
walking the pipeline right-of-way. Its irregular
opening measures approximately 1.5 m from north
to south by 90 cm from east to west. It has been
filled in nearly to the surface with large, angular
chunks of limestone. Brush and limbs partially
obscure the opening. The feature was photographed
and coordinates recorded by a GPS unit, but was
not further investigated. CAS archaeologists con­
ducted a surface survey outside the normal 12-m­
wide right-of-way, to within a 45-m radius around

Conclusions/Recommendations
Overall, the site has been disturbed by heavy
machinery, and is otherwise eroded and deflated.
As such, the lithic tools and debitage found at the
site are obviously in secondary context. The karst
feature associated with this site was the subject of
prior investigations (Veni 2002) that determined it
had no archaeological significance.

of the quarry in a northwesterly direction for 330 ft.
Cedar fence posts have been imbedded within the
top rock wall and support a barbed wire fence. The
site ranges in elevation from 675 to 700 ft. Dense
brush, weeds, and cacti provide the understory to a
thick canopy of hackberry, oak, and mesquite trees,
all supported by a thin layer of Comfort-Rock
Outcrop Complex undulating (CrD) soils. The pro­
posed pipeline right-of-way runs through the aban­
doned quarry.

Description
41HY388 consists of an abandoned historic
limestone quarry, with a hand hewn, stacked lime­
stone rock wall running from the modern surface to
the north, and through the bottom of the quarry.
The eastern portion of the quarry has been fully
filled in with dirt, while the western portion is
partially filled with modern trash (Figures 19 and
20). The open portion measures approximately 130
ft in length and 30 ft in width. The rock wall
apparently served as a property boundary or fence.
It ranges in height from 18 in where it is partially
collapsed in the bottom of the quarry, to 40 in on the
upper, modern surface. It extends from the middle

tion of the rock wall and quarry consisted of a

investigations were attempted. Archival investiga­
tions failed to conclusively identify either the date
of the two components or the persons who quarried

western portion that is now partially filled with
modern trash, was at one time perhaps 25 ft deep.
Mr. Billings repeated local rumors that the quarry
may have been used to supply the stones to con­
struct the Hays County Courthouse in downtown
San Marcos, but could offer no evidence of proof.
Official Hays County records and newspapers
were researched to provide proof that the quarry
was in fact used to provide stone for either the
second or third county courthouse (the first was
wood, the fourth is brick; see “Historic Settlement”
Section). No conclusive documentation could be
found to substantiate the local rumors. Circum­
stantial evidence that the quarry provided the stone
for the second courthouse (1872-1881) was found
in Tula Townsend Wyatt’s collection in the San
Marcos Library. In a one-page, undated, typewrit­
ten document titled “A few interesting facts about
the courthouse,” Mrs. Wyatt states:

Abandoned Quarry
Although the bottom of the quarry is partially
filled with trash, no piece that could be positively
dated prior to 1950 was observed. The limestone
faces of the quarry were examined, but no evidence
of chisel marks or other tool markings were present.
The adjacent landowner, Mr. Roger Billings, in­
formed us that the quarry was there when his father
purchased his parcel in 1931, and that the quarry
extended in a “V” shape onto his property. He
stated that it took several truckloads of dirt to fill in
the eastern portion of the quarry that was perhaps
75 ft deep. He further offered that in 1931, the

Conclusions/Recommendation

“The second building was of soft
stone and cost $13,500.00. The stone
was from a quarry in the present
Westover addition of San Marcos.
The pit can be identified even grown
over with brush and trees. The stones
were brought to the courthouse site
and cut into blocks” (The Tula
Townsend Wyatt Collection).

Although the age of the rock wall and the
person or persons who constructed it have not been
ascertained, the City of San Marcos and pipeline
engineering and design consultants Alan Plummer
Associates, Inc. have agreed to avoid any impact to
the intact portions of the wall. Neither the age of the
quarry operation nor the use of its stone has been
ascertained. Local lore that suggests the stone was
used for an 1800s Hays County courthouse has not
been verified. Nevertheless, in its present condi­
tion, the construction of a pipeline through the
center of the open, western portion of the quarry is
viewed as having minimal impact, and we recom­
mend that the project be allowed to proceed as
designed.

What we do know is that Mr. Billings, the
adjacent landowner whose father filled in part of
the quarry, now designated as 41HY388, lives in
the western-most portion of the Westover Addi­
tion. The quarry today exactly matches the descrip­
tion given by Mrs. Wyatt.

Rock Wall
The entire length of the rock wall was exam­
ined for chisel marks or other tool markings, but
none were found. The ground surface was also
examined, with only modern glass observed along
certain sections of the rock wall. This low lime­
stone wall was an apparent property boundary, and
intended to keep animals within the property. It is
hand hewn construction, not chiseled, and it is not
well dressed and squared as is often seen in German
communities in the Texas Hill Country. As stated,
it now has a cedar post and barbed wire fence
embedded within the top layers of the rocks.The
oldest wire is a two-strand, flat barbed type that is
likely a Baker’s Barb Needle Point Variation
(Clifton 1970:90) and could feasibly date to as
early as 1883. However, because barbed wire of
this type was manufactured for many years, the
true age of the wire on the rock wall is unknown.
Because the rock wall extends down into the quarry,
it obviously post-dates the quarrying activity.

Summary
Three new archaeological sites were recorded
during this project. 41HY386 is a disturbed, ephem­
eral lithic scatter which is of little significance, and
construction of a pipeline through this site should
be allowed to proceed as designed. 41HY387 is
also a disturbed, ephemeral lithic scatter, near a
natural karst feature. 41HY388 is a historic rock
wall and abandoned limestone quarry, both of
undetermined age. We recommend that the rock
wall be avoided during construction of the pipe­
line, and the City of San Marcos has agreed to do
so. We recommend that construction of the pipe­
line be allowed to proceed as designed through the
quarry area.
