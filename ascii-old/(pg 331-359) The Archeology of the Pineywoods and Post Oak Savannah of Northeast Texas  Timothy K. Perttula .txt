The Archeology of the Pineywoods and
Post Oak Savanna of Northeast Texas
Timothy K. Perttula

ABSTRACT
This paper considers the diverse character of the prehistoric and early historic archeological record in the
Pineywoods and Post Oak Savanna of the Northeast Texas Archeological Region, especially that of the
Sabine River and Cypress Creek basins. Native Americans settled in the region some 12,000 years ago, and
ranged through its forests, grasslands, and broad floodplains and wetlands as mobile hunter-gatherers. About
2000 years ago, these Native Americans (ancestral to Caddo peoples) began to settle down in recognizable
territories, to make better use of native seeds and tropical cultigens, and practiced the art of ceramics. From
this milieu, developed the vibrant and sophisticated prehistoric Caddo culture ca. A.D. 800. The prehistoric
Caddo were prosperous horticulturists and traders, lived in dispersed sedentary hamlets and villages, and
were temple and burial mound builders marking the ceremonial and religious places of important priests and
chiefs. The Caddo continued to live in this part of Northeast Texas until as late as 1842, cooperatively living
and interacting with the European and American colonizers of their land until they were removed to the
Brazos River in the 1840s-1850s, and then removed again to Oklahoma in 1859.

INTRODUCTION
The main purpose of this paper is to summarize the current state of knowledge concerning the
prehistoric and early historic archeo!ogical record
of the Pineywoods and Post Oak Savanna of Northeast Texas (Figure 1). I first discuss the natural
setting of the area and the history of archeological
investigations in Northeast Texas, then turn to a
succinct but broad presentation of the native history of the region. Much attention is given to the
Late Caddo period (ca. A.D. !400-1680) archeological record (as defined by Story 1990), particularly what archeologists have come to call the Titus
phase, because our knowledge of this span of Caddo
prehistory is reasonably well-developed (e.g.,
Thurmond 1985, 1990a; Turner !978, 1992; Perttula
1992a), and because our focus on the Titus phase
provides the best opportunity to understand what
prehistoric Caddo culture was like before, and immediately after, Europeans invaded the area.

NATURAL SETTING

Northeast Texas has three main biotic communities: the Post Oak Savanna or Oak Woodlands,

the Blackland Prairie, and the Pineywoods. The
area of interest discussed herein lies principally
within the modern distribution of the Pineywoods
and the Post Oak Savanna, with a small portion of
the Blackland Prairie at the western margins of the
region (Figure 2).
The Post Oak Savanna is a narrow southwestnortheast trending woodland belt that marks a
natural transition zone or ecotone between the more
xeric Blackland Prairie to the west and the more
mesic Pineywoods to the east (Kfichler 1964). Both
the Post Oak Savanna and the Pineywoods have
medium-tall to tall broadleaf decidous forests, and
shortleaf and loblolly pines are common in the
Pineywoods on upland fine sandy loam soils with
adequate moisture. Small areas of tall grass prairie
may be present in both communities throughout the
region (e.g., Jordan 1981:Figure 4.1). Bottomland
communities along the Sabine and Cypress
drainages contained a diverse hardwood and swamp
forest.
The climate of the region is humid, with a
mean annual precipitation of at least 120 cm; periods of maximum rainfall occur in the spring and
fall seasons. Droughts are not uncommon, and dendrochronological analyses of tree rings for the last
500 years suggest there were numerous wet and dry

spells between ca. A.D. 1500-1700. The worst
droughts occurred around A.D. 1555, 1570, 1595,
and 1670, and the period between A.D. 1549-1577
has been suggested to have been the worst June
drought in the past 450 years (Stahle et al. 1985).
These climatic perturbations presumably affected
the predictability and success of the maize harvests
during the Caddoan occupation of the Pineywoods
and Post Oak Savanna, and certainly similar perturbations in the Holocene also affected the range,
distribution, and abundance of naturally occurring
plants and animals during the long prehistoric Native American settlement of Northeast Texas (see
Collins and Bousman 1993:57-59; Ferring 1994).
How these droughts affected the flow of the numerous upland springs used by the Caddo in the
Pineywoods is unknown.
The Holocene paleoenvironmental record for
Northeast Texas is not particularly well known,

although paleoenvironmental data from
Prairie-Savannah Texas pollen cores and
stable carbon isotopes have proved useful to
Fields and Tomka (1993) in modelling
Paleoindian and Archaic mobility strategies
in the Northeast Texas Archeological Region.
A 14,000 year stable isotopic record from the
Aubrey site in the Trinity River basin
documents significant changing climatic
conditions, with wetter (and perhaps slightly
cooler) or more humid climates from ca.
11,000-7500 years B.P., then again between
4000-2000 years B.P., and after 1000 years
ago (Humphrey and Ferring 1994:Figure 8).
It was drier than today between 7500-4000
years ago and about 2000-1000 years ago. It
is interesting that fossil vertebrate, pollen, and
stable isotope data from Central Texas and
the Edwards Plateau tell a somewhat different
story, highlighting two dry climatic peaks
between ca. 7000-3000/2500 years B.P. and
after 1000 years ago (e.g., Toomey et al.
1993). While these presumed climatic changes
have implications for the relative position of
the prairie-forest border, the possible presence
or absence of bison, and the natural resource
potential of the Pineywoods and Post Oak
Savanna, it remains to be determined how
these broad environmental changes actually
pertain to the archeological record from
Northeast Texas.

HISTORY
OF
INVESTIGATIONS
Archeological research in the central part of
the Northeast Texas Archeological Region has a
lengthy history that has been thoroughly discussed
by Story (1990), Thurmond (1990a), and Guy
(1990). Please consult these excellent publications
for more specific information on the history of archeological research in Northeast Texas.
Much of our knowledge of the prehistoric use
of the region is primarily based on the 1930s
excavations of aboriginal sites and cemeteries
(Pearce !932; Jackson 1933, 1934) in the Cypress,
Sabine, and Sulphur basins by the University of
Texas. Since the 1930s, most of the information
about the Paleoindian, Archaic, Early Ceramic, and

Caddoan archeological record in the Pineywoods
comes from avocational archeological investigations
(cf. Nelson et al. 1994; Thurmond 1990a; M. Turner
1993, 1994; R. Turner 1978, 1992, 1995; Webb et
al. 1969), along with professional archeological
work in a number of state and federally-funded or
permitted reservoirs in the Sabine and Cypress
basins (Bruseth and Perttula 1981; Horizon
Environmental Services, Inc. !993, 1995;
McClurkan et al. 1966; Thurmond 1990a; Woodall
1969) as well as in large surface lignite mines (e.g.,
Kotter et al. 1991, t993; Nash et al. 1995; Rogers
et al. 1994).
Another source of information, unfortunately,
includes the activities of the numerous pothunters
and collectors in Northeast Texas. Most of the larger
Caddoan cemeteries and habitation sites in the
region (including those on Federal lands) have been
located and dug by pothunters over the last 15 years
(Perttula 1992a, 1992b), although site looting and
vandalism has been a persistent problem in the
region since the early 1900s (Perttula 1993d:2425). Very little, if any, reliable archeological data

from pothunter digs has been accessible to the
professional archeological community. The
indiscriminate collecting of lithics and ceramics
from sites exposed along the shorelines of federal
and state-maintained reservoirs in the region has
also unfortunately destroyed many Caddoan
archeological sites as well as much useful
archeological information.

THE NORTHEAST TEXAS
PINEYWOODS AND POST OAK
SAVANNA ARCHEOLOGICAL RECORD

The Native American settlement of the Post
Oak Savanna and Pineywoods of Northeast Texas is
a story that began over 11,000 years ago, and "is
long, complex, and endlessly fascinating"
(Schambach 1993:1). From the archeological record
of this region, one may grasp bits and pieces of the
tale: the mobile Paleoindian and Archaic foragers;
the !ong-distance trade and exchange of goods (i.e.,
lithic raw materials); the development of sedentary

334

communities of foragers and possibly pre-maize
cultigen users (e.g., Fritz 1994); the adoption of
ceramics and the bow and arrow; the development
of complex Caddoan horticultural and agricultural
societies; the use of earthen mounds; and the seemingly rapid abandonment of much of the region in
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries due in large
measure to the effects of European-introduced diseases as well as the European colonization of traditional Caddoan territory, followed by the permanent
expulsion of Caddo groups. Many of the archeological details of these events and developments are
well-known (see especially Story 1990; Thurmond
1988, 1990a; Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:69-187).
For the period prior to about 6000 years ago,
the Northeast Texas archeological record primarily
consists of surficial, mixed, or isolated finds of
diagnostic projectile points (cf. Johnson 1989; Story
1990). Undoubtedly discrete archeological components are present in the region (as shown by the
buried Finley Fan site occupied as early as 6400
years B.P. [Gadus et al. 1992] and the spatially
discrete Late Paleoindian John Pearce site [Webb
et al. 1971]), but they have proven to be quite
difficult to define and recognize.
Paleoindian materials have been recovered at
a number of archeological sites in the Pineywoods
and Post Oak Savanna of Northeast Texas, and the
locations of the better known sites are illustrated in
Figure 3. At the Forrest Murphey site (41MR62),
Clovis, Plainview, Dalton, and other lanceolate projectile point forms and tools were found in several
discrete concentrations on a high terrace above Big
Cypress Creek; faunal remains from extinct elephants were also recovered in apparent association (Story 1990), which is rather rare (see Meltzer
and Bever, this volume).
The distributions of Paleoindian artifacts within
the Sabine River and Cypress Creek basins suggest
that these early occupations were principally situated within the valleys of major stream basins
(Thurmond 1990a:Table 53 and 54). The relatively
sparse Paleoindian archeological record, in conjunction with the dispersion of artifacts on many landforms and different settings within the region, seems
to indicate that the Paleoindian groups were very
mobile hunters and gatherers rather than specialized
hunters of extinct megafauna (Fields and Tomka
1993:82). Johnson (1989) also suggests that some of
the Paleoindian archeological remains (Plainview
and Scottsbluff projectile points, and Cody knives)
from the region are a result of Plains Late Paleoindian

(ca. 10,000-9,000 years ago) groups that moved into
parts of Northeast Texas, during periods when grassland habitat spread eastward, to exploit the plains
resources (such as bison) found there.
Archeological data from the Yarbrough site
(41VN6; see Figure 4) were employed by Johnson
(1962) to bring chronological and cultural order to
the diverse Archaic (ca. 6000-200 B.C.) archeological record found in Northeast Texas. Of particular import, were Johnsonâs (1962:208) temporal
divisions of the Archaic based on projectile point
sequences, and the introduction of plain ceramics
at the end of the Archaic. Story (1990:Figure 32)
and Thurmond (1990a:Table 8) provide the most
current chronological classifications of Archaic-age
dart points, with straight and expanding stem forms
characteristic of the Early and Middle Archaic periods and the contracting stem darts particularly diagnostic of the Late Archaic (and much of the Early
Ceramic period as well [Schambach 1982]).
What have we learned about the Archaic populations who lived in Northeast Texas? While the
archeological data are still rather limited, it appears
that group mobility remained high for these hunting-gathering foragers during the Early Archaic,
and group territories were large and poorly defined,

with most sites conforming to what Thurmond
(1990a:41) called "heavy" and "limited-use" areas;
that is, repeated and recurrent occupations by small
groups. By the Middle Archaic in the Sabine and
Cypress drainages, fairly substantial and extensive
occupations are recognized within the major basins, with a rather limited use of smaller tributaries
and headwater areas (see Thurmond [1990a:Figure
9] where Middle Archaic "heavy use" sites occur
along Big and Little Cypress Creek, or on tributaries near their confluence with Big Cypress Creek).
Lithic raw material data from a possible Middle
Archaic assemblage at Lake Fork Reservoir suggests that the exchange of non-local materials (particularly finished tools) was common place (Perttula
1984), although "patterns in raw material use were
not uniform across Northeast Texas" (Fields and
Tornka 1993:92).
Late Archaic sites are widely distributed in the
Pineywoods and Post Oak Savanna, occurring along
the major streams, near springs, on spring-fed
branches, upland ridges, and on tributary drainages
of all sizes (cf. Thurmond 1990a). Some Late
Archaic occupations contain earthen middens (i.e.,
the Yarbrough site along the Sabine River). These
settlement data are compatible with higher

population densities, limited group mobility, the
possible establishment of definable territorial
ranges, and a well-developed foraging economy
based on the hunting and gathering of local food
resources. No paleobotanical evidence is available
that indicates the Late Archaic populations in
Northeast Texas cultivated native plant species (i.e.,
such as sumpweed, sunflower, and chenopod), as
was the case by the first millenium B.C. in many
parts of Eastern North America (Fritz 1994:25-27).
The high use of local lithic raw materials during the
Late Archaic in the Sabine and Cypress basins
speaks to a more confined interregional interaction
at this time (Perttula and Bruseth 1995).
The Early Ceramic period (ca. 200 B.C. to ca.
A.D. 800) in this part of Northeast Texas is recognized primarily by plain and relatively thick ceramic bowls and "flowerpot" shaped jars,
double-bitted axe heads, the smaller and thinner
Gary projectile points, and later in the period by
corner-notched arrowpoints (Thurmond 1990a). In
several instances, as at the Resch and Folly sites

lated ceramics (such as Tchefuncte Stamped,
Churupa Incised, Marksville Incised, Troyville
Stamped, and Marksville Stamped) occur with some
frequency in Early Ceramic period components in
the Sabine River drainage (Story 1990:246). Later
LMV Coles Creek period ceramics (and expanding
stem arrowpoints similar to the Colbert and Friley
types) are present in notable quantities in several
sites along the Sabine River, particularly at James
Pace in a context dated between ca. 1300-1000
years B.P. (Girard 1994). Similar dated contexts in
the Upper Sabine River basin have ceramic assemblages dominated by horizontally incised decorative motifs, and Friley arrowpoints occur in
association (Bruseth and Perttula 1981).
While there is much archeologists do not know
about the Early Ceramic period peoples of Northeast Texas, what has been learned over the last 40
years or so is that they were still primarily huntergatherers who lived in increasingly larger groups
and resided for longer periods of time at certain
sites. These latter sites have relatively substantial
midden deposits, and some evidence for structures
(probably daubed pole and thatch structures), but
the degree of permanence is still less than that seen
in the subsequent long-term Caddo settlement of
Northeast Texas (Perttula, Fields, Corbin, and
Kenmotsu 1993:99).
No Early Ceramic period burial mounds have
been documented in the Pineywoods and Post Oak
Savanna of Northeast Texas, although they have
been found on the Red River in Northwest Louisiana and Southwest Arkansas (Schambach 1982;
Webb 1984), and on the Angelina, Neches, and
Sabine rivers in Deep East Texas (Story 1990). The
two or three mounds at James Pace did not, however, apparently serve as platforms for burials or
structures, or as caps for these features, and their
functional significance is equivocal (Girard
1994:15). The appearance of burial mounds in the
broader region around Northeast Texas does suggest that more complexly organized local groups
did develop during the Early Ceramic period in
these localities.
When we turn to a consideration of the
Formative (ca. A.D. 800-1000), Early (ca. A.D.
1000-1200), and Middle (ca. A.D. 1200-1400)
Caddoan period occupation of the Pineywoods and
Post Oak Savanna of Northeast Texas, there is an
abundance of archeological information to draw
upon. Many an archeologist has been captivated by
the beautifully manufactured ceramics and other

material goods, the earthen mounds, the wellpreserved villages and hamlets, and the existence
of an ethnohistorical record (e.g., Swanton 1942;
Bolton 1987) that has helped to bring to light
behavioral analogs with which to interpret the
archeological story. Consequently, our view of the
lifeways of these prehistoric Caddo groups is much
fuller, and perhaps more behaviorally meaningful,
than has been the case for the Paleoindian, Archaic,
and Early Ceramic regional archeological record.
First of all, Caddo archeological sites of these
ages (Figure 6) are quite common throughout the
Pineywoods and Post Oak Savanna (Thurmond
1990a; Story 1990). They are situated primarily on
elevated landforms (alluvial terraces and rises, natural levees, and upland edges) adjacent to the major

streams, as well as along minor tributaries and
spring-fed branches. Proximity to arable sandy loam
soils were preferred for settlement locations, presumably because of good drainage for habitation,
and for cultivation purposes.
The majority of these Caddo sites are:
permanent settlements that have evidence of
the structures, including posts, pits, and features marking their residency, along with the
cemeteries and graves where the dead were
buried; the middens where the animal and plant
food refuse was discarded amidst broken stone
tools and pottery vessels; and the material remains of tools and ceramics used in the procurement and processing of the bountiful
resources of the region. They represent the
settlements of Caddoan communities and
sociopolitical entities, and the civic-ceremonial
centers that were their focus (Perttula
1993a: 125).

337

eral midden deposits (including a large, possibly
communal trash dump near the south end of the
site) have been identified that appear to be associated with individual structures.
These Formative-Middle Caddoan groups seem
to have been horticulturists, cultivating maize and
squash, along with several kinds of native seeds
(Perttula and Bruseth 1983), as well as proficient
hunters of deer, fish, and many other animal species. The available paleobotanical and
bioarcheological evidence from Northeast Texas
(and elsewhere in the Caddoan area) does not indicate, however, that Caddoan groups became dependent upon maize and other domesticated crops until
about A.D. 1300; by ca. A.D. 1450, maize comprised more than 50 percent of the diet (see Rose et
al. 1995; Burnett 1990).
Both temple and burial mounds were built by
these Pineywoods and Post Oak Savanna Caddoan
groups. The larger sites are important civicceremonial centers containing multiple mounds
(Figure 8) and associated villages. The multiple
mound centers are rather evenly spaced along both
the Sabine River and Cypress Bayou, and those that
are contemporaneous may represent hierarchical
systems of an "integrated...regional network of
interaction and redistribution" (Thurmond
1990a:234). Perttula (1994:12) identifies the
Jamestown (8 mounds and village), Boxed Springs
(4 mounds, village, and large cemetery), and

The distribution of Caddoan settlements across the
landscape suggests that all habitats were used, either by the sedentary communities and farmsteads,
or by logistical camps where specific natural resources could be procured by the Caddo in bulk.
The most common types of Caddoan settlements appear to be small hamlets and farmsteads
(Perttula et al. 1986; Thurmond 1990a), but larger
communities have been recognized
that occur in association with
mound centers (such as the large
settlements at Hale (41TT12) and
Hudnall-Pirtle [Bruseth !991]).

Thurmond (1985:191) has argued that the Titus
phase spatial groups denote socio-politically
integrated separate tribes or subtribes similar to the
confederacies known historically among the Hasinai
or the Red River Kadohadacho groups. Thus, the
larger Cypress Cluster is:

lengthy Archaic period (6000 B.C. to A.D. 0),
followed by a decrease in the Early Ceramic period
(A.D. 0-800), and then a substantial increase in the
Early and Middle Caddoan periods (Bruseth 1987;
Thurmond 1990a). The highest number and density
of components occurs during the Late Caddoan
period (Table 1).
Studies in the Lake Fork Creek basin (Bruseth
and Perttula 1981; Bruseth 1987; Perttula et al.
1993a), and recent investigations in portions of the
Big Sandy Creek (Perttula et al. 1986) and Little
Cypress Creek basins (Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. 1993, 1995; Glander et al. 1993), as well
as at Caddo Lake (Cliff and Peter 1994:141), are
similar to Thurmondâs overall results for the Cypress Creek Basin in confirming the high frequency
of Late Caddoan occupations. Clearly, regional
Caddoan populations were extensive throughout
much of the Pineywoods after ca. A.D. 1350.

Settlement Configuration

Late Caddoan period settlements in the
Pineywoods of Northeast Texas have been termed
rural Caddoan community systems (Perttula
1992a:96) because they were distributed along

secondary streams, were widely dispersed, and
because they consisted of functionally equivalent
farmsteads and hamlets. Similar kinds of rural
communities occur throughout much of the Caddoan
area (Story 1982, 1990; Jeter et al. 1989).

Perttula ~ The Archeology of the Pineywoods and Post Oak Savanna of Northeast Texas

Small mound centers were being constructed
and used up to ca. A.D. 1500 in Northeast Texas,
but they lack evidence of burial mounds or large
platforms; rather, they contained mounds that buried burned structures. The larger Caddoan "towns"
were distributed along the major stream valleys,
such as the Red, Ouachita, and Little rivers. These
communities were hierarchically arranged with:
civic-ceremonial centers (those with platform and
burial mounds), associated "towns" of linear but
dispersed farmstead compounds with several structures, bark- or brush-covered shelters and storage
platforms (Schambach 1983:7-8), hamlets, farmsteads, and specialized processing and/or procurement locales (such as salt-making sites [Emâly 1994])
(see also Gregory 1980:356-357).
Thurmond (1990a) recognizes three types of
Titus phase settlements: limited use areas, slnall
settlements, and large settlements. The limited use
areas were seasonally occupied locations where extractive/processing activities took place, while the
settlements were year-round habitations. Small
settlements (ranging between 0.2-1.8 ha in size,
with midden accumulations, and wattle-daub concentrations) account for 73 percent of the known
Titus phase settlements in the Cypress Creek basin,
the limited use areas 23 percent, and the large settlements (those larger than 1.8 ha, and with midden
accumulations as well as wattle-daub concentrations) only 4 percent of the sample.
The settlements appear to have been composed
of one to several family units, with house middens/
daub concentrations and trash midden mounds (Figure 13). The range of domestic materials recovered
in the midden mounds (e.g., Perttula et al. 1993a),
along with limited evidence of structure rebuilding,
suggests that most Titus phase settlements were
occupied only about a generation, when the settlement was moved to another area where farming
was possible. Small family cemeteries typically occurred nearby (Bruseth 1987; Perttula et al. 1993a;
Thurmond 1990a).
Analyses of the spatial distribution of cultural
materials at the small settlement at the Burks site
(41WD52), a Three Basins subcluster component,
indicates that the disposal of broken pottery vessels, tools, and animal bones, was quite patterned
across the site itself (Perttula et al. n.d.). Midden
mounds up to one meter in height were common on
Titus phase settlements before they began to be
plowed in historic times. Excavations at Late
Caddoan Pineywoods settlements also suggest that

343

many activities occurred outside the houses, resulting in trash-filled pits, hearths, and posts in these
areas, where ramadas and granaries may also have
been present, along with concentrations of artifacts
and debris (Bruseth and Perttula 1981; Thurmond
1990a; Woodall 1969).
Because of the intense professional and
avocational focus on the cemeteries that occur on
Titus phase settlements, few specifics are available
on the types of houses and storage structures used
by these groups. Based on a few excavated Late
Caddoan structures in the Pineywoods (some of
which were in mounds and may thus not be at all
characteristic of domestic structures), the single
pole structures were probably circular in shape,
were thatched and wattled, measured between five
and six meters in diameter (Figure 14), and may
have had, on occasion, extended entranceways
(Thurmond 1990a:144, 146, 148, 168, 210-211;
Clark and Ivey 1974). Structures had central
hearths and centerposts, possible interior benches
and racks for sleeping and above-ground storage
purposes, as well as storage and trash pits.
Structures had some midden accumulation on their
floors (i.e., house middens), which were not

daily trash and refuse was deposited on the nearby
trash midden mound.
When Pedro Vial visited the Nadaco Caddo
"village" near the Sabine River in 1788 (probably
in the vicinity of Longview and Marshall, Texas),
he described it as having thirteen to fifteen houses
scattered over a distance of three leagues (about 8
miles) (Nasatir and Loomis 1967:344-345). The
houses or ranchos of the Nadaco were evidently
distributed mainly along tributaries of the Sabine
River (Jones 1968; Perttula t992a:177). The distribution of Titus phase settlements indicates an
equal dispersion of agricultural farmsteads and
hamlets in prehistoric times, usually being found
near springs, arable soil, and level ground, but also
preferring settings along tributary streams.

Localities and their Character
The best information on the distribution of
Titus phase settlements in the Pineywoods comes

from Thurmondâs (1990a) study of the archeology
of the Cypress Creek Basin. Titus phase sites tend
to occur on valley terraces, upland projections, and
upland slope landforms, with the greatest use of
minor (2-10 square kilometers) and upland basins.
Fifty-four percent of all Titus phase components
(including farmsteads, hamlets, villages, cemeteries, and a small number of extractive/processing
sites) occur in the uplands. Given that the majority
of archeological survey efforts in the Cypress Creek
Basin have concentrated on major streams, and
stream valleys in general, "...the frequent occurrence of sites along smaller streams is indicated.
One suspects that the occurrence of sites in upland
areas may be higher than the present data would
indicate" (Thurmond 1990a:220).
The permanent settlements and cemeteries of
the Titus phase tend to occur in association with
freshwater springs (Thurmond 1990a:Table 58 and
Figure 33). Known Late Caddoan mound centers,
how-ever, typically do not occur in proximity to a
spring, but rather are on the floodplain floor in

Late Caddoan mounds and settlements in part of
the Middle Sabine river basin (Perttula 1989,
1994:Figure 9).

Cemeteries
There are two types of cemeteries used by the

Mound-building in the Late Caddoan period in
Titus phase groups: the small family cemetery, and
the Pineywoods appears to have ceased
between roughly A.D. 1400 and 1500

1993a). Only a small number of Late
Caddoan period mounds are known in
the region (Figure 15), ranging from

with the Titus phase in that burial pits in the mound included Ripley Engraved, Hodges Engraved, Glassell Engraved, Cass
Appliqued, Pease Brushed-Incised, and Karuack Brushed-Incised ceramics as well as Perdiz and Bassett arrowpoints. Based on
the limited information available, the burial pits were placed in the mound between A.D. 1350-1450 (cf. Perttula 1992a:Appendix
A-1). The regional significance and sociopolitical relationships of this middle Sabine River Caddoan occupation remain to be
clearly elucidated.

are extremely rare. The occurrence of
graves containing very large numbers
of artifacts is also quite limited.

The large community cemeteries of the
Titus phase (Figure 17) are the product of
interments from a number of communities
in the vicinity, and thus they are reflective
of a wider community-based participation
in ceremonial and mortuary activities (Story
1990:338-339). These cemeteries usually
contain at least 40 individuals, but some are
known that contained at least 150-300 indiHARROUN SITE-A1 URIO

The community cemeteries contain excellent evidence for the existence of social
differentiation within the Titus phase (see
below). Since community cemeteries are

mestic and mortuary contexts. The
wide variety of vessel shapes and
decorations, as well as their frequency in domestic contexts, demonstrates the importance of ceramics
in the Titus phase for the cooking
and serving of food, as personal possessions, and as social identifiers.
Both fine wares and utility wares

phase. Differences in paste (and
decoration) between the two wares

vessel shapes. The presence of carbon encmstations,
food residues, and sooting on many of the utility
vessels indicate that these pots were used for
cooking (e.g., Skibo 1992); the large orifice
diamaters and vessel volumes also suggests that
some utility vessels were used primarily for storage
of foodstuffs and liquids.
The types of decorations and/or surface
treatment on the utility vessels included neck-

banding or corrugation, brushing, applique, incision,
punctation, or various combinations thereof (Turner
1995:Table 1). Small handles or lugs were present
on some of the utility vessels. Based on sherd
samples from domestic contexts, utility vessels
probably comprised between 50 to 70 percent of
the ceramic assemblages in Titus phase sites, with
proportionally fewer utility vessels in mortuary
contexts (Thurmond 1990a).

Perttula ~ The Archeology of the Pineywoods and Post Oak Savanna of Northeast Texas

Other ceramic artifacts manufactured by Late
Caddoan Pineywoods groups include ceramic
earspools, as well as biconical and elbow pipes (see
Jackson 1933). Other types of earspools include
ones manufactured from siltstone and sandstone, as
well as ones of wood (Turner 1992:84). One set of
earspools from the Tuck Carpenter site had been
covered with copper plate. The elbow pipes are
commonly decorated with engraved lines that have
been painted with hematite or kaolin clay.
Generally speaking, lithic tools and debris are
uncommon on Late Caddoan period sites in the
Pineywoods, and presumably this reflects the strong
development of wood and bone tool industries, few
examples of which are preserved in the archeological record. The tool diversity is low, consisting
primarily of triangular and corner-notched
arrowpoints, flake tools (drills, scrapers, and retouched pieces), lithic debris and cores, along with
an array of groundstone implements. These include
petaloid and tabular celts, metates and manos, battered and polished cobbles and pebbles, hematite
and limonite pigment stones, and abrading slabs
(Turner 1992; Thurmond 1990a).
Although bone is not usually well-preserved
on Titus phase sites, bone tools have been recognized at a number of sites. They include deer mandibles, deer beamers, ulna punches, antler tines,
and deer and bird bone pins. Turtle carapace rattles
have also been noted.

Social status and activity variation
The social status ranking apparent in the Cypress Cluster burials is based on four criteria seen
in the archeological record:
(1) high-status burials include large shaft tombs
and multiple interments; all other Titus phase
burials are single, individual burials. Family
cemeteries do not contain shaft tombs or
multiple interments;

(2) quantities of grave goods are significantly
higher than the mean average for the regional
burial population as a whole (approximately
14-15 grave goods per burial [Perttula
!992a:Table 7]). Higher status burials differ
from the population primarily in the
frequency of arrowpoints and ceramic vessels

placed as grave
1992a:Table 8);

(3)

offerings

349

(Perttula

certain types of artifacts are found in higher
status burials. One such example in the Cypress and Upper Sabine basins is the Galt
biface (Thurmond 1990a:235); and

(4) they are always adult males.
There are about 10 to 15 Titus phase sites in
the Pineywoods that have burials of presumed highstatus individuals, such as Galt, Caldwell, Lower
Peach Orchard, Tuck Carpenter, H. R. Taylor, and
others (see Perttula 1992a:Table 8);4 all those known
are along Cypress Bayou and its tributaries (see
Figure 12). Certainly the best-known and studied
community cemeteries with high-status burials are
the Tuck Carpenter (Turner 1978, 1992) and H. R.
Taylor (Thurmond 1990a) sites.
At Tuck Carpenter, high-status burials dating
between ca. A.D. 1350-1550 are at the center of the
70-interment cemetery, while the latest high-status
burials (estimated to date after ca. A.D. 1550 to the
early 1600s) are alongside the outside cemetery
boundaries (see Perttula 1992a:Figure 18; Turner
1978). With the exception of the two multiple interments, other single, extended interments were
placed in the cemetery in roughly aligned northsouth rows. The high-status burials contained on
average of 37 grave goods/burial, compared to the
14.8 grave goods/burial for the cemetery as a whole
(Turner 1978, 1992).
The same type of burial program noted at the
Tuck Carpenter site was in use at the H. R. Taylor
site (see Perttula 1992a:Figure 19). Mean values of
ceramic vessels (8.3/individual), arrowpoints (5.09/
individual), and total number of specimens (14.5/
individual) as grave goods at H. R. Taylor are not
significantly different from other Titus phase cemeteries, but the high-status burials each contained
on the average between 27-55 grave goods (Perttula
1992a:Table 7; Thurmond 1990a).
The segregation of interments by presumed
status indicates that high-status individuals account
for 8 to 9 percent of the burials at H. R. Taylor and
Tuck Carpenter, respectively. Low-status
interments, namely those with quantities of grave
goods two standard deviations below the mean
average for the two sites (between 0 to 9.0 items at
Tuck Carpenter and 0 to 6.7 items at H. R. Taylor),

4This does not include several community cemetery sites in the Lake Oâ the Pines area that still remain poorly documented.

350

account for 19 and 23 percent of the burials at the
two sites. Lower-status individuals at these
community cemeteries were usually adult females,
juveniles, or children. Overall, in the Titus phase
mortuary populations, high-status individuals
account for less than 2 percent of all known burials
(Thurmond 1990a:235).
A perusal of Perttula (1992a:Table 8) indicates that the majority of burials of presumed highstatus in the Pineywoods date after ca. A.D.
1550-1600. Those individuals buried prior to A.D.
1550 demonstrate considerable intraregional variability in the manner of burial treatment, as well as
in the types of artifactual remains placed in the
burials as offerings. For example, in addition to the
multiple interments at Tuck Carpenter, shaft tombss
are represented in a pre-A.D. 1550 cemetery at the
Lower Peach Orchard site (see Figure 12). At the J.
E. Gait site, the high-status burial included such
offerings as a large number of celt fragments and
other native stone implements, rather than caches
of arrowpoints (Thurmond 1990a:Table 29). Galt
bifaces were also recovered from the cemetery.
The large Titus phase cemeteries with individuals of high-status are distributed within each of
the four spatial subclusters identified by Thurmond
(1985, 1990a) in the Cypress Creek basin. The earliest appearance of this type of community integration occurs in the Tankersley Creek, Three Basins,
and Swauano Creek subclusters, with the latest being present in the Swauano Creek and Big Cypress
Creek subclusters (see Figure 12). No post-A.D.
1550-1600 community cemeteries are known in the
Three Basins and Tankersley Creek subclusters,
with the exception of Tuck Carpenter, which suggests that much of these areas were abandoned by
resident Caddoan groups about this time.
In general, these community cemeteries are
relatively short-term mortuary phenomena that were
used intensively in portions of the Pineywoods after about A.D. 1550 to the early 1600s. It is probably no coincidence that the intensive use of
community cemeteries in the region occurs generally contemporaneously with the initial contact between Titus phase Caddoan populations and the
Spanish De Soto/Moscoso entrada of 1542-1543.

Indeed, Bruseth (1992:91) interprets the short-term
use of these cemeteries as reflecting the passage of
the army as well as increased mortality from European diseases. The timing in the intensification of
this form of community cemetery in the region is
also of considerable significance because the Titus
phase community cemeteries appear to have replaced the use of mounds for community ceremonial and religious functions by the 1550s. I have
argued that this process of replacement is a reflection of changes in social complexity and the scope
of community integration, perhaps accompanied by
a spatial coalescence and/or decrease in settlement
density within the Pineywoods (Perttula 1992a: 115).
Subsistence Studies
Titus phase subsistence remains with interpretive significance are rather limited to date to a few
sites in the upper Sabine and upper Cypress basins,
rather at the western edge of its settlement distribution (Perttula 1993a). However, well-preserved
subsistence remains are known from a number of
other sites of this age in Northeast Texas that have
as yet received little professional attention (Perttula
1993b; Thurmond 1990a). Floral evidence from
trash midden deposits suggests that the tropical
cultigen maize (Zea mays L.) was a dietary staple,
and beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) were also an important food source. Nuts and seeds were also gathered, but they appear to have been of lesser
importance in the Titus phase than they were between ca. A.D. 900-1400 (Crane 1982; Perttula and
Bruseth 1983; Perttula et al. 1982). In fact, the
subsistence evidence from the Titus phase in the
Pineywoods, as well as elsewhere in the Caddoan
area, suggests the successful development of an
Caddoan maize-based economy at this time (Fritz
1990:421,425).
Vertebrate species identified in Titus phase
trash middens include deer, turkey, cottontail rabbit, jackrabbit, squirrel, and beaver. Turtle and fish
were also present, but were relatively uncommon
compared to mammals and birds. Deer and turkey
appear to have been the dominant exploitable species (Perttula et al. 1982, 1993a).

5Shaft tombs are reported at several other large cemeteries on Cypress Bayou, but their context and grave contents have not
been fully assessed. One shaft tomb at the Pleasure Point site was reported to have been about three meters deep and contained
two episodes of multiple burial interments (Mike Turner, 1993 personal communication). At the Lower Peach Orchard site, five
or six shaft tombs were excavated by collectors from a large community cemetery. The one shaft tomb where information is
available contained three individuals and large quantities of grave goods (see Thurmond 1990a).

Perttula ~ The Archeology of the Pineywoods and Post Oak Savanna of Northeast Texas

The examination of bioarcheological remains
lends some additional light to the subsistence character of the Titus phase populations, but to date the
results have not been substantial. This is because of
the relatively small samples of human remains that
have been analyzed from Pineywoods Late Caddo
sites (Burnett 1990:402-408). Based on admittedly
limited bioarcheological evidence, principally the
low frequency of dental caries and porotic
hyperostosis, Burnett (1990:405,408) suggests that
the Late Caddoan inhabitants of the Cypress/upper
Sabine and the middle Sabine consumed little to no
maize, and "were not dependent upon a maize-rich
diet." The lack of infections, such as osteoarthritis
and osteoporosis, in the Late Caddoan samples,
while again rather small, may indicate both a different lifestyle and workload than Caddoan residents on the Red River, as well as a high measure
of adaptive success (Burnett 1990:404). It is important for current Pineywoods Caddo research to resolve the question of why there is this substantial
contradiction between the archeological and
bioarcheological evidence regarding the nature of
Titus phase subsistence.

351

An analysis of the grave good associations in a
large sample of Whelan and Titus phase burials
indicates that a modicum of interaction occurred
between the Pineywoods groups and Caddoan populations to the north between A.D. 1350-1450, and
this increased during the Titus phase proper. Glassell
Engraved is a significant item of ceramic trade after 1450, with interaction to the north and east
seemingly intensifying after about the middle 1500s.
In fact, between 3.2-7.6 percent of ceramic vessels
in Titus phase burials are Red River trade wares
(Perttula 1992a:249).
Significant quantities of non-local lithic raw
materials are also present in Titus phase assemblages. Detailed examination of lithic raw materials in Three Basins subcluster components in the
Sabine River basin indicates that Red River gravel
cherts and chalcedonies comprised about 20 percent of the lithic tools and debris (Perttula 1984).
These lithic raw materials were available from Red
River Caddoan groups who lived in the vicinity of
the McCurtain phase Arnold Roitsch (41RR16)
civic-ceremonial center (see Figure 10). Hatton tuff
and siliceous shales were obtained from the
Ouachita Mountains for the manufacture of celts.

REGIONAL RELATIONSHIPS
External Relationships
Although many of the details are sketchy, mortuary goods and other exotic artifacts (such as conch
shell, lithic raw materials, etc.) suggest that
intraregional contacts and the exchange of resources
between rural and town Caddoan communities flourished at the time of initial European contact in the
sixteenth century. Interregional exchange and contact was also well developed between Caddoan polities, and horticulturists living in the southwestern
United States, the Southern Plains, and the Lower
Mississippi Valley (see Baugh !995; Kidder 1995).

Among Caddoan Groups

Ceramic wares imported from the Red River
Caddoan groups are present in the Titus phase.
They include such fine wares as Belcher Ridged,
Belcher Engraved, Glassell Engraved, and Hodges
Engraved from the Belcher phase to the east (Webb
1959:153), and Avery Engraved and Simms Engraved pottery types of the McCurtain and
Texarkana phases to the north some 100 km (see
Bruseth 1995).

In one study of the lithic raw materials present
in Three Basins subcluster sites (Perttula t984),
Edwards chert from Central Texas (Banks 1990)
represented about 8 percent of the lithic tools and
debris. This material had to have been obtained by
Caddoan peoples through trade and exchange with
non-Caddoan peoples living more than 150 km to
the west and southwest of the Pineywoods Caddo.
Galt bifaces, possible "badges of rank or ofrice" (Thurmond 1990a:35), found with high-status
Titus and Belcher phase burials, are made from
"non-local high grade cherts." Documentation of
several Galt bifaces from the Pleasure Point
(41MR63) community cemetery on Big Cypress
Bayou indicate that they were also manufactured
from a dark-brown Edwards chert (Mike Turner,
1993 personal communication).
The presence of Nortefio phase ceramics
(Womack Engraved) from Titus phase sites in the
Three Basins subcluster suggests that the Nortefios
(or Wichita-speaking groups who moved into
Texas) interacted to some extent with the
Pineywoods Caddo. Neither sites with Nortefio

352

Texas Archeological Society

ceramics contained European trade goods (e.g.,
Scurlock 1962), though, and the period when there
was Nortefio and Titus phase contact can only be
suggested to have occurred in perhaps the early to
late seventeenth century.
Gulf Coast conch shell was obtained by the
Pineywoods Late Caddo for the manufacture of
conch columella beads and pendants. This exotic
material is rarely used in the Titus phase (Turner
1978), however, compared to that seen among the
Red River Belcher and McCurtain phase Caddo
groups (Webb 1959; Skinner et al. 1969; Trubowitz
1984; Kelley 1994).

DIACHRONIC PERSPECTIVES
The demise of the Titus phase
A reconsideration of Titus phase chronologies,
in combination with new assessments of the route
of the de Soto-Moscoso 1542-1543 entrada through
Northeast Texas (Bruseth 1992; Hudson 1990;
Kenmotsu et al. 1993; Schambach 1989; Thurmond
1990b), suggests that: (a) the Spanish entrada encountered the Titus phase peoples-- probably the
Lacane province--and (b) that within 50-60 years
of that encounter the area occupied by the Titus
phase had been virtually abandoned. While it is
likely that some Titus phase peoples moved to either the Red River among the Kadohadacho, or to
the Hasinai Caddo south of the Sabine River, current explanations for the demise of the Titus phase
hinge on the introduction and initial exposure of
Caddoan groups to European epidemic diseases
(Thurmond 1990a:233, 1990b; Perttula 1992a),
which led to substantial depopulation among the
Pineywoods populations.
Subsequent to the discontinuation of
community cemeteries in the early to midseventeenth century, most of the upper Sabine and
Cypress Creek basins were abandoned (Thurmond
1990b; Perttula 1992a). The only post-1700
Caddoan occupations that can be related to earlier
use of the Pineywoods are to be found in the lower
Sulphur and Sabine rivers (Figure 19a) at known
trade portages or along trail crossings of these major
streams (Harris et al. 1980; Jones 1968; Perttula
1992a: 172-177). None of the Caddoan communities
in the Cypress Creek/upper Sabine basins appear to
have been ethnographically described, and what is

known from ethnographic and archival documents
pertains principally to the Nadaco or Anadarko
Caddo (Figure 19b). This groupâs prehistoric
antecedents are poorly known, and they appear to
have only settled in the Sabine River basin after ca.
1770 (Smith 1995:74).
Late Caddoan period Pineywoods sites such as
those of the Titus phase hold great promise to document the nature of sociopolitical, demographic, and
economic changes in the region during an eventful
time in Caddoan prehistory and protohistory. This
is due in large part to their potential for fine-scale
chronological control, say on the order of 20-30
years. As other studies of Caddoan archeology make
clear, there have been substantial changes in
Caddoan societies from ca. A.D. 800 to European
contact (cf. Story t990; Jeter et al. 1989), with one
of the more important being the development of
more egalitarian sociopolitical systems after ca.
A.D. 1400 in many regions of the Caddoan area,
including the Pineywoods of Northeast Texas
(Perttula 1995).
The intensification of maize-based economies
after ca. A.D. 1400 in much of the Caddoan area
may be in large part responsible for the demise of
many of the civic-ceremonial centers at a time
when there was a reorganization of social and political relationships within Caddoan culture on a
regional level. The tangible development of predictable maize surpluses at all levels, the "quality
of abundance" referred to by Helms (1992:188),
would have led to the social homogeneity noted
above among Late Caddoan groups in the
Pineywoods because household agricultural sufficiency negated the regionally expansive role of the
elite-controlled social and political economy. After this time, therefore, social and political integration appears to have been regionally and locally
redefined.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
Since the 1950s, a great deal has been learned
by a dedicated group of avocational and professional archeologists about the prehistory of this part
of Northeast Texas, particularly regarding the last
1000-2000 years when the ancestors of the Caddo
Tribe of Oklahoma settled in the area and thrived
(Carter 1995; Smith 1995). The knowledge gained
about the Native American past in the region, about

the challenges faced during times of cultural change,
and during the wrenching episode (still ongoing) of
contact and interaction between the Caddo peoples
and European and Anglo-American colonizers and
settlers, helps to bring "native history" to the forefront, not a footnote, of the ongoing study of Texasâ
cultural heritage.
While there is every reason to think that our
knowledge of Northeast Texas prehistory will continue to grow by leaps and bounds, there are tremendous research and preservation challenges
ahead. On a mundane level, it is important that we
continually cast a critical and discerning eye at our
research priorities, the value of our methodological
approaches, and the worth of our cultural resource
management planning documents. From the innovative use of these tools come the new perspectives
and conceptions that lead to broader and
parsiminious understandings of the past.

Changes in research strategies are critical, but
in Northeast Texas they are only, unfortunately,
part of the archeological story. Of the utmost concern for the long-term protection and preservation
of the regionâs archeological heritage is dealing
straight on with the unabated looting and vandalism of prehistoric Caddo villages and cemeteries-on private as well as state and federal lands. The
archeological landscape is pitted and pocked with
the looterâs holes and backdirt piles. Many of the
most important archeological sites in the region
have been irretrievably damaged and destroyed, and
it is questionable that the looting frenzy can be
staunched even if an unmarked burial protection
bill was to be made law in Texas. The cultural
patrimony of the Caddo peoples is being taken from
them, with almost no hand being lifted to help
protect these significant cultural treasures. This is
our greatest challenge in the years ahead: to find a

354

way, in concert with the Caddo people, to protect
and preserve this cultural legacy:
In 1541 when the Spaniards arrived, every place
in the Caddo country had, of course, a Caddo
name but almost all of those names are gone
now, like the people who bestowed them
(Schambach 1993:7).

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I would like to especially thank Bo Nelson and
