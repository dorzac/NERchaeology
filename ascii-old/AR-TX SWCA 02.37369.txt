Cultural Resources Survey for the Proposed M124 Channel Improvement and Detention Basin Project

ABSTRACT
On behalf of Costello, Inc., and the Harris County Toll Road Authority (HCTRA), SWCA Environmental
Consultants (SWCA) conducted a cultural resources survey for the proposed M124 Channel Improvement
and Detention Basin project. HCTRA proposes to channel from the existing Texas Department of
Transportation (TxDOT) detention ponds adjacent to State Highway 249, south and west for approximately
2 miles to Willow Creek, crossing Farm to Market (FM) 2920, and to create two new detention ponds south
of FM 2920, encompassing approximately 235.52 acres in total. For the purposes of this report, this 226.52acre area is considered the direct area of potential effect (APE); however, SWCA anticipates that the actual
construction footprint will be a reduced area. The indirect APE included a 1300-foot buffer beyond the
boundary of the direct APE.
Investigations were conducted pursuant to the acquisition of a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)
Section 404 permit in accordance with 33 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 325, Appendix C
(Processing Department of Army Permits: Procedures for the Protection of Historic Properties; Final Rule
1990; with current Interim Guidance Documents dated April 25, 2005 and January 31, 2007); Section 106
of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) (16 United States Code [USC] 470) and its implementing
regulations 36 CFR 800; and the Texas Historical Commission (THC) minimum archaeological survey
standards for such projects. As portions of the project location are owned by a political subdivision of the
State of Texas, work was additionally conducted in compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas
Natural Resource Code, Title 9, Chapter 191) and accompanying Rules of Practice and Procedure (Texas
Administrative Code, Title 13, Chapter 26) under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7902.
The background literature review revealed that a single cultural resources survey had been conducted within
the direct and indirect APE. No cultural resources have been previously recorded within or immediately
adjacent to the direct or indirect APE.
During the archaeological investigation, SWCA identified a single cultural resource (Isolated Find 1) within
the direct APE. Isolated Find 1 is a single positive shovel test containing historic debris, likely associated
with a mid-twentieth-century oil/gas well pad. The find was considered insufficient to constitute a site and
a trinomial will not be requested. Isolated Find 1 is recommended NOT ELIGIBLE for the National Register
of Historic Places (NRHP) or for designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL).
An historic resources reconnaissance survey was also conducted in order to identify the presence of eligible
historic standing structures or properties. No aboveground historic structures or buildings are located within
the direct APE. Six resources (Resource IDs 1-6) were identified as being of historic age within the survey
APE; however, each is recommended NOT ELIGIBLE for the NRHP or SAL due to loss of integrity of
design, materials, setting, and/or workmanship.
SWCA conducted a non-collection survey; therefore, no cultural materials will be curated. Original survey
documentation will be curated with the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin, Texas, in
fulfillment of requirements for Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7902.
In accordance with Section 106 of the NHPA 36 CFR 800.4 (b)(1) and the Antiquities Code of Texas,
SWCA has made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify significant cultural resources within the
APE. No historic properties listed or otherwise eligible for the NRHP, or for designation as a SAL, were
identified within the direct or indirect APE. As such, SWCA recommends no further cultural resources
investigation and a finding of NO HISTORIC PROPERTIES AFFECTED per 36 CFR 800.4(d)(1) and
further recommends that the project be allowed to proceed.

Cultural Resources Survey for the Proposed M124 Channel Improvement and Detention Basin Project

INTRODUCTION
On behalf of Costello, Inc., and the Harris County Toll Road Authority (HCTRA), SWCA Environmental
Consultants (SWCA) conducted a cultural resources investigation for the proposed M124 Channel
Improvement and Detention Basin project. Channel improvements are required for additional flood control
storage because of the development of State Highway 249 and future developments to Farm-to-Market
(FM) 2920.
Investigations were conducted pursuant to the acquisition of a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)
Section 404 permit in accordance with 33 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 325, Appendix C
(Processing Department of Army Permits: Procedures for the Protection of Historic Properties; Final Rule
1990; with current Interim Guidance Documents dated April 25, 2005 and January 31, 2007); Section 106
of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) (16 United States Code [USC] 470) and its implementing
regulations 36 CFR 800, and the Texas Historical Commission (THC) minimum archaeological survey
standards for such projects. As portions of the project area are owned by a political subdivision of the State
of Texas, work was additionally conducted in compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas
Natural Resource Code, Title 9, Chapter 191) and accompanying Rules of Practice and Procedure (Texas
Administrative Code, Title 13, Chapter 26) under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7902.
A background research and literature review was completed for the project and surrounding area.
Additionally, SWCA archaeologists conducted an intensive archaeological survey and an SWCA
architectural historian conducted an historic resources reconnaissance survey in order to identify the
presence of eligible historic standing structures or properties.
Todd L. Butler served as Principal Investigator for the project. The report was prepared by archaeologists
Todd B. McLeod and Susan E. Butler, and architectural historian Hannah Curry-Shearouse. Todd McLeod,
Steve Cummins, and Jordan Daem conducted the field component of the archaeological survey and Hannah
Curry-Shearouse and Yasmin Arslan conducted the historic resources survey. Geographic information
systems (GIS) support was provided and report graphics were prepared by GIS Specialists Jeff Stein, Lolita
Guarin, and Colleen Kennedy. The report was edited by Joy Hengst.

Project Description
The proposed M124 Channel Improvement and Detention Basin project is bordered by State Highway 249
on the northeast side, and extends in a general southwesterly direction to a location approximately 1,500
feet north of Humble Road in northwestern Harris County, Texas. HCTRA proposes to channel from the
existing Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) detention ponds south and west for approximately
2 miles to Willow Creek, crossing FM 2920 and to create two new detention pond locations, approximately
235.52 acres in total.
For the purposes of this report, this 235.52-acre area is considered the direct area of potential effect (APE);
however, SWCA anticipates that the actual construction footprint will be a reduced area. The indirect APE
included a 1300-foot buffer beyond the boundary of the direct APE per historic resource survey guidelines
from TxDOT in order to comply with the NRHP and Antiquities Code of Texas requirements for similar
projects. The survey APE used for the historic resources survey also includes every parcel wholly or
partially encompassed by the indirect APE. At this time, the depth of project impacts for the detention
ponds and channelization is unknown. The project is illustrated on the Rose Hill, Texas, U.S. Geological
Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute topographic map (Figure 1).

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Physiographic Region
The project is located in northern Harris County on the edge of two ecotones, the coastal plains of the
Northern Humid Gulf Coastal Prairies to the south, and the Flatwoods ecotone to the north (Griffith et al.
2007). The Northern Humid Coastal Prairies are gently sloping and relatively flat. Soils are typically wet
because of poor drainage that results from clay subsoils and low relief. The Flatwoods are acidic, clayey,
and generally wet.

Geology
Geologically, the project is located on the Lissie Formation. The Pleistocene Lissie formation contains clay,
silt, sand, and a very minor amount of small siliceous gravels (Barnes 1982). It is locally calcareous, with
concretions of calcium carbonate, iron oxide, and iron-manganese oxides (Barnes 1982). The surface is
fairly flat and featureless except for numerous rounded shallow depressions and pimple mounds (Barnes
1982).

Houston PALM
The Houston Potential Archaeological Liability Map (PALM) was developed for the Houston area by
TxDOT and provides an assessment of geoarchaeological potential (Abbott 2001). The Houston PALM
lists the probability for a named soil to contain buried archaeological deposits. Further guidelines regarding
the recommended âlevel of effortâ for archaeological surveys within the Houston area are provided
according to Map Unit (Abbott 2001).
According to the Houston PALM, the project is located within Map Units 2, 2a, and 4. Briefly, Map Unit
2 describes thin Holocene-age veneer deposits overlaying older Pleistocene age formations. Surface survey
with shovel testing is recommended for Map Unit 2; however, no deep testing is recommended within Map
Unit 2 (Abbott 2001:156). Map Unit 2a contains areas where pimple mounds appear to be preserved on the
uplands; survey should be limited to mounds (Abbott 2001:156). Abbott (2001:156) recommends no survey
in Map Unit 4, as it is characterized by stable or erosional Pleistocene landforms, Pleistocene landforms in
urban contexts, areas underlain by historic age deposits, and (man) made land.

Soils
According to the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Web Soil Survey (NRCS 2016), soils
map units within the direct APE consist of Gessner fine sandy loam (0 to 1 percent slopes, ponded), Hockley
loamy fine sand (1 to 3 percent slopes), Kenney loamy fine sand (0 to 2 percent slopes), and Wockley fine
sandy loam (0 to 1 percent slopes). Abbott (2001:21-23) indicates that the Hockley, Kenney, and Wockley
series have low geoarchaeological potential and that the Gessner series has a low-moderate
geoarchaeological potential. The vast majority of soils in the APE are Wockley fine sandy loam. Soils in
the vicinity of the project are illustrated in Figure 2, and individual soils within the direct APE are detailed
in Table 1.

Flora and Fauna
The modern vegetative communities differ slightly from past biotic communities (Griffith et al. 2007).
Vegetation in the area once consisted of piney forests dominated by longleaf pine (Pinus palustris)
intermixed with white oak (Quercus alba), southern red oak (Quercus falcata), willow oak (Quercus
phellos), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica), and hollies (Ilex spp.) (Griffith
et al. 2007:92). Pine wetlands included sweetbay (Magnolia virginiana) and wax myrtle (Morella cerifera).
Today, the Flatwoods ecological province is dominated by loblolly (Pinus taeda) and shortleaf (Pinus
echinata) pine plantations.
The project is located in the southern Austroriparian biotic province as defined by Blair (1950). The western
border of the Austroriparian biotic province is largely based on the expansion of pine and hardwood forests.
As such, the expansion of this timber and the Austroriparian province fluctuates with the amount of rainfall
(Blair 1950).
The province has a high faunal diversity. Blair (1950) identified at least 47 species of mammals, 41 species
of reptiles, and 35 species of amphibians native to the region. Blair (1950) defines the following mammals
as common within the Austroriparian province: white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), muskrat
(Ondatra zibethicus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), coyote (Canis latrans), opossum (Didelphis virginiana),
eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus), eastern pipistrelle bat (Pipistrellus subflavus), red bat (Lasiurus
carolinensis), fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), southern flying squirrel
(Glaucomys volans), gopher (Geomys breviceps), fulvous harvest mouse (Reithrodonomys fulvescens),
white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), marsh rice rat (Oryzomys palustris), cotton rat (Sigmodon
hispidus), packrat (Neotoma floridana), eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), and swamp rabbit
(Sylvilagus aquaticus). Historically, red wolf, bison, and black bear ranged into or near the project area,
although bison was intermittently absent from the region (Burt and Grossenheider 1976; Dillehay 1974;
Kricher and Morrison 1998; Sutton and Sutton 1985).
Common land turtles include the eastern box turtle (Terrapene carolina) and western box turtle (Terrapene
ornate), while the snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentinia), river cooter (Chrysemys concinna), and
diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin) comprise common water turtles. Common lizards include the
green anole (Anolis carloinensis), eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus undulates), broad-headed skink
(Eumeces laticeps), six-lined racerunner (Chemidophorus sexlineatus), and eastern grass lizard
(Ophiosaurus ventralis). Snakes, amphibians, and birds are also present in considerable numbers and
diversity (Blair 1950).

The reptilian assemblage includes the racer (Coluber constrictor), rat snake (Elaphe obsoleta), timber
rattlesnake (Crotalus horridus), common kingsnake (Lampropeltis getulus), woodhouse toad (Bufo
woodhousii), bullfrog (Rana catesbiana), northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens), eastern box turtle, and the
gulf coast toad (Bufo vallicepus) (Blair 1950; Conant and Collins 1998; Sutton and Sutton 1985).
Breeding birds common to the wooded areas include black vulture (Coragyps atratus), turkey vulture
(Cathartes aura), northern bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus), mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), redbellied woodpecker (Melanerpes carolinus), downy woodpecker (Picoides pubescens), scissor-tailed
flycatcher (Tyrannus forficatus), blue jay (Cyanocitta cristata), American crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos),
eastern bluebird (Sialia sialis), northern mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos), northern cardinal (Cardinalis
cardinalis), painted bunting (Passerina ciris), and lark sparrow (Chondestes grammacus). Migratory
species within wooded areas include yellow-bellied sapsucker (Sphyrapicus varius), northern flicker
(Colaptes auratus), eastern phoebe (Sayornis phoebe), ruby-crowned kinglet (Regulus calendula), hermit
thrush (Catharus guttatus), American robin (Turdus migratorius), and many sparrows (Bull and Farrand
1977; Kricher and Morrison 1998; Sutton and Sutton 1985).

CULTURAL SETTING
The project is located within the Southeast Texas archaeological region (Perttula 2004a). This region
includes the upper Texas coast, from the Sabine River southwestward to the Brazos River delta, as well as
the adjacent inland coastal plain (Ricklis 2004).

Prehistoric Cultural Setting
The prehistoric cultural setting is divided into three primary periods: Paleoindian, Archaic, and Ceramic.
The Protohistoric period bridges the gap to the historic period, with the arrival of Europeans to Southeast
Texas. The following summary draws heavily from regional sources found in The Prehistory of Texas
(Perttula 2004b) and a comprehensive regional summary provided by Story (1990) in The Archaeology and
Bioarchaeology of the Gulf Coastal Plain.

Paleoindian Period
In Southeast Texas, the Paleoindian period (ca. 11,500-8000 years before present [B.P.]) is divided into
Early (ca. 11,500-10,000 B.P.) and Late (10,000-8500 B.P.) subperiods (Perttula 2004a:9). Fluted points are
the most commonly known markers of the Paleoindian period. Early types include Clovis and Folsom
points. Late Paleoindian occupation is generally represented by Dalton, San Patrice, and Scottsbluff, in
addition to Plainview and Angostura points (Bousman et al. 2004; Ricklis 2004; Turner et al. 2011).
Few Paleoindian sites have been identified, and of those, none have been systematically excavated in
Southeast Texas. Paleoindian projectile points have been primarily identified by surface collections in the
region, and only about two dozen Paleoindian sites have been recorded in Harris County (Bousman et al.
2004:64). Paleoindian points have been found in excavated contexts, although these have generally been
mixed with materials from later periods. Most have been identified along major stream drainages (Ricklis
2004). It is thought that one factor in the lack of intact Paleoindian sites is due to the submersion of coastal
occupations by an increase in sea level and the lack of preservation across older upland areas (Aiuvalasit
2007; Aten 1983). Sea levels did not stabilize until the end of the Middle Archaic period, approximately
5000 B.P. (Aten 1983:157).
One of the largest local collections of Paleoindian artifacts comes from the McFaddin Beach site, located
east of the project in Jefferson County, Texas. Numerous Paleoindian points have been recovered, along
with a significant amount of materials from later time periods. Research at the site, however, indicates that
artifacts have been re-deposited inland from an unknown location offshore (Brown 2009). As no excavation
has been conducted at the site proper, little is known about the lifeways of individuals who utilized these
projectile points. A second significant site is located in northwest Harris County, where for the first time,
Clovis projectile points have been identified in close association with other Paleoindian tool types (Crook
2016).
Because no discrete Paleoindian components have been directly excavated in Southeast Texas, there is no
direct evidence for Paleoindian subsistence practices. In other parts of Texas and the Southeastern United
States, early discoveries of Paleoindian artifacts in conjunction with now-extinct Pleistocene megafauna,
such as mastodon and Bison antiquus, strongly biased early descriptions of Paleoindian subsistence towards
exploitation of big game animals (Bousman et al. 2004:15; Williams and Stoltman 1965). Continued
evidence from excavated Paleoindian components outside Southeast Texas suggests that Paleoindian
subsistence was more widely varied, though exploitation of big game was certainly a part (Bousman et al.
2004:75; Dunbar and Webb 1996).

One significant line of evidence for understanding Paleoindian lifeways comes from their diagnostic
projectile points; across North America, archaeologists have documented consistent Paleoindian use of
nonlocal raw materials for stone tool manufacture (Bousman et al. 2004). Most of the recovered points in
Southeast Texas are of a high grade lithic material that is scarce or absent in the region, suggesting a
widespread movement of peoples and materials over long distances in a highly mobile lifestyle that likely
depended on a diverse range of food resources (Ricklis 2004). Due to this high-mobility lifestyle, population
densities were likely low and social structure is hypothesized as relatively simple (Ricklis 2004).

Archaic Period
The Archaic period generally dates to the end of the Wisconsin glaciation and the concomitant extinction
of Pleistocene megafauna. The period is often distinguished by the development of a broad subsistence base
and evidence of a more intensive exploitation of regionally specific plant and animal resources. This change
in subsistence is marked by an adaptation in tool production to conform to new hunting techniques, food
preparation, and related activities.
The Archaic period in Texas is generally defined by pre- or non-horticultural adaptations and pre-ceramic
and pre-bow-and-arrow hunting technologies (Story 1990). In Southeast Texas, the Archaic sequence is
separate for inland groups (ca. 8000â1500 B.P.) and coastal groups (ca. 5000â2200 B.P.), due to the fact
that the coastline was not stabilized until the middle of the Archaic period (Ricklis 2004). Numerous
Archaic sites have been found along inland stream courses in Southeast Texas. The Archaic components at
these sites are represented by various types of flaked stone dart points and other lithic tools. For coastal
groups, the Archaic also includes stratified shell midden sites (Ricklis 2004).
For inland groups, a typological cluster of expanded-stem types dominates the Early Archaic (before ca.
6000 B.P.). Included in this group are early side-notched and early stemmed forms and corner-notched
points of the Keithville, Neches River, and Trinity types. These are followed by massively barbed points of
the Bell/Calf Creek series, as well as non-stemmed Tortugas points and stemmed Wells points (Ricklis
2004).
A variety of Middle Archaic tool types is reported from Southeast Texas, including Yarbrough, Bulverde,
Travis, and Pedernales in the western sector. The predominant Late Archaic types are Kent and Gary, with
Ensor and Godley points common in the western reaches of Southeast Texas (Ricklis 2004). A shift to the
use of poorer quality and more local lithic resources in Late Archaic times suggests reduced group mobility
and more tightly defined group territories (Story 1990). Several Middle to Late Archaic cemeteries have
been reported from the coastal prairies of the western part of southeast Texas. By the Late Archaic,
cemeteries were an integral part of cultural behavior along the inland margins of the coastal prairies zone,
further tying groups to specific locations of shared mortuary practice (Ricklis 2004).

Ceramic Period
The Ceramic period in Southeast Texas begins ca. 2200 B.P., with the introduction of ceramics on the Texas
Coast (Ricklis 2004; Aten 1983). Ceramics would not be found in inland southeast Texas for several
centuries (Ricklis 2004). A later, important technological innovation was the introduction of the bow and
arrow (marked by the appearance of small, light straight and expanded-stem stone point types), around
1300 B.P. (Ricklis 2004; Story 1990). The Ceramic period of southeast Texas is further divided into Early
and Late subperiods.

The Early Ceramic subperiod shows a continuation of Archaic period subsistence and settlement patterns
(Ricklis 2004). Gary contracting stem points began to replace earlier Kent points. Tchefuncte and
Mandeville ceramics began to be present in small amounts as one moves east towards the Louisiana border,
but sandy Goose Creek ceramics spread throughout an area bounded by the Brazos River to the west,
extending to the upper reaches of the Neches and Angelina Basins (Ricklis 2004; Story 1990:257). This
area has been called the Mossy Grove culture area, and appears to have been a distinct regional development
that persisted through time until the Protohistoric period (Ricklis 2004:190).
On the central Texas coast, the Late Ceramic/Late Prehistoric subperiod saw an apparent division of Toyah
phase groups in inland areas and the Rockport phase groups (Ricklis 2004). Small, light arrow point types,
such as Scallorn, Alba, and Catahoula appear during this time (Ricklis 2004). Goose Creek ceramics
continue along with the introduction of grog-tempered and some bone-tempered ceramics, and decoration
becomes more elaborate, although grog-tempered ceramics are more common and decorations are less
elaborate inland (Ricklis 2004; Story 1990). Additional characteristics of the Late subperiod include the
appearance of bison bone along with a lithic technocomplex of Perdiz arrow points, unifacial end scrapers,
blade-core lithic technology, thin bifacial knifes (often alternately beveled), and expanded base
drills/perforators made from flakes and prismatic blades (Ricklis 2004). The use of cemeteries continued
through the Ceramic period, with the Harris County Boys School Site, including 29 burials on the western
edge of Galveston Bay, and the Mitchell Ridge Site on Galveston Island, presenting notable examples
(Story 1990:242; Ricklis 1994).

Protohistoric Period
Native groups in the Galveston Bay area, due to their proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, had some of the
earliest contact with European explorers and colonists in the history of Texas. However, this contact was
not sustained or formalized, and Native American lifeways predominated in the area until the late eighteenth
to early nineteenth centuries. The Protohistoric period (A.D. 1528 to 1810) began with several sixteenthcentury expeditions to the area, most notably Alvar NuÃ±ez Cabeza de Vaca's travels stemming from the
failed Panfilo de Narvaez expedition in 1527. Although it is not completely certain where Cabeza de Vaca
landed, evidence points to Galveston Island (Ricklis 1996:107).
The identity of the inhabitants of the area around Houston at that time is unclear; called the Bidai and the
Patiri, their language is unknown, although it may have been a western Atakapan language (Newcomb
2004). The normal range given to the northernmost Karankawa tribe, the Cocos, generally does not extend
past the Brazos River valley (Ricklis 1996:6). The eastern side of Galveston Bay was inhabited by a number
of Atakapan-speaking groups, including the Atakapans (proper) and the Akokisa (Newcomb 2004).
Galveston Bay may have been a dividing line between the Karankawan and Atakapan groups, with
settlements around the bay shifting and levels of interaction changing over time. However, by the later part
of the Protohistoric period, Akokisa villages were recorded up to halfway between the San Jacinto and
Brazos rivers (Aten 1983:35).
Archaeological sites from this period are characterized by a near-disappearance of native-made pottery,
except for Goose Creek Plain (Story 1990:260). Sites 41CH110 and 41CH32 in Chambers County, in the
Trinity River area, both appear to date to this period (Aten 1983:283). At Mitchell Ridge, groups continued
to bury their dead on Galveston Island throughout the Protohistoric period, suggesting little change in
lifeways throughout the period. Conclusively-dated European artifacts do not appear at Mitchell Ridge until
the middle of the eighteenth century (Ricklis 1994:470). Subsistence did not change much during this
period. Hunting, gathering, and fishing still provided the main source of sustenance; however, the
Atakapans and Akokisa appear to have slowly begun to incorporate horticulture into their subsistence
patterns (Newcomb 2004:661).

Historic Cultural Setting
Earliest Contact/Colonial Era
European documentation, control, and exploitation of Texas grew slowly after initial contact in 1528. As
noted, Cabeza de Vaca was shipwrecked near Galveston Bay in 1528, and began a years-long odyssey
living among and documenting the Native American groups of Texas (Hester 1999). Soon afterwards,
remnants of the Hernando de Soto expedition, led by Luis de Moscoso Alvarado, crossed through central
Texas in 1542, but found the country âuninvitingâ (Hudson 1997). As such, there was little interest or
pressure for colonization and Europeans largely avoided the area.
For approximately 150 years, contact between Native American groups and Europeans was sporadic, until
the French began to make incursions into the western Gulf of Mexico. French explorer Robert Sieur de La
Salle wrecked in Matagorda Bay in 1685, during an attempt to colonize the area (Weddle 2010). This
earliest French presence in Texas proved short-lived, as La Salleâs settlement in Matagorda Bay was
attacked and destroyed, likely by the Karankawa, in 1688. The French incursion into the region provoked
Spanish retaliation, resulting in the spread of the Spanish mission system into South Texas (Weddle 2010).
The Spanish utilized a system of missions and forts to convert and pacify the native populations in eastern
Texas. The first mission to the Caddoan speaking peoples of east Texas, San Francisco de los Tejas was
founded along the Neches river in 1690 (Chipman and Joseph 2010:86). Efforts along the coastal plain
continued through the 1700s. These included Mission EspÃ­ritu Santo de Zuniga, established in 1722 near
Matagorda Bay and then moved to Victoria County in 1726 (Walter 1999); Presidio La Bahia and Mission
Rosario, established in 1749 and 1754, respectively, in Goliad County (Ricklis 1999); and Mission Nuestra
SeÃ±ora de Refugio, which was built on the mouth of the Mission River and lasted until 1828 (Newcomb
1961:63). Missions located on the San Gabriel River, near present-day Rockdale, Texas, attracted some of
the displaced Atakapan inhabitants of the Galveston Bay area.
In response to increasing French fur-trading expeditions west from the Louisiana Territory, the Spanish
established a small mission and presidio at San AgustÃ­n de Ahumada, near the village of El Orcoquisac on
the Trinity River between 1756 and 1771 (Newcomb 2004). Though the missions continued operating
throughout the Spanish Colonial period, they were often impermanent, due to consistent antagonism
between the missions and local populations, as well as often receiving poor support from the far-removed
colonial government (Ricklis 1999; Newcomb 2004; Carlson and Corbin 1999). Though the Spanish
claimed the area, the Texas coastal plain would remain mostly native until the Mexican revolution and the
enticement of empresarios and colonists to the area. Even by 1804, the total non-native population of Texas,
even including better populated parts of central Texas at San Antonio, were likely less than 4,000 (Chipman
and Joseph 2010:219).
After Mexico gained independence from Spain, Mexico attempted to create a more populated buffer state
in Texas, in an effort to protect against encroachments by the nascent United States of America. To this
end, Mexican officials invited colonization of Texas, doling out land to farmers and ranchers and deferring
payment for several years (Henderson 1928). These policies also continued the Spanish system of
empresarios, by which land agents could obtain large grants of lands, which could then be separately
divided, instead of individual families petitioning the Mexican authorities. The area around Houston was
not initially included in any empresario grant, but petitions from new colonists soon had the area, which
was valued for the ease of transportation on the San Jacinto and Trinity River watersheds, added to Stephen
F. Austinâs grant (Henson 2010).

A majority of the empresarios and colonists were Anglo-American and white settlers (Henderson 1928).
Slavery was allowed within Mexico, until banned by President Guerrero in 1829; however, Texas was
specifically exempted (De LeÃ³n 2010). Despite this favorable treatment, suspicions of the increasingly
Anglo-American character of Texas and the increasing power and autonomy of Anglo-Americans in Texas
led to pushes by the Mexican central authorities under General Santa Ana to revoke the colonization laws
and promote a general trend of de-federalization of political control (De LeÃ³n 2010). Viewing these
capricious changes to law as tyranny, a number of Texans, including several former empresarios, convened
and declared independence for the Republic of Texas on March 2, 1836 (De LeÃ³n 2010).

Republic of Texas/Pre-Civil War
After the defeat of Santa Anna at the Battle of San Jacinto, the new Texan Congress settled on the nascent
town of Houston as the first national capital, and formed the county of Harrisburg (later to be renamed
Harris) in late 1836 and Montgomery County in 1837 (Henson 2010; McComb 1969). Although the capital
was short-lived, and relocated to Austin in 1839, the new city continued to grow, albeit slowly.
For a new, small, and relatively poor nation, protection and recognition by foreign nations was vitally
important. Annexation by the United States had always been one distinct possibility for Texas, and one that
was promoted by Sam Houston during his first term as president (Nance 2010). By the 1844 United States
presidential election, the question of Texas annexation was also on the front of the United Statesâ national
mind. The election of expansionist President James K. Polk was taken as a good sign of the desire of the
United States to include another slave state in the nation and Texas President Anson Jones pushed for
Texans to vote on the issue (Nance 2010). On October 13, 1845, annexation and the new Texas State
Constitution were accepted by overwhelming popular vote, and Texas became a part of the United States
on December 29, 1845 (Nance 2010).
The subsequent years leading up to the Civil War were generally a time of expansion and consolidation of
the primarily plantation-based farming economy, especially within the coastal plain region. Cotton
production increased over 600 percent between 1849 and 1859 (Britton et al. 2010). Slavery also expanded
at an astounding rate. Between 1850 and 1860, the overall number of slaves increased by 130,000,
expanding from 27 percent of the population to 30 percent of the population in the years just before the
Civil War (Campbell 2013). At the same time, other industries grew slowly, possibly due to the
overwhelming reliance on âKing Cotton.â Only 5 percent of Texans were involved in commercial activity
and only 1 percent involved in manufacturing (Campbell 2013). Transportation technology represented one
of the few areas of industrial development. By 1850, Houston was the home to the first railroad in Texas,
the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos, and Colorado (later to be known as the Galveston, Harrisburg, and San Antonio)
ran a line west through Houston (Werner 2010). A second line opened to the northwest in 1856, and by
1861, there was around 470 miles of track already laid in Texas (Werner 2010).

Civil War Period
Although Governor Sam Houston opposed any step that might lead Texas to break from the Union that he
had fought so hard to join, Texans voted to secede from the United States in February of 1861 (Wooster
2010). Up to 90,000 Texans served in the Confederate forces, mostly fighting outside the state boundaries.
Only the seacoast saw significant fighting during the war and most action focused on Galveston (Wooster
2010). Although Houston was not directly affected by fighting during the Civil War, prices rose and
hardship increased (McComb 1969:75). In June of 1865, two U.S. regiments reoccupied Houston, installing
a military government in the city (McComb 1969:77).

Post-Civil War/Reconstruction
Reconstruction brought massive changes to the economic and cultural systems of Texas. Many of the
former agricultural elites lost much of their wealth as a result of the abolition of slavery (Moneyhon 2010).
At the same time, former slaves, now emancipated, were provided with little support from their former
masters. There was some political advancement, including the election of black aldermen in Houston for
the first time (McComb 1969:81). Change was relatively slow, otherwise. The railroads slowly expanded
throughout the postwar period, with the Houston East and West Texas Railway crossing north and east of
Houston completed between 1876 and 1886 (Young 2010). Cotton remained the most significant cash crop
(Moneyhon 2010). Northeast of the Houston area, lumber exploitation was an important industry, spurred
on by the expanding railway supply lines (Long 2016).

Late Nineteenth/Early Twentieth Century
After 1880, rail transportation in the region increased significantly, principally following the introduction
of the Texas and New Orleans Railroad (now the Southern Pacific Transportation Company) in 1860, which
linked Houston to Orange. This railroad was later linked to the Louisiana and Western Railroad with
through service to the City of New Orleans in 1881 (Kleiner 2008). By 1890, Midwestern developers had
purchased land along the new North Galveston, Houston, and Kansas City Railroad, which headed east
from Houston along the southern side of Buffalo Bayou towards Morganâs Point. This was done to attract
other out-of-state farmers to raise fruit, berries, and vegetables, or just to seek a more temperate climate
(Henson 2010).
Oil exploration in the early twentieth century generated a population explosion in the region, particularly
in Humble with the oil boom at Moonshine Hill in 1905. Oil was also discovered at Goose Creek and Tabbs
Bay, which led to the establishment of a temporary boomtown from 1915 to 1917. In 1919, Ross Sterling
and the Humble Oil and Refining Company (now Exxon) built a refinery near the oilfield on the San Jacinto
above the mouth of Goose Creek. The development of the area as an industrial hub really began in 1911,
when the formation of the Houston Ship Channel Navigation District was approved. The 50-mile-long
channel was deepened and eventually widened to allow oceangoing vessels. Petroleum and other refineries
popped up all along Buffalo Bayou and the San Jacinto River (Henson 2010; Kleiner 2008). In modern
times, the regionâs economy continues to center around the shipping, agricultural, and petroleum industries.
Many residents of the region find employment in the Houston metropolitan area.

Transportation
MISSOURI PACIFIC RAILROAD

The Missouri Pacific railroad was originally founded as the Pacific Railroad and first began rail service in
1852, in Saint Louis, Missouri. Following the Civil War, the company was reorganized as the Missouri
Pacific and billed as the first railroad west of the Mississippi. Between 1879 and 1915, the railroad was
tightly controlled by New York financier Jay Gould, who greatly expanded the trackage through acquisition
and track construction. In 1880, Gould gained control of the Texas and Pacific Railroad and later purchased
the International Great Northern, gaining entry of the Missouri Pacific to Texas rail (Stout 1995).
The railroad continued to expand throughout the twentieth century, acquiring or constructing nearly 11,500
miles of track by the 1980s and operating with a fleet of 1,500 diesel electric locomotives. It was a major
hauler of freight, including grain, coal, ore, and other goods. As with many of the railroads founded at the
end of the nineteenth century, the 1980s saw reorganization and mergers, and the Missouri Pacific merged
with Union Pacific and Western Pacific in 1982 to form the largest rail system of it is day (Stout 1995).

ROAD DEVELOPMENT

As railways continued to be built well into the twentieth century, new roads followed, creating a linked
network. Rails functioned as the âmain arteries of travelâ and roads as âthe veinsâ (Pratt 1910). Railroad
companies soon realized that a good road system could greatly aid their business and they became one of
the most ardent supporters of the Good Roads Movement, a late-nineteenth and early-twentieth-century
grass roots effort that became a political and public policy issue (Wallace 2008). Road systems also
benefitted from the arrival of post offices. The Rural Free Delivery of Mail system brought mail to isolated
ranches and farms. Postmen refused to use roads in poor conditions and consistently reported conditions to
the proper authorities when they could not make their deliveries. This system united rural roads and post
routes engaging federal and state government interests. This new level of involvement with roads and their
development stretched significantly beyond the previous scope of county court control (Wallace 2008).
The fate of road improvement and system expansion was sealed with the introduction of the automobile
and the Federal Highway Act of 1916 and 1917. The new acts provided matching funding to states and a
regulatory partnership to assist with building plans (location, design, and cost estimates). In response to
these Acts, the Texas Highway Department was established in 1917. Not soon after, the Highway
Department would become the largest agency in the state (Wallace 2008). By 1917, Texas was well on its
way to creating a new and complete highway system. The system included several national marked highway
routes including the nascent Old Spanish Trail Transcontinental Highway (American Highway Association
1917; Luther 2010).
Texas was a predominantly rural state until the second half of the twentieth century and the creation of good
roads enabled farmers and ranchers to get products to markets and railways more easily. The Texas
Highway Department responded to this growing need by designing and improving supporting infrastructure
such as bridges and road side stops (Wallace 2008).
Despite advancements made in infrastructure technology and funding, ranching, and the nascent tourism
industry, the Great Depression took its toll on the towns and farms (Wallace 2008). By the early 1930s,
changes began to occur in local economies. The Texas legislature responded, and in 1931 all state agencies
were required to use only American-made materials and machinery in all new construction projects
(Wallace 2008). The Texas Highway Department worked together with the legislature to ensure Texas firms
and material suppliers received all of the contracts for road and bridge work. As the Depression advanced,
the state legislature and the Texas Highway Department looked for other ways to increase the number of
jobs for out-of-work Texans (Wallace 2008). In 1932, the Texas Highway Department mandated that
machines should be used as a last result and construction should be built by hand when at all possible
(Wallace 2008). In that same year, Texas began to receive federal aid under the Emergency Relief and
Construction Act. Funding continued under Rooseveltâs New Deal Programs, which covered 100 percent
of the costs and aided in economic recovery throughout the state (Wallace 2008).
Historic aerials of the area, available in Google Earth, show that in 1944, the roads that are now FM 2920
and State Highway 249 were both two lane roads. By 1978, State Highway 249, also known as the Tomball
Parkway, was two lanes travelling in each direction, and 1989 aerials demonstrate that FM 2920 also
allowed two lanes of traffic travelling in each direction. The 1995 aerials show that a center turn lane was
added to FM 2920, bringing the roadâs total width to five lanes to the west of State Highway 249. By 2009,
a portion of State Highway 249 had been rerouted as a toll road with access roads, and FM 2920 expands
as it approaches State Highway 249 to be at least eight lanes wide.

Tomball
The first settlers in the Tomball area arrived from Germany in the mid-1800s, and they quickly established
what would become a thriving lumber industry in the heavily forested environment in addition to agrarian
work (City of Tomball 2017). Tomball, Texas was established as the town of Peck, a railroad depot town
for the Trinity and Brazos Valley Railway in the northern-most portion of Harris County (City of Tomball
2017). Peck earned its name in early 1907 when the depot opened, but it was renamed Tomball in December
1907 for Thomas Henry Ball, who had brought the railroad to the settlement (City of Tomball 2017). Ball
was a former congressman, three-term mayor of Huntsville, Texas, and a lawyer in Houston. Ballâs efforts
are considered essential to the communityâs ongoing prosperity during the twentieth century (Dennis and
Upchurch 2010).
Tomball remained a farming and ranching community through the early 1930s, when oil was discovered
on land just west of town. Tomball formally incorporated in 1933 with a population of 665, and in 1935,
Tomball negotiated a contract with Humble Oil and Refining Company (now Exxon) to receive free water
and natural gas for 90 years (City of Tomball 2017). Tomball saw a significant population increase as
people relocated to work the oil fields in the area. Since the 1960s, Tomball has benefited from its proximity
to Houston and serves as a suburban community for many commuters, and in 2002, the city had a population
of approximately 9,500 (Dennis and Upchurch 2010).

METHODOLOGY
Background Review Methods
The background review consisted of a cultural resources and environmental literature review for the
proposed project, including a 1-mile radius around the direct APE. An SWCA archaeologist reviewed the
corresponding USGS 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle map on the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
(TASA), a restricted online database, for any previously recorded surveys and historic or prehistoric sites
located in or near the project. Site files, relevant maps, National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
properties, State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) listings, Registered Texas Historic Landmarks, cemeteries,
and local neighborhood surveys were also examined. Listings on TASA are limited to projects under
purview of the Antiquities Code of Texas or the NHPA of 1966; therefore, all work conducted in the area
may not be available. The Texas Historic Sites Overlay, historical topographic maps, aerial photographs,
Bureau of Economic Geology Maps, and the NRCS Web Soil Survey were also examined for historical and
environmental information related to the project.

Archaeological Field Survey Methods
The archaeological investigation of the direct APE was designed to be of sufficient intensity to determine
the nature, extent, and if possible, significance of any cultural resources located within the potential project
location. An intensive pedestrian survey with systematic shovel testing was conducted within the direct
APE.
In consultation with the THC, the survey met all THC minimum archaeological survey standards for such
projects with any exceptions thoroughly documented. The field survey consisted of two archaeologists
walking parallel transects placed approximately 30 m apart in order to examine the ground surface and any
eroded profiles for cultural materials. The pedestrian survey was augmented with a shovel testing strategy
that exceeded THC minimum survey standards and excavated shovel tests on a 100-m grid throughout the
entirety of the direct APE.
Additional shovel tests were excavated in areas of the direct APE with higher elevations than the
surrounding terrain in order to investigate locales that are typically believed to have a higher potential for
the presence of cultural materials. A Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) model displaying topographical
changes of 1-foot intervals was constructed for the direct APE (Figure 3) and used as an additional tool to
identify locales containing subtle elevation changes that otherwise might be difficult to determine. Data
used for the TIN was acquired from a Digital Elevation Map (DEM) map collected by the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 2011 and provided online by the USGS (2017).
Shovel/auger tests were 30 cm in diameter and excavated in 20-cm arbitrary levels to 1 m in depth or to
culturally sterile deposits, whichever came first. The matrix was screened through Â¼-inch hardware mesh.
The location of each shovel test was collected using a Trimble Geo 7X global positioning system (GPS)
receiver, and each test was recorded on appropriate project field forms.
If an archaeological resource was encountered during the investigation, it was explored as much as possible
with consideration to land access constraints. Any discovered resources were assessed in regard to potential
significance so that recommendations could be made for proper management (avoidance, non-avoidance,
or further work). Additional shovel tests were conducted per THC standards to define horizontal and
vertical boundaries for each resource.

Historic Resources Reconnaissance Survey Methods
SWCA conducted the historic resources reconnaissance survey using TxDOT survey standards. No
standing structures or buildings are located within the direct APE. The historic resources reconnaissance
survey was intended to identify all historic-age resources within any properties/tracts that are wholly or
partially encompassed by the indirect APE (survey APE) and which can be visually observed from existing
right-of-way (ROW). The fieldwork by an SWCA architectural historian consisted of the identification of
every historic-aged property in the survey APE that can be observed from public ROW.
During the fieldwork for the historic resources survey, structures, buildings, objects, and sites visible from
the existing ROW were analyzed for physical integrity and historical significance. While NRHP eligibility
requirements refer to properties 50 years old or older, SWCA uses the industry standard of 45 years old or
older for properties, to allow for potential project construction delays. As such, all resources within the
survey APE with the potential to have been built during or prior to 1973 were photographed at an oblique
angle, if possible, from the roadway or public access using a digital camera, and diagnostic features and
landscape conditions were noted.
An SWCA architectural historian evaluated the propertyâs age, integrity, and significance. Each property
was given a resource ID number, and data such as location, address (if possible), property type, form or
plan, stylistic influence, construction date, documentation, and NRHP recommendation was noted in the
field. Properties clearly built after 1973 were not photographed during this process unless occupying a
parcel containing historic-age resources.

Resource/Property Types within the Survey APE
Resource/property types within the survey APE include domestic buildings used for residential and
commercial purposes and manufactured commercial buildings. Specific domestic types include Ranch,
Manufactured, and Minimal Traditional. Due to the rural/suburban nature of the survey APE, the domestic
resources are primarily single family dwellings with associated outbuildings. Commercial properties utilize
manufactured buildings. Each of the domestic building types encountered during the survey are described
below.
RANCH

The primary new house type introduced after World War II is the ubiquitous Ranch. The Ranch style
(American Ranch, Western Ranch, or California Rambler) originated in the early 1930s in California,
loosely following the Spanish Colonial precedents in California filtered through Craftsman bungalow and
Prairie house styles that had been widely popular earlier in the twentieth century. The style remained largely
confined to California until after World War II. A combination of factors created a âperfect stormâ that led
to the popularity of the Ranch style in its heyday in the 1950s and 1960s: the demand for single-family
housing by World War II veterans starting families; the GI Bill that provided many different types of loans
for returning veterans to buy houses; an increase in automobile ownership that freed workers from the need
to live close to public transportation routes; and, the strict Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) guidelines under which developers operated in order to market the
houses to buyers using FHA and VA government-subsidized mortgages (McAlester 1984).

Ranch houses typically have a low-pitched gabled or hipped roof lines over a long, narrow side- or crossgabled form. The roof overhangs are large. Most have large picture windows, sliding glass doors, an
integrated porch, and an attached garage (McAlester 1984). Exterior detailing is minimal, but generally
includes decorative shutters, porch supports, and brick or masonry wainscoting. Most Ranch houses are one
story. The few that are two stories either have an overhanging second story or are split level. The two story
version is also called a Raised Ranch (McAlester 1984:602-603).
MANUFACTURED

Manufactured housing is a subset of American folk housing, first introduced in the 1930s. Commonly
known as a âtrailer homeâ or âmobile home,â based on its original purpose as mobile housing, manufactured
housing is prefabricated and factory-constructed, making it relatively inexpensive compared to other
housing types (McAlester 1984). Manufactured housing utilizes a steel frame for easier relocation, and it is
all constructed to the same code standard; manufactured housing is not required to adhere to local code
standards. Once moved to the site, manufactured housing is placed on a foundation that is constructed onsite. Manufactured housing makes up approximately 10 percent of all American housing, and they represent
20 percent of the housing in rural areas. The housing type is usually sited in groups in parks (similar to
subdivisions) when located in urban or suburban areas, while in rural areas, the homes are typically installed
individually. Modern manufactured housing typically comes in a âsingle-wideâ style or a âdouble-wideâ
style, which is two single-width units designed to be joined together along a long side to create a larger
home (McAlester 1984:149-151).
MINIMAL TRADITIONAL

This style grew out of the Great Depression where decorative elements of previous more exuberant styles
(Bungalow, Tudor Revival, and Prairie) were stripped away leaving only the basic house form. Its
popularity grew as its financing was typically backed by FHA-insured loans. The low costs associated with
construction of a Minimal Traditional home also made it popular for worker housing during World War II
and for new development in the post-war period. Typical stylistic elements of the Minimal Traditional
house include low or moderately pitched roofs and close eaves. The houses are usually on a pier and beam
foundation and most have a single chimney. Minimal Traditional houses date to 1935â1950 nationwide and
it is not uncommon to see examples in the area lingering into the 1960s (McAlester 1984:599).

Curation
SWCA conducted a non-collection survey. Artifacts were tabulated, analyzed, and photographed in the
field, but not collected. Original survey documentation will be curated with the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory in Austin, Texas, in fulfillment of requirements for Texas Antiquities Permit No.
7902.

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS
Results of Background Review
Previous Investigations
The background review revealed that a single previously conducted cultural resources survey had been
completed within the APE. At least four additional surveys have been completed within 1 mile of the project
(Figure 4).
A 2015 survey of the Willow Creek development was completed by South Texas Archaeological Research
(Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7482) and intersects a small area in the southeastern-most corner of the APE
(THC 2016). A 1984 Texas Highway Department (THD) survey for State Highway 249 passes adjacent to
the northwestern-most APE (THC 2016). In 2000, Moore Archaeological surveyed the M125 project
approximately 1.0 mile from the current project. A 2006 survey by PBS&J for the Cypress Lakes Crossing
development was located approximately 0.18 mile south of the project (THC 2016). A 1997 survey for the
Quinn Road Extension was completed by Moore Archaeological approximately 0.54 mile northeast of the
project (THC 2016). None of these surveys identified cultural resources in the immediate vicinity of the
project.

Previously Recorded Cultural Resources
The background review shows that there are no previously recorded cultural resources within or
immediately adjacent to the APE. Nine previously recorded cultural resources are located within 1 mile of
the project (see Figure 4). This includes six archaeological sites, two cemeteries, and one historical marker.
No NRHP properties or SALs are located within 1 mile of the project.
ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES

Six archaeological sites, all historic, are located within 1 mile of the project (Table 2). All of the sites have
either been determined or recommended not eligible for the NRHP (THC 2016). None of the sites will be
impacted by the proposed project.

CEMETERIES

Two cemeteries are located within 1 mile of the proposed project. The Salem Lutheran Cemetery (aka Rose
Hill Lutheran Cemetery, Tomball Cemetery, Salem Lutheran Cemetery of Rose Hill, and Salem Cemetery)
is located approximately 0.91 mile northwest of the project. This cemetery has more than 1,000 interments
ranging in dates from 1859 to present (THC 2016). The Faetche Cemetery is reported to be immediately
adjacent to (west of) Salem Lutheran Cemetery. No additional information is available for this cemetery.
Neither of these cemeteries will be impacted by the proposed project.
HISTORICAL MARKERS

One historical marker is located within 1 mile of the proposed project. Marker No. 15724 was erected in
2009 for the Salem Lutheran Cemetery. The marker commemorates the burial ground that began as the
Scherer Family Cemetery, early German settlers to the area. In 1869, the Scherer family transferred
property, including the cemetery, to Salem Lutheran Church and the cemetery was renamed at that time.
The cemetery and marker are located approximately 0.91 mile from the proposed project and will not be
impacted.
POTENTIAL CULTURAL RESOURCES

Historical topographic maps (USGS 1916, 1920, and 1962), aerial photographs (National Environmental
Title Research [NETR] 1957, 1967, 1973, 1981), and historical maps on the Texas Historical Overlay
(Foster et al. 2006) were also examined. Eight possible structures of historic age (two from 1916 map and
six from 1962 map) were identified to potentially be located within the APE of the proposed project.

Results of Archaeological Field Survey
An intensive archaeological survey was conducted throughout the entirety of the direct APE between
January 30 and February 9, 2017, and February 12, 2018. The overall project was subdivided into three
sections (northern, central, and southern) to conduct the cultural survey in a more efficient and linear fashion
(Figure 5). In total, 143 shovel tests were excavated on a grid established for the project and to delineate
newly identified cultural materials within the direct APE. In addition, two auger tests were employed and
a single cut-bank profile was examined, as well. The results for all excavated shovel tests, auger tests, and
the cut-bank profile are presented in Appendix A.

Northern Section
The northern section of the direct APE began at the western boundary of State Highway 249 and extended
south for approximately 0.75 mile southwest to FM 2920. This portion of the project comprised
approximately 71.33 acres.
Shovel testing was not conducted within flooded areas located in the northeastern portion of this section.
These extremely inundated areas are visible on available aerial imagery. A modern trash dump was
identified east of ST A-4, in the vicinity of a trailer that has been removed recently.
The environment within this section was primarily pine forests with a very dense undergrowth, or frequently
inundated wetlands (Figure 6). Soils encountered within the northern section were, for the most part,
relatively shallow; however, a review of available soils data and the project TIN map revealed that locales
containing slightly higher elevations were situated within this section, as well. As a result, additional shovel
tests were placed within the grid in order to further investigate these locales for the presence of cultural
materials.

Figure 6. Overview of the northern section of the archaeological survey, near
Shovel Test (ST) 9, facing south.

Forty-one shovel tests, along with two auger tests, were excavated within this section; all were negative for
cultural materials. A typical shovel/auger test contained yellowish brown fine sandy loam overlaying a
brown sandy clay matrix. No subsurface cultural deposits were identified by shovel testing and no surficial
cultural expressions were observed in the northern section of the archaeological survey.

Central Section
The central section of the archaeological survey is located south of FM 2920 and extends for approximately
0.68 mile to the southwest to Schauer Jones Road. This section encompasses an area of approximately 38.25
acres.
For the most part, the environment encountered in this section was either open cattle pastures or relatively
mature forests with dense greenbrier understory. Evidence of frequent flooding was also observed
throughout this section (Figure 7). As a result, soils encountered in the area were relatively shallow. The
project TIN map suggested that some areas within the direct APE contained higher elevations, but upon
further investigation, these locales were found to have several inches of standing surface water.
Twenty-two shovel tests were excavated in this section; all were negative for cultural materials. Soils
consisted primarily of shallow brown or yellowish-brown fine sandy loams overlaying a mottled
brown/strong brown sandy clay substrate. No shovel tests were found to contain subsurface cultural deposits
and no surficial cultural expressions were observed.

Figure 7. Overview of the central section of the archaeological survey, near ST 17,
facing west.

Southern Section
The southern section of the archaeological survey extended south from Schauer Jones Road for
approximately 0.55 mile before terminating approximately 0.30 mile north of Humble Road. This section
spanned an area of approximately 125.94 acres.
Environs observed in this section were primarily open cattle pastures apart from the southeastern portion,
which contained relatively mature pine forests with extremely dense understory (Figure 8). Evidence of
frequent flooding was also observed within large areas of this section, and several large linear detention
ponds were observed in the southernmost portion, as well.
Soils encountered within the southern section were relatively shallow brown fine sandy loams overlaying
a saturated and mottled, reddish-yellow sandy clay substrate. A review of the TIN map revealed that areas
near a perennial drainage system in the eastern portion of the section contained slightly higher elevations
than some of the surrounding locales. Therefore, additional shovel tests were excavated within the grid at
these locales in order to further investigate for cultural deposits.
Eighty shovel tests were excavated and a cut-bank profile along a perennial stream was investigated within
the southern section. A single isolated find (Isolated Find 1) was identified and subsequently delineated
within this section.

ISOLATED FIND 1

Isolated Find 1 consists of historic debris in a single shovel test (ST 56) situated on a terrace approximately
100 m west of an unnamed tributary of Willow Creek. It is located on the western side of a field road,
entirely within a cattle pasture (Figure 9).

Examination of historical imagery revealed that this was previously the location of an oil/gas well pad
dating to the 1940s, and several existing risers are still visible adjacent to the isolate. A distinct vegetation
change spanning an area approximately 28 m north-south by 40 m east-west was noted as evidence of the
extent of past heavy disturbances associated with well pad construction. In addition, a thick oily residue
with a strong odor, as well as a noticeable burn level at a depth of 10-20 cmbs were also identified in several
of the excavated shovel tests at this location.
Artifacts identified at this locale consisted of four colorless glass fragments, two unidentified iron fragments
(Figure 10), and a single fragment of oyster shell from 0-20 cmbs, and two colorless glass fragments with
patina were observed 20-40 cmbs. The glass appears to have been heated/melted, likely in association with
the noted burn event. A handful of much smaller oyster shell fragments were also identified within some
of the screened matrix.

Figure 10. Representative artifacts at Isolated Find 1.

Eight shovel tests were excavated in cardinal directions surrounding Isolated Find 1 in order to fully
investigate the extent of the cultural expression. All excavated delineation units were observed to be devoid
of cultural materials and no cultural features were identified.
Due to the paucity of cultural material, lack of cultural features, and a general lack of research interest in
mid-twentieth-century oil/gas well pads, the find was considered insufficient to constitute an archaeological
site and a trinomial designation was not requested. As such, Isolated Find 1 is recommended NOT
ELIGIBLE for the NRHP or for designation as a SAL and no further work is recommended.

Results of Historic Resources Reconnaissance Survey
The historic resources reconnaissance survey of the survey APE was completed on February 15, 2017 and
February 1, 2018. Seventeen resources were initially identified as being of historic-age and were
documented in the field as such; however, further investigation determined that none of these were of
historic age. These resources include buildings at 22525 Park Road, 21711 E. Champagne Circle, 15215
FM 2920, 28414 Calvert Road, 28334 Calvert Road, 28330 Calvert Road, and 29510 State Highway-249.
The field reconnaissance survey identified a total of six historic-age resources on five separate properties
within the survey APE (Figure 11). These historic-age resources (identified as Resource IDs 1â6) were
further surveyed, are summarized in Table 3, and are discussed below.

Resource ID 1
Resource ID 1 is located at 14802 FM 2920 and is a residential property facing south onto the road (Figure
12). Access to the property is via a concrete driveway with large aggregate on the north side of FM 2920.
Resource 1a is the primary residential building, 1b is a shed, 1c is a carport, and 1d is a shed. Harris County
Appraisal District (HCAD) lists the parcel as having no buildings; however, the buildings are visible in this
location on historic aerials dating to 1944.

Figure 12. Resource ID 1, facing north.

Resource ID 1a is a one-story, L-plan, front gabled-roof Minimal Traditional style residence. The exterior
cladding is red brick on the lower half and wide painted horizontal siding on the upper half. A shed-roof
porch and the foot of the L-plan were both added at a later unknown date. The porch sits on a concrete slab
foundation with three steps, and it is otherwise blocked by corrugated sheet metal pieces, which hinder
visibility from the street. While the original house and porch roof are clad in brown composition shingle,
the foot addition uses a metal roof cladding. Windows are metal frame one-over-one sash windows with
screens. There is one set of paired windows on the south faÃ§ade, while all other windows are singularly
placed; windows are regularly spaced on the west elevation, the only elevation visible with more than one
window. There is a window-mounted air conditioning unit in the southern-most window on the west
elevation.
Resource ID 1b is a wood frame shed with corrugated sheet metal siding and roofing. The shed is open on
the east elevation with a central wood column supporting the roof at the opening.
Resource ID 1c is a wood frame two-car carport with corrugated metal siding and roof. The opening for the
garage faces south.
Resource ID 1d is a painted front gabled wooden shed with vertical siding. No entry was visible from the

Resource ID 2
Resource ID 2 is a residential property located at 14807 FM 2920 on the south side of the street (Figure
13). Resource ID 2 is on the same parcel as Resource ID 3, according to HCAD records. Resource ID 2
contains one surveyed property, a residence. HCAD lists the construction date as 1960 for the house.

Figure 13. Resource ID 2, facing southeast; Resource ID 3 is noted on the left.

Resource ID 2 is a one-story minimal traditional style T-plan residence on a pier and beam foundation. The
house uses a hipped side gable roof with a cross gable dormer over the existing front porch. The roof is clad
in brown composition shingles, and the porch has a painted turned wood balustrade. The building is clad in
painted horizontal siding with vertical siding at the corners. The corners and window frames are painted a
different color to provide some detail. On the north faÃ§ade, windows are arranged in an ABCB pattern. Aand B-type windows are typical to the house and are six-over-six sash windows, likely made from vinyl;
A-type windows are paired, while B-type are installed singularly. All windows have screens in the bottom
sashes. The C-type opening is the front door, which is obscured by a screened storm door. A shed roof
carport is attached on the east elevation.

Resource ID 3a is a double-wide manufactured building used as the primary office for the commercial
business at this address. The building is on a pier and beam foundation and sited with the long edge facing
the street. The building uses paired six-over-six vinyl sash windows with screens in the lower sash on all
visible windows. Windows are regularly spaced on the east and west elevations, and are arranged ABAA
on the front north elevation, where the B-type opening is the entry to the building. The door is obscured by
a storm door. There is a porch supported by four square columns that spans the first three bays of the north
elevation. An additional shed roof overhang on the west elevation is supported by three posts sharing a
single base, and it is used as a carport.
Resource ID 3b is a prefabricated gabled shed with horizontal siding and a red metal roof. The opening is
not visible from the ROW. There is one wall-mounted air conditioning unit visible on the north elevation.
Resource ID 3c is a prefabricated gabled shed with standing seam metal siding and roof. The siding and
roof merge, so there is no overhang from the roof. The opening is not visible from the ROW.
Resource ID 3d is a prefabricated gabled shed on a pier and beam foundation. It is the smallest of the
secondary buildings, and its opening is not visible from the ROW.

Resource ID 3 is a typical example of late-twentieth-century Manufactured architecture with associated
outbuildings; it is not exceptional nor precedent setting. Additionally, manufactured housing is best known
for its quantities across the country, whether in parks or as a dominant type in rural communities, and an
individual manufactured house fails to convey the multitudes of manufactured housing. As a singular entity
with no evidence of a significant person occupying the building, Resource ID 3 does not rise to the level of
significance required for eligibility to the NRHP under criteria A, B, or C. As such, Resource ID 3, including
the residence and its associated outbuildings, is recommended NOT ELIGIBLE for the NRHP.

Resource ID 4
Resource ID 4 is a residential property located at 15403 Treichel Road on the south side of the road (Figure
15). Access to the property is via a gravel driveway at the center of the parcelâs street front on the south
side of Treichel Road. Resource 4a is the primary residential building; Resource 4b is a secondary
residential building; 4c is a secondary building; 4d is a carport; 4e is a shed; and 4f is a shed. HCAD dates
Resource 4a to 1970, while conversations with the owner date Resource 4b to 2016, identifying it as a nonhistoric age resource.

Figure 15. Resource ID 4a, facing south.

Resource ID 4a is a brick Ranch house, and it is currently under repairs after flooding in the spring of 2016,
according to a conversation with the property owner during survey. The house is a one-story, side-gabled
rectangular plan building with a red brick cladding and vertical wood siding in the gables. There is a brick
chimney on the western end of the house. Visible windows are nine-over-nine sash windows with screens
in the lower sash. Windows are regularly spaced across the front north faÃ§ade, and they are flanked by
louvered wood shutters; it is unknown which bay contains the front door. The brown composition shingle
roof overhang on the north faÃ§ade serves as a porch, and it is supported by regularly spaced round wood

facing the street. The front north faÃ§ade has openings arranged in an ABCA arrangement, where the A- and
B-type openings are windows, and the C-type opening is the front door, which is obscured by a storm door.
The windows are six-over-six vinyl sash windows with screens in the lower sash; the A-type windows are
paired, while B-type windows are grouped in a set of three. A crude job-built front porch and stairs have
been constructed at the entrance, with the roof extending in a front gable over the porch.
Resource ID 4c is a detached garage and accompanies Resource ID 4a. Resource 4c is a one-story gabled
roof building with red brick cladding and vertical wood cladding in the gable. The opening is not visible
from the ROW, but the location of the driveway and other debris on the property indicate that the opening
is likely on the west elevation.
Resource ID 4d is a wood frame two-car carport which is being used to store a boat and a camper trailer,
necessitating a taller than typical carport. There are no side walls, and a roofing material cannot be
determined; however, the rafter tails are visible on the buildingâs low-pitch shed roof.
Resource ID 4e is a painted prefabricated gable roof shed on a pier and beam foundation. The roof is clad
in composition shingles, and the single pedestrian door is located on the east elevation.
Resource ID 4f is a shed roof carport. The sides are clad in sheet metal siding arranged vertically.
Resource ID 4 is a typical late twentieth century example of a Ranch house and outbuildings. Resource 4a
exhibits no exceptional architectural design, detailing, materials, or workmanship. Furthermore, original
materials and workmanship have been lost during the course of repairs. Resource 4a is a typical example
of rural residential construction and is not associated with any person of significance to the area or region,
and does not exhibit elements of design or materials of note. The building does not rise to the level to be
considered eligible for the NRHP under Criteria A, B, or C. As a result, Resource ID 4, including the
residence and its associated secondary buildings and structures, is recommended NOT ELIGIBLE for the
NRHP.

Resource ID 5
Resource ID 5 is located at 15131 FM 2920, and is a commercial property operating out of a formerlyresidential building with associated secondary buildings. Called Garden Accents, the property faces north
onto FM 2920, and it is accessible by a paved driveway near the eastern edge of the property. Resource 5a
is the primary commercial office, while Resources 5b and 5c are associated secondary buildings for the
property. HCAD reports that Resource ID 5a dates to 2000; however, SWCA architectural historians date
the building to the 1930s.
Resource ID 5a is a two-story residential building now converted for commercial use as an office building
(Figure 16). The Minimal Traditional-style building has vertical siding, a composition shingle-clad gambrel
roof, and sits on a pier and beam foundation. A porch wraps around the north and east elevations, and
enclosed addition is located on the west elevation. A single pedestrian door is centered on the north
elevation. The door is a residential-type door with a grid of nine lights in the upper half. Windows are all
6/6 vinyl sash windows. There are three windows on the first floor of the north elevation, two to the east of
the door and one to the west; and two windows on the second floor of the north elevation, both located in
dormers. An additional window is located on the west elevation in the gable for the roof.

Figure 16. Resource ID 5a, facing south.

Resource ID 5b is a prefabricated aluminum frame building with a gabled sheet metal roof. The building is
clad in horizontal siding. A porch spans the entirety of the west (front) elevation. The west elevation also
has one pedestrian door with a single light in the upper third and one sash window at the southern end. The
other elevations are not visible from public ROW.
Resource ID 5c is a prefabricated aluminum frame shed with a gabled sheet metal roof. The shed has walls
in the upper third on north and south elevations only, and they are clad in horizontal siding.
Resource ID 5 is an example of mid-twentieth century Minimal Traditional architecture, and the gambrel
roof is an unusual and interesting choice for the region. Though the atypical design choice provides an
argument for significance under Criterion C, new windows, non-wood shingles, and the enclosed elevation
on the west elevation cause the building to lose its integrity of design, materials, and workmanship. For
these reasons, SWCA recommends that Resource ID 5 is NOT ELIGIBLE for the NRHP.

Resource ID 6
Resource ID 6 is a commercial property located at 1720 Hicks Street. The property is on the north side of
the street, and HCAD records indicate the property is owned by Waukesha-Pearce Industries. The property
is accessible via a paved driveway roughly centered on the property. Resource ID 6a is a (recently
demolished) former office building constructed in 1957; 6b is a metal frame building constructed in 1970;
and 6c is a prefabricated metal frame building installed in 2012.
Resource ID 6a is visible in aerials from 2016 and in Google street view imagery from May 2017. However,
SWCAâs survey determined that the 1957 office building has been demolished. The buildingâs concrete
slab foundation, steps to the main entrance, and a few original beige/tan bricks remain.
Resource ID 6b (Figure 17) is a steel frame gabled roof building on a concrete slab foundation. There is
also a butterfly roof canopy located on the east elevation that appears to serve as a loading dock and covered
storage. The building utilizes vertical siding, and the only visible fenestration is located near the southern
end of the east elevation. Visual survey could not determine what type of window exists in this location.

Figure 17. Foundation for Resource ID 6a and Resource ID 6b, facing north.

Resource ID 6c is a large prefabricated steel frame warehouse and loading area. The building reads as a
large gabled roof warehouse with loading docks and an attached flat roof, two-story office space on the
west elevation. The warehouse has five overhead doors on the south elevation for moving construction
equipment onto trucks. There is a large flat roof canopy with a large metal fascia protruding from the office
space on the west elevation that appears to be a port cochere for the facility. Four recessed lighting panels
are visible beneath this canopy. The only pedestrian access visible is located on the south elevation in the
office portion. There are single pedestrian doors on both the first and second floors, each with no lights.
There is a life safety stair leading from the second floor door. No other openings are visible on this building.
Resource ID 6 is an example of late-twentieth-century commercial and light industrial architecture; it is not
exceptional nor precedent-setting. Particularly, with its original 1957 office now demolished, the property
does not rise to the level of significance required to meet the standards for Criterion C. The remaining
buildings do not rise to the level of significance required to meet Criteria A, B, or C. As a result, SWCA
recommends that Resource ID 6 is NOT ELIGIBLE for the NRHP.

Cultural Resources Survey for the Proposed M124 Channel Improvement and Detention Basin Project

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On behalf of Costello, Inc., and the HCTRA, SWCA conducted a cultural resources survey for the proposed
M124 Channel Improvement and Detention Basin project. Channel improvements are required for
additional flood control storage as a result of ongoing development of State Highway 249 and future
developments to FM 2920. HCTRA proposes to channel from the existing TxDOT detention ponds adjacent
to State Highway 249, south and west for approximately 2 miles to Willow Creek, crossing FM 2920, and
to create two new detention ponds south of FM 2920, encompassing approximately 226.52 acres in total.
For the purposes of this report, this 235.52-acre area is considered the direct APE; however, SWCA
anticipates that the actual construction footprint will be a reduced area. The indirect APE included a 1300foot buffer beyond the boundary of the direct APE.
Investigations were conducted pursuant to the acquisition of a USACE Section 404 permit in accordance
with 33 CFR Part 325, Appendix C (Processing Department of Army Permits: Procedures for the Protection
of Historic Properties; Final Rule 1990; with current Interim Guidance Documents dated April 25, 2005
and January 31, 2007); Section 106 of the NHPA (16 USC 470) and its implementing regulations 36 CFR
800; and the THC minimum archaeological survey standards for such projects. As portions of the project
location are owned by a political subdivision of the State of Texas, work was additionally conducted in
compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas Natural Resource Code, Title 9, Chapter 191) and
accompanying Rules of Practice and Procedure (Texas Administrative Code, Title 13, Chapter 26) under
Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7902.
The background literature review revealed that a single cultural resources survey had been conducted within
the direct or indirect APE. No cultural resources have been previously recorded within or immediately
adjacent to the direct or indirect APE.
During the archaeological investigation, SWCA identified a single cultural resource (Isolated Find 1) within
the direct APE. Isolated Find 1 is a single positive shovel test containing historic debris, likely associated
with a mid-twentieth-century oil/gas well pad. The find was considered insufficient to constitute a site and
a trinomial will not be requested. Isolated Find 1 is recommended NOT ELIGIBLE for the NRHP or for
designation as a SAL.
An historic resources reconnaissance survey was also conducted in order to identify the presence of eligible
historic standing structures or properties. No aboveground historic structures or buildings are located within
the direct APE. Six resources (Resource IDs 1-6) were identified as being of historic age within the survey
APE; however, each is recommended NOT ELIGIBLE for the NRHP or SAL, due to loss of integrity of
design, materials, setting, and/or workmanship.
SWCA conducted a non-collection survey; therefore, no cultural materials will be curated. Original survey
documentation will be curated with the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin, Texas, in
fulfillment of requirements for Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7902.
In accordance with Section 106 of the NHPA 36 CFR 800.4 (b)(1) and the Antiquities Code of Texas,
SWCA has made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify significant cultural resources within the
APE. No historic properties listed or otherwise eligible for the NRHP, or for designation as a SAL, were
identified within the direct or indirect APE. As such, SWCA recommends no further cultural resources
investigation and a finding of NO HISTORIC PROPERTIES AFFECTED per 36 CFR 800.4(d)(1) and
further recommends that the project be allowed to proceed.
