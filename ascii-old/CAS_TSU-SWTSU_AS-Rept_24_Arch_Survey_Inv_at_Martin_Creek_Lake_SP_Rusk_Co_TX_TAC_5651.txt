Management Summary
An intensive cultural resources survey was conducted at Martin Creek Lake State Park by the Center for
Archaeological Studies and Archeological & Environmental Consultants, LLC in June 2010 under contract
with Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. Although previous investigations had been carried out in
the park, no comprehensive survey had been completed that would allow TPWD and park management
personnel to appropriately manage the park’s cultural resources in accordance with state law. During
the 2010 survey, the park was stratified into areas with high, medium, and low probability of containing
archaeological sites. A total of 423 shovel tests were excavated in these areas; four new sites were
documented and nine previously reported sites were revisited and assessed. These 13 sites reflect historic
era occupations in the park dating from the mid-1800s to the mid-1900s and prehistoric occupations that
include Late Archaic, Woodland, and Caddo components.
Based on the results of this work, together with previous findings, two sites are recommended as being
eligible for designation as State Archeological Landmarks (SAL). Six sites are recommended as having
undetermined eligibility for SAL status. If any of these six sites will be impacted by proposed developments
within the park, further investigations are recommended in order to complete this SAL assessment. Such
work should be conducted well in advance of any proposed undertaking so that TPWD archeologists can
have sufficient time to complete this assessment and, if necessary, offer appropriate recommendations
about how to mitigate the loss of potentially important information resulting from such undertakings.
Five of the 13 sites are not recommended as eligible for SAL status; three of these could not be
relocated during the 2010 fieldwork and are thought to have been completely destroyed since they were
initially recorded in the 1970s.
In addition to these 13 sites, two areas designated as having a high probability for containing
additional, as-yet-undocumented deposits were identified. Future work in these areas, including use of a
backhoe to reach extended depths beyond what can be achieved by shovel testing, is recommended to
search for deeply buried deposits. Together, these probability areas and the management priority rankings
for the 13 documented sites should allow park personnel to appropriately steward the various cultural
resources that are present or that are likely to be present at Martin Creek Lake State Park.

Chapter 1
Introduction
Martin Creek Lake State Park (Park) is located near the community of Tatum, southeast of Longview, within
Rusk County, Texas, encompassing approximately 287 acres immediately adjacent to Martin Creek Lake
(Figure 1). The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) requested a cultural resources inventory
of prehistoric and historic sites located within the Park boundaries, and contracted with the Center for
Archaeological Studies, Texas State University-San Marcos (CAS) to complete this work. This report presents
the archeological findings from the intensive archeological survey and site evaluation project.

In order to complete the project according to TPWD schedule considerations, CAS subcontracted parts
of the project to Archeological & Environmental Consultants, LLC (A&E). Fieldwork was completed between
June 9, 2010 and June 19, 2010. Dr. Jon Lohse (CAS) served as Principal Investigator for the project, and
Rodney J. Nelson (A&E) served as the Project Archeologist. Fieldwork was performed by Mark Walters and
Josh Hamilton. Timothy K. Perttula provided significant contributions as Regional Expert. All work was done
under Antiquities Permit #5651.
The report is organized into seven chapters. Following this introductory chapter, Chapter 2 describes
the environmental setting of the Park, including a review of late Holocene-era environmental change.
Chapter 3 summarizes the culture history of the region, including both Native American and AngloAmerican settlements. Chapter 4 describes previous archeological research in the Park. Some of the sites
identified by previous research were apparently incorrectly plotted, and the condition of many of these sites
has changed since they were first recorded. Chapters 5 and 6 outline the methods employed in the current
project and the results of this survey and site assessment effort. These results should be viewed by TPWD
cultural resource and Park managers as the most accurate, current understanding of the Park’s archeological
record. Chapter 7 provides detailed discussions of the sites in terms of management priorities, including
their recommended eligibility status for State Archeological Landmark designation. Site locations according
to previous surveys are depicted in Appendix 1. Appendix 2 presents the results of all shovel tests
excavated during this project. Appendix 3 is a map showing the current, accurate locations of all sites and
their boundaries as documented in June 2010. Appendix 4 is an inventory of artifacts recovered during this
project. Appendices 1 and 3 are not included in copies of this report intended for public distribution.

Chapter 2
Environmental Setting
Martin Creek Lake State Park is located within the Pineywoods physiographic region of East Texas (Figure 2;
see also Diggs et al. 2006) and is situated adjacent to Rocky Ford Creek, a small tributary of Martin Creek.
Martin Creek is a major tributary of the Sabine River, with which it merges approximately 20 km to the east.
The Pineywoods cover large parts of East Texas and have medium-tall to tall broadleaf deciduous
forests in more mesic habitats. Shortleaf and loblolly pines are common on upland fine sandy loam soils with
adequate moisture. Small areas of tall grass prairie are sometimes present in both communities throughout
the region (e.g., Jordan 1981:Figure 4.1), particularly in more xeric sandy lands. Bottomland communities
along the major river and creek drainages contain a diverse hardwood and swamp forest (including
cypress, tupelo, and sweet gum), with natural levees and alluvial terraces, point bar deposits, old stream
channels, oxbow lakes, and backwater swamps. A less diverse bottomland hardwood community is present
along the smaller creeks and their tributaries. The Red, Sulphur, Big Cypress, Sabine, Neches, Angelina,
and Trinity rivers flow east and southeast through the Pineywoods, but none of these rivers originates in the
Pineywoods.

Figure 2. Physiographic regions of Texas.

The climate of the East Texas region is humid, with a mean annual precipitation in modern times
of at least 100–125 cm. Periods of maximum rainfall occur in the spring and fall. The growing season is
approximately 260 days or more, with the last freeze generally occurring in March and the first freeze by
late November. Droughts are not uncommon in the modern era, and dendrochronological analyses of tree
rings for the last 1,000 years suggest there were numerous wet and dry spells during that time (Stahle and
Cleaveland 1994, 1995), including several lengthy droughts.
Based on mid-nineteenth-century General Land Office records from various parts of East Texas, the
overstory in the uplands in the Pineywoods consisted of a mixture of pine and oaks, including blue oak,
blackjack oak, post oak, and red oak. This is especially the case in settings with very deep and well-drained
sandy soils. Some of these landform/soil settings (probably with deep sandy sediments) in the Pineywoods
probably also had pure stands of pine. In the eastern and southern parts of the region, much of the steeply
sloping uplands in the Pineywoods had pines or pine-oak overstories, as southern and steeper upland
slopes also would have had. However, northern and more gently sloping valley landforms appear to have
been dominated by oaks.
In upland settings with thinner sandy sediments that are not as well-drained, the overstory in the
Pineywoods is likely to have consisted of a variety of oaks (post oak, red oak, blackjack oak, bluejack oak,
and chinquapin oak) and hickory. Abundant nut mast would have been seasonally available in these upland
habitats. On landforms with deep and well-drained loamy fine sand, such as more mesic lower valley slopes,
toe slopes, and elevated alluvial landforms, the vegetational overstory in the mid-nineteenth century across
the region included red oak and post oak trees, along with other hardwoods that tolerate periodic flooding.

Geological Setting
East Texas is part of the Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic province. The province is composed of Mesozoic
and Cenozoic sediments that filled the East Texas basin with sediments of marine, delta, and river
origin, including sandstone and mudstone, along a receding coastline. These deposits dip and become
progressively younger toward the present Texas coastline.
Principal geologic formations from north to south in East Texas include the Austin, Eagle Ford,
Woodbine, Navarro, and Taylor groups (Cretaceous period); Wilcox and Midway groups (Paleocene period);
Jackson and Claiborne groups (Eocene period); the Catahoula formation (Oligocene period); Fleming and
Oakville formations (Miocene period); and the Willis formation (Pliocene period). All the major streams and
most of their principal tributaries, such as Martin Creek, have Quaternary alluvium (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1992). The Eocene Wilcox and Carrizo Sand formations (Bureau of Economic Geology 1965) form
the underlying bedrock materials in the Park area. The Wilcox has thick fine-grained quartz sand, silty clay,
and sandy clay, with beds of lignite and concretions of siltstone and ironstone (i.e., hematite and ferruginous
sandstone). The Carrizo Sand is a massive quartz sand with indurated ledges of ironstone (i.e., hematite and
ferruginous sandstone).
Although these geologic formations in the Gulf Coastal Plain are poor in lithic raw materials (Banks
1990:Figure 2.1), upland cobble- to pebble-sized stream gravels are relatively widespread in parts of East
Texas, especially in the Trinity and Sulphur River basins (Banks 1990:56–57), and to a limited extent in the
Neches River basin (see Anderson et al. 1974). However, high quality and large knappable cobbles of chert,

4

novaculite, and quartzite are present only in the Red River gravels in the northeastern part of East Texas,
and these are derived from chert-bearing formations in the Ouachita Mountains of southeastern Oklahoma
(Banks 1990:Figure 1.20).

Soils and Sediments
As described by Griffith (2000), the soils present within the Park include Attoyac fine sandy loam, 1–3
percent slopes (AyB); Bernaldo very fine sandy loam, 1–3 percent slopes (BeB); Latex very fine sandy loam,
1–3 percent slopes (LtB); Lilbert loamy fine sand, 2–5 percent slopes (LyC); Meth fine sandy loam, 2–5
percent slopes (MtC); Naconiche mucky sandy loam, frequently flooded (Na); Tenaha loamy fine sand, 5–15
percent slopes; Woodtell loam, 1–3 percent slopes (WtB); and Woodtell loam, 5–15 percent slopes (WtE)
(Figure 3). The Naconiche mucky sandy loam is present in floodplain settings, while the other soils occur
in upland landforms. Generally, soil formation and its subsequent taxonomic classification depend upon a
number of variable factors including climate, organisms, topography, parent material, and time.
The parent material of soils found within the Park is either alluvial (deposited by rivers or streams)
or marine. These two modes of deposition are characteristic of different periods of time in the region’s
geomorphic history, and are reflected in distinct landforms. Older marine deposits occupy the uplands
while the younger, alluvial deposits make up terrace and floodplain landforms. There are implications for
archeological deposits potentially contained therein. Cultural materials deposited on flat to gently sloping

uplands would be limited to shallow contexts due to the age of the marine deposits and slow rate of
aggradation. Multiple occupations of a single site would most likely be comingled and, therefore, difficult to
discern. Younger alluvial sediments have the potential to contain buried archeological materials in discrete
strata.
As indicated by their names, the texture of many of the soils present within the Park is sandy. These
sandy sediments extend across northeast Texas, and are sometimes referred to as the Sandy Mantle when
significantly thick accumulations of sandy sediments are present. The research potential of archeological
sites occurring in Sandy Mantle contexts has been disputed (see Lohse and Bousman [2006:60–63] for a
synopsis). Two views debate whether or not the nature of landforms (dynamic and aggrading vs. static and
non-aggrading) found in East Texas Sandy Mantle areas, and the degree of translocation of archeological
materials by biological mixing found in such settings, generally meet a reasonable contextual threshold for
determining site integrity and contain interpretable samples of archeological materials.

Holocene Environmental Change
The climate in East Texas has changed dramatically over time. These changes have affected the biodiversity
and carrying capacity of the region and in turn have likely influenced adaptations of Native American
groups and later Anglo-Americans living in this region, especially as the former became more dependent
upon cultivated plants and the latter more dependent on sources of water and arable soils in the risky and
occasionally drought-prone environment.
Pollen data from Ferndale Bog (Holloway 1994) in the Ouachita Mountains of southeastern Oklahoma
and from several bogs in Central Texas (Bousman 1998) indicate that the Late Pleistocene climate (ca.
11,000–14,000 years ago) was cool and dry and probably supported a grassland steppe. By 11,000 years
ago, as the climate became warmer and wetter, oak woodlands or oak savanna habitats would likely
have been present throughout much of eastern Texas (and north into Oklahoma). These woodlands were
maintained for several thousand years, perhaps until 7500 years ago, although Bousman (1998:Figure 4)
notes a period of open, grassland vegetation in Central Texas at 9500–8750 B.P. The Ferndale Bog pollen
diagram (see Ferring 1994:Figure 4.5) also points to a more open and grassy setting, based on decreasing
oak pollen and a lower pollen influx between approximately 8000 and 9200 years ago. Whether such a
setting characterized East Texas at that time is not known.
Between approximately 7500 and 5000/4500 years ago, the Middle Holocene climate was quite warm
and dry, and Ferring (1995:24) suggests this was a period of significant reduction in available biomass
for Native American hunter-gatherers in the region. In the Ferndale Bog area of southeastern Oklahoma,
the vegetation was an oak-hickory-pine woodland, while farther to the south and west in Central Texas,
grasslands were dominant. Bousman’s (1998:210) palynological analyses led him to conclude that the grass
cover was greatest—and the climate the driest—between 5500 and 4500 B.P., while Ferring (1995:24) places
the very dry and warm episode between approximately 6500 and 5000 B.P.
The Late Holocene period after approximately 4500 years ago appears to have been one of fluctuating
climates—moist or dry cycles—that were generally wetter than during the preceding Middle Holocene
period and more like modern climatic conditions. Ferring and Yates (1996:Figure 7.5) propose that there
were wetter years between approximately 5000 and 2000 B.P. and after 1000 B.P., with a drier cycle 1,000–

6

2,000 years ago when grassier conditions prevailed. With these climatic and rainfall conditions, oak-hickorypine woodlands were probably the principal vegetation in upland habitats in much of East Texas (as they
are today), with a well-developed riverine forest in the floodplain settings.
Supporting the drier and warmer cycle in the middle portion of the Late Holocene, the Ferndale
Bog pollen record indicates that the peak in pine pollen was between approximately 800 and 1800 B.P.
(Holloway 1994:Table I.2), while Bousman (1998:207) notes one grass spike or peak in the Weakly Bog in
Central Texas that dates about 1,500–1,600 years, with another between 400 and 500 B.P. Stable carbon and
oxygen isotopes from mussel shells along Denton Creek in North Texas, however, point to a warm/dry peak
at approximately 2850 B.P., and then again after 1500 B.P. (Brown 1998:164). Stable carbon isotope values
from humate samples in the Cooper Lake area of the upper Sulphur River basin in Northeast Texas have
C4-enriched peaks (i.e., higher C4 grasses in the biomass) around 2000 B.P. and 4000 B.P. (see Perttula
1999:Figure 2-4).
For the last 1,000 years or more, dendrochronological records (from cypress trees and logs) are the
most accurate and temporally sensitive data available on Late Holocene environmental change (e.g., Stahle
1996). Fortunately, recent dendrochronological research in Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana, as well as the
Southeast and Midwest U.S., by Stahle and Cleaveland (1988, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995) and Benson et al.
(2007), has compiled significant new information on subtle but changing climatic and rainfall conditions
and trends for the general Trans-Mississippi South region, of which East Texas is a part (see Schambach
2002:Figure 5.1).
Droughts have not been uncommon in the region in modern times, and dendrochronological analysis
suggests there were numerous wet and dry spells between approximately A.D. 1000 and 1700, just as there
were between 5,000 and 1,000 years ago. Some of the worst droughts may have occurred around A.D. 1555,
1570, 1595, and 1670, and the period of A.D. 1549–1577 has been suggested to have had the worst droughts
of the past 450 years (Stahle et al. 1985), at least in parts of the mid-continent. Another severe droughty
period appears to have taken place between about A.D. 1440 and 1475.
More detailed dendrochronological analyses from bald cypress tree-ring chronologies on spring
rainfall between A.D. 1002 and 1988 from Big Cypress State Park in northwestern Louisiana indicate the
wettest years were A.D. 1053–1057, 1168–1176, 1178–1180, 1265–1268, 1323–1328, 1553–1555, 1584–1586,
1718–1719, 1797–1800, 1810–1812, and 1866–1873. These years would likely have been optimal growing
years for prehistoric and early historic Caddo agricultural groups, and then later for Anglo-American
farmers and ranchers, assuming a correlation between crop production and spring precipitation values
(cf. Anderson et al. 1995:265). The wetter rainfall conditions would also likely have led to an increase in
the extent of swamp and wetland habitats in the major stream basins and a concomitant expansion in the
carrying capacity of woodland plants and animals in the area. In historic times—after approximately 1650—
the wettest intervals occurred during 1797–1815 and 1866–1876.
Conversely, the driest years in prehistoric and early historic times in East Texas—A.D. 1014–1016,
1215–1217, 1444–1447, 1455–1460, 1529–1533, 1653–1655, 1697–1699, 1841–1846, and 1855–1860—may
have led to stressed food supplies. In these instances, food stress was seen in the inability of Caddo groups
and later Anglo-American settlers to produce sufficient food reserves through cultivation, including maize
agriculture. The drier periods did not influence the character of Caddo settlement systems, which remained
dispersed throughout the prehistoric and early historic periods, but it did influence their distribution across

7

the landscape, as Caddo agricultural populations began to concentrate in the Pineywoods and along certain
major streams (i.e., the Red, the lower Sulphur, the middle Sabine, and parts of the Neches-Angelina river
basins).
The very dry years between A.D. 1444 and 1460 correlate well with the grass spike/drier episode
noted by Bousman (1998) from the Weakly Bog pollen record. These more significant droughts probably also
interrupted the flow of the numerous upland springs in the area, as well as the volume of flow in the major
and minor stream basins. Reduced moisture in turn would have influenced the relative quantity of animal
and plant foods in floodplain and upland forested habitats. The very droughty years during 1841–1846
correlate closely with the final abandonment of East Texas by the Caddo. Stahle and Cleaveland’s (1988)
drought reconstruction for North Texas indicates that three of the driest years between 1698 and 1980
occurred in 1855, 1857, and 1859, and that 1855 was the driest year in that 282-year record.
For the period of wet and dry spells from approximately A.D. 1000 to 1650, the wetter years (> 1,400
standard ring width indices [sri]) were more than two times as frequent as the driest and droughty (< 560
sri) years (see Perttula 1999:Figure 2-5). After approximately A.D. 1430, the wetter years occurred less often,
some 55 percent less between A.D. 1600 and 1700 than in the period of approximately A.D. 1200–1400. In
historic times, the two wettest but also equitable intervals were 1792–1826 and 1861–1890, with the wetter
years eight times more common than the very dry and droughty years. Conversely, during 1827–1861,
the very dry and droughty years outnumbered the very wet years by a ratio of 9:1. These very different
paleoenvironmental conditions over long periods of time may have played an important role in East Texas
in human adaptations. These conditions may also have influenced changes to the landscape brought about
by significant erosion (and the transportation of sandy sediments), stream downcutting, and the formation,
preservation, or degradation of landforms that contain, or once contained, traces of human occupation.

Chapter 3
Culture History
This section considers the diverse character of the prehistoric and Caddo archeological record in East
Texas. First, the history of archeological research in East Texas is discussed, followed by a review of what
is known about the prehistory and early history of East Texas, beginning with the Paleoindian period. A
principal focus of the summary of Native American culture history is the post-ca. A.D. 850 Caddo settlement
of East Texas.

History of Archeological Research
Archeological research in Northeast Texas has a lengthy history that has been thoroughly discussed by
several authors, particularly Story (1990), Thurmond (1990), Guy (1990), and Perttula (1992). Substantial
archeological investigations began with the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences expedition in 1912
along the Red River—mostly in northwestern Louisiana and southwestern Arkansas (Schambach 1983;
Kelley 1997). However, Clarence B. Moore (1912) recorded several important Caddo mound sites and
conducted excavations at the Moore/Higginbotham site (3MI3/30), located a few miles east of the Texas
state line (Kelley and Coxe 1998; Weinstein et al. 2003).
Much of our knowledge of the prehistoric use of the region is primarily based on the 1930s excavations
by The University of Texas at Austin of aboriginal sites and cemeteries (e.g., Pearce 1932; Jackson 1933,
1934) throughout the region, very notably in the upper Neches River basin, and then extensive late 1930s
and early 1940s Works Progress Administration investigations at the George C. Davis, Hatchel, Mitchell, and
Yarbrough sites (Guy 1990; see also Newell and Krieger 1949; Johnson 1962; Creel 1996) in Cherokee, Bowie,
and Van Zandt counties, respectively. Since then, most of the information about the Paleoindian, Archaic,
Woodland, and Caddo archeological record in East Texas comes from a disparate group of privately funded
archeological research, including: (1) avocational archeological investigations and Texas Archeological
Society field schools (see Corbin and Hart 1998; Jelks 1967; Middlebrook 1994, 1997; Perttula et al. 2001;
Turner and Smith 2003), and (2) University of Texas at Austin (Fields 1979; Story 1981, 1982, 1995, 1997)
and Stephen F. Austin State University field schools in archeology (see Corbin and Hart 1998). Extensive
professional archeological work has also been conducted in numerous state and federally funded or
permitted reservoirs in the Sabine, Sulphur, Neches, Angelina, and Big Cypress drainage basins (see
Anderson et al. 1974; Bruseth and Perttula 1981; Duffield 1963; Fields et al. 1997; Jelks 1965; Jensen 1968;
McClurkan et al. 1966; Thurmond 1990; Woodall 1969). Archeological survey investigations have been
carried out in the National Forests in East Texas (see Sherman et al. 1999), and considerable archeological
work has occurred in large surface lignite mines (e.g., Galan et al. 1997; Kotter et al. 1993; Perttula et al.
1998; Rogers et al. 2001; Sherman 2001; Rogers and Perttula 2004; Cliff and Sills 2005; Dockall et al. 2009)
and in TxDOT-sponsored archeological projects (see Cliff and Perttula 2002; Cliff et al. 2004; Lohse 2005;
Ricklis, ed., 2004; Rogers et al. 2003). Ahr (1999) has reported on Texas Department of Transportation
investigations of a probable Late Caddo site (41CE326) exposed along the U.S. Highway 69 right-of-way, and
Goode et al. (1997) have reported on investigations at the multicomponent 41RK195.

Paleoindian and Archaic periods
The East Texas archeological record for the period from approximately 8,000 years ago to as long as
approximately 13,000 years ago (Waters and Stafford 2007), primarily consists of surficial, mixed, or
isolated finds of diagnostic projectile points (cf. Bousman et al. 2004; Johnson 1989; Story 1990), based on
comparisons with well-dated and stratified sites to the east and west of the region (see Anderson et al.
1996:15). At the Forrest Murphey site (41MR62), for example, Clovis, Plainview, Dalton, and other lanceolate
projectile point forms and tools were found in several discrete concentrations on a high terrace above
Big Cypress Creek; faunal remains from extinct elephants, a rather rare occurrence, were also recovered
in apparent association (Story 1990). The Delta Bone Quarry 5 (41DT86) on the North Sulphur River
contained a buried hearth and an antler tool (Slaughter and Hoover 1965), and charcoal from the hearth has
calibrated intercepts ranging between 10,560 and 10,794 years B.P. (Bousman et al. 2004: Table 2.1), broadly
contemporaneous with regional Folsom and Dalton complexes.
Undoubtedly other discrete archeological components are present in the region, such as the buried
Finley Fan site, occupied as early as 6400 years B.P. (Gadus et al. 1992), and the spatially discrete Late
Paleoindian John Pearce site in the Red River basin in northwestern Louisiana (Webb et al. 1971), but they
have proven to be quite difficult to define and recognize. For example, a provocative but poorly known
Paleoindian site has been reported by avocational archeologists in deep sand deposits on the Neches
River, where it had been exposed by Lake Palestine shoreline erosion. Thirty-five Paleoindian lanceolates,
primarily Dalton and Scottsbluff forms, projectile point preforms, drills, scrapers, and channel flakes have
been found there, with most of the tools manufactured on cherts from the Edwards Plateau of Central
Texas and Ouachita Mountains cherts and quartzites (Perttula 1989). The site also contains a Folsom point,
two channel flakes, and a Folsom preform of Alibates agatized dolomite. In another case, McCrocklin
(1994 personal communication) has documented Dalton and early side-notched Big Sandy points, knives,
scrapers, bone tools (antler flakers), and cut bone (some fossilized) from blue clay deposits buried in a Red
River gravel bar north of Shreveport, Louisiana. An extensive buried Early to Middle Archaic settlement is
present at the Conly site along Loggy Bayou in the Red River basin in northwestern Louisiana (Girard 2000).
Paleoindian materials have been recovered at several archeological sites in the Post Oak Savanna and
Pineywoods of East Texas (Bousman et al. 2004: Table 2.2 and Figures 2.45, 2.46e, h-i). The early Paleoindian
(ca. 13,000–10,500 years B.P., based on calibrated dates and age estimates) archeological materials include
Clovis and Folsom fluted lanceolate points, commonly manufactured on high-quality nonlocal lithic raw
materials, along with scraping tools (Story 1990:Table 44). According to Bever and Meltzer (2007:Table 1),
no Clovis points have been documented from Rusk County, Texas, although the overall density of Clovis
points and sites is high in East Texas (Bever and Meltzer 2007:74, 77).
Unfluted lanceolates—usually resharpened and beveled—dominate the Late Paleoindian period (ca.
10,500–9500 B.P.) material culture record in the region, including Dalton (Johnson 1989:Figure 7; Wyckoff
and Bartlett 1995), San Patrice, and Scottsbluff points which concentrate in Northeast Texas and locales to
the east (e.g., Saunders and Allen 1997:Figure 2), as well as early side-notched points and Albany beveled
bifaces or knives (see Webb et al. 1971; Johnson 1989:Figure 13), Quince-style scrapers, end and side
scrapers, denticulates, burins, and bifacial adzes. San Patrice projectile points and associated tools are
typically manufactured from local raw materials (Saunders and Allen 1997:3; Webb et al. 1971).

The distributions of Paleoindian artifacts within the region suggest that these early occupations
were principally situated within the valleys of major stream basins (see Thurmond 1990:Table 53 and
54; Anderson 1996a), as well as resource-rich areas like the Ouachita Mountains escarpment (Anderson
1996b:Figure 3.2). It appears that Paleoindian foraging groups occupied small camps and had an
unspecialized hunting tool kit.
Anderson (1996b) postulated that the initial and most intensive Paleoindian settlement of the Southeast
(which would include East Texas) took place in the resource-rich valleys of the Mississippi River and its
principal tributaries. From there, Paleoindian groups settled throughout the wooded Southeast and East, with
concentrations at 250–400 km intervals, indicating the scale of movement of these highly mobile foragers.
The relatively sparse Paleoindian archeological record, in conjunction with the dispersion of artifacts on
many landforms and different settings within the region, seems to indicate that the Paleoindian groups were
very mobile hunters and gatherers rather than specialized hunters of extinct megafaunal species (Fields
and Tomka 1993:82). Johnson (1989) also suggests that some of the Late Paleoindian archeological remains
(Plainview and Scottsbluff projectile points, and Cody knives) from the region are a result of Plains Late
Paleoindian (ca. 10,000–9,000 years ago) groups that moved into parts of East Texas during periods when
grassland habitat spread eastward, in order to exploit the plains resources (such as bison) found there.
Archeological data from the Yarbrough site (41VN6) on the upper Sabine River were employed by
Johnson (1962) to first bring chronological and cultural order to the diverse Archaic (ca. 7500–500 B.C.)
archeological record found in Northeast Texas. Of particular import were Johnson’s (1962:208) temporal
divisions of the Archaic based on projectile point sequences, and the introduction of plain ceramics at the
end of the Archaic. Story (1990:Figure 32) and Thurmond (1990:Table 8) provide the most current, although
still poorly dated with supporting radiocarbon assays, chronological classifications of Archaic-age dart
points, with many straight and expanding stem forms characteristic of the Early and Middle Archaic periods
and other straight and contracting stem darts particularly diagnostic of the Late Archaic (and much of the
Woodland period as well).
Recent paleoenvironmental research (see above) suggests that much of the Archaic period, particularly
the period approximately 8000–4000 years ago, was drier than today, with apparent reductions in biomass as
well as the local expansion of prairie habitats along the western margins of the region. Nevertheless, drier
conditions and changing vegetation conditions “clearly did not preclude occupations” (Ferring 1995:33)
during these periods. While the archeological data are still rather limited, it appears that group mobility
remained high for these hunting-gathering foragers (who utilized hardwood nuts, deer, shellfish, turtles, and
small mammals) during the Early Archaic (ca. 9500–8000 years ago), and group territories were large and
poorly defined, with most sites conforming to what Thurmond (1990:41) called ”heavy” and ”limited-use”
areas; that is, repeated and recurrent occupations by small groups. Anderson (1996a) suggests that such
Archaic groups had highly mobile foraging adaptations along the Red River, the central Sabine River, and in
interior uplands away from major drainages, with expedient lithic technologies. Most sites of this age were
briefly used, although this may be a product of differential site preservation, but tended to concentrate in
the larger drainages within the region.
By the Middle Archaic period (ca. 8000–5000 years ago), fairly substantial and extensive occupations
are recognized within the major basins in the region, with a rather limited use of smaller tributaries and
headwater areas. Components of this period are open camps dominated by hunting tools (including the

11

distinctive blade notched Evans point) and generalized cutting/scraping tools, lithic debris, ground stone
tools, and cores.
Burned rock features (possible hearths, ovens, and cooking pits) and burned rock concentrations
are present in dated Middle Archaic contexts at a few sites in the Sulphur River drainage (see Gadus et
al. 1992; Cliff et al. 1996), suggesting that an important activity was the cooking and processing of plant
foods, but mainly by small groups for short-term use (Fields et al. 1997:90). A single burned rock feature at
the Unionville site (41CS151) has a calibrated date of 4040–4161 B.C. (Cliff et al. 1996). Lithic raw material
data from a possible Middle Archaic assemblage at Lake Fork Reservoir in the upper Sabine River basin
indicates that the exchange of nonlocal materials (particularly finished tools) was commonplace (Perttula
1984), although “patterns in raw material use were not uniform across Northeast Texas” (Fields and Tomka
1993:92), and in general the use of nonlocal raw materials was not common. At Cooper Lake in Archaic
contexts, the nonlocal lithics that are present primarily originated to the north in the Red River basin (Fields
et al. 1997). Mound complexes of Middle Archaic age in northern Louisiana at this time also suggest the
development of more complex hunter-gatherer societies in the Trans-Mississippi South (see Saunders et al.
1997; Saunders and Allen 1997).
Late Archaic sites (ca. 5000–2500 years B.P.) are widely distributed in the Pineywoods and Post Oak
Savanna, occurring along the major streams, near springs, on spring-fed branches, upland ridges, and
on tributary drainages of all sizes. In fact, the distribution of Late Archaic sites suggests these groups
moderately to extensively ranged over and exploited almost every part of the region. In particular,
Anderson (1996a) has noted major concentrations of Late Archaic sites along the Red and Little Rivers in
southwest Arkansas and northwest Louisiana, as well as in the Ouachita Mountains. Aboriginal populations
continued a generalized foraging adaptation, combined with apparent population growth. There are only a
few well-dated Late Archaic period components known in the region, however.
Some Late Archaic occupations in riverine settings contain earthen middens (i.e., the Yarbrough site
along the Sabine River), but, generally, sites of this age contain burned rock features and/or concentrations
of burned rocks as well as small pits. The Late Archaic occupation in Area C at the Unionville site (41CS151)
had a buried anthrosol or occupational surface that had been darkened or stained by cultural activities,
while within the anthrosol were two clusters of burned rock features (Cliff et al. 1996). Large pits and rock
hearths in a Late Archaic component at the Herman Bellew site (41RK222) have calibrated dates that range
from 380 to 1590 B.C. (Rogers et al. 2001). At the Mockingbird site (41TT550) in the Big Cypress Creek
drainage, the Late Archaic component (dated 410–830 B.C.) contained scattered burned rocks and low
frequencies of stone tools and projectile points, suggesting it was used only as a temporary encampment
or “limited use” area. Many other Late Archaic sites or components are known where burned rocks from
hearth construction and use were relatively abundant, along with projectile points, bifacial and flake tools,
and flake debris. In cases of extensive occurrence of burned rock features, this suggests that the cooking
and bulk processing of plant foods in ovens and pits was important to some Late Archaic populations in the
region.
These settlement data are compatible with higher population densities, limited group mobility but
a wide dispersion of camp and foraging areas, the possible establishment of definable territorial ranges,
and a well-developed foraging economy based on the hunting and gathering of local food resources. No
paleobotanical evidence is available that indicates the Late Archaic populations here cultivated native plant

12

species (i.e., such as sumpweed, sunflower, and chenopod), as was the case by the first millennium B.C. in
many parts of Eastern North America (Fritz 1994:25–27). Nutshells and a few fragments of prairie turnip
(Psoralea sp.) are documented in Late Archaic components at the Unionville site (Cliff et al. 1996) along
the lower Sulphur River, and at Cooper Reservoir sites (Fields et al. 1997). The high use of local lithic raw
materials during the Late Archaic speaks to a more confined interregional interaction at this time (Fields
and Tomka 1993; Perttula and Bruseth 1995). By contrast, in the Mississippi River basin of northern Louisiana,
Late Archaic sites are marked by extensive quantities of nonlocal lithic raw materials, particularly novaculite
and Ozark cherts (Saunders and Allen 1997:19)

Woodland period
The Woodland period (ca. 500 B.C. to ca. A.D. 800–850) in much of the region, particularly from the Sabine
and Sulphur rivers to the Red River, may be recognized primarily by plain and relatively thick ceramic
bowls and “flowerpot-”shaped jars, double-bitted axe heads, the smaller and thinner Gary projectile
points, and later in the period by corner-notched arrow points (Schambach 1998, 2001; Thurmond 1990).
North of the Sulphur River and in contiguous areas in southwestern Arkansas, northwestern Louisiana, and
southeastern Oklahoma, such Woodland cultures have been called Fourche Maline by Schambach (1998,
2001).
In several instances, Lower Mississippi Valley (LMV) related ceramics (such as Tchefuncte Stamped,
Churupa Incised, Marksville Incised, Troyville Stamped, and Marksville Stamped) occur with some
frequency in Woodland period components (Story 1990:246; Rogers et al. 2001). These ceramics may be
trade items that evidence contact and interaction between Trans-Mississippi South Native Americans and
groups in the LMV, or were ceramics whose stylistic decorative attributes were borrowed by local potters
(see Schambach 1982, 1998; Perttula and Bruseth 1995).
At Woodland period sites along the Red River in southwestern Arkansas and Northeast Texas, ceramics
used for cooking and food serving are abundant, and make up a significant proportion of the artifact
assemblages, while in many other Woodland period sites in much of Northeast Texas (particularly between
the Sulphur and Sabine rivers, but also characteristic of Woodland period sites in the Neches/Angelina
river basins), the use of ceramics was not as prevalent. These variations in the frequency of occurrence of
ceramics suggest regional differences in Woodland period food processing (i.e., boiling of foods in vessels
to make them palatable and a change from stone to wooden food preparation tools) and dietary habits (i.e.,
an increased consumption of carbohydrate-rich foods, possibly including some amounts of maize). It is
probable that there were also differences in sedentism between Woodland populations across the region,
based on strong correlations between sedentism and pottery making.
Later LMV Coles Creek period ceramics (and expanding stem arrow points similar to the Colbert and
Friley types) are present in notable quantities in several sites along the Sabine River and the Red River,
particularly at James Pace in a context dated approximately 1300–1000 years B.P. (Girard 1994), and at the
generally contemporaneous Ray site (41LR135) (Bruseth 1998). Similar ceramics occur in stratified contexts
at the Crenshaw (3MI6) and Mounds Plantation (16CD12) sites in burial mound features (Schambach 1997;
Webb and McKinney 1975). This is also the period when larger villages and multiple mound centers begin
to be constructed on the major streams (i.e., the Red and Sabine rivers) in the Trans-Mississippi South.

13

To the south of the Sabine River, but concentrated in the Neches-Angelina and Attoyac drainage basins,
Woodland period sites contain plain sandy paste ceramics (Goose Creek Plain, var. unspecified) of the
Mossy Grove tradition (Story 1990:Figure 39; Ricklis 2004: Figure 6.7) as well as decorated ceramics with
LMV affiliations. Woodland period components account for at least 25–50 percent of the known prehistoric
archeological sites in the Angelina-Neches confluence area and points west (Martin et al. 1995:Table 2;
Perttula et al. 1993) and represent the campsites and habitation locales of seasonal foraging-gathering and
hunting adaptations. Aboriginal pottery was adopted and used by Mossy Grove groups for the cooking and
processing of plant and animal foods by about 2,000 years ago, and by A.D. 600/700, if not earlier, the Mossy
Grove populations were using a variety of stemmed arrow points for hunting.
Changes in the density and placement of Woodland period sites across the landscape—particularly
focusing on sandy interfluves—led Corbin (1998:114–115) to suggest that horticulture may have been
introduced in the Neches-Angelina river basins during the Woodland period. Another alternative posited
by Corbin (1998:115) to account for the number and distribution of Woodland period sites in that part of
East Texas may “have been tied to . . . moving closer to a significant plant food source (i.e., plants that were
restricted to valley margins and/or the floodplain) whose use was facilitated by processing via cooking in
ceramic vessels.” Settlement data from the McGee Bend area at the confluence of the Angelina and Attoyac
rivers indicates that middens and occupational components are present in Woodland period contexts that
range in size from 0.5 to 8 acres (Duffield 1963; Jelks 1965).
Woodland period groups were still primarily hunter-gatherers who lived in increasingly larger groups
and resided for longer periods of time at some sites. The fact that some of these latter sites have relatively
substantial midden deposits (particularly along the Red River and in the upper Sulphur River basin, see
Schambach 1982; Fields et al. 1997), and some evidence for structures (probably daubed pole-and-thatch
structures), suggest more intensive occupations, decreased residential mobility, and higher population
densities, but the degree of permanence is still less than that seen in the subsequent long-term Caddo
settlement of East Texas (Perttula et al. 1993:99). Schambach (1983:5) has suggested that Woodland (or
Fourche Maline) period settlements along the Great Bend of the Red River included “small to medium sized
villages of from 1 to 4 ha.”
On the basis of the available paleobotanical information, Woodland period groups may have cultivated
squash (see McGregor 1997), and used native seeds and tubers/roots, as well as a variety of woodland
and aquatic animal resources, particularly white-tailed deer. At the Resch site, the rather extensive
midden deposits contained only burned rock features (probably used for the cooking and baking of
plant foods) and dense quantities of charred nutshells and poorly preserved animal bones (Webb et al.
1969). The presence of chipped stone axes and hoe-shaped tools in Woodland occupations suggest that
some horticultural practices (perhaps the use of colonizing weedy annuals) and forest clearance may
have begun. Stable isotope analyses of human remains of some 25+ Late Archaic, Fourche Maline, and
Formative–Early Caddo period samples indicate that maize was not a major part of the diet of Woodland
period groups (see Rose et al. 1998). The examination of skeletal pathologies in Woodland period contexts
from the Red River area and East Texas indicates low levels of infection, but high levels of degenerative
diseases relative to subsequent Caddo populations (Rose et al. 1998:Table 6-4). These data further support
the idea that Woodland period populations were primarily hunter-gatherers with a nutritionally adequate
diet, who probably lived across the region in relatively low population densities, but whose lifestyle was

14

characterized by chronic stress (on the joints) and heavy work loads (Rose et al. 1998:121). Maize is also
poorly represented in the archeological record before approximately A.D. 700–900.
In much of East Texas, Woodland period sites are not very common, perhaps because most of the area
was not heavily settled during this time (e.g., Story 1990:310). One of the few well-studied Woodland period
components in the Sabine River drainage is at the Herman Bellew site (41RK222), where the component
dates between approximately 500 B.C. and A.D. 685 (Rogers et al. 2001), and had rock concentrations as well
as small and large pits, contracting stemmed dart points, and a small amount of mainly plain ceramics as
well as LMV ceramic sherds. By contrast, settlements of this period are common throughout the Sulphur (see
Fields et al. 1997) and Neches-Angelina river basins (Corbin 1998).
No Woodland period burial mounds have been documented north of the Sabine River in the
Pineywoods and Post Oak Savanna, although they have been found in blufftop and alluvial valley settings
on the Red River in northwestern Louisiana and southwestern Arkansas (Schambach 1982, 1997; Webb
1984), and on the Angelina, Neches, and Sabine rivers in deep East Texas (Story 1990:310; see also Jelks
1965 and Jensen 1968). Associated with the construction and use of mounds in the Woodland period was the
procurement and dispersal of costly nonlocal raw materials and artifacts, including cherts, copper, and LMV
ceramic vessels that were included as grave goods or caches in the burial mounds.
The two or three mounds at James Pace (16DS268) on the Sabine River, however, apparently did not
serve as platforms for burials or structures or as caps for these features, and their functional significance is
undetermined (Girard 1994:15). The appearance of burial mounds (and mounds covering crematoria) in the
broader region does suggest that more complexly organized local groups did develop during the Woodland
period in these localities (cf. Schambach 1996, 1997).
In non-mound contexts, there is also evidence of mortuary or ritual practices in the Woodland period.
The Hurricane Hill site on the South Sulphur river contained a small cemetery on a prominent hill that dates
between cal A.D. 59 and 449 (Perttula 1999), and the Mahaffey site on the Kiamichi River in southeastern
Oklahoma also had a large cemetery with flexed and semi-flexed burials without grave goods (Perino and
Bennett 1978). Later Woodland period cemeteries with 9–21+ burials—dating after approximately A.D.
200–500—have also been identified at sites such as Snipes (41CP8; Jelks 1961) in the lower Sulphur River
basin, and several sites in southwestern Arkansas (Schambach 1982). These later shallow extended burials
contained an occasional whole vessel, boatstone, celt, or chipped biface. The vessels include flowerpotshaped Williams Plain and Coles Creek Incised types (see Jelks 1961:Plate 4). The Crenshaw site also had
many late Woodland period extended burials in village midden contexts (the large village is estimated to
cover 8 ha), and these also contained ceramic vessels as funerary objects (Schambach 1982:152).
Comparable burial cremation practices at the Hurricane Hill site in the upper Sulphur River basin and
the contemporaneous Johnny Ford site (3LA5), an early Fourche Maline village (ca. 200 B.C.–A.D. 300) in the
Great Bend area of the Red River valley, suggests the existence of similar belief systems among aboriginal
Woodland period groups in the Red and Sulphur river basins. Schambach (1996:36) describes the burials
at Johnny Ford as occurring in a “cremation cemetery,” and he further suggests that everyone in the village
may have been cremated (adults and children were also cremated at Hurricane Hill), using bluff-edge
crematoria at mound sites (Schambach 1997:57).
The identification of formally bounded cemeteries at a number of Woodland period habitation sites

15

in the Trans-Mississippi South (see Rose et al. 1999) is consistent with the existence and settlement of
distinctive social groups (based on kinship and/or residence) of affiliated individuals at sites and various
locales during that time. It appears that children and adults were buried together in these cemeteries,
suggesting that these Woodland populations had an egalitarian social organization within local settlements
and communities. At its broadest scope, the establishment of cemeteries clearly correlates with an
increasing sedentism in the western Gulf Coastal Plain of East Texas after approximately 200 B.C.

Formative, Early, and Middle Caddo periods
Abundant archeological information is available on the Formative (ca. A.D. 800/850–1000), Early (ca.
A.D. 1000–1200), and Middle (ca. A.D. 1200–1400) Caddo period occupation of the Pineywoods and Post
Oak Savanna of East Texas. First, Caddo archeological sites of these ages are quite common, and about
80 percent of the 500+ radiocarbon dates available from Northeast Texas archeological sites pertain to
occupations at prehistoric and protohistoric Caddo sites. The largest number of dates fall in the Middle
Caddo period (ca. A.D. 1200–1400), followed by the Early Caddo period (ca. A.D. 1000–1200). Using
calibrated ages and age mid-points of 1-sigma calibrated age ranges, the largest number of Caddo
radiocarbon dates fall within the AD 1201–1300 interval (Perttula 1998). While the number of dates in this
period is probably inflated to some degree by the extensive series of dates from the George C. Davis site
(see Story 1997, 2000), it does appear to be the case that Middle Caddo period occupations are rather
commonplace throughout much of East Texas (Middlebrook and Perttula 1997), supporting the broad
findings of the radiocarbon dates from the region.
Caddo sites of Formative to Middle Caddo period age are situated primarily on elevated landforms
(alluvial terraces and rises, natural levees, and upland edges) adjacent to the major streams, as well as
along minor tributaries and spring-fed branches. Proximity to arable sandy loam soils was preferred for
settlement locations, presumably because of good drainage for habitation and for cultivation purposes.
The majority of these Caddo sites are permanent settlements where posts, pits, and other features provide
evidence of structures. Cemeteries and graves where the dead were buried are present, as are middens
containing animal and plant food refuse along with broken stone tools and pottery vessels. Material remains
of tools and ceramics signify usage in the procurement and processing of the bountiful resources of the
region. These sites represent the settlements of Caddo communities and sociopolitical entities, and the
civic-ceremonial centers that were their focus (Perttula 1993:125).
The distribution of Caddo settlements across the landscape suggests that all habitats were used to
some extent, either intensively as locations for the sedentary communities and farmsteads (that may have
been occupied for single or multiple generations), or periodically by groups in logistical camps where
specific natural resources could be procured in bulk. Along the Red River, and probably on the other
large streams or rivers in the region, a particular focus of settlement was along natural levees in recently
abandoned meander belts, and these habitats “served as an ideal context for a dispersed community” in a
major floodplain landscape (Girard 1997:156).
The most common types of Caddo settlements in the region during these times appear to have been
small year-round hamlets and farmsteads with circular to rectangular structures (Clark and Ivey 1974;
Bruseth 1998; Bruseth and Perttula 1981; Cliff 1997; Middlebrook 1994, 1997; Perttula and Nelson 2003;

16

Rogers and Perttula 2004; Thurmond 1990). These settlements sometimes occur in association with small
household cemeteries (see Goldschmidt 1935; Middlebrook and Perttula 1997), and occasionally with a
larger cemetery (> 10 burials).
Larger communities (covering more than 10 acres) have also been recognized that occur in association
with mound centers (such as the large settlements at George C. Davis [41CE19], Hale [41TT12], Boxed
Springs [41UR30], and Hudnall-Pirtle [41RK4; see Bruseth 1991; Bruseth and Perttula 2006]). These mound
centers have extensive habitation areas, plazas, and spatially restricted temple and burial mound locales.
Shaft burials of high-status individuals have been documented in mound contexts at the George C. Davis
site (Story 1997, 1998, 2000) and a few other mound centers (such as Washington Square [41NA49)], Boxed
Springs, and Sanders [41LR2]; see Corbin and Hart 1998; Hamilton 1997), and they also occur in non-mound
contexts at several sites along the Red River during Formative period (see Bruseth 1998).
Certainly the most thoroughly studied Formative and Early Caddo period site in the region is the
George C. Davis site, a large village and mound center on the Neches River. Recent investigations using
remote sensing indicate more than 100 structures in the village areas around the three mounds at the site
(Creel et al. 2005; Walker 2009). Calibrated radiocarbon dates from village contexts establish that the site
was occupied beginning by the mid-ninth century A.D., and that it was continuously settled to the end of
the thirteenth century A.D. (Story 2000). A large number of structures were built on and adjacent to Mound
A, and the extensive structure rebuilding there indicates the area was preferred for settlement by the
Caddo. Calibrated dates from a few contexts suggest that the site was inhabited to some degree as late as
approximately A.D. 1350 (see Story 1997). There were three mounds at the Davis site, including Mound A
(a flat-topped platform), Mound C (burial mound) built over a large pre-mound burial pit in the latter part
of the Formative Caddo period and containing an estimated 25–30 elite burial pits, and Mound B (a second
flat-topped platform) constructed about A.D. 1200 or slightly earlier (Story 1997, 1998).
One of the more significant non-mound Caddo sites investigated in the Pineywoods, the Oak Hill
Village (41RK214), estimated to date approximately A.D. 1150–1450, contains at least 42 circular and
rectangular structures. Some of the structures had been rebuilt and some overlapped earlier structures,
particularly at the northwestern end of the ridge and plaza, and they were arranged over the 3.5-acre
village in a circular pattern around a central plaza area (Rogers and Perttula 2004; Perttula and Rogers
2007). Several small structures on the eastern side of the plaza have been identified as possible granaries
for the storage of harvested corn. A small mound (covering a burned circular structure) is at the north end
of the site, and several midden deposits have been identified that appear to be associated with individual
structures. Two large circular structures have extended entranceways that pointed towards the plaza, and
their special form and orientation suggests that they were probably public buildings used by the Oak Hill
Village community for special purposes. Ceramic analyses and radiocarbon dating indicate these structures
were built after approximately A.D. 1350 during the extensive Late Village (Rogers and Perttula 2004;
Perttula and Rogers 2007).
The Musgano site (41RK19) is also a Middle Caddo habitation site that was located on an upland
landform not far from Martin Creek, and is now an island in Martin Creek Lake. This site covered
approximately five acres and had at least one circular structure, midden deposits, numerous pits (including
two with charred corncobs), and an extensive ceramic and faunal assemblage (Clark and Ivey 1974).
One area of features to the east of the one excavated circular structure appears to mark an above-ground

17

granary (built on stilts), with smoky fire pits under it. (The feature was filled with charred corncobs, which
would have produced a large amount of smoke when set on fire.)
Another important site of the Middle Caddo period is Tyson (41SY92), located in the Attoyac River
basin, dated cal A.D. 1336–1490. This settlement contains evidence for structures and cooking and storage
pit features, contains extensive midden deposits and well-preserved plant and animal remains, and a small
cemetery of children. Middlebrook (1994, 1997) suggests that the Tyson site represents the residence of a
caddi or chiefly elite.
One of the calibrated dates from the Tyson site was from mussel shell included as grave goods with
Feature 14, the burial of a 3- to 4-yr-old child accompanied by many grave goods (Middlebrook 1994:16).
Among the burial offerings were eight ceramic vessels near the head and feet of the child, two large paired
deer antlers over the child’s head (perhaps as part of a headdress), carved shell inlays near the head, two
carved bone ear spools, 32 olivella shell beads, three columnella beads from a necklace, a turtle rattle, a
cache of mussel shell, smoothed stones, two pitted stones, a cache of six deer ulna awls and two beaver
teeth, and a cache of lithic pebble cores, flakes, preforms, and a notched shell point (Middlebrook 1994:16).
These groups from the Formative through Middle Caddo periods seem to have been horticulturists,
cultivating maize and squash, along with several kinds of native seeds (Perttula and Bruseth 1983). They
gathered nuts and roots and tubers that could be stored and were proficient hunters of deer, fish, and many
other animal species. The available paleobotanical and bioarcheological evidence (including stable carbon
isotopes on human remains) from East Texas (and elsewhere in the Caddo archeological area, including
the upper Neches River basin; see Rose et al. 1998) does not indicate however that Caddo groups became
dependent upon maize and other domesticated crops until after about A.D. 1300. By approximately A.D.
1450, maize likely made up more than 50 percent of the diet (see Burnett 1990; Perttula 1996; Rose et al.
1998). Certain prehistoric groups who lived in the Trinity River basin in north central and east central Texas
(outside of East Texas) and who interacted with the Caddo living in the Neches River basin, also cultivated
plants, but these plants appear “to have been incorporated into an existing subsistence system at a
supplemental level…growing of crops…simply offered another source of foodstuffs” (Gadus et al. 2002:141).
Both temple and burial mounds were built by these Pineywoods Caddo groups. The larger sites
are important civic-ceremonial centers containing multiple mounds and associated villages, and these
generally date after approximately A.D. 900. The multiple mound centers are rather evenly spaced along
the Red River, Sabine River, and Big Cypress Bayou, and those that are contemporaneous may represent
hierarchical systems of an “integrated . . . regional network of interaction and redistribution” (Thurmond
1990:234). The Jamestown (eight mounds and village), Boxed Springs (four mounds, village, and large
cemetery), and Hudnall-Pirtle (eight mounds and 60-acre village) multiple mound centers appear to
represent the apex of postulated local Early–Middle Caddoan networks in the Sabine River basin. The
McKenzie (41WD55) site in the middle Sabine River drainage has a single substructural mound that dates
cal A.D. 1298–1470 (see Granberry 1995), and there are contemporaneous mounds covering structures with
extended entranceways at the Redwine (41SM193) and Bryan Hardy (41SM55) sites (see Walters et al. 1998;
Walters and Haskins 2000). The Middle Caddo occupation at Redwine also included an extensive midden
deposit, hearth and pit features and a small cemetery with extended supine burials.
The distribution, number, and spacing of mound centers, particularly the sites with multiple mounds, in
East Texas and adjoining parts of southwestern Arkansas and northwestern Louisiana attest that the Caddo

18

peoples who built and used these mounds were integrated into societies of considerable sociopolitical
complexity. The premier mound centers in the Neches-Angelina river basins include George C. Davis and
Washington Square (Story 1997; Corbin and Hart 1998). The Washington Square mound complex is welldated, with pooled radiocarbon dates on charcoal, hardwood nutshells, and charred corn ranging between
cal AD 1268 and 1302 (Corbin and Hart 1998:74 and Table 4); the overall range of the calibrated dates
from the site suggest it was occupied by the Caddo between approximately A.D. 1250 and 1450. Extensive
excavations documented a circular structure under Mound 1/2, an assortment of pits and postholes in
non-mound contexts, and several large burial pits in a mortuary mound (the Reavely-House Mound). No
clear evidence for on-site permanent Caddo habitation was identified at Washington Square, although an
interesting assortment of large sherd-filled pits (representing many vessels) were encountered in one area
between Mound 1/2 and the mortuary mound (see Corbin and Hart 1998:Figure 14). These may represent
deposits from public feasting activities led by the Caddo elite (e.g., Scott and Jackson 1998) who used the
Washington Square mound site as a ceremonial center in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.
The radiocarbon dating of the Washington Square and George C. Davis sites hints at the possibility that
the Washington Square Mound center began to flourish about the time (after ca. A.D. 1250) the George C.
Davis site was diminishing in power and social authority. These temporally coincident occurrences suggest
that the Caddo community who built and used the Washington Square Mound site—more advantageously
located eastward at the nexus of aboriginal trails running north-south (later to be known as the Caddo trace)
and east-west (later known as the Camino Real)—achieved preeminence at the expense of the long-lasting
polity on the Neches River. The George C. Davis site was abandoned by the early fourteenth century.
The Formative, Early, and Middle Caddo period groups possessed a rich material culture. Well-made,
corner-notched, and rectangular-stemmed arrow points were common, along with siltstone and greenstone
celts, perforators and borers, large Gahagan bifaces, and a variety of more expedient stone tools (unifacial
flake scraping and cutting implements). Long-stemmed Red River (Hoffman 1967) and cigar-shaped
ceramic pipes were made by the Caddo at this time, as were ceramic ear spools and figurines (see Newell
and Krieger 1949).
The most distinctive material culture item of the Caddo groups living in East Texas were the ceramics
made as cooking, storage, and serving vessels. The styles and forms of ceramics found on sites in the
region hint at the variety, temporal span, and geographic extent of a number of prehistoric Caddo groups
spread across the landscape. The diversity in decoration and shape in Caddo ceramics is substantial, both
in the utility-ware jars and bowls, and in the fine ware bottles, carinated bowls, and compound vessels.
This diverse and distinctive ceramic assemblage characterizes the Caddo ceramics throughout the region,
occurring quite commonly in domestic contexts on habitation sites as well as in mortuary contexts where
they appear as grave goods.
The Caddo made ceramics in a wide variety of vessel shapes, with many well-executed body and
rim designs and surface treatments. An impressive diversity of vessel forms are present among the Caddo
fine wares, including carinated bowls, deep compound bowls, double and triple vessels (joined bowls and
bottles [Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plates 38k, 51e, 59d]), bottles, ollas, zoomorphic and anthropomorphic effigy
bowls and bottles, ladles, platters, peaked jars, gourd and box-shaped bowls, and chalices. Based on the
archeological contexts in which they have been found and inferences about their manufacture and use, it
is evident that ceramics were important to the prehistoric Caddo as functional items in which foods were

19

cooked, served and stored and as personal possessions, for their beauty as works of art and craftsmanship
(i.e., some vessels were clearly made never to be used in domestic contexts). In some cases, ceramics
probably functioned as social identifiers, with certain shared and distinctive stylistic motifs and decorative
patterns marking closely related communities and constituent groups.
The Caddo produced fine wares (with very finely crushed temper) shaped into bottles and many
different bowl forms as well as utility wares (simple bowl forms and jars of various sizes). Almost all Caddo
ceramics were tempered with grog (crushed sherds) or bone, although burned and crushed shells were
used as temper after approximately A.D. 1300 among most of the Red River Caddo groups and later at sites
in the lower and upper Sulphur River basin. Grog-tempered pottery was the norm throughout most of the
Sabine River basin. After adding the temper to the clay, the kneaded clay was formed into clay coils that
were added to flat disk bases to form the vessel, and the coils were apparently smoothed with a round river
pebble to create the finished vessel form. Decorations and slips were added either before or after baking
in an open fire. Vessels were then commonly burnished and polished. Red ochre and white kaolinite clay
pigments were often added to or smeared onto the decorations on bottles and carinated bowls. Ceramics
were designed to serve different functions within Caddo communities and family groups—from everyday
cooking pot to ceremonial mortuary beaker—and the differences are reflected in differences in paste,
surface treatment, firing methods, decoration, and vessel form that distinguished fine wares and utility
wares.
Other types of ceramic artifacts manufactured by prehistoric Caddo groups include ceramic ear spools
and disks, figurines, and various pipe forms (Jackson 1933:71). The earliest types of Caddo clay pipes were
plain, tubular and cigar-shaped forms, followed by the long-stem “Red River” pipes (Hoffman 1967) with
burnished and polished stems and bowls; rectangular platform pipes and some elbow pipe forms have also
been recovered in Caddo sites dating before A.D. 1200 (see Bruseth and Perttula 1981; Rogers and Perttula
2004:Figure 120). The later Caddo pipe forms in Northeast Texas are biconical and elbow pipe forms with
small bowls (< 25 mm) and small stem diameters (< 25 mm) (see Jackson 1933:Plates 16–18).

Late Caddo period
Late Caddo period settlements (ca. A.D. 1400–1680) in much of the Pineywoods and Post Oak Savanna
of East Texas have been termed rural Caddo community systems (Perttula 1992:96) because they were
distributed along secondary streams, were widely dispersed, and consisted primarily of functionally
comparable farmsteads and hamlets. Similar kinds of rural communities occur throughout much of the
Caddo area (Story 1982, 1990; Jeter et al. 1989).
Only a small number of Late Caddo period mounds are known in the region, ranging from one to
four small mounds per site, and they are unlike the types of mound complexes typically constructed in the
major river valleys at this time (Story 1990). Pineywoods mounds were substructural mounds; no pyramidal
platform or burial mounds are known for this time period. Substructural mounds are generally restricted
to mounds that cap a burned circular structure constructed on the ground surface or in a small, shallow pit.
In at least two instances, the mounds contained sequent structures, but the “structures originated at higher
levels in the mound[s] due to occupational accumulations of soil and ash, and not the result of any deliberate
capping” (Thurmond 1990:168).

20

The larger Caddo “towns” were distributed along the major river valleys, such as the Red, Ouachita,
and Little. These communities were hierarchically arranged with civic-ceremonial centers (those with
platform and burial mounds), associated “towns” of linear but dispersed farmstead compounds with
several structures, bark- or brush-covered shelters and storage platforms (Schambach 1983:7–8), hamlets,
farmsteads, and specialized processing and/or procurement locales (such as salt-making sites, see Early
1993).
The later Caddo fine wares are stylistically diverse, and there are very specific differences in vessel
shapes, designs, and decorative attributes between Caddo ceramics in individual drainages, or even within
specific smaller segments of river and creek basins (e.g., Thurmond 1990; Perttula et al. 1998). This diversity
can be reasonably interpreted to represent specific Caddo social groups. In historic Caddo times, ceramic
vessel forms and decorations are considerably more homogeneous across much of the Caddoan area,
suggesting extensive intra-regional contact between contemporaneous Caddo groups (Perttula 1992:154
and Table 14).

Historic Caddo period and entry of Immigrant Indians
New assessments of the route of the de Soto-Moscoso 1542–1543 entrada through East Texas (Bruseth 1992;
Hudson 1997; Kenmotsu et al. 1993; Schambach 1989; Thurmond 1990) indicate that the Spanish entrada
encountered several different groups of Caddo peoples from the Red River south to the Nacogdoches area,
although the exact route has not yet been determined. Hudson (1997:Map 8) suggests that once the entrada
entered Texas—probably in the vicinity of Texarkana—that the Spaniards and their Caddo guides were
traveling along a definite aboriginal trail that extended from the Red River southwest into East Texas. The
Caddo guides attempted at first to deceive the Spaniards, leading them away from the trails and known
villages, but were later executed for these acts when Moscoso discovered he was being misled (Hudson
1997:368).
From Nondacao in the Sabine River basin, which was a prosperous Caddo community where “one
could find plenty of corn” (Hudson 1997:365), Moscoso and his men visited Soacatino, possibly in the upper
Neches River basin, where corn was scarce, before reaching Guasco on the Neches River, probably near
the Caddo trail crossing (now known as the Camino Real) at the George C. Davis site. The Caddo people in
Guasco had plenty of corn as well as turquoise and shawls of cotton obtained in trade with Southwestern
groups. Hearing of reports by the Caddo of other Spaniards in the area, the entrada moved south or
southeast to the Caddo provinces of Naquiscoza and Nazacahoz. Hudson (1997:369–370) and Kenmotsu et
al. (1993:Illustration 24 and 25) agree that these Caddo provinces were in the Angelina River basin in the
vicinity of the modern community of Nacogdoches. The entrada penetrated no farther south or east, but did
move west to the River of Daycao, probably the modern Brazos River (Hudson 1977: Map 8).
It is possible that European diseases were introduced to the Caddo groups living in the East Texas
Pineywoods by members of the de Soto-Moscoso entrada (Perttula 1992:27–28), but no evidence is
currently available in the archeological or bioarcheological records to substantiate this hypothesis. While
it is suspected that the abandonment of certain parts of the Pineywoods in the early to late seventeenth
centuries as seen in the archeological record may be a product of population loss, much more archeological
investigations at well-dated sites is needed to substantiate disease as the primary contributing factor.

21

However, by the late seventeenth century, Hasinai and Kadohadaco Caddo groups in East Texas had been
exposed to European epidemic diseases (Derrick and Wilson 2001; Ewers 1973; Perttula 1992, 1996;
Swanton 1942), which led eventually to massive depopulation (probably 75–90 percent or more) among
these Pineywoods groups by the early part of the nineteenth century.
The first establishment of a Spanish mission among the Hasinai Caddo tribes occurred in 1690. The
impetus for this mission was reports of French expeditions and explorations of the area. A second mission
was established nearby the following year, but both missions proved unsuccessful and were abandoned in
1693 (Richardson 1958). Renewed French interest in the area resulted in the establishment of six Spanish
missions and one presidio within the Hasinai Caddo nation in 1716 and 1717, in the Neches and Angelina
river basins. The Spanish again abandoned the East Texas missions in 1719 and withdrew to San Antonio due
to a perceived threat of French invasion of the area (Faulk 1965). The Spanish then reestablished six missions
in East Texas in 1721, eventually founding Los Adaes (now in Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana) as the capital
of the Spanish province of Tejas (Perttula 1992). The missions were again abandoned for the final time in
1773 (Chipman 1992). Four years later, Spanish settlers returned to East Texas and rebuilt the settlement of
Nacogdoches (Carlson and Corbin 1999).
In historic times, the archeology of the East Texas Caddo groups living along the middle reaches of
the Sabine River and its tributaries have been included in the Kinsloe phase, dated approximately A.D.
1650–1800 or later. Late eighteenth to early nineteenth century Nadaco or Anadarko Caddo sites have
been reported along the Sabine River in the Potters Creek area, along trail crossings of this stream (Jones
1968; Clark and Ivey 1974). The Kinsloe phase Caddo groups were part of what has come to be called the
Hasinai confederacy (Swanton 1942). Kinsloe phase sites are small dispersed settlements with associated
cemeteries. Their material culture included grog-tempered plainware vessels, Simms Engraved carinated
bowls, Natchitoches Engraved bowls and bottles, and a punctated-incised utility-ware jar that closely
resembles Emory Punctated-Incised, plus trade vessels from other Caddo groups (Perttula 2007). There are
also ceramic elbow pipes, triangular arrow points, chipped knives, gunflints (both native and European),
as well as a variety of goods obtained from Europeans, among them glass beads, muskets, lead balls, axes,
ornaments, and kettles.
Excavations at the Deshazo site (41NA13), the best studied historic Caddo settlement in East Texas
(Story 1982, 1995), indicates it was a small centralized hamlet of an affiliated group with a series of circular
structures and an associated household or family cemetery. Most sites were apparently occupied for only
short periods of time, perhaps an average of 20 to 40 years, based on an analysis of structure rebuilding
episodes at the Deshazo site (Good 1982:67–69).
While a single farmstead may have only included one or two structures, Caddo communities were
apparently composed of many farmsteads spread out over a considerable distance. In 1687, in the
community of Nabedache Caddo (one of the Hasinai groups) on San Pedro Creek in Houston County, Henri
Joutel noted:
we took the path to the village where the Indians conducted us to the chief’s hut which was a long league’s
distance from the entrance to the village. On the way, we passed several huts that were grouped in hamlets;
there were seven or eight of them, each with twelve to fifteen huts together with space between each other
and fields around the huts. (Foster 1998:206)

22

Morfi (1935:87) further commented (based on earlier missionary reports) that in 1716, the Nacogdoche
Indians were “divided into 22 rancherias . . . which spread for a distance of 10 leagues from South to North.”
Individual Hasinai Caddo families lived in their farmsteads, several of which have been archeologically
investigated in Nacogdoches County (Story 1982, 1995; Kenmotsu 1992), and a number of farmsteads were
organized into rancherias spread out over about 15 to 30 leagues (about 40 to 80 miles). Each rancheria was
separated from the others by unoccupied lands (see Foster 1998:208) and hunting territory.
There are other clusters of historic Caddo archeological sites in East Texas. First among these are
Allen phase components in the Neches and Angelina river basins in Cherokee, Anderson, Houston, Rusk,
and Nacogdoches counties (see Cole 1975; Kenmotsu 1992; Perttula and Nelson 2006, 2007; Story 1982,
1995). These usually contain small amounts of European trade goods found in village and burial contexts.
Caddo domestic remains at these settlements included a variety of decorated and plain ceramic fine
wares (principally Patton Engraved) and utility wares, usually bone-tempered and with brushed vessel
bodies, triangular and stemmed arrow points, elbow pipes (plain and decorated), ground stone tools,
and bone tools. These Caddo groups were successful agriculturists. Next is a series of probable early
eighteenth century Nasoni Caddo sites on the lower Sulphur River (Dickinson 1941; Harris et al. 1980;
Lewis 1987), along a known trade portage. Along the Red River in Bowie County, there are archeological
remains of Nasoni Caddo and other Kadohadacho tribes that lived in the area until the late 1780s (Miroir
et al. 1973; Gilmore 1986; Wedel 1978); the French built a trading post in the early eighteenth century at
the main Nasoni village, probably the Roseborough Lake site (41BW5). In the upper Sabine River basin,
the Gilbert and Pearson sites (Duffield and Jelks 1961; Jelks 1967) were occupied primarily in the mid- to
late-eighteenth century, apparently by Caddo groups who were heavily involved in the fur trade (Perttula
1992:173, 256).
Other Native American groups eventually immigrated to East Texas. In the 1780s, a group of Koasati
(Coushatta), former members of the Creek Confederacy, settled here after moving from above presentday Shreveport on the Red River (Gadus and Howard 1989; Hook 1997; Martin 2001; Swanton 1946). Various
bands of the Choctaw had also moved into the region by 1830 (Carlisle 2001; McKee 1989). Cherokee were
first reported in northeast Texas in 1807 (Lipscomb 2001a; Perdue 1989) with nearly 400 Cherokee settled
in the region north of Nacogdoches by 1830 (Cliff and Sills 2004). These migrations were followed by the
Delawares around 1820 (Lipscomb 2001b), the Shawnees in 1822 (Lipscomb 2001c), and the Kickapoos
in the early 1800s (Nunley 2001). Following the signing of the Caddo Treaty of 1835, Caddo groups from
northwestern Louisiana were forced to settle in Texas or Indian Territory (Flores 1984; Lange 1974; Neuman
1974; Smith 1995; Swanton 1946; Williams 1974). Until the early nineteenth century, much of Rusk County
was largely populated by the Caddo, Cherokee, and Shawnees tribes, and remained generally unsettled by
Europeans.
Most of the Shawnee and Cherokee were removed from this area of Texas following the Cherokee War
of 1839, opening the area for white settlement. The establishment of the First United Methodist Church of
Henderson in 1842 as part of the Shawnee mission (THC n.d.) suggests that some Shawnee remained in
the area following the Cherokee War. Following Texas statehood, remaining Caddos and Shawnee were
removed to a reservation on the upper Brazos River in 1855 (Arnold 2007) and then forcibly moved to the
Indian Territory (Oklahoma) in 1859 (Lipscomb 2001a, 2001b, 2001c).

23

Anglo-American, post-1830s History
The first Anglo-American settlers from the United States entered into East Texas during the Mexican
period. The empresario system of colonization was first implemented with Stephen F. Austin’s recruitment
of immigrants from the United States in 1821. Immigration to Texas soared with the granting of twenty-five
empresarios by 1825. Despite Mexican restrictions on immigration, the flow of new settlers to the region
continued to grow. By 1835 an estimated 20,000 Anglo-Americans and their slaves were in Texas. Settlement
in East Texas concentrated in the vicinity of Nacogdoches and San Augustine (Moncure 1984). Daniel Martin,
for whom Martin Creek was named, received a half-league grant in Rusk County and settled his family of
eight in the area of Hogan’s Bayou in 1833 (see also Dockall et al. [2009:38–46] for historical background
details on the Anglo- and African-American settlement of Rusk County).
Following the Battle of San Jacinto and the establishment of the Republic of Texas, immigrants continued
to be attracted to the new Republic of Texas by offers of large land grants. The constitution of 1836 granted
extensive headrights to all who were in Texas at the time of the declaration of independence from Mexico.
Heads of families entering Texas between March 2, 1836, and October 1, 1837, were allowed 1,280 acres,
and single men received 640 acres. Grants were also given for military service, service at the Battle of
San Jacinto, or a variety of other services or for residence on and improvements of lands. The Cherokee
Wars began in July 1839 as a result of an attempt to dispossess the Cherokee of their lands north of the San
Antonio Road and west of the Angelina and Sabine rivers. The burning of Cherokee and Caddo villages led
to Indian raids on Anglo-American settlements. As a result of these raids, Daniel Martin and John Irons built
a small fort, which later became known as Martin’s Creek (Clark and Ivey 1974). Following the Cherokee
wars, the Cherokee treaty lands opened to Anglo-American settlement. Large plantations with numerous
slaves were established in Rusk County along major streams and roads, while dispersed hamlets of 10–12
farmstead clusters occurred in areas away from major streams where wells could be dug (Jackson 1982).
The community of Harmony Hill emerged following Texas statehood in 1846 (see Dockall et al. 2009:52–
53). According to local tradition, the community began as a rural settlement called Nip-n-Tuck established
on the northwest corner of Daniel Martin’s half-league at the intersection of the Henderson–Shreveport and
Camden roads (Clark and Ivey 1974). The western portion of Martin’s league was sold to Leonard Tomlinson
in May 1849 and, in February 1853, John Kuykendall was designated as title holder of the tract, although the
land was not officially deeded to Kuykendall until March 27, 1854 (Clark and Ivey 1974). Kuykendall laid out
the township, divided it into lots, and began selling sections in 1855. No mention is made of any previously
existing structures in the original deeds (Clark and Ivey 1974). By 1860 there were eight to ten stores, a
post office (which was in service between 1854 and 1905), a small furniture factory, a blacksmith shop, two
churches, a Masonic hall, and a school in addition to several houses (Winfrey 1961). At least one gin mill, a
grist mill, and a saw mill were in operation in the area prior to the Civil War in addition to a shoe shop and a
wheelwright’s shop (Farmer 1951).
Following the Civil War the community of Harmony Hills entered its most prosperous period,
culminating in the mid-1880s, when the population peaked at about 100 citizens and the town had three
churches, four steam cotton gins, three gristmills, and a district school (Clark and Ivey 1974). Businesses in
town included three mercantile stores, a drugstore, and a saloon (Farmer 1951). In the 1890s the primary
economic activity in the area was agriculture. Primary crops included cotton, corn, oats, hay, and potatoes.

24

Fruit orchards, especially peach, also became numerous (Richardson 1940). Before construction of the
railway, Harmony Hill enjoyed an advantageous location on the major routes between Rusk County and
markets not far to the east in Shreveport. The community sharply declined following the establishment of
the Longview and Sabine Valley Railway across the northeast corner of the county and as Tatum became
the commercial center of the county (Dockall et al. 2009:53). By 1900, the town of Harmony Hills was all
but abandoned, with only a few families residing there. A tornado destroyed most of the town’s buildings
in 1906, and no interest was shown in rebuilding (Farmer 1951; Winfrey 1961). By 1939, only three houses
constructed prior to the Civil War still stood in the abandoned town. During Clark and Ivey’s survey in 1972,
only one of these houses remained, and it was used as a storage shed (McDonald 1972; Clark and Ivey 1974).

Previous Investigations in the Martin Creek Lake State Park Area
The construction of the Martin Lake Steam Electric Station in Rusk and Panola Counties initiated
archeological investigations of the area in 1972 (McDonald 1972; Clark and Ivey 1974). During the
initial phase of investigations, 41 sites were identified, 20 of which were recommended for additional
investigations (Clark and Ivey 1974), leading eventually to the recording of another nine sites. During this
series of archeological investigations, the community of Harmony Hills (adjacent to and extending into the
current project area) was initially examined. The historic community of Harmony Hills was nominated to the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on September 29, 1975 and certified as a NRHP District on May
13, 1976.
The 1972 Clark and Ivey (1974; see also McDonald 1972) survey identified and/or investigated seven
sites located within the current boundaries of the Park: 41RK9, 41RK43, 41RK66, 41RK67, 41RK69, 41RK71,
and 41RK133. Two additional sites, 41RK466 and 41RK467, were identified during a 1996 survey by Stephen
F. Austin State University Anthropology Laboratory. (These site locations are shown on the map in Appendix
1. No report is available from this survey.)

Methods of Archeological Survey
CAS proposed to conduct the cultural resources inventory survey at the Park following guidelines
established by the Texas Historical Commission (THC), the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA), and
TPWD. Both pedestrian survey and intensive shovel testing were employed in the completion of the
investigations.
Before beginning the survey, the Park’s 287 acres was divided into areas of high, moderate, and
low probability (within the Park itself) for containing sites (Figure 4). Each area was then systematically
surveyed by following pedestrian transect lines spaced approximately 30 m apart, following the trend and
slope of landforms. High probability areas were to be sampled by shovel test units (ST) excavated at a rate
of at least three (3) ST per acre. Moderate probability areas were to be sampled at a rate of one (1) ST per
acre, and low probability areas were to sampled at a rate of one (1) ST per every three acres. The projected
rates of Park coverage are indicated in Table 1.

As shown in Table 1, no fewer than 268 shovel test units were to be excavated at the Park, at a rate of
0.9 shovel tests per acre across the Park as a whole. In actuality, a total of 423 shovel tests were excavated in
the different probability areas and on sites in the Park (Figure 5 and Appendix 2), resulting in a rate of 1.48
shovel tests per acre; in high probability areas, for example, 4.0 shovel tests were excavated per acre. The
breakdown of shovel tests excavated in each of the probability areas is provided in Table 2. Only 36 of the
excavated shovel tests (8.5 percent) in the Park contained prehistoric and/or historic artifacts.

Shovel test units were to be excavated to a maximum of 1 m in depth, or until bedrock or the clay
B-horizon subsoil layers were reached. Soils were screened through a 1/4-inch mesh screen to recover any
artifacts in the soil matrix; all cultural materials were collected from the shovel tests that produced artifacts.
Soil descriptions and materials recovered were noted in standardized shovel test forms (see Appendix

29

are low probability (in brown) Park areas.

2). All shovel test locations were recorded with a handheld GPS unit with sub-meter accuracy. Temporally
diagnostic artifacts encountered on the surface during pedestrian survey were to have been collected and
their locations also recorded with the GPS, although none were encountered during the survey.
The purpose of the archeological survey was to identify and spatially locate any prehistoric and
historic sites in the Park, including sites that had been previously recorded. Shovel test units were excavated
in a cruciform or grid pattern around a positive shovel test unit until the area was delimited by two negative
shovel test units in each direction. No fewer than eight shovel test units were excavated on each site unless
the site extended beyond the Park boundaries; shovel testing halted at the Park boundary.
All site locations were recorded with a handheld GPS unit with sub-meter accuracy and all data was
transferred to a GIS format. GPS data were exported into an ESRI Shapefile. A centroid and site boundaries
were recorded for each site. Additional GPS data obtained included the locations of all shovel tests,
archeological features, structures and buildings, and any other elements related to the investigations.
All GIS data created are in a Spatial Data Standards (SDS) and have Federal Geographic Data Committee
(FGDG) compliant metadata. The projection of the GIS data is in UTM zone 14 North and datum NAD83.
Digital photography was used to document all sites in the Park. At minimum, this included two
general overviews of each site illustrating the site setting (terrain, vegetation, etc.). Additional photos of
survey work, buildings and structures, and any other relevant features are also included. A “contact sheet”
or thumbnails of all digital photographs has been submitted to TPWD. A photo log was maintained and
completed in the field and a photo log database was created to serve as a final deliverable to TPWD in a
digital format as well as archived with other project records at TPWD.
The context, depth, extent, and artifact content of all sites were to be obtained through pedestrian
survey and shovel testing. Only buildings and structures greater than 45 years old were to be documented
during the survey investigations. Documentation included sketch maps, photographs, and GPS location
coordinates. All sites that had been recorded more than five years ago within the project area were also
resurveyed and accurately mapped, so as to be able to describe and characterize their current conditions.
Sketch maps were created for each identified/revisited historic and/or archeological site and accompanied
the TexSite Archeological Site Data Form submissions. Maps include magnetic north, scale, visible features,
shovel test locations, roads, streams, or landforms that would aid in relocating the sites, and were present
at specific sites. Sites were plotted on 7.5-minute Series USGS quadrangles, along with the centroid and
estimated site boundary. Texas Archeological Site Data forms, including update forms, were submitted in
TXSITE database and paper forms to the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory. Original field site forms
have been submitted to the TPWD.
Upon the accidental discovery of human remains, work was to be halted and CAS would notify the
TPWD Cultural Resources Coordinator immediately via telephone and e-mail. Care would be taken not to
disturb any remains encountered. No human remains were encountered during the present archeological
survey.
The analysis of the recovered prehistoric and historic artifacts from the Park sites followed standard
approaches in the identification of the age and presumed function of both prehistoric and nineteenth and
twentieth century material culture found on sites in East Texas. The few prehistoric artifacts (all chipped
stone) that were recovered in the shovel testing and 50-×-50-cm units (see below) were separated into

32

categories of unmodified lithic debris and chipped stone tools. The unmodified lithic debris was divided
into cortical or non-cortical pieces, and further categorized as complete flakes (with bulbs of percussion) or
flake fragments. Among the chipped stone tools, categories were recognized for dart point and arrow point.
Dart points are large bifacially worked hafted tools with pointed distal ends and were probably mounted
and propelled on an atlatl and spear. Arrow points are small (typically less than 5 cm in length), bilaterally
symmetrical artifacts with a pointed distal end and some facility for hafting at the proximal end. Typological
and chronological estimations for the recovered dart and arrow points follow Turner and Hester (1999) and
Story (1990:Figure 32).
Historic artifacts were sorted into broad classes by material culture categories—ceramics (refined
earthenwares and stonewares), glass (bottles and fruit jars, as well as snuff and window glass), and metal—
and further sorted by apparent function, such as clothing items (buttons), agricultural tools and implements,
food and liquid containers and food serving ware (most of the bottle and jar glass and recovered sherds
of whiteware, ironstone, and several kinds of stoneware), and architectural items (nails, bricks, and asphalt
shingles). Establishing the ages of the historic artifacts—and the estimated age of the historic archeological
components at the sites—is primarily based on Majewski and O’Brien (1987) for the plain and decorated
refined earthenwares; Greer (1981) and Lebo (1987) for stonewares; the Society for Historic Archaeology
(2010) for glass bottles and jars; Meissner (1997) for buttons; Wells (2000) and Adams (2002) for square cut
and wire nails; and Moir (1987, 1988) for window glass, based on changes in pane thickness.
All artifacts collected during investigations will be processed and prepared for final curation according
to the standards of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department Archeology Laboratory. Artifacts will be
temporarily curated at CAS with final curation to be at TPWD.

Results of the Archeological Survey
During the 2010 archeological survey in the Park, four previously recorded archeological sites (41RK66,
41RK69, 41RK71, and 41RK467) were relocated and shovel tested, and 50-×-50- cm units were excavated at
each of them. Four new sites (41RK605–608) were also identified and recorded in the Park, and, except for
41RK608 (segments of the Old Henderson Road), shovel tests and 50-×-50-cm units were also excavated at
each of them. Three other previously recorded sites—41RK9, 41RK43, and 41RK466—could not be relocated.
Site 41RK466 may be currently under water; 41RK9 may have been originally misplotted; and 41RK43
was probably destroyed or covered by a Park parking lot. Three other sites, two previously recorded
(41RK67 and 41RK133) and one new historic road (41RK608), were simply documented and photographed.
Archeological investigations were not warranted at these three sites because one historic site with
preserved archeological deposits is protected within an overgrown but fenced thicket of brush and vines
and had previously been the subject of test excavations (41RK67, see Davis et al. 1994), and the other two
are historic features—a bridge remnant (41RK133) and an old roadbed (41RK608)—without archeological
deposits.
Of the 13 sites that have been recorded and investigated at various times within the boundaries of
the Park, seven (41RK43, 41RK66, 41RK67, 41RK69, 41RK71, 41RK133, and 41RK608) have only historic
components. Another four sites (41RK9, 41RK467, 41RK606, and 41RK607) have historic components as
well as very sparse evidence of prehistoric occupations during Late Archaic, Woodland, and Caddo
periods. All the Martin Creek Lake State Park historic sites appear to be associated with the abandoned
town of Harmony Hill, although the Harmony Hill Baptist Church (41RK66) was apparently built and used
after the town was abandoned. The final two sites (41RK466 and 41RK605) have undetermined prehistoric
occupations. The sparse distribution of prehistoric sites or components in the Park area is likely the
consequence of the limited distribution of permanent water sources in upland areas. Dockall et al.
(2009:227) noted the same low density of prehistoric sites in upland areas in the nearby Rusk Permit Area,
commenting that “[w]ith springs present but not frequent along and at the heads of intermittent, mostly
runoff-fed drainages, this area lacks places that would have been suitable for intensive occupation by
Native Americans. The few sites that are present are associated with these drainages, but all are sparse lithic
scatters reflecting limited use.”

Extent of Disturbances within the Park
Numerous disturbances, both natural and modern in origin, are apparent across the Martin Creek Lake State
Park lands (Figure 6). These disturbances have hampered the search for and identification of previously
recorded sites as well as unrecorded archeological sites in the Park. Most of the disturbances are apparently
associated with the construction of Martin Creek Lake in the 1970s and the subsequent development and
maintenance of the Park and its facilities since 1976 (when the Park was opened).
Disturbances have resulted in the removal of much if not all of the sandy A- and E-horizon sediments
from landforms over significant areas within the Park. The A- and E-horizon sediments are the only

35

sediments in the Park known to contain archeological deposits of prehistoric and/or historic age. The
removal of these sediments—as well as portions of the underlying clay subsoils where substantial use of
heavy machinery has occurred—resulted in the exposure of the clay B-horizon subsoil in these areas of
disturbances as well as the subsequent construction of facilities in some areas. The various disturbances
mapped during this archeological survey are conservatively estimated to cover 128.2 acres, or 44.7 percent,
of the Park (Table 3). In other words, because of the past disturbances, the potential for the presence of
archeological sites was virtually nil in 44.7 percent of the Park before the 2010 archeological survey was
initiated. Another 7.3 percent of the Park acreage is covered by a large area of mounded fill (consisting of
gray clay and lignite) (see Figure 6).

Breakdowns of the various disturbances by acre are provided in Table 3, and the extent of these
disturbances is depicted in Figure 6. The three largest contiguous areas of subsurface disturbances in the
Park are:
(1) construction of the wastewater treatment plant area in the north central area. This area has a

treatment pond, a holding pond, and a pumping station that brings sewage to the plant. Once the
sewage is treated, it is spread over a fenced pasture by a large sprinkler system that is connected
by underground irrigation piping;
(2) the machine-scraped or sediment cut-down area and boat ramp in the eastern part of the
Park, along part of the lake shoreline. It appears that at least 1–2 m of sediments have been
mechanically removed over a large rectangular area, and there are concrete slabs here, as well as
a large boat ramp;
(3) the day-use facilities and parking lot in the southeastern part of the Park, also situated in part
along the Martin Creek Lake shoreline. This area has been the scene of past heavy machinery
disturbances, which removed 1–2 m of sediments; much of this area was then covered with a paved
parking lot. Boat launches, group picnic areas, and playground equipment in the day-use area
have also contributed to the subsurface disturbances.

Shovel Test Coverage and Sediment Depth
A large number of shovel tests have been excavated to identify and/or relocate archeological sites within
the Park (see Figure 5). Varying rates of shovel tests per acre were employed across the Park depending
upon the distribution of high, moderate, and low probability areas (see Figure 4), and it was determined
from this shovel testing that there was a low density of either prehistoric and/or historic archeological
deposits across the Park. The shovel testing has also shown that the sandy loam A- and E-horizon sediments
in the Park are generally shallow (i.e., less than 45 cm thick) (Table 4; see also Appendix 2). Approximately
75 percent of the shovel tests excavated in the Park have A- and E-horizons that are less than 45 cm in
thickness overlying a clay subsoil; about 20 percent of these shovel tests encountered the clay B-horizon
subsoil at less than 15 cm bs.

amsl, suggesting that the thickness of the A- and E-horizon sediments is at least partially affected by slope
erosion, although less steeply sloping upland landforms in the western part of the Park also have very
shallow sandy loam sediments.
Very shallow sediments within much of the Park are also documented by results of shovel tests in which
0.5 percent of the tests encountered C-horizon deposits (i.e., sandstone rocks) at less than 30 cm bs (see
Table 4).
Thicker sandy loam A- and E-horizon sediments—greater than 61 cm in thickness—were encountered
in only 5.7 percent of the excavated shovel tests (see Table 4). The thickest sandy loam sediments are
present in one small area near the Martin Lake shoreline in the southern part of the Park, where Attoyac fine
sandy loam sediments more than 90 cm thick are present (Figure 8). About 1.2 percent (n = 5) of the shovel
tests, all in this one area, never encountered the clay B-horizon subsoil. One prehistoric site (41RK605) with
very sparse archeological materials was located in this area (see below).
Almost 7 percent of the excavated shovel tests across the Park encountered disturbed sediments and
fill deposits. None of these shovel tests had any remaining A- and E-horizon sediments.

sediments extend to more than 90 cm bs.

Investigations at Previously Recorded Sites
41RK9
This site, as recorded in 1972 (McDonald 1972), was a mid-nineteenth century farmhouse and a yard
artifact scatter. The house was possibly occupied by W. Dollhite after 1851, in the Harmony Hill community.
The site was marked by a small foundation mound (5.5 × 11.0 m) with bricks and rock piers (McDonald
1972:7). Ferruginous sandstone foundation rocks were present in one part of the site, associated with
whiteware sherds (plain, hand-painted and transfer-printed), salt-glazed sherds, stove parts, machine-cut
square nails, and bottle glass sherds. It was situated on an upland landform just east of a small tributary to
Panther Creek.
Test excavations were conducted at the site in 1972 (McDonald 1972:7–8). A single 1-×-2-m unit was
excavated in the house foundation area, and archeological deposits with nineteenth century artifacts
were recovered to a depth of 60 cm bs. Recovered artifacts included stoneware and refined earthenware
ceramics, most notably mid-nineteenth century hand-painted, blue shell-edged (ca. 1840–1860 style,
see Hunter and Miller 1994, 2009), and transfer-printed wares, porcelain and shell buttons, window glass
sherds, bottle glass sherds, many cut nails, brass, pewter, lead, and iron artifacts, and animal bones. A very
small amount of probable prehistoric Caddo artifacts (a few sherds and chipped stone fragments) were
recovered in the archeological deposits. McDonald (1972:8) recommended “limited testing…to ascertain
characteristics of the dwelling and possible outbuildings,” but the recommended work was not done before
construction of Martin Creek Lake.
This site was not relocated during the 2010 archeological survey. Shovel tests at the location plotted in
the Texas Historic Sites Atlas (see Appendix 1) of 41RK9 along the shoreline of Martin Creek Lake (ca. 20
m north of ST 276, based on the site form description of its location as determined by John Clark) did not
recover any historic or prehistoric artifacts or archeological deposits, and the described foundation stones
and bricks were not detected (see McDonald 1972). This part of the Park is covered in pine and hardwood
vegetation, and there are several primitive camp sites in the area.
It is possible that the location of 41RK9 was either misplotted on the Texas Historic Sites Atlas or was
destroyed during lake construction. The north shoreline of the lake at this point has been mechanically
altered and sediments have been removed (see Appendix 1 and Figure 6). The site could possibly now be
under water, although the site form indicates that its elevation was 307 ft amsl, about 2.5 ft above the 2010
lake level when the survey was conducted. McDonald (1972:7) did state, however, that “at the anticipated
flood level of Martin Lake, the site will be subject to inundation.”
41RK43
41RK43 is also a farmhouse site, occupied in the early part of the twentieth century, situated on a low
knoll (310 ft amsl) overlooking to the east a tributary of Panther Creek (see Appendices 1 and 3). Observed
archeological remains included a scattered brick chimney, wire nails, ceramic sherds, and bottle glass
sherds (McDonald 1972:30).
This site was also not relocated during the 2010 archeological survey of Martin Creek Lake State Park.
Its plotting (see Appendix 1) indicates that it was either destroyed during lake construction, as it was shown

41

in an area where there has been extensive heavy machinery work (see Figure 6), or its location now lies
underneath the large TPWD parking lot in the day-use area (see Figure 6), where it was likely destroyed
during the construction of Park facilities. Shovel tests excavated in areas not covered by the parking lot and
road pavement, areas planted in grass and trees, encountered only disturbed sediments (i.e., there were
fragments and chunks of concrete in the sediments). Picnic tables, a restroom, a pier, a fish-cleaning station,
and a boat ramp are also present in this part of the Park.
41RK66, Harmony Hill Baptist Church
The Harmony Hill Baptist Church site was first recorded in 1973 as the location of a 1930s-era church
about 250 m east of the Harmony Hill Cemetery, along an old road trace. This site is on an upland slope
(310–320 ft amsl), about 120 m west of a small tributary to Martin Creek. When the site was recorded in 1973,
the only archeological evidence apparent were a few pieces of hematite, perhaps remnants of foundation
piers. The site area was heavily overgrown at that time with brush and vines.
The site is currently wooded with mature pines and oaks, with a thick brush (holly) and vine understory.
The presence of privet, mulberry, chinaberry, and honeysuckle suggest that historic structures may have
once existed on the site,. There is evidence (push piles of displaced sediments) that portions of the site have
been scraped at one time or another in the past. Surface visibility was less than 10 percent.
During the current archeological investigations, extensive shovel testing (n = 41) was completed across
the landform. Seven shovel tests contained historic archeological deposits at 0–20 cm bs (Figure 9). The
estimated extent of the site is 2000 m2 (0.5 acres). The area of the twentieth century church is in the northern
part of the site, in the vicinity of ST 137, while earlier mid- to late nineteenth century archeological deposits
are present in the southern part of the site. Displaced sandstone rocks are present in both parts of the site,
likely foundation stones for a structure. A cleaned-out spring, with a soil berm around it, is just to the north of
the site (Figure 9).
The 50-×-50-cm unit (Unit 387) was 20 cm east of ST 182, and near one of the apparently displaced
large sandstone rocks (footing stones or rock piers) noted during the pedestrian examination of the site;
brick fragments were also present, under a mulberry tree, and probably represent remnants of a structural
foundation (see Figure 9). Historic artifacts were recovered from 0–20 cm bs and 30–35 cm bs in Zone 1
(dark grayish-brown sandy loam, 10YR 4/2 and Zone 2, a yellowish-brown sandy loam, 10YR 5/6) sandy loam
zones (Figure 10a). Zone 3 is a strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) sandy clay B-horizon.
A total of 32 historic artifacts were recovered from 41RK66 in the shovel testing (n = 26, from a total of
seven positive shovel tests) and one 50-×-50-cm unit (n = 6). (See Appendix 4 for 41RK66 and the other sites
for a complete artifact inventory by provenience.) In the shovel tests, all artifacts were found only at 0–20
cm bs, while 83 percent of the artifacts from Unit 387 are from those depths; one cut nail was recovered at
30–35 cm bs in this unit. The density of artifacts in the shovel testing is 3.71 artifacts per positive shovel test,
or approximately 29.7 artifacts per m2. In the 50-×-50-cm unit, the density of artifacts is 24.0 per m2, and 69
artifacts per m3.
The historic artifacts recovered in the investigations at 41RK66 suggest that there was a late nineteenth
century occupation here prior to the construction and use of the Harmony Hill Baptist Church (Table 5).
These artifacts are all from ST 182 and Unit 387 in the southern part of the site, with the exception of a hand-

42

Figure 9. Map of 41RK66.

43

made brick fragment from ST 178, about 20 m away (see Figure 9). The combination of hand-made bricks,
cut nails, window glass (estimated manufacture date of 1884.5 + 7), and domestic artifacts (ceramic sherds
and bottle glass) suggest that the late nineteenth century occupation had a farmstead structure on it. This
structure was abandoned and probably torn down well before the Harmony Hill Baptist Church was built.

6 white milk glass fruit jar lid liner sherds
Salt-glazed stoneware was a popular utilitarian ware throughout much of the nineteenth century
(Greer 1981:180). It increased in popularity in East Texas during approximately 1850–1870, then declined in
popularity by 1900 (Lebo 1987:140). The one sherd from 41RK66 had an exterior salt glaze over a gray-colored
vessel body (Figure 11).
The twentieth century artifacts from 41RK66 (see Table 5) include sherds from glass containers (bottles
and fruit jars) as well as zinc lids and lid liners to fruit jars. Zinc lid liners, along with the milk glass lid liner
inserts, were used up until about 1940 for fruit jars (Brantley 1975). Perhaps these artifacts represent the
discarded remains of containers holding foods used for meals served at the church.
Two clear bottle glass sherds exhibit marks on their bases. The first, from ST 178 (0–20 cm), is likely
from an extract bottle. The visible mark is “688 N…” The “N” is enclosed within a square, suggesting it was
made by the Obear-Nester Glass Company after 1894 (Whitten 2010). The second clear bottle base sherd
(ST 180, 0–20 cm bs) exhibits a mark consisting of “M-54” followed by a centrally placed B inside a circle,
followed by “648”. The mark containing B inside a circle suggests the bottle may have been made by the
Brockway Machine Bottle Company after 1925 (Whitten 2010).
41RK67, J. M. Robertson House
The J. M. Robertson House, a contributing element in the Harmony Hill National Register of Historic
Places District, when first recorded was thought to be an Anglo-American farmstead with the remains of a
stone foundation (and some foundation beams) as well as one or two wells. More information was obtained
about the site through an investigation in 1987 by Texas Parks and Wildlife “to mitigate the adverse effects
of sewer treatment plant development southwest of the site” (Davis et al. 1994:3). The site, now in a fenced

area, is situated on an upland slope (360
ft amsl) south of the Old Henderson Road
(41RK608).
Historic records indicate that J. M.
Robertson, a mercantile store owner in
Harmony Hill, bought the property on
which the site is located in 1869 (Davis et
al. 1994:18). In addition to the main house,
the property also apparently had a barn,
two smaller outbuildings, a possible privy,
as well as a hand-dug well, and trash pit
features (Davis et al. 1994:23).
The 1987 archeological investigations
included mapping, photography, surface
collections, and the excavation of 37 50-

Figure 11. Salt-glazed stoneware sherd from 41RK66. Provenience:

×-50-cm units in an area southwest of the main house feature (Davis et al. 1994). During the excavations,
in addition to the recovery of a large assemblage of late-nineteenth to mid-twentieth century artifacts,
three features were documented, including a 3-×-5-m trash pit (Feature 1), a possible posthole (Feature 2),
and another but less well-documented trash pit (Feature 3) (Davis et al. 1994:34–35). Artifacts found in the
excavations were predominately domestic items, especially culinary glass, tin cans, ceramics, and wire and
cut nails. The proportion of cut to wire nails (77.6 percent cut) suggests the main period of use occurred
around 1888–1889 (Adams 2002:Table 3).
Davis et al. (1994:68) recommended additional investigation at the site if it were to be threatened by
future developments. Since there have been no threats to the site since that time, no additional archeological
investigations have been undertaken at the J. M. Robertson House site.
During the 2010 archeological investigations at the Park, no work was conducted at this site other than
to photograph its current condition. The J. M. Robertson House is in a fenced thicket of brush and vines, and
it appears undisturbed. The historic house foundation feature area (see Davis et al. 1994:Figure 4) is still
visible in the fenced thicket because of vegetation typically found around abandoned historic farmsteads in
East Texas, including chinaberry, bois d’arc, crepe myrtle, wild roses, and honeysuckle.
41RK69
When 41RK69 was first recorded in 1973 (Clark and Ivey 1974), this historic farmstead site had visible
remnants of a pier foundation (brick and hematite stones) of a farmhouse and an associated artifact scatter
of refined earthenwares, stoneware sherds, glass, a cast iron teapot, an iron hoe blade, and a metal skillet.
The site was located on an upland slope (330–340 ft amsl) about 130 m east of an unnamed tributary to
Rocky Ford Creek (see Appendices 1 and 3).
When the site was revisited in 2010 during the current archeological survey, the remnants of the
farmhouse were marked by a 2.4-m-long × 0.8-m-wide pile of hand-made bricks (likely the location of an
old chimney base, although the pile had been disturbed by a large tree growing through it) near the center

46

of the site (Figure 12). However, no hematite rocks as mentioned by Clark and Ivey (1974) were identified.
The brick pile stood approximately 30 cm above the ground surface, and there were at least two layers of
buried brick associated with the brick pile. The one whole hand-made brick was reddish-brown (2.5YR 4/4)
in color, and measured 8.5 × 4.5 × 2.75 inches in length, width, and thickness, respectively.
The site is in a pine-hardwood forest with a thick understory of briars, bushes, and vines; surface
visibility was less than 10 percent. A concentration of cast iron stove parts was present about 5 m west of
the brick pile (in the area of ST 318). The site is located just south of the faint traces of an old roadbed (see
Figure 12).
Of the shovel tests excavated in the site area, six of them contained historic archeological deposits (see
Figure 12). 41RK69 covers an area of approximately 900 m2 (0.2 acres).
Two 50-×-50-cm units were excavated at 41RK69, primarily because the archeological deposits at the
site are so shallow, and it was felt that an additional 50-×-50-cm unit could obtain a more representative
sample of the artifacts present in the site’s archeological deposits. Unit 390 was 40 cm south of ST 333 in the
southeastern part of the site (see Figure 12). Historic artifacts were found at 0–8 cm bs in Zone 1 sediments
(see Figure 10b); the underlying subsoil is a red (2.5YR 4/6) clay (Zone 4). The second 50-×-50-cm unit (Unit
393) was located 11 m west and 9 m north of Unit 390, and 30 cm south of ST 319. The archeological deposits
(Zone 1) were somewhat thicker in this unit (0–12 cm bs) overlying a Zone 4 subsoil (see Figure 10c). In
addition to historic nails, glass, and ceramics, brick fragments were found in Zone 1.
A total of 65 historic artifacts were recovered in the current archeological investigations at 41RK69
(Table 6). This included 27 artifacts from the six positive shovel tests, and 38 artifacts from the two 50-×-50cm units (n = 13 in Unit 390 and n = 25 artifacts in Unit 393, near the center of the site). These artifacts were
recovered from archeological deposits no more than 20 cm in thickness. The density of artifacts in the shovel
testing was 4.5 per positive shovel test, or approximately 36 artifacts per m2. Densities in the two 50-×-50-cm
units ranged from 52 to 100 artifacts per m2, or 520–670 artifacts per m3 of archeological deposits.
The artifacts from 41RK69 are consistent with a farmstead occupation that would have primarily been
occupied before 1880 (see Table 6). This interpretation is based on the proportion of cut to wire nails (94
percent cut nails, see Adams 2002:Table 3), the presence of brown lead-glazed stoneware that was popular
in East Texas during approximately 1870–1900 (see Lebo 1987), and the occurrence of the porcelain shirt
and collar buttons. The assemblage itself is dominated by cut nails used in the construction of a wood-framed
structure that may have had a brick chimney base, along with cast iron stove parts, glass from snuff, medicinal,
and alcoholic containers, and ceramic plates and stoneware crockery (Figure 13, see also Table 6).
41RK 71, J. M. Griffin House
The J. M. Griffin House site is the archeological remains of a 40-×-60-ft farmhouse (visible on a 1939
aerial photograph and as recorded in 1974), and an associated yard scatter of discarded artifacts. On the
ground, when the foundation was first recorded in the early 1970s, it appeared to have been marked by
piles of hematite blocks at the corners and along the walls. The site is on an upland slope (340–350 ft amsl)
(see Appendices 1 and 3).
The site area is now in a thick brush-, briar-, and vine-covered area of the Park, with a pine and
hardwood overstory. Surface visibility was less than 10 percent. The current archeological investigations

47

at the site documented the foundation as a rectangular pad or artificially raised house mound that is
approximately 30–40 cm high and 7.3 m long by 5.5 m wide (Figure 14). Six sandstone footing stones
markthe north wall of the house and a small part of the west wall; additional footing stones are either
shallowly buried on the house mound, or have been displaced by previous tree clearing activities. There
is also a hand-dug and unlined well (1.5-m diameter) approximately 10 m west-northwest of the northwest
corner of the house foundation; it is currently 140 cm in depth.

Five shovel tests excavated in and around the house foundation contain historic archeological materials
in 40-cm-thick sandy loam deposits. The J. M. Griffin House site covers an estimated 900 m2 (0.2 acres). Unit
382 (50-×-50-cm unit) is 70 cm west of ST 376 (see Figure 14). Historic archeological materials occur at 0–30
cm bs, in Zone 1 and 2 sandy loam deposits (see Figure 10d). These deposits are a maximum of 41 cm thick
overlying Zone 4 and Zone 5 (strong brown clay, 7.5YR 5/8) subsoil sediments.
A total of 28 historic artifacts (including several pieces of extremely rusted iron fragments) have been
recovered from the site during shovel testing (n = 18, from five shovel tests) and 50-×-50-cm unit excavations
(n = 10). In the shovel testing, the artifacts occur at 0–40 cm bs, but are only found at depths of 0–30 cm in
Unit 382. The density of artifacts in the positive shovel tests is 3.6, or approximately 28.8 artifacts per m2. In

49

Unit 382, the artifact density is 40 per m2,
and 133 per m3.
The historic artifacts from the J.
M. Griffin House site are from an early
twentieth century farmstead occupation
(Table 7). There is evidence of food
containers (cans and bottle glass) and
food serving artifacts (a whiteware sherd
likely from a plate) discarded at the site,
along with house construction artifacts
(wire nails) and window glass from a
wood-framed structure.
The unidentified iron piece (see
Table 7) is a circular-shaped fragment,
likely from a farm tool or wagon hardware.

41RK133, Henderson Road Bridge
This site is the remains of the Henderson Road Bridge (310 ft amsl), once 20 × 30 m in size, located
on the Old Henderson Road where it crosses a small tributary stream of Rocky Ford Creek about 800 m
west-southwest of the Harmony Hill Cemetery (see Appendices 1 and 3). The roadbed leading up to the
bridge location was reported in 1983 to be approximately 4 m wide, with ditches on both sides. The bridge
abutment was built with local hematite stones, probably in the mid-nineteenth century; it was apparently still
in use in the 1930s.
In 2010, not much remained of the bridge except for approximately 10 rocks from the bridge in
the Rocky Ford Creek bed, and a similar number eroding out along the northwest side of the old bridge

crossing over the tributary stream. The old roadbed at the crossing is 1 m high, and 4 m wide where it would
have crossed the stream.
41RK466
This prehistoric site of unknown age was reported as being situated on a narrow ridge (280 ft amsl) that
protrudes from an island in Martin Lake (see Appendices 1 and 3) when the lake is at conservation levels;
this landform would have overlooked the Martin Creek floodplain before the lake was built. At normal or
conservation pool water levels (306 ft amsl), 41RK466 would be under water. During 1996 investigations by
Stephen F. Austin State University, six shovel tests were excavated at the site and a surface collection was
performed. Only three pieces of lithic debris, four fire-cracked rocks, and a quartzite hammerstone were
found over a 2500 m2 area (0.6 acres). The archeological deposit was estimated at no more than 85 cm in
thickness from the modern surface (Becker 1996). Bo Nelson had visited 41RK466 about five years ago when
it was not submerged because of low water levels in the lake, and he noted 4–5 pieces of fire-cracked rock
and two pieces of lithic debris on the surface at that time.
With the lake levels at 304.5 ft amsl during the June 2010 archeological survey, 41RK466 was
determined to be currently under approximately 20 ft of water. The tops of several trees stick out of the
lake about 100 m from the current shoreline of the island, and these likely mark the submerged ridge and
archeological site. No pedestrian survey or shovel test investigations were conducted at the site in this
project.
41RK467, Big Toe
The Big Toe site is located on the Martin Lake shoreline, on an upland ridge (280–308 ft amsl) that
projects into the lake (Figure 15). A small and intermittent tributary to Rocky Ford Creek (now under
water) lies 30 m east of the ridge. The site, which was estimated to cover an area of 336 m2 when it was first
recorded by Stephen F. Austin State University, has both prehistoric and historic occupations. The prehistoric
component consists of quartzite and chert lithic debris, a large quartzite cobble, and a fire-cracked rock.
The historic artifacts from the site include domestic and architectural debris: brick, pieces of metal, ceramic
sherds, and canning jars and jar lids. A concentration of brick, a concrete pylon, and scattered rocks are
present along the southern part of the ridge at the shoreline and may mark the location of a house at the Big
Toe site (Becker and Roberts 1996).
Shovel testing on the eastern tip of the landform in 2010 identified historic archeological deposits in
five shovel tests that extend across an area covering approximately 700 m2 or approximately 0.2 acres (see
Figure 15). The site area has an overstory of hardwoods and a thick understory of brush, vines, and button
willow; surface visibility was less than 10 percent, even along the shoreline. An area of a few brick fragments
was noted at the far southeastern part of the site, along the active shoreline.
The 50-×-50-cm unit (Unit 391) excavated at the Big Toe site in this investigation is 70 cm northwest
of ST 8 (see Figure 15). It contained a relatively high density of historic artifacts (glass, asphalt shingle
fragments, metal, and brick fragments) at 0–30 cm bs in Zone 1 and 2 sandy loam zones (see Figure 10e).
The A- and E-horizon sandy loam sediments in the unit are a maximum of 60 cm thick (including Zones 1, 2,
and 6, a yellowish-brown sandy loam with manganese concretions), overlying a red sandy clay (Zone 7).

As expected from previous archeological findings, both prehistoric (n = 1) and historic (n = 164)
artifacts have been recovered in the archeological investigations at 41RK467 (Table 8), although historic
artifacts greatly outnumber the prehistoric artifacts by a ratio of 164:1. The density of historic artifacts in the
shovel testing (based on five positive shovel tests) was 8.8 per positive shovel test, or approximately 70.4
artifacts per m2. In the 50-×-50-cm unit, the density of historic artifacts was a very high 480 per m2, and 1600
artifacts per m3.

With the exception of a few pieces of relatively thin window glass that may have been manufactured
in the 1850s and 1860s, the historic artifacts from 41RK467 are from a farmstead occupation dated from
approximately 1870 to the 1920s or later (see Table 8). The presence of the post-1870 4-hole hard rubber
button is consistent with this interpretation (Figure 16).
A wood-framed structure stood on the site (probably located in the area of Unit 391) with windows and
an asphalt shingle roof. Bottle glass (n = 91), glass snuff (n = 1), glass tableware (n = 3), glass jar (n = 2), and
canning fruit jar glass and milk glass lid liner (n = 13) sherds dominate the artifact assemblage, accounting
for 67 percent of the recovered sample. The bottle glass pieces are from post-1905 automatic bottle making
machines, and the bright green jar glass may have been made by Owens-Illinois Co. around 1940 (Society

54

for Historical Archaeology 2010). The glass
fruit jars have continuous screw thread
finishes, and are likely from Mason’s
Patent closure jars, first patented in 1858,
and manufactured until approximately
1915 (Society for Historical Archaeology
2010), as well as early to mid-twentieth
century Ball Perfect Mason jars. Curiously,
no whiteware or stoneware sherds were
recovered.
Embossed marks are visible on
several of the clear bottle glass sherds,
including “MO…” and “…OROLINE”.
The clear bottle glass sherd with the
“… OROLINE” embossed mark is from a

paneled medicinal/chemical/druggist bottle likely made in the 1870s and 1880s, based on the bottle shape
and the embossing marks (Society for Historical Archaeology 2010). Fruit jar glass sherds have “Ball” and
“Quart” embossed marks.
A single Late Archaic (ca. 5000–2500 B.P.) dart point stem fragment was recovered in ST 2 at 20–40 cm
bs. It is made from a local petrified wood and has a slight expanding stem and a flat base (with a smoothed
cortex on the piece). The stem is 5.1 mm thick and 11.3 mm wide.

Investigations at Newly Recorded Sites
Site #1 (41RK605)
This site is on an upland landform not far from the current Martin Creek Lake shoreline (304.5–308
ft amsl). Developed campsites are present in the area (#9 and #10 in the Broken Bowl Camping area), as
well as a paved Park road (Figure 17). Between the two sections of the paved Park road is an area that has
been graded by heavy machinery to form a drainage ditch. The site area itself is covered in thick brush
and vines as well as hardwoods; surface visibility was less than 10 percent. Shovel tests were excavated
along the ridge paralleling the lake shoreline, but only two of them (ST 12 and ST 34) contained prehistoric
archeological materials in relatively deep A- and E-horizon sandy loam deposits. Site size is estimated at
less than 100 m2.
Unit 392 (a 50-×-50-cm unit) is 2.1 m northeast of ST 38 (see Figure 17). It was excavated to 100 cm
bs, but did not contain any artifacts. The sediments in the unit (see Figure 10f) include 75 cm of A- and
E-horizon sandy loam zones, including Zone 1, 2, and 8 (a yellowish-brown sandy loam with strong brown
mottles overlying a strong brown loam) that extends from 75 cm to 100 cm or more.
This prehistoric site has a very low density of lithic artifacts recovered in deposits between 20–40 and
80–100 cm bs. Two positive shovel tests each had one piece of lithic debris: a non-cortical flake fragment
of gray chert (ST 34, 20–40 cm bs) and a non-cortical piece of petrified wood (ST 12, 80–100 cm bs). The

55

Figure 17. Map of 41RK605.

56

density of artifacts in the positive shovel tests is 1.0, or only approximately 8 artifacts per m2. As previously
mentioned, the 50-×-50-cm unit did not contain any prehistoric artifacts.
Site #2 (41RK606)
This site is located on an upland toe slope (320–330 ft amsl) in the western part of the Park, just 20 m
south of the Old Henderson Road (Figure 18). Several Park trails cross the site. An intermittent tributary to
Rocky Ford Creek lies about 100 m east of the site. The site area has an overstory of pine and hardwoods,
with a thick understory of brush and vines; surface visibility was less than 10 percent.
Six shovel tests dispersed across the landform contain archeological materials, but no structural
remains or features were discernible from surface evidence or in the subsequent subsurface archeological
investigations. Site size is estimated at 3000 m2 (ca. 0.75 acres). The 50-×-50-cm unit (Unit 389) excavated at
this site is 40 cm north of ST 111 (see Figure 18). It has historic artifacts at a depth of 0–30 cm bs in Zone 1
and 2 sandy loam deposits, overlying a Zone 4 red clay (see Figure 10g).
Both prehistoric (n = 1, from ST 111, 20–40 cm bs) and historic (n = 18) artifacts were recovered in six
shovel tests and one 50-×-50-cm unit at this site. The density of prehistoric artifacts was 1.0 per positive
shovel test (ca. 8 artifacts per m2), while the historic artifact density in the shovel tests was 1.50 per positive
shovel test (ca. 12.0 artifacts per m2). In the 50-×-50-cm unit, the density of historic artifacts was greater at 36
per m2, the equivalent of 120 artifacts per m3.
The one prehistoric artifact was a non-cortical piece of heat-treated quartzite lithic debris. Quartzite
is a locally available lithic resource for stone tool knapping, and the archeological evidence from these
investigations suggests that only occasional stone tool knapping was done here by prehistoric peoples.
The historic artifacts from the site (Table 9) suggest a domestic occupation or farmstead was present
here between as early as 1860 and the early twentieth century. There is evidence that a brick chimney
may have been built to accompany a wood-framed building with windows, and sherds were present from
ceramic and glass plates and bottles used for food serving and as containers for liquids. One blue-green
glass sherd may be from a medicinal container made in the late nineteenth or early twentieth century
(Society for Historical Archaeology 2010).

Site #3 (41RK607)
This multicomponent site is on an upland toe slope (310 ft amsl) in the northeastern part of the Park
(see Appendix 3), along the eastern boundary fence line. The site has a thick understory of brush and
vines, with a mature pine overstory; surface visibility was less than 10 percent. A cleaned-out spring (4
m in diameter) is present about 15 m south of the southern boundary of the site (Figure 19). The eastern
boundary of the site is marked by a 3–4 m heavy machinery-created cut bank paralleling a roadbed and
the wire fence line of the TPWD Park boundary. Seven shovel tests were excavated in or in the immediate
vicinity of the defined site boundaries, and the four positive shovel tests define a site area of approximately
800 m2 (0.2 acres).
Unit 388, the 50-×-50-cm unit, is 50 cm west of ST 158 (see Figure 19), in the western part of the site. This
unit has historic archeological deposits that are a maximum of 40 cm thick in Zone 2 sandy loam sediments.
The top of the yellowish-brown sandy clay (Zone 10) is at approximately 52 cm bs (see Figure 10h). No
historic structural remains or features were visible on the surface at 41RK607, and none were encountered in
the shovel testing or in the 50-×-50-cm excavation unit.
The small assemblage from 41RK607 contained both prehistoric (n = 1) and historic (n = 25) artifacts.
The one prehistoric artifact (a Scallorn arrow point, see below) was found at 20–30 cm bs in Unit 388. The
historic artifacts occurred in 0–40 cm thick archeological deposits in four shovel tests and Unit 388. The
density of historic artifacts was 3.50 per positive shovel test, or approximately 28.0 artifacts per m2. In Unit
388, the density of artifacts was 44 per m2, and there were 110 artifacts per m3 of archeological deposits.
The historic occupation at 41RK607 may predate 1870, except for the one wire nail (post-1891) from
ST 158 (Table 10). This interpretation is based on the presence of pre-1870 olive and dark olive green
bottle glass sherds (from wine, whiskey, or brandy bottles) (Newman 1970:72–74; Society for Historical
Archaeology 2010), the 1840s–1860s hand-painted and hand-painted annular whiteware sherds (Majewski
and O’Brien 1987), the frequency of cut nails (Figure 20b), and a ca. post-1850 porcelain four-hole shirt/
dress button. These kinds of buttons remained popular until the early twentieth century (Meissner 1997:120).
The range of historic artifacts suggests that they are discarded refuse and structural debris from a
nineteenth century farmstead. The hand-made brick fragments and nails indicate that a wood-framed
structure stood on the site, probably with a brick chimney or a brick base to a mud cat chimney (see Jordan
1978). The occupants of the site used and discarded food/liquid containers and food serving dishes, and lost
at least one clothing button during the occupation.
The Scallorn arrow point (see Figure 20a) was made from a local red chert and has been bifacially
flaked to shape, with pressure flakes along the margins to complete the point. It has an expanding stem and
corner notches, as well as a resharpened blade. The point is 11.9 mm long, 11.5 mm wide, 2.8 mm thick, and
has a 5.1-mm stem width. In East Texas, Scallorn points are typically seen in Late Woodland (ca. A.D. 700–
850) and Early Caddo (ca. A.D. 850–1000) archeological sites.

Old Henderson Road (41RK608)
Two segments (750 m in total length) of the Old Henderson Road, otherwise known as the Board Ferry
Road (through the community of Harmony Hill and on to Henderson, Texas) or the Henderson–Shreveport
Road (east to Shreveport, Louisiana, on
the Red River), are present in the Park
(see Appendix 3) where the road runs
generally east–west across Park lands,
crossing wooded upland slopes and small
creek valleys (304–340 ft amsl). The road is
marked by prominent and deep roadcuts
(1–3 m deep). In some places multiple,
parallel, routes are visible. Some sections
of the old road are 20–30 m in width, but
generally speaking the road is 4–5 m wide,
with ditches on both sides.
The western segment of the road,
which enters the Park near 41RK133 and
ends 560 m to the west in Martin Lake,
has cut down 1–4 m into the landforms it
crosses, and is parallelled by drainage
ditches. A Park trail runs along this part of
the old roadbed. The eastern segment of
the road in the Park, which was covered

by a thick cover of brush and vines, is approximately 190 m in length and runs along the northeast Park
boundary (see Appendix 3).
Isolated Find
A single piece of prehistoric lithic debris was recovered at 20–40 cm bs in ST 229 in a defined high
probability area in the far southeastern part of the Park (see Figure 4). The find location is on a natural rise
that is approximately 20–30-m wide by 50–60-m long and approximately 2 m above the lake shoreline; the
landform is covered with pine and hardwood, with a thick understory of brush and vines. A Park trail crosses
the rise.
Numerous other shovel tests on the rise failed to recover any additional prehistoric artifacts. The
recovered artifact from the isolated find is a non-cortical gray chert flake fragment; it came from a heattreated pebble or cobble. It has been treated as an isolated find because the shovel tests excavated in each
cardinal direction from the shovel test did not contain any prehistoric archeological deposits.

Management Recommendations
State Archeological Landmark Eligibility
The criteria for evaluating archeological sites as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) are listed in Chapter
26.8 of the General Rules of Practice and Procedure (Chapter 26) for the Antiquities Code of Texas:
(1) the site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory and/or
history of Texas by the addition of new and important information;
(2) the site’s archeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and intact,
thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;
(3) the site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or history;
(4) the study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of preservation,
thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge; and
(5) the high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur, and official
landmark designation is needed to insure maximum legal protection, or alternatively further
investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and relic collecting when the site
cannot be protected.
Although all archeological sites in Martin Creek Lake State Park are de facto State Archeological
Landmarks according to Section 191.092 of the Antiquities Code of Texas, a smaller number may warrant
official designation after their research potential has been evaluated according to the above-mentioned
criteria. Consideration of the SAL eligibility of the 13 known archeological sites at Martin Creek Lake State
Park is based on Chapter 26.8(1–4), and the determinations in this report have been made in cognizance of
the possibility that the Texas Historical Commission and TPWD may also make determinations as to whether
or not these site warrant designation under Chapter 26.8(5). With respect to archeological resources, to
have “intact” and preserved archeological deposits means that, at the survey level of investigation, (1) such
deposits have the potential for features to be present, and/or features have been identified; (2) there exists,
or the potential exists, for intra-site patterning in artifacts and features; and (3) representative samples of
artifacts and/or features are present from undisturbed contexts from specific site assemblages and deposits.
In the present set of sites at Martin Creek Lake State Park, criteria 1 and 2 above are the most relevant
because they specifically address the important contributions the sites can make to understanding the
history and prehistory of Rusk County and East Texas. These criteria are also readily employed in site
evaluations that are based on the sort of minimal data obtained from archeological sites identified and
documented only through pedestrian survey, shovel testing, and 50-×-50-cm unit excavations.
In many cases, the eligibility of particular sites for SAL designation cannot be determined with current
limited archeological information because it is not possible to demonstrate with data derived from surface
survey, shovel testing, and 50-×-50-cm test excavation units that the sites have, or had, information that
can contribute to our understanding of human history or prehistory (pre-A.D. 1680) in the region. Without
definitive demonstration of research potential, which is difficult to achieve with archeological sites known

63

only from survey-level investigations, it is possible only to conclude that their SAL status is undetermined.
Summaries of the sites known and/or found within the Park on the 2010 archeological survey, and
assessments of their SAL eligibility, are presented in Table 11.

Two of the 13 sites, 41RK67 and 41RK608, have been determined to be eligible for SAL designation.
Site 41RK67 warrants SAL designation because it contains intact features and archeological deposits of
mid-nineteenth to mid-twentieth century age (see Davis et al. 1994) from a farmstead associated with the
ca. 1850–1900 town of Harmony Hill. As such, it contains information important to the history of this part of
East Texas and qualifies for SAL designation under criteria 1 and 2. Sites such as 41RK67 contain evidence
for structures, yard or trash middens, and an abundant material culture record that can be informative about
its life history (cf. Beaudry 2004:254, 262), Anglo-American farmsteads (cf. Groover 2008), the early frontier
settlement of the region, and cultural adaptations from the mid-nineteenth century to the mid-twentieth
century. The archeological remains and features recovered and studied from 41RK67 provide “a window into
the everyday lives of rural Americans” (De Cunzo 2005:117).
The Old Henderson Road (41RK608) is considered worthy of SAL consideration under criterion 3 of
Chapter 28 of the General Rules of Practice and Procedure for the Antiquities Code of Texas. The site, which
consists of remnants of the roadbed and roadcuts, meets this criterion because it represents a road that
was an important route of commerce in this part of East Texas in the mid-to late nineteenth century, and it
played a significant role in the settling of the Harmony Hill community in the early 1850s. Most of the historic
archeological sites in Martin Creek Lake State Park were part of this now abandoned community.
Six sites are of undetermined SAL status, and they warrant further attention to establish their eligibility
for SAL designation (see Table 11). The principal occupation at each of these sites was a farmstead that was
associated with the nearby town of Harmony Hill, as well as with the Old Henderson Road (41RK608), an
early route of commerce in this part of East Texas. Only further investigations, including the development
of a test excavation research design, along with test excavations and archival research, will determine
whether the historic and historic–prehistoric sites of undetermined SAL status at Martin Creek Lake State
Park meet any of the criteria specified in Chapter 26.8 of the General Rules of Practice and Procedure for
the Antiquities Code of Texas. The purpose of the test excavations would be to determine whether any of
these sites have research significance, have the potential to contain important information about the midnineteenth and early twentieth century history of the rural Harmony Hill area, and can contribute important
information about the changing lifestyles of small landowners in East Texas.
Five archeological sites listed in Table 11 are not recommended for SAL status. Three of the sites
(41RK9, 41RK43, and 41RK466) were not relocated during the 2010 archeological survey: two of the sites
(41RK9 and 41RK43) are presumed to have been destroyed during 1970s activities associated with the
construction of Martin Lake and the early developments in Martin Creek Lake State Park. The third site is
under water (41RK466), and its archeological deposits (if they still remain) have probably been disturbed by
lake erosion and water level fluctuations. Artifacts and plant and animal remains that may have been present
in archeological deposits will have been subjected to the destructive effects of long-term submergence.
Because none of these sites could be relocated, we have concluded that they have poor contextual integrity,
lack intact archeological deposits, and have limited archeological research potential. These sites have no
potential to contribute to a better understanding of the history or prehistory of East Texas, or add new and
important information that would address pertinent research questions about the history and prehistory of
the region.

65

Archeological Sensitivity Zones at Martin Creek Lake State Park
Two areas of high archeological sensitivity have been defined at Martin Creek Lake State Park (Figure 21)
on the basis of all previous and current archeological survey investigations at the Park.
The two different areas represent landforms and settings within the Park where historic and/or
multicomponent historic and prehistoric sites are known to be particularly abundant. They are also areas
where important or potentially important archeological sites (i.e., sites likely to contain research potential
and have preserved and intact archeological deposits and associated artifacts) have been identified from
past and current archeological investigations.
The remainder of Martin Creek Lake State Park is considered to have a low archeological sensitivity
(see Figure 21).
Figure 21, in conjunction with site-specific recommendations summarized above, as well as
management priority rankings (see below), will assist the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department in making
decisions about whether further archeological studies will be needed at Martin Creek Lake State Park prior
to the initiation of future maintenance or construction activities. In general, in our opinion, the areas of low
archeological sensitivity do not warrant further archeological considerations by Texas Parks and Wildlife,
other than steps that should be taken in the case of the accidental discovery of archeological sites in those
areas (see discussion in McNatt et al. 2001:193).

Management Priority Rankings
This section of the report presents our evaluations regarding the management priority for TPWD Park
management personnel of each of the sites investigated in the Martin Creek Lake State Park. These
evaluations include the following:
• an assessment of the relative management priority of each archeological site, ranked from 1
(high) to 4 (low);
• specific recommendations for the management of each archeological site regardless of its
management priority; and
• an assessment of the need for any additional research not covered under the contract between
CAS and TPWD, as suggested by the results of the investigations. Site evaluations will clearly
articulate the basis for the evaluation, with particular reference to research potential and local
archeological context.
These management priority rankings for each archeological site adhere to a four-part classification
system (Table 12). Sites officially designated as State Archeological Landmarks (SAL) are given
Management Priority 1 ranking, and sites recommended for SAL designation are ranked at Management
Priority 2. These management priority rankings will enable TPWD to focus on these sites in efforts to avoid
impacts to significant cultural resources. Sites whose SAL status is unknown are ranked at Management
Priority 3, so that further archeological investigations can be directed to them if warranted. Sites not
recommended for SAL status are ranked at Management Priority 4, and have the lowest TPWD priority for
management and protection.

The records of the Texas Historical Commission (2010) currently indicate no archeological sites
designated as SALs in Martin Creek Lake State Park, and thus there are no Management Priority Rank 1 sites
in the Park (see Table 12). However, the J. M. Robertson site (41RK67) is considered a contributing member
to the Harmony Hill National Register of Historic Places District. Previously recorded sites 41RK66 and
41RK71 are within the boundaries of this district, but are not currently listed as contributing members.
Of the 13 archeological sites known and recorded within the boundaries of Martin Creek Lake State
Park, one site (41RK67) has a Management Priority Rank 2. Six others (41RK66, 69, 71, 467, 606, and 607) are
assigned a Management Priority Rank 3, and the remaining six sites (41RK9, 43, 133, 466, 605, and 608) have
a Management Priority Rank 4 (see Table 12).
The one site with Management Priority Rank 2 should be avoided and protected during future
proposed development projects at the Park. If the site cannot be avoided and protected, a program of
archeological data recovery/mitigation is recommended as the next step in minimizing the effects of any
future proposed development projects at the Park on this SAL-eligible site. The six Management Priority
Rank 3 sites should also be avoided and protected during future proposed development projects at the Park
until their SAL status is determined. If they cannot be avoided and protected, a program of archeological
test excavation (accompanied by detailed archival research) is recommended as the next step in formally
evaluating their research potential under the Antiquities Code and the criteria laid out in the General
Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26.8(1–4). The six Management Priority Rank 4 sites do not merit
further archeological work. In the case of 41RK608—the remnants of the Old Henderson Road—it has
been considered worthy of SAL consideration because it represents a road that was an important route of
commerce in this part of East Texas in the mid-to late nineteenth century, and it played a significant role
in the settling of the Harmony Hill community in the early 1850s (see above). Because its archeological
physical expression in the Park has been documented, no additional archeological work is recommended
for the old east and west road segments (see Appendix 3), and the Management Priority Rank 4
determination has been assigned.

68

Additional Research Needs
Two additional research needs concerning the archeological resources at Martin Creek Lake State Park
have been identified: (1) detailed archival research on sites in the Park associated with the mid- to late
nineteenth century community of Harmony Hill; and (2) backhoe investigations in one locale within the Park.
Archival Research
Detailed archival research may be warranted on farmstead sites in the Park that are apparently
associated with the nineteenth century community of Harmony Hill, including 41RK66, 41RK69, 41RK71,
41RK467, 41RK606, and 41RK607. The purpose of this research would be to identify the specific occupants
and families who may have used the sites during the archeologically defined occupations, and to better
understand the relative social position of the families and households that may have lived at the sites.
This proposed research would rely on the use of primary materials, particularly deed record and
tax information (ad valorem tax records on microfilm at the Texas State Library and Archives) preserved
at the Rusk County Clerk’s office, Texas General Land Office, Texas State Library and Archives, and the
Rusk County Depot Museum. Online resources (such as Heritage Quest TM Online) may also contain
documentation pertinent to these historic archeological sites, including age, gender, marital status, numbers
of children, etc. of individuals who may have lived within one of these households. Tax records, along with
relevant U.S. Census population schedules, and probate records should provide information on the value of
the real and personal property held by the various families and households during the site occupations.
Backhoe Investigations
Considering the general upland setting of Martin Creek Lake State Park, only one area within the
Park was identified where potential artifact-bearing sediments more than 100 cm in depth are present (see
Figure 8). About 2 percent of the more than 420 shovel tests excavated in the Park did not reach the sterile
B-horizon clay subsoil or had more than 100 cm of A- and E-horizon sediments (see Table 4 and Appendix
2). This area occurs on a narrow upland ridge that parallels the Martin Lake shoreline and is in the vicinity of
41RK605 (see Appendix 3).
Backhoe trench investigations may be warranted in this locale for two principal archeological reasons:
(1) to ascertain and clarify the depth, thickness, and depositional context of deep sandy sediments that
may contain deep artifact-bearing sediments; and (2) to prospect for other archeological sites that are
deeply buried and have no near-surface expression. Backhoe trench investigations in this locale may also
be warranted to contribute archeological and geoarcheological information from Martin Creek Lake State
Park on the research issue of “whether prehistoric sites can occur in a primary context buried within the socalled sandy mantle” (Crawford and Nordt 2001:17; see also Lohse and Bousman 2006). Several competing
models have been proposed to account for the origins of the sandy mantle deposits and explain the
occurrence of archeological materials buried in them (Lohse and Bousman 2006:60–63). These alternatives
have implications for interpreting the depositional integrity and research potential of sandy mantle sites,
and bear on the likely research significance of any sandy mantle sites at Martin Creek Lake State Park.
