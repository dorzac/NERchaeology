ABSTRACT
In June 2015 Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants (DETAC) conducted a
cultural resource management survey of the proposed City of Rusk 2014 TPWD
Recreational Trails Grant in Lions Park in Rusk, Texas. The improvements include
building a concrete trail 1,312 meters (4,305 feet) long around the perimeter of the park.
The cultural resources survey included a visual inspection, documentation of modern
disturbance, and shovel testing along less disturbed portions of the route under Texas
Antiquities Permit #7309. All of the shovel tests were negative and no cultural features
were observed. No artifacts were collected. No further investigations are recommended
however, if any cultural material is recovered during construction, then excavation should
stop and a qualified archaeologist contacted to evaluate the impact. DETAC is requesting
concurrence with the determination of “no effect” to NRHP eligible properties for the
trail route.

INTRODUCTION
In June 2015, Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultant (DETAC) conducted a cultural
resources survey of a proposed City of Rusk 2014 TPWD Recreational Trails Grant in Lions Park
for the City of Rusk, Texas (Figure 1). The cultural resource management survey was requested by
the Texas Historical Commission under the Texas Antiquities Code because the trail will be
administered by the City of Rusk and funding was provided by Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department (TPWD). Texas Antiquities Permit #7309 was obtained and all terms of the permit
were carried out pursuant the Texas Antiquities Code. The report was prepared following the short
report format outlined by the Council of Texas Archaeologist (CTA) (2005a).
The purpose of this survey was to locate, describe and record any cultural resources within
the project area boundaries. The proposed trail route was visually examined and shovel tests were
excavated in areas with no obvious surface disturbance. No cultural resources were found during
the surface inspection shovel testing of the project area; therefore, no artifacts were curated.
DETAC is requesting a concurrence with the determination of “no effect” to NRHP eligible
properties for the proposed trail route.
DEFINITION OF THE STUDY AREA
The proposed development includes a 3 meter (m) (10 foot (ft)) wide concrete trail roughly
1,291 meters (m) (4,235 ft) long. Total project area is approximately 0.4 hectares (ha) (1.0 acres
(ac)). The trail will connect parking areas along existing baseball fields to a city pool and other
activity areas in Lions Park. Vegetation ranges from maintained grass to a stand of trees with a
moderate understory of various bushes and shrubs. The trail route was marked with pin flags at the
time of the survey. Topographically, the project area is on the toe slope of an upland ridge
overlooking the city golf course, lake, and headwaters to College Creek.
Soils along the trail route include Nacogdoches (Nf) and Trawick (Nh) soils series along
with areas with several quarry symbols along the western portion of the proposed trails. Both
soil series consists of dark reddish brown fine sandy loam 15 cm (6 inches) deep over dark red
clay (NRCS 2015). These soils formed on glauconitic marine sediments from the Eocene. This
material eroded forming steep slopes. Multiple quarry symbols suggest most of the area was
heavily modified then reused as the city of Rusk expanded into exhausted quarried areas.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS AND CULTURAL HISTORY
Overall, Cherokee County has been studied in numerous small surveys across the county
and isolated larger investigations in the northern portion of the county. Larger surveys include
investigations for Lake Palestine (e.g., Anderson 1971), the Mud Creek floodplain for the
Angelina and Neches River Authority and the Troup mine (e.g., Skinner 1981). Archaeological
work in southern Cherokee county includes excavations at the George C. Davis site (e.g., Fields
1978, Davis et al. 1992, Creel et al. 2005) along with smaller surveys for water lines (e.g., Galan
2004), well locations (e.g., Sills 2003), and rural development (e.g., Perttula et al. 2000). These
investigations documented a variety of sites ranging from the Paleo-Indian to historic periods in
a variety of landscapes. Prehistoric sites were generally found on landforms near surface water
and historic period sites were found further from water and closer to modern transportation
systems and communities.
In addition to the fieldwork referenced above, several documents have added significantly
to available information on the archaeological record in this region. The project area is part of the
area D.A. Story (1990) discusses as part of the Gulf Coastal Plain, Perttula and Kenmotsu (1993)
include Cherokee County in the Eastern Planning Region of the Texas State Plan, and Perttula
(2004:7 Figure 1.1) includes the Cherokee County in Deep East Texas. Southern Cherokee County
was also included in the McGraw and others (1991) study of the El Camino Real.
The occupation of the area ranges from the Paleo-Indian (ca. prior to 7500 B.C.), Archaic
foraging cultures (7500 – 200 B.C.), Early Ceramic (200 B.C. – A.D. 800), Late Prehistoric
(800–1700 A.D.), to the historic period (A.D. 1700 – present) (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993:44).
The Paleo-Indian period is characterized by small, mobile bands of hunters and gatherers that
consumed a variety of native plants and animals (Story et al. 1990). The Archaic refers to
hunter-gatherers who implemented more regionally specialized approaches toward exploiting
their environment (Story et al. 1990:213). The Archaic was further divided into Early, Middle,
and Late divisions with specialized tools that changed form between the periods and an
increasing population. The Early Ceramic, also referred to as the Woodland (Perttula 2004:9
Table 1.1), represents an increasing utilization of the environment by local groups to include a
greater reliance on cultigens. This greater reliance on cultigens equates to prolonged occupations
at specific locales indicating an increasingly sedentary lifestyle. The emergence of social and ritual
3

ceremonies is indicative of the Early Ceramic period (Story et al. 1990). The prehistory of east
Texas in the Late Prehistoric period essentially concerns the Caddoan culture (A.D. 800-1700).
This culture is an indigenous development strongly influenced by the Mississippian tradition of the
Lower Mississippi Valley (Story et al. 1990). During this period, larger aggregates of people
became sedentary and constructed villages with public ceremonial areas and cemeteries found in
association with large mounds.
The Historic period describes both the history behind the current cultural setting of the
area and marks a transition from the native population’s domination of the area, to the American
immigrants establishment of farms, towns, and counties. The first non-Native people to visit the
area of Cherokee County were Spanish explorers following trails used by native populations in
the seventeenth century. Later, members of the expeditions lead Spanish missionaries and
settlers on larger and more permanent incursions turning the trails into roads in the late
seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries.

In 1714-16 Spanish authorities authorized six

missions and two presidios along the El Camino Real from modern-day San Antonio, Texas to
Robeline, Louisiana to claim the area for Spain. Mission Concepscion was established in western
Nacogdoches County along the Angelina River.
The first Americans to receive a land grant (1798) in the area were William Barr and Peter
Davenport for the land south of the El Camino Real from west of modern-day Alto to east of the
Terroros Bayou in Nacogdoches County. No settlement occurred until Americans Joseph and
Delilah Durst settled in the area of the Angelina River (Linwood Crossing) in the 1820’s (Long
2012). Population in the area grew as more American settlers arrived in the 1830’s. The town of
Rusk was established in April 1846 by legislation but the town did not become populated until
1850. It was not until the 1870’s that the area expanded with the arrival of the railroad (Long
2010). In 1881 the Kansas and Gulf Short Line Railroad connected Tyler and Lufkin passing
through Rusk. An iron foundry was built by the end of the nineteenth century, but it was closed in
1910. The population and business in Rusk has continued to follow the economy; lumber, and iron
ore mining continue employ most of the residents (Long 2010).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
The investigations were performed in compliance with the Texas Antiquities Code
following survey standards described by the Texas Historic Commission (2015) and report
guidelines set forth by the CTA (2005b). All fieldwork and reporting comply with the ethics
standards of the Texas Archaeological Society and the Register of Professional Archaeologists. No
State Antiquities Landmarks will be affected by the proposed construction.
Before initiating fieldwork, DETAC conducted a records and literature review using the
Texas Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2015).

The atlas contains an updated database with

published and unpublished data regarding cultural resource surveys, location maps, and cultural
resources records. In addition, these records show State Archaeological Landmarks (SAL) and
NRHP eligibility of previously recorded sites.
DETAC conducted an intensive pedestrian survey of the project area. To locate sites, the
pedestrian survey relied on shovel testing and visual examination.

Shovel testing included

excavating an area approximately 30 cm in diameter in 10 cm (4 in) levels down to the clay
substrate or 80 cm (32 in). The excavated matrix was screened through a 0.635 cm (0.25 in)
wire mesh screen. Shovel tests were excavated in areas which were not covered in water from
recent rain. The depth of each shovel test was recorded and notes about the soil type and color
were made. Visual examination of the exposed subsurface was a continuous effort between
shovel tests. Exposed subsurfaces included areas stripped of leaf litter by flowing water, over
turned trees, and ant disturbances. Surface inspection photographs and shovel test locations were
recorded with Ashtech GPS units with sub-meter post-processing accuracy. Notes were made
about soil color, texture, and shovel test depth.

RESULTS
The literature search and records review of the Texas Archaeological Site Atlas (2015)
revealed one documented survey for FMHA in 1992 along Hwy 84 roughly 0.6 miles to the
northwest of the project area. No sites were recorded during the survey. Conversely, there are
three sites (41CE44, 41CE351, and 41CE352) between 0.6 and 0.8 miles northeast of the project
area on the Jim Hogg State Park without a documented survey. Site 41CE44 is the location of the
Hogg Family House and Cemetery recorded in 1971. A portion of the Jim Hogg State Park was
surveyed by Stephen F. Austin State University Archaeology students in 2001 under Antiquities
Permit #1373. The SFA survey documented sites 41CE351 as a Cannery and Dam along with
41CE352 as an iron quarry with overburden piles, steep cut banks, and leveled areas. No report is
on file at the THC or at the Stephen F. Austin State University Library.
In addition to these cultural resource management surveys, advocational archaeologists
recorded site 41CE28 as brick ruins from the Star and Crescent iron furnace built in 1893 roughly
0.5 miles southwest of the project area along College Creek (Malone et al.1968). There are several
historical markers in and around Rusk, but none are within line of site of the project area. These
markers commemorate businesses, houses, and residences of Rusk and Cherokee County.
Examination of the archives at the East Texas Research Center did not find any additional
information about the project area; however, the 15-minute, 1943 topographic map of Rusk shows
the project area was inside the city limits and City Lake was already built. Examination of the
Google Earth historical imagery from 1995 revealed the north end of the park was cleared for
baseball fields, the Rusk Civic Center was visible, and the city pool occupied the southern portion
of the park area. These features changed little over the next 19 years with the addition of fill
material between the baseball fields and civic center for a new baseball field.
The previous investigations found archaeological sites in the area are mostly related to
historic settlement and development of Rusk. Soils information suggest that soils are shallow and
that much of the western portion of the project area was quarried at one time. The potential for
finding intact prehistoric archaeological sites is low. Historic period sites are possible, but modern
development of the area may have destroyed any intact features. Description of the proposed trail
route is divided into the visual assessment and shovel test results.

The visual examination of the trail area found the fill material visible in the 2014 imagery
on Google Earth is a baseball field and the northwestern portion of the park is a gravel parking
area. In addition, the pool at the southern end of the park was updated and material was pushed
into the tree line south of the pool into the trail route. Most of the northern and western portion
of the route is in an area heavily disturbed by modern development (Figure 2). Photos were
taken of the disturbance and labeled on the shovel test map (Figure 3). The eastern and southern
portions are less disturbed, but the topography is steep. Vegetation along the southern and
eastern portions of the trail is mixed hardwood and pine trees with a moderate understory of
various bushes and vines. Ground cover is limited to deadfall and leaf litter.
Shovel tests were excavated along the eastern portion of the proposed trail system in
areas with the least obvious disturbance. Testing began at the southern end and continued
northeast, across a small drainage, and ended where the trail enters the disturbed area between
baseball fields (Figure 3). The first two tests found deep, light brown gravelly sandy loam with a
distinct Bt horizon (Table 1). The remaining four tests found exposed red clay directly under the
ground cover or found only 10 cm of dark reddish brown sandy loam over clay. Modern
disturbance was still pronounced with the construction of a new baseball field in the past year
adjacent to the trail route. No cultural features or artifacts were found during the surface
inspection or the shovel testing effort.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultant (DETAC) conducted a cultural resources
survey of a proposed 1,312 m (4,305 ft) long trail for the City of Rusk 2014 TPWD Recreational
Trails Grant in Lions Park. The trail route crosses areas impacted by iron ore mining at the end
of the nineteenth century and develop into multiple baseball fields, a civic center, and city pool
throughout the twentieth century. Texas Antiquities Permit #7309 was obtained by DETAC for
the cultural resources survey of the proposed trail.
A visual examination found the northern and western portions of the trail route were in
areas heavily modified while the southern and eastern portions were less modified, but
topography was steep.

Several photographs were made of the surface disturbance and six

shovel tests were excavated along the new right-of-way in less disturbed areas. Shovel testing
found soils were generally shallow with exposed clay on the surface. No artifacts were found in
the shovel tests or in the visual examination. No artifacts were curated.
In conclusion, the shovel testing and surface inspection did not recover cultural material.
Soils were shallow, gravelly, and clayey. Based on the shovel test results and the visual
examination, there is little chance of encountering undiscovered cultural resources along the trail
route. DETAC is requesting a concurrence with the determination of “no effect” to NRHP
eligible properties for the proposed trail route.
