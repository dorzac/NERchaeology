Archeological Survey of 3.9 acres along K158-00-00

HCFCD Project ID K158-00-00-X003

ABSTRACT

HRA Gray & Pape, LLC, of Houston, Texas, performed an archeological assessment
on an estimated 1.6 hectares (3.9 acres) of property owned by Harris County Flood Control
District (HCFCD) in Harris County, Texas. HCFCD is proposing improvements to control
erosion along the grass-lined K158-00-00 drainage channel extending southward from
Compaq Drive to its mouth at Cypress Creek. The archeological area of potential effect
(APE) for this project was defined as the entire 1.6 hectares (3.9 acres) of property within the
project boundary. Surface observation also indicated that much of the APE including all of
the channel and many areas immediately adjacent to it have been disturbed by natural erosion
and previous construction. The depth of the APE is estimated to be a maximum of 4.4
meters (14.5 feet) in the areas where the channel is to be improved; and at approximately 0.3
meters (one foot) elsewhere on the parcel.
Background research indicates that the entire project area has been previously
surveyed and that 34 archeological sites have been recorded within the 1.6-kilometer (one
mile) project study radius. One of the previously identified archeological sites (41HR333)
may have been recorded within the project area. Field investigation consisted of a walkover,
cutbank inspection, the excavation of one shovel test, and Oakfield probe testing along two
transects adjacent to the K158-00-00 channel. Investigations at Site 41HR333 indicated that
any components of the site that may have been previously been present within the APE have
been severely disturbed.
The goals of the cultural resources survey were to determine if project construction
would affect any previously identified historic properties as defined by Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended (36 CFR 800), and to
establish whether or not previously unidentified cultural resources were located within the
project’s APE. Work done to complete this survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities
Permit Number 4330, issued by the Texas Historical Commission’s Division of Archeology
in November of 2006. All fieldwork and reporting activities were completed with reference
to state (the Antiquities Code of Texas) and federal NHPA guidelines.
No newly identified prehistoric or historic archeological materials were encountered
as a result of the archeological assessment. HRA Gray & Pape recommends that no further
archeological work be required within the project area and that the project be cleared to
proceed as currently planned. If project plans change to include construction west of the
APE in the vicinity of Site 41HR333, HRA Gray & Pape recommends archeological
monitoring in this location during construction.

INTRODUCTION

In September 2006, Harris County Flood Control District (HCFCD) of Houston,
Texas contracted with HRA Gray & Pape, LLC, of Houston, Texas (HRA Gray & Pape), to
perform an archeological assessment on an estimated 1.6 hectares (3.9 acres) of HCFCD Unit
K158-00-00 on property owned by HCFCD in Harris County, Texas (Figure 1). Harris
County Flood Control District is proposing improvements to control erosion along the grasslined K158-00-00 drainage channel extending southward from Compaq Drive to its mouth at
Cypress Creek.
The goals of the cultural resources survey were to determine if project construction
would affect any previously identified historic properties as defined by Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended (36 CFR 800), and to
establish whether or not previously unidentified cultural resources were located within the
project’s Area of Potential Effect (APE). Work done to complete this survey was conducted
under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 4330, issued by the Texas Historical Commission’s
(THC) Division of Archeology in November of 2006. All fieldwork and reporting activities
were completed with reference to state (the Antiquities Code of Texas) and federal NHPA
guidelines.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Archeological Survey of 3.9 acres along K158-00-00

HCFCD Project ID K158-00-00-X003

The APE for this project was defined as the entire 1.6 hectares (3.9 acres) of property
within the project boundary. The depth of the APE is estimated to be a maximum of 4.4
meters (14.5 feet) in the areas where the channel is to be improved; and at approximately 0.3
meters (one foot) elsewhere on the parcel.
Project plans (Appendix A) and correspondence with Mr. Jackson Lamb (personal
communication 2006) of HCFCD indicate that the existing drainage way, spillway, and
associated high banks were previously constructed using a cut and fill technique that
disturbed the ground surface to depths between 20 centimeters (8 inches) and 1.20 meters (47
inches) (Jackson Lamb, personal communication 2006).

Geomorphology and Soils
The project area lies on the floodplain of an unnamed tributary of Cypress Creek,
which is situated in an upland setting within the South Texas [Coastal] Plains physiographic
zone (Pertulla 2004:Figure 1.2). The Texas Coastal Plains make up part of the larger Gulf
Coastal Plain, a low, level to gently sloping region extending from Florida to Mexico
(Perttula 2004; Abbott 2001).
The basic geomorphological characteristics of Harris County resulted from the
combined action of sea level changes from glacial advance in the northern portions of the
continent, and subsequent downcutting and variations in the sediment load capacity of the
region’s rivers. Locally, Harris County is underlain by relatively recent sedimentary rocks
and unconsolidated sediments ranging in age from the Miocene to Holocene, including the
Lissie formation which underlies the project area (Abbott 2001; Barnes 1992; Van Siclen
1991).
Soils in the project area are described in National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS)
(2006), Soil Survey Staff, Natural Resources Conservation Service, United States
Department of Agriculture (SSS NRCS USDA) (2006), and Wheeler (1976). Proceeding
northward from the mouth of K158-00-00 Voss sand (Vs) is mapped at the mouth of the
drainage, and sandy Voss series soils (Vo) extend northward for approximately 100 meters
(328 feet) from the mouth. Much of the remainder of the drainage is mapped in Bissonnet
very fine sandy loam (Bn) except for a small portion of Gessner loam (Ge) mapped at the
extreme northwestern end of the parcel (NCSS 2006; Wheeler 1976).
Descriptions of these soils by Wheeler (1976) and SSS NRCS USDA (2006) indicate
that the Bissonett, and Gessner series soils consist of very deep, poorly drained, slowly
permeable soils that originally formed in coastal prairie habitats on loamy sediments of the
Pleistocene-age Lissie Formation. The Bissonnet very fine sandy loam (SSS NRCS USDA
2006) typically exhibits Ap/A-E(1-2)-BT/E, Btg(1-2) zonation, while Gessner fine sandy
loam type series (SSS NRCS USDA 2006) typically exhibits Ap/A-Eg(1-2)-2Btg(1-6)
zonation. The Gessner loam is often associated with topographically higher portions of
mound-intermound areas separated by lower areas that are often ponded (Wheeler 1976).
Mixing caused by crayfish and worms is quite common throughout the Gessner profile, and

Archeological Survey of 3.9 acres along K158-00-00

HCFCD Project ID K158-00-00-X003

ranges between 25 and 70 percent of the total soil matrix (SSS NRCS USDA 2006).
Bissonnet soils are in slightly lower elevations and have coarser textures (SSS NRCS USDA
2006).
Descriptions of Voss series soils by Wheeler (1976) and SSS NRCS USDA (2006)
indicate that these soils also occur on floodplains and consist of very deep, moderately well
drained, rapidly permeable soils formed in deep sandy sediments. Voss series soils typically
exhibit A-C (1-2) zonation, are sandy throughout and are found adjacent to stream channels
(Wheeler 1976).
The Bissonnet and Gessner series soils in the project area are mapped in Potential
Archeological Liability Map (PALM) Unit 4 (Abbott 2001:figure 65). The PALM system is
a model developed by the Texas Department of Transportation to help assess the
geoarcheological likelihood of detecting significant prehistoric cultural resources in various
geomorphological settings in the greater Houston area (Abbott 2001:151-168). For PALM
Unit 4 the probability of detecting significant resources is very low due largely to processes
of urbanization associated with the growth and expansion of the Houston area in the
twentieth century (Abbott 2001). Abbott (2001:table 2) classifies Gessner series soils as lowmoderate potential soils, and Bissonnet series soils as low potential soils with respect to the
likelihood of detecting intact buried cultural resources. In contrast, Abbott (2001) describes
Voss series soils with a high potential for containing intact buried cultural resources. Voss
soils are often mapped in PALM Units 1 through 3, (Abbott 2001:figure 65) because in some
instances they can cap buried soils with cultural resources. However, it should be noted that
Voss soils along Cypress Creek in the vicinity of the project (see Pickering et al. 2006; see
Figure 1) have not yielded resources that were not detectable by conventional pedestrian
survey methods (e.g. walkover, shovel testing and cutbank inspection).

ENVIRONMENTAL & CULTURAL SETTING

The regional environmental setting of the project area has been discussed in detail in
more extensive recent investigations of northwest Harris County (see Abbott 2001; Pickering
et al. 2006). The prehistory of the southeast Texas region, which includes Harris County, is
also discussed in detail elsewhere (Hall 1981; Patterson 1985, 1996; Perttula, ed. 2004;
Ricklis 2004; Story 1990). Within this chronological context, the oldest prehistoric sites in
Harris County can be found around Clear Lake, and date to approximately 4,000 B.C. placing
them in the latter part of the Early Archaic (Henson 2005). The evidence of inland human
occupation is fragmentary, particularly in the uplands where archeological data are derived
largely from multicomponent sites with mixed deposits, rather than stratified sites associated
with river valleys draining the county (Abbott 2001; Ricklis 2004:201-202). The reader is
encouraged to turn to these sources for additional information on regional environment and
prehistory.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
This archeological assessment was designed to identify and assess preliminarily
cultural resources that may be impacted by the proposed project. Potential buried and
surface archeological resources fall within the purview of this investigation.
The intensive pedestrian survey consisted of walkover, surface inspection, and
systematic subsurface testing consisting of shovel testing supplemented with a 2.5-centimeter
(1-inch) Oakfield soil probe. During the walkover, a visual reconnaissance of the entire
project area was conducted.
Background and site file research was initiated prior to fieldwork mobilization. The
background literature search included a review of both archeological site files and
architectural resource files, and a review of previously conducted cultural resource surveys in
the vicinity. This information was obtained by reviewing records through the on-line Texas
Sites Atlas, maintained by the THC. As part of the literature search, HRA Gray & Pape
attempted to document previously identified resources located within a 1.6-kilometer (one mile)
radius of the project area. Cultural resources searched for during this literature search included
previously recorded archeological sites, and previously conducted cultural resources surveys.
Soil survey maps of the parcel were also examined in an attempt to identify the soils that
underlie the project area. In addition, a review of aerial imagery of the project area, and of
data concerning the project provided by the HCFCD was also conducted prior to a site visit
in an attempt to identify landuse, disturbances, and structures on the property and to
preliminarily assess which parts of the parcel would require subsurface testing, and which
parts were disturbed and would only require surface inspection (Appendix A).
Archeological survey methods utilized during the intensive pedestrian survey consisted
of observation point survey. Observation points provide a reference to maintain horizontal
control and provenience across a given survey area. In general, these observation points are
positioned at 30-meter (100-foot) intervals in areas considered to possess high probability for
containing cultural materials, and at wider intervals in low-potential areas. Regardless of the
interval, linear transects were utilized for the positioning of the observation points across the
specific survey area. Dependent upon the terrain, environmental setting, and groundcover
identified at each observation point location, one of two possible actions (surface inspection or
subsurface testing) was performed. All actions performed at a specific observation point
location, the general observations of the surveyor, and the results of survey actions were
recorded on an observation point log, which include provenience, survey method, and cultural
materials identified.
Methods of subsurface testing included subsurface probing with a 2.5-centimeter (1­
inch) Oakfield probe; shovel testing; and examination of exposed soil profiles along artificial
and natural cutbanks in drainages and other excavations. Oakfield probes are 2.5-centimeter
(1-inch) diameter, hollow soil probes that penetrate soil. The type used on this project
retrieves an approximately 35-centimeter (14-inch) deep soil core. Use of the probe

permitted rapid assessment of the nature of soil and sediment composition over a large area,
and was used to detect the presence of a plowzone, fill, and other near-surface soil
disturbances.
Shovel testing was the preferred method of subsurface survey in undisturbed areas. It
consisted of the placement of a series of 30-centimeter by 30-centimeter (12-inch by 12-inch)
shovel tests within the proposed access road right-of-way (ROW). Vertical control was
maintained by excavating each shovel test in 10-centimeter (4-inch) levels. One wall of each
shovel test was profiled and the walls and floor of each shovel test were inspected for color
or texture change potentially associated with the presence of cultural features. When
possible, soils were screened through 0.64-centimeter (0.25-inch) wire mesh; soils with high
clay content were hand sorted in an effort to detect cultural materials in the soil matrix.
When subsoils proved to hard to hand excavate, an Oakfield probe was extended into the
base of the shovel test to assess deeper stratigraphy. All shovel tests were backfilled after
excavations and documentations of them were completed.
Cutbank inspection consisted of examination of natural strata exposed by erosion and
artificial excavations (e.g. walls of drainage ditches). If necessary, the walls of cutbanks
were scraped with a trowel to remove overburden in order to clearly expose underlying soil
stratigraphy. In some cases, these areas were probe-tested using the Oakfield soil probe to
assess whether natural stratigraphy was intact. Various soil strata and surface disturbances
were also probed in order to examine soil properties. Materials observed in the soil profile
along the cutbank were documented, but the soil from cutbanks was not screened to search
for artifacts.
The soil profiles observed in archeological tests were all recorded using approaches
for describing basic soil properties found in Munsell (2000) and Vogel (2002). Comparisons
of soil profiles observed in the field to the soil series type sections available in SSS NRCS
USDA (2006) and Wheeler (1976) were also conducted.

RESULTS OF SITE FILE AND LITERATURE SEARCH
Aerial imagery and soil survey maps (NCSS 2006; USGS 1970, 1995, 2002; Wheeler
1976:sheet 31) were studied as part of this project in an effort to assess historic and recent
land use in the project area, and to identify possible historical structures in and near the
project boundary. With respect to land use, a view of maps and aerial images indicated that
much of the parcel is apparently disturbed by agricultural practices. Analysis of topographic
maps of the surrounding area indicated that the channel and portions of the high bank
adjacent to K158-00-00 have been disturbed by previous construction consisting of
channalization of the drainage and placement of a cement spillover dam near the mouth of
the drainage.
Studies of the aerial imagery and maps also helped assess the possibility of historic
structures being present in and near the project area. Buildings were mapped near the project

area on early maps, but they were well outside the project (NCSS 2006; USGS, 1970, 1982
1995, 2002; Wheeler 1976; Hale 1977).
Background research conducted using the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas, an online
resource maintained by the THC indicated that portions of previously recorded
multicomponent Site 41HR333 may be located within the APE, and that 33 additional
archeological sites or historic structures are located within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the
current project (Table 1). Research also indicted that the area has been previously surveyed.

Previous Investigations
Background research indicates that several cultural resources surveys have been
conducted in proximity to the project area (see Figure 1). Limited information was available
regarding the earliest survey conducted. This survey was concentrated around Cypress Creek
and was conducted in 1978 on behalf of the United States Army Corps of Engineers
(USACE). It appears that numerous cultural resources were located during that survey. In
1991 and 1992, surveys were conducted on behalf of the Federal Highway Administration in
the vicinity of Cypress Creek. It does not appear that any cultural resources were located
during those investigations.
In 2003, Moore Archeological Consulting Inc. conducted a survey of 120 acres for a
Cypress Creek floodplain preservation area for HCFCD (K-100-00-00) (Porter 2003). Based
on information provided by the Archeological Sites Atlas, the survey resulted in 20 new
prehistoric archeological sites. No National Register recommendations were available.
In 2004, HRA Gray & Pape conducted a survey of 100 acres for a development
project northeast of the current project area (Hughey 2004). No cultural resources were
located as a result of the survey.
In 2006, Paul Price Associates, Inc. (PPA) conducted a survey for a proposed hike
and bike trail on behalf of the Harris County Municipal Utility District No. 286 (Schroeder
and Weaver 2006). One new Site (41HR984) was recorded. Site 41HR984 is a shallowly
buried prehistoric open campsite containing a Paleo-Indian component. Paul Price
Associates, Inc. recommended avoidance of the site based on the site having similar
characteristics to nearby sites where further work was recommended (Schroeder and Weaver
2006).
Previously Recorded Site 41HR333
Site 41HR333, recorded in 1977 by Tom Hale, was described as a large Late
Prehistoric campsite located on a terrace near an old spring, although ethnographic

informants have suggested that it may also contain historic components. The historic
portions of the site are described as the remains of Civil War encampments. Hale noted that
examination of artifacts in a private collection from the site suggest an older prehistoric
temporal affiliation. Hale’s description of the site does not outline any recommendation or
potential for National Register eligibility. Hale does note on the site form that it “could be a
stratified totally intact long term camp (excellent site)” (Hale 1977).
A comparison of Hale’s sketch map drawn in 1977 of Site 41HR333 with more recent
maps of the area indicates that the site may be located within or close to the APE. There is
no site boundary provided on the Archeological Sites Atlas. The lack of a defined site
boundary posed a problem in determining how much of the site was located within the APE.
The only available data was the recorded Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates
and the site boundary as it was depicted on Hales’ (1977) sketch map. However, the location
of the centroid in tandem with Hale’s written description places Hale’s work at Site
41HR333 north-northwest of a “green tank”, south of Cypress Creek (Figure 2). It appears
that Hale is referring to the large water tanks that are visible on aerial imagery and soil
survey maps (NCSS 2006; USGS 1970, 1995, 2002; Wheeler 1976). Based on the recorded
location of test units excavated by Hale in 1977 and the UTM coordinates, it is likely that the
site has been misplotted on the Archeological Sites Atlas. The location of the water tanks
indicate that it Hale’s work was conducted outside of the APE for the current project (Figure
2).

RESULTS OF ARCHEOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT SURVEY

Survey activities were designed to assess the potential impact that the proposed
construction might have on cultural resources located within the proposed project area. To
accomplish this the entire project area was surveyed along three transects consisting of the
high banks at both edges of the channel and the channel itself (Figure 3). The entire area was
subjected to visual reconnaissance during the walkover. Investigations also included the
excavation of one shovel test that was supplemented by cutbank inspection and Oakfield
probe testing along both banks in order to determine the nature of disturbances visible on the
surface and in aerial images (Figure 3).
During the walkover survey of the K158-00-00 channel, a number of severely eroded
cutbanks (Figure 3) were observed. The erosion appears to result from downcutting of the
stream during high-energy stream flow events (e.g. floods associated with major rainfall).
Several of these eroded areas exposed artificial fill and suggested previous mechanical grading.
Scarps associated with slumps and cutbanks along both sides the channel offered sufficient
ground surface visibility (>80 percent) for surface inspection. No cultural materials were
detected on the ground surface. There also was ample evidence of subsurface disturbances
resulting from construction of the artificial drainage, ditch digging, culvert installation and other
previous construction adjacent to the drainage (Figure 3; Plates 1 and 2). Modern trash,
apparently derived from upstream sources, formed a light scatter over the project area.
Subsurface probing using a 2.5-centimeter (one-inch) Oakfield soil probe was
conducted at 60-meter (120-foot) intervals along transects parallel to the K158-00-00 stream.
Its purpose was to explore for signs of disturbance. The probe-tests extended to a depth of 30
centimeters (12 inches) and detected fill horizons disturbed by construction, corroborating
evidence from previously excavated boreholes conducted by HCFCD (Appendix A).
Surface observation also indicated that much of the APE including all of the channel
and many areas immediately adjacent to it have been disturbed by natural erosion and
construction. Examination of exposed cutbanks along the channel failed to detect any
evidence of paleosols or cultural materials along the length of K158-00-00. However, thick
fill layers were observed along the cutbank.

Previously Recorded Site 41HR333
Investigations near Site 41HR333 included limited shovel testing and inspection of
the large cutbank along the west bank of K158-00-00 where a portion of the site may have
been present (Figure 3, Plates 3 and 4). One fragment of modern rebar was found in the upper
Voss C-horizon in the cutbank at the boundary of Site 41HR333 during cutbank inspection.
The cutbank and surface inspection indicated that erosion has impacted much of Site
41HR333 in and near the APE. For this reason, only one shovel test could be excavated in

the vicinity of Site 41HR333 within the APE (see Figure 3).
Shovel Test 1 was placed on a narrow level portion of the right bank within five
meters of a stable portion of the stream bank in order to determine if any of Site 41HR433
within the project area was undisturbed. The test detected an Ap/fill horizon of Voss soil
underlain by natural C-horizons of sand with clay pockets and stringers typical of other Voss
profiles along this stretch of the Cypress Creek drainage system in the area. The shovel test
produced a mixture of historic and prehistoric artifacts and ecofacts consisting of one modern
nail; one possible tested cobble; fragment of possibly carbonized nutshell, and one fragment
of charcoal. All of these materials were recovered from the plowzone (Ap horizon). It was
not clear if these materials derived from the site or part of the fill used to construct the K15800-00 drainage channel. It appears if Site 41HR333 extended this far east within the APE, it
has severely eroded and been impacted by previous construction.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
This report presents the results of a cultural resources management archeological
assessment survey conducted on property proposed for drainage improvements along
portions of the K158-00-00 drainage channel, maintained by HCFCD in Harris County,
Texas. Prior to fieldwork mobilization, a background literature and site file search was
conducted to identify the presence of recorded sites near the project area. The search
indicated that portions of one previously recorded archeological site may have been located
within the APE and 33 additional sites or structures are located within a 1.6-kilometers (one
mile) radius of the project area. No architectural resources appearing to be over 50 years in
age were identified in or adjacent to the project area as a result of background research.
Field investigation consisted of a pedestrian survey, cutbank inspection, the
excavation of one shovel test in the vicinity of previously recorded Site 41HR333, and
Oakfield probe-testing along two transects adjacent to the K158-00-00 channel. Soils
encountered during this survey generally conformed to the soils described by Wheeler (1976)
and online (SSS NRCS USDA 2006) for Bissonnet, Gessner, and Voss series soils. A small,
narrow, topographically high, potentially undisturbed level area within Site 41HR333 was
the focal point of the shovel testing.
The one shovel test excavated produced what were thought to be a mixture of historic
and prehistoric artifacts from an Ap/fill horizon. However, closer examination proved
that they were of modern origin. These included one modern nail fragment and one
fragment of machine-cut gravel with no bulbs of percussion or other evidence of being a
prehistoric artifact (Plate 5). These materials and the four fragments of charcoal were all
recovered from a disturbed Ap/fill-horizon clearly visible in the cutbank 5 meters east of
the shovel test. The cutbank to the north and east, the fence to the west, and the sloping
eroded bank to the south all delineated the “positive” test in four cardinal directions.
The oakfield probes, cutbank inspections, and surface observations along the artificial
drainage, as well as the evidence from the geotechnical borings, indicated that severe

ground disturbance occurred within the APE as the result of previous construction of the
artificial drainage. The materials described above were found near the platted position
(centroid) for 41HR333. Shovel testing was conducted in the only potentially intact
stretch of ground anywhere near the platted position of 41HR333 within the APE. The
proposed channel modifications consist of minimally ground disruptive placement of
riprap to stabilize the artificial channel.
Shovel Test 1 was placed in an area underlain by an Ap/fill horizon less than 46
centimeters (18 inches) deep and produced these modern materials. A good faith effort was
made in attempting to relocate 41HR333. In addition, the shallow depth to Pleistocene
sediments across the APE precludes the use of deep trenching. Site 41HR333 is not
preserved intact within the APE.

HCFCD plans indicate that disturbed areas near Site 41HR333 will not likely be
impacted to any great depth by construction as currently planned. This is because the
proposed techniques of stream bank stabilization consist of the placement of riprap and
culverts as opposed to cutting and filling during construction (Appendix A).
No newly identified prehistoric or historic archeological resources were encountered
as a result of the archeological assessment conducted along the K158-00-00 drainage
channel. HRA Gray & Pape recommends that no further archeological work be required
within the project area and that the project be cleared to proceed as currently planned. If
project plans change to include deep impacts west of the APE in the vicinity of Site
41HR333, HRA Gray & Pape recommends archeological monitoring in this location during
construction.

INTRODUCTION
This scope of work outlines the tasks associated with performing an archeological
assessment survey on property proposed for the replacement of a failed concrete control
structure and repair of severe erosion along a channelized segment of Cypress Creek in
northwest Harris County, Texas. The project area is defined as approximately 3.9 acres of
property along Harris County Flood Control District (HCFCD) Unit ID K158-00-00X003 from immediately south of Compaq Center Drive to its confluence with Cypress
Creek. HCFCD Unit ID K158-00-00-X003 traverses privately owned commercial
property associated with the Compaq Campus. It is the understanding of HRA Gray &
Pape that the property consists of publicly owned state land controlled by HCFCD. The
project is located on the Satsuma 7.5-minute United States Geological Survey (USGS)
topographic quadrangle map
The Area of Potential Effect (APE) is defined as all property proposed for the
replacement of a failed concrete control structure and repair of severe erosion along 1,300
feet (396 meters) within a 130-foot (39.6-meter) right-of-way (ROW) that is maintained
by HCFCD. Work in this area will take place on property that appears to be partially
commercially developed in the northern section, and moderately forested in the southern
half as it approaches the Cypress Creek confluence. This scope of work assumes that the
depth of impact will be deep in some areas, however, the nature of deep impacts along
the HCFCD Unit ID K158-00-00-X003 project area is not presently well known, and will
be at the discretion of the project engineer.

PROJECT BACKGROUND
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) previously surveyed the project
area in 1977, and resulted in the identification of one multicomponent (prehistoric and
historic) resource (Site 41HR333). Several other sites were recorded in the vicinity of the
project area along both banks of Cypress Creek. Site 41HR333 is situated on a ridge near
a spring north of Cypress Creek. The large possibly long-term prehistoric habitation site
produced abundant Late Prehistoric materials but local collections indicated older
occupations. The site was also thought to be a Civil War encampment based on its
proximity to the spring. Based on current maps, the site lies on private commercial
property (Compaq Campus) but may extend eastward along the north bank of Cypress
Creek into Chasewood Park.
Erosion has been particularly severe along portions of the channel within HCFCD
Unit ID K158-00-00-X003. It is also known that previous archeological surveys along
this stretch of Unit ID K158-00-00-X003 have been largely limited to surface collection
and the excavation of two test pits to a depth of approximately three feet (one meter).

PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN
This work will be conducted to satisfy requirements set forth by the National
Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) and the Texas Antiquities Code. All work will be
conducted following accepted standards set forth by the THC and the Council of Texas
Archeologists (CTA).
HRA Gray & Pape will conduct research at the state repositories and in the
project area to gather cultural resource data. The objective of data gathering activities is
to acquire all information necessary to build a historic context for the project area, and
the discovery and delineation of existing archeological resources that will potentially be
affected by construction of the hike and bike trail. Specific tasks necessary to complete
this study include State Historic Preservation Office consultation, archaeological site file
research, National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) research, subsurface archeological
testing, photography, and reporting activities.

AGENCY COORDINATION
Agency coordination will involve setting project objectives with the Texas
Historical Commission (THC) and the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE),
Galveston District.

PROJECT LOGISTICS AND STAFFING PLAN
HRA Gray & Pape has sufficient in-house staff to provide support for logistics,
artifact analysis and processing, graphic arts, report preparation, computer and technical
assistance, and accounting. HRA Gray & Pape has identified sufficient temporary
personnel to staff Technician level positions for all anticipated survey crews.

BACKGROUND RESEARCH
Site file research will take place at TARL in Austin, Texas or by consulting the on
line Texas Archeological Sites Atlas, and will result in a listing of all archeological sites
and National Register properties within one 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the project area.
Site file research will be used to supplement the development of a historic context
to the area. Additional documentary research will be conducted in order to provide an
understanding of the development and history of the surrounding area, and to develop a
regional context of the area and discuss the significance of previously identified National
Register properties.

3

If appropriate, historic maps will be consulted in an attempt to determine the
impact that recent construction activities may have had on potential archaeological
deposits located in urban or developed settings.

ARCHEOLOGICAL SURVEY METHODS
The survey plan calls for the use of a crew composed of a Principal Investigator
assisted by one technician. Investigation will begin on parts of the property already
known to contain cultural resources from preliminary background research and work up
and down stream channel.
The archeological assessment will include an evaluation of the damage to
previously recorded resources and attempt to identify any new resources threatened by
erosion or the proposed project. Archeological assessment will consist of visual
inspection of all exposed cutbanks, a walkover survey, and photo-documentation of the
project area.
An attempt will be made to relocate previously recorded Site 41HR333. All sites
will be photographed and mapped with particular emphasis placed on documenting
erosion and construction related damage. Preliminary management recommendations
will be made in the letter report.
Cutbank inspection will be conducted at all eroded areas along the 1,300-foot
(396- meter) length of Unit ID K158-00-00-X003. The aim of the cutbank inspection is
to identify any deeply buried cultural resources or high potential paleosols that may have
been impacted by erosion along this length of channel. Cutbanks will be scraped with a
trowel and or shovel in order to expose stratigraphy. Representative cutbank profiles and
any erosional or cultural features detected in cutbanks will be measured, mapped in
profile, photographed and documented on field forms and maps. Diagnostic artifacts
detected during cutbank inspection will be collected; other artifacts will be recorded.
It is assumed that prior construction has destroyed the integrity of Site 41HR333.
However, should the initial assessment determine that additional intensive pedestrian
survey or deep testing by track hoe is necessary, the cost for additional investigation will
be determined under a supplemental task order. HRA Gray & Pape will consult with
HCFCD concerning the need and level of effort for additional survey in the project area
after the assessment has been completed.

ARTIFACT CURATION
HRA Gray & Pape will pursue a “no collect” strategy for artifacts, unless
diagnostic artifacts that cannot be accurately typed in the field are encountered. In the
event that artifacts are collected, HRA Gray & Pape will negotiate an appropriate
curation agreement and fee with an appropriate repository. Archeological survey and

4

excavation records will be included in the curation agreement with the Texas repository.
Until final arrangements are made for the disposition of project artifacts and records,
HRA Gray & Pape will maintain these items in their temporary curation facility.

LABORATORY ANALYSES
All artifacts will be washed (unless detrimental to the item) and sorted by artifact
