ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of the proposed 362 acre (146 hectares) Brazos Valley Solid Waste
Management Agency, Inc. (BVSWMA, Inc.) East Expansion Project, in Grimes County, Texas
was performed by Ed Baxter Consulting in April, May, June and July of 2017. Edward P. Baxter
was the Principal Investigator and the Project Archaeologist. The survey took a total of ten man
days in the field. This study was completed under Texas Antiquities Committee Permit Number
7987. The project area was investigated using the pedestrian survey method supported by shovel
testing. In all, the project area surveyed consisted of 294 acres (119 hectares) since previous
archaeological surveys have been conducted on 68 acres (28 hectares) of the tract. No previously
recorded archaeological sites or cemeteries were found in the project area. The survey found no
new archaeological sites. Copies of the final report are housed at the Texas Historical
Commission (THC), Archeology Division, the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL), the Texas State Library, and at Ed Baxter Consulting (College Station, Texas).

INTRODUCTION
Brazos Valley Solid Waste Management Agency Inc. (BVSWMA, Inc.) Twin Oaks
Landfill is an existing Type I municipal solid waste facility. It is located approximately 7.4 miles
(11.9 kilometers) east of the city of College Station in Grimes County, Texas (Figure 1). State
Highway 30 fronts its northern boundary. BVSWMA, Inc. is proposing to add 362 acres (146
hectares) on the eastern side of the existing facility. Previous archaeological surveys have been
conducted on 68 acres (28 hectares) of the tract. The remaining 294 acres (119 hectares) was
investigated using the pedestrian survey method supported by shovel testing. The project area is
depicted on the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Ferguson Crossing, Texas 7.5â
topographic quadrangle, 3096-31 (Figure 2a) and the Texas Natural Resource Information
Service (TNRIS) 2017 Stratmap series 3096312 (Figure 2b).
Portions of the 362 acre area will be cleared of vegetation and used for the stockpiling of
excavated soil from the existing landfill. The rest will remain undisturbed at this time.
The area is currently owned by BVSWMA, Inc. Prior to this, the area was privately
owned and consisted of pasture and forest used for ranching and deer hunting.
An intermittent portion of Alum Creek and an intermittent unnamed tributary of Alum
Creek are located in the northern portion of the project area. An intermittent tributary of Dinner
Creek is present in the southern portion of the project area.
An archaeological survey of the tract was conducted at the request of BVSWMA, Inc. to
support future development. The Texas Historical Commission (THC) issued Antiquities Permit
7987 to Ed Baxter Consulting.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Grimes County is located within the West Gulf Coastal Plain section of the Coastal Plain
physiographic province as defined by Fenneman (1938:100-120). Fenneman subdivides this
province according to the age of the geological formations (Gulf series) that roughly parallel the
Texas coastline. The area is hilly and situated within the East Texas timber belt. Gould (1969)
describes it as an area characterized by gently rolling to hilly topography with light colored soils
that are acidic sandy loams or sands. The climate is sub humid to humid, and the weather is
considered to be predominately warm. Annual rainfall for Grimes County is 40 inches. A January
average temperature of 49.3 o Fahrenheit and a July average temperature of 84.5 o Fahrenheit
combine to produce a growing season of 278 days (Greenwade 1996:2). The altitude varies from
180-460 feet.
There are two ecoregions in Grimes County, the Post Oak Savannah and the Southeastern
remnant of the Blackland Prairie also known as the San Antonio Prairie. Gould (1975:3)
describes these two Ecoregions.
The Post Oak Savannah has been variously classified as savannah or as part of the
oak-hickory or deciduous forest formation. Included are both the East and West Cross
Timbers of northeastern Texas. Topography of the Post Oak Savannah is gently rolling to
hilly. Elevations are from 300 to 800 feet. Annual rainfall is 35 to 45 inches, with most
precipitation usually in May and June. Climax grasses of the Post Oak Savannah are
Schizachyrium scoparium var. frequens, Sorghastrum nutans, Panicum vh-gatum, Tridens
flavus, Bothriochloa saccharoides var. longipaniculata and C hasmanthium laxum. The
overstory primarily is Quercus stellata (post oak), Q. marilandica (blackjack oak) and
species of Cary a (hickory). Brush and tree densities have increased tremendously from the
virgin condition. The project area is within the Post Oak Savannah.
The Blackland Prairies have a gently rolling to nearly level topography, with darkcolored calcareous clay soils developed under prairie grass - forb vegetation. Average
annual rainfall varies from about 30 inches on the west to slightly more than 40 inches on
the east. For the most part, the fertile Blackland Prairie soils have been brought under
cultivation, but small acreages of meadowland remain in climax tall grass vegetation. Little
bluestem, Schizachyrium scopariwn var. frequ ens, has been determined to be the climax
dominant. Other important grasses are Andropogon gerardii, Sorghastrum nt/tans,
Panictl1n v i1-gatum, Bouteloua curtipendula, B. hirsuta, Sporobolus asper, Bothriochloa
saccharoides and S tipa leucotricha .
Grimes County is located within the Brazos River and Trinity River drainage basins. The
western part of the county drains into the Navasota and Brazos Rivers. The northeast corner of
the county drains into Bedias Creek and the Trinity River. The southeastern part of the county
drains toward the San Jacinto River (Greenwade 1996).
The Geologic Atlas of Texas (https://tnris.org/data.catalog/entry/geologic-atlas-of-texas)
shows the geologic makeup of the county is varied. The geologic units are depicted in Figure 3
and described in Table 1 below. The project area is within the Pow series which is in the
Pliocene but is surrounded Eocene and Holocene deposits.

The project area is located on a 362 acre (146 hectares) tract of land that is drained by an
intermittent section of Alum Creek on the north and an intermittent section of Dinner Creek on the
south. Alum Creek flows into Panther Creek which is a tributary of the Navasota River. Dinner
Creek is also a tributary of the Navasota River. Non-flowing water was present in Alum Creek
(Figure 4a.) at the time of this survey and much of Dinner Creek was dry (Figure 4b.). Ground
cover in the project area varied from tall grass with scattered trees (Figure 4c.) to very dense brush
and trees (Figure 4d.). Project area elevations vary from 225 feet along the creek bottoms to 290
feet in the uplands.

Figure 4. Views of the Project Area
Vegetation specific to the project area (Figure 5) was mapped by the Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department (TPWD) (https://tpwd.texas.gov/gis/programs/landscape-ecology/byÂ­
ecoregion). They describe the project area as being in the East Central Texas Plains Southern Post
Oak Savannah with the following specific divisions and areas: Post Oak Savanna: Post Oak Motte
and Woodland, 283 acres (115 hectares); Post Oak Savanna: Savanna Grassland, 38 acres (15
6

hectares); Post Oak Savanna: Post Oak - Yaupon Motte and Woodland, <1 acres (<1 hectares);
Central Texas: Floodplain Hardwood Forest, 5 acres, (2 hectares); Central Texas: Riparian
Hardwood Forest, 20 acres (8 hectares); Central Texas: Riparian Herbaceous Vegetation, 1 acre
(<1 hectares); Barren, 1 acre (<1 hectares); Urban Low Intensity, 2 acres (1 hectare). GIS data
and vegetation descriptions can be found at https://tpwd.texas.gov/gis/programs/landscapeÂ­
ecology/by-ecoregion. Since the time of this TPWD study a portion of the Post Oak Motte and
Woodland was cleared for pasture.

PREHISTORIC/HISTORIC INDIAN CHRONOLOGY
A published planning document for the Eastern Planning Region of Texas (Kenmotsu and
Perttula 1993) places Grimes County within the Southeast Texas archeological study region (Figure
1 above). Summaries relevant to the prehistory of Grimes County and vicinity have been
summarized by various archaeologists, who completed Cultural Resource Management (CRM)
studies work spanning the last 60 years.
Paleo-Indian Period
The Paleo-Indian period is the time following the Pleistocene Ice Age in North America
when early prehistoric Americans pursued megafauna such as mammoth, mastodon and a nowextinct species of bison with food collecting not a major pursuit (Willey and Phillips 1958:80).
Story et al. (1990) have suggested that plants and other smaller animals probably were as important
to the Paleo-Indians as the large animals. Owens (2009) thinks that there is little evidence in the
southeast Texas region for hunting of extinct megafauna, as has been documented elsewhere in
North America; rather, he states that a broad-based subsistence pattern appears to have been
practiced during all prehistoric time periods. The Paleo-Indiansâ lithic technology was superb as
demonstrated the projectile points of this era. Patterson (1995) divides the Paleo-Indian period in
East Texas into early and late components based on the projectile points. He sees the Early PaleoÂ­
9

Indian period lasting from 10,000 B.C. to 8,000 B.C. as represented by Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, San
Patrice, and Big Sandy fluted projectile points. The Late Paleo-Indian period is seen as lasting from
8,000 B.C. to 5000 B.C. as represented by Plainview, Scottsbluff, Meserve, and Angostura unÂ­
fluted lanceolate points. In the east Texas area, early man points are typically found on the surface.
The best known site of this period in Southeast Texas is the McFaddin Beach Site, (41JF50). At this
site numerous Paleo-Indian artifacts have been collected from the beach causing archaeologists to
speculate that the actual site is under the waters of the Gulf of Mexico and was inhabited during the
ice age when sea levels were lower. Dates for the time span of this period vary; Ensor (1991:8)
believes it lasted circa 10,000 B.C. to 8,000 B.C. while Patterson (1995) thinks that in Southeast
Texas it was from circa 10,000 B.C. to 5000 B.C. based on his projectile point typology analysis.
No Paleo-Indian sites have been reported near the project area. Evidence of an early culture in the
Navasota Basin has been identified in the Lake Limestone area (Prewitt 1974; Prewitt and
Mallouf 1977; Mallouf 1979; Wooldridge et a1. 1982). To the south of the project area, in Austin
County, a possible Paleo-Indian component has been identified on AlIens Creek (Dillehay et al.
1972).
Archaic Period
The Archaic Period follows the Paleo-Indian Period and is thought to have marked the time
of the extinction of Pleistocene megafauna. During this time small bands of hunters and gatherers
roamed the countryside in search of plants and small animals. The greater number of sites from this
period indicates a greater population. The period is divided into the Early, Middle, and Late periods
based on characteristic types of artifacts, especially projectile points. Ricklis (2004) has
presented a chronology of dart points for this period in East Texas. These tool assemblages
suggest differences in economy, technology, and possibly regional adaptations (Feit et al. 2008).
Dippel (2001:4-2) states that the Archaic in East Texas lasted from 6000 B.C. to 200 B.C. Duffield
(1963) views the Early Archaic as a transitional period from Paleo-Indian to Archaic times, based
on a marked change in technology rather than subsistence. Coleman et al. (1984) believe that these
changes may have been the result of population increases that produced a greater emphasis on
territoriality and a greater reliance on the inferior local lithic resources.
Within the upper Navasota River Basin, Prewitt (1974) identified a transitional
occupation within the Early Archaic which he interpreted as a modification of the commonly
assumed Paleo-Indian subsistence strategy. Research by some archaeologists (Perttula and Skiles
1987; Story 1985; Perttula 1995) at Early Archaic sites indicates that these groups tended to be
small, highly mobile, and widely scattered with recurrent occupations centered on terrace and
upland projections within major river basins. According to Dippel (2001:4-2), the Middle Archaic
is the first well-documented period in the region. According to her, âthe distribution of these sites
tends to indicate a settlement system based along the major basins and more limited use of smaller
tributaries and headwater areas.â Dippel states that subsistence strategies still depended on a
hunting and gathering economy, but there was a greater reliance on native plants. She also states
that the Late Archaic period is the best documented Archaic component in the Piney Woods of East
Texas (Dippel 2001:4-3). Late Archaic period sites outnumber those of the previous periods. The
greater number of sites suggests that a significant population growth occurred during this time
(Feit et al. 2008). Data from Late Archaic sites in Southeast Texas also indicate that people were
becoming more sedentary. Late Archaic sites are more widely distributed throughout the region
10

(Shafer 1975; Perttula 1995). Cemeteries came into being in the Archaic period as well (Story et
al. 1990) and became an integral part of the late Archaic (Ricklis 2004). The majority of the
prehistoric sites found during the various Texas Municipal Power Agency (TMPA)
archaeological projects (Bond, 1977; Fletcher, 1979; Ippolito, 1979; Glander et al, 1986; and
Rogers, 1992, 1993, and 1995) were Late Archaic sites.
Late Prehistoric Period
This period has been referred to by some as the Neo-American Stage (Suhm et al. 1954),
Neo-archaic (Prewitt 1981), and Post-Archaic (Johnson and Goode 1994). The Late Prehistoric
Period in East Texas is an indigenous development that was strongly influenced by the
Mississippian tradition of the Lower Mississippi Valley (Story et al. 1990). Caddo subsistence
and social organization differed markedly from the preceding Archaic periods. The practices of
horticulture and agriculture became the chief subsistence activity while hunting and gathering
became secondary. This lifeway change created sedentary populations who inhabited villages.
The permanency and a surplus of labor led to the development of public ceremonial areas, and
the construction of ceremonial mounds that often were used as burial places. Service (1962,
1975) states that extensive commercial networks were established and a stratified social structure
developed corresponding to the chiefdom level. Perttula (2004) divides the development of the
Caddo culture into five separate development stages. These are the Woodland Period; the
Formative Period; and the Early, Middle, and Late Caddo periods. The most common types of
Caddoan settlement were hamlets and farmsteads, although larger communities were established in
association with mound centers (Perttula 1995).
Late Prehistoric tribes within East Texas include the Adai, Atakapa, Caddo, and the
Hasinai. The Atakapans lived along the Lower Neches and Sabine rivers between the San
Jacinto River in Texas and Vermillion Bay. They occupied an area in East Texas from the Sabine
River south to Galveston Bay and north to present day Jasper, Livingston and Huntsville (La
Vere, 2003 :113). Several Texas tribes living along the Trinity River interacted with the
Atakapans, including the Orocoquisas, Deadoes, and Bidais. The main difference between these
tribes appeared to be dialect. Culturally, these groups appeared to be very similar to the
Europeans at contact.
HISTORIC CHRONOLOGY
The area now known as Grimes County went through a succession of political boundary
changes since the Spanish province. A document entitled âTexas: Consolidated Chronology of
State and County Boundariesâ in the Texas Atlas of Historical County Boundaries (Long and
Sinko, 2008) was used to define the historic periods of the project area.
Exploration
The early exploration of Texas was due to the rivalry of France and Spain in their quest
for new lands to exploit. Spain was at the height of her power after defeating the Moors but
needed gold to fill the monarchâs coffers (Bolton 1921:2). Spain claimed the land that is now
Texas in 1519, when the explorer Alonso Alvarez de PiÃ±eda went looking for a waterway
11

through the mainland to the Pacific Ocean. He sailed along the Gulf Coast from Florida to Vera
Cruz (Bourne 1907:136). In June of 1527, PÃ¡nfilo de NarvÃ¡ez sailed from Spain with six
hundred colonists. One of his officers was Ãlvar NÃºÃ±ez Cabeza de Vaca. On November 6, 1528,
while sailing along the coast, a storm separated the flotilla and Cabeza de Vacaâs ship and two
others were wrecked on Galveston Island (Bolton 1921:25). The French explorer Robert
Cavelier de La Salle sailed along the coast of Texas in 1685 during his attempt to find the mouth
of the Mississippi River and to explore the western portion of New France. The expedition
landed on the southwestern shore of Matagorda Bay. The hostile attitude of the Native
Americans left many of the colonists discouraged so they returned to France on one of the ships.
One hundred and eighty persons were left on the bay and they established a rude fort named St.
Louis which was later moved further inland on the banks of Garcitas Creek. In 1687 La Salle
searched for the Mississippi River and wandered into what is now Grimes County and was killed
by one of his own men perhaps near Navasota (Anderson and Wooster 1978:66). One of La
Salleâs officers, Henri Joutel, kept a journal that is a major early source of information about the
Indians in Southeast Texas. His writings were first published in Joutelâs Journal of La Salleâs
Last Voyage in 1714 and reprinted by Texas State Historical Association under the title The
LaSalle Expedition to Texas: The Journal of Henri Joutel, 1684-1687 (Foster 1998).
The earliest inhabitants of the later Grimes County area that were recorded in history
were the Bidai Indians. They first appeared in the records of the Spanish explorers after 1691 and
they also traded with the French in the late 18th century. Disease reduced their population to less
than 100 in the early 19th century and records of their existence eventually disappeared by
the mid-19th century. The Tonkawa Indians were also in the area at the time the westerners
settled in the County (Skinner and Plumb, 2002:9).
Spanish Texas
The main Spanish influence near present day Grimes County was the establishment of the
Spanish missions as a result of LaSalleâs explorations and settlement. The Spanish decided to
establish the missions to reaffirm their claims to the East Texas area for Spain and to counter
claims to the area by the French in Louisiana (Richardson 1958:17). In 1689 Alonso de
Leon, leading an expedition to establish Spanish missions in East Texas passed very near the
project area. His route became the La Bahia Road, one of the Caminos Reales. The Caminos
Reales were the King's Highways created by order of the King of Spain (Yoakum 1855:380).
In 1689-1693 the Governor of the Spanish province of Coahuila (part of the Viceroyalty of New
Spain) extended his authority to include Texas. His authority ended with the withdrawal of the
Spanish missions from east Texas in 1693 (Beers, 1979: 97). In 1716, the governor of Coahuila
Province again extended authority over Texas (Beers, 1979: 97-98). The French threat to east
Texas was eliminated after Louisiana became a Spanish possession in 1763. France, which was
about to lose a war with Britain, gave Louisiana to the Spanish rather than lose it to the British.
Spanish interest in maintaining expensive missions and presidios plummeted. Following an
inspection trip of the Spanish frontier carried out by the Marquis de Rubi in the late 1760s, the
Spanish decided to cut expenses by pulling back to San Antonio and Goliad.

12

Mexican Texas
The Republic of Mexico gained its independence from Spain in 1821 through the Treaty
of Cordova (Beers, 1979: 100). As a result of the treaty, the land that presently represents Texas
became part of Mexico. Under the 1824 Constitution for the Republic of Mexico, the state of
Coahuila and the former Spanish province of Texas were united and organized as the state of
Coahuila and Texas. In 1826 the original county of Nacogdoches was established as a
municipality by Mexico (Singletary, 1949: 88-90). In 1832, San Felipe De Austin (now Austin,
County) was established as a municipality by Mexico. Precise boundaries were not described but
the municipality had jurisdiction between Lavaca and San Jacinto Rivers, and south of the San
Antonio Road to the Gulf of Mexico (Barker 1918: 299-307). In 1835, Washington County was
created from Austin and Liberty counties and established as a municipality by Mexico. Precise
boundaries were not described but the general area of municipality was mapped (Partlow
1974:326).
Historically, the present day Grimes County was first settled by colonists in 1821 after
Stephen F. Austin obtained permission from the Spanish government to settle 300 families in
Texas. This settlement included most of the area that is now known as Grimes County
(Greenwade 1996:2). In 1821 Andrew Millican took up residence along Holland Creek west of
what is now Anderson. By the end of 1824 seven of Austin's original colonists had claimed land
within what is now Grimes County. Early residents included the families of Francis Holland,
Isaac Jackson, James Whiteside, Jesse Grimes, Caleb Wallace, Jared E. Groce, and Anthony
Kennard. Before the outbreak of the Texas Revolution in 1836, a total of sixty-four heads of
household obtained land grants within the future county from the Mexican government. As
elsewhere within the Austin colony, these first settlers were attracted to the rich bottomlands
along the rivers and major creeks and also preferred prairie acreage over timberland (Jackson
2010). The area was abandoned during the "Runaway Scrape" of 1836, due to the advancing
Mexican Army but was reoccupied after the Battle of San Jacinto.
State Of Texas
In 1836 Texas declared its independence from Mexico. In 1840, Montgomery County
was created by the Republic of Texas from Liberty, Washington, and a small part of Austin
counties (Texas Republic Laws 1837, 2nd congress, 1st session: 33). In 1853, Grimes County was
created from a portion of Montgomery County, (Texas Laws 1846, 1st leg./p. 50). It was named
for Jesse Grimes, one of the signers of the Texas Declaration of Independence.
The period from the 1840's to the Civil War was one of steady growth in population, as
farmers and planters from Deep South states moved west in search of fertile cotton-producing
lands. With the settlement of the area by slave owners, the black population increased
substantially. Since most of the cotton was raised in the southern part of the county, the black
population was likely concentrated there (Brown et a1. 1987:27).
The economic effects of the Civil War were profound for the majority of Texans and
certainly for the landowners and planters of Grimes County, who had traditionally relied on the
cotton aristocracy for their livelihood. In the decade following the war, the price of cotton, the

only cash crop at the time, plummeted throughout the region. By the 1870's, land had generally
fallen to a tenth of its 1860 value, and small farmers and planters alike had difficulty holding on
to their land. Deed records in many East Texas counties show an almost complete turnover in
ownership of land during the 1870's (Fehrenbach 1968:420). Not until 1910 would Grimes
County farms be as valuable as they had been in 1860. By 1880, tenants operated 64 percent of
the farms in the county, a figure that would remain constant until 1930, when it peaked at almost
69 percent. With the Great Depression and ensuing shift away from staple crop production,
tenantry began a precipitous decline; in 1950, 44 percent of the county's farmers were tenants; in
1969, only 10 percent (Jackson 2010).
PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
The Texas Historical Commissionâs Atlas (Atlas), (http://nueces.thc.state.tx.us/) reveals
that to date there have been a total of 87 area archaeological projects, 21 linear archaeological
projects (Figure 7), and 475 recorded archaeological sites in Grimes County. The majority of
archaeological work has been in the northeastern portion of the county mainly due to
archaeological surveys for large-scale projects such as the proposed Millican Reservoir Project
and the Texas Municipal Power Agencyâs Lignite Mine.
The Atlas (http://nueces.thc.state.tx.us/) indicates that there were small portions of three
archaeological projects and no recorded sites within the project area.
The first project within the boundary of the project area was entitled âCultural Resources
Survey 1986-1991 Mine Permit Area Texas Municipal Power Agency Grimes County, Texasâ
and was performed by Espey, Houston & Associates (EH&A) in 1985 (Glander, W.C., et al
1986). The abstract states that âA cultural resources survey of lands to be included in the
proposed 1986-1991 surface mine for TMPA was conducted by EH&A during the summer of
1985. The survey and field check recorded and/or examined 51 archaeological sites. Avoidance
was recommended for two historic cemeteries and one previously tested prehistoric cemetery.
Archival and ethno-historical research was recommended for three sites. Limited archaeological
testing was recommended for ten sites. Survey was also recommended for those areas for which
access was denied.
The other two archaeological projects within the boundaries of the project area were
conducted by AR Consultants of Dallas Texas (Skinner and Plumb 2002) and (Craver and
Skinner 2007). The first was the survey in 2002 of the BVSWMA SH 30 Landfill site under
Texas Antiquities Permit Number 2822. The pedestrian survey and shovel testing found two
prehistoric and two historic archaeological sites. Site 1 was a pebble quarry site that was utilized
prehistorically and Site 4 was considered to be a temporary habitation camp where tools were
made and refurbished. The two historic sites were residences that were probably built and lived
in by resident cotton farmers in the period from 1860-1880. No buried site deposits were found
in the floodplain of Alum Creek where an access road and pipeline relocation will be conducted.
AR Consultants recommended that the Sites 2 and 4 receive further testing in order to determine
their eligibility for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Properties and as State
Archeological Landmarks. Sites 1 and 3 did not have sufficient integrity to warrant preservation
14

or further investigation (Skinner and Plumb 2002). The second AR Consultants project was the
2007 testing of sites 41GM410 and 41GM412 under Antiquities Permit 4166. The first site
(41GM410) is the location of a one-room frame house that was built in the 1870s and abandoned
sometime before 1900. The house had a rock chimney and opposite it was a serpentine-shaped
walkway made of sandstone slabs. Besides an extensive nail rain and glass scatter in the midden
around the house foundation, other time-sensitive artifacts included a Granite Ware cooking pot,
a clay marble, and a Union Eagle button. Archival research indicates that the house may have
belonged to Warren Goodin who owned the property between 1848 and 1877. Goodin sold the
property to Pru Stickney who owned it until 1901. Site 41GM410 was recommended for
inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places and as a State Archeological Landmark.
Testing revealed that site 41GM412 was occupied during the Middle to Transitional Archaic and
that the ground surface was aggrading during this period. No datable organic materials were
found and no evidence of cultural stratigraphy or features of meaningful geologic stratigraphy
were uncovered in the 60-70 cm of the sandy mantle at the site. Due to the absence of datable
stratigraphy and the lack of features and preserved organic materials, no further investigation
was recommended and the site was not recommended for inclusion in the National Register of
Historic Places (Craver and Skinner 2007). None of these sites are within the present project
area..
The Atlas (http://nueces.thc.state.tx.us/) shows that there have been a total of four area
archaeological projects, no linear archaeological projects, and eleven recorded archaeological
sites outside the project area but within one mile (1.6 kilometers) of the project area.
The first archaeological project was conducted by Sorrow and Cox (1973) and was an
assessment of the cultural resources of the Navasota River Basin prior to the construction of the
proposed Millican Lake. At the time of their reconnaissance, only 12 sites were known within the
lower Navasota River Basin (Sorrow and Cox 1973:3). Due to heavy rains, much of the area was
not investigated. Also, dense vegetation obscured much of the ground surface making site
identification difficult since shovel testing was not conducted. Sorrow found four sites within one
mile of the current project area. These were 41GM 16, 17, 18, and 21. Sites 41GM 16-18 artifacts
included flakes only and 41GM21 found a crude scrapper and no flakes.
The Texas A&M University Anthropology Research Laboratory conducted two
archaeological projects in the TMPA Mine Area. The first was entitled âAn Archaeological
Assessment of the Gibbons Creek Steam Electric Stationâ (Bond 1977). The assessment
documented 44 sites which may be affected by the then proposed project. The assessment proposed
that more surface and subsurface investigations be performed especially in areas in which access
was denied and that 14 prehistoric sites be tested. Two historic sites were to be further investigated
as to their age and significance and possibly tested. Two historic sites 41GM44 (Piedmont Springs)
and 41GM78 (Kellum Springs) were significant entities in Grimes County and should be preserved.
None of these sites were within 1 mile of the project area.
The second project was the Gibbons Creek Lignite Project: Survey and Appraisal of
Cultural Resources in The First Five Year Mining Area (Fletcher 1979). No archaeological sites
were found during the survey but one prehistoric site was found during backhoe testing for deeply
buried sites.

15

Espey Huston and Associates (EH&A) conducted a cultural resources survey of lands in the
1986-1991 surface mine area (Glander 1985). Previously recorded archaeological resource sites
within the 1981-1986 permit area were also field checked. These investigations recorded and/or
examined 51 archaeological sites. Avoidance was recommended for two historic cemeteries and one
pre-historic cemetery. Archival and ethno historical research was recommended for three sites and
limited archaeological testing for ten sites. Archaeological survey was recommended for those areas
where access was denied. This survey found seven sites within one mile of the current project area.
Six if these sites were prehistoric lithic scatters and one was a historic house structure. All of the
sites were found by Ed Baxter, Paul Rushmore and Greg Sundborg.

METHODS
The Texas Historical Commission (THC) issued an Antiquities Permit number 7987
for the proposed BVSWMA, Inc.âs expansion project. The Antiquities Permitâs research design
identified the pre-field and field methods to be employed on the survey of the project area.

16

Pre-field research on previously recorded sites and surveys on or near the project area
was conducted using the online resources of the THCâs Atlas, (http://nueces.thc.state.tx.us/).
Relevant reports that document work in the area were downloaded from the Atlas and were
utilized in the research and report production. Searches on Google Books
(https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=google+books+advanced+search) were conducted for
early historical accounts of the area. The Texas Atlas of Historical County Boundaries that
depicts and describes the chronology of the various governmental boundaries that encompass the
project area was also accessed (http://publications.newberry.org/ahcbp/downloadfiles.html). This
data along with files found of the University of Texas Libraries online
http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/texas.html) and the Texas State Historical Associationsâ
Handbook of Texas Online (http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online), and published
histories, journals, documents were used in the Historic Chronology section. Background
research also a review of historical aerial photographs found at the USGS Earth Resources
Observation and Science (EROS) Center as well as historic USGS and United States Army
Corps of Engineers (USACE) quadrangles found at the Texas Natural Resources Information
System (TNRIS) Texas Historic Overlay. Single frame aerials included January, 1953; March
1958; September 1973; March 1977; and March 1982. Historic quadrangles included USACE
Carlos, Texas 1919, 1:62,000; USGS Carlos, Texas 1956, 1:62500 and USGS Ferguson
Crossing, Texas 1959, 1:24,000.
The Project Archaeologist visited the project area and evaluated the two stream areas
thorough surface inspection and also performed shovel testing or probing as needed. Shovel tests
were dug to the underlying clay subsoil and all excavated earth from the shovel testing was passed
through Â¼ inch hardware cloth. This task was documented through a digital shovel test log, digital
field notes, digital photography and digital photographic logs. In addition, a handheld GPS was used
to locate shovel tests.
The remainder of the project area was investigated by a pedestrian survey that involved a
visual inspection of the surface and shovel tests where warranted. A map was drafted that depicted
the location of all areas surveyed.
Projects digital notes, logs, and photographs were prepared for curation using TARL
standards and then curated at TARL and the survey report was prepared using the guidelines
established by the Council of Texas Archaeologists and submitted to the THC for review.
RESULTS
Pre-field research on previously recorded sites and surveys on or near the project area
indicated that there were two previous archaeological surveys in a portion of the project area.
No previously recorded archaeological sites or cemeteries, National Register Properties or State
Archaeological Landmarks were found within the project area. A review of historic USGS and
USACE quadrangles and historic aerials did not indicate the presence of historic cultural
resources in the project area.

17

The pedestrian survey and 100 shovel tests found no new cultural resource sites. There
was a modern corral in the northeast section of the project area (Figure 8a.), a 1949 Chevrolet
3100 Panel Truck on the east side of the project area (Figure 8b.), and a modern oil well and pad
in the center of the project area. Five deer stands were found in various areas (Figure 8c.) and
one deer cabin (Figure 8d.) near a modern pond on the headwater of Dinner Creek. A review of
the historic aerial photographs indicated the deer cabin had been moved to the area between 2008
and 2010.
Details of the locations and records of the shovel tests can be found in Appendix I of this
report.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The background research found no previously recorded cultural resource sites, National
Register Properties or State Archaeological Landmarks within the confines of the project area of
the proposed east expansion. No new cultural resource sites were found during the course of the
archaeological survey. Therefore it is recommended that the proposed Brazos Valley Solid
Waste Management Agency, Inc.âs East Expansion Project will have no impact on significate
cultural resources and be allowed to proceed.
