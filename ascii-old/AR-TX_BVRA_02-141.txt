ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of the proposed Lexington Court Ltd. project (8.39 acres)
in Gregg County, Texas was performed by Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) in
July of 2004. The lead agency for this project is the United States Department of Housing
and Urban Development (HUD). The Principal Investigator was William E. Moore, and the
Project Archaeologist was Edward P. Baxter. The project area was investigated by a
100% Pedestrian Survey method supported by shovel testing. Two prehistoric sites
(41GG2 and 41GG28) are plotted on the maps at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL) as being very close to the project area. Twenty-one shovel tests dug
between 20 cm and 80 cm did not produce any cultural materials within the 8.39 acre tract.
The TARL plotting for site 41GG2 places this site in an area totally destroyed by the
construction of two motels and a restaurant. The current status of 41GG28 could not be
determined by this survey. Overall, disturbance in the project area varies from cultivation in
the 1930s to virtual removal of topsoil in one area for a plant nursery. No artifacts worthy of
curation were collected.

INTRODUCTION
Brazos Valley Construction, Inc. of Bryan, Texas plans to construct affordable
housing in the city limits of Kilgore, Texas in east-central Gregg County (Figure 1). When
finished, the entire 8.39 acre tract will be affected. The Federal agency involved in this
project is the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the state
agency providing funding is the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs
(TDHCA). The results of this archaeological study are subject to review under Section 106
of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966.
Gregg County contains significant archaeological sites, both prehistoric and historic.
Two previously recorded prehistoric sites (41GG2 and 41GG28) are depicted on the
topographic maps at TARL as being very close to the current project area. Therefore, an
archaeological survey was requested by the Texas Historical Commission, Archeology
Division. In a letter from F. Lawerence Oaks, State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO),
signed by William A. Martin to James R. Hodges, Project Manager at Hodges Engineering,
Inc. dated June 23, 2004; an archaeological survey of the area is necessary. This letter
states that a "professional archeologist should examine the tract and determine the current
status" of this site (41GG2). In order to satisfy this requirement, Brazos Valley
Construction, Inc. retained BVRA to conduct an archaeological survey designed meet the
minimum archeological survey standards as posted on line at www.thc.state.us.
The project area consists of 8.39 acres and is depicted on the topographic
quadrangle Kilgore NE (photorevised 1971) (3294-234) (Figure 2). This work was
performed under application number TDHCA 04194 and BVRA project number 04-24.
William E. Moore was the Principal Investigator, and Edward P. Baxter performed the
duties of Project Archaeologist. The field survey was accomplished on July 8, 2004.

PROJECT AREA SOILS
According to the General Soil Map in the soil survey for Gregg County (Roberts
1983), the project area is located within the Kullit-Sacul series that consists of gently
sloping to strongly sloping, moderately well drained, loamy soils on uplands. The specific
soil map unit for the project area is Tenaha loamy fine sand, 8 to 20 percent slopes (TeE).
Roberts (1983:30) describes this soil as a strongly sloping to moderately steep soil on
uplands. Mapped areas are on side slopes above drainage ways and are long and narrow.
Typically, the surface layer is dark, grayish-brown loamy fine sand about four inches thick.
The subsurface layer, which extends to a depth of 22 inches, is brown loamy fine sand.
The upper part of the subsoil, to a depth of 29 inches, consists of yellowish-red loamy fine
sand. The lower part of the subsoil, to a depth of 52 inches, is red sandy clay loam over
red loam with yellowish-brown mottles. The underlying layer, to a depth of 64 inches, is
stratified sandstone over shaly clay. This soil is medium acid in the upper part and very
strongly acid in the lower part. It is well drained, runoff is slow, and permeability is
moderate. Available water capacity is medium. The root zone is deep and easily
penetrated by plant roots. Erosion is considered to be a moderate hazard.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
According to a recently published planning document for the Eastern Planning
Region of Texas (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 1.1.2), Gregg County is situated
within the Northeast Texas archeological study region. In 1985, according to the planning
document (Biesaart et al. 1985:140), no prehistoric sites had been recorded in the county.
This is in contrast to the TARL files as the first site was recorded in 1931, and several sites
were recorded between 1939 and 1959. Currently, Gregg County has 103 recorded sites.
The majority of sites in the county (n=56) were recorded by avocational archaeologists.
While a high school student in Kilgore, Jack T. Hughes located and recorded 20 sites
(41GG4 - 41GG20 and 41GG35 - 41GG37). An additional 36 sites were added to the data
base for Gregg County by archaeological stewards Bo Nelson, Mark Walters, and Bryan
Boyd. The remaining 47 sites were found as a result of various cultural resource surveys
for state and federally funded projects.
G. E. Arnold, working with The University of Texas at Austin, visited much of East
Texas and documented sites in many counties between 1939 and 1940. Arnold did not
conduct shovel testing, took few notes, and assigned field numbers to each site. His
plottings in some cases are suspect. The location of site 41GG2, for example, is described
in the TARL site records as uncertain and possibly the same as site 41GG8 to the north.
In 1940, he was in Gregg County where he recorded two sites (41GG2 and 41GG3). Of
special interest to this study is 41GG2 that he recorded on the same landform as the
project area. Very little information is available for this site except he collected 26 ceramic
fragments and 1 projectile point. In addition he observed fragments of bone and mussel
shell. Appendix II depicts the location of 41GG2 and 41GG8.
In 1981, an archaeological survey of the proposed route for a sewer line and the site
of a future lift stations was conducted by the Texas Department of Water Resources (now
the Texas Water Development Board) (Fox and Jurgens 1981). According to Christopher
J. Jurgens, who participated in this survey, shovel testing was not conducted. The strategy
was to examine eroded and otherwise disturbed areas on landforms that seemed likely to
contain prehistoric sites. When a site was found, avoidance was generally practiced.
During this 1981 survey, site 41GG28 was identified and recorded as a lithic scatter "on
slopes of terrace forming lower slope of valley wall of Rabbit Creek." Although heavily
disturbed, the recorders recommended avoidance stating it could contain basic
subsistence/settlement pattern data. The only documentation of this site is a letter report
authored by Daniel E. Fox and Christopher J. Jurgens (1981). This site is northwest of the
project area, and its location is depicted in Appendix II.

According to the excellent research conducted by Nancy Kenmotsu and Timothy K.
Perttula (1993), notable prehistoric sites are present in Gregg County. They include
important hunter-gatherer sites, significant Caddo Period sites, and one Critical Resource
Zone containing sites that are relevant to the research on the development of agriculture
prior to A.D. 1600. Sites with excellent faunal and floral preservation have not been
identified, and no sites with mounds are known. Also, Gregg County ranks low in terms of
density of known human burials and number of archaeological sites with burials. The
period of European contact is represented by several sites containing historic burials, trade
beads, iron knives and arrow points, steel adzes, and a copper wire coil. One of these
sites (41GG8) is plotted on the TARL maps as 2000 meters northeast of the current project
area.
The interested reader is advised to consult the planning document by Kenmotsu
and Perttula for an in-depth discussion of the archaeology of Northeast Texas. Other
relevant sources of information are an archaeological bibliography for the Northeastern
Region of Texas (Martin 1990) and the Abstracts in Texas Contract Archeology published
by the Texas Historical Commission.

METHODS OF INVESTIGATION
Background Research
The field survey was supplemented by an examination of site records and other
documents at TARL in Austin, Texas for previously recorded sites in the project area and
vicinity that were plotted on field maps. In addition, the soil survey for Gregg County was
examined. The project area was examined in the field by means of a 100% Pedestrian
Survey by the Project Archaeologist, Edward P. Baxter. At the time of this investigation,
most of the 8.39 acre tract was located within a forest of pines and hardwoods with a few
clearings. Since surface visibility was poor, shovel testing was necessary in order to locate
buried cultural materials. Shovel tests were excavated throughout the tract with an
emphasis on the least disturbed areas. All excavated earth was screened through quarterinch hardware cloth. Data obtained from shovel tests were recorded on a shovel test log,
and relevant information for each test is presented in Appendix I. In all, 21 shovel tests
were excavated (Figure 3). The tests varied from 20 cm below the existing ground surface
in shallow sandy soils to 80 cm in areas where deeper sand was present. All tests were
dug through at least 10 cm of the underlying clay subsoil. GPS plottings were taken at key
boundary locations in order to better depict the project area on the topographic map.
Photographs of the general area were taken with a digital camera, and one image
depicting some of the more severe disturbance is on the cover of this report.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Examination of the site files at TARL in Austin, Texas revealed that three sites
(41GG2, 41GG8, and 41GG28) have been recorded nearby. Two of these (41GG2 and
41GG28) are depicted on the TARL maps as being very close to the project area.
Appendix II depicts the location of these sites. This search also revealed a previous sewer
line survey by the Texas Department of Water Resources (TDWR) in 1981 which recorded
prehistoric site 41GG28 (Appendix II).
The majority of the 8.39 acre project area was found to be in a pine forest with
mixed hardwoods on a sandy hill overlooking Rabbit Creek to the west. This area is shown
as being in cultivation in a 1939 aerial photograph and cleared on the 1971 topographic
map. Surface inspection revealed areas of low-mounded soil rows indicating past clearing
by mechanical means. There were several areas where the land had been used as a site
for the dumping of construction waste. In the extreme eastern of the project area
construction of Buddy's Nursery involved land leveling, the most extreme form of
disturbance in the tract (Figure 3). Two to three feet of soil was removed as a result of this
activity. At the time of this study a nursery building, greenhouse area, and paved parking
lot was present in the area fronting Highway 259.
Although previously recorded sites 41GG2 and 41GG28 are depicted on the
topographic map as very close to the current project area, no evidence of these sites within
the project area was found through a surface inspection of disturbed areas or shovel
testing. Site 41GG2 lies to the east and northeast of the project area. This site, if plotted
correctly on the TARL maps, has been almost completely destroyed by construction
activities that include land leveling for two motels and a restaurant which now occupy this
area. Because of the disturbance for these establishments less than one/third of the area
depicted as the location of 41GG2 remains. Disturbance at this site noted by G. E. Arnold
in 1940 included construction of the Kilgore-Longview Highway and removal of sand for
grading. This study has not identified the date of highway construction for U.S. 259, but
the change from the older road to a modern highway has further altered the eastern end of
site 41GG2.
Site 41GG28 is depicted on the topographic map as northwest and down slope of
the project area. In that part of the project area near the plotted location of this site the soil
was very shallow with clay and sandstone fragments near the surface. Shovel tests 7-9,
those nearest this site were terminated at 20 cm because of shallow soils.
The "Minimum Survey Standards" for project areas of 200 acres or less were
followed during this project.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No archaeological sites were found within the project area. It is, therefore,
recommended that the project proceed without further consultation with the Texas
Historical Commission relative to cultural resources. Should evidence of an archaeological
site be encountered during construction, all work must be temporarily suspended in the
area of the find until assessed by a professional archeologist in consultation with the Texas
Historical Commission.
