ABSTRACT

HRA Gray & Pape, LLC, of Houston, Texas, performed an intensive pedestrian
survey of 0.2 hectares (0.5 acres) of property proposed for the construction of a temporary
fill bridge that will cross a segment of Old Oyster Creek approximately 300 meters (984 feet)
south of Watts Plantation Road in Fort Bend County, Texas (Figure 1). The survey area was
staked by the client prior to fieldwork and measures approximately 58 meters (190 feet) by
35 meters (115 feet) or 0.2 hectare (0.5 acre).
Prior to fieldwork mobilization, a background literature and site file search was
conducted to identify the presence of recorded sites near the project area. The search
indicated that several sites are located within a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile) radius of the project
area. Although several sites have been previously identified near the current project area,
none were located within the current project Area of Potential Effect (APE). During this
research, two intensive pedestrian surveys of the immediate area were examined. One
survey, done by Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc., of Austin, Texas, in 1987 covered an
extensive, block survey covering the much of the surrounding property planned for
development. At the time of survey it was unclear as to whether the current APE was
included in that survey. An intensive pedestrian survey by HRA Gray & Pape, LLC in 2004
was performed for a proposed temporary bridge crossing Old Oyster Creek located north of
the current APE. A historic farmstead (Site 41FB292) was recorded during that survey. That
site was not recommended for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
Intensive Pedestrian survey was conducted on July 13, 2006, and consisted of a
walkover (surface) survey, photo-documentation, and shovel testing within the project area.
Field survey required approximately 12 person hours to complete. Subsurface investigation
included the excavation of 6 shovel tests to depths ranging between 50 and 100 centimeters
(19.69 and 39.37 inches).
No previously unrecorded archaeological sites were discovered during the
investigation. Due to the lack of cultural resources, evidence of erosion along the creek
banks, and inundation throughout much of the survey area, HRA Gray & Pape recommends
that no further archaeological work be required and that the project be cleared to proceed as
planned.

INTRODUCTION

HRA Gray & Pape, LLC (HRA Gray & Pape), at the request of Berg Oliver and
Associates, Inc. (Berg Oliver), conducted an Intensive Pedestrian cultural resources
management survey on 0.2 hectares (0.5 acres) of property associated with a temporary fill
bridge crossing over a portion of Old Oyster Creek in Fort Bend County, Texas. As
proposed, the project will include the subject property extends across Old Oyster Creek from
a location south of Watts Plantation Road and includes upland areas to the east and west of
Old Oyster Creek. The survey area will measure approximately 58 meters (190 feet) in
length and 35 meters (115 feet) in width. Conversations with the client indicate that the
temporary bridge footprint will match those reported in Baird et al. (2004).
The goals of the cultural resources survey were to determine if the initiation of this
project would affect any previously identified historic properties as defined by Section 106 of
the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended (36 CFR 800)
(Advisory Council for Historic Preservation [ACHP] 1999), and to established whether or
not previously unidentified cultural resources were located within the project’s Area of
Potential Effect (APE). The APE associated with the proposed crossing measures
approximately 58 meters (190 feet) in length and 35 meters (115 feet) in width or 0.2 hectare
(0.5 acre), and includes property adjacent to the east and west banks of Old Oyster Creek
(Figure 1).
HRA Gray & Pape survey personnel included Principal Investigator Tony Scott and
Archaeological Field Technician Jeremy Mangum. Site file research was conducted by
Melinda Mendoza-Scott and included consultation of on-line research archives maintained by
the Texas Historical Commission (THC). The field investigation required 12 person hours to
complete, and included pedestrian and subsurface investigation by shovel testing. Tony Scott
prepared this short report and the associated graphics.

PROJECT AREA
The project area is depicted on the Missouri City quadrangle map, and is located
adjacent to a cutoff channel of Oyster Creek. Oyster Creek is a relatively young watercourse,
which occupied an abandoned channel of the Brazos River approximately 500 to 1500 years
ago. Although flow is intermittent in the upper reaches of the channel, it increases noticeably
as it extends towards its terminus in the modern Brazos River meanderbelt. The increase is
of sufficient volume that by the time it reaches this point, the water from ground runoff is
adequate to maintain a permanent flow (Abbott 2001). The topography and soils that
characterize the area are a result of alluvial deposition and consist of silty loam and hard

approximately 61 centimeters (24 inches) thick of light reddish brown to reddish brown
loam. Below this is a light reddish brown silt loam with thin lenses of silty clay loam and
fine sandy loam to a depth of 112 centimeters (44 inches). Some areas have a lens of clay at
depths of 76 centimeters to 102 centimeters (30 to 40 inches) (Mowery et al. 1960).

CULTURE HISTORY
Most sites near the coast between the Brazos River and Sabine Lake consist of
middens of clams found in estuaries or exposed in cutbanks along streams (Aten 1983;
Patterson 1985). These middens usually contain faunal material as well as cultural remains
such as lithic tools and pottery. Inland sites are less likely to consist of middens and are
more similar to generalized and thin open-air campsites near stream channels on Holocene
terraces or the remnants of Pleistocene alluvial broad upland terraces (Black 1989). Sites of
this type consist of little to no stratification due to a short occupation time, erosion, and land
clearing. Thus, subsurface features are rare (United States Army Corps of Engineers, Fort
Worth District [USACE-FW] 1999).
Along the Upper Texas Coast, the Paleoindian period begins around 12,000–11,500
B.P. and ends near 9,000-8,000 B.P. (Aten 1983; Story 1990; Ricklis 2004). This period is
poorly represented in the archaeological evidence for the region (Aten 1983) and no sites for
this period have been verified (Ricklis 2004). Sites from this stage would be either buried by
alluvium or found in upland sites. Subsistence during the Paleoindian stage included both
hunting and gathering although there was probably an emphasis on hunting. The population
during this stage was highly mobile in response to the movement of food sources, which is
reflected in the use of high quality of lithic materials for artifacts although these materials are
lacking in Southeast Texas (Ricklis 2004).
Beginning at 7,500 B.P. and spanning 2,500 years (Aten 1983), the Early Archaic
period in this region has not been well documented. The sites may have been destroyed or
deeply buried (Aten 1983; Story 1990). In situ Early Archaic remains have been found at
Addicks Reservoir as well as other localities in the area (Story 1990). The Middle Archaic
period (5,000 to 3,000 B.P.) reveals the earliest surviving shell middens (Aten 1983). These
middens contain remains of shellfish, such as oysters and estuarine clams, faunal material
from terrestrial and aquatic vertebrates, and the earliest known human burials in the region
(Aten 1983). The Late Archaic lasted from 3,000 to 2,000 B.P. and shows evidence for
population increase (Aten 1983). By 2500 B.P., the climate in this area was essentially like
the modern climate. Ground stone artifacts made from materials from southwestern
Arkansas and found in context with human burials in cemeteries such as the Ernest Witte Site
indicate the possibility of trade (Hall 1981) but the shift to the use of more poor-quality local
materials suggests less mobility (Ricklis 2004). During the late Archaic, more utilitarian
biface tools are prevalent as well as are bone tools. Late Archaic assemblages are very
similar to the early part of the Late Prehistoric stage (Aten 1983).

3

The transition from the Late Archaic stage to the Late Prehistoric is indicated by the
introduction of ceramics into the assemblage (Aten 1983). Cultural shifts during the Late
Prehistoric include the possible adoption of a more sedentary lifestyle and major
technological changes, such as sandy paste ceramics and, late in the stage, the bow and arrow
(Story 1990). Aten (1983) describes this period as having an increase in population due to
the larger number of sites in more specialized locations. Contact with Europeans begins near
the end of this period, but visible changes in material culture are not seen until about A.D.
1750 along with a rapid decline in population (Story 1990).

HISTORIC PERIOD DEVELOPMENT
Fort Bend County was established on December 29, 1837, from parts of Austin,
Brazoria, and Harrisburg counties. The town of Richmond, which had been incorporated in
May of that same year, was voted the county seat by the citizens of the new county. The area
was originally settled in the 1820s as part of the land granted to Moses Austin by the Spanish
colonial government. Of the 297 original grants, 53 were situated in the future Fort Bend
County (Hardin 2002).
In 1821, the schooner Lively set sail from New Orleans and anchored at the mouth of
the Brazos River. Of this first contingent of Austin’s settlers a small party continued 90
miles up the Brazos to a bend in the river. Here, in November of 1822, a blockhouse was
built. Other settlers followed and a small community that came to be referred to as Fort Bend
grew around the blockhouse. Fort Bend was located on one of the primary fords of the
Brazos River, and as such played a role in the troop movements of the Texas Revolution.
The site was abandoned when Santa Anna’s Mexican Army crossed the river in route to the
battle of San Jacinto. When the area was resettled the new community of Richmond was
established (Leffler 2002).
Richmond became a regional trade center in the following decades, with barges and
steamboats carrying the cotton, corn, and sugar produced in the region down the Brazos to
Galveston. In 1853 the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos, and Colorado Railway proved a further boon
to business connecting Stafford Point to Harrisburg. African slaves were essential to the
plantation economy of the region and by the 1850s outnumbered the white inhabitants of the
county. Because of this economic reality Fort Bend planters strongly supported the Southern
secession and the Civil War (Hardin 2002).
Jonathan D. Waters, a planter from South Carolina, succeeded in developing what
may have been the largest cotton and sugar plantation in Fort Bend County on property
located to the south of the current project area. By 1950, Water’s operation included the
main house, a brickyard, and a sugar mill. Over 500 slaves worked the plantation and sugar
mill (Wharton 1939). The operation was willed to Thomas Pierce circa 1860, and purchased
by T. W. House in 1872. Over the next several years, the sugar operation slowly declined,
and former Houston mayor T.H. Scanlan eventually purchased the property, circa 1920
(Glander 1984).

4

The economy of Fort Bend in the nineteenth century focused on cotton, sugar, corn,
and livestock production. In the 1890s, a one million dollar sugar refinery was constructed at
Sugar Land. The county also contains substantial amounts oil, gas, and sulfur deposits,
which have played a major role in the economic development of the area (Hardin 2002).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Prehistoric archaeological sites identified in the inland regions of the Gulf Coastal
Plain tend to be composed of ephemeral, shallow deposits reflecting short-term occupation
episodes. In general, these sites consist of temporally non-diagnostic lithic scatters, thin
subsurface deposits, or suggest the presence of multiple cultural components within a mixed
stratagraphic archaeological context. Historic sites near the project area typically consist of
farm- or homesteads dating to the late nineteenth or early twentieth centuries.
Previous research conducted within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the current project area
includes an intensive pedestrian survey done by HRA Gray & Pape in April 2004, of a
proposed temporary bridge crossing located approximately 400 meters (1312.34 feet)
northeast of the current APE (Figure 1). This survey resulted in the discovery of one
previously unrecorded archaeological site. Site 41FB292 consisted of a collection of
dispersed historic artifacts including low-fired bricks, square nails, a glass fragment and
small pieces of metal. Most artifacts were recovered within the top 20-centimeters (8-inches)
below the ground surface. No temporally diagnostic artifacts were collected and no further
work was recommended on site 41FB292 (Baird et al. 2004).
In 1987, Espey, Huston & Associates conducted an extensive, block survey covering
the property immediately adjacent to the east of the current APE. It is unknown if the current
APE was included in that survey. During the course of this survey several historic sites were
identified such as 41FB143, 41FB144, and 41FB145. In general, these sites were composed
of surface scatters containing low-fired brick fragments and shallow subsurface deposits
consisting of various glass fragments, bits of tin and metal from roofs, and unidentified metal
machine fragments, none were recommended for inclusion in the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) (Sundborg et al. 1987).
The Center for Ecological Archaeology reinvestigated Site 41FB253 in November
2002. This site was investigated by excavating a series of 1-meter (3-foot) by 1-meter (3foot) units and 42 auger probes around these units. Recovered artifacts included Goose
Creek ware, several diagnostic projectile points, and incised bone fragments. The site itself
was classified as a temporary campsite dating to the Late Prehistoric. This site was
recommended for inclusion in the NRHP (Kuehn 1997).
In 2004, Greenstone Geoscience performed a survey on 10.93 hectares (27 acres) for
the proposed Vicksburg/Mustang wastewater treatment plant and attached force main. The
project entailed intensive pedestrian survey and backhoe trenching. One previously recorded
site (Site 41FB155) was assessed during survey. This site consists of a late 19th century/early

5

20th century farmstead. It was recommended that the site be avoided by construction
activities (Hubbard 2004).
Other surveys by both the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) in 1996 and
1999 and the USACE-Galveston District in 1988 are located within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile)
of the current APE. No information was available for these surveys.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Background and site file research was initiated prior to fieldwork mobilization.
Background literature search included a review of archaeological site files, and a review of
previously conducted cultural resource surveys in the vicinity. This information was
obtained by reviewing records through the online Texas Sites Atlas, maintained by the THC.
As part of the literature search, HRA Gray & Pape created a series of tables to document
previously identified resources located within a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile) radius of the project area.
Cultural resources identified during this literature search included previously recorded
archaeological sites, and previously conducted cultural resources surveys. Eleven previously
recorded archaeological sites were located within a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile) radius of the project
area.

Recorded cultural resources identified within the study radius consisted largely of
historic homestead sites, with the exception of one prehistoric lithic scatter. Recovered
artifacts mainly consisted of square nails, glass, ceramics, and brick. Site 41FB156 had both
historic artifacts as well as a small assortment of flint chips. None of the sites make any
mention of eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP (Table 1).
Initial investigation within the current project area consisted of a walkover survey.
Subsurface testing consisted of the placement of a series of 30-centimeter by 30-centimeter
(11-inch by 11-inch) shovel tests within the crossing right-of-way (ROW). Vertical control

6

was maintained by excavating each shovel test in 10-centimeter (4-inch) levels. One wall of
each shovel test was profiled and the walls and floor of each shovel test were inspected for
color or texture change potentially associated with the presence of cultural features. When
possible, soils were screened through ¼-inch wire mesh; soils with high clay content were
hand sorted. Non-diagnostic artifacts were not collected, but information regarding
archaeological context was collected on standardized shovel test forms.
Transect placement and shovel test spacing were determined by pacing, and verified
with a handheld Trimble model Geo-XT.

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS
The proposed project APE consisted of a narrow strip of marshy, saturated land
overgrown with yaupon, hackberry, poison ivy, and related under story. It is located between
cleared pasture bordered by two-track paths. The client staked the APE prior to survey.
Survey consisted of walkover and the placement of 9 shovel tests across 3 transects (labeled
A, B, and C sequentially) aligned west to east with Transect A being located the furthest
north. Shovel tests on each transect were identified numerically starting with 1, and were
placed sequentially from west to east (Figure 2). Shovel Test 2 for all three transects was not
excavated due to its placement within the creek bed. A total of 6 shovel tests were
excavated. All of these were negative for cultural material.
Soils encountered within the APE resembled a typical Norwood series soil (Mowery
et al. 1960). The typical soil profile, as displayed in Shovel Test C3, included a compact
reddish brown (5YR 3/3) clay to a depth of 40 centimeters (15.75 inches), followed by a
reddish brown (5YR 4/4) fine silt loam containing many fine to medium roots and throughout
to a depth of 100 centimeters (39.37 inches) (Figure 3).

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
This report presents the findings of an Intensive Pedestrian cultural resources
management survey conducted on 0.2 hectares (0.5 acres) of property associated with a
temporary fill bridge crossing over a portion of Old Oyster Creek in Fort Bend County,
Texas. Prior to fieldwork mobilization, a background literature and site file search was
conducted to identify the presence of recorded sites near the project area. The search
indicated that several sites are located within a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile) radius of the project
area. Although several sites have been previously identified near the current project area,
none were located within the current project APE.
Previously recorded cultural resources identified within a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile)
radius of the project area consisted largely of historic homestead sites, with the exception of

one prehistoric scatter. None of these sites appear to have been recommended as eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP.
Field investigation took place on July 13, 2006, and consisted of walkover survey,
photo-documentation, and subsurface excavation within the project area. Subsurface
investigation included the excavation of 6 shovel tests to depths ranging between 50 and 100
centimeters (19.69 and 39.37 inches).
During this investigation, cultural remains or features were not located within the
project area. Due to the lack of cultural resources, evidence of erosion along the creek banks,
and inundation throughout much of the survey area, HRA Gray & Pape recommends that no
further archaeological work be required and that the project be cleared to proceed as planned.
