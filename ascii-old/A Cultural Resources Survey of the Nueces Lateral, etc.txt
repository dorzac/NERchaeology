Abstract
Flatrock Engineering and Environmental, Ltd. of San Antonio, Texas contracted with Tierras
Antiguas Archaeological Investigations (TAAI) to conduct a field survey of the 2.5-Mile Nueces
Lateral, the 7.7-Mile Nopal-Brundage Oil Interconnect, and the 200-Meter Old River Ranch D
1H Pipeline in north-central Dimmit County, to be installed by Mockingbird Midstream Gas
Services, L.L.C. (Mockingbird) in north-central Dimmit County, Texas. The project was entirely
privately funded, and the properties across which the pipeline will cross are privately owned;
therefore, no Texas Antiquities Permit was required.
A pedestrian survey along the right-of-ways and an alternative route was conducted by two
archaeologists during the period 18-20 July 2011. During the course of the survey, two prehistoric
open campsites were documented (41DM178 and 41DM179).
In the opinion of Tierras Antiguas,41DM178 does not possess the integrity that warrants
significance. However, site 41DM179 is assessed as a potentially significant, buried and intact
site on the east edge of the Nueces River, and should be avoided during pipeline construction.
Tierras Antiguas further recommended that if any additional, undiscovered cultural resources
were encountered during development, such finds should be examined and evaluated by Tierras
Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant. No artifacts were collected during this
survey.

Acknowledgments
There are mainly four individuals who are greatly appreciated, and whose efforts contributed to
the successful planning, organization, and completion of this project. They are Mr. David Black,
Ms. Judy Vader, and Mr. Ryan DeBarros, Project Managers at Flatrock Engineering and
Environmental, and Mr. Ronnie Glenewinkel, Environmental Coordinator at Mockingbird
Midstream. All were extremely amiable and helpful throughout the project, and their overall
knowledge of the project contributed significantly to our understanding of the project’s scope of
work.
In addition, I express my sincere gratitude to Tierras Antiguas staff archaeologist Belisario Silva,
who worked hard, long hours, and expressed an attitude and work ethic that ensured this survey
was conducted in a thorough and professional manner.

Modern
Environmental
Setting
Climate
and
Vegetation
Dimmit county is
located in south-central
Texas near its southern
border with Mexico (see
Figure 1). Its current
p o l itical boundary
encompasses 1,307
square miles. The

and loamy soils support
1

the growth of small predominately mesquite trees, and thorny scrub brush with assorted cacti and
grassy understory.

Figure 3. Project Areas on large topographic map.
With its semi-arid environment, the county is generally frost-free from mid-February through
early December, allowing for a 290-day growing season. The average annual rainfall is about 22
inches, with most rainfall occurring in May and September. These peaks are the result of
thunderstorms bearing moist air from the Gulf of Mexico to the east, and the Pacific Ocean much
farther to the west. Dimmit County is known as part of the Winter Garden Region for the
vegetables grown there (Leffler 1996; Stevens and Arriaga 1985).
However, rainfall amounts vary significantly from year to year, and the high evapotranspiration
effects in the area effectively offset any beneficial surplus of annual rainfall. This is another
reason irrigation systems are so necessary, and commonly found in use today throughout the area.
Summers are indeed hot and dry, with temperatures consistently hovering above 1000F, although
humidity is generally low compared to environments closer to the Gulf Coast. Overall, the
county’s climate can be classified as subtropical steppe.
Hydrology
The Nueces River and the Rio Grande are the major southeasterly trending rivers draining the
South Texas region. A subtle divide through the northeastern portion of the county causes
2

numerous intermittent creeks to flow
north into the Nueces River, and
numerous others of the same type to
drain southward into the Rio Grande.
Many drainages intermittently flow into
both rivers during infrequent seasonal
periods of abundant rainfall. Although
there are many springs in Dimmit
County, very few are active due
primarily to the dip of the substrate
shales which carry these subterranean
seeps to the south and east. As a result,
some of these active seeps/springs can
be found on the Mexican side of the
national border. Ancient springs that
may have existed in the area at one time
have likely succumbed to overgrazing
and irrigation pumping during modern
times (Brune 1981). During our
investigation of the project area in
March 2011, we observed no flowing
water or niche pools.

Flora and Fauna
The project area lies within the South
Texas Plain/Brush Country vegetation
area as defined by Gould (1975), and the
regional flora of South Texas has been
classified as being part of the
Tamaulipan biotic province extending
out from northeast Mexico (Figures 4
and 5). This is the only part of Texas
where some vegetation exhibits growth
throughout the year (Blair 1950; Map
2011a). Thorny brush is the dominant
vegetation today, but this is a relatively
recent occurrence, with a mix of woody
and grassland species providing a
savanna environment during prehistoric
times (Archer 1995; Black 1989; Hester
1980; Inglis 1964). The original
vegetation was an open grassland mixed
with brushy chaparral. Oaks, pecan, and Figure 5. Blair’s (1950) biotic provinces of Texas
ash were common along perennial (Map 2011a).

streams. Due in part to overgrazing and the exclusion of fire, the invasion of woody species has
changed the vegetation into “Texas brush country” dominated by mesquite, acacia, spiny
hackberry, brazil, whitebrush, lotebrush, and others (Diamond et al. 1987:203-221). On sandy
soils, the brush includes mesquite with mixed grasses. In contrast, clay soils support mesquite
(Proposis juliflora), various species of Acacia, and mimosa, granjeno or desert hackberry (Celtis
pallida), lignum vitae (Porliera angustifolia), cenizo (Leucophyllum texanum), white brush
(Aloysia texana), prickly pear (Opuntia lindheeimeri), tasajillo (Opuntia leptocaulis), and species
of Condalia and Castela (Blair 1950).
The South Texas Plains/Brush Country exhibits some of the greatest mammalian species diversity
in the state. Sixty-one species of mammals, 36 snakes, 19 lizards, and several species of turtles,
salamanders, and frogs are present in the region (Blair 1950). Approximately 50 species of fish
have been identified in the lower Rio Grande (Lee et al. 1980).

Paleoenvironment
The paleoenvironment of south Texas is as varied as the landscape, and the South Texas
Paleoclimatic record contains significant gaps primarily due to the scarcity of deep, finely
stratified, and well-dated deposits (Stahle and Cleaveland 1995:51). To date, the best record of
paleoenvironmental reconstruction in South Texas has been accomplished by Robinson (1982)
from analysis of phytoliths from three archaeological sites in Live Oak County. Overall, the data
there along with data from other sites in Texas suggest that the waning of the Pleistocene, or lateglacial period, marked a transition from a cooler, wetter environment to one that steadily grew
warmer and drier, and more seasonal, with intermittent moist periods through about 6,000 years
ago.
Most researchers then generally agree that the period between 6,000 and 3,000 years ago was
much warmer and drier than today. Since that time, intermittent moist and dry intervals have
occurred over the past 3,000 years.
It is unlikely that the climate has changed significantly in the past few thousand years in the area
that would significantly induce vegetation changes. The greater changes have been induced by
human intervention through the clearing of wooded areas along the river and streams for
construction purposes, pumping more water for irrigation which has lowered water tables, and
overgrazing by livestock. Although there are still many seeps, springs, and streams in the area,
they most probably flowed with greater abundance during wetter intervals than exist at the present
time, providing an abundant resource for prehistoric occupants.

Cultural Chronology
The project area lies within the South Texas Archaeological region as defined by Hester (1980,
1995, 2004; Figure 6). Refining a cultural chronology for south Texas is problematic, due to the
compressed nature of the archaeological record and the scarcity of stratified sites excavated within
the region. The largest and most informational cultural resources survey in South Texas was that
conducted prior to development of the Choke Canyon Reservoir in Atascosa, Live Oak, and
McMullen counties (e.g. Hall et al. 1986). Nevertheless, Hester (1995:433) acknowledges the
paucity of information that exists for south Texas and as such offers only a “general framework”
for prehistoric periods particular to the region (Figure 6). All dates are given as approximate years
before present (B.P.), i.e., before 1950.
Paleoindian (11,200 - 7950 B.P.)
This period is estimated at between ca.11,200–7950 B.P. in south Texas (Hester 1995). The
Paleoindian period began toward the close of the Pleistocene. Diagnostic artifacts of the early
Paleoindian interval include Clovis and Folsom projectile points. The wide distribution of Clovistype points across most of North America and even into Central America suggests a wide
dispersal and interaction of the people who made them. Other artifacts associated with the Clovis
culture include bifaces and prismatic blades, engraved stones, bone and ivory points, stone bolas,
ochre, and shaft straighteners. During the late Paleoindian interval, the first stemmed lanceolate
points, such as Angostura, Golondrina, St. Mary’s Hall, and Barber (among a few others) appear.
In general, the Paleoindian adaptation has been considered to be one of small bands of nomadic,
big-game hunters following herds of Late Pleistocene fauna, including mammoth, mastodons,
bison, camel, and horse, across North America (Black 1989). More recently, emphasis has been
placed on the wide diversity of plants and animals used for subsistence by these early Americans,
such as turtles and tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers, and raccoons, although they undoubtedly
hunted the large animals as well (Collins 1995:381). Known Clovis sites include killsites,
quarries, caches, open campsites, ritual sites, and burials (Hester 1995:433–436). A Folsom
interval follows the Clovis. Folsom artifacts are fairly common in south Texas; however, no camp
sites or killsites have been found south of a large workshop, Pavo Real (41BX52), in Bexar
County (Hester 1995:434–435). Most Paleoindian finds in south Texas have consisted of surface
lithic scatters on upland terraces and ridges (Black 1989). As the warming that marks the
transition from Pleistocene to Holocene climates began to take effect in Texas, prehistoric
inhabitants adapted with changes in lifestyle. This climatic shift is also marked by the decline and
extinction of mammoth, mastodon, horse, camel, and giant bison (Bison antiquus). Large
gregarious game animals were perhaps extinct in Texas. Human hunters were forced to
concentrate on deer, antelope, and other medium-size or smaller game. Changes in the subsistence
base required technological shifts that mark the beginning of a new cultural period known as the
Archaic.
Early Archaic (7950 - 4450 B.P.)
Hester (1995:436–438) identifies the Early Archaic, with Early Corner Notched and Early Basal
Notched dart points, as roughly dating between 7950 to 4450 B.P. The extinction of large herds
5

of megafauna and the changing
climate at the beginning of the
Holocene stimulated a behavioral
change by the Prehistoric
inhabitants of south Texas
(McKinney 1981). While the
basic hunter-gatherer adaptation
probably remained intact, an
economic shift away from big
game hunting was necessary. In
gen eral, more i ntens i ve
exploitation of local and smaller
resources such as deer, fish, and
plant bulbs is indicated by
greater densities of ground-stone
artifacts, fire-cracked rock
cooking features, and more
specialized tools. Weir (1976)
speculates that Early Archaic
groups were small and highly
mobile, an inference based on the
fact that Early Archaic sites are
thinly distributed and that diagnostic
projectile point types are seen
across a wide area, including
most of Texas and northern
Mexico. Story (1985) believes
that population densities were
low during the Early Archaic,
and that groups consisted of
related individuals in small bands
with “few constraints on their
mobility” (Story 1985:39). Their
economy was based on the
utilization of a wide range of
resources, especially such yearround resources as prickly pear
and lechugilla, as well as rodents,
rabbits, and deer.

Middle Archaic (4450 - 2350
B.P.)
Figure 6. South Texas Archaeological region cultural
Hester (1995:438–441) suggests chronology.
6

that the period between 4450 and 2350 B.P. reflects the Middle Archaic in south Texas. The
Middle Archaic appears to have been a time of increased population, based on the large number
of sites from this period (Story 1985:40; Weir 1976:125, 128). On the South Texas Plains,
exploitation of widely scattered, year-round resources such as prickly pear continued (Campbell
and Campbell 1981:13–15), as did hunting deer and rabbit. Weir (1976) believes that the widely
scattered bands prevalent in the Early Archaic now began to coalesce, at least during the acorngathering season, into larger groups who shared the intensive work of gathering and processing
the acorn harvest (Weir 1976:126). Many researchers believe burned rock middens are a result
of this endeavor (Creel 1986; Prewitt 1991; Weir 1976). The common presence of deer remains
in burned rock middens encourages the view that deer processing took place at burned rock
midden sites. Bison bone is encountered in archaeological sites in south Texas, at least
occasionally, during all but the earliest part of the Middle Archaic (Dillehay 1974). Cemeteries
make their first appearance during this period, suggesting a movement toward less mobility and
perhaps territorialism. One of the earliest occurrences dating to the south Texas Middle Archaic,
is Loma Sandia in Live Oak County, which dates between ca. 2550 and 2750 B.P. (Taylor and
Highley 1995).
Late Archaic (2350 - 1250 B.P.)
Hester believes the Late Archaic in south Texas may be defined as between 2350–1250 B.P, Some
researchers believe populations increased throughout the Late Archaic (Prewitt 1985), while
others feel populations remained the same or fell during this period (Black 1989:30). Subsistence
is assumed to have become less specialized on acorns, in favor of a broad spectrum subsistence
base (Black 1989:30). Story (1985:44–45) believes the presence of cemeteries indicates that Late
Archaic populations in central and south Texas were increasing and becoming more territorial.
Although inhabitants of the South Texas Plain near Brownsville and Rockport had begun to make
pottery by about 1750 B.P., the northern part of the plain was still “pre-ceramic” until 1,000 years
later (Story 1985:45–47). Late Archaic points tend to be much smaller than Middle Archaic
points.
Transitional Archaic (2250 - 1250 B.P.)
A late subperiod or interval of the Late Archaic is frequently referred to as the Terminal Archaic
or Transitional Archaic. Turner and Hester (1993) cite data placing the Transitional Archaic as
2250–1250 B.P. Although Hester may lump current data into a Late Archaic period, he cautions
that more evidence will likely result in what may be termed as a “Terminal Archaic” period during
the latter part of the Late Archaic in south Texas. This Terminal Archaic period is represented by
diagnostics such as Ensor, Frio, and Matamoras points which appear to overlap the Late Archaic
and Late Prehistoric periods (Hester 1995:442). Weir (1976) believes this marked a transition
period to localized area sites, a disappearance of burned rock middens and bison, and a
reappearance of highly mobile hunters and gatherers. Others (Black and McGraw 1985; Peter
1982; Skelton 1977) argue that in some locations burned rock middens did not disappear and sites
were more intensely occupied during the Transitional Archaic period.
Late Prehistoric (1250 - 420 B.P.)
The term “Late Prehistoric” is commonly used to designate the period following the Late Archaic
7

in south Texas. Generally, the Late Prehistoric period is thought of as spanning the period
between A. D. 700 - 1530 ([1250 - 420 B.P.] [Hester 1995]). A series of distinctive traits mark
the shift from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric period, including the technological shift to the
bow and arrow and the introduction of pottery to central Texas and the northern South Texas
Plain (Black 1989:32; Story 1985:45–47). Two distinct phases recognized within the Late
Prehistoric are the Austin and Toyah. During the Austin phase, there appears to be a subtle
transition from expanding stem projectile points that may have been used as dart points, as well
as early arrow points. The most prevalent point found in Austin phase sites is the Scallorn arrow
point. Settlement shifts into rockshelters such as Scorpion Cave in Medina County (Highley et
al. 1978) and Classen Rockshelter in northern Bexar County (Fox and Fox 1967) have been noted.
Cemeteries from this period often reveal evidence of conflict (Black 1989:32).
Beginning rather abruptly at about 650 B.P., a shift in technology occurred. The Perdiz arrow
point may best represent the appearance of a distinct culture in south-central Texas lasting for
about 300 years, which archaeologists have labeled the Toyah phase. Hester (1995:444)
recognizes this phase as the “best documented Late Prehistoric pattern” throughout south Texas,
with dates ranging between ca. 650/700 to 300/350 B.P. (A.D. 1250/1300 to 1600/1650).
In addition to Perdiz points, evidence of a Toyah culture is manifested as bone-tempered pottery,
bone spatulates, awls, and beads, stone endscrapers, beveled knives, and expediently utilized
flakes. Briefly, expedient lithic technology involves removing flakes from a core in a nonstandard
manner; the purpose is to knock off sharp flakes for immediate use, selecting the ones that best
suit the need at the time. This technology differs from formal, standardized core reduction and the
manufacturing of formal, usually bifacial tools. Expedient lithic technology is a continent-wide
phenomonon indicative of increased sedentism, and is observed in Toyah assemblages in Texas.
Whether the Toyah phase seen in the south-central Texas archaeological record is a result of a
group of people moving into the region, or adapted technologies from the region’s periphery is
a matter of conjecture. Steele and Assad-Hunter (1986) argue for the occurrence of a distinct
change in diet between the Late Archaic and the Late Prehistoric components in two sites in the
Choke Canyon Reservoir area in south Texas. Analysis of the number of identified specimens
(NISP) shows a marked increase in artiodactyla elements present during the later part of the Late
Prehistoric, an increase largely due to the addition of bison to the “menu” (Steele and AssadHunter 1986:468).
Whether or not agriculture was practiced during this period in south Texas has not been
documented. There simply is not enough evidence to postulate there was ever a significant
presence of maize in the area. The later arrival of the Spanish during the later
Protohistoric/Historic period brought significant cultivars to south Texas.
Protohistoric/Historic (420 B.P. - present)
The end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic period in south Texas is
characterized by written accounts of European contact with indigenous groups. The Protohistoric
period begins in 1528 when Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca traversed parts of southeast and
8

south Texas and left a diary of his five years spent traveling among the hunter-gatherers of Texas
and northern Mexico (e.g., Hallenbeck 1971). Cabeza de Vaca’s account of his stay with the
Miriami in 1533-34 indicates that groups of Native Americans would normally tether themselves
to the easily exploitable riverine environments in the fall, winter and summer, occasionally
sending a hunting party onto the grasslands to hunt deer. In the summer, many groups would live
near each other in the semiarid environs of South Texas to harvest prickly pear pads and other
succulents (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13-37).
Linguistically, early protohistoric accounts of the late 1500s indicate that a large group which
spoke Cohuilteco inhabited the area now known as south-central Texas. Coahuiltecan is a term
coined by Mexican linguists in the 1800s, and the name refers to the many small bands of Native
Americans who lived in northeastern Coahuila, Mexico and south Texas. The Coahuiltecans were
rapidly dispersed or killed during the Protohistoric period.
By the 1540s and 1550s Spanish ranchers had established large ranches in northern Mexico, with
several hundred thousand cattle, using Indian slaves as labor. Large mining ventures in northern
Mexico did the same. This encroachment from the south forced Native Americans to escape into
the south-central Texas region.
The period between de Vaca’s written account and the advent of Spanish missions in the late
1600s and early 1700s is referred to as the Protohistoric; a time when few, scant written
documents exist detailing Native American life outside the missions. The Historic period then,
is generally thought of as beginning in the 1700s.
Some 30 miles south of Eagle Pass, the Spanish established Mission San Juan Bautista in 1700
(now modern-day Guerrero). Early Spanish explorers then repeatedly traveled the Camino Real
enroute to newly established missions and settlements in today’s modern Texas throughout the
1700s and 1800s. Mexican families from across the river expanded into Texas, and these families
trace their roots to the early development of the area. In the ensuing years, lawlessness prevailed,
with saloons, gambling houses, outlaws, and slave hunters prevalent.

Dimmit County Prehistory and History
Other than early work done by A. T. Jackson in 1932, perhaps the earliest systematic
archaeological survey in Dimmit County was conducted by members of the Carrizo Springs High
School Archeological Society in 1964 and 1965. Their work resulted in the documentation of 24
archaeological sites in the county, ranging in age from the Early Archaic through the Late
Prehistoric Toyah phase (Nunley and Hester 1966).
Indian artifacts found in Dimmit County indicate that the area has been occupied for about 11,000
years. Plentiful food sources such as wild game, fruits, seeds, and roots made the land hospitable.
Early technology included tools from wood and stone, woven basketry, sewed rabbitskin robes,
and a very effective weapon was the atlatl, a throwing stick that greatly increased the deadliness
9

of their spears (Hester 1984; Leffler 1996). Perhaps as early as 1,300 years ago, they learned to
make pottery and to hunt with bows and arrows. “During the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries, the Coahuiltecan Indians native to Dimmit County were squeezed out by other Indian
who were migrating into the area and by the Spanish, who were moving up from the south. Many
of the Coahuiltecans were taken to San Juan Bautista in Coahuila. Apaches and Comanches
moved in to take their place” (Leffler 1996).
“No permanent Spanish settlement seems to have been established in the future Dimmit County.
Beginning in the late 1600s, however, Spaniards passed through the area on the Old San Antonio
Road, a camino real, to and from other Spanish settlements in Texas. After the Mexican War of
Independence the Mexican government used land grants to encourage its citizens to settle in
Texas. Perhaps as many as seven grants were made between 1832 and 1834 that included territory
now in Dimmit County. None of the recipients seems to have made use of the land, however. By
1836, when Texas became independent from Mexico, the area remained populated almost solely
by Indians” (Leffler 1996).
Between the Texas Revolution and the Mexican War (1836–46), most of Dimmit County lay in
the disputed area between the Rio Grande and the Nueces River, and it became a haven for
desperate characters until about 1865. Carrizo Springs was founded in 1865, with the new settlers
who lived in jacals or dugouts frequently being harrassed by hostile Indians and outlaws. Due in
part tobeing pursued by the Texas Rangers, and being decimated by disease, the Indians were
forced to leave Dimmit County by 1877, and in 1880 Carrizo Springs became the county seat for
the newly formed county. By 1880, cattle ranching was firmly established, and although sheep
ranching was also an important part of the economy at the time, by 1900 extended droughts and
an increase in predators combined to make sheep ranching a tough and dwindling business
(Leffler 1996).
Although the residents of Dimmit County learned to cope with the sparse annual rainfall, artesian
wells ushered in an era of large vegetable truck farms in the 1890s, and Dimmit County became
known as part of the Texas Winter Garden Region, one of the most prolific vegetable-growing
areas in the country.
As with rest of the nation, the Great Depression many of the county’s farmers were forced to cut
back their once-lucrative vegetable production during the depression, and fell back on raising
poultry, hogs, and dairy cattle (Leffler 1996). The discovery of large oil and gas fields in the
county in the 1950s certainly bolstered Dimmit County’s economy, and although large ranches
lay claim to most of the land in the county, the production of oil and gas are very much a
progressively increasing part of the county’s development (Leffler 1996).

Site Types That Could be Expected Along the Three Right-of-Ways
Prehistoric Open Campsites
Most numerous among the sites recorded in Dimmit County are prehistoric open campsites
10

ranging in age from the Paleoindian period through the Historic period (see Figure 6). Some of
these represent a single campfire where a very small group of Native Americans may have
camped for one night. Others are very large, covering very extensive areas representing large
groups of people that stayed for long periods, perhaps seasonally, with ancestral groups returning
to these same campsites over a period of several thousands of years. Cultural remains to be found
at these large campsites include among other items, an abundance of fire-cracked rocks
representing multiple hearths, a wide variety of chipped stone tools and the lithic debris that
results from making them, ground and smoothed stones used to grind nuts and seeds, faunal
remains from terrestrial and aquatic animals consumed, bone tools, pottery sherds, and mussel and
snail shells. Open campsites occur in all types of environments, whether that be in a plush riverine
environment that offered a wide variety banquet of plant and animal foodstuffs, or in the uplands
away from flowing water sources. Seasonally, the upland grasses, shrubs, cacti offered a different
food source that could be exploited such as various grass seeds, mesquite beans, prickly pear pads
and tunas, and agave hearts. In addition, at various times, bison were known to graze on the
northern South Texas Plains, and were highly sought after for use as food, hides, and bone tools
(Dillehay 1974).
Depending upon the integrity of these open campsites, archaeologists and the Texas Historical
Commission consider these as perhaps the most significant types of sites in regard to their ability
to contribute to our understanding of south Texas prehistory. A few of the desired ingredients that
can indicate significance include cultural material that is buried beneath the surface in a wellpreserved, stratified, and relatively undisturbed context. Although these situations most frequently
occur within stratified terrace deposits adjacent to streams, they can also occur in upland settings
where the landscape has been generally stable through time. Other ingredients that archaeologists
look for in potentially significant campsites include good organic preservation in the form of
charcoal and/or charred plant remains, faunal preservation, temporally diagnostic stone tools or
ceramics, and intact features such as hearths.
Prehistoric Lithic Scatters or Procurement Sites
Lithic scatters are the next most common type of archaeological site that could be expected along
the three pipelines. These sites simply represent the chipped stone debris and broken tools that
were left behind when Native Americans made new tools or re-sharpened their old ones. The
general absence of fire-cracked rocks and other cultural material normally found at open
campsites suggest that they did not camp there, or remain there for any extended period of time
( However, small camp fires may have been used to heat-treat chert or quartzite cobbles to make
them more knappable). Yet, they were drawn to these isolated locales because of the natural
outcroppings or surface exposures of good quality raw material such as chert or quartzite cobbles.
Examples of chipped stone most commonly found at these sites include cobbles with one or two
flakes removed, called ‘tested cobbles’. That is, the Native Americans knew from experience the
quality of stone that could most easily be flaked and reduced for stone tool production, so they
‘tested’ the cobble to judge whether it was useable or not. If the quality was judged to be inferior,
then the cobble was tossed aside. That is why the majority of tested cobbles found on these sites
are of poor quality, coarse-grained material. While the finished stone tool products are carried
11

away from these sites, what remains are those tools broken during the manufacturing process, and
the thousands of pieces of debitage in the form of flakes and angular debris. Also unique to lithic
scatters where large cobbles are present are snapped ‘quarry blanks’. These are simply cobbles
flakes on both sides, reducing the cobble into a transportable ‘blank’ that can be used to further
reduce it and make finished stone tools from the flakes taken off of it. The unbroken quarry blanks
are usually not found on these sites because they have been carried off, presumably to areas of
south Texas where raw material is not readily available. The snapped or broken quarry blanks are
of little or no use, so they are discarded and left behind.
Lithic scatters range in age from the Paleoindian through the Historic periods and can be found
on any landscape setting where gravels or cobbles have been exposed. Notably, gravel outcrops
that were exposed to the surface a few hundred or thousand years ago could be deeply buried
today, and the opposite could also be true; it all depends on the terrain setting and the dynamics
of landscape evolution through time. Most lithic scatters in Dimmit County have been
documented along upper stream terraces abutting the eroded upland slopes.
Prehistoric Quarries and Procurement Sites
Prehistoric quarries and procurement also can range in age from the Paleoindian through Historic
periods, but differ from lithic scatters in that at those sites Native Americans exploited loose
gravels, but at times they specifically sought quarry sites where raw material such as cherts or
quartzites were not yet freed from their parent geologic formation, and they had to be ‘quarried’.
These types of sites are rare in south Texas for two reasons: 1) the geological exposures generally
do not present themselves, and 2) throughout Texas, even in central Texas, it is much easier to
pick up gravels from the surface than to try to mine them from hard rock. Quarried and chipped
stone remains likely to be found at these sites include large chunks of angular cherts or quartzites,
as well as parent material detritus, and flaking debris. Snapped quarry blanks can also be
expected. Although a handful of prehistoric quarries or procurement sites have been recorded in
south Texas, they are rare.
Prehistoric Burned Rock Middens
There are no burned rock middens in Dimmit County. Burned rock middens result from a series
of multiple-use earth ovens that were constructed much like modern-day roasting pits are dug into
the earth for roasting a pig. With repetitive uses, as the larger rocks that serve as heating elements
in the earthen pit fracture and thus become less effective as a thermal source, they are ‘pitched
out’ around the edge of the pit. As the pit becomes unusable, another is dug near by, and the
procedure repeated. Over time, these multiple pits and the ‘pitched out’ fire-cracked rocks
coalesce together, obscuring each pit as indiscernible. (For a full discussion of the formation of
burned rock middens and their documented presence in Texas, see Leach and Bousman 2001;
Leach et al. 2001; Mauldin et al. 2003).
Prehistoric Burial and Cemetery Sites
Although not common, isolated prehistoric burials and cemeteries have been documented in south
Texas. Individual and isolated burials have been found in association with open campsites in both
12

upland settings as well as in alluvial terraces along streams, but the largest prehistoric cemetery
found in proximity to the Nueces Lateral is 41LK28, in Live Oak County.
Historic Sites
As discussed above in the Cultural Chronology portion of this report, although Spanish ranchers
had established large ranches in northern Mexico by the mid-16th century, and Spanish entradas
began penetrating south Texas in the 1700s and 1800s, there is no record of any sort of permanent
structures in the area during those periods (Chipman 1992), the area was generally not considered
safe for settlement by whites until after the Civil War in 1865, and white settlers then began
establishing smaller ranches and farmlands (Leffler 2011).
Because of the vastness of the landscape and the relatively late settlement and development of
south Texas compared to east and central Texas and northern Mexico, historic sites are not
abundant, but they certainly do exist. The most common types to be encountered are related to
ranching and farming endeavors, or small communities from the 19th and 20th centuries. Site types
most commonly include farmsteads or ranches with corrals, cisterns, chimney and foundation
remains from both main houses and outbuildings, related trash dumps, an occasional family burial
or cemetery, school houses, churches, community buildings, and industry-related structures or
construction projects.
In general, the area has apparently been historically used as ranchland pasture, with no
development other than associated ranching activities such as windmills, stock tanks, corrals, and
sparsely scattered outbuildings. In sum, there may be rare and isolated occurrences of early
ranching activities along the Nueces Lateral, but the expectations of encountering any
archaeological site of significance from the 1500s through the mid-1900s along those portions of
the pipeline were minimal.

Results of A Cultural Resources Background Review
The research by TAAI included:
1) A review of the most current literature documenting the prehistory and history of the immediate
area
2) A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas to identify
what cultural resource surveys have been conducted, and what archaeological sites have been
documented within one mile of the project area
3) A search of various websites that offer old maps of the PA
4) A literature review of both published and unpublished reports and manuscripts that describe
the types of archaeological sites that have been documented, and thus provide insight as to the
13

types of sites that may be expected either in the PA, or immediately adjacent to it
5) A review of a local soils map in order to evaluate the potential for intact and buried cultural
materials either within or immediately adjacent to the PA.
Archaeological Atlas Site and Historic Research Results
Even though only a handful of scattered archaeological surveys have been conducted in Dimmit
County (e.g., Nunley and Hester 1966), these very few surveys have identified over 160
archaeological sites. Archaeological remains such as Clovis, Folsom, and Plainview artifacts
indicate that the area was likely occupied by Native Americans as early as 11,000 years ago.
Without written or oral accounts before the 1700s, it is difficult to nearly impossible to truly say
what bands or tribes were within the modern political boundaries of Dimmit County before then.
Only cultural affiliations can be assigned to those groups, equating their technologies and
apparent lifestyles to the successive Paleo-Indian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric periods (Leffler
and Long 2007). Archaeologists have documented an assundry of prehistoric archaeological sites,
including large open campsites that are most commonly located along stream or river terraces
with numerous campfires, where a wide variety of stone tools, grinding stones, pottery sherds, and
butchered animal remains are found. Where gravels outcrop, either along eroded streambeds, or
on higher terrain where more ancient gravels are sometimes exposed in isolated pockets, one can
expect stone chipping stations, or prehistoric quarries.
Nevertheless, the lack of previously documented sites is thought to be a direct reflection of the
lack of cultural resource surveys near the PA that would have located sites, rather than the
probable non-existence of sites. In fact, the PA lies to the west of a large archaeological survey
conducted in anticipation of the construction of the Choke Canyon Reservoir (e.g., Hall et al.
1986).
During that survey conducted in the 1980s, 116 prehistoric archaeological sites located in both
Live Oak and McMullen counties were documented, ranging in age from 350 years ago to 11,000
years ago. Through all the periods of Choke Canyon's history, humans subsisted by hunting and
gathering natural food resources available in the area. Many of the prehistoric sites are situated
on terrace deposits, ridges, and ridge promontories overlooking streams in the upper reaches of
second and third low order tributaries, and provide evidence that there is a moderate to high
probability for archaeological sites to exist in relatively undisturbed sediments and soils along
certain areas of the three pipelines.
In addition, archaeologists from the Center for Archaeological Research at the University of Texas
at San Antonio conducted archaeological investigations at eight historic sites at Choke Canyon
Reservoir. A number of different types of structures were investigated, the purpose being to
extract as much information as possible about architecture, lifestyles, and settlement patterns
during the last half of the 19th century within the reservoir area. Artifacts recovered helped
recreate the life of the people, demonstrating how they met the challenges of living in a frontier
area, and how life changed after the Civil War and the coming of law and order, railroads, and
modern communications (Fox and Ward 1986).
14

A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Atlas of Texas Archeological sites indicated that
there was one cultural resources survey recorded within one mile of the PA. It was a survey
conducted by Prewitt and Associates in 2003 prior to a Highway 85 improvement project. At that
time, archaeologists documented 41DM151, a deeply buried prehistoric open campsite in terraces
along the west edge of the Nueces River (Atlas 2011). In 1966, Thomas Hester recorded
prehistoric open campsite 41DM49 on the opposite (east) bank of the Nueces, just north of the
highway. At that time he noted that the site which covered about two acres was dotted with
mesquite trees and a few oaks. He also noted that the terrace deposits were being rapidly gullied.
Items observed on the surface as well as in a surface collection from 1964 consisted of 1 Ensor
point, 2 Montell points, bifacial knives and scrapers, debitage, and mussel shells (Atlas 2011).
Approximately 1,500 meters to the south of the western end of the Allee/Nueces laterals is
41DM3, a large Paleoindian open campsite situated on both sides of Highway 85. Even as early
as 1958, this site had been heavily collected, but two Folsom points found here identify it as a
favored occupation area around 10,000 years ago (Atlas 2011).
As shown in Figures 7 and 8, TAAI has conducted several nearby surveys, including the western
portion of the Allee Lateral which parallels the western portion of the Nueces Lateral (Nickels
2011a). Archaeological sites within one mile of the western portion include 41DM155,
41DM165, 41DM168, 41DM169, and 41DM170.

15

Figure 7. Previous archaeological surveys on or near the western portion of the Project Areas,
west of the Nueces River.
Site 41DM155 was recorded by PBS&J archaeologists during a pipeline survey for Anadarko
Petroleum in June 2010. PA. It is described as a prehistoric open campsite in open scrub brush,
on a lower terrace edge some 130 meters south of Carrizo Creek. Firecracked rock hearths, Early
Archaic through Late Prehistoric projectile points, scrapers, hammerstones, and assorted debitage
were observed on the surface, but no artifacts were found in any of the 12 shovel tests excavated
on the site.
A survey of the Pistol Lateral conducted by TAAI in March 2011 resulted in the discovery of no
cultural material (Nickels 2011b). When TAAI conducted a full pedestrian survey of the Nopal
Pearsall Pipeline in January 2011, archaeologists documented three previously undiscovered
archaeological sites (41DM168-41DM170) within one mile of the western end of the
Allee/Nueces Laterals. Sites 41DM168 and 170 are non-significant historic trash scatters, and
41DM169 is a non-significant upland lithic scatter (Nickels 2011c).
During a January 2011 survey of the Circle T 1H Pipeline, TAAI archaeologists documented
41DM165, a small, but heavily disturbed prehistoric open campsite some 650 meters north of the
16

Allee/Nueces laterals portion (Nickels 2011d).

Figure 8. Previous archaeological surveys and reviews east of the Nueces River.
A survey of the 4.9-mile Betty Wilson Lateral was conducted by TAAI in February 2011.
Although 13 isolated artifacts were documented along the right-of-way, no previously
undocumented archaeological sites were discovered, and no cultural material of significance was
found (Nickels 2011e). Finally, TAAI conducted a cultural resources background review of the
proposed Brundage Compressor Facility in July 2011, concluded that there was at best a minimal
potential for significant archaeological deposits to exist, and recommended that the facility be
allowed to be developed as planned with no further archaeological investigations (Nickels 2011f).
Historic Site Potential
The earliest historic accounts of Native Americans in south Texas and perhaps the Dimmit
County area, are those of Cabeza de Vaca. In the 1500s, Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca
traversed parts of southeast and south Texas and left a diary of his five years spent traveling
among the hunter-gatherers of Texas and northern Mexico (e.g., Covey 1961). His account of his
experiences in 1533–34 indicates that groups of Native Americans would normally tether
themselves to the easily exploitable riverine environments in the fall, winter, and summer,
occasionally sending a hunting party onto the grasslands to hunt deer. In the summer, many
17

groups would live near each other in the semiarid environs of South Texas to harvest prickly pear
pads and other succulents (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13–37).
By the 1540s and 1550s, Spanish ranchers had established large ranches in northern Mexico with
thousands of cattle, and using Native Americans as slave labor. This encroachment by the Spanish
forced groups from northern Mexico to flee into south Texas. In the 1700s and 1800s, there are
documented accounts of Spanish entradas passing through the area, but none have been noted to
establish any sort of permanent structures (Chipman 1992).
Because of the relatively low habitation in generally rural areas that the Nueces Lateral passes
through, little or no attention was given to early aerial photography. A standard source of review
is the extensive collection of online maps and aerial photographs available at the Perry Casteñada
Library at the University of Texas at Austin (Perry Casteñeda Library 2011). A second standard
research source consulted for old maps and aerial photographs is a very comprehensive and large
compilation of old maps and aerial photographs compiled by the Texas Department of
Transportation from dozens of historic archives throughout the state of Texas.
In this case, a 1939 Carrizo Springs U.S. Army Corps of engineers topographic map, and a 1939
Big Well U.S. Army Corps of engineers topographic map were found. Neither map shows any
structures existing along the three pipeline right-of-ways. Technically, any structures old than 45
years are now considered of interest by the Texas Historical Commission, and this should be
considered when the pipelines are installed (Perry Casteñeda Library 2011).

Soils Maps
The three pipelines are to be constructed through 24 different soil classifications. Table 1 lists the
soils that will be impacted, and Figures 9 and 10 show these soil areas (Stevens and Arriaga
1985).
A review of Table 1 suggests that there is only one soil along the pipeline where one could expect
a high probability of intact and potentially archaeological deposits to exist; that is where the
pipelines dissect Brundage fine sandy loam on terraces adjacent to small creeks. However, it
should be noted that soils maps and soils attributes are just one composite of predicting buried
and intact archaeological deposits. Equally important are the study of topographic maps that
suggest the likelihood of well-stratified terrace deposits and stable landforms over several
thousands of years. Most notably, a review of the known and significant archaeological sites
within south Texas indicates that they are present along rivers and their first and second order
tributatries.

Field Survey Goals and Methodology
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with limited shovel testing. The topics addressed were
site type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The theoretical framework is
structured around patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems for the South
Texas region.
The goals of the project were to:
1)
locate and record cultural locations and sites in the project area using a systematic
survey methodology;
2)
quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy; and,
3)
place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.

21

Methods and Levels of Effort
Two archaeologists conducted a pedestrian survey of the 2.5-Mile Nueces Lateral, the 7.7-Mile
Nopal-Brundage Oil Interconnect, and the 200-meter Old River Ranch D 1H Pipeline during the
period 18-20 July, 2011. Surface visibility ranged from 90 to 100 percent. All cutbanks, and
rodent and mammal backdirt piles were thoroughly examined. In accordance with a general “no
collection” policy, cultural material of a redundant nature, both prehistoric and historic, were not
to be collected. Instead, they were to be fully documented via sketches, field photographs, and
copious notes.
Exceptions were diagnostic artifacts, particularly those artifacts which could be considered as
significant to the interpretation of Texas prehistory, such as Early Archaic-Paleoindian
transitional, or Paleoindian diagnostics. These were to be collected on a case-by-case basis, and
that decision was left up to the Principal Investigator and/or the Project Archaeologist.
Historic buildings, trash scatters, or other historic occurrences within the ROW were to be
documented as archaeological sites. In addition, any potentially historic buildings 45 years or
older that were located adjacent to the pipeline were to be documented with photographs and
included in this report of investigations.

Results of the Investigations
Surface Examination and Shovel Testing
During the survey it became readily apparent that approximately 90 percent of the surface areas
were either mechanically disturbed, or deflated by artificial processes. However, the surface
visibility was excellent, allowing for the potential discovery of any artifacts along the right-ofway. The only evidence of cultural material observed consisted of two prehistoric open campsites
(41DM178 and 41DM179).

41DM178
Description
41DM178 (Figures 11 and 12) is a prehistoric open campsite occupied approximately 2,400 2,800 years ago, and consisting of fire-cracked rocks, a Castroville dart point, bifacial and
unifacial stone tools, chert debitage, mussel shells, and snails. It is situated on an upper terrace
east of the current Nueces River channel, but adjacent to a relict oxbow channel of the Nueces.
Riverine vegetation such as large oaks and pecans were likely predominant along the relict
channel in prehistory. However, at present, the site’s location east of the oxbow has been recently
cleared of what was likely later dense mesquite, has recently been deeply root plowed, and brush
piles burned. As such, surface visibility was excellent in July 2011. Surface elevation at the site
ranges from 530-534 feet above mean sea level (amsl). Soils on the site consist of Winterhaven
silty clay loam (WnA), alluvial deposits commonly found on rarely flooded terraces in Dimmit
22

County (Stevens and Arriaga 1985; Web Soil Survey 2011).

Levels of Effort and
Results
An inspection of the
hummocky, root-plowed,
and heavily disturbed
surface suggests that the
artifacts are now spread
across approximately
40,500 square meters. A
Castroville dart point
found on the surface
suggests a Late Archaic
occupation, roughly
2350-2750 B.P. (Turner
and Hester 1999).

observed that exhibited
both middle and late stages of reduction. Flake classifications included exterior core reduction,
interior, and bifacial thinning, suggesting a continuum of lithic reduction activities occurred at
the site. The scattered burned and fire-cracked rocks on the surface were predominately chert. The
two shovel tests excavated on the site revealed turbated pale brown sandy loam from 0-35
centimeters below the surface (cmbs) before encountering yellowish brown claypan to 60 cmbs;
only a single tertiary flake in the upper 20 cm was observed in the shovel tests.
Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
41DM178 appears to have been a large open campsite on stratified terrace deposits along an
oxbow of the Nueces River, but now the site has been heavily disturbed by land clearing and root
plowing in the recent past. As such, it appears that little if any integrity of the site remains, and
therefore it possesses no reliable research potential.

41DM179
Description
41DM179 (Figures 14-16) is a prehistoric open campsite of an unknown age, consisting of firecracked rocks, chert debitage, mussel shells, and snails. It is situated on an upper, gently sloping
terrace on the east edge of the Nueces River. Vegetation along the river’s edge is typical riverine
in nature for this area of Texas; namely, large old pecans, oaks, and elms, with assorted brushy
understory. The western edge of the site is defined by a very steep cutbank to the river channel,
circa 5-6 meters below the upper terrace. Away from the river, vegetation gradates to large, old
growth mesquite trees, with a cleared and cultivated field on the western edge of the site. Surface
visibility was very limited due to dense duff and leaf cover. Surface elevation at the site ranges
24

from 538-542 feet above mean sea level (amsl). Soils on the site consist of Winterhaven silty clay
loam (WnA), alluvial deposits commonly found on frequently flooded terraces along streams and
rivers in Dimmit County (Stevens and Arriaga 1985; Web Soil Survey 2011).

Figure 14. 41DM179 site map.
Levels of Effort and Results
An inspection of the surface and cutbank along the Nueces River suggests that the site covers at
least 400 square meters, and most probably extends north and south along the river, beyond the
100-foot pipeline right-of-way (see Figure 14). Artifacts discovered on the surface included firecracked rocks and flakes; selected examples are shown in Figure 17. Mussel and snail shells
suggest that mussels and snails were likely one ingredient of the foodstuffs eaten at the site.
As shown in Figure 14, four of the seven shovel tests excavated on and around the site yielded
either lithic debitage, fire-cracked rocks, or mussel and snail shell fragments. An interior flake and
an exterior flake, along with three small fire-cracked rocks and mussel shell fragments were
recovered from Shovel Test 4 (ST4) between 20-40 cmbs. An exterior chert flake was found in
Shovel Test (ST) 5 between 20-40 cmbs. Two sandstone fire-cracked rocks, mussel and snail shell
fragments were found in ST6 between 20-40 cmbs. One interior flake was found in ST7 between

25

25-30 cmbs. Although
they may not be cultural,
mussel and snail shell
fragments were discovered
between 0-60 cmbs in
ST8.

and Recommendations

a prehistoric open
campsite on stratified
terrace deposits along an
upper terrace of the
Nueces River. At least

this, TAAI recommends that the site be avoided during construction of the pipeline.

mussel shell fragments.

Survey Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
A full pedestrian survey with limited shovel testing along the proposed 2.5-Mile Nueces Lateral,
the 7.7-Mile Nopal-Brundage Oil Interconnect, and the 200-Meter Old River Ranch D 1H
Pipeline in north-central Dimmit County resulted in the discovery of two prehistoric open
campsites.
One of the two (41DM179) was assessed as potentially significant, while the second (41DM178)
was assessed as heavily disturbed and therefore potentially non-significant. As such, Tierras
Antiguas recommended that 41DM178 be avoided during construction of the proposed pipelines.
Based upon these recommendations, Mockingbird Midstream Gas Services, L.L.C. (Mockingbird)
agreed to bore under 41DM179 so that any cultural deposits will not be adversely impacted.
Finally, Tierras Antiguas further recommended that if any additional, undiscovered cultural
resources are encountered during development, such finds should be examined and evaluated by
Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant.
