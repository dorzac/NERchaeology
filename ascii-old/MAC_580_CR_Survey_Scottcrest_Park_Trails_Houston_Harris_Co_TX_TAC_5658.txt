ABSTRACT
On June 11, 2010, Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc., conducted a cultural resource survey
investigation of proposed trail system improvements in Scottcrest Park in central Harris County,
Texas. The objectives of the investigation were to locate and identify cultural materials, sites, or
historic properties within the proposed impact area, and to prepare management recommendations
regarding any identified resources. The investigations were conducted for Talley Landscape
Architects, Inc., at the request of the City of Houston, and in coordination with TxDOT (CSJ
0912-72-067), under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 5658. An intensive pedestrian field
survey of the project area was conducted, and included both surface and subsurface (shovel test)
examination. A total of 15 shovel tests were excavated. The shovel tests identified the presence
of thick clay fills containing shell and concrete fragments overlying the entire planned trail route.
The shallow depth of the planned construction impacts (18-24 in) will be limited to this layer of
fill, and should not affect any underlying natural soils. An assessment of the surrounding
residential and commercial buildings determined that while many date to pre-1966, none appear
to be architecturally significant. No evidence of archeological or historic remains or features was
identified in any of the shovel tests.
Consequently, no further archeological investigations are currently recommended. However,
should deeper construction impacts be proposed for future development, backhoe trenching is
recommended to prospect for deeply buried cultural deposits. In the event that archeological
deposits or features should be encountered during construction, work should cease in the
immediate vicinity and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission contacted
for further consultation.

INTRODUCTION
surface drainage. The maximum depth of
subsurface impacts from concrete trail
construction within the 8 ft wide trail APE
will be 18-24 inches.
While THC
procedures no longer allow for surveys to be
restricted to the footprint of park
improvements such as trails, an exception
was made in this instance due to the fact that
the project has been âin the pipelineâ long
before this rules change took effect, and to
survey the entire park would impose an
onerous burden on the City of Houston.
This compromise was reached in
consultation with Scott Pletka and Allen
Bettis of TxDOT ENV and Mark Denton of
the Archeology Division of the Texas
Historical Commission in February and
March of 2010. Mr. Bettis reported to
Moore by phone on March 12, 2010, that
Mr. Denton would accept a survey of a 50-ft
alignment along the new trails construction
routes, and documentation of the portions of
the project where trails currently exist, and
are to merely be resurfaced. Consequently,
the survey focused on a 50 ft wide alignment
centered on both the extant and proposed
trail routes.

On June 11, 2010, Moore
Archeological Consulting, Inc., conducted a
cultural resource survey investigation of
proposed trail system improvements in
Scottcrest Park in central Harris County,
Texas. The objectives of the investigation
were to locate and identify cultural
materials, sites, or historic properties within
the proposed impact area, and to prepare
management recommendations regarding
any identified resources. The investigations
(MAC PN 10-09) were conducted for Talley
Landscape Architects, Inc., at the request of
the City of Houston, and in coordination
with TxDOT (CSJ 0912-72-067), under
Texas Antiquities Permit Number 5658.
The project area is depicted on the
Bellaire and Park Place USGS quadrangles
(Figure 1), and consists of the approximately
22 acre City of Houston, Scottcrest Park.
The current park trail system consists of an
existing 2-3 ft wide asphalt pathway that
traverses the park boundary in a roughly
triangular-shaped trail. The proposed trail
improvements
(Figure
2)
include
reconstructing the southern and western
portions of the existing trail (identified as
Trail A), and building two new sections of
trail, one approximately 600 ft (ca. 183 m)
long section (Trail C) that cuts across the
middle of the park, and an approximately
400 ft (ca. 122 m) long section that links the
park to Dulcimer Street, (and the
neighboring residential subdivisions to the
west).

An intensive pedestrian field survey
of the project alignment was conducted, and
included both surface and subsurface
(shovel test) examination (see Appendix 1
for details). A total of 15 shovel tests were
excavated.
The investigations were
conducted by project field archeologist
Randy Ferguson and field technician
Rachael Goings. David Driver served as the
projectâs principal investigator.

The proposed park trail will consist
of an 8 ft wide concrete trail flanked by
limited landscaping designed to facilitate

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
indicate that residential development did
begin in the vicinity sometime between 1947
and 1955. However, the specific project
area appears to have had little or no
significant urban activity aside from the
sewage disposal plant on the eastern edge of
the tract.

Soils and Geology
Harris County is located within the
West Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic
province (Hunt 1974). In the Texas region,
the surface topography of the plain is
characterized by relatively flat topography
that dips slightly towards the Gulf of
Mexico. Geologically, the project area lies
atop the Beaumont Formation, a surface
outcrop that extends from just east of the
Mississippi River in Louisiana, to
Kingsville, Texas (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1982).
The formation was
deposited during a series of glacial and
interglacial events during the Middle to Late
Pleistocene. Extensive riverine downcutting
and erosion of the formation occurred during
the periods of lower sea levels associated
with the Wisconsin glaciation. During the
Holocene, after sea levels rose once more,
the resulting river valleys filled with alluvial
soils, creating broad, level floodplains.

Climate
The modern climate of the Harris
County study area is moderated by winds
from the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in mild
winters and relatively cool summer nights
(Wheeler
1976:2,
66).
Summer
temperatures average 92Â°F (33Â°C), while
winter temperatures average 64Â°F (18Â°C).
Annual precipitation averages 46 inches
(117 cm).
Hydrology
The project area is located along the
north bank of Sims Bayou, a perennial
stream
that
flows
into
Buffalo
Bayou/Houston Ship Channel.

The proposed project area is
depicted on sheet 122 of the Soil Survey of
Harris County, Texas (Wheeler 1976). One
soil type dominates within the project area
boundary. This is Lake Charles-Urban
complex. The Lake Charles soils are
somewhat poorly drained clayey soils of
ancient alluvial origin. They have a low
geoarcheological potential (Abbott 2001)
and are typically shallow. Lake Charles soils
are not typically known to contain
topographically raised or mounded features.
However, pimple mounds (or their
remnants) are visible in aerial photographs
of the tract, particularly in the southern
portion closest to Sims Bayou. Such mounds
were often used by Native Americans,
particularly when they were within close
proximity to water sources such as ponds or
streams.

Flora and Fauna
Harris County lies within the
Austroriparian biotic province (Blair
1950:98-101). Not determined by a marked
physiographic break, the western boundary
of this province is loosely identified by the
distribution of pine and hardwood forests on
the eastern Gulf coastal plain. The county is
situated within the pine-oak subdivision of
the Austroriparian province (Tharp 1939).
Blair (1950) lists the dominant floral species
of the pine-oak forest subdivision as loblolly
pine (Pinus taeda), yellow pine (Pinus
echinata), red oak (Quercus rubra), post oak
(Quercus stellata), and blackjack oak
(Quercus marilandica). Hardwood forests
are found on lowlands within the
Austroriparian and are characterized by such
trees
as
sweetgum
(Liquidambar
styraciflua),
magnolia
(Magnolia
grandiflora), tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica), water
oak (Quercus nigra), and other species of
oaks, elms, and ashes, as well as the highly

common water turtles. Common lizards
include Anolis carolinensis, Sceloporus

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
Southeast Texas Culture History
The project area is located within
the southeast Texas archaeological region
(Patterson 1995; Story et al. 1990). The
culture history of the region extends back at
least 12,000 years into the past. A number
of researchers have compiled chronological
frameworks to describe the cultural histories
of the area (Aten 1983; Ensor 1991;
Patterson 1995; Shafer et al. 1975; Story et
al. 1990). The majority of these divide
human occupation into four broad stages,
Paleoindian, Archaic/Lithic, Ceramic/Late
Prehistoric, and Historic. The stages are
based on a proposed sequence of economic
strategies as they are revealed through the
archaeological and/or historical record.
These proposed shifts in dominant lifeways
consider
cultural,
economic,
and
technological factors in order to provide a
heuristic model useful for attempting to
understand ancient and early historic
populations. While the dates assigned to the
period interfaces are based on "absolute"
dating methods, they of course represent a
generalized time range for the implied
cultural evolution. The dates provided in the
following discussion will be drawn from
Ensor (1991) and are presented in Table 1.

The earliest period of occupation in
southeast Texas is identified as the
Paleoindian stage. Based on the earliest
securely dated appearance of populations in
the New World, this stage begins around
11,000-10,000 B.C., and lasts for
approximately 4000 years. During this time,
it is proposed that populations continued
with a highly nomadic hunting tradition
brought with them from the Old World.
Traditional models emphasize the heavy
reliance that these groups placed on the
hunting of the large mammals of the
Pleistocene. Plant foods and small game
undoubtedly supplanted this diet, and may
have played a more important role than
previously thought (Black and McGraw
1985; Patterson 1995).
Artifact types
associated with this phase include various
fluted and non-fluted lanceolate projectile
points, such as Clovis and Folsom. In
general, due to a paucity of well-stratified
older sites, the Paleoindian stage remains
poorly defined in southeast Texas.
By 8000 B.C., the Late Wisconsin
glaciation had ended, increasing climatic
aridity and creating extensive changes in the

5

environment. As a result, the majority of
Pleistocene megafauna became extinct. This
required drastic changes in the dominant
subsistence strategies of the affected
populations. By 8000 B.C., the start of the
Early Archaic stage, the remaining southeast
Texas populations had adapted to the
environmental changes by shifting to a
lifeway dominated by seasonal scheduling.
This type of subsistence economy
specializes in a regionally circumscribed and
repetitive exploitation of specific floral and
faunal resources. By remaining in familiar
territory, the nomadic populations were able
to better exploit the various resources
available within their local environment.

However, research has suggested
that human population densities remained
low in the area, and may have even
decreased significantly during this time
(Moore and Moore 1991). Eventually, the
stabilization of the climate by around 1000
B.C., the start of the Late Archaic, appears
to have led to increasing populations. This
rise in regional population may have been
further facilitated by the development of
long-distance
trade,
technological
innovations, and changing social relations
(Patterson 1995).

The final prehistoric period in
southeast Texas is marked by the emergence
of ceramics. Ceramic artifacts appear in the
archaeological record of the Galveston Bay
area by approximately A.D. 100, and by
A.D 500, had been adopted by a number of
inland populations (Pertulla et al. 1995). A
plain, sand-tempered type of ceramic
identified as Goose Creek became prevalent
during the period, although a number of
decorated varieties and tempering materials
were also present (Patterson 1995; Pertulla
et al. 1995). The appearance of Caddoan
pottery in southeast Texas around A.D.
1000-1300 has been used to suggest the
presence of extended trade networks or
migration during this time (Aten 1983). The
period has also been associated with the
introduction of the bow and arrow around
A.D. 600 (Aten 1983).

Historic Overview
European contact in the region
began in the early 16th century with the illfated NarvÃ¡ez expedition that, in 1528,
deposited Cabeza de Vaca onto the Texas
coastline, possibly on Galveston Island.
More long-term contacts resulting from
permanent European settlement did not
directly impact aboriginal lifeways in
southeast Texas until the early 18th century
(Patterson 1995).
However, European
diseases introduced by explorers and early
traders had begun to affect Native American
populations in Texas by the 16th century
(Ewers 1974). Throughout the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries, epidemic diseases,
the mission system, and the fur trade
seriously reduced, and in some cases
exterminated, the indigenous populations
residing in the region.

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
included lithic scatters and a significant
Archaic cemetery site, the vast majority of
sites appear to have been focused on the
exploitation of freshwater shellfish resources
and are located directly adjacent to the
active waterways.

Prior
to
beginning
field
investigations,
Moore
Archeological
Consulting, Inc., performed a background
investigation of archeological and historical
literature relevant to the project area.
Literature examined for this project includes
site inventory records on file at TARL,
previous archeological investigative reports
on file at the Texas Historical Commission
(THC)
and
Moore
Archeological
Consulting, Inc. and other published
literature pertinent to the current project.
The archival background search determined
that no previously recorded archeological
sites are located in or near (within Â½ km) the
project property.

The most extensive survey along
Clear Creek was conducted by the Texas
Archaeological Survey (McGuff and Cox
1973) in preparation for massive flood
control project that would enlarge and
rectify most of the streamcourse. The
project examined almost the entire length of
the creek, covering from just west of the
Fort Bend/Brazoria Coun0ty line, all the
way to Galveston Bay. A total of 76
prehistoric and 2 historic sites were
identified.
They noted a bimodal
distribution of sites (McGuff and Cox
1973:2), with concentrations located in the
lower reaches of the creek near Clear Lake
(between miles 2-5), and in the upper
reaches (between miles 23-28). This latter
group of sites was located on terraces
alongside an incise meander, and consisted
of 41 pimple mound sites and four terrace
sites (McGuff and Cox 1973:18-19). They
reported that no sites were located west of
this concentration, though they attributed
this lack to previous channelization. A
similar lack of occupation for the upper
portion of Clear Creek has been reported by
Howard et al. (1992). They identified three
types of sites (shell middens, terrace sites,
natural mound sites) that corresponded to
topographic and environmental zones
mapped along the creek. Based on their
geomorphological assessment of the Clear
Creek waterway, there is an implication that
the lack of sites in the upper reaches is due
more to the relatively steep nature of the
stream profile, and the resultant increased
surface erosion (Howard et al. 1992:4).

The current project is located along
Sims Bayou. Although a significant portion
of the bayou appears to have been included
in a 1979 Corps of Engineers survey (Texas
Sites Atlas), only two prehistoric sites,
41HR275 and 41HR1035 (Driver 2008),
have been identified along the stream. In
addition to Sims Bayou, the project is
located in an area that contains a number of
other stream systems, including Armand
Bayou, Berry Bayou, Horsepen Bayou,
Taylor Bayou, Clear Creek, Mud Lake, and
Clear Lake. Previous investigations along
many of these water sources have
documented a high density of prehistoric
occupation.
The earliest work done in the area
was conducted by avocational archeologist
Wayne Neyland in the 1950s along the
banks of Clear Lake. Further investigations
followed in the late 1960s and early 1970s,
with surveys of Clear Creek, Armand
Bayou, and Mud Lake (Aten et al. 1976;
Corbin and Hester 1968; Fields and Jackson
1984; Fischer et al. 1984; Hole 1974;
McGruff and Cox 1973; Mercado-Allinger
et al. 1984). Although the site types have

FIELD METHODS AND RESULTS
The fieldwork was conducted on
June 11, 2010, and consisted of a 100%
pedestrian survey that included systematic
shovel testing and visual examination for
surface exposure of cultural materials.

Historic Structures Review by Roger Moore
In addition, the project APE was
evaluated in terms of its potential impact to
historic structures. A review of the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP), the list
of State Archeological Landmarks (SAL),
and the list of Recorded Texas Historic
Landmarks (RTHL) indicated that no
historically significant resources have been
previously documented within the project
APE. It has been determined through
consultation with the State Historical
Preservation Officer (SHPO) that the APE
for the proposed project is the current rightof-way.

The
Scottcrest
Park
trails
improvement project area is depicted on the
Bellaire and Park Place USGS quadrangles
(Figure 1). The proposed project consists of
the renovation of approximately 2350 ft (ca.
716 m) of existing asphalt trail, and the
construction of approximately 960 ft (ca.
293 m) of new trail (Figure 2). The
proposed park trail will consist of an 8 ft
wide concrete trail flanked by limited
landscaping designed to facilitate surface
drainage.
The maximum depth of
subsurface impacts from concrete trail
construction within the 8 ft wide trail APE
will be 18-24 inches. After consultation
with THC and TxDOT, it was determined
that the survey alignment would be limited
to a 50 ft wide corridor centered on the on
both the extant and proposed trail routes.
The park grounds are open and cleared of
most trees (Figures 3, 4). The landscaping
consists of closely mown grass, providing
very little surface visibility.

The plans for the proposed trail at
Scottcrest Park place most of the trail at a
distance that considerably exceeds this 100ft threshold for distance to surrounding
structures both within and outside the park.
The closest approach to the 100-ft mark is
the segment of the trail that is south of the
rear yards of homes located on the south
side of Airport Drive.
This segment,
however, is one where a trail along the same
alignment already exists, and all that is
currently proposed is a replacement of the
surface of that part of the trail.

A total of 15 shovel tests (STs 1-15)
were excavated, each in 10 cm levels and
screened through Â¼â mesh (Figure 5;
Appendix 1). Each of the projectâs shovel
tests were recorded and plotted on the
project map. The shovel tests identified the
presence of deep clay fills with concrete and
shell fragments throughout the trail
alignment. Due to the density of this fill,
depths of the shovel tests were limited, and
ranged from 23-62 cmbs, with an average
depth of 43.3 cmbs. None of the tests were
able to reach the underlying natural soils.

A visual reconnaissance of the
structures in the vicinity of the park was
conducted at the time of the pedestrian
survey. This assessment confirmed that
most, but not all of the surrounding
residential and commercial buildings
appeared to fall within the pre-1966 period
calling for consideration.
The closest
residences are of a construction and
appearance typical of small, two bedroom
working class homes. These Baby Boomperiod suburbs flourished on the fringes of
Houston in the late 1940s and the 1950s.
Whether pre-dating 1966 or not, they are
united
by
being
architecturally
undistinguished (Figures 6-9).

No prehistoric or historic cultural
materials or features were found in any of
the shovel tests.

RECOMMENDATIONS
containing shell and concrete fragments
overlying the entire planned trail route. The
shallow depth of the planned construction
impacts (18-24 in) will be limited to this
layer of fill, and should not affect any
underlying natural soils. An assessment of
the surrounding residential and commercial
buildings determined that while many date
to pre-1966, none appear to be
architecturally significant.

On June 11, 2010, Moore
Archeological Consulting, Inc., conducted a
cultural resource survey investigation of
proposed trail system improvements in
Scottcrest Park in central Harris County,
Texas. The objectives of the investigation
were to locate and identify cultural
materials, sites, or historic properties within
the proposed impact area, and to prepare
management recommendations regarding
any identified resources. The investigations
(MAC PN 10-09) were conducted for Talley
Landscape Architects, Inc., at the request of
the City of Houston, and in coordination
with TxDOT (CSJ 0912-72-067), under
Texas Antiquities Permit Number 5658.

Consequently,
no
further
archeological investigations are currently
recommended. However, should deeper
construction impacts be proposed for future
development,
backhoe
trenching
is
recommended to prospect for deeply buried
cultural deposits.
In the event that
archeological deposits or features should be
encountered during construction, work
should cease in the immediate vicinity and
the Archeology Division of the Texas
Historical Commission contacted for further
consultation.

An intensive pedestrian field survey
of the proposed trail alignment was
conducted, and included both surface and
subsurface (shovel test) examination. A
total of 15 shovel tests were excavated. No
evidence of archeological or historic
remains or features was identified in any of
the shovel tests. Instead, the shovel tests
identified the presence of thick clay fills
