Dedication
This work is dedicated to the memory of my three grandmothers, Ella Elaine
Shepherd Meadows, Margaret Linnea Anderson Johnson, and Wilma Anderson
Jindra. They were in Illinois for the stories, they were in Florida for the baseball,
and they were in North Carolina for the walk. They are still with me.

Acknowledgements
A lifetime of experiences has brought me into the spheres of many, many
exceptional people. Family members, teachers, mentors, colleagues, and friends
have all had a profound impact on me. It was from them that I learned not just
how to complete tasks and goals, but how to live. And to them I express a deep
and abiding gratitude that I will forever carry with me, a gratitude that cannot be
expressed in words. Indeed, the many people with whom I have had the privilege
to simply meet, or work with, or watch for awhile, can be included in this sphere.
In the completion of a work such as this, it is important to identify
individuals by name that had a significant impact during the difficult and lengthy
process of completing a doctoral degree. The list is long. Perhaps the people who
have been most instrumental in completing this dissertation are the members of
my dissertation committee. As my academic advisor and committee chair,
Thomas R. Hester has been teacher, mentor, and friend. Through these years,
Tom has shown both approval and dismay at my performance. He taught,
rewarded, cajoled, and admonished me when appropriate. And I owe him thanks
for the many times when, despite frustration at my sporadic or undisciplined
efforts, he continued to support my work wholeheartedly.
I extend sincere thanks to Fred Valdez for his academic support as a
mentor, but also for the invitations to Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners over
the years. Being able to meet the families of Fred and Palma and share their
hospitality is something that I will not soon forget. Samuel Wilson was
instrumental in completion of this project both as a teacher and one who knew
how to press all of the right buttons to get me to perform, and to finish. Elizabeth
Graham has been both mentor and friend. As the Director of the Lamanai
Archaeological Project, Liz was the first to suggest a comparative analysis of the
assemblages from both Lamanai and Altun Ha. Liz also provided critical
v

academic and financial support, and for this I am very grateful. Over these years,
Harry Shafer has been the source of stimulating conversation with regard to Maya
lithics and excavations at Colha, as well as always providing insightful and
helpful suggestions with regard to the current study. I sincerely thank each of
these folks for serving on my dissertation committee.
Other faculty and staff members at the University of Texas and elsewhere
who have helped me along the way include Darrell Creel, who as the Director of
the Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory, provided me a place to finish the
study after Tom retreated to the hidden canyons of Medina County. I also would
like to thank Harry Iceland, who was friend and mentor during my early days in
Texas, and with whom I have engaged in many interesting discussions regarding
lithic analysis and Mesoamerican archaeology in general. Dale Hudler, with
whom I have debated lithics, hunter- gatherer theory, and politics over the years,
also helped me continue work at TARL. As Graduate Coordinator for the
Department of Anthropology, Celeste Neathery always provided important
information to me in a professional and friendly manner. Thanks to Monica Trejo,
Laura Nightengale, Diane Ruetz, Rosario Casarez, Carolyn Spock, and Milton
Bell, who all make TARL a pleasant place to work. I would also like to thank
illustrators Kim Kersey and Louise Belanger who drew artifacts at Lamanai, as
well as George St. Claire and Pamela Headrick who drew many of the Colha
artifacts here in Austin. Thanks to Debra Walker and to Arlen and Diane Chase,
who gave me my first opportunity to do archaeology in Belize at Cerros in 1993
and at Caracol from 1994- 1996, respectively. I also thank Linda Schele, who as a
teacher and scholar has had a profound impact on me.
My fellow graduate students in the Department of Anthropology and at
other institutions were often the source of conversation, support, and friendship.
Foremost among these is Carmen Ruiz. I would like to thank Apen for her
friendship and many conversations on life, politics, anthropological theory, and
vi

the history of archaeology. The times I have been able to spend with Apen and her
daughter Lucia are ones that I hold very dear. Christopher Ringstaff taught me
most of what I know about flint- knapping, geography, and fishing in central
Texas. Ed Baker taught me much about regional geomorphology, archaeology,
and the history of punk rock in Austin. Thanks also to Tamra Walter and Yorke
Rowan for many conversations regarding archaeology, and to Sharon Dornheim
for her kind words and encouragement. My friendship with Angela Matusik
helped me to continue forward and taught me much about life. For these valuable
lessons, I thank Angela. Thanks also to Richard Bidstrup and Maureen Carpenter
for their friendship.
Research has carried me to Belize, Central America and Toronto, Ontario
where I again encountered many exceptional individuals. In Belize and back in
central Texas, Brett Houk has always been there with a wry comment and a plan.
His insightful comments and skills as a field archaeologist and editor are
undeniable. My work at Chan Chich with both Brett and Hugh Robichaux
provided me with important field experience. During my work at Chan Chich, I
was fortunate to meet Kristen Hartnett, a gifted student and archaeologist whom I
would like to thank for both support and friendship.
At Lamanai and in Texas, Terry Powis was prominently present. His
friendship, knowledge of Maya archaeology, and the hours spent in Indian Church
with our compadre, Norbert Stanchly helped keep spirits afloat and research on
track. At Lamanai and in Toronto, Noberto has provided support and friendship. I
would also like to thank Laura Howard of the Lamanai Field Research Center for
her support and friendship over the years.
At Lamanai, perhaps no one person has helped me understand the
complexities of being Maya in the modern world than Don Nasario Ku. I would
like to thank Nasario and his family for being very supportive of my work and for
being friends with me. Nasario's cultural knowledge transcends time and his
vii

contributions to the current work are subtle and many. Also, I would like to thank
Guadalupe Cunil of Indian Church, for his support. In Belmopan, at the Belize
Department of Archaeology, Allan Moore, Bryan Woodye, John Morris, and
Carmen Blanco all helped to facilitate research as the professionals that they are. I
thank all the folks in the Department for their help and support.
In Toronto and in Belize, David Pendergast provided both data critical to
the study, as well as conversation and friendship. I would like to thank David for
the information he has provided regarding archaeological contexts of the lithic
assemblages from Altun Ha and Lamanai. In particular, two meetings we had in
the fall of 2000 were critical for stimulating continued research. At the Royal
Ontario Museum, I would like to thank Susan Sivric and Mima Kapches, who
helped me gain access to the collections located there. In a similar track, I would
also like to thank Harriet Beaubien, Objects Analyst at the Smithsonian Center for
Materials Research and Education and Research Fellow Jill Plitnikas for initiating
and conducting the preliminary materials characterization study.
I would like to give a very special thanks to Kay Sunahara for friendship,
conversation, and support over the course of the last year. During my extended
stay in Toronto last fall, I was fortunate to make Kay's acquaintance. From that
point on, we have spent many hours engaged in dialogue about politics,
archaeology, and life in general. Kay is a special person whose friendship is very
important for me.
Finally, but perhaps most importantly, I would like to thank the members
of my immediate family. My father, Richard K. Meadows, Sr., my mother,
Gwendolyn J. Meadows, and my brother, Andrew F. Meadows. They form the
core, the inner sphere, so to speak. And without their love and support, both moral
and financial, I am nowhere. I express my undying gratitude for what they have
given me. I hope that someday I can begin to repay them. As for now, I continue
the journey forward. Siempre adelante!

Crafting K'awil: A Comparative Analysis of
Maya Symbolic Flaked Stone Assemblages
from Three Sites in Northern Belize

Supervisor: Thomas R. Hester
This dissertation presents a material culture analysis of three
archaeological assemblages of symbolic flaked stone artifacts recovered from the
Maya sites of Altun Ha, Colha, and Lamanai, Belize. Individual artifacts are
described and categorized guided by morphological and technological similarities.
The dissertation contextualizes further the emergence of a distinct style of
northern Belize symbolic lithics that exhibits linkages with regional technological
antecedents. The exploration of these linkages is positioned within a theoretical
framework that views material culture as a crystallization of three intersecting
modes of cultural interpretation: technological knowledge, local political
economy, and symbolic context.
Symbolic analysis focuses on the correlation between the lithic forms and
themes prevalent in other Maya artistic media. It is suggested that flaked stone
symbols both structured meaning and were historically emergent. Thus, meaning
ix

of artifacts changed during the processes of production, acquisition, and ritual
consumption. Technological analysis focuses on contrasting the assemblages to
show how existing technology was elaborated upon in different places. The
technological study resulted in the recovery of textile and pigments present on a
significant number of artifacts. This supports the argument that these forms were
part of a complex process of production that included painting and adorning
individual artifacts prior to final deposition. Further materials characterization
analysis revealed a number of interesting results with respect to the composition
of these ancient materials. It is hoped that the convergence of these diverse modes
of inquiry has shed new light on a frequently occurring yet enigmatic class of
ancient Maya material culture.

Chapter 1: Material Culture Analysis and the Study of
Maya Flaked Stone Symbols: Introduction
k'awil- derived from the K'iche' Maya word q'abawil. Defined as a general term
for a small idol or statue of a deity and the spirit of the deity contained within,
usually made of stone or wood (Carmack 1981: 318; also Tedlock 1986: 78;
Freidel et al. 1993: 200).
This dissertation presents the results of a material culture analysis of three
assemblages of flaked stone symbols made of chert. Chert or microcrystalline
silicate was a critical resource for ancient people in fashioning both utilitarian and
symbolic implements. In Mesoamerica, chert was used for over 10,000 years in
both gatherer- hunter and more complex society settings. In the eastern Maya
lowlands, more specifically northern Belize, quality chert was available in large
subsurface nodules or as tabular deposits outcropping along low ridges (Hester
1982, 1985; Iceland 1997; Potter 1993; Shafer 1979, 1985; Shafer and Hester
1983, 1991).
Commonly known as chert eccentrics, the artifact assemblages included in
the present study were recovered from the ancient Maya centers of Altun Ha,
Colha, and Lamanai, located in northern Belize, Central America and have been
recovered at sites across the Maya lowlands (Coe 1959, 1990; Eaton et al. 1994;
Hester 1985; Joyce 1932; Kidder 1947; Pendergast 1979, 1982, 1990).
Archaeologists have recognized material culture as playing a critical role in the
production of cultural and community identity, and more traditionally, as
reflecting stylistic variation, cultural continuity, and culture change (Bartlett and
McAnany 2000; Godelier 1973, 1986, 1999; Hodder 1982, 1986, 1990; Jenkins
1996; Shanks and Hodder 1998; Shennan 1989; Willey and Phillips 1949; Wobst
1977). Researchers working in the Maya culture area have implemented a variety

1

of methods in the analysis of material culture, to construct spatial and
chronological distributions, identify intra- and inter- regional exchange networks,
articulate stylistic innovation, and define the emergence of social hierarchy
(Adams 1971; A. Chase 1992; Demarest 1984; Gibson 1986, 1989; Gifford et al.
1978; Graham 1987a, 1994; Hester 1985; Hester and Shafer 1994; McAnany
1989, 1989a; Pendergast 1979, 1982, 1990; Rents- Budet 1998; Sabloff 1975;
Smith 1952; Valdez 1987). Similar to other classes of material culture, with
perhaps the exception of ceramics, flaked stone artifacts frequently appeared as
part of monographs and descriptive reports, but were rarely subjected to

2

comparative study (Coe 1959; Joyce 1932; Kidder 1947; Pendergast 1979, 1982,
1990; Probst 1984; Rovner 1976; Willey 1972).
A shift in the emphasis of archaeological investigations over the last three
decades has taken place in the Maya area, as broader subsistence, settlement, and
socioeconomic considerations have been addressed. As well, advances in the
study of iconography and the decipherment of Classic Period Maya texts have
also renewed research and brought accounts of the ruling class more clearly into
our interpretations (Freidel et al. 1993; Grube 1994; Kelley 1976; Mathews 1985;
Schele and Freidel 1990; Schele and Mathews 1998; Schele and Miller 1986;
Stuart 1989). With respect to technological and economically oriented research,
material culture studies have focused more intensively on lithic assemblages at
numerous lowland Maya sites (see Aldenderfer et al. 1989; Dreiss 1988; Gibson
1986, 1989; Hester and Shafer 1991; King and Potter 1994; McAnany 1986,
1989, 1989a, 1991; Michael 1993; Mitchum 1992; Potter 1993; Shafer 1979,
1985; Shafer and Hester 1983, 1991 for explanatory and processual approaches to
lowland Maya lithic assemblages).
These analyses center on production, consumption, and exchange of stone
tools recovered from workshop and domestic contexts. The results were
implemented in comparative and diachronic studies of lithic tool forms recovered
from regional localities. These studies centered on defining economic foci and
peripheries that in many instances contrasted with lowland political foci.
Moreover, by defining community- wide lithic craft specialization, a producer and
consumer economic model of utilitarian and symbolic lithic artifacts originating
in the eastern Maya lowlands was proposed (Hester and Shafer 1994; Dockall and
Shafer 1993; McAnany 1986, 1989, 1991).
With respect to the class of Maya material culture presented here,
investigations have shown us that in the eastern lowlands, existing lithic
3

technology was elaborated upon, and ultimately became a medium in which more
complex symbolic meaning was inscribed during the Late Preclassic Period (400
BC to AD 250) and through the Classic Period (AD 250- AD 900) (Gibson 1986,
1989; Iannone 1992; Iannone and Conlan 1993; Thompson 1996). Paradoxically,
unlike chert tool forms, archaeological investigations have yet to reveal a
production locality for this class of material culture. Despite the lack of
production data available for these flaked stone symbols, the end result of
production can still be studied utilizing multiple analytical approaches.
What has become clear is that these forms exhibit meaning from a number
of perspectives, including both the technological and political- economic spheres.
Moreover, individual forms were part of a complex ideology that constituted
Maya social life. By implementing a comparative study of assemblages from three
eastern lowland sites, continuity in terms of technology and form can be
established. These symbolic forms can then be linked to historical, cosmological,
and aesthetic themes appearing in other ancient Maya media.
This dissertation draws from two broadly defined analytical traditions, the
descriptive- contextual approach, ubiquitous to the Maya area, and the
comparative approach, also prevalent in lowland Maya research, and employed
here to integrate new and existing data. The data presented here form the basis of
a regional "typology" of flaked stone symbols produced on locally available raw
material. Perhaps more important, individual artifacts are categorized and
described not only for the purposes of defining a regional tradition via
classification, but also to link flaked stone symbols to the crafting and
transformation of human communities.

THREE SITES IN NORTHERN BELIZE
From a spatial and cultural perspective, the proximity of Altun Ha, Colha,
and Lamanai to each other motivated a comparative study of this artifact class
recovered in relatively large quantities at each site. Proximity was also an
important consideration in terms of occupational history. Archaeological
investigation at each site has determined that there were long term chronological
overlaps in terms of cultural and social fluorescence (Hester et al. 1981, 1982,
1994; Pendergast 1979, 1981, 1982, 1990). Indeed, there is extensive architectural
and artifactual evidence that imply complex political and economic relationships
existed between the elites at Altun Ha and Lamanai (Pendergast 1981, 1986,
1992, 1998). This evidence appears to be supported by the present study.
Location of each site within the region was a second consideration in
applying a comparative approach to the artifact assemblages. This is in part due to
the natural occurrence of raw material from which the artifact class under study
was produced. Both Altun Ha and Colha are located in what has been defined as
the chert- bearing zone (Hester 1985). The chert- bearing zone (cbz) is a roughly
80km by 35km region in northern Belize where relatively uniform
microcrystalline silicates occur in large subsurface nodules or outcrop along low
ridges that cross the region (see Cackler et al. 1999; Luedtke 1992; also Tobey
1986 for provenance studies of northern Belize cherts).
Evidence for large- scale production of chert tool forms has been
extensively documented at Colha (Hester and Shafer 1984, 1994; Shafer and
Hester 1983, 1991). Lithic production on a lesser scale has been documented at
sites to the south at Chicawate, in close proximity to Altun Ha (Kelly 1982;
Meadows 1997; Shafer and Hester 1991). In concert, the location of Lamanai
some 40 km to the west of Altun Ha and along the largest inland body of water in
the region, the New River Lagoon, also hints that regional and dynamic inter- site
5

political- economic relationships were in place by the latter part of the Late
Preclassic Period. These relationships are reflected in the context and forms of
flaked stone symbols and other forms of material culture, primarily ceramics,
occurring at individual sites.
ECCENTRIC LITHICS AS MATERIAL SYMBOLS
Maya eccentrics, referred to here as flaked stone symbols, occur
archaeologically in a variety of forms and were produced in both chert and
obsidian (see Coe 1959; Iannone 1992; Joyce 1932; Pendergast 1979, 1982, 1990;
Probst 1984; Willey 1972). This study focuses exclusively on artifacts made of
chert in order to assess the development and continuity of a specialized regional
technology that was elaborated as symbol beginning sometime in the latter part of
the Late Preclassic (AD 100) and appearing archaeologically through the
Terminal Classic Period (AD 850- AD 950) with a much smaller number of forms
appearing in the Postclassic (AD 950- AD 1350). It is hoped that by focusing on
artifact assemblages comprised of locally available raw materials, the
technological knowledge necessary to produce such artifacts can be
contextualized in terms of a localized political economy and broader symbolic
and ideological spheres in which they were produced, acquired, and consumed.
Throughout the development and practice of Maya archaeology, nonutilitarian flaked stone artifacts comprised of chert and recovered from Maya sites
have been referred by a variety of monikers that have occasionally, but not
always, incorporated the term eccentric in the classification. These include
ceremonial flints, eccentric flints, and eccentric lithics (Coe 1959; Iannone 1992,
Iannone and Conlan 1993; Joyce 1932; Pendergast 1979, 1982, 1990; Willey
1972). As previous researchers have described, both implicitly and explicitly, the
eccentric category refers generally to any flaked stone artifact that is

6

asymmetrical in shape and cannot be classified as a tool form (Joyce 1932; Coe
1959; Kidder 1947; Iannone 1992). Thus, when compared to standardized,
utilitarian chert tool forms, such artifacts appear to be irregular or unusual and
thus, eccentric. Joyce, as early as 1932 expressed that the term eccentric was
ingrained in the literature.
With regard to the artifacts from Altun Ha and Lamanai, David Pendergast
has frequently used the term ceremonial flint (1979, 1982, 1990). This term
possesses implicit meaning in the sense that the forms were likely used
ceremonially during ritual deposition. However, evidence from the present study
also suggests that individual artifacts often had a lengthy use- life prior to final
deposition.

Moreover, the raw material from northern Belize cannot be

considered flint, as flint is defined lithologically as cryptocrystalline in
composition. By referring to such artifacts as flaked stone symbols, I want
reinforce the idea that these materials are explicitly symbolic forms that can be
produced in both chert and obsidian. In this sense I am attempting to initiate the
lengthy process of replacing such a term in the vernacular of Maya archaeology.
It is argued here, and previous researchers have indicated, the term
eccentric is a misnomer (Coe 1959: 16; Iannone 1992: 6; Pendergast 2000:
personal communication). Not only are many individual forms symmetrical, the
repetition of forms apparent within the assemblages presented here clearly dispels
the notion that flaked stone symbols are indeed eccentric. And while a number of
artifacts are unique in form, these artifacts have distinct themes inscribed in the
iconography and cosmology of the ancient Maya. In devising an interpretive
framework for study, it is thought that many of the forms represent historical
figures and (or) events that were defined and legitimated, in part via production
and display of the forms. Rather than classifying and describing this class of
material culture as eccentric, and thereby obscuring the notion that we can
7

interpret cultural meaning, this study attempts to position these artifacts as threedimensional symbols that possessed cultural value from a number of perspectives.
By positioning these lithic artifacts as meaningful on multiple levels, it is
hoped that relevant artifact histories can begin to be reconstructed. The current
work synthesizes technological, morphological, and contextual data with respect
to assemblages of flaked stone symbols produced on chert and classified in prior
studies as eccentrics (see Coe 1959; Gibson 1989; Iannone 1992; Joyce 1932;
Kidder 1947; Probst 1984; Willey 1972). A total of 508 specimens drawn from
the three sites were the focus of research. Individual artifacts comprising the
assemblages take a variety of anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, celestial, and more
abstract forms. Thus, morphological similarity, technological continuity, and
contexts of final deposition form the basis for the typological and descriptive
study.
The second focus of study is perhaps more directly related to the notion
that individual artifacts both represent and structure meaning and value (see
Lesure 1999; Robb 1998, 1999). In this sense, individual forms are linked with
visual representations in other ancient Maya artistic media. In concert with these
linkages, individual artifacts are considered as sites of cultural meaning.
Macroscopic, microscopic, and materials characterization analysis of a smaller
number of individual specimens indicate that artifacts were often adorned with
appliquÃ©s that oftentimes represented anatomical features made from different
materials, as well as pigments. Appliques were held in place by resin that, in some
cases is still visible on artifact surfaces. This adornment was part of a complex
production process. Moreover, small samples of cloth were also recovered from
artifacts, indicating that some symbols were perhaps wrapped and (or) bundled
prior to deposition. Further analysis of pigment and cloth samples support the
notion that individual artifacts possessed inherent cultural value, via artistic
8

elaboration and personification. The decoration of artifact surfaces further links
individual forms, and the individuals and communities that crafted them to local
history, broader cosmological and mythological themes, and the production of
specific social relations in a political- economic context (see Godelier 1996;
Helms 1993; Weiner 1992; Robb 1998).
ORGANIZATION OF THE DISSERTATION
The remainder of Chapter One outlines in detail the research design
devised to undertake the present analysis of flaked stone symbols recovered from
the eastern lowland sites of Altun Ha, Colha, and Lamanai, Belize. This research
design includes the methods applied to the consideration of the assemblages as a
whole, as well as to the analysis and description of individual artifacts. Much of
this portion of the chapter was previously articulated in the dissertation
prospectus, but there have been numerous changes in the working hypotheses as
the study has progressed. These changes have been integrated into the original
research design. The methods section includes a broad discussion of technology
and context, both factors of which were considered in the structuring of the
artifact groupings. I also discuss, in describing these forms, how parallels with
Maya iconography became apparent. Finally, the research goals of the materials
characterization analysis are articulated.
Chapter Two focuses on describing the environmental and physiographic
context of the eastern Maya lowlands and specifically, northern Belize. It is clear
that the physical environment shaped the emergence and histories of these centers
during the Late Preclassic and Classic Periods. As well, the cultural environment
framed the political- economic relationships that formed between the centers, as
well as communities affiliated within each center. The extensive chert resources
present in the region provided the material necessary for large-scale production of

9

both utilitarian and symbolic lithic forms. The chapter will include discussion(s)
of physiography of the region, vegetation and faunal resources, geology, soils,
and lithology.
Chapter Three presents the archaeological context for the study of Maya
flaked stone symbols. This chapter reviews in more detailed fashion the history of
archaeology in the eastern lowlands over the last century. The first part of the
chapter contains a discussion of the research programs undertaken at the sites
from which the flaked stone symbols in this study originate. The second part of
the chapter briefly traces the culture history of each site. Contextual information
and chronology for the assemblages of artifacts under study are presented.
Chapter Four presents a discussion of anthropological and archaeological
approaches to craft specialization. This consideration of craft specialization is
then integrated into a discussion of ancient Maya social and political
organization. In turn, political- economic considerations are articulated centering
on lithic craft specialization as evidenced among the ancient Maya. A theoretical
framework for a political economy of flaked stone symbols is proposed based on
both the archaeological evidence and theoretical approaches to material culture
drawn from classic and more recent works of anthropology. The writings of
Mauss (1966), Godelier (1996), and Weiner (1992) as well as others are
introduced to position the material culture assemblages analyzed in the present
study within the context of non- capitalist complex societies.
Chapter Five is a description of the artifact groupings constructed for the
assemblages under study, as well as the organizational structure of artifact
description and appearance in the Appendix at the end of the dissertation.
Artifacts from each site were grouped according to morphological and
technological categories and subsequently described (see Appendix). A

10

description of the criteria for classification as well as images of selected
individual artifacts accompanies each morphological category.
Chapter Six is a symbolic analysis of the assemblages of non- utilitarian
flaked stone artifacts included in the current study. This chapter focuses on
interpretations of artifact meaning. In this chapter, artifacts are positioned as
material symbols that can be linked to other ancient Maya artistic media. The
writings of Robb (1998, 1999) are introduced to frame the discussion of the
meanings of flaked stone symbols among the ancient Maya. Interpretation is
based on recent developments in the study of ancient Maya art and iconography.
Lithic artifacts are juxtaposed with images from other forms of ancient Maya art
to draw parallels between meanings embodied in diverse artistic media.
Chapter Seven is a technological analysis of the assemblages based on
the data collected during analysis. The results of materials characterization
analysis undertaken by researchers at the Smithsonian Center for Materials
Research and Education is also presented. The technological analysis focuses on
continuity of Maya lithic technology through time, as well as contrasts in
technology between the assemblages. Despite the lack of production data with
respect to flaked stone symbols, finished forms exhibit a breadth of technological
information. Quantitative data obtained from individual artifacts comprising each
assemblage are compared and contrasted.
Despite individual differences, these data show that macroblade,
macroflake- blade, and nodule reduction technology, developed nearly a millennia
prior to the beginning of the Classic Period, and employed in the production of
utilitarian tool forms, was also employed in the production of explicitly symbolic
forms. The results of a subjective classification of raw material is presented to
articulate variability and continuity within and between assemblages, evidence

11

used in conjunction with technological and contextual data to argue for two or
more primary production loci across the region through time.
The summary of the materials characterization analysis focuses on textile
and pigment samples recovered from a select number of artifacts. The results of
which are interpreted with respect to the larger production process. The
observation and recovery of materials and residues on artifact surfaces indicates
that the production process of individual symbols was complex and that there
were several steps involved in completing a symbol. Indeed, the elaboration via
the application of paint on some forms further indicates the complexity of
meanings associated with these artifacts. This elaboration supports the notion of
an extended use- life for individual artifacts.
Chapter Eight is a discussion of the conclusions within the theoretical
framework presented in Chapter Four and Chapter Six.

Chapter Eight also

addressed the implications of the study with respect to a conjunction of both
positivist and more interpretive methods of research. In terms of the present
study, these perspectives led research toward multiple avenues of investigation,
and the integration of several research methods. Thus, the deployment of multiple
methods permitted a wider perception of the material culture under study.
The Appendix presented at the end of the dissertation provides additional
information that can be integrated with the text, or used as stand alone
comparative data. This appendix presents individual artifact descriptions of the
three assemblages as well as images of selected artifacts.
RESEARCH DESIGN
In the following section, a broad framework for investigating assemblages
of flaked stone symbols recovered from the eastern lowland sites of Altun Ha,
Colha, and Lamanai is presented (n= 508). The primary goal of the dissertation is

12

to document artifacts from each of the three assemblages by constructing a
typology, hereafter referred to as artifact groupings. The artifact groupings are
based on form (morphology), technology, and context (see Willey 1972, 1978).
This section outlines five broad hypotheses addressing the appearance of the
artifact class under study at particular sites, the use of raw material, the complex
process of production, and the morphological and technological basis for the
construction of the artifact groupings. The methods of interpretation employed to
articulate the complex processes by which these material symbols were produced,
acquired, and ultimately consumed in cultural context are outlined.
Cultural Production in Classic Period Maya Society
The ancient Maya produced and surrounded themselves with materials
that actively participated in the negotiation of social and political relationships
(Agurcia- Fasquelle and Fash 1991; Bartlett and McAnany 2000; Fash 1988;
Iannone 1992; McAnany 1995; Schele and Freidel 1990; Schele and Miller 1986).
To reiterate, flaked stone symbols occur as a range of anthropomorphic,
zoomorphic, celestial, staff ends, as well as more abstract forms (Coe 1959;
Gibson 1986; Iannone 1992, 1993; see also Thompson 1996; Willey 1972, 1978).
These forms primarily occur archaeologically in sealed contexts, either interred in
dedicatory or termination caches placed in strategic location within temples and
palaces, oftentimes along the axis of structures (see Pendergast 1998). Symbolic
forms also occur in numerous types of burials, including tombs, crypts, cysts, and
interments (Iannone 1992, Pendergast 1979, 1982, 1990; Probst 1984).
Recently, Iannone (1992) has proposed that flaked stone symbols were
part of a local and regional ancestor cult originating among emerging middle class
and elite Maya lineage groups, beginning in the 4th century AD and spreading
across the Maya area from the eastern lowlands (Iannone 1992; Iannone and

13

Conlan 1993). Prior to this limited interpretation, flaked stone symbols were
documented in large assemblages at sites in the eastern lowlands (Eaton et al.
1994; Gibson 1986; Pendergast 1979, 1981, 1982, 1990; Probst 1984). The
concept of an ancestor cult linked communities and places into larger political,
mytho- historical and religious webs of significance (Iannone 1992; Iannone and
Conlan 1993; McAnany 1995).
Flaked stone symbols, as is the case with most material culture, were part
of a common ideology and helped to legitimate political authority when used in a
ritualized setting. As Rice (1987: 84) has noted, the power of the Classic Period
Maya elite came not from direct control of production or distribution, but instead
from the manipulation and assertion of genealogies and history. At least some
flaked stone symbols indeed were part of elite public displays or even war events,
but others may have been used in restricted access or even elite domestic ritual.
There appearance in caches and burials helped link the interred with local history
and larger cosmological events and or characters (Freidel et al. 1993; Schele and
Freidel 1990; Schele and Miller 1986).
Moreover, it has been demonstrated that flaked lithic forms appear in
Maya iconography on ceramics, stone sculpture, and in murals as part of larger
group performances manifest in public art (Freidel et al. 1993; Iannone 1992;
McKinney 1985; Probst 1984; Schele and Freidel 1990; Schele and Miller 1986).
It is clear that these performances served to reinforce social and political
relationships as well as individual and group identity (Bartlett and McAnany
2000; Grube 1994; McAnany 1995; Schele and Freidel 1990). The appearance of
flaked stone symbols in ancient Maya art also illustrates that these implements
were abstracted to produce the image of an indigenous characterization of their
consumption (Schele and Miller 1986). These concepts are powerful indicators of

14

the motivation(s) that existed in Classic Period society for their production and
acquisition.
Technological and Political- Economic Meaning
Closer examination of modes of cultural production provides insight into
how material symbols are manipulated and utilized across cultural settings (King
2000; Robb 1998, 1999). For example, the appearance of flaked stone symbols in
burial and cache contexts suggests group identity in the form of ancestor
veneration (Iannone 1992; Iannone and Conlan 1993; McAnany 1995). In any
scenario, the presence of flaked stone symbols index the ideological hegemony of
the ancient Maya elite. Moreover, the production of specific forms was also the
result of the efforts of individual and groups of craft specialists (see Helms 1993;
also Shafer 1979, 1982, 1985, 1994; Torrence 1978).
The role of the chert crafter in transforming raw material to a culturally
recognizable symbol gave the crafter a distinct place within society (Helms 1993).
The crafter and indeed the craft community where artifacts were produced were
both linked to other, the world outside, cross cutting local alliances (Helms 1993).
These links provided social and political legitimation to the craft communities
within the broader social hierarchy. The cultural practice of applying
technological knowledge is an integral part of the process of assigning aesthetic
meaning to material culture (Helms 1993; Lucie- Smith 1981). By recognizing
signature forms and technologies of flaked stone symbols, spatial and temporal
parameters for their production and use can be proposed.
Equally important to an understanding of flaked stone symbols in ancient
Maya cultural context is the transmission of knowledge required to produce these
artifacts. The skills that were required to produce a single, aesthetically
acceptable form, let alone hundreds are complex. Just as local and regional

15

symbolic knowledges, flaked stone technology was accessible to relatively few.
Over the last few decades, researchers have begun to address the complexity of
lowland Maya lithic economies, in terms of both symbolic and utilitarian items
(Hester and Shafer 1994; McAnany 1989, 1991; Potter 1993; King and Potter
1994). It is posited that the social relations of production that mediated the
acquisition of flaked stone symbols were part of a complex political economy that
cut across kinship lines and socioeconomic class.
Production of flaked stone implements of any kind was influenced by raw
material location. It is important to reiterate that the location of quality chert is a
point of departure for addressing development of bifacial macroblade and
macroflake- blade technology. It is clear from the data that the appearance of this
technology emerged earliest at the site of Colha, and later within the lithic craft
communities associated with Altun Ha. Despite Colha's relatively small size and
rural locale in comparison to the larger centers of Altun Ha and Lamanai, crafters
at Colha were producing flaked stone symbols in the form of stemmed
macroblades for interregional exchange as early as the Late Preclassic (400 BCAD 250). This artifact form appears at site in the Peten and in the Yucatan (Hester
and Shafer 1994; Rice 1987) It is posited that this technology was later elaborated
upon at Colha as well as other locations in the region (Gibson 1989; Shafer and
Hester 1983, 1991).
It has been suggested that production of chert implements at Colha shifted
during the Late Classic Period, and that intensive lithic production became
focused at Altun Ha and the adjacent site of Chicawate (Shafer and Hester 1983,
1991). How this shift in overall lithic production relates to the production of
flaked stone symbols is unclear. What is clear is that the northern coastal plain of
Belize was the focus of production, acquisition, and consumption of flaked stone
symbols dating to the latter part of the Late Preclassic (AD 100 - AD 250).
16

However, it was during the Classic Period (AD 250- AD 900) that these
implements appear at Altun Ha in large numbers. They also appear at Lamanai
during the Late and Terminal Classic Periods, albeit in cache contexts. As David
Pendergast has noted, artifacts occur in similar quantities at both Lamanai and
Altun Ha if only consideration of cache contexts is undertaken (Pendergast 2000:
personal communication). It is posited that these material symbols reflect the
presence of a political economy of flaked stone symbols linking crafters of flaked
stone with the elite who acquired and eventually consumed them a ritualized
context. By examining how these forms were standardized morphologically and
technologically, their production and acquisition can be better understood.
COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS: FIVE HYPOTHESES
This study is centered on five broad hypotheses that are articulated to
position the artifact assemblages within a framework that employs morphological
similarity to link individual artifacts with one another. This framework can then
be used to assess the assemblages in broader cultural context. The following is an
articulation of the hypotheses with relevant implications in terms of the forms and
contexts of the artifact assemblages included in the present study.
Hypothesis One
Flaked stone symbols occur at Colha by the end of the Late Preclassic
Period (sometime prior to AD 250). Their appearance in tomb and cache contexts
begins at Altun Ha by AD 550 and in more limited contexts, at Lamanai by AD
700. Moreover, flaked stone symbols occur less frequently at Colha through the
Classic Period, ceasing by the Terminal Classic (AD 800- 850). At Altun Ha,
symbolic forms no longer appear in tomb contexts after AD 850. Flaked stone
symbols are present in cache contexts until at least AD 1100 (see Pendergast

17

1982, 1990). At Lamanai, the appearance of flaked stone symbols in primary
contexts ceases by AD 900.
It is hypothesized that formal variation will be most prevalent between the
Colha assemblages and the later Altun Ha and Lamanai assemblages. The Altun
Ha and Lamanai assemblages will show elaboration in terms of form. It is
hypothesized that the Colha assemblage will exhibit significant variation in
technology as exhibited by the presence of both bifaces and notched blades.
Flaked stone symbols will not occur in contexts dated later than AD 1100.
Implications of Hypothesis One
The majority of the assemblage from Colha date to the Late Preclassic,
with some specimens dating to the Late Classic. Tomb and cache contexts at
Altun Ha and Lamanai exhibit artifacts that are associated with the Late and
Terminal Classic Periods (AD 600- AD 900). As the elite communities at Altun
Ha gained political- economic power, the acquisition of flaked stone symbols
became one material aspect of elite ritual displays. Eventually, concomitant with
a shift in the mode of production at Colha during the Early Classic Period (AD
250- AD 600), signature technologies appearing at Altun Ha and Lamanai in the
Late Classic indicate that production locus shifted. By the end of the tenth
century, flaked stone symbols in standardized form no longer appear in large
numbers at these three sites.
Hypothesis Two
Variation in color, texture, and the presence of inclusions in raw material
comprising individual artifacts can be combined with morphological and
technological data to initiate a consideration of production loci. It is apparent that
all raw materials originated from the chert- bearing zone of northern Belize. It is

18

hypothesized that significant differences in raw material appearance in the
assemblages will support the assertion of multiple intra- regional sources of chert,
and at least two broadly defined production localities.
Implications of Hypothesis Two
Flaked stone symbols are bounded by technology, raw material, time, and
space. By examining the raw material that comprises the three assemblages in the
present study, we can begin to at least narrow the sources of the raw material.
This macro- level analysis cannot reveal specific quarry sites or production loci.
Instead the comparison provides further indication for shifts in raw material usage
and more indirectly, production locus. Trace element data has revealed intraregional patterning in terms of local chert composition (Tobey 1986; Cackler et
al. 1999). However, overall homogeneity of the chert has made further refining of
individual sources difficult. It is posited that raw material variation between
assemblages links production to changing quarrying and production loci within
the complex political- economic history of northern Belize.
Hypothesis Three
It is hypothesized that technological and morphological comparison of the
flaked stone symbols from Altun Ha, Colha, and Lamanai will identify a highly
standardized lithic technology developed from macroblade and macroflake- blade
technology. This technology was prevalent among the craft community at Colha
during the Late Preclassic (400 BC- AD 250) and through the Classic Period (AD
250- AD 850).

19

Implications of Hypothesis Three
Technological standardization will be assessed utilizing both metric
measurements of individual pieces, as well as metric measurements of flake scars
present on each piece. Flake scar terminations, the presence of initial striking
platforms and platform remnants, curvature of the piece in relation to the original
macroblade or macroflake- blade, and the presence of cortex and (or) thermal
alteration are the variables which were examined in the technological study.
While artifact morphology will provide the basis for the typology based on
repetition of form, descriptive statistics based on the technological data are
employed to document technological patterns present in each assemblage.
Differences in the occurrence of specific attributes support the argument for
significant technological variation present between assemblages.
Hypothesis Four
It is hypothesized that artifacts were painted and (or) adorned with
appliquÃ©s that at held specific features of a form in place, perhaps as part of a
process of personification. The presence of preserved textiles indicates that some
artifacts may have been bundled prior to deposition. A macro- analysis of the
surfaces of artifacts comprising the three assemblages indicates the presence of
staining, residues, thermal alteration, and surface polish. It is hypothesized that
samples of pigments selected from Altun Ha and Lamanai will yield similar
elemental and mineralogical composition.
Implications of Hypothesis Four
If these materials were decorated, handled extensively, and (or)
personified via emically based cosmological prescriptions, they possessed
substantial cultural value. Materials characterization analysis employing

20

techniques such as scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectrometry,
and x- ray diffraction procedures will provide data that may indicate composition
and perhaps standardization of both pigments and textile technology.
Hypothesis Five
Classic Period lowland Maya iconography present on ceramics, mural art,
as well as carved stone and wood exhibit numerous forms that are similar to lithic
forms originating from Altun Ha, Colha, and Lamanai. It is hypothesized that
individual forms can be linked to tangible cultural and ideological themes that run
through Maya art. Themes include a depiction of particular cosmological and (or)
historical events. These include animals that played important roles in mythology,
captives, sacrifice, eclipses and celestial events. The assignment of meaning to
individual and groups of flaked stone symbols was part of a production and
transmission of an iconography of power. Moreover, the themes reflected in
individual artifacts were constitutive of the social relations of production and
acquisition.
Implications of Hypothesis Five
By examining individual forms within a context of what we know about
ancient Maya worldview, we can begin to understand how the Maya used a
variety of media to access knowledge and produce a specific ideology. Moreover,
the production of these forms also helped the individual and (or) community of
crafters who produced them create their own social identity. Thus, by gaining a
further understanding of the meaning inscribed in these symbols, we gain a
clearer understanding of those who created them, as well as those who consumed
them, whatever the precise context of their use. Systematic comparison with

21

iconographic representation includes juxtaposing lithic forms with examples from
other Classic Period Maya media from a number of lowland Maya sites.
The present study has revealed that assemblages show remarkable
technological similarity across the region and through time. However,
morphologically the assemblages exhibit significant variation, especially
prevalent between the Colha assemblage and the later Altun Ha and Lamanai
assemblages. The addition of qualitative data with respect to materials present on
artifact surfaces is critical to obtain a perspective on the production process that
went beyond chert working and included both elaborate painting and adornment.
FLAKED STONE SYMBOLS IN REGIONAL PERSPECTIVE
Over the last three decades, archaeological research in the eastern Maya
lowlands, along the coastal plain of northern Belize, has shown that during the
Preclassic and Classic Periods, this area was not a cultural backwater but an area
that possessed a vibrant political- economic and social life, and indeed exhibited a
distinct regional culture. This region, with itâs extensive chert resources was the
focus for the elaboration of a lithic technology that played a critical role in
furnishing the inhabitants of the region with utilitarian tool forms on a large scale.
Moreover, this lithic technology also became the vehicle through which symbolic
implements used in elite ritual activity were produced. Production of both kinds
of lithic forms, utilitarian and symbolic, were an integral part of the production of
political economy, social identity, and ideology within the region.
The social relations that motivated the production of flaked stone symbols
were part of a larger process of cultural production. The crafter's place within
ancient Maya society was one in which social identity was simultaneously part of
and separate from the elite communities with which they interacted (Helms 1993).
By crafting these symbolic implements, the chert crafters were making a social

22

identity that was intertwined with all of the trappings of human social life. This
likely included competition and alliance within and across socioeconomic and
political boundaries. As has been shown in prior studies, the Classic Period was a
time of intense political competitiveness in the lowlands, a time that saw
increasing efforts by the elite to reproduce their positions of power via the
formation of politically expedient factions and exercising the significant power of
traditional lineages. In either case, lithic crafters were no doubt an important part
of the production of material culture necessary to legitimate and maintain power
(see Brumfiel 1994; Pohl and Pohl 1994; Reents- Budet 1998).
In closing this introductory chapter, I offer a final thought regarding what
this dissertation may or may not accomplish. The basis of this study lies not in
preconceptions of inevitable artifact function in a material sense, economic
growth, monopolization of resources, and universalized laws of supply and
demand so prevalent in studies of archaic states. Instead, I hope to consider Maya
society as local and historically emergent, within a constitutive ideological
framework.
Thus, it is critical to view these artifacts as the crystallization of
technological knowledge necessary for their production, the political- economic
context in which the production, acquisition, and consumption of artifacts
occurred, and finally the broader ideological structures that are refracted through
individual symbols. Utilizing approaches from archaeology, symbolic and
interpretive anthropology, lithic technology, and political economy, it is hoped
that a wide, yet accurate lens be cast in the analysis and synthesis of an important
element of ancient Maya material culture.

23

Chapter 2: Environmental Context
A detailed descriptive analysis of any bounded physical environment is
difficult. This is especially prevalent in describing the physical environment of
the eastern Maya lowlands in relation to the human communities that occupied
this particular region through time. Drawing on data that is gathered under our
own dualistic separation of the physical/ material and the mental/ ideological/
imaginary worlds, the goal of this chapter is to present a description of the region
that considers recent environmental data while simultaneously not presuming
such information had any bearing on ancient Maya ontology.
Such a separation of the material and the ideological is much less certain
when considering the physical environment from the cultural perspective of the
ancient Maya. There is little doubt that communities possessed explanations of
their local surroundings interwoven with culturally driven conceptions of time,
history, and the cosmos. A complete explanation of this worldview is admittedly
inaccessible via environmental data, material culture, or even the written record.
Drawn from our current knowledge of archaeology, iconography,
epigraphy, and ethnohistory, it has become apparent that the Maya intertwined the
ideological and the physical in a fundamentally different, yet perhaps as equally
complex a conception of the universe as our own epistemological constructs. Yet
by describing the present physical environment of the lowlands, and to some
degree subsequent interpretations of societal impact on a dynamic and changing
environment during the Late Preclassic and the Classic Periods (400 BC- AD
900), we can begin to grasp the importance of the physical environment to the
historical trajectories of Maya society. Thus, we can begin to integrate our
knowledge of that environment into an interpretation of the social context that

24

saw, in the case of the present study, the elaboration of a regionally defined
material technology into a symbolic form.
This chapter provides a description of the physical environment associated
with and adjacent to the three sites under consideration. The chapter focuses first
on the larger geographic area of the Maya lowlands, and then narrows in scope
considerably to northern Belize. Included in this larger discussion are discussions
of regional physiography, geology, soils, and floral and faunal resources.
Moreover, a lengthy description of the lithology of the chert- bearing zone is
presented to familiarize the reader with the formation and appearance of
microcrystalline silicates in this region. The chert bearing soils of northern Belize
were the source of the quality lithic material utilized extensively by the Maya. It
is my view that by understanding this environment in our own terms, we can
begin to understand how the use of geographically bounded raw material resulted
in the production of observable material culture assemblages.
PHYSIOGRAPHY OF THE YUCATAN AND THE EASTERN MAYA LOWLANDS
The Maya lowlands include the Yucatan Peninsula, the eastern portions of
the Mexican state of Tabasco, contiguous areas of Belize, and the Departments of
the Peten and Baja Verapaz, Guatemala. The Maya lowlands are comprised
geologically of a broad limestone platform that emerged during the early portion
of the Pleistocene Epoch from a large shallow sea that covered nearly twice the
surface area as the present day Gulf of Mexico. Despite a relatively similar
geological composition, landforms and rainfall patterns vary greatly across the
shelf (Rice 1993; Hartshorn et al. 1984).
Broadly defined, the Yucatan shelf is comprised of Oligocene and Eocene
age limestones that were eventually transformed and uplifted from a marine
environment (Lopez Ramos 1975; Maldonado- Koerdell 1964 as cited in Rice

25

1993: 12). To the south in the northern and central Peten, limestones are older
Jurassic and Cretaceous material (Lopez Ramos 1975).
The surface of the Yucatan is karstic, the northern portion of which
consists of very little elevation and no free flowing surface water. However, this
area exhibits an extensive subsurface aquifer that was accessible via large voids in
the karst. These large, primarily circular voids are known locally as cenotes.
Cenotes provided fresh water to Maya communities in both ancient and
contemporary times, and play an important part in Maya cosmology. Indeed, most
of the Yucatan exhibits similar karst features and sinks interspersed with abrupt
ridges and irregular protuberant rocks. Caves and underground streams are
common. The karstic topography exhibits few other physiographic features, with
the exception of the Puuc Hills, a series of low inland hills located in the western
portion of the region.
In the northern portion of the Yucatan, the dry karstic surface and
subsurface drainage system predominates. This region can be defined
hydrologically as possessing an internal drainage system, where ground water
rapidly infiltrates the porous carbonate rock and seeps into subterranean aquifers.
The water discharges as submarine springs and sinkholes. In general, Tabasco, the
northern Yucatan, Quintana Roo, and northern Belize all occur on geologically
recent land forms that exhibit large areas of sands and gravels, and are marked by
poor soil development and in some areas sparse vegetation (Rice 1993).
Elevation in the lowlands in terms of absolute sea level, as well as the
overall geologic age of the substrate increases as one moves from north to south
(Rice 1993: 13). Along the eastern extent of the lowlands, the Caribbean coast of
Belize exhibits extensive deposits of sand and limestone marl overlaying marine

26

Figure 2.1- Map of Yucatan Peninsula and Maya area (from Sharer 1994)

27

terrace gravels and coastal alluvium that formed during the Quaternary. Rice
(1993) labels this material sascab, a soil formation was an important resource use
for construction mortar (Johnson 1983: 16; Rice 1993: 14). Though the Yucatan
proper exhibits no rivers, northern Belize possesses a number of relatively short,
shallow rivers that flow primarily east- northeast, emptying into Chetumal Bay
and the Caribbean Sea. The northern most of these rivers, the Rio Hondo flows
along a series of karstic folds that mark the western most extent of the coastal
plain.
The eastern coast of the Yucatan and Belize, extending to the Bay of
Honduras exhibits a reef and island system that embays an extensive area of
shallow water lagoons. Sitting atop the limestone substrate, the lagoons and short
eastern flowing rivers are part of a series of perched aquifers that provided
extensive resources of fresh water. The presence of this reef island embayment
has created an extensive network of mangrove swamps that surround numerous
small islands. These mangrove areas provided a rich habitat for marine and bird
life as well as numerous narrow, twisting channels leading to broad coastal
lagoons and, in northern Belize, the mouths of local rivers and streams. These
mangrove swamps also obscure the divide between the littoral and mainland.
There is considerable archaeological evidence that the shallow water littoral along
the northern coast of Yucatan and along the coast of Belize saw extensive salt
manufacture during ancient times (see Andrews 1983; MacKinnon and Kepecs
1989; Valdez and Mock 1991).
Across the central portion of the Yucatan gradual uplift known as the
Sierrita de Ticul runs from the northwest to the southeast and marks the northern
boundary of a Miocene beach lining the shallow sea from which the northern half
of the Yucatan emerged. This line represents the boundary with the more level
northern zone of the Yucatan Peninsula (West 1964 as cited in Rice 1993: 14).
28

The Miocene littoral marked by the Sierrita has undergone extensive folding, and
exhibits a series of ridges, some reaching as high as 50 m above sea level
extending across the shelf from the Gulf to the Caribbean sea. The hilly karstic
zone drops off to the southeast to the coastal plain of northern Belize, where
lower limestone folds, known as cohune ridges, show a similar topographic
pattern. This central area is also interspersed with rivers and lagoons.
To the south, the east- west folds of limestone across the central Peten
extend from 100 m to 300 m in elevation. This contour falls to a more gradual
series of ridges and folds to the east, rising some 45 to 55 m above mean sea
level. The northern Peten is much younger physiographically as compared to the
older southern portion of the shelf and exhibits much less contour. Overall, the
Central Peten can be characterized topographically as rugged with broken karstic
hills and ridgeland, swamps, and seasonally inundated depressions. Surficial
drainage of the central lowlands is characterized by inland marshes, streams,
sinkholes, and bajos that are present between numerous folded and eroded ridges,
and larger flood plains comprised of basins lined with residual clays deposited
between folded ridges of the upland terraces (Rice 1993: 17).
To the west, dividing the Peten and portions of the states of Chiapas and
Tabasco is the broad basin of the Usamacinta River and it's associated tributaries
and distributaries. South and east of this broad basin, the interior of the Peten is
drained by the Pasion and Chixoy Rivers, as well as Lake Petexbatun. Each of
these regions saw the elaboration of a distinct pattern of monumental
construction, material culture styles, and historical trajectory during the Late
Preclassic and Classic Periods of Maya civilization. Primarily comprised of
lowland tropical rainforest in contemporary times, the area also exhibits
significant contour in the form of low hills that drop off to the west along the
Usamacinta Basin.
29

Similar to the Yucatan and the Peten, northern Belize is a region that
possesses obvious geographic and physiographic boundaries. Located in the in
southeastern portion of the lowlands, the region exhibits marked contrast to the
Paleozoic horst topography of the Maya mountains to the south (Johnson 1983).
northern Belize is bounded on the north and west by the Rio Hondo valley, on the
south by the Belize River, and on the east by the Caribbean Sea. Elevation in the
coastal plain of Belize does not exceed 40 m above mean sea level (Hammond
1981).
This region saw intensive occupation by the ancient Maya and their
predecessors dating to some 3000 BC (Hester et al. 1996; Iceland 1997). Though
shallow, rocky soils predominate over much of the area, the presence of
permanent water courses and a number of ecological zones which include:
extensive freshwater swamps, coastal mangrove littoral, riparian hardwood
forests, and upland cohune forests provided an environment in which human
populations flourished. Major rivers and streams in the region include: the
Northern River, the Rio Hondo, the New River, the Belize River, Quashie Banner
Creek, Santana Creek, Rancho Creek, and the tributaries and distributaries of the
New River Lagoon. As mentioned previously, shallow lagoons such Kateâs
Lagoon are located to the north and east of the indigo crocodile (the New River
Lagoon) that stretches down from northeast to southwest in the north central
portion of the region. The crocodile plays a critical part in the iconography,
cosmology, and no doubt the popular imagination of the ancient communities that
inhabited the ancient Maya cities and towns, villages and hamlets of the Belizean
coastal plain.
The western half of the northern Belize lowlands is comprised of low
limestone or cohune ridges and valleys running primarily to the north- northeast.
The Rio Hondo, Boothâs River, and the Rio Bravo mark the eastern most extent
30

of a series of superficial fracture zones along which riverine environments settled
(Rice 1993). As indicated, shallow rivers drain both the eastern and western
peripheries of the region. The eastern half of northern Belize is comprised of flat
coastal plain with numerous coastal and inland swamps. The region also exhibits
considerable area of lowland pine ridge forest. Northern Belize also contains part
of the bajo complex of depressions present on the eastern periphery of the
Yucatan peninsula. This includes the central and interior uplands located to the
east of the New River lagoon and extending north to the central portion of
Quintana Roo (Rice 1993).
CLIMATE
The general trend for geographic areas located to the south of the Tropic
of Cancer, including the Maya lowlands is reduced variation in seasonal
temperatures, with a relatively low range of temperatures both in the hot, humid
season as well as during the cooler dry season. Variation in precipitation across
the lowlands can be linked to the presence of the northeast trade winds and the
subtropical calms that influence local rainfall across the western Caribbean (Rice
1993: 18).
As Rice (1993: 18- 22) has described in detail, seasonal changes in the
earthâs orbit effect the sunâs migration path, with the formation of a belt of high
precipitation under the sunâs zenith. The belt of high precipitation shifts with the
season. Thus, when the thermal equator is located at itâs northern most point in
June, moisture laden trade winds rise and encounter equatorial calms, resulting in
rapid cooling and the loss of moisture in form of rain. In general, there is a
gradient of total rainfall that, like elevation above mean sea level, increases as one
moves from north to south across the lowlands. For example, the northwest corner
of the Yucatan averages little more than 50 cm of rain per year. In contrast,

31

eastern Honduras averages some 300 cm of rain per year. Southern Belize
illustrates this change even more clearly (Rice 1993: 19).
The tropical climes of the Maya lowlands, like the rest of Mesoamerica,
exhibit a well- defined wet and dry season. With January to May considered the
dry season and May to December normally the wettest times of the year, with a
short dry spell, usually occurring during July or August. In the north, vegetation
consists primarily of low evergreen forest and dry scrub. In contrast, the wetter
southern lowlands are blanketed with tropical rain forest, as well as both lowland
and upland pine ridge habitats. More specifically, the coastal plain of northern
Belize receives between 130 and 200 cm of rainfall annually (Lundell 1937;
Walker 1973). The region can be characterized as having a lowland tropical
climate with temperatures ranging from 10 to 35 degrees Celsius. A majority of
northern Belize is covered in tropical savanna vegetation and exhibits an average
annual rainfall of 180 cm (Wright et al. 1959). However, local variation in rainfall
patterns can be linked to local variation in topography (Rice 1993).
While there is significant variation in rainfall across the lowlands, there is
also considerable variation in quantity of rainfall from season to season. Seasonal
variation poses a risk for contemporary farmers in the lowlands, and no doubt the
same was true for farmers in antiquity. Yucatec Maya farmers still strictly adhere
to prescribed ritual in appealing to the Chaks, Maya gods of rain, to bring the
seasonal storms. However, periodic flooding can also be problematic in terms of
large shifts in regional rainfall patterns, as the entire lowlands are subject to
hurricanes arising in the Atlantic and moving unimpeded across the Caribbean.
As Rice (1993) and Dahlin (1983) have noted, shifts in climate are not
static and dissociated from terrestrial conditions. Terrestrial conditions that effect
modern climate also effected climate in antiquity. This includes absorption of
solar radiation. Changes in heat can be linked to climate changes. Variables such
32

as solar radiation, atmospheric composition, changes in land features (vegetation),
and water salinity can all be linked to climatic changes. This is also true of
changes in levels of lakes, oceans, seas, and rivers, as well as changes in
groundwater conditions, geomorphologic processes, as well as soil and vegetation
changes. These conditions are intertwined and a shift as one or multiple
conditions effects the entire system (Rice 1993: 22).
Rice (1993) posits a regional climatic model based on data collected by
members of the Central Peten Historical Geography Project. Both lake sediment
coring and tree ring data show an overall cooler and wetter local atmosphere for
the central Peten lakes district during the eighth century AD. However, changes in
micro- topography and conditions of the ground oftentimes both cover and create
variability in conditions across the landscape. Deforestation of a region increases
the ratio between light reflected from ground surface and light falling on that
particular surface. Overall, this increase reduces surface absorption of solar
energy, reducing local convective activity and rainfall, indicating that conditions
for changes in rainfall patterns may have ripe during the Terminal Classic and
into the Early Postclassic Periods (Rice 1993: 23).
Riceâs model suggests that during both the Early Classic and Early
Postclassic drier periods prevailed, with a cool/ wet interval occurring between
AD 600- AD 950 (Rice 1993: 22). The moderation of the limits of higher
temperatures resulted in a greater predictability for rainfall. This also was
associated with isostatic sea level rises along coastal Belize and Mexico as coastal
sites were submerged. As Pohl et al. (1990) have suggested, marine incursions
drowned the lower portion of the Rio Hondo in northern Belize during the Late
Preclassic, resulting in ponding and sedimentation of aboriginal wetland fields.
The loss of any inhabitable land was undoubtedly felt by Maya farming and craft
communities on the Belizean coastal plain. Such losses were perhaps part of a
33

larger cycle, within a cultural and historical context, of adaptation and changes
shaped by local and regional climatic and environmental dynamics.
GEOLOGY OF THE EASTERN LOWLANDS
The large limestone platform that comprises the Yucatan Peninsula and
the Maya lowlands exhibits significant variation in geological and mineralogical
substrate. The northern lowlands are underlain primarily by Cretaceous and
Tertiary carbonate rocks. Moving to the south, the Central Peten exhibits low,
anti- clinal ridges of Cretaceous to Miocene dolomitic limestones.

Moving

farther south, there is a gradual geological positioning of igneous rock that
extends to the base of the highlands.
Along the eastern coastal littoral, folded ranges of marine clastics and
limestone give way inland to older Paleozoic and Cenozoic metamorphic schist
and granites that, in part form the Maya Mountains. This gradual shift is
especially prevalent further west, along the northern edge of the volcanic ranges
of northern Central America, also recognized as the Maya highlands. Along the
southeast periphery of the lowlands, the Montagua fault exhibits highly broken
ground surface, steep slopes of deeply cut valleys oriented in a northeast to
southwest structural alignment. This region exhibits deep depressions and rugged
mountain ranges that climb to 2,500 m above sea level (Rice 1993; West 1964).
Located to the north of the Montagua fault are the Maya Mountains,
comprised primarily of granite, the substrate is a stark contrast to the limestones
of other portions of the lowlands. The substrate of the Maya mountains consists of
sandstone, marble, schist, and rhyolite which were used for masonry stone,
sculpture, ground stone implements. Jadeite and serpentine were also obtained
from this region. The Maya Mountains are comprised of both igneous and

34

metamorphic rock of Tertiary age and are uplifted along fault lines that extend
from between 800 and 1,000 m above sea level (see Shipley 1979).
To the north, the coastal plain of Belize, specific geological formation
processes are in dispute.

Maldonado- Koerdell (1964) stresses that regions

contour was anti- clinal and synclinal in origin, however faulting may have
resulted in the formation of conduits for both the New River and the Rio Hondo.
To reiterate, northern Belize is underlain by Tertiary and Cretaceous carbonates
(primarily limestone) with discontinuous or localized areas of Quaternary
alluvium (Johnson 1983).
Northern Belize saw the formation of a limestone solution and the creation
of what were to emerge as karstic surfaces during the late Miocene (Siemens
1978). The bedrock geology of northern Belize dates to the upper Tertiary, with
an Oligocene and Pliocene strata (Johnson 1983). Marl or sascab are classified as
Cayo marls and New River chalky marls (Wright et al. 1959). The origins of the
white chalky limestones were likely from a combination of three major processes:
1. silt deposited by riverine erosion from the Maya Mountains, 2. sediments
eroded from the Maya Mountains creating a coastal fan that subsequently
submerged, 3. shallow water deposition via the sea bed, 4. remnant of a deeply
weathered limestone (Johnson 1983).
The regional fault systems that trend from the northeast to the southwest
form the New River and Rio Hondo, which flow in fault guided basins (Johnson
1983). Within these folds are a series of scarps and intervening swales that exhibit
complex and dynamic geomorphology, especially in the north central portion of
the region, along the New River lagoon, which is adjacent to low rolling and hilly
limestone upland surfaces, and an intermediate bench from which local tributary
and distributary creeks are fed via runoff and seep springs (Hartshorn et al. 1984).
These streams flow across the fairly level lagoon basin.
35

The surface and

subsurface drainage of northern Belize contrasts markedly to the rest of the
Yucatan peninsula as water infiltrates directly in the ground water reservoir and
flows as surface runoff into streams and creeks.
CALCAREOUS SOILS OF NORTHERN BELIZE
What elevation there is along the eastern portion of the lowlands is
underlain with limestones and sascab, comprised primarily of fossils of calcified
marine mollusks and other species, gravels, and calcareous clays. In the northern
portion of the coastal plain Eocene and Miocene- Pliocene limestone, marl, and
gypsum extend from between 0- 40 m above sea level. Wright et al. (1959)
initially described the general distribution of soils, land use potential, and
vegetation cover of Belize, extending from the Rio Hondo in the north, west into
the Maya Mountains and the Vacca Plateau, and south to the Sarstoon River.
Wright et al. (1959) grouped soils within the principle land form features for each
region. The following discussion describes the main soil features of each
landform.

General descriptions of soils for northern Belize are presented,

focusing on the areas contiguous to each site of the three sites under consideration
in the present study.
Description of the soils associated with the region are derived from the
soils maps of northern Belize provided in Wright et al. (1959) and Hartshorn et al.
(1984). The soils associated with each site also exhibit some variability, but for
the most part fit the descriptions provided. Please note that each section also
contains soil series information. Perhaps the most critical goal of the discussion of
soils is to illustrate the natural occurrence of siliceous materials, which often
contain nodules of microcrystalline silicates quarried for the production of lithic
implements.

36

The Altun Ha and Rockstone Pond vicinity is part of the siliceous soils
adjacent to the lowland pine ridge (Hartshorn et al. 1984: 74). These soils exhibit
limestone outcrops with siliceous material and microcrystalline silicate more
prevalent in the northern portion of the pine ridge. Soils are part of the Rockstone,
Felipe, and Tok soil series. Soils of Rockstone series are mainly sandy clay
loams. Felipe and Tok soils commonly exhibit strongly leached sand topsoil
(Hartshorn et al.: 79).
Soils are considered to be low fertility with extensive rock outcroppings.
Located to the west of the lowland pine ridge, soils of the Puletan series
predominate. These soils are also characterized by calcritic clays and loams that
lack extensive limestone inclusions. The soils exhibit a clay hard pan some 2030 cm below the ground surface. This pan allows for surface water to collect in
perennial streams and numerous lagoons in the region (Hartshorn et al. 1984).
Overall, the area surrounding Altun Ha is comprised of siliceous material
with outcropping limestone. The parent materials are siliceous sediments
influenced by the presence of outcrops of hard limestones.

The siliceous

sediments have been deposited over either hard or soft calcareous materials. In
general, soils are less acidic and are filled with both calcium and magnesium.
The abundance of silica in the ancient geomorphologic system is indicated by the
common occurrence of chert in these soils (Hartshorn et al. 1984).
Clearly the soils near Colha, part of what has been termed the Jobo series,
exhibit extensive subsurface chert nodules as well as chert outcrops. The
inhabitants of Colha constructed their town on some of the richest chert bearing
soils in the region. The soils exhibit hard siliceous limestones and nodules of
microcrystalline silicates. The Jobo series soils are characterized as low in
fertility with internal drainage. Local soils are somewhat deep. However, poor
subsoil drainage causes frequent flooding of lowland areas. Topsoils are
37

comprised of gray brown sandy clay loams. These are located over compact and
plastic sandy clay subsoil (Hartshorn et al. 1984).
Located to the west, Lamanai is also part of the calcareous soils of the
northern Belize lowlands. The area exhibits upland elevation and alluvial
deposition adjacent to the New River Lagoon, along the western shore of the
lagoon. Moreover, the Ramgoat series are described as calcareous soils. But there
is little evidence that nodules of quality chert are present in this area. The soils of
the Ramgoat series are located primarily along the upland areas adjacent to the
lagoon and are subject to periodic flooding. Adjacent to the soils of the lagoon
basin, upland soils are quite rocky and are not subjected to periodic inundation.
These upland soils originated from Miocene age limestones and some volcanic
ash. They are associated with the Yaxa/ Pulucax series. Soils are characterized as
stony, shallow, and are phosphorous deficient (Hartshorn et al. 1984: 77). In
general, soils that occur across the northern coastal plain are partially cemented
limestone conglomerates and dull plastic clays.
In the lagoonâs basin proper, reddish brown, moderately plastic clays of
moderate depth, are most prevalent. Along the basin of the New River Lagoon,
soils are derived primarily from alluvium and colluvium that overlay marl and
limestone. In general, these soils appear as dark gray sand or sandy clays with
mottled subsoil.
The surfaces of the lowland coastal plain were formed by the continuous
deposition of alluvium on top of calcareous limestones. The primary source of the
calcareous material are the rocks and soils of the Maya Mountains and upland
pine ridge, located to the west and south (see Wright et al. 1959). Contemporary
and cumulative geomorphological processes across the coastal plain were likely
active throughout the Quaternary. In some places more than 25 m of alluvium are
present over the limestone.

Materials appear to have been transported and
38

deposited in shallow water. Remnant surfaces along the uplands in the region
indicate that there was also intermittent intrusion of the sea and a re- deposition of
materials. The redistribution and reformation of these materials has resulted in a
hard packed and relatively non- porous surface across the lowlands (Johnson
1983: 19).
Generally speaking, coral rubble and calcareous sand, kaolinitic clay
mixed with coral sand and marl, in tandem with presence of extensive silica in the
form of quartz sand and silica gels or soluble silica are all present in the soils of
the coastal plain (Hartshorn et al. 1984) These soils produced the silicified
limestone beds of the eastern portion of the coastal plain, in the area recognized
as the chert bearing zone (Cackler et al. 1999; Hartshorn et al. 1984: 77; Shafer
and Hester 1983, 1991; Tobey 1986; Wright et al. 1959). The various soil
compositions have been formed by both marine and river deposits overlaying in
some places, and permeating the limestone substrate. The formation of soils on
the coastal plain occurred in conjunction with colluvial and alluvial deposition.
The process of filling numerous depressions in the area resulted in complex local
soil sequences. The presence of nine sub- units is indicative of the heterogeneity
of soils (Hartshorn et al. 1984: 78).
Because the accumulation of alluvium is a long term and discontinuous
process, the soils in different locations on the plain show variation in age and
sequence. The most recently deposited soils, where accumulations of fresh
alluvium still occur, exhibit the highest fertility. On the other hand, in soils that
were deposited much earlier, the process of leaching and clay translocation have
produced soils with very high acid content, possessing few nutrients and
exhibiting a clay pan that restricts percolation of water through the subsoil
(Johnson 1983). Long- term soil processes have altered the siliceous early
material, forming soils that are nearly all quartz and sand overlaying compact
39

kaolinitic clay (Johnson 1983). During heavy rains, soils located above the clay
pan are flooded and the quartz grains flow downslope, in the dry season the soils
dry out and the clay pan bakes to a very hard surface. The flow of perched water
moves quartz from high to low points (soil creep) that is gradually leveling the
surface of the plain and influencing the development of low terraces.
Apart from the cohune, riparian, and mangrove forests that cover the
northern Belize coastal plain, pine savanna characterizes a large portion of the
landscape, and is designated lowland pine ridge. In the lowland pine ridge, soils
are distinct from surrounding areas. The pine ridge is underlain by clayey and
siliceous soils located across the coastal plain of northern Belize and do not
exhibit outcrops of limestone or nodules of microcrystalline silicate.

The

majority of soils in this flat sub- unit are of low or very low nutrient status, with
fertile and moderately fertile soils adjacent to the main river systems. Soils of the
lowland pine ridge located also belong to the extensive Puletan soil series
(Johnson 1983).
The agricultural record along the coastal plain of northern Belize is both
rich and ancient (see Jacob 1991, 1995; Jones 1994 for an in depth discussion of
ancient Maya agriculture at Colha and along the margins of Cobweb swamp; also
Turner and Harrison 1983).

Like the Maya and Creole village farmers that

presently occupy portions of the northern coastal plain of Belize, the ancient
Maya no doubt concentrated agriculture on the upland limestone soils of the
rolling and hilly landscapes. There is evidence for intensive agriculture to the
south, along the Belize River and in the Vacca Plateau for extensive terrace
networks of the foothill slopes, and raised fields in valley bottoms. Extensive
wetland agriculture, where soil fertility could be altered and enhanced by trapping
alluvial deposits and organic sediments between interlocking series of dikes and

40

weirs, is highly visible along the margins of swamps and rivers of the northern
Belize (Jacob 1991).
Agricultural intensification required organization and cooperation. These
activities were no doubt carefully planned in advance. Yet after the ancient
inhabitants no longer possessed the motivation for the construction of large
centers, and in the case of northern Belize, the intensive production of lithic
implements, communal agricultural activities also lapsed and food production
returned to level of individual and family milpas (after AD 900). According to
Spanish documentation small family and group settlements were located from
between 30-50km apart. These small settlements were farmed in traditional
methods with a diffuse pattern of land usage. Despite rapid and wholesale cultural
changes over time, the continuity of farming methods continues in some areas to
the present day.
FLORAL AND FAUNAL RESOURCES
The following brief discussion presents a broad overview of the
composition of floral and faunal resources present on the coastal plain of northern
Belize. The discussion will not attempt to identify and describe all of the plant
and animal species utilized by the ancient Maya. This would take a dissertation
length report in its own right. Instead, the discussion will provide a generalized
description of local habitats that, while certainly altered through time, support
particular species utilized in a variety of ways by human communities living in
the region. It is important to note that many of these species clearly influenced the
worldview of these communities, as manifest in art and iconography. Indeed,
flaked stone symbols from the region often take the form of serpents,
crocodilians, mammals, amphibians, and a variety of supernatural creatures that
exhibit elements from several different animal species.

41

The vegetation of the northern Belize lowlands could be broadly
characterized as tropical broadleaf forests interspersed with stands of pine
savanna. Microenvironmental variation can be linked to heterogeneity of the
calcareous soils in the region. The Maya lowlands possess several hundred
species of mixed soft and hardwoods, including the mahogany (Swietenia
macrophylla) and the sapote (Achras zapota). Distinct floral communities are
present within the broadleaf forest in northern Belize. This includes both inland
and coastal marsh and swamp communities, cohune palm forest, and pine ridge
areas. The lowland areas exhibit species segregation based on both soil
heterogeneity as well as the amount of moisture contained in specific soils (Rice
1993).
Broadleaf climax forests are present on well- drained soil, with
intermittent areas of subclimax forests. The rain forest is part of mesophytic
deciduous species that exhibits three mature tree stories with microenvironments
below the forest canopy. Along the eastern Peten, ramonal, sapodilla, vitex,
cecropia, and burseria are part of the broadleaf quasi- rain forest. These flourish
on fertile, well- drained soils and in the present day are indicative to farmers of
the presence of productive land (Rice 1993: 25). Along the bajos of the eastern
Peten and northern Belize, cohune and plamaceae species differ substantially
from upland habitats, with dry periods alternating with periodic inundation
(Darch 1983).
Savanna and grasslands, known as the lowland pine ridge, exhibit minimal
soil development and thus subclimax forests. Moreover, soil degeneration
contributes to the formation of grasslands, which contain perennials that demand
few nutrient requirements. Xerophytic trees and shrubs are mixed with wetland
grasses. These live only during the wet season. The overall biomass of the
savannas is low, thus few indications of human occupation. These clearings are
42

not the result of deforestation, but instead from edaphic factors in which grasses
colonize hydromorphic soils, primarily comprised of red brown oxisols through
the Holocene Epoch (Rice 1993).
The spatial diversity of tropical forest takes the form of a mosaic,
determined by topography, soil fertility, and soil moisture. The vertical
orientation of the biomass, from the canopy to the ground, indicates that
procurement must be spatially diffuse. The organizational character of the
lowland tropical forest can impede human exploitation. However, by the Classic
Period, broadleaf forests were not pristine, but highly shaped by human action,
namely agriculture and other forms of resource procurement (Rice 1993: 26). This
includes both domesticated and semi- domesticated plant and animal species.
Faunal species also profoundly influenced the character of human exploitation of
resources in the region. Voorhies (1982) has identified 150 plant species of plants
and twenty- five animal species that were utilized by ancient Maya communities
(Rice 1993: 26; Voorhies 1982). The exploitation of the broadleaf forest plant and
animal communities provided a host of resources for use. These include dyes,
fibers, food, fuel, incense, medicine, oils, pelts, plumage, jewelry, and other
goods.
It is clear that temperate forest succeeded xeric Pleistocene vegetation and
mesic forests that date to 10,000 years in age. By the time human communities
were establishing village cultures during the Early Preclassic, humans began
unfettered alteration of both abiotic and biotic portions of the ecosystem.
Paleoecological data indicates that by Late Classic times in the central and eastern
Peten and northern Belize, the landscape was denuded (Jones 1994; Rice 1993).
Deforestation, intensive agriculture, abandonment, and succession are indicated
by pollen deposition. Beginning in the Late Classic (AD 600), overall pollen
presence in core samples is low compared to other time frames. Data from
43

Cobweb Swamp indicate that forest clearance for agriculture is evident by the
Classic Period. By the Late Classic, it is apparent that the lowland landscape was
very nearly cleared. The majority of pollen can be linked to agriculture and open
grasslands and low levels of arboreal pollen (Jacob 1991; Jones 1994).
Not only were productive lands needed for agriculture, arboreal species
were needed for fuel. Rice (1993) estimates that an individual might consume one
ton of fuel wood per year. Wood was not only needed for making implements and
fuel for cooking, but also building perishable structures. The strain between the
necessity of land for crop and trees for fuel was felt by burgeoning local
populations. This is well illustrated from palynological data recovered from
Cobweb Swamp adjacent to Colha and also areas near the center of Copan in
western Honduras (Jacob 1991; Jones 1994; Rice 1993). The Copan data indicates
that montane forests, which are not productive, were stripped of arboreal species.
Lake beds are also a source of paleoecological data that exhibit a thick layer of
silty, montmorillonite clays that indicate an increase in alluvium and colluvium,
which are reflective of long term human disturbance.
LITHOLOGY OF NORTHERN BELIZE AND THE CHERT- BEARING ZONE
The coastal plain of northern Belize has been identified by archaeologists
as possessing critical lithic resources necessary for the production of both
utilitarian implements and symbols by the ancient Maya communities that lived
there. Human occupation in the region dates to some 8,000 BC, and stone was
used from those times onward (Iceland 1997; Kelly 1993; MacNeish et al. 1980).

45

The chert- bearing zone, defined in Chapter One as an 85 km by 30 km area,
exhibits a wealth of microcrystalline silicate rocks occurring in the form of
subsurface nodules and outcropping along the low cohune ridges. While high
quality chert is present in the heart of the cbz, which extends in a north- south line
from the site of Colha extending to just south of Altun Ha, more coarse textured
chalcedonies are prevalent in the northwest and western portions of the cbz.
Generally speaking, cherts and chalcedonies occur widely but intermittently
across the landscape.
Overall, a patchy distribution of materials in terms of color, grain, nodule
form and size were used to determine the quality of the material for reduction by
the lithic crafters at Colha (Potter 1993, Tobey 1986). This variable quality and
overall intermittent distribution of lowland cherts acted as a bounding mechanism
in the formation of economies based on the production and exchange of flaked
lithic materials (Potter 1993).
While trace element sourcing of chert can provide clues in terms of the
location of specific materials, visual distinction can be made with some success at
a general level (see Cackler et al. 1999; Iceland 1997; Tobey 1986). Numerous
researchers have posed the question of where high quality chert originates within
the cbz region. Tobey (1986) undertook an initial trace element characterization
of cherts recovered from different portions of the cbz. Tobey obtained mixed
results when attempting to elucidate consistent differences in trace element
composition from area within the cbz. What was established, and later supported
by Cackler et al. (1999) was that raw material from the cbz can be considered, at
least in terms of trace element composition, a homogenous area (Cackler et al.
1999; Tobey 1986).
At the site of Colha, quarries have been identified in close proximity to the
site. At these quarries, chert occurs in nodules are as large as one meter in
46

diameter. Often times, tabular cherts can be up to 50 cm thick. This material
exhibits excellent quality for production of large macroblades and macro flakeblades. Regionally, these macroblades were bifacially reduced into tool forms.
Cherts range in colors from dark brown and tan brown to gray and also banded
gray materials (Tobey 1986; Shafer and Hester 1983, 1991).
The chert- bearing zone was first mapped by Wright et al. (1959). Chert is
comprised of some 98.0 % silica. Chert is defined as an opaque stone exhibiting a
wide range of colors and is a sort of cover term for a number of sedimentary
rocks, including: agate, jasper, and chalcedony (Tobey 1986: 8). Chert is also
known as flint, although in general, chert is a more heterogeneous material than
flint. Both materials yield sharp edges when fractured and possess isotropic
fracturing properties that yield consistent breakage patterns. There are a number
of competing theories to explain the formation of chert. One theory is known as
syngenesis, in which gelatinous silica lumps accumulated on the sea floor and
were surrounded by accumulating sea- bed and soils. A second is labeled
penecontemporaneous formation. This theory posits that silica accumulated below
the sea floor in deeper environments where materials were undergoing geological
transformation. A third, called the epigenetic theory of chert formation, suggests
that microcrystalline silicate formed after the ocean floor had emerged above
water level and was part of a larger deposition of silica into voids in the limestone
(Luedtke 1992: 17- 20).
Chert Formation
Archaeologists working in the coastal plain of northern Belize have
traditionally been interested in both the source of the cherts and the properties of
different kinds of chert.

As discussed previously, chert is a term that

encompasses microcrystalline silicates of various colors, grains, and inclusions.

47

However, chert classification cannot be limited to geography or quality. The
problem is in its variability. Chert from the same quarry can exhibit extreme
differences in both visible properties and trace element composition. As Tobey
(1986) Iceland (1997) and Cackler et al. (1999) discovered, that while there is
significant variability in the cherts from northern Belize, overall homogeneity is
most prevalent.
Silica also takes the form of what is termed chalcedony, a silicate that
takes the form of strings rather than crystals. Chalcedony is of less quality than
chert and is most prevalent along the northwestern and western boundaries of the
chert- bearing zone. Mineralogically, chalcedony is similar to chert, thus being
sometimes translucent. Chalcedony is considered to be a fibrous form of quartz
that appears differently, even though in some instances it is comprised of the
same material.
Chert classifications can be divided into two primary groups, chert type
that refers to a discrete geologic deposit, and chert source, a regional location
where a type of chert can be obtained. Chert can be classified as a sedimentary
rock comprised of combination of specific chemical elements known as minerals.
Chert is a naturally forming solid formed by inorganic processes. The end result is
an ordered internal arrangement of atoms and chemical compounds whose
physical properties are relatively fixed (Luedtke 1992).
Chert is comprised primarily of the mineral quartz, comprised of silicon
and oxygen. Rocks are aggregates of different mineral. For example granite is
comprised of quartz and feldspar, mica, amphibole, and pyroxene. Chert is a rock
made up of grains of mineral quartz, considered to be sedimentary in origin that
were formed at low temperatures and pressures at the earthâs surface (Luedtke
1992). Silica minerals come in a number of size ranges. The mineral crystal
appears like a six- sided needle with a pyramid on top. Chert is comprised of
48

microcrystalline quartz, meaning its crystals are visible under high power
magnification. The quartz crystals are then modified by water, clay, carbonate
minerals, iron minerals, and organic materials that result in an internal structure of
great variability.
The silica tetrahedron is the foundation of chert. However, chert is not a
homogeneous solid mass, but instead is comprised of particles and varies with the
bonds that exist between the particles. In northern Belize, chert comprises less
than 2% of the volume of sedimentary rock (Tobey 1986).
The numerous inclusions in chert were determined by solubility, meaning
how the mineral absorbs water and impurities. Quartz crystals absorb water at six
parts per million and amorphous silica at 120 parts per million. Microcrystalline
quartz is comprised of interlocking grains. The material precipitates six parts per
million from other solutions. Compared to chalcedony, the impurities in chert
slow down precipitation.
The size of individual quartz grains are linked to the fracture properties of
individual types of chert. Fracturing properties are affected by variables such as:
the density of nucleation sites, rate of crystal growth, and temperature. The
quantity of impurities in the matrix of the chert has repercussions for how the
material fractures. Smaller grain sizes are, for the most part, in closer proximity to
fossil inclusions. Also smaller grains form near organic material. However, coarse
grained cherts form where there are not many impurities suitable to act as
nucleation sites. Moreover, the impurities form lower silica concentrations. Grain
size variation in a single chert nodule can be explained by the tendency of chert to
grow from the inside out (Luedtke 1992: 24).
There are a number of conditions that effect the formation of different
kinds of silica. These include low temperatures, silica concentrations, quantity
and kinds of impurities appear to be the most important determinants of the type
49

of silica that will form. For the most part, microcrystalline silicate concentrations
are relatively low and impurities are abundant. The more pure crystals, the longer
it takes to form, due to no impurities acting as nucleation sites.
Perhaps the most relevant theory for the explanation of chert formation is
a theory called diagenesis. Diagenesis occurred where low temperatures and lowpressure changes are working on sediments prior to lithification (Luedtke 1996:
25). The compaction, cementation, alteration, and replacement are processes that
are important to the formation of different cherts. Moreover, as the present study
shows, chemical alteration and changes in the fabric of the chert can occur via
surface alteration, as well as variation in the environment in which the materials
was culturally deposited. However, as Luedtke (1992) has so aptly noted, there is
a significant gap between the chemical changes of chert formation and our own
empirical observations.
Nodular cherts, comprised of spheres or lumpy ovals of limestone or
dolomite formation are the form in which many cherts in northern Belize take.
However, nodular cherts comprise a very small proportion of such formations and
are areally very limited (Dapples 1979: 100). Nodular chert forms when silica and
carbonates are exposed to long term temperature and water variation. Moreover,
these materials are also exposed to carbonate secreting organisms. This forms
limestone, which is also suitable for silica secretors. Silica can then be deposited
in the voids left by dissolving carbonates. These deposits appear in quiet shallow
seas. In the process, chert forms early in diagenesis, when carbonates are
compact, but remain unsolidified (Luedtke 1992).
Carbonates containing chert are oftentimes located where fresh and salt
water mix at the margins of large land forms, where silica deposition often occurs.
These also form bedded cherts, which are not part of the microcrystalline silicate

50

sources in northern Belize. However, outcrops along cohune ridges may exhibit
tapering lenses of chert material.
The impurities in chert are responsible for the visible characteristics of the
material. Impurities originate from a variety of sources such as rocks, sediment,
and organic remains. The remains of clays, carbonates, iron oxides, and organic
matter create variation in color and texture of chert. The impurities often appear
to be inside the fabric of the quartz grains, but instead form around and in the
voids that are present between the quartz crystals. Impurities also stem from the
minerals that are present in the area of silica deposition, including clays or sand
grains or bits of organic material, as well as other minerals such as pyrite,
hematite, dolomite, and clays that form in place (Luedtke 1992: 36).
Also contributing to chert diagenesis are the kinds of rock present on
adjacent landforms, which affect chert formation via the processes of transporting
sediments to nearby bodies of water. Moreover, the kinds of flora and fauna that
occupied the waters where chert was formed also affect the appearance and
structure of chert. Volcanic ash also adds to the complexity of chert diagenesis
and the formation of chert fabrics.
Visual Properties of Chert
Chert can potentially appear in every color of the spectrum as well as
numerous patterns from solid to banding. Chert is also variable in luster from
glossy to opaque. Quartz is the major constituent of chert, impurities and
microstructure variation cause differences between kinds of chert. Assessing
quality of chert via visible properties is a subjective process but can be done.
Anthropologically, the visible properties of chert likely had ideological and
aesthetic significance. The knowledge of quality lithic material was important to
local craft communities in northern Belize. The crafters possessed an intimate

51

knowledge of raw material and visible and subjective properties were part of the
criteria for judging quality. Thus a crafter would be familiar with local and distant
chert types (Luedtke 1992: 59).
Visual properties include color, translucency, luster, texture, and structure.
These properties are linked to structural properties of the material that affect how
light behaves when exposed to the surface of the material. In general, the
materials from northern Belize are opaque. Coloration of material is also
subjective. By using Munsell standards of soil colors including hue, value, and
chroma. Texture is often related to grain size. This is not necessarily the case in
the sense that most often grains of the silica are more often not visible to the
naked eye. Even the largest grains are 0.05 mm in diameter. Texture instead is a
function of chert porosity and fluctuates with the number and size of the cavities
between grains making the material appear coarse (Luedtke 1996). Subjective
typologies of chert texture have proven useful for distinguishing between chert
types based on feel and appearance (Rick 1978: 15).
The more porous a material is, the more coarse grained it appears. The
coarseness is based on presence or absence of clusters of quartz grains or
replacement of fossils. Indeed, in the present study, chert texture is ranked
according to four separate classifications. The fracturing properties of chert are a
function grain size. The more coarse the material, a specific fracture will go
around the grain clusters.
Color changes in chert include mottling and splotching. Mottling of
material is what has been termed a replacement phenomenon in which the
structure of the chert surface begins to take on the structure of the surrounding
material. In the case of the materials from northern Belize, the surrounding matrix
is limestone, which appears as both mottled and exhibiting fossil inclusions
(Luedtke 1992: 66).

Oolitic cherts are materials that formed from marine
52

environments and the agitation of carbonate sediments. Many chert contain
numerous fossils, indeed tiny animal and plant fossils are part of the chert itself,
comprised of bits of limestone and dolomite which are relics of the original
sediments.
As well, remnant quartz grains that are outside the fabric of the quartz can
effect the appearance of the chert. These variables have repercussions for the
appearance of the chert. Oftentimes, chert exhibits concentric banding, as is the
case in northern Belize. This phenomenon can be attributed to layers of silica
deposited on the interior initial nodule. This banding can also be caused by
diagenesis rather than from depositional processes. Voids in the chert are often
filled with chalcedony.
Another critical component of chert is the cortex, which is often defined as
the outer layer over the nodule or a weathered area. Cortex is a diagenetic feature
distinctive surface layer in the nodule or bed. The weathered layer that accrues
after breakage is different, and is known as patination. This is the case with the
materials in the present study, where long- term deposition has resulted in
weathering. Patination is often chemically in between chert and cortex (Luedtke
1992).
Chalcedony also appears quite frequently in the matrix, and is common in
many cherts. The fibrous structures are short thick bundles and long thin ones.
The fibers radiate out from the surface or form spheres around nucleation sites.
Chalcedony also fills cracks, voids, or fossils and may also cement quartz grains
in the body of the chert.
Correlation among various visible properties can be definitive in
articulating a chert type. Impurities and grain size, as discussed previously cause
the visible properties of chert. In the present study, chert texture was graded from
one to four. Color was assessed based on a loose association with Munsell Color
53

Chart. The presence of inclusions were noted, though attempts to define the
inclusions as caused by inorganic and (or) organic material was not undertaken. A
caveat must be articulated at this point, in the sense that not all visible properties
of chert are equally variable within a chert type.
It is not always true that highly local cherts vary less than widespread.
However, recent research has indicated that all chert bearing zone chert should be
viewed as one homogeneous chert type (Cackler et al. 1999; Iceland 1997; Tobey
1986). Color, for instance is important but not definitive. Texture is also
important in that it is linked to mechanical properties. When combined with
presence of inclusions, it is posited that these visible properties can discern at
least that notion of a single production locus for flaked stone symbols from Altun
Ha, Colha, and Lamanai.
Chert occurs at Colha and across the cbz as nodules varying in size from
several centimeters to over meter across. These nodules are mixed in the
limestones and soil. Some of the cherts also outcrop on the ground surface as
opaque to slightly translucent and varied in color as mottled grays, browns, and
some reds. These materials also exhibit both banding and fossil inclusions. Many
of the cherts originating from northern Belize contained fossils visible in fabric
the fabric of the chert. These often appear as circular white specks ranged in
diameter from 0.1mm to 1.0 cm (Tobey 1986). There are also larger oval
inclusions that contain chalcedenous material. It is unknown whether these voids
were where fossil skeletons were located. However, the presence and appearance
of fossil inclusions provides subjective criteria for description of specific cherts.
Chert quality was not the most important factor in the manufacture of
stone implements. Maya lithic crafters used a wide variety of poor quality
material, and produced intricate and excellent work. Other variables that were
likely considered include the shape of the core, how the material is held, how it is
54

struck, type of hammer, and preparation of the striking platform all affected how a
piece of stone was worked. Moreover, availability, size, aesthetic and ideological
considerations all had to be considered when selecting a piece of material that
was to be crafted. Crabtree (1972) articulated the notion that the way chert breaks
is the critical criteria. The properties a lithic crafter is looking may have included
even texture and free of flaws, cracks, inclusions, cleavage planes, and grains
(Crabtree 1972). What makes chert useful mechanically is its isotropic fracturing
properties. These can often be improved via thermal alteration. The gradual
heating and cooling of chert enhances the uniformity of the breakage pattern.
Generally speaking, there is no consensus in how chert types are defined.
Typologies are always arbitrary (Luedtke 1992). The question remains what kind
of typologies can we construct in terms of raw material, and for what is that
typology useful? Provenance studies in northern Belize have taken two
approaches. The first has been the construction of a typology of chert artifacts
based on geographic locations of sites (Boxt and Reedy 1985). Perhaps more
definitive are the petrographic and chemical techniques employed by Tobey
(1986) and Cackler et al. (1999). According to the latter study, it seems clear that
banded brown and gray cherts originated from Colha. However, large source
areas to the north of Altun Ha pose the question of similar material originating
there.
It has been concluded that a great deal of chemical homogeneity exists
within the chert- bearing zone. Distinctions cannot be made chemically between
geographic areas within the area. Attempts to chemically differentiate between
sources within the chert- bearing zone have been met with mixed results. Instead
the present study does not attempt to isolate individual sources, but instead poses
the question of whether there is sufficient variability in the visible properties of
the material to consider that materials originated from two or more source areas.
55

CONCLUDING REMARKS
This chapter has presented a description of the environmental context
relevant for the analysis of three assemblages of flaked stone symbols recovered
from ancient Maya sites in northern Belize. The technological knowledge
controlled by the lithic crafters demanded an intimate knowledge of both the
material with which they were working, as well as the location where the material
was available, as well as the placement of the material in their worldview. In this
sense, it is critical that we too have an understanding of the environmental context
in which this knowledge was displayed. In doing so, we can generate relevant
questions with respect to the access and use of resources, and how this access
shaped the historical trajectories of Maya society, as well as the production of
material symbols. In this way I have constructed my analysis, reflexing between
interpretive and positivist modes of thought, cobbling together a study of material
culture that brings the widest possible perspective to the study of flaked stone
technology and the communities that, while practicing it, transformed themselves.

Chapter 3: Archaeological and Culture
History in Northern Belize
This chapter is divided into two parts. The first presents a discussion of
previous archaeological research in northern Belize, briefly reviewing research
that has been undertaken in the central and eastern portions of the region,
primarily along the coastal plain. The second part is devoted to presenting a
culture history for each of the three centers from which the assemblages of flaked
stone symbols originate. Though this dissertation presents the results of a material
culture analysis of flaked stone symbols recovered from three primary sites in the
region, it is critical to understand the history of archaeology in the area and the
accumulation of knowledge stemming from previous work. Information contained
in this chapter will set the stage for Chapter Four, which is comprised of a
discussion of craft specialization and ancient Maya political- economic
organization.
Archaeological research in northern Belize has contributed to our current
knowledge of eastern lowland Maya culture and architectural histories, site
organization, ceramic and lithic chronology, and socioeconomies of lithic
production, craft specialization, and exchange. One of the goals of this chapter is
to present this study in archaeological context, drawing on results of previous
work to position the present analysis of a class of ancient Maya material culture.
ARCHAEOLOGICAL HISTORY
The first modern exploration of ancient Maya sites in northern Belize was
undertaken by Thomas Gann at the turn of the 20th century. Gann, a physician by
trade, visited a number of sites in northern Belize during the first decade of the
century. While Gann employed excavation methods acceptable at the time, much

57

of his work was based on less than systematic methodology. Gann visited the site
of Santa Rita Corazol on Chetumal Bay and trenched numerous buildings at that
site (Chase and Chase 1988). Gann also excavated at the site of Lamanai, as
evidenced by the large open trenches in the structure adjacent to and just north of
the historic period church (Pendergast 1981, 1993). Though Gann's work was
important in the sense that it resulted in the formal documentation of
archaeological sites in the region, his reports of both excavations and material
culture leave much to be desired. Gann took few notes and primarily documented
only items of elite or exotic origin (see Gann 1900, 1927).
Despite the presence of numerous Maya centers along the coastal plain of
northern Belize, archaeological work there waned for most of the first half of the
20th century. During the second decade of the century, Alfred Tozzer (1913) led a
research party via mule train from the Caribbean coast into the interior of Belize
(then British Honduras) and along the Guatemalan border. Sylvanus Morley of
the Carnegie Institution spent a short amount of time at the site of La Honradez,
in eastern Guatemala in 1915. In the 1920âs and 30âs J.E.S. Thompson also
visited the site of La Honradez and spent three seasons excavating at the site of
San Jose, in western Belize. Thompson also visited the sites of Lamanai and La
Milpa, eventually naming the site of La Milpa during this time period. But even
as the Carnegie Institution began a long term archaeological project to the west in
the central Peten, at the site of Uaxactun, and in the northern lowlands at Chichen
Itza during the 1920âs and 1930âs, little archaeological work was undertaken at
sites in northern Belize (see also Wauchope 1934; Smith 1937, 1955).
In the decades following, changes in archaeological method and theory as
practiced in the New World began to be felt in the Maya area. These changes
were initiated in part by subsequent historical and political changes in geopolitical
arrangements, as well as changes within the discipline of archaeology itself
58

(Trigger 1990; Willey and Sabloff 1995). The shift from a primarily culture
historical approach to a focus on explanations of cultural continuity and change
was embodied perhaps most clearly in the publication of two texts in North
America. The first was Walter Taylorâs A Study of Archaeology (1967), which set
the stage for interdisciplinary research to become an accepted part of
archaeological investigation. The second text, Method and Theory in American
Archaeology (1952) authored by Gordon Willey and Phillip Phillips, stressed
explanations based on accretive and processual changes in culture via systematic
archaeological sampling and classification.
Early in the 1950âs, one of the authors of the latter text, Gordon Willey of
Harvard University, initiated pioneering settlement survey and excavation in the
Belize Valley in cooperation with a number of colleagues (Willey et al. 1965). At
the same time, in the central Peten, the University Museum of the University of
Pennsylvania initiated a comprehensive and long- term archaeological research
project at Tikal (Coe 1990; Coe and Haviland 1982; Coggins 1975; Fry and Cox
1974; Fry 1979; Haviland 1981, 1989; Jones 1991; Puleston 1983; Shook et al.
1958). These projects represent a critical part of the foundation of our knowledge
of the ancient lowland Maya.
The Tikal Project included not only excavations in the monumental center
and investigations of elite material culture, but also focused on site settlement,
organization, and non- elite material culture (Haviland 1981; Moly- Nagy 1998;
Puleston 1983). Moreover, interpretations of stone sculpture and hieroglyphic
inscriptions provided local and regional histories of the ruling dynasty (Coggins
1975; see also Schele and Freidel 1990). The Tikal Project showed that the
organization and history of a Maya center could be approached from a number of
avenues of inquiry. The work at Tikal and in the Belize Valley motivated
continued efforts and subsequent innovations in theory, interpretation, and
59

methodology. And yet despite increased research efforts across the Maya
lowlands, northern Belize had yet to be the focus of systematic archaeological
inquiry.
It may have been common knowledge to local Yucatec Maya villagers that
numerous sites existed in the region prior to the 20th century and generations later,
when archaeologists first appeared there. A.H. Anderson, the first archaeological
commissioner of British Honduras visited numerous sites in the region during the
late 1950âs and 1960âs. In 1961, American William Bullard of the Royal Ontario
Museum accompanied Anderson to Altun Ha. During that year, Bullard directed
excavations at the site of San Estevan, located some 35km to the northwest of
Altun Ha and some 15km northwest of Colha. At the time, Bullard recorded Altun
Ha as the site of Rockstone Pond, the name of the nearby Creole village.
In 1963, Anderson again visited the site of Altun Ha, this time with David
Pendergast, then of the University of Utah. During the fall of that year, three
weeks of test excavations were undertaken at the site. The following year,
Pendergast returned to Altun Ha under the auspices of the Royal Ontario
Museum. As Pendergast (1979: 1) so aptly states:
The original rationale for the project was simply that the coastal
zone of Belize was terra incognita, long held to be sort of a
peripheral backwater in which nothing of great significance to
Maya prehistory had occurred.
This preconception about the region was soon proven by the Altun Ha
project to be in error. What followed were seven field and one lab season that
revealed Altun Ha, renamed from the original Rockstone Pond by Pendergast, as
one of the richest sites in terms of the diversity of elite material culture, excavated
to date in the eastern lowlands. During field work at Altun Ha, Pendergast worked

60

with Mopan and Yucatec Maya excavators from the village of Succotz, Cayo
District, Belize as well as numerous North American specialists in architecture,
ceramics, floral and faunal resources, and eventually lithic artifacts (see
Pendergast 1979, 1982, 1990, 1992, 1998).
The excavations at Altun Ha set the stage for further archaeological
investigation in northern Belize, and indeed in Belize as a whole. Over the course
of the next three decades, numerous archaeological projects were established in
northern Belize. The Corazol Project was the first regional archaeological survey
undertaken in northern Belize (see Hammond 1973). Excavation and survey were
also undertaken by Hammond and his colleagues at the site of Nohmul, along the
Rio Hondo (Hammond 1983). The Corazol Project, which was conducted under
the auspices of the British Museum, was an early manifestation of a regional
settlement study that was to become so prevalent in the Maya area during the
1980âs and 1990âs (see Ashmore 1981). The project documented the locations of
numerous sites in the region, including the large- scale remnants of lithic
production at the site of Colha (Wilk 1973, 1976).
Observations at Colha motivated Hammond, whose research focus was not
lithic technology, to contact researchers at the University of Texas at San Antonio
and Texas A&M University. In 1976, Thomas R. Hester and Harry J. Shafer,
accompanied by New World lithic technologist Don Crabtree and other North
American researchers visited Colha. After a visit of several days, this group
concluded that Colha was an important site in terms of production of lithic
implements. Indeed, Crabtree suggested that Colha was one of the most important
archaeological sites in the New World in terms of understanding lithic technology
in a complex society setting (Hester 1985). Thus, the Colha Project was initiated
under a research focus that encompassed the production and economy of lithic

61

tool forms (see Hester and Hammond 1976; Hester 1979; Hester et al. 1981,
1982, 1994).
Hammond also directed excavations at another small but important site,
located just west of Orange Walk Town in northern Belize. The site of Cuello was
a small site with intact deposits and ceramics that dated to the early part of the
Middle Preclassic (900 BC- 400 BC). This early ceramic complex known as
Swasey hinted at habitation by people that practiced an early form of Maya
village culture (see Hammond 1991). At the same time excavations were being
undertaken at Cuello, the Colha Project and Regional Survey was initiating
excavation and mapping at this relatively small but economically important site
(see Hester 1979; Hester et al. 1981, 1982, 1994). While excavations at Colha
will be discussed in more detail below, it must be noted that the regional survey
resulted in the location of over a dozen smaller sites, many of which were
involved to some degree in production of lithic implements from locally available
chert resources (Gibson 1982; Kelly 1982; Kelly and Valdez 1979; Meadows
1997; Shafer 1982a).
During the ensuing twelve field and lab seasons at Colha, North American
and Belizean excavators documented over 100 lithic workshop deposits and
numerous associated domestic structures. They also generated a complete site
map and conducted sustained excavations in the siteâs monumental center. The
Colha

Project

also

initiated

paleoenvironmental

and

geomorphological

investigations in adjacent Cobweb Swamp (Jacob 1991, 1995; Jones 1994). In the
early 1990âs, a members of a reconfigured Colha Pre- ceramic Project located
deposits that are considered to be pre- Maya in origin (see Hester et al. 1996;
Iceland 1997). These conclusions are supported primarily by analysis of early
lithic technology and associated radiocarbon assays (Hester et al. 1996; Iceland
1997; see also Wilson et al. 1998).
62

Within the same time frame, archaeological investigation was initiated at
other sites in northern Belize. Work at Santa Rita Corazol showed this site to be
an important center during the both the Late Preclassic and Postclassic Periods
(see Chase and Chase 1988). Moreover, archaeological investigations at the site
of Cerros yielded considerable evidence of political complexity established by the
Late Preclassic Period (400 BC- AD 250) (see Robertson and Freidel 1986;
Garber 1986; Scarborough 1986). The Cerros Project also demonstrated the
importance of multiple avenues of investigation, as research focused on
monumental architecture, material culture, and settlement organization. These
projects, as well as other projects underway in the eastern Peten at Rio Azul (see
Adams 1986, 1988, 1989) influenced greatly the large scale regional settlement
project now under way on the Programme for Belize lands (Adams and Valdez
1993) as well as work at El Pozito, La Milpa, Chan Chich, and Blue Creek, all
medium sized centers located in the Three Rivers region of northwest Belize (see
Houk 1998, 2000).
Archaeological investigations of Maya outfields and agricultural
settlements were initiated in northern Belize at Pulltrouser Swamp (see Turner
and Harrison 1983), and spurred later settlement research at the nearby site of
Kaâxob. The work at Pulltrouser Swamp yielded information about the
complexity of Maya agricultural techniques, lithic technology and economy, as
well as provided important data about environmental change through time (see
McAnany 1986, 1989, 1995; Turner and Harrison 1983).
Analysis undertaken on lithic assemblages from agricultural fields and
settlements located on the periphery of Pulltrouser Swamp have shown that local
communities were linked with regional exchange networks during the Late
Preclassic Period. These networks were focused the acquisition of quality lithic
implements used in farming (McAnany 1986, 1989; Shafer 1983). Later work at
63

Kaâxob linked small Maya communities to regional economies and ideological
webs of significance (McAnany 1995). Along similar lines, further work at San
Estevan during the late 1980âs showed this community to exhibit substantial
settlement and socioeconomic complexity.
Some 45 km to the southwest during the late 1970âs and into the mid
1980âs, David Pendergast and his colleagues from the Royal Ontario Museum, H.
Stanley Loten of the University of Western Ontario, Canadian excavator Claude
Belanger, North American archaeologists, and Maya excavators from Succotz,
Cayo District, Belize under Valentino Ku, began long term excavation in the large
monumental center at Lamanai, along the western shore of the New River
Lagoon. The relationship between Lamanai and Altun Ha proved to go far beyond
each site's excavation by David Pendergast, as similarities in architectural and
material culture styles bear this point out (Pendergast 1992, 1998).
The early investigations at Lamanai were important in the sense of
providing a perspective on the architectural, cultural, and ceramic histories of a
large Maya center that had not, to that point, been systematically excavated.
Archaeological research at Lamanai is discussed in more detail below.
Archaeological work at Northern River Lagoon, originally located and
tested by members of the Colha Regional Survey, shows that this site was
important in the production of salt (Valdez and Mock 1991). As well, Northern
River Lagoon and the surrounding settlements exhibit evidence of significant
Postclassic occupation. To the north and west of Altun Ha, work has been
undertaken at Laguna de On, located in the northern portion of the chert- bearing
zone (Masson 1997). This Postclassic settlement has yielded significant data with
respect to cultural changes that occurred in the region during the Terminal Classic
and the Early Postclassic Periods (Masson 1997). Indeed, a nearly complete chert
form recognized as God K was recovered from secondary contexts at Laguna de
64

On (Masson 1997). The elaborate God K form indicates the importance of flaked
stone symbols at sites across northern Belize.
Other work in the region includes sporadic excavations at El Pozito and
excavations at the center of Chau Hiâix, located at the mid- point between Altun
Ha and Lamanai. Chau Hiâix is a site that has yielded a number of flaked stone
symbols from tomb and cache contexts, but little published material on
excavations at the site is currently available .
In sum, these projects have yielded important data with respect to ancient
Maya culture history and political and economic organization. It is also clear that
archaeological investigations in northern Belize represent a cross- cut of research
methodologies, extending from the more traditional monumental center approach
undertaken at Altun Ha and Lamanai to the interdisciplinary paleoenvironmental,
economic, and settlement emphasis at sites such as Colha, Cobweb Swamp, and
Pulltrouser Swamp. These projects represent to a certain degree archaeological
poles between which the accumulated history of Maya occupation in northern
Belize has been outlined archaeologically in evocative terms.
CULTURE HISTORY AND THREE SITES IN NORTHERN BELIZE
As Pendergast (1979) has noted, the coastal plain of northern Belize was
once thought to be culturally isolated prior to and during the Late Preclassic (400AD 250) and Classic Periods (AD 250- AD 900) of Maya civilization. However,
over the course of the last three decades, archaeological research at a variety of
sites in the region have shown that northern Belize was the focus of cultural
elaboration from early human settlement through collision with Spanish
interlopers after AD 1540 (see Jones 1987; Pendergast 1986). Specifically, during
the Late Preclassic and the Classic Periods, this region saw the proliferation and
decline of regional centers at Cerros, Santa Rita, and Colha and later at Altun Ha

65

and Chau Hi'ix, while cultural continuity has been documented to some degree at
Lamanai (Scarborough 1985; Pendergast 1981; 1986). While numerous smaller
centers including Cuello, Kichpanha, San Estevan, and Kaâxob also flourished
during the Late Preclassic and into the Classic Period (Figure 3.1).
There is now little doubt that the coastal plain of northern Belize was the
focus for the development of complex social and political structures which had
precursors in the village life of the Middle Preclassic (900 BC- 400 BC).
However, by the middle of the Late Preclassic, data suggests that regional
population levels were increasing, as new institutions of political power were
acquired and developed (Freidel 1979; Scarborough 1985; Schele and Freidel
1990).
The elite communities who consolidated particular institutions of power
drew political and economic support from surrounding communities. This
reliance likely resulted in acquisition of both commodities and labor by the elite,
as well as solidified relations between local elites and those elites occupying
larger regional centers. At the same time, lower level socioeconomies of
production and distribution were continuing to cross cut political boundaries, as
individuals and communities likely maintained numerous exchange relationships
(Hester and Shafer 1994; King and Potter 1994; McAnany 1989, 1991; Shafer and
Hester 1983, 1991).
With the emergence of a clearly defined status hierarchy in the Late
Preclassic, new forms of material culture appeared. These included locally
produced ceramics and flaked stone symbols comprised of chert, as well as nonlocal ceramics and other materials such as shell, jade, and obsidian (Gibson
1989). Though perhaps established earlier, the presence of obsidian in larger
quantities during the Late Preclassic and Early Classic Periods suggests that an

66

Figure 3.1- Maya sites mentioned in text (adapted from Hester 1985)
increase in long distance exchange likely occurred during this time frame (Dreiss
1988; Hammond 1972).
Altun Ha
Although not large in comparison to neighboring Lamanai or the more
distant central Peten centers of Tikal and Uaxactun, Altun Ha can clearly be
67

classified as unique in the eastern lowlands and perhaps in all of the Maya world
in terms of the quantity and diversity of elite material culture recovered there (see
Pendergast 1979, 1982, 1990). Concomitant with this material wealth is the
implicit notion of Classic Period social complexity. With the monumental center
covering some 2.5 square km, Altun Ha is relatively compact. The central
precinct is located approximately 20km south southeast of Colha, along the
southern periphery of the chert- bearing zone (see Figure 3.1). Again, the location
of the site near water, relatively good agricultural soils, and quality limestone and
chert no doubt played a part in the elaboration of Maya culture in this locality.
Moreover, Altun Ha's proximity to the coast must be considered in terms of the
expansion of trade across northern Belize and perhaps farther north into the
Yucatan and most certainly west with Lamanai and perhaps into the central Peten.
The focus of the Altun Ha investigations was a comprehensive assessment
of monumental architecture in the site center (see Pendergast 1979, 1982, 1990).
A complete map of the monumental center was generated and a number of
peripheral structures were also excavated during the project (Pendergast 1979,
1982, 1990). What became clear after several seasons of work was the continuity
of the placement of caches and burials in structures, and the diversity of offering
contents. Moreover, distinct architectural and ceramic styles have been
documented at the site. Occupation spanned from the Middle Preclassic through
the Classic Period, from around 600 BC through AD 1000. During the Classic
Period (AD 250- 900), Altun Ha saw the proliferation and elaboration of elite
culture, and was likely was a dominant political center in northern Belize with
clear cultural and political links to Lamanai and other sites in the region
(Pendergast 1981, 1992; Scarborough 1985; see also Hester and Shafer 1994).
The excavation of over three dozen tombs and burials has been
instrumental in expanding our knowledge of elite Maya funerary patterns. Within
68

the royal tombs at Altun Ha, ceramics, shell, obsidian, and especially jade have
been recovered in large quantities (see Pendergast 1979, 1982, 1990). This
material wealth indicates the status and power the elite community possessed
during the Classic Period. A consideration of this political economic power must
include the assumption that the elite possessed the ability to acquire both labor
and material objects that played a vital role in the production and legitimation of a
dominant ideology.
Maya occupation at Altun Ha dates to the latter part of the Middle
Preclassic (600 BC) as defined chronologically by the Xul ceramic phase
(Pendergast 1979: 34). Like other Late Middle Preclassic settlements in the
lowlands, Maya village culture at Altun Ha was likely focused economically on
milpa agriculture, bounded socially by both ancient and expedient kinship ties,
and linked to larger cosmological themes through household ritual and ancestor
veneration. The various permutations of these social forms were an integral part
of the Pandoraâs Box eventually forced open by emerging elite communities,
likely descendants of village leaders. These relations and the political alliances
and cosmology on which they were formed became the ideological basis for
Classic Maya political hierarchy (see Marcus 1993; Culbert 1991). This hierarchy
not only manifested in elite communities the ability to harness cosmological and
human labor power, but also in peripheral and craft communities the
technological and social knowledge necessary for legitimation and maintenance
of relations of production and exchange within and across socioeconomic classes.
The Xul Phase extends to 100 BC, or the latter part of the Late Preclassic
Period (400 BC- AD 150) coeval with the Chicanel complex as defined at
Uaxactun (Smith 1955). During the subsequent Yaxkin Phase (100 BC- AD 150)
further construction of public and eventually monumental architecture and an
increase in size of the site center became prevalent (see Figure 3.2). During this
69

Figure 3.2- Ceramic chronology at Altun Ha and other Maya sites
(from Pendergast 1990)

70

time period, lithic craft communities located to the north, at Colha were
producing stone tools on a massive scale for local and regional consumption. To
the west, Lamanai also was the focus of monumental construction as elite lineages
consolidated their power among villagers living along the indigo crocodile known
today as the New River Lagoon. It is not unreasonable to surmise that both elite
communities occupying each site and surrounding settlements were aware of the
existence of distant towns with which political- economic and thus cultural
exchanges were perhaps at the time becoming more frequent.
By the Early Classic Period (AD 250- 600) or the Mol and Chen ceramic
phases at Altun Ha, the frequency of monumental construction was reaching its
zenith, with cultural influences reflective of Lamanai (i.e. the Lamanai Building
Type). These trends continued into the Late Classic Period (AD 600- 900).
Approximately 100 years afterward, during the Early Postclassic Period
(AD1000- AD 1200) the site was partially abandoned and then re- occupied to
some degree during the Late Postclassic (Pendergast 1979: 34; Loten and
Pendergast 1984).
A large (some 346) and diverse assemblage of flaked stone symbols were
recovered from various tomb and cache contexts at Altun Ha, with a distinctive
pattern of deposition dating to the latter part of the Early Classic Period
(Pendergast 1998). This pattern consists of caches of intricately flaked chert
symbols placed in caches around tomb chambers. In numerous instances, caches
were positioned along the axes of the cardinal directions, such as at the tomb of
Kinich Ahau, in Tomb B-4/7 (Pendergast 1982: 54- 60). Caches also occur at the
corners of tomb chambers, as well as along the central axis of particular
structures. The number of flaked stone symbols present in caches vary from three
to forty- one individual artifacts, with specific numbers perhaps purposefully
repeated (Table 3.1). These caches contain a wide diversity of forms comprised of

similar raw material, including a variety of anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, staff
ends, disks, rings, and more esoteric forms that may convey portions of
hieroglyphs and (or) celestial events (Figure 3.3).
The number of caches containing flaked stone symbols at Altun Ha is
impressive. What is perhaps more interesting is the fact that the materials appear
to be produced from the quality microcrystalline silicates found locally, in the
northern Belize chert- bearing zone. It seems clear that specimens were produced
by local crafters. Moreover, obsidian eccentric pieces are also present at Altun Ha
in moderate quantities. Though this research will not address the production of
obsidian items, they support the notion that symbolic lithic materials made of both
chert and obsidian played an important role in indexing specific meaning to the

73

individuals and communities who produced, acquired, displayed, and observed
these artifacts in cultural and ritual context. In addition to comprising caches
associated with burials, individual symbolic chert artifacts show marked
patterning in terms of the production of the artifact, the form each artifact takes,
as well as the contexts and associations in which they occur.
In terms of chronology, the earliest appearing flaked stone symbols occur
at Altun Ha during the latter part of the Early Classic Period, which correlated to
the Yax ceramic phase (circa AD 550) (Pendergast 1979). By the Late Classic
(AD 600- 900), caches of flaked stone symbols become even more frequent, with
tombs and crypt burials displaying caches of flaked stone symbols in large
numbers. The latest contexts for symbolic lithics at Altun Ha date to the 7th
century AD, during the Pax ceramic phase. This chronological period also is
marked by the deposition of large numbers of flaked stone symbols in caches at
Lamanai (Table 3.1).
There is scant evidence of lithic production in the site center of Altun Ha.
This hinders our ability to interpret when and where the production of flaked
stone symbols occurred. However, production of chert tool forms has been
documented in the settlement area known as Chicawate, located some 2- 4 km to
the north of Altun Ha (Kelly 1982; Kelly et al. 1979; Meadows 1997). Maya
settlement at Chicawate shows surface evidence of domestic production of stone
tools comprised of local chert dating to the Late Classic Period. The presence of
lithic implements and production debris tentatively dating to the Late Classic
Period have also been observed at the site of Kunahmul, located some 5 km to the
south of Altun Ha (Shafer: personal communication 2000, Taylor 1980).
At Chicawate, a total of fifteen structures were documented within a one
square kilometer area in June of 1997. Each context exhibited a dense mound of
lithic debitage associated with low rectangular platforms (see Meadows 1997).
74

Surface ceramics from the Tepeu 2 and Tepeu 3 ceramic complexes tentatively
indicate a Late Classic occupation, consistent with ceramics recovered in the
earlier surveys. Moreover, observations of surface materials indicate the presence
of a similar technology for stone tool production as that observed at Colha.
Namely, macroblades and macroflake- blades that were quarried locally and
bifacially reduced via hard hammer percussion into tool forms are present.
It has been proposed that Chicawate became important in terms of the
production and distribution of chert tool forms in the region during the Late
Classic Period (Meadows 1997; Shafer and Hester 1983, 1991). Along these lines,
it is suggested that with increasing local populations, and the encroaching
political economic and religious influence of Altun Ha, craft and agricultural
communities proliferated on the periphery of this monumental center. These
communities provided both the human labor and technological resources for the
construction of monumental architecture, intensification of agricultural practices,
and the production of specific kinds of material culture.
In sum, during the latter part of the Early Classic through the Terminal
Classic Periods (AD 500- AD 900), large quantities of flaked stone symbols were
being placed in elite burial and cache contexts at Altun Ha. Without further work,
it is impossible to draw any conclusions regarding whether the production of
flaked stone symbols occurred at Chicawate. What has become clear is that flaked
stone technology was an important cultural and economic activity to craft
communities associated with Altun Ha. On multiple levels, flaked stone was
necessary for monumental construction, agricultural work, and numerous tasks
that included but were not limited to working bone, shell, and plant fiber (see
Lewenstein 1987; Aldenderfer et al. 1988). In another sense, the production of
flaked stone implements in symbolic form indicates that these symbols were

75

critical to the production and legitimation of a culturally and historically specific
ideology, and comprise, to some degree, an iconography of power.
The wealth of material culture recovered from Altun Ha indicates the
center's location was an important intersection for items of exchange via a number
of complex, and likely interrelated, economies from the Protoclassic through the
Terminal Classic Periods (150 BC- AD 900). The presence of craft specialization
in masonry, architecture, production of ceramics, and in this case flaked stone
symbols, suggests that elites were harnessing knowledge through specific modes
of political economic and cosmological power. The necessity for production and
acquisition of specific classes of material culture may have been embedded in kin
relations, ancestor veneration, and the deification of the genealogy of the elite as
culture, political economy, and religion were inextricably linked.
The distinct styles of material culture present at Altun Ha point to
complex local and regional histories within which flaked stone symbols played an
important part. These symbolic forms embodied the dominant ideology and linked
communities of lithic crafters to the ideology of the elite.
Colha
Positioning lithic technology as a point of departure for a comprehensive
study of flaked stone symbols originating in northern Belize, there is no site in the
Maya lowlands that better exhibits evidence of lithic production on a massive
scale than Colha, Belize. Colha is located in the northern portion of the chert
bearing zone along Rancho Creek and Cobweb Swamp (Hester 1979; Hester et al.
1981, 1982, 1994). The site is located on 7.5 square kilometers of relatively
productive soils that were conducive to intensive agriculture. Colha's location,
close to an abundant source of fresh water, quality stone, and good soils
motivated both early human occupation of the site dating to pre- ceramic times, as

76

well as later Maya habitation (Shafer and Hester 1983, 1991; Hester et al. 1996;
Iceland 1997; see also Wilson et al. 1998).
Archaeological investigations at Colha are part of a multi- disciplinary
approach that has contributed to knowledge of Maya stone tool technology,
agriculture, human- ecological relationships, and the economic organization of
communities that developed away from large centers of elite culture (Hester et al.
1982; Jacob 1991; Jones 1994; King and Potter 1994; Potter 1993; Roemer 1984).
At this relatively small and rural site there is no free standing monumental
architecture. However, the presence of numerous lithic workshop deposits
exhibiting large quantities of debitage and discarded tool forms indicated that
stone working was a specialized economic activity undertaken by the occupants
of the site. The presence of these workshop deposits prompted questions such as:
Where was the chert quarried? What was being produced? What were the
lifeways of the lithic crafters (Hester and Hammond 1976; Shafer and Hester
1983, 1991)? Moreover, because the workshop deposits were so numerous and
dense, it was clear that the rate of production far outnumbered the number of tools
utilized by the site's inhabitants (Hester and Shafer 1983, 1991).
The resultant investigations have documented well over 100 lithic
workshops spanning from the Middle Preclassic (900 BC- 400 BC) to the
Postclassic Period (after AD 1100). However, the majority of the workshops date
from the Late Preclassic and the Late Classic Period (400 BC- AD 250) and (AD
600- 850) (Hester and Shafer 1994; Shafer and Hester 1983, 1991). This time
frame saw the elaboration of a bifacially worked macroblade and macroflakeblade technology, the precursors of which were in place prior to ancient Maya
occupation of the region, perhaps as early as 3,000 BC (Iceland 1997; Wilson et
al. 1998). Macroblade and macroflake- blade technology is based on the bifacial
reduction of large chert "blanks" procured from chert nodules quarried from
77

shallow surface mines, visible at Colha and Altun Ha, formerly known as
Rockstone Pond, indicative of the local quarry.
Both nodular and tabular cherts were roughly shaped at the quarry and
then brought to workshops where the materials were knapped into a diversity of
utilitarian and later, symbolic forms (Gibson 1989; Shafer 1979, 1985; Roemer
1984). A reduction continuum for stone tools, based on experimental results and
analysis of materials from workshop deposits of differing time periods suggests
that ancient Maya stone workers at Colha were indeed craft specialists (Shafer
1982, 1985, 1994). Shafer (1985) concludes that during the Late Preclassic and
Late Classic periods, chert crafters were producing a tool form inventory with
direct hard hammer percussion, using small, ovoid limestone hammers (Shafer
1982, 1985). It has been posited that lithic reduction occurred in workshops
specifically occupied for working chert nodules, macroblades and early stage
bifaces into finished tool forms (Shafer 1994; Shafer and Hester 1983, 1991).
A chronology of stone tool forms has been identified spanning from the
Middle Preclassic through the Postclassic Period (Early AD 1000- 1200, Late AD
1200- 1400)(Hester 1982, 1985). These forms represent the development of a
highly specialized technology for producing the tools necessary for use in the
intensification of agriculture, working wood and other materials in domestic
activities, and monumental construction at Colha and sites across northern Belize
(Hester and Shafer 1994; McAnany 1989). During the Late Preclassic and Classic
Period these materials were part of important exchange networks, known as lithic
economies (Gibson 1986; Hester and Shafer 1994; King and Potter 1994;
McAnany 1989).
Perhaps the most distinctive form appearing during the Middle Preclassic
Period was the t- shaped adze. The Middle Preclassic at Colha is associated with
the Bolay and Chiwa ceramic complexes (Valdez 1987). The t- shaped adze form
78

was the precursor to a later development, the tranchet bit adze (Hester 1985).
Later developments in macroflake and biface technology resulted in the
production of both utilitarian and symbolic forms (Gibson 1989; Hester and
Shafer 1994). The stemmed macroblade was manufactured after 400 BC, as were
other forms of flaked stone symbols present at Colha (Gibson 1989; Probst 1984).
It is important to note that utilitarian forms possessed symbolic value in terms of
the raw material on which they were produced. Chert was no doubt seen as an
important medium that likely possessed both physical and supernatural properties
critical for completion of specific tasks. Paired with the continued elaboration of
Maya culture and society, one trajectory was the development of purely symbolic
lithic implements that crystallized ideological themes and political relationships.
Perhaps the tool form that has been most critical to assessing lithic craft
specialization at Colha was developed during the Late Preclassic (400 BC- AD
250), a time period associated with the Blossom Bank ceramic complex (Figure
3.4) (see also Valdez 1987: 28). The tranchet bit tool or adz was produced from a
biface in which a single flake was removed via the tranchet technique from the
distal end of the tool form in order to create the tool's bit (Shafer 1979, 1982,
1985; Shafer and Hester 1983, 1991). In most instances, a single tranchet flake
was removed from the distal end of the biface. Thus, researchers were able to
calculate the number of tool forms produced by tabulating the number of flakes
contained within a workshop deposit (Shafer and Hester 1983, 1991; Hester and
Shafer 1992). Indeed, specific workshops were hypothesized to be the locus of
production of tens of thousands of tranchet bit tools during the Late Preclassic
(Hester and Shafer 1984; Shafer and Hester 1983, 1991).
The oval biface has been identified as a tool form that was produced in
greater numbers than the tranchet bit tool during the Late Preclassic at Colha.

79

(from Valdez 1987)

80

The oval biface was also produced on a macroblade, but left no signature flake
that could be correlated with the number of implements produced. Instead, large
quantities of bifacial reduction flakes accumulated during production, limiting the
accuracy of tabulating the exact number of implements represented in a particular
workshop deposit (Shafer and Hester 1983, 1991). Moreover, the oval biface
changed form through time, as the larger variety was more prevalent during the
Late Preclassic gave way to a smaller, celt- like oval biface, more prevalent
during the Late Classic (Roemer 1984; Hester 1985). This change in form may be
linked to shifting economic activities through time, as agricultural intensification
may have necessitated the use of smaller implements for removing secondary
undergrowth rather than primary forest.
Results of numerous analyses of lithic workshop debris from Late
Preclassic workshop deposits excavated at Colha support the notion of
community wide lithic craft specialization (Shafer 1982, 1985; Shafer and Hester
1983, 1991). Moreover, the density and configuration of the lithic deposits
suggest that stone tools were being crafted on a full time basis (Hester and Shafer
1984; Shafer and Hester 1983, 1991). Ethnographic analogues suggest that the
crafters were independent specialists engaged in full time production of tool
forms for intra- regional distribution.
During the Late Preclassic, with regional political centers becoming more
influential in local political economies, both utilitarian and flaked stone symbols
were being produced at Colha (see Scarborough 1985). Gibson (1989) asserts that
stemmed macroblades manufactured at Colha were becoming increasingly
important to elite communities occupying surrounding sites. Hester and Shafer
(1994) have documented the presence of stemmed macroblades produced from
northern Belize cherts at sites across the southern Yucatan and into the Peten.
Gibson (1989: 75) asserts that the production of stemmed macroblades can
81

be traced to the increasing importance of the status hierarchy during the Late
Preclassic Period. Other forms of flaked stone symbols were also being produced
at Colha during the Late Preclassic and may have been introduced into regional
elite economies of acquisition and exchange (Gibson 1989; Hester and Shafer
1994; Meadows 1998).
The Early Classic Period (AD 250- AD 600) at Colha is ephemeral. No
workshops have been identified that date solely to the Early Classic. It is posited
that continuity is present in ceramic and lithic artifact styles from the Late
Preclassic through the Early Classic. By Late Classic times (AD 550- AD 900) at
Colha, marked by the emergence of the Bomba and Masson ceramic complexes,
changes in the forms of stone implements produced in the workshops is evident.
Additionally, there is compelling evidence that the mode of production may have
also shifted during this time (King 2000). Large deposits of debitage independent
of structures, while present, are not nearly as prevalent as those dated to the Late
Preclassic (see Roemer 1984). Workshop deposits dated to the Late Classic
generally occur as smaller talus slopes that spill off the sides of platforms.
Household workshops, such as that present at Operation 3017 may be the norm
during the Late Classic (Meadows and Wilson 1997).
At Operation 3017, a large talus slope spilling of the southwest corner of
the platform indicates a workshop deposit directly associated with the structure.
The platform itself was clearly the site of domestic activities based on the
presence of ceramics, expended tool forms, ground stone, and shell ornaments. A
total of 13 individuals were interred in the platform (Meadows and Wilson 1997).
The occurrence of burials, domestic debris, and the raised platform in close
association with the debitage deposits and broken tool forms, suggests this
context may have functioned as a household workshop. Analysis of the material
indicates that a number of Late Classic tool forms were being produced in the

vicinity. At 3017, these forms include small oval bifaces, general utility bifaces,
and thin bifaces (Meadows and Wilson 1997).
Flaked stone symbols at Colha take a number of forms and originate from
several contexts, most frequently occurring in a series of Late Classic caches at
Operation 2012 and two caches likely associated with the burial of a female at
Operation 2031 dating to the Protoclassic (Meskill 1992). The forms from 2012
occur as an impressive array of notched blades and bifaces. Later bifacially
worked materials are more prevalent in the Late Classic context at 2012 (Table
3.2). Moreover, numerous partial and broken flaked stone symbols from Colha
originated from platform fill. This may indicate production discard. Probst (1984)
has compiled data regarding flaked stone symbols recovered from Colha. This
assemblage, numbering some 68 specimens, includes a range of forms, from

serrated rings and thin bifaces that appear to be the distal ends of staffs and

The work of Potter (1993), King and Potter (1994), and Hester and Shafer
(1994) have further clarified the role of Colha from a regional perspective. King
and Potter (1994) assert that low level socioeconomies of exchange were in effect
during the Late Preclassic and into the Classic Period. These socioeconomies
were the manifestation of long- term exchange relationships in which ancient
Maya lithic crafters were engaged. These horizontal socioeconomies were part of
a complex network of community exchange that, while dynamic was also stable
due to varying degrees of autonomy with respect to elite dominated political
economy.

84

Moreover, during the same time frame, regional elites were also involved
in lithic exchange, both in the direct acquisition of flaked stone symbols that were
likely used in public or restricted access ritual, or as part of tribute extraction
from specific loci of exchange (i.e. such as regional markets). According to the
producer- consumer model, as put forth by Hester and Shafer (1994), utilitarian
items were being distributed within northern Belize, while symbolic items such as
the stemmed macroblade were being exchanged across political and geographic
boundaries (Hester and Shafer 1994; Dockall and Shafer 1993).
Whatever the specifics of the distribution of lithic materials that were
produced at Colha, there are a number of points that are clear. The first is that
certain types of tool forms were being produced in vast quantities for exchange
beginning in the Late Preclassic. The second is that these materials were being
worked by full time specialists that exhibited some degree of autonomy in terms
of distribution of their wares (Hester and Shafer 1992, 1994; Shafer 1994; Shafer
and Hester 1983, 1991). The third is that the mode of production shifted to a
domestic context after the Early Classic Period (King 2000; Potter and King
1994; Meadows and Wilson 1997). The Late Classic saw a shift in the kinds of
tool forms being produced and the setting in which they were produced. Stemmed
macroblade production likely decreased, and while bifacially worked flaked stone
symbols were produced in the Late Preclassic, production of these forms during
the Late Classic at Colha declined (see Probst 1984).
The excavation of what has been termed the âskull pitâ and designated
more formally as Colha Operation 2011 illustrates the violent end of a large group
of elite individuals sometime during the Terminal Classic Period (AD 775). The
decapitation of 30 individuals provides a glimpse into the extent of social
disjuncture occurring at Colha during this time period (see Mock 1994). The
decline of elite communities at Colha can be correlated with pollen evidence that
85

shows a regeneration of the forest at Colha after AD 850 (Jones 1994; Valdez
1998: personal communication). By the Early Postclassic (AD 1000), the site
appears to have been reoccupied by a different group of people, perhaps
Yucatecan populations originating from the north, based on changes in settlement
organization and lithic technology (Hester 1985; Hester et al. 1994). This change
is supported by marked changes in lithic and ceramic production (Michael 1989;
Valdez 1987; see also Masson 1997). By the Early Postclassic Period, the
technology and political economy that spurred the production of flaked stone
symbols was no longer present in the region, even if cosmological themes
persisted.
Lamanai
Lamanai is a large, sprawling center located on the west- bank of the New
River lagoon, some 40 km due west of Altun Ha. In comparison to other Maya
centers, Lamanai is markedly linear in overall site plan (Pendergast 1981; see also
Houk 1996 for a discussion of Maya site planning). The site center of Lamanai
comprises a total of 4.5 square kilometers. Within this perimeter, 718 structures
were documented, indicating significant structure density (Pendergast 1981: 32).
The size and site plan of Lamanai make the center unique in the Maya world.
Moreover, there is little evidence for the widespread social disjuncture so
prevalent throughout the Maya lowlands at the end of the Classic Period (AD
900) (Pendergast 1981, 1986, 1993).
Instead, Lamanai shows occupation from the Preclassic through the
Postclassic Periods and into historic times (Jones 1987; Pendergast 1981, 1986).
Although there is still debate as to the intensity of occupation during the Terminal
Classic and the Early Postclassic Periods. There is no dispute that Lamanai was
the site of the construction of a historic period church that was the focus of

86

proselytizing efforts during the early years of the Spanish entrada (Jones 1987;
Pendergast 1981, 1986).
It must be noted that efforts to synthesize data from field work and lab
analysis are still being undertaken at the Lamanai Field Research Center by
members of the Lamanai Archaeological Project (see Graham 2000). Moreover,
recent excavations and structure consolidation under the direction of Elizabeth
Graham of the Institute of Archaeology, University College London and Jaime
Awe of the University of New Hampshire and the Government of Belize are also
underway. The presentation of the assemblage of flaked stone symbols in this
dissertation represents part of these continuing research efforts. However, while
the archaeological evidence for an extended culture history at Lamanai most
certainly exists, the lack of published data on Late Preclassic and Classic Period
developments there, to some degree impedes the present discussion. Thus, the
culture history section presented here is in somewhat abbreviated form and
integrates more contextual information in relation to Lamanai's culture history
rather than a synthesis of the published work implemented in the Altun Ha and
Colha discussions.
The earliest evidence of occupation at Lamanai was recovered from what
has been termed the harbor area, located at the north end of the site center. At the
harbor, a large quantity of corn pollen was recovered from the sediments
originating at the bottom of harbor. This large accumulation of corn pollen dates
to the Early Preclassic Period, around 1500 BC (Pendergast 1981: 56). In general,
though, excavations at Lamanai, similar to Altun Ha, yielded evidence for
intensive occupation and monumental construction beginning in the Late
Preclassic Period (circa 400 BC). In contrast to Altun Ha, Lamanai is a
substantially larger center, and thus provided its own archaeological challenges in

87

terms of excavation of monumental architecture, establishing site chronology, and
generating a comprehensive site map (see Pendergast 1981).
The focus of excavation in the initial seasons of work was the southern
portion of the site, at the elite temple complex designated N10-9. The terminal
construction of N10-9 has been relatively dated to the Late Classic Period, with
significant Postclassic occupation evident along the axis of the building and in a
substantial midden adjacent to the structure. While numerous offerings were
recovered along the axial staircase of N10-9, no tombs were encountered.
However, two large caches of flaked stone symbols, ceramics, small quantities of
jade, carved bone, obsidian, and shell were recovered beneath the terminal
staircase and the second staircase of the structure. These caches contained the
majority of flaked stone symbols recovered at Lamanai, and have been relatively
dated to the Late and Terminal Classic Periods, respectively (Pendergast 1981).
Structure N10- 9, known as the Temple of the Jaguar yielded two large
caches of flaked stone symbols along the primary axis. These flaked stone
symbols and other forms of material culture in the caches were located in
successive construction episodes dating to the late 7th and early 8th century AD
(Pendergast 2000: personal communication). The lithic artifacts appear as a range
of anthropomorphic, zoomorphic and other esoteric forms. Specifically, elongated
and notched bifaces that appear in profile as serpents and (or) crocodiles occur in
both of these Late Classic Period caches. The latest cache specifically exhibits a
large number of zoomorphic forms produced on chert bearing zone
microcrystalline silicates. Both the symbolic forms and the raw materials are very
similar to the assemblage from Altun Ha and are addressed in Chapter Five.
A significant cache of flaked stone symbols were recovered from beneath
a large altar in the plaza of N10-9 (see Pendergast 1981). This context appears to
have been a secondary deposition, due to evidence that the altar fragment located
88

over the cache was dragged from a previous location (Pendergast: personal
communication 2000). The context dates to the Late to Terminal Classic Period
(AD 850- 900). It is clear that the diversity of forms and the continuity of raw
materials with the rest of the assemblage at Lamanai and the assemblage at Altun
Ha. There is little doubt that the material comprising these artifacts are from the
northern Belize chert- bearing zone, the region that was the source of raw material
for the chert crafters at Colha and Altun Ha.
After three seasons of excavations in the southern end of the center,
emphasis shifted to the northern portion of the site, primarily in the N9-56
structure complex. At N9-56, the Lamanai building type prevalent at Altun Ha
was easily recognized in the terminal construction phase (Pendergast 1981). After
clearing a large mask on the south flank of the building, trenching into the interior
of the structure resulted in the discovery of an Early Classic tomb present in an
earlier structure. The tomb exhibited an interior composite structure of wood and
cloth and yielded ornate mortuary goods, ceramics, obsidian, but no symbolic
lithics. This tomb dates to circa AD 550 (Pendergast 1981: 36). The terminal
construction at N9- 56 is dated to the Late Classic. As Pendergast (1998) has
noted, the archaeological contexts at Lamanai exhibited far fewer items of what
might be considered material wealth when compared to Altun Ha. However, the
similarity of architectural and ceramic styles suggests that there was a political
relationship between the two centers.
Late Preclassic offerings were recovered in moderate quantities at
N10-43 during construction modification of the structure, known as the High
Temple. These offerings again indicated the parsimony of offerings at Lamanai
when compared to other sites in the region (Pendergast 1998: 57). A black ware
cylindrical vessel dating from between 100 BC to AD 100 illustrates to some

degree the caching emphasis at Lamanai was on ceramic vessels (Pendergast
1998: 57).
While materials recovered from N10-43 yielded evidence of significant
Late Preclassic occupation and N9-56 important data in the form of the Early
Classic tomb, caches dated to the Classic Period at Lamanai show little patterning
in the placement and kinds of offerings present (Pendergast 2000: personal
communication). One example of a Classic Period caches includes lip to lip
vessels recovered from structure N9-53, which dates from between AD 500 and
AD 550 (Pendergast 1998). However, during the Late Classic (AD 600- 900)
large axial caches are more prevalent, as illustrated by the two large caches
recovered from structure N10-9.
Located just to the southeast of the N10- 43 complex is an elite residential
area that opens via a broad staircase into the extreme north end of the N10-9 plaza
(Plaza 2). A structure at the northern extent of this residential complex is a
building designated N10- 15. In the small northern staircase of N10- 15, two
significant caches of flaked stone symbols were recovered from beneath the
central portion of the staircase (Table 3.3). These two caches were dated via

90

construction sequence to the Terminal Classic. These caches were deposited after
the main plaza of the compound was filled (Pendergast: personal communication
2000).
Located just to the east of the N10-9 plaza extensive excavation in
structure N10-2 and N10- 4 indicate intensive occupation throughout the
Postclassic Period. In these structures, ceramics are elaborate and appear to be
stylistically related to centers in the Northern Yucatan. Copper bells are present in
offerings from these structures, also indicative of contact with other regions of
Mesoamerican during the Postclassic. Further excavation around the church
revealed shifts in ritual practices after the presence of Spanish missionaries in the
region sometime after AD 1540. Conflict between catechists and Maya
communities occupying the center are archaeologically visible via the re- setting
of a stela in front of the church and placement of a traditional cache under the
doorway during this time period (Jones 1987; Pendergast 1986).
Lamanai was a center that possessed a significant population for dozens of
generations, beginning in the Late Preclassic and perhaps extending for over a
millennium into the Postclassic and Historic Period. The populations during this
time no doubt included communities of craft specialists of one kind or another.
However, the lack of evidence for discrete production episodes for flaked stone
symbols at Lamanai, the continuity of forms with Altun Ha, and the continuity of
raw material with that originating from the chert- bearing zone must be addressed
to interpret where and when flaked stone symbols were produced. Questions arise
such as: Was the raw material imported for use by local crafters at Lamanai? Was
production being undertaken elsewhere?

Figure 3.6- Frequency of flaked stone symbol groupings present at Lamanai
In sum, the discrete contexts of flaked stone symbols at Lamanai, an
assemblage that numbers some 94 pieces, suggests that these artifacts played an
important role in the elaboration of elite culture. The artifacts were part of a
political economy of production and procurement of the objects, as well as ritual
activities of use and deposition in specific cultural contexts. In any case, the
images represented in the assemblage are powerful indicators of specific
cosmological and historical links (Figure 3.6).
Lamanai was an important lowland center before, during, and after the
Classic Period. Archaeological investigations there show a complex material
culture assemblage marked by a distinct architectural as well as ceramic style.
The Lamanai Building Type was actually first observed at Altun Ha and then
observed at Lamanai (Pendergast 1981). The style is prevalent in the Late Classic
and again is indicative of likely powerful political relationships between the two

92

centers. Moreover, the presence of a diverse assemblage of flaked stone symbols,
similar in form and raw material to the larger assemblage from Altun Ha, also
supports the notion of cultural and political economic relationships between these
two important sites.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
This chapter has presented a broad history of archaeology in northern
Belize, an accumulation of work spanning most of the 20th century. As has been
articulated, much of this work took place in the second half of the century.
Stemming from these investigations, a general culture history for each of the three
centers under consideration in the current study was discussed. The goal was to
contextualize culture history as the direct result of specific archaeological
projects, and the research emphasis of those projects. In doing so, I can employ
these culture histories in a broad way in an interpretation of the emergence of a
specific material culture assemblage and the communities that produced,
acquired, and consumed the assemblages through time.
In closing, I would like to summarize the culture history as presented for
the region in relation to lithic technology and the appearance of flaked stone
symbols. Northern Belize contains deposits of quality microcrystalline silicate
that supplied the raw material necessary for an early developing flaked stone
technology. Early chert macroblade technology has been identified as dating to
the Middle and Late Archaic Period in northern Belize, dating to 3000 BC
(Iceland 1997; MacNeish et al. 1980). This technology has been linked to the
appearance of similar forms across the Caribbean during a similar timeframe. The
distinctive lithic technology present in various localities separated by water hints
at cultural contact between Late Archaic pre- Maya populations in Belize and
those inhabiting the Greater Antilles (Wilson et al. 1998).

93

The coastal lowlands of northern Belize were the focus of intensive
occupation by the ancient Maya dating to the Middle Preclassic (900 BC- 400
BC). Chert crafters utilizing this technology provided both utilitarian and
symbolic lithic implements that were the focus of both low level socioeconomies
of production and exchange as well a high level elite acquisition of symbolic
artifacts. The development of macroblade technology for producing bifacial forms
utilizing direct hard hammer percussion is most evident at Colha. At this small,
rural site, generations of lithic crafters produced specific utilitarian and symbolic
forms and, perhaps most prolifically during the Late Preclassic. To some degree
the rise of a status hierarchy during this time began to motivate the production of
symbolic forms (Gibson 1989). These forms, such as the stemmed macroblade,
first appear at Colha.
In what appears to be an elaboration of the lithic industry, by the Early
Classic, the site of Altun Ha exhibits an extensive assemblage of flaked stone
symbols produced on northern Belize chert. The quantity and quality of these
materials suggests that the political hegemony of the elite at Altun Ha manifested
the ability to garner the services of lithic craft specialists. In turn, while these
specialists were likely not part of the elite, they may have wielded considerable
influence in their courts (see Helms 1993).
At Lamanai, similar architectural and material culture manifestations link
this site indelibly to Altun Ha. Indeed, despite yielding smaller quantities of
material wealth in comparison to Altun Ha, Lamanai exhibits a cultural continuity
that lasted much longer than that seen at Altun Ha. Part of the material culture
assemblages recovered from cache contexts at Lamanai during the Late Classic
are large quantities of flaked stone symbols. These artifacts exhibit a diversity of
forms and are produced from high quality northern Belize chert.

94

Moreover, the majority of these items were clearly produced on bifacially
reduced macroblades and macroflake- blades, indicating a technological
standardization that had its origins in the workshops at Colha. Indeed, the
contexts of the assemblage at Lamanai suggest that flaked stone symbols may
have played an important role in a broader political relationship with Altun Ha
during the Classic Period.
It is important to reiterate that flaked stone symbols lie at the intersection
of political economy, cosmology, and lithic technology. They crystallize meaning
accessed and employed by the lithic crafters from multiple perspectives. The
standardization, florescence, and eventual disappearance of flaked stone symbol
technology may be part of a burgeoning political- economic complexity that to
some degree foreshadows Terminal Classic social disjuncture in the eastern
lowlands. Chapter Four, the next chapter discusses social organization of Classic
Period Maya society and places in perspective the notion of craft specialization
with respect to production of material culture in general, and flaked stone
symbols more specifically.

Chapter 4: Craft Specialization and Ancient
Maya Political Economy
Homo economicus is not behind us, but before, like moral man, the man of duty,
the scientific man and the reasonable man. For a long time man was something
quite different; and it is not long now since he became a machine, a calculating
machine (Mauss 1966: 74).
One of the goals of this chapter is to contextualize the class of material
culture under study within current conceptual frameworks of craft specialization.
By understanding how archaeological constructions of craft specialization are
linked to larger paradigms of social evolution, we can re- position flaked stone
symbols as both a developmental marker for lithic craft specialization as well as a
catalyst for the historically emergent social relations that help to define localized
political economy. In this sense, political economy is viewed as the social
relations that exist between communities with unequal access to wealth and
power (King 2000: 12; Roseberry 1989: 44).
The focus here is not just how elites acquired and employed flake stone
symbols as part of ritual displays that reinforced political authority, but also how
technological and symbolic knowledges differentiated craft communities from
both the elite and the non- elite. In this view, flaked stone symbols were not
commodities, in the sense of possessing only an economic value, but instead were
signifiers of the social relations that existed between their producers and their
eventual possessors (Appadurai 1986: 4; Godelier 1999; King 2000; Weiner
1992). It is posited that flaked stone symbols were prestige goods of local origin,
and that they embodied powerful relationships that existed between the crafters
and the individuals and communities who acquired and employed them. In this
sense we can begin to view the production and acquisition of flaked stone
symbols as the manifestation of local and historical knowledge.

96

At the same time, we must also define the appearance of flaked stone
symbols in the eastern Maya lowlands within a larger view of Classic Period
Maya society. There is an extensive body of literature regarding the emergence of
lowland Maya states and their political organization during the Late Preclassic
and the Early Classic Period (Adams 1977; Demarest 1986, 1992; Marcus 1993;
Sanders 1977; Scarborough 1985; Rathje 1971). These models, while important,
are fundamentally grounded in cultural ecological and functionalist explanations
of complexity. And while there is some room within these frameworks for
historical interpretation, it seems that the assumptions underlying the appearance
of such a wide spread and complex social milieu to some degree homogenize
causal explanations of its emergence from a regional and historical perspective.
Other models of the emergence of lowland Maya complexity also point to
both production and exchange of local and exotic commodities and prestige items
as causal factors in the emergence of social complexity (see Andrews 1990;
Freidel 1979; Graham 1987, 1994; McKillop 1989). The importance of long
distance exchange and the social relations implied by such exchange are clear.
The movement of commodities suggests to some degree that economic
relationships are in a way removed from political relationships prevalent in the
local sphere (see Appadurai 1986; Brumfiel 1994; Clark and Blake 1994).
However, it is suggested here that symbolic forms produced on chert were not
commodities nor were they comprised of exotic raw material. Instead they are
prestige items produced on locally available raw material. The local sphere of
production and acquisition necessitates a consideration of the economy of
political relationships that were involved in their appearance archaeologically.
Both cultural ecological and exchange models have provided explanatory
frameworks in which to position particular historical manifestations (see also
Culbert 1991; Marcus 1993). At the same time, functionalist models also provide
97

a theoretical pivot for structural and symbolic interpretation of the localized
production and acquisition of material culture, in this case flaked stone symbols.
This interpretation in no way dismisses the importance of cultural ecological and
environmental factors, but instead focuses on material culture as a manifestation
of local technological and symbolic knowledges within a historically bounded
political economy. This economy of regional politics emerged in the eastern
lowlands during the Late Preclassic (400 BC- AD 300) and was the basis for
relationships that waxed and waned throughout the Classic Period (AD 300900). It is posited here that this political economy was not static in nature but saw
shifts in political and economic emphasis within a landscape of changing political
domination.
CRAFT SPECIALIZATION AND INTERPRETATIONS OF SOCIAL COMPLEXITY
A detailed overview of the now massive literature on craft specialization
is not possible here. However, what is possible is a basic review of the changes
archaeological perceptions of craft specialization have undergone. Early views
clearly saw the emergence of economic or occupational specialization as part of
the evolutionary precursor to urbanization and civilization. The standard unilinear
evolutionary view of the late 19th and early 20th century was profoundly altered in
part by the writings of V. Gordon Childe (Childe 1939, 1944, 1951). Childe
viewed the development of civilization and the city as correlated with the
emergence of full time craft specialists supported by an economic surplus (Childe
1951). However, as Childe (1951) asserted, and Wailes (1996) has more recently
articulated, the appearance of craft specialization also transformed society. New
technologies and the social relationships associated with those technologies
altered the way communities completed tasks and saw the world. Childeâs
approach was a radical departure from the unilinear evolutionary view, which saw

98

civilization as the latest in a series of stages that marked progression from the
savage to the civilized. As King (2000) has discussed, Childeâs view that
technology and production transform society is inherently dialectical and is based
in Marxâs materialist conception of history articulated in The Critique of Political
Economy (Marx 1933).
Prior to the work of Childe, who made the link between craft
specialization, social complexity, and internal differentiation between specialists
and non- specialists, functionalist models of social development were the basis for
interpreting the appearance of complexity. Early functionalist models in
anthropology were based in the writings of Durkheim (see also Giddens 1978),
who stressed the organic solidarity of society, in which institutions and norms
were established and maintained as adaptive responses (Durkheim 1984, 1995).
Functionalists were less concerned about evolutionary mechanisms, and instead
focused on the articulation of social institutions from a synchronic perspective
(Durkheim 1984, 1995; Radcliffe- Brown 1952).
As

functionalism

in

European

anthropology, Julian Steward (1955) was developing a multi- linear model of
culture change. Despite the evolutionary underpinnings, Steward, to some degree,
drew from the Boasian tradition that emerged in North America some 30 years
prior. Steward suggested that each society had its own evolutionary trajectory
based in environmental and ecological causation. Craft specialization was viewed
as part of a subsistence economy that was at least partially structured by the
natural environment (Steward 1955 as cited in King 2000: 5). The examination of
economy as part of a larger pattern of subsistence and settlement was the basis for
the emergence of cultural ecology and later systems theory, as explanatory
models in archaeology. Cultural ecology was linked to functionalist models in
that implied in each was the notion that society as a whole somehow searched out
99

and located equilibrium through processes of organic solidarity, and the
interrelatedness of all facets of that society.
In archaeology, recent interpretative frameworks put aside an evolutionary
typology and the notion of societal equilibrium (Hodder 1982, 1986; Shanks and
Tilley 1988; Tilley 1993). In these models, variation in archaeological contexts
illustrates how material culture is a dynamic part of social relationships in the
past. Ideology in the past and in the present is not epiphenomenal, but critical to
our interpretations. From this perspective, adaptation to the environment became
secondary to a focus on the social relations of production, or sense how
communities interacted in the production of material culture, and how material
culture actively participated in the negotiation of these relationships. (see Barthes
1987; Brumfiel 1992; Shanks and Tilley 1988; Tilley 1999).
In this respect, it is posited here that the emphasis on the social relations at
given historical moments can be classified under the rubric of political economy.
However, for the most part in archaeology as practiced in North America, the idea
of political economy has been ignored, as materialist conceptions were
appropriated by researchers who were interested in evolutionary trajectories and
long- term technological and economic process (see Binford 1962, 1983, 1989;
see also Sanders 1977; Sanders and Price 1968). The idea of the relations of
production, so critical to craft specialization, were considered secondary to
changing subsistence and production technologies. The emphasis on technology
and subsistence may be linked to the nature of the archaeological record, as
questions addressing the appearance of sedentism, domestication, and complex
society from this perspective presented a nearly infinite research potential (see
Trigger 1990). Researchers have also focused on defining types of craft
specialists, drawing on gradualist models that to some degree link both empirical
evidence and organization of production as it appears archaeologically to types of
100

craft specialization (Brumfiel and Earle 1987; Clark 1995; Clark and Parry 1990).
This includes defining independent and attached, or part time versus full time
craft specialization. However, despite serving as useful heuristic devices, these
terms have often become convenient pigeon- holes for labeling material
production across both cultural and archaeological contexts.
Craft specialization as well as the appearance of political centralization
and urbanism can be positioned in a developmental trajectory. But an integral part
of this trajectory must be a consideration of the relationships that shaped how
production and acquisition took place. Because the archaeological data perhaps
orients researchers towards questions of technology and form, when an
opportunity presents itself for a consideration of symbolic structure and ideology,
these approaches must be introduced to the data. The economy (economies) of
political relationships involved in production and acquisition must be considered.
The opportunity to consider locally produced prestige items on which important
ideological and symbolic information was inscribed presents itself in the
assemblages of flaked stone symbols analyzed in this study.
In order to position the class of material culture under study within a
framework of craft specialization, we must look at the relations of production and
acquisition that set the craft community apart. By looking at the technological and
symbolic knowledges employed in the production of flaked stone symbols, we
can begin to formulate how particular specialized craft activities and the
relationships that necessitated production as both transformative and historically
emergent. It is at this point we must expand the definition of community so that it
does not just refer to a geographic place where production was undertaken.
Instead, we can think of community as individuals or groups of individuals who
produced flaked stone symbols and the immediate and extended family with
whom they were associated on a daily, as well as a less frequent basis.
101

Moreover, we must disentangle functionalist notions that production and
acquisition were solely part of a process of elite social control. Instead the
knowledge embodied in the forms show that craft communities also exercised a
certain amount of political power and no doubt exercised political agendas of
their own, both adhering to and resisting political domination. Crafters also often
possess specific relationships with individuals involved in local or long distance
exchange (see Helms 1993; Brumfiel 1994).
In considering these relationships, we must also consider that functional
differentiation and organic solidarity are signposts for social complexity (King
2000). In the Maya area, the study of the emergence of complex society has a
long history. Again, a review of the immense literature on the origins of Maya
civilization cannot be dealt with here. However, in general, the trends can be
framed from two perspectives. The first is the notion of hierarchy, as structures
that centralized social and political economic power emerged in response to
environmental and (or) population pressures. This centralization resulted in
apparent functional differentiation (Sanders and Price 1968; Sanders and Webster
1988). Social and political structures as evidenced in the archaeology are assumed
to be uniform in communities at every level in the hierarchy. In the Maya area,
this had repercussions in recognizing that functional distinctions could be made
between large âregal- ritual centersâ and second and third order sites (Sanders and
Webster 1988). Namely, the assumption that there were no functional distinctions
at levels below large centers (King and Potter 1994: 66). The evidence of lithic
production at the site of Colha directly contradicted the assumption that small
centers were simply reflections of larger centers.
The second perspective is based in the notion of heterarchy, a concept that
first appeared in the archaeological literature through Carole Crumley (1987).
Crumley asserted that hierarchy and complexity were often conflated by
102

archaeologists (Crumley 1987). Instead, Crumley proposed that communities
exhibited both functional variability and interdependence. In this sense, societies
are functionally differentiated horizontally, as communities possessed significant
economic differences, but were often under the political hegemony of their
neighbors. The concept of heterarchy allowed for the consideration of functional
differentiation at the site level. Indeed, the notion that there is functional
differentiation between communities within sites provides a framework for
consideration of emergent craft communities within and between larger sites.
Simultaneously, part of the functionalist paradigm is an implicit
assumption of a rational subject. This assumes, at some basic level, humans
display a rationality recognized across cultural and (or) historical contexts. This
assumption must be confronted so that we can begin to look at ideological
structures that condition historically and culturally bound precepts of ârationalâ.
We can draw from the recent archaeological literature that has begun to recognize
that culture is historically emergent and is negotiated by individuals and
communities within broad structural frameworks (Hodder ed. 1982, 1986; Shanks
and Tilley 1988; Tilley 1993: 6).
The process of production of both material culture and ideology and the
negotiation of specific relations between individuals and communities provides a
counter to the narrative that culture or society is always moving towards some
implicit equilibrium. By reflexing between the structural frameworks and the
individual or agents that operate within them, we can begin to implement a
dialectical and historical approach to the analysis of material culture, as part of a
larger process of cultural production (Giddens 1979, 1984; Bourdieu 1977, 1990;
Robb 1998; Tilley 1993: 8).
If we can consider material culture to be an integral part of a historical
process of cultural production, we can begin to consider the relationships that led
103

to contexts of final deposition. The technology and symbolism inscribed on
individual artifacts hint at what might be termed complex material cultural
histories that lead to how the artifact is viewed by the archaeologist. The
production and acquisition of material culture necessitated an economy of social
and political relationships. Within the milieu of Classic Period Maya society,
these relationships were likely complex and shifting, expedient and negotiated. In
some cases these relationships may have defied rationality as we recognize it.
They may have been part of a larger process of fragmentation and dissolution
rather than integration or political centralization. With respect to flaked stone
artifacts inscribed with a complex symbolism, we must begin to consider how
they arrived at their contexts of final deposition via the political economic
relationships that led to interment.
CLASSIC PERIOD MAYA SOCIAL AND POLITICAL ORGANIZATION
Over the last several decades, archaeologists conducting research in the
Maya area have turned their attention to the social and political organization of
society that appeared during the Late Preclassic and the Classic Periods (400 BCAD 900). Problems with such an examination stem from the nature of
archaeological data as well as theoretical constructs that bound our inquiries.
What has become clear is that there is no monolithic entity of ancient Maya social
organization (Sharer 1993: 90). Instead Maya social organization is comprised of
gradients and contrasts in organizational form. Large scale and normative
conceptions are inadequate. Regional and local social organizations were part of a
larger dynamic flux (Sharer 1993: 91).
The way that Classic Period society is divided most frequently by
archaeologists is between the elite and the non- elite (A. Chase 1992: 31;
Thompson 1966, 1970). If we base social stratification on the access to

104

differential resources based on a number of social processes such as inheritance,
marriage, and (or) rank, the question that remains is whether these patterns can be
recognized in the archaeological and material culture record? And, how can these
patterns be used to interpret social organization? One useful way might be to
begin with a consideration of craft specialization, and the diversity of craft
specialists necessary for cultural production in a complex society. If we can begin
to infer divisions between communities based on dynamic and expedient political
relationships as well as technological knowledge, we might then view
differentiation of craft specialists based on material culture class. This involves
making the leap to accepting that relations of production and acquisition of
material culture occurred in a far different social context than that represented in
contexts of final deposition.
As Sharer (1993) has articulated, there were likely many gradations and
divisions between and across both elite and non- elite. In the Late Classic, faction
and alliance were an important part of dynamic and changing political
relationships that were both the cause and the result of conflict (Pohl and Pohl
1994). Burial patterns show evidence of internal rankings of both the elite and the
non- elite (A. Chase 1992: 40; Chase and Chase 1992). Families and site centers
were linked by marriage (Grube 1994: personal communication). This suggests
that immediate family and larger kin groups exhibited locational relationships.
These localities were likely linked to the supernatural with descent lines forming
a critical part of the distribution of power and property (Sharer 1993). Along these
lines, it may be useful to consider technological knowledge similar to material
objects and even land that comprised an ancestral birthright.
We know that the Maya followed descent primarily through patrilineage
lines marked by the sharing of a common surname that linked kin groups with
patron deities, family heads, and concomitant social and political obligations
105

(Schele and Freidel 1990; Marcus 1993; Sharer 1993; Thompson 1966). In terms
of the Classic Maya elite, we have evidence from Copan Altar Q of patrilineal
decent lines (Sharer 1993). However, women were also politically important in
elite families (Schele and Freidel 1990). Coe (1965) also argues for bilateral
descent based on prestige of the mother or fathers family. This likelihood makes
models of social organization quite complicated. Non- elite household
organization, it has been posited, also followed multiple generations within an
extended family. These models show a common pattern of domestic settlement
that manifested archaeologically as plazuela groups, also recognized as corporate
groups (see Lohse 2001).
In terms of larger political organization, Joyce Marcus (1993) has
articulated a model of lowland Maya polities based on ethnohistorical, epigraphic,
and archaeological evidence. She positions the model as stemming from two
competing interpretations, one being regional uniformity and the other localized
diversity. Both approaches to Maya political organization stem from notions of
powerful centralized states with administrative hierarchies controlling large
numbers of political units that can be linked to functionalist notions of organic
solidarity, as opposed to hundreds of small units or city states exhibiting a form of
mechanical solidarity (Marcus 1993: 111).
As we now know, Classic Maya centers were urban centers that attracted
people from the surrounding areas for both religious and political events and
economic opportunity. Thompsonâs (1966) religious center model was dispelled
by the comprehensive settlement survey undertaken by the Tikal Project that
showed a large population at one time lived in close proximity of the site center
(Haviland 1966, 1969; Puleston 1974). At the same time the notion that large
Maya sites served as urban centers was realized, epigraphic evidence showed that
hieroglyphic writing systems were recording the histories of the ruling dynasty. In
106

the iconography, it was recognized that scenes of warfare were depicted, and that
large regional states likely existed (Adams and Jones 1981). The regional state
model was supported by the decipherment of place or location names in
hieroglyphic text on monuments across regions (Mathews 1985; Schele and
Mathews 1991).
Marcus (1993: 111- 113) asserts that static models are insufficient for an
explanation of ancient Maya political organization. Instead, scholars need to
account for change over time. Moreover, feudal models are also insufficient,
failing to take into account the particular social and political economic structures
existing in historical context. Instead Marcus holds that we must look toward
ethnohistorical accounts, both in the northern Yucatan and in Belize during the
16th and 17th century to interpret the way Classic Period civilization may have
been organized.
By AD 534, Maya civilization exhibited every characteristic of complex
society, and probably had for some 500 years previously. In this sense, Maya
civilization could be classified as an archaic state, namely a society that was
stratified and highly centralized with internal occupational and craft specialization
and a powerful ruling class that waged war and exacted tribute. The control of
information and labor was more centralized than ranked chiefdoms. The
centralization of the control of labor by the elite marked the shift from complex
chiefdoms to archaic states. Despite possessing these characteristics, it is
important to remember that Classic Period society also manifested internal
contradictions, local resistance to political domination, and dynamic and changing
political alliances and factions. The Maya archaic states can be defined as
exhibiting endogamous strata divided into elites and commoners, a well as an
enveloped ideology of stratification, a four tiered hierarchy of settlement, and a
hierarchy of authority within settlements (Marcus 1993: 114- 115).
107

By the 5th and 6th centuries, elite residential units in the site center
classified as palaces were present. A critical ingredient in the Marcus model is the
concept of hierarchy. This is not a static conception, but is instead based on
shifting political relationships and diversity of function at the local level shown
by the Itza and Cocom confederacies documented by the Spanish in the early 16th
century. In this context, variable hierarchies existed that show all centers did not
have the same political or economic function. When we can begin to see
variability in political hierarchies, we can begin to consider a heterarchical model,
where differing contexts reflect different kinds of hierarchies (Crumley 1987;
King and Potter 1994). However, in the Marcus model, political hierarchy based
in the elite remains as a point of departure for articulating political organization.
Marcus (1993) utilizes the political configuration of the northern Yucatan
during the 16th century as an ethnohistoric example that evidences the existence
of a Maya nation. Historically, it is documented that the inhabitants of the Peten
Itza region, located far to the south, spoke of a single empire under the rulership
of a multepal that existed several generations prior to the arrival of the Spanish,
during the reign of Chichen Itza (Marcus 1993: 115). Later, political unification
under the realm of Mayapan and the confederation of 16 provinces extended from
AD 1250- AD 1450. Marcus asserts, I think correctly, that the dynamic process of
political unification and break- up can be extended back in time.
Warfare and competition were both present within and between provinces
of Mayapan. Marcus refers to a vocabulary of terms that refer to geographic areas
and corresponding political rulers. Marcus points out key terms that define
different portions of a polity (Marcus 1993: 118- 120). These terms include but
are not limited to luum/luumil, defined as homeland, and ahulil/baalcab/cab
defined as a kingdom or polity. There were also political personnel hierarchies
such as: ahau, halach uinic, batab, nacom, and holcanob. During the later years at
108

Mayapan, treachery between the ruling families of Xiu- Mani and Cocom- Zotuta
resulted in a weakening of the confederacy and subsequent political dissolution
(Marcus 1993: 119).
Marcus holds that a specified group of batabil, or towns, was the most
stable political unit through time. This political unit is defined as a province
(Marcus 1993: 125). Ethnohistorical evidence originates from the Peten, and the
Itza rulership centered at the site of Tayasal. At Tayasal, Canek, the halach uinic
of the Peten was ruler of a quadripartite political division comprised of 22
districts or towns that were subject to the halach uinic. This political hierarchy
was to some degree, distinct from economic hierarchy. This economic hierarchy
may have been part of a specialization among towns from which specific kinds of
tribute were exacted. However, there were also overlaps in the form of political
relationships between economically specialized towns or even perhaps,
communities and the elite (see Marcus 1993: 120- 123).
A dynamic model of Classic Period political organization emphasizes a
series of oscillations, with consolidation and dissolution of large scale polities
occurring at specific junctures through time (Marcus 1993: 121). The political
hierarchy included large regional states, provinces, head towns, dependent towns,
villages, and hamlets. Each political center weathered periods of dissolution and
consolidation. Working back in time, Marcus asserts that Chichen Itza and the
Puuc Hills polities such as Uxmal, Mul Chic, Edzna, Kabah, and Sayil were
engaged in political alliances that spanned across the northern Yucatan by AD
800- AD 950.
After AD 950 the political situation in the Yucatan was changing rapidly
as alliances forged between regional lineages brought a centralized political
hierarchy to Chichen Itza. In the southern lowlands centralized areas had already
lost any regional political authority, warfare was rampant, and centers were being
109

sacked and abandoned (see Culbert 1973; Kowalski 1987: 238). Evidence of
social disintegration is evident at Colha in the form and contents of what has been
termed the skull pit (Mock 1994). This archaeological context is a mass grave of
30 skulls. The collective interment was discovered in the central precinct at the
site (Massey 1994; Steele et al. 1991). The skull pit has been interpreted to be the
execution of an elite family and has been dated to AD 850 (Mock 1994: 221).
Evidence of endemic warfare is also evident to the west, in the Petexbatun region
of Guatemala. Site centers along the Pasion River at Dos Pilas, Aguateca,
Tamarandito and other sites exhibit archaeological evidence of fortifications (see
also Demarest 1992).
Using the ethnohistoric data, Marcus (1993) posits that the province was
the most stable political unit of the Classic Period. This position is based on the
notion that when political integration was at its peak, large regional centers,
secondary centers, towns, and villages were politically allied under the authority
of a powerful ruler (ahau) and a number powerful of lineages. At particular
moments, secondary centers pulled away from regional capitals and the regional
state deteriorated to a lower level of political integration, perhaps at the provincial
level. Provinces were comprised of loosely allied towns and cities one of which
often rose to become a political center in this cyclical process.
Marcus posits that even earlier in time, from AD 292- 434 during Baktun
8 in the southern Maya lowlands, there was not a clearly defined four tiered
hierarchy of sites, but instead what preceded, which was a number of autonomous
provinces (Marcus 1976: 191). The earliest example of regional integration was
the regional state that formed from the alliance between Tikal and Uaxactun.
Marcus points to glyphic similarity of the emblem glyphs at Tikal and a number
of second order sites, such as Hol Cah. By Baktun 9 (AD 514- 534) there was
what appears to be a standardized symbol system that was present over a wide
110

area (i.e. the emblem glyph) (see Mathews 1985; Schele and Mathews 1991).
Over the course of the next millennium, consolidation and dissolution of lowland
Maya polities into both larger and smaller units occurred. By the 16th century,
Spanish historians were describing politically integrated regional polities in the
northern Yucatan as nations.
The question of political economic hegemony of centers comes into play.
Certainly during the Classic Period, Tikal was a first order political center with
large, second order centers such as Naranjo held under the sway of Tikalâs elite.
By AD 682, the hieroglyphic texts refer to a woman who comes to Naranjo from
Tikal and marries a ruler there, thus solidifying the alliance (Marcus 1993; Chase
and Chase 1987, eds., 1994). To the west, in the Usamacinta region, the
hieroglyphic texts at Bonampak tell of a woman coming from Yaxchilan and
marrying a male from Bonampak. By AD 757 Yaxchilan and Piedras Negras
forge an alliance (Marcus 1993). Of course the problem with these texts is that
they are, indeed the history of the elites. With respect to the nuances of political
domination and resistance, numerous questions still remain.
In terms of economic specialization, craft specialists exhibited an
important role in the process of cultural production during Classic Period Maya
society. Craft specialization is critical to understanding both production and
political economy (Fry and Cox 1974; Gibson 1989; Shafer and Hester 1983,
1991; McAnany 1989). Marcus (1993) draws on ethnohistorical and
archaeological evidence from both the Near East and China to support the
ethnohistorical evidence from the Maya area. Both of these regions of the world
saw the development of elaborate archaic states (see also Marcus 1983, 1995).
In the Near East example, the city of Ur saw craft specialists concentrated
in one area of the city, while peripheral villages were primarily oriented toward
agricultural production (Stein and Blackman 1993). In the example from rural
111

China, as well as an example in Mesoamerica at Monte Alban, the first order city
depended on outlying villages where specialists in metal working, potting, stone
working, and other crafts were concentrated. As the massive evidence of lithic
production visible at Colha, Belize shows, it appears the Classic Period Maya
possessed a similar system (King and Potter 1994; Marcus 1993: 145). The
question of the political and economic relationships between lower and higher
order centers in the eastern Maya lowlands will be addressed below. These
relationships are the basis for political economy referenced in the title of this
chapter.
Whatever the complexities of elite political intrigue, the integration and
dissolution of political alliances in the Maya lowlands was a dynamic process.
Marcus (1993) constructs a four tiered hierarchy and applies it to the Tikal
example with links to the Petexbatun. However, Tikalâs influence in the Ixcanrio
region in the northeast Peten was equally powerful (Adams 1990). As Marcus
(1993) posits, the rulers of secondary centers (batabob) were always trouble for
the elite of the primary centers. Marcus also uses the Pasion Region of the Peten
as an example, citing the rise of Seibal, which was a lower order center that rose
in the hierarchy, and by AD 849 was a powerful dynastic seat of political power.
In the Montagua Valley, glyphic evidence exists for a similar process that
occurred between Copan and Quirigua during the 8th century AD (Marcus 1993;
Sharer 1978). Marcus (1993) points to Stela A, which she posits exhibits emblem
glyphs of the sites of Copan, Tikal, Calakmul, and Palenque. This is the
quadripartite model that Marcus posits were the four primary centers during the
rule of 18 Rabbit at Copan (AD 731).
Marcus (1993) argues for a central place model with a hierarchy of
primary and peripheral second order centers that provided goods and labor (see
also Christaller 1966). The central place model can be applied to the Maya
112

lowlands during the Classic Period, with hexagons placed around regional
centers. In sum, a 30 km distance between primary and second order centers is a
relatively close match to the ideal as presented by Christaller (1966)(Marcus
1993: 154). The central place model contrasts with the thiessen polygon model
that measures a political unit as half the distance between a large site and its
neighbor (Hammond 1974, 1975; Mathews 1985). The presence of large sites
around Tikal suggests the model is inadequate, as the political boundary of Tikal
would lie somewhere in the cityâs settlement zone. Marcus (1993) holds that the
thiessen polygon as presented by Hammond (1974) is not possible because it
allots the same size territory to centers that are clearly not equal politically.
Marcusâ (1993) dynamic model posits that cycles of integration and
dissolution began in AD 534 and proceeded to the Contact Period. During this
time, the province, or collection of towns, is the largest unit that exhibited long
term stability. The most dynamic political unit were the second order centers, that
moved to both up and down the political hierarchy, as evidenced by monument
construction or site expansion following conflict or marriage (see also Pohl and
Pohl 1994). In general, the stability of the Classic Period has been assumed to a
large degree. In contrast, both the Classic and Postclassic Periods can be viewed
as a continuous series of peaks and troughs as regional states broke down and
reconfigured. As Marcus asserts, the grand collapse of Maya civilization is an
artifact of archaeology, but has little to do with what actually happened (Marcus
1993: 167).
While Marcusâs model is implicitly functional and organic, it is neither
static nor trending toward equilibrium. Whether the site hierarchy and the
breakdown of distances between centers within the hierarchy can be applied
across the Maya lowlands is another matter. What must also be questioned is the
usefulness of applying an abstract model to particular regions and sites. The
113

degree to which the model explains the cycles of breakdown of political and
economic relationships must also be assessed. Neither does the model articulate
the political relationships that existed between centers that were clearly (or not so
clearly) aligned. Moreover, it appears to be overly dependent on the glyphic texts
to âproveâ the validity of the model. Perhaps most useful about the model is that
it serves as a point of departure for historicizing regional political alliances that
must be examined to understand regional developments through time.
POLITICAL ECONOMY AND CULTURAL PRODUCTION
The notion that lowland Maya centers were engaged in dynamic political
alliances can serve as a point of departure for looking at a particular region of the
lowlands, such as that of northern Belize, in the eastern lowlands. In order to
disentangle the appearance of a class of material culture such as flaked stone
symbols in elite cache and burial contexts with the relationships that necessitated
their production and acquisition, we must begin to consider a local political
economy, defined as the relationships that exist between communities with
differing access to resources and power (Roseberry 1989).
The concept of political economy also depends on the idea of political
hierarchy and the socioeconomic division of labor. It is posited here that flaked
stone symbols were part of an economy of social and political relationships that
cannot be explained solely by tribute extraction or commodity exchange. While
goods such as agricultural products, utilitarian tool forms, and utilitarian ceramics
may have been transferred as commodities through market places, elaborate
material items were likely dependent on other forms of acquisition. Moreover, the
acquisition of prestige items of local origin likely contrasted with the acquisition
of items produced on exotic raw material, such as jade or obsidian.

114

At the same time, we also have to consider the process of cultural
production from a historical perspective. Cultural production is an overarching
term for the historical process that intertwines social relations, ideology, and
material objects as part of a broader process of producing and reproducing the
power relations that naturalize a power hierarchy (see Bourdieu 1977, 1990;
Giddens 1984). An integral part of the process of cultural production is the mode
by which power relations are transferred, negotiated, and resisted.
During the Late Preclassic and Protoclassic Periods, we know that
regional urban centers under the authority of local elites were establishing
themselves through the control of labor, the construction of public architecture,
the commissioning of public art in the form of carved stone, as well as through
the acquisition of material culture such as elaborately painted ceramics, carved
jades, obsidian, and to some degree flaked stone symbols (see Gibson 1989;
Scarborough 1985). The elites and those that were allied with them, legitimated
their positions of power through large scale pageants, public feasting, and
seasonal festival scheduled via a ritual calendar that had both historical and
religious antecedents. Public displays linked the supernatural with political and
historical events such as accession to power and (or) the death of an important
personage.
Maya art, in many instances, depicts an iconography of power that
naturalizes the role of the elite and the relationship of the elite with deities, the
cosmic order, transformation, and the power of the Otherworld, the mythical
place of Maya creation (see Schele and Miller 1986). The commissioning of such
elaborate works of art and architecture in the service of the state was likely
brought about by a complex series of political alliances and obligations, as well as
the exacting of tribute in the form of labor and commodities, such as agricultural
products and utilitarian goods (Sharer 1993, 1994).
115

Art in the service of the state and in the form of an iconography of power
was both representative of the process of legitimation, as well as constitutive in
terms of structuring how crafters, artisans, the elites, and peasant farmers
perceived the world around them. An important part of the process of legitimating
power originates from political- economic relationships. The cultural practice that
certain quantities of maize were due at certain times of certain yearly cycles was
more likely than not, unquestioned by peasant farmers. Moreover, the artisans and
craft specialists who produced the images so critical to the legitimation and
naturalization of the elite order, and to whom they were closely bound, did so
with an expectation inherent in any cultural context. Aside from the desire to
express a kind of knowledge that craft and art satisfies in those who practice it,
there was also motivation stemming from desire for both political and material
favor. At the same time, the complexity of the artistic depictions illustrates a
profound historical and symbolic knowledge that members of these communities
were able to exercise. It is posited here that the inter- generational exercise of this
knowledge manifested a situation where, at some point, craft and artisan
communities were able to recognize the conditions of their own domination.
POLITICAL ECONOMY, CRAFT SPECIALIZATION, THE EASTERN LOWLANDS
In the eastern Maya lowlands, the appearance of one dominant center is in
doubt, not only because the sites in this regions do not exhibit extensive
hieroglyphic texts, but also because there are such a plethora of what Marcus
might term second order sites in the region (Hammond 1974, 1981; Scarborough
1985). There is little doubt that during the Classic Period, elites at many of these
sites were engaged in dynamic political relationships. Indeed, the correlation of
architectural and material culture at the sites of Altun Ha and Lamanai, suggests

116

that political alliances between the elites at each center were in place by the early
part of the Late Classic (see Pendergast 1992, 1998).
With respect to lithic production, centers like Altun Ha and Lamanai are
located on the periphery of what has been termed the chert- bearing zone, where
the chert for both utilitarian and symbolic lithic forms originated. With the
intensive investigations at Colha, we know that this relatively small, rural center
had developed into a community whose inhabitants were participating in large
scale production of utilitarian chert implements for local use and export (Shafer
and Hester 1983, 1991; Hester and Shafer 1994; King and Potter 1994). One of
the more reasonable explanations for the distribution of Colha products has been
proposed by Hester and Shafer (1994) and tested by Dockall and Shafer (1991)
and McAnany (1989, 1989a).
The producer- consumer model arises from the notion that specific sites
were responsible for producing lithic implements and regional sites were
consuming them for local activities. Moreover, non- utilitarian, symbolic forms
such as the stemmed macroblade were being produced for export outside of the
region, to sites in the Peten and in southern Campeche and Yucatan (see Hester
and Shafer 1994).
Gibson (1989) posited that the elaboration of non- utilitarian forms
marked the appearance of an increasingly complex political hierarchy in the
eastern lowlands during the Late Preclassic Period. This elaboration resulted in
the acquisition of locally produced non- utilitarian forms for ritual consumption.
In this sense, both stemmed macroblades and flaked stone symbols were produced
at Colha for export (Dockall and Shafer 1991; Gibson 1989; Hester and Shafer
1994). The appearance of finely flaked bifacial symbolic forms in cache and
burial contexts at Colha is clearly the earliest appearance of flaked stone symbols
(eccentrics) in the eastern lowlands (400 BC- 250 AD). However, as Shafer and
117

Hester (1983, 1991) have asserted, that by the end of the Late Preclassic lithic
production at Colha may have declined as utilitarian forms associated with the
earlier time frame are no longer present.
During the latter part of the Early Classic (AD 500- 600), elaborate flaked
stone symbols appear in tomb and cache contexts at Altun Ha (Pendergast 1979,
1982, 1990). The chronological gap that exists between the limited number of
forms that occurred in Late Preclassic and Protoclassic contexts at Colha and the
numerous forms in Early Classic contexts at Altun Ha begs the question of where
production of flaked stone symbols was undertaken. We now know that during
the Late Classic (AD 600- AD 900), there was a marked re- organization of
production at Colha and likely at other sites in or near the chert- bearing zone. As
Shafer and Hester (1983, 1991) have articulated, large deposits of lithic
production debris have been observed at rural areas located to the north of Altun
Ha, in a settlement area known as Chicawate. Two surveys conducted in the early
1980âs and in the mid 1990âs by Kelly (1982) and Meadows (1997) resulted in
the documentation of production debris and finished utilitarian products, as well
as ceramics that date tentatively to the Late Classic Period.
Shafer and Hester (1983, 1991) posit that the production of utilitarian
lithic implements shifted to Chicawate and other small sites located in close
proximity to Altun Ha, from Colha, during the Late Classic Period due to the
emergent political hegemony of Altun Ha. On a smaller scale, this is a similar
process described in Marcusâs (1993) model discussed above. As the elite at
Altun Ha consolidated their power, residents from the region may have moved
into the areas surrounding the center. At the same time, the archaeological
evidence tells us that lithic production declined at Colha. The area around Altun
Ha, located at the southern end of the chert- bearing zone, became the focus of the
production of utilitarian lithic implements. Indeed, during the Early Classic (AD
118

250- AD 600) the large scale production of flaked stone symbols at workshop
localities outside the site center, at Chicawate or more likely, within the site
center, was being undertaken utilizing macroblade and macroflake- blade
technology, developed nearly a millennium earlier at Colha. This technology was
elaborated by the crafters with perhaps more recently acquired historical and
symbolic knowledges (Gibson 1989).
In terms of political economy, it is critical to consider the process of
acquisition, by the elite, of prestige items produced on locally available raw
material. The fact that these items were prestige items is clear with respect to their
contexts of final deposition, in tombs and elite burials and caches in the
monumental center, first at Colha, then at Altun Ha, and later in large axial caches
at Lamanai. It is posited here that these items were acquired during large- scale
gift exchanges between elites. Local elites likely acquired them from the lithic
crafters via a similar, perhaps less elaborate process of gift exchanges and
feasting. It is posited that these exchanges were part of elaborate regimes of gift
exchange within and between communities possessing differential access to
wealth and power.
In this sense, we can look to anthropology for explanations of political
economic relationships that had little, if nothing to do with market exchange or
subsistence economy. Instead, the acquisition of flaked stone symbols is
considered as part of a process of cultural production, in which social meaning
was transferred from crafter to possessor. The technological and symbolic
knowledges that elevated the crafter were part of a complex web of political
relationships that the elite established with numerous communities of artisans and
craft specialists. The transfer of possession of these objects was a powerful form
of ideological legitimation. At the same time it was an implicit acknowledgment
of obligation between the crafter and the elite recipient.
119

In one of the most important works in anthropology The Gift, Marcel
Mauss (1966) examines the forms of gift exchange seen in what he terms
primitive societies. Perhaps most clearly, Mauss emphasizes the cyclical process
of gift giving and receiving, which he defines as prestation. Prestation existed and
exists in different forms in both simple and complex societies. In the context of
The Gift, the complex societies included in the analysis could be termed nonurban and non- capitalist complex societies. In examining the acquisition of
prestige items among these societies, Mauss asserts:
In the systems of the past we do not find simple exchange of goods,
wealth, and produce through markets established among individuals.
For it is groups, and not individuals, which carry on exchange, make
contracts, and are bound by obligation; the persons represented in the
contracts are moral persons- clans, tribes, and families; the groups, or
the chiefs as intermediaries for the groups, confront and oppose each
other. Further, what they exchange is not exclusively goods and wealth,
real and personal property, and things of economic value. They exchange
rather courtesies, entertainment, ritual, military assistance, women,
children, dances, and feasts; and fairs in which market is but one element
and the circulation of wealth but one part of a wide and enduring
contract (Mauss 1966: 3).
It is clear that Classic Period Maya society exhibited all the complexities
of state level social organization, including urban centers. However, it is
important to separate complexity with implicit assumptions of capitalist economic
organization. It is posited here that flaked stone symbols were not acquired via a
market system or production in concert with abstract laws of supply and demand.
Instead, flaked stone symbols were produced and acquired as part of the process
of obligation and tribute that was undertaken in the context of public political and
religious events, and more restricted elite feasting events. While commodity

120

exchange may have occurred at some level, there is no evidence that a market
system existed. And while market places likely did, the exchange that occurred
within their confines was not part of a capitalist mode of production and
exchange. Instead, the production of flaked stone symbols was likely part of a
number of carefully tended relationships based on the desire to gain and transfer
prestige (see Shafer and Hester 1991: 93).
Mauss (1966: 31) employs observations among the Tlingit and Haida,
groups occupying coastal areas of the Pacific Northwest of North America, to
articulate the definition of agonistic prestation, also known more commonly as the
potlatch. These groups, although not state level societies, were certainly complex
in material culture production, political organization, and ideology. Both the
Tlingit and Haida passed much of the winter season in festival, in banquets, fairs,
and markets. During these times, many events were undertaken such as marriage,
initiation, and ritual festival focused on shamanic trances (Mauss 1966: 34).
During festival, widespread and to some degree competitive gift exchange took
place. Mauss defines these exchanges as total prestations that are agonistic in
form. The exchanges are usurious and extravagant, and are inherently competitive
in terms of garnering prestige in the amount of material culture given.
Similarly, Mauss identified a form of total prestation also appearing also
in Melanesia and Papua, New Guinea. However, prestation appears in less radical
forms in West Africa, Polynesia, and Malaya (Mauss 1966). Mauss uses an
example from Western Samoa to contrast agonistic versus non- agonistic forms of
prestation. Samoan society exhibited total prestation that are non- agonistic, or
non- competitive. This system of contractual gifts is present in marriage,
childbirth, sickness, puberty, and funeral ceremonies. The honor conferred by
wealth is conceptualized as the term mana, which defines both authority and
wealth (Mauss 1966: 6).
121

More importantly, ritualized or contractual gifting is based in the
repetitive cycle of giving and receiving. This kind of exchange is perhaps most
clearly defined in Maori society by the term, toanga. Toanga is a term that is
defined as the spirit of the thing given. A more general term of the spirit of things
is hau. The toanga is the thing given, but hau is the spirit that travels with the
toanga and remains with each possessor of the object (Mauss 1966: 9). Thus, the
toanga must be returned in order for hau to remain with the giver. A return gift
thus gives the donor authority and power of the original donor, who becomes the
recipient. This is the critical point in how obligation is defined by the Maori.
The notion of gifting linked to public feasting and political obligation has
relevance among the ancient Maya. Bishop Diego de Landa recorded observations
of extravagant feasting and gift exchange in the northern Yucatan as late as the
16th century (Tozzer 1941: 92). Recently, LeCount (1999) assesses the appearance
of polychrome painted pottery in varying archaeological contexts at the site of
Xunantunich. LeCount asserts that as local political conditions changed in the
Late Classic Period, elites changed the common strategy of displaying wealth and
prestige items. LeCount posits that the elites instead funneled elaborately
decorated pottery through local political hierarchy (LeCount 1999: 239).
If we can begin to view flaked stone symbols as prestige items of local
origin, then we can assume that they were part of elite displays of wealth during
ritual and other activities. However, we still are left with the question of
acquisition. How were these items acquired within the context of crafter and elite
political relationships? Thus, the focus is not on elite political strategies, but on
the process of acquisition.
Mauss (1966) posits that a critical part of the economy and morality of the
gift are gifts made to men in the sight of the gods and nature. This has relevance
for the symbolic and supernatural forms embodied in the assemblages of flaked
122

stone symbols under study here. The broadest motivation for giving and return
giving is the power of the gods, the spirit of the thing becomes the motivation for
the cycle of exchange and obligation to continue. However, in his critique of The
Gift Godelier (1999) disputes the translation of hau, which Godelier states was
more specific in terms of by what form hau remains with a gift donor. Godelier
asserts that gift exchange is part of a moral code that relates to obligation
(Godelier 1999: 29). Mauss posited that the spirits of the gods and the dead are
the true owners of material possessions. This interpretation moves toward
ideological first principles, which cannot be verified or falsified.
One of the groups that have been written about extensively in
anthropology with respect to obligation and exchange is the Trobriand people.
From the genesis of anthropology, Trobriand society, and more specifically, their
tradition of the kula ring have been of interest to anthropologists researching
exchange in so- called primitive society (Malinowski 1921, Mauss 1966, Godelier
1999; Weiner 1992). While certainly a complex society, Trobriand society could
never be considered state- level. However, the kula ring does present an
interesting point of departure for a discussion of gift exchange in complex
societies.
Broadly speaking, the process by which a number of gifts are given
includes gifts of varying value (Mauss 1966). The system has critical political
overtones, and the institution has mythical, religious, and magical aspects. The
gifted objects are comprised of armbands comprised of shells, necklaces,
ornaments, and weapons. Mauss (1966) quotes a common spell among the
Trobrianders in which the kula partner is an animal, which the caster of the spell
invokes to bring him necklaces.

123

Crocodile fall down, take thy man, push him down under the canoe.
Crocodile, bring me the necklace bring me the bagidou (the shell
necklace), the bagirikuâ¦ (Mauss 1966: 23)
As Mauss asserts, the kula is the most solemn part of a vast system of
prestation and counter- prestation which embraces the whole social life of the
Trobrianders. Thus, the element of the gift is the obligation to receive and the
obligation to give. As well, among indigenous groups of North America, the
objects cannot be separated from the persons who exchange them. The
communion, alliance and obligation are indissoluble (Mauss 1966: 31). These
alliances are embodied as giving, receiving, and repaying.
Moving from then contemporary ethnography to the ethnohistoric past,
Mauss points to Hindu legal documents that articulate the theory of the
dandharma or law of the gift (Mauss 1966: 57). In the Hindu context, land, foods,
or other items that are given away are personified, and the item itself takes part in
the contract. Another example is garnered from Chinese law, which recognizes
the indissoluble bond of a thing with its original owner. This can also be applied
to property. A right of pursuit is established over the thing combined with a right
of pursuit of over its owner. Due to the thing that was transmitted, the alliance
contracted is not temporary, and the parties are bound in continuous
interdependence (Mauss 1966: 61- 62). The economy of gift exchange fails to
conform to the laws of natural economy or utilitarianism. These are often
disregarded in assessments of economic process among the ancient Maya.
Weiner (1992) has also elaborated upon the notion of gift and countergift. Her critique asserts that the norm of systemic reciprocity can be traced to
capitalist economic theory defined by Adam Smith (1937). Smith held that a
market economy tended toward equilibrium if legal codes were not harnessing its
operation or progress. A natural exchange value for material goods would then be
124

established. This exchange value was the natural state for the accumulation of
wealth. Thus, in the context of native or primitive societies, living without legal
codes, anthropologists attempted to establish fixed and rational acts that resulted
in a particular object obtaining a certain exchange value. This process could then
be recorded ethnographically (Weiner 1992). As Mauss articulates in the Maori
example, hau stays with the possessor of an original gift, and was the motivating
factor for exchange. As has been argued, this elevated ideology to a level of first
principles, and the fundamental problems arise with this kind of teleology. The
spirit of the object motivates both gift and counter gift.
As Weiner argues, we must acknowledge that cosmology acts directly on
social life, mediating societies unresolved problems (Weiner 1992: 5). However,
we must also continue to ask how power is constituted through cosmological
legitimacy. This precludes the notion that cosmology, despite acting as a powerful
constitutive mode of thought, is the reason for the gift and the counter gift.
Instead, we must examine relations of power that are particular to specific cultural
contexts, and yet ubiquitous and constitutive in their own right. Efforts to
accumulate power comprise a culturally internal logic that is at the foundation of
gift and counter gift. Exchange value is not determined by cosmological links
(Weiner 1992: 6- 9).
Weiner (1992) asserts that the paradox of keeping while giving creates an
illusion of cultural production, of re- introducing the same things and concepts
over and over through time. This is undertaken in an effort to give permanence in
a social world that is constantly in a state of flux (Weiner 1992: 8). Even as
keeping and giving were part of the forging of political alliances, the perceptions
of the relationships, and thus the relationships themselves were changing. Also of
critical importance is the question of gender, so that we can move away from
functionalist and structuralist assertions that gender is universal and constant and
125

part of ranked oppositional patterns of a single permanent symbolic system
(Weiner 1992: 10).
Weiner (1992) points to the political importance of cloth in the process of
gift and counter gift within Trobriand society. The production of cloth reveals a
complex interweaving of gender and cultural production. As Weiner states, the
process of cultural production, or reproduction includes the cosmological
legitimation of inalienable possessions through which the presence of ancestors or
gods legitimate divinity and authority. Sexuality and reproduction are an intimate
part of social practice (Weiner 1992: 13). In this sense, Wienerâs work
reconfigures classical anthropological exchange theory to demystify ahistorical
and universal assertions of the norms of reciprocity which blur political dynamic
and gender based power in gifts and counter gifts.
Perhaps more immediately relevant to the analysis of the production and
acquisition of flaked stone symbols are the concepts of alienable versus
inalienable possessions. Inalienable possessions are those that possess exclusive
and cumulative identity with a particular series of owners through time. In this
scheme, a particular objectâs history is authenticated by fictive or true
genealogies, origin myths, ancestors, and gods. Inalienable possessions are
transcendent treasures to be guarded against all the exigencies that might force
their loss (Weiner 1992: 35).
Godelier (1999) also focuses on elaborating an internal and shifting logic
of gift exchange in complex society settings. Godelier points to an economy and
spirit of gifts that exist in the process of exchange. Included in this framework
might be the model proposed by LeCount (1999) addressing the appearance of
polychrome pottery in Late Classic contexts at the ancient Maya center of
Xunantunich, Belize. The effort to circulate material culture might be thought of
as a part of a series of aggrandizing efforts of individuals and communities of
126

elites. The desire to give more than can be given to illustrate the debt of the
individual to the gods, to the dead must also be considered. Godelier asserts that
all power contains kernels of the imaginary (Godelier 1999: 31). However,
Godelier points out that not all wealth enters into gift exchange. Of importance
are also display items. The contrast between alienable and inalienable possessions
creates two spheres of wealth, those materials that are given and exchanged
frequently and those whose possession is anchored in time (Godelier 1999: 32).
Whatever the value of an object, things given have power that is not
separate from the object. However, Godelier asserts that the most accurate
metaphor is logic rather than religion or spirit. The example of the potlatch among
the Kwakiutl as a complex sumptuary ritual involving re- distribution and
destruction is one example of an internal logic. However, the great objects held
by the elite do not move, are not exchanged. The power is not in the object as a
thing, but in the object as an extension of a subject, a political obligation. Thus,
humans are actors rather than passive recipients of the power of objects and the
gods (Godelier 1999: 105).
Godelier also points to archaic states to elucidate the economic power of
gift exchange. During the reign of the pharaoh in ancient Egypt, pharaoh was the
pivot on which society turned. The populace that comprised the social hierarchy
was destined to pay their primordial debt through tribute and labor (Godelier
1996: 200). The emergence of power hierarchies promoted the reproduction of
life prompting classes to emerge and states to form. State religion and the
execution of art in its service was the result of the formation of hierarchy and
asymmetrical relations between communities based in both reciprocity and
obedience. The Rig Veda and the book of Leviticus both illustrate that the
obligations of men to the gods and their earthly incarnations were an integral part
of the process of social and cultural production (Godelier 1999: 199). Godelier
127

asserts that we must place humans in social contexts, consisting of humans
producing a society of ideas, institutions, technology, and tools forms. At the
same time, we must also reconstruct historical development to provide a counter
to dominant discourses based in current popular and academic vogues (Godelier
1999: 201).
The above discussion has relevance for Classic Period Maya society in the
sense that we can begin to understand the complexity of the political economy of
production and acquisition of elaborate material objects in the past. In a recent
article, Reents- Budet discusses the social and political flux of the Classic Period
into which the production of elite polychrome ceramics were introduced (ReentsBudet 1998: 71). Reents- Budet asserts that painted polychrome vessels were first
used as feasting dishware and then were entombed during burial rituals of the
owner. The scenes from Classic Period banquets depicted on vessels is important
in illustrating the large scale gatherings in which gifting occurred. However,
Reents- Budet asserts that vessels were commissioned works of art that were
spent as what is termed, social currency. In this sense, the vessels were critical to
the identity of the possessors and as part of a process of political integration.
Yet, it is likely that the production and acquisition of vessels took place in
a context of competition and perhaps social disjuncture. The elites who possessed
the vessels were then in some sense obligated to the giver of the vessel. This
obligation, it is argued did not take the form of social currency, but instead can be
linked to gift exchange between crafter and elite and then perhaps between elite
and elite. In this sense, the obligation was born of likely inter- generational
relationships that were legitimated by historical and cosmological links. In this
sense, the production and acquisition of prestige goods was not a process of
expending social currency, but instead was a complex social manifestation of
shifting political relationships. These relationships in the long term, may not have
128

been part of a process of political integration, but instead of may have been part
of social fragmentation, or perhaps both at different times and in different
contexts within the same society.
Indeed, Reents- Budet (1998) compares the crafting of painted
polychrome vessels with the iron tool crafting tradition of the Toro of Western
Uganda. An analogy closer to home may be the symbolic forms crafted from chert
as depicted in the assemblages under study here (see Reents- Budet 1998: 73).
The production and acquisition of polychrome ceramics was locally and
situationally bounded. Of course if a glyphic sequence presented on a vessel can
be deciphered, it is asserted by Reents- Budet, the artisans leave the ranks of
anonymous and join the creatures that are recognized as immortal creators
(Reents- Budet 1998: 74). During the Late Classic, new and more sophisticated
production techniques appear. The development of recognizable painting styles
during the Late Classic linked the artist and patron. Ultimately, individuals can be
recognized as the crafter of particular objects.
In this example, the identities of the individual artists are constructed by
the paintings that actually made the vessel complete. As well, so was the
cosmological legitimation seen in the multiple references to creation present on
individual vessels as documented by Reents- Budet (1998: 78). Workshops of
elite goods have been documented within the confines of elite households at
Aguateca (Inomata 1995). What has been termed the scribe's workshop at
Aguateca yielded evidence that individuals and groups working there were
engaged in writing and painting, as well as bone and wood- carving. Evidence of
weaving and the preparation of pigments also likely involved both women and
men in the production process (Inomata 1995).
With respect to the appearance of flaked stone symbols produced from
chert in the eastern Maya lowlands, by introducing the interrelated writings of
129

Mauss, Godelier, and Weiner, we can begin to consider their production and
acquisition as emerging in the context of a non- capitalist, yet urban and complex
society. The notion of gift and counter gift, or keeping while giving, emphasizes
the local and political contexts of production and acquisition of specific classes of
material culture. At the same time, cosmology provided the legitimacy of both
keeping and giving and the obligations involved in each. Yet, we must not fall
into the aforementioned teleology. As Weiner (1992) and Godelier (1999) have
successfully argued, there is an internal social logic by which cosmology is a
critical part, but is not the source of ultimate causation. It is suggested here that
keeping while giving among the communities of Maya lithic crafters and elite,
and between elite and elite, was grounded in a social reality in which obligation
was the mode through which political economic interdependence was perpetuated
and negotiated.
Reents- Budetâs (1998) important work provides the link between often
studied and elaborate Maya painted polychrome ceramics, political and social
importance of the crafter or artisan, and linkages with Maya cosmology.
However, it is argued here that the idea that craft items were deployed as social
currency fails to articulate the complexity of obligation and ritual gift exchange in
ancient Maya society. Instead, drawing on the writings of Mauss (1966), it is
suggested that abstracted notions of keeping while giving were manifest in social
forms. Social forms such as that of agonistic prestation, when contextualized,
present a more appropriate explanatory tool than the idea of spending
accumulated social currency, which seems to mimic a dominant discourse that is
invalid across cultural contexts.
In the eastern lowlands of northern Belize, we possess both a long- term
sequence of flaked stone macroblade technology, as well as its technological
elaboration into symbolic forms. Despite a less diverse set of forms and an overall
130

smaller assemblage at the site of Colha, the long term sequence and the early
appearance of flaked stone symbols there suggests that flaked stone symbols came
to be a medium by which political and economic relationships were negotiated
and likely legitimated, both by cosmological references and political obligation.
The appearance of Late Preclassic and Protoclassic bifacially flaked forms
in the central precinct at Colha, in combination with stemmed macroblades that
were exported reflect the transformation of technological knowledge. Early
Classic and Late Classic tomb and cache contexts at Altun likely represent to
some degree a period of political integration, as complex political relationships
and obligations were forged between craft communities and the elite at Altun Ha.
In terms of flaked stone symbols, it is unclear where production was undertaken.
What is clear is the complex production process, as embodied in pigment and
textile fragments present on the surfaces of individual artifacts, involved
numerous technologies that may have cross- cut gender divisions.
It is posited here that during the Early Classic Period, Altun Ha became a
primary center in terms of political organization in the eastern lowlands. This saw
the movement of technology, ideas, and likely populations to areas around and in
Altun Ha, perhaps at settlement areas such as Chicawate. There, the chert crafters
and peasant farmers elaborated existing technology and symbolic knowledge to
solidify political relationships. These relationships were formed and maintained
through the mutual obligation that existed between crafters and their elite patrons.
During the Early Classic and Late Classic Periods at Lamanai,
architectural and material culture similarities illustrate the cultural and likely
political relationships that existed between Lamanai and Altun Ha. It is unclear
where production of the flaked stone symbols comprising the Lamanai
assemblage took place. Undoubtedly, large- scale gift exchanges and complex
political relationships existed between the elites at both sites. Moreover,
131

assemblages recovered from both sites reference complex technological and
symbolic knowledges implicit in the artifact forms. When considered in concert
with their contexts of final deposition, it seems clear that political relationships
based in a shifting and negotiated social reality both preceded and contributed to
the acquisition and interment of these symbols.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
This chapter began by discussing briefly the history of craft specialization
and social complexity as conceptualized in anthropology. Interwoven within this
discussion were implications for a framework based on both functional
environmental and structural symbolic approaches to material culture.

By

looking at how production and acquisition of material culture has been
conceptualized, and to some degree neglected in archaeology, a discussion of how
political relationships in many instances were critical to the organization of
production of prestige goods. In this way, an emphasis on the social relations of
production can be linked to political economy. Any interpretation of Maya
political economy necessitates a discussion of ancient Maya political
organization. In this case, a dynamic model of long term political regional
integration and dissolution, as proposed by Marcus (1993) is presented.
By reintroducing the writings of Mauss (1966) and others, a relevant
interpretive framework is presented with respect to the processes by which
prestige good of local origin were produced and acquired by elites in the context
of non- capitalist societies. By approaching the political economic relationships
that framed and organized the production of flaked stone symbols within the
context of ancient Maya society, we can begin to understand the complex
processes that necessitated both production and acquisition of this important class
of material culture.

Chapter 5: Morphological Groupings
This chapter presents the methods and results of the morphological and
technological study of the assemblages of flaked stone symbols recovered from
the sites of Altun Ha, Colha, and Lamanai, Belize. The chapter is closely linked
with the Appendix located at the end of the dissertation. The order of appearance
of artifact groupings appearing in this chapter is identical to how they appear in
the appendix. The artifact groupings themselves are based on the notion that there
are symbolic parallels between specimens across assemblages grounded in
morphological or formal similarity. I want to emphasize that the morphological
grouping of artifacts is grounded in both similarity of form as well as current
knowledge of ancient Maya culture. In this sense, like other art forms, flaked
stone symbols are viewed as both representing and structuring a common
ideology (Robb 1998).
It is a fundamental assumption of this study that flaked stone was a
medium in which knowledge was demonstrated, structured, transferred, and
transformed. Such an assumption provides a framework for interpreting culturally
bounded ontology inscribed in flaked stone. The iconography embodied in these
forms illustrates that chert crafters possessed an intimate knowledge of the
linkages between their own surroundings, important historical events, and the
cosmological underpinnings of the Maya universe. More specific linkages
between different forms of Maya artistic media and forms of flaked stone
symbols, as well as how symbols structured ideology within and across Maya
culture more generally will be presented in Chapter Six.
A second key assumption of this study is that the execution of the forms of
individual specimens was a process that demanded a high level of skill, and that

133

in the process of execution, subtlety was a quality that was highly desired. This
subtlety of execution is directly related to the use of chert as a symbolic medium.
It is posited that flake- scarring techniques were used to imply specific features of
individual forms. The natural features of the stone, such as voids, inclusions,
stains, surface alteration, and cortex are integrated purposefully in many of the
forms. In terms of the presence of cortex and altered surfaces, in many instances
anthropomorphic and zoomorphic forms exhibit one or both as part of the
represented anatomy of a culturally defined creature. For example, many of the
anthropomorphic and zoomorphic forms exhibit inclusions of cortex or surface
coloration that clearly represent the eyes of the depicted creature.
Thus, Chapter Five provides a description of each artifact grouping based
in formal similarity and linked broadly to Maya symbolism and iconography.
Interspersed within the grouping descriptions, images of selected forms are
provided. The artifact groupings and images provided in Chapter Five and in the
Appendix are an integral part of the material culture analysis and the subsequent
broader cultural interpretations addressed throughout the dissertation.
THE STRUCTURE AND METHOD OF ARTIFACT DESCRIPTIONS
In the Appendix, each artifact is presented as an individual unit containing
information. Individual artifact descriptions are presented in a systematic fashion
to facilitate future comparative research. As discussed above, the artifacts are
grouped initially according to morphological similarity. In the present chapter,
each artifact grouping is offset with an explanation of the criteria that formed the
basis for the definition of a particular grouping. Individual artifacts are described
in the Appendix following a template articulated below. The artifacts are grouped
under morphological headings with artifacts from Altun Ha, then Colha, and
finally Lamanai described in that order.

134

Within each artifact grouping as presented in the Appendix, the artifacts
are described in ascending order based on the numerical designation assigned to
particular contexts (the original artifact numbers from each project). For example,
under the artifact grouping simple crescents, all simple crescent forms from
Altun Ha are described first, followed by those from Colha, and finally those from
Lamanai. Within the descriptions of artifacts from each site, an artifact designated
RP164/32 would be described prior to an artifact assigned the number RP364/15.
These numerical designations correspond to contextual information that is
presented within individual artifact descriptions.
The template used to describe each artifact focuses on both qualitative as
well as quantitative information. Images of selected artifacts within each grouping
and originating from specific sites are presented based on overall similarity and
variation within artifact groupings. Synthesis of quantitative data is presented in
the technological and material characterization analysis presented in Chapter
Seven. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a description of the template of
individual artifact descriptions as well as each artifact grouping (see the Appendix
for individual artifact descriptions).
The first prefix and number appearing in the description of each artifact is
the research number, which is an arbitrary number that was assigned to each
artifact during the present study. This number has no influence on the order in
which the artifacts are described. However, these numbers are used to link images
of specific artifacts with their individual description. The second number
appearing in each description is the original number assigned to each artifact and
links that artifact to itâs archaeological context. This number as described above
determines the order of artifact presentation within artifact groupings. Next, the
site from which the artifact being described originated appears followed by the
maximum length, width, and thickness of the artifact.
135

The technological type category is based in a model of stone working
strategies (see Collins 1975; Shafer 1979, 1985; Roemer 1984; Whittaker 1994).
These strategies include the reduction of large nodules into macroblades and
macroflake- blades that were subject to further bifacial reduction and margin
alteration. A second technology employed in the production of flaked stone
symbols is characterized by margin trimming and direct percussion observable
along the margins of core nodules. The second technology is most prevalent at
Colha. This use of smaller cores with cortex located at one terminus resulted in
uni- directional and bi- directional blade production. These lengthy blades are
seen in much larger numbers at Colha. Blades were then often unifacially worked
and uniformly notched along lateral margins. The production of notched blades
required a sophisticated stone technology and the resources necessary for
development of a particular technological trajectory.
However, in terms of symbolic content of the forms, the Colha assemblage
might be generally intimated as less varied than the assemblage from Altun Ha
and Lamanai in that there is an increased repetitiveness rather than elaboration of
form. With respect to stone symbol technology, during the latter part of the Late
Preclassic and the Late Classic at Colha it appears that a shift is made from the
production of elaborate bifaces comprised of macroblades and macroflake- blades
to increased production of smaller notched blades. These forms appear to be less
complex symbols crystallizing instead a local blade technology.
The assemblages from Altun Ha and Lamanai exhibit exceedingly
different kinds of assemblages. However, the technology visible within the
assemblage, to a large degree, is more uniform. The present interpretation
indicates that production of flake stone symbols was marked by both
technological change and symbolic elaboration through time (Gibson 1989).
Variation in technology is more clearly demonstrated at the site of Colha.
136

However, symbolic elaboration is apparent in the Altun Ha and Lamanai
assemblages.
The technological type category includes the terms: biface, blade, and
flake. These artifacts are posited to be the end result of clearly patterned
production efforts. Further descriptors of each type are included in parentheses.
The descriptors observed include the terms: serrated, notched, barbed, stemmed,
elongated, one pronged, two pronged, trefoil, and tetrafoil. These terms are also
included in grouping titles. Another descriptor in the case of elongated forms, or
staff/ stave ends, is also used to refer to forms that appear to have been hafted. A
haft or elaborate handling is marked by varying intensity of polish duly noted in
the artifact description.
The next series of characteristics focuses on the general appearance of the
artifact, including: the presence of cortex and raw material appearance,
defined as the raw material color and pattern of the color. The color descriptions
are based on Munsell Color Chart definitions. Presence of polish, thermal
alteration, or coloration notes the presence of any or all of these characteristics
on a particular specimen. More thorough articulation of the presence of surface
alteration is presented at the end of the breakage patterns/ notes section of the
individual artifact description. The context of the specimen is then presented
based on data gathered from published and unpublished sources. Finally,
appearance in the literature notes individual artifact presentation or illustration
in previous literature.
The final two portions of the individual artifact description are the
breakage pattern/ notes section and the presence of pigments/ residue section.
Each specimen was examined under a ten-power magnification hand lens. The
description of the breakage pattern implements standard morphological terms for
lithic analysis. The breakage pattern/ notes section is employed to provide a
137

general description of texture and composition/ inclusions of the raw material and
flake scar patterning. The following terms are used to characterize the surfaces of
the artifact: dorsal/ ventral, medial/ lateral, proximal/ distal where each, if any are
recognizable. Medial surfaces are generally characterized by the appearance of
one of three kinds of flake scars, identified by their distal terminations.
Terminations are classified as: 1. Step scar: a flake scar that terminates in a right
angle 2. Hinge scar: a flake scar that terminates in a curve or hinge 3. Feather
terminated scar: a flake scar that broadens out and terminates gradually, often
exhibiting waves of the bulb of percussion (see Whittaker 1994).
The presence of stacked microflaking as well as the presence of edge
crushing characterizes the lateral margins on a majority of the artifacts. Edge
attrition identifies the presence of different kinds of flake scarring. Microflaking
can be defined as very short, vertically oriented step and hinge scars. These are
often most numerous on the interior of crescents, notches and serrations. Along
the edge prominences and parallel margins, short feather terminated flake scars
that extend from the margin to the interior of the surface are most prevalent. As
stated before, surfaces are identified where possible. Also curved artifact profiles
and the clarity to which an artifact appears to have originated from a bifacially
reduced macroblade or macroflake- blade is indicated.
Brief notations of any anomalies and (or) the presence of interpretive
characteristics, as well as clarification of the location of any cortex and itâs
relation to the artifact form are included. Finally, brief clarification of location
and intensity of any polish and (or) staining/ coloration visible on artifact surfaces
is presented in this portion of the breakage patterns/ notes section.
The presence of pigments/ residues section documents and describes
color and texture of pigments. Moreover, any substance that exhibits some degree
of uniformity and is present in a defined area delineates an interpretive
138

characteristic and is also described. In the assemblages of flake stone symbols
under study, residues that may have held appliquÃ©s in place often occur in
conjunction with pigments as well as textiles.
Artifact Grouping: Anthropomorphic Forms
The first artifact grouping presented are the anthropomorphic forms. The
depiction of humans by Maya chert crafters is undertaken by representing
individuals involved in a range of activities that likely represent specific historical
moments, as well as structure how culture is produced. The forms serve in a way
as markers or sign posts regarding an acceptable cultural aesthetic about the way
humans are depicted and the activities in which they engage. Of note is the use of
the term anthropomorphic form. This is not an attempt to evade the critical
importance of gender in how culture is produced, but instead is employed so that
gender is not assumed. The default mode of thought as implied by the notion that
all forms are male is rejected in favor of careful consideration of specific traits of
individual and groups of artifacts.
Several different sub- groupings emerged from the more general classification of
anthropomorphic form. The sub- groupings are based on variation in how
individual figures are depicted. The depictions are based on how similar forms are
depicted and (or) appear in other forms of Maya media. The different subgroupings include captives, gendered forms, depiction of sacrifice, ball players,
more general forms and finally, exaggerated forms.

Figure 5.1 shows the

frequency of anthropomorphic forms between the three sites.

Figure 5.1- Frequency of anthropomorphic forms by site

Captives
The taking of captives was an important event in local histories.
Moreover, captives were important in ancient Maya artistic depictions (Schele
and Miller 1986). They represent an individual or groupsâ ability in war, as well
reinforced the status of the captive taker. As seen in other media, captives are
depicted in specific positions, primarily as bound and in a submissive body
stance. The initial analysis of assemblages of flaked stone showed that
anthropomorphic forms exhibited specific attributes.
The criteria for the classification of an anthropomorphic form as a captive
are the positioning of the arms, the positioning of the legs, and the appearance and
relative simplicity of the headdress. In this sense, there are a total of eight forms

140

in the assemblages that can be classified as captives. Seven of the forms are from
Altun Ha and one form originates from Lamanai (see Figure 5.2 and Figure 5.3).
Ball Players
Within the cultural context of Classic Period Maya society as well as in
depictions present in Maya artistic media, the ballgame played a critical part in
both elite ritual and popular public displays. As a medium on which cultural
activities were recorded, it is suggested that flaked stone figures were employed
to depict and (or) commemorate ball players. Ball player figures were identified
by similar criteria as captives. These criteria include overall anthropomorphic
form of the individual piece, the positioning of the arms and legs, and the form of
the headdress. In addition, the presence of what appears to be a yoke around the
waist is also used to classify forms as ball player figures. It is posited that the
simple headdress, the diagonal positioning of the arms, naturalized positioning of
the feet, and (or) the presence of the waist yoke are defining characteristics of the
Classic Period Maya ball player as represented in flaked stone (Figure 5.4).
Gendered Forms
As we now know, gender is a complex cultural construction.
Interpretations of material culture should not be grounded in implicit assumptions
to culturally specific notions of gender. At the same time, the construction of
gender must be addressed not only in the production, acquisition and consumption
of material culture, but in terms of the representative and (or) symbolic content of
specific artifacts. Nor should individual specimens be labeled as male and (or)

141

Figure 5.2- ah8RP137/55 Altun Ha

142

Figure 5.3- r77LA244/6 Lamanai

143

female based on implicit and ethnocentric notions of gender. However, depictions
of women abound in other Maya artistic media (see Schele and Miller 1986). The
engendering of figures in Maya art follow distinct patterns that are linked to the
normative or ideal that was prescribed by the state, as well individual and (or)
group subjectivity. Cross culturally, anthropomorphic forms appearing in the rock
art of the European Neolithic show individuals that exhibit gendered
characteristics as well as those that exhibit no characteristics (see Handsman
1991; Gero and Conkey 1991; Wright 1996).
It is inferred here, as shown in other media, the crafters of flaked stone
symbols also depicted women in a number of forms. It appears that gendered
characteristics are present, such as broad lower portions of the forms. However,
elaborate depictions of women undertaking specific roles in terms of the division
of labor and craft production are absent. Classification of artifacts as a gendered
form is based on the positioning of the head and headdress/ hair and the relative
width of the lower torso of the artifact (Figure 5.5).
Depictions of Sacrifice
As depicted in other forms of Maya artistic media, ritualized human
sacrifice and auto- sacrifice were critical components of Maya religious life.
Sacrifice was necessary to keep in balance a fundamentally unstable and shifting
cosmos, to celebrate both religious and politico- historical events, and to
demonstrate power in more earthly contexts such as defeat in war or sport.

144

Figure 5.4- ah26RP98/19 Altun Ha

145

Figure 5.5- r72LA395/ Lamanai

146

Sacrificial victims were most likely retainers of recently deceased elite
personages, slaves, and (or) war captives (see Schele and Freidel 1990).
As we have seen, there are numerous variations in the way
anthropomorphic forms are depicted. It is important to remember that the
execution of form in depicting an individual in specific social and historical
context was part and parcel of the skill of the stone worker. In the case of
sacrificial victims, my interpretation was based on the position of the body, as
splayed out with arms and legs extended in fundamentally static mode, the lack of
a headdress or a very simple headdress, and the presence of coloration and or
surface alteration of the artifact that may represent the demise of the individual
depicted. The submissive posturing and lack of even a simple headdress again
support classification as a captive (Figure 5.6).
Generalized Depictions
When grouping artifacts based on specific morphological attributes, there
is always the problem of specimens that are generalized in form. And while these
forms certainly are anthropomorphic in form, they do not exhibit the plurality of
specific attributes that would permit them to be further classified. The generalized
sub grouping was devised because the forms that follow exhibit at least one
attribute used to define prior and more morphologically/ culturally specific
categories.
Generalized attributes are simple headdresses, the positioning of the arms,
legs, or feet, and the implied static posture of the forms. A generalized
classification does not preclude the notion that these forms may indeed be
depictions of captives, or ball players, but only that the combination of attributes
does not permit a more specific classification (Figure 5.7a).

147

Figure 5.6- ah258RP38/55 Altun Ha

148

Exaggerated Depictions and Facial Profiles
The final sub- grouping of anthropomorphic forms is comprised of four
specimens. These appear to be anthropomorphic, but exhibit considerable
variation in appearance. The first form presented is a short figure that exhibits a
large void, suggested to represent and eye in profile. The second form is what
appears to be a face in profile. The third example is a seated figure exhibiting a
facial profile. All three of these forms were recovered from Altun Ha contexts.
The fourth form is a bifacially worked flake that represents what appears to be a
head and face in profile with an intact forelock. These forms show that there was
significant room for interpretation of human form by individual crafters, perhaps
in some instances motivated by humor (Figure 5.7b).
Artifact Grouping: Zoomorphic Forms
A large number of artifacts in the assemblages were classified as
zoomorphic forms. As depicted in other Maya artistic media, the animal world
had extensive symbolic value and can be linked to Maya ontology and
cosmology, as well as history. No doubt the Maya had there own classificatory
schemes for animals, perhaps divided into groups that possessed transformative
properties. As well, animals and humans were not mutually exclusive beings. This
can be seen in the metamorphosis that shamans and other Maya religious
practitioners undertook to transform themselves into animals and back to humans
again. Moreover, animals were important in the mundane world, as dogs were
likely kept in domestic settings. The following groupings divide the assemblage
according to what appear to be naturalized forms, taking into consideration
alterations, exaggerations, and transformations that were incorporated in both
static and dynamic depictions. Figure 5.8 shows the distribution of zoomorphic
forms by site.

Mammalian and Amphibian Depictions
Depictions of mammals and amphibians were classified based on a
number of criteria, from a consideration of Maya cosmology and mythology to
that of the kinds of species that were present during the Classic Period of Maya
civilization. It is clear from other artistic media that mammals in the forms of
dogs, cats, deer, peccary, tapir, monkeys, and smaller species such as the
coatomundi were an integral part of Maya life as sources of food and subjects of
myth. Amphibians such as turtles and frogs also played roles in Maya cosmology,
myth, as well as sources of food. The classification of individual forms was based
on overall morphological similarity to specific natural species such as feline
forms and (or) canine forms that may reference wayob, or animal spirit (Figure
5.9b).

Birds and Bird- like Depictions
A number of artifacts in the assemblages showed remarkable resemblance
to birds and bird- like forms. In other Maya artistic media, birds are depicted
relatively frequently. Birds were present in both the real world, as well as in the
world of myth and were recognized and depicted. Individual specimens were
classified as birds primarily by the presence of a bill and also the form of the body
and the legs. In some cases, the depiction of the bird form takes alternative
morphological and technological forms. One example depicts a bird standing on
the back of what appears to be a crocodile. In terms of technological variation,
one example is produced on a large core, while another was produced on a large
flake that shows scarring on the dorsal surface (see Appendix).
Crocodiles and Crocodile- like Depictions
Crocodiles again played an important role in the cosmology and
mythology/ symbolism of the ancient Maya. According to the Maya cosmovision,
the world was created on the backs of both turtles and crocodiles (Freidel et al.
1993). The crocodile no doubt had special symbolic importance to local historical
and mythological knowledge in the eastern lowlands. Due to the close proximity
to salt water and freshwater crocodile habitats, they were likely both a source of
food as well as fear and respect. Indeed, the ancient Yucatec name of Lamanai is
lamaâ an ayin, or submerged crocodile (Pendergast 1981: 32).
Crocodile and crocodile- like beasties were classified based on several
criteria. The primary two characteristics are the elongated form and the subtle
execution of both the snout and the eye. Moreover, serrated margins and the
presence of a clearly defined tail were also traits that are associated with crocodile
forms. However, each form does not have to exhibit all of the traits to be

153

b.

b. r70LA395/ Lamanai

interpreted as crocodile- like. Indeed, several examples show very similar forms
to crocodiles, but may instead represent fantastic or transformational species,
species that have no exact correlation to what we recognize as crocodiles. What
must be remembered is the skill of the execution of form, the integration of
natural features of the raw material, such as cortex and voids to delineate parts of
the form, as well as flake scarring to illustrate features of individual forms (Figure
5.10a & b).
Elongated Serpent and Serpent- like Depictions
Like crocodiles, serpents played an important role in the cosmology and
mythology of the ancient Maya. Serpents are depicted in numerous forms in other
Maya artistic media. Snake symbolism was utilized to depict everything from the
return of the ancestors to the appearance of the gods (see Schele and Freidel 1990;
Spinden 1975). Serpents were thought to span the sky and surround the earth.
Moreover, snake symbolism also marks a cultural link with other ancient
Mesoamerican cultures. Serpents depicted in Maya artistic media often exhibit
elaborate decorations, feathers, and were often personified. Snake symbolism was
part of an iconography of both political and religious power.
On a more mundane level, serpents occur frequently at Maya sites and in
the natural and cultural landscapes across the lowlands. It is likely serpents were
observed by the Maya in all kinds of settings. While the elite appropriated serpent
imagery for political ends, other communities also created there own vision of
serpents in a medium such as flaked stone. Again, like crocodiles, serpents are
classified according to a number of criteria; namely the elongated form that
exhibits nothing that could be construed as legs or other appendages. Serpents
also exhibit open, gaping mouths and are overall narrow in width (see Appendix).

155

Non- elongated Serpent- like Depictions
These forms are similar to the elongated serpent forms, but are compacted
in depiction. Instead, the forms are depicted as dynamic and oftentimes
compressed. The criteria for classification in this artifact grouping includes the
presence of deeper and more frequently occurring notches and serrations, which
imply movement and to some degree more diverse forms that begin to move away
from naturalized depictions of serpents. These forms draw on knowledge of
transformational or supernatural beasts so prevalent in Maya cosmology and
mythology (see Appendix).
Centipedes and Scorpions
Elongated specimens take the form of other species besides crocodiles and
serpents. Recognized in these forms are both centipedes and a scorpion. These
species are found in other forms of Maya artistic media (see Tedlock 1985).
Moreover, the species occur frequently in the Maya area. Specimens were
classified as centipedes if the form is smaller and exhibits more serrations than
serpent forms. Also, centipedes that were depicted as moving clearly contrast
with serpent forms. Scorpion forms were easily classified by the presence of the
lengthy tail and the pincer- like appendages (Figure 5.11a).
Marine, Fish, and Fish- like Depictions
Similar to other species, fish and marine species were part of the array of
animal life that the Maya encountered in every day life, as well as in
cosmological and mythological depictions of the universe. As with other forms,
marine species and fish appear fairly frequently depicted in other forms of ancient
Maya artistic media. Fish and marine species were classified based on the overall

156

a.

b.
Figure 5.11- a. r1LA/ Lamanai

b. r54LA244/11 Lamanai
157

form of the individual piece. The outline of the specimen is fairly indicative of
what is being depicted. Also as part of the grouping are the subtle ways in which
features of the individual specimen are depicted. This includes irregular
inclusions and cortex employed to depict eyes in profile, as well as flake scars
and protrusions in the raw material that were used to depict other features, such as
fins and barbles, as those that appear on catfish (Figure 5.11b).
Artifact Grouping: Crescent Forms
One of the most frequently occurring forms appearing in the three
assemblages of flaked stone symbols under study is the crescent form and its
numerous variants. Though simple crescents appear in all three assemblages,
more frequently occurring are forms that exhibit numerous notches, barbs, and
(or) serrations on the exterior lateral margin of the crescent, with a large primary
notch forming the interior margin. Crescent forms oftentimes exhibit cortex and
flake scarring which are integrated into the morphology of individual artifacts.
From the location of these inclusions, it is posited that they are employed to
depict eyes or highlight the open mouths of celestial creatures. Moreover, it is
posited that some forms represent eclipses or planetary convergence. The
elaboration of crescent forms demonstrates knowledge of cosmology, as well as
knowledge of specific celestial bodies and their movements.
The crescent grouping includes artifacts that exhibit appendages or prongs
protruding from one or both of the margins of an artifact. Crescent forms
possessing two prongs extending from each side of the artifact greatly resembles
objects identified as âknuckle dustersâ. These forms are often displayed by
individuals of high status depicted on carved stone monuments or in Maya
paintings. It has been posited that knuckle-dusters were surely objects of authority

Artifact Groupings

Figure 5.12- Frequency of crescent forms by site
when displayed in specific contexts. Indeed, several of the forms in the
assemblages under study exhibit polish, suggesting that they were handled
extensively. Figure 5.12 shows the frequency of crescent forms by site.
Generally speaking, crescent forms are grouped according to the presence
or absence of one or two prongs, the presence or absence of serration and (or)
barbs, and the presence of two crescents along a central stem. The inclusion of all
crescents together does not preclude the notion that some forms may indeed
represent other creatures, as is the case in several examples. However, the central
location of the crescent in the overall form of the individual artifact guided
subsequent classification.

Two Pronged Crescents (knuckle-dusters)
Two pronged crescents were grouped based on the protrusions extending
from the margins of the crescent. These forms have been identified previously as
objects that were oftentimes held by individual leaders and high-ranking
individuals. Among some scholars, they are identified as knuckle- dusters. For the
most part, the specimens are finely flaked and quite narrow. In some cases, polish
is visible on the medial surfaces indicating the specimen was handled extensively
(see Appendix).
Two Pronged and Serrated Crescents
As mentioned in the introduction and definition of the crescent form
grouping, two pronged crescent forms occur relatively frequently in the
assemblages. In many instances, these forms also exhibit margin serrations. These
artifacts were grouped due to similar morphology in comparison to other pronged
crescent forms. The presence of two prongs and in some cases, margin serrations
mark this group as variation in the initial crescent form grouping (Illustration 5.1).
This variation may have had correlates in terms of artifact meaning within a
specific cultural context (see Appendix).
Double Crescents
This sub- grouping encompasses a limited number of forms, but the forms
are significantly different than the other crescent forms to be set apart. Double
crescents are comprised of two smaller crescents that are linked by a narrow stem
or single prong that extends past both crescents. Although the symbolism of these
forms is not nearly as clear as depictions of human captives or animal forms, the
technical skill necessary to create these forms is exceptional.

161

Control of flaking depended on uniform and fine quality raw material, but
also the skill of the crafter. In the case of the double crescent, in order to create
the narrow stem and the wider crescents required exceptional skill. Short
symmetrical feather terminated flake scars are most prevalent along the stem,
with wider feather terminated flake scarring more prevalent across the medial
surfaces of the crescents. What is most remarkable about the specimens is the
clear demonstration of knowledge of the physical properties of the chert and the
force required to fracture it in a preconceived pattern (see Appendix).
Serrated, Barbed, and Single Pronged Crescents
As mentioned in the initial description of the crescent form artifact
grouping, there is variability in the forms of lateral margin alteration observed on
crescent forms. The previous sub- groups have addresses large prongs extending
from lateral margins as well as double crescents. The present artifact grouping is
based on the kind and number of projections protruding from the lateral margins
of the individual specimens.
Serrated crescents exhibit numerous short and narrow projections that
often exhibit stacked flake scarring on the interior of the numerous edge
prominences. Barbed specimens exhibit larger projections that are fewer in
number when compared to serrations. However, there are more than two or three
projections. Barbs are generally shorter and narrower than prongs. Also, knuckleduster forms exhibiting two prongs are not the only forms of pronged crescents
present in the assemblages. Single pronged crescents are also present. These
forms exhibit a single prong protruding from the lateral margin of a crescent
form. Artifacts exhibiting single prongs often also exhibit serrations and (or)
barbs in addition to the prong (see Appendix).

162

Simple Crescent Forms
Simple crescent forms are comprised of artifacts that exhibit no margin
alteration. The artifact grouping exhibits primarily wide medial surfaces that taper
at both ends of the crescent. Broad feather terminated flake scars are most
prevalent across the medial surfaces of the specimen.

The interior margin

exhibits stacked flake scarring. The exterior margins exhibit short feather
terminated flake scarring. Several of the artifacts exhibit staining/ coloration that
may be highly eroded pigment (see Appendix).
Personified Crescents (Celestial/ Earth Monsters)
It has long been recognized that the movements of celestial bodies were
observed and recorded by the ancient Maya. Indeed, Thompson (1966) originally
indicated that most, if not all hieroglyphic texts were recordings of indecipherable
astronomical observations. While, as the decipherments of Proskouriakoff (1960)
and then Lounsbury (1974), Kelley (1976), Schele (1982) and others over the past
twenty-five years have shown us, a large portion of these texts were recording
elite history. However, it has become clear that significant portions of the texts
are likely records of astronomical observations. This is important in that it shows
that the movements of celestial bodies were important events in Maya cosmology
and mythology. The Maya believed that the sky was comprised of a giant serpent
and that planets such as Venus, and bodies such as the moon and the sun were
also living creatures. Moreover, the earth and mountains are also often depicted as
monsters (see Appendix).

163

a.

b.

164

It is posited here that flaked stone was a medium in which celestial events
were recorded, oftentimes as personified symbols. These crescent forms
possessing prongs and exhibiting pigments, stains, residues, and cortex that in
many instances appear to delineate eyes and other facial features of personified
celestial bodies. The sky was not the only part of the Maya cosmos that was
personified. As mentioned above, topographical features of the earth were often
personified as well. Mountains oftentimes were depicted as âwitzâ or earth
monsters (see Freidel et al. 1993). While occurring less frequently than crescent
forms depicting celestial monsters, at least one crescent form appears to delineate
an earth monster. The following grouping of crescent forms presents crescents
that exhibit eyes and mouths in profile. These are personifications and indeed,
translations and inscriptions of a specific cosmology by the chert crafters (Figure
5.13b).
Simple Serrated and (or) Barbed Crescent Forms
This artifact group is defined primarily by forms that exhibit barbs or
serrations along the margins but no other alterations. In addition, the serrated
forms are also not believed to have been personified due to the lack of residue of
pigment visible on each piece. There is no evidence of surface alteration of
elaboration. Serrations are defined as short and numerous projections protruding
from the lateral margins of an artifact. Each artifact exhibits margin alteration
(Figure 5.13a).
Artifact Grouping: Barbed and Serrated Rings
Artifacts that are circular or oval in shape with perforated centers occur in
the assemblages under study. Ring forms are produced for the most part utilizing
voids in the chert. The perforated areas for the most part exhibit cortex on the and

165

interior of the perforation. Oftentimes the interior of the ring exhibits scraping
smoothing as shown by incised lines and scrape marks. These efforts were
undertaken in order to make the ring more symmetrical in appearance. Figure
5.14 shows the frequency of ring forms by site.
Ring forms also exhibit alteration to the exterior margin. Like crescent forms as
well as elongated forms, margins of rings exhibit barbs, serrations, and notches.
Unlike crescents, which occur much more frequently in the assemblages, the
kinds of variation visible on the exterior margin of ring forms are grouped
together. Similar to crescents serrated rings show numerous short protrusions
from the exterior margin. Barbed rings exhibit larger protrusions that are much
more numerous in number. Notched rings exhibit short protrusions, but large gaps
between them. These gaps extend a significant distance into the interior of the
artifact. The specific meaning of ring forms is unclear. However, the opening or

166

Illustration 5.2- cr75CH2012/13- 15
Max. dimensions- l: 31.5 w: 23.4 th: 5.3

167

perforation in the center of the ring may be linked to the importance of openings
or portals to the underworld are in Maya cosmology. Whatever the case, ring
forms possessed significant meaning as flaked stone symbols (Illustration 5.2).
Artifact Grouping: Non- perforated and Perforated Star Forms
This grouping is defined by circular bifaces with a variable number of
protrusions extending from the margin. The bifaces are marked by barbs or
serrations, but there is little difference between the two. Of note are the particular
numbers of protrusions that are present. The number of protrusions varies from
seven and nine. Several of the forms exhibit four, five, and eleven protrusions. It
is unclear what the symbolic meaning of these artifacts might be. The star forms
appear in other media, usually as part of the frame of scenes (see Figure 5.15).
This group of artifacts may be considered a variation on both star forms
and ring forms. The artifacts exhibit protrusions that cannot be considered barbs
due to how numerous they occur. Moreover, the forms are not ring shaped but do
exhibit perforations. These perforations also exhibit scraping and smoothing on
the interior of the perforation. These incised lines may be indications of use as
well as efforts to make the interior of the perforation more uniform. An initial
interpretation of the meaning of the forms is difficult, though the perforations and
the star form may link them to portals (or) celestial bodies (Figure 5.16a & b).
Artifact Grouping: Stemmed Disks
The stemmed disk is a form that occurs relatively frequently in both the
Altun Ha and Lamanai assemblages, though it is not present in the Colha
assemblage. The artifact grouping is defined by a circular biface extending from a
narrow lengthy stem. The artifacts in the group exhibit generally exhibit

symmetrical flake scarring along the stem and broad flake scars across the
surfaces of the disk. One artifact exhibits variation in the form of lengthy barbs
extending from the disk of one form. Figure 5.15b shows the frequency of
stemmed disks and disks by site (see Appendix; also Chapter 6).
The symbolic meaning of the forms is unclear, as they have previously
been identified as hand mirror and (or) stingray forms. It is posited the latter can
be dismissed due to the appearance as so different than a stingray. If these
assemblages have illustrated anything, it is that the chert crafters can depict
naturalized as well as supernatural appearing animal and human forms. The
stemmed disk while generalized in form does not resemble a stingray. The hand
mirror interpretation is possible, but evidence suggests that Maya mirrors were
not hafted, but instead were objects without hafts. There is also little evidence that
anything like a mirror was attached to the disk portion of the form. Additionally,
the barbed artifact seems to further stretch the hand mirror interpretation.
It is also possible that these forms could have been used as clubs or
weapons. However, there is little evidence for extensive handling. It is suggested
here that the forms are depicting meteors and (or) comets. The barbed form is a
depiction of an especially bright meteor. If we can accept the interpretation that
other forms are also depicting celestial bodies at rest and in motion, as well as
personified, then the depiction of meteors and comets appears more plausible.
Artifact Grouping: Circular and Ovoid Disks
Several circular and oval shaped forms are present in the Altun Ha
assemblage. Primarily their shape characterizes these artifacts and the lengthy
feather terminated flake scarring visible across the medial surfaces of the
specimens. The lateral margins are often characterized by short feather terminated

170

a.

b.
Figure 5.16- a. ah51RP58/36 b.ah297RP200/384 Altun Ha

171

flake scars and localized stacked flake scarring and edge crushing. The circular
artifacts exhibit flake scarring primarily on the dorsal surfaces with fewer flake
scars present on the medial ventral surfaces. Along the margins of the ventral
surfaces, short feather terminated flake scarring is visible. This flaking was likely
undertaken strengthen the margins. Moreover, ate least one circular form exhibits
both textile and pigment on the dorsal surface of the artifact. In terms of the oval
shaped forms are finely flaked on both surfaces with margins exhibiting short
feather terminated flake scars. These forms exhibit a similar technology as the
general utility bifaces present at Colha.
These forms perhaps are representations of rubber balls so important to the
ball game as well as perhaps representation of celestial bodies. The intertwining
of the ball game and depictions and movements of celestial bodies is well
documented as integral to Maya mythology (Figure 5.17a).
Artifact Grouping: Bundled Forms
This artifact grouping is defined by bifaces that exhibit a stemmed portion,
marked by short and symmetrical feather terminated flake scarring. The distal end
widens to notched and barbed firms that appear as bundles. This portion of the
forms exhibit for the most part lengthy feather terminated flake scarring. The use
of the term bundle refers to bundled maize that appears in other form of Maya
media. These bundles were common features of Maya life as part of the harvest,
of which maize was the staple crop. The harvest also possessed powerful
symbolic value and likely was represented in Maya art (Figure 5.17b).

This artifact grouping is comprised of stemmed forms exhibiting distal
ends that broaden out to one of several forms define this artifact grouping. The
stems of each form exhibit symmetrical feather terminated flake scarring. On a
number of the specimens, extensive polish is visible that suggests that they have
been extensively handled. The distal ends terminate in two forms, namely as
serpent head and axes. One exceptional form is a monolithic axe that appears to
have been handled throughout its use life prior to interment (see Appendix; also
Chapter 6). Figure 5.18 shows the frequency of bundled forms, serpent staffs, and
axe forms.
Artifact Grouping: Tetrafoils

intersection define this grouping. The prongs are marked by similar flake scarring

The tetrafoil form is a very frequently occurring form in Maya art. It is
often used to represent the quadripartite division of the Maya cosmos. Also, the
tetrafoil is often depicted as the world tree, the axis mundi on which the three
worlds of the Maya cosmos are oriented. It is unclear the symbolic nature of the
tetrafoil presented here. What is clear is that the tetrafoil was an important
aesthetic symbol that indexes rather than represents how the ancient Maya
imagined the structure of their universe (Figure 5.20a). Figure 5.19 shows the
frequency of both trefoils and tetrafoils by site.

Artifact Grouping: Trefoils
This artifact grouping is defined by elongated specimens with threeprongs. These artifacts generally exhibit symmetrical flake scarring along the
medial surfaces of the prongs that meet at a central intersection. The margins at
the intersection for the most part exhibit extensive stacked flake scarring. It is
unclear what the trefoil may index, but clearly it is an important symbol employed
in both flaked stone and other ancient Maya media (see Figure 5.20b).
Artifact Grouping: Bident and Trident Forms
These forms are defined by elongated, stemmed forms with two prongs
extending from the distal end. These forms appear similar to a two-pronged
âforkâ. They are in general finely flaked with short symmetrical feather
terminated flake scarring visible along the stem as well as the prongs. The term
bident is used in the same way trident would be used, save for the presence of
only two prongs. It is unclear what these forms may index. Moreover, there is
little evidence of extensive polish visible on any of the forms (Figure 5.21a).
Artifact Grouping: Stemmed Forms with Notches/ Profiles
This artifact grouping is broadly defined. These forms are for the most
part elongated, but also are wide, oftentimes exhibiting short as well as longer
stems. It appears that the forms may also depict profiles of humans and
supernatural creatures. The artifact forms exhibit triangular distal termini with
some notches visible along the lateral margins. For the most part, artifacts exhibit
short and lengthier feather terminated flake scarring. Lateral margins exhibit short
feather terminated flake scarring with some localized areas of edge crushing and
stacked step and hinge terminated flake scarring. Figure 5.22 shows the frequency
of these two artifact classifications by site.

The margins exhibit serrations as well as notches. On the interior of the
serrations, edge crushing is more prevalent. In at least two of the specimens, the
portion of the specimen that likely was part of a human profile was missing.
Although this portion of the specimen is not present, the notion that they were
part of the grouping is not as much of a stretch as one might think. The extensive
notches and serrations are present on elongated forms. In some cases, the distal
ends exhibit a snap fracture. This fracture removed that particular portion of the
specimen. Also, the presence of pigments and staining on at least one of the
specimens indicates that the surfaces of the form were elaborated upon.
Combined with the removal of the distal ends, it is suggested that these pieces
were important symbols during their use- life (see Appendix).

Figure 5.23- Frequency of Bi- pointed forms and staff ends by site
Artifact Grouping: Bi- pointed, Elongated, and Notched Forms
This artifact grouping consists of forms that exhibit a tapered point at each
terminus. In the central portion of artifact forms are notches that narrow the width
of the stem. The bi- pointed form appears at other sites, namely in smaller forms
at Piedras Negras. However, the forms in the present study are limited to the
Altun Ha assemblage. The medial surfaces generally exhibit moderately lengthy,
symmetrical feather terminated flake scarring (Figure 5.21b).
Artifact Grouping: Elongated, Stemmed, and Narrow Forms (Staff Ends)
This artifact grouping is another broadly defined group. It includes
elongated and narrow forms that often exhibit stems. Many of these forms appear

180

a.

b.
Figure 5.24- a. ah102RP657/1 b. ah173RP166/2 Altun Ha

to be staff ends that were hafted, perhaps as lengthy spear points. However, polish
is not present on all of the forms. Some of the forms are quite wide with triangular
distal ends and short, wide stems. Some of these forms appear to be zoomorphs,
but the perspective does not lend itself to an interpretation. It is suggested that
some of the forms that do exhibit polish were hafted at the end of a staff for
display (Figure 5.24a & b).
The wider forms exhibit lengthy feather terminated flake scarring along
the medial surfaces of the specimen. The lateral margins are also finely flaked.
The narrow forms exhibit shorter feather terminated flake scars across the medial
surfaces as well as along the lateral margins. These flake scars are in many cases
symmetrical and parallel. One of the defining criteria that define many of the
other artifact groupings is the presence of barbs and notches. This artifact
grouping possesses forms that exhibit both. However, the presence of both narrow
and wide stems and the elongated nature of all of the artifacts classified in this
grouping prompted a consideration of these artifacts as belonging to a broadly
defined artifact grouping. Illustrations 5.3 and 5.4 are line drawings of what have
been classified as staff ends from the Protoclassic burial at Operation 2031,
Colha.
Artifact Grouping: Notched and Stemmed Blades
In addition to elaborately produced bifaces, also included in the present
study of flaked stone symbols are artifacts that comprise additional morphological
and technological categories. While the majority of the assemblages have been
technologically categorized as bifaces and then divided into groups based
morphological characteristics; other artifacts were clearly produced using a
different production technology. As stated previously, morphological groupings

184

of bifaces are based broadly on similarity of form and surface treatment that
evidence the complexity of meaning associated with individual forms. However, a
significant number of artifacts in the assemblage vary both morphologically and
technologically from the artifact groupings classified under the heading of biface.
The first and most numerous forms of the non- bifaces are notched blades
(see figure 5.25). The notched blade grouping constitutes a convergence of both
morphological and technological characteristics. The reduction technology of
large bifaces stems from initial production of what has been termed macroflakeblades from large nodules quarried near Colha, Altun Ha and smaller sites in the
chert bearing eastern portion of northern Belize. These preforms were then
reduced on both dorsal and ventral surfaces to create the bifaces observed in the
assemblages (see Hester 1985; Meadows and Wilson 1997; Potter 1993; Roemer
1984; Shafer 1979, 1985).
In contrast, notched blades were produced from smaller, more carefully
prepared cores. Blades were then notched along the lateral margins using most
likely a punch technique. The interiors of many of the notches also exhibit
abrasion and grinding, likely to standardize the size and shape of individual
notches. In the present study, notched blades were grouped by the presence of the
striking platform at the proximal terminus, the lack of any lateral flaking on the
dorsal or ventral surfaces, and standardized notches along the lateral margins (see
Illustration 5.5).
While artifacts clearly possessed technological meaning, the forms
produced also possessed symbolic meaning. The variation in form of the
morphological groupings of the bifaces lends itself to symbolic interpretation.
However, despite the standardization of form of the notched blades, their meaning
is much more ambiguous. One interpretation stems from what we have derived as
how the Maya viewed the origin of both microcrystalline silicate and obsidian.
185

Both chert and obsidian were thought to have come from the heart of the sky and
were formed by powerful meteorological phenomena that appeared as thunder,
lightning, and hurricanes. The convergence of heart of sky and heart of earth as
interpreted in Maya cosmology resulted in chert and obsidian present in the
ground (Freidel et al. 1993: 101). It is posited that the notched blades comprised
of highly uniform chert may be abstracted representations of lightning bolts.
Clearly chert crafters placed meaning on the appearance of chert. Such an
meaning attached to chert, in the form of an effigy lightning bolt may refer to the
power of heart of sky (see Tedlock 1985: The Popol Vuh, The Kâicheâ Book of
Counsel for a more detailed discussion of Heart of Sky and Heart of Earth).
Structure of the Descriptions of Blades and Flakes
The structure of the artifact descriptions of blades and flakes is very
similar to the descriptions of the various artifact groupings that were produced on
bifaces. The individual descriptions and selected images also appear in the
Appendix. However, there are some alterations that include data specific to these
particular morphological and technological forms. More specifically, the
platform dimensions, platform angles, and the number of dorsal facets are all
information pertinent to the production of blades and flakes. The notes section at
the end of the individual artifact description conflates descriptions of raw material
texture, breakage patterns along the lateral margins, and description any surface
alteration. Because none of the artifacts exhibited pigments and (or) residues that
particular category was eliminated.

Artifact Grouping: Notched and Perforated Flakes:
The final artifact grouping for the assemblages of flaked stone symbols
under study are notched and perforated flakes. Similar to notched and stemmed
blades, notched flakes also occur with more elaborate bifaces in cache and burial
contexts, primarily from the sites of Colha and Lamanai. And like the notched and
stemmed blades artifact grouping, the notched and perforated flake grouping is a
convergence of morphological and technological characteristics.
Flakes were grouped according to their overall size and evidence of
flaking visible on the surfaces of individual specimens. The primary characteristic
that motivated a separate category is that flakes do not fit the general rule of a
blade. They are generally wider in relation to the overall length. More clearly,
blades are defined as lithic artifacts that are unifacially worked and are twice as

long as it they are wide. In contrast, flakes frequently have irregular flake scarring
visible on the dorsal surfaces.
In terms of the symbolic meaning embodied in the form of individual
artifacts, this category is much more difficult to assess in relation to larger and
more elaborate bifacial forms. The variation in form of individual artifacts makes
classification in more specific artifact groupings difficult if impossible. Thus, if
an initial interpretation of symbolic meaning based on artifact form is possible it
is presented in the notes portion of the individual description. As a final note,
there were no notched or perforated flakes analyzed from Altun Ha, though
smaller and more elaborately worked bifaces produced on obsidian and chert were
present in the artifact assemblages from Altun Ha. The reason for this was that the
focus of the study was larger bifacially worked artifacts produced on local chert.
In terms of the Colha and Lamanai assemblages, notched and perforated flakes
were larger in size when compared to the materials from Altun Ha (see
Appendix).

Chapter 6: Structuring Webs of Meaning
Through Symbolic Analysis
Maya eccentrics or ceremonial flints, referred in this dissertation as flaked
stone symbols, appear in different forms at many sites across the lowlands.
Eccentrics in the form of elaborate composite profiles have been described
extensively from the centers of Tikal and Copan (see Coe 1962, 1990; AgurciaFasquelle and Fash 1991). Composite profile forms also appear locally in
northern Belize, recovered from a Late Postclassic secondary deposit at Laguna
de On (Masson 1997). The artifact groupings presented in Chapter Five, and
recovered from three sites in northern Belize are focused primarily on describing
the morphological and technological markers visible on individual specimens and
groups of specimens.
It is hypothesized that the numerous forms present in the assemblages
from Altun Ha, Colha, and Lamanai, Belize possess symbolic value derived from
parallels with prominent themes present in Maya art. Recent advancement in the
study of Maya hieroglyphics, iconography, and symbolism provides a rich
framework for an analysis of abstracted and naturalistic forms occurring in flaked
stone (see Coe 1990; Freidel et al. 1993; Grube 1994; Kelley 1976; Schele and
Freidel 1990; Schele and Mathews 1999; Schele and Miller 1986; Stuart 1988).
These approaches have relied primarily on art historical and epigraphic analyses
focused on deciphering iconographic and linguistic complexity and patterning.
Many studies assumed works of art were undertaken largely by and for the elite.
One criticism of the art historical approach is that in such studies, symbols
exhibit the same meaning in every cultural context. Clearly, artistic works were
part of a larger process of cultural production and were often viewed by the
public. In viewing the art forms, the political legitimacy of the elite was

190

reinforced. Artistic themes were part of a larger program of legitimating
historically specific power relations manifested as patronage, tribute, and
obligation. However, as argued in Chapter Four, flaked stone symbols may not
have been the artistic medium of the elite. It is suggested here that they were
instead a collective expression of technological and symbolic knowledges by
crafters and associated communities that lived outside elite households. These
communities may have been part of an emergent craft class. Thus, the symbols
depicted in flaked stone demonstrate an intimate knowledge of cosmology, myth,
and historical reality by non- elite communities.
The first goal of this chapter will be to discuss some recent approaches to
the archaeological study of symbols. After which, the morphological groupings of
flaked stone symbols presented in Chapter Five serve as a point of departure in
relating themes prevalent in Maya art and iconography to the forms under study
here. Images from polychrome painted ceramics; murals, stucco, and carved stone
monuments provide comparative data for more specific interpretation of the
meanings of flaked stone artifacts. It is hoped that by presenting such
juxtapositions, the notion that such artifacts were somehow eccentric in shape and
devoid of meaning can be finally dispelled.
It became clear during the construction of the morphological groupings in
Chapter Five, artifact forms from Altun Ha, Colha, and Lamanai exhibited some
continuity with the iconography, and that each form possessed culturally bounded
meaning. The elaboration of forms also varied between assemblages. Individual
specimens represented common themes seen elsewhere in Maya culture.
Moreover, it is argued here that individual artifacts also embody meaning that
was and is negotiated in specific historical moments, as part of a larger process of
cultural production and subsequent cultural evolution (see Robb 1998, 1999).

191

For example, during the Late and Terminal Classic (AD 600- AD 900) as
elaborate chert symbols were acquired and displayed, utilized in warfare, ritual, or
other activities, or sequestered away in elite family shrines, the meanings of these
artifacts shifted within the social contexts in which they were produced and
employed. An artifact that was utilized in public, such as a staff end had a
different meaning to the individual who produced the implement. At the same
time, the forms reflect certain larger organizational structures as indexed in other
artistic media. Briefly, I would like to review some of the approaches to symbols
recently employed in the literature and relate them to the artifact class under
study.
APPROACHES TO THE STUDY OF SYMBOLS IN ARCHAEOLOGY
In an important paper in the Annual Review of Anthropology 1998, and
elaborated later in an edited volume John E. Robb (1998, 1999) synthesizes three
perspectives from which the interpretation of symbols has been undertaken
historically in archaeology. These three approaches are important in a
consideration of ancient Maya flaked stone symbols. A brief review of some of
the problems of studying symbols archaeologically is presented below. After
which a summary of each approach is reviewed to construct a framework for
understanding this particular artifact class.
The study of symbols has to some degree been mired in folk models that
distinguish between a tangible material world and an invisible world of ideas and
emotions (Robb 1998). This model reflects the arbitrary division between the
sciences and humanities as well as the division between objective and subjective
knowledge permeating archaeology today. Indeed, the dominance of the former
approach has resulted in the emergence of a kind of theoretical materialism, in
which signs speak for themselves and that the object of study is purely material

192

(Robb 1998: 330). This reduces the complex processes involved in the production
and use of an artifact in cultural context as relating solely to economy and (or)
subsistence.
The conflation of technology and subsistence and our ability to make
factual statements with regards to material process in some ways denies the
notion that symbolism and ideology are critical to the application of technological
practices. Ideology contextualizes all cultural practice. Indeed, the social fact that
production is entwined within a culturally bounded ideological framework begs
the question of whether there is anything of cultural origin that is not symbolic? It
is posited here that economic and material use cannot be easily separated from the
symbolic aspects of material culture.
Current archaeological studies of symbols originate from many sources,
many of the approaches (including processual, structural Marxist, and
evolutionary approaches) have begun to converge in a general framework
involving cultural actors and symbols (Robb 1998: 332). Researchers interested in
social evolution have begun to view increasing social integration and complexity
as the result of motivated human actors (see Bourdieu 1977; also Clark and Blake
1994). Marxist and structural approaches have moved away from a priori and
monolithic structural causation to more localized and dialectical interplay
between institutions and individuals and communities of actors (Saitta 1991;
Saitta and McGuire 1996). The shift to a more particular approach reflects
conceptions that view culture as fragmented and contested, rather than integrative
and normative (see Robb 1998).
The first approach discussed by Robb (1998) is what he labels the
information/ transmission view. This view is the most frequently employed by
archaeologists and originates from a processual and functional evolutionary
approach to culture. In this view, symbols are seen as tokens representing specific
193

meanings that are deployed through certain strategies, resulting in the emergence
of predictable economies of representation, namely the exercise of power (Robb
1998: 333). Artifacts transmit information through stylistic variation, which then
can be de- coded through the study of such variation and (or) similarity (Wobst
1977).
In this sense, symbols are displayed as a part of differing strategies to
consolidate power or deployed as instruments of social control (Clark and Blake
1994). Symbols are critical to groups legitimating and maintaining power. The
most relevant critique of this view is that symbols do not simply represent power
relations, but indeed constitute them (Robb 1998). The interpretation of symbols
solely as tokens of representation relies heavily on the notion of individuals and
groups whose primary motivations for producing and deploying symbols is social
control. This dismisses many symbolic aspects of material culture that do not
appear to be practical in composition. In Maya studies, the view of public art as
constitutive of an iconography of power has played an important role in
understanding ancient Maya symbol systems (Schele and Freidel 1990; Schele
and Miller 1986). However, while the understanding of power relations as
represented and hidden by symbols is important, we must also understand how
symbols structure power.
The second approach discussed by Robb (1998: 333- 334) and considered
important in terms of the assemblages of Maya flaked stone symbols under study
is the mental reality or structural approach. This approach centers on the notion
that while individual human ambition may be part of a symbol's use life, the
emphasis of interpretation is on how humans orient themselves in the world. How
do humans think and act through culturally specific structures that recur in the
organization and production of material culture (Robb 1998: 335)? In this
semiotic view, symbols structure human social reality (Hodder ed. 1982; Tilley
194

ed. 1993). This approach has been employed relatively recently in the analysis of
culturally bounded space in the European Neolithic (Hodder 1982, 1982).
It is posited here that such an approach has validity in the case of ancient
Maya flaked stone symbols, as the convergence of technological and symbolic
knowledges places an emphasis on a common ontology shared by the crafters and
their associated communities. Moreover, this ontology was also shared with the
elite communities who acquired and deployed material culture. These objects not
only reflect how historically specific ancient Maya communities perceived the
world, but they constituted the way these communities structured their world.
Perhaps the most relevant criticism of this approach is the question of what basic
concepts actually structure and constitute power within a particular culture (Robb
1998: 35). In the Maya case, it seems clear that a common creation myth and a
potent supernatural reality entwined with a dynamic historical reality structured
perceptions of political and economic relationships.
The third approach discussed by Robb (1998) is focused on the notion that
while material culture may both represent and constitute meaning in different
contexts, it is also culturally and historically emergent, that meanings are dynamic
and change through time and across social contexts. Thus, the meanings grafted
on to symbols are a mosaic that are not fixed but subject to negotiation at specific
moments (Robb 1998: 337). This approach moves away from the formal qualities
of material culture and focuses on how symbols were experienced and thus fit into
a larger montage of culturally produced images. This perspective necessitates a
close contextual analysis of material culture across archaeological and social
contexts.

And yet the critique of this approach comes from the fact that

interpretations are often homogenized, as meaning is viewed as arbitrary and
without cultural antecedents (Robb 1998: 337).

195

ANCIENT MAYA ICONOGRAPHY AND FLAKED STONE SYMBOLS
In Maya studies, both archaeology and art history have provided a rich
body of data comprised of ancient Maya art and iconography for interpretation.
This data is often accompanied by equally rich interpretations that rely primarily
on both the information/ transmission view and the structural/ constitutive view
(see Freidel et al. 1993; Schele and Freidel 1990; Schele and Miller 1986). In this
view, even the most humble cultural artifact form is directly related to larger
mythological and cosmological phenomena. However, there has been some effort
to frame the production of works of art also encompassed a symbolic reality that
structured power relations between the elite and the masses, as well as provided a
medium through which communities could craft identity and negotiate power
with other communities (see Bartlett and McAnany 2000; Reents- Budet 1998).
Maya art was inscribed with a symbolic language that combined iconography and
written texts that was shared by the individuals and groups who made, displayed,
and viewed them (Schele and Miller 1986). Different communities had different
levels of access to knowledge, and the body of knowledge that they possessed
was both shaped and manipulated by its possessors.
In the analysis that follows, images drawn from other ancient Maya
artistic media are employed to support the notion that the class of lithic artifacts
under study both represents and constitutes symbolic meaning. And yet, the
meaning of objects and groups of objects likely changed as processes of
production, acquisition, and use unfolded through time and across space. As seen
in Chapter Five, morphological similarity prompted the construction of groupings
based on similar form. In this chapter, images of flaked stone symbols are
compared to images derived from other artistic media to support an interpretation
that these artifacts indeed are part of a larger cultural aesthetic and reflect
symbolic and structural aspects of Maya society.
196

The images that provide the basis for the interpretation of flaked stone
symbols originate from a number of sites across the Maya lowlands, including
other artistic media at the sites included in the study. Images inscribed on carved
stone monuments, painted polychrome ceramics, stucco, and mural art appear in
conjunction with depictions of flaked stone artifacts from morphological
groupings. The analysis number and the site number identify individual artifacts.
This provides for easier reference to the artifact's individual description presented
in the appendix. Implicit in this kind of analysis, is that the comparative data
originating from different sites across the lowlands reinforces the idea of a panMaya symbolic system (or language) that structured both cosmology and
historical and social reality. All of the comparative works date to the Classic
Period (AD 250- AD 900). The larger narratives surrounding individual works
used in the comparison are omitted.
Depictions of Captives and Sacrifice
As stated in the definition of the morphological grouping in Chapter Five,
the taking of captives was critical to both the individual in terms of demonstrating
skills in warfare and the community in terms of demonstrating political
legitimacy. Skill at taking captives showed that opponents could be subdued and
enslaved as prospective servants, opponents in a public ballgame, and (or) ritual
sacrifice. Images of captives occur frequently in Maya art.

197

Figure 6.1- r77LA244/6 Lamanai
As will be seen in this chapter, chert crafters utilized similar artistic
techniques to execute particular chert forms. This is perhaps most obvious in
specimen r77LA244/6 (Figure 6.1), a captive form recovered from an axial cache
in an elite house complex at Lamanai (structure N10- 15). In this form, the arms
are depicted as bound behind the back and the legs are foreshortened as if the
individual was on the knees. It appears as if the upper torso or the head is twisted
to depict a facial profile. This specimen prompted the notion that some of the
captive forms in the assemblages of flaked stone symbols actually depict
historical figures who were captured in conflict. Specimen ah8RP137/55 also
appears to depict a captive according to similar criteria. The specimen exhibits the
simple headdress, triangular outline of the arms, and what appear to be

198

Figure 6.2- a. Altar 23 Caracol
(from Grube 1994)

b. Lintel 16 Yaxchilan
(from Schele and Miller 1986)

foreshortened arms. As noted in Chapter Five, the specimen is covered with red
and yellow pigment (see also Figure 5.1).
Perhaps one of the largest depictions of bound captives can be observed
on the surface of Altar 23 from Caracol a large Classic Period center located on
the Vacca Plateau of western Belize (Chase and Chase 1987, 1994; Grube 1994).
Altar 23 depicts two captive nobles from the nearby and smaller sites of Ucanal
and Bital, located to the west of Caracol. The medium of the altar is carved
limestone (see Grube 1994: 84).
The captives are bound with their arms behind them and are stripped of
all elaborate clothing. Simple headdresses adorn the heads of the captives and
they are seated with legs crossed in a passive posture. The binding of the arms
creates a triangle outline of the upper torso. The technique of depicting arms
provides one of the defining criteria for identifying captives in the assemblages of
flaked stone symbols. It is posited that the depiction of a captive with arms bound

199

behind the back implies the captive is completely subdued and under the sway of
the individuals who took the captive (Figure 6.2a).
The second image of a bound captive originates from Yaxchilan, a major
Classic Period center along the Usamacinta River (Schele and Miller 1986: 235).
Lintel 16 at Yaxchilan, comprised of carved limestone, depicts a captive with
arms unbound, in a passive body posture. What is important in this depiction is
the way the legs are foreshortened to depict the individual on the knees.
Moreover, the upper torso is twisted to depict the profile of the individual. These
artistic techniques are common aspects included in Maya art (Figure 6.2b).
In concert with the interpretation of captives as historical personages, the
notion of captive has origins in the Maya creation myth and the conflict between
the mythical Hero Twins and the Lords of Death (see Tedlock 1985). Other
captive forms depicted in flaked stone do not possess the clear profile, but do
exhibit simple headdresses, bound arms, and foreshortened legs. These lessdetailed forms occur primarily in the Altun Ha assemblage (see Appendix).
Related to depictions of captives, sacrifice was important for political
legitimation and public ritual. Sacrifice victims were in many instance captives,
but sacrifices of other individuals also likely took place. Sacrifice victims appear
in the medium of flaked stone. The critical attributes for identifying captives is
the extension of the appendages and the depiction of the upturned head to reveal a
profile. These features are perhaps most clear in a specimen from Altun Ha.
Blood sacrifice took many forms namely auto- sacrifice as well as ritualized and
public sacrifice. As Schele and Miller (1986) and Freidel et al. (1993) articulate,
blood was the mortar of Maya religious life. The ritualized spilling of blood via
sacrifice was necessary in order to cleanse as well as anchor the present in the
face of a volatile and dynamic Otherworld. Captives were dealt with in a number
of ways.
200

Figure 6.3- ah209RP188/5 sacrifice from Altun Ha
These include decapitation, disembowelment, dismemberment, heart excision,
and immolation (Schele and Miller 1986). Thus, sacrifice structured how ancient
Maya communities viewed the world. Sacrifice also structured power relations
between the elite who engaged in public ritual and sacrifice as pageant and other
segments of ancient Maya society. Perhaps the best example of this is specimen
ah258RP38/55 that shows an upturned profile, an incised circle at the location of
the heart, and red colored surface alteration across what corresponds to the
thoracic region of the individual (see Figure 5.3).
Specimen ah209RP188/5 is also a good example of a captive with
outstretched appendages and upturned facial profile. The facial profile is subtle,
but was achieved through patterned flake scarring. The profile is clearly visible if
one takes into account the detail of execution visible in other media (Figure 6.3).

201

Figure 6.4- ah26RP98/19 ball player from Altun Ha
Ball Players
The ballgame was important as a ritualized game of sport to both elite
groups and the popular masses. Ballgames often placed war captives against elite
players in site centers. In Classic Maya art, dynastic and temporal transformations
were emphasized to a far greater degree than ritual renewal. However, in some
instances the ball game does appear to be ritualized (Cohodas 1991: 255). Ball
game imagery dates to the Early Classic on painted polychrome ceramics from
the central Peten. Ball players are often depicted as rulers with exaggerated waist
yokes. The presence of an exaggerated waist yoke is a defining criterion for
identifying ball players depicted in flaked stone (Figure 6.4).
In depictions of ball players in carved stone, the ball is often shown
between two players with a glyph inclusion (Cohodas 1991: 256). Overall the ball
players are depicted in naturalized poses with little indication of supernatural
attributes. Ballgames on funerary ceramics are often paralleled with the hunt and

202

Figure 6.5- Ballcourt marker from Yaxchilan
(from Schele and Miller 1986)
(or) the confrontation with the old god. On carved monuments, ball game imagery
is associated with capture, sacrifice, and warfare (Chase and Chase 1987: 33;
Cohodas 1991: 269). The ballgame is also associated with the Hero Twins, who
defeated the Lords of Death so that the Maya could live in this creation (see
Tedlock 1985). The Hero Twins are part of ballgame imagery during Classic and
Postclassic times.
The link between the ballgame, captives, warfare, and sacrifice is clear
(Figure 6.5). Oftentimes the losing players were sacrificed in public ceremony,
likely as part of a larger festival. The ballgame integrated political and historical
events in a religious context. The ballgame was yet another institution that linked
the political and the religious in ancient Maya social life. This linkage reflects the
importance of the ballgame to all aspects of Maya society. This importance is
reflected in the association of the ballgame and a paradigm of transformation
through sacrifice and victory keeping the natural and social world intact (Cohodas
1991; Schele and Freidel 1991). As articulated previously, ball players depicted in
flaked stone are recognized by the presence of a waist yoke. However, other
important attributes of ball player figures are the positioning of the feet, and the

203

Figure 6.6- Step VII Structure 33 Yaxchilan (from Schele and Miller 1986)
headdress. Similar to captives, ball players may be historical figures that were
captured in warfare or indeed, may be a depiction of the possessor of the form as
part of the process of political legitimation.
Perhaps the best examples of ball players appearing in the medium of
flaked stone are present in the Altun Ha assemblage. Specimen ah26RP98/19
from Altun Ha is also documented in Chapter Five (Figure 6.4). Another good
example of a ball player is specimen ah92RP98/33. This specimen exhibits an
exaggerated waist yoke and clearly defined feet. Also the figure's arms are drawn
to the side rather than extended (see Appendix).
Steps VI through VIII on Temple 33 at Yaxchilan depicts Bird Jaguar
playing the ball game with a bound human captive. The medium is carved
limestone (Figure 6.6). In this scene Bird Jaguar plays a ball game after his
father's death in AD 744 (Schele and Freidel 1990: 283). Bird Jaguar is dressed in
elaborate ritual paraphernalia that related his game to the distant mythological
past, placing the game in a sacred context. This ritualized form of the game was
an important legitimating event, and clearly structured transfer of power.

204

Figure 6.7- ah184RP188/12
Gendered Forms
As articulated to some degree in Chapter Five, the culturally specific
definitions of gender are the result of both cultural and biological factors (see
Gero and Conkey 1991; Wright 1996; Yates 1993). Female forms depicted in
flaked stone show characteristics that to some degree define their gender within
the context of Classic Period Maya society. With respect to depictions of
gendered forms, it is important to look at how female forms were depicted in
other cultural contexts. Symbolic analysis of gendered figures from the
Mesolithic and Neolithic site of Lepenski Vir in eastern Europe shows female
forms as depicted with broad lower abdominal areas and often adorned with red
pigment (Handsman 1991). Indeed, red pigment appears on specimen r72LA395/
from Lamanai (Figure 5.5)(see also Gero and Conkey 1991). This specimen may
depict the sacrifice of a woman as illustrated by the upturned profile, presence of
red pigment, and broad lower torso.

205

Figure 6.8- Lintel 15 Yaxchilan, Xoc with vision serpent
(from Schele and Miller 1986)
A number of other specimens from Altun Ha appear to be depictions of
females, exhibiting similar attributes such as widened abdomen and facial
profiles. Specimen ah184RP188/12 is an example of what appears to be the
depiction of a female from Altun Ha (Figure 6.7).
It is clear from what appear to be female forms present in the assemblages
and female forms appearing in other artistic media, there was complex gender
differentiation in Classic Maya society. Women often possessed political power
(Schele and Freidel 1990). In the medium of flaked stone, it appears that the
forms may not have demonstrated political authority, but instead perhaps are
representations of wives or consorts of the entombed (see Pendergast 1979 re:
artifact associations in Tomb A-1/1 at Altun Ha).
Women appear on numerous Late Classic monuments from the lowland
centers of Dos Pilas, Palenque and Yaxchilan among others (Schele and Freidel

206

1990). In depictions on carved stone, women occupy positions of political and
religious power. For example, on Lintel 15 at Yaxchilan, Xoc, who was the
primary wife of Bird Jaguar appears with a vision serpent, posited to be the
founder of the ruling dynasty, Yat Balam (Schele and Freidel 1990)(Figure 6.8).
As these depictions illustrate, elite women played critical roles in Classic Period
Maya society. The appearance of female forms rendered in flaked stone reinforce
the notion that gender is a complex culturally- bound phenomenon that can be
observed in different forms of artistic media.
Zoomorphic Forms: Serpents
Serpent imagery is one of the most frequent and diverse images appearing
in Maya art. The serpent held critical symbolic importance for the ancient Maya.
First, in Maya belief systems, a giant serpent comprised the sky. Indeed, the word
for snake is also the same word for sky (kan), as well as for the color blue, and the
number four (Houston 1984). Spinden (1975: 71) asserts that the serpent may
have been more important in art than in actual religious ritual. That is, the serpent
in this case was assumed to exist as the abstracted sky itself, and was not a part of
animistic ritual.
The body form of the serpent furnished numerous themes and possibilities
of artistic development. And serpents appearing in the medium of flaked stone
are no exception. Like other animal forms, serpents are naturalized, but can also
appear as idealizations that reflect certain religious themes or events (Spinden
1975: 33). Specimen ah151RP528/ is an example that depicts what appears to be
a serpent. The notches visible along the lateral margins of the specimen are

207

Figure 6.9- ah151RP528/10
interpreted to indicate motion. This implied dynamic is replicated in other serpent
forms in the assemblage.
Serpent imagery was fundamental to rulership as manifest in the serpent
bar (Schele and Freidel 1990: 68). Serpents also carried the ancestors from the
Otherworld back to the present creation by appearing in hallucinatory visions.
Serpents imbued places, objects, and people with power. A number of
incarnations of gods, including k'awil as God K exhibit a serpent as one leg or one
foot. Indeed, specimen ah180RP35/14 from Altun Ha appears to depict God K
with a serpent foot (see Figure 6.24).
The proliferation of the belief that the serpent is embodied as the sky may
be linked to the feathered serpent as Quetzalcoatl, originating from Central
Mexico. A large number of what may be interpreted as serpent forms are present
in the assemblages, including serpents that are both in motion and still, depicted
with both open and closed mouths. The example I would like to use is much less
clear in terms of archaeological context. However, the elaboration of the lithic
technology on highly uniform chert perhaps marks this specimen as the finest

208

Figure 6.10- r85LA/ feathered serpent from Lamanai
example of individual craft skill in the Lamanai assemblage (Figure 6.10). We
can clearly observe the fine flaking across the medial surfaces of r85LA/, as well
as carefully controlled hammer technology exhibited by the serrations along the
margins. This piece is interpreted here as depicting a feathered serpent. With the
context unknown, what we have is the form itself to tell us of the technological
and symbolic knowledge executed by its maker. First, visible on this piece we
have the integration of raw material coloration as part of an eye. Second, we have
the notches along the margins depicting a dynamic motion to the form. Third, we
have the serration along the margins depicting the elaborate feathered plumes of
Quetzalcoatl (Figure 6.11).
The depiction of the feathered serpent indicates knowledge of iconography
perhaps dating to the influence of Central Mexico in the eastern Maya

209

Figure 6.11- Feathered serpent from Xochimilco AD 250 (from Adams 1996)
lowlands, during the Early Classic (AD 250- AD 600). As well, the lithic
depiction of the feathered serpent displays knowledge of a deity that exercised
influence across Mesoamerica (see Adams 1991: 260; Sharer 1994). Thus, the
form embodies symbolic knowledge of an important deity that links the chert
crafter to an aspect of an ephemeral and far- reaching Mesoamerican ideology in
addition to serving as ritual implements in elaborate blood offerings.
Felines and Canines
Of course feline imagery was an integral theme in Maya cosmology and
art. The jaguar was a symbol of strength and fertility (Spinden 1975). The jaguar
has religious significance across Mesoamerica dating to the Olmec culture (1500
BC- 400 BC). To the ancient Maya, the jaguar possessed a religious importance
perhaps only secondary to the serpent (Spinden 1975: 76). Indeed, many gods and
rulers had feline incarnations. One example, the Chaks or rain gods of the fourcorners of the earth exhibited incarnations as this large cat indigenous to the
Maya lowlands. The jaguar as sun god has been interpreted to be the celestial
incarnation of the Hero Twins were reborn and defeated the Lords of Death
(Schele and Freidel 1990). Jaguar imagery was also associated with political
authority. During the Classic Period, jaguar imagery represented the king or ahau.

210

Figure 6.12- ah218RP35/26 Altun Ha
At Tikal, jaguar imagery is found in the earliest depiction of a Maya king on Stela
23 (Schele and Freidel 1990).
More generally, feline imagery was often associated with transformation
and animal spirit companions (Figure 6.12). A wayob is defined as an animal
spirit companions were often depicted in both zoomorphic and anthropomorphic
forms (Figure 6.13). In the morphological groupings of felines appearing in the
assemblages of flakes stone, in two examples the feline exhibits what appears to
be a human face. One example I would like to use is also an artifact from the
Lamanai assemblage. Specimen ah80LA244/22 was recovered from one of the
two large axial caches located high on structure N10-9 (Figure 6.14).
This cache is dated to the Terminal Classic Period (AD 800- AD 900) and
is one of two dedicatory caches that commemorated the construction of the final
structures atop this massive example of public architecture. Specimen
r80LA244/22 clearly depicts a feline form perhaps one of the smaller cats

211

a.

Figure 6.13- a. jaguar wayob painted vessel from Seibal (Freidel et al. 1993)
b. jaguar wayob (from Schele and Mathews 1998)
indigenous to the region, an ocelot or marguey. The naturalized body position
illustrates this. However, upon closer inspection, the facial profile of the specimen
appears as that of an anthropomorphic form. The subtle use of flake scarring and
cortex depicts the eye and ears of the feline. But, it seems that the feline exhibits a
human face. The snout or nose is clearly not feline.
The presence of human visages on animal bodies is not a rare occurrence
in the assemblages of zoomorphic forms. The transformation of humans into
animals and vice versa was an important element in Maya religious and social life
(see Freidel et al. 1993: 202- 203). Certainly the boundaries between human and
animal worlds were not the same as our own. If we can interpret the facial profile
as human, we can assume the crafter who created this form clearly possessed
knowledge of the transformative nature of humans and animals. The naturalized
body form utilizing the raw material to depict coat pattern and the human face are
remarkable in terms of the exhibition of culturally bounded knowledge of the
world.

212

Figure 6.14- r80LA244/22 Lamanai
If we can assume the profile of specimen r80LA244/22 is human, the
depiction of wayob can also be inferred. Though it is unclear whose wayob is
depicted. Indeed, this critter may have depicted more than one person's wayob if
more than one person possessed it. In any case, knowledge of the transformative
interaction between humans and animals is demonstrated.
Canines occur much less frequently in the literature. We know that dogs
were probably the most common domesticated animals in the lowlands. Dogs
appear to be associated with the mundane world. This does not preclude the
notion that dogs also moved back and forth between the real world and the Other
World. Indeed, when appearing in the medium of flaked stone, one example from
the Altun Ha assemblage may exhibit a human profile. This suggests that dogs
were also associated with transformation and wayob as shown in specimen
r13LA/ (see Figure 5.9b). A number of canine depictions as well as other
mammals are visible in the Altun Ha assemblage also presented in Chapter Five
(Figure 6.15).

213

Figure 6.15- ah205RP200/403 Altun Ha
Other zoomorphic forms that exhibit correlation with forms that appear in
ancient Maya artistic media are shown below. Rabbits were often associated with
scribes in Maya myth and iconography. As shown below, the rabbit appears as a
scribe on the Princeton pot, recovered from a site in the Peten (Schele and Miller
1986). The rabbit shows both animal and human features, again illustrative of
transformation between human and animal. This kind of form may index the
wayob, as human scribes may have had the ability to transform into rabbit form.
The rabbit also appears in the medium of flaked stone. The specimen shown
below exhibits features that. Also notice the pigment visible on the medial distal
surface of the form, indicating artistic and (or) ritual elaboration of the
appearance of the form (Figure 6.16a & b). Also shown above are two images of
peccaries. The line drawing is an image appearing on a painted vessel from an
unknown context in the lowlands (Freidel et al. 1993). The peccary had ritual
significance to the Maya and was associated with fertility and the Otherworld. Of
note is the kin in sign present

on the back of the peccary. The kin sign is associated with the sun and the term
for a day in the long count. These associations link the peccary with the origin of
the cosmos. It has been suggested that the peccary appears in the sky as the
constellation we know as Gemini (see Freidel et al. 1993). In other examples, the
maize god is shown emerging from an opening in the back of a peccary. The
peccary also appears in the medium of flaked stone. This example exhibits the
form of a peccary, especially noticeable in what appears to be the snout of the
form (Figure 6.16c & d).
Birds
Birds appear as imagery in a variety of artistic media. In the creation
myth, the giant bird known as Itzam Ye or the celestial bird was described as the
false sun (see Freidel et al. 1993; Schele and Mathews 1999; Tedlock 1985). In
the creation myth of the Popol Vuh, this figure claimed to be the true sun god and
had to be defeated by the Hero Twins. After firing a blowgun at the tree in which
the giant bird was perched, the Hero Twins swarmed the tree and killed the false
sun. Itzam Ye as the false sun was defeated and cast into the night sky as the
North Star (Tedlock 1996). Bird imagery and birds, more specifically the quetzal
appeared in numerous artistic works, oftentimes associated with headdresses and
the world tree, as clearly seen in the Tablet of the Cross from Palenque (Schele
and Miller 1986).
In the assemblages of the flaked stone symbols under study, birds appear
as individual specimens as well as part of composite forms, such as the example
from Lamanai (see Appendix). Birds also appear in composite artifacts that may
have been hafted or handled. The specimen below shows what appears to be a
form of a quetzal. The correspondence with the false sun appearing at the top of

216

b. depiction of Itzam Ye from Tablet of Cross (Freidel et al. 1993)

the world tree is illustrated in Figure 6.17a & b. Also of note is the yellow
pigment present on the cortex. This pigment is thick and exhibits texture.
Crocodiles and Turtles
The turtle and the crocodile both played an important role in the
cosmology and symbolism of the ancient Maya. This of course translates into
frequent appearance in art. Both the turtle and the crocodile were believed to be
the surfaces on which the present world was created. As documented in Chapter
5, the crocodile has an important place at Lamanai. The crocodile appears
multiple times in effigy ceramics dated to the Classic Period. In the assemblage of
flaked stone, numerous complete crocodile forms can be observed, as well one
form that depicts the head of a crocodile. These images show that crafters of
flaked stone were depicting naturalized forms of animals that lived in proximity
to Maya centers, as well as possessed supernatural correlates. The crocodile may
also have served as a wayob, as one Late Classic example exhibits a human head

217

b.
Figure 6.18- a. ah67RP694/4 Altun Ha
b. Maize God in turtle carapace (from Schele and Miller 1986)
inside the open mouth of a crocodile. The best example of a crocodile depicted in
flaked stone as presented in Chapter Five is specimen r58LA244/14 from
Lamanai (see Figure 5.10a).
The turtle also was believed to have comprised the surface of the earth on
which the present creation was located. Indeed, the turtle appears on the surface
of a well- known painted polychrome plate. In this scene, it has been interpreted
that the Maize God emerges from the crack in the turtle carapace. The turtle also
appears on the surface of another jar, which depicts a Chakob cracking open a
turtle carapace so, again the Maize God can merge (see Freidel et al. 1993).
Moreover, according to the interpretation of the same scholars, what has been
termed the turtle of rebirth appears as the belt of Orion (see Freidel et al. 1992:
80). In the flaked stone depiction, two specimens from Lamanai and Altun Ha,
respectively depict what are seemingly much more humble examples of turtles
(Figure 6.18 a & b).

218

Figure 6.19- a. r1LA/ Lamanai
b. scorpion and Itzam Ye from painted vessel (Freidel et al. 1990)
Scorpions
The ancient Maya duly noted the transformation of humans and animals.
These transformations were important metaphors for cosmology and history.
Centipedes were important in transformation imagery. Scorpions also appear in
Maya art as part of the dangers of the natural world. Indeed, the scorpion is
depicted on painted ceramics and in depictions of the defeat of the Hero Twins
over Itzam Ye, the false sun (Figure 6.19a & b)(see Freidel et al. 1993; Tedlock
1985).
Crescents and Stemmed Disks: Personified and Celestial Bodies
As has been extensively documented, the Maya observed and predicted
complex astronomical phenomena (Aveni 1990; Freidel et al. 1993). It is
currently unclear the degree to which they were able to predict the occurrence of
planetary convergence, the appearance of constellations and comets, and eclipses.
However, what is becoming clear is that the Maya associated specific star clusters
with characters in Maya mythology. According to Freidel et al. (1993), the
constellation
219

b.
Figure 6.20-

b. ah309RP314/133 Altun Ha
220

we know as Orion was fraught with mythological imagery, including what has
been posited as the three hearth stones and the turtle of creation. Aveni (1990) has
shown that the ancient Maya practiced a vibrant astronomy, and these
observations were integrated in their daily lives, to record time, and to position
events in a larger cosmological and historical context.
Aveni (1990: 27) asserts that an eclipse of the sun and the moon are
pictured in the Florentine Codex. The Codex asserts that the appearance of a
comet foretold the death of a leader. In terms of other celestial events, a series of
solar eclipses would have been visible to all of Mesoamerica during the Early
Classic and Classic Periods. Total solar eclipses visible in the Maya area occurred
in AD 138 and AD 290 (Aveni 1990: 81). These eclipses were a source of great
fear and foreboding. Moreover, planetary movements were also important,
especially the movements of Mercury and Venus. Venus especially was observed,
perhaps because it was linked with the sun as the celestial incarnation of the Hero
Twins (Schele and Freidel 1990). Maya conceptions of death and rebirth, sowing
and dawning, find symbolic expression in interplay between these two celestial
bodies (Aveni 1990: 86; Schele and Freidel 1990).
Crescents appear as supernatural creatures, perhaps as the sun devouring
the moon or the moon devouring other celestial bodies as was thought to occur
during both eclipses and convergence (Figure 6.20a & b). Observe the pigment
visible on the surface of r53LA395/ (Figure 6.20a). Crescent forms are
personified as presented in Chapter Five. These appear as different profiles with
eye and mouth features. The sky and the sun were also personified it is posited
that these personifications appear to be visible in the medium of flaked stone.
Monsters appear perhaps most frequently as masks on the exterior of structures
(Schele and Freidel 1990). These masks are often identified as witz (mountain)
monsters. The
221

Figure 6.21- ah327RP364/63 Altun Ha
facade on structure E-VII-sub from Uaxactun is perhaps the most well known
depictions of earth monsters as masks. It is posited here that at least one artifact
form recovered from Altun Ha exhibits an earth monster (Figure 6.20b).
A frequently occurring form in the assemblages is termed the stemmed
disk. These have also been called hand mirrors (see Pendergast 1979). They come
in a variety of styles (see Appendix). However, no artifact exhibits a stem that
exhibits extensive handling polish. This seems to eliminate the supposition that
these are mirrors or even weapons. It is posited here that the appearance of
comets may be inscribed in flaked stone as this artifact form (Figure 6.21).
Numerous stemmed disks appear in both the Lamanai and the Altun Ha
assemblages. The red staining on the form shown above and barbs visible on a
second from Altun Ha indicates variability in the depiction of these forms.

222

Star and Ring Forms
Star forms also appear in the medium of flaked stone. Stars may have
represented specific celestial bodies. Stars that exhibit nine barbs occur most
frequently. As documented in Chapter Five and in Appendix A, star forms exhibit
pigment and drawings were applied to the surface. One example, specimen
r63LA240/19 from Lamanai exhibits both red and yellow pigments (Figure 6.22).
This specimen shows pigments that form the profiles of several creatures
emerging from the border of the star. A second example from Altun Ha (specimen
ah41RP697/2 clearly exhibits a seated figure facing to the right comprised of red
pigment (see Appendix). The pigment on this specimen has deteriorated, but the
outline of the form is clearly visible.
Star forms begin to be more abstracted from naturalized representations
seen in human and animal depictions. However, they clearly possessed meaning
and were reproduced in fairly large numbers. If indeed these forms were
associated with celestial bodies, they linked the mythical past and the present
creation. As well, some of the star forms exhibit perforations, perhaps these rings
represent portals. Or from a more utilitarian perspective, were used to haft the
forms.
After interpreting the naturalized anthropomorphic and zoomorphic forms
and the personified crescents, a symbolic interpretation of star and ring forms is
more difficult. The meanings of the forms are abstract. Rings appear frequently in
all three assemblages. Oftentimes they exhibit serrations and barbs. Perhaps the
best example of a ring form is a large, serrated ring recovered from a Late
Preclassic cache at Colha (Figure 6.23). As abstractions, we must broaden the
interpretation to include notions of a cultural aesthetic that may not have had
immediate representative meaning. A search of literature of depictions of Maya
art yielded numerous depictions of both star and ring forms that were part of
223

Figure 6.22- r63LA240/19 star form with pigment Lamanai
a technique for defining the borders of a particular scene. This indicates that
forms structured the way Maya artists conceived of scenes, part of an aesthetic
sensibility that was manifest in the medium of flaked stone. Moreover,
transformations, openings, and portals were important themes in Maya
mythology. Many structures were built over caves, which likely served as portals
to other creations and perhaps the Underworld (Freidel et al. 1993).
It is suggested here that these perforations may index portals. The
perforations in specific artifacts are not directly representing a specific portal, but
are part of a cultural aesthetic. Indeed, in a functional sense, many of the
perforated forms exhibit striations and burnishing on the interior. This perhaps
indicates the use of the perforation as part of a hafting element. Thus, a form that
may index a broad structuring concept such as a portal or opening can also be
linked to a functional role such as hafting for public display (Figure 6.23).

224

Figure 6.23- cr75CH2012/13- 15 Colha
Tetrafoil and Trefoil Forms
This same interpretive approach can be applied to tetrafoils and trefoils,
objects that appear in large numbers in the assemblages from Altun Ha and
Lamanai. Both a quadripartite and tripartite divisions were inherent in Maya
thought. We know that the present creation was divided into four areas and the
fifth direction defined as up. This organization is indexed in the tetrafoil form.
Moreover, tetrafoil forms also occur as borders in other artistic media. Initially, it
was thought that these forms might have been used in a more functional context,
perhaps as weapons. However, there is little evidence that these forms were
extensively handled or mounted. There is also some variation in how tetrafoils are
depicted. As illustrated in the appendix, most tetrafoil forms exhibit elongated

225

appendages. Two forms, one from Altun Ha and one from Lamanai exhibit short
and round appendages. These forms appear remarkably similar to the kin sign,
which serves as both a day sign and part of the glyph for sun.
Trefoil forms also lack extensive evidence of handling or mounting.
However, one form from Altun Ha exhibits pigment staining on the surface of the
form. The trefoil can be linked to the three worlds where ancestors, animals, and
rulers lived. These include the Underworld, occupied by the Lords of Death and
the Otherworld, the place of creation and of the ancestors. Moreover, much has
been written about the three hearth stones of creation as structuring everything
from structure location to how the Maya viewed the constellation we know as
Orion (see Freidel et al. 1993). It is posited here that the trefoil form may index
these structuring concepts, but did not represent them directly. The trefoil, like the
tetrafoil had many correlates in Maya art because it was part of a larger aesthetic
that structured how the world was organized (see Appendix).
Composite Forms
Unlike the naturalized forms seen in anthropomorphic and zoomorphic
forms and the more abstract symbols seen in star, ring, trefoil, and tetrafoil forms,
a number of composite forms as godheads and ancestors are present in the
assemblages.

These

forms

resemble,

to

some

degree,

the

elaborate

anthropomorphic profiles appearing at Copan and also recovered in northern
Belize (Agurcia- Fasquelle and Fash 1991; Masson 1997). These forms embody
specific information about both mythological and historical figures. In the
assemblages under study here, it is interpreted that specimen ah180RP35/14
appears as the depiction of God K, with a serpent foot (Freidel et al. 1993)(Figure
6.24). More elaborate composite forms are also present in the assemblages.

226

Figure 6.24- ah180RP35/14 God K with serpent foot from Altun Ha
Specimen ah255RP38/50, recovered from Altun Ha is a composite form
that depicts a serpent with an open mouth. Protruding from the open mouth is a
human profile. It is unclear if this is a historical figure, but may be a similar
depiction as those appearing in the scenes of vision serpents (Figure 6.25).
Composite forms also appear as painted figures on large staff ends.
Specimen ah90RP528/2 from Altun Ha is a large staff that exhibits a yellow
serpent form across one surface (see Appendix). As described in the appendix, the
serpent form exhibits a head that has been scraped away. The staff also exhibits
227

Figure 6.25- ah255RP38/60 Altun Ha
extensive polish at one terminus. This area appears to be an area where the staff
was handled extensively. This serpent staff fits into the wand and stave
classification as seen in McKinney (1985).
Vision Serpents
Specimen ah252RP200/387 was recovered from the chamber of tomb A1/1 at Altun Ha, in a cache of flints placed at the southeast corner of the crypt
(Figure 6.26)(Pendergast 1979: 60- 75). In addition to a large number of flaked
stone symbols, the tomb yielded numerous jade artifacts, ceramics, and the
skeletal remains of an adult male. As we can see this form placed in comparison

228

Figure 6.26- ah252RP200/387 Altun Ha
with Lintel 25 (AD 725) from Yaxchilan, the lintel depicts blood ritual and
hallucinatory visions of a conjured ancestor through a vision serpent. In the
present image, the vision serpent is appearing to a woman from the site of
Yaxchilan. Lintel 25 shows an unnamed consort of Shield Jaguar (Figure 6.27).
The iconography present on lintel 25 has been interpreted as a vision serpent with
the figure emerging from the serpent's mouth as exhibiting Tlaloc imagery. The
image also exhibits jaguar imagery, elaborate decoration, and a dynamic depiction
of a giant serpent. The anthropomorphic figure is interpreted as an ancestor or the
lineage founder as he emerges from the gaping mouth of the giant serpent (see
Schele and Miller 1986: 100, 187- 190).

229

Figure 6.27 - Lintel 25 Yaxchilan (from Schele and Miller 1986)
In

the

case

of

specimen

ah252RP200/387,

the

head

of

the

anthropomorphic form, the ancestor, emerges from the gaping mouth of the vision
serpent (Figure 6.26). This example illustrates both the breadth and depth of
symbolic knowledge demonstrated by the individual that produced the artifact.
The artifact demonstrates a detailed knowledge of cosmology and ritual as the
catalyst for calling forth both the serpent and the specific ancestor from the
Otherworld (see Schele and Freidel 1990; Schele and Mathews 1999). Knowledge
of cosmic structure is clearly demonstrated.
Moreover, the knowledge of history is also implied. As recent
decipherments have shown us, Maya hieroglyphs recorded the history of the
230

ruling dynasty. It is posited here that the appearance of the vision serpent with the
individual emerging from the mouth is the appearance of a historical personage,
perhaps a dynasty founder (Schele and Freidel 1990). In order to depict such a
scene in flaked stone, knowledge of that ancestry is implied. Thus, the appearance
of the vision serpent and the ancestor in the medium of flaked stone illustrates
that crafters indeed possessed a complex view of the universe and history. This
view was subject to interpretation and elaboration. Because of the location and
the wealth of material culture recovered from Tomb A-1/1 at Altun Ha, it is
posited that this is specimen is an homage through depiction, part and parcel of
tribute to the elite individual entombed within. The vision serpent indexes the
ruler's linkage to the ancestors, and subsequent supernatural appearances that
occurred after the death and interment of the individual.
Staff Ends and Axes
Depictions of stone knives and stave ends occur frequently in Classic
Period iconography. It is apparent that flaked stone implements were frequently
used as weaponry. This weaponry may was used in combat to take captives, but
weapons were also important in public and ritual displays. A number of staff ends
and axes in the assemblage under study exhibit polish indicating extensive
handling of the artifacts by their owners. In an unpublished paper, McKinney
(1985) documents the appearance of functional flaked stone implements in
ancient Maya art. Depictions of flaked stone implements are found in all
surviving artistic media including painted ceramics, carved stone monuments,
painted murals, codices, and objects of jade. McKinney's study classifies chert
artifacts as weapons, ceremonial

231

Figure 6.28- Lintel 24 Yaxchilan (from Schele and Miller 1986)
implements, or badges of rank and office (McKinney 1985: 3). In terms of staff
ends and axes, the classification as a weapon is a useful device. Follet's (1932)
classification of Maya weapons illustrates more clearly the division between
actual weapons of war and more ceremonial implements used to express political
authority or rank. It is posited that these functions often overlapped (Figure 6.28).
With respect to the current study, there are numerous questions as to the
actual use of artifacts in warfare, or primarily as ritual paraphernalia. Both Follet
(1932) and McKinney's (1985) classifications include: spears with and without
serration, spears with a serrated shaft, stone tipped wands and scepters, darts,
clubs and maces, axes and hatchets, knives, and finally what are termed foliated
eccentrics. In the present assemblages, we can also include bident and trident
forms under the heading of foliated eccentrics. It is important to note that

232

Figure 6.29- Staff ends shown in Maya art (from Freidel et al. 1993)
common functional attributes that each of these classes of weapons shared was
that in all cases the specimens were hafted.
In terms of the three assemblages under study here, there is scant evidence
of hafting on the vast majority of materials that could be classified as weapons.
This could be because evidence of hafting was not detected at low power
magnification (10X) implemented in the analysis. However, there is also the
likelihood that such artifacts possessed a symbolic value that did not include
hafting of the artifact on a staff or use as weapons.
Perhaps the greatest value of the McKinney (1985) study is the
comprehensive chronology of lithic artifacts visible in Maya artistic media dating
to the Late Preclassic Period. For example, knife blades are clearly visible on
Stela 1 at El Baul (Proskouriakoff 1950). In the same volume, Proskouriakoff
(1950) also identifies a short wavy blade on Stela 9 and Stela 13 at Tikal. Both of
these carved stone monuments date to the Early Classic Period (AD 250- AD
600).
Maya art dating to the Late Classic (AD 600- AD 900) exhibits many
representations of stone tipped spears. Some of these artifacts include laurel leaf
blades, as well as the more narrow forms seen in the Altun Ha assemblage (see
also Pendergast 1982, 1990). Follet (1932: 382) observed that the primary
233

indication that a spear was intended for actual combat was the presence of sawlike projections fastened by lashing which ends about 12 inches below the
spearhead in an ornament from which a bundle of feather was suspended (Figure
6.29). These are depicted at Yaxchilan on Lintels 8 and 41, Stela 18, Stela 19, and
at Aguateca on Stela 6, as well as at Piedras Negras and Chichen Itza (McKinney
1984: 8). This is supported by the depictions on the murals at Bonampak. We
have yet to recover an intact spear point and staff. In the present assemblages,
there is evidence of hafting in the form of use polish. However, the presence of
residues or pigment is not primarily associated with the location of hafting
elements, even on the staff ends. Residues instead appear as material used to
attach appliques or perhaps mount the artifact.
There are several axe forms in the assemblages from Altun Ha and Colha
(ah4RP382/4 and cr47CH3060/)(Figure 6.30; see also Appendix). These are not
simply axe blades, however. They instead are monolithic axes, only one of which
exhibits polish that indicates extensive handling. A monolithic axe from Altun Ha
is the clearest example of a specimen that may have had functional use as a
weapon and was displayed as an accouterment of power. Specimen ah4RP382/4
from the Altun Ha assemblage is a monolithic axe that was handled extensively.
Specimen cr47CH3060/ from Colha also appears to depict a monolithic axe,
though no evidence of handling is visible on the surfaces of the specimen (see
Appendix).
In this study I am not simply trying to document the presence of functional
implements in Maya art. Instead, I am attempting to recognize forms in the art
that have parallels in the medium of flaked stone, and thus interpret symbolic
meaning. More closely related to this line of questioning is MicKinney's (1985)
observation

234

Figure 6.30 ah4RP382/4 monolithic axe from Altun Ha
that axe blades appear in what has been termed the manikin scepter, a label that is
no longer used in the literature. However, a depiction of this staff of office
appears at Yaxchilan Stela 11 and Yaxchilan Lintel 42. These carved stone
monuments show axe blades embedded in the foreheads of the manikin
(McKinney 1984: 23; Spinden 1975: pl. 61). The manikin with a blade protruding
from the forehead has recently been interpreted as a depiction of God K (Freidel
et al. 1993
McKinney (1985) also documents the use of what he terms eccentric axe
blades (Figure 6.31). These objects are used in ritual decapitation and sacrifice.
Death and rebirth is an integral part of the victory of the Hero Twins over the
Lords of Death. Part of their victory was sacrificing themselves and then being reborn in the defeat of Death. Depictions of this kind of sacrifice are related to a

235

Figure 6.31- Hafted chert ax (lightning flint) (from Freidel et al. 1993)
Late Classic vase that exhibits what has been termed the Water Lily Jaguar (Coe
1982: 6; Robicsek 1978: 125, fig. 144). Axes also take the form of trefoil lily
shaped blades. This has implications for the trefoils present in the assemblages in
the present study. These may have indeed been hafted, though there is little
visible evidence visible on individual specimens.
Indeed, the serpent staffs and stemmed disks present in the assemblages
here may have served as weapons. McKinney (1985) discusses in detail the
important of the Maya war club. McKinney also mentions a serpent handled
scepter and rounded clubs. However, the majority of these depictions appear to
have blades attached to them. This is in contrast to the stemmed disks and serpent
staffs included in the present study. These specimens have little evidence of
hafting and no surfaces to which blades could have been attached.
Perhaps most relevant to this discussion are the foliated eccentrics such as
one to four blades positioned on the periphery of a ring. These have been termed
as claw- knives by Follet (1932), yet none of the claw knives or jaguar claws
appear in the assemblages under study. More common to the present assemblages
are two and three- prong crescents, as well as bident and trident morphological
236

groupings. These forms are also present at Maya sites in Belize and Guatemala
such as Nohmul, San Jose, Piedras Negras, and Uaxactun (Coe 1959: 18;
Thompson 1939; Ricketson and Ricketson 1937).
Depictions of what McKinney (1985) terms foliated eccentrics are
concentrated at site in the Peten and western Belize, perhaps as part of the
technological tradition originating in northern Belize. These depictions have also
been observed at Chichen Itza (Maudslay 1902, pl. 45A3). Two prong and three
prong knives are depicted at Caracol, Tikal, and Uaxactun. Activities that are
depicted in Maya art that involve lithic artifacts include warfare, ritual sacrifice
and bloodletting, public and private ritual, and more rarely mundane activities of
everyday life. This relates to Maya symbolism in the sense that these forms are
depicted as representations (see Figures 6.29 and 6.31).
It is clear that flaked stone technology was integral to the completion of
tasks such as ground working, food processing and preparation, wood and bone
working, carving stone, and other kinds of production. Flaked stone implements
such as large laurel leaf bifaces also served as functional implements in more
ideologically based activities. Moreover, as this study shows, flaked stone was
also critical in the transmission of purely symbolic knowledge. It is likely that the
aforementioned functional implements also possessed symbolic value. It is also
clear that raw material such as chert possessed symbolic value in and of itself, as
debitage has been recovered in stela caches and above tombs at centers across the
lowlands (Coe 1959; Morley 1938; Ricketson and Ricketson 1937).
Notched Blades
We know from popular and scholarly works, the origin of obsidian and
chert was thought by the Maya to be in the sky (Heart of Sky)(see Tedlock 1985).
These materials then took an earthly manifestation when the force of the sky,

237

lightning, struck the earth (Freidel et al. 1993: 200). Notched blades occur most
frequently at Colha, but also are present in the assemblage from Altun Ha. It is
suggested here that notched blades are depictions of the lightning that formed the
chert. Along this line of reasoning, notched blades are effigy lighting bolts that
linked the creative power of the chert crafters with the power of lightning in the
sky (see Appendix).
The notched blade assemblage from a Late Classic cache located in
Operation 2012 at Colha yielded both the largest number and most impressive
array of notched blades of any context in the present study. It seems fitting that
the presence of effigy lightning bolts appears to be most clear at Colha. While the
assemblage of symbolic forms may in general be less elaborate there, ideological
power of chert and its formation was likely an important part of how residents
viewed their world. Certainly the archaeological evidence of intensive and longterm production of utilitarian and symbolic forms produced on chert support this
argument. Chert was integral to how the inhabitants saw the world. Part of
defining this world was defining the origin and importance of the material so
many in the community utilized on a daily basis.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUDING REMARKS
It is clear that the naturalized and abstracted forms appearing in the
assemblages of flaked stone symbols can be linked to important concepts in Maya
cosmology and history. The naturalized forms of humans likely represent
historical figures. Following an extremely simplified, yet parallel line of
reasoning similar to the primary assumption followed by Proskouriakoff (1960), it
is suggested here that anthropomorphic depictions represented individuals who
were actually captured, played the ball game, or were wives or consorts, or

238

children, as actual historical personages (Proskouriakoff 1960). These individuals
were in some way linked to the interred as well as the crafter of the artifact.
Moreover, zoomorphic forms are also naturalized and may represent either
actual animals or perhaps the wayob of the possessors. The concept of the wayob
is critical to understanding the differing ways the ancient Maya perceived the
natural world. Part of understanding the various kinds of transformative power
that were tangible and present in the Maya world, we must consider the power of
transformation and its link to the wayob. As seen in Chapter Five, there is a range
of naturalized animal forms observed in the three assemblages under study in this
dissertation from felines and canines to marine forms, crocodiles, and serpents.
It seems clear that, combined with our knowledge regarding the
importance of celestial phenomenon to the ancient Maya, and the ability of the
Maya to observe, predict, and explain such phenomena, that depictions in the
medium of flaked stone becomes plausible. It appears that in several examples of
crescents, solar eclipses are depicted. At least two examples of crescents from
Lamanai appear to depict planetary convergence.
More abstracted forms may have served as objects that were part of elite
household repertoires. These abstracted forms index a cultural aesthetic, but their
meanings are so detached from the forms that it is difficult to interpret any
specific meaning they may have had to either the crafters who produced the
objects or the elite who eventually acquired and possessed them. Stars, rings,
tetrafoils, and trefoil forms, as well as less frequently occurring elongated forms
clearly refer to structural concepts in ancient Maya culture. While we may never
be able to obtain a clear definition of what these forms may have meant to their
producers or their possessors, it is clear is that the forms themselves were part of
an overall regime of shapes and forms familiar to the Maya. These forms index
meaning that we cannot, at this point, access.
239

Perhaps more accessible via the medium of flaked stone, in terms of
abstracted ideas, is the notion of transformation. More specific aspects of the
power of transformation appear to be increasingly relevant in the interpretation of
flaked stone symbols. Linguistically, this transformation is linked to the Maya
word k'awil. K'awil has been deciphered as a general term for stone idols, as well
as the name for the powerful God K in the Maya pantheon (Figure 6.22). K'awil
as God K is a term that describes both sustenance and transformation. Indeed, in
the present day, k'awil is the K'iche' term for a depiction of a wood or stone statue
of a saint and the spirit of that saint (Tedlock 1985, 1986). In both highland
K'iche' and lowland Kekchi vocabularies, k'awil is a general term used to refer to
idols made of stone or wood. In the latter case, k'awil is followed by the term
pech, the word for dog indicating a pejorative in the modern translation. In a more
earthly interpretation, the power of k'awil also represents the contractual
obligations bonding people and the gods, in the larger process of humans
nurturing the gods, and the gods providing for humans (Freidel et al. 1993;
Godelier 1999; Mauss 1966).
K'awil can also be associated with vision serpents and scepters of
authority. As Freidel et al. (1993: 197) state, Classic Period monuments and
ceramics depict small images being wielded by lords or shamans. The objects
were in many cases flaked stone symbols. Indeed, k'awil appears as eccentric
lithic forms, such as those recovered at Copan and Tikal. On these forms, k'awil is
present in the material. Thus, k'awil is again defined as a small idol or statue
comprised of stone that was the embodiment of a spirit or ancestor (Freidel et al.
1993: 199).
The power of k'awil, like the execution of form by the chert crafters is
subtle. Dennis Tedlock (1985) asserts that stone k'awil are called Cacula
Huracan, Chipa Cacula, and Raxa Cacula in K'iche'. These deities were created
240

with the earthly incarnation of lightning after it struck the earth. According to
Tedlock the ability to divine and reveal the intentions of the ancestors rests on a
shaman's capacity to feel lightning in the muscles and blood of the body (Freidel
et al. 1993; Tedlock 1985, 1986, 1992).
Finally, it is clear from McKinney's (1985) analysis that chert objects also
served as staff ends and to some degree, weaponry. Staff ends present in the
assemblages under study here reflect similar functions. These objects were used
for display and use during warfare and after, perhaps in public ceremony and
ritual. Their elaborate use in public ritual displays are evidenced by the
widespread depiction of chert staff ends, spears, and axes present in other ancient
Maya artistic media.
Thus, symbolically the assemblage can be divided into five groups. These
are: 1. Naturalized forms that depict historical personages, 2. Forms that served as
incarnations of supernatural creatures, such as wayob or k'awil as small idols or
statues, 3. Forms that personifications of earthly and (or) celestial events such as
eclipses and planetary convergence, 4. Forms that are more abstracted indices of a
cultural aesthetic, 5. Forms that served as either ritual or actual functioning
weaponry. Simply put, it would be difficult to over- emphasize the symbolic
value of artifacts comprised of flaked stone, as representation, as objects that
reflect structural principles, and as objects whose meaning changed in specific
historical moments.
This chapter began with a discussion of the approaches to symbols in
archaeology and then led to an interpretation of the assemblages ancient Maya
flaked stone symbols. To close, if archaeology is the study of past culture and
society, we must directly confront the symbolic meanings of differing classes of
material culture. While symbolic interpretation may be less certain than studies of

241

the facts of technology or subsistence, it must be remembered that without
ideology and subsequent cultural value, facts become meaningless abstractions.

Chapter 7: Technological and Materials
Characterization Analysis
Lithic production has been the focus of archaeological research in
northern Belize for over two decades. The rich chert bearing soils of the region
were intensively exploited by ancient Maya communities as well as by their
predecessors. The research program at Colha has perpetuated continuing studies
of the production of utilitarian lithic implements dating from what has been
termed the pre- Maya occupation (before 1500 BC) through the Postclassic (AD
1000- AD 1300) (Gibson 1989; Hester and Shafer 1994; Hester et al. 1996;
Iceland 1997; King 2000; King and Potter 1994; Michael 1989; Potter 1993;
Roemer 1984; Shafer and Hester 1983, 1991).
The vast quantities of production debris that have accumulated through
time at Colha have provided ample evidence for the identification of the lithic
reduction continuum. This continuum was the vehicle by which intensive
production of stone tools on a community wide level was undertaken (see Shafer
1979, 1985, 1994; see also Collins 1975; Fowler 1991). The continuum represents
an idealized series of production stages individual pieces of stone passed through
prior to the shaping of the end product. Finished implements were then often
utilized in local domestic settings or were introduced into horizontal
socioeconomies of exchange (Gibson 1986; Hester and Shafer 1994; King and
Potter 1994; McAnany 1986, 1989, 1990).
The lithic reduction continuum has been constructed for tranchet bit tools
and oval bifaces for the Late Preclassic Period at Colha. The continuum illustrates
consistency of both quarried raw material and production techniques (Shafer
1979, 1985). The presence of internal consistency can then be expanded to
address the relative degree of craft specialization in lithic production that was

243

present (Shafer 1982, 1994). The reduction continuum is based on linear
reduction models that link reduction debris with the end results of the reduction
process (see Callahan 1979; Collins 1975; Shafer 1979). The linear reduction
model is not purely idealized in that it is based on observations of modern day
flint- knappers and on experimental studies regarding hammer technology and
breakage properties of the chert (Callahan 1979; Collins 1975; Shafer 1979: 29).
In two articles authored by Harry Shafer (1979, 1985) three primary
trajectories in the production of utilitarian implements are identified at Operation
2006, a Late Preclassic workshop deposit at Colha. These include oval bifaces,
tranchet bit tools, and macroblades. The reduction trajectories have implications
for the flaked stone symbols that comprise the Colha assemblage. Moreover, the
evidence of the intensive production of chert implements visible at Colha also has
technological implications for the assemblages of flaked stone symbols recovered
at Altun Ha and Lamanai.
The reduction and thinning of macroblades and macroflake- blades into
bifaces by Maya chert crafters was accomplished utilizing hammer technology
that included both hard and soft hammers and chert edge abrading tools (Shafer
1985). Other tools that were likely used were antler punches and billets, as well as
wooden and stone anvils (Shafer 1979: 30). The most frequently occurring
hammer stone in the Late Preclassic workshop deposits at Colha are bi- convex
chert limestone hammers, the platforms of which are tapered due to frequent
abrading (Shafer and Oglesby 1981: 203)
Initially, large nodules were procured from local quarries. Large limestone
and chert quarries are visible at Colha and Altun Ha, and likely dot the northern
Belize landscape. The larger nodules or tabular cores may have been reduced at

244

Figure 7.1- Early stage biface from Colha, Belize
localities near the original quarry sites. The raw materials were brought to
reduction localities as macroblades, macroflakes, or large nodules (Crabtree 1972:
42). The production of blanks necessitated a number of strategies used by flintknappers today, including the preparation of striking platforms, biface thinning,
and final shaping and forming (Figure 7.1).
Perhaps the utilitarian implement that most closely resembles the large
flaked stone symbols under study in the present analysis is what has been termed
the large oval biface (see Hester 1982, 1985). The oval biface reduction trajectory

245

as illustrated in the workshop debris at Colha Operation 2006 is comprised of
thinning debris and production failures (Shafer 1979). Reduction of flake blanks
was marked by a large number of production failures despite the skill of the
crafter and the high quality of raw material (Figure 7.2).
The lithic forms used in production were for the most part large flakes that
were bifacially reduced with direct hard hammer percussion, oftentimes
exhibiting symmetrical and parallel flake scarring (Shafer 1979: 58). Thinning
was accomplished by the repeated preparation of beveled striking platforms along
the lateral margins. Breakage patterns on oval bifaces most frequently resulted
from end shock, perverse fractures, poor platforms, and flaws or inclusions in the
raw material. End shock is a breakage caused by impact vibrations that create a
zone of tensions surpassing the strength of the material (Crabtree 1972: 60).
Essentially, the impact causes the biface to bend and snap. Perverse fractures are
defined as spiral or twisting breaks initiated at the edge of a biface. Inclusions and
excessive force oftentimes cause perverse fractures (Crabtree 1972: 82). The vast
majority of forms were finished successfully. These forms were repeatedly used
and re- worked. Finished large oval biface forms recovered from Colha exhibited
mean dimensions of: length- 24.5 cm, width- 7.6 cm, thickness- 2.7 cm (Shafer
1985).
A total of 508 specimens were included in the technological study.
However, it must be noted that blade forms were omitted from portions of the
study. Unlike utilitarian implements from Colha, the vast majority of which were
recovered in workshop deposits, there is scant evidence at any site in northern
Belize in terms of the production of flaked stone symbols. The assemblages under
study here were recovered from cache, burial, and tomb contexts as finished and
completed forms. However, the finished forms exhibit a wealth of technological

247

data with respect to production. This chapter will address the continuum that
resulted in the production of flaked stone symbols made from northern Belize
chert in an attempt discern inter- assemblage patterning. Moreover, material
characterization analysis of pigments and textiles recovered from the surfaces of a
sample of fourteen artifacts from both Altun Ha and Lamanai will be summarized
and interpreted within the context of the larger assemblages.
TECHNOLOGICAL ANALYSIS: COMPARISON OF THREE ASSEMBLAGES
Because we cannot at present identify workshop deposits directly linked to
the production of flaked stone symbols, a technological study must focus on the
finished forms. Critical to the production of forms was the use of raw material. As
was clearly the case, the chert used in the production of these forms originated
from northern Belize. The raw material comprising the assemblages exhibits
overall uniformity in texture. Yet only two of the three assemblages exhibit
significant variation of raw material appearance and texture within assemblages.
Moreover, although the three assemblages exhibit overall uniformity in frequency
of technological types, there is also considerable variation within and between
assemblages.
The following analysis will address raw material, technological type,
mean artifact dimensions, flake scar lengths, and flake scar terminations to
compare and contrast the assemblages. In doing so, it is posited here that we will
be able to infer site level production locality as well as observe changes in the
technology utilized by the chert crafters at each site.
Hypothesis One
There are significant differences in raw material color and texture between
the assemblages from each site suggesting differences in quarry sites.

248

Implication One
A contrast in raw material color and texture supports the argument that
raw materials (chert) originated from different quarry localities within northern
Belize, perhaps quarries associated with each site.
Hypothesis Two
There are significant differences in the frequency of occurrence of
technological types at each site suggesting variation in lithic reduction strategies.
Implication Two
Contrasts in the occurrence of technological types support an argument
that production sequences of flaked stone symbols varied from site to site.
Hypothesis Three
There are significant differences in mean artifact dimensions of the
assemblages from each site.
Implication Three
Contrast in mean artifact dimensions supports the argument that there are
differences in the assemblages as a whole. Variation in mean artifact dimension
may be linked to changing patterns in lithic production through time and across
space. These changes may be linked to how and where materials were quarried.

Hypothesis Four
There are significant differences in mean flake scar lengths between the
assemblages.

249

Implication Four
Differences in flake scar lengths on artifacts from each assemblage
supports the argument each assemblage exhibits a particular reduction continuum.

Hypothesis Five
There are significant differences in the relative frequency of flake scar
terminations on artifacts from each assemblage.
Implication Five
Differences in the frequency of flake scar terminations on artifacts from
each assemblage support the argument that there are differences in both the
production continuum and raw material assemblages from each site.
METHODS: FREQUENCY OF ATTRIBUTE OCCURRENCE
All artifacts in the three assemblages were measured and analyzed for the
attributes articulated above. Raw material appearance was recorded as follows:
banded, mottled, or uniform. Color was recorded using terms derived from the
Munsell Color Chart. However, the numerical notation contained in Munsell
Color Chart descriptions was omitted. Raw material texture was described using a
graded series of terms. These included very fine, fine, moderately coarse, and
coarse classifications. Flake scar lengths were recorded to the nearest millimeter
for the five lengthiest scars visible on the surfaces of the specimen. Flake scar
terminations for each flake scar measured were recorded in the following terms:
feather terminated, step terminated, and hinge terminated. It is also noted that five
edge angle measurements were also recorded for each specimen at standard
intervals around the margin of the specimen.

250

Raw Material Appearance (n= 508)
The color scheme for artifacts in each assemblage is diverse. Indeed,
individual artifact descriptions present the colors visible on the surfaces of each
specimen (see Appendix). However, how colors are depicted on each specimen is
not as complex. Raw material appearance is described as one of three terms:
banded, uniform, and mottled. Banded material has always marked the highly
uniform chert from northern Belize. Banded material has been documented
previously on lithic artifacts from both Colha and Altun Ha. Mottled material also
occurs frequently in assemblages of lithic artifacts from northern Belize. Color
schemes range from gray and brown to dark brown and blue gray. Chert that is
uniform in appearance has been most frequently documented at Colha. Tan brown
or honey brown chert marks the assemblage from Colha and marks the quality
raw material originating from the chert- bearing zone of northern Belize.
The assemblages are broken down by raw material appearance to get an
initial idea of the differences in raw material between the assemblages. Individual
specimens exhibiting raw material that is banded in appearance comprised 29.6%
of the assemblages. A total of 31.5% of the Altun Ha assemblage is comprised of
artifacts that appear banded. 25.6% of the Lamanai assemblage is comprised of
artifacts that appear banded. 20.6% of the Colha assemblage is comprised of
artifacts that appear banded.
Specimens exhibiting chert that is mottled in appearance comprise 45.0%
of the total. Artifacts mottled in appearance comprise 49.2% of the total from
Altun Ha. A total of 34.8% of the assemblage from Lamanai are mottled in
appearance. The Colha assemblage exhibited 29.4% of specimens that were
mottled in appearance (Figure 7.3).

Colha. A total of 39.6% of the assemblage from Lamanai are mottled in
appearance. The Altun Ha assemblage exhibited 19.3% of specimens that were
mottled in appearance.
Raw Material Texture (n= 508)
Raw material texture was also recorded through a series of grades that
include the following classifications: very fine, fine, moderately fine with coarse
textured inclusions, and coarse. These gradations are based on visual appearance
under 10X magnification. Differences between assemblages in terms of raw
material texture are presented as percentages. It is posited that differences in
texture can be an indicator of differences in the raw material source. One problem
with this classification is the heterogeneity of chert texture from the same source.
However, it was thought that such differences may still reflect general patterns.

The most frequently occurring texture type was fine textured chert. 55.8%
of the three assemblages are comprised of what was termed fine textured chert.
24.1% are comprised of very fine textured chert. 15.0% of the assemblages were
comprised of moderately fine textured chert with coarse textured inclusions. A
total of 5.1% of the assemblages are comprised of coarse textured material.
At Altun Ha, 54.7% of the artifacts were comprised of fine textured chert.
A total of 25.8% of the total was comprised of very fine textured chert. A total of
15.0% of the total was comprised of moderately fine textured chert with coarse

chert (Figure 7.4).
At Colha, 58.8% of the total was comprised of fine textured chert. A total
of 26.5% of the total assemblage was comprised of very fine textured chert. A

253

total of 11.8% was comprised of moderately fine textured chert with coarse
textured inclusions. A total of 2.9% of the assemblage was comprised of coarse
textured chert.
At Lamanai, 59.3% of the artifacts were comprised of fine textured chert.
A total of 16.3% of the total assemblage was comprised of very fine textured
chert. A total of 16.3% of the total was comprised of moderately fine textured
chert with coarse textured inclusions. A total of 8.1% of the total was comprised
of coarse textured chert.
Technological Type (n= 519)
As presented in the individual artifact descriptions, the frequencies of
technological types in each assemblage are as follows. A total of 87.3% of all
artifacts analyzed in the assemblages were bifaces. A total of 10.4% of all
artifacts in the assemblages were blades. A total of 2.3% of all artifacts in the
assemblage were flakes.
A total of 96.8% of the total artifacts from Altun Ha are bifaces (Figure
7.5). A total of 3.2% of the artifacts are blades. A total of 55.8% of the artifacts
from Colha are blades. A total of 44.2% of artifacts from Colha are bifaces.
87.8% of the total artifacts from Lamanai are bifaces. A total of 12.2% of the
artifacts from Lamanai are flakes. There were no blades present in the assemblage
from Lamanai. There were no flakes present in the assemblages from Altun Ha or
Colha. The substantial differences in the occurrence of technological types from
Colha and Altun Ha and Lamanai suggest that the Colha materials were likely the
result of a different production trajectory, perhaps indicating a different
production location with respect to the assemblages from the two larger sites.

Mean Artifact Dimensions (n= 508)
Maximum dimensions were measured for all specimens in each of the
three assemblages. There are significant differences between the assemblage,
most obviously are the mean dimensions of the Colha assemblages and the Altun
Ha and Lamanai assemblages. However, each mean also exhibited a fairly high
standard deviation. The standard deviation shows the range of values around the
mean. Despite the large standard deviations, it is posited that comparison of mean
artifact dimensions of the assemblages from each of the three sites can illustrate
initial differences in the assemblages (Figure 7.6).
The mean artifact dimensions for the Lamanai assemblage are: mean
length- 29.2 cm with a standard deviation- 9.3, mean width- 14.2 cm with a
standard deviation- 6.1, mean thickness- 3.3 cm with a standard deviation- 1.3.
The mean artifact dimensions for Altun Ha assemblage are: mean length28.2 cm with a standard deviation- 8.2, mean width- 13.1 cm with a standard

contrast the assemblage actually quite well. The differences between the mean
dimensions of each assemblages, again seem to suggest a different production
trajectory with respect to Colha and the other sites.
Flake Scar Lengths (n= 453)
Because we have no evidence of production in the form of lithic debitage
linked directly to the production of flake stone symbols, the technological
analysis must focus on the end result. However, the individual artifacts exhibit a
wealth of technological information. In this sense, this portion of the analysis

focused on flake scars that appear on the surfaces of individual artifacts (Table
7.1). During examination of each specimen, the five lengthiest flake scars visible
on each artifact were measured. Flake scar lengths were then placed in
descending order with one being the most lengthy and five being the shortest
flake scar measured. As is observable in the table above (Table 7.1), mean flake
scar lengths follow to some degree the same pattern as mean artifact lengths. The
Lamanai assemblage clearly possesses the lengthiest flake scars in each of the
five categories. The Altun Ha assemblage exhibits the second lengthiest mean
flake scar lengths, and the Colha assemblage follows in each category except
category E, the shortest mean length. In this example, the Lamanai and Atun Ha
assemblages exhibit similar mean lengths, suggesting that secondary and tertiary
thinning the overall size of the individual artifacts is not a dependent variable
with respect to overall length of specimens.
Flake Scar Terminations (n= 453)
Flake scar terminations were recorded for each measured flake scar. The
terminations were divided into three categories as observed at the termination of
the flake scars. The categories are as follows: feather terminated- terminate
gradually with no angle at the end of the scar, hinge terminated- terminate in a
curve or hinge where the wave of force turns back toward the source of the force,

right angle. It is posited that flake scar terminations perhaps can be linked to both
raw material quality and size of the artifact (Figure 7.7).
A total of 85.0% of all flake scars measured on artifacts in the Colha
assemblage were feather terminated flake scars. A total of 10.0% of all flake scars
measured in the Colha assemblage were hinge terminated. A total of 5.0% of all
flake scars measured in the Colha assemblage were step terminated.
A total of 72.8% of all flake scars measured on artifacts in the Lamanai
assemblage were feather terminated flake scars. A total of 19.7% of all flake scars
measured in the Lamanai assemblage were hinge terminated. A total of 7.5% of
all flake scars measured in the Lamanai assemblage were step terminated.
A total of 80.2% of all flake scars measured on artifacts in the Altun Ha
assemblage were feather terminated flake scars. A total of 16.2% of all flake scars
measured in the Altun Ha assemblage were hinge terminated. A total of 3.6% of
all flake scars measured in the Altun Ha assemblage were step terminated. The

Colha assemblage exhibits the greatest percentage of feather terminated flake
scars, suggesting that raw material uniformity and quality may be most consistent
in the specimens from this site.
MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION: A SUMMARY OF METHODS AND RESULTS
The systematic analysis of each artifact in the assemblages of flaked stone
symbols from Altun Ha, Colha, and Lamanai resulted in the identification of
pigment, residue, and textile fragments adhering to the surfaces of a significant
number of artifacts. It was clear from the identification of these materials that this
artifact class was undergoing technological elaboration beyond the production of
each specimen from macroblades and macroflake- blades. Specimens were often
painted, stained, and (or) wrapped in cloth. With the identification of cultural
materials present on the surfaces of the artifacts, it was clear that further
characterization of the materials was necessary.
With the permission of Alan Moore, Archaeological Commissioner of
Belize and Elizabeth Graham, Director of the Lamanai Archaeological Project, a
number of artifacts were sampled for materials characterization. Fourteen pigment
samples and two textile fragments were collected from a total of fifteen artifacts.
Six of the pigment samples were from artifacts from the Lamanai assemblage.
Eight of the pigment samples were from artifacts from the Altun Ha assemblage.
The two textile samples were obtained from artifacts from Altun Ha. The samples
were then transported to the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in May of
2000. At this point, materials analyst Harriet Beaubien of the Smithsonian Center
for Materials Research and Education was contacted with respect to coordinating
materials characterization efforts. Materials were then transported to the
laboratory at the Museum Support Center in Suiteland, Maryland in September,
2000. Research fellow Jill Plitnikas began the study in November, 2000.

The following is a summary of the research methods and results of the
characterization analysis conducted by Jill Plitnikas at the Smithsonian Center for
Materials Research and Education. The results appear in an unpublished
preliminary report completed in January 2001 (see Plitnikas 2001). Further
analysis of these materials is being undertaken and will be presented in a final
report and published paper.
Plitnikas (2001) implemented a variety of techniques to characterize the
pigment and textile samples. Three types of optical microscopy were employed,
including stereo microscopy and polarized light microscopy. Also scanning
electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectrometry, and a battery of
histochemical tests were implemented in the analysis of the samples. Future
research efforts will include x- ray diffraction, to more clearly quantify the
crystalline composition of the pigments and atomic mass spectrometry to
radiocarbon date a the textile fragments. The following summarizes results of the
preliminary characterization study.
Pigment Samples
The spectrum probes of the pigment samples revealed somewhat similar
spectra. Iron and oxygen were identified in all of the probes. This suggests that
the colorant is an iron- oxide compound (Plitnikas 2001: 12). The samples also
exhibited both quartz and clay mineral due to their source. The appearance of
other compounds is consistent with trace elements often detected in such material
via the electron- dispersive spectrometry.

The differences in compounds is

probably linked to differences in the types of mineral present rather than
differences in colorant (Plitnikas 2001). Iron earth pigments can be yellow, red, or
brown, depending on the particular oxides present (Plitnikas 2001: 12)

Sample A
This sample was recovered from specimen ah8RP137/55. The specimen
was recovered from a Late Classic cache at Altun Ha and is classified as an
anthropomorphic form. The pigment sample was removed from the medialproximal area of the dorsal surface (see Figure 5.2).
The most frequently occurring particle viewed with scanning electron
microscopy was round with an uneven surface. The energy dispersive
spectrometry probes produced peaks for carbon, oxygen, sodium, magnesium,
aluminum, silicon, phosphorus, sulfur, potassium, calcium and iron. (see Plitnikas
2001: 7).
Sample B
This sample was recovered from the same specimen as that described
above, ah8RP137/55, originating from the site of Altun Ha. The pigment sample
was recovered from the media- distal area of the dorsal surface (see Figure 5.2).
The most frequently occurring particle viewed with scanning electron
microscopy was round with a rough or uneven surface. The energy dispersive
spectrometry probes produced peaks for carbon, oxygen, sodium, magnesium,
aluminum, silicon, phosphorus, sulfur, chlorine, potassium, calcium, titanium,
vanadium, and iron (Plitnikas 2001: 7)
Sample C
This pigment sample was recovered from specimen ah42RP137/52. The
specimen was recovered from Altun Ha and is classified as a zoomorphic
(crocodilian) form. The pigment sample was recovered from one medial surface
of the specimen.

261

The most frequently occurring particles observed with scanning electron
microscopy are round with rough and round with smooth surfaces. The energy
dispersive spectrometry probes produced peaks for carbon, oxygen, sodium,
aluminum, silicon, phosphorus, sulfur, potassium, calcium, and iron (Plitnikas
2001: 7). A probe of several dark round particles indicated a very high peak for
carbon suggests that these particles exhibit a large organic component (Plitnikas
2001: 12).
Sample D
Sample D was recovered from specimen ah70RP137/51. The specimen
was recovered from Altun Ha and is classified as a tetrafoil form. The pigment
sample was recovered from one medial surface of the specimen.
The most frequently occurring particle observed with scanning electron
microscopy exhibit round shapes with rough surfaces. Energy dispersive
spectrometry probes on rough and smooth particles yielded peaks for carbon,
oxygen, sodium, aluminum, silicon, phosphorus, sulfur, potassium, calcium,
titanium, and iron (Plitnikas 2001: 7).
Sample F
Sample F was recovered from specimen ah120RP137/153. The specimen
was recovered from Altun Ha and is classified as a zoomorphic form (mammal).
The pigment sample was recovered from one medial surface of the specimen.
The most frequently occurring particle observed with scanning electron
microscopy was round with rough surfaces. Energy dispersive spectrometry
probes on rough and smooth particles yielded peaks for carbon, oxygen, sodium,
magnesium, aluminum, silicon, phosphorus, sulfur, potassium, calcium,
vanadium, iron (Plitnikas 2001: 8).

262

Sample H
Sample H was recovered from specimen ah90RP528/2. The specimen was
recovered from Altun Ha and is classified as a serpent form. The pigment sample
was recovered from the medial- proximal area of the dorsal surface.
The most frequently occurring particles observed with scanning electron
microscopy are homogeneous, with a small and round appearance. Energy
dispersive spectrometry probes yielded peaks for carbon, oxygen, magnesium,
aluminum, silicon, copper, sulfur, calcium, and iron (Plitnikas 2001: 8).
Sample I
This sample was recovered from specimen r47LA395/. The specimen was
recovered from Lamanai and is classified as a staff end. The pigment sample was
recovered from the medial- distal area of one surface.
The most frequently occurring particles observed with scanning electron
microscopy were homogeneous, with a small and round appearance. Energy
dispersive spectrometry probes yielded peaks for carbon, oxygen, magnesium,
aluminum, silicon, phosphorus, sulfur, potassium, calcium, and titanium
(Plitnikas 2001: 8).
Sample J
This sample was recovered from specimen r48LA395/. The specimen was
recovered from Lamanai and is classified as an anthropomorphic form. The
pigment sample was recovered from the medial area of one surface.
The most frequently occurring particles observed with scanning electron
microscopy were homogenous in size with small round appearance. Energy
dispersive spectrometry probes yielded peaks for carbon, oxygen, magnesium,

263

aluminum, silicon, phosphorus, sulfur, potassium, calcium, and iron (Plitnikas
2001: 8)
Sample K
This sample was recovered from specimen r52LA395/. The specimen was
recovered from Lamanai and is classified as a staff end. The pigment sample was
recovered from one medial surface.
The particles were few in number with rough and uneven surface and a
larger and smoother. Energy dispersive spectrometry probes yielded peaks for
carbon, oxygen, aluminum, silicon, phosphorus, sulfur, potassium, calcium, iron
(Plitnikas 2001: 8).
Sample L
This sample was recovered from specimen r56LA395/. The specimen was
recovered from Lamanai and is classified as a serpent form. The pigment sample
was recovered from the medial area of one surface.
The most frequently occurring particles were round with rough surfaces.
Energy dispersive spectrometry probes yielded peaks for carbon, oxygen,
magnesium, aluminum, silicon, phosphorus, sulfur, potassium, calcium, iron
(Plitnikas 2001: 9)
Sample M
This specimen was recovered from specimen r62LA240/. The specimen
was recovered from Lamanai and is classified as a ring form. The pigment sample
was recovered from the medial area of one surface.
The most frequently occurring particle observed with scanning electron
microscopy was round with a rough surface. Energy dispersive spectrometry
yielded peaks for carbon, oxygen, magnesium, aluminum, silicon, phosphorus,
264

sulfur, potassium, calcium, and iron. Also a number of flat particles were also
observed. Energy dispersive spectrometry yielded peaks for carbon, oxygen,
sulfur, calcium, and iron (Plitnikas 2001: 9). A probe of dark, flat particles
indicates high peaks for carbon, suggesting that these particles have a large
organic component (Plitnikas 2001: 12).
Sample N
Pigment sample N was recovered from specimen r63LA242/. The
specimen was recovered from Lamanai and is classified as a star form. The
pigment sample was recovered from the medial- ventral surface.
The most frequently occurring particle observed with scanning electron
microscopy was round and smooth sided. Energy dispersive spectrometry yielded
peaks for carbon, oxygen, aluminum, sulfur, silicon, calcium, and iron (Plitnikas
2001: 9).
Textile Samples
Sample E
This textile sample was recovered from specimen ah85RP/. The specimen
was recovered from Altun Ha and is classified as a serrated crescent form. The
textile sample was recovered from the medial- dorsal surface of the specimen (see
Appendix).
The textile sample measures 2.1 cm in length by 1.3 cm in width and is
irregularly shaped. The fibers have deteriorated substantially, but the weave is
intact (Plitnikas 2001: 9). The weave is comprised of tow interlaces elements that
run at right angles to one another. The elements are referred to as system 1 and
system 2. Both systems are z- twisted single yarns with 0.3 mm in diameter.
System 1 exhibits 33 yarns per cm and system 2 exhibits 17 yarns per cm. Thus,
265

Figure 7.8- Side one of textile Sample E (courtesy of the SCMRE)
the weave is unbalanced with an uneven order of interlacing and no apparent
weave repeat. An indication of what is termed a progressive float that is diagonal
in alignment (twill weave) is visible (Plitnikas 2001: 9). The fibers are
deteriorated and covered in spores and fungus. Pieces of the fiber are missing,
making visible the wide lumen and thin walls of the fiber.
The textile fragment exhibits colorant visible on the surface of the sample
(Figure 7.8). Energy dispersive spectrometry probes of green colored fiber
yielded peaks for carbon, oxygen, sodium, magnesium, aluminum, silicon,
phosphorus, sulfur, chlorine, potassium, calcium, iron, and copper. An additional
probe yielded peaks for carbon, oxygen, silicon, phosphorus, sulfur, calcium,
chromium, iron, and nickel. Probes of the pink colored fiber yielded peaks for
carbon, oxygen, sodium, magnesium, aluminum, silicon, phosphorus, sulfur,
chlorine, potassium, calcium, titanium, and iron.

266

Figure 7.9- Side one of textile sample G (courtesy of the SCMRE)
Sample G
This textile sample was recovered from specimen ah178RP264/. The
specimen was recovered from Altun Ha and is classified as a disk form. The
textile fragment was recovered from the medial- dorsal surface of the specimen.
The textile sample measures 2.1 cm in length with 1.1 cm in width and is
irregularly shaped. The fragment has deteriorated but part of the weave is intact.
The fragment exhibits green, pink, and white material adhering to it (Figure 7.9).
The weave structure consists of two interlacing elements that run at right angles
to each other (Plitnikas 2001: 10). Because neither of the elements can be defined
as a weft or weave, they are designated system 1 and system 2. Each system are
loose z- twisted yarns that are 0.30 mm in diameter. System 1 exhibits 19 yarns
per 0.55 cm and system 2 exhibits 17 yarns per centimeter. The weave is
unbalanced and is defined as an irregular weave (Plitnikas 2001: 11). The fibers
are cylindrical with wide lumen and thin walls. As well a number of cross section
267

views were undertaken that resulted in the characterization of the interior of the
fibers (see Plitnikas 2001: 11).
The sample exhibited colorants visible on the surface of the sample.
Energy dispersive spectrometry probes of green colored fiber yielded peaks for
carbon, oxygen, magnesium, aluminum, silicon, phosphorus, sulfur, chlorine,
calcium, titanium, and copper. Probes of the pink colorant yielded peaks for
carbon, oxygen, sodium, magnesium, aluminum, silicon, phosphorus, sulfur,
chlorine, potassium, calcium, and iron (Plitnikas 2001: 11).
Comparison of Textile Samples
Both textile samples E and G exhibit loose, z- twist, and single yarn and a
two system, unbalanced thread counts, and irregular weaves (Plitnikas 2001: 13).
The twill weave visible in sample E has been identified in Classic Period textile
fragments from Teotihuacan (King 1979). Twill weaves are also present in later
textiles from Chichen Itza, Monte Alban, and Teotihuacan (King 1979; Lothrop
1992 as cited in Plitnikas 2001). As Plitnikas (2001) asserts, further analysis of
the structural characteristics of the fibers in cross section suggest that the fibers
are not cotton (Gossypium spp.). Other possibilities are milkweed (Asclepias spp.)
and perhaps is more likely is kapok (Ceiba spp.) (see Plitnikas 2001: 14- 15).
The energy dispersive spectrometry probes of the green colorant present
on both textile samples yielded similar spectra, suggesting similar colorants were
used in both cases. Plitnikas asserts that for the Classic Period, copper based
pigment such as malachite (copper carbonate) or a green earth pigment that is
colored by iron were used. The production of Maya blue (clay mineral colored by
an organize substance) may also be a candidate (Beaubien 1991, 1993; Plitnikas
2001: 13).

268

The results of the energy dispersive spectrometry are somewhat
contradictory, as half of the probes did not reveal any metallic elements. Peaks of
copper appeared in five of the probes and peaks in the EDS graphs for iron
appears in two of the probes. Other elements such as carbon, oxygen, sodium,
aluminum, magnesium, silicon, phosphorus, sulfur, chlorine, potassium, calcium,
and titanium are very common elements in the earth. These elements may well be
related to the presence of textile fiber (Plitnikas 2001: 13). In addition, nickel and
chromium appear and is not related to green earth- type pigment. Chromium is an
element in modern green pigments and is viewed only as a trace occurrence
(Plitnikas 2001: 14). The energy dispersive spectrometry probes of the pink
colorant yielded peaks of similar elements. The detection of iron and oxygen
suggests an iron oxide compound is the colorant. Other elements are common
earth elements and some are no doubt related to the presence of textile fiber
(Plitnikas 2001: 14). A white material visible on sample G yielded peaks for
common earth minerals and is likely part of calcium carbonate material that
originated likely from cortical material present on the specimen.
Further Research
New investigations in the characterization of materials recovered from the
surfaces of a sample of fourteen flaked stone symbols from Altun Ha and
Lamanai, Belize will focus on x- ray diffraction analysis in an effort to identify
the iron oxide compounds present in the material. Mounting of the specimens and
initial procedure of radiation has been completed (Plitnikas 2001: 14). Plitnikas
hopes that diffraction patterns will provide further evidence for the presence of
specific crystalline compounds. It is also hoped that tests for human blood
proteins can also be undertaken on two of the pigment samples.

269

Also of importance is a more detailed identification of the species that
comprises the fiber of the textile samples. X- ray diffraction analysis will also be
carried out on the textile colorants in an effort to identify any crystalline
compounds. Both the green and pink colorant samples have been mounted. X- ray
diffraction analysis will also be undertaken on the white material in order to
identify crystalline compounds (see Plitnikas 2001: 15). Ultimately, it is hoped
that the textile fragments can be subjected to atomic mass spectrometry
radiocarbon analysis in an effort to obtain chronometric ages for the two samples.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUDING REMARKS
The earliest evidence of flaked stone symbols in northern Belize originates
from cache and burial contexts in the central precinct at Colha. At Colha, the
widespread production of non- utilitarian artifacts such as stemmed macroblades
occurred at Colha and gave way to the appearance of purely symbolic forms on a
much smaller scale during the Late Preclassic (400 BC- 250 AD). Larger
bifacially reduced symbolic forms were recovered in what has been termed
Protoclassic burials at Colha (AD 150- AD 250). Later caches recovered in the
central precinct date to the Late Classic and are comprised primarily of notched
blades but also yielded bifacial forms (Potter 1982; Probst 1984).
During the latter part of the Early Classic and into the Late Classic, large
assemblages of flake stone symbols produced on local cherts appear in tomb and
cache contexts at Altun Ha. This pattern correlates with what may have been a
decline and re- organization of the craft community at Colha. These contexts
extend from AD 550 to AD 875. Postclassic contexts are also present at Altun Ha.
These cache contexts date primarily to after AD 1100. These materials are clearly
local chert, but are different in terms of overall raw material than the Colha

270

assemblage. It appears that the flaked stone symbols appearing in the tombs and
caches at Altun Ha were locally produced.
The assemblages of flake stone symbols from Lamanai appear in Late and
Terminal Classic caches along the axis of large structures, in elite residential
compounds, and associated with Altar 1 in Plaza 2. The appearance of the
assemblage at Lamanai dovetails with the larger Altun Ha assemblage. There are
some fundamental similarities with respect to raw material, technology, and
morphology between the Lamanai and Altun Ha assemblages. Indeed, it is posited
that some of the forms in the Lamanai assemblage may have been produced
elsewhere. The late and smaller assemblage may have been the result of
acquisition from the elites at Altun Ha. The architectural and material culture
similarities between the two sites are clear (Pendergast 1992, 1998). Complex and
long standing political relationships were likely solidified by large- scale gift
exchanges, some of these exchanges may have included elaborate flaked stone
symbols.
What also must be articulated are the similarities and differences in the
production continuum indexed by the assemblages that have been the focus of
study. Clearly the Late Preclassic materials recovered at Colha exhibit a biface
reduction continuum that originated likely from macroblade and macroflakeblade blanks. This continuum is present and most elaborate at Altun Ha. The
Altun Ha assemblage is perhaps more definitive of the macroblade macroflakeblade trajectory due to different raw material. Larger and more elaborate
specimens necessitated more lengthy and wider blanks. The definition of a blade
as being twice as long as wide is re- contextualized with respect to the production
continuum. It seems more likely that blanks that were wider than the definition of
true blades were used in the production of a majority of the specimens.

271

Technologically, the assemblage from Lamanai is closely related to the
Altun Ha assemblage. The raw materials are similar and the large, elaborate
specimens exhibit similar breakage patterns. The emphasis in both assemblages is
clearly on bifacial reduction. Though it is difficult to assess production locality
based on the context of final interment and the technological information
embodied in the final product, it is suggested here that similar production
trajectories and perhaps craft communities are evident. In any scenario, the
technological and symbolic knowledges necessary for the elaboration of flaked
stone symbols was available to relatively few communities. Whether crafters from
Altun Ha were producing items from local cherts for acquisition by local elites
and transport to a major center such as Lamanai or whether communities of local
crafters were procuring macroblade of macroflake- blade blanks for production at
Lamanai remains in question.
Hypothesis One
There are significant differences in the raw material appearance and
texture in the assemblages from each of the three sites.
Implication One
Contrast in raw material appearance and texture supports the argument
that raw materials originated from different quarry localities across northern
Belize. The biface assemblages from each of the threes sites were classified as
one of three patterns of appearance: banded, mottled, and uniform. A total of 453
of the 519 total specimens included in the technological study were classified.
This comprised all of the bifaces from each of the three assemblages. One of the
marked characteristics of chert originating from northern Belize is gray and pale
gray and brown banding. Banding appears most frequently in the Altun Ha

272

assemblage, but a significant percentage of artifacts in the Lamanai and Colha
assemblages also appear banded.
Results
Artifacts that exhibit cherts that are mottled in appearance, with a mix of
several colors and perhaps patination was the most frequently occurring category
across assemblages. The Altun Ha assemblage exhibited the largest number of
specimens exhibiting a mottled appearance, totaling 31.5%. This is a significant
number of artifacts. However, the Lamanai and the Colha assemblages also
exhibit a significant number of artifacts that are mottled in appearance. Artifacts
that exhibit cherts that are uniform in appearance were the least frequently
occurring category across the assemblages. However, what it interesting is that
uniform chert is the most frequently occurring category appearing in the Colha
assemblage.
In terms of raw material texture, fine and very fine textured cherts are the
most frequently occurring categories across the assemblages. Of note is the much
lower percentage of very fine textured chert exhibited in the Lamanai assemblage.
As well, Lamanai also exhibits the highest percentage of cherts that are
moderately fine textured with coarse textured inclusions. Finally, the Lamanai
assemblage exhibits a much higher percentage of artifacts that are comprised of
coarse textured chert, totaling 8.1% of the total. In contrast to this total, the Colha
assemblage exhibits the lowest percentage of artifacts comprised of coarse
textured materials.
A comparison of raw material appearance and texture between
assemblages exhibits some notable contrasts. Both categories show that the Colha
assemblage exhibits a much higher frequency of materials that are uniform in
appearance as well as the assemblage that exhibits a much higher frequency of

273

very fine textured chert and the lowest frequency of artifacts that are comprised of
coarse textured chert. Colha is perhaps best known for its uniform tan brown (or
honey brown) cherts. These materials were intensively exploited by craft
specialists during the Late Preclassic and into the Classic Period of Maya
civilization. The contrast in terms of the frequency of uniform and very fine as
well as coarse textured cherts between Colha assemblages and the Lamanai and
Altun Ha assemblages implies intra- regional variation in raw material originating
from differing quarry localities.
Hypothesis Two
There are significant differences in the frequency of occurrence of
technological types in each assemblage.
Implication Two
Contrast in the frequency of technological types in the assemblages
supports an argument that production trajectories of flaked stone symbols was
different at each site.
Results
In the Altun Ha and Lamanai assemblages, by far the most frequently
occurring technological type is the biface. However, at Colha macroblades are
clearly the most frequently occurring technological type. This contrast indicates a
different production trajectory for flaked stone symbols at Colha as compared to
Altun Ha and Lamanai.

274

Hypothesis Three
There are significant differences in the mean artifact dimensions in the
assemblages from each site.
Implication Three
Significant differences in the mean artifact dimensions supports an
argument that the production trajectories for flake stone symbols was different at
each site. There are marked contrasts between mean artifact dimensions between
each assemblage.
Results
There is a clear contrast again between the Colha assemblage and the
assemblages from Lamanai and Altun Ha. However, the mean artifact dimensions
also exhibit a fairly high standard deviation. Thus, the deviations indicate that
there could be some overlap between dimensions of the outlying artifacts in each
assemblage.
The mean length, width, and thickness of the Colha assemblage are in
each case approximately half of the corresponding dimension of artifacts in the
Lamanai and Altun Ha assemblages. The Lamanai assemblage exhibits slightly
higher mean artifact dimensions than artifacts in the Altun Ha assemblage. The
contrast in mean artifact dimensions from the Colha assemblage again indicates
that there was a different production trajectory with respect to the artifacts from
Colha. Indeed, the assemblages from Lamanai and Altun Ha appear similar, in the
sense that larger bifaces appear to be the norm in the assemblages from these two
sites.

275

Hypothesis Four
There are significant differences in mean flake scar lengths between the
assemblages.
Implication Four
Differences in flake scar lengths on artifacts from each assemblage
indicate that there are different reduction trajectories for the assemblages from
each site. A total of the five lengthiest flake scars were measured on each
specimen in the three assemblages. These flake scar lengths provided data on the
final thinning and shaping of individual specimens. These data were then divided
into five categories with one being the longest flake scar and five being the
shortest flake scar. A mean flake scar length was generated for each category. The
mean flake scar lengths from each category follow the trend shown in the mean
artifact dimensions.
Results
The Lamanai assemblage, which exhibits the lengthiest mean flake scar.
The mean value for category one at Lamanai is 5.3 cm. When compared to 4.3 cm
and 3.3 cm for the category one values from Altun Ha and Colha, the differences
in flake scar lengths on specimens from each site are clear. Category five values
show that Lamanai and Altun Ha exhibit the same value in terms of mean flake
scar length that is 2.7 cm in length. The overall smaller specimens of flaked stone
symbols from Colha exhibits a category five value of 2.0 cm. These contrasts
again correlate closely with the contrasts demonstrated by the mean artifact
dimension values. These two tests show clearly that there are contrasts between
the assemblages

276

Hypothesis Five
There are significant differences in the relative frequency of flake scar
terminations visible on specimens from each assemblage.
Implication Five
It is posited that feather terminated flake scars were the desired
termination for chert crafters of flaked stone symbols. Feather terminations
demonstrate quality of raw material and control of the percussion instrument.
Significant differences in the appearance of particular terminations may indicate
differences between technology and raw material present in the assemblages.
Results
By far the most frequently occurring flake scar termination recorded on
specimens from each assemblage were feather terminated flake scars. What is
interesting is that the Colha assemblage demonstrates the largest relative number
of feather terminated flake scars, with a total of 85.0% of all flake scars measured
exhibiting feather terminations. The lowest frequency was exhibited by the
Lamanai assemblage, with 72.8% which is still a high percentage. In contrast, the
Colha assemblage exhibits the lowest percentage of hinge fractures. The Altun Ha
assemblage exhibited the lowest percentage of step terminated flake scars.
These results, in combination with raw material appearance and texture
indicates that what might be termed the highest relative quality of raw material
was available to the chert crafters at Colha. This high quality raw material was
undertaken by the generations of craft specialists that lived there to produce high
quality utilitarian implements. Differences in technology also seem apparent,
though flake scar terminations are not an independent test of the presence of lithic
technology. Further discussion of the contrasting raw material and technology

277

present in the assemblages from each site will be discussed further in the final
chapter of the dissertation, Chapter Eight.

278

Chapter 8: Conclusions
Like most things archaeological, this study has perhaps raised more
questions than it has answered. However, by positioning material culture as a
crystallization of technological knowledge, political economy, and symbolism, we
can begin to trace and interpret the complex processes of cultural production that
resulted in its appearance archaeologically. Maya flaked stone symbols recovered
from Altun Ha, Colha, and Lamanai, Belize index such processes. More
commonly referred as eccentric lithics or ceremonial flints, it has become clear
that the artifact class under study here can be linked to the symbolic elaboration
of a regional lithic technology that was temporally bounded.
Macroblade and macroflake- blade technology first observed at Colha and
utilized in the organization and emergence of lithic craft specialization on a
massive scale during the Late Preclassic Period was elaborated upon by crafters
across northern Belize. This elaboration was undertaken within the context of a
shifting and fluid political economic milieu and incorporated themes prevalent in
Maya art and iconography. The symbolism present in these artifacts both reflects
and constitutes an ideology with mytho- historical and political antecedents also
seen in other forms of ancient Maya artistic media. The result was the large- scale
production of explicitly symbolic forms at Altun Ha by the Late Classic Period
(AD 250- AD 900).
With regard to their elaboration as material symbols, the assemblages can
be divided into five groups. These are: 1. Naturalized forms that depict historical
personages, 2. Forms that served as incarnations of supernatural creatures, such as
wayob or k'awil as small idols or statues, 3. Forms that personifications of earthly
and (or) celestial events such as eclipses and planetary convergence, 4. Forms that

279

are more abstracted indices of a cultural aesthetic, 5. Forms that served as either
ritual or actual functioning weaponry.
DISCUSSION OF THE FIVE HYPOTHESES
In Chapter One, five interrelated hypotheses were introduced that
addressed questions surrounding the appearance of flaked stone symbols in
archaeological contexts at the three sites mentioned above. Briefly, I would like to
refer back to these, as well as discuss their implications and what the present
study has revealed. The hypotheses were based first on establishing technological
and historical precursors and then looking at how the forms themselves index
ideology possessed by the crafters of the forms. After which, I would like to
discuss the three- pronged approach undertaken in the present study with regard
to interpreting artifact meaning and implications for future research.
Hypothesis One
Flaked stone symbols occur at Colha by the end of the Late Preclassic
Period (sometime prior to AD 250). Their appearance in tomb and cache contexts
begins at Altun Ha by AD 550 and in more limited contexts, at Lamanai by AD
700. Moreover, flaked stone symbols occur less frequently at Colha through the
Classic Period, ceasing by the Terminal Classic (AD 800- 900). At Altun Ha,
flaked stone symbols no longer appear in tomb contexts after AD 850. At
Lamanai, the appearance of flaked stone symbols in primary contexts ceases by
AD 900.
It is hypothesized that differences in the forms in each assemblage will be
most prevalent between the materials from Colha and the later Altun Ha and
Lamanai assemblages. The Altun Ha and Lamanai assemblages will show
elaboration in terms of form. It is hypothesized that the Colha assemblage will

280

exhibit variation in technology as exhibited by bifaces and notched blades. Raw
material will exhibit considerable variation between sites, but represent a range of
materials from the northern Belize chert- bearing zone.
Implications of Hypothesis One
The majority of the assemblage from Colha will date to the Late
Preclassic, with some dating to the Late Classic Period. Tomb and cache contexts
at Altun Ha and Lamanai will exhibit artifacts that are associated with the Late
and Terminal Classic Periods (AD 600- AD 900). As the elite communities at
Altun Ha gained political economic power, acquisition of flaked stone symbols
became one material aspect of elite ritual displays. Eventually, a shift in the mode
of production at Colha during the Early Classic Period (AD 250- AD 600) and the
subsequent appearance of signature technologies appearing at Altun Ha and
Lamanai in the Late Classic indicate that production locus had shifted. By the
10th century AD, flaked stone symbols in standardized form are no longer
produced.
Results
As we now know, Late Preclassic and Protoclassic (400 BC- AD 250)
artifact forms associated with burials and caches at Colha Operation 2031, when
considered in association with earlier appearing stemmed macroblades at that site,
are clearly the earliest appearing symbolic lithic forms in northern Belize. The
Colha assemblage dating to this time period is comprised of bifacial forms that
were classified as staff ends (see Appendix). By the Late Classic, both bifacial
forms and notched blades are present at Colha. Bifacial forms include rings,
crescents, and several zoomorphic forms. The notched blade assemblage is larger
at Colha, and the technology clearly contrasts with that appearing at Altun Ha and

281

Lamanai. This sequence to some degree reflects evidence for the re- organization
of production at Colha.
The appearance of flaked stone symbols in tomb and cache contexts at
Altun Ha begins in the Early Classic Period (AD 250- AD 600) and ends by the
Early Postclassic (AD 1000). However, the vast majority of elaborate forms at
Altun Ha occur in contexts that date to the Late Classic (AD 550- AD 850). At
Lamanai, the appearance of forms in cache contexts dates to the Late and
Terminal Classic (AD 600- 950). It may be that some of the forms were produced
prior to that time period. It appears that production of explicitly symbolic forms in
northern Belize ceases by the Terminal Classic or Early Postclassic Period. There
is little evidence for their production after AD 950.
Hypothesis Two
It is hypothesized that variation in color, texture, and the presence of
inclusions in raw material comprising individual artifacts can be combined with
morphological and technological data to initiate a consideration of production
loci. It seems apparent that all raw materials originated from the chert bearing
zone of northern Belize. Moreover, it is hypothesized that overall differences in
the raw material comprising the assemblages will support the notion for multiple
intra- regional sources of chert, and in turn at least two broadly defined
production localities.
Implications of Hypothesis Two
Flaked stone symbols, like all forms of material culture, are bounded by
technology, raw material, time, and space. By examining the raw material that
comprises the three assemblages in the present study, we can begin to at least
narrow the sources of the raw material. This macro- level analysis cannot reveal

282

specific quarry sites or production loci. Instead the comparison provides further
indication for shifts in raw material usage and more indirectly, production locus.
NAA has revealed intra- regional patterning in terms of local chert composition
(Tobey 1986; Cackler et al. 1999). However, overall homogeneity of the chert has
made further refining of individual sources extremely difficult. It is posited that
raw material composition links assemblages to changing quarrying and
production loci within the complex political economic history of northern Belize.
Results
The results of the technological study presented in Chapter Seven, that in
part focused on the appearance and texture of raw materials comprising each of
the assemblages, revealed significant differences between them. It seems clear
now that the chert that comprises the assemblage from Colha is local. It appears
primarily as uniform tan brown (honey brown), banded, and mottled pale brown
and brown chert. The majority of the assemblage is comprised of fine to very fine
textured raw material. The raw material was likely quarried in and around Colha,
likely as part of the quarrying activity integral to the intensive craft production of
utilitarian tool forms. Some of the finished forms were likely introduced into
horizontal socioeconomies of exchange that resulted in the appearance of Colha
materials at other sites in the region. Forms were also likely produced for
acquisition and display by local elites.
The Altun Ha raw materials exhibit a distinct appearance as well.
Archaeological survey undertaken during the early 1980's and the mid- 1990's
documented lithic workshop deposits located outside the site center. These
deposits yielded raw material that was distinct in appearance. The raw material in
these deposits is similar to the artifacts recovered in tomb and cache contexts in
the site center. The raw material appears much darker and more mottled in

283

appearance. There are much fewer artifacts that are comprised of banded chert.
There are more moderately fine textured and coarse textured materials in the
Altun Ha assemblage. It seems apparent that the artifacts in the Altun Ha
assemblage were likely produced from locally quarried raw material. The
materials were then crafted and finished in workshop areas in the central precinct
or on the periphery, perhaps in the area to the north of the site at Chicawate.
The Lamanai raw materials are similar in some respects to the Altun Ha
materials. There are more dark gray and dark blue mottled materials with also
artifacts comprised of dark brown chert. There are far more moderately fine and
coarse textured chert comprising the assemblage. There are also several artifacts
that appear banded in appearance and quite thin. In comparison to the other
materials, these artifacts may have been imported. The location of Lamanai on the
New River perhaps provided a water link to lithic production sites located to the
east, in the chert bearing zone. In any case, because no lithic workshop deposits
have been documented around Lamanai, it is suggested that the raw material may
have been imported, perhaps in macroblade or macroflake- blade form. It is likely
that a center the size of Lamanai had craft communities that possessed the
technological knowledge to produce symbolic forms, if they had access to the
quality raw material. On the other hand, the late and limited appearance of the
materials in archaeological contexts may indicate that finished forms were
acquired from elite or craft communities associated with Altun Ha.
Certainly parallels in other forms of material culture such as ceramics as
well as public architecture evidence the close relationship between Altun Ha and
Lamanai. It seems reasonable to posit that flaked stone symbols were part of
large- scale gift exchanges between elites from each site. It is posited here that
these exchanges took place within the context of public ritual and feasting. In any
case, crafters of flaked stone were producing prestige items that were important to
284

solidifying a number of political- economic relationships during the Late Classic
Period.
Hypothesis Three
It is hypothesized that technological and morphological comparison of the
flaked stone symbols from Altun Ha, Colha, and Lamanai will identify a highly
standardized lithic technology developed from macroblade and macroflake- blade
technology prevalent among the craft community at Colha during the Late
Preclassic (400 BC- AD 250) and through the Classic Period (AD 250- AD 850).
Implications of Hypothesis Three
Technological standardization will be assessed utilizing both metric
measurements of individual pieces, as well as metric measurements of flake scars
present on each piece. Moreover, flake scar terminations, the presence of initial
striking platforms and platform remnants, curvature of the piece in relation to the
original macroblade or macroflake- blade, and the presence of cortex and (or)
thermal alteration are the variables which were examined in the technological
study. While artifact morphology will provide the basis for the typology based on
repetition of form, descriptive statistics based on the technological data are
employed to document technological patterns present in each assemblage.
Results
As shown in the technological analysis presented in Chapter Seven, there
are significant differences between the three assemblages under comparison.
Clearly the largest individual artifacts are present in the Lamanai assemblage.
This indicates a number of things. The first is that the crafters who produced the
artifacts may have been concerned about breaking the artifact during production.

285

Therefore they stopped short of the intensive tertiary thinning and margin
trimming seen in greater quantities in the Colha and Altun Ha assemblages.
Although a number of individual artifacts from Lamanai do show extensive
tertiary thinning and edge trimming. The overall larger dimensions of the
Lamanai assemblage may indicate that larger macroblades were being worked by
crafters associated with Lamanai.
At Colha, it is apparent that biface macroblade technology was being
employed during the Late Preclassic and Protoclassic Periods to produce flaked
stone symbols. By the Early Classic, there is little evidence of lithic production.
However, Late Classic contexts yielded bifacially worked forms as well as an
extensive array of notched blades. Overall, the metric data shows that the
assemblage is smaller than the other two assemblages. However, the chronology
of forms represented to some degree a sequence in the sense that flaked stone
symbols are present both early and late in time. Moreover, an elaborated blade
technology is also prevalent in the Colha assemblage.
The Altun Ha assemblage, for the most part reflects a mid- point between
the assemblages from Lamanai and Colha. Altun Ha, by far exhibits the largest
number of artifacts. As well, the range of forms within the assemblage is also the
greatest at Altun Ha. In contrast, the lithic technology at Altun Ha is perhaps most
uniform. Biface macroblade technology as well as the use large chert nodules
dominates that assemblage from Altun Ha. It seems likely that these locally
produced artifacts were part of a political economy that linked craft communities
to the elite, both at the site and perhaps between sites.
Hypothesis Four
It is hypothesized that many artifacts were painted and (or) adorned with
appliquÃ©s, perhaps as part of a process of personification. Moreover, the presence

286

of preserved textiles indicates that some artifacts may have been bundled prior to
deposition. A macro- analysis of the surfaces of artifacts comprising the three
assemblages indicates the presence of staining, residues, thermal alteration, and
surface polish. It is hypothesized that samples of pigment selected from Altun Ha
and Lamanai will yield similar elemental and mineralogical composition.
Implications of Hypothesis Four
If these materials were decorated, handled extensively, and (or)
personified via emically based cosmological prescriptions, they possessed
substantial cultural value.

Materials characterization analysis employing

scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, and x- ray
diffraction procedures will provide data that may indicate composition and
perhaps standardization of both pigments and textile technology.
Results
As Chapter Six and Seven have shown, the production process, followed
in turn by the processes of acquisition, use, and ultimately deposition for
individual artifacts was complex. A significant number of artifacts in the Lamanai
and Altun Ha assemblage exhibit pigments ranging from yellow to orange- red,
dark red, and dark red brown in color. In two of the specimens from Lamanai,
artifacts were clearly painted to depict specific images (see Appendix). The same
is true of several specimens from the Altun Ha assemblage. Moreover, three
specimens from Altun Ha exhibited textiles adhering to the cortex present on each
of the artifacts.
A number of specimens in the Altun Ha and Lamanai assemblages also
exhibit surface alteration and what appear to be residues. These areas of
discolored chert often correspond to areas that would be where features such as

287

the eyes or ears of specific anthropomorphic or zoomorphic forms would be. This
surface alteration and remnants of residues suggests elaboration in the production
process that goes beyond stone working, to include both painting and application
of other materials.
In terms of extensive use and handling, a number of specimens from the
Altun Ha and the Lamanai assemblage exhibit heavy use related polish, striations,
abrasion, and (or) burnishing. In the monolithic axe from Altun Ha, it is clear that
the handle was extensively used. Indeed, even the blade on this particular
specimen has been re- worked (see Chapter Six). In general, the cortex present on
the interior of ring forms from all of the sites exhibits alteration. This may
indicate shaping of the cortex for mounting or hafting of the artifacts.
Ongoing materials characterization analysis has documented the pigments
as being comprised primarily of iron- oxide (earth pigments). What remains in
doubt is the binding vehicle of these pigments. In many cases these are organic
materials. Ongoing research will hopefully reveal the composition of the binding
vehicle of these pigments. Analysis of the textile samples has revealed that both
green and red pigments are present on the surfaces of the textiles. Further research
will focus on the composition of the pigments on the textiles. Indeed, it is a goal
of the project to subject portions of each of the textile samples to radiocarbon
analysis in an attempt to obtain a chronological date for the materials.
Hypothesis Five
Classic Period lowland Maya iconography present on ceramics, mural art,
as well as carved stone and wood exhibits numerous forms that are similar to
lithic forms originating from Altun Ha, Colha, and Lamanai. Individual forms can
be linked to tangible cultural themes that run through Maya art. Themes include
legitimating particular cosmological and (or) historical events and characters.

288

These include animals that played important roles in mythology and
transformation, captives, sacrifice, as well as eclipses and celestial events. The
assignment of meaning to individual and groups of flaked stone symbols was part
of a transmission and legitimation of an iconography of power. Moreover, the
themes reflected in individual artifacts were constitutive of the social relations of
production and acquisition. Indeed, the meanings of a particular specimen
changed with the social context in which they were utilized.
Implications of Hypothesis Five
By examining individual forms within a context of what we know about
ancient Maya worldview, we can begin to understand how the Maya used a
variety of media to access knowledge and produce and legitimate a specific
ideology. Moreover, the production of these forms also helped the individual and
(or) community of crafters who produced them create their own social identity.
Thus, by gaining a further understanding of the meaning inscribed in these
symbols, we gain a clearer understanding of those who created them, as well as
those who consumed them, whatever the precise social context of use. Systematic
comparison with iconographic representation will include juxtaposing individual
lithic forms with examples from other Classic Period Maya media from a number
of lowland Maya sites.
Results
As Chapter Six illustrates, individual and groups of artifact forms exhibit
correlation with themes prevalent in other forms Maya artistic media. Carved
stone monuments from Yaxchilan were implemented as comparative data for a
number of forms in the assemblages under study here. Depictions of captives, ball
players, women, and elaborate staff ends appearing in the monuments at

289

Yaxchilan parallel the themes present in flaked stone. Moreover, the images and
depictions appearing on polychrome painted ceramics were also used as an
interpretive framework in the analysis of zoomorphic forms. A number of images
from the previous literature were also compared with forms from the assemblages.
These were primarily zoomorphic forms and wayob, or animal- human
incarnations.
It seems clear from the analysis presented in Chapter Six, symbolically the
assemblages can be divided into five groups. These include naturalized forms that
depict historical personages that were captured in warfare events as well as
individuals who were sacrificed. The assemblages also include forms that served
as incarnations and (or) depictions of wayob. Wayob were the transformative
creatures that moved between the human and animal world. Several of the
specimens also appeared to depict k' awil as a small statue or idol. These forms
likely had power attached to them associated with the deity or supernatural
represented.
Other forms likely symbolized celestial events such as eclipses and
planetary convergence as well as the supernatural characters with which these
events and (or) bodies were associated. A large number of forms, such as trefoil
and tetrafoil forms, or ring forms appear to serve as more abstracted indices of a
cultural aesthetic. These forms legitimate themes that are not overt, but are
implied forms of common knowledge, such as how the world was organized.
Finally, a number of forms likely served as either ritual or actual functioning
weaponry. What is clear that these artifacts are not eccentric, in that they are
unusual or devoid of meaning. Indeed, the symbolic value of flaked stone artifacts
occurs on three levels: as representation, as objects that reflect structural
principles, and as objects whose meaning changed in specific historical moments.

ANCIENT MAYA FLAKED STONE SYMBOLS: CLOSING COMMENTS
This dissertation has attempted to re- position a class of ancient Maya
material culture that has been to some degree neglected through the decades of
research undertaken within Maya archaeology. While over twenty- five years ago
Professor Gordon Willey called for a thorough and systematic analysis of this
artifact class, such an analysis never seemed to come to fruition. Certainly, the
description of artifacts recovered from individual sites has been critical to
documenting specific assemblages. As this study has tried to assert, these data are
invaluable in the important task of regional comparative analysis. However,
eccentric lithics were for the most part seen as interesting curiosities whose
meaning we could never access or interpret.
If this dissertation accomplishes one thing, it is to persuade researchers to
at least consider their position with respect to varying classes of material culture,
as well as to perhaps expand traditional lines of archaeological inquiry. In an
attempt to construct an interpretive framework for the artifacts under study here, a
boundary in terms of analytical approach has been breached. By implementing
contextual- descriptive and broad comparative approaches, as well as integrating
symbolic and technological data, I have attempted to some degree to construct
individual artifact histories. These histories, while never complete, begin to
broach important considerations such as the social relations of production and
acquisition as well as the symbolic and ritual contexts of use and deposition.
Ultimately, this kind of consideration necessitated the introduction of a
political- economic framework that focused on culture and history as the interplay
of institutions and actors through time and based not in the individual
accumulation or expenditure of material wealth. In this sense, I have tried to move
away from an approach that spoke of universalizing economic systems based in
notions of supply and demand. Instead I have tried to introduce a frame of
291

reference based in a limited way in the ethnohistoric literature so prevalent in
Maya studies as well as in generalized ethnographic analogy drawn from specific
cultural examples present in works within the broader discipline of anthropology.
In doing so, it is hoped that a clearer perspective on a frequently occurring, yet
enigmatic class of ancient Maya material culture has been presented.

Vita
Richard Keith Meadows, Jr. was born November 3rd, 1967 in Evanston,
Illinois. His parents are Richard and Gwendolyn Meadows of Naples, Florida. He
has one brother, Andrew. Richard graduated from Naples High School in Naples,
Florida in June 1985. After graduating from high school, he participated in an
extended student tour of the Soviet Union. This trip had a significant impact on
his worldview. In the fall of 1985, he attended Wake Forest University in
Winston- Salem, North Carolina and graduated in 1989 with a B.A. in
Anthropology with a minor in Politics. After graduation, Richard spent the next
year living and working in the Community for Creative Non- Violence Federal
City Shelter at 2nd and D Streets Northwest, Washington D.C. While at CCNV he
engaged in local and national political lobbying efforts with activists from across
the U.S. He also worked as a medic in the shelters thirty-six bed infirmary. After
leaving CCNV in late 1990, Richard returned to Florida and began applying to
graduate schools. In August 1991, he entered the graduate program in Applied
Anthropology at the University of South Florida, located in Tampa Florida. He
obtained his M.A. in August of 1995 with an emphasis in Public Archaeology. In
August of 1996, he entered the graduate program at the University of Texas at
Austin.
Richard gained extensive field experience in archaeology during his
graduate work at USF. He worked primarily in southeastern North America, in
Florida, North Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee. He worked for the National
Park Service in 1992 and also served as Field Director of the Apalachicola
Archaeological Project in northwest Florida in 1993. While at USF, Richard had
the opportunity to complete a semester long independent study in Central
America. It was then his interest in the culture and archaeology of the Maya
began. While finishing his thesis on a hunter- gatherer site in west central Florida,
673

he participated in archaeological fieldwork at the sites of Cerros and Caracol in
Belize. After moving to Austin and beginning his doctoral work at the University
of Texas, Richard conducted archaeological survey around the site of Altun Ha,
northern Belize. He participated in several archaeological projects in Texas and
Arkansas. He also served as Operation Director for the Chan Chich
Archaeological Project at Chan Chich, Belize in 1997 and 1998. For the last
several field seasons he has served as a lithic analyst for the Lamanai
Archaeological Project. Richard will begin his teaching career in the very near
future.
