ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of the site of the proposed water supply
improvement project in north-central Runnels County, Texas was performed by
Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) on August 14 and 15, 2015 under
Antiquities Permit 7381 issued by the Texas Historical Commission (THC). This
survey examined five areas where water wells are proposed, one proposed ground
storage tank site, and segments of proposed transmission lines that connect with
the above mentioned improvements. These lines cross Antelope Creek in two
places. The total number of acres is 17.71. The field methods included a 100%
pedestrian survey and shovel testing. No evidence of a prehistoric or historic site
was observed. Antelope Creek is the only major water source in the area surveyed
and it is an intermittent stream that probably only contained water following rains
and would not have been a likely setting for a prehistoric camp. Most of the soils
are heavy clay at the surface and that negates the possibilty of buried deposits.
It is recommended that the City of Winters be allowed to proceed with construction
as planned. Copies of the report will be housed at the THC, Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL), Texas State Library, City of Winters, Enprotec/Hibbs
& Todd, regional libraries, and BVRA.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Winters proposes to supplement their raw water supply with
groundwater by installing five water wells, one ground storage tank, and 15,048
feet of transmission lines in Runnels County, Texas (Figure 1). The entire tract is
located in an upland setting of about 1862 feet above mean sea level. The major
source of water that would have been available in the prehistoric past is Antelope
Creek, an intermittent stream that runs from north to south and is dry much of the
year. There are no cemeteries and standing structures in or near the Area of
Potential Effect and not one is related to the existing wastewater treatment plant.
Funding for this project will be provided by the Texas Water Development Board
Drinking Water State Revolving Fund loan program. Figure 2 depicts the project
area on the USGS 7.5’ topographic quadrangle Winters (3199-333).
The actual location of the wells and storage tank is not known at this time.
A large footprint for each one has been created to allow movement within these
areas for the final well placement. In all, there are five tracts that are referred to
in this report as areas A through E (Figure 2). Area A is 2.29 acres in size and
will contain one well if drilling is successful. This area is north of Ranch Road
1770 and is on the west bank of Antelope Creek. Area B is slightly more than 4.5
acres in size and will contain one well if drilling is successful. This area is north
of Ranch Road 1770 and is on the east bank of Antelope Creek. Area C is 2.209
acres in size and will contain one well if drilling is successful. This area is north of
Ranch Road 1770 and is on the west bank of Antelope Creek. Area D is 0.588
acres in size and will contain one well if drilling is successful. This area is south
of Ranch Road 1770 in a cultivated field about .26 kilometers due east of
Antelope Creek. Area E is 1.885 acres in size and will contain a ground storage
tank. This area is on the north side of Ranch Road 1770 in a wooded area
adjacent to the highway.
Most of the transmission line will be constructed in the right-of-way of
Ranch Road 1770 and County Road 170. The remainder will traverse cross
country and connect with the proposed wells and storage tank. Two segments
will cross Antelope Creek from east to west and connect with the proposed wells
at Area A and Area C.

ENVIRONMENT
In Perttula’s “Introduction to Texas Prehistoric Archeology,” he places the
project area in the Rolling Plains physiographic zone (Perttula 2004:Figure 1.2)
and the Warm Temperate Grassland vegetation habitat of Texas (Perttula
2004:Figure 1.3). The soil survey for Runnels County (Wiedenfield et al. 1970)
describes the terrain as nearly level to gently sloping. In the northeastern part of
the county there are a few steep limestone hills but about 40% of the county has
slopes of less than one foot fall in every one hundred feet. The nearly level land
in the area is some of the best farmland in the county. Areas with steeper slopes
are suitable for farming but erosion control is needed. About 27% of the county
is too steep, too shallow, or too sandy for crops. In about 71% of the total
acreage of the county, the soils developed in plains outwash or very old alluvium.
Seventeen percent developed in limestone and lesser amounts developed in
recent steam alluvium (7%), red marine clay, sandstone, conglomerate, or a
combinaton of these materials (5%). On about 65% of the acreage, the soils are
more than 20 inches deep; on 19% they are between 10 and 20 inches deep;
and on 16% they are less than 10 inches deep. On about 81% of the acreage,
the surface layer is loamy; on about 18% it is clay or clay with silt; and on 1% it is
sandy. On about 86% of the acreage, the soils are calcareous throughout. The
climate in the area is defined as subtropical-subhumid. Temperatures vary from
an average of 44° F to 69 ° F. in January and 75° to 100° F. in July. The averge
annual temperature is 74° F.. Rainfall averages 19 inches annually and the
growing season is long at 295 days (Alvarez 2004).
According to the soil survey for Runnels County (Wiedenfield et al. 1970),
the APE is in areas containing soils from the Rowena series, Spur series, and
Colorado series. Specific soils are described as Colorado and Yahola soils (Cy),
Rowena and Tobasa soils, 0 to 1 percent slopes (RtA), and Spur loam (Sp). The
Cy soils are described by Wiedenfield et al. (1970:9) as 80% Colorado loam and
20% Yahola fine sandy loam. They occur as long narrow strips along all of the
major streams in the county, especially the Colorado River. The mapping for these
soils included the channels of small intermittent streams such as Antelope Creek.
Rta soils are described by Wiedenfield et al. (1970:21-22) as smooth scattered
areas throughout the outwash plain. These soils have high clay content that is
often present on the surface. Sp soils are described by Wiedenfield et al. (1970:23)
as occuring as long narrow areas on the higher parts of the floodplain. Most areas
within this soil type are level with some gentle slopes along filled in stream
channels. The predominant soil series are the Rowena with heavy clay loam
(10YR 4/2) to 18 inches, Spur (7.5YR 4/2 over 7.5YR 4/4) with loam to 32 inches,
and Tobosa (10YR4/2 over (10YR5/2) with clay to 50 inches.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
According to a statistical overview of prehistoric sites in Texas (Biesaart,
et al. 1985:Figure 15), Runnnels County is located in the Lower Plains Culturalgeographical region of Texas. It is a border county being next to the North
Central Texas and Central Texas cultural-geographical regions and there were
probably shared cultural traits among these three areas. In 1985, there were
1302 recorded sites in the region (6.44% of the state). This region encompassed
37 counties.
According to Perttula (personal communication), the current project area
probably belongs to the West-Central Texas Region as illustrated in his book
entitled The Prehistory of Texas (Perttula 2004:Figure 1.1). Perttula
(2004:Figure 1.4) selected the McLean site (41TA29) as the only important
Paleoindian site in this region.(2004:Figure 1.4). E. B. Sayles recorded this site
in 1930. In his discussion of recent archaeological investigations in the Abilene
section, he mentions this site as a place where several Folsom points were found
in a deeply eroded dry gully. No sites dating to the Archaic or Late Prehistoric
were selected as significant for this region. Much of this region is not well known
in terms of its prehistoric past. The southern part of the West-Central Texas
Region is included in the Blowout Mountain Phase that dates to the Late
Prehistoric, preceeding the Toyah Phase (Perttula 2004:Figure 1.7) and the
southern boundary represents the northen limits of the Toyah Cultural Area that
dates to the Late Prehistoric (Perttula 2004:Figure 1.7).
In Runnels County, there were 165 known prehistoric sites (12.69% of the
region and 0.82% of the state). Two sites were classified as Paleoindian, 4 as
Early Archaic, 14 as Middle Archaic, 21 as Late Archaic, 14 as General Archaic,
and 10 as Late Prehistoric. Today, there are 276 recorded sites in the county,
and this figure includes sites classified as prehistoric, historic, and multicomponent. At the time the overview was compiled, one sites had been
designated as a State Archeological Landmark. No sites were listed in the
National Register of Historic Places. Types of sites and features included hearths
(n=65), burned rock middens (n=18), unspecified burned rock features (n=30),
sites in midden soil (n=1), sites with stone work (n=1), sites with burials (n=1),
quarry sites (n=35), and stone tool manufacturing sites (n=30). Disturbance was
recognized as a major factor in evaluating site condition. Erosion was the major
form of disturbance at 159 sites, followed by “disturbed construction disturbance
at 31 sites. Other noted forms of disturbance included deflated (n=15), dispersed
(n=67), vandalized through digging (n=8), and surface collected by nonprofessionals (n=118).

A review of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas revealed that no surveys
have been conducted on Antelope Creek and no sites recorded anywhere along
this drainage. Antelope Creek is a tributary of Elm Creek, a much larger
perennial stream to the east, that is a tributary of the Colorado River. The
nearest recorded sites are to the east and west and were found as the result of
reservoir construction on larger streams.
To the west, sites 41RN173 and 41RN174 were found by archaeologists
working for the Texas Department of Water Resources in 1981. The purpose of
the survey was to examine a proposed alternate location of a wastewater
treatment facility for the City of Winters (Jurgens 1981). This project followed
testing of prehistoric site 41RN101 as recommended by W. Hayden Whitsett
(1979) who located the site durng a reconnaisance survey. Eddie Guffee (1979)
of the Llano Estacado Museum conducted the testing and found the site not to be
significant.
Jurgens conducted a survey on May 13, 1981 and examined 25 acres
between Bluff Creek and a relict channel scar. Site 41RN173 was found on a
slight rise between two shallow washes. Jurgens described it as a small scatter
of lithic debitage and thermally altered chert. Cultural materials appeared to be
restricted to the surface and Jurgens considered the site to represent an area of
short term occupation. Site 41RN174 was found on a low, levee-like terrace
remnant between two relict channel scars on the east side of Bluff Creek.
Artifacts were restricted to the surface and consisted of debitage, a bipolar
pebble core, and thermally altered chert cobble cores. Jurgens believes the site
dates to sometime during the Late Archaic because of it proximity to site
41RN101 where a Castroville-like point was found. Both sites were not
considered to contain significant research potential due to the shallow nature of
deposits and past disturbance.
The nearest large scale survey to the project area (3.28 km) was
conducted by archaeologists from Southern Methodist University (SMU) in the
Elm Creek watershed (Lynott 1978). The purpose of this project was to locate,
record, and evaluate cultural resources that will be affected by construction of the
ten proposed floodwater retarding structures in Runnels and Taylor counties.
This project examined areas scattered about the counties and recorded 108
prehistoric and historic sites. Twenty-nine sites were found in the area nearest
the APE.

METHODS
Prior to entering the field, the site records at TARL and the Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas were checked for the presence of previously recorded
sites and other archaeological surveys in the project area and vicinity. Relevant
archaeological reports documenting work in Runnels County were reviewed in
order to become familiar with the types of prehistoric and historic sites found in the
area. Contract reports and articles by Guffee 1979, Jurgens 1981, Lynott 1978,
Ray 1930, and Whitsett 1979 were among those reviewed prior to this study. Major
works such as Perttula’s (2004) The Prehistory of Texas were also examined.
The field methods included a 100% surface inspection and shovel testing
at high probability areas. The soils were too hard for normal screening.
Therefore, clumps of clay were broken apart by hand and examined for cultural
materials. The profile of each test was visually examined as well. The shovel
test data were entered onto a shovel test log (Appendix I) and digital photography
(Appendix II) was used to capture the various areas and features of the project
area. Shovel test locations were plotted on a sketch map and documented with a
hand-held GPS. Changes in soil texture and color were noted and a Munsell chart
was used to consistently document the color. The daily activities were documented
in a field notebook.
The Project Archaeologist began on August 14, 2015 and he was
accompanied by Becky Crowe (Project Manager for Enprotec/Hibbs & Todd, Inc.)
who was present for a portion of the day. The survey began at the intersection of
County Road 170 and Farm-to-Market Road 153 and ended at Area D. Shovel
testing was carried out at the first creek crossing, along the transmission line to
Area D, and within the footprint of Area D. On the second day, the footprint for
the proposed ground storage tank (Area E), the main transmission line, the three
remaining well sites (areas A-C), and the secondary lines that connect them to
the main transmission line were examined. This portion of the survey also
involved two creek crossings. Fourty-seven shovel tests were dug throughout
the APE (Figure 4).

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Examination of the files at TARL in Austin, Texas and the Atlas revealed no
sites had been previously recorded within the boundaries of the current project area
and no portion had been examined by a professional archaeologist, The field
survey involved two full days of surface inspection and shovel testing. No
prehistoric or historic sites were found. Although sites in the region have been
reported near intermittent streams (Biessart et al. 1985:80-81), the physical setting
of the area along Antelope Creek does not appear to have been a desirable locale
for anything other than very transient usage. The headwaters of this creek are
about one-half mile to the north. At its widest point within the current project area it
is only four feet wide at best. The channel is not very deep and it has all of the
earmarks of having been caused by runoff during heavy rains. It would not have
been a regularly dependable source of water. The soils in the area vary from loamy
clay to hard clay. These are the kinds of soils that are usually only present in
prehistoric sites that were occupied for short periods. Upland lithic quarry sites are
not tied to water. It is possible that such sites exist in the area but no cobbles or
nodules large enough to be considered for stone tool manufacture were present.
The statement that the APE is a low probability area for significant
prehistoric sites seems to be supported, at least in part, by previous work in the
area. The Elm Creek survey conducted by SMU in 1977 is the nearest large scale
survey to the APE and Elm Creek is a much larger drainage than Antelope Creek.
The SMU project recorded numerous sites, 29 of which are those nearest to the
current APE. Only one site was believed to have enough depth to warrant
subsurface testing. The rest of the sites were recorded as lithic scatters, chipping
stations, and quarries. Only one site (41RN65) yielded biface fragments believed
to be mid-sections of projectile points. All of the 29 sites were found on landforms
described as bottomlands, upland slopes, and uplands. The authors hypothesized
that the primary activities of these sites were primary lithic procurement and rough
stone tool manufacture. Four sites were designated as areas where animals were
processed and/or possible camps. One site was believed to have been an area
where bone and wood tools were manufactured.
The field survey identified areas of disturbance that would affect the integrity
of a prehistoric site that was not deeply buried. Areas A, B, and D are located in
RtA soils where clay at the surface was prominent. It appears from the maps in the
soil survey that Area B may also include a portion of Sp soils. Area C is totally
within Sp soils and Area E is within Cy soils and perhaps areas of RtA and Sp soils.
Perhaps the most obvious disturbance was in Area D, a field that had been recently
cultivated. The surface inspection of low probability areas confirmed disturbance to
the landscape along those portions of the transmission line that will be placed in
highway right-of-way and a lack of culturall materials on the surface anywhere
within the APE. Numerous lithic scatters, chipping stations, and quarry sites were
reported to the east during the Elm Creek survey by SMU (Lynott 1978), but no raw
materials suitable for stone tool manufacture were observed,

RECOMMENDATIONS
It is recommended that the client be allowed to proceed with construction as
planned. Should evidence of a prehistoric or historic site be encountered during any
phase of construction in any of the areas investigated, all work must stop until the
THC can evaluate the situation. This survey was conducted in accordance with the
Minimum Survey Standards as outlined by the THC.
