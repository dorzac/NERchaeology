ABSTRACT

The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) is proposing to improve the east (northbound)
and west (southbound) US 75 frontage roads between Midpark Road in Richardson, Dallas
County, Texas, and President George Bush Turnpike in Plano, Collin County, Texas.
Construction will consist of the addition of acceleration/deceleration lanes as well as improving
the turning radius onto several side streets along the frontage roads (CSJ 0047-07-206). Although
the project area extends about 30,000 feet (5.68 miles), only approximately 528 feet of the project
area will be impacted; 0.35 acres of new right-of-way (ROW) is required for the corner clips. A
reconnaissance evaluation was conducted to determine the potential for archeological deposits or
remains that might exist and be impacted by construction within the current right-of-way. No
archeological remains or cultural deposits were observed, and the project area demonstrates
significant disturbance due to urban development and little potential for intact archeological
deposits. All notes and photos are on file at Geo-Marine, Inc.

INTRODUCTION
The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) is proposing improvements to portions of US
75 frontage roads along a 5.68-mile long segment between Midpark Road in Richardson, Dallas
County, Texas, and President George Bush Turnpike in Plano, Collin County, Texas (Figure 1).
The project entails adding acceleration/deceleration lanes to the northbound and southbound
frontage roads and improving the turn radius at several intersections along these roads
(Appendix). Specific locations for improvements along the west (southbound) frontage road are
at the intersections with Dumont Drive, Monte Blaine Lane, Melrose Drive, entrance and exit
ramps to Collins Boulevard, Gateway Boulevard, Municipal Drive, Fall Creek Drive, and
Palisades Boulevard. Along the east (northbound) frontage road, areas to be affected occur at
Prestonwood Drive, Jackson Street, East Lookout Drive, Glenville Drive, and the south frontage
road to the President George Bush Turnpike. Construction will affect approximately 528 feet of
the entire project area. The proposed construction will require 0.35 acres of new right-of-way
(ROW) for the corner clips. The Area of Potential Effects (APE) for this project consists of both
new and existing ROW.

The planning and engineering firm Turner Collie & Braden (TCB), Inc., has been contracted to
plan the improvements and perform the environmental studies associated with those
improvements. In turn, TCB has subcontracted with Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI), of Plano, Texas, to
complete an archeological resources reconnaissance of the project corridor in order to identify the
potential for the presence of existing archeological resources (GMI Project #30011.08.01.02).
GMI archeologist Angela Tiné conducted the archeological resources reconnaissance on 26
October 2005. Melissa Green served as Principal Investigator for the project. The following
report details the investigations undertaken as part of the reconnaissance.

PROJECT SETTING
The project area extends along former upland prairie in southern Collin County and northern
Dallas County within the cities of Plano and Richardson. The setting is now heavily urban. The
project corridor crosses Spring Creek and an unnamed tributary of Spring Creek along the Upper
Cretaceous Austin Chalk formation (Bureau of Economic Geology 1987). The soil units mapped
within the project area consist of the following:

Urban land

The Urban land soil unit and the Urban land complexes are mapped in Dallas County, whereas
the soil units not associated with Urban land are mapped in Collin County. This difference is a
by-product of both the timing of the northward urban expansion of the Dallas-Fort Worth
metroplex, which did not reach Collin County until relatively recently, and when the soil surveys
were conducted for each county. The Collin County soil survey was conducted in the late 1950s
and early 1960s, and the subsequent publication typically describes conditions as of 1964
(Hanson and Wheeler 1969). The Dallas County soil survey was performed more recently, and
the publication data generally reflect conditions as of 1975 (Coffee et al. 1980). Both counties
have developed significantly since these soil surveys were published.

Urban land describes areas where at least 75 percent of the surface is covered with buildings and
pavement, and the soils have been altered or covered to the extent that it is not practical or
possible to identify and separate them for mapping (Coffee et al. 1980:36). Urban land-soil
complexes describe areas where significant portions have been developed and disturbed;
however, large areas, usually between 40 and 55 percent, of undisturbed soil remain and can be
identified (Coffee et al. 1980).

Among the soils mapped along the project corridor, the Houston Black series is the most
commonly represented in both counties. Houston Black soils are deep, calcareous, clayey soils
formed in calcareous clay or chalky marl. They are nearly level to moderately sloping and occur

3

on uplands (Hanson and Wheeler 1969). These soils usually consist of 40.6 cm (16 in) to
111.8 cm (44 in) of very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay above an additional 40.6 cm (16 in) to
111.8 cm (44 in) of light gray (10YR 7/1) clay. Light gray (2.5Y 7.2) clay constitutes the C
horizon.

Austin series soils, in the form of the Austin-Urban complex, are also common along the project
area but occur only in the Dallas County portion of the project area. Austin soils are moderately
deep, well-drained clayey soils formed in material derived from soft chalky limestone of the
Austin Chalk formation (Coffee et al. 1980). A typical profile demonstrates a 25.4-cm (10-in) A
horizon very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silty clay. The upper 25.4 cm (10 in) of the B
horizon is brown (7.5YR 5/4) silty clay with fine limestone pebbles in the lower 12.7 cm (5 in),
while the lower 30.5 cm (12 in) of the B horizon is brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay with soft calcium
carbonate lumps and concretions. The underlying C horizon is composed of beds of platy chalky
limestone.

After Houston Black soils, Lewisville soils are the most common series in the Collin County
portion of the project area. These sloping to moderately sloping, deep, calcareous, clayey soils
occur on stream terraces and uplands. They formed in alluvium deposited by streams that drain
soils underlain by chalky limestone (Hanson and Wheeler 1969).

A representative profile

consists of an 20.3-cm (8-in) A horizon of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) light silty clay above
an 45.7-cm (18-in) grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay subsoil with many strongly cemented
calcium carbonate concretions. Pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay with numerous soft masses of
segregated calcium carbonate and a few strongly cemented calcium carbonate concretions
constitutes the C horizon.

Small portions of the project area in both counties consist of Eddy series soils. Eddy soils are
very shallow, calcareous, loamy soils underlain by chalky limestone (Hanson and Wheeler 1969).
They are gently sloping to sloping and occur on uplands. A typical profile consists of 12.7 cm
(5 in) of grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly clay loam with strongly cemented, platy fragments of
chalk above 12.7 cm (5 in) of whitish platy chalk with grayish brown clay loam between the
plates of chalk. The underlying layer is chalky limestone.

4

Trinity clay, occasionally flooded, occurs along the main channel of Spring Creek in the Collin
County portion of the project corridor. Trinity soils are fairly level, deep, calcareous, clayey soils
on flood plains of major streams and their tributaries (Hanson and Wheeler 1969). A typical
profile demonstrates an A horizon composed of an upper 12.7-cm (5-in) layer of very dark gray
(10YR 3/1) clay above 22.9 cm (9 in) of dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay with free lime. The
underlying C horizon is dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay.

The Altoga series is the least common series along the project area and occurs only along the
Collin County segment. Altoga soils are deep, calcareous, light-colored, clayey soils on uplands
and stream terraces (Hanson and Wheeler 1969). They are sloping to strongly sloping and eroded
to severely eroded. In a typical profile, the surface layer consists of 17.8 cm (7 in) of light
brownish gray (10YR 6/2) light silty clay. The subsoil is 134.6 cm (53 in) of clay that is pale
brown (10YR 6/3) to 63.5 cm (25 in) below surface (bs) and lightens to very pale brown (10YR
7/3) silty clay with soft masses of calcium carbonate. The C horizon is very pale brown (10YR
7/3) silty clay.

CULTURAL SETTING
Prikryl (1987) established a generalized prehistoric chronological framework of six periods for
the Upper Trinity River Basin. Investigations at Lewisville Lake in Denton County (Lebo and
Brown 1990) and Joe Pool Lake in Dallas County (Peter and McGregor 1988) refined this
framework to a four-period model. The overall regional applicability of the phases recognized at
both lakes, however, remains to be demonstrated. The generalized chronology presented here
(Table 1) reflects the present state of knowledge as interpreted from both sets of investigations
but is based primarily on the model provided by Peter and McGregor (1988). Lebo and Brown
(1990; Brown and Lebo 1991) present a chronology keyed specifically for Lewisville Lake, but it
closely follows the chronology proposed for Joe Pool. Detailed synopses of the chronology of the
area can be found elsewhere and will therefore not be discussed in this report.

METHODS
Prior to fieldwork, a review of the Texas Site Atlas website was conducted to determine if any
known sites were located within either the project corridor or within a one-mile radius of the
corridor. Two previously recorded sites, 41COL83 and 41DL372, were noted within one mile of
the project area, although not within the project area itself.

Site 41COL83 is located

approximately 60 east of the east US 75 frontage road and about 60 m north of Glenville Drive.
The site was originally recorded by AR Consultants, Inc., in 1991 as a historic family cemetery
belonging to the Jacob Routh family. Routh is an important figure in the history of Plano and
Collin County. GMI revisited the site in 1996 during a survey for the Dallas Area Rapid Transit
(DART) system and extended the boundaries to encompass the entire Routh homestead complex,
which includes a second, larger community cemetery, a pet cemetery, and the Routh residence
and outbuildings (Green et al. 1997). The site is at a sufficient distance from the project area that
it will not be impacted by the proposed highway improvements.

GMI identified the other archeological site, 41DL372, during the same 1996 DART survey. It
was located approximately 20 m east of the east frontage road, directly east of the Southern
Pacific railroad tracks, which have since been replaced by tracks and bed for the DART light rail,
and approximately 300 m south-southwest of East Lookout Drive. The site consisted of two
historic artifact concentrations and a low-density artifact scatter that represented the remnants of a
late nineteenth to early twentieth century domicile (Green et al. 1997). In addition to 41DL372
being distant from any area that will be directly impacted by the proposed construction, recent
disturbances to the general area from construction of Galatyn Parkway, a rail station, a hotel and
other commercial structures has destroyed the site.
6

The field methods consisted of a reconnaissance (windshield) survey. Photographs were taken of
the general landscape along the route and the specific intersections to be affected. Notes were
taken of the conditions along the entire route with particular attention paid to the areas of
proposed improvements.

OBSERVATIONS

West (Southbound) Frontage Road

Dumont Drive, Monte Blaine Lane, and Melrose Drive
Proposed improvements will consist of increasing the turn radius at both corners these
intersections and will entail removal of part of the existing corners. These areas are extensively
developed, and the existing ROW at each intersection consists primarily of concrete sidewalk
(Figure 2), although additional disturbances such as sewers, sign posts, and light posts also occur
(Figure 3). The area immediately west of the ROW at each intersection is a grassy strip that is
elevated relative to the roadway to the east and a parking lot to the west (Figure 4). These areas
were most likely graded during construction of the parking lots, and contain additional
underground disturbances from sewers, sign posts, light and utility poles, buried cables, and
landscaping with trees and shrubbery.

Collins Boulevard
The turn radius at the north corner of the entrance ramp is to be widened, and an acceleration lane
from the exit ramp is planned. The property near the north corner is heavily developed and the
existing ROW consists of a concrete sidewalk (Figure 5). The green space adjacent to the ROW
contains trees, shrubbery, and light posts, and was most likely fabricated after the area had been
graded when the neighboring building and parking lot were constructed. The south corner is
primarily sidewalk with some grass that has been disturbed by sign and utility posts and a sewer
line. A concrete stabilized berm for a railroad bridge occurs west of the ROW (Figure 6), and its
construction probably impacted the surrounding area.

Gateway Boulevard and Municipal Drive
The only proposed modification at these intersections is widening the turn radius at the south
corner at Gateway Boulevard and both corners at Municipal Drive. Sidewalks line the ROW in
all three areas. Sign posts also occur in the ROW at the south corner of Gateway Boulevard
(Figure 7), and signs and a water line are evident in the ROW at south corner of Municipal Drive
(Figure 8). All three corners are adjacent to artificially constructed green areas that contain utility
poles, buried cables, and trees and shrubs.

Fall Creek Drive
Along the north side of this intersection, a deceleration lane is planned. This area is grass lawn;
however, the curb of a concrete sidewalk, utility poles, a sewer line, and buried cable occur
within the ROW (Figure 9). Only an increased turn radius is proposed for the south side, which is

a moderately wooded strip of green space (Figure 10).

The ROW to be affected consists

primarily of concrete sidewalk. The ROW is also disturbed by a sewer line and underground
cable.

Palisades Boulevard
At Palisades Boulevard, planned improvements consist of construction of a deceleration lane to
the north and an acceleration lane to the south. The northern side is more heavily developed from
construction of an office building and parking lot. A sidewalk, driveway, utility poles, buried
cables, and a sewer line have disturbed the ROW along this side (Figure 11). The south ROW is
adjacent to a paved parking lot and a small portion of vacant lawn (Figure 12).
disturbances have impacted this area, although it lacks a sidewalk.

East (Northbound) Frontage Road

Prestonwood Drive
Proposed construction consists of less sharp corners and an acceleration lane to the north.
Concrete sidewalk occupies the small area to be affected to the south. The north side is lined
with sign posts and utility poles and appears to have been graded to provide a level surface
around the mounded area directly adjacent to the ROW (Figure 13).

Jackson Street
The only improvement proposed at this intersection consists of increasing the turn radius at each
corner. Artificial landscaping has disturbed the ROW along both sides (Figures 14 and 15). In
addition, a concrete sidewalk lines the south side, and a sewer line intrudes across the south
corner.

East Lookout Drive
Planned improvements consist of a deceleration lane to the south and an acceleration lane to the
north. To the south, the ROW consists of a slightly elevated roadbed that descends into a
depression between US 75 and the DART rail grade to the east. (Figure 16). A sewer line also
extends along the ROW. Sign posts, underground utility lines, and a paved driveway have
disturbed the ROW to the north of the intersection (Figure 17). In addition, the ground surface
along both sides demonstrates erosion.

Glenville Drive
This intersection will require a deceleration lane to the south and an improved turn radius to the
north. Disturbances to the south consist of a paved driveway, a water line, underground cable, a
light post, and mild erosion (Figure 18). A portion of a sidewalk, a water line, a buried cable, and
mild erosion have impacted the north side (Figure 19).

President George Bush Turnpike
Proposed improvements consist of a deceleration lane to the turnoff to the south frontage road of
President George Bush Turnpike. The turn radius will also be increased. Although this grassy
area is vacant, a sewer line and buried cable extend along the existing ROW (Figure 20).

Figure 20. Right-of-way disturbances at US 75 and President George Bush Turnpike; looking north (CSJ 0047-07206).

RECOMMENDATIONS
The segment of US 75 is located along uplands within an urban setting in the cities of Richardson
and Plano. The area has already been impacted by the construction of sidewalks, driveways,
landscaping, light posts, sign posts, overhead electrical lines, buried fiber optic lines, and buried
water and sewer lines. No evidence of any sites was identified in the project area and the
likelihood of surface sites in this area is extremely low. Therefore, it is recommended that
proposed construction would have no effect on historic properties.
19

Based on the results of the impact evaluation, there is a low potential for deposits containing
archeological materials within the current or proposed ROW or easements. However, in the
unlikely event that evidence of archeological deposits is encountered during construction, work in
the immediate area shall immediately cease. TxDOT archeological staff shall be contacted in
order to initiate accidental discovery procedures under the provisions of the Programmatic
Agreement (PA) between TxDOT, Texas Historical Commission (THC), Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA), and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation and the
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between TxDOT and THC.
