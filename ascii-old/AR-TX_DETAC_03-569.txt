ABSTRACT
In October 2015 Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants (DETAC)
conducted a cultural resource management survey for the City of Tyler, Texas of three
tracts totaling 57 hectares (141 acres) at the east end of CR 2133 west of the Lake Tyler
West for timber thinning operations. The pedestrian survey was conducted under Texas
Antiquities Permit #7376 in compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas. The visual
examination of the tracts found two clearings with debris, a segment of South Hillcreek
Road, and three segments of a logging road. No artifacts were collected. Shovel testing
of the project area did not recover any cultural material. No artifacts were collected or
curated. DETAC is requesting concurrence with the determination of “no effect” to State
Archaeological Landmarks or National Register of Historic Places eligible properties and
SAL as defined by the Antiquities Code of Texas for the proposed timber thinning.

INTRODUCTION
In October 2015, Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants (DETAC)
conducted a cultural resources survey for the City of Tyler, Texas of three tracts at the
east end of CR 2133 near the Lake Tyler West (Figure 1). The survey was conducted
upon request of the City of Tyler for timber thinning operations in compliance with the
Texas Antiquities Code. The project was reviewed by the Texas Historical Commission
(THC) under Texas Antiquities Permit #7376. All terms of the permit were carried out
pursuant of the Texas Antiquities Code.
The purpose of this survey was to locate, describe and record any cultural
resources within the project area boundaries. The pedestrian survey found two clearings
with road building debris and abandoned boats near the northwest corner, a segment of
South Hillcreek Road in the north central section, and three segments of a logging road in
the south central portion of the project area. No historic period sites were found in
association with the clearings or the road segments. No artifacts were collected from the
surface inspection and no artifacts, historic or prehistoric, were found in shovel tests in
the project area; therefore, no artifacts were curated.
The report was prepared following the short report format outlined by the Council
of Texas Archaeologist (CTA) (2005a). Based on fieldwork, DETAC recommends a
determination of “no effect” to cultural resources eligible to the National Register of
Historic Places or State Archaeological Landmarks for the proposed timber thinning
operations.
DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The proposed timber thinning includes removing select trees from the three tracts
totaling 57 hectares (141 acres (ac)) with heavy machinery. The three tracts include the
summit and backslope of an upland ridge along with an ancient stream terrace. The tracts
are surrounded by Slack Road and South Point Road with modern residences outside of
the roads adjacent to the lake shore. There is no obvious modern development in the
project area. Vegetation includes mixed hard and soft wood trees with moderate to dense
understory of various bushes, shrubs, and vines. Ground cover is leaf litter and deadfall.
Soils are include Bowie (BoB), Kirvin (KgC), and pits (Px) on the ridge summit with

Gallime (GaB) and Delry-Besner (Db) complex on the backslope and terrace (NRCS
2015). Bowie, Cuthbert, and Kirvin soil series have A and E horizons of fine sandy loam
between 10 and 28 cm (4 and 11 in) over a Bt horizon of sandy clay loam. Gallime series
soils have roughly 65 cm (28 in) of fine sandy loam over sandy clay loam. Derly series
soils are in swales with 35 cm (14 in) of silt loam over clay loam interspersed with ridges
of Besner fine sandy loam 155 cm (63 in) deep over silty clay loam.
PREVIOUS RESEARCH AND CULTURAL HISTORY
Overall, Smith County was part of broad studies and investigated in both larger
examinations and numerous small surveys. The large area investigations in the area are
limited to those along Lake Fork Reservoir (e.g., Brusheth et al 1977) to the northwest
and Lake Palestine (e.g., Keith 1971) to the south. Large linear surveys were conducted
for new roads (e.g., Campbell et al. 2008). The smaller surveys were typically for road
improvements (e.g., Nelson and Perttula 2012). These investigations found, tested, and
conducted data recovery efforts on a variety of historic and prehistoric sites. Most of the
surveys mentioned above focused on low lands and areas adjacent to perennial streams
and well developed floodplains. The numerous small surveys in the area include both
upland and lowland settings. The investigations that documented archaeological sites
found that prehistoric and early historic sites were found adjacent to stream channels in
the floodplains on first terraces or along the toe slopes of higher ridges.
In addition to the fieldwork referenced above, several documents have added
significantly to available information on the archaeological record in this region.
Initially, D.A. Story and others (1990) and J.A. Guy's (1990) describe the prehistoric
cultures of the Gulf Coastal Plain from southwest Oklahoma to the Gulf Coast. The
Texas Historical Commission, Department of Antiquities Protection developed a
document for the eastern Texas portion of the Texas State Plan (Perttula and Kenmotsu
1993). This document includes several historic contexts, each of which deals with a
particular facet of northeast Texas prehistory. More recently, Perttula (2004:370-407)
describes the Caddoan archaeology of northeast Texas which encompasses the area
between the Red River in the north, the Trinity River in the west, and Angelina River in the
south.

3

The occupation of the area ranges from the Paleoindian (ca. pre-7000 B.C.) to
Archaic foraging cultures (ca. 7000-200 B.C.), Early Ceramic Period groups (ca. 200
B.C. - A.D. 800), the sedentary Caddoan occupation (A.D. 800 - 1680), and ends in the
historic Euro American settlement (Perttula and Kenmotsu 44:1993). The Paleo-Indian
period (ca. 10,000-7000 B.C.) is characterized by small, mobile bands of hunters and
gatherers that consumed a variety of native plants and animals (Story 1990). The Archaic
(7000-200 B.C.) refers to hunter-gatherers who implemented more regionally specialized
approaches toward exploiting their environment (Story 1990). The Early Ceramic (200
B.C.-A.D. 800) stage, also referred to as the Woodland period, represents an increasing
utilization of the environment by local groups to include a greater reliance on cultigens,
prolonged occupations at specific locales indicating an increasingly sedentary lifestyle,
and the emergence of social and ritual ceremonies (Story 1990). The prehistory of
northeast Texas in the Late Prehistoric period essentially concerns the Caddoan culture
(A.D. 800-1600). This culture is an indigenous development strongly influenced by the
Mississippian tradition of the Lower Mississippi Valley (Story 1990:323).

Larger

aggregates of people became sedentary and constructed villages with public ceremonial
areas.

Cemeteries are found in association with large ceremonial mounds (Perttula

2004:379). A stratified social structure developed, corresponding to the chiefdom level
as first defined by Service (1962, 1975). Extensive commercial networks were also
established. The Historic period (1680-present) describes both the history behind the
current cultural setting of the area and marks the expulsion of native populations and the
progression of the American immigrants as they established farms, towns, and counties.
The earliest American moved into the Neches Saline area in the late 1820’s. Smith County
was officially formed on 11 April 1846 with Tyler as the County Seat. Local farmers grew
cotton, fruit, and vegetables. Cash crops became more prevalent with the arrival of the
International-Great Northern Railroad in Whitehouse in the 1870’s. Surviving the Civil
War, the area remained rural until the East Texas oil boom. Industry, the growth of Tyler,
and the creation of Lake Tyler in the 1960’s all contributed to the growth and maintenance
of the area although, chicken, cattle, and siviculture still dominate the local economy
(Smith 2010).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
The investigations were performed in compliance with the Texas Antiquities
Code following survey standards described by the Texas Historic Commission (2015)
and report guidelines set forth by the CTA (2005b). The purpose of these investigations
was to locate prehistoric and historic cultural resources within the project area, delineate
the vertical and horizontal extent of each site, and make a preliminary evaluation of each
site's integrity and potential for State Archaeological Landmark (SAL) designation and/or
National Register of Historic Properties (NRHP) eligibility. All fieldwork and reporting
comply with the ethics standards of the Texas Archaeological Society and the Register of
Professional Archaeologists.
Before initiating fieldwork, DETAC conducted a records and literature review
using the Texas Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2015). The atlas contains a current
database with published and unpublished data regarding cultural resource surveys,
archaeological site location maps, and cultural resources records. In addition, these records
show State Archaeological Landmarks (SAL) and NRHP eligibility of previously recorded
sites.
DETAC conducted an intensive pedestrian survey of the project area relying on
shovel testing and visual examination to locate archaeological sites within the Area of
Potential Effect (APE). Shovel testing included excavating an area approximately 30
centimeters (cm) square in 10 cm (4 in) levels down to the clay substrate or 90 cm (35
in). Following to the THC guidelines, the pedestrian survey included a surface inspection
focused on areas with exposed soil (e.g., erosional features and ant mounds) along with a
minimum of 47 shovel tests in the 57 ha (141 ac) area. Shovel test locations were
recorded with Ashtech GPS units with sub-meter post-processing accuracy. Notes were
made about soil color, texture, and shovel test depth.

5

RESULTS
The project area includes three tracts totaling 57 ha (141 ac) encircled by Slack
Road and South Point Road. There is no modern development on the tracts but the area
outside the roads is dominated by modern residences adjacent to the lake shore.
Topographically, the project area is on the summit, shoulder, backslope of a wide upland
ridge with an ancient terrace overlooking Lake Tyler West. Vegetation across the tracts
is dominated by mixed hardwood and pine trees with a moderate to dense understory of
various bushes, shrubs, and vines. Ground cover is leaf litter and deadfall.
The literature search and records review of the Texas Archaeological Site Atlas
(2015) found four professional archaeological survey but no archaeological sites recorded
within 1.6 kilometers (km) (1 mile (mi)) of the project area (Appendix B). The previous
investigations include a survey along F.M. 3341 roughly one mile east of the project area
by the TDHPT in 1976, a survey of Forest Stewardship Area (FSA) 7 between F.M. 3341
and Lake Tyler East by DETAC (Galan 2013), a second FSA survey south of the Lake
Tyler West Dam (Galan2015) roughly 0.8 miles to the south, and a survey for water lines
by AR Consultants (Skinner 2005) roughly 1.1 miles southwest of the project area. Only
the survey south of Lake Tyler Dam West found an isolated find (a nutting stone) on a
sandy natural levee adjacent to Prairie Creek. The closest recorded sites are roughly 1.7
miles to the east under the pool level of Lake Tyler East.
The archaeological investigations included a visual examination and shovel
testing in the project area. The visual examination resulted in the mapping of several
surface features: two clearings, a segment of South Hillcreek Road, and three segments of
a logging road (Figure 2). Surface inspection of the two clearings found road building
rubble in the western clearing and discarded boats in the north end of the eastern clearing.
Examination of the South Hillcreek road segment found a wide level road cut with
ditches on the lateral edges. The logging road cuts were generally 3 m (10 ft) wide with
depths between a few centimeters to roughly 90 cm (36 in) deep depending on the slope
of the surrounding landscape. Examination of the Google Earth history photos extend to
1995. The 1995 photo shows the two clearings in the project area and the houses along
the lake shore outside of the project area which are no different from the August 2015
photo.

A total of 109 shovel tests were excavated across the project area with an
emphasis on ridge tops of the ridge/swale topography on the ancient terrace along the east
side of the project area (Figure 3 and Appendix A). Soils on the terrace include Gallamie
fine sandy loam and Delry-Besner complex (Db). Gallamie series soils consist of fine
sandy loam with a poorly defined Bt horizon. The Delry series are silty soils in swales
while Besner series are fine sandy loam soils on the low ridges. Delry soils were visually
examined. Besner soils were shovel tested at a high probability interval. Shovel tests on
the terrace were typically 60 to 80 cm (24 to 30 in) deep over a poorly defined Bt
horizon. Shovel testing on the upland ridge backslope and summit were excavated at a
low probability interval because of the distance to water and generally shallower soils
over a well-developed Bt horizon. Upland ridge summit and backslope tests ranged from
10 to 50 cm (4 to 20 in) deep in fine sandy loam over sandy clay. No artifacts were
found in the shovel tests and no material was collected from the debris areas locations.
No artifacts were curated.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The City of Tyler, Texas will conduct timber thinning on three tracts of land at the
east end of CR 2133 near Lake Tyler West. DETAC performed a cultural resources
survey of the tracts in compliance with the Texas Antiquities Code under Texas
Antiquities Permit #7376.

The project was reviewed by the Texas Historical

Commission.
The purpose of this survey was to locate, describe and record any cultural
resources within the project area boundaries. The surface inspection found two clearings,
a segment of South Hillcreek Road, and three segments of a logging road. Road rubble
and discarded boats were found in the clearings. No cultural material was found along
the road segments. A total of 109 shovel tests were excavated across the project area
with an emphasis on several low ridges on an ancient terrace of Pine Creek. Shovel test
found deep fine sandy loam on the ridges and shallow silty loam soil in the swales.
Upland ridge and backslope shovel tests found shallow sandy loam over a well-defined
Bt horizon. No cultural material was collected from the clearings and no artifacts were
found in shovel tests. No artifacts were curated.
Based on the shovel test results and the visual examination, there is little chance
of encountering any additional undiscovered cultural resources in the project area. In the
event that human remains and/or archaeological materials are discovered during timber
thinning, then the project activity will cease in the immediate area and DETAC shall be
notified of the discovery. DETAC requests concurrence with a determination of “no
effect” to properties listed or eligible for the NRHP as defined by the National Historic
Preservation Act and State Archaeological Landmarks as defined by the Antiquities Code
of Texas.
