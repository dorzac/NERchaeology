ABSTRACT
The City of Denton plans to construct the Pecan Creek Interceptor II & III in
Denton, Texas. In 2011, when the project started, the entire route was called
Pecan Creek Interceptor II, but by the time of the monitoring in 2015, the
portion through Civic Center Park was renamed Pecan Creek Interceptor III.
Part of this pipeline route crosses Civic Center Park, the site of the Historic
Quakertown community. This community was established in 1875 as an
African-American community. The entire community was removed from this
location in 1922 to make space for the new Civic Center Park. Several
localities have been recorded as part of a single site (41DN481) representing
the Quakertown community. AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) surveyed 811 m of
the route in 2011, finding sparse historic artifacts in the Civic Center Park
property. Due to the proximity to Quakertown, ARC recommended portions
of the pipeline installation be monitored. These investigations were led by
Rebecca Shelton.
The pipeline was installed in 2015 and monitored by Molly Hall from ARC.
The construction crew found artifacts before they reached the area that was
supposed to be monitored. At that time, they halted excavation and contacted
the monitor, who arrived before digging continued. Three main concentrations
of artifacts were identified, but all three areas represent a trash dump along
Pecan Creek with artifacts (mostly glass, previously broken ceramic, and
personal items) typically dating from the 1880s to the 1930s. Only diagnostic
historic artifacts were collected during monitoring and all artifacts that were
collected will be curated at the Courthouse-on-the-Square Museum in Denton,
Texas. Four large metal and concrete boxes were found in the backhoe trench
and fully documented. However, due to their size, they were not collected and
were disposed of.
ARC concludes that the artifacts encountered during the installation of the
Pecan Creek Interceptor III sewer line are part of site 41DN481 (Historic
Quakertown), but came from a heavily disturbed dump context. This dump
was likely deposited over several decades from the late 1800s through the
early 1900s. No structures or intact features other than the dump were
encountered. Though the refuse and dump feature are part of the NRHPeligible Quakertown site, they provide only an overarching understanding of
the general household waste produced by the residents of Quakertown and do
not contribute significantly to the understanding of the early-1900s
community.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Denton intends to construct the Pecan Creek Interceptor II & III through Civic
Center Park and along Pecan Creek, which are located in the historic downtown district of
Denton, Texas (Figure 1). The proposed pipeline is to be 36 in in diameter and 7800 ft long. The
pipeline will be installed to a maximum depth of 13 feet below the ground surface, via open cut
installation utilizing trench boxes within a 5-foot-wide trench. AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) was
hired by the City of Denton to conduct an archaeological study of the proposed pipeline route
that roughly parallels Pecan Creek. Since the City of Denton is an entity of the state, a Texas
Antiquities Permit was required for the study, and the Texas Historical Commission assigned
permit number 5852 for an intensive pedestrian survey.
A 1133-ft-long portion of the route travels through Civic Center Park, which is northeast of
downtown Denton and was identified as an area having high potential for historic artifacts or
features in the scope of work presented to the Texas Historical Commission. The park is
bordered by Withers Street on the north, Bell Street on the east, McKinney Street on the south,
and Oakland Street on the west. Civic Center Park includes part of the historic location of
Quakertown, which was an African-American community of 70 residences, churches, schools
and businesses from 1875 to 1922 (Glaze 1991). In 1922, the community was relocated after a
city vote, and a series of land purchases and condemnations led to the removal of the community
in preparation for the development of a city park (deBurgos 1991). Recent investigations in Civic
Center Park resulted in the recording of 41DN481, the historic site of Quakertown (Lebo 1990).
A well, once associated with a house in the community, was excavated and artifacts from the
turn of the century were recorded and the site was determined to be eligible for listing on the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), but has not been listed (Boyd 2005; TASA 2015).
In 2011, the site was designated as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) (TASA 2015). The
second portion of the route roughly parallels Pecan Creek north of McKinney Avenue for 1541
feet and was considered to have low potential for historic or prehistoric resources.
After survey was completed, three segments of the route were identified as needing monitoring
during installation based on the presence of artifacts in shovel tests and the routeâs proximity to
the historic locations of Quakertown. This permit was updated to include monitoring the
installation of the pipeline along these three portions of the route. As of July 2015, the northwest
segment that was to be monitored changed and now runs beneath the library parking lot and
Congress Street and, therefore, was not monitored. Additionally, between the survey in 2011 and
the monitoring in 2015, the segment through the perk had been renamed Pecan Creek Interceptor
III. On August 17, 2015, while outside the planned monitoring area, the construction crew began
to find artifacts. They immediately stopped construction and the monitoring portion was
expanded to include this area. In total, 102 m of pipeline were monitored. The survey and
monitoring were executed to determine if cultural materials were present, and, if found, to make
recommendations about their significance and how they might be impacted. The notes from
shovel testing and monitoring and the artifacts from monitoring will be curated at the
Courthouse-on-the-Square Museum in Denton.
This report was written in accordance with report guidelines adopted by the Texas Historical
Commission, Archeology Division, and developed by the Council of Texas Archeologists (n.d.).

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The project area is situated in a formerly prairie-covered area that is flanked to the east and west
by the Eastern Cross Timbers as mapped by Dyksterhuis (1946: Figure 1). The study area is
underlain by Cretaceous-aged Grayson Marl and Main Street Limestone undivided (Bureau of
Economic Geology 1991). This formation features interbedded limestone and marl, with
limestone nearest the surface. The limestone weathers to grayish yellow, and features numerous
marine fossils. To the north and south of the study area, the upland in the Cross Timbers is a post
oak savannah (Frankaviglia 2000) and is based on sandstone bedrock of the Woodbine and
undifferentiated Pawpaw Formation/Wena Limestone/Denton Clay (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1991). Pecan Creek is mapped as an intermittent drainage that passes through the area
and drains southeast into the Elm Fork of the Trinity River. No alluvial sediments are mapped
along the drainage in the study area (Bureau of Economic Geology 1991).
The entire study area is mapped as being Wilson Urban land complex (Ford and Pauls 1980:
Sheet 21). Wilson soil has a dark gray clay loam topsoil that is approximately five inches thick,
underlain by 29 inches of dark gray clay, which becomes increasingly mottled with yellowish
brown clay until the C horizon is reached at 52 inches below the surface. This soil originates
from alluvial terrace sediments, but is clearly limestone-based and thus is a prairie soil. Parts of
the ground within the park have been leveled and built up, in order to raise the park area above
the flooding from Pecan Creek. Pecan Creek itself was straightened and then lined with concrete
in the 1960s.

CULTURAL HISTORY
The prehistory of Denton County is summarized in several reports prepared by the University of
North Texas (Brown and Lebo 1991; Ferring and Yates 1998; Lebo and Brown 1990). The
historic settlement in the Denton County area began when William S. Peters and others
purchased a land grant from the Texas Congress in 1841 (Bridges 1978). The land settled by
their company, the Texian Land and Immigration Company, became known as the Peters
Colony. In 1846, the county was created out of the larger Fannin County by the Texas
Legislature. The early settlers were subsistence farmers who first farmed the Elm Fork
bottomland. Commercial farming was not important until after the Civil War, when settlement in
the county increased substantially. By 1880, approximately 50 percent of the county was being
farmed (Bridges 1978). The population increased and the arrival of the railroads in 1881
combined to create a thriving commercial agriculture industry (Caraway and Cupit 2009:7). The
main cash crops were cotton, corn, and wheat. Commercial agriculture continued to play a large
role in the countyâs economy into the 20th century.
In 1865, the City of Denton was located in the center of the county to serve as the county seat
(Caraway and Cupit 2009). A 100-acre tract centered south and southwest of Pecan Creek was
donated for the city site. Many of the early structures were made of wood, and until brick
construction became more prominent in the 1870s, fire destroyed many of the early buildings.
The downtown area of Denton was home to city services and government offices. Educational
institutions have always been important to the growth of the city, and the North Texas State
College, now known as the University of North Texas, were established in the 1890s, while the
school now known as Texas Womanâs University opened for classes in 1903. However, the
expansion of the city was not beneficial to all community members. In 1922 the city purchased
the land that comprised the African American community of Quakertown in order to develop
what is now known as Civic Center Park. Residents were forced to move, and homes were either
relocated to Solomon Hill or razed (Glaze 1991:15-16). Also in the 1920s, the city began
modernization efforts by paving streets, building schools, constructing a new city hall, and
installing street lights. The city continued to grow, and by the 1950s had outgrown its original
100 acre townsite.
Quakertown
The story of Quakertown has been diligently researched by the Denton County Historical
Commission and preserved through oral histories and photographs of the community once
located near downtown Denton (Glaze 1991; deBurgos 1991). This brief summary documents
the timeline of the settlement, but the reader is encouraged to reference these sources for details
of the once thriving community. Established in 1875, twenty-seven black families from the
Dallas White Rock settlement moved into âFreedman Townâ northeast of the Denton County
Courthouse (Glaze 1991:3). Initially, the settlement was âmade up of log cabins and shacks set
among lots of treesâ (deBurgos 1991:8). The community was renamed Quakertown sometime
before 1880. The community continued to grow until 1922 and included churches, schools, shops
and many residences. Most of the residences were wood-frame houses with kitchen gardens
situated along dirt roads. âWater came from wells and plumbing was an outhouse and a No. 2
washtubâ (deBurgos 1991:9). The forced relocation of the residents was driven by a desire on the
______________________________________________________________________________________________

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY & MONITORING OF PECAN CREEK INTERCEPTOR II & III

6

part of white Denton residents to turn the area near Pecan Creek into a city park (deBurgos
1991:155-163). Oral histories and personal communications suggest a second reason for the
forced move: one that would separate the African-American community from its close proximity
of the Womanâs Industrial School just north of Withers Street. Once the residences were moved,
the city quickly leveled and graded the area, in preparation for converting it into a public park
(Glaze 1991:16). Additionally, the banks and the creek bed of Pecan Creek were cleared of brush
and sediments.
Previous Investigations
The Quakertown site (41DN481) was first recorded in 1990. During the excavation and
installation of utility lines, historic artifacts were discovered in ditches being excavated one to
two meters deep near the Senior Center Parking lot in Civic Center Park (Lebo 1990).
Excavations were halted until an archaeologist from the University of North Texas could
examine the material. In Area 1, there was a buried wall or cistern edge and possible remnants of
wooden barrels. Area 2 was identified as a midden area and contained bones, bottle glass
fragments, ceramic sherds, metal, architectural objects, and household items. Once the disturbed
artifacts were removed, they were curated at the Courthouse Museum. Intact material was left in
situ. After these excavations, Lebo suggested that the site may encompass several city blocks as
a historic neighborhood or district and was potentially eligible for listing on the NRHP.
The site was revisited in 1999 by archaeologists during preparation for a parking lot expansion at
the Senior Citizens Center northwest of the intersection of Bell Avenue and McKinney Street
(Kahl and Procter 1999). Grading to a depth of approximately 12 inches had started but was
stopped when artifacts were noted in the backfill. The graded area was examined to a depth of 24
inches (the extent of the project excavations) for historic artifacts. Two shovel tests were
excavated in the graded area to 20 inches below the graded surface. Historic artifacts uncovered
included various colored glass, whiteware with transfer prints, cut and wire nails, and various
other items such as a plumbing joint, coal, and paving material. These materials are consistent
with turn-of-the-century household items. Archaeologists from Wendy Lopez & Associates, Inc.
determined that the deposits containing the artifacts had been previously extensively disturbed
and recommended no further work at that location.
In 2003, city workers discovered a rock-lined well when they drove over it and loosened some of
the fill in Civic Center Park. The Denton County Historical Commission believed that the well
was most likely associated with the historic community of Quakertown and contracted with
Prewitt & Associates, Inc. (PAI) to conduct archaeological testing (Boyd 2005). The well is
located in the northwest corner of the park near the intersection of Withers and Oakland Street
(Figure 2). The top of the well was four feet below ground surface, while the bottom of the well
was estimated at 13.5 feet below surface. The four feet of soil above the top of the well shaft was
loose and represented fill possibly added during landscape modifications and surface leveling
that took place during the original park construction (Boyd 2005:3). Through testing, PAI was
able to identify artifacts typical of residential debris dating from 1890 to the early 1920s. A
sample of 38 artifacts was collected and curated at the Denton County Courthouse-on-the-Square
Museum. Additionally, archival research by PAI and Kim Cupit, curator of the Denton County
Courthouse Museum, identified George Sanders as the resident of the property in 1921 (Boyd

2005:16; Boyd et al. 2005:10). The investigations at the well serve as a reminder that not only
does the old Quakertown community lay beneath the active city park, but also that there is
potential for other intact archaeological remains in the area (Boyd 2005:22). In 2005, the site was
determined eligible for listing on the NRHP, but it has not been listed (TASA 2015). In 2011, the
site was designated at a State Antiquities Landmark (TASA 2015).

Historic Maps
A series of maps were georeferenced to show the alignment of the proposed pipeline route in
relation to the City of Denton and the historic community of Quakertown. This was done by
electronically overlaying the historic maps with current maps of the area using roads and parcel
boundaries as points of reference. It should be noted that the older maps were not created with as
precise detail as todayâs maps, so the routeâs location in relationship to the map features is
approximate.
The earliest map available that shows the Quakertown area at a useful scale, is the 1896 Sanborn
Map (Figure 3). Sheet 1 of the 1896 Sanborn Map does not show any detail of the Quakertown
community, but does detail the blocks to the south and west. Interestingly, when the map was
georeferenced with contemporary maps, Pecan Creek appears to be in a very different path than
on later maps. The creek is labeled as North and South Pecan Creek, and the Pecan Creek
Interceptor II & III routes appear to be between the two channels.
Figure 4 depicts the route on sheets 3 and 4 of the 1912 Sanborn Map. The image shows a
portion of the community of Quakertown with numerous residences and businesses between
Oakland and Bell avenues. Additionally, the map shows the Fred Douglass School on the
northwest corner of Holt Avenue and Terry Street. The school mysteriously burned down in
1913 and was rebuilt on a tract nearly a mile south of its original location (Glaze 1991:1). Pecan
Creek is shown in its former, meandering channel and the proposed pipeline route appears to
intersect the location of three structures: two houses between Oakland Avenue and Terry Street,
north of Holt Avenue (lots 8 and 13), and the Pleasant Grove Missionary Baptist Church on the
southwest corner of Holt Avenue and Terry Street. The remainder of the northern section of the
route travels through city property that was not mapped in detail on the 1912 Sanborn maps.
In the Assessorâs Abstract of City Lots a map dated 1916-1921 is the only historic map showing
the entirety of the boundaries of Quakertown before land was taken by the City of Denton
(Figure 5). The high potential area (northern portion) of the route goes through city blocks 212
and 213, and the low potential area (southern portion) parallels Pecan Creek to the southeast.

The route overlaid on the 1921 Sanborn Map (Figure 6) is very informative due to the efforts of
the Denton County Historical Commission who have identified each of the property ownersâ
names from the Tax Assessorâs records of City Lots (deBurgos 1991). The property boundaries
are the same as in the 1912 Sanborn maps, and the three locations for structures are the same,
these being the residences of Liney Stephenson at 610 Oakland Avenue and J E Nix at 615 Terry
Avenue, and the Pleasant Grove Baptist Church at 320 Holt Avenue. The route also travels close

to the previous location of the City of Dentonâs Street & Bridge Department Office near Bell
Avenue. Pleasant Grove Baptist Church was moved in 1923 to the Soloman Hill addition to join
the community of Quakertown residents after the City of Denton purchased the land on which
the church was located (deBurgos 1991:98).

By 1926, the area near downtown Denton is unrecognizable as Quakertown, and all of the
property bounded by Withers Avenue, Bell Avenue, East McKinney Street, and Oakland Avenue
are shown as City Park or City of Denton parcels (Figure 8). No mapped structures are within the
proposed alignment and only the Womenâs Club building is near the route (on its west end).

In the 1930s, a map of the city was made for the Tax Roll (Figure 9). The route is on a property
marked as âCity Parkâ and Pecan Creek was dammed up to create a lake at the confluence of the
two tributaries near Bell Avenue.

Eventually, the creek was channelized to help alleviate flood events in the city. A 1962
engineering drawing and profile of the channelization efforts shows that extensive amounts of
soil were removed along the creek banks. The cut and fill activities included removal of topsoil
along the drainage at a 1:2 or 1:3 slope to facilitate flow, and concrete was laid in the channel.
The top of the bank was graded to a 1:3 slope, and sodded (Figure 10). At cross section 3, the
profiles show that three to nine feet of soil were removed from the banks. It appears that
undisturbed native soils was cut down and then redeposited back from the edge of construction.
The review of these maps provides not only extensive information of the layout of Quakertown,
but also helps us understand how the land was used and developed over the last 120 years. The
majority of the route appears to avoid residential properties and the 1921 Sanborn map and Park
Site of Denton, Texas, ca. 1922 map show that portion of the route as City Park.

RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODOLOGY
Research Design
Archival research and the results from previous archaeological investigations demonstrate that a
portion of the proposed pipeline route travels through the historic location of the AfricanAmerican settlement known as Quakertown (41DN481) between Oakland and Bell avenues.
Despite the fact that the structures are no longer present and the community was razed in the
1920s prior to construction of Civic Center Park (Boyd 2005; Glaze 1991), there is potential for
deeply buried historic features such as wells, cisterns, foundation remnants, or privy pits within
the alignment. During the previous archaeological investigations within Civic Center Park, the
top of a well was recorded four feet below the surface under fill material (Boyd 2005:9), and
artifacts were recorded within the top two feet during grading for a new parking lot near the
southeast section of the park (Kahl and Procter 1999). An unknown amount of the park property
was built up by the spreading of fill from various sources over the original ground surface.
The results of the present archival and map research suggest that the southeastern portion of the
alignment does not cross historic locations of Quakertown residential properties. The 1960s
engineering drawings indicate that three to nine feet of soil along the creek edges were removed
during channelization. Finally, the 1930s Tax Roll map shows that Pecan Creek was dammed up
to create a lake during that period, and the earlier maps show that that section was a city park.
Therefore, it appears that the potential for intact historic features is only present in the northern
section of the alignment that crosses the historic parcels of the Baptist Church and two
residential properties.
It was hypothesized that the original ground surface at the northern end of the route in the
vicinity of the two residential properties is below a layer of fill that ranges up to two feet thick.
However, the majority of the route is situated just outside the Pecan Creek channel and should be
in native soil (Wilson clay loam). Artifacts that may be found in the residential propertiesâ fill
could date to the start of the 1900s, and truncated features may be encountered below the current
ground surface. Features are less likely to be encountered along the remainder of the route where
residences were not identified on the maps. This is particularly true for the old city park area
shown on the 1921 Sanborn and 1930s Tax Assessors Map.
Conversely, the potential for prehistoric sites or artifacts is considered low for several reasons.
This section of Pecan Creek is high in the watershed, and previous investigations in Denton
County have demonstrated that this type of environmental setting has low potential for
preserving buried prehistoric archaeology.
Survey Methodology
In order to test the hypotheses suggested from the results of the archival research, a pedestrian
survey (including shovel testing supplemented with augering) was conducted along the Pecan
Creek Interceptor II & III routes to determine if the soil was fill material or native matrix and to
identify sites, if present. Determining the soils within the alignment will serve to identify areas of
fill, or disturbance that could be related to features of Quakertown. The combined results of the
archival research and shovel testing will be used to formulate a probability model for the City to

identify the depth of fill that overlies the remains of Quakertown, and to identify the likelihood
of encountering intact, deeply buried features from Quakertown within the route.
The field teams walked the route, and made thorough field notes about ground exposure, soil
types, and disturbed areas. Shovel tests supplemented by augering were excavated at close
intervals (approximately 150 feet apart) to assess the depth of fill throughout the route and to
identify artifact concentrations. Shovel tests were placed in areas identified during archival
research as former structure locations. Each shovel test was excavated to the bottom of the
Holocene deposit according to THC standards (n.d). Shovel tests averaged 30 cm in diameter.
The clay fill from the shovel tests was inspected visually and broken into smaller chunks in order
to determine if cultural materials were present. Shovel test matrices were described on the basis
of texture and color. The Munsell Soil Color Chart (2009) was used to identify the specific soil
colors in each test. Shovel test locations were recorded using a handheld GPS receiver.
Photographs were taken with a digital camera.
Monitoring Methodology
The principal investigator monitored 93 m of the pipeline installation along the northern edge of
Pecan Creek. The main route (southeast-northwest) is a 36-in-diameter pipe that was placed in a
60-in-wide trench. The offshoot (from the main route to the northeast) is a 15-in-diameter pipe
that was placed in a 42-in-wide trench. A 20-m-long segment was bored in order to preserve an
old pecan tree. This bore required a trench box measuring 10 ft by 8 ft to be dug at each and of
the bore. The excavation of these trench boxes was monitored, but the bore (which was
completely through bedrock) was not monitored. During monitoring, the principal investigator
would watch the trench and backfill, looking for artifacts and features. When artifacts were
encountered, excavation slowed and diagnostic artifacts were collected from the trench and
backdirt as they were noticed. Non-diagnostic artifacts such as unmarked, clear and amber glass;
modern bottle styles, and undecorated whiteware were not collected, but were noted. The
locations of the start and stop of artifacts as well as their depths were recorded in trench profiles
and with a handheld GPS receiver. Photographs were taken with a 16-megapixel, GPS-equipped,
digital camera.

RESULTS
This chapter is separated into four sections. First, the terrain of the survey area is described. This
is followed by the results of the pedestrian survey and then the results of the construction
monitoring. Conclusions derived from the results end the chapter. Though shovel tests and
trenches are described generally within the text, detailed descriptions are found in Table 1 and
Table 2 in the Survey and Monitoring sections, respectively.
Project Area
The survey area consists of two sections of the pipeline routes totaling approximately 4800 feet
in length. The first section runs between Bell Avenue and Oakland Street, and is situated entirely
within Civic Center Park. This section was identified as having high potential for historic
resources since it overlays the historic Quakertown community. The route passes through the
mowed and manicured grounds of the city park, which is dotted with juniper, elm, and oak trees
(Figure 11). This resulted in less than 20 percent ground visibility. Terrain within the park is
relatively level, although the topography slopes toward the concrete-lined Pecan Creek channel.
This is particularly the case along the southern half of this portion of the route (Figure 12). Based
on the electrical boxes, drains, and manholes visible within the park boundaries, several
electrical, sewer, and sprinkler lines run through the park.
The second section runs roughly parallel to the north side of McKinney Avenue to the southeast
and was determined to have low potential for historic or prehistoric material. The THC
concurred with this determination in the survey scope of work dated January 11, 2011. This
second section runs very close to the edge of Pecan Creek, and archival research shows no
structures along that creek edge. Both pipeline routes parallel a channelized, concrete-lined
portion of Pecan Creek.

The Pecan Creek channel averages 10 feet deep and 30 feet wide. The southern portion of the
route was in a wooded area immediately north of Pecan Creek and near the intersection of Frame
Street and McKinney Avenue. Although the areas on either side of Frame Street were mowed,
the majority of this line ran through dense vegetation consisting primarily of oaks, junipers, and
pecans (Figure 13).

Survey Results
Survey began in Civic Center Park, and the line was surveyed from northwest to southeast.
Shovel tests (STs) were placed at intervals of approximately 150 feet throughout the alignment
(Figure 14). Additional shovel tests were placed at a 50-foot interval in areas where
georeferenced historic maps indicated structures once stood. These locations included the Marion
Mays and J. E. Nix/W. C. Bell residences along Terry Avenue, which were investigated by
ST01-04, and the Pleasant Grove Baptist Church and Rachel Ellis residence, which were
investigated by ST06-09.

Figure 14.

The 2015 Pecan Creek Interceptor III route and 2011 shovel test locations plotted
on a recent aerial photograph.

ST01-03 were excavated on the higher elevations of the park more distant from the channel.
ST01 was excavated approximately 50 feet from the northern end of the pipeline route. This
distance was necessary to avoid a sewer manhole and an electrical corridor. This shovel test
encountered a stratified soil profile which was similar to that exposed by the two following
shovel tests (Table 1). The profile in ST01 included a 27-cm-thick layer of dark brown clay
sandy loam topsoil with crushed rock throughout. Within this layer, one whiteware fragment, one

heavily corroded 4â by 0.25â wire nail, and a PVC pipe fragment were recovered. Underlying
this topsoil was a layer of brown sandy loamy clay to a depth of 45 cm underlain by grayish
brown sandy loamy clay to a depth of 110 cm. Both contained deposits of small, subangular
gravels. This was underlain by yellowish brown sandy clay subsoil, which was mottled with
grayish brown and strong brown sandy loamy clay, and contained pea to golf ball-sized pieces of
eroding limestone bedrock. The bedrock had a yellowish color, which is consistent with the
geological description of the underlying Grayson Marl, which weathers to grayish yellow
(Bureau of Economic Geology 1991). Although this same general profile was encountered in the
two subsequent tests, some differences were observed. In shovel test 02, the yellowish brown
subsoil was encountered at 35cm below the surface. In shovel test 03, brown clay sandy loam
underlay the topsoil at a depth of 70cm, and the subsoil could not be reached before the test was
terminated at a depth of 117cm due to the density of impenetrable eroding bedrock in the bottom
of the test unit. Both shovel tests 02 and 03 were negative for cultural resources.
The matrix in shovel tests 01 through 03 were compared with the stratigraphy encountered
during excavation of the Quakertown well (a feature of site 41DN481) located to the northwest
of the pipeline route. The topsoil above the well was described as consisting of two feet of
mottled brown, dark grayish brown and very dark grayish brown clay loam, which he refers to as
artificial topsoil (Boyd 2005: Table 1). This topsoil compares favorably with the stratified dark
brown, brown and grayish brown clay sandy loams seen overlaying the yellowish subsoil in tests
01 through 03. However, Boyd identified his second zone (from two to four feet below the
surface) as light olive brown (2.5Y5/4) clay. This compares less favorably to the mottled
yellowish brown sandy clay identified in our shovel tests, though the difference in hue between
olive brown and yellowish brown (10YR5/6) is not drastic. Boyd identified this second stratum
as an artificial fill, which would explain the difference in hue between the stratigraphy at the well
and that encountered during shovel testing in the current study area.
Shovel tests 04 through 11, which were excavated primarily adjacent to the channel, encountered
fairly consistent soil profiles, although they likewise exhibited several variations. In each of
these shovel tests, a topsoil consisting of very dark gray sandy loamy clay or sandy clay loam
was encountered to depths of between 50 and 75 cm. The topsoil was underlain by a variety of
sandy loamy clays and sandy clay loams. These ranged in color between brown, dark brown and
very dark brown and were encountered to depths of between 75 and 150 cm.
The most striking variation exhibited in these shovel tests was the disparate subsoil types
encountered below the sandy clay loams (Figure 14). In shovel tests 05 and 06 yellowish brown
sandy clay subsoil with eroding limestone bedrock identical to that seen in tests 01 and 02 was
encountered at depths of 105 and 130 cm respectively. In shovel test 08, black clay with 5 to 10
percent pea gravel was encountered at 98cm, though it is unclear whether this constitutes a
subsoil, or if it is the result of staining from a privy pit or some other cultural feature. In shovel
tests 10 and 11, which were excavated in a low-lying area adjacent to the creek channel,
approximately 15cm of pale brown silt with abundant snail shells was encountered between 75
and 90 cm in depth. Given the location of these tests in the channel margin, this may represent a
flooding event or result from the fact that this portion of the creek featured an on channel lake as
seen in the 1930s Tax Assessor map. Very dark grayish brown silty clay underlay the silt in each
shovel test.

Soil profiles encountered during shovel testing.

Of these eight shovel tests, five were positive for cultural material. Shovel test 05 contained a
clear glass bottleneck fragment and a .22 cartridge, 06 contained a 4â by 0.25â corroded wire
nail, 07 contained a corroded barbed wire barb, 08 contained the corner of a red clay brick, and
11 contained a heavily corroded piece of indeterminate metal in sheet form. These artifacts were
all located within the top 20 to 30cm of the shovel tests, with the exception of the metal in shovel
test 11, which was found between 50 and 75cm.
Shovel test 12 was excavated at the southern end of the line, and encountered two layers of fill;
65cm of dark brown clay sandy loam overlaying 35cm of brown sandy loamy clay. Both layers
contained substantial amounts of crushed limestone rock. No cultural resources were observed in
this shovel test, and this is most likely due to the terminus of the route being situated atop an
earthen berm which has been built up for the Bell Street bridge over Pecan Creek.
This final shovel test and some of the others excavated on the southern section of the line may be
favorably compared with shovel testing performed during the 1999 41DN481 site revisit done
prior to expansion of the Senior Citizen Center parking lot, which is to the northeast of the
pipeline route (Kahl and Proctor 1999). Two shovel tests were excavated in the graded parking
lot expansion area. The first encountered 14cm of dark grayish brown dry silty clay, which
overlay very dark grayish brown silty sandy clay, which had mottles of light yellowish brown, to
a depth of 29cm. The third stratum consisted of very dark gray sticky silty clay to a depth of
51cm, at which point the test was discontinued because it had reached the depth of proposed
impact (18-24â). This result may be best compared with shovel tests 10 and 11, which
encountered abundant silty clays. The second shovel test conducted for the impact assessment
encountered 20cm of fill which was given no Munsell value, brown to dark brown dry silty loam
with abundant sandstone cobbles, and a third stratum of brown to dark brown dry silty loam to a

depth of 50cm. This stratum compares favorably with shovel test 12, which encountered a more
substantial fill deposit adjacent to Bell Avenue. Artifacts were recorded in a higher density
during the Lopez Garcia investigations, and this area further upslope from the present study area
is consistent with the City Park building location shown on the 1921 Sanborn map. As discussed
in the archival research section, very few structures were plotted in the park area away from the
thinly populated channel margin, most likely due to the frequent flood events experienced in this
portion of the channel.

Survey Conclusions
The study area is mapped on the SCS soil maps within the Wilson-Urban land complex, the soil
profile of which was detailed in the Natural Environment chapter. However, shovel testing
revealed that the soil profile throughout the park does not precisely match that described by the
SCS. Shovel tests 04 through 11 encountered a soil profile consisting primarily of sandy loamy
______________________________________________________________________________________________

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY & MONITORING OF PECAN CREEK INTERCEPTOR II & III

26

clays ranging in color from very dark gray to brown. This roughly matches the Wilson-Urban
land complex, though largely without the corresponding horizon depths, and without the
yellowish brown mottles in the lower depths of the test units. However, shovel tests 01 through
03 encountered a soil profile which may be more accurately attributed to the Sanger-Urban land
complex (Ford and Pauls 1980: Sheet 21). The Sanger-Urban soil is mapped both to the
immediate northeast of the study area, and further upstream in the channel of Pecan Creek. This
soil features a 76cm top layer of grayish brown clay, over light yellowish brown silty clay with
yellowish mottles to a depth of 139cm, and light yellowish brown silty clay with light gray and
very pale brown mottles below that. Although shovel test 01 through 03 do not match this
stratigraphy exactly, it is likely that this is attributable to the fact that, if the Sanger-Urban land
complex is present in the study area, the pipeline presumably crosses the mixed and indefinite
boundary between the two soil types. This would explain the presence of yellowish brown sandy
clay in the lower portion of shovel tests 05 and 06, which is consistent with the Sanger-Urban
land complex being subsumed by the Wilson-Urban (Figure 17).
In a broader sense, the inconsistency between the profiles of the mapped soil types and those
identified by shovel testing can be attributed to a number of factors. The first is the significant
cut and fill events that have disturbed the natural soil profile within the park, and in particular
near the channel. As seen in the engineering drawings in Figures 8 through 10, the channel of
Pecan Creek has been heavily reworked to alleviate flood events. This included the removal of a
significant amount of sediment from within the channel, which was then presumably used to
build up and stabilize the banks, and build up the surface of the park. This would have resulted in
an unnatural profile featuring channel sediments atop the native topsoil in the area. Additionally,
cut events, particularly grading along the channel to help facilitate flow, would have truncated
the natural soil profile, and can explain the fluctuating depth of topsoil along the proposed
pipeline route. Alluvial flood events may also have played a part in the anomalous soil profiles
encountered near the channel, such as those seen in shovel tests 10 and 11 which included
discrete layers of silt overlaying silty clay. Alluvial events would also explain the presence of
water-rolled pea gravel and granular gravel encountered in the lower depths of many of the
shovel tests, which would have washed into the area along with floodplain sediments. The
presence of crushed rock in the top layers of many of the shovel tests is consistent with the
intrusion of fill material into the topsoil that was used in the construction of nearby parking lots,
buildings, and adjacent roadways.
The historic maps reviewed prior to fieldwork showed that the pipeline route runs through some
areas that were occupied by numerous landowners during the height of the Quakertown
settlement. However, shovel testing failed to locate any cultural materials that could be
conclusively dated to the late 19th or early 20th century. Shovel tests 01 through 04 were
excavated on the northern portion of the pipeline route, which runs between areas identified on
the 1912 and 1921 Sanborn maps as the location of the Marion Mays and J. E. Nix residences
(Figures 2 and 4). The only positive shovel test of these four was shovel test 01, which contained
only non-diagnostic artifacts including a fragment of PVC pipe. Shovel tests 07 through 09 were
excavated on a portion of the pipeline route which runs between the Pleasant Grove Baptist
Church on the west side and the Rachel Ellis residence on the east (Figure 4). Although a higher
percentage of these shovel tests were positive, with a barbed wire barb and a brick corner
fragment found in shovel tests 07 and 08 respectively, the artifacts were likewise non-diagnostic,

and impossible to attribute to a specific time period. The small amount of artifacts recorded is
attributed to several factors, first much of the route is adjacent to the channel, and goes through
back yards or behind mapped structure locations. Pleasant Grove Baptist Church was relocated,
not razed, and if the houses were moved as well, there would be little trash scatter associated
with a residence left on the surface.
Since the pipeline route does not cross directly over any mapped structures, but runs primarily
through back yards or parallel to mapped structure locations, it is likely that the only structural
features which may be encountered would be buried features such as wells, cisterns, or privy
pits. The City of Denton purchased Denton Water & Light Company on June 10, 1905 (Bates
1976:265 [1918]). In 1908, a Typhoid fever outbreak occurred in the city, and efforts were
begun by the city to build a sanitary sewer system (Robyn Lee, personal correspondence 2011).
Since much of Quakertown was built and developed by 1912, we suggest that much of the
community before 1905 would have had other water sources such as wells or cisterns, and that
more than one residence would have had them. Yet since these features are relatively small and
may be located as deep as four feet below the surface, it is quite possible that they would not be
located by shovel testing or scraping the top two feet of topsoil. Accordingly, monitoring of the
pipeline route near the mapped locations of the Mays and Nix residences and between the
Pleasant Grove Baptist Church and the Ellis residence is deemed necessary to search for buried
cultural features.
Monitoring Results
Southern Segment
In total, 102 m of trench excavation was monitored. Additionally, the excavation of two 10 ft by
8 ft trench boxes (one on each end of the bore) and a 3.75-m-diameter hole for a temporary
manhole were monitored (Figure 16). The profiles revealed in the 2011 shovel testing and
southern trench box (which was dug first) reveal a thick deposit (up to 1.4 m thick) of dark clay
loam, recent fill above the natural A horizon. At the southern trench box, this upper layer is
underlain by 70 cm of very dark grayish brown sandy clay loam of the natural A horizon (Table
2). This in turn sits atop the yellowish brown sandy clay B horizon which has increasing
limestone rock until the bedrock is encountered at three meters below the surface. Southeast of
this location, the upper, recent deposit above the A horizon thins out and the ground surface
elevation decreases, but the bedrock is at approximately the same depth, leaving thicker A and B
horizons.
During monitoring, artifacts were found in three general locations. Construction started near Bell
Street at the southeast end of the park (Figure 16). Artifacts were first recovered approximately
75 m northeast of Bell Street. This area was outside of the originally planned monitoring area
and approximately 15 m were excavated before the monitor arrived. However, the crew had been
collecting whole bottles and other items of interest to show the monitor. After further excavation
with monitoring, a 16-m-long lens of rusty sediment and artifacts was identified in the northeast
wall of the trench (Figure 17 and Figure 18). Some glass and lots of metal (including a cart or
wagon axel) were visible in the profile, but were left in place. The lens was not in the southwest
wall profile. The artifacts from this lens were cataloged as coming from Provenience 1 (prior to
the monitorâs arrival, when depth cannot be guaranteed to correlate with the lens) and
Provenience 2 (after the monitorâs arrival, when depth was carefully observed).

The following artifacts were collected from proveniences 1 and 2: 39 whole bottles (29 clear,
seven aqua, and three amber) (Figure 19), two neck/finish fragments (one clear, and one aqua),
an aqua bottle base, a milk glass canning jar lid, a clear glass circular lid, a clear glass syringe
(Figure 20), a piece of window glass, a commercial brick fragment, a small ceramic pitcher
(Figure 21), a crockery fragment, a metal cooking pot, an enamel-coated bowl or pot, a
horseshoe, three corroded metal objects, a scoop conveyor chain (Figure 22), and an arch support
(Figure 23). Four large concrete and metal boxes without doors were also found, but were not
collected.
The bottles include those for tonics and medicines (including Groveâs Tasteless Chill Tonic,
citrate of magnesia, Parke Davis and Co. pharmaceutical company, Rubifoam for the teeth, and
unmarked graduate bottles), food (pickles, olives, Curtis Brothers ketchup, Lea & Perrins
Worcestershire), beverages (Jersey CrÃ¨me Soda, Hayner Distilling company whiskey, and Uncle
Jo soda), ink (Sanfordâs Ink), and cleaning lubricant and protectant (Three-In-One Oil Co.). At
least seven bottles have hand-tooled necks indicating they were likely manufactured in the
1880s-1920s (Lindsey 2015d). Many of the bottles were able to be dated to the limited lifespans
of the manufacturer or product (see Appendix A for details on individual artifacts). The amber
snuff bottle dates to the early 20th-century (Lindsey 2015g). Most of these dates indicate the
bottles were produced between the 1880s and the 1930s.
In general, aqua glass became less common after the 1920s (Lindsey 2012b). Milk glass canning
jar lids were used for almost 90 years between 1869 and the late 1950s (Whitten 2015b). Glass
syringes were in use from 1866 to 1956, however few injectable drugs were available prior to
the 1920s (Science Museum 2015). The window glass is 2.65 mm thick. Moirâs model (1988)
was used for identifying and dating the window pane glass recovered from the site. This model is
ideally used with a mean thickness of several pieces of glass, but only one was recovered from
provinces 1 and 2. Therefore, the results should be considered tentative. According to Moirâs
model, the 2.65-mm-thick piece of window glass likely dates later than 1920. Though the
transition took years, handmade bricks were generally replaced with commercial ones around
1900 (Steinbomer 1982). The Foot-eazer arch support is a product patented by Dr. Schollâs in
1905 and consists of two metal plates fastened together that could be molded for individual
comfort.
The four concrete-lined, metal-plated boxes are likely safes or some other type of strong box
(Figure 24) (Early Office Museum 2014). None have intact doors and no doors were found
during excavation. The exterior is covered in sheet metal and the inside walls are concrete. The
boxes were measured and documented in detail (Table 3). The smallest (Box 3) measures 31 in
by 29 in by 25 in and the largest (Box 1) measures 30 in by 22 in by 21 in. The door frames are
stepped and each safe varies in the number of steps. Some of the inside edges of the frames have
holes (Boxes 2-3) or slits (Box 1) presumably for securing the door closed (Figure 25). The
boxes are heavily corroded and some have holes through the concrete layer (Figure 24, Figure
25, and Figure 26). The smallest (Box 1) had a metal ring 4-3/8 in in diameter attached to one of
the outer straps (Figure 26). Some of the metal on Box 3 has been removed and the concrete
chipped so as to thread a metal loop through a corner (Figure 26). No markings or designs were
visible on in the interior or exterior of the boxes.

Three of the boxes were generally empty and were swept out in order to determine the interior
structure. A clear glass body shard, a fragment of red amethyst textured cathedral stained glass,
rusted can fragments, and wire nail fragments were found in Box 4. Box 3 was completely filled
with sediment and broken artifacts similar to those that were seen in the fill of proveniences 1
and 2, where the boxes were found. This sediment was removed and possibly diagnostic artifacts
were collected. This assemblage includes 15 window glass shards varying from 1.92 to 3.52 mm
and average 2.76 mm, seven glass body shards (one amber, three sun-colored amethyst [SCA],
and three clear). A crockery fragment, two whiteware sherds, three porcelain sherds, four semiporcelain sherds, and six unidentifiable rusted metal fragments. According to Moirâs model, the
glass likely dates after 1920, but a few pieces could be from as early as 1880 (1988). SCA glass
was commonly used until the end of World War I, when clear glass became the dominant glass
type for vessels and containers (Lindsey 2015e).

About 2-3 m northwest of the end of the rust lens there is a shift in the topsoil and subsoil colors
and the topsoil becomes much thicker (Figure 28). Approximately five m northwest of the rust
lens, more artifacts appeared in the trench. Excavation slowed and ultimately revealed a 60-cmwide and 20-cm-thick pocket of artifacts on the southwest wall of the trench approximately one
meter below the surface (Figure 29 and Table 2). It was not visible in the northwest wall. The
following artifacts were collected from the pocket: a clear glass jar, two milk glass shards, an
SCA shard, a clear bottle with a tooled finish, a crockery rim with a blue pained line, three white
ware sherds, an aqua glass insulator, a piece of coal, a leather shoe heel, a commercial brick
fragment, and a handmade brick fragment.
The handmade brick fragment, aqua glass, tooled finish, and SCA glass indicate these artifacts
are from the late 1800s to the early 1900s. The clear jar is embossed with âSwift &
Company/USA/PAT FEB 10 03â on the bottom. Swift & Company was a meat packer who sold
bacon in jars of this style. The only evidence that could be found for this was a series of
advertisements ca. 1910s (Figure 30) (Swift & Company 1910a, 1910b, 1910c, 1911a, 1911b,
1912). Few of the artifacts from Provenience 3 provide specific date ranges. The tooled finish on
one bottle indicated it was manufactured 1870s-1920s.
After the Provenience 3 pocket, excavation of the trench continued for 16 m, revealing no
artifacts or features (Figure 16). Then abruptly there were abundant artifacts coming from the
trench. Excavation slowed and revealed a 40-cm-thick deposit of metal, brick, glass, and ceramic
artifacts with a mottled clay matrix (Table 2). Each backhoe scoop was spread out on the ground
adjacent to the trench and probable diagnostic artifacts (bottle necks/finishes and bases, whole
vessels, glass and ceramics with patterns or other markings, personal items, etc.) were collected,
while the matrix and non-diagnostic artifacts (such as clear and brown glass fragments, metal
scraps, and whiteware body sherds) were used as fill on top of the newly installed sewer pipe.
Artifacts from the first five horizontal meters were collected together as Provenience 4. Each
subsequent segment of excavation (averaging about two-m-long each) was collected as a
separate provenience (5-7), but they all (proveniences 4-7) constitute one archaeological feature
(Figure 27). The concentration of artifacts was most dense in the first segment (Provenience 4)
and sparser in each subsequent segment. Approximately four meters before the south trench box,
artifacts were no longer coming out of the trench.
Artifacts collected from these proveniences are summarized below:
Provenience 4: Seven complete bottles (five clear, one aqua, one Coca-Cola), nine bottle
finishes (one SCA, one deep blue-green, one amber, and three clear), seven bottle bases
(one olive, one amber [snuff], two milk, and three clear), a clear glass gallon jug base and
finish, three SCA shards, two corrugated plate glass fragments, three clear glass bacon
jars, a fragmented crockery jug, a fragmented crockery vessel with lug handle, two
crockery fragments, 21 whiteware fragments, two porcelain fragments, a sledgehammer
head, a mussel shell, five cow bone fragments (three medial rib fragments, 1 vertebra
fragment, and the cut distal end of a humerous), a hinge, twelve commercial brick
fragments (one nearly whole, eight approximately half fragments, and three small
fragments), two horseshoes, a pencil (Figure 31), a leather shoe heel

The functions of the bottles from Proveniences 4-7 are similar to those collected from
Proveniences 1 and 2, and several have makerâs marks to help identify them. These include two
E. R. Durkee bottles that were used for a salad dressing between 1900 and 1929 (Lockhart et al.
2015), a Radwayâs Relief bottle dating between 1847-1928 (Griffenhagen and Bogard 1999), a
Lyric prescription bottle from 1915-1929 (Odell 2007), a 3-In-One bicycle oil bottle from 19051935 (Munsey 2006; WD-40 2015), a Coke bottle from 1923-1937 (Lockhart and Porter 2010),
an Illinois Glass Company bottle from 1915-1929 (Whitten 2015d), an Owens Bottle Company
bottle from 1919-1929 (Lockhart et al. 2010), a diamond glass company bottle from 1924ca.1940 (Whitten 2015c), and a Sheldon Foster Glass Company bottle from 1900-1907 (Bottle
Research Group 2015). Milk glass was commonly used in cosmetic bottles like the one found in
Provenience 6 from the 1890s to the mid-twentieth century (Lindsey 2015e).
The crown makerâs mark was used by the A. J. Wilkinson Pottery in Burslem, England after
1930 (Birks 2006). The lion on the porcelain plate base resembles that used as a makerâs mark by
Theodore Lehmann of Arzburg, Bavaria 1898-1904 (PorzellanKompass 2015). One of the
window glass fragments is 2.5 mm thick. Three pieces of glass refit together, are 7.4 mm thick,
have beveled edges, and are etched with âManufactuâ¦ted/AMERICAN WALâ¦M
W/WALTHAM, MASSâ on the backside (Figure 35). This would have belonged to the
American Waltham Watch Company of Waltham, Massachusetts, likely part of a display case.
Based on changes in the company name, this pane dates between 1859 and 1906 (Stuart 2014).
The final pieces of window glass are the same thickness and also has a beveled edge. It could not
be refit with the three Waltham pieces, but like came from the same pane.
The profile of the northern trench box revealed 50 cmbs of very dark gray clay loam that
gradually changes to black until 1.9 cmbs, where the yellowish brown clay B horizon is reached
(Table 2). Bedrock was encountered at 370 cmbs. The trench was monitored for another five m
north and the profile remained relatively constant with a slightly thicker upper level (Table 2).
No artifacts or features were found in the north trench box or the trench that extended north from
it.

Northern Segment and Temporary Manhole Location
Monitoring began at the southwest end of the northern segment. The natural ground surface
along this segment rises as the segment proceeds towards an existing manhole 38 m to the
northeast. The southwestern segment excavation revealed commercial brick and concrete rubble
(broken to chunks no larger than half of a standard brick) in a matrix of grayish brown and dark
gray mottled clay loam. This layer sits on top of a thin, sloped, dark black layer which is
underlain by rocks (Figure 36). Approximately 6.5 meters from the southwest end, the sediments
change abruptly a profile of 100 cm of dark grayish brown clay loam above mottled yellowish
brown and dark gray mottled clay. This more natural profile extends all the way to the existing
manhole with a gradual shift in the mottles subsoil to homogenous strong brown clay. It is
possible that this sloped soil boundary represents part of the old Pecan Creek channel from
before it was channelized in 1962. The current concrete channel is 10 m from this location. The
extensive rubble was likely brought in to raise the ground surface to make more level surface
area in the park. The cut made to install the old manhole is clear in the trench profile and is filled
with a mixture of the two soils (Table 2). No artifacts were found in the northern trench besides
the heavily broken brick and concrete rubble.
A temporary manhole was constructed 15 m northwest of the trenchâs end. A 3.75-m-diameter
hole was dug down to 2.8 m where the existing sewer line is located. This revealed 80 cm of
very dark grayish brown clay loam above 70 cm of dark grayish brown clay loam that is
underlain by brown and strong brown mottled clay (Table 2). No artifacts were found during the
excavation of this hole.

Three concentrations of artifacts were identified during the installation of the Pecan Creek
Interceptor III sewer line. Each of these likely represents a trash dump near the edge of Pecan
Creek before it was channelized in 1962. Maps from 1896 to 1922 show this area as an open plot
behind the structures on the south side of Holt Street with Pecan Creek meandering through it.
Historically, people would use areas like this for trash dumps.
No features (wells, foundations, etc.) were identified and the artifacts were clearly muddled with
various sediments. Many of the artifacts (especially the ceramics) had old breaks when they were
excavated, indicating they were thrown away historically. The few whole artifacts were mostly
bottles without lids or stoppers. The type of refuse is indicative of residential waste, consisting
mostly of medicinal, food, and beverage bottles, and personal items. The majority of the
collected artifacts have manufacture dates from 1880-1930, tightly correlating to the time of
Quakertown (1875-1922). However, many of these items may have been used years and even
decades after their manufacture or patent dates. Additionally, many of the artifacts not selected
for collection (e.g. modern clear and amber bottles, undecorated white ware ceramics,
indistinctive crockery) have date ranges that extend to the mid-1900s or even the present day.

Therefore, this dump was likely in use during the time of Quakertown as well as the following
decades when the land was designated as a city park.
ARC concludes that the artifacts encountered during the installation of the Pecan Creek
Interceptor III sewer line are part of site 41DN481 (Historic Quakertown), but came from a
heavily disturbed dump context. This dump was likely deposited over several decades from the
late 1800s through the early 1900s. No structures or intact features other than the dump were
encountered. Though the refuse and dump feature are part of the NRHP-eligible Quakertown
site, they provide only an overarching understanding of the general household waste produced by
the residents of Quakertown and do not contribute significantly to the understanding of the early1900s community.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The portion of 41DN481 that was impacted by the Pecan Creek Interceptor III sewer line was a
dump from a broad time period (likely more than 50 years). Though the dump is likely related to
Quakertown, no significant new knowledge could be gained from the out-of-context artifacts.
However, many unknown features may still exist subsurface, as evidenced by the discovery of
the historic well in 2003 (Boyd 2005) and ARC recommends that site 41DN481 is still eligible
for listing on the NRHP. Therefore, any future ground disturbance in the vicinity of Quakertown
should be monitored. ARC requests that the THC concur with these conclusions and
recommendations.

Lindsey 2015c

Likely pre-1920
1905-1935 used for 3-In-One Oil Co.'s Three In
One bicycle oil used to "clean, lubricate, and
protect." The company changed hands several
times, and in 1936 the oil was merchandised in a
tin can, which is why I think the glass bottle was
phased out at that time. The company is now
owned by WD-40.

after Food and Drug Act forced them to remove
"cure" from the bottles. Older bottles feature an
embossed kidney on the front panel, so this is an
even later version because it lacks that feature.
