Abstract
At the request of Luminant, Atkins conducted a cultural resources survey of the proposed
3,865.94-acre Liberty Deposit Mine Area in Rusk County, Texas. Approximately 324.2 acres within
the mine area, consisting of mostly home lots and small tracts (1243, 1244, 1245, 1246, 1266, 1319,
1320, 1321, 1323, 1324, 1327, 591, 1353, 1354, 1369, 1371, and 1372), were not surveyed, at the
request of the landowners. These investigations were conducted on privately owned land in
accordance with a research design approved by the Texas Historical Commission in 2010.

Portions of the proposed 3,865.94-acre Liberty Deposit Mine Area were included in a previous
survey conducted in 1972, prior to the impoundment of Martin Lake Reservoir. That survey
recorded 8 sites (41RK12, 41RK13, 41RK14, 41RK16, 41RK26, 41RK27, 41RK29, and 41RK34)
within the limits of the Liberty Deposit Mine Area. During the present investigation, 53 sites within
the present limits of the permit boundary were evaluated, including the 8 previously recorded sites.
Eight isolated finds, which are not considered archeological sites, were also located. During the
course of the survey, minor adjustments were made to the permit area boundaries. Consequently, 6
additional sites (41RK32, 41RK35, 41RK187, 41RK613, 41RK629, and 41RK655) were evaluated
but have since been excluded from the permit area. Due to the proximity of these resources to the
current permit boundary, they are described in the results section of the text.
Of the 59 sites evaluated during the present investigations, 38 (41RK12, 41RK34, 41RK609,
41RK610, 41RK611, 41RK612, 41RK617, 41RK618, 41RK619, 41RK620, 41RK624, 41RK625,
41RK626, 41RK627, 41RK628, 41RK630, 41RK632, 41RK633, 41RK635, 41RK636, 41RK637,
41RK638, 41RK639, 41RK640, 41RK641, 41RK642, 41RK643, 41RK644, 41RK647, 41RK648,
41RK649, 41RK650, 41RK651, 41RK653, 41RK654, 41RK656, 41RK662, and 41RK664) have
historic components, 17 (41RK13, 41RK14, 41RK16, 41RK26, 41RK27, 41RK29, 41RK32, 41RK187,
41RK614, 41RK615, 41RK616, 41RK621, 41RK623, 41RK629, 41RK646, 41RK652, and 41RK655)
have prehistoric components, and 4 (41RK35, 41RK613, 41RK631, and 41RK663) have both
historic and prehistoric components.

All 38 sites with historic components (41RK12, 41RK34, 41RK609, 41RK610, 41RK611, 41RK612,
41RK617, 41RK618, 41RK619, 41RK620, 41RK624, 41RK625, 41RK626, 41RK627, 41RK628,
41RK630, 41RK632, 41RK633, 41RK635, 41RK636, 41RK637, 41RK638, 41RK639, 41RK640,
41RK641, 41RK642, 41RK643, 41RK644, 41RK647, 41RK648, 41RK649, 41RK650, 41RK651,
41RK653, 41RK654, 41RK656, 41RK662, and 41RK664) are thought to be ineligible for National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) inclusion, and no further work is recommended.

Of the 17 prehistoric sites evaluated, 14 (41RK13, 41RK14, 41RK16, 41RK26, 41RK27, 41RK29,
41RK614, 41RK615, 41RK616, 41RK621, 41RK623, 41RK646, 41RK652, and 41RK655) are thought
to lack sufficient data resources to warrant NRHP inclusion, and no further work is recommended.

Abstract
The NRHP eligibility status of the remaining 3 prehistoric sites (41RK32, 41RK187, and 41RK629)
remains undetermined. It is recommended that mine-related impact to these sites be avoided. If
this is not possible, NRHP eligibility testing is recommended.

The historic and prehistoric components at sites 41RK613, 41RK631, and 41RK663 appear to lack
the data resources warranting NRHP inclusion, and no further work is recommended. The NRHP
eligibility status of the prehistoric component at site 41RK35 remains unknown, while the historic
component appears to lack the data resources warranting NRHP inclusion. It is recommended that
mine-related impact to the prehistoric component at site 41RK35 be avoided. Site 41RK35 has been
excluded from the limits of the current permit area, and mine-related impacts are not anticipated.

Project historians recorded 18 locations containing 27 historic-age nonarcheological resources
within the Liberty Deposit Mine Area boundaries. Each of these resources (excepting those located
on properties with restricted access) was shovel tested to determine if subsurface deposits were
present. Typically, this entailed the excavation of eight shovel tests in a cruciform pattern around
each standing structure. Historic standing structures HS18A and HS18B have been excluded from
the permit area by the boundary adjustment.

None of the nonarcheological standing structures appears to possess sufficient integrity or historic
significance to merit inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion A, B, C, or D. Therefore, no further
consideration of these resources is recommended under any applicable regulatory criteria.

INTRODUCTION
At the request of Luminant, Atkins North America, Inc. (Atkins) conducted a cultural resources
survey of the proposed 3,865.94-acre Liberty Deposit Mine Area in Rusk County, Texas (Figure 1),
between March 2010 and November 2011. Approximately 324.2 acres within the mine area,
consisting mostly of home lots and small tracts (1243, 1244, 1245, 1246, 1266, 1319, 1320, 1321,
1323, 1324, 1327, 591, 1353 1354, 1369, 1371, and 1372), were not surveyed during the initial
field effort at the request of the landowners. It is recommended that these areas be surveyed prior
to any mine-related impact. These investigations were conducted entirely on privately owned land
in accordance with a research design (Sherman 2010) approved by the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) in 2010.

Approximately 492 acres of the Liberty Deposit Mine Area were included in a previous survey
conducted by the Texas Archeological Salvage Project in 1972 prior to the impoundment of Martin
Lake Reservoir (McDonald 1972). About 396 acres of the proposed permit area exist within the
Martin Lake regular or maximum pool area. These areas were either inundated during the time of
the survey or are subject to periodic inundation and consequently were not shovel tested.
Approximately 25 acres of the project area consisted of man-made ponds and stock tanks.

This survey was undertaken in accordance with the Procedures of the Advisory Council on Historic
Preservation (36 CFR 800); in compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (PL
89-665), as amended; the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL 91-190, 83 Stat. 915, 41
USC 4231, 1970); the Office of Surface Mining Regulations, as superseded by the Coal Mining
Regulations of the Texas Railroad Commission, January 1, 1981; and other appropriate cultural
resources legislation guidelines, as well as the guidelines set forth by the Council of Texas
Archeologists.

The 1972 survey recorded eight sites (41RK12, 41RK13, 41RK14, 41RK16, 41RK26, 41RK27,
41RK29, and 41RK34) within the limits of the Liberty Deposit Mine Area (McDonald 1972).

The permit area boundaries were adjusted during the course of the survey. Consequently, six
additional sites (41RK32, 41RK35, 41RK187, 41RK613, 41RK629, and 41RK655) that were shovel
tested and evaluated during the field survey have since been excluded from the permit area. Sites
41RK32 and 41RK35 were recorded during the Martin Lake Reservoir survey (McDonald 1972).
Site 41RK187 was recorded by Jack Hughes during a 1940 visit to the project area. The remaining
three sites were discovered during the course of the present survey.

1. Introduction
During the present investigation, 59 sites were evaluated, including the 10 previously recorded
sites, within or immediately adjacent to the currently proposed Liberty Deposit Mine Area. Of these
sites, 38 have historic components, while 17 have prehistoric components, and 4 have both
prehistoric and historic components. Eight isolated finds, which are not considered archeological
sites, were also located.
Of the 59 sites evaluated during the present investigations, 38 (41RK12, 41RK34, 41RK609,
41RK610, 41RK611, 41RK612, 41RK617, 41RK618, 41RK619, 41RK620, 41RK624, 41RK625,
41RK626, 41RK627, 41RK628, 41RK630, 41RK632, 41RK633, 41RK635, 41RK636, 41RK637,
41RK638, 41RK639, 41RK640, 41RK641, 41RK642, 41RK643, 41RK644, 41RK647, 41RK648,
41RK649, 41RK650, 41RK651, 41RK653, 41RK654, 41RK656, 41RK662, and 41RK664) have
historic components, 17 (41RK13, 41RK14, 41RK16, 41RK187, 41RK26, 41RK27, 41RK29, 41RK32,
41RK614, 41RK615, 41RK616, 41RK621, 41RK623, 41RK629, 41RK646, 41RK652, and 41RK655)
have prehistoric components, and 4 (41RK35, 41RK613, and 41RK631, 41RK663) have both
historic and prehistoric components.
All 38 sites with historic components (41RK12, 41RK34, 41RK609, 41RK610, 41RK611, 41RK612,
41RK617, 41RK618, 41RK619, 41RK620, 41RK624, 41RK625, 41RK626, 41RK627, 41RK628,
41RK630, 41RK632, 41RK633, 41RK635, 41RK636, 41RK637, 41RK638, 41RK639, 41RK640,
41RK641, 41RK642, 41RK643, 41RK644, 41RK647, 41RK648, 41RK649, 41RK650, 41RK651,
41RK653, 41RK654, 41RK656, 41RK662, and 41RK664) are thought to be ineligible for National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) inclusion, and no further work is recommended.

Of the 17 prehistoric sites evaluated, 14 (41RK13, 41RK14, 41RK16, 41RK26, 41RK27, 41RK29,
41RK614, 41RK615, 41RK616, 41RK621, 41RK623, 41RK646, 41RK652, and 41RK655) are thought
to lack sufficient data resources to warrant NRHP inclusion, and no further work is recommended.
The NRHP eligibility status of the remaining 3 prehistoric sites (41RK32, 41RK187, and 41RK629)
remains undetermined. It is recommended that mine-related impact to these sites be avoided. If
this is not possible, NRHP eligibility testing is recommended.
The historic and prehistoric components at sites 41RK613, 41RK631, and 41RK663 appear to lack
the data resources warranting NRHP inclusion, and no further work is recommended. The NRHP
eligibility status of the prehistoric component at site 41RK35 remains unknown, while the historic
component appears to lack the data resources warranting NRHP inclusion. It is recommended that
mine-related impact to the prehistoric component at site 41RK35 be avoided. Site 41RK35 has been
excluded from the limits of the current permit area and mine related impacts are not anticipated.

Project historians recorded 18 locations containing 27 historic-age nonarcheological resources
within the Liberty Deposit Mine Area boundaries. Each of these resources (excepting those located
on properties with restricted access) was shovel tested to determine if subsurface deposits were
present. Typically, this entailed the excavation of eight shovel tests in a cruciform pattern around

100013883/100196

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
each standing structure. Historic standing structures HS18A and HS18B have been excluded from
the permit area by the boundary adjustment.

None of the nonarcheological historic standing structures appears to possess sufficient integrity or
historic significance to merit inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion A, B, C, or D. Therefore, no
further consideration of these resources is recommended under any applicable regulatory criteria.

All artifacts recovered from shovel tests were brought back to the Atkins laboratory in Austin,
Texas, for processing and analysis. These tasks were completed under the direction of Atkins
Laboratory Director Linda Ellis. Atkins intends to curate only temporally diagnostic historic
artifacts. Historic artifacts that Atkins plans not to curate include all colorless flat window glass,
unmarked colorless vessel glass, flat window glass with a green tint, flat window glass with an aqua
tint, and all machine-made amber and brown vessel glass. Atkins does plan to curate all historic
ceramic artifacts and all other glass not included in the above list, such as amethyst, cobalt, dark
olive, pink, red, and aqua-colored glass. Atkins intends to curate all prehistoric ceramic artifacts and
lithic tools, but does not intend to curate any nondiagnostic lithic debitage or thermally altered
rocks.

NATURAL SETTING
The Liberty Deposit Mine Area is located within the Pineywoods region of east Texas (Gould 1975).
This area is also within the West Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic province (Fenneman 1938). The
vegetation consists primarily of upland pastures, forested slopes, and bottomland forests and
wetlands.

CLIMATE

The Luminant Liberty Deposit project area is characterized by a humid subtropical climate,
averaging 213 frost-free days per year. Temperatures average 46 degrees Fahrenheit (Â°F) in winter
and 81Â°F in summer. The average annual rainfall for the area is approximately 114 centimeters
(cm). Summer is typically the driest season of the year, and spring is usually the wettest; monthly
rainfall averages range from a low of 6.2 cm in August to a high of 12.5 cm in May (Griffith 2000).

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND GEOLOGY

The Liberty Deposit project area is located in the West Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic province
(Fenneman 1938). The surface topography of the region is characterized by gently rolling hills
dissected by dendritic drainage systems.
Structurally, the project area is situated on the extreme western flank of the Sabine Uplift, a major
domal structure affecting northeast Texas and northwest Louisiana. The axis of the East Texas
Embayment, a northeast-southwest-trending synclinal structure, passes about 80 kilometers (km)
northwest of the Liberty Deposit. Both of these features have influenced the unconsolidated
sedimentary strata that underlie the mine area by altering the gentle dip toward the Gulf that is
found across most of the region.

The dominant geologic unit in the mine area is the Eocene-aged Wilcox Group, which is composed
of sediments deposited by ancient river systems (Kaiser et al. 1978). These sediments and others of
lesser geologic groups are lithologically composed of varying proportions of siliceous clay, silt,
sand, gravel, and lignite. According to Fisher and McGowen (1967), Wilcox sediments were
deposited as part of a fluvial depositional environment called the Mt. Pleasant Fluvial System. In
early Eocene times, large streams meandered over a relatively flat coastal plain that is now
northeast Texas. As these streams migrated and changed their course of flow, they deposited finegrained silts and clays in large areas between different stream channels. These interchannel areas
were lowland swamps and marshes that supported abundant vegetation. Over time, this vegetation
100013883/100196

5

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
formed several large peat deposits that eventually became the lignites that are found in the Wilcox
Group today.

The high sand content of the Wilcox Group and other lesser geologic formations (Carrizo and
Reklaw) is responsible for shaping the character of the local archeological record. The soils are
generally friable and easily disrupted by surface disturbances, either natural or man-made.
Holocene alluvial deposits are restricted to the floodplains of Martin Creek and Dry Creek. These
deposits have been, for the most part, either submerged by the creation of Martin Lake (Figure 2) or
are periodically inundated with fluctuations in lake level. For these reasons, the probability that
significant cultural resources have been buried and preserved below Holocene alluvial deposits is
low.

SOILS

The primary soil map units within the project area (Natural Resources Conservation Service [NRCS]
2010) are recorded as Woodtell and Latex soil series, both of which are Alfisols. As found within the
project area, these soils typically have a yellow-brown fine sandy loam surface layer underlain by a
red clay subsoil. Specific soil types mapped within the survey area (Griffin 1998; NRCS 2010) are
shown on Figure 3 and listed in Table 1 with their general topographic position and taxonomic
designation. Of these series, nine soils were classed as Alfisols (Bernaldo, Bowie, Darco, Latex,
Maben, Meth, Sawlit, Sawlit-Sawtown complex, and Woodtell), one was classed as an Entisol
(Mattex), three were classed as Inceptisols (Dreka, Iulus, and Laneville), and five were classed as
Ultisols (Cuthbert, Kirvin, Lilbert, Rentzel, and Tenaha).
Alfisols are the dominant soil order in the project area, and they typically have light-colored, loamy
A horizons with clay-enriched B horizons. Most of these soils formed in sandy or loamy residuum,
and all are found on upland landforms. Archeological sites found in these soils can be expected to be
shallow, unless buried in colluvium. All of these soils are acidic, and their low pH is generally
detrimental to the preservation of organic archeological materials.

Entisols are recent soils that have little evidence of the development of genetic horizons. In the
project area, they are floodplain soils that formed in loamy and clayey alluvium. They are acidic,
poorly drained, and are frequently flooded for long periods. A perched water table typically occurs
between depths of 30 and 70 cm. These soils are not conducive to the preservation of bone or
carbonized materials.

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
Inceptisols are immature soils that have weakly expressed profile features. They are deep and
moderately well-drained soils that formed in loamy and clayey alluvium. Found in elevated
portions of floodplains (relict terraces and natural levees), these soils range from slightly to
extremely acidic and are moist for most of the year. They may be flooded for brief durations
between November and May. Archeologically, they are important, since they may harbor the buried
remains of Late Prehistoric occupations. In addition to habitation sites, because these soils are
among the most fertile of any in the project area, they may have been utilized by semisedentary
populations for seasonal cultivation.
Ultisols are acidic clay soils that are situated upon Pleistocene or older landforms. Within the
project area they are situated upon interfluvial backslopes and sideslopes but are sometimes
floodplain soils. They are generally humate rich in the upper horizon with leached, low mineral
content in the underlying clay soil horizons. Ultisols generally supported coniferous or hardwood
forest prior to clearing and cultivation. Due to their high acidity, these soils are not conducive to the
preservation of bone or carbonized materials.

FLORA

The Liberty Deposit is located in Gouldâs (1975) Pineywoods vegetational region and within the
western portion of the Austroriparian biotic province as described and delineated by Dice (1943)
and Blair (1950). As noted by Blair (1950), the Austroriparian province in Texas is similar in terms
of fauna and vegetation to the rest of the province, which extends eastward to the Atlantic coast.
Extensive forests of pines and hardwoods, along with scattered swamps, marshes, and other hydric
habitats, are characteristic of the Austroriparian province. As seen below, this also typifies the
study area, along with a proportion of primarily man-made open habitats (i.e., pasture, hay fields,
and croplands).

The most common upland tree species in the Pineywoods are loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), shortleaf
pine (P. echinata), post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Q. marilandica), southern red oak (Q.
falcata), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and hickories (Carya ovata, C. tomentosa, and C.
cordiformis). Common lowland trees are water oak (Q. nigra), willow oak (Q. phellos), Shumard oak
(Q. shumardii), sugar hackberry (Celtis laevigata), overcup oak (Q. lyrata), and elms (Ulmus
americana, U. rubra, and U. crassifolia) (Braun 1950; Tharp 1926).

Herbs and shrubs abound in the Pineywoods, many of which provide forage for native and
domesticated animals. These are predominantly species of Andropogon, Sporobolus, Panicum,
Paspalum, Muhlenbergia, Eragrostis, Chasmanthium, indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), native
legumes, and occasional shrubs. Many other grasses as well as a large variety of forbs are
represented to form an extremely complex association of herbs and brush species. Common
invader species include broomsedge bluestem (Andropogon virginicus), smutgrass (Sporobolus
100013883/100196

2. Natural Setting
indicus), yankeeweed (Eupatorium compositifolum), red lovegrass (Eragrostis oxylepis), greenbriar
(Smilax sp.), and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria) (Thomas 1975).

Upland Pine/Hardwood Forests

The structure of the upland pine/hardwood forests found within the study area is variable,
depending upon successional status, present disturbances, and historical factors (figures 4 and 5).
Dominant overstory species include loblolly pine, shortleaf pine, southern red oak, post oak, black
hickory (C. texana), sweetgum, and eastern hophornbeam (Ostrya virginiana). The more mesic
stands have an overstory dominated by black tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica), sweetgum, white oak (Q.
alba), eastern hophornbeam, and red mulberry (Morus rubra). The understory and shrub layers of
upland stands are usually quite dense. Dominant species in the understory include winged elm (U.
alata), eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana), flowering dogwood (Cornus florida), sweetgum,
Carolina buckthorn (Rhamnus caroliniana), red maple (Acer rubrum), American holly (Ilex opaca),
black tupelo, eastern redbud (Cercis canadensis), eastern hophornbeam, and American hornbeam
(Carpinus caroliniana). Common shrubs include saplings of eastern redcedar, flowering dogwood,
black tupelo, American holly, sweetgum, and various oaks, along with American beautyberry
(Callicarpa americana), farkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum), southern wax myrtle (Myrica cerifera),
and common sassafras (Sassafras albidum). The herbaceous stratum is dense and composed of
various seedlings, grasses, and other herbs.

Pasturelands

Pasturelands are predominantly hay fields and improved pastures (Figure 6) planted in coastal and
common bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon), bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum), or dallisgrass
(Paspalum dilatatum). Weedy species include heartwing sorrel (Rumex hastatulus), yankeeweed
(Eupatorium compositifolium), bitterweed (Helenium amarum), soft goldaster (Heterotheca sp.),
western ragweed (Ambrosia psilostachya), asters (Aster spp.), partridge pea (Cassia fasciculata), and
woolly croton (Croton capitatus).

Floodplain Communities

Floodplain communities in the study area include bottomland hardwood forests and pastures that
may be seasonally inundated (Figure 7). Bottomland hardwood forests occur on floodplains
associated with permanent and intermittent creeks and streams. Important overstory species
observed in the bottomlands include sweetgum, river birch (Betula nigra), red maple, Florida maple
(A. barbatum), black tupelo, and American hornbeam. Water oak, willow oak, and loblolly pine
occur less commonly. Common buttonbush (Cephalanthus occidentalis) is a common understory
species, while seedlings of various overstory species in association with various sedges and other
herbs comprise a usually sparse ground cover.

Disturbed Areas
Many areas which have sustained heavy disturbances were identified within the study area. These
areas included stock ponds, gas well pads, pipeline rights of way, and associated access roads
(figures 8â11). Many of these well pads were constructed upon upland landforms adjacent to
stream courses and determined to be high probability areas for aboriginal occupations.
Additionally, a transmission line corridor passes across the north end of the project area. This
transmission corridor is mown and maintained for access by the power companies.

FAUNA

The vertebrate fauna of the Liberty Deposit Mine Area is generally typical of that occurring over
most of the rest of the Austroriparian province, with the majority of the wildlife species being
associated with either forested or aquatic habitats. Principal wildlife species within the region
generally coincide in distribution with the principal vegetational communities, i.e., upland forests,
bottomland forests, and aquatic areas.

The vertebrate fauna of northeast Texas is diverse, and there are numerous species that are
common to the study area and may have been important to past inhabitants. Important mammals
include the fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), raccoon (Procyon lotor), Virginia opossum (Didelphis
virginiana), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), beaver (Castor canadensis), muskrat
(Ondatra zibethicus), mink (Mustela vison), and cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus) (Schmidly
1983). Black bear (Ursus americanus) may also have been present in northeast Texas prior to the
latter part of the nineteenth century (House 1978). At least 49 species of mammals are known to
have inhabited the Austroriparian biotic province in Texas in recent times (Blair 1950), and most of
these were probably available for utilization by early historic settlers. In addition, at least 29 snake
species, 10 lizards, 2 land turtles, and 25 amphibians are known from the area (Blair 1950) and
may also have been exploited (Butzer 1971:149). A large number of fish and macroinvertebrate
species may have been of particular value to aboriginal inhabitants due to the relative ease in
exploiting the resource. Major fish taxa include minnows, sunfish, topminnows, darters, and pirate
perch, and principal macroinvertebrates of the area include terrestrial and freshwater pelecypods
and gastropods.

PREHISTORIC FOOD SOURCES

Ethnohistoric accounts of the subsistence practices and organic remains recovered from Caddo
archeological sites afford a view of the large array of plant foods that were exploited, both wild and
cultivated. Among the latter were corn, beans, sunflowers, and pumpkins. The vast array of wild
plants eaten included nuts, such as hickory (Carya sp.), pecan (Carya illinoinensis), chinkapin
(Castanea pumila), acorns (Quercus sp.), and black walnut (Juglans nigra); plums (Prunus sp.);
persimmons (Diospyros sp.); grapes (Vitus sp.); strawberries (Frageria virginiana); edible roots; and

a variety of herbs and seeds from annuals, such as knotweed (Polygonum sp.), goosefoot
(Chenopodium sp.), marshelder (Iva sp.), and wild lettuce (Lactuca sp.) (Crane 1982; Perttula and
Bruseth 1983; Swanton 1942).

Animal foods were equally important and varied. Again using ethnohistoric data derived from early
contacts with the Caddo, these resources included white-tailed deer, black bear, cottontail rabbit,
opossum, squirrel, raccoon, dog (Canis familiaris), various birds (i.e., ducks and geese [Anatidae],
turkey [Meleagris gallopavo], quail [Colinus virginianus], and prairie chicken [Tympanuchus
cupido]).
Bison (Bos bison) may have existed in very limited numbers in east Texas during prehistoric times,
as their remains have been encountered at a number of archeological sites in adjacent areas
(Neuman 1984). Early historic accounts, however, indicate bison were not found in the forests of
east Texas, but were hunted on the plains to the west. In 1691, CasaÃ±as located the herds about
4 daysâ travel from a Nabedache village, and Hasinai hunting parties established a well-defined path
between the Brazos and Trinity rivers in their forays to and from the bison range (CasaÃ±as de JesÃºs
MarÃ­a 1927; Griffith 1954:113).

In addition to mammals, fish, such as gar (Lepisosteus sp.), bowfin (Amia calva), pickerel (Esox sp.),
catfish (Ictaluridae), and bass (Centrarchidae), and reptiles and amphibians, including snapping
turtle (Chelydra serpentina), lizards (Iguanidae), snakes (Colubridae), and frogs (Rana sp.), were
also exploited (Perttula and Bruseth 1983; Swanton 1942).

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS â NORTHEAST TEXAS AND ADJACENT AREAS
Archeological investigations in the eastern United States originally focused on the religious myths
surrounding mound sites and a desire to obtain high-status funerary objects often contained within
them. The Mississippi and Ohio river valleys were the scenes of much of this early activity (Atwater
1820; Squier and Davis 1848). Northeast Texas remained at the periphery of this activity until the
first decades of the twentieth century. Spurred by exploration of archeological sites by steamboat
along the Red River in Louisiana (Moore 1912), J.E. Pearce, in 1919 and 1920, set out to record sites
in Cherokee, Harrison, Henderson, Hopkins, and Hunt counties (Barnard 1939). Working for the
University of Texas, Pearce laid the groundwork for studies that were to follow.
From 1927 to 1936, Pearce arranged for additional archeological work in Texas, much of which
centered in east Texas. In Titus County in the early 1930s, at least eight sites were investigated
(Thurmond 1990), including the Hale Mound (41TT12) and the Keith Mound (41TT11)
(Goldschmidt 1934; Jackson 1934a). In Panola County, a review of the survey notes of A.T. Jackson
for 1934 identified three sites that were later given Smithsonian trinomial numbers 41PN1, 41PN5,
and 41PN15 (Jackson 1934b). Jackson (1935) reported on at least three sites in Rusk County,
41RK1, 41RK2, and 41RK6, the last of which was reportedly tested. Site 41RK4 was reported in the
early 1930s by Jackson and Woosley (Woosley 1939).

In 1935, Goldschmidt prepared a synthesis of archeological sites in Titus County and their
relationship to sites in east Texas. Although basically a trait list comparison, a cultural chronology
was established for the area. The importance of this early work is that it was one of the first
attempts at defining a chronological framework. For Rusk County, the 1939 and 1940 Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) files show a listing of 26 sites in a catalogue of east
Texas sites (Hughes 1948). No site descriptions were given and no precise locations were
documented for the sites. These early works would later serve as a basis for the regional syntheses
of Krieger (1946) and Suhm et al. (1954).

Beginning with the establishment of the Interagency Archeological Salvage Program in 1946 and
the initiation of the River Basin Surveys Program in the late 1940s, numerous investigations were
conducted in the following decades in northeast Texas (Anderson 1972; Davis 1958; Davis and
Davis 1960; Hsu 1969; Sullivan 1977). In portions of southeastern Panola County, one such survey
was conducted in conjunction with the construction of Toledo Bend Reservoir on the Sabine River.
100013883/100196

19

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
In this survey, Scurlock and Davis (1962) located 160 sites in the reservoir. Of this total, seven sites
were documented for Panola County: 41PN6â41PN12. One site (41PN6) was designated as possibly
Paleoindian, one site (41PN9) was identified as Archaic, and two sites (41PN8 and 41PN12) were
identified as possibly Caddo. The chronological positions of the remaining Panola County sites were
not determined. In 1969, a single site (41PN13) was located by Tom Deppe in southwestern Panola
County along Murvaul Bayou, now under Lake Murvaul. In 1968, a reconnaissance survey of the
then-proposed Ponta Reservoir, located on the Angelina River in Cherokee, Nacogdoches, and Rusk
counties, was conducted by archeologists from Southern Methodist University (Skinner 1971). Ten
prehistoric sites, including three from Rusk County, were recorded. The majority of archeological
investigations conducted in the region have been accomplished in association with mining
activities.

Martin Lake Reservoir

When large areas were to be impacted by the development of a power plant and associated lignite
mine, archeologists from the Texas Archeological Survey (TAS) conducted an archeological survey
of the Martin Lake area of Rusk and Panola counties (McDonald 1972) (Figure 12). Forty-one sites
were recorded, most of which were in Rusk County. Twenty of the recorded sites were
recommended by TAS personnel for testing. Following that survey, TAS archeologists conducted
formal testing on 5 of the 20 sites: 41RK19 (listed in the NRHP), 41RK21, 41RK32, 41RK36, and
41RK39 (Clark and Ivey 1974). Site 41RK39 was determined to be a multicomponent site with Late
Caddo and Late Archaic components (Clark and Ivey 1974:84). A Late Caddo occupation was also
documented for sites 41RK19, 41RK21, and 41RK32. For site 41RK36, a single-component contactperiod occupation was identified containing European trade goods, dated from postâA.D. 1600
(Clark and Ivey 1974:70). Two sites (41RK24 and 41RK30) investigated during this survey lie
within the Martin Lake Mine Area AIV boundary. Both of these sites were reassessed during a
survey of the AIV area (Sherman et al. 2005)

Martin Lake Mine (Areas A, B, and C)

Since 1982, Espey, Huston & Associates, inc. (EH&A, now Atkins) has conducted numerous cultural
resource surveys in Panola County. Wooldridge (1982) located a single prehistoric site and one
historic site within the corridor of a proposed pipeline. In late 1982, EH&A archeologists conducted
a sample survey for cultural resources over about 19 percent of all undisturbed areas within the
permit boundary of the Martin Lake Mine, Areas A, B, and C (Glander and Brandimarte 1983).
Located less than 14 km northeast of the Oak Hill permit area, 29 sites (17 historic and 12
prehistoric) were recorded within the mine permit boundary. Virtually all prehistoric sites were
found to be located in the near vicinity of water courses, about 305 meters (m) or less from
established creek or river banks. Historic sites tended to follow a similar pattern, but were also

100013883/100196

20

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
found to be located adjacent to the modern road network. Two sites, 41PN14 and 41PN25, were
recommended by EH&A archeologists for limited archeological testing.

A second survey of the Martin Lake Mine (Glander and Victor 1984) was conducted in accordance
with recommendations by EH&A personnel (Glander and Brandimarte 1983) for additional
investigation of undisturbed lands hypothesized by EH&A archeologists to have a high probability
for site occurrence. Covering about 3,526 acres, 17 sites and isolated finds were recorded
(41PN46â41PN52, 41PN54â41PN63), 6 of which were historic. During the course of this survey
(Glander and Victor 1984), limited archeological testing was also conducted on sites 41PN14 and
41PN25. The former site was found to represent possibly Early and Late Caddo occupations, and
the latter a Late Caddo occupation. Avoidance of sites 41PN14 and 41PN48 (from which suspected
prehistoric burial goods were recovered) was recommended by EH&A archeologists, along with a
recommendation for limited archeological testing of site 41PN57.

A third survey by EH&A cultural resource personnel was conducted in October 1984 in a boundary
revision for the C-II permit area (Glander 1984a). Covering about 551 acres, only three historic
sites were recorded (41PN64â41PN66).

The fourth effort conducted by EH&A archeologists in the Martin Lake Mine concerned
archeological testing of site 41PN57, which was recommended for testing by Glander and Victor
(1984). The site was shown to represent a Caddo occupation that was heavily disturbed and
maintained no site integrity (Glander 1984b).
The fifth large effort conducted by archeologists from EH&A in Panola County was a survey of all
undisturbed and unsurveyed areas in Martin Lake Mine, Areas A, B, and C. The investigation
covered about 12,849 acres and resulted in the location of 30 new sites and 2 isolated finds
(Glander, Victor et al. 1986).
As an adjunct to the survey effort, archeological testing was also conducted on historic site 41PN42,
and historical and archival research was conducted on sites 41PN29 and 41PN26. Ethnohistoric
research was also conducted on the communities of Sugar Hill, Harris Chapel, and Center Point, and
on historic cemetery sites 41PN18, 41PN30, and 41PN95.

Testing investigations demonstrated site 41PN42 to have resulted from occupation during the late
nineteenth century to the late twentieth century, first as a residence, then as a barn. Sites 41PN29
and 41PN26 were shown to date from the early twentieth century and the late nineteenth century,
respectively, and the communities of Sugar Hill, Harris Chapel, and Center Point were shown to
represent dispersed farming communities linked through familial ties. The historic cemetery
research revealed a wide variety of cemetery styles reflecting different approaches to the interment
of the deceased.
100013883/100196

3. Cultural Background
Other investigations in the Martin Lake Mine concerned sites 41PN26 and 41PN75. Previous
archival and dendrochronological analysis had revealed that site 41PN26 dated from 1872 and
1873 (Glander, Victor et al. 1986). Monitored land clearing in 1989 found no intact cultural deposits
and few nineteenth-century artifacts (Glander 1989). Historic site 41PN75, dating from the 1870s,
was originally recorded in 1985 (Glander, Bearden et al. 1986). EH&A conducted site excavation to
mitigate the loss of the site due to mining (Kotter and Moore 1990). Nearly 10,000 artifacts were
recovered and 12 cultural features were recorded. Stratified cultural deposits were limited to the
twentieth century.
In February of 1990, EH&A conducted a survey of a proposed expansion area of the Martin Lake
Mine (Kotter et al. 1992). The area surveyed encompassed 2,339 acres and was designated the B
West study area. A total of 20 sites were located, including 7 previously recorded sites and 13
previously unrecorded sites. The survey area examined was virtually all uplands, where previous
investigations of similar environments had established an expected yield of low density/probability
for prehistoric sites (Moncure and Jackson 1980). As anticipated, of the 13 newly recorded sites,
only 2 were prehistoric.

The THC reiterated that 1 site, 41PN14, was NRHP-eligible, stated that 15 sites were not eligible,
and indicated that 4 sites warranted further investigation to determine eligibility (Bruseth and
Perttula 1992). This resulted in the National Register testing program of the four historic sites by
EH&A in December of 1992 at the B West Mine area (Nash et al. 1994). The sites tested include
41PN2/115, 41PN99, 41PN102, and 41PN104. The dual site number reflects a misplotting of site
41PN2 at TARL and the corrected site number for the tested site. None of the sites tested for the
National Register were deemed eligible for listing, and no further investigations were
recommended.
In 1996 EH&A conducted a cultural resources survey of two areas within the Martin Lake Mine (AIV
and BIII), totaling 2,378 acres (Taylor and Tate 1997). That survey located 46 sites, consisting of 16
historic, 29 prehistoric, and 1 multiple component historic/prehistoric sites. In 2005, PBS&J
surveyed 2,424 acres within the Martin Lake AIV South Mine (Sherman et al. 2005) and located 23
newly recorded historic sites and 1 prehistoric site. Only the prehistoric site (41PN214) was
determined to have an unknown NRHP-eligibility status and was subjected to NRHP testing in 2007
(Sherman, Ellis, and Hoskins 2008) and determined to be ineligible for NRHP inclusion. In 2006,
PBS&J conducted NRHP eligibility testing of three sites (41PN124, 41RK194, and 41RK455) within
the Martin Lake Mine (Dixon et al. 2007) and demonstrated that none possess significant data
resources that warrant NRHP inclusion. During 2008, PBS&J conducted testing investigations on
sites 41PN131 and 41PN137. This effort demonstrated that neither site possesses significant data
resources (Sherman, Ellis, Hoskins et al. 2008).

Oak Hill (Martin Lake Mine, Area D)
It was during the 1930s and 1940s that cultural resources in Rusk County and the Oak Hill Mine
were first examined (Hughes 1948; Jackson 1935). It was not until the 1970s, however, that moresystematic investigations were conducted, mostly in response to reservoir development (Clark and
Ivey 1974; McDonald 1972; Skinner 1971). Coupled with surveys for the lignite mining industry,
this trend has continued into the present decade (Heartfield, Price and Green [HPG] 1984; Jackson
1982, 1983; Moncure and Jackson 1980, 1982; Northern 1981; Northern and Skiles 1981; Skinner
et al. 1981).

Within the Oak Hill Mine permit boundary, 43 archeological sites have been recorded by previous
investigators (41RK87, 41RK106, 41RK109â41RK128, 41RK143â41RK161, 41RK193, 41RK194).
The sites represent the results of several investigations (Glander et al. 1987; HPG 1984; Jackson
1982, 1983; Moncure and Jackson 1980, 1982).

The 1980 TAS document (Moncure and Jackson 1980) was the first of the four previously
referenced cultural resource investigations within the Oak Hill Mine, and reported on a
reconnaissance survey conducted for TXU over two separate lignite tracts in Rusk County. The
southern tract (Deposit 362) covered about 21,004 acres and was located south of Henderson,
Texas. The northern tract (Deposit 363) covered about 37,066 acres. It was the Mill Creek areaâs
eastern drainage that received the most attention during the reconnaissance survey of Deposit 363
(Moncure and Jackson 1980:1).
Only four prehistoric sites were recorded: one (41RK65) from Deposit 362, and three (41RK82,
41RK83, and 41RK106) from Deposit 363 (Moncure and Jackson 1980:25â26). Site 41RK65 was
described as a scatter of ceramics, lithic tools, and raw material that had been heavily impacted and
possibly destroyed by highway construction. Ceramics and nondiagnostic lithics were noted from
sites 41RK82 and 41RK83. Both sites are in the Oak Hill D-III permit area. In addition, site 41RK106
was recorded and recommended for testing (Jackson 1982).
Within Deposit 362 south of Henderson, two single historic grave locations were identified, but
were not assigned a trinomial site number (Moncure and Jackson 1980:45). Six historic resources,
including previously located 41RK64 and five newly recorded resources, were located in Deposit
363. Three of the five resources were assigned trinomial site numbers 41RK85, 41RK86, 41RK87,
and two were simply assigned field numbers H-4 and H-5 (Moncure and Jackson 1980:27â40). Of
these six resources, only 41RK85 and 41RK86 are located within the Oak Hill D-III permit area.

Site 41RK64, known as the Taylor Brown Kiln, was originally reported by G. Greer in 1973 as part
of her kiln studies in Texas (site form on file at TARL). In addition to the kiln remains, examination
by TAS archeologists revealed evidence of a grist mill, remains of an antebellum dwelling, and a
cemetery over an approximately 5-acre area. The site appears to date from the 1850s, and
avoidance was recommended by TAS archeologists (Moncure and Jackson 1980).
100013883/100196

24

3. Cultural Background
Sites 41RK85 and 41RK86 represent the Millville Cemetery and the former community of Millville,
respectively. Both the community and the cemetery were established in the early 1850s. The
Millville Cemetery is still in use. Survey and subsurface testing was recommended for 41RK86 by
TAS archeologists to determine the extent and condition of the former community (Moncure and
Jackson 1980:37). Both of these sites were revisited during the Oak Hill D-III survey. In addition to
two components of site 41RK86 (A and B) that were identified during an EH&A survey conducted in
the Oak Hill 2280 Mine in 1989 (Rogers et al. 1992), the Oak Hill D-III survey (Skokan et al. 1997)
located another three components. All three of these components are surface and subsurface
artifact scatters that represent residences.

Site 41RK87 was recorded by TAS archeologists and identified as the ruins of a former antebellum
plantation of Anglo affiliation dating from ca. 1854 (Moncure and Jackson 1980:37). Archeologists
from TAS recommended that selective excavation be conducted to determine the existence of
outbuilding remains and obtain a sample of representative artifacts (Moncure and Jackson
1980:40). The site was revisited by TAS personnel in 1982 (Jackson 1982) and was found to have
been destroyed by bulldozing. As a result, the original recommendation referenced above was
retracted, and no further investigation of the site was recommended (Jackson 1982:23).

The two resources identified as H-4 and H-5 were briefly referenced by Moncure and Jackson
(1980:40) as possible tenant farms. It is not apparent from the text or from a subsequent report
from TAS concerning the area (Jackson 1982) whether either resource was assigned a site number.
A check of maps on file at TARL, however, revealed that site numbers 41RK107 and 41RK108 have
been assigned for two locations that are thought by the EH&A researchers to represent the
respective locations for H-4 and H-5. Site 41RK107 is located within the D-III permit area and was
revisited by EH&A in 1997 (Taylor and Tate 1997). It was subjected to NRHP testing in 2001
(Sherman 2001a) where it was shown to represent a nineteenth-century domestic occupation that
lacked depositional integrity.
Besides site 41RK87, Moncure and Jackson (1980:40â42) briefly referenced three other possible
plantation house sites (Tutt, Vinson, and Magee) that were thought to be located somewhere in
Deposit 363. Remains of the three plantations were not located by Moncure and Jackson (1980). A
subsequent report from TAS (Jackson 1982) revealed the Vinson plantation (41RK128) to be in the
Oak Hill Mine but east of Farm to Market Road (FM) 1716, and the Tutt plantation to be out of the
Mine. The remains of the Magee plantation were not located by Jackson (1982). Data recovery
investigations were later conducted on the Vinson plantation (Anderson et al. in preparation)
In January and February 1982, TAS archeologists conducted a cultural resource survey of the
railroad and transmission line corridor for the Martin Lake Mine-Area D (Moncure and Jackson
1982). Three sites were recorded, none of which is within the Oak Hill Mine. Prehistoric site
41RK10, first recorded by TAS in 1972 (McDonald 1972), was found to be destroyed.
100013883/100196

25

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
Two historic sites were recorded, 41RK104 and 41RK105. The latter was a farmstead dating
possibly from the 1920s. The former site, the Thomas Jefferson Walling Cabin, dated from the
1840s (Moncure and Jackson 1982:24â34) and was determined eligible for the NRHP in 1982. The
log cabin was subjected to data recovery investigations (Moncure 1984) and eventually relocated to
the Depot Museum grounds in Henderson, Texas.

In July and August 1982, TAS (Jackson 1982) conducted an intensive survey of the Oak Hill Mine
(Martin Lake Mine Area D) west of FM 1716. The area for survey encompassed approximately
6,795 acres, but because of a lack of land access, about 494 acres could not be surveyed. Only four
prehistoric sites were recorded by Jackson (41RK106, 41RK109, 41RK110, and 41RK111), all
adjacent to Mill Creek.
Jackson (1983) also conducted a survey of a then-proposed electric transmission line corridor that
was to transect the present permit area. One possible historic site (41RK131) was recorded on the
basis of a hole filled with trash (site form on file at TARL).

Another investigation within the mine was conducted by HPG (1984). The remaining lands within
the Oak Hill Mine east of FM 1716 were intensively surveyed for cultural resources. Covering about
2,965 acres, only a single prehistoric dart point fragment was recovered (41RK143), excluding
historic resources. The virtual absence of prehistoric sites is thought to be due to a virtual lack of a
perennial water supply (HPG 1984:27).

Nineteen historic sites (41RK128, 41RK144â41RK161) were recorded by HPG (1984). An
additional 48 mid-to-late-twentieth-century structures were also described by HPG as mostly
modern homes. None of the structures was given archeological site status.

Other cultural resource investigation within the adjacent Oak Hill Mine was conducted by EH&A
archeologists in July 1985. The work was requested by Texas Utilities Mining Company (TUMCO) in
partial response to a letter from the THC dated June 17, 1985, to the Railroad Commission of Texas
concerning the permit application for the Oak Hill Surface Lignite Mine. The THC letter
recommended, in part, that the areas surrounding known springs be resurveyed to determine
whether cultural resources were located adjacent to the springs. The approximate locations of five
springs were provided by the THC on appropriate base maps. The area surrounding each spring
was subjected to intensive pedestrian survey (including screened shovel testing), totaling about
420 acres. No cultural resources were located.
The same THC letter also recommended avoidance of prehistoric sites 41RK106 and 41RK109â
41RK111, survey of all areas not previously accessed by either TAS or HPG, and additional
investigations of 13 historic sites: 41RK115, 41RK123, 41RK126, 41RK128, 41RK147â41RK150,
41RK153â41RK156, and 41RK159.

Also in July 1985, at the request of TUMCO, EH&A archeologists conducted a field check of sites
41RK106, 41RK109, 41RK110, and 41RK111, all previously recorded by TAS archeologists (Jackson
1982; Moncure and Jackson 1980). The investigation was conducted to determine whether any of
the sites had been adversely impacted by land clearing for the then-proposed electric transmission
line corridor to be built and managed by Southwestern Electric Power Company. Site 41RK106 was
found to be extensively eroded due to natural runoff. The remaining sites were grass covered and
little affected by natural erosion. None of the four sites visited by EH&A archeologists were found to
fall within the proposed transmission line corridor, and none had been impacted by construction.

Site 41RK109 was found to be about 33 m west of the western perimeter of the corridor (i.e., not
the centerline) and, because of its proximity to the corridor, it was recommended by EH&A
personnel that heavy machinery related to construction not be permitted to park or drive over site
41RK109 if such machinery was to venture outside the utility corridor. A subsequent visit to the
corridor by EH&A archeologists in July 1987 revealed that the sites were not impacted by
construction of the completed transmission line.
In 1987, EH&A archeologists conducted a 100 percent cultural resources survey of all unsurveyed
lands then within the Oak Hill Mine (Glander et al. 1987). In addition, the study sought to reassess
all previously recorded sites within the entire mine. A total of 41 previously recorded sites were
relocated and their current status was assessed. Two previously unrecorded sites were also
located.

In 1989, EH&A conducted a cultural resources survey of a 2,281-acre area for the Oak Hill 2280
Mine northeast of Henderson (Rogers et al. 1992). Twenty-three archeological sites were located,
and five were recommended for further investigation to determine NRHP eligibility. The THC
agreed that the five sites warranted further work and also recommended that further investigations
were necessary to determine NRHP eligibility at three additional sites (Rogers et al. 1992). National
Register testing of these sites was conducted in 1992 and 1993 (Rogers et al. 1994), resulting in the
mitigation of sites 41RK214 (Rogers and Perttula 2004), 41RK222 (Rogers 2001), and 41RK223
(Foster 2000), the avoidance of site 41RK215, and the determination that 41RK86A, 41RK108,
41RK216, and 41RK218 were not eligible for nomination to the NRHP.
The most recent large-scale survey effort in the area was the cultural resources investigations of the
Oak Hill D-III Permit Area in Rusk County by EH&A in May of 1994 (Skokan et al. 1997). The area
subject to intensive survey encompassed 13,412 acres; an additional 521 acres was unavailable due
to landowners who would not permit access to their property. A total of 195 previously unrecorded
sites were discovered in the area, and 8 previously recorded sites were reassessed.
PBS&J conducted NRHP testing on sites 41RK107, 41RK240, 41RK242, 41RK243, 41RK247,
41RK248, 41RK270, 41RK272, 41RK275, 41RK276, 41RK284, 41RK286, and 41RK379 within the
DIII Mine area (Sherman 2001a, 2001b; Sherman and Victor 2001). Site 41RK243 was shown to
100013883/100196

27

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
represent a Caddo habitation with preserved subsistence remains. Site 41RK247 harbored two
historic components of which one (Historic Component II) was shown to represent a circa Civil
Warâera homestead that may have been associated with the Walling family (Sherman et al. 2006).

Hallsville Mine

In 1977, EH&A conducted a preliminary reconnaissance of the South Hallsville Mine area. Eight
prehistoric sites were recorded, six of which were thought to be Caddo occupations (Dibble 1977).
In 1978, EH&A archeologists surveyed 20 percent of the South Hallsville Mine area in the Sabine
River Valley. A total of 88 prehistoric sites were recorded, 83 of which were in creek bottoms along
the Sabine River. Only 5 sites were found in upland regions (EH&A 1979; Freeman 1978).
Additional archeological survey in the Hallsville area was conducted by EH&A personnel in 1983 in
response to mine transportation system reroutes. Twenty previously recorded sites were visited
and three sites were newly recorded. Limited testing was conducted on five of these sites
(Voellinger 1984).

In the 1980s, North American Consultants Inc. (NAC) of Dallas carried out several small cultural
resource investigations in the South Hallsville Mine Area. These included a dragline erection site
(La Vardera 1982), a proposed transmission line and associated facility (La Vardera 1983a), a haul
road and pond area (La Vardera 1983b), the 1984 and 1985 impact areas (La Vardera 1984a) and
other anticipated future impact areas for the life of the permit (La Vardera 1984b, 1987, 1988).
Subsequently, limited testing was conducted by NAC (La Vardera 1983c, 1984c, 1986) on three
sites and nine others that had been originally recorded by EH&A (Dibble 1977; EH&A 1979). Only
one of these sites was recommended for further work. This site, 41HS282, was found to be a small
Caddo hamlet and was avoided by further mining operations.
In 1990 Southern Archaeological Consultants Inc. (SAC) conducted a survey of a dragline walkway
and county road reroute, recording 19 sites and reassessing 12 previously recorded sites.
Subsequent NRHP testing was conducted at 11 of the sites. Two sites were recommended for
further work (Keller 1990).

During the spring of 1990, SAC performed an archeological survey of 1,305 acres at the South
Hallsville Mine (Keller 1991). As a result of this work, 19 sites were located and 12 previously
recorded sites were revisited. Twelve of the sites were recommended for further work. SAC
conducted an additional archeological survey of 2,251 acres during summer 1991 at the South
Hallsville Mine (Keller 1992). Forty-one sites were recorded, and 24 previously recorded sites were
revisited. Nineteen of the sites were recommended for further work.
In 1994 SAC performed a survey of the South Hallsville No. 1 Mine containing an area of 660 acres
(Keller 1995). The survey produced a total of nine previously unrecorded sites and two previously
recorded sites. Of the newly recorded sites, six are prehistoric sites and three are historic. Two of
the previously recorded sites were strictly prehistoric and one was a multicomponent site.

3. Cultural Background

CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY
Paleoindian Period (10,000â6000 B.C.)
The Paleoindian period is the earliest generally accepted cultural period of the Americas and
includes prehistoric peoples who inhabited North America from the end of the Pleistocene epoch
until the early Holocene epoch. This period is alternatively referred to as the time of the âBig Game
Huntingâ tradition, due to a presumed heavy reliance upon now-extinct species of Pleistocene
megafauna as a food source during the early part of the period (Willey 1966:37). It should be noted,
however, that such megafaunal remains are rarely found in association with Paleoindian cultural
remains, and this presumed heavy reliance on megafauna is probably overemphasized.

Social organization probably consisted of loosely structured, highly mobile groups composed of
several nuclear families referred to as bands. Sites of this period are often representative of
temporary camps along small streams occupied by band-sized or smaller groups. Base campâsized
occupation loci are relatively rare and usually associated with lithic procurement activities. The
population density is thought to have been rather low during this period.

Clovis and Folsom point types are generally thought to be representative of the earlier part of the
Paleoindian period, and point types such as Dalton, San Patrice, Scottsbluff, and Plainview are
thought to represent the later part of the period. Although a Paleoindian presence is clearly evident
in east Texas, many of the finds are out of context, limited generally to surface finds or to sites
where Paleoindian materials are mixed with Archaic materials (Davis and Davis 1960; Duffield
1963; Johnson 1962; Jones 1957; Northern and Skiles 1981:28; Voellinger 1984).

Paleoindian sites are rare in the region. Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Scottsbluff points have
been recovered in Rusk County by private collectors (Story 1990). No scientific excavations of
Paleoindian components have been conducted in Rusk County. In Van Zandt County, two Clovis
point bases were recovered, possibly in context, from the Yarbrough site (41VN6) during
excavation of the lower levels of the site (Suhm et al. 1954:147). In Gregg County, Angostura,
Scottsbluff, and Plainview points were found at the Grace Creek sites in a somewhat disturbed
context (Jones 1957:219â220). Two sites in Upshur County and one site in Wood County have been
reported to have Paleoindian components in a stratigraphic context (Perttula et al. 1986:49).

During the late Paleoindian period, a presumed population increase appears to have been
associated with the development of localized cultural patterns (Hester 1986:9). There is evidence of
migration of Plains populations entering the Eastern Woodlands during this time. Johnson (1989)
proposed that these peoples were migrating as a result of drought and its subsequent effect on
Plains fauna.

Story (1990:177) characterized the settlement patterns of Paleoindian inhabitants of the Gulf
Coastal Plain by a high degree of mobility with only brief stays at any one location. The ecological
100013883/100196

29

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
diversity of the Gulf Coastal Plain was optimized with movement over a relatively large
geographical area.

Archaic Period (6000â400 B.C.)

The Archaic period is typically defined as the period when nomadic hunting and gathering cultures
adapted to changing environmental conditions through expanded exploitation of varied ecological
niches and development of a more varied material culture to exploit these different environments
and resources. The Archaic period has been divided into three subperiods: Early, Middle, and Late.
Early Archaic populations made their living in much the same way as their Paleoindian
predecessors. In terms of material culture, the Archaic period is characterized by less-carefully
fashioned, increasingly varied tool kits and a decrease in the use of exotic raw materials. Story
(1990:213) suggests that these phenomena reflect a decrease in the spatial area of the seasonal
round and a shift to more-expedient, task-specific tool use. Utilization of floral and faunal resources
reached an optimal diversity during the Early Archaic, which was accompanied by changes in the
methods of food procurement and preparation. In most areas of the southeast, human populations
saw a gradual and continued expansion throughout the Archaic period.

Terraces and floodplain projections are noted by Thurmond (1990) to be favored locations by
Archaic populations. Hunting and gathering provided a subsistence of deer and small mammals,
along with seasonally available vegetal foods. Seasonal rounds within a restricted territory are
thought to typify the settlement pattern during this stage (Hsu 1969; Hsu et al. 1969:32; McCormick
1973:11â15, 1974:6; Northern 1981:6). These seasonal rounds may have served to permit the
interaction of populations, and fostered the diffusion of cultigens or other cultural innovations
(Story 1985:54).
Thurmond (1990) noted an increase in the frequency of Early Archaic components from the
Paleoindian period and that this increase in density continues at least until the Early Ceramic
period. Along Big Sandy Creek in Upshur County, Early Archaic sites appear to be distributed on
terrace and upland projections within major drainage basins (Perttula et al. 1986:50). Similar
patterns have been found elsewhere (Anderson 1973:162; Bruseth and Perttula 1981; Jones 1957).

Middle Archaic components are better represented in the sampled portion of the archeological
record than those from preceding periods (Bruseth and Perttula 1981; Johnson 1962; Voellinger
1984). Settlement patterns appear to be little changed from previous periods (Perttula et al.
1986:51), although site density appears to increase (Thurmond 1990). Within the Martin Lake mine
complex in Panola County, site 41PN76 may reflect a Middle Archaic occupation (Glander, Victor et
al. 1986:94, 95).
For the Late Archaic, there is a continued increase in site density, especially along tributaries to
major drainages (Perttula et al. 1986:52; Thurmond 1990). Perttula et al. (1986:52) suggest that
the more widely dispersed settlements in the region are indicative of a diffuse economy based upon
100013883/100196

30

3. Cultural Background
the hunting and gathering of local food resources. Northern (1981:7) suggests that fishing and
mussel collection intensified, and this intensification reflected a shift from a restricted wandering
community pattern to a more centrally based pattern. Numerous sites with Late Archaic
components have been excavated in the region (Bruseth and Perttula 1981; Duffield 1963; Johnson
1962; Jones 1957; Voellinger 1984).

Early Ceramic or Woodland Period (400 B.C.âA.D. 800)

The concept of an Early Ceramic or Woodland period is not new (Bell 1953; Fields and Thurmond
1980; Jelks 1965; Thurmond 1990; Webb et al. 1969; Wyckoff and Fisher 1985). Story (1990:293)
refers to it as the Early Ceramic period, and Perttula et al. (1986) refer to it generally as the
Woodland period. Significant Early Ceramic components have been identified at the Resch site
(41HS16) in southern Harrison County (Webb et al. 1969), the Folley site (41RK26) in northeastern
Rusk County (Jarvis 1972), the Haddens Bend site in southwestern DeSoto Parish, Louisiana
(Jensen 1968), the Coral Snake Mound (16SA48) in the Toledo Bend Reservoir area (McClurkan et
al. 1966, 1980), and the Yarbrough site and several sites in the Lake Fork Reservoir in Wood County
(Bruseth and Perttula 1981; Perttula and Skiles 1988). Perttula posits regional variation in food
subsistence technology based on an uneven distribution of ceramics and lithics during this period
(Perttula and Nelson 2006).

Generally, these sites are defined by sandy paste ceramics as well as wares associated with the
Tchefuncte, Coles Creek, and Marksville periods, probably introduced from the Lower Mississippi
Valley. In Titus County, Thurmond (1990) identified Marksville ceramics at site 41TT108 in the
Cypress Creek Basin. Both arrow points (e.g., Friley) and dart points (e.g., Gary and Kent) have been
recovered on Woodland period sites (Perttula and Nelson 2006). In Gregg County, Jones (1968:25)
identified a Troyville sherd from the Ware Acres site. Habitation features and subsistence data are
generally limited to pit features and burned rock concentrations (Perttula and Nelson 2006).

Caddo Period (A.D. 800â1680)

The succeeding period in northeast Texas is associated with the Caddo development. Wyckoff
(1974) visualizes Caddo culture as a peripheral recipient of the uniformities attributed to the
âMississippian Patternâ of the Lower Mississippi Valley. Caddo is recognized by the presence of
mound centers and village sites along the terraces of major streams. Horticultural, and eventually
agricultural, activities supplemented hunting and gathering activities. As defined by ritual burials
and trade networks, a stratified society was probably typical of Caddo culture.

Kriegerâs (1946) Gibson/Fulton aspect dichotomy was revised to the currently used five-period
Caddo sequence by the Eleventh Caddoan Conference in 1968 (Davis 1970). Caddo I and II relate to
Kriegerâs Gibson aspect, and Caddo III, IV, and V correspond to the Fulton aspect. Many problems
have arisen from the use of the five-period sequence, largely because it was devised to describe
cultural complexes rather than chronological assignment. Story (1990:324) has suggested
100013883/100196

31

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
abandoning the Caddo IâV terminology and replacing it with an explicitly defined temporal
framework of five subperiods:
Formative Caddoan â A.D. 800â1000

Early Caddoan â A.D. 1000â1200

Middle Caddoan â A.D. 1200â1400

Late Caddoan â A.D. 1400â1680

Historic Caddoan â A.D. 1680â1860

For reasons previously discussed, the division of Early and Late Caddo in the Martin Lake area is
similar to that proposed by Krieger in 1946 in his definition of the Fulton and Gibson aspects.
Thurmondâs division of the Early Caddo into periods 1 and 2 is similar to the chronological units
defined by Davis (1970) as Caddo I and Caddo II. Thurmond bases this separation on the
presumption that the ceramics of the Alto focus predate ceramics of the Sanders focus (Thurmond
1990). While not distinguished as phases within the Early Caddo, Thurmond (1990) equates the
Alto and Sanders foci to periods 1 and 2.

The Alto phase is the first distinctively Caddo cultural manifestation (Creel 1980; Story 1972). The
George C. Davis site (41CE19) on the Neches River is the type site. Although the later Caddo people
were agricultural, the presence of domesticated corn at the Davis site is suggestive of horticultural
activities. It was recovered from the site in conjunction with large quantities of hardwood nutshells
and deer bones, indicating it may not have been a main staple of their diet (Story 1981).

The production of a food surplus appears to be associated with the specialization of labor and the
communal support of a political or religious leader. Village sites were established in major river
valleys with, in some cases, accompanying mounds (Northern 1981:8). Alto sites are found from the
Brazos River near Waco (Watt 1953:57) to north-central Louisiana (Richner 1982:12). Funeral
practices indicate that status was important. Burials were extended in pits or in small mounds with
grave goods relative to an individualâs social position. Diagnostic lithic artifacts include Alba,
Bonham, Catahoula, and Scallorn points. Diagnostic ceramics include Davis Incised, Holly Fine
Engraved, Hickory Fine Engraved, Spiro Engraved, Kiam Incised, Weches Fingernail Impressed,
Coles Creek Incised, Crockett Curvilinear Incised, Pennington Punctated-Incised, and Dunkin
Incised (Clark and Ivey 1974:9; Thurmond 1990). Site 41PN45, found in the Martin Lake mine
complex in Panola County, may contain an Alto phase component (Glander and Brandimarte
1983:133â135). In Rusk County, Jones identified an Alto component from the Cherokee Lake site
(41RK132) (1968:59) and 41RK3 (1968:76). McDonald suggested an Early Caddo component
(Alto?) for 41RK30 and 41RK32 (1972:21).
The Sanders phase of the Early Caddo was defined for the Sanders site (41UR2) in Lamar County,
Texas (Krieger 1946). Sites are typically on terraces and knolls near water resources, but away
from major river drainages except at the upstream end (Northern 1981:9). Subsistence relied

100013883/100196

32

3. Cultural Background
heavily on deer and small mammals but was supplemented by agricultural activity, which is
evidenced by scapula hoes. Undecorated clay-grit-tempered ceramics, principally Sanders Plain,
predominate. Examples of decorated ware include Sanders Engraved, Canton Incised, and Hickory
Fine Engraved. Other decorated ceramics typical of northeast Texas during this period are
Monkstown Fingernail Impressed and Maxey Noded Redware (Clark and Ivey 1974:9; Thurmond
1990). Although no Sanders phase sites have been identified within the Martin Lake mine complex,
they have been recorded in the Troup Mine (Skinner et al. 1981), in Lake Fork Reservoir, and in the
upper Neches and Sabine river valleys (Anderson 1972; Skiles et al. 1980).

Clarence Webb (1948) defined the Bossier focus to refer to Caddo cultural developments in
northwest Louisiana and northeast Texas represented by about 50 sites. The core area of the focus
was centered around the Louisiana parishes of Bossier, Caddo, and DeSoto, to the east of the Liberty
Deposit Mine Area. Typical Bossier sites were thought to represent small villages and hamlets often
situated on terrace margins and lateral lakes of effluent streams near the valley of the Red River.
The focus is believed to have existed between the end of Alto and the subsequent Belcher times.
According to Webb (1983), radiometric assays indicate the transition from Alto to early Bossier
occurred between A.D. 1250 to 1350.

The Early Caddo saw the introduction of the bow and arrow (Perttula et al. 1986:54). Maize has
been recovered from flotation samples from Early Caddo sites, and settlement patterns seem to
consist of dispersed hamlets and farmsteads (Perttula et al. 1986:54â55).

Thurmond (1990) observes that ca. A.D. 1400, the elements of Caddo material culture, manifested
archeologically in ceramic and projectile point assemblages, differentiate along a line drawn
roughly north to south somewhat west of Caddo Lake in Harrison County, Texas. The observed
differences west to east are hypothesized by Thurmond (1990) to represent probable social groups.

The Late Caddo appears to be noted by an increase in regional variants. The Whelan and Titus
phases of the Late Caddo are proposed by Thurmond (1990) to represent the Cypress Cluster, a
culture that is hypothesized to represent a possible third Caddo confederacy. This unnamed
confederacy is in addition to the Hasinai and Kadohadacho confederacies (Swanton 1942) and is
hypothesized to be centered in the upper Cypress Creek drainage basin.

Thurmondâs model of the Cypress Cluster is derived from a sociopolitical settlement model for the
proto-historic and historic Caddo hypothesized by Story and Creel (1982). Story and Creelâs model
is based upon an interpretation of the archeological record with ethnographic analogy. Their model
is composed of two major levels: the affiliated group, which they term the âAnderson Cluster,â and
constituent groups. Like the hypothesized Cypress Cluster, the Anderson Cluster is analogous to a
Caddo confederacy in the vicinity of the upper Neches and Angelina rivers southwest of the Liberty
Deposit area. The constituent groups are equated by Thurmond (1990) with individual tribes
composed of multiple settlements, cemeteries, and limited-use areas.
100013883/100196

33

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
The Whelan phase is identified as the earliest formation of the Cypress Cluster (Thurmond 1990).
The Whelan phase is represented at several sites that were excavated as part of the salvage work
performed north of the Liberty Deposit area at Lake Oâ the Pines in Upshur and Marion counties,
Texas (Davis 1958; Jelks and Tunnell 1959). This phase is marked by the reduction in size of
ceremonial structures. Mounds were constructed over the burned remains of one or several
circular structures. Thurmond (1990) notes that at least three spatial clusters of Whelan phase
settlements, cemeteries, and limited-use areas existed in the Cypress Basin, each having one or
more mound components at its center. While Thurmond cites the possibility of this reflecting
survey bias, the possibility of these concentrations representing archeological manifestations of
three Cypress Cluster constituent groups during the Whelan phase should not be overlooked.
Common ceramic types of the Whelan phase include Ripley Engraved, Taylor Engraved, Maddox
Engraved, Maydelle Incised, Belcher Ridged, Bullard Brushed, and Pease Brushed-Incised (Clark
and Ivey 1974:9; Thurmond 1990). Alba, Perdiz, and Scallorn arrow points are also found in sites
attributed to the Whelan phase (Davis 1970; Thurmond 1990).
Cypress Cluster components of the Titus phase are hypothesized by Thurmond (1990) to extend
south to about the Sabine River. During the Titus phase, mound building was limited to
substructural mounds (Perttula 1997). Ceramics are almost exclusively grog tempered and include
Ripley Engraved, Taylor Engraved, Simms Engraved, Wilder Engraved, Harleton AppliquÃ©, Karnack
Brushed Incised, LaRue Neck Banded, and Bullard Brushed. Diagnostic lithics include Talco, Maud,
and Bassett arrow points (Clark and Ivey 1974:9; Thurmond 1990).

Another Late Caddo grouping, identified as the Frankston phase, is centered just west of the Liberty
Deposit area around the Neches River in Smith, Henderson, Cherokee, and Van Zandt counties.
House patterns have been reported from sites at Lake Palestine (Anderson et al. 1974:178â180),
and circular houses are a reported characteristic of this occupation (Davis 1958:37). In the upper
Neches River region, Frankston sites are described as small scattered hamlets with one to three
houses (Anderson et al. 1974:179). It is the Frankston phase and the succeeding Allen phase for
which Story hypothesizes the Anderson Cluster on the upper Neches and Angelina drainages (Story
and Creel 1982). Like Thurmondâs (1990) Cypress Cluster, the Anderson Cluster represents
essentially a shared sociopolitical interaction among constituent groups of the Late Caddo within
the cluster. Archeological components of Storyâs model represent major centers, lesser centers,
small villages and hamlets, and isolated farmsteads (Story and Creel 1982). The lesser centers of
this model are usually located near the center of an inhabited watershed (Story and Creel 1982).
The ceramics inventory of the Frankston phase includes Poynor Engraved, Bullard Brushed, and
Killough Pinched wares. Temper is coarse clay-grit, but occasionally pulverized bone or grog was
added. Perdiz points are common to the lithic inventory (Suhm et al. 1954).

3. Cultural Background

HISTORY OF RUSK COUNTY
Early Exploration and Settlement
European exploration in present-day Rusk County appears to have been concentrated in the
southwestern portion of the county, gradually expanding into other portions of the area. In the late
seventeenth century, Spanish explorer Domingo TerÃ¡n de los Rios led an expedition in what is now
east Texas with the purpose of exploring the land and establishing eight missions among the Tejas
Indians and neighboring Indian tribes. In November of 1691, TerÃ¡n traveled through Rusk County,
crossing the Angelina River in the countyâs southwest corner and continuing northeast through the
county to the Red River. The expedition reached a Caddo Indian settlement and returned in
December along the same route (Winfrey 1961).

A second expedition led by Captain Domingo RamÃ³n crossed the southwestern corner of present
day Rusk County between 1716 and 1719. Driven by fears of French encroachment, the Spanish
expedition, which included priests and soldiers, established six missions and a presidio in the
region. The southwest corner of the county was crossed again in 1760 by Fray JosÃ© Francisco
Calahorra y Saenz, a Spanish missionary who traveled towards two Tehuacana Indian villages along
the upper Sabine River. In 1788, an expedition commissioned by the governor of the province of
New Mexico and led by Pedro Vial crossed the northern region of Rusk County while exploring a
route from Santa Fe to Natchitoches, Louisiana. Although it does not appear that any early
European settlements were located in the Liberty Deposit, it is possible that European explorers
passed through the area during their travels.

The land that comprises the Liberty Deposit Mine Area includes several original land grants issued
at various times during the mid-nineteenth century (see Figure 15). Land in Texas was distributed
through the empresario system during the Spanish and Mexican periods of government. In Rusk
County, land began to be distributed officially during the Mexican period from 1821 to 1836
(Winfrey 1961). The first land grant issued in what is now Rusk County was given to William Elliott
on March 22, 1829, under the Law of Colonization of March 1825. Elliott received one league, the
equivalent of 4,428.4 acres, situated in the southeastern portion of what became Rusk County near
the present community of Lawsonville along the Angelina River. The second and third land grants
were issued to brothers Thomas and Leonard Williams in May of 1829. Both received one league
each situated along the Angelina River in what is now the Mount Enterprise community (Winfrey
1961).

The Mexican Decree of 1830 was passed on April 6 of that year, preventing further Anglo
colonization in the so-called Neutral Ground between the Neches and Sabine rivers. However, the
portion of the law prohibiting immigration was repealed 3 years later on November 5, 1833, during
a meeting in Saltillo, Mexico, between Santa Anna and Stephen F. Austin (Greaser 2003). Although
the prohibition on settlement in the area including Rusk County had officially ended, settlement
100013883/100196

35

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
proceeded at a slower pace between 1833 and 1834 when only three land grants were issued in the
county. Joseph Durst received one league of land along the Angelina River in May of 1833, and
Henry Stockman was granted two leagues on the west side the river in August of that same year. In
1834, William Williams received the only land grant issued in Rusk County. The following year;
however, 43 land grants were awarded. The majority were located on or adjacent to the two major
waterways in the region, the Angelina and Sabine rivers (Winfrey 1961).

After the Texas Revolution in 1836, Anglo settlers began to migrate into Texas in earnest, arriving
by way of Trammel's Trace, which divided the western boundary of present-day Panola County and
eastern boundary of Rusk County, paralleling current Rusk County Road 3231. The trail was named
for Nicholas Trammel, who reportedly used the trail to run stolen horses as early as 1813, though it
had been an established Native American trail for hundreds of years. Trammelâs Trace was one of
the major conduits from the U.S. Territories into Texas and connected the Southwest Trail at Fulton,
Arkansas. From there it continued southwest into Texas at Pecan Point (near Texarkana) then
turned southwest to Sulphur Fork in present-day Cass County then south, terminating at
Nacogdoches. The trace entered northeastern Rusk County at Rocky Ford on the Sabine River and
traveled south along the eastern boundary of Rusk County, passing near the present-day sites of the
Harmony Hill, Tatum, and Mount Enterprise communities (Winfrey 1961). A majority of the
immigrants traveling along the trail were heading for the fertile prairies of south central and
southeastern Texas where Stephen F. Austin, Sterling C. Robertson, and others had established
successful colonies. The land there was generally open with ample sources of water, making it
significantly more suitable for settlement and farming than the heavily forested terrain of northeast
Texas (Dixon et al. 2007).

The Plantation Economy and the Civil War in Rusk County and the Project
Vicinity

The Congress of the Republic of Texas formed Rusk County on January 16, 1843, from parts of
Nacogdoches County, with Trammelâs Trace demarcating its eastern boundary. The county was
named for Thomas Jefferson Rusk, who had been the Secretary of War under President Sam
Houston. The county seat was laid out near its geographical center (Knapp and Biesele 2010) close
to the early settlement of Gibsontown. General James Smith and William B. Ochiltree, early settlers
and plantation owners, donated the land for what became the community of Henderson. The men
named the town in honor of their friend James Pinckney Henderson, who became first governor of
the new State of Texas 2 years later (Winfrey 1961).

In 1850 Rusk County had approximately 8,148 residents, a sizable number for the state at the time,
and by 1860 it was the most populated county in the state, with an estimated 15,803 residents
(Winfrey 1961). Most of the new residents immigrated to the county from the southeastern United
States, most commonly from Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Georgia, Arkansas, Louisiana, and
Missouri (Lathrop 1949). These new settlers brought with them their social and economic
100013883/100196

3. Cultural Background
practices, including the plantation system of agriculture. This system not only characterized the
economy of the South, but influenced social and political development throughout the southeastern
United States. During the Mexican and Republic periods of Texas, both governments attempted to
prevent the spread of slavery by banning the importation of enslaved people from other countries.
However, it was legal to import them from other states, and the plantation culture persisted
(Campbell 1989). Many settlers from other states brought enslaved people with them, and many
others were illegally smuggled from foreign countries and brought north across trails, such as
Trammelâs Trace (Jackson 2008; Pirtle 2008; Silverthorne 1986).

Prior to the Civil War, several large plantations operated within Rusk County. Archival research
revealed that the project area may contain portions of at least two known plantations, the Trammell
Plantation and the Stroud Plantation. Archival records indicate that George Trammell owned a large
plantation in close proximity to the project area that likely included lands within the current study
area boundary. However; this research also suggests that the main improvements associated with
the plantation (probably including the main house and slave quarters) were not located within the
current Liberty Deposit Mine Area (see the history of sites 41RK609, 41RK610, 41RK617, 41RK637,
41RK649, and 41RK656 for more information about the Stroud and Trammell families).

Two of the Trammellâs ex-slaves, Millie Ann Smith and Harrison Boyd, participated in the Federal
Writers Project Slave Narratives. Smith indicated that George Trammell allowed some of the slave
families to work a small piece of land for themselves on Saturday afternoons and until midnight on
other nights (Waters 2003). This pattern of provisioning has been well documented throughout the
Caribbean and American South (Anderson 1998; Mintz 1974; Pulsipher 1990, 1993a, 1993b;
Westmacott 1992; Wilkie 1996), and in the Caribbean, many enslaved people were allowed to sell
their crops in the market (Anderson 2004; Wilkie 2000). At Trammellâs plantation, Trammell sold
any crops his slaves raised in Shreveport on their behalf (Waters 2003). This pattern may have
allowed enslaved people in the area to save enough money to purchase their own land after
Emancipation; within the current project area, there are several African American landowners that
bought land after 1870 and continued to pass it through their families well into the twentieth
century.

Another of Trammellâs slaves, Harrison Boyd, recounts that the primary crop grown on the
Trammell plantation was corn, and that it was milled and processed in Tatum, 10 miles from the
shucking site. The plantation also grew cotton (Waters 2003), which with corn appears to have
been the primary agricultural crops grown in the county. By 1858, 80,000 acres in Rusk County
were devoted to agricultural pursuits, with corn being the lead crop totaling around 37,500 acres,
and cotton a close second at 25,782 acres. Other profitable crops included wheat and sugarcane, as
well as miscellaneous crops, including fruit and vegetables (Knapp and Biesele 2010).
This agricultural system flourished, as on the eve of the Civil War, Rusk County was one of the
wealthiest counties in Texas, with enslaved people comprising and producing a large amount of this
100013883/100196

37

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
wealth. By 1860, Rusk County had one of the largest populations of enslaved people in the state.
Given the countyâs dependence on enslaved labor and the dominance of the plantation-based
economy, it is not surprising that the county voted overwhelmingly in support of secession, and a
large number of Rusk County men joined the Confederate Army, with 12 companies mustering in
Henderson (Knapp and Beisele 2010).
Like other places dependent on the plantation system of agriculture, Rusk Countyâs economy
collapsed after the Civil War. A severe drought also contributed to this decline in wealth (Knapp
and Beisele 2010). This downturn in the countyâs development is evident in agricultural production
totals as noted in the 1870 census (U.S. Bureau of the Census var.). Of 21 residents with an annual
income of $30,000 or more in 1860, only two remained 10 years later. The amount of improved
farmland dropped over 20 percent, and the yields of all but one of the countyâs principal crops
decreased from a decade earlier. Cotton, the one exception, attained even greater significance
during this period, as it was the most viable source of income for local farmers, including newly
freed slaves.
Although the Civil War signaled a period of hardship for Texas, it was spared much of the physical
destruction witnessed by the Deep South. In states such as Tennessee, Mississippi, and Georgia, the
decreased land values and loss of slave labor were coupled with the physical destruction resulting
from being on the front line of the war. Furthermore, these areas had engaged in exhaustive
agricultural practices for a long period prior to the war. During the postbellum period, many
displaced southerners saw Texas as a land of new opportunity, abundant cheap land, and rich soil.
Rusk County, like many other areas of the state, saw moderate increases in population during the
late 1860s and 1870s as farmers from the Deep South migrated to Texas (Knapp and Beisele 2010).

Transition to Tenant Farming and Development of African American
Communities in Rusk County

During the 1870s, Rusk County recovered from the drought and the effects of the Civil War. A major
impetus for the countyâs recovery was the 1872 arrival of the countyâs first rail line, the Illinois and
Great Northern Railroad (Knapp and Beisele 2010). This railroad reached Overton in the northwest
corner of the county by 1872 and Henderson by 1874. The railroad proved to be a major factor in
the growth of commercial and shipping hubs, such as Henderson, and it also had some effect on the
outlying areas. Rather than relying on arduous overland transport of their crops to distant
processing centers, rural farmers were able to ship them from Henderson. The railroads not only
increased the efficiency of farmersâ export process, it also increased their market access and
exposure to advanced farming implements, which further increased farming efficiency.

Although the arrival of the railroad created a more efficient farming system and provided increased
market access, the project area remained rural, and countywide prosperity never reached that of
the antebellum period. This economic shift was in part a reflection of the tenant farming and
100013883/100196

38

3. Cultural Background
sharecropping systems that developed after the Civil War. Often used interchangeably or defined as
subsets of one another, tenant farming and sharecropping both operated to allow people who did
not own land to have land to farm and to live on. In exchange for this land, tenants paid rent either
in cash or by providing part of their crop as payment (Wilson 1996). Sharecroppers provided labor
for the landowners, and received a share of the final crop, which was often brokered by the
landowner without the sharecropperâs input. This usually resulted in a cycle of dependency that
was difficult for the sharecropper to escape (Harper and Odom 2010).

A similar cycle often arose in tenant/landowner relationships. Tenants generally differed from
sharecroppers in that they paid the landowner for the use of the land either in cash or in crops, and
sometimes owned some or all of the necessary farming equipment. Tenant payment was often a
percentage of the crop yield and variable at the landownerâs discretion. This again created a system
similar to that of the sharecropper in which the tenant was beholden to the landowner, particularly
when the tenantâs crop yield was not as high as anticipated and agreed upon payments could not be
met. In such situations, the landowner could then seize equipment as payment, perpetuating the
cycle (Harper and Odom 2010; Wilson 1996).
Most freedmen who did not become involved in the sharecropping system moved to the segregated
communities adjacent to white towns to find work. However, a minority of these ex-slaves began
communities that became known as âFreedom Coloniesâ or âFreedmen Settlements.â These
settlements were often started by ex-slaves who had acquired enough wealth to purchase their own
land or by groups of squatters in far-removed places. These communities were usually spread
across large parcels of land and most often developed around a church, cemetery, and a school.
These freedmenâs colonies tended to be located in rural and remote areas on unimproved or
abandoned parcels or on land along county lines and other unincorporated properties. Residents
preferred these remote locations because the land was available, and the unmapped or unofficial
locations provided protection from those who might resent freed slaves owning property (Sitton
and Conrad 2005). Census research indicates that within the current project area, the community of
Liberty may have been associated with free African American settlement and property ownership
in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

Because of the isolated nature of these communities, census takers and other record keepers often
missed them entirely. However, in the late nineteenth century, historian Loren Schweninger wrote
that as of 1870, 1.8 percent of Texasâs black farmers owned their own property. By 1890, that
number rose to 26 percent, and by 1900, approximately 31 percent of black Texans owned their
own property. This ratio represents the height of property ownership by African Americans in
Texas following Emancipation. In the following years, these numbers would decline steadily (Sitton
and Conrad 2005).
Several African American landowners and late-nineteenth-century residents within the project area
appear to have ties to white families known to have operated plantations in the area or to white
100013883/100196

39

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
families who migrated to the area from the Deep South immediately following the Civil War. These
connections suggest that portions of the project area may represent Freedmen communities settled
by slaves from area plantations.

The Tatum plantation, located just north of the project area, was founded by Albert Tatum, whose
first wife was Rebecca Ann Menefee. According to genealogical sources, Rebecca Menefee died circa
1840 (Ancestry.com 2011). In 1849, Albert Tatum, his second wife Mary, their children, and several
slaves settled in the Harmony Hill area before moving to their large plantation home in 1850 (Rusk
County Historical Commission 1982). It is possible that some of the African American Menefee
family members who settled the area were either former slaves or descendants of former slaves of
the Tatum plantation, possibly acquired by Albert Tatum through marriage to Rebecca Menefee.

Another family with apparent links to an area plantation is the William Ballenger family (see
history of Luminant Tracts 591 and 591B, site 41RK619). Although the William Ballenger family
lived in close proximity to the Trammell Cemetery, located just beyond the current project
boundary, they are buried approximately 5 miles west of the project area in the New Prospect
Cemetery. This cemetery appears to be racially segregated, with African American burials located in
the southern portion of the cemetery, separated from the rest of the property by a metal fence and
accessed via a separate entrance. The northern portion of the cemetery, which is presumably the
white section, includes burials for Thomas and Mary Ballenger.

Thomas Ballinger [sic], originally from South Carolina, came to Rusk County in 1853 and settled
near the Oak Hill Community, east of the project area, where he co-founded the New Prospect
Baptist Church (Rusk County Historical Commission 1982). Ballenger is listed in the 1860 Rusk
County census as a 48-year-old farmer with $3,000 in real estate and $10,000 in his personal estate.
The high amount of land and personal property indicate that he likely operated a plantation in the
area. By 1870, census records indicate that Ballenger still resided in the area, but his personal
estate value had dropped to $500, which may in part be related to the loss of enslaved labor.
According to census records, William Ballenger, an African American farmer associated with site
41RK619 and Luminant Tracts 591 and 591B, was born in South Carolina in 1830. This fact, plus his
burial in the New Prospect Cemetery, indicates a possible link between the William Ballenger family
and the Thomas Ballenger plantation.
Although census records indicate that Jim Young, an African America farmer associated with site
41RK639, was born following emancipation, his ancestors may have been enslaved by William
Young or his relatives. William Young, the son of a prominent Georgia planter named Augustine
Young, settled near the Oak Hill area, west of the current project area in the early 1850s. His wife
Sarah Strong, was the daughter of John Strong, who owned 1,300 acres in the Church Hill area
(Rusk County Historical Commission 1982). It is possible that Jim Young was a descendant of one of
William and Sarah Youngâs former slaves.

100013883/100196

40

3. Cultural Background
Similar to Jim Young, historians note that it is possible that Peter Gray may have been a former
slave of a known early settler. Samuel Gray came to Rusk County in the 1850s and settled in
northern Rusk County. Several members of the Young family are buried in the Strong Cemetery in
Church Hill, near the project area.

Twentieth-century Development

In 1907, less than half of Rusk Countyâs farms were owner operated and the average farm size was
about 75 acres (Knapp and Beisele 2010), suggesting a tenant/sharecropper system was firmly in
place at that time. These figures suggest that the majority of farms in the county were operated by
tenants. Cotton continued to be the chief crop cultivated in Rusk County during the early twentieth
century and was the mainstay of the local economy as cotton demand continued to rise, particularly
during World War I. However, the drop in prices following the war coupled with the damage of the
boll weevil proved a devastating blow to cotton farmers throughout the state. The decline in cotton
culture continued in the 1920s when the federal government enacted crop stabilization methods
including acreage control, the introduction of synthetic fibers, and a high tariff on cotton (Britton et
al. 2010).

By the late 1920s, the cotton market had collapsed, and Rusk County farmers largely abandoned its
cultivation. Nevertheless, they had to continue to pay taxes on relatively unproductive tracts of
land. As a matter of necessity brought on by the declining cotton market, continued taxation, and
the effects of the Great Depression, many farmers either lost their land or were forced to adopt
more self-sustaining agricultural practices, which included production of smaller crops of
vegetables, fruits, and grains. Western Rusk County benefited greatly from the oil boom of the
1930s, but the project area was not exploited for oil and thereby did not develop as extensively as
the western part of the county. Farmers and ranchers in eastern Rusk County began exploiting
natural gas, timber, gravel, and clay deposits on their lands to replace income lost through the
decline in agricultural production and converted the remainder of their acreage to pasture for herd
animals. With the addition of lignite coal mining in recent decades, it is this pattern of combined
land use that continues today across the county (Winfrey 1961).

Communities near the Study Area

Several small communities were present within and near the project area. Some of these
communities are still recognizable, including Tatum and Church Hill. In other areas, such as Liberty,
Chapel Hill, and Dirgin, only vestigial remnants of former communities are evident.

Dirgin

Dirgin is a former community at the intersection of FM 2658 and County Road (CR) 2144,
approximately 14 miles northeast of Henderson. The town began in the 1880s, and received a post
office in 1898. It appears that the town experienced a small surge in development in the early
100013883/100196

41

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
1900s when it boasted two schools (one for the communityâs 33 white students and one for its 92
African American students), two general stores, and a sawmill (Odintz 2010). However, the
population began to decline in the 1910s, and the post office closed in 1914. The 1936 Rusk County
Highway map depicts the community as a small cluster including one commercial business, one
sawmill, and several farm dwellings (Texas State Highway Department 1936). The 1940s brought a
brief population increase to about 50 residents, and the town included a church, business, and a
number of scattered dwellings. The townâs population has been counted as 12 since the 1960 U.S.
Census (Odintz 2010). Only vestigial remnants of the community remain at the intersection of
FM 2658 and CR 2144. These include an abandoned commercial property and scattered abandoned
and occupied dwellings, barns, and mobile homes. A large area of the former community has
recently been utilized for open-pit lignite mining.

Harmony Hill

Harmony Hill was an early Rusk County community located approximately 15 miles northeast of
Henderson and 3 miles southwest of Tatum in northeastern Rusk County. The community was laid
out in the 1840s on land donated by John W. Kuykendall, a prosperous plantation owner of over
1,000 acres in the D. Martin headright, and quickly developed into an early commercial and
transportation hub. The town owes its early success to its location near several overland transport
routes including Trammellâs Trace, the Grand Bluff Road, and the old Wire Road. The first post
office was established in 1854 and closed in 1867, then reopened the following year. By 1860, the
town was thriving with 8 to 10 stores, a furniture factory, druggist, blacksmith, doctors, a school,
Masonic lodge, and a racetrack (Winfrey 1961). However, the townâs prosperity and population
began to decline in the 1870s when it was bypassed by railroads. Postal service was discontinued in
1905, and the community mail was sent to Tatum. The following year, a large tornado devastated
the community and destroyed most of the buildings (Biesele 2010a). The Harmony Hill Cemetery,
located off CR 2183, is the only remaining vestige of this community.

Tatum

The community of Tatum lies âtwenty-one miles northeast of Henderson, Texas, on the Rusk Panola
County lineâ (Biesele 2008), and approximately 16 miles from the Panola County seat of Carthage.
Tatum is named for Albert and Mary Tatum, plantation owners from Alabama who first settled in
Harmony Hill, a thriving trading town located 4 miles to the southwest (Williams 1984). In 1848,
the Tatums established a large cotton plantation at the intersection of Trammelâs Trace and Grand
Bluff Road. In addition to a large two-story main house, 80 small slave cabins, a gristmill, and a
sawmill stood on the grounds of their plantation (Mathis 2001). As of November 2007, the Tatum
Plantation home was still extant.

In 1882, the Santa Fe Railroad built a line through the region connecting Longview to Beaumont. By
1885, Albert Tatumâs son Paul (Uncle Fox) Tatum had platted the town site of Tatum and divided it
into lots. Paul Tatum had reportedly returned to his home after studying architecture in New York
100013883/100196

42

3. Cultural Background
City. Tatum became postmaster after the Tatum Post Office was established in 1886. The Old Miller
School, located 6 miles northwest of Tatum, was established by 1897. Hotels and mercantile
businesses were built and thrived due to the railroad. A tornado destroyed a portion of the town in
1904, followed by a fire in 1905 that claimed the north side of the community. At that time, the
communityâs population was 154. By 1925, the town had 428 residents. The communityâs
population was affected by both World Wars I and II because many of the men who left to fight
either did not survive or never returned to the small town. Oil and gas discoveries inside and
surrounding Tatum led to growth spurts in the 1950s and 1960s. The Texas Utilities Company, now
Luminant, moved to Tatum in 1977, building Martin Lake for cooling the companyâs Martin Lake
Steam Electric Station (Biesele 2008; Williams 1984).

Church Hill

The community of Church Hill was located near the intersection of FM 1251, CR 336, and FM 3135,
approximately 9 miles northeast of Henderson. The community began to develop in the 1850s,
serving the surrounding community of large plantations. The town included the Church Hill Male &
Female Academy, a Presbyterian school that was established by the Texas Legislature in
1854. Church Hill received a post office in 1893, but the town soon suffered a decline, and mail was
rerouted to Henderson in 1904. In 1895, the town had approximately 30 residents, a Methodist
church, and a general store (Biesele 2010b). The 1936 highway map of Rusk County depicts a
seasonal industry, a church, and several farm buildings in the vicinity (Texas State Highway
Department 1936). The community appears in a similar layout on the 1961 highway map for Rusk
County, indicating the communityâs development had stalled (Texas State Highway Department
1961).

Liberty/Chapel Hill

These communities appear as named places near one another on the 1958 topographic map, but
there is little other information available about them. Trammell Cemetery, located adjacent to the
project area within the Liberty and Chapel Hill community area, is also known as Chapel Hill
Cemetery and may be associated with the Chapel Hill Church. This cemetery is African American,
suggesting that these communities may have been associated with African American settlement.
Interestingly, these locations may represent an unofficial freedmenâs community that developed
around the church; the community name of Liberty also has connotations suggesting this may have
been the situation.

METHODS
FIELD METHODS
Atkins conducted an intensive archeological survey of 3,569.26 acres of the 3,865.94-acre Liberty
Deposit Mine Area between the months of March and November 2010 and in October and
November 2011. The research design previously submitted to the THC for this project (Sherman
2010) met state regulatory agency standards and included an intensive pedestrian survey
augmented with shovel tests and archival/historical research for those areas containing historic
sites.

Approximately 296.68 acres within the Liberty Deposit Mine Area, consisting primarily of home lots
and small tracts (1243, 1244, 1245, 1246, 1266, , 1319, 1320, 1321, 1322, 1323, 1324, 1327, 591, ,
1353, 1369, 1371, and 1372), were not surveyed during the initial field effort at the request of the
landowners. It is recommended that mine-related impacts to these properties be avoided. If this is
not feasible, it is recommended that these properties be subjected to intensive archeological survey
to determine if significant deposits are present.

All shovel tests were roughly 30 cm square and excavated to pre-Holocene substrates or to between
80 and 100 centimeters below the surface (cmbs). Shovel tests were screened using Â¼-inch
(0.635-cm) hardware cloth, except where clay-dominated soils were encountered. Clay-dominated
soils were finely divided by hand and excavated as deep as was feasible. Shovel tests were recorded
on Atkins shovel test forms. Shovel test locations were plotted with a hand-held GPS, along with soil
depth, and then transferred onto a topographic map in the field. This information was then used to
create a soil depth map intended to identify areas with deep soil that have the potential to harbor
deeply buried archeological deposits. No such areas were identified.

Particular attention was given to exposed cutbanks of creeks and drainages throughout the project
area in an effort to locate buried sites and note soil variation across the project area.

Each archeological site identified was fully documented and described in the field on Atkins field
forms and State of Texas Site Survey forms. Sufficient shovel tests were conducted on each site to
determine site boundaries, which were generally defined by two negative units or one negative unit
followed by a slope of over 20 percent. The boundaries of buried sites were determined by shovel
testing along the siteâs major and minor axes. The vicinity of standing structures was also a target
for shovel testing, as were large trees or stands of exotic vegetation on historic sites. The
boundaries of surface scatters were determined by the area of the visible scatter and, where
100013883/100196

45

appropriate, by shovel tests. A sketch map of each site was drawn with the aid of a compass, and
each site was photographed, with special attention to detail associated with historic architecture.

BURIED RESOURCES INVESTIGATION

Although no Holocene alluvial deposits are present within the survey area, as these have been
submerged by Martin Lake, an important research goal was to identify landforms that appear to
have aggraded significantly during the Holocene and have the potential to harbor deeply buried
cultural resource sites. No landforms that appear to have aggraded significantly during the
Holocene were identified. For this reason, no buried resources investigation within the boundaries
of the Liberty Deposit Mine Area is recommended.

PREHISTORIC CULTURAL RESOURCES

The project area was stratified into high, moderate, and low probability areas based on the
perceived potential of various landforms to harbor prehistoric archeological sites (Figure 13). The
probability areas were based on a combination of landform shape and proximity to water. These
areas were defined using the Tatum and Fair Play, Texas, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
topographic quadrangles and topographic data supplied by Luminant.

High probability areas (HPAs) included toeslopes above creeks and prominent rises on ridges.
These areas received 3.03 shovel tests per acre, generally placed on a 30-m transect interval.
Moderate probability areas (MPAs) included all relatively level landforms with a slope of less than
20 percent located within 200 m of a second-order or higher-order drainage. These areas received
1.47 shovel tests per acre, either placed on a 30-m transect interval or on topographic features (e.g.,
intermediate benches on steeper slopes) and geographic settings (e.g., confluences of streams)
considered favorable for prehistoric occupation. Low probability areas (LPAs) included the
remainder of the proposed project area and were subjected to judgmentally placed shovel tests
(0.81 shovel test per acre) focused on topographic rises, such as pimple mounds, which may not
appear on the USGS topographic quadrangles.
The model used to stratify the project area was adapted to conditions observed on the ground, and
shovel testing intensity was adjusted accordingly. Steeply sloped, heavily eroded, and inundated
areas were not subjected to shovel testing, nor were existing pipeline rights of way or well pads.

Based on the definitions above, the surveyed area included approximately 337 acres (10.0 percent)
of HPAs, 910.34 acres (26.9 percent) of MPAs, and 2,124.13 acres (63.0 percent) of LPAs.
Approximately 322 acres of the 3,371.64 acres of the proposed mine area surveyed (categorized as
LPAs) exists within the Martin Lake maximum pool area. Some of this acreage located within the

100013883/100196

46

4. Methods
maximum pool elevation of Martin Lake is forested wetland created by braided stream courses in
the southern portion of the project area.

Roughly 492 acres of the surveyed area were included in a previous survey conducted by the Texas
Archeological Salvage Project in 1972 prior to the impoundment of Martin Lake Reservoir.
Approximately 25 acres of the surveyed area consists of man-made ponds and stock tanks.

HISTORIC CULTURAL RESOURCES

Historic high probability areas (HHPAs) were developed by the project historian based on
examination of aerial photographs from 1935 and historic maps dating to 1958 to 1960, along with
archival research. HHPAs were subjected to four shovel tests per acre, generally placed at 10â30-m
intervals in four cardinal directions from the center of the HHPA. In some cases where testing of the
HHPA yielded negative results, topographic features considered favorable for historic occupation
nearby (e.g., hilltops) or stands of nearby vegetation likely indicative of previous occupation (e.g.,
groves of large oaks, crepe myrtles, or irises) were tested.

HISTORIC-AGE NONARCHEOLOGICAL RESOURCES

Project historians recorded 19 sites containing 28 historic-age nonarcheological resources within
the Liberty Deposit Mine Area boundaries. Each of these resources (excepting those located on
properties for which access was not granted during the survey) was shovel tested to determine if
subsurface deposits were present. Typically, this entailed the excavation of eight shovel tests in a
cruciform pattern around each standing structure.

During the survey, historians were also aware of the possibility for historic districts to exist within
the project area. Historians did not identify any potentially NRHP-eligible historic districts through
this effort. Historians also undertook a limited rural historic landscape analysis for the area, and it
was found to not maintain sufficient integrity to be eligible as a landscape.

For the purposes of this report, historic-age nonarcheological resources are those structures,
buildings, objects, or districts 50 years of age or older (built prior to 1961) that were not associated
with a recorded archeological site. Assessments of structures associated with recorded
archeological sites are included in Chapter 6.

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH METHODS

Prior to the initiation of archeological fieldwork, project historians reviewed historic maps and
aerial photographs of the project area in order to identify potential historic resources and to
develop HHPAs for locating historic archeological sites. Based on these HHPAs and the results of the
archeological fieldwork, historians obtained Luminantâs land records for each tract of land
containing a historic archeological site. These files, which were not available for every parcel,
100013883/100196

49

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
contained abstracts, chains of title in the form of title run sheets, and/or transcriptions or
photocopies of deed records and probate documents pertaining to each tract of land. Historians
relied on the land records provided by the Luminant real estate office and limited supplemental
records obtained from the Rusk County Courthouse.

Historians also consulted Texas General Land Office (GLO) records, the Handbook of Texas Online,
Rusk County and other Texas census records (1850â1880 and 1900â1930), Atkinsâ in-house map
collection, the Texas Historic Sites Atlas, and other secondary sources. These different sources not
only assisted historians in their efforts to correlate landowners with archeological sites, but also in
their attempts to learn whether any of the individuals associated with these sites were significant to
local community development.

Through the site-specific research, historians identified some distinct historic themes associated
with the current project area. As noted in the historic context section, most early Rusk County
settlers came from the lower Southern United States and established similar economic and social
patterns to those they had experienced there, including commercial cotton cultivation and a
dependency on enslaved labor during the antebellum period. After the Civil War, a system of
tenancy emerged in which many lower-class whites and blacks became socially and economically
dependent upon a few wealthy landowners. Though evidence of this pattern is apparent in the land
history of the project area, many of the recorded archeological sites were associated with African
American property owners, many of whom owned and occupied their property from the 1870s
through the early twentieth century. This group of property owners purchased land historically
associated with local plantations and created their own distinct community within the larger white
community, including their own churches, school, and cemetery. In fact, one of the historic African
American residents of the project area, the Barr family, donated the land for the local Chapel Hill
Church (Rusk County Deed Records 110:113). This community, alternately referred to as Chapel
Hill and Liberty, represented a social context and framework for its residents separate from the
institutions of their white neighbors. Sites within the current project area that maintain known
associations with African American property owners include 41RK609, 41RK610, 41RK617,
41RK636, 41RK637, 41RK649, 41RK650, 41RK648, and 41RK656. Despite their association with
this unique developmental pattern, none of the sites appears to possess sufficient integrity or
significance to merit individual NRHP listing.

Another distinctive pattern evidenced through population census research was the lack of physical
segregation in the project vicinity prior to the turn of the twentieth century. While white and black
residents maintained separate institutions, such as schools and churches, their homes and farms
were spatially integrated as represented in the 1870 and 1880 Rusk County census records.
Additionally, census records used a greater diversity of racial terminology during the nineteenth
century, with many residents being identified as âmulattoâ rather than as black. Beginning circa
1900â1910, African American and white residents were clustered along distinct roadways, and the
term mulatto no longer appeared as a racial type in the census records. Those individuals referred
100013883/100196

50

4. Methods
to as âmulattoâ in earlier records were referred to as âblack.â While it is unclear whether residents
were self-identifying with regard to their race in earlier census records, the enforced geographic
segregation and disappearance of âmulattoâ as a racial category during the twentieth century is an
interesting pattern that could be pursued in further study regarding local community development
patterns.

LABORATORY PROCEDURES AND ANALYSIS METHODS

All artifacts recovered during the survey of the Liberty Deposit Mine Area were bagged and labeled
in the field and brought back to the Atkins laboratory for processing and analysis. All recovered
cultural materials were processed, cataloged, labeled, and assigned to analytical categories, in
accordance with the curation standards of TARL.

All brick, ceramic, glass, lithic, and thermally altered rock artifacts were washed and catalogued
accordingly. Metal artifacts and faunal remains were not washed, but were dry brushed when
necessary. All specimens were initially categorized by period as historic, prehistoric, or unknown.

Prehistoric Lithic Artifacts

The assemblage of prehistoric lithic artifacts recovered during survey is composed almost entirely
of lithic artifacts (Figure 14). This lithic assemblage was placed into raw material categories based
on grain size and fracturing patterns. Evidence of thermal alteration, such as fracturing, increased
luster, and color changes, were also noted when present. Color was determined with the aid of a
Munsell color chart. When multiple colors were present on any one specimen, only predominant
colors were identified. This assemblage was subcategorized as tools and nontools.

Nontools

The assemblage of nontools consists of the lithic byproducts that result from the production, use,
and maintenance of lithic tools. This assemblage was subcategorized as debitage and cores. Lithic
debitage was further classified by reduction stage into chips as well as primary, secondary, and
tertiary flakes. Chips include all nonorientable blocky lithic fragments. The presence or absence of
cortex was noted for chips. Primary flakes are, ideally, the first flakes removed from a core, and
retain the exterior cortex on the dorsal side, a bulb of percussion with radiating lines of force on the
ventral side, as well as an identifiable point of applied force, or striking platform. Secondary flakes
have the above flake characteristics but retain cortex on 1 to 99 percent of the dorsal surface.
Tertiary flakes differ from the above categories by their complete lack of any cortex. Cores consist
of the byproducts of lithic reduction that evidence only negative scars of percussion.

100013883/100196

51

4. Methods
Debitage was also categorized by morphology into complete flakes, broken flakes, and flake
fragments. Broken flakes were subcategorized as proximal, medial, or distal fragments. Complete
flakes include all specimens that have a single interior surface, a bulb of percussion, a point of
applied force, and intact margins. Proximal flakes have the above characteristics except their distal
margins are not intact. Distal fragments include all specimens that retain the distal edge, but not the
point of applied force. Medial fragments include all specimens that retain the lateral margins, but
neither the point of applied force nor the distal edge. Flake fragments retain only a single interior
surface.
Thermal alteration was assessed based upon color, luster, and fracturing patterns. Specimens
exhibiting hues of red, increased luster, and/or fracture patterns consistent with exposure to heat
were considered to be thermally altered.

Tools

Chipped Stone Tools
The assemblage of chipped stone tools was assigned to the following categories: biface, bifacially
modified flake, dart point, unifacially modified flake, and utilized flake. In addition to the attributes
assessed for all lithic artifacts (color, form, and the presence or absence of thermal alteration), all
tools were examined under low-power microscopy in an effort to identify patterned use-wear. The
mass, maximum length, width, and thickness of each specimen were also recorded.

Dart Points

Three dart points were recovered during the survey. Two were recovered from site 41RK187 and
one was recovered from site 41RK629. All three points are representative of the Gary point type.
Gary points have elongated triangular blades and contracting stems for hafting to a shaft. This type
is thought to date to the Middle to Transitional Archaic/Woodland period (Turner and Hester
1985).

Bifaces

Chipped lithic artifacts that have flakes removed on both the dorsal and ventral faces are
considered bifaces. Bifaces lacking an identifiable haft element were categorized by reduction stage
following Dial and Collins (1998). Stage 1 bifaces are irregular in shape, retain large amounts of
cortex, and exhibit minimal to no thinning along the edges. Stage 2 biface are more symmetrical in
outline, retain minimal to no cortex, and exhibit minimal thinning. Stage 3 bifaces are symmetrical
in outline, retain no cortex, and exhibit secondary thinning. Biface fragments were not categorized
by stage.

100013883/100196

53

Liberty Deposit Mine Area

Bifacially Modified Flakes
Bifacially modified flakes are pieces of lithic debitage that exhibit intentional modification, often in
the form of pressure flaking on both faces of the artifact along one or more edges. These tools
commonly exhibit evidence of wear along the modified edge.

Unifacially Modified Flakes

Unifacially modified flakes are lithic debitage that exhibit intentional modification along one or
more edges restricted to only one face. This modification is often evidenced by regular patterns of
pressure flaking. Tools in this category often exhibit evidence of wear along the modified edge.

Utilized Flakes

Utilized flakes are lithic debitage that exhibit use-wear on one or more edges but lack intentional
modification, such as pressure flaking.

Ground Stone Tools

Ground and battered stone tools are generalized tools in the sense that a single tool may not be
functionally specific with regard to the manner in which it is used or the things it is used to process
or prepare. To systematically classify these tools, it is important to use well-defined criteria for
recognizing their diverse nature and possible function. Since a variety of processes can produce
distinctive wear, tools were assigned to specific analytical categories on the basis of several key
variables: the mechanical processes, the outcome of those processes, and the material being
processed. Microscopic examination of each tool aided in the identification of the key mechanical
processes and the subsequent wear patterns still visible on the tool. Because any specific tool can
be used in a range of activities, multifunctional tools were categorized on the basis of the
predominant type of wear still visible on the tool.

Prehistoric Ceramics

Because the majority of recovered ceramics were small, undecorated fragments, analysis of the
recovered ceramics focused primarily on their technological aspects and the observable modes that
would aid in a more detailed classification of the ceramics. When whole vessels or sherds large
enough to exhibit overall design motifs are present in an assemblage, typological classifications are
possible. In the absence of whole vessels or vessel sections large enough to discern typologically
distinct decorative motifs, one way to distinguish subtle differences between relatively similar
ceramics is to look at the technological variations found on individual sherds (see Brown 1998;
Lechtman 1977; Livingood 2007; Rice 1987; Shepard 1976; van der Leeuw 1984). Research
indicates that for Caddo potters, variations in key technological attributes such as temper, surface
treatment, and thickness bear a direct relationship to the desired use of the pot (see Perttula 2001,
100013883/100196

54

4. Methods
2004; Rogers and Perttula 2004). Thus, sherds recovered from each site were characterized
according to a suite of key technological attributes.

The technological attributes recorded for each sherd in the analyzed sample included (1) paste
constituency involving identification of the type of nonplastic inclusions (i.e., sand, bone, grog), the
predominant size range of nonplastic inclusions (i.e., medium sand, fine sand, very fine sand) and
texture; (2) exterior and interior surface treatment; (3) exterior and interior decorative treatment;
(4) morphological class (i.e., body, base, or rim); (5) average thickness; and (6) firing environment
(i.e., oxidizing or nonoxidizing). Each of these attributes provides key information about the
technological variability observed on the recovered ceramics. This information enables finergrained typological and technological distinctions, which in turn allow the analyst to more fully
characterize the assemblage even in the absence of identifiable types, thereby providing a basis for
placing the ceramics within a broader regional ceramic context.

Historic Artifacts

All historic artifacts were initially categorized by material and then subcategorized by use context,
artifact type, stylistic description, technological attributes, color, form, and surface treatment.
Recovered material types include brick, ceramic, metal, glass, mortar, rubber, and shell.
Use context categories follow South (1977:92â102). The categories employed for the Liberty
Deposit historic assemblage include agriculture, architecture, clothing, household, kitchen, and
personal. Any items that could not be positively identified as belonging to any one category were
simply listed as unknown. Specific attributes recorded for each material type are discussed below.

Ceramics

Use contexts represented in the Liberty Deposit ceramic assemblage include architecture,
household, kitchen, and personal groups. All ceramic artifacts were classified by ware type. Ware
types encountered during the survey include whiteware, ironstone, semiporcelain, porcelain,
stoneware, coarse earthenware, and pipes. Distinguishing traits of each ware type are discussed
below.

Whiteware

Whiteware is a refined earthenware with a colorless to blue-tinted glaze. Whiteware is very similar
to ironstone but has a slightly softer paste, which measures less than 2.5 on Mohâs Scale of
Hardness. Whiteware was first produced in England in 1810 and became widely popular in the
United States by the 1830s (Stelle 2010). Whiteware remains in production today. The only variety
of whiteware encountered during the survey is undecorated, which is not temporally sensitive.

100013883/100196

55

Liberty Deposit Mine Area

Ironstone
Ironstone, like whiteware, is a refined earthenware. It also has a colorless to blue-tinted glaze, but
with a slightly harder paste than whiteware, that measures 2.5 or higher on Mohâs Scale of
Hardness. The introduction of ironstone to the United States by 1842 was followed by a decrease in
the popularity of the less durable whiteware (Stelle 2010). A wide variety of ironstone types was
recovered including undecorated, decalcomania, fiestaware, hand painted, molded, shell edge,
transfer print, and yellow glazed. None of these varieties, with the exclusion of shell-edged wares
and wares with identifiable decorative motifs, are particularly temporally sensitive. The various
techniques used to create the shell edge are temporally sensitive.

Semiporcelain

Semiporcelain is a refined earthenware that also has a colorless to blue-tinted glaze. This ceramic
type has a harder, more-vitrified paste than ironstone, and is stronger and more durable.
Production of semiporcelain began around 1860 and continues today (Ketchum 1987). Both
molded and undecorated semiporcelain sherds were recovered. None of these materials are
temporally sensitive.

Porcelain

Porcelain is the most highly vitrified ceramic, originating in Japan and produced by European
potters after 1800 (Stelle 2010). These specimens are distinguished by their paste, which has
miniscule to no inclusions and appears almost glasslike. Varieties encountered during the survey
include molded, appliquÃ©d, and undecorated specimens, none of which are temporally sensitive.

Stoneware

Stoneware is often produced with locally available clays and has a harder, more-vitrified paste than
that of earthenware. Bristol-glazed stoneware, which is distinguished by a thick white to creamcolored glaze, was introduced in 1880 and remains in production today (Stelle 2010). Though
Bristol glaze alone is not temporally sensitive, when paired with an Albany slip or slip glaze variety,
it generally predates 1920 (Greer 1981).

Variations in Albany-slipped stoneware, which is identified by its chocolate-brown hue, were
produced throughout the latter half of the nineteenth century and ceased in production
approximately in 1940 (Greer 1981). These variations include slips, slip glazes, and the slip-glazed
frogskin variety. The frogskin variety is distinguished by its greenish yellow glaze, which, like its
namesake, resembles the texture of frog skin, is achieved by introducing salt into the kiln during
firing of a vessel that already has an Albany variation applied to it.
Alkaline-glazed stonewares are distinguished by their glasslike and crazed appearance. This
treatment is effected by a combination of wood ash, clay, and sand. Color can vary depending upon
100013883/100196

56

4. Methods
the amount of naturally occurring iron that exists in the particular mixture, but is most common in
olive-green or gray hues (Greer 1981). The tobacco-spit variation of the alkaline glaze is also
glasslike and crazed, but has a brown hue imparted by the minerals introduced with the tobacco
added to the mixture.

Salt glazes, identified by their orange-peel texture, were widely produced throughout the
nineteenth century but began to fall out of popularity around 1875, especially those vessels that
were salt glazed on both the interior and exterior (Lebo 1991). While this glaze is easily produced
with the addition of salt to the firing environment, it can be more expensive to produce than the
other varieties due to the fluctuations in the price of salt.
The Rockingham glaze is thick, brown, and mottled. This variety became available in the United
States after 1788 and remains in production today. Its height of popularity, however, extended from
about 1840 to 1900 (Stelle 2010).

Various untyped slips were also observed. The same clays utilized in the paste of the stoneware
were often utilized in the slip as well.

Coarse Earthenware

Coarse earthenware, like stoneware, is also often produced with locally available clays. Unlike
stoneware, it has a more porous paste and is fired at much lower temperatures, making surface
treatments such as slips or glazes necessary (Greer 1981). Varieties recovered include decorated
and hand-painted specimens along with undecorated Bristol-glazed specimens, neither of which
are temporally diagnostic.

Clay Pipes

Clay smoking pipes imported from England were generally made of kaolin and typically have a
small bowl and long stem, as commonly found at colonial sites. Evidence of pipe manufacture in the
eastern United States has been found as early as the late eighteenth century. Potteries in Texas may
have also produced clay tobacco pipes on a small scale mainly for the personal use of potters and
their assistants and would likely be produced from locally available clays (Davey 1979).

Glass

The glass assemblage was broadly categorized by function and subcategorized by specific
functional details. Other technological attributes observed include color, fragment form, and
thickness.

Functional categories represented in the glass assemblage include bottle, jar, jar lid liner, lighting,
vase, vessel, and flat glass. Bottles were identified by one or more of the following: amber, brown,
or very dark olive color, embossing that alludes to vessel contents, or retention of a representative
100013883/100196

57

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
bottle form, such as a rim, lip, shoulder, or base. Specimens identified as jar lid liners met one or
more of the following criteria: flat disc shape, opaline color, or embossing that identifies marks of
known jar lid liner forms. Specimens identified as jugs have a rim with an applied handle.
Specimens identified as jars have threaded rims. Specimens identified as lighting retain either the
form of a chimney lamp or a light bulb, or are very thin and curved. Specimens identified as vases
are hollowware vessels with no form of enclosure. Vessel glass includes all curved glass specimens
that cannot be attributed to any other containment variety. Flat glass is completely flat on both the
interior and exterior of the specimen.

Glass subcategories include chimney lamp, depression glass, embossed, milk glass, molded, pressed,
and window glass. Chimney lamp glass fragments are very thin, curved specimens from the outer
glass lamp covering of a kerosene lantern. While kerosene lanterns are still in production today,
they were used most widely between 1860 and 1880 (Spillman 1983).

Depression glass is colored pressed glassware that was manufactured from the 1920s into the
1970s (Schroy 2007). Embossed glass has raised images and/or text. Although the use of
embossing itself is not temporally sensitive, the images depicted sometimes are. Flat glass
specimens that had a consistent thickness across the entire fragment were considered window
glass. Milk glass includes all opaline-colored glass that does not represent jar lid liners. Milk glass
remains in production today but was most popular from 1870 through 1920 (Stelle 2010). Molded
glass has decorative elements imparted from the mold in which it was made. Pressed glass is glass
that was pressed into an open mold when molten. The patterns represented on complete or nearly
complete specimens are often temporally sensitive.
Technological attributes observed in the glass assemblage include the presence of air bubbles
within the glass and evidence of burning. Glass containing bubble inclusions usually has a
production date prior to 1920 (Rosenberg and Kvietok 1981).

Glass color can be temporally sensitive. Technologies within the glass-making industry have
changed over time with the introduction of different minerals and compounds in the production
process to achieve specific colors. Colors encountered during the survey include amber, aqua, aqua
tint, cobalt blue, colorless, colorless-solarized, dark amber, green, green tint, light blue, opaline, and
very dark olive. Amber, green, green-tint, and colorless glass are not temporally sensitive as they
remain in production today and have long production ranges.

Solarized glass is often referred to as âamethystâ glass. Manganese was used in the glass production
process from about 1880 through 1918 (Stelle 2010) to enhance clarity in colorless glass.
Prolonged exposure to the sunâs ultraviolet rays causes a chemical reaction with the manganese
and tints the glass a distinct amethyst color. By the early twentieth century, the introduction of
arsenic or sodium nitrate into the glass production process eliminated impurities making it
possible to obtain colorless glass (Kendrick 1963).
100013883/100196

58

4. Methods
Olive-hued glass can be a temporal indicator. This type of glass is often recovered from sites
predating the twentieth century (Society for Historical Archaeology [SHA] 2010). Olive glass is
considered a natural glass color, because it gets its color from the natural iron oxides found in the
sand used to produce it.

Some glass colors can suggest an occupation date based not on production range but primarily
upon their height of popularity. Aqua glass, for example, is currently in production but was at its
most popular prior to 1920 (SHA 2010). Similarly, opaline glass is still in production today but was
most popular from 1870 through 1920 (Stelle 2010). A wide variety of blue glass colors have been
produced and remain in production. However, the bright blue colors were more common prior to
1930 (SHA 2010).

Metal

Due to oxidization of most metals, attributes of metal artifacts are often difficult to discern. When
discernible, the following attributes were evaluated: material, category, description, and form. The
following use contexts are present in the metal assemblage: agriculture, architecture, clothing,
household, kitchen, and unknown.
Nails were the only temporally sensitive metal artifacts recovered. Wire nails were introduced
during the first quarter of the nineteenth century but did not replace cut nails until the last decade
of the century (Adams 2002). Well-preserved cut nails can retain attributes that are temporally
sensitive, as illustrated in Table 2. It should be noted, however, that production ranges can differ
significantly from use and discard dates.

Bricks
Brick artifacts were distinguished by manufacturing technique, color, form, and surface treatment.
Two brick manufacturing techniques are present in the brick assemblage, hand-made and machinemade. Hand-made bricks have a long production range, but were generally replaced by machinemade bricks by the twentieth century (Steinbomer 1982). Color was assigned with the aid of a
Munsell color chart. When multiple colors were present on any one specimen, only predominant
100013883/100196

59

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
colors were listed. Bricks were categorized as complete or fragmentary. All brick artifacts that are
not 100 percent complete were considered fragments. Surface treatments identified on brick
artifacts include burning and glazing. Alkaline glaze is the only glaze type present in the brick
assemblage. The primary component of an alkaline glaze is ash (Greer 1981). An alkaline glaze on
bricks may develop as a result of its use on the interior of a ceramic kiln or fireplace or from its
original firing conditions. The glaze is not necessarily an intentional decorative element nor is it
temporally sensitive.

Unknown Artifacts

Some of the materials recovered during the survey have clearly cultural origins but could not be
unambiguously attributed to either the prehistoric or historic periods. It is, however, assumed that
when these materials occur on a single-component site that they represent that component. These
materials include burned clay, carbon samples, faunal remains, and thermally altered rocks.

Burned Clay, Faunal Remains, and Carbon Samples

The only attribute recorded for burned clay was color, which was assigned with the aid of a Munsell
color chart. The material type of carbon samples was identified when possible. The mass of carbon
samples was also determined. All carbon removed from one level of one shovel test was recorded as
a single sample, regardless of the number of fragments. Faunal remains were identified by species,
type, and form when sufficiently complete.

Thermally Altered Rocks

Thermally altered rocks exhibit signs of heating that include color, luster, and fracturing. All of the
thermally altered rocks recovered were categorized either as burned rocks or fire-cracked rocks.
Thermally altered rock specimens exhibit one or more of the following: increased luster and/or
color change associated with heat alteration, evidence by hues of red on all or part of the specimen,
and heat fracturing.

RESULTS OF THE ARCHIVAL RESEARCH
The results of the archival investigation are presented below by tract number. A summary of the
results is included in Table 3 at the end of this chapter. Figure 15 shows the locations of the
Luminant tracts in the project area.

EARLY HISTORY OF THE ELIJAH ALLRED SURVEY, RUSK COUNTY ABSTRACT
53 (LUMINANT TRACTS 572E, 594I, 594J, 1355, 1360, 1361, AND 1367)

The 68-acre tract containing sites 41RK630 and 41RK631, the 110.4-acre tract containing site
41RK638, the 7.02-acre tract containing site 41RK611, the 42-acre tract containing site 41RK626,
the 9.091-acre tract containing sites 41RK651 and 41RK653, the 15.16-acre tract containing site
41RK647, the 18.32-acre tract containing site 41RK612, and the 9.32-acre tract containing site
41RK654 are all located within the original Elijah Allred Nacogdoches 2nd-class headright in Rusk
County, Texas (spelled Albread on Figure 16). Second-class headrights were issued to individuals
who arrived in Texas between March 2, 1836, and October 1, 1837. The grants entitled heads of
household to 1,280 acres, and single men received 640 acres (GLO n.d.). Allred patented his grant
on September 3, 1850. Although he only received 640 acres, contemporary census research
suggests he may have been a widower and that he did not live on his holdings in Rusk County.
Elijah Allred (48) appears in the 1850 Panola County census as head of a household containing a 6year-old girl named Kissiah [sic] Allred. Elijah was a farmer and possessed $1,800 worth of real
estate. Although historians were unable to find an entry for Allred in the 1860 Texas census
records, subsequent deed records confirm that the girl was his daughter. In 1867, Allred conveyed
his entire survey (640 acres) to his daughter Kiziah Allison. The record indicates that both parties
were residents of Panola County, and Kiziah and her husband Samuel G. Allison appear as residents
of the Fair Play post office precinct in the 1860 Panola County census (Rusk County Deed Records
Q:288). Any occupants of the survey during its association with the Allred/Allison family would
have been tenants and/or squatters.

Sites 41RK630, 41RK631, and 41RK638

In 1887, Kiziah Allison and her husband S.G. conveyed 205 acres containing the subject 110.4- and
68-acre tracts containing sites 41RK630, 41RK631, and 41RK638 to J.E. Ross, a resident of Rusk
County. The Allisons resided in Wise County, Texas, at the time of the conveyance (Rusk County
Deed Records 40:541) and appear as residents of Panola County in the 1880 Texas census records.
100013883/100196

61

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
Their lack of association with Rusk County during the period they owned the property suggests that
they never lived there.

The J.E. Ross family retained ownership of the 205 acres through the twentieth century, and they
likely constructed/occupied the circa 1890s farmstead located on the 68-acre tract (the remnants
of which were recorded as site 41RK630). Subsequent probate records related to Rossâs heirs
indicate that this was the first piece of property he purchased; he did not buy a second until circa
1900 (Rusk County Probate Records Cause #3452). Additionally, partition deeds associated with
the documents suggest that the Ross family maintained close ties with the nearby community of
Church Hill and the Church Hill United Methodist Church, which are located to the southwest of the
current project area (Rusk County Deed Records 1529:534). Ad valorem tax research could confirm
whether the 205 acres was the only property J.E. Ross owned during the nineteenth century.

There is no census data for 1890, but in 1900, Dr. J.E. Ross (41) appears as a resident of Justice
Precinct 3, which contained the current project area, in the Rusk County census. His household
included wife M.E. (31) and children Grady (9) and Mary (5). Ross owned his property. In 1910, the
family still lived in Justice Precinct 3 along the Henderson and Church Hill Road. Subsequent deeds
describe this road as bordering the tract containing sites 41RK630 and 41RK631. In that year, Jesse
E. Ross (51) is described as a physician, and his household included his wife, indexed as Bettie (41),
their children Grady (19), Mary Lou (15), and Jesse (6), and Lee Ware, a 19-year-old African
American farm laborer. By 1920, the family had relocated to Henderson and lived on N. Marshall
Road. Jesse E. Ross (61) worked as a medical doctor and lived with wife Mary E. (50), son Jesse E. Jr.
(15), a boarder and schoolteacher named Sallie Ross (38), and Jennie Straughton, a 43-year-old
African American cook.

J.E. Ross died in Houston, Texas, on May 6, 1927 (Rusk County Deed Records 205:295), and his wife
inherited the subject property. It appears in a 1938 inventory and appraisement of her estate
where it is listed as the first parcel her husband purchased in Rusk County (Rusk County Probate
Cause #3452). In a subsequent partition of her estate, the parcel was conveyed to her son Grady B.
Ross and daughter Mary Lou Ross Carter as their joint property (Rusk County Deed Records
374:596). It does not appear that either individual resided on the tract. Subsequent conveyances
and probate records reveal that Grady Ross, who owned numerous parcels of land in various
counties throughout the state, lived in Galveston County and the town of Henderson during his
adult life (Rusk County Probate Records Cause #5240). Similarly, Mary Lou and husband R. Bruce
Carter resided in Houston during their association with the tract (Rusk County Deed Records
1096:668). As a result, any occupants of the property after circa 1920 would have been tenants.

The parcel remained in the family through at least 1988. In that year, it was partitioned between R.
Bruce Carterâs second wife Helen Louise Reeves Carter and Mary Ross Graham, the daughter of
Mary Lou and R. Bruce Carter. Mary Ross Graham, a resident of Houston, received the 68-acre tract
100013883/100196

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
containing sites 41RK630 and 41RK631, while Helen Louise Reeves Carter received the 110.4 acres
containing site 41RK638 (Rusk County Deed Records 1631:270).

Results Summary and Analysis: Archival and archeological evidence suggests that sites 41RK630,
41RK631, and 41RK638 were likely associated with occupation and/or use of the land by the
Dr. J.E. Ross family from circa 1887 through the twentieth century. The remnants of the circa 1890s
farmstead recorded as site 41RK630 likely represent the late-nineteenth/early-twentieth-century
homestead of the Ross family, who moved to Henderson between 1910 and 1920. After their
relocation, the parcel containing the sites may have been used for agricultural purposes and/or
leased out to other unknown tenants. Prior to 1887, the property was associated with the
Allred/Allison family, who lived in Panola County. Any occupants during this early period would
have been tenants or squatters, though archeological evidence suggests the sites date from the
Rossesâ tenure of ownership. These sites have no known associative significance that would qualify
them for NRHP listing under Criterion A or B.

Site 41RK630 also has a structural component. The site includes the remnants of a latenineteenth/early-twentieth-century farmstead including four historic-age standing structures: a
dwelling (A), two barns (B and C), and an outhouse (D). Resource A is a circa 1890, L-plan singlefamily dwelling. This resource is clad in wooden board-and-batten siding with clapboards in the
gable ends. Most of the doors and windows are no longer extant, but there are remnants of 6/6
wood-sash windows and two paneled wooden doors with wooden screen doors in one gable end
within a collapsed porch. The resource has an exterior brick chimney on one of the secondary
faÃ§ades. Resource B is a front-gabled, three-pen, circa 1930 barn. This resource has a replacement
metal roof with horizontal wooden siding and is partially reclad in wooden paneling. Resource C is
a circa 1900, two-pen log barn. This resource has saddle-notched construction with clapboards in
the gable ends. Resource D is a circa 1935 outhouse. This resource has a shed roof and replacement
corrugated metal walls. The door is no longer extant.
None of the resources appears to qualify for listing in the NRHP. Resources A and C lack integrity of
materials, design, and workmanship due to their derelict condition and partial collapse, and
resources B and D do not possess architectural or design distinction. Despite their potential
association with the Ross family, there is no evidence that the Rosses were significant to local
community development. The resources are not recommended for inclusion in the NRHP under
Criterion A, B, or C.

Sites 41RK651 and 41RK653

Though the associated Luminant tract file for the parcel containing sites 41RK651 and 41RK653
does not record a conveyance prior to 1881 when Jesse W. Brooks conveyed 180 acres of land in
the Elijah Allred Survey to Emily Brooks (Rusk County Deed Records 31:318), it is likely that the
Allredsâ daughter Kiziah Allison sold him the property. As indicated in the introduction to this
100013883/100196

66

5. Results of the Archival Research
section, Kiziah and S.G. Allison owned the entire Allred Survey by 1867, though they never lived in
Rusk County, and Allison sold two adjacent 105- and 150-acre portions of the Allred Survey to
Brooks in 1879 and 1881, respectively (see history of sites 41RK626, 41RK627, and 41RK647).

Contemporary census records reveal that Emily Brooks was Jesse Brooksâs mother. In 1880, Jesse
Brooks (35) appears as the head of a household containing his wife Ann (28), their children Oliver
(9), Arizona (6), and Calvin (5 months), and his mother Emily (67). In 1886, when the boys were
still minors, Emily Brooks conveyed the 180 acres to Ollie Brooks and Calvin Brooks for $540 cash
in hand paid by Jesse W. Brooks (Rusk County Deed Records 38:251). The parcel does not appear in
the deed record again until 1940 when the brothers officially partitioned the property between
themselves. Ollie Brooks received the northern half of what was called a 181-acre tract (90.5 acres),
and Calvin Brooks received the southern half containing sites 41RK651 and 41RK653 (Rusk County
Deed Records 342:285).

Census research suggests that Calvin Brooks lived in the project vicinity near his father and several
siblings through at least 1930. Deed research for the tracts containing sites 41RK626, 41RK611,
and 41RK647 indicate that the Brooks family owned adjacent 105- and 180-acre tracts in the Allred
Survey. The extended Brooks family could have been living on and cultivating these holdings, and
ad valorem tax research could reveal how much property the family owned in the area and a
general timeline of their property acquisition.
In 1900, Cal Brooks (20) lived with his brother Brutus (18) near his father Jesse and several of his
siblings. His father lived with his new wife Mollie and their four children two households from his
daughter Sallie Grant and three households from his son Ollie Brooks, all in Justice Precinct 3, which
contained the current project area. Two families of renters lived between Jessie and Ollie Brooks,
suggesting the family may have employed tenants on their property. Jesseâs daughter Arizona Ross
and her husband Wm. L. also lived in the area though not immediately adjacent to her father. All of
these individuals owned their property.

In 1910, the family members still lived in immediate proximity to each other on the âHenderson to
Marshall Road.â It is unclear where this road was located in 1910, but by 1936, a state highway
between Henderson and Marshall was located to the northwest of the current project area (Texas
State Highway Department 1936). In that year, Cal Brooks (32) appears as a property owner living
two households from his father. He did not head his own household, but rather was a boarder in the
household of Charlie Freeman, who rented his farm. The household also included Freemanâs sisters
Mandy Freeman (28) and Fannie Dickson (32) and Fannieâs children Turner (12) and Bonnie (10).
Turner and Charlie both worked on the home farm, possibly on the property owned by Calvin
Brooks. Calvinâs father, Jess W. Brooks, lived with wife Mollie and six children two households from
Ollie Brooks, who lived alone one household from the John P. and Sallie Grant family. A family of
renters lived between Jess and Ollie Brooks. Jesseâs daughter Arizona Ross and her family were
enumerated on the previous census sheet only a few households from the rest of the family living
100013883/100196

67

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
along the âHenderson to Carthage Road.â The family lived near other suspected project area
residents, the Barr family (see history of sites 41RK609 and 41RK649).

In 1920, Calvin, J.W., and Ollie Brooks still lived near each other on the Dirgin Road. This road
appears to be the same road described as the Henderson to Marshall Road in 1910. The men are
described as living in the Church Hill voting precinct, which is the small farming community
historically located nearby and to the southwest of the project area. Calvin again boarded in the
household of a family of renters headed by Willie Jourdan and lived one household from his father.
Other members of the household included Jourdanâs children Harmon (20) and Ada (18). By 1930,
Calvin (50) had married and lived with his wife Josie D. (23) on the Liberty to Chapel Hill Road,
which appears to be another name for the Dirgin Road. He owned his farm and was surrounded by
numerous families renting their property.

Calvin Brooks retained the property until 1956 when he conveyed 19.7 acres containing the subject
tract to his son C.L. Brooks for $10 (Rusk County Deed Records 571:215). The rest of the 90.5-acre
tract was inherited by his daughter Shirley Brooks Gentry in 1963 (Rusk County Deed Records
790:102). The property remained in the Brooks family for the remainder of the twentieth century,
and sites 41RK651 and 41RK653 were likely associated with some aspect of their occupation
and/or use of the land.

Results Summary and Analysis: Archival evidence suggests that sites 41RK651 and 41RK653
were created by and/or associated with the Brooks family during the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries. Calvin Brooks, who owned the property by 1886, lived in the vicinity of the
tract containing the sites from 1880, when he appears as a child in his father J.W. Brooksâs
household, through at least 1930. Other members of his family, including J.W. Brooks, Arizona Ross,
Sallie Grant, and Ollie Brooks, lived in the area as well and maintained associations with the tracts
containing sites 41RK626, 41RK611, and 41RK647. At various times, census records indicate Calvin
Brooks lived in the household of tenants, suggesting members of the Freeman and/or Jourdan
families might have occupied the tract as well.
Prior to 1881, the property was associated with the Allred/Allison family, who resided in Panola
County. Any occupants of the parcel during this early period would have been tenants or squatters,
though archeological evidence indicates that sites 41RK651 and 41RK653 were not created during
that time. The sites do not maintain any known associative significance that would warrant NRHP
listing under Criterion A or B.

Sites 41RK626 and 41RK611

The tracts containing sites 41RK626 and 41RK611 are also located within the original Elijah Allred
Survey, and the sites were likely associated with use or occupation of the property by members of
the Jesse Brooks family during the early twentieth century (see history of sites 41RK647, 41RK651,
and 41RK653). In 1881, Elijah Allredâs daughter Kiziah Allison and her husband S.G. conveyed
100013883/100196

68

5. Results of the Archival Research
105 acres out of the Allred Survey containing the sites to Jesse Brooks, a resident of Rusk County.
The record indicates that the Allisons resided in Panola County at the time of the conveyance (Rusk
County Deed Records 31:313), and they appear in the 1880 Panola County census. Brooks
purchased the parcel for $210, and the metes-and-bounds description provided in the record
indicates that it was bounded by Martinâs Creek and another 150-acre parcel the Allisons had
previously conveyed to Brooks (Rusk County Deed Records 31:313) (see history of site 41RK647).
The propertyâs low value at the time suggests that it did not contain improvements.
Jesse W. Brooks retained the property until 1883 when he conveyed it to Emily Brooks for $200
(Rusk County Deed Records 31:314). Contemporary census records reveal that Emily was Jesse
Brooksâs mother. In 1880, Jesse Brooks (35) appears as the head of a household containing his wife
Ann (28), their children Oliver (9), Arizona (6), and Calvin (5 months), and his mother Emily (67).
In 1886, Emily Brooks conveyed the 105 acres to Arizona Brooks and Sallie Brooks for $315 cash in
hand paid by Jesse W. Brooks (Rusk County Deed Records 40:237). The sisters were still minors at
the time of the conveyance.

A subsequent deed reveals that as adults the sisters partitioned the property between themselves
via an oral agreement in which Sallie Brooks Grant (wife of J.M. Grant) received the eastern half of
the tract and Arizona Brooks Ross (wife of W.L. Ross) received the western half. Eventually, the
Grants owned the entire parcel and partitioned it among themselves in a divorce settlement in
1924. In the agreement, Sallie Brooks Grant received the eastern half of the 105-acre tract
containing site 41RK625, and her ex-husband J.M. Grant received the western half containing site
41RK611 (Rusk County Deed Records 125:151).

Census research suggests the Brooks, Grants, and Rosses resided in the vicinity of the subject parcel
throughout the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and may have occupied it and/or
leased it out to tenants during their association with it. Deed research for the tracts containing sites
41RK647, 41RK651, and 41RK653 indicates that the Brooks family owned adjacent 150- and
180-acre tracts in the Allred Survey. The extended Brooks family could have been living on and
cultivating these holdings, and ad valorem tax research could reveal how much property the family
owned in the area and a general timeline of their property acquisition.
In 1900, Jessie Brooks, his new wife Mollie, and their four children lived two households from John
and Sallie Grant and three households from his son Ollie Brooks, all in Justice Precinct 3, which
contained the current project area. His sons Cal (20) and Brutus (18) Brooks also lived nearby. Two
families of renters lived between Jessie and Ollie Brooks, suggesting the family may have employed
tenants on their property. Wm. L. and Arizona Ross also lived in the area, though not immediately
adjacent to her father. All of these individuals owned their property.

In 1910, the family members still lived in immediate proximity to each other on the âHenderson to
Marshall Road.â It is unclear where this road was located in 1910, but by 1936, a state highway

100013883/100196

69

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
between Henderson and Marshall was located to the northwest of the current project area (Texas
State Highway Department 1936). In that year, Jess W. Brooks, wife Mollie, and their six children
lived two households from Ollie Brooks, who lived alone one household from the John P. and Sallie
Grant family. A family of renters lived between Jess and Ollie Brooks. Cal Brooks lived two
households from his father, and though he owned his own property, he was a boarder in the
household of Charlie Freeman, who rented his farm. The Rosses are enumerated on the previous
census sheet only a few households from the rest of the family living along the âHenderson to
Carthage Road.â

In 1920, Calvin, J.W., and Ollie Brooks still lived near each other on the Dirgin Road. This road forms
one of the boundaries of the parcel containing site 41RK626 and appears to be the same road
described as the Henderson to Marshall Road in 1910. The men are described as living in the
Church Hill voting precinct, which is the small farming community historically located nearby and
to the southwest of the site. The Grants and Rosses do not appear in the census records from that
year, and later deeds suggest that Sallie Brooks Grant moved to Tatum after her divorce (Rusk
County Deed Records 125:151).

The history of the property after 1924 contains some gaps; however, it appears that it was
inherited by J.M. and Sallieâs daughters Annie Norris and Evie Prior during the 1940s (Rusk County
Deed Records 390:210, 758:247). Annie Norris owned the 42-acre portion containing site 41RK626
(Rusk County Deed Records 758:247). She retained the parcel until 1968 (Rusk County Deed
Records 979:449), and it remained in the Norris/Grant family through the remainder of the
twentieth century (Rusk County Deed Records 2138:77).

J.M. Grant retained interest in the 52.5-acre tract that contained site 41RK611 through 1974. In that
year, he conveyed it along with another parcel in the T.J. Walling Survey to his children John W.
Grant, Sylvia Ross, Lavis Gentry, and Lillie Sue Williams (Rusk County Deed Records 985:563).
Sylvia Ross received the 11 acres containing site 41RK611 (Rusk County Deed Records 1005:98).

Results Summary and Analysis: Archival and archeological evidence and the standing structures
associated with both sites suggest that sites 41RK626 and 41RK611 were associated with the
occupation and/or use of the associated parcels by the Jesse Brooks family, including Sallie Brooks
Grant and husband J.M. and Arizona Brooks Ross and husband W.L., during the early twentieth
century. Jesse Brooks purchased the parcel containing the sites in 1881, and it might have formed a
portion of his home and farmstead. His daughters Sallie and Arizona owned the property jointly
during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, though by 1924, Sallie Brooks Grant and
her ex-husband retained sole interest in the property. The extended Brooks family all lived in close
proximity to each other, and other family members, including Calvin Brooks and Ollie Brooks,
maintained associations with the tracts containing sites 41RK647, 41RK651, and 41RK653. It is
likely that Sallie Grant and/or associated tenants constructed and occupied the remnants of the
early- to mid-twentieth-century farmstead components recorded as part of site 41RK626, while her
100013883/100196

5. Results of the Archival Research
ex-husband and his heirs were associated with the property containing 41RK611 during the
twentieth century.

Prior to 1881, the property was associated with the Allred/Allison family, who resided in Panola
County. Any occupants of the parcel during this early period would have been tenants or squatters,
though archeological evidence and the structural components still on-site indicate that sites
41RK626 and 41RK611 arose during the twentieth century. The sites have no known associative
significance that would qualify them for NRHP listing under Criterion A or B; however, both include
historic-age standing structures.

Site 41RK626 includes three historic-age architectural resources. Resource A is a circa 1940,
vernacular, wood-framed, single-family dwelling that appears to have replaced an earlier structure
depicted on a 1935 aerial photograph. The resourceâs primary faÃ§ade has been altered, and the
original porch may have been infilled or replaced. Currently, there is a small, single-bay, frontgabled entry porch supported by replacement wooden posts, and a large, nonhistoric-age wooden
deck has been added to the primary faÃ§ade. The windows are replacement 6/6 units, and the
exterior is clad in horizontal wooden siding. This resource lacks integrity of materials, design,
workmanship, and feeling due to its many alterations.
Resource B is a small circa 1900, wood-framed shed. This resource is clad in wooden board-andbatten siding with clapboards in the gable ends. It has a replacement metal roof and its door is no
longer intact. Resource B lacks integrity of setting, feeling, and association, as the original building
associated with this structure is no longer extant. Resource C is a large, circa 1935 barn with a
broken-gabled roof. This resource has an enclosed, raised, finished storage area and a large open
implement/livestock storage area with an intervening central passage. The exterior has been reclad
in corrugated metal. This resource is of common design and lacks known historic associations. The
exterior recladding detracts from its integrity of materials and workmanship. None of the
nonarcheological resources associated with site 41RK626 appears to qualify for NRHP inclusion
under Criterion A, B, or C, either individually or as a group.
Site 41RK611 also includes structural remnants dating to the parcelâs association with J.M. Grant.
Though there is no reference to a commercial operation at the site in the deed record, it appears to
include the remnants of some type of store, and a 1936 highway map depicts a sawmill near the
intersection where the site is located (Texas State Highway Department 1936). There are three
abandoned historic-age resources remaining on the parcel, including a circa 1940 freestanding
commercial building (Resource A). This resource is a one-room, side-gabled structure with a small
side-gabled wing on the northern terminus and a broad, hipped-roof awning on the primary faÃ§ade
covering a concrete pad. There are two large, fixed display (storefront) windows on the primary
facade and a band of fixed windows along the roof/wall junction on the rear faÃ§ade. The exterior is
clad in beveled horizontal wooden siding.

100013883/100196

71

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
The second structure at the site (Resource B) is a circa 1935, side-gabled building of indeterminate
historic use. The resource has a wood frame and was originally clad in wooden siding that has been
partially replaced with corrugated metal. It has replacement metal-sash windows and is finished on
the interior with wooden floors and wood-paneled walls. The third structure (Resource C) is a
large, front-gabled barn. This wood-framed structure has a corrugated metal roof and corrugated
metal cladding. There is an enclosed raised portion on the northern terminal end that appears to
have been used for dry goods storage, and the rest has an earthen floor and is open to the outside.
Though resources A and C retain integrity, none of the resources possesses any architectural merit.
All lack integrity of setting due to the siteâs overgrowth and abandonment, and Resource B lacks
integrity of materials, workmanship, and feeling due to the exterior recladding and replacement
windows. Additionally, the resources do not maintain any known historic associations, and the
Grant family does not appear to have been significant to local development. These resources are not
recommended for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion A, B, or C, either individually or as a
collective.

Sites 41RK647 and 41RK654, Luminant Tracts 1371 and 1372

The tracts containing sites 41RK647, 41RK654, and Luminant Tracts 1371 and 1372 are located
within the original Elijah Allred Survey, and the sites were likely associated with use or occupation
of the property by members of the Jesse Brooks family during the early twentieth century. In 1879,
Keziah Allison and her husband Samuel conveyed 150 acres out of the Allred Survey containing
sites 41RK647 and 41RK654 to Jesse W. Brooks for $400 (Rusk County Deed Records 31:311).
Historians could not locate the Allreds or the Allisons in the 1870 census records, but they resided
in Panola County in 1860 and 1880 (Rusk County Deed Records 31:313). According to Rusk County
deed records, Brooks retained the property until his death (between 1920 and 1925) excepting
0.5 acre deeded to his son Calvin Brooks in 1908 and 22.10 acres deeded to his daughter Lois and
her husband J.B. Stokes in 1920 (Rusk County Deed Records 112:5, 113:476). Brooks owned at least
two other tracts in the Allred Survey (see history of sites 41RK626, 41RK611, 41RK653, and
41RK651), and as the subject 150 acres was the only one he retained, it may have contained his
homestead. Census research indicates that the extended Brooks family lived in the area throughout
the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and they may have resided in the circa 1915
dwelling (Resource 14) located on the parcel containing site 41RK654 (see Chapter 6 for more
information about the dwelling).
In 1880, Jesse Brooks (35) appears as the head of a household containing his wife Ann (28), their
children Oliver (9), Arizona (6), and Calvin (5 months), and his mother Emily (67). By 1900, his
household included his new wife Mollie (30) and their children Stephen (6), Lillian (4), Lois (2), and
George (5 months). The family lived two households from Brooksâs daughter Sallie Grant and three
households from his son Ollie Brooks in Justice Precinct 3, which historically contained the current
project area. His sons Cal (20) and Brutus (18) Brooks also lived nearby. Two families of renters
100013883/100196

72

5. Results of the Archival Research
lived between Jessie and Ollie Brooks, suggesting the family may have employed tenants on their
property. Jesseâs daughter Arizona Ross and her husband Wm. L. also lived in the area though not
immediately adjacent to his household. All of these individuals owned their property.
By 1910, several Brooks family members lived in immediate proximity to each other on the
âHenderson to Marshall Road.â It is unclear where this road was located in 1910, but by 1936, a
state highway between Henderson and Marshall was located to the northwest of the current project
area (Texas State Highway Department 1936). Jess W. Brooks, wife Mollie, and six children lived
two households from Ollie Brooks, who lived alone one household from the John P. and Sallie Grant
family. A family of renters lived between Jess and Ollie Brooks. Cal Brooks lived two households
from his father, and though he owned his own property, he was a boarder in the household of
Charlie Freeman, who rented his farm. The Rosses are enumerated on the previous census sheet
only a few households from the rest of the family living along the âHenderson to Carthage Road.â

Sites 41RK647 and 41RK654

In 1920, Calvin, J.W., and Ollie Brooks still lived near each other on the Dirgin Road. This road
appears to be the same road described as the Henderson to Marshall Road in 1910. Jesse Brooksâs
household included his wife Mollie (65) and children George (19), Dollie (16), and Rubbie (14).
Jesseâs daughter Lois and her husband James B. Stokes are listed in the adjacent household. The
record describes the group as living in the Church Hill voting precinct, which is the small farming
community historically located nearby and to the southwest of the project area.

After Jesse Brooksâs death, his heirs conveyed their interest in the subject parcel containing sites
41RK647 and 41RK654 to his son Ruby (also known as Rube or Reuben). In 1925, Brooksâs
daughter Dollie (Brooks) Selman and her husband E.E. conveyed her interest in the 150-acre tract
to Ruby for $400 (Rusk County Deed Records 126:29). Six years later, the remaining heirs of Jesse
Brooks, including Calvin and Josey Brooks, A.E. and Lillie Stokes, J.B. and Lois Stokes, Steve and
Essie Brooks, L.C. and Aria Ross Compton, Ollie Brooks, and Sallie Grant, deeded their interest in the
150 acres (excepting 0.5 acre owned by Calvin Brooks and 22.10 acres owned by J.B. and Lois
Stokes) to Reuben and George Brooks for $10 (Rusk County Deed Records 204:146).

Their interests reverted back to them by August 13, 1942, possibly at the death of George Brooks,
and the heirs sold their interest to Reuben Brooks for $10, giving him sole ownership of the
150-acre tract (Rusk County Deed Records 383:554). Reuben Brooks (22) appears in the 1930
census living on Prospect-Harmony Hill Road with his wife Mattie (17), mother Mollie (74), and
brother George (22). Though it is unclear where this road was located in relation to the current
project area, the fact that his mother resided with the family suggests they may have continued to
live on the subject tract after his fatherâs death, possibly in the house located on the parcel
containing site 41RK654.

Luminant Tracts 1371 and 1372
In 1920, Jesse Brooks conveyed a 22.11-acre parcel including Luminant Tracts 1371 and 1372 to
his daughter Lois Stokes and her husband J.B. Stokes for $10 (Rusk County Deed Records 113:476).
In 1972, Mary Lois Stokes, the surviving widow of J.B. Stokes, sold the 1-acre tract currently known
as Luminant Tract 1371 to Michael Ross and his wife Mattie Denise Ross for $10. Mary Lois Stokes
retained the remaining portion of the property until her death in 1991. The Stokeses owned the
property from 1920 through Loisâs death (Rusk County Probate Records 91â34).

Results Summary and Analysis: Archival evidence suggests that sites 41RK647 and 41RK654 may
have been associated with some aspect of the Jesse Brooks homestead occupation. Brooks
purchased the 150-acre property containing both sites in 1879 and owned it until his death in the
mid-1920s. Brooksâs heirs conveyed the property including sites 41RK647 and 41RK654 to his son
Reuben, who retained it until his death in 1973. The parcel remained intact through Ruebenâs
ownership and was only partitioned after the historic period.
Any archeological deposits located in Luminant Tracts 1371 and 1372 are likely associated with the
homestead occupation of Lois and J.B. Stokes, who owned the parcels containing these tracts from
1920 through 1991.
Prior to 1881, the property was associated with the Allred/Allison family, who resided in Panola
County. There is no evidence that the Brooks family was significant to local patterns of
development, and the sites and parcels have no known associative significance that would qualify
them for NRHP listing under Criterion A or B. For more information about the dwelling located on
the parcel containing site 41RK654, see the assessment of Resource 14 in Chapter 6.

Site 41RK612

The Luminant tract file for the parcel containing site 41RK612 includes a gap in the early chain of
title from the sovereignty of the soil through 1914, when A.P. Matthews and wife Delia Matthews
sold a 248-acre parcel including the subject site to Ollie and Calvin Brooks of Rusk County for
$2,480 (Rusk County Deed Records 100:34). Given the high value of the property, it likely included
improvements at the time, but it is unknown if there were any improvements at the location of the
site. Census records indicate that a William A.P. Matthews lived one household away from the Jesse
Brooks family in 1880. Wm. A.P. Matthews was enumerated as a 29-year-old farmer whose
household included his wife Amanda and children Alice, William, and Jesse. By 1900, the family still
lived one household from the Brooks family, but Amanda was listed as a widowed head of
household and her family included her sons Gus and Dallis (ages 20 and 18, respectively). Ollie and
Calvin Brooks were known to reside in the general area (see history of sites 41RK647 and
41RK654), and it is possible that their homesteads were located somewhere on this 248-acre tract
or on adjacent property associated with the Brooks family.

5. Results of the Archival Research
In 1933, Ollie Brooks and his wife Callie Brooks relinquished their interest in the western portion of
the 248 acres to Calvin Brooks. Calvin Brooks and his wife Josie retained the property through the
1960s.

Results Summary and Analysis: Archival evidence suggests that the site was likely associated
with the A.P. Matthews family or with the use of the land by Ollie and Calvin Brooks or their
tenants. There is no evidence that the Matthews or Ollie and Calvin Brooks families were significant
to the local history, and the site is not recommended for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion A, B,
or C.

EARLY HISTORY OF THE T.J. WALLING SURVEY, RUSK COUNTY ABSTRACT
810 (LUMINANT TRACTS 1235, 1255, 1273, AND 1358)

The 59.345-acre parcel (two parcels of 10.5 and 50 acres, called 60.5 acres) containing site
41RK639, the 27-acre parcel containing site 41RK610, the 68.50-acre parcel containing site
41RK656, and the 344.70-acre parcel containing site 41RK641 are all located within the original T.J.
Walling Headright Survey (one league = 4,428.40 acres) in Rusk County, Texas. Walling was entitled
to his Nacogdoches 1st-class headright based on his service in the Texas Revolution. First-class
headrights were issued to individuals who arrived in Texas before March 2, 1836, and entitled
heads of household to receive one league (4,428 acres) and one labor (177.1 acres) and single men
to receive 1/3 league (1,476.1 acres) (GLO n.d.). Walling patented his league survey (Rusk County
Abstract 810) in May of 1851 on the same day that he patented an adjacent survey of one labor
(Texas GLO Records, Rusk County Abstract 814) (see Figure 16).

Secondary sources indicate that Walling arrived in Texas in 1836. He and his brothers Jesse and
John Walling fought in the Texas Revolution, and he lived âten miles east of Nacogdoches until 1840,
when he moved near Henderson in Rusk County and lived there from 1841 to 1859â (Hudson
2010). The current project area is approximately 12 miles from the town of Henderson. As sources
are vague regarding exactly where Walling settled, it is possible he lived somewhere on his survey
during the period. Additionally, an 1863 map of the project area depicts the community of Wallingâs
Mill located near but outside of the project area boundaries (Von Rosenberg 1863; Figure 17).
Nevertheless, there were two communities with that name in Rusk County; the second and more
prominent of the two was located closer to Henderson on land donated by T.J.âs brother Jesse
Walling. That community eventually became known as Millville and contained a gristmill and cotton
gin, âseveral mercantile stores, a drug store . . . a blacksmith, and a pottery businessâ (Foster 2000).

Though it is unclear where T.J. Walling lived, archeological evidence suggests it is unlikely that he
maintained a direct association with the subject tracts containing sites 41RK610, 41RK639,
41RK641, and 41RK656. Additionally, the reference that he lived near Henderson suggests he may
have lived near his brother Jesse in the Millville area and he did not reside in Rusk County
permanently. Walling and his family relocated to Hill County in 1859, eventually settling in Bosque
100013883/100196

County. By 1875, he lived in Prairie Valley. He died circa 1902 and was buried in Merkel, Texas
(Hudson 2010).

Site 41RK639

The records provided by Luminant relating to the tract associated with site 41RK639 contain a gap
in the chain of title from its patent in 1851 until 1905 when J.H. and L.R. Wiggins conveyed a
50-acre tract in the Walling Survey to Jim Young for $330.80 with a vendorâs lien. The Wigginses
resided in Val Verde County at the time of the conveyance, suggesting the parcel did not constitute
their homestead, while Young is described as a resident of Rusk County. The record describes the
parcel as âpart of the Basil Garvin home placeâ (Rusk County Deed Records 65:74).

The chain of title data provided by Luminant does not have any record of a Basil Garvin owning the
50-acre tract; however, he does appear in Rusk County census records as early as 1880. In that
year, Basel [sic] Garvin, a 35-year-old farmer, headed a household including his wife Mary (30) and
children Floredy (11), Mollie (9), George (7), July (3), and Isabell (9 months). They appear again in
1900 living in Justice Precinct 3, which contained the current project area. In that year Bazle [sic]
Garvin (55) lived with his wife Mary (53) and their daughter Jettie (14) one household from
suspected project area resident J.W. Brooks (see history of sites 41RK653, 41RK651, 41RK626,
41RK611, and 41RK647). Garvin owned his farm. By 1910, the couple is described as living on the
Longview Road on property owned by Mary Garvin. It is possible they lived on the subject parcel
and relocated prior to 1910.
Young purchased the adjacent 10.5 acres, which with the 50-acre parcel comprises the current tract
containing site 41RK639, for $52.50 from H.J. and C.L. Peek in 1906 (Rusk County Deed Records
64:226). Peek had acquired a 160-acre tract in the Walling Survey from J.W. Wiggins of Val Verde
County and Sallie P. and Webster Flanagan of Travis County a month before conveying the 10.5-acre
parcel to Young (Rusk County Deed Records 61:32). It is possible that the subject tract was
partitioned from that 160-acre parcel. The property remained in the Young family through the midtwentieth century, and site 41RK639 is likely related to their use and/or occupation of the land.

Jim Young appears as a property-owning farmer in Rusk County census records prior to his
acquisition of the property in 1905. In 1900, he owned his farm in Justice Precinct 3 and lived with
his wife Julia (24) and their children Lonnie (6) and Nettie (3). The group lived one household from
Hiram Peak [sic], who sold Young the 10.5-acre tract in 1906. Despite his status as a property
owner in 1900, subsequent deed records indicate that the 50-acre portion of the subject tract
included the familyâs homestead after 1905. In 1910, census records indicate Jim S. Young (40) lived
along âCounty Roadâ in Justice Precinct 3 with his wife Julia C. (34) and their children Lonnie (15),
Nettie (13), Chester (9), Walter (7), Grady (2), and Annie (11 months). Historic aerial photograph
research indicates that the site was located along a road in 1935; however, the parcel was bypassed

5. Results of the Archival Research
when current FM 2658 was constructed in the mid-twentieth century. Young owned his farm, and
the family was one of only two white families enumerated on the census page. The other family was
that of Tom M. Young, and the census record references the Tom Young family as renters. The
remainder of the local residents were African American.

Though it does not appear that they relocated, by 1920 the family is no longer recorded in a
predominantly African American area. The record indicates they lived on Dirgin Road, which runs
through the current project area, in the Church Hill voting precinct. Church Hill was a small farming
community located near but outside of the current project area to the southwest. In that year, the
household included James S. (51), Julia (age indecipherable), Chester (19), Walter (17), Grady (12),
Annie (9), and Clyde (7). Young owned his farm, and his son Lonnie rented property nearby.
Historians were unable to find an entry for the family in the 1930 Rusk County census records.

The parcels do not appear in the deed record again until 1949 when J.S. and Julia Young conveyed
two 9-acre tracts out of their â50 acre home tractâ to their daughter Altha Ann Taylor and son
Alfred Clyde Young. The grantors retained a life interest in the property, which was not to pass to
the grantees until both J.S. and Julia were deceased (Rusk County Deed Records 431:447, 652:502).
In 1970, the heirs of J.S. and Julia Young, including Altha Ann Young Taylor, Chester Young, Sammy
Wayne Young, Walter Young, Agnes Young Pool, Vesta Young (surviving wife of Alfred Clyde
Young), Helen Young Allen, Betty Sue Young Jennings, Jim Turner Young, Douglas Young, Edna
Lorene Ferguson Latham, Mary Ozell Ferguson Bullman, and J.W. Ferguson, all of Rusk County,
conveyed the property to Delbert Wayne Prior for $7,625 with a vendorâs lien. The record indicates
that none of the grantors resided on the property at that time (Rusk County Deed Records
910:336).

Results Summary and Analysis: Archival research indicates that site 41RK639 could represent
the remnants of the Jim and Julia Young homestead. The couple acquired the property around the
turn of the twentieth century, and it is referred to as their âhome tractâ in a 1949 conveyance. The
associated Luminant land records for the two parcels comprising the subject property contain a gap
in the chain of title from 1851 through the Youngsâ acquisition of both in 1905 and 1906,
respectively. During this period, the property could have been occupied and/or used by the original
grantee T.J. Walling and/or associated tenants, other unknown owners and their tenants, tenants in
the employ of J.H. and L.R. Wiggins, H.C. and C.L. Peek, J.W. Wiggins, and/or Sally P. and Webster
Flanagan, and/or the Basil Garvin family. Nevertheless, archeological evidence suggests that the site
arose during the period the property was associated with the Young family. The site has no known
significance that would qualify it for NRHP listing under Criteria A and/or B. The site also includes a
nonhistoric-age outbuilding that postdates the Youngâs association with the subject property. The
resource does not meet the minimum requirements for NRHP eligibility as it is neither of historic
age nor of exceptional significance.

Site 41RK610
The Luminant chain of title data for the 27-acre parcel containing site 41RK610 and secondary
sources suggest that the subject tract was partitioned from property associated with the Mark
Stroud family during the nineteenth century. Though site 41RK610 does not appear to date from
this period, understanding the early history of the associated property provides a good context for
analyzing subsequent development in the project area. Stroud began to acquire property in the
Walling Survey in 1852. In that year, Thomas Jefferson Walling and his wife Nancy conveyed
300 acres in the survey to Mark Stroud for $500 (Rusk County Deed Records G:590). The parcel is
described as being adjacent to land owned by George W. Trammell. An 1863 map of the project
vicinity depicts the plantations of Trammell and Stroud as being located in close proximity to each
other near the project area (Von Rosenberg 1863). Stroud purchased two additional parcels of
262 acres ($655) and 133 acres ($300) in the Walling Survey in 1855 (Rusk County Deed Records
G:590, J:186), and Walling sold Stroud an additional, adjacent 133-acre tract in 1859 for $352.50
(Rusk County Deed Records M:692).
In the period after the Civil War, Stroudâs son-in-law Wm. M. Waskom (sometimes referred to as
Wasson) also acquired adjoining property in the Walling Survey. He purchased a 268-acre tract
adjoining both the Stroud and Trammell holdings in 1868 for $536 (Rusk County Deed Records
Q:214) and another 69.5 acres in 1869 (Rusk County Deed Records R:270). Mark Stroud conveyed
Waskom and his partner J.A. Vinson his four tracts (300 acres, 262 acres, 133 acres, and 133 acres)
in the Walling Survey for $2,500 in gold in 1874 (Rusk County Deed Records V:462). The subject 27
acres was partitioned out of some portion of the Stroud/Waskom holdings.

It appears that Waskom got into some financial troubles in subsequent years. In 1881, he and J.A.
Vinson conveyed the 262-acre tract back to Mark Stroud for a greatly reduced price of $300 (Rusk
County Deed Records 29:294). Five years later, a large portion of Waskomâs estate, including the
268- and 69.5-acre tracts in the Walling Survey, was seized and sold at sheriffâs auction to T.L. Ross.
The seizure was intended to repay a debt Waskom owed C.J. Woreland (or Waolard) & Co. as
determined by the district court of Galveston County, and T.J. Ross, who was affiliated with the
company, was the highest bidder. He paid $200 for seven tracts of land (Rusk County Deed Records
34:87).

Ross sold all of the property to Mark Stroud the same year for $132.62 (Rusk County Deed Records
34:240), and Stroud bought back his 300-acre and the two 133-acre tracts from Vinson and
Waskom in 1888 for $10,000 (Rusk County Deed Records 36:360). This high price may be reflective
of Stroudâs desire to help his son-in-law financially rather than due to improvements located on the
property. The conveyances from the period do not reference specific improvements on the land, but
census records suggest that Stroud and/or Waskom could have lived somewhere on their holdings
in the Walling Survey during the mid-nineteenth century.

5. Results of the Archival Research
Mark Stroud first appears in Rusk County census records in 1850. In that year, Stroud (38) headed
a household containing his wife Sarah A. (36) and their children Ethan A. (13), A.D. (11), Susan (5),
and Sarah (2). Stroud is listed as a farmer with $1,500 in real estate. By 1860, after Stroud
purchased his holdings in the Walling Survey, he lived one household from George W. Trammell in
the Alma Post Office Precinct (see history of sites 41RK617 and 41RK637 for more information
about the Trammell family). Stroud owned $4,000 in real estate, and his personal estate was valued
at $28,000. The high value of his personal estate suggests he owned slaves. The household included
Stroud (47), Sarah (44), America (14), Sarah (11), and E.A.S. (24).
By 1870, Stroud (58) was enumerated as living in the Henderson Post Office Precinct with his wife,
indexed as Sarah M. (56), and their daughter Sarah (18). He owned $7,000 worth of real estate and
maintained a personal estate valued at $3,000. The family lived three households away from
William (35) and America (22) Wasson [sic]. Wasson or Waskom was a farmer with $1,500 in real
estate and an $800 personal estate. By 1880, Stroud lived in Henderson with his wife S.M. and three
boarders, one of whom was a cotton buyer. Historians could not find an entry for the
Wasson/Waskom household in the 1880 Rusk County census records, though William Waskom
appears as a Rusk County resident in the various conveyances recorded during the period. Despite
their potential occupancy in the project vicinity, archeological evidence suggests that site 41RK610
did not arise during this period.

In 1888, Stroud conveyed three parcels (40 acres, 33 acres, and 197 acres) in the Walling Survey to
his daughter America Wasson [sic] as her own separate property. The conveyance does not specify
which survey the parcels were in (Rusk County Deed Records 36:426), and the Luminant tract file
for the subject 27 acres does not include any other conveyances of land between Stroud and his
daughter. In 1905, Mrs. A.A. Waskom conveyed 70 acres in the Walling Survey to Wesley Menefee
for two notes of $112.50 (Rusk County Deed Records 28:104). The Luminant tract file for the
subject 27 acres indicates that it was included in this conveyance; however, a census entry from the
period for Mrs. Waskom either contains erroneous data, or the individual listed as the grantor in
the conveyance may not be Mark Stroudâs daughter America.
An America Waskom (75) appears in the 1900 Rusk County census as a resident of Henderson. She
owned her property and headed a household including her niece M.J. Terrell (60) and four
boarders. Stroudâs daughter America Waskom or Wasson would have been approximately 52 at the
time of the 1900 census suggesting that this entry represents an unrelated individual. Despite the
discrepancy, which could mean the Luminant file for the subject tract does not include the correct
nineteenth-century history of the subject parcel, archeological and archival evidence indicates that
site 41RK610 is likely associated with occupation and/or use of the parcel by Wesley Menefee
and/or his family rather than by individuals associated with the property during its early history.
Additionally, secondary sources and census data indicate that Stroud did live in the area,
supporting the historic information included in the chain of title file.
100013883/100196

As discussed in the history of sites 41RK617 and 41RK637, Wesley Menefee owned approximately
272 acres in the project vicinity, including this tract, which he retained until his death in 1923
(Rusk County Death Certificate #2867). Census research, subsequent conveyances, and the
inventory of the nearby Chapel Hill Cemetery where Wesley Menefee and his family are interred
(Green n.d.) indicate that the Menefee family resided in the vicinity of the subject tract throughout
his association with it, and that site 41RK610 is likely associated with their use and/or occupation
of the property.
Menefee (21), an African American farmer, first appears in the Rusk County census records in 1880.
He and his wife Mary (18) resided near other individuals with whom they had pooled resources in
order to buy property in the surrounding area. All of his neighbors, including members of the
Humphrey and Barr families (see history of site 41RK617), were either African American or
mulatto, and many owned their property.

In 1900, the next year for which census records are available, Wesley Menefee (58) owned his farm
in Justice Precinct 3, which historically contained the current project area. His household included
wife Mary (45) and children Jim (17), Jessie (15), John (13), Son (11), Edie (9), Oba (7), Carrie (5),
Maud (3), and Thos. (1). They lived near other African American property owners including Mary
Humphrey, wife of the deceased Peter Humphrey, Henry Manual, and Joe Wright. In 1910, the
household included Wesley H. Menifee [sic] (64), Mary A. (50), Jim (27), Jesse (26), John (22), Sue D.
(19), Hober [sic] (16), and Edie (15). The group lived one household away from John Humphries,
who also owned his property. Other African American property owners in the vicinity included
members of the Barr family and Mary Humphries. It is unclear why there are so many discrepancies
in the ages of the Menefee family members in the respective census entries.

By 1920, the household was recorded in the Church Hill voting precinct along Prospect Road near
other probable project area residents the Jim Young family (see history of site 41RK639). Church
Hill was a small farming community located near but outside of the project area to its southwest. In
1920, Wesley Menefee (71) and wife Mary (69) lived with their children John (24) and Eddie (21)
one household from Oss [sic] and Seley [sic] Barr, who owned their farm. Mary Humphries (101)
lived in the Barr household and is described as Os Barrâs mother-in-law. Two other members of the
Barr family owned farms in the area, as did John Humphries.

Though the Luminant tract file for the subject tract did not contain any probate information for
Wesley Menefee, it appears that his children inherited his property. Altogether, Wesley and Mary
Menefee owned 272 acres in the adjacent Cortinas, T.J. Walling, and Thomas Williams surveys
(Figure 18). In 1924, their son John Menefee took out a deed of trust for $639.88 on his share of the
27-acre tract as well as four other parcels originally owned by his parents (Rusk County Deed of
Trust Records P:99). Menefee took out another deed of trust in 1930 and an extension on the 1924
deed of trust in 1931 (Rusk County Deed of Trust Records P:227, R:42). All of the records indicate
that he resided in Panola County during this period.
100013883/100196

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
It appears that John Menefee was unable to repay the loans. In 1935, the foreclosed property,
including five parcels, was sold at sheriffâs auction to B.L. Parker for $100. The conveyance does not
mention that the transaction only included a partial interest in the five tracts (Rusk County Deed
Records 266:22); however, a subsequent lawsuit confirmed that other Menefee heirs still retained
an interest in the property. In 1946, a judgment in the case of Jessie Menefee et al. vs. B.L. Parker et
al. determined that Parker was not entitled to the entire property but rather to a shared interest
with the remaining heirs including C.J. Cooper, Jessie Menefee, and Louberta Menefee. The other
Menefee children, including Jim Menefee, Son Menefee, Edith Menefee Cooper, and Hobert Menefee,
were deceased at the time of the lawsuit. Parker was granted the subject 27 acres and an adjacent
58-acre tract containing site 41RK617 as his share of the property (Rusk County District Court
Cause #17228).

Subsequent records reveal that Parker did not reside on the 27-acre tract containing site 41RK610.
Bishop Linus Parker resided in Panola County, Texas, and retained the subject property until his
death in 1960. At that time, it reverted to his wife Almeda Parilee Parker as part of their community
estate (Panola County Probate Records, Cause #3807). Any occupants of the tract during its
association with the Parkers would have been tenants or renters.

Results Summary and Analysis: Archival research indicates that the parcel containing site
41RK610 was originally associated with the Stroud/Waskom (or Wasson) family, early county
residents and plantation owners, during the nineteenth century. Despite these early associations,
archival and archeological evidence suggests the site was associated with occupation and/or use of
the land by the Menefee family during the early to mid-twentieth century. Nevertheless, Wesley
Menefee did not purchase the larger tract containing the site until 1905, almost 30 years after he
purchased other portions of his estate (see history of sites 41RK617 and 41RK637). His known
occupation in the project vicinity by 1880 suggests that the subject tract did not contain his
homestead. Instead, it may have been created by another member of the family and/or by a tenant.

Despite the siteâs association with African American property owners, an underrepresented
population in the archeological record, the site does not have the potential to provide additional
information to the historical record. Additionally, it does not appear to have been associated with
Wesley and Mary Ann Menefeeâs homestead. Though additional archival research could provide
more contextual information about African American farmers/property owners in the area, it
would not likely clarify the history of this particular site during the period it was associated with
the Menefee family. As a result, additional research is not recommended in connection with the
current project. The individuals associated with these sites have no known historical associations,
and they are not recommended for NRHP listing under Criterion A or B.

5. Results of the Archival Research

Site 41RK656
Archival evidence indicates that the 68.5-acre tract containing site 41RK656 was part of the G.W.
Trammell estate during the mid-nineteenth century. Trammell purchased two parcels (917 acres
and 276.25 acres) in the Walling Survey from Thomas J. and Nancy Walling in 1852 (Rusk County
Deed Records G:165). Though the Trammells were early residents of the project vicinity, they
already lived on an established plantation when they acquired the property (see the history of sites
41RK617, 41RK637, and 41RK649 for more information about the Trammell plantation). Upon his
death, Trammellâs wife America reserved the portion of the coupleâs estate containing their
homestead for herself (Rusk County Deed Records P:532), suggesting that the subject tract did not
contain any of the principal improvements associated with their plantation. Additionally, the
structural remnants present at the site indicate that it was likely associated with twentieth-century
occupation and/or use of the land.

The 68.5-acre tract containing site 41RK656 was part of 100 acres inherited by Sarah Stroud during
the partition of the Trammell estate in 1866 (Rusk County Deed Records 4:281; Rusk County
Probate Cause #851). It is unclear how Sarah Stroud was related to the Trammell family. She was
the wife of neighboring plantation owner Mark Stroud (see history of site 41RK610), and the parcel
remained in the Stroud family through 1901.

Mark Stroud first appears in Rusk County census records in 1850. In that year, Stroud (38) headed
a household containing his wife Sarah A. (36) and their children Ethan A. (13), A.D. (11), Susan (5),
and Sarah (2). Stroud is listed as a farmer with $1,500 in real estate. By 1860, he lived one
household from George W. Trammell in the Alma Post Office Precinct. Stroud owned $4,000 in real
estate, and his personal estate was valued at $28,000. The high value of his personal estate suggests
he owned slaves. The household included Stroud (47), Sarah (44), America (14), Sarah (11), and
E.A.S. (24).

By 1870, Stroud (58) was enumerated as living in the Henderson Post Office Precinct with his wife,
indexed as Sarah M. (56), and their daughter Sarah (18). He owned $7,000 worth of real estate and
maintained a personal estate valued at $3,000. The family lived three households away from
Stroudâs daughter America Wasson [sic] (22) and her husband William (35). William Wasson (or
Waskom) was a farmer with $1,500 in real estate and an $800 personal estate. By 1880, Stroud
lived in Henderson with his wife S.M. and three boarders, one of whom was a cotton buyer.
Historians could not find an entry for the Wasson/Waskom household in the 1880 Rusk County
census records, though William Waskom appears as a Rusk County resident in the various
conveyances recorded during the period.

Though there is no conveyance of record, according to the Luminant tract file, Stroudâs daughter
America Waskom inherited or purchased the property from her parents. In 1901, Mrs. A.A. Waskom
conveyed the 100 acres to Lewis Holt for one note of $250 (Rusk County Deed Records 47:552). The
100013883/100196

low price suggests it was unimproved. The Luminant tract file for the subject 68.5 acres indicates
that it was included in this conveyance; however, a census entry from the period for Mrs. Waskom
either contains erroneous data, or the individual listed as the grantor in the conveyance may not be
Mark Stroudâs daughter America.

An America Waskom (75) appears in the 1900 Rusk County census as a resident of Henderson. She
owned her property and headed a household including her niece M.J. Terrell (60) and four
boarders. Stroudâs daughter America Waskom or Wasson would have been approximately 52 at the
time of the 1900 census suggesting that this entry represents an unrelated individual. Despite the
discrepancy, which could mean the Luminant file for the subject tract does not include the correct
nineteenth-century history of the subject parcel, the site does not appear to have arisen during this
early period. Additionally, secondary sources and census data indicate that Stroud did live in the
area, supporting the historic information included in the chain of title file.

Holt conveyed the property to Lewis Isaac (sometimes referred to as Lewis or Louis Isaacs) the
following month for four promissory notes of $100 each (Rusk County Deed Records 47:553). Holt
does not appear in the 1900 Rusk County census. This absence along with his short association with
the property suggests he did not occupy it during his tenure of ownership. Isaacs retained the
property until 1940, and though he may have lived on the tract, census research indicates he owned
other property prior to acquiring the parcel.
In 1900, Lewis Isiac [sic] (35) appears as an African American farmer living in Justice Precinct 3,
which historically contained the project area. He owned his property, and his household included
his wife Josephine (30), their children Foster (14), George L. (11), Alvin (8), Williams (2), and
Bertha (2), and his niece Jonnie M. Lunsford (12). The family lived near other possible project area
residents, the Adams family (see history of site 41RK635). In 1910, Lewis Isaacs (indexed as 50)
still owned his property, and his household was enumerated along the Tatum Road. Map evidence
suggests the road to Tatum would have been located to the northwest of the project area (Texas
State Highway Department 1936). The household included Josephine (48), Foster (23), John (22),
George (21), Alvin (19), Williamson (16), Bertha (14), Lunsford (11), and Cable Hatchett (23), a
laborer. All of the coupleâs sons worked on the home farm. The family continued to live on Tatum
Road in 1920, and by 1930, Isaac lived with his son William and his family in Henderson.
Isaac was forced to renew the vendorâs lien on the property multiple times in 1914, 1918, 1922,
1926, 1930, and 1932 because he was unable to pay the notes (Luminant Tract File, Tract 1255;
Rusk County Deed Records 80:18, 118:65, 127:531; Rusk County Deed of Trust Records Q:416).
Each time he extended the note, he received additional penalties and interest. Isaac finally paid the
original notes off with penalties and interest in February 1937 (Rusk County Deed Records 305:80).
In 1940, Isaac conveyed the property to E.B. Alford Jr. for âten dollars and other valuable
considerations.â The conveyance did not include two parcels (0.5 acre and 1 acre) Isaac had

100013883/100196

5. Results of the Archival Research
previously sold to the Deacons of the Chapel Hill Church and Celia Barr, respectively. The Barrs had
subsequently conveyed their acre to the Chapel Hill Church as well, and these tracts are where the
still-extant church is located (Rusk County Deed Records 101:118, 110:113). These transactions
suggest that Isaac and the Barrs were members of the Chapel Hill congregation, the local African
American Baptist Church (see history of sites 41RK609 and 41RK649 for more information about
the Barr family).

Alford only retained the property for a few months before selling it to A.M. Wilkins for âten dollars
and other valuable considerations.â Both men were residents of Rusk County (Rusk County Deed
Records 343:289). Wilkins conveyed the tract back to Alford in September of 1942 (Rusk County
Deed Records 362:504), and Wilkins purchased the property back for two promissory notes of
$350 the same month (Rusk County Deed Records 394:118). A series of mineral leases and other
conveyances suggest the men purchased the property as an investment, and Wilkins, who owned
the property through the 1980s, is described as a resident of Henderson in some of the transactions
(Luminant Tract File, Tract 1255; Rusk County Deed Records 1302:508). His residency in
Henderson during his association with the property suggests it would have been occupied by
tenants and/or used for agriculture during his association with it. The parcel was partitioned to its
current size in 1979 when A.M. and Grace Wilkins conveyed the property to their granddaughter
Sally Kern (Rusk County Deed Records 1151:413).

Results Summary and Analysis: Archival research indicates that the parcel containing site
41RK656 was originally associated with the Stroud/Waskom (or Wasson) family, early county
residents and plantation owners, during the nineteenth century. Despite these early associations,
archival evidence and the structural remnants still on-site indicate it was likely associated with
occupation and/or use of the land by the Louis or Lewis Isaac(s) family during the early to midtwentieth century. It is possible that the Isaacs occupied the property as tenants prior to purchasing
it and/or that other tenants lived on the tract during the late nineteenth century. The Isaacs
retained the property from 1901 through 1940, and census evidence suggests they likely lived in
the project vicinity through at least 1920. Louis Isaac relocated to Henderson before 1930 and may
have leased out the land to tenants or continued to use it for agriculture during the period.
Although there is a historic-age structure present at this site, shovel tests revealed there were no
subsurface deposits. Despite the siteâs association with African American property owners, an
underrepresented group of people in the archeological record, site 41RK656 does not have the
potential to provide additional information to the historical record. Though additional archival
research could provide more contextual information about African American farmers/property
owners in the area, it would not be likely to clarify the history of this particular site during the
period it was associated with the Isaac family. As a result, additional research is not recommended
in connection with the current project. The individuals associated with these sites have no known
historical associations, and they are not recommended for NRHP listing under Criterion A or B.

The historic-age structure at site 41RK656 is a circa 1930 barn located near a nonhistoric-age
dwelling. The partially collapsed barn had a cross-gabled roof that has collapsed. The exterior has
been reclad in corrugated metal siding, and the extant portions of the roof are also clad in
corrugated metal. There is an open-air addition on the north gable end with a shed roof supported
by wooden posts. This resource lacks integrity of materials, design, workmanship, and feeling due
to the replacement cladding, partial collapse, and gable-end addition. Its setting has been altered by
the construction of a nonhistoric-age dwelling on the parcel. Additionally, the resource possesses
no known historic associations. This resource is not recommended for inclusion in the NRHP under
Criterion A, B, or C.

Site 41RK641

Site 41RK641 is located on a 200-acre parcel (now 344 acres), purchased by Cullen A. Robertson
from T.J. Walling in 1852 for $350 (Rusk County Deed Records I:64). Although the property may
have included improvements, the high value may be reflective of the parcelâs access to Martin
Creek. Robertson died sometime prior to May of 1854, and his numerous heirs sold the property to
G.W. Trammell for an undisclosed amount (Rusk County Deed Records K:603, 605, 638). It is not
known if Robertson resided on the subject tract.

G.W. Trammell died in 1866, and wife America reserved the plantation house and adjacent property
as her community property estate, relinquishing the remainder of Trammellâs holdings to his heirsat-law (Rusk County Deed Records P:532). The partition of the remaining Trammell property was
not available in the land records provided by Luminant. The property including site 41RK641 was
included in the portion of the estate relinquished to the heirs-at-law, and it does not appear that the
Trammells occupied the subject tract.
In 1883, Ida C. McMahon and Walter Hill purchased 200 acres containing the subject tract for $3.50
per acre from the estate of George W. Trammell (Rusk County Deed Records O:563). The high value
of the property suggests that it may have included improvements. The 1880 Rusk County census
lists Walter Hill as a 17-year-old farmer living in Precinct 3, which historically included the project
area. Ida C. McMahon is listed in this source as a 22-year-old housewife in her husband W.J.
McMahonâs household, also in Precinct 3. The household also included their children Lina and
Robert E.L. McMahon. The relationship between Hill and McMahon is unclear. Historians were
unable to locate an entry for Ida McMahon or Walter Hill in the 1900 census. By 1906, Ida C.
McMahon had passed away, and her heirs owned all interest in the subject property. The records
indicate that at the time of her death she was a resident of Arkansas. (Rusk County Deed Records
60:471). No conveyance from Walter Hill to Ida C. McMahon was found in the land records provided
by Luminant. It is unknown if Hill or McMahon ever occupied the subject tract.
In 1906, W.T. McMahon, G.H. McMahon, and Lina P. Anderson and husband O.S. Anderson, of
Columbia County, Arkansas, sold the subject 200-acre parcel and an additional 240-acre property to
100013883/100196

88

5. Results of the Archival Research
Herman Loeb for $500 and the cancellation of indebtedness due to Loeb from W.T. McMahon. Loeb
is listed in the 1900 Caddo Parish census records as a 45-year-old cotton broker living in
Shreveport with his wife Sophie and children Flora, Soloman, August, Tillie, Edna, and Herbert.
Loeb retained the property until 1921, when he sold the 200-acre subject tract and an adjacent
240-acre tract to D.M. Atkins of Ruston, Louisiana, for $8,000 (Rusk County Deed Records 112:323).
Atkins is listed in the 1920 Caddo Parish census records as a 46-year-old cotton broker. The
propertyâs association with these two cotton brokers suggests that it was a cotton cultivation
operation, likely operated by tenants. The high price for the land may indicate that it included highvalue improvements. Loeb died on February 6, 1922, in Shreveport, and later that year, Darius
Atkins relinquished all rights, title, and interest in the subject 200-acres to the administrators of the
estate of Herman Loeb for $1 (Rusk County Deed Records 449:274, 118:232). The following year,
Loebâs widow Sophie purchased the subject 200-acre tract and additional lands in Rusk, Gregg, and
Jefferson counties for $1,600 (Rusk County Deed Records 119:521). Sophie Loeb retained the
property until 1928 (Rusk County Deed Records 139:523). It appears that neither the Loeb families
nor Atkins families ever occupied the property and that any occupation from 1906 through 1928
would likely be associated with tenants.

In 1928, Sophie Loeb conveyed the 200-acre subject tract to James Monnie Maloney and J.T.
Maloney of Rusk County for $2,000 in the form of four promissory notes for $500 each (Rusk
County Deed Records 139:523). The 1920 Rusk County census lists âMonnieâ Maloney as a 25-yearold farmer living in Precinct 3 with his wife Linnie and son James. This record indicates that they
owned their home farm. John T. Maloney is listed as a 38-year-old oil salesman living on Marshall
Street in Henderson with his wife Della and children Lucille and Ideline. By 1930, both were listed
as living along the Henderson-Longview Road, outside of the project area. In 1932, âMonnieâ
Maloney sold his interest in the property to R.H. Maloney for $10 (Rusk County Deed Records
237:409). Two years later, in 1934, J.T. Maloney conveyed his interest in the property to R.H.
Maloney for $10 (Rusk County Deed Records 259:309). It does not appear that J.T. or âMonnieâ
Maloney ever occupied the subject property. Historians did not find an entry for R.H. Maloney in the
1930 Rusk County census.

Maloney held the property until 1935, when he sold it to Citizens National Bank of Henderson for
$10 and the assumption of a lien from the Federal Land Bank of Houston, Texas, who sold it to
Orian Watson in 1939 for $1,800 (Rusk County Deed Records 274:240, 330:291). Watson owned
the property until his death, sometime prior to 1967, when Lillian Watson (Orian Watsonâs sister)
et al. deeded the property to Francis R. Dunn (Rusk County Deed Records 915:391). It is likely that
Lillie Watson was an heir of Orian T. Watson, but his probate was not included in the land records
provided by Luminant. In 1930, Watson was listed in the Rusk County census as a 29-year-old
salesman living in his motherâs household in Henderson. The household also included his siblings
Lillian and Stroud.

Results Summary and Analysis: Archival research indicates that the parcel containing site
41RK656 was originally associated with the Cullen Robertson and G.W. Trammell families, early
county residents and plantation owners during the nineteenth century. It is unknown if Robertson
ever occupied the subject parcel, and the Trammell plantation house was located south of the
property (see Figure 17). The Hill/McMahon families owned the property from the late 1800s
through the turn of the twentieth century, but it appears that they did not likely occupy the subject
tract, and any occupation from that time period would be that of tenants. The Maloney family was
briefly associated with the property in the late 1920s and early 1930s, and it is possible that they
occupied the tract or leased it out to tenants. The Orian Watson family acquired the parcel in 1939
and retained it through the late 1960s. Site 41RK656 does not maintain any historic associations
that would qualify it for inclusion in the NRHP under any criteria, and no further studies of the site
are recommended.

1246, and 1266 are all located within the original Delores Cortinas Nacogdoches 1st-class headright
(4,165 acres) in Rusk County Texas (see Figure 16). First-class headrights were issued to
individuals who arrived in Texas before March 2, 1836, and entitled heads of household to receive
one league (4,428 acres) and one labor (177.1 acres) and single men to receive 1/3 league
(1,476.1 acres) (GLO n.d.). It is unclear why Cortinas, who did not patent the grant, only received
4,165 acres.

H.H. Edwards patented the survey in May of 1849 (Texas GLO Records, Rusk County Abstract 160).
Edwards, son of Haden Edwards, the leader of the Fredonian Rebellion, was a well-known military
figure and entrepreneur during the early Texas Republic and statehood periods. He resided in
Nacogdoches (Cutrer 2010) and likely purchased the subject property as part of a land speculation
undertaking. In 1860, Edwards appears as a resident of Nacogdoches in the Nacogdoches County
census. In that year, his occupation is denoted as land agent, and he owned $150,000 in real estate.
Edwards died in 1865 when his estate, including his holdings in the Cortinas Survey, was
partitioned among his heirs (Rusk County Deed Records S:447, 79:503).

for $888.10.

Sites 41RK640, 41RK627, and 41RK625

No further information regarding land ownership for the subject property was available in the land
records provided by Luminant until 1902, when Stephen Jones and his wife Sophia A. sold the
143-acre parcel (which included site 41RK640) to Marvin Adams for $800 ($100 in cash and the
remainder in promissory notes) (Rusk County Deed Records 77:53). However; these records do
indicate that Trammell sold property adjacent to this parcel in 1868â1870 (Rusk County Deed
Records 40:62, S:230, 779). The high price of the subject property indicates that it likely included
improvements. Adams retained the property for approximately 10 years, selling it to R.C. Wathen in
1913 for $3,000 (Rusk County Deed Records 88:52). The high value of the property indicates that it
included improvements. Census data indicate that Marvin Adams and his family lived in the vicinity
of the site, but they owned several properties in the area and it is unknown if this property included
their homestead (see history of site 41RK635).

R.C. Wathen and his wife Marie Bonita Wathen owned the 143-acre property for 5 years, selling it in
1918 to J.H. Fitzgerald. The amount of the transaction could not be determined from the
transcription of the deed, which states that it was purchased for $500 in the form of four
promissory notes for $712.50 each. No entry for R.C. Wathen was found in the census records for
1910 or 1920, but according to the deeds of conveyance, he was a resident of Rusk County in 1913
and had relocated to Dallas County by 1918 (Rusk County Deed Records 88:52, 97:330). John H.
Fitzgerald is enumerated in the 1920 Rusk County census as a 33-year-old farmer living on Dirgin
and Church Hill Road, which is located adjacent to the subject tract, suggesting the Fitzgerald family
may have resided on the property. However, the Fitzgeralds only owned this property for 4 years.
Archival evidence indicates that they continued to live and own property in the area through the
1940s (see 41RK644); thus, it is more likely that they used the subject parcel for agricultural
purposes or leased the property out.

In 1922, J.H. Fitzgerald sold the 143-acre parcel to Oscar L. Sanders for $2,700 (Rusk County Deed
Records 123:389). This deed references a gin on the tract that is mortgaged from the Bonner Loan
Company of Dallas for $2,000, explaining the high value of the property. The conditions of the loan
indicate that it was scheduled to be paid in full by 1930. In 1920, census data indicated that Oscar L.
Sanders resided in nearby Panola County. This record lists him as a 40-year-old farmer living with
his wife Effie and two children Ruth and Oliver.

100013883/100196

Sites 41RK640 and 41RK618
Sanders sold 26 acres of the property including site 41RK640 in 1925, at which time he was a
resident of Rusk County (Rusk County Deed Records 126:263). He is listed in the 1930 Rusk County
census residing in Precinct 3, which historically included the project area. Walter Young purchased
26 acres that includes site 41RK640 from Oscar L. Sanders in 1925 for 500 (Rusk County Deed
Records 126:263). The relatively high price of the property suggests that it included improvements,
but likely not the mill referenced in the previous deed, as the price would have presumably been
much higher. Young owned the property for a very short time, selling it in December of 1926 (Rusk
County Deed Records 129:622). This short duration of ownership and the fact that he owned other
property in the area (see history of site 41RK635) suggest that he did not occupy the property but
may have used it for agricultural purposes or leased it out for tenant farming.

Young sold the 26-acre parcel containing site 41RK640 to Miller Adams in 1926 for $500 ($250 in
cash and the remainder in promissory notes). Adams owned the property for less than 1 year,
selling it to Virgil Smith in November of 1927 for $600 ($325 in cash and the remainder in
promissory notes). No entry for Virgil Smith was found in the 1920 Rusk County census records,
but by 1930 he was listed as living in Precinct 3 as a 25-year-old âCattle Tick Inspector,â working
for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. He is listed as renting his property in this record.
Although historians did not find a deed of conveyance from Smith back to Miller Adams, the
property reverted back to Adams, who retained the property until 1934. Miller Adams and his
family are known to have been residents of the project area since the 1880s, and Miller Adams
owned and rented property in the area as early as 1901 (see history of site 41RK635). Thus, it is
unknown if Adams ever occupied the subject parcel.

There is a gap in the chain of title provided by Luminant for the parcel associated with site
41RK618 from 1922 until 1934, when the property was owned by Miller Adams. However, deed
records indicate that the property was owned between those years by P.E. Watson, who sold it to
Miller Adams prior to 1934 (Rusk County Deed Records 257:180). Additionally, this record
indicates that O.L. Sanders did not occupy sites 41RK618 or 41RK640, as his homestead is referred
to on another parcel in the records. Rusk County census records indicate that P.E. Watson did not
live in the vicinity and did not likely occupy the subject tract.
In 1934, Adams sold the parcels, including sites 41RK618 and 41RK640, to M. and Rade Kangerga,
who retained ownership of the parcel until 1944. This transaction also conveyed several tracts
owned by Adams for a total conveyance of 57 acres in consideration of $10 cash and the
cancellation of a vendorâs lien note in the amount of $1,200 (Rusk County Deed Records 257:180).
The Kangergas were merchants who owned a store in Henderson, and it is possible that Adams was
unable to pay his bill at the Kangergasâs store and surrendered his property to fulfill this debt. The
Kangergas lived in Henderson, and any occupation of the parcel during their ownership would be
100013883/100196

92

5. Results of the Archival Research
that of tenants. The Kangergas owned the parcels until January 8, 1944, before selling them, and
additional acreage, to Hardy Sanders for $4,000. It is not known if Hardy Sanders was related to
Oscar Sanders, but he was enumerated in the 1930 Rusk County census, the latest year that data are
available, as a 26-year-old farmer living in Precinct 3. This record also indicates that he owned his
property. By June of 1937, a federal tax lien record suggests that Sanders had moved to Tatum,
although he retained the subject property through October 31, 1953, when he deeded it to his wife
Prudice Sanders (Rusk County Deed Records 512:406; Rusk County Federal Tax Lien Records 3:95).
Subsequent court records indicate that Sanders operated a lumber mill and mercantile business in
Tatum and did not likely occupy the subject tract (Rusk County Abstract of Judgment Records 8:25,
535, 608, 634). Hardy Sanders died in 1959, and his probate file indicates that he maintained
farming operations on his landholdings (Rusk County Probate File #5833).

Site 41RK627

In 1925, O.L. Sanders sold the parcel containing site 41RK627 to M. and Rade Kangerga for
cancellation of a vendorâs lien note for $500 (Rusk County Deed Records 137:64). Other deed
records indicate that the parcel did not include Sandersâs homestead. Sanders purchased the
property back from Kangerga in 1934. Oscar Sanders deeded the property in his son Hardy Sanders
in 1934. There is a gap in the chain of title from 1934 through 1960, when the property was held by
Hardy Sandersâs wife Prudice Sanders. It is likely that she inherited the property upon Hardy
Sandersâs death in 1959. Hardy Sanders is listed in the 1930 Rusk County census as a 26-year-old
farmer living in Precinct 3, which included parts of the general project area. However; it is not
known whether he resided on this property or leased it out to tenants.

Site 41RK625

The 164.4-acre parcel containing site 41RK625 was included in a 176-acre parcel that Berry Adams
purchased from Thomas J. Trammell in 1869 for $656 (Rusk County Deed Records R:214). The high
value of the property indicates that it may have included improvements at the time of purchase.
The 1860 Rusk County census lists Trammell and Adams as living near each other in the Harmony
Hill post office enumeration district, which was historically located in the vicinity of the subject
tract. This record also indicates that Adams owned $1,600 worth of real estate in 1860. The 1870
Rusk County census lists Adams as a 45-year-old farmer living in the Henderson post office
enumeration district. Given that he is listed as living in proximity to other early occupants of the
project area, it appears that the enumeration districts shifted and that Adams had not relocated to
Henderson. His household included his wife Emily, daughter Harriett, and sons B. Miller, Sidney,
William, and Pinkney.

In 1879, Berry Adams sold the property to his son John Q. Adams for $300 (Rusk County Deed
Records 30:522). According to Rusk County census records, in 1880 John Q. Adams was a 32-yearold farmer living in Precinct 3, which historically included the project area, with his wife Martha,
their children Marvin, Ida, Miller, and Iva, and a farm laborer named Frances Cherry. By 1900, John
100013883/100196

Adams continued to live in the project area, and his household included himself, Martha, and their
nephew Tommie Smith. Several of Adamsâs children were listed in adjacent households, suggesting
they may have lived on or adjacent to the subject parcel. Martha Adams died in 1902, and the 1910
Rusk County census indicates that John Adams had remarried by 1910 (Find A Grave Inc. 2003a).
The 1910 Rusk County census lists John Q. Adams and his wife Jennie living on Church Hill and
Dirgin Road. Adams listed his occupation as Farm Manager and identified himself as an employer.
Several farm laborers identified as renters are also listed in the vicinity as well as Adamsâs children
Miller and Marion, who are identified as property owners and employers. This indicates that John
Adams may have rented out part of his property.

By 1920, Adams had relocated to Henderson (U.S. Bureau of the Census 1850â1930); however, he
maintained a residence on the subject tract until 1925 (Rusk County Deed Records 125:402). In
1922, John Q. Adams and wife, Jennie and Marvin Adams, Miller Adams, and Mrs. Iva Matthew,
joined by her husband Chock Matthews, representing the children and heirs of Martha Adams filed
a partition deed to divide the community property of John and Martha Adams. The portion of the
estate containing site 41RK625 was deeded to John and Jennie Adams, who immediately conveyed
it to his son Miller Adams for $2,000 (Rusk County Deed Records 125:482). This conveyance
stipulated that John Adams reserved his dwelling on the property as well as reasonable easement
for egress and ingress. This reservation was vacated in 1925 for $100 (Rusk County Deed Records
125:402).
Miller Adams sold the property to his son Paris Adams in 1928 for $2,165. Although it is possible
that the Miller Adams family occupied the subject tract, they likely lived on property they
previously acquired in the area. In 1930, Paris Adams was a 33-year-old farmer, and his household
included his wife Oder and their sons Lafayette and Glen (U.S. Bureau of the Census 1850â1930).
The 1930 Rusk County census lists them as living on Adams Road in Precinct 3, in the vicinity of the
subject parcel. Although there is a gap in the chain of title for the property in the land records
provided by Luminant from 1928 to 1972, the property was still owned by members of the Paris
Adams family when it was condemned for the construction of Martin Lake.

Results Summary and Analysis: Archival research indicates that the parcel containing sites
41RK640, 41RK618, 41RK627, and 41RK625 were originally associated with the Trammell family,
early county residents and plantation owners during the nineteenth century. Site 41RK625 is likely
associated with the John Q. Adams familyâs occupation/use of the property, as it remained in their
possession from the late 1870s through the 1970s. Sites 41RK627 and 41RK640 may have been
associated with occupation and/or use of the land by tenants of the Kangerga brothers of
Henderson or Hardy Sanders or of Hardy Sanders himself, as artifacts at the site represent a midtwentieth-century occupation. Site 41RK618 dates to the early to mid-twentieth century and is
likely associated with tenants of the Kangergas, Adams, or Watson. None of the sites maintain any
historic associations that would qualify them for inclusion in the NRHP.

Tracts 1319, 1320, 1321, 1323, and the portion of Luminant Tract 1324 located within the Cortinas
Survey were originally part of a 353-acre tract inherited by Haden H. Edwards Jr. upon his fatherâs
death in 1863, and archival evidence indicates that it was associated with absentee landowners
throughout its early history. In 1872, Sarah M. Edwards, the widow of Haden Edwards Sr. and
mother of Haden Edwards Jr., conveyed the parcel at public auction. For purposes of the sale, the
property was divided into nine parcels, all of which were purchased by another of Sarah and Haden
Edwards Sr.âs sons Peyton F. Edwards of Nacogdoches County He was the highest bidder and
purchased all of the land for $1 per acre (Rusk County Deed Records 29:229). The low price
suggests that the tract did not contain improvements, and all of the Edwardses appear as residents
of Nacogdoches in the 1870 census records, suggesting they never occupied the parcel.
Peyton Edwards conveyed the parcel back to Sarah Edwards the following year for $353 gold
dollars (Rusk County Deed Records 29:231), and she retained the property until her death. A
subsequent deed indicates that after her death in 1880, Peyton Edwards and George F. Ingrahan,
executors of her will, conveyed the property to Sarah E. Sparks, one of Edwardsâs heirs. In 1881,
Sparks and her husband James R., who lived in Peyton Edwardsâs household in the 1880
Nacogdoches County census, conveyed the property to Sarah F. Clapp for $300 cash. The record
indicates that she was a widow and resided in Harrison County at the time of the conveyance (Rusk
County Deed Records 28:685). In 1883, Sarah Clapp, through her attorney Jas. F. Starr, sold the
subject 353 acres to T.J. Trammell Jr. and B.S. Wathen for $1,237.30 (Rusk County Deed Records
30:519).

Sites 41RK648 and 41RK650, Luminant Tracts 1319, 1320, 1321, 1323, and Part of 1324

Trammell and Wathen conveyed 100 acres containing the subject tract to Dick Findley in 1883 for
four promissory notes of $125 each (Rusk County Deed Records 32:7). Both T.J. Trammell and B.S.
Wathen appear as residents of Henderson in the 1880 Rusk County census. Their residency outside
of the project area and short association with the property suggest they never occupied the tract.
Additionally, both men maintained interest in various parcels throughout the county, suggesting
they purchased the property as an investment (for examples, see history of sites 41RK632,
41RK633, 41RK636, 41RK642, and 41RK643).

Dick Findley retained the property until his death, and the structural remnants associated with the
subject sites suggest they were created during his familyâs association with the property. Findley
and his family appear in the 1880 Rusk County census. In that year, Dick (47) was identified as

100013883/100196

95

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
mulatto and headed a household containing his wife Tarp (37), who was recorded as black, and
their children Edward (8), Mat (6), and Lewis (5). Dick worked as a farmer, and the family lived in
an area characterized by a mix of mulatto, white, and black residents. An 1863 map of the project
vicinity (see Figure 17) depicts a farm associated with a family named Finely. It is possible the
Findley family was somehow related to or associated with this former plantation (Von Rosenberg
1863).

By 1900, the family lived near known project area resident Wesley Menefee (see history of sites
41RK617, 41RK637, and 41RK610). Dick (70) appears as a property-owning farmer, and the record
denotes him as black rather than mulatto. He had remarried and lived with his wife Jincy (62) and
children Elbert (28), Lonnie (23), and Mary (18). His sons Edward and Lewis lived immediately
adjacent to his household, and both were property-owning farmers. It is likely that the family lived
somewhere on their holdings in the project vicinity, possibly on the subject tract.

Findley died sometime prior to 1909 when T.J. Trammel and B.S. Wathen, residents of Tarrant and
Dallas counties, respectively, officially conveyed title to the 100-acre tract to his heirs. The heirs are
not individually named, and the record indicates that Findley had satisfied the terms of the vendorâs
lien but official title had never been transferred. The record also indicates that tenants were
occupying the property before Findley acquired it. The record refers to the 100 acres as the Bailey
Williams tract and indicates that Williams resided on the property when it was conveyed in 1883
(Rusk County Deed Records 68:29).

Census records confirm that Williams lived in the project vicinity in 1880. In that year, Baley [sic]
Williams, an African American farmer, lived immediately adjacent to other project area residents,
including Wesley Menefee, Aus Baugh [sic], and Peter Humphrey [sic]. The household included his
wife Tess (32) and stepdaughter Molly Davis (17). As no census records are available for 1890, it is
possible that the Williams family continued to live on the property after Findley purchased it.
Williams does not appear in the 1900 Rusk County census.
The heirs of Dick Findley, including E.W. Findley, Hosea Findley, Aldolphus Findley, Mamie Findley,
A.B. Findley, A.V. Findley, and Mary Booty (nee Findley) officially partitioned the property via
recorded deeds in 1931. Mary Booty received a 44.55-acre tract in the Williams Survey containing
the subject parcels, as well as a 46-3/19-acre parcel in the adjacent S.G. Wright Survey (see Early
History of the Samuel Wright Survey) (Rusk County Deed Records 277:600, 124:259).

Mary Findley (18) appears as a resident of her fatherâs household in the 1900 Rusk County census.
Historians were unable to find an entry for her in the 1910 or 1920 census records, but her future
husband Larkin Booty appears as a resident of the project vicinity in the 1920 census. Booty (60)
owned his home on Prospect Road and lived with his wife Sarah (52) and two children near
members of the Barr, Menefee, and Humphries families (see history of sites 41RK617 and
41RK649). By 1930, Larkin had remarried, and he and Mary (45) lived along the Liberty to Chapel
100013883/100196

96

5. Results of the Archival Research
Hill Road on a farm he owned. They may have lived on the subject property, but it is also possible
that they occupied the property Booty owned in 1920. Mary and Larkin Booty died in 1938,
although their probate records were not provided in the Luminant tract files for the subject tracts,
it appears that their daughter Willie Booty Peterson and her husband Calup Peterson inherited the
property (Luminant Tract File, Tract 1323).
The 2.78 acres containing site 41RK648 was partitioned out of the 44.55-acre tract in 1974, and a
1982 mechanicâs lien indicates that there was a dwelling on the property at that time (Rusk County
Deed Records 990:857; Rusk County Mechanicâs Lien Records 91:164). It is unclear how old the
dwelling was, and it could have been constructed by the Bootys or by a member of the Peterson
family, including Willie Peterson and E.L. and Ocie Peterson. The mechanicâs lien was taken out by
E.L. and Ocie Peterson to remodel the existing dwelling on the premises. They proposed to pour a
concrete foundation around the house, add brick to the exterior, trim the windows, add a front and
back porch, and make numerous internal improvements. From the description, it appears that the
couple was updating an older house. As a result, the site could represent an earlier occupation than
indicated by the more modern remnants recorded at site 41RK648.

The 4.78-acre parcel containing site 41RK650 was also partitioned from the Peterson estate in
1974. In that year, it was conveyed by the Peterson heirs to Weber Peterson, who owned it until his
death in 1980 (Luminant Tract File, Tract 1325; Rusk County Deed Records 277:600). The site
includes a circa 1935 bungalow that may have been built by the Bootys or other members of the
Peterson or Findley families. The Peterson family continued to own the lands associated with
Luminant Tracts 1319, 1320, 1321, 1323, and the portion of 1324 located within the Cortinas
Survey through the historic period.

Site 41RK620

There is a gap in the early chain of title for the portion of the parcel including site 41RK620 within
the Cortinas Survey from 1883, when T.J. Trammell and B.S. Wathen acquired the 353 acres
including the subject property, until 1920, when Gency [sic] Finley, wife of Dick Finley [sic], sold the
115-acre portion of the parcel containing site 41RK620 to their son Edward Finley for $1 (Rusk
County Deed Records 64:344). The Dick Findley family had lived in the project area since at least
1880 and owned property in the vicinity as early as 1883 (see history of sites 41RK648 and
41RK650). Historians did not find any entry for Edward Findley in the 1920 census; however,
several Findleys are recorded in the record residing in the project vicinity. The 1930 Rusk County
census lists Edward Finley [sic] as a 65-year-old farmer living along the Liberty-Chapel Hill Road
with his wife Dora and daughter Reba. This record indicates that they owned their home farm.
There are several renters enumerated in the vicinity of the Edward Findley family, and these may
constitute tenants of the Findleys or their neighbors.

100013883/100196

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
Edward Findley died in 1952 and left all of his estate to his daughter Reba Finley Williams (Rusk
County Deed Records 992:850). It is unknown if the Williamses occupied the subject tract. In 1955,
Grady and Reba Williams sold the property to J.H. Fitzgerald Jr. for an unknown amount (Rusk
County Deed Records 512:159). Fitzgerald retained the property through the early 1970s, when it
was sold to Texas Utilities Services Inc. for the construction of Martin Lake (Rusk County Deed
Records 963:661).

Site 41RK619

There is a gap in the early chain of title for the parcel including site 41RK619 from when it was
patented in 1849 to January 18, 1906, when B.S. Wathen, of Dallas County, conveyed the 50-acre
tract containing site 41RK619 to Jim Thompson for $211.50 in the form of one vendorâs lien note
(Rusk County Deed Records 85:549). There is a small gap in the chain of title as there was no record
of Trammellâs conveyance of his interest in the property to B.S. Wathen in the Luminant land
records. The 1900 Rusk County census lists Jim Thompson living in Precinct 3, which historically
included the subject tract, as a 48-year-old African American farmer. His household included his
wife Louisa and two daughters Margie and Alice. This record also indicates that he owned his
property, indicating that he was living in the project area on land he owned prior to his purchase of
the subject tract in 1906.Thompson retained the property through at least 1917, when a Release of
Lien was filed indicating that Thompson had satisfied the terms of the loan from B.S. Wathen (Rusk
County Deed Records 103:343). In 1910, census data indicate that Thompson continued to reside in
the project area in the vicinity of other known area landowners including the Peter Gray family.
There is a gap in the chain of title between 1917 and 1930, when Royal Booty and his wife Alice
sold the 50-acre parcel to William Ballenger and wife Louise for $110 (Rusk County Deed Records
150:534). It is possible that Alice Booty was Jim Thompsonâs daughter, and that she and Royal
Booty acquired the property following the death of Jim Thompson. Alice Thompson was 16 years
old in 1910, according to the Rusk County census. There was no entry for any members of the
Thompson family in the 1920 census, but in the 1930 census, Alice Booty is listed as 36 years old.
Furthermore, there is a burial in the Chapel Hill/Trammel Cemetery, a nearby African American
cemetery, for James Thompson, who passed away in 1919.
William and Louise Ballenger acquired the property in 1930 and retained it through their deaths
sometime prior to 1945, when the heirs of William and Louise Ballenger sold their interest in the
property back to Royal and Alice Booty for $100 (Rusk County Deed Records 394:557). According
to the 1930 Rusk County census, William Ballenger lived in Precinct 1, on the Old Henderson and
Church Hill Road, suggesting they did not occupy the subject property. The Bootys then conveyed
the property to Reagan and William B. Taylor in 1952 for $10. The Taylors owned the property into
the 1970s, when it was acquired for the construction of Martin Lake.

5. Results of the Archival Research

Sites 41RK628 and 41RK12
Chain of title information provided by Luminant for the property containing these sites was limited
to several deeds from the heirs of Peter Gray conveying their interest in the property for the
construction of Martin Lake. The abstract file provided by Luminant notes that there were many
defects in the early chain of title for the parcel, but that Peter Gray acquired the northern
approximately 102-acre portion of the property in 1891 and the southern 23 acres in 1906. Both
tracts were acquired from B.S. Wathen (Colley and Lloyd 1972). Based on maps included in the
property records provided by Luminant for adjacent properties, it appears that this parcel was part
of the 353-acre Haden H. Edwards tract and shares its early history with the rest of this property.
Additionally, site 41RK628 is located in close proximity to a previously identified archeological site
41RK12. Site 41RK12 has been linked to the Peter Gray family (see Site Description for site
41RK12). Given the proximity of the two sites and the ambiguous site boundary for site 41RK12, it
is possible that site 41RK628 may represent what was originally recorded as site 41RK12,
constitute an extension of site 41RK12, or in fact be a separate site associated with a separate
occupation, perhaps that of tenants.

Peter Gray is listed in the Rusk County census as early as 1880 living in Precinct 3. This record lists
him as an African American farmer, and his household consisted of his wife Victoria and two sons.
By 1900, his household had expanded to include his wife and 12 children. This record states that he
owned his property with a clear title and lived in proximity to other known area landholders
including Dick Findley. The 1910 Rusk County census indicates that he continued to reside in the
project area, likely on the subject tract. This record also identifies his children Josephine, Annie,
Thomas, Silas, and Rufus as farm laborers on their home farm, further suggesting that the Gray
family lived on and conducted agricultural operations on the subject parcel. Census records suggest
that Peter Gray continued to live on the subject parcel through 1930. The 1930 census lists several
renters living adjacent to Peter Gray, two of whom were his sons Rufus and Thomas. Thus, it is
possible that site 41RK628 is associated with the occupation of the Peter Gray family or his tenants.

Site 41RK34

The earliest transaction included in the Luminant files for the tract including site 41RK34 dates to
1891, when B.S. Wathen and T.J. Trammell sold the parcel containing site 41RK34 to John
Humphries [sic] for $455 (Rusk County Deed Records 40:579). Trammell and B.S. Wathen are listed
as residents of Henderson in the 1880 Rusk County census. Their residency outside of the project
area and short association with the property suggest they never occupied the tract. Additionally,
both men maintained interest in various parcels throughout the county, suggesting they purchased
the property as an investment (for examples, see history of sites 41RK632, 41RK633, 41RK636,
41RK642, and 41RK643). Humphries [sic] appears in the 1880 Rusk County census as an African
American residing in Precinct 3, which included the project area, with his wife Hattie and children
Eliza, John, and Maud. This record does not indicate if Humphrey owned any real estate, but he
100013883/100196

99

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
listed his occupation as âfarm laborer,â suggesting he did not own his home farm. In 1900 he was
enumerated in the same district, and his household included his wife Hattie, children John Jr., Maud,
Lewis, Ambroth, and Alice, and grandchildren Webb and Annie Bates. This record lists the
Humphrey family living one household away from the Dick Findley family, who owned the tract
immediately south of the subject parcel, indicating that the Humphrey family may have resided on
the property. By 1910, Humphrey had remarried but continued to reside in the project area
through 1930, the last year census records were available. Although most of his neighbors were
landowners, there were a few renters enumerated adjacent to the Humphrey family, suggesting
that he may have rented out part of his farm to tenant farmers.
John Humphries [sic] died in 1938, and his property was divided into shares among many heirs,
who retained the property through the late 1970s (Rusk County Probate Records 31:430; Rusk
County Deed Records 936:73).

Site 41RK664

The Luminant tract file for the parcel containing site 41RK664 has a gap in the early land history
from 1849, when Haden Edwards patented the Cortinas Survey, until 1893, when T.J. Trammell sold
the property to B.S. Wathen. On March 17, 1893, T.J. Trammell, a resident of Montague County, sold
1,356 acres of land in the Cortinas Survey to B.S. Wathen for $2,000 (Rusk County Deed Records
41:488). Historic research indicates that Wathen did not likely occupy the subject tract (see history
of sites 41RK632 and 41RK633). The value of the land at the time of this conveyance was slightly
higher than average, which may indicate the presence of improvements on the property or may
simply reflect the propertyâs location along Crawfordâs Creek and its suitability for cultivation.

Wathen retained the portion of this land containing the subject site until 1905, when he sold a
700-acre tract including the subject site to C.A. Price for $3,150 (Rusk County Deed Records
70:239). C.A. Price owned a large amount of land in the general area, and it is unknown if he ever
resided on the subject tract. In 1916, Price and his wife Annie sold 100 acres, including the subject
tract, to S.G. Nutt for $2,727 (Rusk County Deed Records 92:165). The high value of the land
indicates that it may have been improved at the time of this conveyance. Census records indicate
that Nutt did not occupy the property; therefore, any improvements on the parcel at the time of
conveyance were likely associated with tenants or squatters. The 1910 Cottle County census lists
Samuel G. Nutt as a 34-year-old farmer living on his home farm in the Texas Panhandle. His
household also included his wife Ida A. and children Dax A., Ruby, Willie, and Ola.
Nutt apparently relocated to Rusk County between 1910 and 1920, when he was listed in the Rusk
County census. He likely moved following his purchase of the subject property in 1916. The 1920
Rusk County census lists Samuel G. Nutt as a 45-year-old farmer living on Church Hill Road, one
household away from John Fitzgerald, who owned adjacent property to the subject 100 acres. Nuttâs
household included his wife Millie (age 25), sons Alvery, Willie, and Grady (ages 21, 15, and 4), and

100013883/100196

100

5. Results of the Archival Research
daughters Ruby, Ola, Bernice, and Irene (ages 16, 11, 2, and 1). The Nutts owned the property
through 1933, having taken out several liens against the property. It appears that they sold the
property to M. Kangerga of Henderson for $200 and assumption and release of any indebtedness
related to the property (Rusk County Deed Records 241:12, 146:80; Rusk County Deed of Trust
Records J:92). Samuel G. Nutt was enumerated in the 1930 Panola County census as a 56-year-old
farmer living on Highway 43 in Tatum. However, his son Alvery continued to reside in Rusk County
next to John Fitzgerald on Church Hill Road. A cluster of buildings is evident at the location of site
41RK664 on a 1935 aerial photograph (Tobin International 1935).
Kangerga owned the property from 1933 through 1944, when he sold it and an additional
60.6 acres to R.E. Brooks for $3,500. R.E. Brooks sold the property to his son R.J. Brooks in 1954 for
$10. The property remained in the Brooks family through 2006.
Results Summary and Analysis: The parcels containing sites 41RK34, 41RK619, 41RK620,
41RK628, 41RK648 and 41RK650 and Luminant Tracts 1319, 1320, 1321, 1323, and 1324 were
associated with various absentee owners during the mid-nineteenth century, including members of
the Haden Edwards family, Sarah Sparks, and Sarah Clapp. The property was subsequently
associated with local land speculators T.J. Trammell and B.S. Wathen, who conveyed it to Dick
Findley in 1883. Any occupants of the property during this period would have been tenants and/or
squatters.
The parcel containing sites 41RK648 and 41RK650 and Luminant Tracts 1319, 1320, 1321, 1323,
and part of 1324 were subsequently owned by members of the Dick Findley family and his heirs
and descendants from 1883 through the mid-twentieth century, and sites 41RK648 and 41RK650
appear to be associated with their occupation and/or use of the land. Additionally, the tracts
containing the sites were reportedly occupied by Bailey Williams prior to Findleyâs acquisition of
the property. Census records confirm that Bailey, an African American farmer, lived in the project
vicinity in 1880, and his family may have continued to live on the property as tenants during its
association with the Findleys.

The tract containing site 41RK619 was subsequently owned by members of the Jim Thompson,
Royal Booty, and William Ballenger families from 1906 through the 1950s. Site 41RK619 may have
been associated with the occupation of these families or of tenant farmers who may have occupied
the site. The tract containing site 41RK628 was owned by the Peter Gray family from the turn of the
twentieth century through the 1970s. The parcel containing site 41RK620 was associated with the
Dick Findley/Edward Findley family from 1906 through the mid-1950s. It is unknown if they ever
occupied the portion of the parcel containing the identified archeological site, as they owned a large
amount of property. However, it is most likely that site 41RK620 is associated with their occupation
of the property or that of any tenants who may have lived on the property (U.S. Bureau of the
Census 1850â1930).
100013883/100196

101

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
The tract containing sites 41RK12 and 41RK628 appears to have been associated with the Peter
Gray family, who owned and occupied the tract prior to 1900. The heirs and descendants of Peter
Gray retained the property through the 1970s, when they sold portions of it for the creation of
Martin Lake. It is likely that one or both of these sites is associated with the Peter Gray homestead
or that of his descendants, heirs, or tenants.

Trammell and Wathen sold the parcel including site 41RK34 to John Humphries [sic] in 1891.
Humphrey owned the property from 1891 until his death in 1938 and was known to have lived in
the general area. Following his death, his heirs held the property through the 1970s. Thus,
archeological deposits from 1891 through the end of the historic period are likely associated with
Humphreyâs occupation of the property or that of his tenants or squatters.

The associated property history fits into a pattern of African American land ownership seen at
various sites throughout the project area, and the tracts containing the sites were within a distinct
African American community historically located within the project vicinity. Though not an
incorporated community according to traditional interpretations, the African American residents in
the area, including members of the Findley, Booty, Thompson, Ballenger, Humphrey, Barr, and
Menefee families, maintained their own church, school, and cemetery and owned property on
which they lived and farmed.

Despite the sitesâ potential associations with African American property owners, an
underrepresented group in the historic record, neither possesses the potential to provide
additional information about this group to the historic record. Furthermore, though additional
archival research could provide more information about the local African American community, it
would not likely provide clarification about the history of the subject sites. As a result, no further
research is recommended in connection with the current project. The associated families do not
maintain any known associations that would qualify the sites for NRHP listing under Criterion B,
and the sites do not maintain broader associations with local developmental patterns that would
qualify them for listing under Criterion A.

Site 41RK650 also contains a structural component. Though it dates to the period that the Findleys
were associated with the property, its age suggests it was not their original homestead. This site
includes a circa 1935 wood-framed bungalow with a front-gabled roof, exposed rafter tails, and a
projecting full-width porch with replacement wooden support posts. The primary entry is located
centrally on the western faÃ§ade and consists of a replacement hinged door with a nonhistoric-age
metal-and-glass storm door. There are two pairs of symmetrically placed 3/1 windows on either
side of the entry and a large replacement exterior brick chimney on the southern lateral faÃ§ade.
This resource lacks integrity of materials, workmanship, design, and feeling due to the replacement
porch components and chimney. Additionally, it is of ubiquitous design and lacks known historic
associations that would qualify it for NRHP inclusion under Criterion A, B, or C.

5. Results of the Archival Research
Site 41RK664 appears to have been associated with absentee landowners during its early history.
B.S. Wathen and C.A. Price owned the property up to 1919, and any archeological deposits from that
period were likely associated with tenants of Price or Wathen. Site 41RK664 is most likely
associated with the propertyâs association with Samuel G. Nutt and his family. Nutt appears to have
occupied the property from circa 1919 through at least 1920, and his son resided on the property
until at least 1930. The site does not possess any significant historic associations that would merit
its inclusion in the NRHP under any applicable criteria.

Sites 41RK632 and 41RK633, Luminant Tracts 1243, 1244, 1245, and 1246

After the 1849 patent date for the Cortinas Survey, there is a significant gap in the chain of title data
provided by Luminant pertaining to the 71.8-acre tract containing sites 41RK632 and 41RK633 and
Luminant Tracts 1243, 1244, 1245, and 1246.

Project archeologists did not have access to tracts 1243, 1244, 1245, and 1246; therefore, the
presence of archeological sites at these locations could not be confirmed or dismissed. The portion
of the survey containing the subject tracts does not reappear in the deed record until 1893 when
T.J. and M.A. Trammell of Montague County conveyed two parcels in the Cortinas Survey (865 and
491 acres) to B.S. Wathen, a resident of Rusk County. Wathen purchased both parcels for $2,000
with a vendorâs lien (Rusk County Deed Records 41:488). Though the Trammells relocated prior to
conveying the subject property, the family appears in the 1880 Rusk County census as residents of
Henderson. The household included T.J. Jr., a 39-year-old merchant, his wife M.A. (32), and their
children R.E. (10), Jno. T. (4), and J.E. (1). The family does not appear in the 1870 Rusk County
census, though T.J.âs father lived in the area, and in 1860, Thomas J. (19) lived in his fatherâs
household in Harmony Hill, which is located near but outside of the current project area to the
northeast. As it is unclear how long they owned the property, it is possible the Trammells lived
somewhere on their substantial holdings between census years and/or employed tenants who
occupied the parcel. See the history of site 41RK617 for additional information about other
members of the Trammell family who maintained early associations with the project vicinity.

B.S. Wathen appears in the 1880 Rusk County census as a resident of Marshall Street in Henderson.
The 36-year-old civil engineer lived with his wife Eudora (28) and their two children Eugene (2)
and M. (2 months). By 1900, he had remarried and relocated to Oasis in Dallas County where he still
worked as civil engineer. Wathen retained interest in the subject property until 1905, and though it
is possible that he lived there between census years, his occupation and residence in Henderson
and then outside of Rusk County makes it unlikely. In December of 1905, Wathen, listed as a
resident of Dallas County, conveyed 670 acres (700 acres less 30 previously conveyed from within
its boundaries) to C.A. Price, a resident of Rusk County for $3,150 with a vendorâs lien (Rusk County
Deed Records 70:329). The high value of the property suggests that it might have contained
improvements by this time.

Sites 41RK632 and 41RK633
In 1915, C.A. Price and his wife Annie B. conveyed 88 acres (containing sites 41RK632 and
41RK633) out of their 670-acre holdings to M.E. Watson with a vendorâs lien (Rusk County Deed
Records 92:115). Price, a 32-year-old farmer, appears in the 1910 Rusk County census living with
his wife Annie (30), their children Lola (6) and Rilie (2), and Willie W. Reese (32), a farm laborer.
Though it is possible they lived somewhere on the larger 670-acre tract, it is more likely they lived
on the portion they retained rather than on the subject property.

Watson acquired an additional, adjacent 12-acre tract from Price in 1916 (Rusk County Deed
Records 92:116). The Watson family retained interest in the 100 acres through the remainder of
the twentieth century. In 1910, Millard E. Watson (indexed as 45) worked as a farm laborer and
rented his property in Bell County. He lived with his wife Nannie M. (26) and children Emma [sic â
should be Irma] E. (17), Basil E. (16), Bursa [sic â should be Percy] E. (11), Malvin (2), and Nona (9
months). An affidavit of heirship from 2003 indicates that Nannie was Millardâs second wife and
that Irma, Basil, and Percy were his children with Unie Davis Watson (Rusk County Deed Records
2403:289). By 1920, the family had relocated to Rusk County, and though it is unclear exactly
where they lived, they may have lived on the subject parcel. In that year, the family lived along the
Stewart and Church Hill Road, and M.E. (indexed as 51) owned his own farm. The household
included Nannie (36), Percy (19), Melvin [sic] (11), Nona (9), and Allie (4) and was located in the
Tatum voting precinct. Tatum is located nearby and to the northeast of the current project area.
According to the current landowner, Mr. Euel Faulkner, his wife was born in a house that used to be
present on the parcel containing the subject sites, and her family occupied the house in the early
twentieth century. It is possible she may have been a member of Millard or Percy Watsonâs family.

In 1923, M.E. and Nannie Watson conveyed both the 88- and 12-acre parcels, as well as an
additional 27-acre parcel in the Cortinas Survey, to P.E. Watson, M.E. Watsonâs son, for $1,300 with
a vendorâs lien (Rusk County Deed Records 122:614). Percy Watson only retained the property for
approximately 2 years before conveying all three parcels back to his father in September of 1925. In
the conveyance, M.E. Watson agreed to assume the remaining notes on the property (Rusk County
Deed Records 126:37). Although the date of the conveyance is unclear, M.E. and Nannieâs son
Malvin E. Watson owned both parcels by 1953 (Rusk County Deed Records 507:644). A title opinion
on the tract indicates that the heirs of M.E. Watson conveyed the property to Malvin Watson after
M.E. Watsonâs death (TXU Preliminary Title Opinion 1973), and census records suggest that both
Malvin and his brother Percy may have lived on the property. The current property owner,
Mr. Faulkner, indicates that a house that once stood at this location was moved to another location
sometime after World War II. The 1935 aerial shows a structure at 41RK632, while the 1958
topographic map shows a structure at 41RK633. It is probable that 41RK632 is the site that
contained the house where Mrs. Faulkner was born, while 41RK633 represents a later occupation.

5. Results of the Archival Research
It appears that M.E. Watson passed away some time prior to 1930. In that year, his wife Nannie and
her two daughters Nona (21) and Vesta (16) appear in the household of her son Marshall [sic â
should be Malvin] H. (22) living with his wife Edna M. (18). The group lived one household away
from M.E. Watsonâs son Percy E. Watson and his family, including wife Tressie M. (25) and children
Billie G. (5), Gwyndolin [sic] (3), and Bobbie S. (1). Both men were farmers on their own land and
lived along what was referred to as Adams Road. Though it is unclear where this road was in
relation to the current project area, other suspected project area residents, including the St. Claire
and Young families, lived along it as well (see history of sites 41RK644 and 41RK635). In addition,
sites 41RK632 and 41RK633 are both located along a roadway and may represent separate
occupations by the brothers. A 2003 Affidavit of Heirship indicates that Percy Watson died in 1933
(Rusk County Deed Records 2403:289), though it is possible that his family continued to reside on
the farm after his death. The property remained in the Malvin Watson family through the
remainder of the twentieth century.

Results Summary and Analysis: Archival evidence suggests that sites 41RK632 and 41RK633
were associated with the use and/or occupation of the associated property by members of the M.E.
Watson family from circa 1915 through the mid-twentieth century, including the families of his
sons Malvin and Percy Watson. According to the current landowner, his wifeâs family occupied a
house at the location of these sites in the early twentieth century. This structure was moved to
another location sometime after World War II. Prior to 1915, the property could have been used or
occupied by unknown owners, their tenants, and/or squatters (1849âbefore 1893), T.J. and M.A.
Trammell and/or associated tenants (before 1893), tenants in the employ of B.S. Wathen (1893â
1905), and C.A. Price and/or associated tenants (1905â1915). Neither site maintains known
associative significance that would qualify it for NRHP listing under Criterion A or B.

Luminant Tracts 1243, 1244, 1245, and 1246

In 1909, C.A. Price sold a 100-acre parcel including all of tracts 1243, 1244, 1245, and 1246 to
Marvin Adams for five vendorâs lien notes for $187.50 each (Rusk County Deed Records 73:229).
Marvin Adams owned the property for only 2 years, selling it to W.T. (William Turner) Adams in
1912 for $500 cash and $500 in vendorâs lien notes (Rusk County Deed Records 73:230). The high
value of the property suggests that it included improvements at the time of this transaction. Marvin
Adams had been a resident of the project area for many years prior to his ownership of these tracts
(see history of site 41RK637) and only owned this property for a short time, suggesting he did not
occupy the subject tracts.

William Turner Adams was listed in the 1910 Rusk County census as a 27-year-old farmer living in
his parentsâ Cid and Bettie Adamsâ household along the Church Hill and Dirgin Road. William
Turner Adams operated a gin and sawmill in Dirgin and owned a large amount of land in the area
(Winfrey 1961). In the 1920 Rusk County census, William Turner Adams was enumerated as a
37-year-old farmer and sawmill operator living in Dirgin on the Dirgin and Stewart Road. This road
100013883/100196

105

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
does not correspond to any extant roadways, but was likely in the vicinity of Luminant Tracts 1243,
1244, 1245, and 1246, given their proximity to Dirgin. William Turnerâs household included his
wife Grace and her 71-year-old father W.S. Fall, whose occupation was listed as a general practice
physician. The William Turner Adams household was listed two households away from his father
Cyd Adams, who was shown to live at the Dirgin store with several renters also listed in the vicinity.

In 1920, William Turner and Grace Adams sold the property containing these four tracts to S.A.
Adams and T.J. Wright for $1,500 cash and one venderâs lien note for $1,500 (Rusk County Deed
Records 123:452). Given the high value of the property, it likely contained improvements. However,
Wright and Adams held the property for less than a year, selling it back to William Turner Adams in
1921 for $2,500, who then sold it back to S.A. Adams 4 months later for $2,000 and the assumption
of a 1/6 indebtedness to the Federal Land Bank, secured by the property (Rusk County Deed
Records 112:40; Rusk County Deed of Trust Records J:68). S.A. Adams and his wife Floyd Adams
retained the property until September of 1908 (Rusk County Deed Records 139:392). Historians
did not find any listing for S.A. Adams or T.J. Wright in the 1920 Rusk County census. However; T.J.
(Thomas Jefferson) Wright and his wife Amanda Emily Wright are buried in the nearby Harmony
Hill Cemetery, suggesting an association with the general vicinity.

In 1928, S.A. Adams and his wife Floyd Adams sold the property including the subject tracts to
Walter Young for $2,140 ($440 in cash, $700 in vendorâs lien notes, and the assumption of the
remaining balance of a lien on the property in favor of the Federal Land Bank) (Rusk County Deed
Records 139:392). However, there is a defect in the chain of title provided by Luminant during this
time period as William Turner Adams retained some interest in the property, deeding a right-ofway easement to Rusk County in 1938 (Rusk County Deed Records 326:340). Although the exact
relationship between Walter Young and William Turner Adams is unclear, they both retained
interest in the property through 1946, when William Turner and Grace Adams deeded the
Â±35.43 acres comprising Luminant Tracts 1243, 1244, 1245, and 1246 to Walter Young for $500
cash and one vendorâs lien note for $235.75. Walter Young is listed in the 1930 Rusk County census
as a 28-year-old farmer living on Adams Road, which was likely located near the subject tracts. He
is listed as owning his land, and his household included his wife Ruby and daughter Mildred. W.T.
Adams was also listed in this record as living on Adams Road. Several renters are also listed as
living along this road. Walter Young retained the property through his death in 2003 (Rusk County
Probate Records 03-068P).

Results Summary and Analysis: Archival evidence suggests that any sites located on Luminant
Tracts 1243, 1244, 1245, and 1246 dating to circa 1910â1946 may be associated with either the
Marvin Adams, William Turner Adams, or Walter Young families or their tenants. Prior to 1909, the
property could have been used or occupied by unknown owners, their tenants, and/or squatters.
None of these tracts maintains known associative significance that would qualify it for NRHP listing
under Criterion A or B.

5. Results of the Archival Research

Sites 41RK642 and 41RK643
The 55.53-acre parcel containing site 41RK643 and the two 25-acre parcels containing site
41RK642 also came out of the 670-acre tract in the Cortinas Survey purchased by C.A. Price in 1905
(Rusk County Deed Records 70:329) (see history of sites 41RK632 and 41RK633). The parcels were
formed out of a 316-acre portion of the tract comprised of three parcels (1, 73, and 280 acres) sold
to different individuals during the early twentieth century. Oscar Benton conveyed the 1-acre
parcel to F.W. Beall in 1916 (Rusk County Deed Records 108:417). It is unclear when Benton
acquired the property, though it was sometime between 1905, when C.A. Price purchased the
670-acre parcel, and the 1916 conveyance date. In 1919, C.A. Price conveyed the other two tracts
from which the 316 acres were created. The first parcel included 73 acres purchased by M.E.
Watson, and the second contained 280 acres purchased by C.W. Norris (Rusk County Deed Records
101:297, 100:218). In subsequent years the property was associated with various investors, and it
appears that it may have been occupied by tenants during the early twentieth century. The
intervening histories of each of the parcels are outlined below.
The first transaction involving the 1-acre parcel appears in 1916 when Oscar Benton conveyed the
property to F.W. Beall for $1 (Rusk County Deed Records 108:417). Though it is unclear where this
1-acre tract is in relation to the subject parcels, Oscar Benton appears to have lived in the project
vicinity in 1910. Census records from that year indicate he lived on the Church Hill and Dirgin Road,
which runs through the project area (Texas State Highway Department 1936). The record indicates
that he was an African American farmer who owned his property. He lived with his wife Mattie L.
(40) and their nine children. By 1920, Benton was remarried, and the family lived in the Stewart
Post Office Precinct. Stewart was a small farming community located near but outside of the current
project area to the northwest (Biesele 2010c; Texas State Highway Department 1936). Because the
location of the 1-acre parcel in relation to sites 41RK642 and/or 41RK643 is unclear, it is possible,
though unlikely, that one or both was associated with the Benton family.

F.W. Beall retained the 1-acre parcel until 1921 when he and his wife (no name provided) conveyed
the property to H.J. Peek for $200 (Rusk County Deed Records 114:236). Peek eventually acquired
all three of the subject parcels, and the relatively high value of the 1-acre tract suggests that it
contained improvements at this time. The associated deed record indicates that Beall was a
resident of Rusk County; however, historians were unable to find an entry for him in the 1910,
1920, or 1930 Rusk County census records.

As referenced above, C.A. Price, joined by his wife Annie B. Price, conveyed the 280-acre parcel from
which a portion of the 316-acre subject tract was formed to C.W. Norris in 1919. Norris paid
$12,400 for the property with a vendorâs lien including $500 cash and seven promissory notes for
$1,700 due annually. The record describes the tract as 310 acres less a 30-acre parcel that had
previously been conveyed to known project area resident John Humphreys [sic] (see history of sites
41RK617, 41RK649 and 41RK637) (Rusk County Deed Records 100:218). The high price indicates
100013883/100196

107

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
the property contained improvements. After this initial conveyance, the parcel continued to change
hands rapidly over the next few years. Norris, who does not appear in the 1910 or 1920 Rusk
County census records, retained the parcel for less than 5 months before conveying it to J.W. Price.
Later records reveal that J.W. Price was C.A. Priceâs brother (Rusk County Deed Records 335:14).
Price paid Norris $500 in cash and assumed the existing notes on the property due to C.A. Price
(Rusk County Deed Records 109:416).

The same month, J.W. Price, who does not appear in contemporary Rusk County census records,
conveyed 242 acres (later deeds reference the parcel as 242.4 acres) of the 280-acre tract to F.W.
Beall for $9,680, including $3,500 cash and the remainder in five promissory notes (Rusk County
Deed Records 113:148). A deed of trust filed for record in 1920 indicates that the 242.4-acre parcel
included all of the 310-acre tract except for a 60.6-acre tract and a 7-acre tract that had been
previously conveyed (Rusk County Deed Records 113:73). Beall only retained the tract until
December of 1920 when he and his wife Alice M. sold the property, described as 242 acres, to H.J.
Peek for $9,680 (Rusk County Deed Records 114:235).

During the same period, C.A. Price sold the final tract comprising the subject 316 acres to M.E.
Watson. In 1919, Watson paid $2,190 with four promissory notes for the 73-acre tract, which was
near other tracts his family appears to have occupied (Rusk County Deed Records 101:297) (see the
history of sites 41RK632 and 41RK633 for more information about the Watson family). In April of
1921, Watson conveyed the tract to H.J. Peek, giving him control of the entire 316-acre tract from
which the subject 55.53-acre and two 25-acre parcels were created (Rusk County Deed Records
115:4). Census records and subsequent deed evidence suggest that Peek never lived on the
property and likely employed tenants there during his tenure of ownership.

Hiram J. Peek (aged 62 and 72, respectively) appears in both the 1920 and 1930 Rusk County
census records as a resident of the city of Henderson. In both years he lived with his wife Carrie L.
on North Marshall Street and is not recorded as having an occupation. Their continued residence in
Henderson during the period suggests they did not occupy the subject 316 acres. In 1934, H.J. and
C.L. Peek entered into a contract with D.B. Wyatt involving the 242-, 73-, and 1-acre tracts
(316 acres total). In the document, which is recorded in the deed record, the Peeks agreed to sell
the land to Wyatt in exchange for 120 bales of Middling-class cotton. Wyatt was to deliver half of his
cotton yield to the Peeks every year until he met the quota, and if he failed to deliver in even one
year (except in case of disaster), the land would revert to the grantors. Additionally, if the contract
was voided, Wyatt had to vacate the premises on demand and could not remove any of the existing
improvements, which would be confiscated as rental on the property. Finally, Wyatt was expected
to maintain the existing improvements on the property and was not entitled to cut or sell any of the
existing timber until the contract had been satisfied (Rusk County Deed Records 258:475). The
nature of this agreement and the insinuation that improvements existed on the property suggests
that tenants, including D.B. Wyatt, may have occupied and cultivated the land during the early
twentieth century.

5. Results of the Archival Research
Historians were unable to find an entry for Wyatt in the 1920 or 1930 Texas census records, but if
he worked as a tenant farmer, he may have moved around regularly. It is also possible that other
unknown tenants occupied the property during the early twentieth century when it changed hands
numerous times. Wyatt was either unable or unwilling to satisfy the terms of the contract. In March
of 1935, the Peeks filed an affidavit with the clerk of court, which indicated that Wyatt had
ârescinded and cancelledâ the contract and relocated to another part of the state. The Peeks were
unable to locate him and were filing the document âin order to show that the said Wyatt has
abandoned and surrendered said contract to affiant and moved awayâ (Rusk County Deed Records
264:467).

In December of that same year, the Peeks conveyed the three subject tracts to Riley Price, the son of
the original owner C.A. Price, for $4,000 with vendorâs liens. The conveyance references
improvements on the property, suggesting it may have been occupied by tenants at the time of the
conveyance (Rusk County Deed Records 293:99). Riley Price conveyed the property to his father in
September of 1937. In return, his father agreed to assume the existing vendorâs liens on the tracts
(Rusk County Deed Records 317:196).

Riley Price appears as a resident of his fatherâs household in the 1910, 1920, and 1930 Rusk County
census records. In 1930, the 21-year-old worked as a farm laborer, and his father represented one
of the only property owners living in the area. If C.A. Price lived on his holdings in the project
vicinity, the census entry suggests he employed tenants on his property. A 1939 affidavit provided
by H.J. Peek and F.W. Beall indicated that the 316-acre tract had been in use by various individuals
during the early twentieth century for crop cultivation and livestock grazing. The document did not
list the individuals by name (Rusk County Deed Records 335:14).

The same year, C.A. and Annie B. Price, accompanied by P.J. McNee, lien holder, sold the subject
property to J.M. Grant for $3,796.80 with an associated vendorâs lien (Rusk County Deed Records
333:549). The subject parcels remained in the Grant family through at least the late twentieth
century. J.M. Grant appears as a property-owning farmer living in the project vicinity in the 1930
Rusk County census. Grant (32) lived with his family, including Sudie (28), Olan [sic] (8), Silvey (6),
Lewis (4), and Jas. M. Jr. (2) along the Liberty-Chapel Hill Road, which runs through the project area.
Both sites are located along what appears to have constituted this road historically, suggesting he
lived near the associated tracts prior to his acquisition of them.

Grant sold the 50-acres (two 25-acre) tracts containing site 41RK642 to his son Clifford O. (Olen)
Grant in 1946 (Rusk County Deed Records 408:245). Two structures located on opposite sides of a
roadway appear at the location of site 41RK642 on a 1935 aerial photograph, and a 1976
mechanicâs lien confirms that at least one of them was a dwelling. In the document, Clifford Grant
and his second wife Barbara Ruth entered into a contract to undertake â[a] complete remodeling,
including central heat, air and carpeting, to the house located on the . . . premises.â Grant retained
100013883/100196

109

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
the property until 1989 when he partitioned the 50 acres into two 25-acre tracts, which he
conveyed to his daughters in 1989 (Rusk County Deed Records 1672:121, 125).

J.M. Grant and his wife Sudie conveyed the 55.53-acre parcel containing site 41RK643 to their
daughter Lillie Sue Grant Williams in 1960. The parcel was described as 55 acres out of a 316.4-acre
tract (Rusk County Deed Records 708:546), and the land remained in the Grant/Williams family
through at least 1983 (Rusk County Deed Records 2473:454).

Results Summary and Analysis: The tracts containing sites 41RK642 and 41RK643 were
associated with numerous individuals during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, though
archival evidence suggests that occupants during most of its known history would likely have been
tenants. Between the 1849 patent date and 1893, the property could have been used or occupied by
unknown owners, their tenants, and/or squatters. Evidence suggests that T.J. and M.A. Trammell
and/or associated tenants might have occupied the tract some time before 1893, and tenants in the
employ of B.S. Wathen could have lived there between 1893 and 1905. Between 1905 and 1922, the
tracts were associated with C.A. Price (1905âbefore 1916 and 1905â1919), Oscar Benton (before
1916), F.W. Beall (1916â1922), C.A. Norris (1919), and M.E. Watson (1919â1921). Oscar Benton
may have resided on a 1-acre portion of the original 316-acre tract, and though possible, it is
unlikely he was directly associated with sites 41RK642 and 41RK643. Archival evidence suggests
that any occupants of the property during its association with the remaining owners during this
period would have been tenants.

By 1922, H.J. Peek, a resident of Henderson, owned all of the subject tracts. It appears that tenants,
including D.B. Wyatt, occupied the property during his association with it between circa 1922 and
1935. The property was also likely occupied by tenants and/or used for agriculture during its
association with the Price family (1935â1937) and J.M. Grant (1937âremainder of twentieth
century). Either Price or Grant likely constructed the circa 1935 farmstead associated with
41RK643. Although none of the known owners maintain any known historic associations, the
artifacts recovered from 41RK642 indicate the site may date to the nineteenth century and could
provide additional information about occupants living at the site during that time. As mentioned
above, the nineteenth-century history for this tract is incomplete, and further archival research
would be necessary to determine its associations with specific occupants. For these reasons, site
41RK642 has an unknown NRHP eligibility, while site 41RK643 is not recommended eligible for
NRHP inclusion under Criterion A or B.
The structural component of site 41RK643 includes three resources: a circa 1935 dwelling (A), a
circa 1935 barn (B), and a circa 1935 open-air shelter (C) for a presently abandoned well. The
dwelling (Resource A) has a gabled roof with a shed-roof bay on one of the side-gabled faÃ§ades. This
dwelling is in poor condition, and none of its original architectural features (windows, doors,
interior walls, porches, etc.) are extant. The structure is also missing portions of its external
wooden siding. Resource B includes a partially collapsed barn with a front-gabled roof and a
100013883/100196

110

5. Results of the Archival Research
collapsed lateral shed-roof crib on one side-gabled faÃ§ade. The barnâs doors are no longer extant,
and portions of the vertical wooden cladding are missing. The final resource (Resource C) is an
abandoned well covered by an open-air shelter. The shelter consists of four unmilled wooden posts
and a gabled metal roof. Resources A and B lack integrity of materials, design, workmanship, and
feeling due to their derelict condition and missing architectural components. Resource C lacks
architectural significance. None of these buildings, which may represent the remnants of a tenant
farm complex, have any known historic associations, and they are not recommended for inclusion
in the NRHP under Criterion A, B, or C.

Sites 41RK617 and 41RK649

The Luminant files concerning the 42.03-acre tract containing site 41RK617 and the 33-acre tract
containing site 41RK649 have a gap in the chain of title data from the patent of the Cortinas Survey
in 1849 until 1856 when the 298-acre parcel from which they were created appears in a partition
deed related to the estate of G.W. Trammell. Through the conveyance, G.W. Trammellâs son J.Y.
Trammell received the subject 298 acres, as well as tracts in unrelated surveys (Rusk County Deed
Records 4:281). As detailed in the accompanying inventory, George Trammell owned a substantial
amount of property throughout Rusk County and the state.

Archival evidence indicates that the Trammells were early residents of the project vicinity, and
Trammellâs Trace, one of the earliest Anglo migration routes into Texas, ran through the county in
the vicinity of the project area. It is unclear how or if the Rusk County Trammells were related to
Nicholas Trammell, who is credited with being the first Anglo to use the historic Native American
trail (Pirtle 2010). George Trammell and his wife America first appear in the 1850 Rusk County
census. In that year, Trammell (42) is listed as a farmer with $4,500 in real estate. The household
included his wife America (22) and a 9-year-old girl named Josephine Totty. It is unclear how Totty
was related to the Trammells.

By 1860, Trammellâs household included himself (57) and wife America (indexed as 38). Trammell
owned $10,000 in real estate, and his personal estate was valued at $70,000. The high value of his
personal estate suggests he owned slaves. He lived one household away from the Mark Stroud
family, and the two menâs farms are depicted in close proximity to each other on an 1863 map (see
Figure 17) of the project vicinity (see the history of site 41RK610 for more information about the
Stroud family). In addition to the census evidence, the nearby Chapel Hill Cemetery, an African
American cemetery near the historic location of the Trammellsâ plantation, is also known as the
Trammell Cemetery (see Chapter 3 for more information about the Chapel Hill/Trammell
Cemetery).
Despite the parcelâs association with the Trammell family, a quitclaim and relinquishment from
1866 suggests that the principal improvements associated with the Trammellsâ plantation were not
located on the subject 298-acre tract. In the record, A.A. Trammell, Georgeâs widow, detailed what
100013883/100196

111

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
she reserved as her personal property out of the estate and relinquished the rest to his next of kin
and heirs. The document contains an inventory of the coupleâs personal property, including their
dwelling, outbuildings, cultivated fields, furniture, and livestock, most of which A.A. Trammell
reserved for herself. She also retained a 100-acre tract containing their plantation for a period of
2 years. The record describes the 100 acres as adjoining the plantation of Mark Stroud (Rusk
County Deed Records P:532). Though additional archival research could provide information about
the Trammells, their relation to the project area, and early settlement in Rusk County, archeological
evidence does not suggest that any of the subject sites were created during this early period.
Additionally, the fact that the subject tract was not part of the acreage reserved by America
Trammell suggests that it may have been used as agricultural land during the period.
J.Y. Trammell retained the 298 acres containing the subject parcels until 1877 when he conveyed
the property to Peter Humphries [sic], John Humphries [sic], Osborn Bar [sic], and Wesley Menefee,
all of Rusk County, for $1,400 with a vendorâs lien payable in cotton. The record indicates that
Trammell was a resident of Lee County, Alabama, at the time of the conveyance (Rusk County Deed
Records Z:20). In 1882, Peter Humphries [sic] relinquished his interest in the property to Os [sic]
Bar and Wesley Menefee (Rusk County Deed Records 35:486).

Census research reveals that all of the grantees in the 1877 transaction were either African
American or âmulattoâ and may have resided on or in the vicinity of the subject property
immediately adjacent to one another. Historians were unable to find entries for any of the men in
the 1870 Rusk County census records, but in 1880, Peter Humphrey (65) and his wife Mary (47)
lived one household from Jas. Humphrey (23). Abe Humphrey (22) was a boarder in Jas.
Humphreyâs household, and the record describes the men as mulatto. All of them worked as
farmers. Aus Bargh [sic] (30) lived one household from Peter Humphries [sic] with his wife Sealy
(25) and their four children, and Wesley (21) and Mary (18) Menefee were enumerated in the next
household. The Barrs are described as mulatto, while the Menefee family is recorded as black. Both
men were farmers. John Humphrey (28) lived in the same enumeration district with his wife Hettie
(25) and their children. The family is characterized as African American, and John worked as a farm
laborer.

As was common in east Texas and the South in general during the period, it is likely that the men
pooled their money to acquire the property in order to provide local African American residents
with their own property to live on and cultivate separate from their former owners. It is possible
that the families occupied the parcel as tenants prior to purchasing it and/or that they were
formerly enslaved by the Trammell family. George Trammell allowed his slaves to cultivate their
own crops and sold them on their behalf, suggesting his slaves had some access to money even
prior to Emancipation. This process of African Americans consolidating themselves into ethnic
enclaves that in time developed into self-sustaining communities with their own churches and
schools was a common pattern in the state, and it is possible that these men represent founding
members of the African American settlement of Liberty (or Chapel Hill) historically located in the
100013883/100196

5. Results of the Archival Research
project vicinity. The Menefee, Humphrey, and Barr families are all interred in the nearby Chapel Hill
Cemetery (Green n.d.), Aus and Celia Barr donated the land containing the associated Chapel Hill
Church (Rusk County Deed Records 110:113), and both African American churches in the area, the
Springfield C.M.E. Church and the Chapel Hill Baptist Church, list descendants of early African
American families as former board members.

Site 41RK617

The men eventually partitioned the parcel, and in 1887, John and Hettie Humphries [sic], Wesley
and Mary Ann Menefee, and Cely [sic] and Aus Bar [sic] conveyed 58 acres out of their 298-acre
tract to Abe Humphries [sic] (Rusk County Deed Records 44:386). In 1896, Humphries [sic] deeded
the property to Mrs. A.A. Wascom [sic] for cancellation of a promissory note for $77.50 (Rusk
County Deed Records 44:388). As discussed in the introduction to this section, Abe Humphries [sic]
appears as a boarder in the household of Jas. Humphrey in the 1880 census and lived in close
proximity to both the Barr and Menefee families. There are no census data available for 1890, and
historians did not find an entry for Humphrey in the 1900 Rusk County census.

Mrs. A.A. Waskom retained the property until 1900 before conveying it back to Wesley Menefee for
$200 (Rusk County Deed Records 56:406). An America Waskom (75) appears in the 1900 Rusk
County census as a resident of Henderson. She owned her property and headed a household
including her niece and four boarders. Her residence in Henderson on property she owned suggests
she purchased the property as an investment and/or accepted it as payment for a debt incurred by
Abe Humphries [sic]. The fact that she conveyed it back to one of its original owners suggests that
members of the group and/or their families may have continued to occupy an area including the
subject parcel during the period she was associated with it. Wesley Menefee retained the parcel
until his death in 1923 (Rusk County Death Certificate #2867), and census evidence suggests that
he and many of the other individuals associated with the parcel over time continued to live in the
general vicinity of the tract. This evidence also revealed that the Humphreys and Barrs were related
through marriage.
In 1900, Wesley Menefee (58) owned his farm in Justice Precinct 3, which historically contained the
current project area. His household included wife Mary (45) and children Jim (17), Jessie (15), John
(13), Son (11), Edie (9), Oba (7), Carrie (5), Maud (3), and Thos. (1). They lived near other African
American property owners including Mary Humphrey, wife of the deceased Peter Humphrey, Henry
Manual, and Joe Wright. In 1910, the household included Wesley H. Menifee [sic] (64), his wife Mary
A. (50), and children Jim (27), Jesse (26), John (22), Sue D. (19), Hober (16), and Edie (15). The
group lived one household away from John Humphries [sic], who also owned his property. Other
African American property owners in the vicinity included members of the Barr family and Mary
Humphries [sic]. It is unclear why there are so many discrepancies in the ages of the Menefee family
members in the respective census records.

100013883/100196

113

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
By 1920, the household is recorded in the Church Hill voting precinct along Prospect Road near
other suspected project area residents the Jim Young family (see history of site 41RK639). Church
Hill was a small farming community located near but outside of the project area to its southwest. In
that year, Wesley Menefee (71) and wife Mary (69) lived with their children John (24) and Eddie
(21) one household from Oss [sic] and Seley [sic] Barr, who owned their farm. Mary Humphries [sic]
(101) lived in their household and is described as Aus Barrâs mother-in-law. Two other members of
the Barr family owned farms in the area, as did John Humphries [sic].

Though the Luminant tract file for the subject tract did not contain any probate information for
Wesley Menefee, it appears that his children inherited his property. Altogether, Wesley and Mary
Menefee owned approximately 272 acres in the adjacent Cortinas, T.J. Walling, and Thomas
Williams surveys (see history of sites 41RK649, 41RK610, and 41RK637). In 1924, his son John
Menefee took out a deed of trust for $639.88 on his share of the 58-acre tract, as well as on four
other parcels originally owned by his parents (Rusk County Deed of Trust Records P:99). Menefee
took out another deed of trust in 1930 and an extension on the 1924 deed of trust in 1931 (Rusk
County Deed of Trust Records P:227, R:42). All of the records indicate that he resided in Panola
County during this period.
It appears that John Menefee was unable to repay the loans. In 1935, the foreclosed property,
including five parcels, was sold at sheriffâs auction to B.L. Parker for $100. The conveyance does not
mention that the transaction only included a partial interest in the five tracts (Rusk County Deed
Records 266:22); however, a subsequent lawsuit confirmed that other Menefee heirs still retained
an interest in the property. In 1946, a judgment in the case of Jessie Menefee et al. vs. B.L. Parker et
al. determined that Parker was not entitled to the entire property but rather to a shared interest
with the remaining heirs including C.J. Cooper, Jessie Menefee, and Louberta Menefee. The other
Menefee children, including Jim Menefee, Son Menefee, Edith Menefee Cooper, and Hobert Menefee,
were deceased at the time of the lawsuit. Parker was granted the subject 58 acres and an adjacent
27-acre tract containing site 41RK610 as his share of the property (Rusk County District Court
Cause #17228) (see Figure 18).

Subsequent records reveal that Parker did not reside on the 58-acre tract containing site 41RK617.
Bishop Linus Parker resided in Panola County, Texas, and retained the subject property until his
death in 1960. At that time it reverted to his wife Almeda Parilee Parker as part of their community
estate (Panola County Probate Records Cause #3807). Any occupants of the tract during its
association with the Parkers would have been tenants or renters.

Results Summary and Analysis: Archival and archeological evidence indicates that site 41RK617
was likely associated with or created by African American property owners and/or tenants during
the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The tract on which the site is located was within a
distinct African American community historically located within the project vicinity. Though not an
incorporated community according to traditional interpretations, the African American residents in

100013883/100196

114

5. Results of the Archival Research
the area, including members of the Humphrey, Barr, and Menefee families, maintained their own
church, school, and cemetery and owned the property on which they lived and farmed. The
property was historically part of the Trammell plantation, and it is possible that the family could
have conveyed it to their former slaves during the Reconstruction period.

From 1877 through 1887, the property was jointly owned by members of the Humphrey, Barr, and
Menefee families. It could have been used or occupied by any of the families during this period. Abe
Humphries [sic] may have lived there during his association with it between 1887 and 1896, and
residents during its association with the subsequent owner A.A. Waskom (1896â1900) would have
been tenants. It is possible that Abe Humphries [sic] continued to live there during the period. The
property was subsequently associated with the Wesley Menefee family from 1900 through the
remainder of the twentieth century, and though it may not have contained his homestead, it likely
constituted some portion of the family farm. Additionally, it could have been occupied by a family
member or tenant during the period and/or used for agriculture.

Despite the siteâs association with African American property owners, an underrepresented group
of people in the archeological record, the paucity of artifacts recovered from the site will not
provide additional information to the historical record. Additional archival research may provide
more contextual information about African American farmers/property owners in the area, but
would not likely provide specific information about the history of site 41RK617 or the associated
property owners. As a result, additional research is not recommended in connection with the
current project. None of the associated families maintains any known associations that would
qualify the site for NRHP listing under Criterion B, and the site does not maintain broader
associations with local developmental patterns that would qualify it for listing under Criterion A.

Site 41RK649

Like the parcel containing site 41RK617, the 33-acre parcel containing site 41RK649 was also
partitioned from the 298-acre tract jointly owned by the Humphreys, Menefees, and Barrs. In 1887,
the same year Abe Humphries [sic] received the 58-acre tract containing site 41RK617, John and
Hettie Humphries [sic] and Wesley and Mary Ann Menefee conveyed their interest in a 180-acre
portion of the parcel to Aus Bar [sic]. In return, he deeded them his interest in another parcel of
undisclosed acreage in the Cortinas Survey (Rusk County Deed Records 35:484). Mary Humphries
[sic], wife of Peter Humphries [sic] (deceased), deeded her interest in the property to Barr on the
same day (Rusk County Deed Records 35:482). Barr retained the property until his death, and it
likely constituted some portion of his familyâs home and farm. The parcel containing site 41RK649
was created from two 25-acre parcels deeded to Barrâs heirs after his death.

As referenced in the introduction to this section, Aus Bargh [sic] (30) appears in the 1880 Rusk
County census living immediately adjacent to the other individuals who maintained interest in the
298-acre tract, including Peter and Mary Humphries [sic] and Wesley and Mary Ann Menefee. His
100013883/100196

115

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
household included wife Sealy (25) and their children Mary (7), Jas. (5), Lewis (3), and Emma (1).
The record does not indicate whether Barr owned his property. By 1900, Os [sic] Barr (50) appears
indexed with wife Seley [sic] (47). The couple lived with their nine children Lewis (22), Elizabeth
(18), Walter (16), Minnie (13), Mart (11), Ella (8), Willie (6), Douglas (5), and Maud (1) in Justice
Precinct 3, which historically contained the current project area. He is described as a propertyowning farmer, as is his son Lewis. His son Jim is described as a renter, though all of the men appear
in the same household.

In 1910, the family was enumerated living along the Henderson and Church Hill Road. Aus Barr
(60) owned his farm and lived in an area characterized by a mix of black and white residents. In
that year the household included Sealy (56), Mart (21), Willie (16), Douglas (14), and Bessie (12).
By 1920, the household is recorded in the Church Hill voting precinct along Prospect Road near
other suspected project area residents the Jim Young family (see history of site 41RK639). Church
Hill was a small farming community located near but outside of the project area to its southwest. In
that year, Oss [sic] (70) and Sealey [sic] (67) Barr owned their farm and lived one household from
Wesley and Mary Menefee with their children Bessie (25) and William R. (23) and Sealyâs mother
Mary Humphries [sic] (101). Three other members of the Barr family, including Martin, Walter, and
James D., owned farms in the area, as did John Humphries [sic]. It does not appear that the family
had relocated, but in 1920, they lived in a predominantly African American area. Nearby Dirgin
Road (enumerated on the preceding census page) was predominantly white.
Records pertaining to the Barr estate indicate that Aus and Celia had conveyed separate 24-acre
tracts from their holdings to their sons Mart and Walter in 1919 (Rusk County District Court
Records Cause #19143). One of the tracts was out of the 180 acres in the subject Cortinas Survey,
while the other was out of a parcel in the adjacent Thomas Williams Survey. It appears that the
larger Barr homestead/farm was located on the subject 180-acre tract and the adjacent 93-acre
tract in the Williams Survey, and census evidence indicates the extended Barr family likely lived
together on the property during the period (Rusk County District Court Records Cause #19143).

According to probate documents, Aus Barr died in January of 1930 (Rusk County District Court
Records Cause #19143). In that year, his wife Sealie [sic] (75) appears as head of a household in the
Rusk County census including her daughter Bessie (indexed as 30). She is listed as a propertyowning farmer and lived near John Humphries [sic], James Menefee, John Menefee, and Mart Barr in
a predominantly African American area. Her continued residence near members of the same
families she and her husband had lived in proximity to since circa 1880 suggests the families were
longtime members of the Liberty community. It is possible that she still lived in or on the subject
tract until her death in 1934.
Upon Celia Barrâs death, her heirs entered into a lawsuit concerning the coupleâs community
property. In the resultant partition of the estate, their daughters Elizabeth Strong and Ella
Greenwood received the two tracts (25 acres each) that eventually formed the subject parcel (Rusk
100013883/100196

116

5. Results of the Archival Research
County Deed Records 264:266, 265:78). The deeds were recorded in 1934. The Barrsâ daughter
Bessie Barr, who lived with her parents through at least 1934, received a separate 26-acre tract
(Rusk County District Court Cause #19143). Her continued residence with her parents during the
period suggests that she might have received the tract containing their homestead; however,
neither the associated deeds nor the partition map included in the district court records contain
any specific information about improvements on the tracts.

John and Elizabeth Strong retained their 25-acre tract until 1947 when the couple conveyed it to
Louis and Lovell Andrews for $100 cash and a $400 promissory note (Rusk County Deed Records
417:103). Ella Greenwood retained the other 25-acre tract until her death in 1940 (Rusk County
Deed Records 992:43). In 1965, the heirs of Ella Greenwood (including Vera Greenwood Cleaver
and husband D.T. Cleaver, Nelson Greenwood, Eolis and Willie Story, Clara C. and Waddell Benson,
and William Greenwood), Louis Lee Andrews and his second wife Hattie Mae, and Lovell Andrews
Slay, a femme sole, conveyed the two 25-acre tracts (resurveyed together as 67 acres) to the
Veterans Land Board of Texas for $6,000 (Rusk County Deed Records 810:552). The Veterans Land
Board conveyed the property to Elbert F. Prior the same year (Robertson County Deed Records
810:557).

Results Summary and Analysis: Archival evidence indicates that the parcel containing site
41RK649 was originally part of the G.W. Trammell plantation in the mid-nineteenth century.
Despite these associations, it does not appear that the tract contained any of the principal
improvements associated with the plantation, and the site does not appear to date from this early
period. From 1877 through 1887, the property was jointly owned by members of the Humphrey,
Barr, and Menefee families, local African American farmers who were members of a distinct African
American community historically located in the project area. The property could have been used or
occupied by any of the families during this period.

After 1887, the property became part of the Aus and Celia Barr homestead and farm. Though it is
unclear whether their homestead was located on the parcel containing site 41RK649, the site is
likely associated with the extended familyâs use and/or occupation of the property during the late
nineteenth century through the mid-twentieth century. During the early twentieth century, the
estate was partitioned, and the families of the Barrsâ daughters Elizabeth Strong and Emma
Greenwood may have used and/or occupied the portion containing the subject sites.

Despite the siteâs association with African American property owners, an underrepresented group
of people in the archeological record, the site does not have the potential to provide additional
information to the historical record. Additional archival research may provide more contextual
information about African American farmers/property owners in the area, but would not likely
provide specific information about the history of site 41RK649 or the associated property owners.
As a result, additional research is not recommended in connection with the current project. The
Barr family does not maintain any known associations that would qualify the site for NRHP listing

100013883/100196

117

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
under Criterion B, and the site does not maintain broader associations with local developmental
patterns that would qualify it for listing under Criterion A.

Site 41RK644

The associated Luminant tract file for the 20-acre tract containing site 41RK644 does not contain
any information about the parcelâs history from the patent of the Cortinas Survey in 1849 through
1910 when P.D. and L.H. Adams conveyed the 20 acres to T.J. Wright for $400 with a vendorâs lien.
The property is described as being a part of the P.D. Adams 100-acre tract, and the metes-andbounds description indicates that the parcel was adjacent to land already owned by Wright (Rusk
County Deed Records 68:2). Historians were unable to find an entry for the Adamses in the 1880,
1900, or 1910 Rusk County census records, though the couple is described as Rusk County
residents in the conveyance. Though it is possible they occupied the subject tract, it is more likely
that they lived on the 80 acres that they retained. Nevertheless, the high value of the 20 acres
suggests that it contained improvements.

Wright sold the subject 20 acres, along with an additional 27.5-acre parcel, to Owen Williamson in
1918. Williamson purchased the parcels for $275 cash in hand and $1,187.50 in promissory notes
(Rusk County Deed Records 304:167). Contemporary census records suggest that the Wright family
lived in the vicinity of the subject property. In 1910, 3 years after acquiring the property, Tom
Wright (33) lived on the Church Hill and Dirgin Road. Site 41RK644 is located immediately adjacent
to this road. His household included his wife Mamie (31) and their children Brock (10), Robie S. (8),
Ora S. (5), and Ruth (2). He was a farmer and owned his property. By 1920, the family had relocated
to Young Street in the town of Tatum. Tatum is located outside of the current project area to its
northeast. It is possible they resided on the tract between 1910 and 1918; however, the family
owned an adjacent parcel prior to acquiring the property (see history of site 41RK635). As a result,
it is possible that they leased it out to tenants and/or used it for agriculture.

After Williamsonâs acquisition of the tract, it continued to change hands rapidly over the next few
years. In 1922, Owen Williamson and his wife conveyed the 20 acres to W.C. Williamson for $150
(Rusk County Deed Records 114:589). The Owen Williamson family does not appear in the 1910
Rusk County census, and by 1920, Williamson is described as living near the town of Stewart on the
âindecipherable to Church Hill Road.â The family rented their property at that time, suggesting they
were not able to satisfy the terms of the original vendorâs lien. Their status as renters in 1920
suggests they may have been tenants on the property prior to acquiring it in 1918.

W.C. Williamson sold the property the same year, along with the 27.5-acre tract, to A.L. St. Clarr [sic]
for $1,000 in the form of five promissory notes for $200 each (Rusk County Deed Records 119:56).
St. Claire retained the tract until 1929 when he conveyed it back to Williamson for $1,000 cash in
hand (Rusk County Deed Records 143:199). Though historians could not find an entry for the St.
Claire family in the 1920 Rusk County census, in 1930, the family rented their property on Adams
100013883/100196

118

5. Results of the Archival Research
Road in Justice Precinct 3. Their status as renters after selling the property suggests that they may
have lived there during their tenure of ownership. Additionally, they could have occupied the
property prior to their acquisition of it. In 1930, the household included Arthur L. St. Claire (60), his
wife Annie M. (32), and children Arthur L., Jr. (19), Elliott (16), Ruby (15), Luther (13), Jennie (11),
Inez (6), Grace (3), and Jerry (3 months).

Williamson retained the subject parcel until 1933 when he conveyed it, along with 11 other tracts
in various surveys, to his children. His son W.J. Williamson, a resident of Rusk County, received the
subject parcel (Rusk County Deed Records 234:179). The metes-and-bounds descriptions of other
parcels in the conveyance reference a 70Â¾-acre tract in the Robert Merritt Survey called the âW.C.
Williamson tract.â These references suggest that this tract contained W.C. Williamsonâs homestead
and that he did not occupy the subject parcel. This assessment is supported by Williamsonâs short
periods of association with the property and by his conveyance and reacquisition of it. Later
conveyances reveal that W.J. Williamson, who inherited the property, resided in Tatum (Rusk
County Deed Records 319:614).
W.J. Williamson owned the parcel until 1941 when he and his wife Gladys conveyed it to the Alford
Bros. Motor Company (Rusk County Deed Records 353:73). Williamsonâs reported residence in
Tatum during his association with the property suggests that occupants during that period would
have been tenants. The Company sold the property the following year to J.H. Fitzgerald for $300
with a vendorâs lien (Rusk County Deed Records 361:226). The property remained in the Fitzgerald
family through the remainder of the twentieth century.

Though it is possible the Fitzgerald family occupied the subject parcel, they owned additional
acreage in the area and appear as property owners in the 1930 Rusk County census records. In that
year, John H. Fitzgerald (42) worked as a farmer and headed a household containing his wife Irma
(38) and children Beatrice (17), Elizabeth (16), John H., Jr. (10), and Harold D. (6). Their association
with other tracts before acquiring the 20-acre parcel suggests that they used it for agricultural
purposes and/or leased it out for cultivation to tenants.

Results Summary and Analysis: Archival evidence suggests that the subject parcel could have
been occupied and/or used by various individuals during the twentieth century. The Luminant tract
file for the property contains a gap in the chain of title data between the patent of the Cortinas
Survey in 1849 and 1910. The parcel could have been occupied by unknown owners and/or
associated tenants during this period. Additionally, P.D. and L.H. Adams were associated with the
property for an unknown period of time prior to 1910 and could have lived on or leased out the
parcel to tenants in their employ.

After 1910, the parcel changed hands rapidly and could have been occupied or used for agriculture
by T.J. Wright (1910â1918), Owen Williamson (1918â1922), W.C. Williamson (1922, 1929â1933),
A.L. St. Claire (1922â1929), or tenants working for any of the men. Archival evidence indicates that
100013883/100196

119

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
Wright and W.C. Williamson owned other property on which they may have resided, and that Owen
Williamson and A.L. St. Claire may have been tenants on the subject property before or after their
association with it. During the mid-twentieth century, the property could have been occupied by
tenants working for W.J. Williamson (1933â1941), a resident of Tatum, or by the J.H. Fitzgerald
family or associated tenants during the remainder of the twentieth century. Neither the site nor any
of the associated property owners maintain any known significance that would qualify it for listing
on the NRHP under Criterion A or B.

Site 41RK635

The Luminant tract file pertaining to the parcel containing site 41RK635 contains a gap in the chain
of title from the patent of the Cortinas Survey in 1849 until 1894 when Marion (some documents
refer to him as Marvin) and Mattie Lee Adams conveyed 118 acres containing the subject tract to
Mattieâs brother Gill S. Jones for $600 with a vendorâs lien (Rusk County Deed Records 49:587).
Though it is unclear when Adams acquired the property, he was only 29 at the time of the 1900
Rusk County census, suggesting that he was not individually associated with the parcel for a lengthy
period of time. In 1900, he lived in the project vicinity in Justice Precinct 3 with his wife Mattie L.
(26) and their three children. Adams owned his farm and lived one household from both the Miller
Adams family and the John Adams family. Earlier census records indicate that the men were his
brother and father, respectively. The group lived near African American farmer Oscar Benton,
whose survey is described as bordering the subject property in the metes-and-bounds description.
John Adams is listed as a property owner, while his son Miller rented his land. Contemporary
census records and subsequent transactions suggest the land may have been part of the Adams
family farm during the late nineteenth century.
In 1880, the family appears in the Rusk County census records living in Justice Precinct 3, which
historically contained the current project area. In that year, the household included John Adams
(32), his wife Martha (26), and their children Marvin (9), Ida (7), Miller (6), and Ira (2), and Frances
Cherry, a 21-year-old farm laborer. Though it is unclear from the record whether Adams owned his
property, his residence in the project vicinity during this period suggests he might have been living
somewhere on the Cortinas Survey. Intensive research, including review of ad valorem tax data,
could clarify if and for how long Adams owned land in the Cortinas Survey and whether the subject
parcel conveyed by his son Marion (Marvin) to Gill Jones in 1894 was originally conveyed to Marion
by his father.
Gill Jones retained the parcel until 1901, when he conveyed it to his brother-in-law Miller Adams
for $550 (Rusk County Deed Records 119:237). Though historians were unable to find an entry for
Jones in the 1900 Rusk County census records, the 1901 conveyance describes him as a resident of
Rusk County. Therefore, it is possible he resided on the subject property despite his absence from
the census records. Jones does appear in the 1910 Rusk County census. In that year, he lived in

100013883/100196

120

5. Results of the Archival Research
Justice Precinct 3 on Tatum Road. He owned his property, and his mother-in-law Martha Adams
lived in his household.

Miller Adams owned the parcel for approximately a year before selling it to A.O. Menefee, a resident
of Rusk County, for $700 with a vendorâs lien (Rusk County Deed Records 54:155). As mentioned
above, Miller Adams rented his property in 1900. He may have moved onto the subject property
briefly before he conveyed it in 1902, although it could have been occupied by tenants during this
period as well. Similarly, Albert O. Menefee and his wife Effie could have occupied the property
between 1902 and 1907. Historians were unable to find an entry for the family in the 1900 Rusk
County census, though Menefee is listed as a resident in the 1902 conveyance. The 1910 Rusk
County census indicates that he was a physician. In that year, he and his family lived on the Tatum
Road in Justice Precinct 3. His occupation on property he owned in 1910 suggests the subject tract
may have been purchased as an investment and/or that it could have been occupied by tenants
during his tenure of ownership.

In 1907, A.O. and Effie Menefee conveyed the subject 118 acres to T.J. Wright for $1,000 (Rusk
County Deed Records 66:36). Wright sold the subject 27 acres out of this 118-acre tract to B.E.
Watson for $675.80 with a vendorâs lien in 1918 (Rusk County Deed Records 113:486). The high
value of the property at that time suggests it contained improvements. Contemporary census
records suggest that the Wright family lived in the vicinity of the 118-acre tract. In 1910, 3 years
after acquiring the property, Tom Wright (33) lived on the Church Hill and Dirgin Road. Site
41RK635 is located immediately adjacent to this road. His household included his wife Mamie (31)
and their children Brock (10), Robie S. (8), Ora S. (5), and Ruth (2). He was a farmer and owned his
property. By 1920, the family had relocated to Young Street in the town of Tatum. Tatum is located
to the northeast outside of the current project area. It is possible they resided on the tract between
1907 and 1918; however, the family also owned other property in the area (see history of site
41RK644). As a result, it is possible that they leased it out to tenants and/or used it for agriculture.

B.E. Watson retained the tract for 5 years. In 1923, he and his wife Beulah sold the property to
Walter Young for $750 with a vendorâs lien (Rusk County Deed Records 122:211). The parcelâs high
value suggests it contained improvements. Watson appears in the 1920 Rusk County census as a
property-owning farmer living in the Tatum voting precinct. Though he may have lived on the
subject tract, his short affiliation with the subject property suggests that it could have been
occupied by tenants during his tenure of ownership.

Walter Young owned the property until 1944, and contemporary census records suggest he may
have occupied the tract. Historians did not find an entry for Young in the 1920 Rusk County census,
but by 1930, Walter (28) and Ruby (27) Young appear in the census records living with their
daughter Mildred (4) on Adams Road in Justice Precinct 3 near other possible project area residents
the St. Claire family (see history of site 41RK644).
100013883/100196

121

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
The Youngs conveyed the property to W.E. Bartley for $225 cash and a vendorâs lien note of $475 in
June of 1944. The record describes the property as being located along the Dirgin to Church Hill
Road (Rusk County Deed Records 376:542). Mrs. W.E. Bartley took control of the property after the
death of her husband (Rusk County Deed Records 416:315) and conveyed it to Jack and Nona
Martin in 1947 (Rusk County Deed Records 416:317). Subsequent records indicate that the Martins
constructed a house on the property. The structure is no longer standing, but likely correlates to the
remnants recorded at site 41RK635. A structure also appears at the location on a 1935 aerial
photograph, suggesting the dwelling might have replaced an earlier structure associated with a
previous occupation.
In 1956, the Martins took out a mechanicâs lien on the property for $4,000 to construct a â2
bedroom frame house with composition roof and bathâ (Rusk County Mechanicâs Lien Records
31:309). The lien was released in 1962 (Rusk County Deed of Trust Records 128:2). The Martins
retained and likely occupied the tract until 1973 (Rusk County Deed Records 974:761).

Results Summary and Analysis: Though the early history of the parcel containing site 41RK635 is
unclear before the late nineteenth century, it may have been part of the Adams family farmstead
prior to 1894. Despite these potential associations, the Adams family continued to reside on
property they owned in the area through the early twentieth century, suggesting it did not contain
their homestead. It remained in the extended Adams family through 1902 and may have been
occupied by Gill Jones (1894â1901), Miller Adams (1901â1902), and/or associated tenants during
the period.

Subsequent twentieth-century owners include T.J. Wright (1907â1918), B.E. Watson (1918â1923),
and Walter Young (1923â1944). Though any of the men could have resided on the parcel, Wright
owned other property in the area, and Watson was only associated with the property for a brief
period. As a result, it could have been occupied by tenants during their tenures of ownership. Young
may have lived on the tract after his acquisition of it, and the subsequent owners Jack and Nona
Martin constructed a house on the property in 1956. Archeological, archival, and map evidence
suggest that there was an earlier occupation, possibly by the Young family. As a result, the 1956
dwelling, which is no longer standing, may have replaced an earlier structure historically located at
the site. None of the individuals associated with the property containing site 41RK635 maintain any
known associations that would qualify the site for NRHP listing under Criterion B, and the site does
not maintain broader associations with local developmental patterns that would qualify it for listing
under Criterion A.

Luminant Tract 1266

Archeologists were not granted permissible access to Luminant Tract 1266, and thus the presence
of any archeological deposits on this parcel could not be confirmed. The Luminant tract file for this
property includes a gap in the early chain of title from 1849 through 1887, when Aus Barr joined by
100013883/100196

122

5. Results of the Archival Research
his wife Seeley [sic] and John Humphries [sic] and wife Mattie sold 82 acres, including the 75.7-acre
subject tract, to Wesley Menefee for $5 and the further consideration that Wesley Menefee release
unto the grantors all his interest in another tract of land in the Cortinas Survey (Rusk County Deed
Records 48:565). This property is one of several that may have been associated with the Wesley
Menefee homestead (see history of sites 41RK610, 41RK617, and 41RK637 for further information
on Wesley Menefee). Wesley Menefee died in 1922 and was buried in the Chapel Hill Cemetery,
located in the vicinity of the subject tract (Find A Grave Inc. 2011)).

Though the Luminant tract file for the subject tract did not contain any probate information for
Wesley Menefee, it appears that his children inherited his property. Wesley and Mary Menefee
owned 272 acres in the Cortinas, T.J. Walling, and Thomas Williams surveys. In 1924, their son John
Menefee took out a deed of trust for $639.88 on his share of the subject 82-acre tract as well as four
other parcels originally owned by his parents (Rusk County Deed of Trust Records P:99). Menefee
took out another deed of trust in 1930 and an extension on the 1924 deed of trust in 1931 (Rusk
County Deed of Trust Records P:227, R:42). All of the records indicate that he resided in Panola
County during this period.
It appears that he was unable to repay the loans. In 1935, the foreclosed property, including five
parcels, was sold at sheriffâs auction to B.L. Parker for $100. The conveyance does not mention that
the transaction only included a partial interest in the five tracts (Rusk County Deed Records
266:22); however, a subsequent lawsuit confirmed that other Menefee heirs still retained an
interest in the property. In 1946, a judgment in the case of Jessie Menefee et al. vs. B.L. Parker et al.
determined that Parker was not entitled to the entire property but rather a shared interest with the
remaining heirs including C.J. Cooper, Jessie Menefee, and Louberta Menefee. The other Menefee
children, including Jim Menefee, Son Menefee, Edith Menefee Cooper, and Hobert Menefee, were
deceased at the time of the lawsuit.

The 82-acre subject tract was awarded to Jessie and Louberta Menefee, along with other lands of
the Menefee estate (Rusk County Deed Records 411:479). In 1947, Louberta Menefee sued Jessie
Menefee for violating their agreed partition of their share of the Wesley Menefee estate. The district
court records indicate that Jessie Menefee retained the subject 82 acres and that the subject 82
acres did not include the âOld Wesley Menefee homeâ (Rusk County Deed Records 412:408). Jessie
Menefee retained the subject property until 1951 when he sold it to his son Theophilus Menefee for
$2,400 (Rusk County Deed Records 467:266). Theophilus Menefee retained the property through
the end of the historic period until his death in 2010 (Rusk County Deed Records 3016:645).
Historians did not find any entries for Jessie Menafee [sic] in the Rusk County census outside of
those that list him living in his fatherâs household. However, it is unlikely that he resided on the
subject tract. The deed records for the property do not depict a dwelling on the property in 1945,
and no dwellings are evident on historic aerial photographs of the property.

Results Summary and Analysis: The archival record for Luminant Tract 1266 is very limited for
the propertyâs early history. However; it appears to have been associated with the Wesley Menefee
family and his heirs since the late 1800s. It is unknown if Wesley Menefee or any of his family ever
occupied the property, but it appears that the main Menefee residence was not located on this
property. It is likely that this tract was used for agricultural purposes or potentially occupied by
tenants or squatters associated with the Menefees. This property does not appear to retain any
historic associations that would qualify it for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion A, B, or C.

EARLY HISTORY OF THE THOMAS WILLIAMS SURVEY, RUSK COUNTY
ABSTRACT 833 (LUMINANT TRACTS 591A, 591B, 596, 1333, 1343, AND
1344)

The 23-acre tract containing site 41RK637, the 65-acre tract containing site 41RK636, the 37-4/6acre tract containing site 41RK609, the 37.10-acre tract containing site 41RK624, the 13.07-acre
tract containing site 41RK662 and the 1-acre tracts 591A and 591B (which were not surveyed) are
all located within the original 320-acre Thomas Williams Nacogdoches 3rd-class headright in Rusk
County, Texas (see Figure 16). Third-class headrights were issued to individuals who arrived in
Texas between October 1, 1837, and January 1, 1840. Heads of families were entitled to 640 acres,
while single men received 320 acres (GLO n.d.). Jesse Duren patented the survey in June of 1850
(Texas GLO Records, Rusk County Abstract 833). Secondary sources indicate that Thomas Williams
arrived in Texas circa 1819 and received a Mexican land grant in what became Rusk County in 1829
(Pruett 2010). This land grant (Texas GLO Records, Rusk County Abstract 44) is separate from
though adjacent to the Thomas Williams Survey containing the subject sites.

Williams and his family settled on his Mexican land grant, and the area became known as the
Williams Settlement (Pruett 2010). Secondary sources suggest this community was located near the
current location of Mount Enterprise to the southeast of the project area (Winfrey 1961). He died in
1835 (Pruett 2010), and it is unclear whether he is the same Thomas Williams who received the
subject 3rd-class headright patented by Duren long after his death. According to a title run sheet
provided by Luminant, Jesse Duren, assignee of Thomas Williams, conveyed the entire survey to
Wm. H. Cundiff in 1852 (Rusk County Deed Records G:608). Cundiff transferred the property to
Rusk County resident George W. Trammell on the same day (Rusk County Deed Records G:610).
Jesse Duren does not appear in any Rusk County census records, suggesting he did not occupy the
parcel during the brief period he was associated with it. Secondary sources suggest that he was a
land speculator who maintained interest in property throughout the Nacogdoches district (Long
2010). Nevertheless, an 1863 map of the project vicinity depicts a farmstead in the area associated
with an individual named Duran (see Figure 17). It is possible that this location could represent the
homestead of Jesse Duren. Despite his possible association with the project vicinity, Durenâs
occupation or use of the property would have been brief. Similarly, W.H. Cundiff does not appear to
have occupied the survey. Cundiff appears in the 1860 Houston County census as a farmer with
100013883/100196

124

5. Results of the Archival Research
$205,289 in real estate holdings. His brief association with the survey and obvious interest in real
estate speculation suggests he purchased it as an investment.

The survey next appears in the deed records in the 1856 partition of the G.W. Trammell estate
when William M. Trammell inherited the 320-acre Williams Survey (Rusk County Deed Records
4:281). Archival evidence indicates that the Trammells, who purchased the property in 1852, were
early residents of the project vicinity and already lived on an established plantation when they
acquired the Williams Survey (see the history of site 41RK617 for more information about the
Trammell plantation). Upon his death, Trammellâs wife America reserved the portion of the coupleâs
estate containing their homestead for herself (Rusk County Deed Records P:532), suggesting that
the Williams Survey did not contain any of the improvements associated with their plantation. In
addition, historians could not find an entry for William Trammell in either the 1860 or 1870 Texas
census records, suggesting that if he ever occupied the survey, it was for a limited period of time.

Site 41RK637

The Luminant tract file for the tract containing site 41RK637 does not provide any information
regarding the tractâs history between the 1856 partition of the Trammell estate and 1892. Despite
this gap, archival evidence suggests the site may have been associated with some aspect of the
Wesley Menefee homestead and farm during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
Menefee was also associated with the property containing sites 41RK610 and 41RK617 and was
one of several African American property owners who resided in the project vicinity. Members of
the group, including members of the Humphrey and Barr families, pooled their money to purchase
property in the area during the 1870s and may represent founding residents of Liberty (or Chapel
Hill), a Freedmenâs community historically located in the project area (see the history of sites
41RK610 and 41RK617 for more information).

In 1892, J.C. Hickey and John M. Mays, both residents of Rusk County, conveyed 27 acres containing
the subject 23-acre tract to Wesley Menefee for $81. Census records indicate that Hickey and Mays
likely purchased the property as an investment and never resided there. In 1880, Hickey resided in
the county seat of Henderson where he worked as a cotton buyer. John M. Mays lived in the
community of Harmony Hill in 1880 and is indexed as a merchant. Though historians found no
entry for Hickey in the 1900 Rusk County census records, by that year Mays had relocated to
Henderson and worked as a dry goods merchant. It is unknown how long the men were associated
with the subject property, but their continued association with communities outside of the current
project area suggests that occupants of the property during their tenure of ownership would have
been renters and/or tenants.
As discussed in the history of sites 41RK610 and 41RK617, Wesley Menefee owned approximately
272 acres in the project vicinity, including this tract, which he retained until his death in 1923
(Rusk County Death Certificate #2867). Census research, subsequent conveyances, and the

100013883/100196

125

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
inventory of the nearby Chapel Hill Cemetery where Wesley Menefee and his family are interred
(Green n.d.) indicate that the Menefee family resided in the vicinity of the subject tract throughout
his association with it, and that site 41RK637 is likely associated with his familyâs use and/or
occupation of the property. County records also indicate that the âold Wesley Menefee house,â was
located on this 23-acre parcel as late as 1947, suggesting further that this site is associated with the
Wesley Menefee homestead.

In 1900, Wesley Menefee (58) owned his farm in Justice Precinct 3, which historically contained the
current project area. His household included wife Mary (45) and children Jim (17), Jessie (15), John
(13), Son (11), Edie (9), Oba (7), Carrie (5), Maud (3), and Thos. (1). They lived near other African
American property owners including Mary Humphrey, wife of the deceased Peter Humphrey, Henry
Manual, and Joe Wright. In 1910, the household included Wesley H. Menifee [sic] (64), Mary A. (50),
Jim (27), Jesse (26), John (22), Sue D. (19), Hober [sic] (16), and Edie (15). The group lived one
household away from John Humphries [sic], who also owned his property. Other African American
property owners in the vicinity included members of the Barr family and Mary Humphries [sic]. It is
unclear why there are so many discrepancies in the ages of the Menefee family members in the
respective census entries.

By 1920, the household is recorded in the Church Hill voting precinct along Prospect Road near
other probable project area residents the Jim Young family (see history of site 41RK639). Church
Hill was a small farming community located near but outside of the project area to its southwest. In
that year, Wesley Menefee (71) and wife Mary (69) lived with their children John (24) and Eddie
(21) one household from Oss [sic] and Seley [sic] Barr, who owned their farm. Mary Humphries [sic]
(101) lived in the Barr household and is described as Os Barrâs mother-in-law. Two other members
of the Barr family owned farms in the area, as did John Humphries [sic].

Though the Luminant tract file for the subject tract did not contain any probate information for
Wesley Menefee, it appears that his children inherited his property. Altogether, Wesley and Mary
Menefee owned 272 acres in the adjacent Cortinas, T.J. Walling, and Thomas Williams surveys. In
1924, their son John Menefee took out a deed of trust for $639.88 on his share of the 27-acre tract
as well as four other parcels originally owned by his parents (Rusk County Deed of Trust Records
P:99). Menefee took out another deed of trust in 1930 and an extension on the 1924 deed of trust in
1931 (Rusk County Deed of Trust Records P:227, R:42). All of the records indicate that he resided in
Panola County during this period.

It appears that he was unable to repay the loans. In 1935, the foreclosed property, including five
parcels, was sold at Sheriffâs Auction to B.L. Parker for $100. The conveyance does not mention that
the transaction only included a partial interest in the five tracts (Rusk County Deed Records
266:22); however, a subsequent lawsuit confirmed that other Menefee heirs still retained an
interest in the property. In 1946, a judgment in the case of Jessie Menefee et al. vs. B.L. Parker et al.
determined that Parker was not entitled to the entire property but rather a shared interest with the

100013883/100196

5. Results of the Archival Research
remaining heirs including C.J. Cooper, Jessie Menefee, and Louberta Menefee. The other Menefee
children, including Jim Menefee, Son Menefee, Edith Menefee Cooper, and Hobert Menefee were
deceased at the time of the lawsuit.

The 27-acre tract containing site 41RK637 was granted to Jessie Menefee and Louberta Menefee as
part of a 170-acre block containing the remainder of the estate. A plat accompanying the partition
depicts a dwelling on the parcel located along the roadway that formed its northern boundary (see
Figure 17). The dwelling, which is still extant, is also depicted on a 1935 aerial and the 1958
topographic quadrangle. Jessie and Louberta subsequently partitioned their joint holdings between
themselves, and Louberta Menefee received the subject 23 acres containing site 41RK637. The
agreement was recorded in a district court judgment in 1947 (Rusk County District Court Cause
#18086). The property remained in the Menefee family for the remainder of the twentieth century.
A 1947 judgment in the case of Louberta Menefee vs. Jessie Menefee states that the âOld Wesley
Menefee houseâ was located on this 23-acre tract and valued at $600.

Results Summary and Analysis: Archival evidence indicates that site 41RK637 was associated
with or created by members of the Wesley Menefee family during the late nineteenth and/or early
twentieth centuries. Nevertheless, Wesley Menefee did not purchase the larger tract containing the
site until 1892, approximately 15 years after he purchased other portions of his estate (see history
of sites 41RK617 and 41RK610). His known occupation in the project vicinity by 1880 suggests that
the subject tract did not contain his earliest homestead. Instead, the circa 1930 dwelling associated
with the site may have been occupied by another member of the family and/or represent a later
occupation by Menefee.
The tract on which the site is located was within a distinct African American community historically
located within the project vicinity. Though not an incorporated community according to traditional
interpretations, the African American residents in the area, including members of the Humphrey,
Barr, and Menefee families, maintained their own church, school, and cemetery and owned the
property on which they lived and farmed. Despite the siteâs association with African American
property owners, an underrepresented group in the archeological record, it postdates the period of
significance for early African American settlement in the area. Archival research may provide more
contextual information about African American farmers/property owners in the area, but would
not likely clarify the history of the subject site during the period it was associated with the Menefee
family. As a result, additional research is not recommended in connection with the current project.
None of the individuals associated with the property containing site 41RK637 maintain any known
associations that would qualify the site for NRHP listing under Criterion B, and it does not maintain
broader associations with local developmental patterns that would qualify it for listing under
Criterion A.
The site also includes a circa 1930 single-family dwelling. This resource is a wood-framed, frontgabled bungalow with a full-width, projecting, front-gabled entry porch. The roof is clad in

100013883/100196

composite shingles and has exposed rafter tails. The primary entry is centrally located within the
porch, and the door is no longer extant. The porch has a wooden floor and the original porch
supports have been replaced with wooden posts. The windows are covered and many are no longer
extant. Those remaining windows are replacement metal-sash units. The exterior is clad in wooden
drop siding. The replacement porch supports and windows detract from this resourceâs integrity of
materials, design, workmanship, and feeling. Also, the dwelling is of common design and lacks
architectural distinction. Though the house appears to maintain associations with the Menefee
family, early African American residents of the former community of Liberty or Chapel Hill, it does
not date from their original occupation in the area nor does it appear to maintain associations with
African American settlement or history in the region. Thus, this resource is not recommended for
inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion A, B, or C.

Sites 41RK609 and 41RK622

The Luminant tract file for the parcels containing sites 41RK609 and 41RK662 contain a gap in the
chain of title data from the partition of the Trammell estate in 1856 through 1892 when J.C. Hickey
and Jno. M. Mays conveyed a 93-acre parcel in the Williams Survey to Os Baugh [sic] for $2,500
(Rusk County Deed Records 41:338). Archival and archeological evidence suggest site 41RK609
was associated with some aspect of the Barr familyâs use and/or occupation of the property.

Census records indicate that Hickey and Mays likely purchased the property as an investment and
never resided there. In 1880, Hickey resided in the county seat of Henderson where he worked as a
cotton buyer. John M. Mays lived in the community of Harmony Hill in 1880 and is indexed as a
merchant. Though historians found no entry for Hickey in the 1900 Rusk County census records, by
that year Mays had relocated to Henderson and worked as a dry goods merchant. It is unknown
how long the men were associated with the subject property, but their continued association with
communities outside of the current project area suggests that occupants of the property during
their tenure of ownership would have been renters and/or tenants.

As referenced in the history of site 41RK649, Aus Bargh [sic] (30) appears in the 1880 Rusk County
census living immediately adjacent to other individuals who maintained a shared interest in an
adjacent 298-acre tract in the Cortinas Survey. The men purchased this property in 1877,
suggesting their homes, including Barrâs, may have been located on that tract. These individuals
involved in the joint purchase of the Cortinas tract included Peter and Mary Humphries [sic] and
Wesley and Mary Ann Menefee. Barghâs [sic] household included his wife Sealy (25) and their
children Mary (7), Jas. (5), Lewis (3), and Emma (1). The record does not indicate whether Barr
owned his property. By 1900, Os [sic] Barr (50) appears indexed with wife Seley [sic] (47). The
couple lived with their nine children Lewis (22), Elizabeth (18), Walter (16), Minnie (13), Mart (11),
Ella (8), Willie (6), Douglas (5), and Maud (1) in Justice Precinct 3, which historically contained the
current project area. The record describes Barr and his son Lewis as property-owning farmers and
his son Jim as a renter, though all of the men appear in the same household.

5. Results of the Archival Research
In 1910, the family was enumerated living along the Henderson and Church Hill Road. Aus Barr
(60) owned his farm and lived in an area characterized by a mix of black and white residents. In
that year the household included Sealy (56), Mart (21), Willie (16), Douglas (14), and Bessie (12).
By 1920, the household is recorded in the Church Hill voting precinct along Prospect Road near
other probable project area residents the Jim Young family (see history of site 41RK639). Church
Hill was a small farming community located near but outside of the project area to its southwest. In
that year, Oss [sic] (70) and Sealey [sic] (67) Barr owned their farm and lived one household from
Wesley and Mary Menefee with their children Bessie (25) and William R. (23) and Sealyâs mother
Mary Humphries [sic] (101). Three other members of the Barr family, including Martin, Walter, and
James D., owned farms in the area, as did John Humphries [sic]. It does not appear that the family
had relocated, but in 1920, they lived in a predominantly African American area. Nearby Dirgin
Road (enumerated on the preceding census page) was predominantly white.
Records pertaining to the Barr estate indicate that Aus and Celia had conveyed separate 24-acre
tracts to Mart and Walter in 1919 (Rusk County District Court Records Cause #19143). The tract
containing site 41RK662 was deeded to Walter Barr, and a separate 24 acres in the Cortinas Survey
was deeded to Mart Barr. The record suggests that the Barr homestead/farm was located on the
subject 93-acre parcel and an adjacent 180-acre tract in the Cortinas Survey. Taken with associated
census evidence, the probate record suggests that the extended Barr family lived together on the
Barr estate during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (Rusk County District Court
Records Cause #19143).

According to probate documents, Aus Barr died in January of 1930 (Rusk County District Court
Records Cause #19143). In that year, his wife Sealie [sic] (75) appears as head of a household
including her daughter Bessie (indexed as 30). She is listed as a property-owning farmer and lived
near John Humphries [sic], James Menefee, John Menefee, and Mart Barr in a predominantly African
American area. Her continued residence near members of the same families she and her husband
had lived in proximity to since circa 1880 suggests the families were longtime members of the
Liberty (or Chapel Hill) community. It is possible that she still lived in or on the subject tract until
her death in 1934.

Upon Celia Barrâs death, her heirs entered into a lawsuit concerning the coupleâs community
property. In the resultant partition of the estate, their daughter Ella Pollard received 37-4/6-acre
tract containing site 41RK609 (Rusk County Deed Records 384:464). The deed was recorded in
1934. The Barrsâ daughter Bessie Barr, who lived with her parents through at least 1934, received a
separate 26-acre tract (Rusk County District Court Records Cause #19143). Her continued
residence with her parents during the period suggests that she might have received the tract
containing their homestead; however, neither the associated deeds nor the partition map included
in the district court records contain any specific information about improvements on the tracts. The
Pollards already owned another tract in the Williams Survey (see history of site 41RK636), and
100013883/100196

129

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
though it is possible they lived on the parcels containing sites 41RK609 and 41RK662, they may
have used the subject parcel for agriculture and/or leased it out tenants.

Walter and Emma Pollard appear in the 1930 Rusk County census records. The couple owned their
home along the Liberty to Chapel Hill Road, which ran through the current project area, and lived
one household from Emmaâs brother Walter Barr. Walter Barr had purchased 24 acres in the
Williams Survey from his parents in 1919, suggesting that both families may have been living in the
vicinity of the subject tract. The Pollardsâ household included Walter (54), Emma (50), Ivey (18),
Rogers (16), Lord (14), Lora (12), Irene (9), and Audrey (7). Though no further census data are
available, the Pollards retained the subject property through at least the 1980s and may have
occupied and/or used it for agriculture during the period.
Results Summary and Analysis: Though the nineteenth-century history of the parcels containing
sites 41RK609 and 41RK662 is unclear, the tracts were associated with the Aus and Celia Barr
family through most of the twentieth century, and the structural remnants still on-site suggest it
resulted from their use and/or occupation of the land. The family represented early African
American landowners within the distinct African American community that historically existed in
the project vicinity. As they owned additional acreage in the area, the site may not represent the
Barrsâ homestead, but many of their children lived in close proximity throughout the early
twentieth century, and the property was inherited by their daughter Emma Pollard in 1934. Census
evidence suggests the Pollard family could have lived on the parcel.

Despite the siteâs association with African American property owners, an underrepresented group
of people in the archeological record, it postdates the period of significance for African American
settlement in the region. As a result, the site does not possess the potential to provide additional
information about the group to the historical record. Additional archival research could provide
more contextual information about African American farmers/property owners in the area, but
would not likely clarify the history of this site during the period it was associated with the Barr
family. As a result, additional research is not recommended in connection with the current project.
Additionally, the individuals associated with the site have no known historical associations, and it is
not recommended for NRHP listing under Criterion A or B.

This site also includes a partially collapsed dwelling (A) and a wood-framed barn (B). Resource A is
the structural remnants of a circa 1930 wood-framed, single-family dwelling. Due to the structureâs
partial collapse, its original form, plan, and design are no longer apparent. It appears to have had a
gabled roof clad in composite shingles and 1/1, wood-framed windows, although neither are intact.
The extant exterior faÃ§ades are clad in beveled wooden siding. Resource B is a circa 1930 barn with
a gabled roof. This resource is also partially collapsed and is missing large portions of its external
walls. Thus, its original form and plan are no longer apparent. In their abandoned and dilapidated
states, both resources lack integrity of design, materials, workmanship, and feeling. The area
surrounding the structures is heavily overgrown, and as such the historic setting is no longer

100013883/100196

apparent. The house may maintain associations with the Barr family, early African American
residents of the former community of Liberty or Chapel Hill; however, it does not date from their
original occupation in the area nor does it appear to maintain associations with African American
settlement or history in the region. As a result, the resource is not recommended for NRHP
inclusion under Criterion A, B, or C.

Site 41RK636

The Luminant tract file for the parcel containing site 41RK636 does not provide any information
regarding the tractâs history between the 1856 partition of the Trammell estate and 1888 when J.C.
Hickey and T.J. Trammell conveyed 100 acres containing the subject 65-acre tract to Jesse Brooks
(Rusk County Deed Records 36:167). The Jesse Brooks family owned other property in the area,
and the subject tract may have constituted some portion of their home or farmstead (see history of
sites 41RK626, 41RK611, 41RK653, 41RK651, and 41RK647).

Census records indicate that Hickey and Trammell likely owned the parcel as an investment. In
1880, J.C. Hickey resided in the county seat of Henderson where he worked as a cotton buyer. The
T.J. Trammell family also appears in the 1880 Rusk County census records; however, they relocated
to Montague County some time prior to 1892 (Rusk County Deed Records 41:488) and owned a
substantial amount of land in the project vicinity (see history of sites 41RK632 and 41RK633).
Though it is unknown how long the men were associated with the subject parcel, it is likely that any
occupants of the property during their tenure of ownership would have been renters and/or
tenants.
In 1896, Jesse Brooks conveyed the subject 65 acres out of the 100-acre tract to his son Ollie Brooks
(Rusk County Deed Records 44:427). Census research suggests that the Brooks family resided in
the vicinity of the subject parcel throughout the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and
may have occupied and/or leased it out to tenants during their association with it. The family first
appears in the Rusk County census in 1880. In that year, Jesse Brooks (35) appears as the head of a
household containing his wife Ann (28), their children Oliver (9), Arizona (6), and Calvin
(5 months), and his mother Emily (67).
Ten years later, Jessie Brooks, his new wife Mollie, and their four children lived in Justice Precinct 3,
which contained the current project area, two households from his daughter Sallie and her husband
John Grant and three households from his son Ollie Brooks. Two families of renters lived between
Jessie and Ollie Brooks, suggesting the family may have employed tenants on their property.
Brooksâs daughter Arizona Ross and her husband Wm. L. also lived in the area, though not
immediately adjacent to her father. All of these individuals owned their property. Additional
archival research, including ad valorem tax research, could reveal how much property the family
owned in the area and a general timeline of their property acquisition.

Ollie and Minnie Brooks conveyed the 65-acre tract to W.M. Pollard in November of 1900 (Rusk
County Deed Records 51:88). The Pollard family appears to have retained the property through the
mid-twentieth century, and census research suggests they may have lived on it during at least some
portion of their association with the tract. In 1900, the year that he acquired the property, Pollard
(25), indexed as Wm. Pollard Jr., rented his home in Justice Precinct 3. The African American farmer
lived with his wife Emma (20) (daughter of Aus and Celia Barr) one household from Amanda
Pollard (65) (for more information about the Barr family, see the history of sites 41RK649 and
41RK409). Amanda Pollard owned her farm and lived with her children George (30), Henry (22),
and Beckey (20) and her grandchildren Edith (18) and Early (14). George worked as a farm laborer,
and Henry is indexed as a schoolteacher. The group lived in an area characterized by a mix of white
and black residents. William Pollard Sr., presumably William Pollardâs father, also lived in the area
(enumerated approximately two census pages after Amanda and William Pollard Jr.). The elder
Pollard lived in an area predominantly characterized by African American settlement.

In 1910, William Pollard (35) appears as a property-owning farmer living along the Henderson and
Harmony Hill Road in Justice Precinct 3. He is described as mulatto in the record, while his wife
Emma (30) is listed as black. Their household included Lesta (9), Sealie Bell (7), Robert (4), and
Henry (2). They lived in an area with a general mix of black, white, and mulatto residents. Ten years
later, William Pollard (indexed as 42) rented his home, and his household only included himself. By
1930, he was once again residing with his family. They lived along the Liberty-Chapel Hill Road,
which runs through the current project area near the parcel containing site 41RK636. The
household included William (54), Emma (50), Ivey (18), Rogers (16), Lloyd (14), Lora (12), Irene
(9), and Audrey (7) and was located in an area characterized by African American residence.
Archival evidence for other tracts in the project area suggests that the vicinity in which they lived
included the African American community of Liberty associated with the nearby Chapel Hill and
Springfield churches. The Pollard family retained the property through at least 1968 (Rusk County
Deed Records 886:81) and was likely associated with the creation of site 41RK636. They acquired
another parcel in the Williams Survey in 1934 (see history of site 41RK609), and together, the land
may have represented their farm.

Results Summary and Analysis: Though the mid-nineteenth-century history of the parcel
containing site 41RK636 is unknown, it may have been occupied by tenants during its association
with the Trammell family and/or by some member of the Brooks family or associated tenants
between 1888 and 1900. After 1900, the tract was associated with the Pollard family through the
mid-twentieth century. It is also possible that the Pollards occupied the property as tenants before
acquiring it as they appear as renters living in the project vicinity in the 1900 Rusk County census
records. The Pollards were related to the Barr family (see history of sites 41RK649 and 41RK409)
and lived in close proximity to other African American residents of the Liberty (or Chapel Hill)
community.

5. Results of the Archival Research
Despite the siteâs potential association with African American property owners, an
underrepresented group in the archeological record, it postdates the period of significance for early
African American settlement in the area. As a result, it does not have the potential to provide
additional information about this group to the historic record. Additionally, though supplemental
archival research could possibly provide contextual information about the former African American
community located in the project vicinity, it is unlikely that it could provide more information about
this specific site or the families associated with it. There is no evidence that the Pollards or any of
the propertyâs other owners maintained any known historic associations that would qualify the site
for NRHP listing under Criterion B, and it does not possess enough integrity or significance
archeologically to represent the broad patterns of historic association that would qualify it for
listing under Criterion A.

Site 41RK624

The Luminant tract file for the parcel containing site 41RK624 does not provide any information
regarding the tractâs history between the 1856 partition of the Trammell estate and 1892, when T.J.
Trammell sold his interest in an undisclosed number of town lots in Vernon, Texas, to Jno. Mays in
exchange for a lot in Henderson, Maysâs interest in an 89-acre tract in the Chism Survey in Rusk
County, $250 cash, and the assumption of Trammellâs liability in bonds for title on several tracts
held jointly with J.C. Hickey, including a 50-acre parcel then owned by Emaline Humphries [sic] that
included the subject 37.1-acre parcel (Rusk County Deed Records 40:578). In 1880, Emmaline
Humphrey is listed in the Rusk County census living in close proximity to other area occupants and
landowners including Aus Barr and Dick Findley. The Humphrey family was composed of Jas.
Humphrey, a 23-year-old African American farmer, his wife Emmaline (age 23), indentified as
âmulatto,â their three children Mattie, Jane, and Mary, and a 22-year-old boarder named Abraham
Humphrey, all identified as âmulatto.â Historians did not locate any entry for this family in the 1900
Rusk County census.

In 1903, J.C. Hickey and J.M. Mays sold the subject 50 acres to Susie Cato, Burnie [sic] Cato, Eli Cato,
and Leon Cato for $250 cash paid by their father N.J. Cato (Rusk County Deed Records 54:342). The
high value of the property indicates that it may have contained improvements. This deed specifies
that the land is for the benefit of N.J. Catoâs four children and that the $250 was derived from the
sale of lands held by N.J. Cato and his first wife, Cora, deceased. In 1900, âCapâ Cato, also known as
N.J. Cato, was enumerated in the Rusk County census as a 40-year-old African American farmer
living in Precinct 3. His household included his wife Elizabeth and children Susan, Bonnie, and Eli
and a third daughter whose name was indecipherable. The record also indicates that Cato had been
previously married and that he owned his home farm with a free title. The location of the household
within the precinct was not recorded. In 1920, N.J. Cato was listed in the Rusk County census as a
55-year-old African American farmer living in Precinct 3. It is possible that the Cato family occupied
the subject property during this period.
100013883/100196

133

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
By 1925 Bonnie Cato (also known as Burnie) had passed away. Although her probate was not
included in the land records provided by Luminant. It appears that at least a portion of her interest
in the subject property was inherited by her sibling, Eli Cato. Eli Cato sold all of his undivided
interest in the property to his father N.J. Cato for $120 in 1925 (Rusk County Deed Records 173:77).
Thus, the owners of the property included N.J. Cato, Susie Cato, and Leon Cato. The Cato family
continued to own the property through 1953, when they sold the property to J.A. Pollard for $700
(Rusk County Deed Records 430:414, 389:298, 500:449). According to the 1930 census, the latest
year that records were available, N.J. Cato resided on the Liberty-Chapel Hill Road on his home
farm. This roadway corresponds roughly to the current location of FM 2658, which suggests that he
occupied the subject parcel at the time.
Results Summary and Analysis: Although there are some gaps in the early chain of title for the
property, it appears that the parcel was associated with nonresident owners from the mid-1850s
through 1903, when the Cato family acquired the property. The Catos retained the parcel through
the early 1950s and likely resided on the subject tract. Thus, it is probable that site 41RK624 is
associated with the ownership/occupancy of the N.J. Cato family or Catoâs heirs.

Although this site is potentially associated with African American property owners, an
underrepresented group in the archeological record, it postdates the period of significance for early
African American settlement in the area. As a result, it does not have the potential to provide
additional information about this group to the historic record. Additionally, though supplemental
archival research could possibly provide contextual information about the former African American
community located in the project vicinity, it is unlikely that it could provide more information about
this specific site or the families associated with it. There is no evidence that the Pollards or any of
the propertyâs other owners maintained any known historic associations that would qualify the site
for NRHP listing under Criterion B, and it does not possess enough integrity or significance
archeologically to represent the broad patterns of historic association that would qualify it for
listing under Criterion A.

Luminant Tracts 591A and 591B

Archeologists were not granted permissible access to this property and as a result, no survey was
performed on this tract. However, there is one historic-age standing structure located on the
property, a circa 1935 wood-framed bungalow (see Resource 13). There is a gap in the early chain
of title for this property from the 1856 partition of the Trammell estate until 1904, when J.C. Hickey
and J.M. Mays sold the 50-acre property including Luminant Tracts 591A and 591B to Fred D.
Ballenger for $300. Hickey and Mays were not residents of the project area and likely owned the
property as an investment (see history of site 41RK636).
Historians found no listing of Fred Ballenger in the Rusk County census records, and by 1915 he
was deceased, and his property had transferred to his parents Will and Lucinda (Rusk County Deed

100013883/100196

134

5. Results of the Archival Research
Records 87:9). There is a marked burial in the New Prospect Cemetery, approximately 4.5 miles
east of the subject tract, for Fred D. Ballinger [sic], son of Will Ballinger [sic], 1882â1907. Thus, Fred
Ballengerâs association with the property was very brief, spanning just 3 years.

Census records indicate that they had lived in the area prior to their son acquiring the parcel and
that the property did not likely represent any portion of the Will Ballenger homestead. Will and
Lucinda Ballenger retained the property through 1915, when they sold it to their sons Elias J. and
Charles W. Ballenger. The 1910 census lists Elias J. and Charles W. Ballenger living in their parentsâ
household near the project area, on the Henderson-Marshall Road (State Highway 43). This record
lists Elias as a 31-year-old African American public school teacher and Charles as a 29-year-old
African American farmer. Will and Lucinda Ballenger do not appear to have ever resided on the
subject tract as they maintained a household on a separate parcel. Charles (and wife Dora) and Elias
Ballenger retained the property through 1928, when they sold a one-half interest in the tract to
their father Will Ballenger for $412.50 (Rusk County Deed Records 151:120). The 1920 Rusk
County census lists Charles W. Ballinger [sic] as a 39-year-old African American farmer living on
Harmony Hill Road. His household included his wife Dora and children Arnold, Velma, and Joseph.
The next entry is for William Ballinger, age 76 [sic], listed as head of the household, and his son
Elias, age 38. William listed his occupation as farmer, and Elias listed his as a farm laborer on a
home farm.
In 1933, Elias Ballenger took out a deed of trust on the south 25 acres of the property in favor of
W.E. Wylie, as trustee for M. Kangerga and Brother of Henderson. This suggests that Elias Ballenger
was associated with the southern half of the property, where Resource 13 stands. It is possible that
this deed of trust was made to secure materials for construction of the dwelling, as the Kangergas,
ran several businesses, including a mercantile in Henderson. It appears that the conditions of the
lien were fulfilled, as Elias Ballenger retained interest in the property through 1944 (Rusk County
Deed Records 381:482).

William Ballenger died in 1934 (Find A Grave Inc. 2009a), but the tract file provided by Luminant
did not provide any of his probate materials. It appears that he retained his one-half interest in the
property and passed it to his heirs. In 1944, O.A. Ballenger, E.J. Ballenger, C.W. Ballenger, Ben H.
Ballenger, W.G. Ballenger, Willie Haywood and husband John Haywood, Beatrice Adams, a widow,
Mattie Trimble, a widow, Mary E. Isbell and husband Jesse Isbell, Napoleon Humphries, Louise
Hicks and husband Robert T. Hicks, being all of the heirs of Will Ballenger and Lucinda Ballenger,
sold the 50-acre property to Thomas Gray and his wife Le Ann Gray for $750. The 1930 Rusk
County census lists âTommieâ Gray as a 37-year-old African American farmer renting his home on
the Liberty-Chapel Hill Road. His household included his wife Lean [sic], daughters Lurline, Loraine,
and Dorothy, son Clifford, and brother-in-law Oscar Reese. Given that the Gray family did not own
their property in 1930, it is possible that they purchased this property to use as their homestead
and may have occupied the subject tract. The Gray family retained the subject tract through the
remainder of the historic period, deeding the 1-acre Tract 591B to Samuel Moss in 1981.

Results Summary and Analysis: Although there is a gap in the early chain of title for the property,
it appears that the parcel was associated with nonresident owners from the mid-1850s through the
early 1900s, it appears that the property was associated with nonresident owners until the late
1920s or early 1930s, when it was associated with the Ballenger family. The Ballengers were
associated with the property until the mid-1940s, when they sold the property to Thomas Gray. The
archival records indicate that any archeological deposits on the property would likely be associated
with tenants of Hickey and Mays, the Ballengers, or the Gray family.

EARLY HISTORY OF THE SAMUEL C. WRIGHT SURVEY, RUSK COUNTY
ABSTRACT 819, SITES 41RK620 (PART OF), AND 41RK662

Luminant Tract 1327, the southern portion of the tract containing site 41RK620, and the tract
containing site 41RK663 are located within the original 657-acre Samuel C. Wright Nacogdoches
2nd-class headright in Rusk County (see Figure 16). See Early History of the Juan Prado Survey for
discussion of site 41RK620. Second-class headrights were issued to individuals who arrived in
Texas between March 1, 1836, and October 1, 1837, and typically included 640 acres for single men
or 1,280 acres for heads of families (Lang and Long 2010). Wright received 1,280 acres, indicating
he was married upon his arrival in Texas, but he died before the patent date. The survey was
divided into two parcels in separate counties. Wrightâs unnamed heirs patented the 657-acre
portion of the survey in Rusk County in 1850 (Texas GLO Records; Rusk County Abstract 819). They
patented the remaining 623 acres in Rockwall County 4 years later (Texas GLO Records, Rockwall
County Abstract 218). In 1869, J.A. Frisby of Walker County sold his one-half interest in the 657acre Wright Survey to S.Y. Smith of Galveston County and H.N. Jones of Grimes County for $500
(Grimes County Deed Records S:667; Walker County Deed Records S:246). The following year,
Smith and Jones sold the interest to R.H. Baxby of Brazoria County for $650 (Grimes County Deed
Records S:667). Baxby owned the interest in the property for less than 1 year, selling it to Eleanor P.
Jones of Grimes County for $500 (Brazoria County Deed Records X:263). In 1875, Jones, then a
resident of Mecklenburg County, Virginia, sold her one-half interest in the 657 acres as well as
acreage in Limestone and Kaufman counties to E.N. Howerton for $3,000. It appears that Howerton
100013883/100196

5. Results of the Archival Research
failed to render taxes on the property for the year 1878, and F.H. Oberthier purchased the one-half
interest at a public auction in 1879 (Rusk County Deed Records 27:339).

In 1878 James McDaniel of Walker County, attorney in fact for M.O.E. McDaniel of Walker County,
took out a deed of trust against the remaining one-half interest in the subject 657 acres for $200
payable to F.H. Oberthier of Henderson (Rusk County Deed Records 13:295, Z:273). The deed
records state that M.O.E. McDaniel was the daughter of Mary McDaniel, deceased, who was the
daughter of S.C. Wright of Walker County. The Walker County 1880 census records list James
McDaniel [sic] as a 45-year-old carpenter living in the household of Henry and Mary Harrington.
McDanielâs household included his probable children Mary (age 14), Martha (age11), and Jane (age
2). Historians did not find an entry in the Rusk County census for F.H. Oberthier, but the deed
records state that he resided in Henderson. In 1879, Oberthier sold a one-half interest in the subject
657 acres to J.A. Vinson of Rusk County, stating that McDaniels had failed to satisfy the terms of the
deed of trust (Rusk County Deed Records 27:349). J.A. Vinson owned a plantation east of the project
area, near the community of Oak Hill, where he was known to reside and did not occupy the
property (Jones et al. 1987).

Site 41RK663

In 1893, J.A. Vinson of Rusk County sold the 50-acre parcel containing site 41RK662 to Hez Pollard
and J.R. Isbell for $250 (Rusk County Deed Records 42:539). Hezikiah Pollard is listed in the 1880
Rusk County in the household of his father William Pollard. In addition to 16-year-old Hezikiah, the
household included Williamâs wife Catherine and other children Elizabeth, Mattie, William, and
Harvey. According to the 1900 Rusk County census, Hez Pollard was living on his home farm in
Justice Precinct 3, which included the general area of site 41RK662. There are several J. Isbells
enumerated in the area as well.

In 1902, Isbell sold his interest in the 50-acre parcel to Pollard for $125 (Rusk County Deed Records
354:176). Hez Pollard continued to own the property through his death in 1933 (Find A Grave Inc.
2009b). In the 1910 Rusk County census, he is listed as a 47-year-old African American farmer
living in close proximity to several other known project area residents such as Aus Barr and Peter
Gray. His household included his wife Fannie and children Clara, Larissa Hessie, Katy, Ellen, Ethel,
Julius, and John. Census records indicate that Hez Pollard continued to live on the property and was
engaged in farming through 1930. Although the Luminant tract file for the property does not
include any probate records for Pollard, it appears that following his death the property passed to
his heirs, who retained it through 1973 (Rusk County Deed Records 354:256, 1184:252, 208:452,
959:121â123, 962:495).

Luminant Tract 1327

In 1895, Oberthier sold a 66.5-acre parcel, including Luminant Tract 1327 and land in the Cortinas
Survey, to Dick Findley for $226. The low value of the property suggests that it did not include
100013883/100196

137

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
improvements at the time of conveyance (Rusk County Deed Records 64:434). Findley owned the
property through his death, sometime between 1900, when he was listed in the Rusk County
census, and 1909, when deed records indicate he was deceased (Rusk County Deed Records 68:29).
Although Findley owned this property for some time, it does not appear that he occupied the
property, as he owned other lands in the project area prior to the purchase of this property. It is
most likely that his homestead was located on the lands that he owned prior to his purchase of the
subject tract. Following Findleyâs death, the property appears to have been passed to his heirs, who
sought to legally partition the lands associated with his estate in 1934 (Rusk County Deed Records
124:259). According to the partition deed, a 44.33-acre parcel was partitioned to Mary Findley
Booty and Larkin Booty along with 44.55 acres in the Cortinas Survey. According to a 1937
transmission line easement, the Bootys lived in Tatum and did not occupy the subject tract (Rusk
County Deed Records 319:566).
Mary and Larkin Booty died in 1938; although their probate records were not provided in the
Luminant tract files for the subject tracts, it appears that their daughter Willie Booty Peterson and
her husband Calup Peterson inherited the property (Luminant Tract File, Tract 1323). Mary and
Calup Peterson owned the property through their deaths in 1948 and 1968, respectively. The
subject 4.78-acre tract was partitioned to Curly Faye Harris, daughter of Mary and Calup Peterson,
in 1974 (Rusk County Deed Records 990:848).

Results Summary and Analysis: It appears that the parcels containing site 41RK663 and
Luminant Tract 1327 were associated with nonresident owners until they were deeded to Hez
Pollard and Dick Findley in 1893 and 1895. Although it is possible that Findley or his family may
have resided on the parcels containing Luminant Tract 1327 during his lengthy tenure of
ownership, Findley owned other lands in the area prior to purchasing this property, and it is more
likely that any occupancy of the parcels was that of Findleyâs tenants or squatters.
Given Pollardâs long association with the parcel containing site 41RK663 (1893â1933), it is likely
that the site was associated with his home farm, although it is possible that any archeological
deposits dating from 1893 to 1902 may have been associated with Frank Isbell, who co-owned the
property during those years. A possible dwelling and outbuilding are evident on a 1935 aerial
photograph of the site location (Tobin International 1935).

Despite the propertyâs potential association with African American property owners, an
underrepresented group in the archeological record, these occupations postdate the period of
significance for early African American settlement in the area. As a result, they do not have the
potential to provide additional information about this group to the historic record. Additionally,
though supplemental archival research could possibly provide contextual information about the
former African American community located in the project vicinity, it is unlikely that it could
provide more information about this specific site or the families associated with it. There is no
evidence that the Pollards or any of the propertyâs other owners maintained any known historic

100013883/100196

138

5. Results of the Archival Research
associations that would qualify site 41RK663 for NRHP listing under Criterion B, and it does not
possess enough integrity or significance archeologically to represent the broad patterns of historic
association that would qualify it for listing under Criterion A. Furthermore, it appears that
Luminant Tract 1327 was associated with tenants or squatters throughout most of its history.

EARLY HISTORY OF THE LOWRY HAMPTON SURVEY, RUSK COUNTY
ABSTRACT 353 (LUMINANT TRACT 1369)

Archeologists were not granted permissible access to Luminant Tract 1369, thus the property was
not surveyed. The majority (98 acres) of the 123-acre parcel is located within the 177-acre Lowry
Hampton Nacogdoches first-class headright. The remaining 25 acres included in Tract 1369 are
located in the Juan Prado Survey (see Early History of the Juan Prado Survey, Rusk County Abstract
621 for early history of the portion of the tract located within the Prado Survey). First-class
headrights were issued to early Texas settlers, those living in the state prior to Texas Independence
in 1836 (Lang and Long 2010). Hamptonâs heirs patented the headright in 1857 to include the
177-acre subject tract and an additional 4,428 acres in Polk County. According to documents
included in the Luminant tract file for the property, Lowery Hampton resided in Nacogdoches in
1824, before relocating to Claiborne, Louisiana, in 1827. However, GLO records dating to 1834
indicate that he was a resident of Texas as early as 1828 and lived in Texas at the time. It is
unknown if Hampton or his heirs ever resided on the subject tract.

The Luminant tract file provided for the portion of the tract located within the Hampton Survey
contains a gap in the chain of title from 1857, when it was patented by the heirs of Lowry Hampton,
to 1902, when W.H. Waldrop and his wife E.L. Waldrop of Panola County deeded their interest in
the subject 98 acres and other tracts in the Juan Prado Survey, to L.M. (Lum) Ross for $150 cash and
assumption of a vendorâs lien in the amount of $59 payable to R.W. Hall. The acreage in the
Hampton Survey, together with acreage conveyed from the Prado Survey composes the current
Luminant Tract 1369. This record also indicates that the property was part of the estate of
Benjamin Franklin Ross, who died in 1901 (Find A Grave Inc. 2009c; Rusk County Deed Records
68:133). Census records indicate a number of Waldrops residing in adjacent Panola County in 1900,
but there was no listing for W.H. Waldrop in the Rusk County census records, suggesting that they
did not occupy the subject tract.
Although the Luminant tract file provided does not contain any information regarding Lum Rossâs
acquisition of the property, it is likely that he inherited it from his father Benjamin Franklin Ross
following his death in 1901. A 28-year-old Benjamin Ross was enumerated in the 1880 Rusk County
census living in the household of his mother Mary Ross, age 52 in the 3rd Precinct, which included
the current property area. The 1900 Rusk County census records list a Ben Ross as a 47-year-old
white farmer living in Precinct 3 with his wife Julia (age 47) and sons Lum, Bennie, Lonnie, and
William (ages 20, 17, 13, and 10) and daughters Evia and Emma (ages 10 and 7).
100013883/100196

139

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
In 1905, J.L. Brooks and his wife B.D. Brooks sold their interest in the subject 98 acres and other
tracts in the Juan Prado Survey to Lum Ross for $250 in vendorâs lien notes (Rusk County Deed
Records 68:134). The 98 acres in the Hampton Survey and additional acreage in the Prado Survey
conveyed in this transaction comprise the current Luminant Tract 1369. Historians found no listing
for J.L. and B.D. Brooks in the Rusk County census records, suggesting they did not occupy the
subject tract. Lum Ross was enumerated in the 1910 Rusk County census as a 28-year-old farmer
living on the Henderson and Marshall Road, which does not correspond to the location of Luminant
Tract 1369, suggesting that Lum Ross and his family did not reside on the subject tract. His
household included his wife Cara [sic] (age 25), daughters Essie and Julia (ages 4 and 3), and son
Barnie [sic] age 3 months.

Lum Ross died on September 28, 1910, and is buried in the Waldrop Cemetery nearby in Panola
County (Find A Grave Inc. 2010). Following his death, his wife Carra married Ollie Brooks, and she
passed away in 1919 (Find a Grave Inc. 2003b). On February 4, 1911, a partition deed was recorded
dividing his estate among his heirs Essie May Ross, Julia Esther Ross, Barney Ross, Lonnie Ross,
Billie Ross, and Emmie Ross. This deed makes no mention of heirship for his wife Carra. The
98-acre tract in the Hampton Survey, along with an additional 77 acres in the adjacent Prado
Survey (both of which compose the current Luminant Tract 1369) were partitioned among his
minor children Essie May, Julia Esther, and Barney Ross along with adjoining acreage in the Juan
Prado Survey (Rusk County District Court Records 2:613â615).

In the 1920 Rusk County census records, 10-year-old Barney Ross was listed in the household of his
stepfather Ollie Brooks along with his stepbrothers Chester and Russell Brooks. Their household
was located in the Church Hill Community along the âDirgin Road,â which roughly corresponds to
the location of the subject tract. Essie and Julia Ross were listed in the household of their maternal
grandparents James and Sarah Gentry in Panola County. In 1924, Julia Ross, who had married B.
Hardin, sold her interest in the estates of her parents, including the subject parcel, to Barney Ross
and Essie Mae Faulkner. The 1930 Rusk County census lists 21-year-old Barney Ross residing in the
household of his brother-in-law Dewey Faulkner, sister Essie Faulkner, and nephew James. This
record indicated that Dewey Faulkner owned his home farm. Barney Ross and Dewey Faulkner
were listed as farmers engaged in general farm work. The household was located on the ChapmanLiberty-Church Hill Road, which may correlate to present-day FM 2258.
In 1933, the Faulkners deeded their interest in the property to Barney Ross and his wife Inez for
$10 in cash and a venderâs lien note for $500 (Rusk County Deed Records 229:336). Barney and
Inez Ross owned the property through Barneyâs death in 1983, after which the property was solely
owned by Inez Ross (Rusk County Probate Records 96:113).

Results Summary and Analysis: Although project archeologists were not granted permissible
access to tract Luminant Tract 1369 and it is unknown if any historic archeology sites are present
on the property, archival evidence suggests that any archeological deposits dating from circa 1900
100013883/100196

140

5. Results of the Archival Research
through the end of the historic period would be associated with the Ross family or their tenants. It
appears that the tract has been owned, and possibly occupied, by the Ross family for over 100 years
and that their descendants still retain ownership of the property. Any earlier deposits may have
been associated with Lowry T. Hampton or his heirs, although archival evidence suggests that he
may not have inhabited the property for any prolonged period, if at all. It is unlikely that any
deposits from that period would be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion A or B.
Neither site maintains known associative significance that would qualify it for NRHP listing under
Criterion A or B.

EARLY HISTORY OF THE JUAN PRADO SURVEY, RUSK COUNTY ABSTRACT
621 (SITES 41RK613, 41RK35, AND 41RK655 â EXCLUDED FROM PERMIT
AREA)

The two tracts containing sites 41RK613 (Luminant Tract 1382), 41RK35, and 41RK655 (Luminant
Tract 1381) are both located within the original 1180.90-acre Juan Prado Nacogdoches 1st-class
Headright in Rusk County (see Figure 15). First-class headrights were issued to individuals who
arrived in Texas prior to the stateâs independence in 1836 (Lang and Long 2010). The headright
was patented in 1850 by W.W. Wingfield to include the 1,180 acres in Abstract 621. W.W. Wingfield
(66) is listed in the Rusk County census records in 1850 as a farmer living in the Alma Post Office
District with his wife Eliza (44). They do not appear on any subsequent census records, and it is
unknown if they ever resided on the Juan Prado Survey.

Luminant did not provide historians with any information about the tracts containing sites within
the Prado Survey. Supplemental archival research, including chain of title and/or ad valorem tax
research, would be necessary in order to identify possible occupants associated with the sites
and/or to determine local land use over time.
With the permit boundary revision (see Introduction), both tracts 1381 and 1382 have been
excluded from the Liberty Deposit permit area. Consequently, sites 41RK35, 41RK613, and
41RK655 are no longer within the permit boundary and will not be impacted by mine related
development.

SURVEY RESULTS
INTRODUCTION
The intent of this section is to summarize the results of the pedestrian survey and evaluate the
utility of the predictive models employed. Two separate predictive models were used, one for
locating historic sites and one for locating prehistoric sites. For prehistoric sites, the Liberty
Deposit was stratified into high, medium, and low probability areas (HPAs, MPAs, and LPAs) based
on landform shape and distance to a second-order or higher-order drainage or to Holocene alluvial
deposits. To help locate historic sites, the project historian identified HHPAs based on examination
of georeferenced historic aerial imagery and topographic quadrangle sheets. This analysis is based
on the results of survey within the previously proposed Liberty Deposit permit area, of which
3,504.98 acres were surveyed.

PREHISTORIC PROBABILITY AREAS AND SHOVEL TESTING

The patterned distribution of shovel tests positive for prehistoric artifacts was consistent with the
expectations inherent to the predictive model used for locating prehistoric sites. Not unexpectedly,
this was not true for the distribution of shovel tests positive for historic artifacts. Examining this
distributional variability, however, may help distinguish land-use patterns during the historic and
prehistoric periods.

A total of 4,336 shovel tests were excavated within the current limits of the Liberty Deposit Mine
Area during the pedestrian survey. Of these, 4,151 were culturally sterile. Of the remaining shovel
tests, 49 contained prehistoric artifacts, while 132 contained historic artifacts, 3 contained both
historic and prehistoric artifacts, and 1 contained a piece of fire-cracked rock.

Prehistoric HPAs comprised 355.7 acresâ10 percent of the 3,541.2-acre area surveyed, while LPAs
comprised 2,221.0 acresâ63 percent of this area. MPAs comprised the remaining 964.5 acres
surveyed, or 27 percent of the total project area. A total of 1,036 shovel tests were excavated in
HPAs, while 1,423 were excavated in MPAs, and 1,877 shovel tests were excavated in LPAs.

Shovel tests positive for prehistoric artifacts occurred with the greatest frequency in HPAs where
one was excavated for each 11.47 acres surveyed (Table 4). Shovel tests positive for historic
artifacts were much less common in HPAs where one was excavated for each 18.72 acres surveyed.
Shovel tests positive for prehistoric artifacts were much rarer in MPAs where one was excavated
for each 68.89 acres surveyed, and even more rare in LPAs were one was excavated for each

444.20 acres surveyed. Shovel tests positive for historic artifacts occurred with nearly the same
frequency in both MPAs and LPAs, where one was excavated for each 26.07 and 28.11 acres
surveyed, respectively.

Archeological Components
The picture described above may be somewhat distorted due to differences in how sites were
shovel tested. Some sites received more shovel tests than others and consequently had a greater
likelihood of having more positive tests. This conflict can be resolved through examination of the
distribution of archeological components across the area surveyed.

Historic Components and HHPAs

During the present investigation 59 archeological sites were evaluated, representing 22 prehistoric
components and 41 historic components. The historic components were strongly associated with
the 124 HHPAs identified by the project historian prior to the initiation of the survey. Of these
HHPAs, 94 were identified on aerial photographs dating to 1935, while 18 were identified on the
USGS Minden 15-minute topographic quadrangle map, and the remaining 12 were identified on
both.
Of the 41 historic components within the permit area, 37 were associated with HHPAs identified on
either or both of these sources, while the remaining 4 were associated with neither. Historic
components were somewhat more strongly associated with HHPAs discerned on the topographic
map than on the aerial photograph. Of the 106 HHPAs that were identified on the aerial photograph
or on the map and the aerial photograph, 37 (35 percent) were associated with historic
components. Of the 30 HHPAs identified on the map or the photograph and the map, 12
(40 percent) were associated with historic components.

Subsurface Prehistoric and Historic Components and Prehistoric Probability Areas

Subsurface cultural materials were recovered from 14 prehistoric components and 31 historic
components from 43 sites. No subsurface cultural materials were recovered from 4 prehistoric sites
(41RK14, 41RK16, 41RK26, and 41RK27) nor were any recovered from 9 historic sites (41RK609,
100013883/100196

41RK612, 41RK627, 41RK641, 41RK647, 41RK648, 41RK651, 41RK656, and 41RK664). The
prehistoric sites from which subsurface artifacts were not recovered were all recorded prior to the
impoundment of Martin Lake. The failure to recover any cultural remains from these sites may be
due to natural and cultural transformations postdating their initial recordation. Historic sites
lacking subsurface deposits were expressed only on the surface-by-surface artifact scatters,
standing architecture, and/or structural remains. Sites lacking subsurface deposits are not further
considered in this evaluation.
Not surprisingly, prehistoric and historic subsurface components were differentially distributed
across prehistoric probability areas. Table 5 compares the concentration of these components by
probability area and by the number of identification shovel tests (culturally sterile, off-site shovel
tests) excavated to locate each component. Because not all components were restricted to only one
probability area or soil type, the proportion of each component within these areas was determined
based on the number of positive shovel tests from each component. Historic components were
relatively evenly distributed across high, medium, and low probability areas, while prehistoric
components were strongly correlated with HPAs, weakly correlated with MPAs and very weakly
correlated with LPAs.

In HPAs, one prehistoric component was identified for each 51.87 acres surveyed. Although historic
components were concentrated in HPAs, with one identified for each 80.32 acres surveyed, they
were almost half as likely to occur in these settings as prehistoric components were. Nearly 144
discovery shovel tests were excavated for each prehistoric component identified in HPAs, while
nearly 223 discovery shovel tests were excavated for each historic component identified.
Prehistoric components were much less common in MPAs, where one component was identified for
each 227.32 acres surveyed, than in HPAs. In MPAs 323.84 discovery shovel tests were excavated
for each prehistoric component identified. Historic components were more than 2.5 times more
common than prehistoric components in MPAs, where one component was identified for each
87.12 acres surveyed. A total of 124.1 identification shovel tests were excavated to locate each
historic component in MPAs.

100013883/100196

155

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
Subsurface prehistoric components were very rare in LPAs where an average of one component
was found for each 765.86 acres surveyed. More than 617 identification shovel tests were
excavated for each prehistoric component identified in LPAs. Historic components were somewhat
less common in LPAs than they were in MPAs. In LPAs one historic component was identified for
each 143.29 acres surveyed. Only 115.55 identification shovel tests were needed for each historic
component located in LPAs. The low number of shovel tests required to locate historic components
in LPAs is due to the targeted way such areas were surveyed. In LPAs, shovel tests were excavated
judgmentally as well as on HHPAs.

Prehistoric probability areas were drawn based on landform shape and distance to water. The
results of the present investigation suggest rather strongly that proximity to water was more of a
determining factor in site location during the prehistoric period than the historic period. For
subsurface prehistoric components, the distance to a second-order or higher-order stream, or
Holocene alluvial deposits, ranged between 11.58 and 258.64 m, with an average of 99.85 m and a
narrow standard deviation of 82.46 m. Only three prehistoric components were located at distances
greater than one standard deviation above the mean to a second-order or higher-order stream. For
historic subsurface components, the distance to a second-order or higher-order stream or Holocene
alluvial deposits ranged between 9.38 and 1,238.65 m, with an average of 430.53 m and a very
broad standard deviation of 311.15 m. Four subsurface historic components were located at
distances, to a second-order or higher-order stream or Holocene alluvial deposits, greater than one
standard deviation above the mean.

Within the area surveyed, the elevation in feet above mean sea level (msl) is closely tied to distance
from a watercourse. The highest elevated settings are ridge summits and shoulderslopes far from
water, while the lowest elevated settings are typically along watercourses. The range in elevation of
historic and prehistoric components is consistent with the findings above and suggests that close
proximity to a water source was more important for the prehistoric occupants of the Liberty
Deposit than it was for the historic occupants.
Historic components tended to be located on higher elevated settings than prehistoric components.
The elevation of historic components also ranged more widely than the elevation of prehistoric
components. The average elevation of historic components is 353.12 feet (ft), with a range of
313.32 to 397.58 ft and a standard deviation of 21.99 ft. The average elevation of prehistoric
components is 332.58 ft, with a range of 313.41 to 358.76 ft and a narrow standard deviation of
14.06 ft.

Subsurface Prehistoric and Historic Components and Soil

A large majority of both historic and prehistoric subsurface components identified within the
Liberty Deposit were found in settings with either Woodtell loam, 5 to 15 percent slopes or Latex
very fine sandy loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes (tables 6 and 7). These are the most common soil types

Out of the 31 subsurface historic components identified, 21.02, representing 68 percent of those in
this class, occurred in settings with either Woodtell loam or Latex very fine sandy loam. The
remaining components were found on six different soil types: Sawlit-Sawtown complex, 0 to
2 percent slopes, Kirvin gravelly fine sandy loam, 2 to 5 percent slopes, Meth fine sandy loam, 2 to
5 percent slopes, Sawlit loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes, Cuthbert fine sandy loam, 5 to 15 percent

Woodtell loam, 5 to 15 percent slopes, is primarily found on shoulderslopes and lower slope
components above Martin Lake and along smaller tributary drainages to Martin Creek. Latex very
fine sandy loam is found on ridge summits and shoulders above slopes with Woodtell loam.

Slope Component and Archeological Components

The setting of all archeological components evaluated, including both those components with and
without subsurface deposits, as well as those components that have since been excluded from the
permit area, was categorized by slope component. Settings were classified as summit,
shoulderslope, footslope, and toeslope (Table 8).

The most common settings for both historic and prehistoric components were shoulderslopes.
Nearly 60 percent of all prehistoric components identified were located on shoulderslopes, while
nearly 70 percent of all historic components were found in such settings. Historic components were
somewhat more likely to occur on summits than were prehistoric components. In contrast,
prehistoric components were more likely to occur on footslopes than were historic components.
Only one prehistoric component and one historic component were located on toeslopes. The low
number of sites on toeslopes within the Liberty Deposit is likely due to the inundation of the Martin
Creek floodplain when Martin Lake was created.

Summary

The predictive models used to stratify the Liberty Deposit proved to be effective tools to help locate
prehistoric and historic sites. Although prehistoric HPAs constituted just over 10 percent of the
area surveyed, nearly 60 percent of all subsurface prehistoric components were identified within
100013883/100196

158

6. Survey Results
these settings. Prehistoric LPAs comprise more than 60 percent of the area surveyed, yet these
settings harbored merely 18 percent of the subsurface prehistoric components identified. HHPAs
were also found to be strongly associated with this historic components identified. Out of the 41
historic components identified, 37 (90 percent) were associated with an HHPA.

The observed patterned variability in the distribution of historic verses prehistoric components
across the Liberty Mine resulted from a combination of systemic preabandonment behavioral
processes as well as postabandonment natural and cultural processes. Historic components were
more evenly distributed across the area surveyed. These components, however, tended to occur at
higher elevations and were more distant from sources of water than prehistoric components. This
pattern may be partially due to the fact that historic populations were able to dig wells at
residential sites, unlike prehistoric populations, and would have been less dependent upon a
nearby source of water. It is also likely that, during the historic period, residential sites would have
been situated, to maximize access to routes of transportation, along well-drained ridges rather than
bottomlands subject to repeated flooding.

SITE DESCRIPTIONS
Site 41RK12 (Revisit)
Background

Site 41RK12 was originally recorded as a historic house site in 1972 during a survey conducted
prior to the impoundment of Martin Lake (TARL records). The site was recorded on the northern
end of a ridge, originally located above and south of the Dry Creek confluence with Martin Creek.
The site is situated at an elevation of 320 ft above msl. Soils within the boundaries of the site consist
of Woodtell loam, 5 to 15 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). Typical soils encountered during shovel
testing consisted of 30 cm of brown, pale brown, and reddish brown sandy loam over reddish
brown or strong brown clay subsoil.

When site 41RK12 was first recorded, a brick chimney base and a house foundation were found
upon a rectangular mound of soil. Also noted were numerous stock feeders, a dump area, and a
depression that was likely the remains of a well or cistern. The overall size of the site was not
recorded, and no scale exists on the original site sketch map. However, the size of the residential
structure, based on the footprint of the foundation, was noted at roughly 40 ft (12.2 m) by 50 ft
(15.2 m). The landowner during the time of the first survey, Preston Reese of Henderson, indicated
that the residence was owned by his grandfather, Peter Gray, and was occupied some time prior to
1900.

Since its original recording, a natural gas well pad has been constructed west of the site. The
majority of the site is located in a cleared, grassy field and is surrounded by dense pines. Vegetation
consists of large pine trees interspersed with a few smaller hardwoods. Grasses blanketed the site
100013883/100196

159

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
and entirely obscured the ground surface. The shore of Martin Lake is located approximately 10 m
north and 20 m west of the site boundaries.

Work Performed

While no structural remnants were found during the current survey, subsurface cultural materials
were recovered. A total of 10 shovel tests were excavated at 10-m intervals to define the siteâs
horizontal and vertical extents. Of these 10 tests, only 2 (shovel tests 4 and 8) yielded cultural
materials. Based on the horizontal distribution of the culturally positive shovel tests, site 41RK12
extends 10 m north-south by 30 m east-west, covering an area of roughly 300 m2 (Figure 19).

Artifact Assemblage

The artifact assemblage from site 41RK12 consists of one colorless glass shard with bubbles and
three wire nails recovered from between 0 and 20 cmbs. The site was not expressed on the surface.
In general, glass with bubble inclusions predates 1920 (Polak 2000). Wire nails were introduced
during the first quarter of the nineteenth century but did not replace cut nails until the last decade
of the century (Adams 2002).

Archival Research

Archival research indicates that the site may have been associated with the use or occupation of the
property by an African American farmer named Peter Gray or his tenants. Gray owned the property
including the site from the late nineteenth century through the mid-twentieth century.
Despite the siteâs association with an African American property owner, the site does not have the
potential to provide additional information to the historical record. As a result, additional research
is not recommended in connection with the current project. The individuals associated with these
sites have no known historical associations, and they are not recommended for NRHP listing.

Discussion and Recommendation

During the current survey, none of the structural elements originally recorded were found. It is
likely that these structural elements were destroyed during the construction of the nearby well pad
since the date of first recording. The historic artifact assemblage from site 41RK12, including a glass
vessel sherd and wire nails, suggests an early-twentieth-century domestic occupation. This historic
site dates to a well-documented period in local and regional history (Glander et al. 1984; Skokan et
al. 1997) and is unlikely to harbor significant data that would merit listing in the NRHP under
Criterion D. The lack of architecture precludes listing under Criterion C. The site also is thought to
lack any associative significance that would qualify it for NRHP listing under Criterion A or B. It is
the opinion of the Principal investigator that site 41RK12 does not warrant NRHP inclusion, and no
further work is recommended.

Site 41RK13 (Revisit)
Background
Site 41RK13 is a previously recorded, diffuse prehistoric lithic scatter located upon a low ridge west
of Martin Lake (TARL records). The landform slopes gently north-northeastward toward the
lakeshore, approximately 75 m distant. The siteâs elevation is approximately 340 ft msl. The original
recorders of the site identified two lithic flakes and a possibly worked hematite cobble. Soils within
the site boundaries consist of Woodtell loam, 5 to 15 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). Soils
encountered during shovel testing consisted of 50 to 80 cm of pale brown sand and sandy loam
over red or strong brown clay subsoil.
The site is located 20 m east of a natural gas well pad and is accessible by traversing open, grassy
terrain from the well pad (Figure 20). The ground surface visibility is entirely obscured by grasses.

Figure 20. Construction of natural gas well pad has impacted
site 41RK13, facing west.

Work Performed
During the current site revisit, a total of nine shovel tests were excavated at 10-m intervals to
define the horizontal and vertical limits of the site. Of these nine tests, only Shovel Test 1 yielded
cultural materials. No cultural material was identified on the surface, and no diagnostic materials
were recovered. The single positive test was buffered to establish a site size of 10 m north-south by
10 m east-west to comprise an area of roughly 79 m2 (Figure 21).

100013883/100196

Liberty Deposit Mine Area

Artifact Assemblage
The artifact assemblage recovered from site 41RK13 consists of three pieces of lithic debitage from
a depth of 0 to 40 cmbs. Raw material in the lithic debitage assemblage includes black and tan chert
and silicified wood. Only one artifact shows signs of thermal alteration.

Discussion and Recommendations

Site 41RK13 is a low density prehistoric lithic scatter represented by three artifacts recovered
during the current revisit. Thermal alteration of one of the lithic specimens suggests that the
prehistoric occupants may have utilized fire on-site to heat-treat lithic raw materials or for
subsistence processing. Based on the presence of a nearby well pad, it is possible that a portion of
the site was negatively impacted by the construction of the well pad and subsequent erosion.

The ephemeral nature of the site suggests it resulted from a short-duration, possibly single-event,
occupation, sometime during the prehistoric period. The absence of carbonized subsistence or fuel
remains, along with the absence of fire-cracked rocks, suggests that cultural features have not been
preserved on-site. These observations suggest that site 41RK13 does not harbor significant data
and does not meet the criteria warranting NRHP inclusion. No further work is recommended.

Site 41RK14 (Revisit)
Background

Site 41RK14 is a previously recorded isolated artifact located upon the east end of a small knoll
50 m north of the Martin Lake shoreline (TARL records). The site was originally recorded as being
located upon the ridge between Dry Creek and Martin Creek prior to the impoundment of Martin
Lake. The siteâs elevation is approximately 270 ft msl. The artifact assemblage recovered when
recorded consisted of only a single prehistoric sherd. Soils mapped within the site boundaries
consist of Woodtell loam, 5 to 15 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). Typical soils encountered during
shovel testing consisted of 60 to 100 cm of yellowish brown sandy loam over strong brown clay
subsoil. Ground surface visibility was entirely obscured by grasses.

Work Performed

According to the original recorders, site 41RK14 encompassed a circular area approximately 100 ft
in diameter, comprising roughly 7,850 ft2 (Figure 22). This dimension was apparently determined
by the size and shape of the landform upon which the site is situated. During the current site revisit,
a total of nine shovel tests were excavated at 10-m intervals in an attempt to relocate and delineate
the siteâs boundaries. No cultural material was recovered from shovel testing or was observed upon
the ground surface.

100013883/100196

164

Liberty Deposit Mine Area

Discussion and Recommendations
Site 41RK14 is a Late Prehistoric site represented by only a single ceramic sherd recovered when
the site was originally recorded. No organic material, diagnostic tools, or cultural features were
discovered during the site revisit. The absence of cultural materials in any of the shovel tests
excavated during the revisit indicates that the site does not harbor significant data resources. For
this reason, it is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that site 41RK14 does not merit NRHP
inclusion, and no further work is recommended.

Site 41RK16 (Revisit)
Background

Site 41RK16 is a previously recorded prehistoric artifact scatter located upon a shoulderslope
overlooking the Martin Creek floodplain (TARL records). The landform slopes gently northward
toward an unnamed drainage to Martin Creek and eastward toward the lakeshore, approximately
130 m distant. The siteâs elevation is approximately 340 ft msl. The original recorders of the site
noted an unknown number of lithic flakes and a single prehistoric ceramic sherd.

Soils mapped within the site boundaries consist of Woodtell loam, 5 to 15 percent slopes and Latex
very fine sandy loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). Soils encountered during shovel testing
consisted of 30 to 60 cm of pale brown sandy loam over red or reddish brown clay subsoil. Clay
soils are much more deeply buried downslope in the southern and western portions of the site.

Vegetation observed during the present investigation included large pines, few small yaupons, and
few sweetgum trees. The entire site surface was obscured by pine needles. Based on the
distribution of positive shovel tests excavated by the initial recorders, the site was estimated to
extend 75 ft by 100 ft and comprise an area of roughly 7,500 ft2 (Figure 23).

Work Performed

During the current site revisit, a total of 18 shovel tests were excavated at 10-m intervals to
determine the vertical and horizontal limits of the site. None of the shovel tests excavated during
the revisit yielded cultural materials, and the site was not expressed on the surface.

Discussion and Recommendations

Based on the recovery of a single prehistoric ceramic sherd during the original recordation, site
41RK16 is a probable Late Prehistoric site. During the current investigations, no cultural materials
were recovered. No carbonized subsistence or fuel remains, diagnostic tools, or other artifacts or
cultural features were discovered during the site revisit. Based on the absence of cultural materials
in any of the shovel tests excavated during the site revisit, the site does not appear to harbor
100013883/100196

166

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
significant data resources. For these reasons, site 41RK16 does not warrant NRHP inclusion, and no
further work is recommended by the Principal Investigator.

Site 41RK26 (Revisit)
Background

Site 41RK26 was originally recorded prior to the impoundment of Martin Lake as a prehistoric
artifact scatter, with a single historic find, occupying two small knolls (one to the east and one to
the west) on a shoulderslope west of and above the Dry or Little Creek floodplain (TARL records).
The site is presently situated just above the shoreline of Martin Lake. A remnant of the western
knoll is now extant; however, no remnant of the eastern knoll was located. The landform slopes
gently southward toward the lakeshore. The siteâs elevation is approximately 305 ft msl. The bed of
an old road, presumably a lake access, crosses the western knoll south to north before heading
north-northwest to connect with FM 2658. A number of push piles were observed along and
adjacent to the old road bed in the vicinity of the site, suggesting probable impact from
earthmoving activities. A concrete abutment is located to the south of the knoll near the waterâs
edge. The abutmentâs location at the waterâs edge suggests rather strongly that it represents a
postimpoundment improvement. During the revisit, the ground surface was entirely obscured by
dense grasses.
The soils on-site are mapped as Sawlit-Sawtown Complex, 0 to 20 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). The
soils encountered while shovel testing during the revisit consisted of 10 to 20 cm of pale brown
sandy loam over reddish brown clay subsoil.

The site was subjected to a surface inspection when originally recorded, which resulted in the
recovery of lithic debitage, a biface, and a historic stoneware sherd. One 1-x-1-m test pit was
excavated on each of the two knolls during that visit and yielded 7 plain prehistoric ceramic sherds,
1 sherd decorated with broad incised lines and crosshatching, 1 Gary projectile point, 1 untyped
petrified wood point, 3 biface fragments, and 97 pieces of lithic debitage. The âWilcox Formationâ
(presumably clay) was encountered at a depth of 85 cmbs in the unit excavated on the western
knoll (McDonald 1972:13) while it was not encountered at all in the eastern knoll by a depth of
110 cmbs.

In response to plans to rework the highway in the vicinity of the western knoll, the Texas Highway
Department conducted a second short field investigation in 1972. The initial test pit dug by Texas
Highway Department archeologist Frank Wier revealed a possible hearth feature. Subsequent
excavations conducted by the Texas Highway Department archeologist Whit Jarvis âwere not
satisfactorily productive and investigations were terminatedâ (McDonald 1972:13). The site was
not recommended for further work.

100013883/100196

168

6. Survey Results

Work Performed
During the current site revisit, a total of 12 shovel tests were excavated (Figure 24) on the landform
thought to represent the western knoll noted when the site was originally recorded. These tests
were excavated at 10-m intervals in a roughly cruciform pattern in an attempt to determine the
vertical and horizontal limits of the site and obtain a representative sample of the artifacts present.
All 12 shovel tests were culturally sterile. No cultural material was identified in a surface context
during the site revisit. No remnant of the eastern knoll mentioned by the original recorders was
identified.

Discussion and Recommendations

The revisit of site 41RK26 failed to recover any cultural materials. The landform upon which the
site was originally recorded appears to have been significantly altered since that time. The western
site knoll reported by McDonald (1972) was relocated and shovel tested. The soil in these shovel
tests was much more shallow than that found in the test pit excavated by McDonald (1972),
suggesting the site has been subject to substantial erosion. The fact that no evidence of the eastern
knoll was identified lends further support to this interpretation.

Considering the construction activities that have occurred since the siteâs initial recordation,
evidenced by push piles and shallow soil, it is likely that the majority of the site area has been
heavily disturbed (Figure 25). Additionally, it is also possible that the site was misplotted by the
original recorders and has since been inundated by Martin Lake.

The absence of cultural materials on-site, along with its apparent destruction, suggests it does not
harbor significant data resources that would warrant NRHP inclusion. For these reasons, no further
work is recommended.

Site 41RK27 (Revisit)
Background

Site 41RK27 was originally recorded as a probable Archaic campsite located on a shoulderslope
bounded by a small brook (TARL records). The site form noted that the site had been terraced for
prior cultivation. The site would have been located on the terrace edge above Dry or Little Creek
prior to the impoundment of Martin Lake. The original site form noted that sandy loam deposits
were eroded down to the underlying Wilcox Formation in many places in the vicinity of the site.
The site is situated entirely in Woodtell loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). The artifact
assemblage recovered during the original field effort included a single chert flake and a Gary
projectile point. No other cultural materials or features were mentioned.

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
The landform described by the original recorders was located during the current field effort. The
elevation of the site area is approximately 350 ft msl at its summit. A small swale was barely
perceivable along the west side of the knoll, which would shed water to the lake to the south. The
original recorders established site boundaries to encompass the entire landform, extending roughly
30 m east to west and 10 m north to south, encompassing about 240 mÂ² (Figure 26). Vegetation
observed in the vicinity of the present investigations includes large plantation pines and a few small
hardwood trees. Surface visibility was nonexistent due to grasses.

Work Performed

During the current site revisit, a total of 14 shovel tests were excavated in an attempt to define the
horizontal and vertical site limits and obtain a representative artifact sample. These tests were
excavated at 10-m intervals in a cruciform pattern along cardinal directions. All shovel tests
excavated during the current field effort were culturally sterile, and the site lacked surface
expression.

Discussion and Recommendations

Site 41RK27 is an ephemeral, probable Late Archaic, site originally recorded during the 1972
Martin Lake survey. The site is represented by one lithic flake and a Gary projectile point recovered
during the original site recording effort. During the current investigations, no cultural materials
were observed or recovered. Due to intensive past cultivation and terracing that has taken place
atop this landform, the site has likely seen significant disturbance. Due to a complete lack of
significant, temporally stratified deposits within the site boundaries, it is the opinion of the
Principal Investigator that this site is ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP, and no further work is
necessary.

Site 41RK29 (Revisit)
Background

Site 41RK29 is a prehistoric lithic scatter originally located during the 1972 Martin Lake survey
(TARL records). The site was originally described as being situated on the west bank of a dry creek
that had been dammed to form a stock pond. The site was described as being located west of the
head of Cherry Slough and north of Dry Creek near its confluence with Martin Creek. Currently,
those water courses have been inundated by the impoundment of Martin Lake.

The site is situated at an approximate elevation of 315 ft msl. The property is currently in use as a
pine timber plantation; the vegetation is primarily pine with random patches of briars and stunted
hardwood underbrush. Pine duff completely obscured the ground surface across the site area. The
Martin Lake shoreline is located 45 m to the east. The soil at the site is mapped as Woodtell loam, 5
100013883/100196

172

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
to 15 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). Shovel testing revealed yellowish brown fine sand over red
sandy clay. The site has been disturbed by logging and the construction of a nearby pipeline.

According to the original recorders, site 41RK29 consisted of a surficial lithic scatter of flakes and
bipolar cores. Artifact counts and raw materials types, however, were not documented on the
original site form.

Work Performed

During the current field effort, the site was relocated by shovel testing the landform described by
the original recorders. A total of 13 shovel test were excavated to determine the horizontal and
vertical extent of the site. Two shovel tests were culturally positive, each yielding a single piece of
lithic debitage within the first 20 cmbs. Based on the location of the two positive shovel tests
excavated during the current field effort, the site is 30 m east to west by 10 m north to south and
covers about 300 mÂ² (Figure 27).

Artifact Assemblage

The artifact assemblage recovered from site 41RK29 during its original recordation consisted of an
undocumented number of lithic flakes and bipolar cores. The current field effort yielded two pieces
of lithic debitage from the upper 20 cm from two different shovel tests. One of the lithic artifacts is a
white chert tertiary flake, while the other is a dark yellow secondary flake. No ceramic materials,
other diagnostic artifacts, or cultural features were found during the initial site recording or during
the current site revisit.

Discussion and Recommendation

Site 41RK29 is a prehistoric lithic scatter originally recorded during the 1972 Martin Lake survey.
The site was originally represented by a sparse scatter of lithic flaking debris and bipolar cores.
Although intensive shovel testing was conducted during the current site revisit, no carbonized
subsistence or fuel remains, diagnostic artifacts, burned rocks, or cultural features were recovered.
These findings indicate that site 41RK29 lacks significant data resources that warrant NRHP
inclusion. For these reasons, it is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that this site is ineligible
for inclusion in the NRHP, and no further work is necessary.

Site 41RK32 (Revisit â Excluded from Permit Area)
Background

Site 41RK32 is a previously recorded Late Caddo site located on the saddle of an eroded ridge
projecting onto the Martin Creek floodplain. The ridge is now a peninsula extending eastward into
Martin Lake (Figure 28). The landform is bounded on the south by an unnamed tributary to Martin

Creek. The siteâs elevation is approximately 335 ft msl. The soil on-site is mapped as Woodtell loam,
5 to 15 percent slopes (NRCS 2011). Soils encountered during shovel testing consisted of 50 to 80
cm of pale brown sandy loam over red or strong brown clay subsoil. Ground surface visibility was
partially obscured by pine duff upon the higher elevations and by grasses in the central portion of
the site. Some surface visibility was afforded by a two-track road running through the site.

The original site form filed for the site included information regarding the initial discovery of the
site during survey in 1972. No updated site form was found on the THC Sites Atlas. The site form
indicated that the survey level effort resulted in the recovery of two decorated ceramic sherds and a
single fragment of burned bone. TARL, however, houses substantially more information concerning
previous work undertaken at the site. NRHP test excavations were conducted at the site
immediately following the survey. Hand and mechanical excavation were used to sample the site.

This work resulted in the identification of numerous features including four refuse pits and three
post molds. A total of 289 ceramic sherds, 11 arrow points or arrow point fragments, 1 dart point,
197 pieces of lithic debitage, and a number of cores and tool fragments were recovered during the
excavation of four 5-x-5-ft test pits. A small amount of faunal remains was recovered from the site,
with the highest concentrations coming from a post mold and a pit. Most of the bone material was
unidentifiable but 16 fragments of deer bone, a turtle carapace fragment, and a pig tooth were
identified. Recovery of many decorated ceramic sherds associated the site to the Late Caddo period.
With the close of this field effort, site 41RK32 was seen as having been mitigated for impacts
anticipated by the impoundment of Martin Lake.

Work Performed

During the current site revisit, a total of 19 shovel tests were excavated at 15-m intervals to
determine the horizontal and vertical limits of the site and obtain a representative sample of the
artifacts present. Six of the shovel tests yielded cultural materials. All of the positive shovel tests
were located within the saddle situated between eroded, rocky outcrops located southeast and
northwest along the ridge.
Based upon the distribution of positive shovel tests, the siteâs size was estimated to be 20 m northsouth by 60 m east-west, comprising an area of roughly 1,250 m2 (Figure 29). While the original
recorders described some surface finds, the site was not expressed on the ground surface at the
time of the recent revisit. A single metaquartzite Colbert arrow point was recovered from the
eastern portion of the saddle at a depth of 20â30 cm.

Artifact Assemblage

A total of 10 prehistoric artifacts were recovered from site 41RK32 during the revisit. The
assemblage consists of a chipped lithic tool (n = 1), unmodified lithic debitage (n = 2), prehistoric
ceramics (n = 6), and unidentified faunal remains (n = 1).
100013883/100196

177

6. Survey Results
The chipped stone tool (Lot 1.4) is a nearly complete Colbert arrow point that was formed from a
weak red metaquartzite and is missing a portion of its basal edge. The extant body is triangular
with recurved lateral edges. It is moderately barbed with an expanding stem and exhibits no
evidence of thermal alteration. It has a mass of 1.09 g and extends 21.55 mm in length by 16.82 mm
in width, with a maximum thickness of 3.86 mm. Colbert arrow points emerged during the Late
Prehistoric (Turner and Hester 1985) and date roughly to A.D. 950 to 1585.
A total of two pieces of unmodified lithic debitage were recovered from site 41RK32. One specimen
is a complete chert flake, while the other is a chert flake fragment that exhibits signs of
unintentional heat alteration.

Six prehistoric ceramic sherds were recovered from five shovel tests (ST 3, ST 9, ST 13, ST 14, and
ST 15). During initial examination, one small sherdlet measuring less than 1 cm in diameter was
eliminated from further analysis, thereby reducing the number of analyzed sherds to five. Analysis
of their technological attributes indicates the presence of five different vessels.

The sample consisted of three plain body sherds, one decorated body sherd, and one undecorated
rim fragment (Table 9). Microscopic examination indicates that the paste fabric of all five sherds
began with a silty to very fine sandy clay to which grog (n = 4) or bone (n = 1) temper had been
added. The heavy percentage of grog-tempered wares matches that noted for sherds recovered
during testing at the site in the 1970s (Doran n.d.).

Although the surfaces are weathered, remnants of two types of surface treatment were identified,
dry smoothing and floating. None of the sherds had been burnished; however, the one decorated
sherd exhibited portions of a design motif that included a series of widely spaced diagonal lines.
The sherds ranged in thickness from 5.1 to 8.9 mm. Configuration of the firing core indicates that
four sherds were low-fired or incompletely oxidized either because the firing temperature was too
low, the maximum temperature was not sustained long enough, the firing atmosphere was only
partially oxidizing, or some combination of all of these factors (Teltser 1993). This firing pattern
was the most common pattern observed on the sherds recovered during earlier testing at the site
(Doran n.d.). The rim fragment differed in that it had been fired in a reduced or low-oxygen
environment.
The presence of lithic a tool and debitage suggests tool manufacture or maintenance took place onsite. The presence of the Colbert arrow point suggests the site was occupied at least once during the
Late Prehistoric period. The production range for Colbert arrow points overlaps with the Alba and
Perdiz points recovered during NRHP testing of the site in 1972.
None of the sherds recovered during the current field effort are typologically distinct, and all lack
diagnostic attributes that would allow a temporal assignment. However, their overall
characteristics are typical of Caddo ceramics found at 41RK32 during the 1972 testing and at sites
throughout the region.

Discussion and Recommendations
The cultural features identified at site 41RK32 during testing efforts in 1972 demonstrate that the
site had, at the time, maintained depositional integrity. The recovery of decorated ceramics and
contemporaneous arrow points indicated a Late Caddo occupation. Since testing and the
impoundment of Martin Lake, wave action has resulted in some erosion to the site around its
periphery. However, the remainder of the site within the saddle above the maximum pool elevation
appears to have escaped impact from wave action. Shovel testing during the recent revisit showed
the relatively intact portion of the site to encompass an area of 1,250 m2.

The artifact assemblage recovered during the present investigation, along with the testing
assemblage, indicates a Late Caddo occupation. The Carrollton dart point recovered during the
testing also suggests an earlier Middle Archaic occupation. However, the possibility that this artifact
was curated and reused by the siteâs Late Prehistoric occupants cannot be excluded. The presence
of a carbonized bone in the shovel testing assemblage suggests that some organic preservation has
been maintained. Due to the siteâs topographic setting, the site may have aggraded as a result of
colluvial deposition since its prehistoric abandonment. If this is the case, site 41RK32 may have
maintained a relatively high degree of depositional integrity. This site represents one of the few
Late Prehistoric occupations within the Liberty Deposit Mine Area and likely the best preserved.
However, due to the siteâs location beyond the current limits of the permit area, mine-related
impacts are not anticipated. Presently, insufficient work has been completed to determine whether
significant deposits are still present. If avoidance by mine-related activity is not feasible, NRHP
eligibility testing is recommended.

Site 41RK34 (Revisit)
Background

According to records on file at TARL, site 41RK34 is a historic domestic site originally located
during the 1972 Martin Lake survey. The original investigation recorded the site on a gentle
northeast-facing footslope above Martin Lake (Dry Creek prior to impoundment) at an approximate
elevation of 390 ft msl. The soils on-site are mapped as Woodtell loam, 5 to 15 percent slopes
(NRCS 2010). The soils encountered during shovel testing consisted of brown sandy loam over
reddish brown sandy clay subsoil. The site was relocated based on its surface expression including
structural debris, a well, a light artifact scatter, and a possible access road.
The original investigation at the site identified two main structures and several additional
structures, a single well, and a scatter of historic debris. One of the main structures, identified as
Structure A, consisted of a brick fireplace with a ferruginous sandstone foundation. The second
main structure, identified as Structure B, had a sandstone foundation. Only the southernmost
portion of the site, located near the previously recorded location of Structure A, was revisited
during the current investigation due to access limitations. The materials observed on the surface
100013883/100196

181

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
during the current investigation include a concrete well, two possible sandstone pier stones, and a
single brick.
Based upon surface expression and positive shovel tests, site 41RK34 extends roughly 25 m east to
west by 45 m north to south. The site covers an area of roughly 1,125 m2 (Figure 30). A fence runs
north to south near the western boundary of the site. The site is densely wooded with stunted
upland hardwoods and briars. The ground surface was entirely obscured within the site boundaries
by a dense understory and hardwood leaf litter. Numerous tree stumps within the site vicinity
indicate that the area was once cleared; however, the hardwoods and briars have completely
reclaimed the site area.

Work Performed

The site is associated with an HHPA that was discerned on an aerial photograph dating to 1935. The
site is not depicted on the 1958 USGS Minden 15-minute topographic quadrangle. A total of 11
shovel tests were excavated at roughly 15-m intervals in a cruciform pattern along cardinal
directions to determine the horizontal and vertical limits of the cultural deposits. Of the 11 shovel
tests excavated, 2 were culturally positive, yielding a total of 33 artifacts.

Artifact Assemblage

The artifact assemblage consists of 30 shards of glass and 3 ceramic sherds, recovered from the
upper 30 cm from two different shovel tests. Shovel Test 3 was by far the most productive and
yielded all of the recovered subsurface artifacts except for a single glass shard.

The ceramic assemblage includes two stoneware sherds with a Bristol-like glaze on the exterior and
an Albany slip-like glaze on the interior and one porcelain sherd with a hand-painted green and
white design.

The glass assemblage includes 21 shards of aqua-tinted flat window glass, 1 colorless embossed
bottle shard, 1 colorless molded bottle shard, 1 molded aquamarine shard from a panel bottle with
bubble inclusions, 3 colorless bottle shards, 1 aqua-tint vessel shard, 1 solarized colorless vessel
shard with bubble inclusions, and 1 shard from an amber snuff jar with a mold seam.
The bubble-included glass dates between 1880 to 1920 (Polak 2000), while solarized glass dates
from 1880 to 1918 (Stelle 2010). Though Bristol glaze alone is not temporally sensitive, when
paired with an Albany slip or slip glaze variety, it generally predates 1920 (Greer 1981).

A surface inspection of the site identified a well, manufactured bricks, and three cut foundation
stones. The well is constructed of concrete rings, each 4 ft across and 3 ft tall. The current depth of
the well is 8 ft and it is partially filled in. Two fragmented, red, manufactured bricks, along with the
foundation stones, were located in the center of the site. A linear depression located in the southern
portion of the site may have served as an access road to the original structure.

Archival Research
Archival research indicates that the site may have been associated with the use or occupation of the
property by an African American farmer named John Humphrey or his tenants. Humphrey owned
the property including the site from 1891 through his death in 1938. His heirs retained the
property through the end of the historic period.

Despite the siteâs association with an African American property owner, the site does not have the
potential to provide additional information to the historical record. As a result, additional research
is not recommended in connection with the current project. The individuals associated with these
sites have no known historical associations, and they are not recommended for NRHP listing.

Discussion and Recommendations

Site 41RK34 represents the remains of a historic residence, based on the presence of the well, the
foundation stones, and artifact scatter. No extant structures are within the site boundaries. The
assemblage of artifacts recovered on-site suggests a late-nineteenth- to early-twentieth-century
occupation.

This site dates to a well-documented period in local and regional history (Glander et al. 1984;
Skokan et al. 1997) and is unlikely to qualify for NRHP listing under Criterion D. The site lacks any
standing structures that could qualify it for NRHP listing under Criterion C. The site also lacks any
known associative significance that would qualify it for NRHP listing under Criterion A or B. Site
41RK34 does not appear to warrant NRHP inclusion, and no further work is recommended.

Site 41RK35 (Revisit â Excluded from Permit Area)
Background

Site 41RK35 is a multicomponent artifact scatter originally located during the 1972 Martin Lake
survey. The original investigation recorded the site on a shoulderslope in a cultivated field at an
elevation of 430 ft msl. A residence was observed sitting on the top of a knoll, surrounded by an
ashy midden. The site was estimated to encompass a circular area approximately 100 to 150 ft in
diameter. At that time, site 41RK35 underwent a minor testing program that resulted in the
recovery of seven chert flakes, decorated and plain historic ceramics, and historic glass shards. The
midden was reported to be buried below a foot of sandy loam.

During the present survey, the property containing the site was in use as an exotic game ranch with
two modern houses and several small outlying structures along FM 1251, which forms the southern
boundary of the site. Additions to the landscape at the site area since the original recordation
include the clearing of the original residence and the construction of a modern home and
maintained yard. The site is primarily in pasture and vegetated with grasses, with hickory and
sycamore trees bordering the pasture. The soil at the site is mapped as Latex very fine sandy loam,
100013883/100196

184

6. Survey Results
1 to 3 percent slopes and Laneville, frequently flooded (NRCS 2010). Shovel testing revealed weak
red fine sandy loam over red sandy loam above a strong brown clay subsoil. The site area has been
terraced, most likely as an erosion-control method, and appears to have been heavily disturbed.

Work Performed

During the current investigation, the site was relocated by shovel testing the landform described on
the original site form on file at TARL. A total of 82 shovel test were excavated to determine the
horizontal and vertical extent of the site. Of the 82 shovel tests excavated, 29 were culturally
positive. Nine (7, 20, 26, 27, 28, 31, 45, 77 and 82) yielded historic artifacts, while 7 (1, 2, 30, 32, 33,
74 and 79) yielded prehistoric artifacts, and 10 yielded both historic and prehistoric artifacts (11,
16, 22, 24, 25, 29, 42, 43, 50 and 62). Two charcoal fragments and one fragment of burned clay
were also recovered from two shovel tests (43 and 50) from levels 1 and 3. Based on the
distribution of positive shovel tests, the site extends 400 m east to west by 105 m north to south
and covers approximately 42,000 mÂ² (Figure 31). The occupied modern residence and associated
lawn are located near the center of the site; this portion of the site was not shovel tested.

Artifact Assemblage

A total of 162 artifacts were recovered from 41RK35. The historic assemblage contains 115
artifacts, including ceramic, glass, brick, and metal specimens (Table 10). The prehistoric
assemblage is composed of 42 pieces of lithic debitage, 1 core, and 1 ceramic sherd (Table 11). The
unknown assemblage numbers 3.

Seven ironstone sherds were recovered including one flow blue decorated sherd, two green and
white transfer-printed sherds, one black and white transfer-printed sherd, one red and white
banded sherd, one decalcomania sherd, and one undecorated sherd. None of the decorated sherds
were temporally diagnostic.

Sixty-nine glass shards were recovered. The glass assemblage is composed of bottle, jar, snuff jar,
vessel, jar lid liner, chimney lamp, and window shards. The bottle assemblage contains 10
specimens and includes 1 aqua-tint shard that is embossed and has a makerâs mark, 4 amber glass
shards, 4 amber glass shards with bubble inclusions, and 1 colorless shard with bubble inclusions.
The single jar shard is cobalt and threaded. There are 2 snuff jar shards with bubble inclusions.
There are 41 vessel glass shards, including, 1 amber shard, 1 aqua shard with bubble inclusions, 5
aqua-tint shards, 2 aqua-tint shards with bubble inclusions, 1 green-tint shard, 1 green-tint shard
with bubble inclusions, 11 colorless shards, 9 colorless shards with bubble inclusions, 6 solarized
shards, and 4 solarized shards with bubble inclusions. One opaline jar lid liner, 1 colorless chimney
lamp glass shard, 1 cobalt jar shard, and 13 colorless window glass shards were also recovered.
The brick artifacts recovered consist of six machine-made brick fragments.

The metal assemblage consists of 33 specimens including 1 lead .22 shot, 22 iron wire nails, 1 iron
wire tack, 1 iron and brass clothing snap, 1 wire fragment, 6 unidentified iron objects, and 1
unidentified zinc object.

Most of the historic artifacts are consistent with a late-nineteenth- to early-twentieth-century
occupation. The majority of the temporally diagnostic artifacts recovered at the site were glass.
Glass with bubble inclusions predates 1920 (Polak 2000); solarized glass dates between 1880 and
1918 (Stelle 2010); glass with suction scars from the Owens Bottle Machine postdate 1905 (SHA
2010), and jar lid liners postdate 1867 (Toulouse 1971). One glass bottle with a makerâs mark for
the Owens Illinois Glass Company dates between 1929 and 1954. Wire nails replaced cut nails
during the last decade of the nineteenth century (Adams 2002).
The prehistoric artifact assemblage is composed of 42 pieces of lithic debitage, 1 core, and 1
ceramic sherd. The debitage assemblage includes 6 chert secondary flakes, 2 chert secondary flakes
that are thermally altered, 1 silicified wood secondary flake, 11 chert tertiary flakes, 8 chert tertiary
flakes that are thermally altered, 1 metaquartzite tertiary flake, 6 metaquartzite flakes that are
thermally altered, 2 silicified wood tertiary flakes, 3 silicified wood tertiary flakes that are
thermally altered, and 2 hematite tertiary flakes. The core is silicified wood and is thermally
altered. The single sherd is a grog-tempered body sherdlet.

Archival Research

No archival investigations were performed on this site as it has been excluded from the permit area.
If the permit boundary is expanded to include this area, appropriate archival investigations are
recommended to determine any significant historic associations.

Discussion and Recommendation

Site 41RK35 is a multicomponent historic/prehistoric artifact scatter. No artifact concentrations,
features, or evidence of the midden area described on the site form were identified. The standing
structure recorded during the original site recordation is apparently no longer extant. No historicage standing structures were identified within the site boundaries during the current survey effort.
The site also appears to have been disturbed to an unknown extent by terracing.
The prehistoric component is fairly dense and probably represents one of the more intensively
utilized prehistoric sites identified during the present survey. The presence of both burned clay and
charcoal in the shovel testing assemblage suggests that prehistoric cultural features may be present
on-site. The recovery of an undecorated prehistoric ceramic sherd suggests that the site was
occupied during the Late Prehistoric period. For these reasons, insufficient data were recovered
from the prehistoric component to determine whether it harbors significant data resources that
warrant listing on the NRHP. It is recommended that mine-related impacts to this site be avoided. If
this is not possible NRHP eligibility testing is recommended.

6. Survey Results
The yard of the occupied modern structure was not shovel tested. It is recommended that impacts
to this area be avoided. If this is not possible, it is recommended that the yard be shovel tested to
determine whether significant data resources are present.

The historic component dates to a well-documented period in local and regional history (Glander et
al. 1984; Skokan et al. 1997) and is unlikely to harbor significant data resources that could warrant
NRHP listing under Criteria D. However, it remains unknown whether or not the site has any
associative significance that could qualify it for NRHP listing under Criterion A or B. For this
reasons, it is recommended that mine-related impact to this site be avoided. Site 41RK35 has been
excluded from the permit area and Luminant intends to avoid it. If this is not possible due to future
changes to the permit boundary, it is recommended that additional archival research be conducted
to determine whether the site possesses any associative significance.

Site 41RK187 (Revisit â Excluded from Permit Area)
Background

Site 41RK187 is a previously recorded prehistoric lithic and ceramic scatter located upon a low rise
on a toeslope 90 m north of Martin Lake. The toe is surrounded to the east, north, and west by
swampy lowland. Dorsett Creek Slough is located to the southeast and south of the site and forms
its southern boundary. The siteâs elevation is approximately 310 ft msl. The soil on-site is mapped
as Laneville loam, frequently flooded (NRCS 2010). Soils encountered during shovel testing
consisted of 50 to 80 cm of pale brown sandy loam over red or strong brown clay subsoil. Ground
surface visibility was partially obscured by hardwood leaf litter within the southern portion of the
site and grasses in the northern portion.
No site form was filed by the siteâs original recorder, Jack Hughes. A review of the THC Sites Atlas
yielded little information about the site, and only a point plot of the site location was found on TARL
maps. TARL does have an artifact list describing the materials Hughes recovered during his January
1940 recording of the site. These materials included three plain and one engraved prehistoric
ceramic sherds.

Work Performed

During the current site revisit, a total of 37 shovel tests were excavated at 10-m intervals to
determine the horizontal and vertical limits of the site and obtain a representative sample of the
artifacts present. Ten of the shovel tests yielded cultural materials. All of the positive shovel tests
were located upon the low rise above the swampy areas. Based upon the distribution of positive
shovel tests, the siteâs size was estimated to be 40 m north-south by 90 m east-west, comprising an
area of roughly 3,600 m2 (Figure 32). The site was not expressed upon the ground surface. A single
metaquartzite projectile point was recovered from the middle portion of the ridge at a depth of 40â
50 cm.

6. Survey Results

Artifact Assemblage
The artifact assemblage recovered from site 41RK187 consists of 2 Gary dart points, 1 biface
fragment, 27 pieces of nondiagnostic lithic debitage, 1 fragment of burned clay, and 2 ceramic
sherds.

Gary dart points emerged during the Middle Archaic (Turner and Hester 1985) and remained in use
in East Texas through the Woodland/Early Ceramic period. Lot 7.1 is a reworked Gary dart point
manufactured from chert and exhibiting signs of intentional heat treatment. The body is triangular
with recurved lateral edges, distinct shoulders, and a contracting stem. The shoulders are
somewhat asymmetrical, and one is more prominent than the other. There are no signs of
utilization as the material is corticated and of very poor quality. Its mass is 6.23 grams (g), and it is
36.56 millimeters (mm) in length by 32.40 mm in width with a maximum thickness of 8.95 mm.
Lot 19 is a Gary dart point fragment consisting of the stem and one indistinct shoulder, and a
contracting stem. The material is thermally altered chert, and the artifact does not exhibit
utilization wear, suggesting abandonment upon failure during manufacturing. Its mass is 1.94 g,
and it is 35.83 mm in length by 16.96 mm in width with a maximum thickness of 7.35 mm.

Lot 7.2 represents the pointed distal tip of a biface exhibiting straight lateral edges. The material is
thermally altered, corticated silicified wood with evidence of a snap fracture along the plane of a
material flaw and displaying no evidence of utilization, suggesting abandonment upon failure
during manufacturing. Its mass is 3.29 g, and it is 19.97 mm in length by 18.84 mm in width with a
maximum thickness of 6.16 mm.

The assemblage of nontool lithic artifacts consists of 27 pieces of unmodified debitage. Raw
material types represented include chert, hematite, hematitic sandstone, metaquartzite, quartz
arenite, and silicified wood. Chert is the predominant lithic material type, and thermal alteration is
evident on 36 percent (n = 10) of all lithic debitage. The 27 pieces of unmodified debitage were
categorized by reduction stage into primary, secondary, and tertiary flakes, and then further
subdivided by morphology into complete flakes, proximal fragments, distal fragments, and debris.
The nontool assemblage includes primary flakes (11.1 percent), secondary flakes (29.5 percent),
and tertiary flakes (59.5 percent).
One reddish yellow burned clay nodule with a mass of 1.36 g was recovered from the site. It is
composed of a very fine sandy clay.
Four ceramic sherds were recovered from two shovel tests (shovel tests 24 and 35). During initial
examination, it was determined that three of the sherds fit together, thereby reducing the number
of sherds to two. Analysis of their technological attributes indicates the presence of two different
vessels.

100013883/100196

193

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
The three sherds, recovered from levels 5 and 6 of Shovel Test 24 were conjoining fragments of a
rim (Lot 6.5). The fresh breaks suggest that the rim fragment was probably resting at the interface
between levels 5 and 6 and was broken during excavation. It has a very fine sandy paste to which
bone, grog, and crushed hematite had been added. Its paste texture appeared laminated in cross
section. Both the interior and exterior surfaces had been floated. Although the body of the rim was
undecorated, parallel tick marks had been cut into the lip edge. The rim measures 7.1 mm in
thickness and had been fired under partially reducing conditions.
The undecorated body sherd (Lot 18) recovered from Level 5 of Shovel Test 35 was relatively thick,
measuring 8.5 mm in thickness. It has a silty paste to which bone, grog, and crushed hematite had
been added, and its paste appears laminated in cross section. Its exterior and interior surfaces had
been floated. It had been fired under partially reducing conditions.

Neither sherd was typologically distinct; however, based on their overall technological attributes,
both sherds closely resemble the Woodland period ceramics common to Mill Creek cultural
assemblages (Perttula 2001; Perttula and Nelson 2004).

Discussion and Recommendations

The two ceramic sherds recovered during the present investigation, along with the three sherds
recovered when the site was originally recorded, indicate a Late Prehistoric occupation. The Gary
dart points may indicate an earlier Middle to Transitional Archaic/Woodland occupation. It is also
possible that this artifact was curated and reused by the siteâs Late Prehistoric occupants. The
absence of fire-cracked rocks or carbonized subsistence or fuel remains in the shovel testing
assemblage may suggest that cultural features may not have been preserved on-site. However, the
presence of a single fragment of burned clay may indicate otherwise. Due to the siteâs topographic
setting, the site may have aggraded as a result of alluvial deposition since its prehistoric
abandonment. If this is the case, this site may have maintained a relatively high degree of
depositional integrity. This site represents one of the few Late Prehistoric occupations within the
Liberty Deposit Mine Area. Presently, insufficient work has been completed to determine whether
significant deposits are present. It is recommended that mine-related impacts to this site be
avoided. If this is not feasible, NRHP eligibility testing is recommended.

Site 41RK609
Background

Site 41RK609 is a newly recorded historic house site consisting of a surface scatter of structural
debris, a partially collapsed historic-aged residence, and a collapsed freestanding garage. The
residence is situated on a level ridge summit at an elevation of 360 ft msl. Soils within the site
boundaries consist of Kirvin gravely, fine sandy loam, 2 to 5 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). Soils
encountered during shovel testing consisted of brown sandy loam over reddish brown sandy clay.
100013883/100196

194

6. Survey Results
Based upon surface expression, distribution of structural debris, and collapsed structures, site
41RK609 extends roughly 45 m east to west by 60 m north to south. The amorphously shaped site
covers an area of roughly 2,700 m2 (Figure 33). A power line corridor runs east to west along the
northern boundary of the site. The site is densely wooded with stunted upland hardwoods and
briars. Both of the structures are choked by the dense, viney underbrush. The ground surface is
entirely obscured within the site boundaries due to a dense understory and hardwood leaf litter.
Just to the north of the power line corridor is CR 236. The area between CR 236 and the site was
strewn with recently dumped construction debris including a pile of sheetrock.

Work Performed

Site 41RK609 is associated with an HHPA identified on the 1958 USGS 15-minute Minden
topographic quadrangle, which depicts a structure at this location. The site is also associated with
an HHPA discerned on a 1935 aerial photograph. A total of seven shovel tests were excavated at
roughly 20-m intervals in a cruciform pattern to determine the horizontal and vertical extents of
the cultural deposits. All tests were culturally sterile.

Artifact Assemblage

While no artifacts were recovered from a subsurface context, diagnostic structural components
were observed. Diagnostic elements within the collapsed house remains included asphalt roof
shingles, modern electrification components, and a single large pane of fixed window glass at the
front of the house. More modern debris was found on the surface of the site nearest the county
road, signifying use of the area as a recent dump.

Standing Historic Structures

Two structures are currently located at this site: a partially collapsed dwelling (A) and a woodframed barn (B). Structure A is the structural remnants of a circa 1930 wood-framed, single-family
dwelling (Figure 34). Due to the structureâs partial collapse, its original form, plan, and design are
no longer apparent. It appears to have had a gabled roof clad in composite shingles and 1/1 woodframed windows, although neither are intact. The extant exterior faÃ§ades are clad in beveled
wooden siding. Structure B is a circa 1930 barn with a gabled roof (Figure 35). This structure is also
partially collapsed and is missing large portions of its external walls. Thus, its original form and
plan are no longer apparent. In their abandoned and dilapidated states, both structures lack
integrity of design, materials, workmanship, and feeling. The area surrounding the structures is
heavily overgrown, and as such, the historic setting is no longer apparent. The house may maintain
associations with the Barr family, early African American residents of the former community of
Liberty or Chapel Hill; however, it does not date from their original occupation in the area nor does
it appear to maintain associations with African American settlement or history in the region. As a
result, the site is not recommended for NRHP inclusion under Criteria A, B, or C.

Archival Research
Archival research indicates that there is a gap in the Luminant-provided chain of title records from
1856 until 1892 when Aus Barr bought the property from J.C. Hickey and John M. Mays. Barr and
his family were associated with this tract through the 1980s. Barr, an African American farmer,
owned another tract of land in the project area (site 41RK649), and may have resided on that or
another tract. There were no subsurface archeological deposits located at this site, and the
structures present suggest occupation may have occurred circa 1930 and later. This would
correspond to the Pollard familyâs (Barrâs daughter and son-in-law) ownership of the site, and could
indicate they were living on the property. Although this site is associated with African American
property owners in this region, additional archival research is unlikely to provide additional
specific information about the history of this site. As a result, this site is recommended not eligible
under Criterion A or B.

Discussion and Recommendations

Site 41RK609 is a historic homestead site with a circa 1930 collapsed residential structure and a
collapsed freestanding garage. No standing structures were found within the site boundaries. The
site component dates to a well-documented period in local and regional history (Glander et al.
1984; Skokan et al. 1997) and has no known associative significance that would qualify it for NRHP
listing under Criterion A or B. The extant structures lack integrity and distinction and do not merit
listing on the NRHP under Criterion C. For these reasons, it is the opinion of the Principal

Investigator that site 41RK609 is ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and that no further work is
necessary.

Site 41RK610
Background

Site 41RK610 is a newly recorded historic residence consisting of a surface and subsurface scatter
of historic-aged domestic debris. The site is situated upon a level shoulderslope at an approximate
elevation of 390 ft msl. Soils within the site boundaries consist of Latex very fine sandy loam, 1 to
3 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). Soils encountered during shovel testing consisted of 50 to 70 cm of
brown sandy loam over reddish brown sandy clay. A partially overgrown two-track roadway
crosses the site north to south. The majority of the site is situated in a young plantation pine forest.

Based upon the horizontal distribution of surface and subsurface finds, site 41RK610 is irregularly
shaped and extends roughly 100 m north to south by 110 m east to west, sparsely covering an area
of about 11,000 m2 (Figure 36). The ground surface is entirely obscured within the site boundaries
due to the presence of grasses to the south and pine duff. Areas along a two-track roadway that
crosses the site from north to south showed slightly better surface visibility than the more-wooded
portions of the site.

Work Performed

Site 41RK610 is associated with an HHPA discerned on an aerial photograph dating to 1935. A total
of 17 shovel tests were excavated at roughly 20-m intervals following cardinal directions to
determine the horizontal and vertical limits of the cultural deposits. Of these tests, four (1, 6, 8, and
11) were culturally positive. Shovel Test 1 yielded five artifacts, Shovel Test 6 yielded two artifacts,
Shovel Test 8 yielded one artifact, and Shovel Test 11 yielded one artifact. Six artifacts were
recovered from Level 1 (0 to 10 cmbs), three were recovered from Level 2 (10 to 20 cmbs), and
seven were recovered from the surface.

Artifact Assemblage

The artifact assemblage recovered from site 41RK610 consists entirely of historic domestic debris.
A total of 16 artifacts were recovered through shovel testing and surface collection and include 5
ceramic sherds, 10 glass shards, and 1 iron wire nail fragment.
The five ceramic sherds, all of which are ironstone, were recovered from the ground surface. One
sherd is undecorated, while the other four are molded and likely from the same vessel as they have
the same molded lines at the rim.

100013883/100196

6. Survey Results
Of the 10 pieces of glass recovered, 2 were from a surface context while the remaining 8 were
recovered from shovel tests. The glass assemblage includes 3 colorless vessel glass shards, 2
colorless vessel shards with bubble inclusions, 1 aqua-tinted vessel glass shard with bubble
inclusions, 1 solarized glass shard with bubble inclusions, 1 amber snuff jar shard with bubble
inclusions, 1 colorless window glass shard, and a swirled opaline and amber doorknob.

Most of the artifacts recovered are consistent with an early- to mid-twentieth-century occupation.
Temporally diagnostic artifacts at the site include the solarized glass, which generally dates
between 1880 and 1918 (Stelle 2010), and the glass with air bubble inclusions, which predates
1920 (Polak 2000). Snuff bottles were most common during the period from the late nineteenth
century through the mid-twentieth century (antiquebottles.com 2007).

Archival Research

Although a structure appears at this location on the 1935 aerial photograph, it is no longer present
on the 1958 USGS Minden 15-minute topographic quadrangle, and no structures are currently
located at this site. Archival research reveals that the tract of land associated with this site was
originally part of Mark Stroudâs lands, and possibly part of his plantation holdings. Stroudâs
association with the land does not correlate with the artifact assemblage, which indicates an earlytwentieth-century occupation date. However, Stroudâs association with the property and his
probable slave-owner status tie into the subsequent ownership (1905â1923) of the property by
Wesley Menefee, an African American farmer, and his family (1923â1946). Although further
archival research would be necessary to directly connect Stroud and Menefee, it is possible that
Menefee was a former slave who was able to eventually purchase this property after Emancipation.
Research suggests he may have lived elsewhere, but that other members of his family or tenants
could be associated with site 41RK610. Despite this siteâs associations with African American
property owners in this region, additional archival research is unlikely to provide additional
specific information about the history of this site. As a result, this site is recommended not eligible
under Criterion A or B.

Discussion and Recommendations

Site 41RK610 is a historic-age residence containing no standing structures or structural remnants.
The site consists of a surface and subsurface scatter of historic-age domestic debris that includes
diagnostic ceramics and glass. The historic artifact assemblage from site 41RK610, including glass
with bubbles and ironstone ceramics, suggests an early-twentieth-century domestic occupation.
The site dates to a well-documented period in local and regional history (Glander et al. 1984;
Skokan et al. 1997) and has no known associative significance that would qualify it for NRHP listing
under Criterion A or B. It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that site 41RK610 is ineligible
for inclusion in the NRHP, and no further work is recommended.

Site 41RK611
Background
Site 41RK611 is a historic-aged store with three associated outbuildings located on level terrain
(Figure 37). The site is situated on a shoulderslope at an elevation of approximately 370 ft msl. The
nearest source of water is a man-made pond at the head of an unnamed drainage roughly 40 m to
the west-southwest. Vegetation at the site consists of pines, sweetgums, and green briar. Two
varieties of domestic roses were also observed, including pink roses near the shop and white roses
adjacent to the northernmost outbuilding along CR 391. Ground surface visibility was poor across
the site due to the presence of leaf litter, pine duff, and very dense rose bushes. Soils mapped within
the boundaries of the site consist of Sawlit loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). Shovel testing
revealed brown sandy loam over strong brown clay.

Figure 37. Store and associated outbuildings at site 41RK611 located
at the southwest corner of FM 2658 and CR 326, facing southwest.
Based upon the horizontal distribution of standing structures, structural remnants, and subsurface
materials, site 41RK611 extends 110 m north-south by 140 m east-west. The site encompasses an
area of roughly 15,400 m2 (Figure 38). The store is located along the FM 2658 frontage near its
intersection with CR 391. The store building seems to have been constructed in three phases, with
additions added to the north, then south of the original structure. There is a portico or covered
drive-through on the east side of the store on the FM 2658 frontage. A storage barn constructed of
corrugated galvanized metal is located just south of the store building. Another outbuilding, a dirt-

100013883/100196

202

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
floored pole barn, is situated along the north boundary of the site near CR 391, to the west of the
store. A small shed was found 20 m northwest of the store building, so completely choked by
vegetation that it was nearly missed during site recording. The majority of the site area is very
densely wooded, and modern debris can been seen scattered throughout. The vegetation consists of
large pine trees interspersed with a few smaller hardwoods. The ground surface is entirely
obscured within the site boundaries due to the presence of pine duff and hardwood leaf litter.

Work Performed

The site is associated with an HHPA that was discerned on an aerial photograph from 1935 and
depicted on the 1958 USGS 15-minute Minden topographic quadrangle. A total of 10 shovel tests
were excavated in the vicinity of the standing structures to determine the horizontal and vertical
extent of the site. Of those 10 shovel tests, only Shovel Test 4 was culturally positive. This test
yielded a total of 20 artifacts consisting of 14 glass shards and 6 oxidized metal fragments. These
materials were recovered from a depth of 0 to 30 cmbs.

Artifact Assemblage

A total of 20 artifacts were recovered from a single shovel test. These materials include 14 glass
sherds and 6 metal fragments. The glass assemblage consists of 1 green bottle shard, 11 aqua-tinted
vessel shards, and 2 colorless window glass shards. None of the glass shards recovered from the
site have features that are temporally diagnostic. The metal assemblage is composed of 6 heavily
oxidized cast iron objects that cannot be identified. While none of the materials recovered are
particularly temporally sensitive, they, along with the structural remains, are consistent with a midtwentieth-century occupation.

Archival Research

Archival research indicates that the site is associated with the Brooks family, specifically with J.M.
Grant (Sallie Brooks Grantâs ex-husband) and his heirs throughout the twentieth century. Jessie
Brooks (Sallieâs father) first acquired the property in 1881, showing that the Brooks family was
associated with this tract of land continuously from 1881 through the late twentieth century. As
artifacts from the site indicate an early-twentieth-century occupation, it is likely the site is
associated with J.M. Grant and/or his heirs. The archival records available did not mention any
commercial enterprise associated with the tract of land containing 41RK611. Archival research
suggests there are no significant historical associations with this site. As a result, the property is
recommended not eligible under Criterion A or B.

Standing Historic Structures

A structure first appears at this location on the 1935 aerial photograph, and is also present on the
1958 USGS Minden 15-minute topographic quadrangle. Though there is no reference to a
commercial operation at site 41RK611 in the deed record, it appears to include the remnants of
100013883/100196

204

6. Survey Results
some type of store, and a 1936 highway map depicts a sawmill near the intersection where the site
is located (Texas State Highway Department 1936). There are three abandoned historic-age
structures remaining on the parcel, including a circa 1940 freestanding commercial building
(Structure A). This commercial building is a one-room, side-gabled structure with a small sidegabled wing on the northern terminus and a broad, hipped-roof awning on the primary faÃ§ade
covering a concrete pad (Figure 39). There are two large, fixed display windows on the primary
faÃ§ade and a band of fixed windows along the roof/wall junction on the rear faÃ§ade. The exterior is
clad in beveled horizontal wooden siding.

The second structure at the site (Structure B) is a circa 1935, side-gabled building of indeterminate
historic use (Figure 40). The structure has a wood frame and was originally clad in wood siding that
has been partially replaced with corrugated metal. It has replacement metal-sash windows and is
finished on the interior with wooden floors and wood-paneled walls. The third structure (Structure
C) is a large, front-gabled barn (Figure 41). This wood-framed structure has a corrugated metal roof
and corrugated metal cladding. There is an enclosed, raised, portion on the northern terminal end
that appears to have been used for dry goods storage, and the rest has an earthen floor and is open
to the outside.
Though structures A and C retain integrity, neither structure possesses any architectural merit. All
lack integrity of setting due to the siteâs overgrowth and abandonment, and Structure B lacks
integrity of materials, workmanship, and feeling due to the exterior recladding and replacement
windows. Additionally, the structures do not maintain any known historic associations. These
structures are not recommended for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion A, B, or C, either
individually or as a collective.

Discussion and Recommendations

Site 41RK611 is appears to be a historic-aged store with associated outbuildings. None of the
structures merits listing on the NRHP under Criterion C. The site dates to a well-documented period
in local and regional history (Glander et al. 1984; Skokan et al. 1997) and has no known associative
significance that would qualify it for NRHP listing under Criterion A or B. It is the opinion of the
Principal Investigator that site 41RK611 is ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP, and no further work
is recommended.

Site 41RK612
Background
Site 41RK612 is a historic-aged garbage dump located on the shoulderslope of a ridge that has been
mechanically modified to better contain the trash deposits. The site is situated at an approximate
elevation of 330 ft msl. It is approximately 120 m north of an unnamed drainage. Vegetation at the
site includes yaupon, sweetgums, some pines, red cedars, and Virginia creeper. Due to dense
vegetation and leaf litter, ground surface visibility was near zero at the time of the survey; only
large objects could be seen upon the ground surface. Soils within the site boundaries consist of
Woodtell loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). Shovel testing revealed brown sandy loam over
reddish brown sandy clay. Based upon the horizontal distribution of debris on the surface, site
41RK612 extends roughly 25 m north-south by 30 m east-west covering an area of roughly 750 m2
(Figure 42). Site 41RK612 is associated with an HHPA discerned on a 1935 aerial photograph.

Work Performed

A total of nine shovel tests were excavated in the vicinity of the trash scatter to determine the
horizontal and vertical extent of the site. All nine shovel tests were culturally sterile.

Artifact Assemblage

While no subsurface investigations resulted in the recovery of cultural material, many potentially
diagnostic artifacts were photographed, described, and left as they were identified on the ground
surface. Materials observed included pull-tab Budweiser cans, a lead glass lamp globe, bicycle, tires,
aluminum tubing, two metal tricycles of the same type, a metal gas can dated as assembled 7-1950,
and a THOR motorcycle motor. The THOR motor is model number 5136 and postdates 1903.

Discussion and Recommendations

Site 41RK612 is a historic-aged garbage dump with no associated structures or features. Judging
from the nature of the items observed on-site, it could have been first used as a trash dump in the
early twentieth century. The site contains no associated structural elements and dates to a welldocumented period in local and regional history (Glander et al. 1984; Skokan et al. 1997), and has
no known associative significance that would qualify it for NRHP listing under Criterion A or B. It is
the opinion of the Principal Investigator that site 41RK612 is ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP
and that no further work is necessary.

Site 41RK613 (Excluded from Permit Area)
Background
Site 41RK613 is a multicomponent site consisting of a scatter of historic-aged domestic debris and a
sparse prehistoric component consisting of a biface fragment and a single chert flake. The site is at
an approximate elevation of 327 ft msl. The site is situated upon a shoulderslope that slopes
northward and overlooks an unnamed drainage approximately 60 m north. Soils within the
boundaries of the site consist of Woodtell loam, 5 to 15 percent slopes and Latex very fine sandy
loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). Soils encountered during shovel testing consisted of 30 to
60 cm of brown and yellow-brown sandy loam over reddish brown or strong brown clay subsoil.

Based upon the horizontal distribution of surface and subsurface finds, site 41RK613 extends 40 m
north-south by 75 m east-west, covering an area of roughly 2,400 m2 (Figure 43). The site is located
east of a natural gas well pad. The southern half is in a cleared, grassy field while the northern is
densely wooded. The vegetation consists of large pine trees interspersed with a few smaller
hardwoods. The ground surface is entirely obscured within the siteâs boundaries due to the
presence of grasses to the south and pine duff to the north. A high game fence defines the boundary
between this tract and tract 1383 to the south and east.

Work Performed

The site is associated with an HHPA discerned on an aerial photography dating to 1935. A total of
26 shovel tests were excavated at 20-m intervals to determine the horizontal and vertical extent of
the cultural deposits. Of these tests, eight (1, 4, 8, 11, 13, 16, 17, and 25) were culturally positive.

Artifact Assemblage

The artifact assemblage recovered from site 41RK613 consists of historic domestic debris and
prehistoric lithic debitage. The historic materials recovered from the site include two colorless
glass shards with bubbles, six colorless glass shards without bubbles, two amber glass shards with
bubbles, one aqua-tinted glass shard with bubbles, one aqua-tinted glass shard without bubbles,
one opaline milk glass shard, one undecorated ironstone sherd, one wire nail, and a fragment of
barbed wire. In addition to subsurface finds, a small pile of Ferris bricks was found on the surface
just south of Shovel Test 11 (Figure 44a). In general, glass with bubble inclusions predates 1920
(Polak 2000). Bricks with the FERRIS makerâs mark date between 1901 and 1923 (Steinbomer
1981). All of the historic material recovered from shovel tests came from depths ranging between 0
and 40 cmbs with the majority coming from 0 to 30 cmbs.

6. Survey Results
Prehistoric materials recovered include one chert primary flake and one chert distal biface
fragment. Both of these specimens exhibit thermal alteration. The primary flake was recovered
from a depth of 40 to 50 cmbs, while the biface fragment was found at 0 to 10 cmbs. The biface
fragment may represent a dart point fragment with recurved lateral edges. However, without a
hafting element, this specimen is not temporally diagnostic.

Archival Research

No archival research was performed on site 41RK613 as it has been excluded from the permit area.
If the mine boundary expands to include this area, archival research is recommended to evaluate
the site under Criteria A and B.

Discussion and Recommendations

Site 41RK613 is a multicomponent site representing a historic-aged residence and a short-duration
prehistoric occupation. The historic component consists of only a diffuse historic artifact scatter,
although one sandstone boulder could represent a foundation pier for a former structure (Figure
44b). No standing structures or structural elements were found within the site boundaries. The
historic artifact assemblage from site 41RK613, including machine-made brick fragments, glass
shards, and a wire nail, suggests an early-twentieth-century domestic occupation. The historic
component dates to a well-documented period in local and regional history (Glander et al. 1984;
Skokan et al. 1997) and is unlikely to harbor significant data resources that could warrant NRHP
listing under Criterion D. However, it remains unknown whether or not the site has any associative
significance that could qualify it for NRHP listing under Criterion A or B. For this reason, it is
recommended that mine-related impact to this site be avoided. The site is outside the permit area
boundary and Luminant intends to avoid impact to it. If plans change making avoidance not
possible, it is recommended that additional archival research be conducted to determine whether
the historic component at the site possesses any associative significance.

The prehistoric component is represented by only two artifacts, one chert flake, and one biface
fragment. Thermal alteration of both lithic specimens suggests that the prehistoric occupants may
have utilized fire within the site boundaries to heat treat lithic raw materials or for subsistence
processing. However, the paucity of cultural materials suggests a short-duration prehistoric
occupation. No carbonized subsistence or fuel remains, diagnostic tools, or cultural features were
discovered during site delineation efforts. Due to this apparent lack of significant data resources, it
is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that the prehistoric component of site 41RK613 is
ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP, and no further work is recommended.

Site 41RK614
Background
Site 41RK614 is a prehistoric lithic scatter located upon a footslope above Martin Lake. The
landform slopes eastward and southward toward Martin Lake, approximately 60 m distant. The site
is located on a shoulderslope. Its elevation is approximately 325 ft msl. Soils on-site consist of Latex
very fine sandy loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). Soils encountered during shovel testing
consisted of 70 to 100 cm of brown and pale brown sand and sandy loam over reddish brown or
strong brown clay subsoil. Clay soils are much more shallowly buried downslope from the site,
where they are typically encountered at depths no greater than 30 cm.

Based upon the horizontal distribution of positive shovel tests, site 41RK614 extends 40 m northsouth by 40 m east-west and comprises an area of roughly 1,257 m2 (Figure 45). The site is located
south and east of a natural gas well pad and is accessible by a two-track roadway originating at the
well pad. The western two-thirds of the site is currently a pine plantation with immature trees 10 to
15 ft in height. The eastern one-third of the site is occupied by native vegetation including a few
large oak trees with a scrubby and viney understory. Ground surface visibility was obscured by
pine duff and hardwood leaf litter across the majority of the site. Slightly better surface visibility
was observed along a two-track roadway skirting the northeastern site boundary leading to a deer
blind to the east. A low barbed-wire fence line runs parallel to this two-track roadway.

Work Performed

A total of 21 shovel tests were excavated to determine the horizontal and vertical extent of the site.
Shovel tests were excavated at 10-m intervals along cardinal directions. Three tests (1, 2, and 7)
were culturally positive. The site lacked surface expression.

Artifact Assemblage

The artifact assemblage recovered from site 41RK614 consists of five pieces of lithic debitage and
one modified flake. Raw material types represented in the lithic assemblage include chert, silicified
wood, and metaquartzite. Only one piece of debitage shows signs of thermal alteration. The
modified flake is unifacially knapped on one edge and exhibits a bending fracture on its proximal
end. The bending fracture and a lack of edge-wear suggest that the uniface failed during
manufacture and was discarded without having been utilized. The uniface and two other flakes
were recovered from a depth of 70 to 90 cmbs. The balance of the debitage found at the site came
from a depth of 10 to 30 cmbs.

100013883/100196

214

Liberty Deposit Mine Area

Discussion and Recommendations
Site 41RK614 is a low density prehistoric lithic scatter that likely resulted from a short-duration
occupation. Evidence of thermal alteration on one piece of lithic debitage suggests that the
prehistoric occupants may have utilized fire on-site to heat treat lithic raw materials or for
subsistence processing. The siteâs topographic position suggests that soils may have aggraded by
colluvial deposition.

The low density of cultural materials suggests a short-duration prehistoric occupation, resulting in
part from the production, use, or maintenance of lithic tools. No carbonized organic subsistence or
fuel remains, temporally diagnostic lithic tools, or cultural features were discovered during site
delineation, suggesting the site lacks significant data resources. For these reasons, it is the opinion
of the Principal Investigator that site 41RK614 is ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP, and no
further work recommended.

Site 41RK615
Background

Site 41RK615 is a Late Prehistoric site located on a footslope overlooking the Dry Creek tributary
arm of Martin Lake at an elevation of approximately 350 ft msl. The landform slopes southward
toward Martin Lake, approximately 30 m distant. The site was located within the right of way of a
well-maintained transmission line between two transmission line towers. The soil on-site is
Cuthbert fine sandy loam 5 to 15 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). Soils encountered during shovel
testing consisted of 70 to 100 cm of brown to yellowish brown sandy loam over dense hematite
gravel and bedrock.

Based upon the horizontal distribution of positive shovel tests, site 41RK615 extends 20 m north to
south by 10 m east to west and comprises an area of roughly 200 m2 (Figure 46). The vegetation
outside the right of way is a mix of oak, pine, and yaupon. Tall grasses reduced the surface visibility
to approximately 10 percent across the site. The site has been impacted somewhat by feral hog
rooting. These disturbances occasionally afforded slightly better ground surface visibility.

Work Performed

A total of 11 shovel tests were excavated at 10-m intervals in a cruciform pattern to determine the
siteâs limits. Of these tests, two (1 and 2) were culturally positive. The site lacked a surface
expression.

100013883/100196

Liberty Deposit Mine Area

Artifact Assemblage
The artifact assemblage recovered from site 41RK615 consists of three pieces of lithic debitage and
one prehistoric ceramic sherd. Raw material types represented in the lithic assemblage include
chert and silicified wood. Differentiated by reduction stage, the four flakes consisted of one primary
flake and three tertiary flakes. All three flakes show signs of thermal alteration. One flake was
recovered from Shovel Test 1 in Level 3, and one flake was recovered from each of levels 6 and 7 in
Shovel Test 2. The ceramic sherd was recovered from Level 7 of Shovel Test 2.
The prehistoric ceramic sherd (Lot 3.2) is an undecorated near-rim sherd. It has a bone-and-grogtempered paste, and its surfaces had been dry-smoothed. It has an average thickness of 6.2 mm and
appears to have been fired in a partially reducing environment. The sherd lacks diagnostic
attributes that would allow a temporal assignment.

Discussion and Recommendations

Site 41RK615 is a low density Late Prehistoric artifact scatter represented by four pieces of
debitage and one prehistoric ceramic sherd. The siteâs topographic position along with variability in
soil depth across the site is suggestive of a nonaggrading environment.

Thermal alteration of all of the lithic specimens suggests that the prehistoric occupants may have
utilized fire within the site boundaries to heat treat lithic raw materials or for subsistence
processing. However, the low density of cultural materials suggests a short-duration occupation.
The ephemeral nature of the site, along with the absence of carbonized subsistence or fuel remains
or identifiable cultural features, indicates that significant data resources have not been preserved
on-site. For these reasons, it is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that site 41RK615 does not
meet the criteria warranting inclusion in the NRHP, and no further work is recommended.

Site 41RK616
Background

Site 41RK616 is a prehistoric lithic scatter located on ridge summit overlooking Martin Lake. The
site would have been located near the confluence of Martin Creek and Dry Creek prior to the
impoundment of the lake. The site is situated at an elevation of approximately 360 ft msl and is
approximately 250 m west of Martin Lake. The site was located in a cleared pasture with a few
small pockets of trees with a greenbrier understory. Soils within the boundaries of the site consist
of Sawlit-Sawtown Complex, 0 to 2 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). Soils encountered during shovel
testing consisted of 40 to 90 cm of brown sandy loam over strong brown to reddish brown sandy
clay. Clay soils were found at much shallower depths to the south and east of the site, on more
steeply sloped topography.
100013883/100196

218

6. Survey Results
Based upon the horizontal distribution of positive shovel tests, site 41RK616 extends 20 m north to
south by 10 m east to west and comprises an area of roughly 200 m2 (Figure 47). The grassy terrain
in the cleared pasture areas and leaf litter in the treed areas reduced ground surface visibility to
less than 5 percent across the site.

Work Performed

A total of 10 shovel tests were excavated in a cruciform pattern at 10-m intervals to determine the
horizontal and vertical extent of the site. Of these tests, two (1 and 2) were culturally positive. The
site lacked a surface expression.

Artifact Assemblage

The artifact assemblage recovered from site 41RK616 consists of two specimens of nondiagnostic
lithic debitage. The assemblage includes a chert tertiary flake and a hematite core fragment
retaining some cortex. The flake was recovered from Shovel Test 1 in Level 4, while the core was
recovered from Shovel Test 2 in Level 6.

Discussion and Recommendations

Site 41RK616 is a low density prehistoric lithic scatter. The siteâs topographic position on a ridge
summit with no obvious sources for colluvial deposition along with soil depth variability across the
site suggests the landform has been relatively stable since abandonment. However, clearing likely
resulted in some turbation of the sediments on-site.

The low density of cultural materials present on-site indicates a short-duration prehistoric
occupation. The absence of any preserved subsistence or fuel remains or identifiable features
suggests that the site does not harbor significant data resources. For these reasons, it is the opinion
of the Principal Investigator that site 41RK616 does not meet any eligibility criteria warranting
listing on the NRHP, and no further work is recommended.

Site 41RK617
Background

Site 41RK617 is a newly recorded historic-aged homestead located to the northwest of the
intersection of FM 2145 and CR 326. The site consists of a scatter of historic-aged domestic debris
and a single sandstone foundation pier. The site is situated on a ridge summit that slopes very
gently southwest at an approximate elevation of 390 ft msl. Soils within the boundaries of the site
include Latex very fine sandy loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes and Cuthbert fine sandy loam, 5 to
15 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). Soils encountered during shovel testing consisted of 20 to 30 cm of
gray to yellow-brown silty loam over strong brown clay.

6. Survey Results
Based upon the horizontal distribution of surface and subsurface finds, site 41RK617 extends 30 m
north to south by 45 m east to west, covering an area of roughly 1,140 m2 (Figure 48). A fence
crosses the west third of the site north to south. To the west of this fence lies a modern occupied
house surrounded by a lawn. To the east of the fence, the site is densely wooded with small
hardwood saplings and briar underbrush. Poison ivy, pine duff, and hardwood leaf litter limited
ground surface visibility to less than 5 percent.

Work Performed

Site 41RK617 is associated with an HHPA discerned on a 1935 aerial photograph. A total of 15
shovel tests were excavated at 10-m intervals to determine the horizontal and vertical extents of
the cultural deposits. Of these tests, four (1, 2, 6, and 12) were culturally positive.

Shovel testing yielded a total of 14 artifacts. Shovel Test 1 had 8 artifacts, Shovel Test 2 had 3,
Shovel Test 6 had 1, and Shovel Test 12 had 2. One artifact came from Level 1 (0 to 10 cmbs), with 6
from levels 2 (10 to 20 cmbs) and 3 (20 to 30 cmbs), and 1 from Level 5 (40 to 50 cmbs).

Artifact Assemblage

The artifact assemblage recovered from site 41RK617 consists of 14 pieces of historic domestic
debris. These consist of five ceramic sherds and nine glass shards.

The ceramic assemblage includes two slipped stoneware sherds and three ironstone sherds. Of the
slipped stoneware sherds, one has a greenish slip on both sides, while the other has a tan slip on the
exterior and a brown slip on the interior. Of the ironstone sherds, one has a molded dot design on
the rim, and the other two are undecorated.

The glass assemblage is composed of nine glass shards consisting of two amber bottle shards with
bubble inclusions, one amber bottle shard with bubble inclusions and a mold seam, one molded
colorless vessel shard, three colorless vessel shards with bubble inclusions, one pressed colorless
shard with bubble inclusions, and one flat colorless shard of window glass. Most of the artifacts
recovered are consistent with an early- to mid-twentieth-century occupation. In general, glass with
bubble inclusions predates 1920 (Polak 2000).
A square sandstone foundation pier was also identified on the ground surface but was not collected.

Archival Research

A structure appears at this location on the 1935 aerial photograph, but it is not present on the 1958
USGS Minden 15-minute topographic quadrangle. Archival research indicates that this property
was associated with African American property owners and/or tenants during the late nineteenth
and early twentieth centuries. The Menefee, Barr, and Humphrey families jointly owned it from
100013883/100196

221

6. Survey Results
approximately 1877 through 1887, and it was associated with Abe Humphrey from 1887 through
1896. From 1896 through 1900, any occupation would have been associated with tenants, and from
1900 through the twentieth century, the property was associated with the Wesley Menefee family.
The small number of artifacts recovered from the site suggests an early-twentieth-century
occupation. Although this site is associated with African American property owners in this region,
additional archival research is unlikely to provide additional specific information about the history
of this site. As a result, this site is recommended not eligible under Criterion A or B.

Discussion and Recommendations

Site 41RK617 is a historic-aged homestead consisting of a sandstone foundation pier and a
subsurface scatter of historic debris. No standing structures or other structural remnants were
found within the site boundaries. The historic artifact assemblage from site 41RK617, including
bubble-included glass shards, suggests an early- to mid-twentieth-century occupation. The site
dates to a well-documented period in local and regional history (Glander et al. 1984; Skokan et al.
1997) and has no known associative significance that would qualify it for NRHP listing under
Criterion A or B. It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that site 41RK617 is ineligible for
inclusion in the NRHP and that no further work is necessary.

Site 41RK618
Background

Site 41RK618 is a newly recorded historic house site located on the shoulder of a small hill bounded
on the north by a minor drainage and on the west by a two-track roadway. The site is situated at an
elevation of approximately 340 ft msl. Soils within the site boundaries consist of Woodtell loam, 5
to 15 percent slopes and Latex very fine sandy loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). Soils
encountered during shovel testing consisted of strong brown sandy loam over red clay. Bulldozer
push piles were observed in the vicinity of the site.

The site consists of a surface scatter of brick and domestic debris and a machine-made brick
fireplace seat (Figure 49). Based on surface expression, site 41RK618 extends roughly 25 m east to
west by 20 m north to south and covers an area of roughly 500 m2 (Figure 50). A small but deeply
incised drainage is along the northern boundary of the site. A two-track roadway runs along the
western site boundary and crosses the drainage northwest of the site. The site is densely wooded
with a few young pines across its southern half and stunted upland hardwoods and briars across
the north. Ground surface visibility is rather poor due to the dense understory in the northern half
and pine duff in the southern half of the site.

Work Performed
Site 41RK618 is associated with an HHPA discerned on a 1935 aerial photograph. A total of 12
shovel tests were excavated at 10- to 20-m intervals to determine the horizontal and vertical limits
of the cultural deposits. Two of the 12 shovel tests (1 and 10) were culturally positive. Five artifacts
were recovered from Shovel Test 1, while Shovel Test 10 yielded one artifact. All subsurface
artifacts were recovered from Level 2 (10 to 20 cmbs). Two artifacts were recovered from the
ground surface.

Artifact Assemblage

A total of eight ceramic, glass, and metal artifacts were recovered. All of the ceramic materials are
ironstone and consist of one molded and two undecorated sherds. The glass assemblage includes
one colorless pattern-molded glass shard, one aqua-tinted bottle shard with bubble inclusions, and
one colorless bottle collected from the surface with a makerâs mark. Two nails, one cut and one
wire, were recovered from shovel tests.

The recovered artifact assemblage is consistent with an early- to mid-twentieth-century
occupation. The makerâs mark on the complete glass bottle is for the Knox Glass Company and dates
between 1932 and 1953 (Toulouse 1971). In general, glass with bubble inclusions predates 1920
(Polak 2000). Although wire nails were introduced during the first quarter of the nineteenth
century, they did not replace cut nails until the last decade of the century (Adams 2002).

Archival Research

Archival research indicates that the site may be associated with several nonoccupant owners
including Rade and M. Kangerga, P.E. Watson, and Miller Adams. Artifacts from the site indicate an
early- to mid-twentieth-century occupation. Archival research suggests there are no significant
historical associations with this site. As a result, the property is recommended not eligible under
Criterion A or B.

Discussion and Recommendations

Site 41RK618 is a historic residential occupation dating to the early to mid-twentieth century.
Although a brick fireplace seat points to the former presence of a residential structure, no standing
structures or other structural remnants were identified on-site. The chimney seat was formed from
modern extruded bricks and was likely built in the middle to late twentieth century, possibly as late
as the mid-1970s. Site 41RK618 dates to a well-documented period in local and regional history
(Glander et al. 1984; Skokan et al. 1997) and is unlikely to have significant data resources that could
warrant NRHP listing under Criterion D. However, it remains unknown whether or not the site has
any associative significance that would qualify it for NRHP listing under Criterion A or B. For this
reason, it is recommended that mine-related impact to this site be avoided. The site is beyond the
limits of the permit area and Luminant intends to avoid it. If plans change making avoidance not
100013883/100196

6. Survey Results
possible, it is recommended that additional archival research be conducted to determine if the site
possesses any associative significance.

Site 41RK619
Background

Site 41RK619 is thought to represent a historic residential occupation with a prehistoric isolated
find. The site is situated upon the shoulderslope of a ridge at an approximate elevation of 320 ft msl.
Soils within the site boundaries consist of Sawlit-Sawtown complex, 0 to 2 percent slopes (NRCS
2010). Soils encountered in shovel tests consisted of 20 to 30 cm of brown loamy sand over strong
brown to reddish brown sandy clay subsoil.

Based upon the horizontal distribution of surface and subsurface materials, the site is contained
within a parabolic-shaped area that extends 50 m north-south by 100 m east-west, and covers an
area of roughly 3,000 m2 (Figure 51). The site is wooded, with a portion cleared for pipelines and a
well pad. The ground surface visibility was limited to less than 5 percent by grasses and leaf litter.
The vegetation in the wooded portion of the site consists of large pine trees interspersed with a
smaller hardwood understory.

Work Performed

The site is associated with an HHPA discerned on an aerial photograph dating to 1935. A total of 22
shovel tests were excavated at 15-m intervals to determine the siteâs limits and obtain a
representative artifact sample. Of the 22 shovel tests excavated, 6 were culturally positive, yielding
19 historic artifacts and 1 isolated prehistoric artifact. Twelve artifacts were recovered from Shovel
Test 6. Four artifacts were recovered from Shovel Test 4. Shovel Test 9 yielded two artifacts, while
shovel tests 2 and 3 yielded 1 artifact each. All historic artifacts were recovered from levels 1 and 2
(0 to 20 cmbs). The prehistoric isolate was recovered near the eastern border of the site in Shovel
Test 9 from Level 3 (20 to 30 cmbs).

Artifact Assemblage

The historic artifact assemblage is composed of 19 artifacts of ceramic, glass, and iron. The
prehistoric assemblage consists of a single lithic flake.

The ceramic assemblage is composed of five sherds. Three of the sherds are ironstone, two of which
are undecorated. The third ironstone sherd is a handle sherd exhibiting a yellow glaze. The
remaining two sherds are stoneware. One of these sherds has a reddish yellow slip on both the
interior and exterior surfaces. The other has a Bristol glaze on the exterior and an Albany glaze on
the interior.

100013883/100196

227

6. Survey Results
The glass assemblage is composed of 10 shards including 1 aqua bottle shard exhibiting a suction
scar and bubble inclusions, 1 amber bottle shard with bubble inclusions, 4 colorless vessels shards,
1 pink-tinted Depression glass shard with the American Sweetheart pattern, 1 colorless vessel
shard with bubble inclusions, and 2 aqua-tinted window glass shards. Four iron wire nails were
also recovered. The isolated prehistoric artifact is a light yellow chert tertiary flake.

The historic artifacts are consistent with an early-twentieth-century occupation. Stonewares with
Bristol glazes and Albany-type slip glazes were most popular before 1920 (Greer 1981) though they
remain in production today. The Depression glass with the American Sweetheart pattern dates to
between 1930 and 1936 (Schroy 2007). Although wire nails were introduced during the first
quarter of the nineteenth century, they did not replace cut nails until the last decade of the century
(Adams 2002).

Archival Research

Archival records indicate that the site is likely associated with the propertyâs occupation of the Jim
Thompson, Royal Booty, or Will Ballenger families or that of their tenants. It does not possess any
historic associations that would qualify it for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion A or B.

Discussion and Recommendations

Site 41RK619 is a historic artifact scatter with a prehistoric isolated find. The historic component
consists of only a diffuse scatter of historic-aged domestic debris. No standing structures or
structural elements were found within the site boundaries. The historic artifact assemblage from
site 41RK619, including bubble-included glass, temporally diagnostic ceramic sherds, window glass
sherds, and wire nails, suggests an early-twentieth-century domestic occupation. The historic
component of the site dates to a well-documented period in local and regional history (Glander et
al. 1984; Skokan et al. 1997), suggesting significant data resources that could warrant NRHP listing
under Criteria D are not present on-site. The site lacks any associative significance that would
qualify it for NRHP listing under Criterion A or B. For these reasons, site 41RK619 is thought to be
ineligible for NRHP inclusion, and no further work is recommended.
The single prehistoric artifact recovered is an isolated find; it is not considered a site component
and does not warrant listing on the NRHP.

Site 41RK620
Background

Site 41RK620 is a newly recorded scatter of historic debris located on a southeast facing
shoulderslope at an approximate elevation of 335 ft msl. Martin Lake is located approximately 60 m
to the southeast of the site. Soils within the site boundaries consist of Woodtell loam, 5 to
100013883/100196

229

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
15 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). Soils encountered during shovel testing consisted of yellowish
brown to reddish brown sandy loam over sandy clay of similar colors.

Based upon the horizontal distribution of domestic debris, site 41RK620 extends roughly 70 m east
to west by 50 m north to south and covers an area of roughly 3,500 m2 (Figure 52). A small but
deeply incised drainage is along the north boundary of the site. A two-track roadway runs along the
western site boundary and crosses the drainage northwest of the site. The site is densely wooded
with a few young pines across its southern half and stunted upland hardwoods and briars across
the north. Ground surface visibility is rather poor on-site due to the dense understory in the north
half and pine duff in the south half of the site. Site 41RK620 is associated with an HHPA discerned
on a 1935 aerial photograph.

Work Performed

A total of 13 shovel tests were excavated in a cruciform pattern at 15-m intervals to determine the
horizontal and vertical extent of the site. Of the 13 shovel tests excavated, 3 were culturally positive
and yielded four historic artifacts. Shovel tests 1 and 3 yielded one artifact each, and Shovel Test 2
yielded two. One artifact was recovered from Level 1 (0 to 10 cmbs), two artifacts were recovered
from levels 2â3 (10 to 30 cmbs), and one artifact was recovered from Level 3 (20 to 30 cmbs).

Artifact Analysis

A total of four artifacts were recovered from site 41RK620, consisting of three ceramic sherds and
one wire nail. The ceramic assemblage is composed of two undecorated ironstone sherds and one
stoneware sherd with an Albany slip glaze on the interior and exterior. A stoneware sherd with a
Bristol glaze on the interior and exterior was observed on the ground surface but not collected.
An amber bottle embossed with âCloverâs Imperial Medicineâ on one side and âNew Yorkâ on the
other was observed on the ground surface but not collected (Figure 53). This bottle also has an
unidentifiable makerâs mark and a suction scar. An amber snuff jar was also observed on the
ground surface but not collected. The artifacts present at the site are consistent with an early- to
mid-twentieth-century occupation. Stoneware with Albany slip glazes was most popular prior to
1940 (Stelle 2010). Machine-made bottles with suction scars typically postdate 1905 (SHA 2010).
Although wire nails were introduced during the first quarter of the nineteenth century, they did not
replace cut nails until the last decade of the century (Adams 2002).

Archival Research

Land records for the parcel containing this site suggest that the site was most likely associated with
the Edward Findley homestead or that of his tenants. The site does not possess any historic
associations that would qualify it for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion A or B.

Discussion and Recommendations
Site 41RK620 is a historic-aged site likely representing a homestead and consists of a very diffuse
scatter of domestic debris. The artifact assemblage suggests an early- to mid-twentieth-century
occupation. No standing structures or other structural remnants were found. This site dates to a
well-documented period in local and regional history (Glander et al. 1984; Skokan et al. 1997) and
is unlikely to harbor significant data resources that could warrant NRHP listing under Criterion D.
The site lacks any associative significance that could qualify it for NRHP listing under Criterion A or
B. For these reasons, site 41RK620 appears to be ineligible for NRHP inclusion, and no further
investigation is recommended.

Site 41RK621
Background

Site 41RK621 is a prehistoric lithic scatter located on a shoulderslope above Martin Lake at an
approximate elevation of 377 ft msl. The landform slopes southward toward Martin Lake,
approximately 30 m distant. Soils within the site boundaries consist of Woodtell loam, 1 to
3 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). The soils encountered during shovel testing consisted of 30 to 90 cm
of yellowish brown sandy loam over a strong brown clay. Clay soils are much more deeply buried in
the lower elevations of the site, suggesting that soils have eroded from the summit of the landform
and have been redeposited to the southeast.
100013883/100196

232

6. Survey Results
Based upon the horizontal distribution of positive shovel tests, the site extends 60 m north to south
by 40 m east to west and comprises an area of roughly 1,200 m2 (Figure 54). The site is situated
within a deciduous forest. Hardwood leaf litter entirely obscured the ground surface.

Work Performed

A total of 22 shovel tests were excavated at 10-m intervals following a cruciform pattern to
determine the siteâs extent. Of the 22 shovel tests, 5 were culturally positive yielding a total of six
prehistoric artifacts. Shovel tests 1, 3, 14, and 16 yielded one artifact each, while Shovel Test 6
yielded two. Three of the artifacts were recovered from Level 1 (0 to 10 cmbs), while two artifacts
came from Level 2 (10 to 20 cmbs), and one artifact was recovered from Level 3 (20 to 30 cmbs).
The site lacked surface expression.

Artifact Assemblage

The artifact assemblage recovered from site 41RK615 consists of six pieces of nondiagnostic lithic
debitage; four are chert specimens, and two are of silicified wood. One chert flake and two silicified
wood flakes show signs of thermal alteration. All lithic materials recovered are tertiary flakes.

All of the cultural materials recovered were confined to the upper three levels. This, coupled with
the fact that the soils on-site appear to have eroded downhill, indicates that these artifacts may
have been more deeply buried.

Discussion and Recommendations

Site 41RK621 is a low density prehistoric lithic scatter that likely resulted from a short-duration
occupation sometime during the prehistoric period. The siteâs topographic position, along with
variability in the depth of soil across the site suggests the landform harboring the site has been
impacted by erosion since its prehistoric abandonment.

Thermal alteration of half of the lithic specimens suggests that the prehistoric occupants may have
utilized fire on-site to heat treat lithic raw materials or for subsistence processing. The low density
of lithic debris, lack of formal tools, and an absence of identifiable features or carbonized
subsistence or fuel remains indicate the site does not harbor significant data resources.
Additionally, the site also appears to have been negatively impacted to some extent from erosion.
For these reasons, site 41RKT621 does not appear to meet any of the NRHP eligibility criteria, and
no further work is recommended.

Site 41RK623
Background
Site 41RK623 is a prehistoric lithic scatter located west of Martin Lake on a shoulderslope at an
approximate elevation of 330 ft msl. The landform slopes to the southeast toward Martin Lake,
approximately 30 m distant. Soils on-site consist of Woodtell loam, 5 to 15 percent slopes (NRCS
2010). Soils encountered during shovel testing consisted of 70 to 100 cm of yellowish brown fine
sand and sandy loam over reddish brown clay loam subsoil. Most of the site exhibited very deep
sands, and clay-dominated subsoils were only reached in the western portion of the site.

Based upon the horizontal distribution of positive shovel tests, site 41RK623 extends 50 m northsouth by 50 m east-west and comprises an area of roughly 2,500 m2 (Figure 55). The site is located
on sloping terrain very near the Martin Lake shoreline. The site would have been situated
approximately 300 m west of the primary Martin Creek stream course prior to the impoundment of
the lake. A small drainage runs from the northwest to the southeast toward the lake and bounds the
site to the north. Vegetation consists of plantation pine trees with scrubby hardwood underbrush
with some green briar. Pine duff entirely obscures the ground surface. A large, graveled well pad is
situated roughly 100 m east of the site.

Work Performed

A total of 19 shovel tests were excavated in a cruciform pattern at 10-m intervals to determine the
horizontal and vertical extent of the site. Of the 19 shovel tests excavated, 4 were culturally positive
for prehistoric artifacts. Shovel Test 1 yielded two artifacts, Shovel Test 5 yielded two artifacts,
Shovel Test 8 yielded one artifact, and Shovel Test 9 yielded three artifacts. Levels 4 (30 to
40 cmbs), 5 (40 to 50 cmbs), and 7 (60 to 70 cmbs) yielded two artifacts each. Levels 6 (50 to
60 cmbs) and 8 (70 to 80 cmbs) each yielded one artifacts. The site was not expressed on the
ground surface.

Artifact Assemblage

A total of eight pieces of nondiagnostic lithic debitage, composed of secondary and tertiary flakes,
were recovered through shovel testing. Three of the flakes are thermally altered secondary flakes,
of which one is silicified wood and two are chert. The assemblage also includes five tertiary flakes
of which two are chert, two are silicified wood, and one is metaquartzite. Only one of the chert
tertiary flakes was not thermally altered.

235

6. Survey Results

Discussion and Recommendations
Site 41RK623 is a low density prehistoric lithic scatter represented by eight pieces of lithic
debitage. The high percentage of thermally altered lithic specimens suggests that the prehistoric
occupants may have utilized fire on-site, perhaps to heat treat lithic raw materials or to process
subsistence resources. Lithic flaking debris was recovered from variable depths ranging from 30 to
80 cmbs. The vertical distribution of these materials likely resulted in part from artifact cycling that
can be attributable to bioturbation. The siteâs topographic position indicates that the landform may
have aggraded from colluvial deposition. The site soils may have derived from a higher elevation on
the landform to the west.
The low density of cultural materials on-site as well as an absence of any carbonized subsistence or
fuel remains suggests that the site does not harbor significant data that meet the criteria
warranting NRHP inclusion. For these reasons, it is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that
site 41RL623 is not eligible for NRHP listing, and no further work is recommended.

Site 41RK624
Background

Site 41RK624 is a newly recorded historic farmstead consisting of a surface and subsurface scatter
of historic-aged domestic debris. The site is situated upon the summit of a small knoll situated atop
a shoulder at an approximate elevation of 360 ft msl. Soils on-site consist of Latex very fine sandy
loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). Soils encountered during shovel testing consisted of 20 to
40 cm of brown sandy loam over reddish brown sandy clay. The site is situated roughly 140 m west
of the Martin Lake shoreline.
Based upon the horizontal distribution of surface and subsurface materials, site 41RK624 extends
roughly 15 m north to south by 45 m east to west covering an area of about 675 m2 (Figure 56). The
ground surface was obscured by pine duff and hardwood leaf litter. The site has been severely
impacted by the construction of a well pad and a pipeline.

Work Performed

Site 41RK624 is associated with an HHPA discerned on an aerial photograph dating to 1935. A total
of 11 shovel tests were excavated in a cruciform pattern at 10- to 15-m intervals to determine the
horizontal and vertical extent of the site. Of the 11 shovel tests excavated, 2 were culturally positive
for historic artifacts. Shovel tests 1 and 5 yielded one artifact each. Both artifacts were recovered
from Level 2 (10 to 20 cmbs).

Artifact Assemblage
The artifact assemblage recovered from site 41RK610 includes one undecorated ironstone sherd
and one colorless window glass shard. A partially collapsed chimney was also found on-site (Figure
57). This feature was constructed of machine-made red bricks. Neither of the artifacts recovered
are very temporally sensitive but generally suggest a late-nineteenth- to middle-twentieth-century
occupation.

Archival Research
Archival records indicate that the site may have been associated with the N.O. (Cap) Cato family,
including his children Susie, Burnie, Eli, and Leon Cato. Members of this family owned the parcel
from 1902 through the 1950s. The site does not possess any historic associations that would qualify
it for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion A or B.

Discussion and Recommendations

Site 41RK624 is a historic-aged homestead represented by a partially collapsed chimney and two
historic artifacts. No standing structures were found on-site. The historic artifact assemblage
generally suggests a late-nineteenth- to middle-twentieth-century occupation. Site 41RK624 dates
to a well-documented period in local and regional history (Glander et al. 1984; Skokan et al. 1997)
and is unlikely to harbor significant data resources that could warrant NRHP listing under Criterion
D. The site lacks any associative significance that could qualify it for NRHP listing under Criterion A
or B. For these reasons, site 41RK624 is thought to be ineligible for NRHP inclusion, and no further

Site 41RK625
Background
Site 41RK625 is a newly recorded historic site, with a prehistoric isolated find, situated on a
shoulderslope above Martin Lake at an approximate elevation of 340 ft msl. The soils on-site are
mapped as Woodtell loam, 5 to 15 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). The soils encountered during
shovel testing consisted of 50 to 70 cm of yellowish brown sandy loam over reddish yellow to
strong brown clay subsoil.

Based upon the horizontal distribution of surface and subsurface cultural materials, site 41RK625
extends 110 m southwest-northeast by 55 m northwest-southeast, and covers an area that is
roughly 6,050 m2 (Figure 58). The site is bisected by a natural gas pipeline corridor. This
northwest-to-southeast-oriented pipeline corridor corresponds with the northeastern Liberty
Deposit boundary. The site is densely wooded with large pine trees, smaller hardwoods, and a
brushy understory. The ground surface was entirely obscured within the site boundaries due to the
presence of grasses, pine duff, and hardwood leaf litter. Ornamental flowering plants were sparsely
distributed across the eastern half of the site.

Work Performed

Site 41RK625 is associated with an HHPA discerned on the 1958 Minden 15 minute topographic
quadrangle, as well as a 1935 aerial photograph. A total of 28 shovel tests were excavated at 10-m
intervals to determine the horizontal and vertical limits of the cultural deposits. Of these tests, eight
(1, 2, 5, 8, 12, 15, 20, and 24) were culturally positive. Levels 1 and 2 (0 to 10 cmbs and 10 to
20 cmbs) yielded six artifacts each, while Level 6 (50 to 60 cmbs) yielded three artifacts.

Artifact Assemblage

Shovel testing yielded 15 artifacts including 1 prehistoric, 12 historic, and 2 modern artifacts. The
prehistoric assemblage is represented by a single primary chert flake. The historic artifact
assemblage includes two Albany-like slip-glazed stoneware sherds, four colorless glass vessel
shards, one colorless glass vessel shard with bubble inclusions, two hand-made brick fragments,
two wire nails, and a cast iron plate with an attached wire nail. Modern items recovered from
shovel testing include two fragments of plastic.

The remains of three possible structures were also identified on-site. One structure is represented
by a single sandstone foundation pier in the southwest corner of what appears to be a structure
footprint, a flanged iron sewer pipe extending vertically above the ground surface (Figure 59), and
a sparse scatter of ornamental flowering plants located in the southern half of the site. A brick pile
is located about 10 m to the east of the possible structure footprint. Nearly 30 m to the east-

additional architectural remains including five foundation pier stones, a brick chimney fall (F4), a
brick housing for a brick-lined well (F1) (Figure 60), a trash-filled depression (F3) that may
represent a former cellar or cistern, and two piles of brick. Numerous concentrations of both
modern and historic trash are scattered across the site. Materials observed within these scatters
include colorless glass jars and bottles, amber glass bottles, tin cans, corrugated sheet metal,
asphalt shingles, rubber tires, a refrigerator, manufactured brick, a stove, a clothes dryer, a
television, an abandoned car, and an abandoned truck.
The artifacts present at the site are consistent with a late-nineteenth- to early-twentieth-century
occupation. Temporally diagnostic artifacts observed and recovered on-site consist of stoneware,
hand-made bricks, and glass fragments. Albany-like slip-glaze variations on stoneware generally
predate 1920 (Greer 1981). Glass with bubble inclusions generally predates 1920 (Polak 2000).
Hand-made bricks generally predate 1900 (Steinbomer 1982).

Archival Research

Archival records suggest that the site may have been associated with one of a number of families
who owned the property from the late nineteenth through early twentieth centuries. These include
possible occupants Stephen and Sophia Jones (prior to 1902), Marvin Adams or his tenants (1902â
1912), tenants of J.H. Fitzgerald (1912â1918), tenants of R.C. and Bonita Wathen (1918â1922), O.L.
Sanders or his tenants (1922â1925), Miller Adams and P.E. Watson (circa 1925â1934), or tenants

of Rade and M. Kangerga (1934â1944). The site does not possess any known historic associations
that would qualify it for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion A or B.

Discussion and Recommendations

Site 41RK625 is a historic site with a prehistoric isolated find. The historic materials observed and
recovered on-site suggest an early-twentieth-century domestic occupation. The historic component
of site 41RK625 dates to a well-documented period in local and regional history (Glander et al.
1984; Skokan et al. 1997) and is unlikely to harbor significant data resources that could warrant
NRHP listing under Criterion D. The site lacks any associative significance that could qualify it for
NRHP listing under Criterion A or B. For these reasons, site 41RK625 does not appear to warrant
NRHP inclusion, and no additional investigation is recommended.

Site 41RK626
Background

Site 41RK626 is a historic farmstead located upon a relatively flat to very gently sloping ridge
summit at an elevation of 380 ft msl. Soils on-site consist of Meth fine sandy loam, 2 to 5 percent
slopes (NRCS 2010). Typical soils encountered during shovel testing consisted of 40 cm of brown
sandy loam over strong brown clay subsoil.
The majority of the site is located in a cleared grassy field and is surrounded by dense pines. A few
pecan trees are located near the currently occupied house and metal barn. A small stand of
hackberry, sweetgum, and other smaller hardwoods surrounds an outbuilding near the northwest
corner of the site. Grasses blanket the majority of the site and entirely obscure the ground surface.
The area around the house appeared to have been recently mowed at the time of the site visit.

Work Performed

A total of 12 shovel tests were excavated at 15-m intervals in the vicinity of the standing structures
to define the site limits and obtain a representative artifact sample. Of these 12 tests, only 2 (1 and
10) were culturally positive. Based on the horizontal distribution of standing structures and
subsurface finds, site 41RK626 extends approximately 100 m north-south by 90 m east-west,
covering an area of roughly 9,000 m2 (Figure 61).

Artifact Assemblage
The artifact assemblage recovered from shovel tests at site 41RK626 consists of six wire nail
fragments and two fragments of barbed wire. In addition to subsurface finds, a small pile of Ferris
bricks was found on the surface just north of a small shed located near the northwestern boundary
of the site. Brick with the Ferris makerâs mark dates between 1901 and 1923 (Steinbomer 1981).
All of the historic material recovered from shovel tests came from Level 2 (10 to 20 cmbs).

Historic Standing Structures

This site currently includes three historic-age structures (see Figure 61) that were likely associated
with the Sallie Grant family and/or associated tenants. Structure A is a circa 1940, wood-framed,
single-family dwelling (Figure 62) that appears to have replaced an earlier structure depicted on
the 1935 aerial photograph. The primary faÃ§ade has been altered, and the original porch may have
been infilled or replaced. Currently, there is a small, single-bay, front-gabled entry porch supported
by replacement wooden posts, and a large, nonhistoric-age wooden deck has been added to the
primary faÃ§ade. The windows are replacement 6/6 units, and the exterior is clad in horizontal
wooden siding. This structure lacks integrity of materials, design, workmanship, and feeling due to
its many alterations.

facing northeast.

100013883/100196

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
Structure B is a small circa 1900, wood-framed shed (Figure 63a). This structure is clad in wooden
board-and-batten siding with clapboards in the gable ends. It has a replacement metal roof, and its
door is no longer intact. Structure B lacks integrity of setting, feeling, and association as the original
building associated with this structure is no longer extant. Structure C is a large, circa 1935 barn
with a broken-gabled roof (Figure 63b). This structure has an enclosed, raised, finished storage
area and a large open implement/livestock storage area with an intervening central passage. The
exterior has been reclad in corrugated metal. This structure is of common design, lacks known
historic associations, and the exterior recladding detracts from its integrity of materials and
workmanship. None of the structures maintains any known historic associations, and they are not
recommended for NRHP inclusion under Criterion A, B, or C, either individually or as a group.

Archival Research

Archival research indicates that the site is associated with the Brooks family, specifically with Sallie
Brooks Grant in the 1930s and her daughter Annie Norris and her family from the 1940s through
the late twentieth century. Jessie Brooks (Sallieâs father) first acquired the property in 1881,
showing that the Brooks family was associated with this tract of land continuously from 1881
through the late twentieth century. As artifacts from the site indicate an early-twentieth-century
occupation, it is likely the site is associated with Sallie Brooks, her daughter Annie Norris, and/or
tenants. Archival research suggests there are no significant historical associations with this site. As
a result, the property is recommended not eligible under Criterion A or B.

Discussion and Recommendation

Site 41RK626 is a historic-aged farmstead located near the former community of Liberty. The site
consists of a renovated residential structure, a metal-clad barn, a small wooden shed, and a light
scatter of historic-aged domestic debris. The historic artifact assemblage from site 41RK626,
including a scatter of Ferris bricks, suggests an early-twentieth-century domestic occupation. None
of the structural resources maintains any known historic associations.

This sites dates to a well-documented period in local and regional history (Glander et al. 1984;
Skokan et al. 1997) and has no known associative significance that would qualify it for NRHP listing
under Criterion A, B, C, or D. It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that site 41RK626 is
ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP, and no further work is recommended.

Site 41RK627
Background
Site 41RK627 is a newly recorded historic homestead including a collapsed historic structure, a
cement well, and a surface artifact scatter. The site is situated upon a shoulderslope overlooking
Martin Lake at an approximate elevation of 330 ft msl. West-to-east-running drainages are located
north and south of the ridge where the site is located. The soils on-site consist of Latex very fine
sandy loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). Soils encountered during shovel testing consisted of
30 to 50 cm of brown loamy sand over red or strong brown clay. An excavated trench was located
35 m east of the site. This trench was filled with domestic debris including paint cans, buckets, glass
jars, and a barbecue grill. The majority of the site is situated in a young plantation pine forest. The
ground surface is mostly obscured within the site boundaries by pine duff and hardwood leaf litter
blanketing the site. Ornamental flowering plants were sparsely distributed across the site.

Work Performed

Site 41RK627 is associated with an HHPA discerned on an aerial photograph dating to 1935. A total
of 10 shovel tests were excavated in a cruciform pattern at roughly 20-m intervals to determine the
horizontal and vertical extent of the site. The cruciform was centered upon the collapsed residential
structure. All of the shovel tests were culturally sterile. A scatter of glass and metal artifacts was
identified on the surface. Based upon the horizontal distribution of surface finds, site 41RK627
extends roughly 40 m north to south by 22 m east to west and sparsely covers an area of about
704 m2 (Figure 64).

Artifact Assemblage

Artifacts observed on-site consisted entirely of historic domestic debris. Though no artifacts were
collected, several of the glass bottles observed on the ground surface had dateable makerâs marks.
The surface artifacts all suggest a mid-twentieth-century occupation. Two bottles exhibited marks
for the Knox Glass Bottle Company of Mississippi, which date from 1932 to 1953. One bottle had a
mark for the Owens Illinois Glass Company of Toledo, Ohio, which dates from 1929 to 1954. Two
bottles also had a makerâs mark for the Owens Illinois Glass Company but had different dates. One
of these bottles was marked with Duraglass, which postdates 1939, while the other postdates 1968
(Toulouse 1971).

Structural remnants associated with the collapsed structure included galvanized metal,
dimensional lumber, and electrical components. The well located on-site was lined with concrete
(Figure 65). Other items observed on the ground surface include a barbeque grill, metal buckets,
paint cans, and other scrap metal.

Archival Research
Archival records indicate that this site was likely associated with tenants of the Kangergas of
Henderson or Hardy Sanders, as they owned the parcel containing the site during the periods of
occupation. Any occupation during the Kangergasâ association with the site would have been that of
tenants as the Kangergas were known residents of Henderson. It is also possible that either site
may represent an occupation of area farmer Hardy Sanders. In either instance, the site does not
possess any historic significance that would qualify it for inclusion in the NRHP.

Discussion and Recommendations

Site 41RK627 is a historic-aged farmstead with a collapsed historic structure, a cement well, and a
surface artifact scatter. No standing structures were found on-site. Artifacts observed on-site
include a variety of temporally diagnostic bottles with production ranges spanning the midtwentieth century and likewise pointing to an occupation during this period. Site 41RK627 dates to
a well-documented period in local and regional history (Glander et al. 1984; Skokan et al. 1997) and
is unlikely to harbor significant data resources that could warrant NRHP listing under Criterion D.
The site lacks any associative significance that could qualify it for NRHP listing under Criterion A or
B. For these reasons, site 41RK627 is thought to be ineligible for NRHP inclusion, and no further
work is recommended.

Site 41RK628
Background
Site 41RK628 is a newly recorded historic homestead consisting of a surface and subsurface scatter
of historic-aged domestic debris and a surface brick scatter that is likely the remains of a chimney.
The site is located on a shoulderslope, which slopes toward the north and northeast toward Martin
Lake. The lakeshore is about 100 m north of the site at an approximate elevation of 320 ft msl. Soils
on-site consist of Sawlit-Sawtown complex, 0 to 2 percent slopes and Woodtell loam, 5 to
15 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). Soils encountered during shovel testing consisted of 20 to 40 cm of
pale brown sandy loam over reddish brown or strong brown clay subsoil. Clay soils were present
very near the surface in the southern portion of the site.
Two presumably man-made ditches were located within the southern portion of the site. These
ditches are parallel and oriented east to west. An old roadway, oriented east to west, is located
approximately 20 m south of the site.

Work Performed

Site 41RK628 is associated with an HHPA discerned on an aerial photograph dating to 1935. A total
of 17 shovel tests were excavated in a cruciform pattern at 15-m intervals to determine the
horizontal and vertical extent of the site. Of the 17 shovel tests excavated, 7 were culturally positive
yielding 65 artifacts. Shovel Test 2 yielded 53 artifacts, and Shovel Test 15 yielded 6. Shovel Test 6
yielded 2 artifacts, while shovel tests 5, 8, 11, and 12 yielded 1 artifact each. Based upon the
horizontal distribution of surface and subsurface finds, site 41RK628 extends 60 m north-south by
90 m east-west and covers an area of roughly 3,750 m2 (Figure 66).

Artifact Assemblage

The artifact assemblage recovered from site 41RK628 consists entirely of historic domestic debris.
A total of 65 ceramic, glass, and metal artifacts were recovered from the site. The artifacts
recovered from the site are presented below, differentiated by material type.

The ceramic assemblage is composed of five ironstone sherds. One of the sherds is decalcomania.
One of the specimens is molded, while the other three are undecorated. The decalcomania sherd
has an âLâ on the base, while the molded sherd has a dot pattern along the rim edge.

The glass assemblage is composed of 53 shards. There are 8 bottle shards in the assemblage. Two of
these are amber, while 4 are aqua-tinted with bubbles, and 1 is colorless. The last bottle shard is a
colorless basal shard with a valve mark and bubble inclusions. There are 32 glass vessel shards.

100013883/100196

253

6. Survey Results
One of the shards is aqua tinted with bubble inclusions, 11 are colorless with bubble inclusions, 11
are colorless, 8 are solarized, and 1 is opaline milk glass. The assemblage also includes 1 colorless
jar shard with bubble inclusions, 5 colorless glass chimney lamp shards, 3 aqua-tinted window
glass shards, and 4 colorless window glass shards.

The metal artifact assemblage is composed of seven artifacts, one of brass and six of iron. The brass
artifact is a clothing eyelet. The rest of the metal artifacts are iron: one cut nail fragment, two
complete wire nails, two wire nail fragments, and one plow blade fragment.

The artifacts recovered are consistent with an early-twentieth-century occupation. Glass with
bubble inclusions generally predates 1920 (Polak 2000). Milk glass tableware was most popular
during the period from the 1870s to the 1940s and remains in production today (Toulouse 1971).
Glass with valve marks on the base typically postdate 1900 (SHA 2010). Solarized glass usually
dates from 1880 to 1918 (Stelle 2010). Wire nails supplanted cut nails in popularity during the last
decade of the nineteenth century (Adams 2002). Ironstone tableware enjoyed its greatest
popularity during the years 1850â1920, but is still produced today. Decalcomania, which is an
overglaze decoration technique, was first introduced around 1860 and remained a common
decorative technique after 1885 (Rosenberg and Kvietok 1981).

In addition to the materials recovered from a subsurface context, a scatter of machine-made bricks
was found at the summit of the landform. This brick scatter may be the location of a chimney
(Figure 67) and the former residential structure at site 41RK628.

Liberty Deposit Mine Area

Archival Research
Archival records suggest that this site was associated with the Peter Gray family or that of his
tenants. Peter Gray and his heirs owned the property from 1891 through the mid-twentieth
century. Although Gray was an African American farmer, a group underrepresented in the historical
record, his acquisition of the property postdates the early freedman farms established in the area.
The site does not possess any known historic associations that would qualify it for inclusion in the
NRHP.

Discussion and Recommendations

Site 41RK628 is a historic homestead consisting of a relatively dense surface and subsurface scatter
of historic-aged domestic debris and a brick scatter that is likely the remains of a chimney. No
standing structures were found on-site. Artifacts recovered and observed on-site suggest an earlytwentieth-century domestic occupation. Site 41RK628 dates to a well-documented period in local
and regional history (Glander et al. 1984; Skokan et al. 1997) and is unlikely to harbor significant
data resources that could warrant NRHP listing under Criteria D. The site lacks any associative
significance that could qualify it for NRHP listing under Criterion A or B. For these reasons, site
41RK628 is thought to be ineligible for NRHP inclusion, and no further work is recommended.

Site 41RK629 (Excluded from the permit area)
Background

Site 41RK629 appears to represent a multicomponent Middle Archaic-Transitional Archaic/Late
Prehistoric site, located on a shoulderslope roughly 60 m west of Martin Lake. The landform slopes
abruptly eastward to the Martin Lake shoreline. A power line corridor bisects the site east to west.
The site is situated at an elevation of approximately 330 ft msl. Soils on-site consist of Woodtell
loam, 5 to 15 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). Those encountered during shovel testing consisted of 20
to 60 cm of yellowish brown sand to dark brown sandy loam over brown or strong brown clay
subsoil. Clay soils are much more deeply buried downslope in the eastern portion of the site where
sandy sediments extend in depth as great as 70 cm below the ground surface. Ground surface
visibility was entirely obscured by pine duff and hardwood leaf litter.
Based on the distribution of positive shovel tests, the site extends 80 m north-south by 120 m eastwest and covers an area of roughly 2,827 m2 (Figure 68). The site lacked a surface expression.

100013883/100196

256

Liberty Deposit Mine Area

Work Performed
A total of 50 shovel tests were excavated across the landform harboring the site to determine its
horizontal and vertical limits. Of these shovel tests, 14 were culturally positive yielding 22
prehistoric artifacts and 2 fire-cracked rock fragments. Shovel tests 1, 13, 23, 24, 28, 38, and 39
yielded one artifact each while shovel tests 3, 8, 12, 20, and 21 yielded two. Shovel Test 2 yielded
three artifacts. Four artifacts were recovered from Shovel Test 11. Three artifacts were recovered
from Level 1 (0 to 10 cmbs). Eight artifacts were recovered from Level 2 (10 to 20 cmbs), while
eight artifacts were recovered from Level 3 (20 to 30 cmbs), and two artifacts were recovered from
Level 4 (30 to 40 cmbs). Two artifacts were recovered from levels 2â4 (10 to 40 cmbs), and one
artifact was recovered from Level 7 (60 to 70 cmbs).

Artifact Assemblage

The artifact assemblage is composed of 17 lithic artifacts, 5 prehistoric ceramic sherds, and 2 firecracked rocks. The lithic assemblage is composed of 2 tools, 1 core, and 14 nondiagnostic pieces of
lithic debitage. The 2 tools are a metaquartzite Gary dart point base and a utilized chert flake.

The extant portion of the Gary dart point base is 35.75 mm in length by 28.49 mm in width by
8.39 mm in maximum thickness. Its mass is 6.39 g. The distal tip is missing. The extant portion has a
triangular-shaped body with straight lateral edges, indistinct squared shoulders, and a contracting
stem. No evidence of utilization was identified under low-power microscopy. The Gary point base
suggests at least one occupation some time during the period from the Middle Archaic to the
Transitional Late Archaic. None of the other lithic artifacts were temporally diagnostic. The core is
silicified wood with flakes removed from both sides, and some cortex remaining on one side.

The debitage assemblage is composed of one thermally altered primary chert flake, one thermally
altered chert secondary flake, two thermally altered silicified wood secondary flakes, two silicified
wood secondary flakes, two thermally altered chert tertiary flakes, three chert tertiary flakes, two
silicified wood tertiary flakes, and one thermally altered metaquartzite tertiary flake.

Six prehistoric ceramic sherds were recovered from three shovel tests (shovel tests 2, 20, and 24).
During initial examination, it was determined that two sherds had fresh-break fitters that could be
paired with three of the recovered sherds, thereby reducing the number of analyzed sherds to
three. Analysis of their technological attributes indicates the presence of three different vessels.
One small, decorated body sherd (Lot 2) was paired with two other sherds from the same shovel
test level. Microscopic examination indicated that the sherd was from a pot manufactured with a
very fine to silty sandy clay to which crushed grog and hematite had been added. The sherd is
relatively thin averaging 4.2 mm in thickness, and had been fired in an oxidizing environment. Both
its exterior and interior surfaces had been dry-smoothed and left unburnished. Remnants of three

100013883/100196

engraved diagonal lines were noted. Unfortunately, not enough of the design motif is visible to
assign it to a particular typological category.

Two undecorated body sherds were also recovered. One body sherd (Lot 10) had been
manufactured with a very fine sandy to silty clay to which crushed grog and hematite had been
added. Both its exterior and interior surfaces had been dry-smoothed and left unburnished. The
sherd averaged 5.3 mm in thickness and had been fired in a partially reducing environment.
The paste fabric of the second undecorated body sherd (Lot 15) began with a very fine sandy clay to
which chunks of bone, grog, and larger-sized sand grains had been added. This sherd was much
thicker that the other sherds, averaging 10.5 mm in thickness. Its exterior and interior surfaces had
been dry-smoothed and left unburnished. It had been fired in a reducing environment.

The two fragments of fire-cracked rock are silicified wood. These thermally altered lithics were
recovered from two different shovel tests, one from Level 2 and the other from Level 3.

Discussion and Recommendations

The ceramic sherds recovered from site 41RK629 indicate at least one occupation during the Late
Prehistoric period. The Gary dart point base suggests the site was also occupied sometime during
the period from the Middle Archaic to the Transitional Late Archaic. The presence of thermally
altered lithic debitage and two fragments of fire-cracked rock suggest that the prehistoric
occupants utilized fire, possibly to heat treat lithic raw materials, or to process and/or consume
subsistence resources. This conclusion is strengthened by the presence of both ceramic sherds and
lithic tools on-site. The high artifact density and diversity, compared to other prehistoric sites
identified in the Liberty Deposit, suggest it resulted from a longer-term occupation or repeated
occupational episodes and saw a wider variety of activities. Additionally, the landform harboring
the site appears to have been stable.
These observations suggest further that significant data resources may have been preserved onsite. For these reasons, the NRHP eligibility status of site 41RK629 remains undetermined. It is
therefore recommended that mine-related impacts to this site be avoided. If this is not possible,
NRHP eligibility testing is recommended.

Site 41RK630
Background

Site 41RK630 is a historic farmstead consisting of four standing structures located on a broad
gently sloping shoulder, just below the summit, above Martin Lake at an elevation of approximately
340 ft msl. A large man-made pond at the head of an unnamed drainage is located roughly 50 m to
the northeast of the site. An electric power line corridor bisects the site east to west. The
intersection of CR 392 and a two-track roadway is located roughly 50 m west of the site boundaries.
100013883/100196

259

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
The two-track road skirts along the north edge of the site. Soils on-site consist of both Latex very
fine sandy loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes and Woodtell loam, 5 to 15 percent slopes (NRCS 2010).
Shovel testing revealed 20 to 50 cm of gray-brown sandy loam over yellowish brown or strong
brown clay.

Based upon the horizontal distribution of standing structures, structural remnants, and culturally
positive shovel tests, site 41RK630 extends 70 m north-south by 60 m east-west. The site
encompasses an area of roughly 4,200 m2 (Figure 69). There are four standing structures on-site.
The first is a residence located just south of the power line corridor. The residence is approximately
20 x 20 m in size. Two barns and an outhouse are located north of the power line corridor,
approximately 30 m from the residence. One barn is 5 x 10 m in size, while the other is 8 x 12 m.
The outhouse is situated approximately 25 m northeast of the residential structure and is 2 x 2 m in
size. Most of the structures are choked by briars and brushy vegetation. The majority of the site
area is very densely wooded, and modern debris is scattered across it. Vegetation at the site
consists of grasses within the power line corridor, as well as pines, sweetgum, and green briar
elsewhere. The ground surface is obscured by grasses within the power line corridor and by pine
duff and hardwood leaf litter elsewhere.

Work Performed

The site is associated with an HHPA that was discerned on an aerial photograph dating to 1935. A
total of 19 shovel tests were excavated in a cruciform pattern at roughly 10-m intervals to
determine the horizontal and vertical extent of the site. Of the 19 shovel tests excavated, 7 were
culturally positive, yielding 13 historic artifacts. Shovel tests 1 and 4 yielded three artifacts each,
while shovel tests 6, 9, 10, and 16 each yielded one artifact. Shovel Test 15 yielded a total of three
artifacts. One artifact was recovered from Level 1 (0 to 10 cmbs) while two were recovered from
Level 2 (10 to 20 cmbs), with three from Level 3 (20 to 30 cmbs), one from Level 4 (30 to 40 cmbs),
and five from both levels 5 (40 to 50 cmbs) and 7 (60 to 70 cmbs).

Artifact Assemblage

The artifact assemblage is represented by ceramic, glass, and metal artifacts. The artifacts
recovered from the site are presented below, differentiated by material type.
The two ceramic sherds recovered from the site are an undecorated semiporcelain sherd and an
Albany slip-glazed stoneware sherd.

The glass assemblage is comprised of nine shards. Two of these are embossed colorless vessel
shards with bubble inclusions and two are colorless vessel shards. Also included in this assemblage
is one colorless molded vessel shard, one colorless pattern-molded vessel shard, one solarized
vessel shard, one colorless chimney lamp glass shard, and one colorless window glass shard.
100013883/100196

260

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
Two metal artifacts, one wire spike and one wire nail, were recovered.

The artifacts recovered are consistent with a late-nineteenth- to early-twentieth-century
occupation. Stoneware with Albany slip glazes generally predate 1940 (Greer 1981). Solarized glass
dates from 1880 to 1918 (Stelle 2010), and glass with bubble inclusion generally predates 1920
(Polak 2000). In general, wire nails postdate 1890 (Adams 2002).

Historic Standing Structures

The 1958 USGS Minden topographic quadrangle shows a structure at this location, and there are
currently four standing structures at this site. These structures include a dwelling (A), two barns (B
and C), and an outhouse (D). Structure A is a circa 1890, L-plan single-family dwelling (Figure 70).
This structure is clad in wooden board-and-batten siding with clapboards in the gable ends. Most of
the doors and windows are no longer extant, but there are remnants of 6/6 wood-sash windows
and two paneled wooden doors with wooden screen doors in one gable end within a collapsed
porch. The structure has an exterior brick chimney on one of the secondary faÃ§ades. Structure B is a
front-gabled, three-pen, circa 1930 barn. This structure has a replacement metal roof with
horizontal wooden siding and is partially reclad in wooden paneling. Structure C is a circa 1900,
two-pen log barn (Figure 71a). This structure has saddle-notched construction with clapboards in
the gable ends. Structure D is a circa 1935 outhouse (Figure 71b). This structure has a shed roof
and replacement corrugated metal walls. The door is no longer extant.
None of the structures appears to qualify for the NRHP. Structures A and C lack integrity of
materials, design, and workmanship due to their derelict condition and partial collapse, and
Structures B and D do not possess architectural or design distinction. Despite their potential
association with the Ross family, nineteenth-century residents of the project vicinity, there is no
evidence that the Rosses were significant to local community development. The structures are not
recommended for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion A, B, or C.

Archival Research

Archival research indicates that it is likely the J.E. Ross family occupied this site, possibly as early as
1887. Standing structures at the site lend support to this suggestion, as they date to the late
nineteenth century. Artifacts recovered from the site suggest a late-nineteenth- to early-twentiethcentury occupation. The Ross family likely lived at this site until circa 1910, when the census
records show they had moved into Henderson. Although the Ross family continued to own the
property through the end of the twentieth century, it is likely that later occupations were associated
with tenants. Archival research suggests there are no significant historical associations with this
site. As a result, the property is recommended not eligible under Criterion A or B.

Discussion and Recommendations
Site 41RK630 is a historic-aged farmstead with an extant residential structure and three associated
outbuildings (two barns and an outhouse). None of these standing structures merits listing in the
NRHP. The site dates to a well-documented period in local and regional history (Glander et al. 1984;
Skokan et al. 1997) and has no known associative significance that would qualify it for NRHP listing
under Criterion A or B. It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that site 41RK630 is ineligible
for inclusion in the NRHP and that no further work is necessary.

Site 41RK631
Background

Site 41RK631 is a multiple component site consisting of a scatter of historic-aged domestic debris
and a sparse prehistoric lithic scatter. The site is situated upon a discrete knoll atop a broad ridge
summit at an elevation of 360 ft msl. The landform is bounded to the east and west by small,
unnamed drainages. The site is located 100 m south of an east-to-west-oriented well pad road. Soils
on-site consist of Latex very fine sandy loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). Soils encountered
during shovel testing consisted of 30 to 70 cm of yellow-brown sandy loam over red or strong
brown clay subsoil.

Based on the distribution of positive shovel tests, site 41RK631 extends 30 m north-south by 20 m
east-west and covers an area of roughly 300 m2 (Figure 72). The site is densely wooded with young
plantation pines interspersed with hardwoods. The underbrush is extremely dense. The ground
surface is entirely obscured within the site boundaries by pine duff.

Work Performed

A total of 12 shovel tests were excavated in a cruciform pattern at roughly 10-m intervals to
determine the horizontal and vertical extent of the site. Of the 12 shovel tests excavated, 3 were
culturally positive, yielding two prehistoric and two historic artifacts. Shovel Test 1 yielded one
historic and one prehistoric artifact. Shovel Test 7 yielded one prehistoric artifact, and Shovel Test
8 yielded one historic artifact. One prehistoric artifact and two historic artifacts were recovered
from Level 3 (20 to 30 cmbs), and one prehistoric artifact was recovered from Level 5 (40 to
50 cmbs).

Artifact Assemblage

A total of four artifacts were recovered. The historic artifacts are both glass; one is amber and the
other is green tinted. Both shards exhibit bubble inclusions. Glass with bubble inclusions generally
predates 1920 (Polak 2000).

100013883/100196

6. Survey Results
The prehistoric assemblage includes one metaquartzite secondary flake and one silicified wood
tertiary flake. The silicified wood specimen exhibits signs of thermal alteration. No temporally
diagnostic prehistoric materials were recovered.

Archival Research

A structure appears at this location on the 1935 aerial photograph, but is no longer present on the
1958 USGS Minden 15-minute topographic quadrangle. Archival research indicates that it is likely
the J.E. Ross family was associated with this site, possibly as early as 1887. Although the 1910
census records show they had moved into Henderson by that time, the Ross family continued to
own the property through the end of the twentieth century. Any occupations after 1910 were likely
associated with tenants. The paucity of artifacts recovered from this location further suggests it was
not a long-term occupation. Archival research suggests there are no significant historical
associations with this site. As a result, the property is recommended not eligible under Criterion A
or B.

Discussion and Recommendations

The origins of both the historic and prehistoric scatters remain uncertain. The low density of both
components suggests that they represent short-duration occupations. The glass artifacts suggest
the historic component dates to the early twentieth century. The low density of historic materials
on-site suggests that significant data resources from this occupation on not present on-site. The
historic component dates to a well-documented period in local and regional history (Glander et al.
1984; Skokan et al. 1997) and has no known associative significance that would qualify it for NRHP
listing under Criterion A or B.

The low density of prehistoric cultural material on-site along with an absence of carbonized
subsistence or fuel remains, diagnostic lithic tools, or prehistoric cultural features, indicates that
significant deposits have not been preserved on-site that could merit NRHP inclusion under
Criterion D. It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that the prehistoric component of site
41RK631 is ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP, and no further work is recommended.

Site 41RK632
Background

Site 41RK632 is a newly recorded historic homestead including a concrete-lined well, ornamental
flowering plants (presumably daffodils), and a subsurface artifact scatter. The site sits upon a
shoulder between two unnamed drainages that flow under FM 2658 and into Martin Lake. One of
these drainages runs directly adjacent to the southern site boundary. The site is situated at an
elevation of 335 ft msl. Soils within the site boundaries consist of Sawlit-Sawton complex, 0 to
4 percent slopes and Woodtell loam, 5 to 15 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). Typical soils encountered
100013883/100196

267

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
during shovel testing consisted of 20 to 40 cm of brown sandy loam over yellowish red or strong
brown clay.

Based upon surface expression, site 41RK632 extends 45 m north-south and 80 m southwestnortheast, and covers an area of about 1,256 m2 (Figure 73). The ground surface is mostly obscured
within the site boundaries by short grasses. Some surface visibility was afforded by gopher mounds
scattered across the landform. Information regarding this site was obtained from the current
landowner, Euel Faulkner. Mr. Faulkner indicated that his wife was born in the house that once
stood at this location. Her family was said to have occupied the residence during the early twentieth
century. Mr. Faulkner indicated that the structure was moved to a different location after the
Second World War.

Work Performed

Site 41RK632 is associated with an HHPA discerned on an aerial photograph dating to 1935. A total
of 13 shovel tests were excavated in a cruciform pattern at 10- to 20-m intervals to determine the
horizontal and vertical extent of the site. Of the 13 shovel tests excavated, 5 were culturally positive
yielding 34 historic artifacts. Shovel Test 2 yielded 1 artifact, while Shovel Test 5 yielded 5, and
Shovel Test 9 yielded 8. Shovel Test 10 yielded 4 artifacts, and Shovel Test 13 yielded 16 artifacts.
Sixteen artifacts were recovered from Level 1 (0 to 10 cmbs), and 13 were recovered from Level 2
(10 to 20 cmbs). Three artifacts were obtained from Level 3 (20 to 30 cmbs), and two came from
Level 4 (30 to 40 cmbs). The shovel testing cruciform was centered upon the summit of the
landform, with the well 10 m to the south.

Artifact Assemblage

The artifact assemblage recovered from site 41RK632 consists entirely of historic domestic debris.
A total of 34 artifacts were recovered during site delineation efforts. The artifact assemblage,
composed of ceramic, glass, metal, and asbestos materials, is presented below differentiated by
type.

The ceramic assemblage includes one ironstone sherd with an unidentifiable makerâs mark, two
undecorated ironstone sherds, and one stoneware sherd with an Albany glaze on the interior and
exterior.
The glass assemblage is composed of 17 shards, including 1 colorless bottle shard with a makerâs
mark and bubble inclusions, 1 amber bottle shard with bubble inclusions, 4 colorless vessel shards,
1 solarized glass shard with bubble inclusions, 1 colorless jar shard with bubble inclusions, 1
colorless chimney lamp glass shard, and 8 shards of aqua-tinted window glass.

100013883/100196

268

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
The metal assemblage is composed of 10 artifacts consisting of 1 cut nail, 2 wire nails, and 4 other
nails that were too corroded to identify. The remaining 3 metal artifacts are unidentifiable iron
fragments.
Three small asbestos tile fragments were also recovered.

The artifact assemblage is consistent with an early-twentieth-century occupation. Stoneware with
an Albany-type slip glaze generally predates 1940 (Greer 1981). Solarized glass dates from 1880 to
1918 (Stelle 2010), and glass with bubble inclusions generally predates 1920 (Polak 2000). Wire
nails replaced cut nails during the last decade of the nineteenth century (Adams 2002).

Archival Research

A structure appears at this location on the 1935 aerial photograph, but is no longer present on the
1958 USGS Minden 15-minute topographic quadrangle. According to the current landowner, his
wifeâs family occupied a house at this location in the early twentieth century, but the house was
moved to another location sometime after World War II.

Archival evidence suggests that site 41RK632 was associated with the M.E. Watson family from
1915 through the twentieth century. Watson or his sons Percy and Malvin may have occupied the
property during that time. Although it is possible that tenants, unknown owners, or T.J. and M.A.
Trammell could have occupied the property during the nineteenth century, archeological evidence
indicates the site was occupied during the early to mid-twentieth century. Archival research
suggests there are no significant historical associations with this site. As a result, the property is
recommended not eligible under Criterion A or B.

Discussion and Recommendations

Site 41RK632 is a historic-aged residential site consisting of a concrete-lined well, a scatter of
ornamental flowering plants, and a subsurface scatter of domestic artifacts. No standing structures
are present within the site boundaries. The historic artifact assemblage, including temporally
diagnostic ceramic and glass specimens, suggests an early-twentieth-century occupation. According
to the current landowner, the former residence was owned by his wifeâs family in the early
twentieth century and was subsequently removed from this location sometime after World War II
(personal communication with current landowner Euel Faulkner, April 2010). This site dates to a
well-documented period in local and regional history (Glander et al. 1984; Skokan et al. 1997) and
has no known associative significance that would qualify it for NRHP listing under Criterion A or B.
It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that site 41RK632 is ineligible for inclusion in the
NRHP and that no further work is necessary.

Site 41RK633
Background
Site 41RK633 is a newly recorded historic-aged homestead that has several cement foundations, a
pumphouse, as well as a surface and subsurface artifact scatter. The site is bounded on its north
edge by a small unnamed drainage that crosses FM 2658 just east of the site. The site is situated on
a relatively level shoulder at an approximate elevation of 340 ft msl. Soils within the site
boundaries consist of Woodtell loam, 5 to 15 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). Soils encountered during
shovel testing consisted of 20 to 30 cm of gray to yellow-brown silty loam over strong brown clay.

Based upon surface expression and the distribution of positive shovel tests, site 41RK633 extends
40 m north to south by 120 m east to west, covering an area of roughly 3,600 m2 (Figure 74). The
site is located in open terrain with a few large pines and hardwood trees offering some shade. A
single crepe myrtle was observed near the residence foundation. Ornamental flowering plants were
also observed amongst the foundations. The ground surface is obscured by short grasses. Rodent
mounds offered limited surface visibility.

Information regarding this site was obtained from the current landowner, Euel Faulkner (personal
communication, April 2010). Mr. Faulkner indicated that his wife spent most of her childhood in the
house that once stood on this spot. Her family was said to have occupied the residence during the
mid-twentieth century. Mr. Faulkner indicated that the structure was moved to a different location
after the Second World War.

Work Performed

Site 41RK633 is associated with an HHPA discerned on an aerial photograph dating to 1935. A total
of 15 shovel tests were excavated in a cruciform pattern at 10- to 20-m intervals to determine the
horizontal and vertical extent of the site. Of the 15 shovel tests excavated, 3 tests were culturally
positive yielding nine historic artifacts and one modern item. Shovel Test 7 resulted in the recovery
of one artifact, while Shovel Test 9 yielded six artifacts and one modern item. Shovel Test 10 yielded
two artifacts. Seven artifacts and a modern item were recovered from Level 1 (0 to 10 cmbs), and
two artifacts were recovered from Level 2 (10 to 20 cmbs).

Artifact Assemblage

A total of nine historic artifacts were recovered. This assemblage includes ceramic, glass, and metal
items, along with a modern fragment of plastic. The assemblage consists of one undecorated
ironstone sherd, two aqua-tinted window glass shards, one iron wire nail with a lead cap, one cut
nail, one wire nail, and three unidentified iron fragments. Present at the site was a length of clay
pipe manufactured by W.S. Dickey at the Texarkana plant.
100013883/100196

6. Survey Results
The artifacts recovered and observed during site delineation are consistent with an early- to
middle-twentieth-century occupation. A few electrification components, which likely date to the
1960s, were observed in the wooden pumphouse. Wire nails replaced cut nails during the 1890s
(Adams 2002). The clay sewer pipe observed on the ground surface postdates 1905, when the W.S.
Dickey Clay Manufacturing Co. was founded (U.S. Genweb Projects 2010).

Archival Research

According to the current landowner, his wifeâs family occupied a house somewhere in the vicinity
during the early twentieth century, but the house was moved to another location sometime after
World War II.

Archival evidence suggests that site 41RK632 was associated with the M.E. Watson family from
1915 through the twentieth century. Watson or his sons Percy and Malvin may have occupied the
property during that time. Although it is possible that tenants, unknown owners, or T.J. and M.A.
Trammell could have occupied the property during the nineteenth century, archeological evidence
indicates the site was occupied during the early to mid-twentieth century. Archival research
suggests there are no significant historical associations with this site. As a result, the property is
recommended not eligible under Criterion A or B.

Discussion and Recommendations

Site 41RK633 is a historic-aged residence consisting of concrete foundations, ornamental flowering
plants, and a subsurface scatter of domestic artifacts. The only extant structure on-site is a small
wooden pumphouse near the northwestern site boundary (Figure 75). The historic artifact
assemblage indicates an early- to mid-twentieth-century occupation. Further, according to the
current landowner, the former residence was removed from this location sometime after World
War II. This site dates to a well-documented period in local and regional history (Glander et al.
1984; Skokan et al. 1997) and has no known associative significance that would qualify it for NRHP
listing under Criterion A or B. It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that site 41RK633 is
ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and that no further work is necessary.

Site 41RK635
Background
Site 41RK635 is a newly recorded historic subsurface artifact scatter. The site sits on a ridge
shoulder between two unnamed drainages that merge into a single course prior to emptying into
Martin Lake at an elevation of about 340 ft msl. Soils within the site boundaries consist of Woodtell
loam, 5 to 15 percent slopes and Latex very fine sandy loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes (NRCS 2010).
Those encountered during shovel testing typically consisted of 20 to 50 cm of pale brown sandy
loam over red or reddish brown clay.
Based upon the horizontal distribution of surface finds, site 41RK635 extends roughly 40 m north
to south by 45 m east to west, and covers an area of about 1,435 m2 (Figure 76). The site is located
in open pastureland. The primary vegetation on-site consists of mown grasses, which mostly
obscured the ground surface. Surface visibility was somewhat better along the eastern slope.

Work Performed
Site 41RK635 is associated with an HHPA discerned on an aerial photograph dating to 1935. A total
of 10 shovel tests were excavated in a cruciform pattern at roughly 15-m intervals to determine the
horizontal and vertical extent of the site. Of the 10 shovel tests excavated, 5 were culturally
positive, yielding 13 historic artifacts and 2 carbon samples. One artifact was collected from the
ground surface. Shovel Test 1 yielded 1 artifact, while shovel tests 4 and 9 yielded 2 each. Shovel
Test 5 yielded 6 artifacts, and Shovel Test 7 yielded 3. One artifact was recovered from Level 1 (0 to
10 cmbs), while 7 came from Level 2 (10 to 20 cmbs), and 5 came from Level 3 (20 to 30 cmbs). One
artifact was recovered from Level 4 (30 to 40 cmbs). The shovel test cruciform was centered upon
the summit of the landform.

Artifact Assemblage

A total of 13 artifacts were recovered including ceramic, glass, and metal specimens. Two carbon
specimens were also collected. The assemblage is presented below differentiated by type.

The ceramic assemblage is composed of three ironstone sherds. One of the sherds exhibits an
unidentifiable decalcomania design, while the other two are undecorated.

The glass assemblage is composed of one colorless vessel shard with bubble inclusions, one
colorless vessel shard, one green-tinted Depression glass shard, one aqua-tinted window glass
shard, and two colorless window glass shards.
The metal assemblage is composed of three wire nail fragments and one iron can.

The artifacts recovered are consistent with an early to mid-twentieth-century occupation. Glass
with bubble inclusions generally predates 1920 (Polak 2000). Depression glass dates between 1920
and 1970 (Schroy 2007). Wire nails replaced cut ones during the 1890s (Adams 2002).
Decalcomania, which is an overglaze decoration technique, was first introduced around 1860, and
remained a common decorative technique after 1885 (Rosenberg and Kvietok 1981).

Archival Research

Although a structure appears in the vicinity of this site in 1935, nothing appears at this location on
the 1958 USGS Minden 15-minute topographic quadrangle. The chain of title data that Luminant
provided has a gap from before 1894, when Marion (Marvin) and Mattie Adams conveyed the
property to her brother, Gill Jones. Jones owned the property until 1901, and then Miller Adams had
it for a year. Although either of them could have lived on the property, the Adams family seems to
have had other property in the area where they could have been living, and tenants would have
been associated with the site during this time. Artifacts indicate an early- to mid-twentieth-century
occupation. During this time, T.J. Wright (1907â1918), B.E. Watson (1918â1923), and Walter Young
(1923â1944) owned the property. It is likely Wright lived on other property he owned in the area,
100013883/100196

276

6. Survey Results
and Watson was only associated with the property for a brief period. Young may have lived on the
tract after his acquisition of it, and the subsequent owners, Jack and Nona Martin, constructed a
house on the property in 1956, although it is not depicted on the 1958 USGS Minden 15-minute
topographic quadrangle of the area. Archival research suggests there are no significant historical
associations with this site. As a result, the property is recommended not eligible under Criterion A
or B.

Discussion and Recommendations

Site 41RK635 is a historic site consisting of a sparse surface and subsurface scatter of domestic
debris. No standing structures were found within the site boundaries. The historic artifact
assemblage indicates an early- to mid-twentieth-century domestic occupation. This site dates to a
well-documented period in local and regional history (Glander et al. 1984; Skokan et al. 1997) and
has no known associative significance that would qualify it for NRHP listing under Criterion A or B.
It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that site 41RK627 is ineligible for inclusion in the
NRHP and that no further work is necessary.

Site 41RK636
Background

Site 41RK636 is a newly recorded historic farmstead consisting of a surface scatter of structural
debris, a collapsed shed, foundation piers, and a brick scatter. The site is situated on a level
shoulder at an elevation of 340 ft msl. Soils within the site boundaries consist of Woodtell loam, 5 to
15 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). Those encountered in shovel tests consisted of 10 to 50 cm of pale
brown sandy loam over reddish brown sandy clay.

Based upon surface expression and the distribution of positive shovel tests, site 41RK609 extends
roughly 200 m east to west by 170 m north to south and covers an area of roughly 27,000 m2
(Figure 77). The site is situated primarily in a semiopen horse pasture, though areas of dense
hardwoods and briars cover the southern extremities. The ground surface is obscured across most
of the site by a dense understory, hardwood leaf litter, and grasses. Areas of good ground surface
visibility are present along the northern site edge where a dense surface artifact scatter was
identified.

Work Performed

Site 41RK636 is associated with a complex HHPA discerned on an aerial photograph dating to 1935.
A total of 36 shovel tests were excavated at 15- to 20-m intervals to determine the horizontal and
vertical extent of the site. Of the 36 shovel tests excavated, 3 were culturally positive, yielding seven
historic artifacts and one carbon sample. Shovel Test 9 yielded four artifacts, while Shovel Test 20
100013883/100196

yielded one. Shovel Test 24 yielded three artifacts. Four of the artifacts were recovered from Level
2 (10 to 20 cmbs), while three artifacts came from Level 4 (30 to 40 cmbs), and one artifact came
from Level 7 (60 to 70 cmbs). Seventeen artifacts were recovered from the ground surface. A
partially collapsed shed was identified near the center of the site (Figure 78). A brick scatter and a
pair of sandstone foundation piers were observed approximately 40 m north of the southern site
boundary.

Artifact Assemblage
A total of 25 artifacts were recovered. These consist of ceramic, glass, brick, and metal specimens,
as well as a single carbon sample. The assemblage is presented below differentiated by type.
The ceramic assemblage is composed of nine sherds. One is a molded ironstone sherd with a yellow
glaze. One sherd is undecorated ironstone. Seven are stoneware sherds, four with a brown slip on
the interior and exterior, and three with an Albany slip glaze on the interior and exterior.

The glass assemblage is composed of nine complete vessels or shards and includes an aqua-tinted
Dr. Pepper bottle shard with an applied color label (ACL), a complete green 7-UP bottle with an
ACL, a complete colorless Nehi soda bottle with an ACL, one colorless molded vessel shard with
bubble inclusions, one colorless vessel shard, one solarized vessel shard with an unidentifiable
makerâs mark, one opaline jar lid liner shard, and two aqua-tinted window glass shards.
100013883/100196

279

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
The brick assemblage is composed of two machine-made fragments. These fragments were
collected from the brick scatter located in the southern portion of the site and are likely associated
with a former residential structure located in the vicinity.

The metal assemblage is composed of four artifacts, including one wire nail, one fence staple, and
two unidentified iron fragments. One carbon sample was also collected.

The artifacts recovered are consistent with an early- to mid-twentieth-century occupation.
Solarized glass dates between 1880 and 1918 (Stelle 2010), and glass with bubbles predates 1920
(Polak 2000). Stoneware with an Albany-type slip glaze generally predates 1940 (Stelle 2010). In
general, wire nails postdate 1890 (Adams 2002). Three of the bottles collected from the surface had
ACLs and were datable. The Dr. Pepper bottle postdates 1950 (dr.peppermuseum.com 2010). The
7-UP bottle postdates 1929 (7up.com 2010) and the Nehi bottle postdates 1924
(rccolainternational.com 2010). Opaline glass lid liners were introduced around 1869 (Stelle 2001).

Archival Research

A structure appears on the 1935 aerial photograph of this area, but is not depicted on the 1958
USGS Minden 15-minute topographic quadrangle. Archival research indicates there is a gap in the
Luminant-provided chain of title records from 1856 until 1888 when Jesse Brooks bought the
property from J.C. Hickey and T.J. Trammell. The Brooks family kept the property until 1900, when
they sold it to William Pollard, an African American farmer. Both the Brooks family (sites 41RK626,
41RK611, 41RK647, 41RK651, and 41RK653) and the Pollard family (sites 41RK609 and 41RK649)
owned other land within the project area, suggesting either family could have been associated with
occupation of this tract or could have rented it to tenants. The Pollards kept the tract through the
mid-twentieth century. Artifacts recovered from this site indicate an early- to mid-twentiethcentury occupation date, suggesting it was associated with the Pollards or tenants. Although this
site is associated with African American property owners in this region, additional archival
research is unlikely to provide additional specific information about the history of this site. As a
result, this site is recommended not eligible under Criterion A or B.

Discussion and Recommendations

Site 41RK636 is a historic-aged farmstead consisting of a surface scatter of structural debris, a
collapsed shed, foundation piers, and a brick scatter. No structures are extant. The materials
observed and recovered on-site point to an early- to mid-twentieth-century occupation. As such, the
site dates to a well-documented period in local and regional history (Glander et al. 1984; Skokan et
al. 1997) and has no known associative significance that would qualify it for NRHP listing under
Criterion A or B. It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that site 41RK636 is ineligible for
inclusion in the NRHP and that no further work is necessary.

Site 41RK637
Background
Site 41RK637 is a historic homestead consisting of a standing residential structure, a brick-lined
well, and a dense scatter of domestic debris. The site is positioned on a gently sloping ridge summit
at an elevation of approximately 370 ft msl. County Road 326 runs along the northern boundary of
the site. Soils within the site boundaries consist of both Latex very fine sandy loam, 1 to 3 percent
slopes (NRCS 2010). Shovel testing revealed 30 to 80 cm of yellowish brown sandy loam over red
or reddish brown clay.

Based upon surface expression and the distribution of positive shovel tests, site 41RK637 extends
90 m north-south by 240 m east-west. The site encompasses an area of roughly 21,600 m2 (Figure
79). The residence is located just east of the site center and is approximately 7 x 10 m in size
(figures 80 and 81a). A covered porch faces north to the county road. The residential structure, like
the majority of the site, is choked by briars and viney vegetation on three sides. Modern trash,
including a 1969 Volkswagen bus and a couch, filled the front yard. A concrete-lined well with a
small, adjacent flat-topped brick platform is located approximately 80 m west of the residence
(Figure 81b). A scatter of bricks was observed strewn between the house and well. The majority of
the site area is very densely wooded. Vegetation at the site consists of tall grasses in the more open
areas and a variety of hardwood trees in the forested portions with a dense brushy understory. The
ground surface is obscured by grasses and hardwood leaf litter.

Work Performed

The site is associated with a complex of HHPAs discerned on an aerial photograph from 1935 and
the 1958 Minden 15-minute USGS topographic quadrangle. A total of 37 shovel tests were
excavated in a cruciform pattern at 10- to 15-m intervals to determine the horizontal and vertical
extent of the site. Of these shovel tests, 19 were culturally positive, yielding 161 artifacts. Shovel
tests 5, 10, 21, 26, 30, 32, and 33 yielded 1 artifact each. Shovel tests 3 and 28 yielded 2 each. Shovel
tests 1, 12, and 14 yielded 3 artifacts each. Shovel Test 29 yielded 4 artifacts, while Shovel Test 25
yielded 6, and Shovel Test 35 yielded 7. Shovel Test 11 yielded 8 artifacts, while Shovel Test 17
yielded 9, and Shovel Test 36 yielded 20. Shovel Test 31 yielded 87. Ten artifacts were recovered
from Level 1 (0 to 10 cmbs), while 19 were recovered from Level 2 (10 to 20 cmbs), and 27 were
recovered from Level 3 (20 to 30 cmbs). Eleven artifacts came from levels 1â3 (0 to 30 cmbs).
Twelve artifacts came from Level 4 (30 to 40 cmbs). Eighty artifacts came from levels 1â5 (0 to
50 cmbs). Two artifacts came from Level 7 (60 to 70 cmbs). Two of the shovel tests conducted
during site delineation efforts were not dug in 10-cm levels. Due to the large number of glass shards
recovered from these tests, discrete levels could not be maintained. Additionally, four artifacts were
recovered from the surface.

Artifact Assemblage
The artifact assemblage recovered from site 41RK637 consists of 165 artifacts and includes
specimens of ceramic, glass, brick, metal, and rubber/leather. The artifacts recovered from the site
are presented below, differentiated by material type.

The ceramic assemblage is composed of 12 sherds and includes 1 semiporcelain painted figure
sherd, 1 ironstone sherd with a molded scalloped rim, 1 ironstone sherd with molded ribbing, 4
undecorated ironstone sherds, 1 stoneware sherd with an Albany slip glaze, 1 stoneware sherd
with an alkaline glaze, 2 stoneware sherds with a Bristol glaze (1 of which is molded), and 1 coarse
earthenware terra cotta sherd.

The glass assemblage is composed of 118 shards. Twelve are bottle shards consisting of 1
embossed amber bottle shard with bubble inclusions, 1 embossed colorless bottle shard with
bubble inclusions, 1 molded colorless shard with bubble inclusions, 1 pattern-molded colorless
shard with bubble inclusions, 1 colorless shard with bubble inclusions, 1 colorless double-ring
finish shard with bubble inclusions, 3 amber shards with bubble inclusions, and 3 amber shards.
There are 45 vessel glass shards in the assemblage: 1 aqua-tinted molded shard, 4 colorless molded
shards, 1 solarized molded shard with bubble inclusions, 1 solarized molded shard, 3 molded
opaline shards, 1 pattern-molded colorless shard, 1 solarized shard with an unidentifiable
dragonfly pattern, 1 aqua shard with bubble inclusions, 1 aqua-tinted shard, 1 cobalt shard with
bubble inclusions, 8 colorless shards with bubble inclusions, 15 colorless shards, 1 solarized shard
with bubble inclusions, 2 solarized shards, 1 green-tinted shard with bubble inclusions, 1 greentinted shard, 1 opaline milk glass shard, and 1 yellow-tinted shard. There are 7 jar lid liner shards,
15 aqua-tinted window glass shards, and 38 colorless window glass shards. There is also 1 colorless
jar shard with bubble inclusions.

A total of 10 brick fragments were recovered including 4 hand-made fragments, 1 hand-made brick
fragment with an alkaline glaze, 4 machine-made brick fragments, and 1 machine-made fragment
from a Ferris brick.
The metal assemblage is composed of 23 artifacts consisting of 1 iron two-piece stud button, 4 iron
can fragments, 7 wire nails, 1 rebar fragment, 1 fence staple, and 9 unidentifiable iron fragments.
Also included in the assemblage is a shoe fragment made of rubber and leather.

The artifacts recovered are consistent with a late-nineteenth- to early-twentieth-century
occupation. Stoneware with an Albany-type slip glaze generally predates 1940 (Stelle 2010). Glass
with bubble inclusions predates 1920 (Polak 2000), and solarized glass dates between 1880 and
1918 (Stelle 2010). Jar lid liners postdate 1867 (Toulouse 1971). Hand-made bricks typically
predate 1900, and bricks with the Ferris makerâs mark date between 1901 and 1923 (Steinbomer
1981). In general, wire nails postdate 1890 (Adams 2002).

Historic Standing Structures
A structure appears at this location on the 1935 aerial photograph, in a 1947 plat associated with
partitioning of the land, and on the 1958 USGS Minden 15-minute topographic quadrangle. In
addition, a circa 1930 dwelling is still located at this site. This structure is a wood-framed, frontgabled bungalow with a full-width, projecting, front-gabled entry porch. The roof is clad in
composite shingles and has exposed rafter tails. The primary entry is centrally located within the
porch, and the door is no longer extant. The porch has a wooden floor, and the original porch
supports have been replaced with wooden posts. The windows are covered, and many are no
longer extant. Those remaining windows are replacement metal-sash units. The exterior is clad in
wooden drop siding. The replacement porch supports and windows detract from this structureâs
integrity of materials, design, workmanship, and feeling. Also, the dwelling is of common design and
lacks architectural distinction. Though the house appears to maintain associations with the
Menefee family, early African American residents of the former community of Liberty or Chapel Hill,
it does not date from their original occupation in the area nor does it appear to maintain
associations with African American settlement or history in the region. Thus, this structure is not
recommended for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion A, B, or C.

Archival Research

Archival research indicates that that there is a gap in the chain of title records that Luminant
provided from 1856 until 1892 when Wesley Menefee bought the property from J.C. Hickey and
John M. Mays. Menefee and his family were associated with this tract through the twentieth century.
Menefee, an African American farmer, owned other tracts of land in the project area (see 41RK610
and 41RK617 discussions), which he purchased several years before this tract. The later purchase
of this tract suggests Menefeeâs homestead was elsewhere, and that this tract might have been
associated with his heirs or with tenants. Artifacts recovered from the site indicate a latenineteenth- to early-twentieth-century occupation, which would coincide with Menefeeâs
acquisition of the property. Although this site is associated with African American property owners
in this region, additional archival research is unlikely to provide additional specific information
about the history of this site. As a result, this site is recommended not eligible under Criterion A or
B.

Discussion and Recommendations

Site 41RK637 is a historic-aged homestead with an extant residential structure, a brick-lined well
and pumphouse, and a relatively dense scatter of domestic debris. The residential structure was
likely occupied in the very recent past. Judging from structural elements and artifacts recovered
and observed on-site, the farmstead was likely built and first occupied during the early twentieth
century. The site dates to a well-documented period in local and regional history (Glander et al.
1984; Skokan et al. 1997), and has no known associative significance that would qualify it for NRHP
100013883/100196

6. Survey Results
listing under Criterion A or B. It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that site 41RK637 is
ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP, and that no further work is necessary.

Site 41RK638
Background

Site 41RK638 is a newly recorded scatter of historic debris located on the summit of a broad ridge
at an approximate elevation of 370 ft msl. An unnamed drainage is roughly 100 m northwest of the
site. The site is densely wooded with rows of young planted pine trees that average 20 ft in height.
The ground surface visibility was obscured by pine duff. Soils within the site boundaries consist of
Latex very fine sandy loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). Those encountered in shovel tests
consisted of yellowish brown to reddish brown sandy loam over sandy clay of similar colors. Based
upon surface expression and the distribution of positive shovel tests, site 41RK638 extends roughly
80 m north to south by 40 m east to west and covers an area of roughly 2,826 m2 (Figure 82).

Work Performed

The site is associated with an HHPA that was discerned on a 1935 aerial photograph. A total of 13
shovel tests were excavated in a cruciform patter at 20-m intervals to determine the horizontal and
vertical extent of the site. Of the 13 shovel tests excavated, five (1, 4, 7, 8, and 9) were culturally
positive, yielding a total of 14 historic artifacts. Shovel Test 7 yielded one artifact, and Shovel Test 1
yielded two. Shovel Test 4 contained three artifacts, while shovel tests 8 and 9 contained four
artifacts each. Seven artifacts were recovered from Level 2 (10 to 20 cmbs) and four artifacts were
obtained from Level 3 (20 to 30 cmbs). Three artifacts were recovered from Level 4 (30 to
40 cmbs).

Artifact Assemblage

The artifact assemblage includes ceramic, glass, and metal specimens. The artifacts recovered from
the site are presented below, differentiated by material type.

The ceramic assemblage is composed of three sherds consisting of one undecorated ironstone
sherd, one stoneware sherd with an Albany slip glaze, and one stoneware sherd with a Bristol glaze.
The glass assemblage is composed of 10 shards: 1 amber bottle shard with bubble inclusions, 1
amber bottle shard, 1 aqua-tinted bottle shard with bubble inclusions, 2 colorless bottle shards
with bubble inclusions, 1 colorless embossed bottle shard, 3 colorless vessel glass shards with
bubble inclusions, and 1 aqua-tinted window glass shard. One wire nail was also recovered.

100013883/100196

287

6. Survey Results
The artifacts recovered are consistent with a late-nineteenth- to early-twentieth-century
occupation. Stoneware with Albany-type slip glaze and Bristol glaze reached their height in
popularity prior to 1920 (Greer 1982). Bubble-included glass also generally predates 1920 (Polak
2000). Wire nails replaced cut nails during the last decade of the nineteenth century (Adams 2002).

Archival Research

Although a structure appears at this location on the 1935 aerial photograph, it is not depicted on
the 1958 USGS Minden 15-minute topographic quadrangle. Archival research indicates that it is
likely the J.E. Ross family was associated with this site, possibly as early as 1887. Although the 1910
census records show they had moved into Henderson by that time, the Ross family continued to
own the property through the end of the twentieth century. Artifacts recovered from the site
indicate a late-nineteenth- to early-twentieth-century occupation. Any occupations after 1910 were
likely associated with tenants. Archival research suggests there are no significant historical
associations with this site. As a result, the property is recommended not eligible under Criterion A
or B.

Discussion and Recommendations

Site 41RK638 appears to have resulted from a historic residential occupation during the late
nineteenth to early twentieth century. The site dates to a well-documented period in local and
regional history (Glander et al. 1984; Skokan et al. 1997) and has no known associative significance
that would qualify it for NRHP listing under Criterion A or B. It is the opinion of the Principal
Investigator that site 41RK638 is ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and that no further work is
necessary.

Site 41RK639
Background

Site 41RK639 is a newly recorded historic farmstead represented by a collapsed barn, a concretelined well, and a scatter of historic-aged materials. The site is situated on a shoulderslope at an
approximate elevation of 390 ft msl. The terrain is relatively level but slopes gently toward the
south. The site is adjacent to a sharp switchback on a two-track road. Soils within the site
boundaries consist of a combination of Kirvin gravelly fine sandy loam, 2 to 5 percent slopes and
Latex very fine sandy loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). Soils encountered during shovel
testing consisted of 20 to 70 cm of brown or reddish brown sandy loam over red or strong brown
clay.

100013883/100196

289

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
Based upon surface expression, site 41RK639 extends roughly 45 m north to south by 50 m east to
west and sparsely covers an area of about 2,000 m2 (Figure 83). The vegetation at the site includes
large pines and sweetgum trees with a large red cedar near a recently constructed corrugated
hunting cabin. The ground surface is mostly obscured within the site by tall grasses in the open
areas along the two-track road and pine duff and hardwood leaf litter in the wooded areas.

Work Performed

Site 41RK639 is associated with an HHPA discerned on an aerial photograph dating to 1935. A total
of 18 shovel tests were excavated in a cruciform pattern at 20-m intervals to determine the
horizontal and vertical extent of the site. Of the 18 shovel tests excavated, 3 (1, 2, and 17) were
culturally positive, yielding 19 historic artifacts. Shovel tests 1 and 2 each yielded one artifact, while
Shovel Test 17 yielded 17 artifacts. One artifact was recovered from Level 1 (0 to 10 cmbs); 1 was
recovered from Level 4 (30 to 40 cmbs). Seventeen artifacts were recovered from Level 5 (40 to
50 cmbs).

Artifact Assemblage

The artifact assemblage recovered from site 41RK639 consists entirely of historic domestic debris.
A total of 19 artifacts were recovered, which includes glass, brick, and metal specimens. The
assemblage is presented below, differentiated by material type.

The glass assemblage is composed of three shards: one amber bottle shard with bubble inclusions,
one solarized vessel shard with bubble inclusions, and one aqua-tint vessel shard with bubble
inclusions.
The brick assemblage is composed of 14 hand-made brick fragments. The metal assemblage is
composed of one iron possible tractor wheel hub and an unidentified iron fragment.

Structural remnants associated with the collapsed barn included galvanized metal, dimensional
lumber, and electrical components. The well located within the site boundaries was lined in
concrete. The structural debris pile associated with the barn appeared to have been partially
pushed into a pile by heavy machinery from the direction of the two-track roadway.
The artifacts present at the site are consistent with a late-nineteenth- to early-twentieth-century
occupation. Solarized glass dates between 1880 and 1918 (Stelle 2010), and glass with bubbles
generally predates 1920 (Polak 2000). Hand-made bricks typically predate 1900 (Steinbomer
1982). The presence of electrical components suggests the presumed former residence was
retrofitted.
This tract also includes one circa 1975 structure that does not meet the minimum requirements for
NRHP eligibility as it is not of historic-age or exceptional significance.

Archival Research
A structure is discernible at this location on the 1935 aerial photograph, but is not depicted on the
1958 USGS Minden 15-minute topographic quadrangle. The structure that currently stands at the
site is less than 50 years old, and was not evaluated. Archival research indicates this site is most
likely associated with the Jim and Julia Young homestead; they owned the property from 1905
through 1949, when they conveyed it as their âhome tractâ to their children. Although the site could
have been associated with T.J. Walling or Basil Garvin during the mid-nineteenth century, artifacts
recovered from the site indicate a late-nineteenth- to early-twentieth-century occupation date. The
Youngs did not own the property until 1905, but tenants could have occupied the property prior to
(and after) that date. Archival research suggests there are no significant historical associations with
this site. As a result, the property is recommended not eligible under Criterion A or B.

Discussion and Recommendations

Site 41RK639 is a historic-aged farmstead that includes a collapsed barn structure, a concrete-lined
well, and a scatter of domestic debris. No standing structures are extant. The artifact assemblage
suggests an early-twentieth-century domestic occupation. While the presence of hand-made brick
fragments suggests the former presence of a residence on-site, no identifiable remnant of a house
was found. This site dates to a well-documented period in local and regional history (Glander et al.
1984; Skokan et al. 1997) and has no known associative significance that would qualify it for NRHP
listing under Criterion A or B. It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that site 41RK639 is
ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and that no further work is necessary.

Site 41RK640
Background

Site 41RK640 is a newly recorded historic-aged homestead represented by a concrete foundation, a
well standpipe and ground rod, a septic tank, associated landscaping, and a surface scatter of bricks
and modern debris. The site is bounded on its west edge by the right of way edge of FM 2658. It is
situated on a relatively level shoulder at an approximate elevation of 355 ft msl. Soils within the site
boundaries consist of Latex very fine sandy loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). Soils
encountered during shovel testing consisted of 10 to 20 cm of brown and yellowish red sandy loam
over strong brown clay. Some areas with imported gravel were encountered.

Based on surface expression, site 41RK640 extends 35 m north to south by 60 m east to west, and
covers an area of roughly 2,100 m2 (Figure 84). The site is densely wooded with large pines and a
few hardwood trees. The ground surface and the concrete slab are entirely obscured by a thick
layer of pine duff.

100013883/100196

292

Liberty Deposit Mine Area

Work Performed
Site 41RK640 is associated with an HHPA discerned on a 1935 aerial photograph. A total of 10
shovel tests were excavated in a loose cruciform pattern in the vicinity of structural remnants, at
approximate 10-m intervals, to determine the horizontal and vertical extent of the site. Of the 10
shovel tests excavated, only Shovel Test 10 was culturally positive and yielded only one artifact.
The single subsurface artifact, a complete glass jar, was recovered from Level 1 (0 to 10 cmbs) in a
shovel test excavated within a surface scatter of modern refuse. Three additional artifacts were
collected from the surface.

The foundation was partially obscured by pine duff. Its edges were located by shoveling the duff
from its surface (Figure 85). This work revealed the foundation to be L-shaped and cover an area of
approximately 750 ft2. An asphalted driveway was found circling from the FM 2658 frontage
eastward along the southern edge of the foundation, before turning southward to the remnants of a
recently abandoned roadway. A standpipe and an associated ground rod indicate that the residence
used an electrified well. A single crepe myrtle tree was found near the well. The surface scatter of
bricks appears to represent recycled materials in addition to structural remains from the
residential structure represented by the extant foundations. This conclusion is based on the
presence of brick planters and walkways, in addition to leave-in-place forms used in the extant
concrete foundation, all formed with bricks similar to those observed in the scatter.

Artifact Assemblage
A total of four historic artifacts were recovered from site 41RK640. This assemblage includes glass
and brick specimens.

The glass assemblage consists of a complete amber glass jar with the metal lid still attached. The jar
has a makerâs mark for the Alexander H. Kerr Company.

The brick assemblage is a representative sample of bricks observed on the ground surface
associated with the foundation form and landscaping elements. Included in this assemblage are an
Acme Ferris brick and two different extruded bricks.

The artifacts recovered are consistent with a mid-twentieth-century occupation. The glass jar has a
makerâs mark for the Alexander H. Kerr Company, which postdates 1944 (Toulouse 1971). The
Acme Ferris brick postdates 1912 (Steinbomer 1982).

Archival Research

Archival records indicate that this site was likely associated with tenants of the Kangergas of
Henderson or Hardy Sanders, as they owned the parcel containing the site during the periods of
occupation. Any occupation during the Kangergasâ association with the site would have been that of
tenants as the Kangergas were known residents of Henderson. It is also possible that the site may
represent an occupation of area farmer Hardy Sanders. In either instance, the site does not possess
any historic significance that would qualify it for inclusion in the NRHP.

Discussion and Recommendations

Site 41RK640 is a historic-aged residential site represented by a brick-formed concrete foundation,
a well standpipe and associated ground rod, a septic tank, associated brick walkways and planters,
and a surface scatter of bricks and modern debris. No standing structures are within the boundaries
of the site. While some of the bricks observed on-site conceivably could predate the foundation, the
majority of the structural remains present suggest a middle- to late-twentieth-century occupation.
Site 41RK640 dates to a well-documented period in local and regional history (Glander et al. 1984;
Skokan et al. 1997) and is unlikely to harbor significant data resources that could warrant NRHP
listing under Criteria D. The site lacks any associative significance that could qualify it for NRHP
listing under Criterion A or B. For these reasons, site 41RK640 is thought to be ineligible for NRHP
inclusion, and no further work is recommended.

Site 41RK641
Background
Site 41RK641 is a newly recorded historic residential site consisting of a well and a surface scatter
of handmade and machine-made bricks. The site sits upon a ridge shoulder overlooking an
unnamed drainage of Dry Creek at an approximate elevation of 335 ft msl. Soils within the site
boundaries consist of Sawlit-Sawton complex, 0 to 4 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). Shovel testing at
the site revealed 20 to 30 cm of brown to yellowish brown sandy loam over dense hematite gravels
and bedrock.

Based upon surface expression, site 41RK641 extends roughly 54 m north to south by 42 m east to
west, and covers an area of about 1,809 m2 (Figure 86). The site is in a pine forest with a very dense
yaupon understory. Pine duff entirely obscured the ground surface across the site.

Work Performed

Site 41RK641 is not associated with an HHPA. A total of six shovel tests were excavated in a
cruciform pattern at 10- to 20-m intervals to determine the horizontal and vertical extent of the
site. All of these tests were culturally sterile. A surface scatter of machine-made and hand-made
bricks was observed across the eastern half of the site. A collapsed well covered by rotten wooden
planks was found at the southwestern site boundary. If the well is lined, the material could not be
seen due to thick vegetation. Several piles of large hematite cobbles were observed along an
overgrown two-track road. Several push piles were also noted across the site, suggesting it had
been disturbed with heavy machinery. No standing structures were observed within the site
boundaries. Many of the bricks strewn across the site were made by the Ferris Brick Co. and
marked as âFERRIS,â and the hand-made bricks are dark red brown with hematite inclusions
(Figure 87).

Artifact Assemblage

The artifact assemblage recovered from site 41RK641 consists only of historic-aged bricks. While
only one hand-made brick fragment with an alkaline glaze was collected, several machine-made
bricks were also present on the surface. The machine-made bricks exhibit the Ferris makerâs mark.

The bricks present at the site are consistent with a late-nineteenth- to an early-twentieth-century
occupation. Hand-made brick generally predates 1900. The Ferris bricks on the surface date from
1901 to 1923 (Steinbomer 1981).

Figure 87. Example of bricks in scatter at site 41RK641.

Archival Research
Archival records suggest that this site was potentially associated with tenants of several
nonresident owners, including Ida McMahon and her heirs, Walter Hill, Herman Loeb, D.W. Atkins,
Sophie Loeb, and James Monnie Maloney. The site does not possess sufficient historic associations
to qualify for inclusion in the NRHP.

Discussion and Recommendations

Site 41RK641 is a historic-aged residential site represented by a collapsed well and a scatter of
hand-made and machine-made bricks. Although no standing structures are extant on-site, the
presence of a dense scatter of bricks strongly suggests the former presence of one. The bricks
observed and recovered on-site suggest an early-twentieth-century domestic occupation. This site
dates to a well-documented period in local and regional history (Glander et al. 1984; Skokan et al.
1997). The site lacks any known associative significance that would qualify it for NRHP listing
under Criterion A or B. For these reasons, site 41RK641 is thought to be ineligible for NRHP
inclusion, and no further work is recommended.

Site 41RK642
Background
Site 41RK642 is a newly recorded historic homestead consisting of a relatively dense scatter of
historic-aged domestic debris and a sandstone chunk thought to represent a foundation pier. The
site is situated on the summit of a generally level hilltop, at an approximate elevation of 390 ft msl.
Soils within the site boundaries consist of Kirvin gravelly fine sandy loam, 2 to 5 percent slopes
(NRCS 2010). Those encountered while shovel testing consisted of 10 to 40 cm of yellowish brown
sandy loam over red or reddish brown sandy clay. The site is bisected by CR 2145. It is unclear
whether road construction pre- or postdates the siteâs abandonment.

Based on surface expression and the distribution of positive shovel tests, site 41RK642 extends
roughly 80 m north to south by 85 m east to west, sparsely covering an area of about 3,400 m2
(Figure 88). Vegetation consists of thorny plum bushes and pasture grasses, which almost
completely obscured ground surface visibility. Good ground surface visibility was present in areas
disturbed by feral pig rooting. Such areas were fairly extensive and raised the average ground
surface visibility to 25 percent across the site.

Work Performed

Site 41RK642 is associated with an HHPA discerned on an aerial photograph dating to 1935. A total
of 23 shovel tests were excavated at 10- to 20-m intervals to determine the horizontal and vertical
extent of the site. Of the 23 shovel tests excavated, 10 were culturally positive, yielding 62 historic
artifacts. Shovel tests 8 and 14 yielded 1 artifact each, while Shovel Test 2 yielded 2. Shovel tests 15
and 23 yielded 3 artifacts each, while Shovel Test 1 produced 5. Shovel Test 5 yielded 6 artifacts,
and Shovel Test 18 yielded 7. Shovel Test 12 yielded 10 artifacts, while shovel Test 12 produced 24.
Thirteen artifacts were recovered from Level 1 (0 to 10 cmbs), with 33 from Level 2 (10 to
20 cmbs), 12 from Level 3 (20 to 30 cmbs), and 4 from Level 4 (30 to 40 cmbs).
While no obvious structural remnants were found, a chunk of sandstone likely representing a
foundation pier was observed near the eastern edge of the site. The fact that sandstone does not
outcrop in the immediate site vicinity suggests it was brought in and this supports this conclusion.

Artifact Assemblage

The artifact assemblage recovered from site 41RK642 is composed entirely of historic domestic
debris. A total of 62 artifacts were recovered including ceramic, glass, brick, and metal specimens.
One modern shotgun shell was also recovered. The assemblage is presented below, differentiated
by material type.
The ceramic assemblage is composed of four sherds including two undecorated ironstone sherds,
one stoneware sherd with an Albany slip glaze, and one unglazed stoneware sherd.
100013883/100196

299

6. Survey Results
The glass assemblage is composed of 34 shards and includes 3 amber bottle shards with bubble
inclusions, 4 amber bottle shards, 2 aqua-tinted bottle shards, 1 black shard, 1 embossed colorless
bottle shard with bubble inclusions, 1 olive-colored bottle shard with bubble inclusions, 3 colorless
vessel shards with bubble inclusions, 6 colorless vessel shards, 3 solarized vessel shards with
bubble inclusions, 1 solarized vessel shard, 1 amber jar shard, 1 colorless window glass shard, and
7 aqua-tinted window glass shards.

The brick assemblage is composed of five hand-made brick fragments. The metal assemblage is
composed of 18 artifacts and includes 2 cut nails, 9 wire nails, 1 unidentifiable nail, 1 fence staple, 1
wire fragment, and 4 unidentified iron fragments.
One modern plastic shotgun shell was also recovered. The hull is head-stamped âW-W 12 Gaugeâ
indicating manufacture by Winchester-Western.

The artifacts recovered are consistent with a late- nineteenth- to early-twentiethâcentury
occupation. Solarized glass dates between 1880 and 1918 (Stelle 2010), and glass with bubble
inclusions generally predates 1920 (Polak 2000). Black glass typically predates 1880 (SHA 2010).
The embossed bottle collected was embossed with a portion of Ballardâs Snow Liniment, which
postdates 1885 (National Museum of American History 2010). Hand-made bricks generally predate
1900 (Steinbomer 1981). Stoneware with an Albany-type slip glaze predates 1940 (Stelle 2010). In
general, wire nails postdate 1890 (Adams 2002).

Archival Research

A structure is discernible at this location on the 1935 aerial photograph, but none are depicted on
the 1958 USGS Minden 15-minute topographic quadrangle. Archival research indicates that
additional research would be necessary to determine potential occupants of this site during the
nineteenth century; T.J. and M.A. Trammell could have occupied the tract before 1893, or tenants
could have been associated with the property, but there are gaps in the title data Luminant
provided. Potential early- to mid-twentieth-century occupants include C.A. Price, Oscar Benton,
F.W. Beall, C.A. Norris, and M.E. Watson. It is likely that tenant D.B. Wyatt lived somewhere on the
property between 1922 and 1935.

Discussion and Recommendations

Site 41RK642 is a historic-aged homestead consisting of a relatively dense scatter of domestic
debris and a single sandstone chunk that my represent a foundation pier. The site consists of a
surface and subsurface scatter of artifacts that suggest a late-nineteenth- to early-twentieth-century
domestic occupation. No standing structures were found within the site boundaries. The presence
of black glass suggests, however, that the site may have been initially occupied prior to 1880
making it one of the earliest historic-age sites documented in the mine area. However the site lacks
associative significance or intact structural remains and does not appear to warrant NRHP inclusion

under Criterion A, B, C, or D. For these reasons, no additional investigation of site 41RK642 is
recommended.

Site 41RK643
Background

Site 41RK643 is a historic farmstead consisting of a standing residence and barn, a collapsed shed,
and a concrete-lined well. The site is situated upon a ridge summit at an elevation of approximately
355 ft msl. The terrain slopes slightly southward. A well pad road bisects the site on an east to west
axis. The intersection of CR 2145 and a two-track roadway is located roughly 50 m west of the site
boundaries. The road intersects with a gas pipeline corridor just east of the site boundaries. That
pipeline right of way defines the northern boundary of the site. Soils within the site boundaries
consist of Kirvin gravelly fine sandy loam, 2 to 5 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). Shovel testing
revealed 20 to 50 cm of brown to yellowish brown sandy loam over reddish brown or strong brown
clay.

Based on surface expression and the distribution of positive shovel tests, site 41RK643 extends
65 m north-south by 70 m east-west and encompasses an area of roughly 3,500 m2 (Figure 89).
There are two standing structures, a collapsed structure, and a well on-site. The first is a residential
structure located just south of the power line corridor and is approximately 10 x 13 m (Figure 90a).
The residence was electrified after its initial construction as indicated by the surface-mounted
electrical insulators found throughout the structure. A power pole was observed just north of the
two-track roadway directly across from the house. A barn stands approximately 35 m east of the
residence (Figure 90b). It is approximately 5 x 10 m in size. A covered well is located a few meters
southeast of the residence (Figure 91a). The well is lined with precast concrete pipe sections. A
barbed wire fence runs on an east to west axis just south of the above structures. A fourth structure,
the collapsed remains of a small shed (Figure 91b), was observed south of the fence. Most of the
structures are choked by briars and viney vegetation. The majority of the site area is very densely
wooded. Some modern debris, probably from recent dumping, is scattered throughout the site.
Vegetation at the site consists of grasses within the pipeline right of way and hardwood trees
elsewhere. The ground surface is obscured within the site boundaries by grasses within the power
line corridor and hardwood leaf litter elsewhere.

Work Performed

Site 41RK643 is associated with an HHPA depicted on the 1958 Minden 15-minute USGS
topographic quadrangle. A total of nine shovel tests were excavated at roughly 15-m intervals in the
vicinity of the structures to determine the horizontal and vertical extent of the site. Of the nine
excavated shovel tests, three were culturally positive, yielding a total of seven historic artifacts.
Shovel Test 7 yielded two artifacts, while Shovel Test 8 produced four. Shovel Test 9 yielded one

artifact. Two artifacts were recovered from Level 1 (0 to 10 cmbs), with four from Level 3 (20 to
30 cmbs), and one from levels 1 and 2 (0 to 20 cmbs). One artifact was collected from the surface.

Artifact Assemblage

The recovered glass artifact assemblage consists of eight specimens: one embossed colorless bottle,
five colorless vessel shards, one molded colorless vessel shard with bubble inclusions, and one
colorless jar shard.

The bricks observed on-site appear to be machine made, and the nails appear to be wire nails.
These materials were used in the construction of the residence structure and were not collected.

The artifacts present at the site are consistent with an early- to mid-twentieth-century occupation.
The embossed bottle exhibits a portion of âFederal Law Prohibits Resale of this Bottle,â which dates
between 1935 and the 1960s (SHA 2010). Glass with bubble inclusions generally predates 1920
(Polak 2000). Wire nails replaced cut nails during the 1890s (Adams 2002).

Historic Standing Structures

No structures appear at this location on the 1935 aerial photograph, but the 1958 USGS Minden 15minute topographic quadrangle depicts a structure, and currently there are three structures that
remain. The structural component of site 41RK643 includes a circa 1935 dwelling (Structure A), a
circa 1935 barn (Structure B), and a circa 1935 open-air shelter (Structure C) for a presently
abandoned well. The dwelling (Structure A) has a gabled roof with a shed-roof bay on one of the
side-gabled faÃ§ades. This dwelling is in poor condition, and none of its original architectural
features (windows, doors, interior walls, porches, etc.) are extant. The structure is also missing
portions of its external wooden siding. Structure B includes a partially collapsed barn with a frontgabled roof and a collapsed lateral shed-roof crib on one side-gabled faÃ§ade. The barnâs doors are
no longer extant, and portions of the vertical wooden cladding are missing. The final structure
(Structure C) is an abandoned well covered by an open-air shelter. The shelter consists of four
unmilled wooden posts and a gabled metal roof. Structures A and B lack integrity of materials,
design, workmanship, and feeling due to their derelict condition and missing architectural
components. Structure C lacks architectural significance. None of these buildings, which may
represent the remnants of a tenant farm complex, have any known historic associations, and they
are not recommended for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion A, B, or C.

Archival Research

Archival research indicates that additional research would be necessary to determine potential
occupants of this site during the nineteenth century; T.J. and M.A. Trammell could have occupied
the tract before 1893, or tenants could have been associated with the property, but there are gaps
in the title data Luminant provided. Potential early- to mid-twentieth-century occupants include
100013883/100196

306

6. Survey Results
C.A. Price, Oscar Benton, F.W. Beall, C.A. Norris, and M.E. Watson. It is likely that tenant D.B. Wyatt
lived somewhere on the property between 1922 and 1935. The property was also likely occupied
by tenants and/or used for agriculture during its association with the Price family (1935â1937) and
J.M. Grant (1937âremainder of twentieth century). Either Price or Grant likely constructed the circa
1935 farmstead associated with 41RK643. Artifacts recovered from this site also indicate a
twentieth-century occupation. Archival research suggests there are no significant historical
associations with this site. As a result, the property is recommended not eligible under Criterion A
or B.

Discussion and Recommendations

Site 41RK643 is a historic-aged farmstead with a residential structure, a barn, a shed, and a
concrete-lined well. Both the residence and the barn were standing and intact at the time of the
survey. Judging from structural elements, as well as the artifacts recovered and structural materials
observed on-site, the farmstead was likely built and occupied during the early to mid-twentieth
century. The site dates to a well-documented period in local and regional history (Glander et al.
1984; Skokan et al. 1997) and has no known associative significance that would qualify it for NRHP
listing under Criterion A or B. It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that site 41RK630 is
ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and that no further work is necessary.

Site 41RK644
Background

Site 41RK644 is a newly recorded historic site located on a south-facing shoulderslope of a large
ridge, at an approximate elevation of 370 ft msl. An unnamed drainage that flows east into a stock
pond is located roughly 25 m south of the site. The site is partially vegetated with plantation pines
that average 20 ft in height. The remainder of the site is in an open pasture with long dense grasses
and a few scattered hardwoods. Ground surface visibility was nonexistent due to pine duff and
grasses. The soils on-site consist of both Darco loamy fine sand, 1 to 8 percent slopes and Woodtell
loam, 5 to 15 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). Soils encountered during shovel testing consisted of 40
to 90 cm of brown to reddish brown sandy loam over reddish brown sandy clay. Two possible stone
foundation piers were located at the eastern boundary of the site adjacent to FM 2658. Ornamental
flowering plants were found scattered in the vicinity of the possible foundation piers. Based on the
horizontal distribution of positive shovel tests and surface expression, site 41RK644 extends about
160 m east to west by 30 to 50 m north to south and covers an area of roughly 6,500 m2 (Figure 92).

Work Performed

The site is associated with an HHPA that was discerned on a photograph dating to 1935 and the
USGS Minden 15-minute topographic quadrangle. A total of 31 shovel tests were excavated in two
intersecting cruciform patterns at 10-m intervals to determine the horizontal and vertical extent of
100013883/100196

307

6. Survey Results
the site. Of the 31 shovel tests excavated, 8 were culturally positive yielding 19 historic artifacts.
Shovel Tests 1, 5, and 16 yielded one artifact each, while Shovel Test 6 yielded six. Shovel tests 7,
15, and 28 yielded two artifacts each, and Shovel Test 23 resulted in the recovery of four artifacts.
Shovel Test 16 contained one artifact, and Shovel Test 23 resulted in the recovery of four. Seven
artifacts were recovered from Level 2 (10 to 20 cmbs), with nine from Level 3 (20 to 30 cmbs), two
from Level 4 (30 to 40 cmbs), and one from Level 5 (40 to 50 cmbs).

Artifact Assemblage

The artifact assemblage includes specimens of glass, brick, metal, and rubber. The glass assemblage
is composed of 15 artifacts and includes 1 colorless bottle shard with a makerâs mark and bubble
inclusions, 1 colorless embossed bottle shard with bubble inclusions, 1 colorless bottle shard with
bubble inclusions, 1 colorless bottle shard, 2 aqua-tinted bottle shards with bubble inclusions, 2
colorless vessel shards with bubble inclusions, 5 colorless vessel shards, and 2 aqua-tinted window
glass shards. The brick assemblage consists of two fragments from hand-made bricks. The
remaining artifact assemblage is one wire nail and one rubber shoe sole.
The artifacts present at the site are consistent with an early- to mid-twentieth-century occupation.
Glass with bubble inclusions generally predates 1920 (Polak 2000).

Archival Research

A structure appears at this location on the 1935 aerial and on the 1958 USGS Minden 15-minute
topographic quadrangle. The chain of title data that Luminant provided has a gap from about 1849
to 1910, but artifacts recovered from the site indicate it dates to the early to mid-twentieth century.
In 1910, P.D. and L.H. Adams were associated with the property and could have lived on it prior to
their conveyance of the land to T.J. Wright in that year. Wright, who owned the property from 1910
to 1918, also owned property elsewhere that he may have lived on, as did W.C. Williamson, who
owned the land in 1922 and from 1929 to 1933. During these times, it is possible tenants occupied
the property. Other property owners include Owen Williamson (1918â1922) and A.L. St. Claire
(1922â1929). Archival research suggests there are no significant historical associations with this
site. As a result, the property is recommended not eligible under Criterion A or B.

Discussion and Recommendations

Site 41RK644 appears to represent a historic-aged homestead dating to the early twentieth century.
The site dates to a well-documented period in local and regional history (Glander et al. 1984;
Skokan et al. 1997) and has no known associative significance that would qualify it for NRHP listing
under Criterion A or B. It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that site 41RK644 is ineligible
for inclusion in the NRHP and that no further work is necessary.

Site 41RK646
Background
Site 41RK646 is a newly recorded prehistoric lithic scatter located west of Martin Lake on a ridge
summit at an approximate elevation of 360 ft msl. This ridge slopes south and east toward Martin
Lake, some 200 to 270 m distant. The soils on-site are mapped as Latex very fine sandy loam, 1 to
3 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). Shovel testing revealed 40 to 65 cm of pale brown silty sand over
strong brown clay subsoil. Thirty to 50 cm of sandy to silty loam was encountered near the fence at
the northern end of the site, as well as along the slopes leading away from the top of the ridge.

Based upon the horizontal distribution of positive shovel tests, site 41RK646 extends 78 m northsouth by 22 m east-west, and comprises an area of roughly 1,500 m2 (Figure 93). The vegetation onsite consists of plantation pines and a few sweetgum trees. Ground surface visibility is limited to
less than 5 percent by pine duff and grasses.

Work Performed

A total of 21 shovel tests were excavated in a cruciform pattern at 10-m intervals to determine the
horizontal and vertical extent of the site. Of the 21 shovel tests, 5 were culturally positive. Shovel
Test 1 yielded one artifact from Level 2 (10 to 20 cmbs). Shovel Test 2 yielded one artifact and one
turtle carapace fragment from Level 3 (20 to 30 cmbs). Shovel Test 3 yielded one artifact from Level
1 (0 to 10 cmbs) and from Level 2 (10 to 20 cmbs). Shovel Test 18 yielded one artifact from Level 2
(10 to 20 cmbs), while Shovel Test 19 yielded one fire-cracked rock from Level 3 (20 to 30 cmbs).

Artifact Assemblage and Analysis

A total of six lithic artifacts, one fire-cracked rock fragment, and one faunal fragment were
recovered. The lithic artifacts are all nondiagnostic debitage consisting of one chert secondary flake
that is thermally altered, one chert tertiary flake, one chert tertiary flake that is thermally altered,
two silicified wood tertiary flakes, and one silicified wood tertiary flake that is thermally altered.
The fire-cracked rock fragment is hematite. The faunal fragment is from a turtle carapace and is
unburned and may not represent the prehistoric occupation.

Discussion and Recommendations

Site 41RK646 is a low density prehistoric lithic scatter. The low density of cultural materials on-site
as well as an absence of any carbonized subsistence or fuel remains suggests that the site does not
harbor significant data resources that meet the criteria warranting NRHP inclusion. For these
reasons, it is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that site 41RK646 is ineligible for NRHP
listing, and no further work is recommended.

Site 41RK647
Background
Site 41RK647 is a newly recorded historic residential site located on an eroded ridge shoulder
overlooking an unnamed creek at an approximate elevation of 360 ft msl. Martin Lake is located
approximately 1.12 km to the east of the site. The soil at the site is mapped as Woodtell loam, 5 to
15 percent slopes (Griffith 2000). The soils encountered on-site were shallow and eroded and
consisted of 10â20 cm of yellowish brown to yellowish red sandy to clay loam over clay of similar
colors.

Based upon surface expression, site 41RK647 extends roughly 40 m by 20 m, with the long axis
oriented northwest to southeast, and covers an area of about 600 m2 (Figure 94). A two-track road
leads into the site from the north. A large drainage is downslope to the east of the site. Vegetation at
the site consisted of oak, sweetgum, and pasture grasses. Ground surface visibility was limited to
10 percent by leaf litter and grasses.

Work Performed

A surface inspection identified a cement slab foundation (Figure 95) and an associated sparse
surficial artifact scatter. A water pipe, extending from the ground, was located about 10 m to the
north of the foundation. A ring of upended and unused cinder blocks was located just to the south of
the water pipe. A rock ring surrounding a fire pit was located about 22 m to the north-northwest of
the foundation. A concentration of burned glass was present within the fire pit, suggesting the site
has been recently utilized for recreational purposes. Three shovel tests were excavated in the
vicinity of the foundation and surface scatter. None yielded cultural materials.

Artifact Assemblage

Artifacts observed (but not collected) on the ground surface include window glass, two
undecorated ironstone sherds, refined earthenware ceramics, a stoneware sherd with a Bristol
glaze on the interior and exterior, one stoneware sherd with an Albany slip glaze on the interior and
exterior, one wire nail, unidentified metal objects, and machine-made brick fragments. None of the
artifacts are particularly temporally sensitive, but suggest an early- to mid-twentieth-century
occupation.

Archival Research

The site is associated within an HHPA that was discerned on a photograph dating to 1935. The site
is not depicted on the 1958 USGS Minden 15-minute topographic quadrangle. Prior to 1879, the
tract was associated with the Allred family, who lived in Panola County. Jesse Brooks acquired the
property in that year, and it remained in the Brooks family through the twentieth century. Jesseâs

son Rueben retained the property until his death in 1973 and could have occupied the tract.
Archival research suggests there are no significant historical associations with this site. As a result,
the property is recommended not eligible under Criterion A or B.

Discussion

Site 41RK647 is a historic-aged site that likely represents a former residence . It consists of a sparse
artifact scatter of domestic debris and a concrete slab foundation. Artifacts observed on-site point
to an early- to mid-twentieth-century occupation. However, a fire pit and ring of upended cinder
blocks indicate more recent use. This site dates to a well-documented period in local and regional
history (Glander et al. 1984; Skokan et al. 1997) and has no known associative significance that
would qualify it for NRHP listing under Criterion A or B. It is the opinion of the Principal
Investigator that site 41RK620 is ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and that no further work is
necessary.

Site 41RK648
Background

Site 41RK648 represents the remains of a historic structure located on a ridge summit at an
approximate elevation of 350 ft msl. The nearest source of water is an unnamed tributary of Dry
Creek approximately 200 m northwest. The site was in a mixed pine hardwood forest with a dense
100013883/100196

yaupon and green briar understory. Ground surface visibility was limited to 5 percent due to leaf
litter and clumps of wild grasses. The soil at the site is mapped as Sawlit-Sawtown complex, 0 to
2 percent slopes (Griffith 2000). Shovel testing revealed brown loamy fine sand extending 30 to
60 cm in depth over strong brown clay. The site extends approximately 56 m (north-south) by 42 m
(east-west) (2,352 mÂ²) based on surface expression (Figure 96).

Work Performed

A total of seven shovel tests were excavated to determine the vertical and horizontal extents of the
site. All of the shovel tests were culturally sterile.

The surface inspection located a brick foundation, a collapsing chimney, a cement porch, and a
scatter of domestic debris (Figure 97). The foundation was made of unmarked manufactured red
bricks. The extant portion of the foundation was three courses high and enclosed a rectangular area
approximately 20 m (north-south) by 48 m (east-west). No bricks lined the inside of the rectangle.
The cement front porch was also lined with the same bricks. The chimney was partially intact and
positioned along the eastern edge of the foundation. The chimney was built with several different
colors of manufactured brick. A set of cement steps rests along the foundationâs northern edge,
close to the chimney on its eastern edge.

Artifact Assemblage

Several concentrations of burned items were identified, including a burned beam, burned wood
alongside the house foundation, burned colorless glass bottles, and melted shingles near the rear of
the house.

Other artifacts present on the surface included iron doorknobs, machine-made bricks, extruded
bricks with four holes, a decalcomania ceramic plate, space heater, iron pipe, a childâs sneaker, and
metal-rimmed sunglasses. Although none of the artifacts are particularly temporally sensitive, they
generally suggest an early- to mid-twentieth-century occupation.

Archival Research

No structures appear at this site on the 1935 aerial photograph or the 1958 USGS Minden 15minute topographic quadrangle. Archival research indicates that although this property was
associated with the Haden Edwards family in the nineteenth century, they lived elsewhere during
that time. The Bailey Williams family appears to have been living somewhere on this tract prior to
1883, although they never owned the property. Dick Findley bought the property in 1883, and it
remained in his family through the mid-twentieth century, when his daughter, Sarah Booty, was
associated with the property. The Williams and Findley families were African American, suggesting
this site may have fit into the pattern of African Americanâowned and tenant-occupied properties
in the region. No subsurface archeological deposits are associated with this site, although early- to

mid-twentieth-century artifacts were observed on the ground surface. Despite this siteâs
associations with African American property owners in this region, additional archival research is
unlikely to provide additional specific information about the history of this site. As a result, this site
is recommended not eligible under Criterion A or B.

Discussion and Recommendations

The structural remains on-site have been heavily weathered and overgrown, suggesting the
residence represented is likely to be 50 years old. This site lacks associative significance, intact
deposits, and is thought to lack data resources that would warrant NRHP inclusion. No further work
is recommended.

Site 41RK649
Background

Site 41RK649 is a historic dump located at a drainage head at an approximate elevation of 395 ft
msl. The nearest source of water is an unnamed tributary of Dry Creek, 50 m to the west. The site is
in a primarily pine woods with a dense understory of yaupon and green briar. Two large oaks
bracket the drainage. The site has been severely eroded, and ground surface visibility was very
good, about 50 percent, and limited only by several clumps of wild grasses and leaf litter. The soil
on-site is mapped as Latex very fine sandy loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes (Griffith 2000). Shovel testing
revealed pale to yellowish brown fine sandy loam extending 30 to 60 cm in depth over yellowish
brown clay. The site extends approximately 40 m (north-south) by 20 m (east-west) (800 mÂ²)
based on shovel testing and surface expression (Figure 98). Site 41RK649 is not depicted on the
1958 USGS Minden 15-minute topographic quadrangle. A structure was, however, discernible on an
aerial photograph dating to 1935.

Work Performed

A total of eight shovel tests were excavated to determine the vertical and horizontal extent of the
site. Two shovel tests were culturally positive. Shovel Test 1 contained three shards of milk glass in
Level 1 (0 to 10 cmbs), and Shovel Test 4 contained three shards of amber bottle glass in Level 2
(10 to 20 cmbs). Other artifacts observed on the ground surface, most of which were found in the
drainage, include a metal toy gun with plastic grips, old tires, a wooden railing, and a large steel
cable.

Artifact Assemblage

The artifact assemblage includes six glass shards: three amber bottle glass shards and three opaline
milk glass shards. None of these materials are particularly temporally sensitive, though they do
100013883/100196

318

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
suggest use during the late nineteenth to early twentieth century. Opaline glass is still in production
today but was most popular from 1870 through 1920 (Stelle 2008).

Archival Research

Site 41RK649 is associated with an HHPA discerned on the 1935 aerial photograph; however, no
structures appear on the 1958 USGS Minden 15-minute topographic quadrangle. Archival research
indicates that this property was associated with African American property owners during the late
nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The Menefee, Barr, and Humphrey families jointly owned it
from approximately 1877 through 1887. After 1887, the property became part of the Aus and Celia
Barr homestead and farm. Although it is unclear whether their homestead was located on the parcel
containing 41RK649, it is likely the Barr family is associated with this site. The property remained
in the Barr family through the mid-twentieth century, and the few artifacts recovered from this site
suggest it dates to the twentieth century. Although this site is associated with African American
property owners in this region, additional archival research is unlikely to provide additional
specific information about the history of this site. As a result, this site is recommended not eligible
under Criterion A or B.

Discussion and Recommendations

Although the site is associated with an HHPA, no evidence of a former structure remains. However,
two large oaks flanking the drainage are somewhat suggestive of a residential site. The most recent
use of the site was as a dump, and all of the artifacts recovered from shovel tests and observed onsite conceivably represent this use. This site does not appear to harbor significant data resources
that warrant NRHP inclusion. No further work is recommended.

Site 41RK650
Background

Site 41RK650 is a historic standing structure with an associated burn pit located on a ridge summit
at an approximate elevation of 360 ft msl. The nearest natural source of water is an unnamed
drainage approximately 200 m northwest of the structure. Vegetation at the site is mostly
manicured grass. A few oaks and pines are scattered across the site. Ground surface visibility was
less than 5 percent, due to dense grasses. The soil at the site is mapped as Sawlit-Sawtown complex,
0 to 2 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). Shovel testing revealed yellowish brown to brown fine sandy
loam extending 30 to 40 cm in depth over reddish and yellowish brown sandy clay. Much of the
landform has been eroded and red clay is exposed at the surface. The site extends approximately
55 m (north-south) by 60 m (east-west) (3,300 mÂ²) based on shovel testing and surface expression
(Figure 99). Site 41RK650 is depicted on the 1958 USGS Minden 15-minute topographic
quadrangle; however, no structures were discernible on the aerial photograph dating to 1935.

Work Performed
Five shovel tests were excavated to determine the vertical and horizontal extents of the site. One
shovel test was culturally positive. Shovel Test 1, which cut through a dense zone of blackened soil
about 5 cm thick, contained eight nails and two glass shards in Level 2 (10 to 20 cmbs). All of the
artifacts appear to have been burned. The blackened soil lens extended beyond the limits of the
shovel test and appeared to be the remains of a buried burn pile.

Artifact Assemblage and Analysis

A total of 10 historic artifacts were recovered: 2 colorless glass vessel shards and 8 wire nails. None
of the artifacts are temporally diagnostic.

Historic Standing Structures

Although no structures appear at this location on the 1935 aerial photograph, there is a structure
present on the 1958 USGS Minden 15-minute topographic quadrangle. Currently, this site includes a
circa 1935 wood-framed bungalow (figures 100 and 101a). The structure has a front-gabled roof,
exposed rafter tails, and a projecting full-width porch with replacement wooden support posts. The
primary entry is located centrally on the western faÃ§ade and consists of a replacement hinged door
with a nonhistoric-age metal-and-glass storm door. There are two pairs of symmetrically placed
3/1 windows on either side of the entry and a large replacement exterior brick chimney on the
southern lateral faÃ§ade. This structure lacks integrity of materials, workmanship, design, and
feeling due to the replacement porch components and chimney. Additionally, it is of ubiquitous
design and lacks known historic associations that would qualify it for NRHP inclusion under
Criterion A or C.
Just to the south of the site is a circa 1940 side-gabled barn (Figure 101b). This wood-framed
resource is clad in corrugated metal and has lateral open-air additions on both sides. This resource
is of common design and lacks any known historic associations or architectural merit. The lateral
additions and exterior recladding detract from its integrity of design, materials, and workmanship.
Therefore, this resource is not recommended for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion A, B, or C.

Archival Research

Archival research indicates that although this property was associated with the Haden Edwards
family in the nineteenth century, they lived elsewhere during that time. The Bailey Williams family
appears to have been living somewhere on this tract prior to 1883, although they never owned the
property. Dick Findley bought the property in 1883, and it remained in his family through the midtwentieth century, when his daughter, Sarah Booty, was associated with the property. The Williams
and Findley families were African American, suggesting this site may have fit into the pattern of

African Americanâowned and tenant-occupied properties in the region. Despite this siteâs
associations with African American property owners in this region, additional archival research is
unlikely to provide additional specific information about the history of this site. As a result, this site
is recommended not eligible under Criterion A or B.

Discussion and Recommendations

The structure lacks integrity of materials, workmanship, design, and feeling due to the replacement
porch components and chimney. It is of ubiquitous design and lacks known historic associations
and is not recommended for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion A, B, or C. The subsurface
deposits also appear to lack significant data resources that could warrant NRHP inclusion under
Criterion D. For these reasons no further work is recommended.

Site 41RK651
Background

Site 41RK651 is a collapsed historic structure located on a shoulderslope at an approximate
elevation of 350 ft msl. The nearest natural source of water is an unnamed tributary to Martin
Creek approximately 100 m to the north. The vegetation at the site is mixed hardwoods with some
green briar. Ground surface visibility was limited to 10 percent mostly by leaf litter. The soil at the
site is mapped as Woodtell loam, 5 to 15 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). Shovel testing revealed pale
brown fine sandy loam extending 10 to 40 cm in depth over reddish to strong brown clay. The site
boundaries are estimated to be 35 by 35 m based on surface expression, encompassing an area of
1,225 mÂ² (Figure 102). Site 41RK651 is associated with an HHPA discerned on a 1935 aerial
photograph and is also depicted on the 1958 USGS Minden 15-minute topographic quadrangle.

Work Performed

Eight shovel tests were excavated to determine the vertical and horizontal extents of the site, all of
which were culturally sterile.

The site consists of a collapsed tin-roofed structure with an associated pile of bricks. The red
unlabeled bricks were mostly disarticulated and may represent a chimney fall. Some bricks
appeared to be arranged in a square and may represent the base of a chimney (Figure 103a). Many
hematite foundation piers were observed around the base of the structure. A cooking stove and
clothing washer were located near the collapsed structure. A scatter of trash made up of glass
bottles and scrap metal stretched between the house and what appears to be a small collapsed
wooden outbuilding (Figure 103b). Another clothing washer was next to the outbuilding. Slightly
south of the main building is a small scatter of red bricks similar to the chimney bricks, with a
hematite pier stone nearby. No other piers were found in association with this last pier. Also near

the structure is a small cluster of fire-cracker lilies. Gravels in Shovel Test 4 suggest that a driveway
might have followed the fence southward at one time.

Artifact Assemblage

Artifacts present on the surface of the site included machine-made bricks, sheet metal, banded
refined earthenware, opaline jar lid liners, stoneware, and an iron doorknob. The artifacts observed
on-site are not particularly temporally sensitive. Opaline glass lid liners were introduced around
1869 (Stelle 2001).

Archival Research

A structure appears at this location on the 1935 aerial photograph and is also present on the 1958
USGS Minden 15-minute topographic quadrangle. Archival research indicates there is a gap in the
Luminant-provided chain of title records until 1881 when Jesse Brooks sold this tract to his mother
Emily. The tract remained in the Brooks family through the twentieth century, although it is
possible that tenants occupied the property, including the Jourdan and Freeman families, during the
mid-twentieth century. Archival research suggests there are no significant historical associations
with this site. As a result, the property is recommended not eligible under Criterion A or B.

Discussion and Recommendations

Site 41RK651 is a historic-aged farmstead consisting of a surface scatter of structural debris and
artifacts, a collapsed outbuilding, and foundation piers. The materials observed and recovered onsite point to an early- to mid-twentieth-century occupation. As such, the site dates to a welldocumented period in local and regional history (Glander et al. 1984; Skokan et al. 1997) and has
no known associative significance that would qualify it for NRHP listing under Criterion A or B. It is
the opinion of the Principal Investigator that site 41RK651 is ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP
and that no further work is warranted.

Site 41RK652
Background

Site 41RK652 is a subsurface prehistoric lithic scatter located on a shoulderslope at an approximate
elevation of 350 ft msl. The nearest natural water source is an unnamed drainage 120 m to the
north. The site is in a mixed pine hardwood forest with an understory composed mostly of green
briar. Ground surface visibility was limited to less than 5 percent by leaf litter. The soil at the site is
mapped as Latex very fine sandy loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). Shovel testing revealed
brown sandy loam ranging in depth from 50 to 100 cm over strong brown clay. The site boundaries
are 20 x 20 m (400 m2) based surface expression (Figure 104).
100013883/100196

328

Liberty Deposit Mine Area

Work Performed
A total of nine shovel test were excavated to determine the vertical and horizontal extents of the
site. Only one shovel test was culturally positive. Shovel Test 1 contained two pieces of lithic
debitage and five turtle carapace fragments in Level 2 (10 to 20 cmbs), two pieces of thermally
altered silicified wood ground stone and four turtle carapace fragments in Level 3 (20 to 30 cmbs),
and four turtle carapace fragments in Level 5 (40 to 50 cmbs).

Artifact Assemblage

The lithic assemblage consists of one chert tertiary flake, one silicified wood tertiary flake that is
thermally altered, and a ground stone. The ground stone is two fragments of a small abrader. The
turtle carapace fragments are unburned and may represent fortuitous inclusions in the
archeological record.

The two fragments of a small abrader (Lot 2.1) include one long edge fragment and one small
tabular fragment. Significant portions of the tool are missing. Examination under 10x power
binocular magnification revealed two types of wear on the two fragments: grinding and striations.
Based on the observed wear patterns, the tool appears to have been some type of abrader. The long
edge fragment has a thin shovel-shaped, rounded end, suggesting that it may have functioned as a
punch. Unfortunately, the tool is too fragmented to draw specific conclusions about its possible
function.

Discussion and Recommendations

The ephemeral nature of the site suggests it resulted from a short-duration, possibly single-event,
occupation sometime during the prehistoric period. The turtle carapace fragments were unburned
and probably represent fortuitous inclusions in the archeological record. The absence of carbonized
subsistence or fuel remains, along with the absence of fire-cracked rocks, suggests that cultural
features have not been preserved on-site. These observations suggest that site 41RK652 does not
harbor significant data and does not meet the criteria warranting NRHP inclusion. No further work
is recommended.

Site 41RK653
Background

Site 41RK653 is a subsurface historic artifact scatter located on a shoulderslope at an approximate
elevation of 360 msl. The nearest natural source of water is an unnamed drainage to Martin Creek
70 m to the northeast. Vegetation at the site includes oak, sweetgum, and pasture grasses. Ground
surface visibility was limited to approximately 10 percent primarily by dense grasses. The soil at
the site is mapped as Woodtell loam, 5 to 15 percent slopes (Griffith 2000). Shovel testing revealed
pale brown sandy loam extending 30 to 70 cm in depth over a red clay. Based on the distribution of

6. Survey Results
positive shovel tests, the site is 45 m northwest-southeast by 25 m northeast-southwest and
comprises an area of about 1,125 mÂ² (Figure 105).

Work Performed

A total of six shovel tests were excavated to determine the vertical and horizontal limits of the site.
Four shovel tests yielded cultural materials. Shovel Test 1 had eight artifacts in Level 2 (10 to
20 cmbs) and three artifacts in Level 3 (20 to 30 cmbs). Shovel Test 2 had one artifact each in Level
1 (0 to 10 cmbs) and Level 2 (10 to 20 cmbs). Shovel Test 4 had one artifact in Level 1 (0 to
10 cmbs). Shovel Test 5 had 34 artifacts in Level 1 (0 to 10 cmbs).

Artifact Assemblage

A total of 48 historic artifacts were recovered from shovel tests and 3 were collected from the
surface, including glass, brick, and metal specimens. The glass assemblage contains 21 specimens
consisting of 1 amber bottle shard, 1 amber bottle shard with bubble inclusions, 3 aqua-tint vessel
shards, 15 colorless vessel shards, and 1 colorless vessel shard with bubble inclusions.
The brick assemblage consists of one hand-made brick fragment and one machine-made brick
fragment with a clear glaze.
The metal assemblage contains 28 specimens consisting of 25 iron wire nails, 1 brass stamped
thimble, 1 barbed wire fragment, and 1 unidentified iron fragment.

Most of artifacts are consistent with a late-nineteenth- to early-twentieth-century occupation. Glass
with bubble inclusions predates 1920 (Polak 2000). Wire nails replaced cut nails during the 1890s
(Adams 2002).

Archival Research

The site is associated with an HHPA that was discerned on an aerial photograph dating to 1935.
Archival research indicates there is a gap in the Luminant-provided chain of title records until 1881
when Jesse Brooks sold this tract to his mother Emily. The tract remained in the Brooks family
through the twentieth century, although it is possible that tenants occupied the property, including
the Jourdan and Freeman families, during the mid-twentieth century. Archival research suggests
there are no significant historical associations with this site. As a result, the property is
recommended not eligible under Criterion A or B.

Discussion and Recommendations

Site 41RK653 is a historic artifact scatter thought to represent a domestic residence. However, no
structures or structural remains are extant. The artifact assemblage from site 41RK653, including
bubble-included glass and hand-made bricks, suggests a late-nineteenth- to early-twentieth100013883/100196

6. Survey Results
century domestic occupation. The site dates to a well-documented period in local and regional
history (Glander et al. 1984; Skokan et al. 1997) and has no known associative significance that
would qualify it for NRHP listing under Criterion A or B. It is the opinion of the Principal
Investigator that site 41RK653 is ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP, and no further work is
recommended.

Site 41RK654
Background

Site 41RK654 is a newly recorded historic site thought to represent the remains of a domestic
residence. The site is situated in a cleared pasture on a gentle east-facing shoulderslope above the
Martin Lake shoreline (Beard Branch prior to inundation) at an approximate elevation of 365 ft msl.
Soils on-site consist of Meth fine sandy loam, 2 to 5 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). Soils encountered
during shovel testing consisted of dusky brown sandy loam over red silty clay.

Based upon surface expression and the distribution of positive shovel tests, site 41RK654 extends
roughly 40 m east to west by 60 m north to south and covers an area of roughly 2,400 m2 (Figure
106). A fence runs along the south side of an eastâwest-trending unnamed paved road near the
northern boundary of the site. A north-south-trending fence is near the western boundary of the
site. The site area is located between a modern house and a stock pond and is eroded and denuded,
possibly due to the construction of the stock pond and heavy overgrazing. Horses were present in
the pasture at the time of the survey. The site is associated with an HHPA discerned on an air
photograph dating to 1935. The site is not depicted on the 1958 USGS Minden 15-minute
topographic quadrangle.

Work Performed

A total of nine shovel tests were excavated at roughly 15-m intervals in a cruciform pattern along
cardinal directions to determine the horizontal and vertical limits of the site. Of the nine shovel
tests excavated, two were culturally positive.

Artifact Assemblage

The artifact assemblage recovered from the shovel tests at site 41RK654 includes one stoneware
ceramic sherd with an Albany-like slip, one wire nail, and a modern shotgun shell fragment, all
recovered from the upper 10 cm from two different shovel tests. Albany slip was most popular
prior to 1890 (Greer 1981). Wire nails replaced cut nails during the last decade of the nineteenth
century (Adams 2002). The modern shotgun shell fragment is a brass, center-fire cartridge case
stamped with âW-W 12 GAUGEâ and postdates 1965 (Farrar n.d.).

100013883/100196

333

6. Survey Results
Several additional artifacts were observed on the ground surface, but not collected. These artifacts
included several pieces of fragmented bricks, a possible foundation pier stone, and fragments of
solarized glass from a jar, colorless and brown glass from bottles, and whiteware ceramics.
Solarized glass dates to 1880 through 1918 (Stelle 2008). Much of the glass appears to have been
discarded as roadside trash and is not associated with the historic occupation of the site.

Archival Research

A dwelling remains on the parcel containing this site but is not considered part of it and is
discussed separately in Chapter 5. Prior to 1879, the tract was associated with the Allred family,
who lived in Panola County. Jesse Brooks acquired the property in that year, and it remained in the
Brooks family through the twentieth century. Jesseâs son Rueben retained the property until his
death in 1973, and could have occupied the tract. Archival research suggests there are no
significant historical associations with this site. As a result, the property is recommended not
eligible under Criterion A or B.

Discussion and Recommendations

Site 41RK654 appears to represent a historic-aged residence. No structural material or foundations
were observed during the current field effort. However, several possible foundation piers and brick
fragments were noted on-site. Although most of the artifacts recovered on-site are not particularly
temporally sensitive, the presence of solarized glass, stoneware with an Albany-like slip, and a wire
nail suggests an occupation during the early twentieth century.
The site has not maintained depositional integrity, as the immediate vicinity of the site has been
heavily impacted by the construction of a stock pond located just to the east of the site.

Site 41RK654 dates to a well-documented period in local and regional history (Glander et al. 1984;
Skokan et al. 1997) and lacks associative significance that would qualify it for NRHP listing under
Criterion A or B. The site lacks integrity and distinction and does not merit listing on the NRHP
under Criterion C. For these reasons, it is the recommendation of the Principal Investigator that site
41RK654 is ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and that no further work is necessary.

Site 41RK655 (Excluded from Permit Area)
Background

Site 41RK655 is a prehistoric lithic scatter located on a shoulderslope north of an unnamed
ephemeral drainage that feeds into Martin Lake. The siteâs elevation is approximately 330 ft msl.
The soils on-site are mapped as Latex very fine sandy loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes and Woodtell
loam, 5 to 15 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). The soil encountered during shovel testing consisted of
20 to 60 cm of pale brown silty sand to yellowish brown fine sand over strong brown clay subsoil.
Clay soils are much more deeply buried downslope in the eastern portion of the site where sandy
100013883/100196

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
sediments extend in depth as great as 1 m below the ground surface. Ground surface visibility was
entirely obscured by the presence of hardwood leaf litter and grasses.

Work Performed

A total of 13 shovel tests were excavated at 10-m intervals to determine the horizontal and vertical
limits of the site and obtain a representative sample of the artifacts present. Three of the shovel
tests yielded cultural materials. Based upon the distribution of positive shovel tests, the site extends
40 m north-south by 25 m east-west, comprising an area of roughly 1,000 m2 (Figure 107). The site
lacked a surface expression.

Artifact Assemblage

The artifact assemblage recovered from site 41RK655 consists of three pieces of lithic debitage and
a single possible core broken in two pieces. Lithic raw materials represented in this assemblage
include chert, hematite, and silicified wood. These materials were recovered from depths ranging
from 10 to 70 cmbs.

Discussion and Recommendations

Site 41RK655 is a low density prehistoric lithic scatter. Historic land clearing likely resulted in
some turbation of the sediments on-site. The low density of cultural materials present on-site
suggests it resulted from a short-duration occupation some time during the prehistoric period. The
absence of fire-cracked rocks or any preserved subsistence or fuel remains suggests that intact
cultural features have not been preserved on-site. The above observations suggest further that the
site does not harbor significant data resources. For these reasons, it is the opinion of the Principal
Investigator that site 41RK655 does not meet the criteria warranting listing on the NRHP, and no
further work is recommended.

Site 41RK656
Background

Site 41RK656 is a historic farmstead consisting of a standing barn and two wells (one concretelined and one covered). The site is situated near the shoulder of a ridge at an approximate elevation
of 370 ft msl. The terrain is relatively level but slopes very gently northeastward. A modern
residence is situated just south of the site. The soils on-site are mapped as Latex very fine sandy
loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). Shovel testing revealed 10 to 30 cm of brownish yellow
sandy loam over reddish yellow clay.

100013883/100196

336

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
All shovel tests excavated on-site were culturally sterile. The boundaries are consequently based on
surface expression alone. The site is subrectangular in shape and extends 40 m north to south by
30 m east to west, encompassing an area of roughly 1,200 m2 (Figure 108). One standing structure
and two wells are extant within the site boundaries. The structure is a barn standing approximately
35 m north of a modern residence. The barn is wood sided and roofed in galvanized, corrugated
metal panels. The barn has a low second-story hayloft. The pole barn is open on it south side, which
is across its longer axis. It is approximately 8 x 20 m in size. A capped, concrete-lined well is located
a few meters south of the barn in a fenced yard. Another well, this one covered, is located
approximately 30 m south of the barn near the northwest corner of the modern residence.
A second outbuilding, a corrugated metal well pumphouse, is located southwest of the barn and is
likely not historic in age. No contemporaneous residential structure was identified within or near
the boundaries of site 41RK656. It is plausible that a residence contemporaneous with the barn
may have been located where the modern residence stands. The modern residence was occupied
until the summer before the site was recorded. The site is situated in a cleared pasture and was
covered with goldenrod at the time of the survey. The ground surface visibility was very good in
some areas around the barn and about 50 percent elsewhere.

Work Performed

No structures appear at this site on the 1935 aerial photograph or the 1958 USGS Minden 15minute topographic quadrangle. A total of eight shovel tests were excavated at roughly 20-m
intervals in the vicinity of the barn structure to determine the horizontal and vertical extent of the
site. None of these tests were culturally positive.

Historic Standing Structures

This site currently includes a circa 1930 barn located near a nonhistoric-age dwelling. The partially
collapsed barn has a cross-gabled corrugated metal roof that has collapsed, and its exterior has
been reclad in corrugated metal siding (Figure 109). There is an open-air addition on the north
gable end with a shed roof supported by wooden posts. This structure lacks integrity of materials,
design, workmanship, and feeling due to the replacement cladding, partial collapse, and gable-end
addition. Its setting has been altered by the construction of a nonhistoric-age dwelling on the
parcel. Additionally, the structure possesses no known historic associations. It is not recommended
for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion A, B, or C.

Archival Research

Archival research indicates the site was associated with the Stroud family during the nineteenth
century. The Strouds lived elsewhere, and artifacts recovered from this site suggest a twentiethcentury occupation. During the twentieth century, the Lewis Isaac family was associated with the
property, and census research indicates they were an African American family that lived near the

project area. It is likely this site was associated with tenants or with agricultural activities the Isaacs
were doing on the tract. Despite this siteâs associations with African American property owners in
this region, additional archival research is unlikely to provide additional specific information about
the history of this site. As a result, this site is recommended not eligible under Criterion A or B.

Discussion and Recommendations

Site 41RK656 is a historic-aged farmstead with a historic-aged barn and two wells. The barn
structure was standing at the time of the survey; however, no evidence of a contemporaneous
residence was found. Judging from structural elements, as well as the artifacts recovered and
structural materials observed on-site, the farmstead was built and occupied during the early to
mid-twentieth century. The site dates to a well-documented period in local and regional history
(Glander et al. 1984; Skokan et al. 1997) and has no known associative significance that would
qualify it for NRHP listing under Criterion A or B. It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that
site 41RK656 is ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and that no further work is necessary.

Site 41RK662
Background

Site 41RK662 is a newly recorded historic artifact scatter with an associated animal corral (Figure
110). It is located on a shoulderslope at an approximate elevation of 364 ft msl. The site is adjacent
to and south of FM 2658. An unnamed drainage is roughly 50 m east of the site. The site is in a
semiopen pasture with a few very large hardwood trees. The fenceline along the north boundary of
the site along FM 2658 is lined with low scrub brush. Ground surface visibility was obscured by
short grasses. A two-track road, oriented north-south along the west site boundary, did afford
limited ground surface visibility. Soils within the site boundaries consist of Latex very fine sandy
loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). Those encountered in shovel tests were a yellowish
brown to reddish brown sandy loam over sandy reddish brown clay. Based upon surface expression
and the distribution of positive shovel tests, site 41RK662 extends roughly 40 m northwest to
southeast by 25 m northeast to southwest and covers an area of roughly 830 m2 (Figure 111). The
site is associated with an HHPA that was discerned on a 1935 aerial photograph.

Work Performed

Eleven shovel tests were excavated in a cruciform pattern at 15-m intervals to determine the
horizontal and vertical extent of the site. Of the 11 shovel tests excavated, only two (1 and 2) were
culturally positive, yielding a total of six historic artifacts. Shovel Test 1 yielded one artifact, while
Shovel Test 2 yielded five. One artifact was recovered from Level 1 (0 to 10 cmbs), while the
remainder were recovered from Level 2 (10 to 20 cmbs).

Artifact Assemblage
The shovel testing assemblage consists of six artifacts, including one ironstone sherd and five glass
shards. The single ironstone body sherd is undecorated with a crazed surface. Ironstone was
introduced in the 1840s and remains in production today (Stelle 2010). The glass assemblage
recovered consists of four colorless vessel shards and one aqua-tint window shard.

Archival Research

Archival records indicate that this site was likely associated with agricultural operations associated
with the Aus Barr farm. The Barr family owned the property from 1892 through the 1980s.
Although the Barr family were African American farmers, a group underrepresented in the
historical record, this site was likely associated with tenant farmers, as archival information
indicated Barrâs homestead was not located on this tract. Thus, the site does not possess any
historic significance that would qualify it for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion A or B.

Discussion and Recommendations

Site 41RK662 appears to have resulted from a historic ranching occupation during the late
nineteenth to early twentieth centuries. No vestige of a domestic structure is currently observable.
This site dates to a well-documented period in local and regional history (Glander et al. 1984;
Skokan et al. 1997) and has no known associative significance that would qualify it for NRHP listing
under Criterion A or B. It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that site 41RK662 is ineligible
for inclusion in the NRHP, and no further work is necessary.

Site 41RK663
Background

Site 41RK663 is a multicomponent historic/prehistoric site consisting of a historic artifact scatter, a
collapsed well, a dilapidated corral complex including a partially collapsed metal-clad barn (Figure
112), and a sparse scatter of prehistoric lithic debitage. The site rests on a shoulderslope at an
elevation ranging from 354 to 371 ft msl. The landform slopes southward toward the Martin Lake
floodplain. An unnamed tributary of Martin Creek is roughly 150 m south of the site boundary. The
soils on-site are mapped as Sawlit-Sawtown complex, 0 to 2 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). Those
encountered during shovel testing consisted of 20 to 80 cm of brown to yellowish brown sandy
loam over a reddish brown to strong brown clay subsoil.

Based upon the horizontal distribution of surface and subsurface finds, site 41RK663 extends
120 m north-south by 150 m east-west, covering an area of roughly 12,000 m2 (Figure 113). This
figure includes both the larger historic and the smaller prehistoric components. The prehistoric
component was restricted to the highest elevated portion of the landform and extends roughly
20 m north-south by 90 m east-west, covering an area of approximately 2,400 m2 (see Figure 113).

6. Survey Results
The site is located south of a natural gas well pad. The majority of the site is in a semiopen, grassy
field with densely wooded areas around the collapsing barn and along an east-west-oriented
fenceline running through the middle of the site. The vegetation in the wooded areas consists of a
few smaller hardwoods interspersed with dense scrub brush. The ground surface was entirely
obscured within the siteâs boundaries, except along a two-track road running north to south
through the middle of the site. The site is associated with an HHPA discerned on an aerial
photograph dating to 1935.

Work Performed

A surface inspection identified an ephemeral scatter of historic artifacts, consisting of several pieces
of whiteware and glass, adjacent to the collapsed well.

A total of 35 shovel tests were excavated at 15-m intervals to determine the horizontal and vertical
extent of the cultural deposits. Of these tests, nine (4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 29, and 33) were
culturally positive. Shovel tests 4, 5, 12, 13, 15, and 16 yielded only historic materials, while shovel
tests 29 and 33 yielded only prehistoric materials. Shovel Test 11 yielded both historic and
prehistoric artifacts.

Artifact Assemblage

Shovel testing yielded 23 historic artifacts, 4 prehistoric artifacts, and 3 faunal remains.

Historic Assemblage

The historic assemblage includes 4 ceramic sherds, 16 glass shards, 2 pieces of metal, and 1 piece of
rubber.

The historic ceramic assemblage includes two ironstone sherds and two stoneware sherds. One of
the stoneware sherds has an Albany-like slip on both the interior and exterior. The second
stoneware body sherd has an Albany-like slip on both the exterior and interior, but the exterior is
also lightly salt-glazed, which results in a textured surface known as âfrog skinâ (Lebo 1987).

The glass assemblage includes 12 container shards and 4 window pane shards. The containers
include fragments of vessel glass (n = 10) and bottle glass (n = 2). One shard (Lot 6.5) is cobalt blue
Carnival glass. It is vessel body shard with a semitransparent metallic paint on both the interior and
exterior. Carnival glass was first produced in the early 1900s and remained in production until
1940 (Stelle 2010).

The container glass assemblage includes amber, aqua-tint, colorless, and solarized specimens.
Solarized glass dates from around 1890 to 1920. The amber glass most likely postdates 1920 while
the aqua-tint glass most likely predates the 1920s (Lindsey 2011). Bubble inclusions were observed
in four shards of container glass, suggesting discard prior to 1920. A single aqua-tint vessel body

sherd was embossed with indeterminate text. The window glass assemblage consists of three
colorless and one aqua-tint shards.

The metal assemblage consists of one cut and one wire nail. The historic assemblage also includes a
fragment of hard rubber, thought to represent a decorative hair comb, and most likely dates from
1870 to 1910, but could date as early as 1851 or as late as 1920 (Pool 1987).

Prehistoric Assemblage

The prehistoric assemblage includes two complete flakes, one broken flake, and one flake fragment.
None exhibit signs of thermal alteration.

Faunal Remains

The faunal remains appear to represent the historic occupation. The three fragments of bone are
fitters that form a single bone fragment. It is a longbone fragment sawn perpendicular to the axis of
the bone. It is too small and eroded to say with any certainty whether it is machine sawn or hand
sawn, but it looks more likely machine sawn.
When complete, the sawn fragment appears to have been about 3 to 3.5 cm in diameter and cut
about 1 cm in thickness. The size suggests an adult medium-sized mammal (e.g., deer or pig) or an
immature large mammal like a calf.

Archival Research

Archival records suggest that the site was likely associated with the home farm of Hezikiah Pollard,
an African American farmer who purchased the property in 1902 with another African American
farmer named Frank Isabell. Isabell, only owned an interest in the parcel for a short time, but
Pollard was associated with the property from 1902 until his death in 1933. Following Pollardâs
death, the property was owned by his heirs through the 1970s. Despite the propertyâs potential
association with African American property owners, an underrepresented group in the
archeological record, these occupations postdate the period of significance for early African
American settlement in the area. As a result, they do not have the potential to provide additional
information about this group to the historic record and are not recommended for inclusion it he
NRHP.

Discussion and Recommendations

Site 41RK663 has two components. One represents a historic-aged farmstead, while the second
represents a short-duration prehistoric occupation. The historic component consists of a diffuse
artifact scatter, an infilled and sunken well, and a dilapidated corral complex including a partially
collapsed metal-clad barn. No standing residential structures or other structural remains were
identified on-site. The historic artifact assemblage points to an early-twentieth-century domestic
100013883/100196

occupation. The historic component dates to a well-documented period in local and regional history
(Glander et al. 1984; Skokan et al. 1997) and lacks associative significance that would qualify it for
NRHP listing under Criterion A or B. This component also lacks integrity and distinction and does
not merit listing on the NRHP under Criterion C. For these reasons, it is the recommendation of the
Principal Investigator that the historic component at site 41RK663 is ineligible for inclusion in the
NRHP and that no further work is necessary.

The prehistoric component is represented only by four pieces of nondiagnostic chert debitage. The
paucity of cultural materials suggests a short-duration prehistoric occupation. No carbonized
subsistence or fuel remains, diagnostic tools, or cultural features were discovered during
recordation. Due to this apparent lack of significant data resources, it is the opinion of the Principal
Investigator that the prehistoric component at site 41RK663 is ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP
under Criterion D, and no further work is recommended.

Site 41RK664
Background

Site 41RK664 is a newly recorded historic site with a brick garage, a brick pump house, and a
subsurface artifact scatter. A nonhistoric age residence is also on-site. The site sits upon a relatively
flat, broad shoulderslope adjacent to a pond constructed on an unnamed drainage that flows under
FM 2658 and into Martin Lake. The drainage forms the northern site boundary and has been
heavily modified to facilitate water flow through a culvert across FM 2658. The siteâs elevation is
about 335 ft msl. Soils on-site consist of Sawlit-Sawton complex, 0 to 4 percent slopes and Woodtell
loam, 5 to 15 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). Soils encountered during shovel testing consisted of 20
to 40 cm of brown sandy loam over yellowish red to strong brown clay. One shovel test, excavated
near the small pond, exhibited dense, mottled clay from the surface, indicating disturbance from
pond construction.
Based upon the distribution of standing structures and positive shovel tests, site 41RK664 extends
40 m north-south by 55 m east-west, and covers an area of about 2,200 m2 (Figure 114). The
ground surface is mostly obscured within the site boundaries by short grasses. The area
surrounding the two standing structures was relatively undisturbed. The area around these
structures was severely disturbed by earth movement in all directions. These disturbances resulted
from the construction of a small pond to the south of the site, a septic field to the west,
channelization of the creek to the north, and construction of FM 2658 the east.

Work Performed

Site 41RK664 is associated with an HHPA discerned on an aerial photograph from 1935. Six shovel
tests were excavated in a cruciform pattern surrounding the brick garage. Four shovel tests were
culturally positive and yielded a total of 14 artifacts. Level 3 (20â30 cmbs) yielded the highest
100013883/100196

349

6. Survey Results
concentration of artifacts with 9. Level 1 (0â10 cmbs) yielded 3 artifacts, while both levels 2 (10â
20 cmbs) and 4 (30â40 cmbs) yielded one artifact each. Shovel Test 2 yielded the densest
concentration of artifacts with 7. Shovel Test 3 yielded 4 artifacts; Shovel Test 4 yielded 2 artifacts
and Shovel Test 5 yielded 1.

The standing structure on site is a circa 1930 two-bay garage located along with a nonhistoric-age
dwelling (Figure 115). The garage appears to have been a front-gabled structure, but the roofline
has been extended on the primary faÃ§ade to cover an inset porch, providing a hipped roofline. The
original bay doors are no longer extant, and one of the bay openings has been boarded over. The
building is clad in brick veneer, but the original novelty siding is apparent beneath the brick along
the veneer edges. This resource lacks architectural distinction and integrity of association, design,
materials, workmanship, and feeling. It is not recommended for NRHP inclusion under Criteria A, B,
or C.

Artifact Assemblage

Shovel testing yielded a total of 14 historic artifacts including 1 ironstone sherd, 4 colorless glass
shards, 1 aqua-tinted glass shard, 3 wire nails, 2 cut nails, 1 iron bolt, 1 unidentifiable iron
fragment, and 1 machine-made brick fragment. Bubble inclusions were observed in 4 of the glass
shards. The bolt shows evidence of burning and retains a fragment of burned brick on its end. The
unidentifiable iron fragment is flat and possibly represents a container rim. The single brick
recovered is machine made and fragmented but retains a partial makerâs mark. The impressed
mark reads âGREE. . .,â the manufacturing trademark of the Green Press Brick Company. Before the
Green Press Brick Company was bought by Acme-Ferris, they produced âGREENâ bricks from 1917
to 1927 (Steinbomer 1982). The brick exhibits signs of burning.

Archival Investigation

According to archival records, this site was most likely associated with the home farm of S.G. Nutt,
who owned the property from 1917 through 1927. Prior to Nuttâs acquisition of the property, it was
likely owned by nonoccupant owners. Nuttâs ownership of the property corresponds to the period
of production of âGREENâ bricks found at the site. The site does not possess any known historic
associations that would qualify it for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion A or B

Discussion and Recommendations

Site 41RK664 represents an early-twentieth-century residential occupation. The site dates to a
well-documented period in regional history and does not possess significant data resources. The
standing structure on-site lacks architectural merit and distinction. Site 41RK664 does not warrant
NRHP inclusion, and no further work is recommended.

ISOLATED FINDS
Seven isolated finds (IFs) were recorded during the survey of the Liberty Deposit Mine Area. These
localities consisted of four historic finds (IF CROCK 1, IF SJ270, IF RB845, and IF RC 107) and three
prehistoric finds (IF FK57, IF LO102, and IF SJ372). IFs are not considered to be archeological sites
and do not warrant recordation on site forms nor additional work.

Historic Isolated Finds
IF CROCK 1

IF CROCK 1 is a nearly complete stoneware chamber pot with a Bristol glaze on the interior and
exterior surfaces, as well as a cobalt stamped pattern on the exterior. Stoneware with a Bristol glaze
was most popular from around 1890 to 1930 (Stelle 2001). The artifact was found within a small
drainage on the western slope of a high ridge at an elevation of approximately 350 ft msl. The soils
are mapped as Woodtell loam, 5 to 15 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). The crock was recovered from
the surface while investigating an HHPA. The pot was located approximately 40 m south and
downslope from site 41RK636, where it was likely originally discarded during the siteâs occupation,
and from where it has likely been displaced. All of the shovel tests excavated in the vicinity of the
find were culturally sterile.

IF SJ270

IF SJ270 consists of one colorless glass jar shard and one amber bottle glass shard. These artifacts
were found in the bottom of a drainage located approximately 50 m north of and downslope from
site 41RK632. The isolates were located on cleared pastureland where the ground surface was
obscured by short grasses. Both shards were recovered from Level 2 (10 to 20 cmbs) while
excavating a transect shovel test. The soils in the immediate vicinity of the IF are mapped as
Woodtell loam, 5 to 15 percent slopes (NRCS 2010).

IF RB845

IF RB845 is a single heavily weathered Indian Head nickel that was recovered from the surface. The
isolate was found on a broad sloping ridge 775 m north-northwest of the intersection of FM 1251
and FM 2658. The find was located approximately 75 m northwest of an unnamed drainage that has
been dammed to create three stock ponds. The soils in the vicinity of the isolate are mapped as
Woodtell loam, 5 to 15 percent slopes (NRCS 2010).

While the date was worn completely off the nickel, the American buffalo nickel was minted from
1913 to 1938. A type variation was minted the first year with the words âfive centsâ placed beneath
the buffalo on the reverse on a flat surface. In 1914, the dies were changed and the âfive centsâ
wording was placed in a slight depression, as is the case with IF RB845. The recovered nickel,
therefore, dates from 1914 to 1938.

Subsequent to the initial discovery, the field crew was informed by the property owner that the
current location of the propertyâs garden was the area where the original house stood on the
property. The property owner also stated that he has observed several fragments of glass and
ceramics in the area. The garden area was subjected to 14 shovel tests in order to locate artifacts
associated with the reported structure. These tests revealed 20 to 30 cm of light brown silty loam
over a red to strong brown clay subsoil. No cultural materials were identified in any of the shovel
tests excavated in or near the vicinity of the garden. No glass or ceramics were observed on the
surface; however, several fragments of white PVC pipe were observed. Several small nails were also
observed on the surface; however, these matched the nails that were used to create latticework
being used to support pea vines in the garden.

IF RC107

IF RC107 consists of s single stoneware sherd with an Albany slip glaze on the interior and the
exterior. The sherd was recovered from Level 1 (0 to 10 cmbs) of a survey shovel test. IF RC107
was located about 180 m to the southwest of HS01 on the a ridge shoulder.

Prehistoric Isolated Finds
IF FK57

IF FK57 is one complete silicified wood secondary flake that was recovered from Level 1 of a
transect shovel test. The isolate was found on a broad sloping ridge 50 m north of the Dry Creek
tributary arm of Martin Lake. The find was located approximately 200 m southeast of 41RK615.
The soils in the vicinity of the isolate are mapped as Sawlit-Sawton complex, 0 to 2 percent slopes
(NRCS 2010).

Subsequent to the initial discovery, eight additional shovel tests were excavated in a cruciform
pattern centered upon the isolated find. These tests revealed 20 to 50 cm of light brown loamy sand
over a red to strong brown clay subsoil. No cultural materials were identified in any of the other
test excavated in the immediate vicinity of IF FK57.

IF LO102

IF LO102 is one chert biface fragment that is too incomplete to assign to a reduction stage. It was
recovered from Level 3 of a transect shovel test. The find was located 35 m west of an unnamed
drainage. The isolate was recovered at an elevation of 325 ft msl. Soils in the vicinity of the isolate
are mapped as Cuthbert fine sandy loam with 5 to 15 percent slopes (NRCS 2010).
Subsequent to the initial discovery, eight additional shovel tests were excavated in a cruciform
pattern centered upon the isolated find. These tests revealed 20 to 40 cm of yellowish brown sandy
loam over a strong brown clay subsoil. No cultural materials were identified in any of the other
tests excavated in the immediate vicinity of IF LO102.

IF SJ372
IF SJ372 is one chert tertiary flake that exhibits evidence of thermal alteration. The isolate was
found approximately 100 m west of the Martin Lake shoreline and 400 m northwest of site
41RK629. The find was recovered on the west shoulderslope of a high ridge at an elevation of 325 ft
msl. The soils are mapped as Latex very fine sandy loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes (NRCS 2010).
Subsequent to the initial discovery, eight additional shovel tests were excavated in a cruciform
pattern centered upon the isolated find. These tests revealed 40 to 60 cm of pale brown sand over
red clay subsoil. No cultural materials were identified in any of the other tests excavated in the
immediate vicinity of IF SJ372.

IF RB818

IF RB818 is a single piece of prehistoric quartzite lithic debitage found while shovel testing a
shoulder ridge at an approximate elevation of 330 ft msl. The nearest known natural source of
water is Beard Branch approximately 400 m to the south. The current environmental setting is
open oak woodlands. The soil in the area is mapped as Sawlit-Sawton Complex, 0 to 2 percent
slopes (NRCS 2010). Six additional shovel tests were excavated around the original positive test, all
of which were culturally sterile. Shovel testing at the find revealed pale brown silty loam extending
50 to 90 cmbs over strong brown clay.

HISTORIC-AGE NONARCHEOLOGICAL RESOURCES

Project historians recorded 18 locations containing 27 historic-age nonarcheological resources
within the Liberty Deposit Mine Area boundaries (see Appendix 125(2)-D). During the survey,
historians were also aware of the possibility for historic districts to exist within the project area.
Historians did not identify any potentially NRHP-eligible historic districts through this effort.
Historians also undertook a limited rural historic landscape analysis for the area, and it was found
to not maintain sufficient integrity to be eligible as a landscape.

For the purposes of this report, historic-age nonarcheological resources are those structures,
buildings, objects, or districts 50-years-of-age or older (built prior to 1960) that were not
associated with a recorded archeological site. Though the majority may not be individually eligible
for listing on the NRHP under Criterion C for their architectural merit or design distinction, further
evaluation of their significance under Criterion D may need to be conducted if their surrounding
parcels are targeted for mine use. Assessments of structures associated with recorded archeological
sites are included earlier in this chapter.

Resource 01 is a circa 1955 single-family dwelling located on Luminant Tract 1248. This resource
is located on the same parcel as several nonhistoric-age outbuildings. The resource is an irregularplan, hipped-roof dwelling with Minimal Traditional and Ranch influences. The exterior has been
100013883/100196

355

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
reclad with synthetic siding, and it has a rear covered porch addition and a covered carport
addition. This resource is of common design and lacks historic significance. Additionally, it lacks
integrity of materials, design, and setting, does not maintain any known historic associations, and is
not recommended for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion A, B, or, C.

Resource 03 includes an abandoned dwelling (03A) and associated outbuilding (03B) located on
Luminant Tract 1311. Resource A is a circa 1935, front-gabled, wood-framed bungalow with several
additions. A large portion of the exterior has been reclad in wood paneling, and the visible windows
are replacement metal-sash units. The original entry porch had been enclosed. Resource B is a small
shed that was heavily obscured by dense vegetation. It appears to have a gabled roof and wooden
paneling replacement siding. Resource A lacks known historic associations and does not possess
any architectural merit. The presence of nonhistoric-age structures on adjacent parcels detracts
from its integrity of setting, and the replacement windows and cladding and multiple additions
detract from its integrity of design, materials, workmanship, and feeling. Resource B lacks integrity
of setting, materials, and workmanship and possesses no known historic associations or
architectural merit. Neither of these structures is recommended for inclusion in the NRHP under
Criterion A, B, or C.

Resource 04 is a circa 1960 single-family dwelling located on Luminant Tract 1308. This structure
is a side-gabled, linear-plan, wood-framed dwelling. The roof is clad in replacement composition
shingles and has exposed rafter tails. The primary entry is offset on the southern faÃ§ade and
consists of a single, hinged replacement entry door with a metal-and-glass storm door. The entry is
covered by a cantilevered stoop supported by wooden braces. The building has a variety of window
types including 2/2 (horizontally oriented panes), 3/3, and 6/6 wood-sash units. The exterior is
clad in horizontal wooden siding. This dwelling is of common design and lacks any known historic
associations or architectural merit. The resourceâs setting has been altered by the presence of
several nonhistoric-age structures on this parcel and in the immediate vicinity. This resource is not
recommended for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion A, B, or C.

Resource 05 is a circa 1930, wood-framed, single-family dwelling located on Luminant Tract 1312.
This bungalow has a front-gabled roof with a partial-width, front-gabled, projecting entry porch.
The porch is supported by replacement wooden posts and has a replacement wooden balustrade.
The primary entry is located off-center within the entry porch and consists of a replacement, singlehinged door with a multilight vision panel. Given the unusual placement of the door and windows
on the primary faÃ§ade, the fenestration pattern may have been altered. This resource has
replacement windows, and the exterior has been reclad. The dwelling lacks known historic
associations and architectural merit. Furthermore, it lacks integrity of materials, design,
workmanship, and feeling due its many alterations and is not recommended for NRHP inclusion
under Criterion A, B, or C.

100013883/100196

6. Survey Results
Resource 06 is a circa 1940, T-plan, cross-gabled single-family dwelling with numerous shedroofed additions located on Luminant Tract 1317. The exterior has been reclad in synthetic siding,
and the windows are metal-sash replacement units. The setting has been altered by the presence of
a nonhistoric-age dwelling on the parcel located directly behind the resource. The physical
alterations to the resource detract from its integrity of materials, design, workmanship, and feeling.
Additionally, the resource has no known historic associations and lacks architectural distinction.
This resource is not recommended for NRHP inclusion under Criterion A, B, or C.
Resource 07 is the Chapel Hill or Trammell Cemetery. This resource is located just outside of but
adjacent to the permit boundary on Luminant Tract 545D, and is included in this report due to its
close proximity to the project. The current mine boundary runs along the eastern edge of the
cemetery.
The cemetery appears to be an African American cemetery dating to at least 1880 when John and
America Waskom deeded the property to Morris Walton Charles et al. as Trustees of the Springfield
Church for use as a âchurch and graveyardâ (Rusk County Deed Records 28:278). America Waskom
was the daughter of area plantation owner Mark Stroud whom census records imply enslaved a
large number of people prior to the Civil War. Her association with the property suggests that the
burial ground may have had antebellum origins.
The 1880 Rusk County census indicates that Charles Morris (35) was living in Justice Precinct 5
with his parents Edmund (48) and Mary (50), sister Fannie (16), a nephew Moses Jolley (1 month),
and a boarder Henry Bachelor (25). All members of the household were indexed as black. Edmund,
Fannie, and Henry are listed as farm laborers, but there is no occupation listed for Charles. It is
possible that Charles Morris is the same individual listed in the deed records as Morris Walton
Charles; no Charleses are listed in the Rusk County census records from 1880 through 1920, and
the lone 1870 entry is for Holland Charles.

The earliest marked graves date to the 1880s, after the Waskomsâ donation of the land, but there
are also some possible burials marked with plain stones and several depressions within the
cemetery that may represent unmarked graves. This cemetery is still in use, and most of the recent
burials are located near the front (southern portion) of the cemetery. Several African American
families known to have lived in the area in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries have
family members buried in this cemetery. These include the Barr, Humphrey, Menefee, and Booty
families (see Chapter 5 for more information about these families).

Although this cemetery does not appear to contain the graves of persons of transcendent
importance or exhibit distinctive design qualities as outlined in Criteria Consideration D for
cemeteries, if it dates to the antebellum period, it is much older than the archeological sites that
were identified in the project area. Additionally, it may maintain historic associations with African
American settlement in the region and with Liberty or Chapel Hill, a historic Freedmanâs
100013883/100196

357

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
community that developed in the surrounding area during the Reconstruction era. The cemetery
may also have the potential to yield important information about African American history in the
project vicinity. Additional research would be required to determine the cemeteryâs age and
potential associations with important development patterns, thus its eligibility under Criteria A and
D are presently unknown.

Despite its potential Criteria A and D associations, the cemetery does not appear to merit NRHP
inclusion under Criterion C. There are several nonhistoric-age intrusions to the site that impact its
historic integrity, including replacement chain-link fencing, a restroom building addition, an openair shelter addition, and several replacement grave markers. These alterations detract from its
integrity of materials, workmanship, design, and feeling, and it does not contain any markers with
distinctive artistic or design qualities. Additionally, the cemetery does not appear to maintain any
known associations with significant individuals and is not recommended for NRHP inclusion under
Criterion B.
In addition to the NRHP considerations, the newly amended Texas Health and Safety Code (Chapter
711) has resulted in changes to the regulations concerning cemeteries, including the THCâs role in
the treatment of nonperpetual-care historic-age cemeteries. Although they have not yet adopted
formal written rules in association with this law, THC has provided verbal guidance for projects
that have the potential to impact a cemetery, especially for those cemeteries containing potential
unmarked burials. If a project passes within 75 ft of a known cemetery, THC has required
archeological investigation to determine whether unmarked graves are present; however, the
preferred option, and the recommendation for this project, is to avoid impacting the cemetery by
preserving a buffer around the cemetery.

Field observation indicates additional unmarked burials likely exist in this cemetery, based on the
presence of depressions, replacement markers, and on marker orientation. As discussed above,
there are several depressions with no associated markers present. In addition, some markers are
new, polished granite stones, yet the dates of death indicate a substantial amount of time has
passed. This suggests these markers may have been recently installed in the cemetery, and could
have replaced temporary or broken markers or could have been added to mark a burial based on
memory of where that person was buried. Marker orientation also suggests that burials in this
cemetery are not highly organized, as many of the markers face different directions. Based on these
observations and in compliance with the Texas Health and Safety Code, it is recommended that the
project include a 100-ft buffer around the cemetery. If this is not possible, the area adjacent to the
cemetery will have to be scraped in coordination with THC guidelines to identify any unmarked
burials that might lie within the project area.
Resource 08 is the circa 1930 Chapel Hill Baptist Church, located on Luminant Tract 1256. In May
1914, Aus and Celia Barr sold 1 acre to the Deacons of the Chapel Hill Church (Rusk County Deed
Records 110:113). The proximity of this church to an African American cemetery and its association
100013883/100196

358

6. Survey Results
with the Barr family, early African American residents of the project vicinity, suggest that it has
associations with the areaâs African American history. This resource is a cross-gabled, T-plan,
wood-framed building. The primary entry is located within a recessed entry porch that extends
from the primary faÃ§ade via a shed-roofed porch addition supported by metal poles. The exterior
has been reclad in synthetic siding, and there is a rear addition. These alterations detract from the
resourceâs integrity of materials, design, workmanship, and feeling.

According to NRHP Criteria Consideration A, religious properties may only be eligible for inclusion
in the NRHP for their secular historic significance or architectural merit. As this resource lacks
historic integrity and does not possess any architectural or design distinction, it is not
recommended for inclusion under Criterion C. Additionally, the resource does not maintain known
associations with any significant individuals that would qualify it for NRHP listing under Criterion
B. Furthermore, the resource does not appear to have influenced area settlement patterns, but
rather is a result of local African American settlement during the 1870s. This resource is not
recommended for inclusion in the NRHP.
Resource 09 is a circa 1960 wood-framed barn located on Luminant Tract 1262. The barn is a
double-pen, pull-through barn that once had a metal roof. This resource is in poor condition, and
most of its architectural features are no longer intact, including its exterior cladding. The barn is
located on a heavily overgrown tract of land, and no associated structures or land use pattern is
present. This resource lacks integrity of materials, design, workmanship, setting, feeling, and
association and is not recommended for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion A, B, or C.

Resource 10 is the 1955 rebuilt Springfield C.M.E. Church, located on Tract 591B. It is unknown
when the original church was constructed, but in 1880 John and America Waskom deeded 1 acre of
land to Morris Walton Charles et al. as Trustees of the Springfield Church for use as a âchurch and
graveyardâ (Rusk County Deed Records 28:278). This 1 acre is located to the northwest of Resource
09 and currently includes only the Chapel Hill/Trammell Cemetery. It is possible that the original
Springfield Church was located within the current boundaries of the cemetery property. Historic
map and 1935 aerial photograph research indicates that this resource was not located at its current
site as late as 1936 (Texas State Highway Department 1936).

The church is a front-gabled, T-plan, wood-framed building with a cross-gabled roof. The roof is
clad in replacement composite shingles. The resourceâs primary entry is located on its western
faÃ§ade and consists of a pair of replacement hinged doors beneath a projecting, front-gabled entry
porch. The porch is supported by replacement turned wooden supports. The windows are 6/6
wood-sash units with tinted synthetic lights. There are two secondary entrances at the intersection
of the two wings composed of replacement hinged doors with single-bay stoop porches supported
by wooden brackets. The exterior is clad in horizontal Dolly Varden siding.

According to Criteria Consideration A, religious properties may only be eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP for their secular historic significance or architectural merit. As this resource does not possess
any architectural merit, it is not recommended for inclusion under Criterion C. Furthermore, a
religious propertyâs historic significance must be linked to a secular, not religious, historic trend or
event. Although the church appears to have been originally associated with early African American
settlement in the area, as a rebuilt structure at another location, it does not adequately represent
early African American history in the project vicinity. Thus, this resource is not recommended for
inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion A, B, or C.

Resources 11AâD include a single-family dwelling and three outbuildings located on Luminant
Tract 1343. Resource 11A is a circa 1935, wood-framed, single-family dwelling. The front-gabled
bungalow has a partial-width, offset, front-gabled entry porch. The primary entry is located
centrally within the entry porch and consists of a replacement multilight door with a replacement
metal-and-glass storm door. The porch has three bays with replacement prefabricated metal
supports and a replacement railing on the concrete porch stairs. The exterior is clad in replacement
synthetic siding, and the original windows have been replaced with metal units. Resource 11B is a
circa 1935 two-bay garage. The original bay doors have been replaced, and the exterior is clad in
replacement siding. Resource C is a circa 1935 domestic outbuilding that was not fully visible from
the public right of way. This resource has a front-gabled roof and is clad in vertical wooden siding.
Resource D is a small, wood-framed, gable-roofed shed clad in corrugated metal with a pent roof
lateral addition.

All of the resources lack historic integrity and/or architectural significance. Alterations to resources
11A and B detract from their integrity of materials, workmanship, and feeling. Additionally, both
buildings lack architectural significance and are of common design. Resources 11C and D retain a
degree of their historic integrity, but both are a ubiquitous building type and style. All of the
resources lack known historic associations and are not recommended for NRHP inclusion under
any applicable criteria, either individually or as a group.
Resource 12 includes a circa 1940 dwelling (12A) and a circa 1960 shed (12B) located on
Luminant Tract 1340. Resource A is a side-gabled, wood-framed single-family dwelling. The roof is
clad in composite shingles and has exposed rafter tails. This resource has a shed-roofed, projecting
entry porch supported by prefabricated metal supports. The entry porch and primary entry are
located slightly off-center on the eastern faÃ§ade. The exterior is clad in asbestos shingles, and the
skirt wall is clad in false-brick rolled composite sheeting. The windows are replacement metal-sash
units. Resource B has a front-gabled roof and is clad in corrugated metal. Both resources lack
integrity of materials, workmanship, and feeling due to alterations such as recladding, window
replacements, and porch alterations. Additionally, both resources are of ubiquitous design and lack
any known historic associations. Thus, these structures are not recommended for inclusion in the
NRHP under Criterion A, B, or C.

Resource 13 is a circa 1935 wood-framed bungalow located on Luminant Tract 591. The resource
fronts onto FM 2658 and has a front-gabled roof with an offset, partial-width, front-gabled entry
porch. The windows are 6/6 wood-sash units with metal screens. The primary entry consists of a
replacement hinged door with a multilight vision panel. The original porch supports have been
replaced with wooden posts. There are two brick chimneys including a central internal chimney
and an external chimney on the primary gable end. The porch alterations detract from the
resourceâs integrity of materials, design, workmanship, and feeling. Additionally, this resource is of
common design and lacks historic associations. Thus, the dwelling is not recommended for
inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion A, B, or C.

Resource 14 is a circa 1925 single-family dwelling located on Luminant Tract 594J. This resource
has a side-gabled roof with a front-gabled dormer along the roof ridge. The projecting, front-gabled
roof is supported by replacement columns on brick piers. The entry is located centrally within the
porch and consists of a replacement hinged door with a large oval vision light and a replacement
oval sidelight. The windows are replacement 1/1, single-hung units, and the exterior is clad in
replacement synthetic siding. The resource has two rear additions and a brick exterior chimney in
the gable end. The numerous alterations to the resource and replacement components detract from
its integrity of materials, workmanship, design, and feeling. Furthermore, this resource retains no
known historic associations. Thus, it is not recommended for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion
A, B, or C.

Resource 15 includes a dwelling (A) and associated shed (B) located on Luminant Tract 594.
Resource 15A is a circa 1955, single-family dwelling with a side-gabled roof clad in composite
shingles. The primary entry is located off-center on the eastern faÃ§ade. It consists of a single hinged
door with a metal-and-glass storm door. This entry is sheltered by a small, cantilevered porch
projection. There is a shed-roofed covered parking addition on the southern faÃ§ade that detracts
from the resourceâs integrity of design. Resource 15B is a small, front-gabled, circa 1960 shed.
Though these resources retain historic integrity, they lack requisite significance to qualify for
inclusion in the NRHP. Additionally, they maintain no known historic associations and are not
recommended for NRHP inclusion under Criterion A, B, or C.

Resources 16A and B are two outbuildings associated with a nonhistoric-age dwelling located on
Luminant Tract 1371. Resource 16A is a circa 1940 front-gabled barn with a lateral, shed-roofed,
open-air addition. The resource has a window in the southern faÃ§ade, and the southern faÃ§ade is
clad in an uncoursed stone veneer. The remainder of the building appears to be clad in wood
paneling and wooden siding. Resource 16B is a circa 1930 large, front-gabled, partially collapsed
barn. This resource has a corrugated metal roof, and the exterior is clad in corrugated metal. The
structure has a central pull-through bay and pent-roofed bays on the lateral faÃ§ades. Both of these
resources lack architectural distinction and historic associations. Furthermore, Resource A has
been partially reclad and had an addition, detracting from its integrity of materials, workmanship,
and design. Both resourcesâ setting has been altered by the construction of a large, nonhistoric-age
100013883/100196

dwelling on the property. These resources are not recommended eligible for inclusion in the NRHP
under Criterion A, B, or C.

Resources 17A and B are a single-family dwelling and outbuilding located on Luminant Tract
1369. Resource 17A is a circa 1900, wood-framed, gable-roofed dwelling. This resource is clad in
vertical wooden siding with lapped horizontal siding in the gable ends. It has shed-roofed additions
on three faÃ§ades that are also clad in vertical wooden siding. None of the windows or doors was
visible from the public right of way, and permissible access to the property was not granted.
Resource 17B is a circa 1930 front-gabled barn. This resource has a central pull-through bay with
two lateral, shed-roofed pens. It has been reclad in corrugated metal. Resource A lacks integrity of
materials, design, workmanship, association, and feeling due to the numerous additions that make
its original materials and design virtually indistinguishable. Resource B lacks integrity of materials,
workmanship, and feeling due to the recladding and is of common design. Neither resource is
recommended for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion A, B, or C.

Resources 18A and B, a dwelling and outbuilding, are located on Luminant Tract 1381. Resource
18A is a circa 1960 single-family dwelling. It has a cross-gabled roof, synthetic siding, and a shedroofed front-porch addition supported by wooden posts. Resource 18B is a circa 1930 outbuilding
of indeterminate function. The resource has a gabled roof and is clad in beveled wooden siding. The
visible windows (in the gable end and on one lateral faÃ§ade) are 2/2 wooden-sash units. Despite the
lack of access, historians were able to evaluate the resources from the public right of way. Resource
A is of common design and lacks architectural distinction. Additionally, the porch addition detracts
from its integrity of design, workmanship, and materials. Resource Bâs setting has been altered by
the demolition of its associated structures and the construction of a noncontemporaneous building
(Resource A) on the property. Thus, neither resource is recommended for inclusion in the NRHP
under Criterion A, B, or C. These resources have been excluded from the permit area.

Resources 19A and B are located on Luminant Tract 1353. The site includes a historic-age
dwelling (A), a historic-age barn (B), and a nonhistoric-age outbuilding. Resource A is a circa 1930
gable-roofed, single-family dwelling with exposed rafter tails. The exterior is clad in wooden
novelty siding and it has replacement metal-sash windows. There are two brick chimneys, one
internal and one external, on the western gable end. Resource B is a circa 1930 barn. This partially
collapsed resource has a gabled roof and is clad in wooden board-and-batten siding. Due to the
dilapidated condition of the resource, many of its architectural features are no longer extant,
including its windows and doors. Resource A lacks integrity of materials, workmanship, and feeling
due to the replacement windows. Resource B also lacks integrity of materials, design, workmanship,
and feeling due to its poor condition and missing architectural features. The siteâs overall setting
has been altered by the overgrowth of formerly associated fields and the presence of a nonhistoricage shed and trailer in the immediate vicinity. Neither of these resources is recommended for
inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion A, B, or C.

HISTORIC LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS
In addition to evaluating the individual historic-age nonarcheological resources within the Liberty
Mine area, historians also conducted a brief assessment of the landscape to determine if it may be
eligible for inclusion in the NRHP as a rural historic landscape. Recent trends in cultural resource
management by federal and state regulatory agencies are placing greater emphasis on evaluating
those resources as elements of their surrounding landscapes. Rural historic landscapes are largearea resources that may retain sufficient levels of historical importance and integrity to be eligible
for National Register listing as a special type of historic district. According to National Register
Bulletin No. 30, Guidelines for Evaluating and Documenting Rural Historic Landscapes, evaluation of
these large-area resources requires a multidisciplinary approach to recognize, record, and assess
the importance of a wide variety of land uses and landscape elements that make up a landscape.
During a rural historic landscape evaluation, landscape features not typically recorded (e.g., roads,
fence lines, cultivated fields, windbreaks, etc.) are documented and included in the evaluation along
with those resources typically recorded during surveys (e.g., archeological sites, standing buildings,
structures, etc.). Methods used to gather the necessary documentation include a combination of onthe-ground documentation of existing conditions as well as analysis of maps and aerial photographs
that depict progressive patterns of continuity or change over time.

Historians evaluated the significance and integrity of the 11 characteristics of rural historic
landscapes as outlined in National Register Bulletin No. 30. These characteristics include âLand Use
and Activities,â âPatterns of Spatial Organization,â âResponse to the Natural Environment,â âCultural
Traditions,â âCirculation Networks,â âBoundary Demarcations,â âVegetation Related to Land Use,â
âBuildings, Structures, and Objects,â âClusters,â âArcheological Sites,â and âSmall Scale Elements.â
This analysis is based both on the field survey and a comparison of historic and current maps and
aerial photography of the project area.
During its period of significance, from the 1850s through the 1930s, the most prominent land use in
the project area appears to have been agriculture. Cotton cultivation rose to prominence in the
1860s with the rise of large-scale plantation farming and continued through the 1940s on smaller
farms. Historians compared a historic map from the 1860s, (near the beginning of the period of
significance), a 1935 aerial photograph (near the end of the period of significance), and current
aerial photographs of the area to generally analyze how the landscape evolved from circa 1850
through circa 1940 and how the current landscape compares to that which existed during the
period of significance.

An 1863 map of the area shows several large plowed fields and roadways in the project vicinity.
Although the land use in the area continued to focus on agriculture, by the mid-1930s, the physical
manifestation of the land use had evolved. In the area south of Martin Lake, in particular, it appears
that the land use shift from large-scale plantation agriculture to smaller-scale farming was linked, in
part, to a rise in African American farmers settling in the area. Several African Americans, possibly
100013883/100196

363

Liberty Deposit Mine Area
former slaves, settled in this area in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and a large
percentage of these farmers retained their farmsteads through the mid-twentieth century. A 1935
aerial photograph shows a larger number of smaller plowed fields in the southern and eastern
portions of the project area and large areas of undeveloped land in the northwestern portion. The
1935 map also shows evidence of agricultural innovation since the 1860s including water and soil
conservation projects such as terracing and water reservoirs. Currently, most of the project area is
no longer used for cultivation, affecting the physical appearance of the landscape, including the
cultural landscape resulting from the settlement of African American farmers in the area in the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Virtually all of the cultivated fields evident on the 1935
aerial photograph are no longer extant and are used for oil and gas extraction or grazing land. Only
vestigial remains of terracing are evident, and some of the former farmlands have been planted in
pine.

As the area land use trended out of agriculture, the landscape changed dramatically. Cultivated
fields and farmsteads were overtaken by native vegetation and abandoned, erasing the evidence of
historic land use patterns, response to the natural environment, patterns of spatial organization,
circulation networks, boundary demarcations, and land use vegetation. Further fostering the
change to the landscape was the advent of mining in the area and the inundation of Martin Lake.
According to historic aerial photography and historic map analysis, these two events led to
rerouting of circulation networks, affected the integrity of archeological sites, and changed human
response to the natural environment. Martin Lake, formerly Martin Creek, once served as a
subsistence water source for area farmers. At present, it is used for recreation and as a cooling lake
for the large electric-generation plant in the area. These alterations to the landscape detract from
its integrity of materials, workmanship, design, feeling, association, and setting, and the area is not
recommended for inclusion in the NRHP as a rural historic district.

RECOMMENDATIONS
During the present investigation, 59 archeological sites were evaluated, including 8 previously
recorded sites, within the Liberty Deposit Mine Area. Eight isolated finds, which are not considered
archeological sites, were also located.

Of the 59 sites evaluated during the present investigations, 38 (41RK12, 41RK34, 41RK609,
41RK610, 41RK611, 41RK612, 41RK617, 41RK618, 41RK619, 41RK620, 41RK624, 41RK625,
41RK626, 41RK627, 41RK628, 41RK630, 41RK632, 41RK633, 41RK635, 41RK636, 41RK637,
41RK638, 41RK639, 41RK640, 41RK641, 41RK642, 41RK643, 41RK644, 41RK647, 41RK648,
41RK649, 41RK650, 41RK651, 41RK653, 41RK654, 41RK656, 41RK662, and 41RK664) have
historic components, 17 (41RK13, 41RK14, 41RK16, 41RK26, 41RK27, 41RK29, 41RK32, 41RK187,
41RK614, 41RK615, 41RK616, 41RK621, 41RK623, 41RK629, 41RK646, 41RK652, and 41RK655)
have prehistoric components, and 4 (41RK35, 41RK613, 41RK631, and 41RK663) have both
historic and prehistoric components.

Table 12 lists each site by type and recommended NRHP eligibility status. All of the 38 historic sites
evaluated (41RK12, 41RK34, 41RK609, 41RK610, 41RK611, 41RK612, 41RK617, 41RK618,
41RK619, 41RK620, 41RK624, 41RK625, 41RK626, 41RK627, 41RK628, 41RK630, 41RK632,
41RK633, 41RK635, 41RK636, 41RK637, 41RK638, 41RK639, 41RK640, 41RK641, 41RK642,
41RK643, 41RK644, 41RK647, 41RK648, 41RK649, 41RK650, 41RK651, 41RK653, 41RK654,
41RK656, 41RK662, and 41RK664 ) are thought to be ineligible for NRHP inclusion, and no further
work is recommended.

Of the 17 prehistoric sites evaluated, 15 (41RK13, 41RK14, 41RK16, 41RK26, 41RK27, 41RK29,
41RK614, 41RK615, 41RK616, 41RK621, 41RK623, 41RK629, 41RK646, 41RK652, and 41RK655)
are thought to lack sufficient data resources to warrant NRHP inclusion, and no further work is
recommended. The NRHP eligibility status of the remaining 2 prehistoric sites (41RK32 and
41RK187) remains undetermined. It is recommended that mine-related impact to these sites be
avoided. If this is not possible, NRHP eligibility testing is recommended.

The historic and prehistoric components at the multicomponent sites (41RK35, 41RK613,
41RK631, and 41RK663) appear to lack the data resources warranting NRHP inclusion, and no
further work is recommended.

Project historians recorded 18 locations containing 27 historic-age nonarcheological resources
within the Liberty Deposit Mine Area boundaries. None of these properties possess sufficient
integrity or historic associations to merit inclusion in the NRHP under any criteria, and no further
consideration of these properties is recommended.
