ABSTRACT
Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) performed a cultural
resources survey at the site of a proposed 12-acre wetlands treatment plant and
1000 feet of pipeline in central Angelina County, Texas in March of 2007 for the
Redland Water Supply Corporation (WSC). This project was conducted under
Texas Antiquities Committee permit number 3766. The project area was
investigated by shovel testing. Most of the soils consisted of a shallow clay with
few areas of deep sand. No archaeological sites were found, and it is
recommended that construction be allowed to proceed as planned. Copies of the
final report are on file at the Texas Historical Commission (THC) and Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas and BVRA in Bryan,
Texas.

INTRODUCTION
The Redland WSC proposes to construct a wetlands treatment plant on a
twelve-acre site and install 1000 feet of water line in central Angelina County,
Texas (Figure 1). The project area is depicted on the topographic quadrangle,
Redland, Texas (3194-243) (Figure 2). Because of the proximity of the project
area to a stream, an archaeological survey was recommended by the Texas
Parks and Wildlife Department. In order to comply with this request, the Redland
WSC retained BVRA to conduct this service which was performed under Texas
Antiquities permit 3766 with William E. Moore the Principal Investigator. The size
of the footprint of the wetlands treatment plant will be 260 feet x 600 feet (3.5
acres). Subsurface construction within this area will be four feet. The rest of the
12 acres will not be affected except for the water line that will connect an
existing, non-operational sewer plant with the proposed wetlands treatment plant.
The pipe for the water line will be 10 inches in diameter and will be placed in a
trench 18 inches in diameter and eight feet deep. There will be a 15-foot
easement. Construction is scheduled to begin on August of 2007.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The following general discussion was taken from the Soil Survey of
Angelina County, Dolezel (1988:1-4). Angelina County is located in the central
part of East Texas. The northern and southern parts of the county have a
dendritic drainage system with many large streams. Two rivers, Neches and
Angelina, drain the county. Elevation ranges from about 100 feet in the south
near the Neches River to about 460 feet in the northern part of the county.
Angelina County is in the East Texas Timberlands Land Resource Area and
forest products are a major part of the local economy. Soils in this area formed
mainly under forest vegetation in a humid environment, and most are light in
color and low in natural fertility. Nearly level areas are often wet, and moderately
steep to steep areas tend to erode easily. The county has long, hot summers
because of moist tropical air from the Gulf of Mexico persistently covers the area.
Winters are cool and fairly short. Rainfall is fairly heavy throughout the year, and
prolonged droughts are rare. The total annual precipitation is 41 inches. Of this,
21 inches (50%) usually falls in April through September. In winter, the average
temperature is 50 degrees Fahrenheit, and the average daily minimum
temperature is 39 degrees. In summer, the average temperature is 82 degrees,
and the average daily maximum temperature is 93 degrees.
According to the soil survey (Dolezel 1988:Sheet 7), the entire project
area is located in Woodtell very fine sandy loam, 1 to 5 percent slopes (WoB)
(Figure 3). This soil is described by Dolezel (1988:62) as being located on gently
sloping broad ridges. It developed in marine shells and clays and in some areas
the surface has small humps of gilgai about two to three inches high. This soil
has a very fine sandy loam surface layer about four inches thick. The subsoil is
plastic and sticky clay and extends to a depth of 41 inches. Below that is a
stratum of shale. This soil is very slowly permeable and moderately well drained.
Water erosion is a severe hazard.
At the time of this survey the project area consisted of woods and cleared
areas. Much of the area had been disturbed by past lumbering activities. The
site of the proposed wetlands treatment plant site showing woods and clearing is
depicted in Figure 4, and Figure 5 depicts brush and shallow clays along the
1000-foot water line.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
According to a recently published planning document for the Eastern
Planning Region of Texas (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 1.1.2), Angelina
County is situated within the Northeast Texas archeological study region. In
1985, according to a statistical overview prepared by the Texas Historical
Commission (Biesaart et al. 1985:107), Angelina County contained 52 recorded
sites. The site files at TARL revealed 172 recorded sites at the time of this
survey. In 1985, 1 site in the county had been excavated, 21 had been tested by
hand, 1 had been tested by machine, 30 sites had been dug by collectors, and
46 had been surface collected. Nine recorded prehistoric sites in the county
were listed as Archaic, and 41 sites were listed as Late Prehistoric (Biesaart et
al. 1985:108). Five sites contained burials.
In 1991, an evaluation was made of significant sites in the Northeast
Texas Archeological Region (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Table 2.1.1). At this
time Angelina County contained 121 recorded prehistoric sites; of this number 19
were listed as not significant, 67 as unknown significance, 35 as probably
significant, and 22 as significant. Today, the number of sites in the county
exceeds 190.
The archaeological significance of Angelina County is partially reflected in
the following statistics. In 1993, the county contained the second highest number
of important known hunter-gatherer sites in Northeast Texas (n=3) (Kenmotsu
and Perttula 1993:Figure 2.3.3) and also contained at least 13 important Late
Caddoan sites (n=13) (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 2.5.2). Unfortunately,
there are major forces that continue to threaten the integrity of archaeological
sites in Angelina County. These include population growth (City of Lufkin and
surrounding area), highway construction, surface lignite mining, Sam Rayburn
Reservoir (formerly McGee Bend), and the lumbering industry.
Although private contract archaeology firms have played a part, most of
the archaeological sites known to exist in Angelina County have been identified
by surveys associated with reservoir construction and in-house projects by
National Forest personnel. The earliest archaeological research in the area was
performed in the late 1930s and early 1940s by researchers from The University
of Texas at Austin. At that time prehistoric cemeteries and mound sites were
considered to be of primary importance. From the late 1940s until the mid
1970s, most of the archaeological research in East Texas was carried out in
connection with reservoir construction. In 1948 Robert L. Stephenson published
the results of his work at the proposed McGee Bend Reservoir in Angelina,
Jasper, Nacogdoches, Sabine, and San Augustine counties (Stephenson 1948a,
1948b).
At the time this was the only systematic professional major
archaeological investigation in the county.

In the 1970s, Ross Fields (1979) presented an overview of the cultural
resources of the Davy Crockett, Sam Houston, Angelina, and Sabine National
Forests of Texas. This document provides a brief discussion of all sites in each
forest, and 23 sites in Angelina County are mentioned. Another important
document for this area is a cultural resource overview of the National Forests in
Texas by John Ippolito (1983). Of particular relevance to this project is Ippolito's
Figure 21 entitled "Drainage Systems & Probability Zones, Angelina National
Forest, Texas."
Although no part of the project area is within the Angelina National Forest,
Ippolito's figure covers areas within 10 miles of the City of Lufkin. He considers
the Neches and Angelina rivers to be high probability areas with several streams
in the county listed as medium probability areas. According to Ippolito (personal
communication), there are several drainages in the county such as Hurricane
Creek and Biloxi Creek that should be considered to be medium to high
probability areas. Ephemeral streams such as those in the current project area
are viewed by Ippolito as low probability areas.
A check of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas revealed one previous
survey in the vicinity of the current project area. This small area survey was
performed for the United States Department of Agriculture, Rural Development.
There is no information on the Atlas that documents the size of the project area,
name of investigating firm, or date of survey. This area is approximately 452
meters southwest of the current project area.
It is beyond the scope of this report to discuss in detail the archaeological
background of Angelina County, especially when numerous contract reports are
available. The interested reader is referred to the statistical overview (Biesaart et
al. 1985), the planning document published by the THC (Kenmotsu and Perttula
1993), and other reports cited above for more detailed information regarding the
archaeology of Angelina County.

METHODS
This investigation was performed on March 21 and 22, 2007. Shovel tests
were excavated randomly across the project area (Figure 6). All excavated earth
was screened using Â¼ inch hardware cloth and recorded on a shovel test log
(Appendix I). Eighteen shovel tests were excavated in the 12-acre project area,
and six shovel tests were excavated along the 1000 foot water line. All tests
were terminated when clay was encountered. The tests ranged in depth from 10
to 100 cm with the majority of tests (n=17) reaching clay at 40 cm or less. The
18 shovel tests in the 12-acre tract exceeds the number of shovel test per acre
as required by the Archeological Survey Standards for Texas as recommended
by the Texas Historical Commission, and the six shovel tests along the 100 foot
water line also exceeds the standards for linear surveys. The project was also
documented by digital photography and use of a hand held GPS.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The records check at TARL revealed that no previously recorded sites are
present within any portion of the project area as currently defined. A review of
the literature revealed that significant prehistoric and historic sites are present in
Angelina County. Twenty-four shovel tests in the project area revealed a
variable depth of clay between 10 and 100 cm below the existing ground surface
with the majority of tests (n=17) reaching clay at 40 cm or less. Two tests (10
and 20) encountered clay at 50 cm, and one test (9) encountered clay at 60 cm.
The only area where deeper sandy soils were encountered was at the
southwestern portion of the plant site and along the 1000-foot water line. Here,
sandy soils extended to 80 cm in two shovel tests (19 and 21) and 100 cm in two
shovel tests (22 and 23). As stated above (see Environmental Setting), the
entire project area is located in sandy soils. This was not the case in the field as
shallow clays were encountered over most of the area examined. It is possible
that the soil survey is incorrect for this area or the thin sandy mantle has eroded.
Soil erosion is mentioned in the soil survey as a major hazard for this soil type.
Although the project area is on a landform overlooking a tributary of the Angelina
River, it appears that this area was not considered a suitable location for
prehistoric occupation. This tributary may not have been a dependable source of
water in the past, and other areas along this stream may have been selected
instead.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the absence of archaeological sites in the project area, it is
recommended that construction be allowed to proceed as planned. It is always
possible that archaeological sites are missed during any archaeological survey.
Should evidence of a prehistoric or historic site in the project area be discovered
during construction, all work in this area should cease immediately until the
Texas Historical Commission can evaluate the situation.
