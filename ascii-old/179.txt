ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey for the Bryan Towne Centre, Brazos Center
Pond Project, was performed by Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) on
May 22-25, 2007 under antiquities permit 4533. The project area consists of 10
acres and is located adjacent to Carters Creek in central Brazos County. The
field survey examined the subsurface through shovel testing and probing and
backhoe trenching. The surface was examined for evidence of historic sites and
prehistoric artifacts in areas where the ground was disturbed. The entire project
area is located in a floodplain setting consisting of sandy loam overlying firm clay
between 30 cm and 80 cm below the existing ground surface, clay loam over clay
between 20 cm and 30 cm, and clay at the surface. No archaeological sites were
found; however, a historic iron bridge was present, having been brought to the
project area in 1985 from its original location across Carters Creek. The bridge
has been identified by the Texas Historical Commission (THC) as a unique
example of a Warren pony truss bridge that was constructed in 1914. It is a
single lane bridge that is eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic
Places. This historic bridge will not be affected by the construction of the pond or
associated trail. No artifacts were collected.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Bryan proposes to develop 5 acres within a 10-acre tract of land
in central Brazos County (Figure 1). Currently, this area is wooded and serves as a
nature trail for the enjoyment of visitors to the Brazos Center. The unpaved trail
passes marked trees and traverses a low area containing wetlands. It is located
immediately behind the Brazos Center parking lot and stops just before it
encroaches on Carters Creek to the east. The project area is depicted on the
USGS 7.5â Bryan East topographic quadrangle (Figure 2). This topographic map
was created in 1962 and photo revised in 1980. Construction plans consist of
clearing, removing earth for a nearby construction project, and creating a pond in
the area left vacant by earth removal. In addition, a trail parallel to the pond will be
constructed. The Warren pony truss bridge constructed in 1914 will be left in place
and incorporated into the pedestrian walkways for recreational use of the pond.
Brazos County contains significant archaeological sites, both prehistoric and
historic. Recognizing the potential for the presence of significant prehistoric sites in
the area, the City of Bryan requested that a cultural resources survey be conducted
prior to development of this tract. In order to fulfill this requirement, CSC
Engineering & Environmental Consultants, Inc. retained BVRA to conduct an
archaeological survey, which was performed under Texas Antiquities Permit 4384.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area is located within the West Gulf Coastal Plain section of the
Coastal Plain physiographic province as defined by Fenneman (1938:100-120).
Fenneman subdivides this province according to the age of the geological
formations (Gulf series) that roughly parallel the Texas coastline. The area is hilly
and situated within the East Texas timber belt. Gould (1969) describes it as an
area characterized by gently rolling to hilly topography with light colored soils that
are acid sandy loams or sands. The climate is sub-humid to humid, and the
weather is considered to be predominately warm. Annual rainfall for Brazos County
is 39.21 inches. A January minimum average temperature of 42 degrees
Fahrenheit and a July maximum average temperature of 95 degrees Fahrenheit
combine to produce a growing season of 274 days (Kingston and Harris 1985:180).
The altitude varies from 200-400 feet.
The project area is located on a tract of land that parallels Carters Creek.
The elevation across the 10-acre tract is 272 feet. At the time of this survey, the
majority of the area surveyed consisted of a thickly wooded area with frequently
flooded bottomlands occupying a major portion. A small section has been cleared
and contains grass that is mowed regularly.
The vast majority of soils in the project area consist of Sandow Loam,
frequently flooded (Sa) as defined and described in the Brazos County soil survey
(Chervenka 2003). The project area is depicted on Sheet 27 of the soil survey.
According to Chervenka (2003:75), this nearly level soil is found on flood plains
along streams. The native vegetation associated with Sa soils consists of
hardwood forests of hickory, elm, ash, pecan, and oak with an understory of mid
and tall grasses. Sa soils are deep and moderately well drained. Runoff is slow,
permeability is moderately slow, and available water capacity is high. Depth to the
water table is 3.6 feet to 6 feet (perched). A typical profile is described by
Chervenka as follows:
Surface layer: 0-6 inches â grayish-brown, slightly acid loam
Subsurface layer: 6-15 inches â grayish-brown, slightly acid loam
Subsoil: 15-80 inches â moderately acid and slightly acid loams

METHODS OF INVESTIGATION
Background Research
The field survey was supplemented by an examination of site records and
other documents and reports at TARL and in the BVRA library. The records at
TARL and the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas were checked for a listing of known
sites and surveys in the project area and vicinity. Relevant archaeological reports
documenting work in Brazos County were reviewed in order to become familiar with
the kinds of prehistoric and historic sites known to be present in the area. BVRA
was awarded antiquities permit 4533 which allowed work to be performed on
property owned by the City of Bryan.
Field Survey
Edward P. Baxter (Project Archaeologist) performed the field survey. A
100% Pedestrian Survey following rigid transects was not possible due to thick
woods and other forms of vegetation. The area was examined by shovel testing
and a backhoe. Eighteen shovel tests were excavated randomly across the project
area, and two backhoe trenches were dug in those areas where it was possible to
use a backhoe without cutting trees and clearing vegetation. Most of the shovel
tests and one of the backhoe trenches were placed within the footprint of the
proposed pond. At the time of this survey, frequent rains had saturated the project
area making it especially difficult to use the backhoe in low-lying areas. In some
areas shovel tests were terminated at shallow depths due to the presence of firm
clay or standing water. All areas where the ground surface was visible were
checked for exposed cultural materials. Each shovel test was approximately 30 cm
x 30 cm in size. All excavated earth was screened through quarter-inch hardware
cloth. Data obtained from shovel tests were recorded on a shovel test log
(Appendix I), and the approximate location of each test was plotted on a version of
the topographic quadrangle Bryan East (Figure 5). All shovel tests were backfilled
after evaluation and mapping. The two backhoe trenches were dug to a depth of 7
feet and were 2 feet wide and 30 feet long. Profiles of the trenches were drawn in
the field (Appendix II). The project was documented with field notes, a shovel test
log, and digital photography. In-depth research was conducted to learn as much as
possible about the historic bridge that is present within the greater project area.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
A check of the records at TARL revealed that significant sites have been
recorded in the region. The project area has not been examined by a professional
archaeologist, but several relevant cultural resources investigations have been
performed in the vicinity. Examples of work performed in central Brazos County
include investigations by BVRA (Moore 2001, 2004; Moore and Baxter 2005, 2007)
and Archaeology Consultants, Inc. (Moore and Warren 1993).
In 1993, Archaeology Consultants, Inc. conducted an archaeological survey
of the proposed Bush Presidential Library Center (Moore and Warren 1993). This
study investigated 203 acres and recorded two prehistoric sites (41BZ124 and
41BZ125). Site 41BZ124 was found to be a possible single component site with
only a few flakes recovered. Historic artifacts dating to the 20th century were found
mixed with the prehistoric materials. Site 41BZ125 was found to have been
destroyed by construction of George Bush Drive. It yielded only a few flakes, one
biface, and one dart point that dates to the Archaic period. The biface and dart
point were found on the surface within the highway right-of-way. Virtually all of the
shovel tests in the site area were negative. Additional work was not recommended
at either site. This project was to the south and east of the current project area
along White Creek.
The largest archaeological survey in the area was a 945-acre tract that was
examined by BVRA prior to construction of the Traditions Golf and Country Club by
the City of Bryan (Moore 2001). This facility has been constructed and is adjacent
to the current project area just across a tributary of Turkey Creek to the north. This
study found one prehistoric site with a historic component (41BZ131) and three
sites containing only prehistoric components (41BZ132 â 41BZ134). All of the
prehistoric sites were found to be located on landforms containing sandy soils
adjacent to streams. Based on artifacts observed in a private collection and those
recovered during subsurface testing, the area had been occupied from sometime
during the Paleo-Indian period through the Late Prehistoric periods of Texas
prehistory. Paleo-Indian artifacts include Plainview, Angostura, and an Early
Stemmed type from 41BZ131. Archaic artifacts include Morrill, Pedernales,
Godley, and Gary from 41BZ131 and Carrollton from 41BZ132. The 0nly evidence
of Late Prehistoric occupation was the single Scallorn arrow point found at site
41BZ131. The only two identifiable projectile points found by BVRA were the
Carrollton point found during subsurface testing and the Morrill point found on the
surface. At site 41BZ132, a probable intact feature consisting of fire-cracked rock,
burned chert flakes, and the Carrollton dart point was destroyed by the backhoe.
This site is evidence that habitation sites containing features are present in the
area. Two sites were found in the uplands. Site BZ133 was found at an elevation
of 332 feet, and site 41BZ134 was found at an elevation of 270 feet. Neither site
produced diagnostic artifacts or features.

In 2004, BVRA conducted an archaeological survey for the Turkey Creek
Trail project to the north and east of the current project area (Moore 2004). This
study examined approximately 10 acres, and no archaeological sites were found.
In 2004 and 2005, BVRA conducted an archaeological survey for the West
Side Facility sewer project between the confluences of Thompsonâs Creek and
Turkey Creek with the Brazos River. This study examined 61 acres and found one
prehistoric site (41BZ158). This site is located on a sandy hill overlooking
Thompsonâs Creek. Numerous flakes were found during extensive shovel testing
and backhoe trenching. No diagnostic artifacts were recovered, and no features
were observed. Therefore, it was recommended that construction be allowed to
proceed.
In 2007, BVRA examined approximately 358 acres along Turkey Creek
where the Texas A&M Health Sciences Center is to be constructed (Moore and
Baxter 2007). One prehistoric site (41BZ164) was found in the project area. This
site yielded flakes and was found to be very disturbed through clearing activities
prior to this survey. In addition, a previously recorded historic site (41BZ89) was
assessed and found to be virtually destroyed. Site 41BZ89 was the location of a
former homestead that contained frame house, double-pen barn, and log crib at the
time it was recorded and tested by the Texas Department of Transportation
(Archaeological Studies Staff n.d.).
In the 1980s, work was performed along Carters Creek by archaeologists
from Texas A&M University. Shawn Carlson (1983) conducted an investigation at
the Richard Carter site (41BZ74), the earliest known historic occupation in Brazos
County. The Carter family occupied this site from circa 1831 to 1883.
Other projects that have been conducted in Brazos County include the White
Creek Archaeological Project (Thoms 1993b) and the Brazos Valley Slopes
Archaeological Project (Thoms 1993a). The references cited sections of the
reports mentioned above provide information regarding these projects and other
work in Brazos County. It is beyond the scope of this negative report to discuss
these projects in detail.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The current survey examined the entire 10-acre tract and found no
evidence of a prehistoric site. It is believed that this low-lying area was not a
suitable location for prehistoric utilization except possibly on a temporary basis
that would be difficult to find through random shovel testing and backhoe
trenching. At the time of this survey, a nature trail was present in the wooded
area. It was built by the Youth Conservation Corps in 1981.
One historic bridge is present within the project area (Figure 6). The
following description is taken from an article in the Bryan-College Station Eagle
(Nunnelee 1985) and measurements taken on site. This bridge is a good
example of a Warren pony truss bridge that was constructed as a single lane
bridge in 1914 to span Carters Creek on Bird Pond Road south of College
Station. This steel bridge was determined by the THC to be eligible for listing in
the National Register of Historic Places. As a result of this determination, it was
moved to the Brazos Center in 1985 to preserve it after it was no longer
considered a useful bridge. It was originally used to replace a wooden bridge
that had been damaged by a flood that occurred in the winter of 1913 and spring
of 1914. The bridge today is 50 feet long, 13.5 feet wide, and 6 feet tall. It
consists of three sections that were produced as riveted components during their
original construction and bolted together to form the bridge that was used to
cross the creek. According to research conducted by Nunnelee, the bridge
consisted of a 50-foot center truss span with 25-foot approach spans at each
end. Today, only the center span remains. The Warren Truss was patented in
1848 by James Warren and Theobald Manzani. Warren trusses can span
distances of 50 to 400 feet. According to LaVerne Harrington, a deputy State
Historic Preservation Officer, âbridges replaced under the federal replacement
program qualify for preservation if they are at least 50 years old and have some
historical significance. Such bridges can be destroyed only if there is no prudent
or feasible alternative.â She also said that this bridge is âmore gracefulâ and
longer than bridges of similar design.
The project area is located near the original site of the now defunct
community of Boonville, the first county seat of Brazos County. The former town
site and cemetery is located approximately 375 meters to the north (Figure 2).
The town was built around a square with space intended for a courthouse and
was named after Mordecai Boon, a nephew of Daniel Boone. No evidence of
this community was found within the project area. A book by Margaret Lipps van
Bavel (1986) discussing the history of Boonville is present in the Bryan Public
Library and the Brazos Center.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No archaeological sites were found as a result of this survey. The one
historic bridge will not be affected by this project. Therefore, it is recommended
that construction be allowed to proceed as planned. Should evidence of a
prehistoric or historic site be encountered during construction, work should cease
in the area of the find until the situation can be evaluated by the THC. A plaque
next to the bridge is viewed by BVRA as a useful interpretative exhibit for visitors
to the Brazos Center.
