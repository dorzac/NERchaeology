ABSTRACT
Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) conducted an archaeological
survey at the locations of two proposed well sites for the Tom Green County for
the Fresh Water District Number 2 in central Tom Green County on May 11,
2006 under antiquities permit 4131. No evidence of an archaeological site was
found through a surface inspection of the area or during subsurface investigation
with a backhoe, and no artifacts were collected. Copies of the report are on file
at the Texas Historical Commission (THC); Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL); and BVRA.

INTRODUCTION
The Tom Green County Fresh Water District Number 2 in Christoval,
Texas proposes to construct water distribution system improvements to replace
approximately four miles of deteriorated and undersized piping, rehabilitate
existing wells, construct two new wells, and upgrade the existing Water
Treatment Plant to satisfy Texas Commission on Environmental Quality
regulations. The project area is located in the city limits of Christoval, Texas in
central Tom Green County (Figure 1). The project area is depicted on the USGS
7.5’ topographic quadrangle Christoval (Figure 2).
Each proposed well will be located within a 20 x 20 foot square area that
will be scraped to a maximum depth of 12 inches. The diameter of the well
casings will be about 6 to 8 inches, but the actual diameter of the drill hole will be
between 16 and 18 inches. A cement slab will be placed around the casing in an
area of approximately 6 feet in diameter.
Prior to the initiation of the field survey, the Texas Historical Commission,
Archeology Division, reviewed this project. According to a letter from that
agency, the areas recommended for survey are the well locations near the
Concho River “as they have a high probability of containing significant
archeological resources.” The letter also recommended survey of “the portion of
the water lines not placed in existing streets.” Since all water lines will be placed
in existing streets rights-of-way, only the sites of the proposed wells were
determined to be worthy of survey.
If the Tom Green Fresh Water District Number 2 is allowed to proceed
with the construction of the wells and other improvements, Rural Development,
an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture, will provide funding.
Since the well locations are in a city park, an antiquities permit from the THC was
required. Permit 4131 was issued to BVRA for this project.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
General
The following information was taken from the Tom Green County soil
survey (Wiedenfeld and Flores 1976), The Handbook of Texas (Webb 1952), and
the Texas Almanac (Alvarez 2004). Tom Green County is located on the
northern edge of the Edwards Plateau in west-central Texas in an area
consisting of plains and rolling hills broken by the Concho forks. The major
drainage in the county is the Concho River that is formed by the confluence of
the north, middle, and south Concho rivers near the center of the county. These
rivers have cut through the limestone to divide the county into two physiographic
regions. These are the Concho basin, which has productive loams and grazing
lands and the steeper slopes along the edges of the Edwards Plateau which
have not permitted the accumulation of soil and are classified as rough, stony
land.
The county is 1540.5 square miles in size, and San Angelo is the county
seat. When areas under water are subtracted from the size of the county, the
land area is 1522.10 square miles. Altitude varies from 1700 to 2600 feet.
Annual rainfall is 20.5 inches. The January mean minimum temperature is 31
degrees Fahrenheit, while the July mean maximum temperature is 96 degrees
Fahrenheit.
Soils
The entire project area is located within one soil type, Dev and Rio
Concho (Dr) soils. These soils are nearly level to gently sloping soils located in
floodplains of streams that drain limestone areas. A representative profile
consists of gravelly clay loam (0-24”) and brown clay loam (24” to 86”) with
gravels. The depth to bedrock varies in the area between 48” and 100”. This is
a well-drained soil with slow to medium surface runoff. Permeability is
moderately rapid.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
According to a statistical overview published by the THC (Biesaart et al.
1985:76), Tom Green County is located in the Central Texas CulturalGeographical Region of Texas. It is in the Central Texas Archeological Region
as defined by Mercado-Allinger et al. (1996). In 1985, when the overview was
published, the number of archaeological sites in the region was 3507 or 17.34%
of the state. In 1985, there were 116 recorded sites in the county. This
accounted for 3.31% of the region and .57% of the state. No Paleoindian sites
were known in 1985. The vast majority (n=34) sites were described as Archaic,
with 20 sites referred to as General Archaic. The number of Late Prehistoric
sites in 1985 was six. Seven sites had been designated as a State Archeological
Landmark. Site disturbance is common in the area. Biesaart et al. (1985:189)
mention erosion disturbance (109 sites), construction disturbance (41 sites),
disturbed and artificially capped (6 sites), deflated (2 sites), dispersed (15 sites),
and potted and/or surface collected (6 sites). No sites were described as
destroyed. Other forms of disturbance in the county include oil and gas
development, reservoir construction, and agriculture. Sites with subsistence
related features have been recorded with hearths present at 12 sites, burned
rock middens present at 19 sites, burned rock features (not specified) present at
46 sites, midden soil present at 1 site, pits present at 1 site, and stone work
present at 6 sites. Burials were reported at 4 sites and rock art was present at 2
sites. Twenty-five stone quarries and five stone tool manufacturing areas were
recorded in 1985.
No professional archaeological survey has been performed in the project
area. The Concho Valley Archeological Society has recorded sites nearby and
throughout the county. Above the floodplain where the backhoe trenches were
excavated is a ridge that runs parallel to the South Concho River. Along this
ridge are bedrock mortars in limestone boulders. According to local informants,
chipped stone tools and debitage were once common in the area. The Principal
Investigator observed two bedrock mortars and one flake on the ridge. South of
this area, and on the same ridge overlooking the river, is prehistoric site
41TG229. It is difficult to ascertain if this site extends along the ridge above the
project area, especially since there are several gullies that bisect this landform.
The prehistoric component at site 41TG229 contains burned rock middens,
hearths, a lithic scatter, and several bedrock mortars.

In addition, there are two small rock shelters that have not been recorded.
These shelters are at the edge of the river but well outside the project area. The
Principal Investigator visited these sites and found them to be disturbed. At one
shelter, part of the roof has collapsed. At the second shelter, traces of rock art
were observed, but vandals have defaced much of the rear wall. One informant
stated that there is a large spring to the south on a private ranch where
numerous sites have been documented. The location of these sites and areas
surveyed may be found on the maps at TARL and the Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas.
The two areas in the county where archaeological work has been
concentrated are the Twin Buttes Reservoir, and Fort Concho. Most of the
surveys in the area have been small and typically associated with highway
construction projects, transmission lines, pipelines, and water improvement
projects. For more information regarding other work in the area researchers are
advised to consult the site files at TARL and the THC. There are 86 references
to previous work in Tom Green in a bibliography of Central Texas compiled by
Helen Simons and William E. Moore (1997) and published by the Texas
Historical Commission. Thirteen of these references are related to work at Fort
Concho. Other sources for previous work include a published series entitled
Abstracts in Texas Contract Archeology (published by the THC and compiled by
William E. Moore) that documents all works in Texas from 1988 through 1992
and Archeology in the Central and Southern Planning Region, Texas: A Planning
Document (Mercado-Allinger 1996), also published by the Texas Historical
Commission.

METHODS OF INVESTIGATION
Prior to the field survey, the Principal Investigator conducted a review of
previous work in the general area and talked with other archaeologists. The
Texas Historic Sites Atlas was checked for previously recorded sites and areas
surveyed, and a records check by Jean Hughes at TARL was performed.
The project area was examined by a 100% Pedestrian Survey of the three
possible locations for the two well and three backhoe trenches. Each backhoe
trench was excavated in the area where the bore hole for the well will be drilled.
The trenches were terminated when river gravels were encountered. The
trenches were 4 meters long, and the varied in width from 140 to 200 cm and in
depth to the gravel lens varied from 290 to 340 cm. Profiles of the trenches were
sketched in the field and appear as Appendix I to this report. The project was
documented through field notes and digital photography. Figure 3 depicts
Backhoe Trench 2.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Pre-Field
A search of the site records at TARL revealed no previously recorded sites
in the project area. Several archaeological sites have been recorded in the area
(see Archaeological Background above).
Field Survey
At the time of this survey, the three well site locations were in disturbed
areas and covered with grass. The surface of the areas investigated had been
scraped for roads and a now-abandoned football field. The area is now a city
park and contains roads and picnic areas. Beginning in the late 1800s this part
of the river was used by Baptists as a site for revivals and baptisms. Virtually the
entire surface of the park has been disturbed, and collectors have picked up
artifacts for many years.
The surface of the areas investigated with the backhoe revealed a layer of
caliche road material overlying clay loam and clay. The caliche is 20 cm thick in
most places, and the clay loam varies throughout the area investigated. At the
bottom of each trench was a lens of gravels. No features were observed in the
profiles of the backhoe trenches, and no artifacts were found. The current survey
was performed according to the “Minimum Survey Standards for Project Areas of
200 Acres or Less” as defined by the Texas Historical Commission, Archeology
Division.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No archaeological sites were found to be within the three areas
investigated. Therefore, it is recommended that the Tom Green County Fresh
Water District Number 2 be allowed to proceed with construction as planned. If
any prehistoric or historic sites are encountered during construction, all work
must cease until the Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division can
assess the situation. Should construction plans change to include new areas
that will affect undisturbed ground the THC must be notified as a return visit by a
professional archaeologist may be required.
