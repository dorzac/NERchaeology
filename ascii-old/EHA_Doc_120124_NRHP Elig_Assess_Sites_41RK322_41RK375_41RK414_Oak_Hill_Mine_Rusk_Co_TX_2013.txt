Abstract
During March, April, May, and June 2012, Atkins archeologists conducted National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) eligibility testing on three sites (41RK322, 41RK375, and 41RK414) within
Luminant’s Oak Hill Mine in Rusk County, Texas. These sites were located during previous
archeological survey of the mine in 1997. Presently, impacts related to mine development are
anticipated. Site 41RK322 is an ephemeral late-nineteenth- to early-twentieth-century artifact
scatter. Site 41RK375 appears to represent a Middle Caddo residential occupation. Site 41RK414 is
a sprawling, low density lithic artifact scatter, which likely resulted from multiple occupational
episodes during the prehistoric period.
Shovel testing at site 41RK322 showed the landform harboring the site to have been eroded as well
as an absence of significant cultural deposits. Archival research suggests further that the site lacks
associative significance that would qualify it for National Register listing under Criterion A or B.

Site 41RK375 was subjected to intensive shovel testing, a magnetometer survey, mechanical
excavation, and hand excavation. This effort resulted in the recovery of a ceramic assemblage that
indicated a Middle Caddo occupation. The magnetometer survey identified one magnetic anomaly
associated with a small, disarticulated burned rock feature that was exposed in a backhoe trench.
Once the above hand and mechanical excavation was completed, the wide blade on a small rubbertracked trackhoe was used to carefully strip the culturally densest portion of the site. This effort
recovered a large assemblage of ceramic sherds and identified two discrete ceramic artifact
concentrations. No other cultural features were identified. The poor feature preservation on-site,
along with the poor preservation of cultural floral and faunal remains, is thought to be due largely
to the deep sands there that appear to have been subjected to substantial bioturbation. The absence
of intact and interpretable cultural features on-site suggests strongly that significant data
resources, pertinent to understanding the Middle Caddo occupation of the Sabine River drainage,
have not been preserved. For this reason, site 41RK375 does not appear to warrant NRHP inclusion
under Criterion D.

Site 41RK414 was subjected to intensive shovel testing. This effort resulted in the recovery of a
small assemblage of nontemporally diagnostic lithic artifacts, but failed to identify any artifact high
density and diversity areas that could represent an activity area or an occupational episode. A
single mechanically excavated trench was placed adjacent to the most productive shovel test onsite. No cultural features were identified in the trench. These findings suggest that significant intact
deposits relevant to understanding the prehistoric period in this region have not been preserved
on-site. For this reason, site 41RK414 does not appear to warrant NRHP inclusion under Criterion
D.

INTRODUCTION
During March, April, May, and June 2012, Atkins archeologists conducted National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) eligibility testing on three sites (41RK322, 41RK375, and 41RK414) within
Luminant’s Oak Hill Mine in Rusk County, Texas (Figure 1). These sites were located during
previous archeological survey of the mine (Skokan et al. 1997). Presently, impacts related to mine
development are anticipated. Site 41RK322 is an ephemeral late-nineteenth- to early-twentiethcentury artifact scatter. Site 41RK375 appears to represent a Middle Caddo residential occupation.
Site 41RK414 is a sprawling, low density lithic artifact scatter, which likely resulted from multiple
occupational episodes during the prehistoric period.
David Sherman served as Principal Investigator, field supervisor, and senior author. Russ Shortes
served as Project Archeologist. The field crew included Sabrina Arno, Karissa Basse, Haley Rush,
and Becca Sager. The archival research and analysis were conducted by Brandy Harris. Linda Ellis
conducted the ceramic analysis and Michael Nash analyzed the lithic artifacts and the faunal
remains. Laboratory analysis and processing was conducted under the direction of Candace
Wallace. Leslie Bush conducted the macrobotanical analysis, and Beta Analytic performed the
radiocarbon analysis.
Shovel testing at site 41RK322 showed the landform harboring the site to have been eroded as well
as an absence of significant cultural deposits. Archival research suggests further that the site lacks
associative significance that would qualify it for National Register listing under Criterion A or B.

Site 41RK375 was subjected to intensive shovel testing, a magnetometer survey, mechanical
excavation, and hand excavation. This effort resulted in the recovery of a ceramic assemblage that
indicated a Middle Caddo occupation. The magnetometer survey identified one magnetic anomaly
associated with a small, disarticulated, burned rock feature that was exposed in a backhoe trench.
Once the above hand and mechanical excavation was completed, the wide blade on a small rubbertracked trackhoe was used to carefully strip the culturally densest portion of the site. This effort
recovered a large assemblage of ceramic sherds and identified two discrete ceramic artifact
concentrations. No other cultural features were identified. The poor feature preservation on-site,
along with the poor preservation of cultural floral and faunal remains, is thought to be due largely
to the deep sands there that appear to have been subjected to substantial bioturbation. The absence
of intact and interpretable cultural features on-site suggests strongly that significant data
resources, pertinent to understanding the Middle Caddo occupation of the Sabine River drainage,

Sites 41RK322, 41RK375, and 41RK414
have not been preserved. For this reason, site 41RK375 does not appear to warrant NRHP inclusion
under Criterion D.
Site 41RK414 was subjected to intensive shovel testing. This effort resulted in the recovery of a
small assemblage of nontemporally diagnostic lithic artifacts, but failed to identify any artifact high
density and diversity areas that could represent an activity area or an occupational episode. A
single mechanically excavated trench was placed adjacent to the most productive shovel test on‐
site. No cultural features were identified in the trench. These findings suggest that significant intact
deposits relevant to understanding the prehistoric period in this region have not been preserved
on‐site. For this reason, site 41RK414 does not appear to warrant NRHP inclusion under Criterion
D. The THC has concurred with all of the above recommendations (Martin 2013).
These investigations were performed in compliance with the Protection of Historic Properties
regulations (36 CFR 800), which govern the Section 106 review process as established by the
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (PL 89‐665), as amended in 1974, 1976, 1980, and 1992;
the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL 91‐190, 83 Stat. 915, 42 USC 4231, 1970); the
Office of Surface Mining Regulations, as superseded by the Coal Mining Regulations of the Texas
Railroad Commission, 1981, as updated in 1989; other appropriate cultural resources legislation;
and the guidelines set forth by the Council of Texas Archeologists and the Register of Professional
Archaeologists.

NATURAL SETTING
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Topography
Both sites 41RK322 and 41RK414 are located on prominent ridge summits that do not appear to
have aggraded since site abandonment. Site 41RK375 is located on a toeslope that rises slightly
above the floodplain of Tiawichi Creek. Although it is conceivable that site 41RK375 aggraded as a
result of alluvial deposition since its prehistoric abandonment, the fact that the majority of the
prehistoric materials recovered on-site came from just below the current ground surface suggests
rather strongly that any aggradation would have been minimal.

Climate

The tested sites are located in eastern Rusk County near its border with Panola County. Presently,
this region is characterized by a humid subtropical climate, averaging 243 frost-free days per year,
typically extending from March 17 to November 15. Temperatures average 8 degrees Celsius (°C) in
winter, 16 °C in spring, 25 °C in summer, and 17 °C in autumn. The average annual rainfall for the
area is approximately 116.8 centimeters (cm), ranging from a low of 59.7 cm to a high of 172.2 cm.
Summer is typically the driest season of the year, and spring is usually the wettest; monthly rainfall
averages range from a low of 7 cm in August to a high of 12.2 cm in May (Dolezel 1975; Griffith
2000).

Physiography and Geology

The investigated sites are located in the West Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic province (Fenneman
1938). The surface topography of the region is characterized by gently rolling hills dissected by
dendritic drainage systems.
Structurally, the area is situated on the extreme western flank of the Sabine Uplift, a major domal
structure affecting northeast Texas and northwest Louisiana. The axis of the East Texas
Embayment, a northeast-southwest-trending synclinal structure, passes about 80 kilometers (km)
northwest of the Oak Hill Mine. Both of these features have influenced the unconsolidated
sedimentary strata that underlie this region by altering the gentle dip toward the Gulf of Mexico
that is found across most of the region.

Sites 41RK322, 41RK375, and 41RK414
The dominant geologic unit in this part of Texas is the Eocene-aged Wilcox Group, which is
composed of sediments deposited by ancient river systems (Kaiser et al. 1978). These sediments
and others of lesser geologic groups are lithologically composed of varying proportions of siliceous
clay, silt, sand, gravel, and lignite. According to Fisher and McGowen (1967), Wilcox sediments were
deposited as part of a fluvial depositional environment called the Mt. Pleasant Fluvial System. In
early Eocene times, large streams meandered over a relatively flat coastal plain that is now
northeast Texas. As these streams migrated and changed their course of flow, they deposited finegrained silts and clays in large areas between different stream channels. These interchannel areas
were lowland swamps and marshes that supported abundant vegetation. Over time, this vegetation
formed several large peat deposits that eventually became the lignites that are found in the Wilcox
Group today.

The high sand content of the Wilcox Group and other lesser geologic formations (Carrizo and
Reklaw) is responsible for shaping the character of the depositional environment of the local
cultural resources. The soils are generally friable and easily disrupted by surface disturbances,
either natural or man-made.

Flora

The sites are located in what Gould (1975) refers to as the Pineywoods vegetational region and
within the western portion of the Austroriparian biotic province as described and delineated by
Dice (1943) and Blair (1950). Blair (1950) notes that the Austroriparian province in Texas is
similar in terms of fauna and vegetation to the rest of the province, which extends eastward to the
Atlantic coast. Extensive forests of pines and hardwoods, along with scattered swamps, marshes,
and other hydric habitats, are characteristic of the Austroriparian province.

The most common upland tree species in the Pineywoods are loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), shortleaf
pine (P. echinata), post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Q. marilandica), southern red oak (Q.
falcata), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and hickories (Carya ovata, C. tomentosa, and C.
cordiformis). Common lowland trees are water oak (Q. nigra), willow oak (Q. phellos), Shumard oak
(Q. shumardii), sugar hackberry (Celtis laevigata), overcup oak (Q. lyrata), and elms (Ulmus
americana, U. rubra, and U. crassifolia) (Braun 1950; Tharp 1926).

Herbs, shrubs, and grasses abound in the Pineywoods, many of which provide forage for native and
domesticated animals. These are predominantly species of Andropogon, Sporobolus, Panicum,
Paspalum, Muhlenbergia, Eragrostis, Chasmanthium, indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), native
legumes, and occasional shrubs. Many other grasses as well as a large variety of forbs are
represented to form an extremely complex association of herbs and brush species. Common
invader species include broomsedge bluestem (Andropogon virginicus), smutgrass (Sporobolus
indicus), yankeeweed (Eupatorium compositifolum), red lovegrass (Eragrostis oxylepis), greenbriar
(Smilax sp.), and yaupon (Ilex vomitoria) (Thomas 1975).

2. Natural Setting

Upland Pine/Hardwood Forests
Both sites 41RK322 and 41RK414 are located in upland settings with mixed hardwood pine forests
and pasture. The structure of the upland pine/hardwood forests found within the region is variable,
depending largely on successional status resulting from historic farming and logging. Dominant
overstory species in the Oak Hill Mine include recently planted stands of loblolly pine or shortleaf
pine, and older stands of southern red oak, post oak, black hickory (C. texana), sweetgum, and
eastern hophornbeam (Ostrya virginiana) on steeper slopes. The more mesic stands have an
overstory dominated by black tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica), sweetgum, white oak (Q. alba), eastern
hophornbeam, and red mulberry (Morus rubra). The understory and shrub layers of upland stands
are usually quite dense. Dominant species in the understory include winged elm (U. alata), eastern
redcedar (Juniperus virginiana), flowering dogwood (Cornus florida), sweetgum, Carolina buckthorn
(Rhamnus caroliniana), red maple (Acer rubrum), American holly (Ilex opaca), black tupelo, eastern
redbud (Cercis canadensis), eastern hophornbeam, and American hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana).
Common shrubs include saplings of eastern redcedar, flowering dogwood, black tupelo, American
holly, sweetgum, and various oaks, along with American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana),
farkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum), southern wax myrtle (Myrica cerifera), and common sassafras
(Sassafras albidum). The herbaceous stratum is dense and composed of various seedlings, grasses,
and other herbs.

Floodplain Communities

Site 41RK375 is located within the floodplain of Tiawichi Creek. This creek harbors floodplain
communities that include bottomland hardwood forests and narrow pastures that may be
seasonally inundated. Bottomland hardwood forests in the mine occur on floodplains associated
with permanent and intermittent creeks or streams. Important overstory species include
sweetgum, river birch (Betula nigra), red maple, Florida maple (A. barbatum), black tupelo, and
American hornbeam. Water oak, willow oak, and loblolly pine occur less commonly. Common
buttonbush (Cephalanthus occidentalis) is a common understory species, while seedlings of various
overstory species in association with various sedges and other herbs comprise a usually sparse
ground cover.

Fauna

The vertebrate fauna of northeast Texas is generally typical of that occurring over most of the rest
of the Austroriparian province, with the majority of the wildlife species being associated with either
forested or aquatic habitats. Principal wildlife species within the region generally coincide in
distribution with the principal vegetation communities, i.e., upland forests, bottomland forests, and
aquatic areas.

The vertebrate fauna of northeast Texas is diverse, and there are numerous species that are
common to this part of Texas and may have been important to the historic and prehistoric

Atkins 100027188/120124

Sites 41RK322, 41RK375, and 41RK414
inhabitants. Important mammals include the fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), raccoon (Procyon lotor),
Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), beaver (Castor
canadensis), muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), mink (Mustela vison), and cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus
floridanus) (Schmidly 1983). Black bear (Ursus americanus) may also have been present in
northeast Texas prior to the latter part of the nineteenth century (House 1978). At least 49 species
of mammals are known to have inhabited the Austroriparian biotic province in Texas in recent
times (Blair 1950). In addition, at least 29 snake species, 10 lizard species, 2 land turtle species, and
25 amphibian species are known from the area (Blair 1950) and may also have been exploited
(Butzer 1971:149). A large number of fish and macroinvertebrate species may have been of
particular value to aboriginal inhabitants due to the relative ease in exploiting the resource. Major
fish taxa include minnows, sunfish, topminnows, darters, and pirate perch, and principal
macroinvertebrates of the area include terrestrial and freshwater pelecypods and gastropods.

PREHISTORIC FOOD SOURCES

Ethnohistoric accounts of Caddo subsistence practices and organic remains recovered from
prehistoric archeological sites afford a view of the large array of plant foods that were exploited,
both wild and cultivated (Crane 1982; Perttula and Bruseth 1983; Swanton 1942). Among the latter
plants were corn, beans, sunflowers, and pumpkins. The vast array of wild plants eaten included
nuts, such as hickory (Carya spp.), pecan (Carya illinoinensis), chinkapin (Castanea pumila), acorns
(Quercus spp.), and black walnut (Juglans nigra); plums (Prunus spp.); persimmons (Diospyros spp.);
grapes (Vitus spp.); strawberries (Frageria virginiana); edible roots; and a variety of herbs and
seeds from annuals, such as knotweed (Polygonum sp.), goosefoot (Chenopodium sp.), marshelder
(Iva sp.), and wild lettuce (Lactuca sp.).

A wide variety of animal species were also exploited. Ethnohistoric data derived from early contacts
with the Caddo (Crane 1982; Perttula and Bruseth 1983; Swanton 1942) indicate that these
resources included white-tailed deer, black bear, cottontail rabbit, opossum, squirrel, raccoon, dog
(Canis familiaris), various species of ducks and geese (Anatidae), turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), quail
(Colinus virginianus), and prairie chicken (Tympanuchus cupido).

Bison (Bos bison) may have existed in very limited numbers in east Texas during prehistoric times,
as their remains have been encountered at a number of archeological sites in adjacent areas
(Neuman 1984). Early historic accounts, however, indicate bison were not found in the forests of
east Texas, but were hunted in the plains to the west. In 1691, Casañas located the herds about 4
days’ travel from the Nabedache village, and Hasinai hunting parties established a well-defined path
between the Brazos and the Trinity Rivers in their forays to and from the bison range (Casañas de
Jesús María 1927; Griffith 1954:113).
In addition to mammals, fish, such as gar (Lepisosteus sp.), bowfin (Amia calva), pickerel (Esox sp.),
catfish (Ictaluridae), and bass (Centrarchidae), as well as reptiles and amphibians, including
Atkins 100027188/120124

2. Natural Setting
snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina), lizards (Igaunidae), snakes (Colubridae), and frogs (Rana
spp.), were also exploited by the Caddo inhabitants of the region (Perttula and Bruseth 1983;
Swanton 1942).

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS – NORTHEAST TEXAS AND ADJACENT AREAS
Archeological investigations in the eastern United States originally focused on the religious myths
surrounding mound sites and a desire to obtain high-status funerary objects often contained within
them. The Mississippi and Ohio river valleys were the scenes of much of this early activity (Atwater
1820; Squier and Davis 1848). Northeast Texas remained at the periphery of this activity until the
first decades of the twentieth century. Spurred by exploration of archeological sites by steamboat
along the Red River in Louisiana (Moore 1912), J.E. Pearce, in 1919 and 1920, set out to record sites
in Cherokee, Harrison, Henderson, Hopkins, and Hunt counties (Barnard 1939). Working for the
University of Texas, Pearce laid the groundwork for studies that were to follow.
From 1927 to 1936, Pearce arranged for additional archeological work in Texas, much of which
centered in east Texas. In Titus County in the early 1930s, at least eight sites were investigated
(Thurmond 1990), including the Hale Mound (41TT12) and the Keith Mound (41TT11)
(Goldschmidt 1934; Jackson 1934a). In Panola County, a review of the survey notes of A.T. Jackson
for 1934 identified three sites that were later given Smithsonian trinomial numbers 41PN1, 41PN5,
and 41PN15 (Jackson 1934b). Jackson (1935) reported on at least three sites in Rusk County,
41RK1, 41RK2, and 41RK6, the last of which was reportedly tested. Site 41RK4 was reported in the
early 1930s by Jackson and Woosley (Woosley 1939).

In 1935, Goldschmidt prepared a synthesis of archeological sites in Titus County and their
relationship to sites in east Texas. Although basically a trait list comparison, a cultural chronology
was established for the area. The importance of this early work is that it was one of the first
attempts at defining a chronological framework. For Rusk County, the 1939 and 1940 files of the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) at The University of Texas at Austin list 26 sites in
a catalogue of east Texas sites (Hughes 1948). No site descriptions were given, and no precise
locations were documented for the sites. These early works would later serve as a basis for the
regional syntheses of Krieger (1946) and Suhm et al. (1954).

Beginning with the establishment of the Interagency Archeological Salvage Program in 1946, and
the initiation of the River Basin Surveys Program in the late 1940s, numerous investigations were
conducted in the following decades in northeast Texas (Anderson 1972; Davis 1958; Davis and
Davis 1960; Hsu 1969; Sullivan 1977). Scurlock and Davis’s (1962) survey of the then-proposed
Toledo Bend Reservoir located 160 sites. Of this total, seven sites were documented for Panola

Sites 41RK322, 41RK375, and 41RK414
County: 41PN6–41PN12. One site (41PN6) was designated as possibly Paleoindian, one site
(41PN9) was identified as Archaic, and two sites (41PN8 and 41PN12) were identified as possibly
Caddo. The chronological positions of the remaining Panola County sites were not determined. In
1969, a single site (41PN13) was located by Tom Deppe in southwestern Panola County along
Murvaul Bayou, now under Lake Murvaul. In 1968, a reconnaissance survey of the then-proposed
Ponta Reservoir, located on the Angelina River in Cherokee, Nacogdoches, and Rusk counties, was
conducted by archeologists from Southern Methodist University (Skinner 1971). Ten prehistoric
sites, including three from Rusk County, were recorded. The majority of archeological
investigations conducted in the region have been accomplished in association with mining
activities.

Martin Lake Reservoir

When large areas were to be impacted by the development of a power plant and associated lignite
mine, archeologists from the Texas Archeological Survey (TAS) conducted an archeological survey
of the Martin Lake area of Rusk and Panola counties (McDonald 1972). Forty-one sites were
recorded, most of which were in Rusk County. Twenty of the recorded sites were recommended by
TAS personnel for testing. Following that survey, TAS archeologists conducted formal testing on 5
of the 20 sites: 41RK19 (listed in the NRHP), 41RK21, 41RK32, 41RK36, and 41RK39 (Clark and
Ivey 1974). Site 41RK39 was determined to be a multicomponent site with Late Caddo and Late
Archaic components (Clark and Ivey 1974:84). A Late Caddo occupation was also documented for
sites 41RK19, 41RK21, and 41RK32. For site 41RK36, a single-component contact-period
occupation was identified containing European trade goods, dated from post–A.D. 1600 (Clark and
Ivey 1974:70). Two sites (41RK24 and 41RK30) investigated during this survey lie within the
Martin Lake Mine Area AIV boundary. Both of these sites were reassessed during a survey of the
AIV area (Sherman et al. 2005; see below)

Martin Lake Mine (Areas A, B, and C)

Since 1982, Atkins has conducted numerous cultural resource surveys in Panola County.
Wooldridge (1982) located a single prehistoric site and one historic site within the corridor of a
proposed pipeline. In late 1982, Atkins archeologists conducted a sample survey for cultural
resources over about 19 percent of all undisturbed areas within the permit boundary of the Martin
Lake Mine, Areas A, B, and C (Glander and Brandimarte 1983). Located less than 14 km northeast of
the Oak Hill permit area, 29 sites (17 historic and 12 prehistoric) were recorded within the mine
permit boundary. Virtually all prehistoric sites were found to be located in the near vicinity of
water courses, about 305 meters (m) or less from established creek or river banks. Historic sites
tended to follow a similar pattern, but were also found to be located adjacent to the modern road
network. Two sites, 41PN14 and 41PN25, were recommended for limited archeological testing.

Atkins 100027188/120124

3. Cultural Background
A second survey of the Martin Lake Mine (Glander and Victor 1984) was conducted in accordance
with recommendations by Atkins personnel (Glander and Brandimarte 1983) for additional
investigation of undisturbed lands hypothesized to have a high probability for site occurrence.
Covering about 3,526 acres, 17 sites and isolated finds were recorded (41PN46–41PN52, 41PN54–
41PN63), 6 of which were historic. During the course of this survey (Glander and Victor 1984),
limited archeological testing was also conducted on sites 41PN14 and 41PN25. The former site was
found to represent possibly Early and Late Caddo occupations, and the latter a Late Caddo
occupation. Avoidance of sites 41PN14 and 41PN48 (from which suspected prehistoric burial goods
were recovered) was recommended, along with a recommendation for limited archeological testing
of site 41PN57.
A third survey by Atkins cultural resource personnel was conducted in October 1984 in a boundary
revision for the C-II permit area (Glander 1984a). Covering about 551 acres, only three historic
sites were recorded (41PN64–41PN66).

The fourth effort conducted by Atkins archeologists in the Martin Lake Mine concerned
archeological testing of site 41PN57, which was recommended for testing by Glander and Victor
(1984). The site was shown to represent a Caddo occupation that was heavily disturbed and
maintained no site integrity (Glander 1984b).

The fifth large effort conducted by archeologists from Atkins was a survey of all undisturbed and
unsurveyed areas in Martin Lake Mine, Areas A, B, and C. The investigation covered about 12,849
acres and resulted in the location of 30 new sites and 2 isolated finds (Glander, Victor et al. 1986).
As an adjunct to the survey effort, archeological testing was also conducted on historic site 41PN42,
and historical and archival research was conducted on sites 41PN29 and 41PN26. Ethnohistoric
research was also conducted on the communities of Sugar Hill, Harris Chapel, and Center Point, and
on historic cemetery sites 41PN18, 41PN30, and 41PN95.

Testing investigations demonstrated site 41PN42 to have resulted from occupation during the late
nineteenth century to the late twentieth century, first as a residence, then as a barn. Sites 41PN29
and 41PN26 were shown to date from the early twentieth century and the late nineteenth century,
respectively, and the communities of Sugar Hill, Harris Chapel, and Center Point were shown to
represent dispersed farming communities linked through familial ties. The historic cemetery
research revealed a wide variety of cemetery styles reflecting different approaches to the interment
of the deceased.
Other investigations in the Martin Lake Mine concerned sites 41PN26 and 41PN75. Previous
archival and dendrochronological analysis had revealed that site 41PN26 dated from 1872 and
1873 (Glander, Victor et al. 1986). Glander monitored land clearing in 1989 and found no intact
cultural deposits and few nineteenth-century artifacts (Glander 1989). Historic site 41PN75, dating
from the 1870s, was originally recorded in 1985 (Glander, Bearden et al. 1986). Atkins conducted

Atkins 100027188/120124

13

Sites 41RK322, 41RK375, and 41RK414
site excavation to mitigate the loss of the site due to mining (Kotter and Moore 1990). Nearly
10,000 artifacts were recovered and 12 cultural features were recorded. Stratified cultural deposits
were limited to the twentieth century.
In February of 1990, Atkins conducted a survey of a proposed expansion area of the Martin Lake
Mine (Kotter et al. 1992). The area surveyed encompassed 2,339 acres and was designated the B
West study area. A total of 20 sites were located, including 7 previously recorded sites and 13
previously unrecorded sites. The survey area examined was virtually all uplands, where previous
investigations of similar environments had established an expected yield of low density/probability
for prehistoric sites (Moncure and Jackson 1980). As anticipated, of the 13 newly recorded sites,
only 2 were prehistoric.

The Texas Historical Commission (THC) reiterated that 1 site, 41PN14, was NRHP-eligible, stated
that 15 sites were not eligible, and indicated that 4 sites warranted further investigation to
determine eligibility (Bruseth 1991; Bruseth and Perttula 1992). This resulted in the National
Register testing program of the four historic sites by Atkins in December of 1992 at the B West
Mine area (Nash et al. 1994). The sites tested include 41PN2/115, 41PN99, 41PN102, and
41PN104. The dual site number reflects a misplotting of site 41PN2 at TARL and the corrected site
number for the tested site. None of the sites tested for the National Register were deemed eligible
for listing in the NRHP, and no further investigations were recommended.
In 1996 Atkins conducted a cultural resources survey of two areas within the Martin Lake Mine
(AIV and BIII), totaling 2,378 acres (Taylor and Tate 1997). That survey located 46 sites, consisting
of 16 historic, 29 prehistoric, and 1 multiple component historic/prehistoric sites. Two of the 29
prehistoric sites recorded in that survey are 41PN131 and 41PN137. These sites were subjected to
NRHP eligibility testing in 2008 and shown to represent multiple prehistoric occupations but
lacked significant preserved deposits (Sherman et al. 2008).

In 2005, Atkins surveyed 2,424 acres within the Martin Lake AIV South Mine (Sherman et al. 2005)
and located 23 newly recorded historic sites and 1 prehistoric site. Only the prehistoric site
(41PN214) was determined to have an unknown NRHP eligibility status and subjected to NRHP
testing in 2007 (Sherman et al. 2008) and determined to be ineligible for NRHP inclusion. In 2006,
Atkins conducted NRHP eligibility testing of three sites (41PN124, 41RK194, and 41RK455) within
the Martin Lake Mine (Dixon et al. 2007) and demonstrated that none possessed significant data
resources that warranted NRHP inclusion.

Oak Hill (Martin Lake Mine, Area D)

It was during the 1930s and 1940s that cultural resources in Rusk County and the Oak Hill Mine
were first examined (Hughes 1948; Jackson 1935). It was not until the 1970s, however, that moresystematic investigations were conducted, mostly in response to reservoir development (Clark and
Ivey 1974; McDonald 1972; Skinner 1971).
Atkins 100027188/120124

3. Cultural Background
Several previous investigations within the Oak Hill mine (Glander et al. 1987; Heartfield, Price, and
Greene [HPG] 1984; Jackson 1982, 1983; Moncure and Jackson 1980, 1982) located a combined
total of 43 archeological sites (41RK87, 41RK106, 41RK109–41RK128, 41RK143–41RK161,
41RK193, and 41RK194).

The 1980 TAS document (Moncure and Jackson 1980) was the first of the four previously
referenced cultural resource investigations within the Oak Hill Mine, and reported on a
reconnaissance survey conducted for Texas Utilities Mining Company (TUMCO, now Luminant)
over two separate lignite tracts in Rusk County. The southern tract (Deposit 362) covered about
21,004 acres and was located south of Henderson, Texas. The northern tract (Deposit 363) covered
about 37,066 acres. It was the Mill Creek area’s eastern drainage that received the most attention
during the reconnaissance survey of Deposit 363 (Moncure and Jackson 1980:1).
Only four prehistoric sites were recorded: one (41RK65) from Deposit 362, and three (41RK82,
41RK83, and P-1) from Deposit 363 (Moncure and Jackson 1980:25–26). Site 41RK65 was
described as a scatter of ceramics, lithic tools, and raw material that had been heavily impacted and
possibly destroyed by highway construction. Ceramics and nondiagnostic lithic artifacts were noted
from sites 41RK82 and 41RK83. Both sites are in the Oak Hill D-III permit area. In addition, site
41RK106 was recorded and recommended for testing (Jackson 1980, 1982).
Within Deposit 362 south of Henderson, two single historic grave locations were identified, but
were not assigned a trinomial site number (Moncure and Jackson 1980:45). Six historic resources,
including previously located 41RK64 and five newly recorded resources, were located in Deposit
363. Three of the five resources were assigned trinomial site numbers 41RK85, 41RK86, and
41RK87, and two were simply assigned field numbers H-4 and H-5 (Moncure and Jackson 1980:27–
40).

Site 41RK64, known as the Taylor Brown Kiln, was originally reported by G. Greer in 1973 as part
of her kiln studies in Texas (site form on file at TARL). In addition to the kiln remains, examination
by TAS archeologists revealed evidence of a grist mill, remains of an antebellum dwelling, and a
cemetery over an approximately 5-acre area. The site appears to date from the 1850s, and
avoidance was recommended (Moncure and Jackson 1980).
Sites 41RK85 and 41RK86 represent the Millville Cemetery and the former community of Millville,
respectively. Both the community and the cemetery were established in the early 1850s. The
Millville Cemetery is still in use. Survey and subsurface testing was recommended for 41RK86 by
TAS archeologists to determine the extent and condition of the former community (Moncure and
Jackson 1980:37). Both of these sites were revisited during the Oak Hill D-III survey (Skokan et al.
1997). This work revisited two previously recorded components (Rogers et al. 1992) at site
41RK86 (A and B). During the latter Oak Hill D-III survey, three additional components were
located, all of which appear to represent residences.

Sites 41RK322, 41RK375, and 41RK414
Site 41RK87 was recorded by TAS archeologists and identified as the ruins of a former antebellum
plantation dating from ca. 1854 (Moncure and Jackson 1980:37). It was recommended that
selective excavation be conducted to determine the existence of outbuilding remains and obtain a
sample of representative artifacts (Moncure and Jackson 1980:40). The site was revisited by TAS
personnel in 1982 (Jackson 1982) and was found to have been destroyed by bulldozing.

The two resources identified as H-4 and H-5 were briefly referenced by Moncure and Jackson
(1980:40) as possible tenant farms. It is not apparent from the text or from a subsequent report
from TAS concerning the area (Jackson 1982) whether either resource was assigned a site number.
A check of maps on file at TARL, however, revealed that site numbers 41RK107 and 41RK108 have
been assigned for two locations that are thought to represent the respective locations for H-4 and
H-5. Site 41RK107 is located within the Oak Hill D-III permit area and was revisited by Atkins in
1997 (Taylor and Tate 1997). It was subjected to NRHP eligibility testing in 2001 (Sherman 2001a)
where it was shown to represent a nineteenth-century domestic occupation that lacked
depositional integrity.
Besides site 41RK87, Moncure and Jackson (1980:40–42) briefly referenced three other possible
plantation house sites (Tutt, Vinson, and Magee) that were thought to be located somewhere in
Deposit 363. Remains of the three plantations were not located by Moncure and Jackson (1980). A
subsequent report from TAS (Jackson 1982) revealed the Vinson plantation (41RK128) to be in the
Oak Hill Mine but east of Farm to Market Road (FM) 1716, and the Tutt plantation to be out of the
mine. The remains of the Magee plantation were not located by Jackson (1982). Data recovery
investigations were later conducted on the Vinson plantation (Anderson et al. in preparation)

In January and February 1982, TAS archeologists conducted a cultural resource survey of the
railroad and transmission line corridor for the Martin Lake Mine-Area D (Moncure and Jackson
1982). Three sites were recorded. Prehistoric site 41RK10, first recorded by TAS in 1972
(McDonald 1972), was found to be destroyed.

Two historic sites were recorded, 41RK104 and 41RK105. The latter was a farmstead dating
possibly from the 1920s. The former site, the Thomas Jefferson Walling Cabin, dated from the
1840s (Moncure and Jackson 1982:24–34) and was determined eligible for the NRHP in 1982. The
log cabin was subjected to data recovery investigations (Moncure 1984) and eventually relocated to
the Depot Museum grounds in Henderson, Texas.

In July and August 1982, TAS (Jackson 1982) conducted an intensive survey of the Oak Hill Mine
(Martin Lake Mine Area D) west of FM 1716. The area for survey encompassed approximately 6,795
acres but, because of a lack of land access, about 494 acres could not be surveyed. Only four
prehistoric sites were recorded (41RK106, 41RK109, 41RK110, and 41RK111), all adjacent to Mill
Creek.

3. Cultural Background
Jackson (1983) also conducted a survey of a then-proposed electric transmission line corridor that
was to transect the present permit area. One possible historic site (41RK131) was recorded on the
basis of a hole filled with trash (site form on file at TARL).
Another investigation within the mine was conducted by HPG (1984). The remaining lands within
the Oak Hill Mine east of FM 1716 were intensively surveyed for cultural resources. Covering about
2,965 acres, only a single prehistoric dart point fragment was recovered (41RK143), excluding
historic resources. The virtual absence of prehistoric sites is thought to be due to a virtual lack of a
perennial water supply (HPG 1984:27). Nineteen historic sites (41RK128, 41RK144–41RK161)
were recorded. An additional 48 mid-to-late-twentieth-century structures were also described by
HPG as mostly modern homes. None of the structures was given archeological site status.

Other cultural resource investigation within the adjacent Oak Hill Mine was conducted by Atkins
archeologists in July 1985. The work was requested by TUMCO in partial response to a letter from
the THC dated June 17, 1985, to the Railroad Commission of Texas concerning the permit
application for the Oak Hill Surface Lignite Mine. The THC letter recommended, in part, that the
areas surrounding known springs be resurveyed to determine whether cultural resources were
located adjacent to the springs. The approximate locations of five springs were provided by the THC
on appropriate base maps. The area surrounding each spring was subjected to intensive pedestrian
survey (including screened shovel testing), totaling about 420 acres. No cultural resources were
located.
The same THC letter also recommended avoidance of prehistoric sites 41RK106 and 41RK109–
41RK111, survey of all areas not previously accessed by either TAS or HPG, and additional
investigations of 13 historic sites: 41RK115, 41RK123, 41RK126, 41RK128, 41RK147–41RK150,
41RK153–41RK156, and 41RK159.

Also in July 1985, at the request of TUMCO, Atkins archeologists conducted a field check of sites
41RK106, 41RK109, 41RK110, and 41RK111, all previously recorded by TAS archeologists (Jackson
1982; Moncure and Jackson 1980). The investigation was conducted to determine whether any of
the sites had been adversely impacted by land clearing for the then-proposed electric transmission
line corridor to be built and managed by Southwestern Electric Power Company. Site 41RK106 was
found to be extensively eroded due to natural runoff. The remaining sites were grass-covered and
little affected by natural erosion. None of the four sites visited by Atkins archeologists were found
to fall within the proposed transmission line corridor, and none had been impacted by construction.
Site 41RK109 was found to be about 33 m west of the western perimeter of the corridor (i.e., not
the centerline) and, because of its proximity to the corridor, it was recommended that heavy
machinery related to construction not be permitted to park or drive over site 41RK109 if such
machinery was to venture outside the utility corridor. A subsequent visit to the corridor by Atkins
Atkins 100027188/120124

17

Sites 41RK322, 41RK375, and 41RK414
archeologists in July 1987 revealed that the sites were not impacted by construction of the
completed transmission line.
In 1987, Atkins archeologists conducted a 100 percent cultural resources survey of all unsurveyed
lands then within the Oak Hill Mine (Glander et al. 1987). In addition, the study sought to reassess
all previously recorded sites within the entire mine. A total of 41 previously recorded sites were
relocated and their current status was assessed. Two previously unrecorded sites were also
located.

In 1989, Atkins conducted a cultural resources survey of a 2,281-acre area for the Oak Hill 2280
Mine northeast of Henderson (Rogers et al. 1992). Twenty-three archeological sites were located,
and five were recommended for further investigation to determine NRHP eligibility. The THC
agreed that the five sites warranted further work and also recommended that further investigations
were necessary to determine NRHP eligibility at three additional sites (Rogers et al. 1992). National
Register testing of these sites was conducted in 1992 and 1993 (Rogers et al. 1994), resulting in the
mitigation of sites 41RK214 (Rogers and Perttula 2004), 41RK222 (Rogers et al. 2001), and
41RK223 (Foster and Rogers 2000), the avoidance of site 41RK215, and the determination that
41RK86A, 41RK108, 41RK216, and 41RK218 were not eligible for nomination to the NRHP.
The most recent large-scale survey effort in the area was the cultural resources investigations of the
Oak Hill D-III Permit Area in Rusk County by Atkins in May of 1994 (Skokan et al. 1997). The area
subject to intensive survey encompassed 13,412 acres, an additional 521 acres was unavailable due
to landowners who would not permit access to their property. A total of 195 previously unrecorded
sites were discovered in the area and 8 previously recorded sites were reassessed.

Atkins conducted NRHP testing on sites 41RK107, 41RK240, 41RK242, 41RK243, 41RK247,
41RK248, 41RK270, 41RK272, 41RK275, 41RK276, 41RK284, 41RK286, and 41RK379 within the
DIII Mine area (Sherman 2001a, 2001b; Sherman and Victor 2001). Site 41RK243 was shown to
represent a Caddo habitation with preserved subsistence remains. Site 41RK247 harbored two
historic components, one of which (Historic Component II) was shown to represent a circa Civil
War–era homestead that may have been associated with the Walling family (Sherman et al. 2006).

Hallsville Mine

In 1977, Atkins conducted a preliminary reconnaissance of the South Hallsville Mine Area. Eight
prehistoric sites were recorded, six of which were thought to be Caddo occupations (Dibble 1977).
In 1978, Atkins archeologists surveyed 20 percent of the South Hallsville mine area in the Sabine
River Valley. A total of 88 prehistoric sites were recorded, 83 of which were in creek bottoms along
the Sabine River. Only 5 sites were found in upland regions (Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc.
[EH&A] 1979; Freeman 1978). Additional archeological survey in the Hallsville area was conducted
by Atkins personnel in 1983 in response to mine transportation system reroutes. Twenty
Atkins 100027188/120124

18

3. Cultural Background
previously recorded sites were visited and three sites were newly recorded. Limited testing was
conducted on five of these sites (Voellinger 1984).

In the 1980s, North American Consultants Inc. (NAC) of Dallas carried out several small cultural
resource investigations in the South Hallsville Mine Area. These included a dragline erection site
(La Vardera 1982), a proposed transmission line and associated facility (La Vardera 1983a), a haul
road and pond area (La Vardera 1983b), the 1984 and 1985 impact areas (La Vardera 1984a) and
other anticipated future impact areas for the life of the permit (La Vardera 1984b, 1987, 1988).
Subsequently, limited testing was conducted by NAC (La Vardera 1983c, 1984c, 1986) on three
sites and nine others that had been originally recorded by EH&A (Dibble 1977; EH&A 1979). Only
one of these sites was recommended for further work. This site, 41HS282, was found to be a small
Caddo hamlet and was avoided by further mining operations.
In 1990 Southern Archaeological Consultants, Inc. (SAC) conducted a survey of a dragline walkway
and county road reroute, recording 19 sites and reassessing 12 previously recorded sites.
Subsequent NRHP testing was conducted at 11 of the sites. Two sites were recommended for
further work (Keller 1990).

During the spring of 1990, SAC performed an archeological survey of 1,305 acres at the South
Hallsville Mine (Keller 1991). As a result of this work, 19 sites were located and 12 previously
recorded sites were revisited. Twelve of the sites were recommended for further work. SAC
conducted an additional archeological survey of 2,251 acres during the summer of 1991 at the
South Hallsville Mine (Keller 1994). Forty-one sites were recorded, and 24 previously recorded
sites were revisited. Nineteen of the sites were recommended for further work.
In 1994 SAC performed a survey of the South Hallsville No. 1 Mine containing an area of 660 acres
(Keller 1994). The survey produced a total of nine previously unrecorded sites and three previously
recorded sites. Of the newly recorded sites, six are prehistoric and three are historic. Two of the
previously recorded sites were strictly prehistoric and one was a multicomponent site.

CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY

Paleoindian Period (10,000–6000 B.C.)
The Paleoindian period is the earliest generally accepted cultural period of the Americas and
includes prehistoric peoples who inhabited North America from the end of the Pleistocene epoch
until the early Holocene epoch. This period is alternatively referred to as the time of the “Big Game
Hunting” tradition, due to a presumed heavy reliance upon now-extinct species of Pleistocene
megafauna as a food source during the early part of the period (Willey 1966:37). It should be noted,
however, that such megafaunal remains are rarely found in association with Paleoindian cultural
remains, and this presumed heavy reliance on megafauna is probably overemphasized.
Atkins 100027188/120124

19

Sites 41RK322, 41RK375, and 41RK414
Social organization probably consisted of loosely structured, highly mobile social groups composed
of several nuclear families referred to as bands. Sites of this period are often representative of
transient camps along small streams occupied by band-sized or smaller groups. Base camp–sized
occupation loci are relatively rare and usually associated with lithic procurement activities. The
population density is thought to have been rather low during this period.

Clovis and Folsom point types are generally thought to be representative of the earlier part of the
Paleoindian period, and point types such as Dalton, San Patrice, Scottsbluff, and Plainview are
thought to represent the later part of the period. Although a Paleoindian presence is clearly evident
in east Texas, many of the finds are out of context, limited generally to surface finds or to sites
where Paleoindian materials are in association with Archaic materials (Davis and Davis 1960;
Duffield 1963; Johnson 1962; Jones 1957; Northern and Skiles 1981:28; Voellinger 1984).

Paleoindian sites are rare in the region. Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Scottsbluff points have
been recovered in Rusk County by private collectors (Story 1990). No scientific excavations of
Paleoindian components have been conducted in Rusk County. In Van Zandt County, two Clovis
point bases were recovered, possibly in context, from the Yarbrough site (41VN6) during
excavation of the lower levels of the site (Suhm et al. 1954:147). In Gregg County, Angostura,
Scottsbluff, and Plainview points were found at the Grace Creek sites in a somewhat disturbed
context (Jones 1957:219–220). Two sites in Upshur County and one site in Wood County have been
reported to have Paleoindian components in a stratigraphic context (Perttula et al. 1986:49).

During the late Paleoindian period, a presumed population increase appears to have been
associated with the development of localized cultural patterns (Hester 1986:9). There is evidence of
migration of Plains populations entering the Eastern Woodlands during this time. Johnson (1989)
developed the hypothesis that these peoples were migrating as a result of drought and its
subsequent effect on Plains fauna.
Story (1990:177) summarized the lifeways and organization of Paleoindian inhabitants of the Gulf
Coastal Plain as characterized by a high degree of mobility with only brief stays at any one location.
The ecological diversity of the Gulf Coastal Plain could have been optimized with movement over a
relatively large geographical area.

Archaic Period (6000–400 B.C.)

The Archaic period is typically defined as the period when migratory hunting and gathering
cultures adapted to changing environmental conditions through expanded exploitation of varied
ecological niches and development of a more varied material culture to exploit these different
environments and resources. The Archaic period has been divided into three subperiods: Early,
Middle, and Late. Early Archaic populations made their living in much the same way as their
Paleoindian predecessors. In terms of material culture, the Archaic period is characterized by lesscarefully fashioned, increasingly varied tool kits and a decrease in the use of exotic raw materials.
Atkins 100027188/120124

20

3. Cultural Background
Story (1990:213) suggests that these phenomena reflect a decrease in the spatial area of the
seasonal round and a shift to more-expedient, task-specific tool use. It is suggested that utilization
of floral and faunal resources reached an optimal diversity during the Early Archaic, which was
accompanied by changes in the methods of food procurement and preparation. In most areas of the
Southeast, human populations saw a gradual and continued expansion throughout the Archaic
period.

Terraces and floodplain projections are noted by Thurmond (1990) to be the locations of many
Archaic sites. Hunting and gathering provided a subsistence of deer and small mammals, along with
seasonally available vegetal foods. Seasonal rounds within a restricted territory are thought to
typify the settlement pattern during this stage (Hsu 1969; Hsu et al. 1969:32; McCormick 1973:11–
15, 1974:6; Northern 1981:6). These seasonal rounds may have served to permit the interaction of
populations and fostered the diffusion of cultigens or other cultural innovations (Story 1985:54).
Thurmond (1990) noted an increase in the frequency of Early Archaic components from the
Paleoindian period and that this increase in density continues at least until the Early Ceramic
period. Along Big Sandy Creek in Upshur County, Early Archaic sites appear to be distributed on
terrace and upland projections within major drainage basins (Perttula et al. 1986:50). Similar
patterns have been found elsewhere (Anderson 1973:162; Bruseth and Perttula 1981; Jones 1957).

Middle Archaic components are better represented in the sampled portion of the archeological
record than those from preceding periods (Bruseth and Perttula 1981; Johnson 1962; Voellinger
1984). Settlement patterns appear to be little changed from previous periods (Perttula et al.
1986:51), although site density appears to increase (Thurmond 1990). Within the Martin Lake mine
complex in Panola County, site 41PN76 may reflect a Middle Archaic occupation (Glander, Victor et
al. 1986:94, 95).
For the Late Archaic, there is a continued increase in site density, especially along tributaries to
major drainages (Perttula et al. 1986:52; Thurmond 1990). Perttula et al. (1986:52) suggest that
the more widely dispersed settlements in the region are indicative of a diffuse economy based upon
the hunting and gathering of local food resources. Northern (1981:7) suggests that fishing and
mussel collection intensified, and this intensification reflected a shift from a restricted wandering
community pattern to a more centrally based pattern. Numerous sites with Late Archaic
components have been excavated in the region (Bruseth and Perttula 1981; Duffield 1963; Johnson
1962; Jones 1957; Voellinger 1984).

Early Ceramic or Woodland Period (400 B.C.–A.D. 800)

The concept of an Early Ceramic or Woodland period is not new (Bell 1953; Fields and Thurmond
1980; Jelks 1965; Thurmond 1990; Webb et al. 1969; Wyckoff and Fisher 1985). Story (1990:293)
refers to it as the Early Ceramic period, and Perttula et al. (1986) refer to it generally as the
Woodland period. Significant Early Ceramic components have been identified at the Resch site
Atkins 100027188/120124

21

Sites 41RK322, 41RK375, and 41RK414
(41HS16) in southern Harrison County (Webb et al. 1969), the Folley site (41RK26) in northeastern
Rusk County (Jarvis 1972), the Haddens Bend site in southwestern DeSoto Parish, Louisiana
(Jensen 1968), the Coral Snake Mound (16SA48) in the Toledo Bend Reservoir area (McClurkan et
al. 1966, 1980), and the Yarbrough site and several sites in the Lake Fork Reservoir in Wood County
(Bruseth and Perttula 1981; Perttula and Skiles 1988). Perttula posits regional variation in food
subsistence technology based on an uneven distribution of ceramics and lithics during this period
(Perttula and Nelson 2006).

Generally, these sites are defined by sandy paste ceramics as well as wares associated with
Tchefuncte, Coles Creek, and Marksville periods, probably introduced from the Lower Mississippi
Valley. In Titus County, Thurmond (1990) identified Marksville ceramics at site 41TT108 in the
Cypress Creek Basin. Both arrow points (e.g., Friley) and dart points (e.g., Gary and Kent) have been
recovered on Woodland period sites (Perttula and Nelson 2006). In Gregg County, Jones (1968:25)
identified a Troyville sherd from the Ware Acres site. Habitation features and subsistence data are
generally limited to pit features and burned rock concentrations (Perttula and Nelson 2006).

Caddo Period (A.D. 800–1680)

The succeeding period in northeast Texas is associated with the Caddo development. Wyckoff
(1971) visualizes Caddo culture as a peripheral recipient of the uniformities attributed to the
“Mississippian Pattern” of the Lower Mississippi Valley. Caddo is recognized by the presence of
mound centers and village sites along the terraces of major streams. Horticultural, and eventually
agricultural, activities supplemented hunting and gathering activities. As defined by ritual burials
and trade networks, a stratified society was probably typical of Caddo culture.

Krieger’s (1946) Gibson/Fulton aspect dichotomy was revised to the currently used five-period
Caddo sequence by the Eleventh Caddoan Conference in 1968 (Davis 1970). Caddo I and II relate to
Krieger’s Gibson aspect, and Caddo III, IV, and V correspond to the Fulton aspect. Many problems
have arisen from the use of the five-period sequence, largely because it was devised to describe
cultural complexes rather than chronological assignment. Story (1990:324) has suggested
abandoning the Caddo I–V terminology and replacing it with an explicitly defined temporal
framework of five subperiods:
•

•
•
•
•

Formative Caddoan — A.D. 800–1000

Early Caddoan — A.D. 1000–1200

Middle Caddoan — A.D. 1200–1400
Late Caddoan — A.D. 1400–1680

Historic Caddoan — A.D. 1680–1860

For reasons previously discussed, the division of Early and Late Caddo in the Martin Lake area is
similar to that proposed by Krieger in 1946 in his definition of the Fulton and Gibson aspects.
Atkins 100027188/120124

22

3. Cultural Background
Thurmond’s division of the Early Caddo into periods 1 and 2 is similar to the chronological units
defined by Davis (1970) as Caddo 1 and Caddo 2. Thurmond bases this separation on the
presumption that the ceramics of the Alto focus predate ceramics of the Sanders focus (Thurmond
1990). While not distinguished as phases within the Early Caddo, Thurmond (1990) equates the
Alto and Sanders foci to periods 1 and 2.

The Alto phase is the first distinctively Caddo cultural manifestation (Creel 1980; Story 1972). The
George C. Davis site (41CE19) on the Neches River is the type site. Although the later Caddo people
were agricultural, the presence of domesticated corn at the Davis site is suggestive of horticultural
activities. It was recovered from the site in conjunction with large quantities of hardwood nutshells
and deer bones, indicating it may not have been a main staple of their diet (Story et al. 1981).

The production of a food surplus appears to be associated with the specialization of labor and the
communal support of a political or religious leader. Village sites were established in major river
valleys with, in some cases, accompanying mounds (Northern 1981:8). Alto sites are found from the
Brazos River near Waco (Watt 1953:57) to north-central Louisiana (Richner 1982:12). Funeral
practices indicate that status was important. Burials were extended in pits or in small mounds with
grave goods relative to an individual’s social position. Diagnostic lithic artifacts include Alba,
Bonham, Catahoula, and Scallorn points. Diagnostic ceramics include Davis Incised, Holly Fine
Engraved, Hickory Fine Engraved, Spiro Engraved, Kiam Incised, Weches Fingernail Impressed,
Coles Creek Incised, Crockett Curvilinear Incised, Pennington Punctated-Incised, and Dunkin
Incised (Clark and Ivey 1974:9; Thurmond 1990). Site 41PN45, found in the Martin Lake mine
complex in Panola County, may contain an Alto phase component (Glander and Brandimarte
1983:133–135). In Rusk County, Jones identified an Alto component from the Cherokee Lake site
(41RK132) (1968:59) and 41RK3 (1968:76). McDonald suggested an Early Caddo component
(Alto?) for 41RK30 and 41RK32 (1972:21).

The Sanders phase of the Early Caddo was defined for the Sanders site (41LR2) in Lamar County,
Texas (Krieger 1946). Sites are typically on terraces and knolls near water resources, but away
from major river drainages except at the upstream end (Northern 1981:9). Subsistence relied
heavily on deer and small mammals but was supplemented by agricultural activity, which is
evidenced by scapula hoes. Undecorated clay-grit-tempered ceramics, principally Sanders Plain,
predominate. Examples of decorated ware include Sanders Engraved, Canton Incised, and Hickory
Fine Engraved. Other decorated ceramics typical of northeast Texas during this period are
Monkstown Fingernail Impressed and Maxey Noded Redware (Clark and Ivey 1974:9; Thurmond
1990). Although no Sanders sites have been identified within the Martin Lake mine complex, they
have been recorded in the Troup Mine (Skinner et al. 1981), in Lake Fork Reservoir, and in the
upper Neches and Sabine river valleys (Anderson 1972; Skiles et al. 1980).
Clarence Webb (1948) defined the Bossier focus to refer to Caddo cultural developments in
northwest Louisiana and northeast Texas represented by about 50 sites. The core area of the focus
Atkins 100027188/120124

23

Sites 41RK322, 41RK375, and 41RK414
was centered around the Louisiana parishes of Bossier, Caddo, and DeSoto, to the east of Rusk
County. Typical Bossier sites were thought to represent small villages and hamlets often situated on
terrace margins and lateral lakes of effluent streams near the valley of the Red River. The focus is
believed to have existed between the end of Alto and the subsequent Belcher times. According to
Webb (1983), radiometric assays indicate the transition from Alto to early Bossier occurred
between A.D. 1250 and 1350.
The Early Caddo saw the introduction of the bow and arrow (Perttula et al. 1986:54). Maize has
been recovered from flotation samples from Early Caddo sites, and settlement patterns seem to
consist of dispersed hamlets and farmsteads (Perttula et al. 1986:54–55).

Thurmond (1990) observes that ca. A.D. 1400, the elements of Caddo material culture, manifested
archeologically in ceramic and projectile point assemblages, differentiate along a line drawn
roughly north to south somewhat west of Caddo Lake in Harrison County, Texas. The observed
differences west to east are hypothesized by Thurmond (1990) to represent probable social groups.

The Late Caddo appears to be noted by an increase in regional variants. The Whelan and Titus
phases of the Late Caddo are proposed by Thurmond (1990) to represent the Cypress Cluster, a
culture that is hypothesized to represent a possible third Caddo confederacy. This unnamed
confederacy is in addition to the Hasinai and Kadohadacho confederacies (Swanton 1942) and is
hypothesized to be centered in the upper Cypress Creek drainage basin.

Thurmond’s model of the Cypress Cluster is derived from a sociopolitical settlement model for the
protohistoric and historic Caddo hypothesized by Story and Creel (1982). Story and Creel’s model is
based upon an interpretation of the archeological record with ethnographic analogy. Their model is
composed of two major levels: the affiliated group, which they term the “Anderson Cluster,” and
constituent groups. Like the hypothesized Cypress Cluster, the Anderson Cluster is analogous to a
Caddo confederacy in the vicinity of the upper Neches and Angelina rivers southwest of the Martin
Lake Mine permit area. The constituent groups are equated by Thurmond (1990) with individual
tribes composed of multiple settlements, cemeteries, and limited-use areas.

The Whelan phase is identified as the earliest formation of the Cypress Cluster (Thurmond 1990).
The Whelan phase is represented at several sites that were excavated as part of the salvage work
performed north of the permit area at Lake O’ the Pines in Upshur and Marion counties, Texas
(Davis 1958; Jelks and Tunnell 1959). This phase is marked by the reduction in size of ceremonial
structures. Mounds were constructed over the burned remains of one or several circular structures.
Thurmond (1990) notes that at least three spatial clusters of Whelan phase settlements, cemeteries,
and limited-use areas existed in the Cypress Basin, each having one or more mound components at
its center. While Thurmond cites the possibility of this reflecting survey bias, the possibility of these
concentrations representing archeological manifestations of three Cypress Cluster constituent
groups during the Whelan phase should not be overlooked. Common ceramic types of the Whelan
Atkins 100027188/120124

24

3. Cultural Background
phase include Ripley Engraved, Taylor Engraved, Maddox Engraved, Maydelle Incised, Belcher
Ridged, Bullard Brushed, and Pease Brushed-Incised (Clark and Ivey 1974:9; Thurmond 1990).
Alba, Perdiz, and Scallorn arrow points are also found in sites attributed to the Whelan phase (Davis
1970; Thurmond 1990).

Cypress Cluster components of the Titus phase are hypothesized by Thurmond (1990) to extend
south to about the Sabine River. During the Titus phase, mound building was limited to
substructural mounds (Perttula 1997). Ceramics are almost exclusively grog tempered and include
Ripley Engraved, Taylor Engraved, Simms Engraved, Wilder Engraved, Harleton Appliqué, Karnack
Brushed Incised, LaRue Neck Banded, and Bullard Brushed. Diagnostic lithics include Talco, Maud,
and Bassett arrow points (Clark and Ivey 1974:9; Thurmond 1990).

Another Late Caddo grouping, identified as the Frankston phase, is centered just west of the Martin
Lake Mine area around the Neches River in Smith, Henderson, Cherokee, and Van Zandt counties.
House patterns have been reported from sites in Lake Palestine (Anderson et al. 1974:178–180),
and circular houses are a reported characteristic of this occupation (Davis 1958:37). In the upper
Neches River region, Frankston sites are described as small scattered hamlets with one to three
houses (Anderson et al. 1974:179). It is the Frankston phase and the succeeding Allen phase for
which Story hypothesizes the Anderson Cluster on the upper Neches and Angelina drainages (Story
and Creel 1982). Like Thurmond’s (1990) Cypress Cluster, the Anderson Cluster represents
essentially a shared sociopolitical interaction between constituent groups of the Late Caddo within
the cluster. Archeological components of Story’s model represent major centers, lesser centers,
small villages and hamlets, and isolated farmsteads (Story and Creel 1982). The lesser centers of
this model are usually located near the center of an inhabited watershed (Story and Creel 1982).
The ceramics inventory of the Frankston phase includes Poynor Engraved, Bullard Brushed, and
Killough Pinched wares. Temper is coarse clay-grit, but occasionally pulverized bone or grog was
added. Perdiz points are common to the lithic inventory (Suhm et al. 1954).

Early Exploration and Settlement

European exploration in present-day Rusk County appears to have been concentrated in the
southwestern portion of the county. In the late seventeenth century, Spanish explorer Domingo
Terán de los Rios led an expedition in what is now east Texas with the purpose of exploring the
land and establishing eight missions among the Tejas and neighboring Indian tribes. In November
of 1691, Terán traveled through Rusk County, crossing the Angelina River in the county’s
southwestern corner and continuing northeastward through the county to the Red River. The
expedition reached a Caddo Indian settlement and returned in December along the same route
(Winfrey 1961:10).

A second expedition led by Captain Domingo Ramón crossed the southwestern corner of presentday Rusk County between 1716 and 1719. Driven by fears of French encroachment, the Spanish

Atkins 100027188/120124

Sites 41RK322, 41RK375, and 41RK414
expedition, which included priests and soldiers, established six missions and a presidio in the
region. The southwestern corner of the county was crossed again in 1760 by Fray José Francisco
Calahorra y Saenz, a Spanish missionary who traveled towards two Tehuacana Indian villages along
the upper Sabine River (Winfrey 1961:10). In 1788, an expedition commissioned by the governor of
the province of New Mexico and led by Pedro Vial crossed the northern region of Rusk County while
exploring a route from Santa Fe to Natchitoches, Louisiana (Winfrey 1961:11). Although it does not
appear that any early European settlements were located in the vicinity of site 41RK322, it is
possible that European explorers passed through the area during their travels.

The vicinity surrounding site 41RK322 includes several original land grants issued at various times
during the mid-nineteenth century (Figure 2). Land in Texas was distributed through the
empresario system during the Spanish and Mexican periods of government. In Rusk County, land
began to be distributed officially during the Mexican period from 1821 to 1836. The first land grant
issued in what is now Rusk County was given to William Elliott on March 22, 1829, under the Law
of Colonization of March 1825. Elliott received one league, the equivalent of 4,428.4 acres, situated
in the southeastern portion of what became Rusk County near the present community of
Lawsonville along the Angelina River. The second and third land grants were issued to brothers
Thomas and Leonard Williams in May of 1829. Both received one league each situated along the
Angelina River in what is now the Mount Enterprise community (Winfrey 1961:11–12).

The Mexican Decree of 1830 was passed on April 6 of that year, preventing further Anglo
colonization in the so-called Neutral Ground between the Neches and Sabine rivers. However, the
portion of the law prohibiting immigration was repealed 3 years later on November 5, 1833, during
a meeting in Saltillo, Mexico, between Santa Anna and Stephen F. Austin (Greaser 2003). Although
the prohibition on settlement in the area including Rusk County had officially ended, settlement
proceeded at a slower pace between 1833 and 1834 when only three land grants were issued in the
future county. Joseph Durst received one league of land along the Angelina River in May of 1833,
and Henry Stockman was granted two leagues on the west side the river in August of that same
year. In 1834, William Williams received the only land grant issued in Rusk County. The following
year; however, 43 land grants were awarded. The majority were located on or adjacent to the two
major waterways in the region, the Angelina and Sabine rivers (Winfrey 1961:13).

After the Texas Revolution in 1836, Anglo settlers began to migrate into Texas in earnest, arriving
by way of Trammel’s Trace (Figure 3), which divided the western boundary of present-day Panola
County and the eastern boundary of Rusk County, paralleling current Rusk County Road 3231. The
trail was named for Nicholas Trammel, who reportedly used the trail to run stolen horses as early
as 1813, though it had been an established Native American trail for hundreds of years. Trammel’s
Trace was one of the major conduits from the U.S. Territories into Texas and connected the
Southwest Trail at Fulton, Arkansas. From there it continued southwestward into Texas at Pecan
Point (near Texarkana) then turned southwestward to Sulphur Fork in present-day Cass County

Sites 41RK322, 41RK375, and 41RK414
then south, terminating at Nacogdoches. The trace entered northeastern Rusk County at Rocky Ford
on the Sabine River and traveled south along the eastern boundary of the county, passing near the
present-day sites of the Harmony Hill, Tatum, and Mount Enterprise communities (Winfrey
1961:11). A majority of the immigrants traveling along the trail were heading for the fertile prairies
of south central and southeastern Texas where Stephen F. Austin, Sterling C. Robertson, and others
had established successful colonies. The land there was generally open with ample sources of
water, making it significantly more suitable for settlement and farming than the heavily forested
terrain of northeast Texas (Dixon et al. 2007).

Antebellum Development in Rusk County and the Vicinity of Site 41RK322

The Congress of the Republic of Texas formed Rusk County on January 16, 1843, from parts of
Nacogdoches County, with Trammel’s Trace demarcating its eastern boundary. The county was
named for Thomas Jefferson Rusk, who had been the Secretary of War under President Sam
Houston. The county seat was laid out near its geographical center (Knapp and Biesele 2010) close
to the early settlement of Gibsontown. General James Smith and William B. Ochiltree, early settlers
and plantation owners, donated the land for what became the community of Henderson. The men
named the town in honor of their friend James Pinckney Henderson, who became first governor of
the new State of Texas 2 years later (Winfrey 1961).
The period immediately following the creation of Rusk County saw increased settlement
throughout the region. More specifically, review of Texas General Land Office records from the
period indicates that intensive land speculation characterized the years between 1848 and 1854
(Foster and Rogers 2000:7). The survey containing site 41RK322 was patented at the advent of this
period in 1848 (Texas General Land Office, Rusk County Abstract #879), suggesting the Walling
family was actively involved in such activities.

The same period saw the expansion of plantation agriculture. By 1850, the county “contained
numerous plantations, including 17 with 10,000 or more acres,” most located outside the county
seat of Henderson. These plantations were operated by slave labor, and African Americans made up
over 20 percent (Foster and Rogers 2000:8) of the county’s approximately 8,148 residents. By
1860, Rusk County was the most populous in the state, with an estimated 15,803 residents
(Winfrey 1961:53). Most of the new residents immigrated to the county from the southeastern
United States, most commonly from Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Georgia, Arkansas, Louisiana,
and Missouri (Lathrop 1949). These new settlers brought with them their social and economic
practices, including the plantation system of agriculture. This system not only characterized the
economy of the South, but influenced social and political development throughout the southeastern
United States. During the Mexican and Republic periods of Texas, both governments attempted to
prevent the spread of slavery by banning the importation of enslaved people from other countries.

28

Sites 41RK322, 41RK375, and 41RK414
However, it was legal to import them from other states, and the plantation culture persisted
(Campbell 1989). Many settlers from other states brought enslaved people with them, and many
others were illegally smuggled from foreign countries and brought north across trails, such as
Trammel’s Trace (Jackson 2012; Pirtle 2012; Silverthorne 1986).

Within the vicinity of site 41RK322, plantation agriculture developed on a smaller scale than in
other portions of the county. This trend may have been related to the “hilly upland
terrain . . . [and] . . . the marshy bottomlands” that characterized the region’s geography (Foster and
Rogers 2000:8). Additionally, review of contemporary deed and tax records suggests that the
Walling family was the only group living in the area at the time with sufficient means to engage in
large-scale agriculture (Foster and Rogers 2000:8), though they were also involved in railroad and
land speculation, and both Jesse and John Walling owned enslaved persons during the antebellum
era.

Overall, agriculture in Rusk County remained focused on self-sufficiency rather than commercial
profit during the 1840s and 1850s. The primary crops produced in the county according to the
1850 census were corn, sweet potatoes, and oats. Cotton was a distant fourth, reflecting the lack of
markets, processing facilities, and efficient transportation options during the period. The
agricultural character of the region changed dramatically between 1850 and 1860 as the county’s
population doubled and the amount of improved farmland increased by over 400 percent (Foster
and Rogers 2000:12). This increase in population and cultivation was accompanied by an increase
in infrastructure such as mill, gins, and roads. These trends are reflected specifically in the history
of Millville, a historic community located approximately 1 mile southeast of site 41RK322.

Millville: An Early Texas Boom Town

Permanent Anglo settlement in the Millville vicinity began in earnest in the period immediately
following the Texas Revolution. The community itself was originally known as Liberty Hill and was
located on land donated by Jesse Walling along what was known as the Old Stagecoach Road. The
Walling brothers moved to Texas from North Carolina prior to the Texas Revolution and settled in
Nacogdoches. Jesse Walling received a 4,000-acre grant from the Mexican government in October
1835; however, the title was never completed due to the advent of the Texas Revolution. After the
revolution, he received a bounty grant for his service in the Republic Army. Millville was founded
on that 640-acre tract in Rusk County (Foster and Rogers 2000:17) (for more information about the
Walling family, see the property history section of Chapter 5).
The community developed around a gristmill constructed by Willis Francis Callaway and Enoch
Hays in 1849 on land they purchased from Jesse Walling (Foster and Rogers 2000:19). The milling
of grain, particularly corn, was an essential activity for pioneer subsistence in early Texas, and the
presence of a mill was a natural impetus for settlement during the antebellum period. The mill,
which was constructed using enslaved labor, was so successful that it soon expanded to include a

Atkins 100027188/120124

30

3. Cultural Background
cotton gin and sawmill during the early 1850s. It continued to operate into the postbellum era
(Foster and Rogers 2000:19–20).

In addition to the mill, the community’s proximity to a major transportation route prompted the
development of additional commercial and industrial facilities during the 1850s. For example, the
Old Stagecoach Road became known as the Wire Road after the Red River Telegraph Company
erected the state’s first telegraph line alongside the roadway (Figure 4). The telegraph “operated
from New Orleans to Shreveport, Jefferson, Marshall, Camden, Millville, and . . . through Henderson
to other points southwest.” The first telegraph office in Rusk County was opened in Millville, and
several other businesses followed suit (Foster and Rogers 2000:20).
During the same period, the community included “several mercantile stores, a drug store, a
blacksmith, and a pottery business,” some of which developed before the town was platted. For
example, an 1851 deed indicates an individual named James A. Ground managed a mercantile
business owned by Noel H. Howard of Millville and his partner Elish H. Jordan of Shreveport,
Louisiana. There was also a “tanyard lot” owned by James L. Yantis, a blacksmith shop owned by
James Walling, a saloon, and a two-store, eight-room log lodging facility known as the “Twelve Acre
Hotel” (Foster and Rogers 2000:20).

In 1853, Bill Wilhelm, the individual hired to construct the community’s mill a few years earlier,
constructed a furniture, plow, and shoe factory that made “furniture, wagons, and other
implements.” Wilhelm also reportedly operated another tanning yard and “sold the leather shoes he
made throughout Texas and to other states. The business was later relocated to Harmony Hill.
Another factory opened during the Civil War that carded wool from local sheep (Foster and Rogers
2000:21). Secondary sources do not indicate whether these facilities operated using enslaved labor,
though that information may be included in industrial census data from the period.

The amount of industrial development in the Millville area appears to have been unique among
rural East Texas communities during the antebellum period. Though many communities with such
amenities developed during the railroad era, prior to the Civil War, rural residents were often
forced to travel many miles to process their agricultural products. The proximity of Millville to a
major transportation route and its geographic location at a historic crossroads prompted
development there and influenced settlement in the region as farmers sought prime land in the
vicinity of the community. As with other communities in the county and state, Millville went into a
period of decline after it was bypassed by the railroad in the 1880s. It was later bypassed by the
highway as well, and by the early twentieth century, its remaining businesses and school had
relocated to Oak Hill, the community adjacent to site 41RK322. At present, all that remains in the
community is the former church and cemetery (Biesele 2012).

3. Cultural Background

The Civil War and Postbellum Development in Rusk County and the Vicinity of Site 41RK322
On the eve of the Civil War, Rusk County was one of the wealthiest counties in Texas, with enslaved
people comprising and producing a large amount of this wealth. By 1860, Rusk County had one of
the largest populations of enslaved people in the state. Given the county’s dependence on enslaved
labor and the dominance of the plantation-based economy, it is not surprising that the county voted
overwhelmingly in support of secession, and a large number of Rusk County men joined the
Confederate Army, with 12 companies mustering in Henderson (Knapp and Beisele 2012).

Like other places dependent on the plantation system of agriculture, Rusk County’s economy
collapsed after the Civil War. A severe drought also contributed to this decline in wealth (Knapp
and Beisele 2012). This downturn in the county’s development is evident in agricultural production
totals recorded in the 1870 census. Of 21 residents with an annual income of $30,000 or more in
1860, only 2 remained 10 years later. The amount of improved farmland dropped by over
20 percent, and the yields of all but one of the county’s principal crops decreased from a decade
earlier. Cotton, the one exception, attained even greater significance during this period, as it was the
most viable source of income for local farmers, including newly freed slaves.

Although the Civil War signaled a period of hardship for Texas, it was spared much of the physical
destruction witnessed by the Deep South. In states such as Tennessee, Mississippi, and Georgia, the
decreased land values and loss of enslaved labor were coupled with the physical destruction
resulting from being on the front line of the war. Furthermore, these areas had engaged in
exhaustive agricultural practices for a long period prior to the war. During the postbellum period,
many displaced southerners saw Texas as a land of new opportunity, abundant cheap land, and rich
soil. Rusk County, like many other areas of the state, saw moderate increases in population during
the late 1860s and 1870s as farmers from the Deep South migrated to Texas (Knapp and Beisele
2012).

During the 1870s, Rusk County recovered from the drought and the effects of the Civil War. A major
impetus for the county’s recovery was the 1872 arrival of the county’s first rail line, the Illinois and
Great Northern Railroad (Knapp and Beisele 2012). This railroad reached Overton in the northwest
corner of the county by 1872 and Henderson by 1874. The railroad proved to be a major factor in
the growth of commercial and shipping hubs, such as Henderson, and it also had some effect on the
outlying areas. Rather than relying on arduous overland transport of their crops to distant
processing centers, rural farmers were able to ship them from Henderson. The railroads not only
increased the efficiency of farmers’ export process, it also increased their market access and
exposure to advanced farming implements, which further increased farming efficiency.

Although the arrival of the railroad created a more efficient farming system and provided increased
market access, the project area remained rural, and countywide prosperity never reached that of
the antebellum period. This economic shift was in part a reflection of the tenant farming and
Atkins 100027188/120124

33

Sites 41RK322, 41RK375, and 41RK414
sharecropping systems that developed after the Civil War. Often used interchangeably or defined as
subsets of one another, tenant farming and sharecropping both operated to allow people who did
not own land to have land to farm and to live on. In exchange for this land, tenants paid rent either
in cash or by providing part of their crop as payment (Wilson 1996). Sharecroppers provided labor
for the landowners, and received a share of the final crop, which was often brokered by the
landowner without the sharecropper’s input. This usually resulted in a cycle of dependency that
was difficult for the sharecropper to escape (Harper and Odom 2012).

A similar cycle often arose in tenant/landowner relationships. Tenants generally differed from
sharecroppers in that they paid the landowner for the use of the land either in cash or in crops, and
sometimes owned some or all of the necessary farming equipment. Tenant payment was often a
percentage of the crop yield and variable at the landowner’s discretion. This again created a system
similar to that of the sharecropper in which the tenant was beholden to the landowner, particularly
when the tenant’s crop yield was not as high as anticipated and agreed-upon payments could not be
met. In such situations, the landowner could then seize equipment as payment, perpetuating the
cycle (Harper and Odom 2012; Wilson 1996).

Most freedmen who did not become involved in the sharecropping system moved to the segregated
communities adjacent to white towns to find work. However, a minority of these ex-slaves began
communities that became known as “Freedom Colonies” or “Freedmen Settlements.” These
settlements were often started by ex-slaves who had acquired enough wealth to purchase their own
land or by groups of squatters in far-removed places. These communities were usually spread
across large parcels of land and most often developed around a church, cemetery, and/or a school.
These freedmen’s colonies tended to be located in rural and remote areas on unimproved or
abandoned parcels or on land along county lines and other unincorporated properties. Residents
preferred these remote locations because the land was available, and the unmapped or unofficial
locations provided protection from those who might resent freed slaves owning property (Sitton
and Conrad 2005). Census research indicates that there may have been such a community within
the vicinity of site 41RK322, though it does not appear to have been associated with it.

In 1907, less than half of Rusk County’s farms were owner operated and the average farm size was
about 75 acres (Knapp and Beisele 2012), suggesting a tenant/sharecropper system was firmly in
place at that time. Cotton continued to be the chief crop cultivated in Rusk County during the early
twentieth century and was the mainstay of the local economy as cotton demand continued to rise,
particularly during World War I. However, the drop in prices following the war coupled with the
damage of the boll weevil proved a devastating blow to cotton farmers throughout the state. The
decline in cotton culture continued in the 1920s when the federal government enacted crop
stabilization methods including acreage control, the introduction of synthetic fibers, and a high
tariff on cotton (Britton et al. 2012).

Atkins 100027188/120124

34

3. Cultural Background
By the late 1920s, the cotton market had collapsed, and Rusk County farmers largely abandoned its
cultivation. Nevertheless, they had to continue to pay taxes on relatively unproductive tracts of
land. As a matter of necessity brought on by the declining cotton market, continued taxation, and
the effects of the Great Depression, many farmers either lost their land or were forced to adopt
more self-sustaining agricultural practices, which included production of smaller crops of
vegetables, fruits, and grains. Additionally, portions of Rusk County benefited greatly from the oil
boom of the 1930s, including the vicinity around site 41RK322. The first oil exploration in the
county actually occurred at Millville in 1911, though those efforts were unsuccessful (Biesele 2012).

The history of the small farming community of Oak Hill adjacent to site 41RK322 reflects many of
the significant historic trends common in Rusk County. Prior to the twentieth century, the area was
populated by a combination of white and African American landowners and tenants who farmed
small parcels of land averaging less than 100 acres. Most grew cotton, and though they could
process it in Millville, they had to travel to Henderson in order to bring their crops to market.
During the market crash of the 1910s and 1920s, many families began to abandon their farms,
including those in the immediate project vicinity and the historic parcel containing site 41RK322.
During this period, large landowners bought up the property at reduced costs and converted the
former farmsteads into ranchland. These landowners then benefitted from the discovery of
minerals on the property during the twentieth century in lieu of those who had historically resided
in the area. The specific property history of the tract containing site 41RK322 illustrates these
patterns at an individual level.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
PREHISTORIC SITES
The primary research objective for the prehistoric sites (41RK375 and 41RK414) was to assess
their data potential and determine if they warrant inclusion in the NRHP. Research focused on
determining whether isolable and interpretable components, with intact cultural features with
datable subsistence or fuel remains, were present. Secondary research objectives included 1)
characterizing the nature of the occupations represented, and 2) refining our understanding of
their cultural affiliation and how they fit within the context of regional settlement patterns.
Specific research questions included the following:

1) Are intact cultural features associated with subsistence processing, such as hearths, storage pits,
and extramural work areas present? These investigations identified only one cultural feature,
Feature 1, at 41RK375. Upon exposure in Trench A3, Feature 1 appeared to represent a
disarticulated burned rock hearth. No organic staining or charcoal was found in association
with the feature.
2) Have architectural features, such as postholes or interior hearths, been preserved? Mechanical
trenching and scraping were used in an attempt to locate features at 41RK375. No postholes,
pits, or interior hearths were identified.

3) Does the site represent one or more components? Based on the recovery of a Gary dart point base
and a Pontchartrain dart point as was well as a Friley arrow point and an assemblage of ceramic
sherds at 41RK375 during previous survey (Skokan et al. 1997), the site was thought to have
resulted from at least two separate occupations, one during the Middle to Transitional Archaic
and one during the Late Prehistoric period. During testing, a Gary dart point and a Gary dart
point base were recovered, along with one Friley arrow point and an assemblage of Middle
Caddo ceramics, potentially representing three separate components, one during the Middle to
Transitional Archaic, one during the Early Ceramic to Early Caddo period, and one during the
latter part of the Middle Caddo period. Radiocarbon analysis of materials that presumably
represent subsistence, a burned black walnut nutshell and a burned hickory nutshell, returned
2-sigma calibrated dates ranging from A.D. 1020 to 1160 and A.D. 1430 to 1480, respectively.
These dates are generally consistent with the latter two possible components. Based on the
distribution of cultural materials on-site, however, it was not possible to isolate any of the
components.

Atkins 100027188/120124

37

Sites 41RK322, 41RK375, and 41RK414
4) Can the function of the identified site components be determined? Site 41RK375 is thought to
have resulted, in part, from short-duration occupations sometime during the Middle to
Transitional Archaic period and sometime during the Early Ceramic to Early Caddo periods.
These short-duration occupations may have been geared towards subsistence processing or
extractive activities. Site 41RK375 is also thought to have resulted in part from a residential
occupation during the Middle Caddo period. Site 41RK414 is represented only by a handful of
pieces of nondiagnostic lithic debitage widely distributed across a ridge summit that likely
resulted from multiple occupational episodes prior to the Late Prehistoric period.
5) Have the sites maintained behaviorally interpretable patterns of discard? Limited behaviorally
meaningful patterns of discard appear to have been preserved at both 41RK375 and 41RK414.
At 41RK375, a single artifact high density and diversity area was defined through shovel
testing. This area extended 50 m by 70 m with the long axis oriented southeast to northwest. It
was restricted to the topographically highest portion of the toeslope harboring the site and
yielded all of the ceramic artifacts as well as the majority of the lithic artifacts, and burned
nutshells recovered on-site. All of the potential components identified on-site appear to have
been restricted to this area.
A low-density and diffuse scatter of nondiagnostic lithic debitage was found during testing at
41RK414. This pattern is thought to have arisen through multiple short duration occupations
during the pre-Late Prehistoric period. Shovel testing failed, however, to isolate any activity
areas or components.

Research Topics

Cultural Affiliation
Testing sought to refine the cultural affiliation of each site. A variety of temporally sensitive
artifacts were recovered during testing at 41RK375. These materials include a Gary dart point, a
Gary dart point base, and a Friley arrow point, as well as an assemblage of Caddo ceramics,
dominated by brushed utility wares. Both Gary and Pontchartrain dart points date from the Middle
to Transitional Archaic, while Friley arrow points are thought to date to the Late Prehistoric, from
around A.D. 700 to 1100 (Turner and Hester 1993). Only a limited number of ceramic types were
recognized in the 41RK375 ceramic assemblage including Reavely Brushed Incised, Pease Brushed
Incised, possible Maydelle Incised, possible Killough Pinched utility wares, and possible Poyner
Engraved fine ware. Together, these sherds suggest occupation during the latter part of the Middle
Caddo period.
The presence of an Ellis dart point in the 41RK414 survey assemblage (Skokan et al. 1997)
indicates at least one occupation during the Middle to Transitional Archaic stage.

4. Research Design and Methods

Settlement/Subsistence
These investigations also sought to determine whether intact cultural features have been preserved
and whether they contain settlement/subsistence data. The preservation at both of the prehistoric
sites was generally poor. Although no intact cultural features were found, a single disarticulated
burned rock feature was identified at 41RK375. The only subsistence data obtained consisted of
burned nutshells recovered from shovel tests and units excavated at 41RK375.

Spatial Patterning

Research included an evaluation of the distribution of cultural materials on both sites. The
complete absence of cultural features at 41RK414 and the presence of only one cultural feature at
41RK375, however, limited the scope of spatial analysis. Although site 41RK375 appears to have
resulted from multiple occupational episodes, it was not possible to isolate any horizontally or
vertically. The diffuse nature of the lithic scatter at site 41RK414 suggests the site resulted from
multiple short-duration occupations. However, no artifact high density and diversity areas were
identified that could represent isolable components or activity areas.

Field Methods

A phased research strategy was used on the prehistoric sites, where the results of the primary
stages dictated the level of work conducted during the latter stages.

Positional Control

Positional control was maintained with a total station at site 41RK375. A site datum, two back sites,
and a 20-m grid were established with the total station. All shovel tests as well as hand and
mechanical excavation units were tied to the site grid with the total station. At sites 41RK322 and
41RK414, control grids were established using a hand-held sighting compass and 60-m tape. Due to
the low density of cultural materials on these sites, as well as the dense vegetation on half of site
41RK414, positional control was maintained with a hand-held Trimble GeoXT GPS unit accurate to
2 m.

Shovel Testing

Sites 41RK375 and 41RK414 were shovel tested in two phases. During the first, shovel tests were
excavated at 20-m grid intercepts in an effort to identify potential artifact high density and diversity
areas.
During the second phase, shovel tests were excavated at 10-m grid intercepts to define the limits of
potential artifact high density and diversity areas. Site 41RK322 was excavated at 10-m grid
intercepts.

Sites 41RK322, 41RK375, and 41RK414

Magnetometer
A magnetometer survey was conducted at site 41RK375 to identify magnetic anomalies potentially
associated with cultural features. The magnetometer survey was limited to the portion of the site
that is presently within an open pasture. The area chosen for the magnetometer survey was based
on the results of the preceding shovel testing phase, and encompassed nearly all of the site area
where positive shovel tests were excavated. This survey identified both dipolar and complex
magnetic anomalies. Only one anomaly was shown, through mechanical excavation, to be
associated with a prehistoric burned rock feature.

Mechanical Excavation

The artifact high density and diversity area defined through shovel testing at 41RK375 was
sampled with nine backhoe trenches and two mechanically scraped areas, spaced roughly at 20 m
intervals. The location of mechanical excavation units was guided by the results of shovel testing
and the magnetometer survey.

The soil on site 41RK375 was a deep fine sandy loam that generally extended to 60 cm or more. Due
to the soil depth, scraped areas were used only to sample two complex circular magnetic anomalies.
Here, the wide blade of a small rubber-tracked trackhoe was used to scrape through the A horizon
and the upper portion of the E horizon. Once this was accomplished, the trench floor was cleaned
using sharpened garden hoes and hand trowels to search for subtle soil changes in texture and hue
that could represent postholes, pits, or hearths. After this, a deeper trench was excavated within the
wider trench using the narrow bucket on the trackhoe that had been equipped with a smooth blade,
in an effort to look for more-deeply buried features. The narrow bucket was also used to excavate
trenches to expose dipolar magnetic anomalies as well as to sample the artifact high density and
diversity area. Feature 1, a disarticulated burned rock feature associated with a magnetic anomaly,
was the only feature identified at 41RK375.

Only one backhoe trench was excavated at 41RK414, placed adjacent to the culturally densest
shovel test excavated on-site. No features were identified at 41RK414.

Hand-excavated Units

Two 1-x-1-m hand excavation units were excavated on site 41RK375 to sample the artifact high
density and diversity area.

LABORATORY METHODS

Artifact Analysis and Processing
All recovered cultural materials were returned to the Archeological Laboratory at Atkins for
processing, analysis, and preparation for curation. Nonorganic remains were washed, dried, and
Atkins 100027188/120124

4. Research Design and Methods
catalogued by provenience. The assemblage of lithic tools was examined under low-power
microscopy in order to identify patterns of use wear. Morphological characteristics of projectile
points were used to assess manufacturing techniques and identify cultural affiliation when possible.
The entire lithic assemblage, including tools and debitage, was classified into raw material
categories.

Ceramic artifacts can provide important clues to cultural affiliation. To this end, the variability in
physical characteristics was analyzed. Important attributes include paste characteristics, oxidation
patterns, surface treatments, sherd thickness, vessel part, shape, and decoration. All sherds larger
than 2 cm were analyzed. Where possible, sherds were classified according to established types
based on decorative technique.
Ground and battered stone tools were assigned to specific analytical categories on the basis of
several key variables: the mechanical processes, the outcome of those processes, and the material
being processed. Microscopic examination of each tool aided in the identification of the key
mechanical processes and the subsequent wear patterns still visible on the tool. Because any
specific tool can be used in a range of activities, multifunctional tools were categorized on the basis
of the predominant type of wear still visible on the tool.

Curation

All temporally diagnostic prehistoric artifacts will be curated. The planned curation facility is the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory. A representative sample of burned rocks will also be
curated from the single burned rock feature identified. Nondiagnostic lithic debitage will not be
curated. All subsistence remains not submitted for radiocarbon analysis will be curated. Historic
artifacts will not be curated.

SPECIAL STUDIES

Ceramic Petrography
Once the ceramic analysis was complete, four ceramic sherds were chosen for ceramic petrography
and instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA). Ceramic petrography offers a replicable,
quantifiable approach for initial identification of ceramic paste composition. Point counting and
grain-size measurements from ceramic thin sections were used to draw objective distinctions
among pastes and establish paste classes. The analysis is designed to count 200 points, a number
determined to statistically represent all elements present in a sample. Grain size is determined by
measuring a number of nonplastic inclusions at their maximum width. General grain-size
characteristics are identified based upon the range, mode, and mean of each sample in relationship
to the Wentworth Size Scale. The general shape of the inclusions in the samples is based upon
categories of roundness and sphericity presented in Folk (1980).

Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis
The four sherds chosen for petrographic analysis were also subjected to INAA, which is a highly
sensitive analytical technique useful for performing both qualitative and quantitative multielement
analysis of major, minor, and trace elements in archeological samples. Samples are irradiated with
thermal neutrons in a nuclear reactor. Neutrons are absorbed in the nuclei of constituent atoms,
and these atoms emit radiation with energy and quantity unique to each particular element.
Analysis of the spectrum of gamma rays emitted by the sample allows a determination of the
sample’s elemental composition.

INAA can be used to characterize the elemental composition of prehistoric ceramic pastes and draw
conclusions regarding intensity and location of resource procurement and production loci and
spheres of trade and regional exchange. Although it is most commonly applied archeologically to
ceramic artifacts, it is also applicable to lithic artifacts or osteological remains. Atkins utilized the
services of the Archaeometry Laboratory at the University of Missouri Research Reactor, Columbia,
Missouri, for INAA.

Radiocarbon Dating

Two burned nutshells recovered from 41RK375 were subjected to radiocarbon analysis. These
samples were chosen because they came from the culturally richest part of the site and were
presumed to represent subsistence remains. These samples were not, however, recovered from
intact cultural features.

Establishing an absolute chronology for an archeological site is of fundamental importance and
plays a key role in cultural resource investigations. Radiometric assays provide the most readily
accessible means of establishing chronological control for a site and can also aid in interpreting
depositional environments in a variety of settings.

Radiocarbon dating is based on the formation of a radioactive isotope, 14C, by the reaction of cosmic
ray secondary neutrons with nitrogen in the atmosphere. The 14C combines with oxygen to form
radioactive carbon dioxide, which is absorbed by living plants and transported eventually to
animals. The organisms have the same radiocarbon content as the atmosphere for the duration of
their lives. After death, however, they lose 14C by radioactive decay, the depletion of radiocarbon
following the laws of physics. By comparing the precisely measured 14C in materials of unknown
age with that of a modern standard, the ages of the unknowns can be calculated.

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH METHODS

Historic site 41RK322 was originally located in 1997 during a survey within the Oak Hill Mine
(Skokan et al. 1997). During coordination for the associated report, THC staff indicated that
additional archival research was required for the site. It is located within an area characterized by
Atkins 100027188/120124

early Anglo American settlement and is within a historic land survey patented by John Walling, a
pioneer Texas settler. The site is also located near a historic crossroads regularly traversed by
historic settlers during the Republic and Early Statehood eras approximately 1 mile from the
historic community of Millville, which was originally settled in the 1840s. The present research thus
sought to determine who occupied the property during the historic period, whether they may have
been significant to local development patterns, and whether the site may have constituted the
homestead of John Walling during the antebellum period.

The project historian fulfilled these requirements through primary source research into the
associated parcel’s history. Specifically, the historian conducted deed, probate, and vital records
(birth, death, marriage, etc.) research at the Rusk County Courthouse in Henderson, Texas,
completed ad valorem tax research at the Texas State Library in Austin for the time periods
suggested by the deed and archeological record, and consulted population census schedules for
Texas and Rusk County. The tax research was generally conducted in 5-year increments with some
year-by-year analysis when necessary to determine property acquisition or improvement
information. Historians also conducted limited secondary research using previous archeological
and historical studies of the area to determine whether historic owners/occupants of the property
were significant to local or regional history and to identify important historic development patterns
and themes. Finally, historians used all of the materials gathered during this effort to develop a sitespecific history detailing the property’s historic owners and potential occupants as well as
evaluating their historic significance and whether the site was associated with any significant
historic themes.
In general, the archival research provided evidence that the parcel containing site 41RK322 was
likely associated with a domestic occupation of the property by the Sarah Vansickle and W.H.
Williams family during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Though archival evidence
suggests that enslaved persons and later freedmen may have resided in the vicinity, there is no
evidence that the subject site maintains any associations with historic African American residents
of the area. The site is also located in close proximity to the community of Oak Hill. Nevertheless,
there is no evidence that the site was related to development in that community, and Oak Hill,
which developed during the early twentieth century, postdates the period of significance for early
Anglo and African American settlement in the region as a whole. In addition to its lack of
association with important themes or groups, the project historian uncovered no evidence that the
Vansickle/Williams family was significant at the local or regional level.

SITE 41RK322
SETTING
Site 41RK322 is an ephemeral historic artifact scatter located on a ridge summit at an approximate
elevation of 490 feet (ft) above mean sea level (msl) (see Figure 1). The nearest source of water is
an unnamed intermittent tributary to Mill Creek, about 200 m to the northwest. The soil on-site is
Redsprings gravelly fine sandy loam, 2 to 5 percent slopes (Griffith 2000). The site is in a pasture,
and tall dense grass completely obscured ground surface visibility (Figure 5). The site is located in
the historic community of Oak Hill but appears to predate it.

Figure 5. Site 41RK322, overview facing north-northwest
The soil encountered in shovel tests excavated during the present investigation consisted of a dark
reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) gravelly fine sandy loam A horizon underlain by a dark reddish brown
(2.5YR 3/4) sandy clay Bt horizon. The A horizon was shallow within the highest elevated portion
Atkins 100027188/120124

45

Sites 41RK322, 41RK375, and 41RK414
of the landform and extended in depth between 2 and 5 cm below the ground surface. On the slope
just below the summit, the A horizon was deeper and extended up to 30 cm in depth. This pattern
likely resulted in part from the downslope movement of sediments.

BACKGROUND AND PREVIOUS INVESTIGATION

Site 41RK322 was located during previous survey within the Oak Hill Mine (Skokan et at. 1997).
During that visit, 10 shovel tests were excavated on-site, of which 2 were culturally positive and
yielded two sherds of hand-painted whiteware. One sherd had a purple-colored, hand-painted
design while the second had a cobalt blue floral pattern. Both artifacts were recovered from Level 1
(0–10 centimeters below surface [cmbs]).

POSITIONAL CONTROL

During the present investigation, a 10-m shovel test grid was established on-site with a 30-m tape
and a hand-held sighting compass. The positions of each shovel test were acquired using a Trimble
GeoXT GPS device that is typically accurate to within 2 m with post processing.

SHOVEL TESTING

Initially a single transect of shovel tests was excavated north to south across the ridge summit
harboring the site, roughly bisecting the landform (Figure 6). Following this, additional shovel tests
were excavated at 10-m grid intercepts around positive shovel tests. A total of 19 shovel tests were
excavated to assess the distribution of cultural materials on-site. Two shovel tests were culturally
positive, yielding a total of three historic ceramic sherds (Table 1).

ARTIFACT ASSEMBLAGE ANALYSIS
The artifact assemblage recovered from site 41RK322 during testing comprises three historic
ceramic sherds—two undecorated ironstone sherds and one salt-glazed stoneware sherd.

Atkins 100027188/120124

Sites 41RK322, 41RK375, and 41RK414
Undecorated ironstone became common after 1840 and remained so until around 1930 (Hume
1970). Both ironstone sherds were likely lead glazed and are crazed. Salt-glazed ceramics are not
particularly temporally sensitive. They were most popular during the period 1850–1900 (Greer
1981) and remain in production today.

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH
Property History

Site 41RK322 is located within the 3,354-acre Ezekiel Young Survey (Texas General Land Office
Records, Rusk County Abstract #879) near the community of Oak Hill in northeastern Rusk County.
Though the survey containing the site was occupied during the mid-nineteenth century, archival
research suggests that the site itself was likely associated with occupation or use of the land by the
Vansickle/Williams and Hedge families and/or their tenants during the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries. Neither family maintains known historic associations with important trends or
events in Rusk County history nor does the site itself appear to have any associations with
important historic themes identified for the surrounding vicinity, including pioneer Texas
settlement, plantation-era development, or African American history and settlement patterns.

The E.C. Young Survey was patented by pioneer Texas settler John Walling on November 3, 1848,
and early deed records suggest he lived on the survey briefly during the mid-nineteenth century.
The Walling brothers, including Jesse, John, and Thomas Jefferson, arrived in Texas prior to the
Texas Revolution and all served in the Texas Army during the conflict. After the war, the brothers
moved to Rusk County, and Jesse and John settled on their holdings near the community of Millville
(see Figure 4). The former community, located approximately 1 mile southwest of site 41RK322
along what was historically referred to as the Chickenfeather Road, was originally known as Liberty
Hill. A post office was established there as Walling’s Mill in 1847, though the town was not officially
laid out until 1853 when Enoch Hays and Willis Calloway constructed a water-powered mill there
(Biesele 2012a; Foster and Rogers 2000:17).

The community was located along several major communication and travel routes and thrived
during the antebellum period. It served as a “division point for couriers of messages from Jefferson
to Rusk” during its early years and was situated along what was known as the “Wire Road.” The Red
River Telegraph Company constructed Texas’s first telegraph line down this road. Additionally, the
community was a stop on the stagecoach route between Marshall and San Antonio. As a result, by
the time of the Civil War, the community was surrounded by thriving farmsteads and boasted a
carding factory, “a woodshop or furniture manufactory, a shoe shop and tanning yard, a school, and
a Masonic Lodge” (Biesele 2012a; Foster and Rogers 2000:19). The tannery and wool carding
factory are both depicted on an 1863 map of the area (Figure 7), and the school, known as the
Millville Male and Female Academy, was “the largest boarding school in the South” for the brief
Atkins 100027188/120124

48

Sites 41RK322, 41RK375, and 41RK414
period it was open between 1858 and its closure in 1861 at the outbreak of the Civil War (Biesele
2012b; Von Rosenberg 1863).

In addition to his affiliation with Millville through his brother Jesse, John Walling also constructed
and operated a ferry along the Sabine River on the road from Henderson to Marshall. He applied for
and received his ferry bond in 1844 (Rusk County Deed Records A:72), and many settlers during
the early Republic era migrating into Texas along Trammell’s Trace would have made use of the
facility (see Figure 3).
The Wallings were also involved in land speculation in the region, and though several volumes of
the early Rusk County deed records were lost in a fire, surviving tax records indicate that Walling
began to partition his holdings in the Young Survey prior to receiving official title to the property in
1848. In that year, he rendered taxes on 1,000 acres in the Ezekiel Young Survey valued at $2,000.
He also owned 5 horses, 35 cattle, and paid taxes on one enslaved person. Walling held 7,273.1
acres by title only 4 years earlier, suggesting he was actively acquiring and conveying land during
the period.

In 1857, Walling conveyed 1,349.16 acres in the Young and adjacent William Frisby surveys to
Philip Alston of Houston County. The conveyance described the property as a “piece of land” located
1 mile northeast of the community of Millville and indicated that John Walling and his wife Rhoda
had being residing there “for the past few years.” The transfer was witnessed by his brother Jesse
(Rusk County Deed Records H:627), and the Wallings had relocated to Limestone County by 1860
according to contemporary census records. Though it is unclear whether the subject parcel was
part of the homestead tract Walling conveyed to Alston in 1857, there is no evidence that site
41RK322 represents evidence of his occupation there.

Tax evidence indicates that the Young Survey was partitioned among a mix of absentee white
landowners, primarily during the antebellum period, with portions later conveyed to African
American landowners during the postbellum period. An individual named James Bell who worked
as an “overseer” in 1850 also owned a large tract in the survey from as early as 1848 through the
first decade of the twentieth century, suggesting that absentee owners like Phillip Alston and
Walling himself may have used enslaved labor to work the land despite their residence outside of
the county. An 1863 map of the vicinity (Von Rosenberg 1863) depicts agricultural fields and the
farm of an individual identified as “Johnson” in the vicinity of site 41RK322. The farm is situated
along the Marshall Road northeast of Millville (Figure 8). The project historian did not encounter
any individuals named Johnson who owned land in the Young Survey in contemporary tax records;
however, the review of tax records from the period was not exhaustive.
In the years immediately following the Civil War, census records indicate that the larger community
associated with the current project area was occupied by a mix of Anglo and African American

Atkins 100027188/120124

50

Sites 41RK322, 41RK375, and 41RK414
residents. This pattern continued into the twentieth century, and deed records indicate that several
African American landowners, including Charles Walling and Jack Blair, acquired large parcels in
the Young Survey during the 1870s. Though some of these tracts were likely located in the vicinity
of the parcel containing 41RK322, review of tax data suggests the subject parcel was never owned
by a freedman.

Though year-by-year tax review was beyond the scope of the project, Mrs. S.E. Vansickle owned the
154-acre tract containing site 41RK322 by 1890. Genealogy and census research indicates Mrs.
Vansickle was the widow of Anderson King Vansickle who reportedly died in 1875 when “a tree fell
on him while clearing land” (Shockley 2010; Memorial #55549785). It is possible that he was
clearing the subject tract as census records indicate Mrs. Vansickle was living in the project vicinity
by 1880.
The couple first appears in Rusk County census records in 1870 when A.K. Vansickle (22) headed a
household containing his wife S.E. (21) and their young son W.A. (1). The family lived in Precinct 4
in the Henderson Post Office District, though the record does not indicate whether or not they
owned their property at this time. By 1880, Sarah Vansickle (31) and her young children W. (9),
Benj. (8), and Virgil (5) resided in their own household in Precinct 3 near Sarah’s mother-in-law
Mary Vansickle, who was also a widow. Precinct 3 historically included the current project area,
though once again the record does not indicate whether Sarah owned her property at this time.
Sarah Vansickle appears in the 1890 Rusk County tax rolls as the owner of 154 acres in the E.C.
Young Survey valued at $460. As this was her only property, she likely resided on the tract at the
time. In addition, she owned a wagon ($40), 1 horse/mule ($75), and 4 cattle ($20). In total, her
estate was valued at $635. She had sold some of the property by 1901 when she rendered taxes on
122 acres valued at $570.

Contemporary census records suggest she and her sons lived on the property at this time. In 1900,
her son Benjamin Vansickle (28) headed a household containing his mother Sarah E. (51), his
grandfather Anderson W. Smith (85), and his cousin Minnie Webb (15). Sarah’s son William and his
family lived two households away, and the group lived near known Young Survey property owners
Charles Price, Richard Sorgee, and Luther Evans. All of these individuals rendered taxes on property
in the Young Survey the following year.
Sarah Vansickle remarried sometime before 1910, and census and cemetery inventory records
indicate that her new husband W.H. Williams may have been related to her by marriage, possibly
even her brother-in-law. In 1900, William H. Williams appeared as a widower in Justice Precinct 3
of Rusk County with his nephew Hubbard R. Smith (22), niece Minnie Smith (15), and an individual
named Mattie Featherwood (39) whose relationship to the family was not specified. He owned his
own home, and cemetery inventory records indicate that his wife Virginia had died earlier that year
and was buried in the nearby Millville Cemetery (Wiseman 2010; Memorial #54246292).
Atkins 100027188/120124

52

5. Site 41RK322
Tax records suggest that Sarah Vansickle and W.H. Williams married between 1901 and 1902. This
date would correlate with the transfer of the subject tract, now 114 acres, to W.H. Williams and
with Sarah Vansickle’s disappearance from the tax rolls. In 1901, W.H. Williams only owned a 154acre tract in the nearby Dolores Solis Survey (Abstract 698) (see Figure 2). By 1902, he was
rendering taxes on the Solis parcel as well as 114 acres in the Young Survey. It was valued at $570,
significantly higher than the $300 attributed to his 154-acre tract in the Solis Survey.

Subsequent conveyances and census records suggest that the couple may have moved into Sarah
Vansickle’s established home on the subject property at the time of their marriage. By 1903,
Williams had sold half of his holdings in the Solis Survey, and the remaining 79 acres were valued at
$200. In contrast, the value of the 114-acre tract had remained steady at $570. The following year,
Williams rendered taxes on 114 acres in the Young Survey ($570), 75 acres in the Solis Survey
($150), and 4 acres in the J.T. Bean Survey ($10). In 1910, census records describe the couple as
residing on the Longview Road. Site 41RK322 is located at the intersection of FM 1716, which leads
to Longview, and Highway 782, suggesting they may have been residing on the subject parcel at this
time. The record identifies William as “Howard” (64), and he lived with Sarah (61) near her son
Willie Vansickle and another possible relative, Dr. Albert O.L. Smith.

The couple retained the 114-acre tract until September 13, 1919. On that date, W.H. and Sarah
Williams sold the parcel to C.H. Hedge for $6,270 cash. The property was described as bounded by
the Longview and Concord Road and the Henderson and Marshall Road (Rusk County Deed Records
100:394). Deed records suggest Hedge was one of the founders of the community of Oak Hill that
emerged at this intersection during the early twentieth century. In addition to operating the local
cotton gin (Rusk County Deed Records 115:439), he also donated land for church facilities. The Oak
Hill community supplanted Millville and another nearby community of Motley, both of which were
bypassed by the railroad during the late nineteenth century. Hedge purchased several adjacent
parcels around the same period, though his probate record indicates his homestead was on the J.
Terrell Survey (see Figure 2) (Rusk County Probate Case #4139).

Despite his obvious accumulation of wealth as demonstrated by review of twentieth century deed
records, Collie Hedge had more humble beginnings. In 1900, 19-year-old Collie Hedge lived with his
brother Martin (18) in a rented home in the project vicinity near their father Samuel Hedge (48). He
owned his own farm by 1910 when he lived with his wife Mary (28) and their children Talley H. (8),
Prentis [sic] (7), Raymon [sic] (5), Garland (4), Ellen (19 months), and Myrtle (9 months) in Precinct
3 of Rusk County near several known owners of land in the project vicinity. They still lived in the
area in 1920 and 1930.
Subsequent deed records indicate the subject 114-acre tract became part of a larger property used
for agricultural purposes by the Hedge family during the mid-twentieth century. Though the larger
276.667-acre tract is located in close proximity to the community of Oak Hill, it does not appear to
have been associated with development there or to have been included within the community
Atkins 100027188/120124

53

Sites 41RK322, 41RK375, and 41RK414
proper. In fact, partition deeds related to the property from the 1950s after the death of C.H. Hedge
do not reference any improvements on the tract nor was it the family’s homestead (Rusk County
Deed Records 525:31; Rusk County Probate Case #4139). As no structures are depicted in the
vicinity of site 41RK322 or on the associated tract on the U.S. Geological Survey 1958 topographic
map of the area, any occupation at that location likely occurred during the property’s association
with earlier owners, namely the Vansickle/Williams family.

SUMMARY

Though historic map and deed evidence suggests the vicinity surrounding site 41RK322 was
occupied as early as the 1840s and may have been home to a freedmens’ community during the late
nineteenth century, there is no archival evidence that the site maintains any associations with such
an occupation. Instead, it was likely associated with occupation or use of the land by the
Vansickle/Williams family during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, and there is no
evidence that they were significant to local or regional development. After the property’s purchase
by C.H. Hedge in 1919, it appears to have been used for agricultural purposes through the midtwentieth century. As a result, the site does not maintain any known historic associations that
would qualify it for NRHP listing under Criterion A or B.

The archeological deposits at site 41RK322 also do not appear to qualify for NRHP listing. Site
41RK322 is an ephemeral historic ceramic artifact scatter consistent with a short-duration
residential occupation dating to the late nineteenth to early twentieth century. Shovel testing
yielded a total of three artifacts. No artifact high density and diversity areas were identified.
Consequently, the site was not sampled with hand-excavated units or mechanically excavated
trenches. The landform harboring the site has shallow eroded soils that are unlikely to harbor
intact and interpretable archeological deposits that could warrant NRHP inclusion under Criterion
D. For the above reasons, no further investigation of site 41RK322 is warranted or recommended.

SITE 41RK375
SETTING
Site 41RK375 is located on a slight rise above the floodplain of Tiawichi Creek at an approximate
elevation of 310 ft msl. An unnamed tributary to the creek is about 75 m to the west of the site
while the main channel is about 225 m to the north. Two soils are mapped in the vicinity of the site,
Bienville loamy fine sand, 0 to 2 percent slopes and Laneville loam, frequently flooded (Griffith
2000). The deep sandy soil on the floodplain rise is more consistent with the former soil type than
the latter. The loamy soil downslope from the rise, however, was more consistent with Laneville
loam. These lower areas were less well drained and retained surface water for a week after a big
rain at the beginning of the project. Bienville soils formed from sandy alluvium of late Pleistocene
age and are very deep, somewhat excessively drained, sandy, and siliceous. Bienville soils are
strongly acid to slightly acid in the A and E horizons.

The soil exposed in backhoe trenches excavated during the present investigation typically exhibited
an A/E/Bt profile. The A horizon is a dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) fine sandy loam that
extends between 10 and 30 cmbs. The E horizon was a slightly lighter yellowish brown (10YR 5/6)
to brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) sandy loam that often extended to more than a meter deep. The E
horizon was usually divided into subhorizons based on color. The Bt horizon generally consisted of
a brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) to yellowish red (5YR 5/6) sandy clay. In some locations the Bt
horizon consisted of a brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) coarse sand and gravel.
Slightly more than half of the site is in a pasture and vegetated with dense grasses that revealed no
ground surface visibility, other than occasional gopher spoil piles (Figure 9). The remainder of the
site is in a mixed pine/hardwood woods, where ground surface visibility was nonexistent due to
pine duff, leaf litter, and a dense brushy understory.

BACKGROUND AND PREVIOUS INVESTIGATION

Site 41RK375 was first recorded during previous survey within the mine (Skokan et al. 1997). The
site was originally identified by the presence of lithic debitage on the ground surface. An intensive
surface inspection and 44 shovel tests were conducted to determine the site’s boundaries. The
surface inspection yielded one Gary dart point base formed from hematite and one silicified wood
flake. Nine shovel tests were culturally positive and yielded 2 undecorated sherds, 2 undecorated
sherdlets, 4 brushed sherds, 3 pieces of chert debitage, 1 piece of hematite debitage, 2 pieces of
Atkins 100027188/120124

Sites 41RK322, 41RK375, and 41RK414
quartzite debitage, 2 pieces of silicified wood debitage, 1 quartzite core, 1 quartzite Friley arrow
point. In addition, 1 silicified wood Pontchartrain dart point was recovered from an isolated
positive shovel test on a very slight floodplain rise, surrounded by low wet areas, approximately 80
m to the east of the remainder of the site.

Figure 9. Site 41RK375, overview facing north-northeast

POSITIONAL CONTROL
A datum was established on roughly the highest elevated part of the landform harboring the site
and arbitrarily assigned grid coordinates North 100, East 100, and Elevation 100. Positional control
was maintained with a total station, which was used to acquire the position of all shovel tests, handexcavation units, and trenches.

SHOVEL TESTING

Shovel testing was undertaken during two phases. During the first phase, 38 shovel tests were
excavated at 20-m grid intercepts across the site to identify potential artifact high density and
diversity areas (Figure 10). A total of 15 shovel tests excavated during the first phase yielded
cultural materials consisting of 8 pieces of lithic debitage, 15 ceramic sherds, 5.52 grams (g) of
charcoal, and 0.22 g of burned nutshell. Ceramic sherds were recovered from five shovel tests (3,

Sites 41RK322, 41RK375, and 41RK414

18, 19, 27, and 28) excavated during the first phase of shovel testing. Lithic debitage was recovered
from seven shovel tests (2, 3, 5, 10, 14, 20, and 29) excavated during this phase, while charcoal was
recovered from five (6, 11, 21, 28, and 38) and burned nutshell was recovered from 1 (11).

The total number of different types of cultural materials (lithic artifacts, ceramic sherds, and
charcoal) recovered from each shovel test was used as a measure of diversity. Two shovel tests (3
and 28) had diversity indices of two. All other positive shovel tests excavated during the first phase
of shovel testing had diversity indices of 1. Between 1 and 8 total artifacts were recovered from
each shovel that yielded artifacts, with an average of 2.09 and a standard deviation of 2.07. Only
shovel test (19) had a total artifact yield greater than one standard deviation above the mean. These
patterns suggested the possible presence of an artifact high density and diversity area between
shovel tests 3, 19, and 28.
During the second phase of shovel testing, an additional 24 tests were excavated at 10-m grid
intercepts around the five shovel tests that yielded ceramic artifacts. Of these shovel tests, 10 were
culturally positive and yielded 12 pieces of lithic debitage, 18 ceramic sherds, 0.72 g of charcoal,
and 1.02 g of burned nutshell.

Horizontal Distribution of Cultural Materials

Lithic debitage and ceramic sherds were, by far, the most common classes of cultural materials
recovered on-site (Figure 11). For this reason, the distribution of these materials across the site is
thought to best reflect the natural and cultural processes that resulted in the current expression of
the archeological record. Charcoal and burned nutshells were recovered in low quantities in only a
few shovel tests, and the behavioral implications of their distribution remains ambiguous. Between
1 and 8 artifacts (ceramic sherds and lithic debitage) were recovered from each shovel test positive
for this class of material, with an average of 2.52 and a standard deviation of 2.09. Only three shovel
tests (19, 48, and 49) had artifact yields greater than one standard deviation above the mean. These
shovel tests were confined to a roughly 30-m-diameter circular area located in the middle of the
flattest portion of the toeslope harboring the site.
Ceramic artifacts were recovered from 13 shovel tests confined to an area that extends roughly 30
m by 65 m (see Figure 11), with the long axis oriented southeast to northwest. This area generally
follows the contours of the toeslope and covers an area of roughly 1,400 m2, situated on the flattest
elevated portion of the landform. The rate of sherd recovery in these tests ranged between 1 and 8,
with an average of 2.54 and a standard deviation of 2.33. Only two shovel tests (19 and 48) had
artifact recovery rates greater than one standard deviation above the mean.
Lithic artifacts were recovered from 14 shovel tests that were more widely distributed across the
site than tests positive for ceramics. Between 1 and 3 lithic artifacts were recovered from each
shovel test positive for this material class. The four highest yielding shovel tests (5, 49, 51, and 52),

Atkins 100027188/120124

6. Site 41RK375
those that contained two or three lithic artifacts, were limited to the flattest portion of the toeslope
harboring the site and restricted to an area that could be contained within a 30-m-diameter circle.
Shovel tests positive for single pieces of lithic debitage were generally located along the highest
elevated portion of the toeslope harboring the site.

Charcoal was recovered from only three shovel tests (21, 38, and 51). The vast majority of the
charcoal recovered through shovel testing came from shovel test 21, located at the northern extent
of the site. The facts that (1) the charcoal recovered from shovel test 21 represents the only cultural
material recovered from the test and (2) evidence of recent burning was found nearby to the north
of the test suggest the charcoal recovered from shovel test 21 does not represent the Caddo
occupation of the site. Burned nutshells were recovered from two shovel tests (11 and 51). The fact
that shovel test 51 was located within the culturally densest portion of the site and yielded both
ceramic sherds and lithic debitage suggests the burned nutshell recovered from it does indeed
represent the Caddo occupation. The origins of the burned nutshell recovered from shovel test 11,
which was located downslope and away from the majority of the cultural materials recovered onsite, remain ambiguous.
Based on the patterned horizontal distribution of lithic debitage and ceramic sherds, the most
intensively utilized portion of the site is limited to the flattest elevated portion of the site from
where both ceramic and lithic artifacts were recovered in shovel tests.

Vertical Distribution of Cultural Materials

Deep fine sandy loam was encountered in most of the shovel tests excavated on-site. Of the 64
shovel tests excavated on-site, the Bt horizon was encountered in 22 at an average depth of
70 cmbs. Forty-two shovel tests were terminated before reaching the Bt horizon. Of these tests, 32
were terminated within the E horizon at an average depth of 97 cmbs. The water table was
encountered in the remaining 10 shovel tests at an average depth of 75 cmbs. The shovel tests with
the deepest sands were generally restricted to the highest elevated portion of the toeslope
harboring the site. This part of the site also yielded the highest concentrations of artifacts. The
shallowest shovel tests were located downslope from the toe summit in the floodplain of Tiawichi
Creek.
Ceramic and lithic artifacts were unevenly distributed throughout the vertical column from 0 to 90
cmbs. These materials were recovered in the greatest frequencies from the first 30 cmbs, from
where more than 50 percent of the shovel testing sherd and lithic assemblages were recovered
(Table 2). Below this, artifacts were more or less evenly distributed. A peak in the recovery rate of
ceramic artifacts did occur in Level 5, from where a quarter of the shovel testing sherd assemblage
was recovered. These patterns suggest that the first three 10-cm levels below ground surface can
be considered an occupation zone. The concentration of cultural materials near the current ground
surface suggests further that the site has not aggraded since its prehistoric abandonment. The

artifacts recovered from below the occupation zone presumably migrated downward after entering
the archeological record as a result of postdepositional natural and cultural turbative processes.

MAGNETOMETER SURVEY
Past studies at prehistoric sites have demonstrated the effectiveness of using magnetometers to
locate hearth features (Rogers 1995a, 1995b, 1999, 2000; Sherman et al. 2007). The technique
constitutes an efficient, nondestructive method of locating buried rock hearth features, as the rock
types comprising these features (hematite, sandstone, and petrified wood) are often highly
magnetic.

Atkins used a Geometrics, Inc. G-858 Magmapper to provide continuous magnetic surveying and
automatic data logging. The G-858 automatically stores and outputs each sensor reading and the
difference between the two sensor readings. In continuous mode, the G-858 can record data at
0.10-second intervals and store readings and positions sequentially with a time stamp. The
gradiometer mode automatically removes the regional gradient and increases the resolution of
local anomalies. Grid spacing, or the distance between adjacent magnetometer transects, was 0.5 m.
The magnetometer survey was conducted within a controlled metric grid. The size and orientation
of the grid was determined based on the shovel testing results.
At the completion of the magnetometer survey, the data stored internally was transferred to a
computer, and the resulting files were processed using MAGPAC software. The magnetometer files
were then exported from MAGPAC as ASCII files in a format compatible with SURFER, a terrainmodeling software package, and magnetic contour maps were produced.

Previous magnetometer surveys have proven successful at locating burned rock features at
41LT253, 41LT320, and 41LT347 (Sherman et al. 2007), 41RK468 (Dixon et al. 2008), and 41LT56
(Fischbeck et al. 2011). The anomalies associated with single burned rock features at these sites
have a range in declination from 41° west to 32.5° east, a maximum distance between poles of
2.4 m, an average anomaly amplitude of 81.2 nT, and generally a positive peak stronger than its
negative peak (a positive to negative nT ratio greater than 1).

Two varieties of magnetic anomalies thought to have the potential to have resulted from cultural
processes were identified (Figure 12). A total of 20 dipolar anomalies (Table 3), with the negative
pole to the north, and 5 complex anomalies (Table 4) were located. The dipolar anomalies have
negative poles with amplitudes ranging from −20 to −175 nT, and positive poles with amplitudes
ranging from 25 to 480. The ratio of the amplitude of the positive pole to the negative pole ranged
from 0.45 to 6. In 15 out of 20 cases, this ratio was greater than 1. The distance between the
positive and negative poles ranged from 0.2 m to 2.4 m. The declination ranged from 6.8° west to
27.8° east. A total of six dipolar anomalies were sampled with backhoe trenches. Only one anomaly
was shown to be associated with a cultural feature.

The five complex anomalies were made up of clusters of multiple smaller anomalies that occurred
in circular (n = 2) or linear (n = 3) patterns. These anomalies ranged in size from 21 m2 to 140 m2.
Both circular anomalies were sampled with mechanically scraped areas. The linear anomalies were
not sampled. Neither circular anomaly was shown to be associated with a cultural feature.

Six dipolar anomalies were sampled with backhoe trenches. The two complex circular anomalies
were sampled with mechanically scraped areas. The dipolar anomalies chosen for sampling share
the characteristics of anomalies shown to be associated with burned rock features. Only one burned
rock feature, however, was shown to be associated with any of the tested anomalies. The presence
of a barbed wire fence and evidence of modern ranching suggests the possibility that some of these
anomalies may have been associated with modern metal debris (presumably at or just below the
surface) or modern ground disturbing and/or burning episodes. These anomalies may also be the
result of the presence of large hematite sandstone cobbles, which are inherently magnetic. The
complex anomalies likely represent naturally occurring features, such as drainages.

MECHANICAL EXCAVATION

Mechanical excavation was used to sample magnetic anomalies located by the magnetometer
survey and the artifact high density area defined through shovel testing (Figure 13). Dipolar
magnetic anomalies, as well as the artifact high density and diversity area, were sampled with
backhoe trenches. Trenches A1, A2, A3, A7, A8, and A13 were excavated to sample dipolar magnetic
anomalies. Trenches 18, 19, and 49 were excavated to sample the artifact high density and diversity
area. The trench walls were cleaned with towels in an effort to identify cultural features. None were
identified.

6. Site 41RK375
Complex circular magnetic anomalies were sampled first with wide scraped areas and then with
narrow trenches excavated within the scraped areas. Scraped areas C3 and C4 were excavated to
sample complex circular anomalies. The wide blade on a small rubber-tracked trackhoe was used to
remove the A horizon and excavate into the E horizon, to roughly 40 cm in depth. Once this was
accomplished, sharpened garden hoes were used to clean the trench floor to look for subtle changes
in soil texture and hue that could represent post or pit features. None were located.
The origins of the majority of the magnetic anomalies sampled were not determined. Dipolar
anomaly A3 was shown, in backhoe trench A3, to be associated with a small cluster of burned rocks,
presumably representing a disarticulated prehistoric hearth.

Trench A1

Trench A1 was excavated to sample dipolar anomaly A1, which was located on the northern end of
the magnetometer survey area. The trench extended roughly 7 m east to west by 1 m north to
south. It was excavated to an average depth of 90 cm. No artifacts were recovered during
excavation of Trench A1. Four soil zones were identified in the north wall of the trench (Figure 14).
The A horizon extended from the ground surface to an average depth of 30 cmbs and was a 10YR
4/4 dark yellowish brown fine sandy loam that appeared disturbed. The lower boundary was wavy
and abrupt. This was underlain by a 10YR 5/6 yellowish brown fine sandy loam E1 horizon that
extended to an average depth of 70 cm. The lower boundary was wavy and clear. This was
underlain by a 10YR 6/6 brownish yellow sand E2 horizon that extended to an average depth of
80 cm. The lower boundary was wavy and clear. This was underlain by a 10YR 6/6 brownish yellow
mottled with 7.5YR 5/8 strong brown sandy clay Bt horizon that extended from the base of the
above to an unknown depth.

Trench A2

Trench A2 was excavated to sample dipolar anomaly A2, located about 10 m southwest of anomaly
A1. Trench A2 extended roughly 3 m east to west by 1 m north to south. It was excavated to an
average depth of 120 cmbs. One ceramic sherd was recovered during excavation of Trench A2. Four
soil zones were identified in the south wall (see Figure 14). The A horizon extended from the
ground surface to about 10 cm. The A horizon was discontinuous across the trench. It was a 10YR
4/4 dark yellowish brown fine sandy loam. The lower boundary was smooth and clear. The
underlying E1 horizon extended from the base of the above, or the ground surface, to an average
depth of 90 cm. The E1 was a 10YR 4/4 dark yellowish brown fine sandy loam with a wavy and
clear lower boundary. The underlying E2 horizon extended from the base of the above to an
average depth of 110 cm and was a 10YR 5/6 yellowish brown fine sandy loam. Its lower boundary
was smooth and clear. The underlying E3 horizon was a 10YR 6/6 brownish yellow coarse sand and
gravel that extended from the base of the above to an unknown depth.

Trench A3
Trench A3 was excavated to sample dipolar anomaly A3 and is located in the northeastern portion
of the magnetometer survey area. Trench A3 extended 5 m east to west by 1 m north to south.
Dipolar anomaly A3 was shown to be associated with Feature 1. Two pieces of thermally altered
rock (with a combined mass of 193.3 g) were recovered during excavation of Trench A3, prior to
the identification of Feature 1. Two soil zones were observed in the north wall of the trench (Figure
15). The A horizon was a 10YR 4/6 dark yellowish brown fine sandy loam that extended from the
ground surface to about 10 cmbs with a wavy and gradual lower boundary. The underlying E
horizon was a 10YR 5/6 yellowish brown fine sandy loam that extended from the base of the above
to an unknown depth.

Feature 1

Feature 1 was identified through sampling dipolar magnetic anomaly A3 (see Figure 12). The
feature consisted of a small concentration of burned hematitic sandstone rocks, resting on a level
plane, and contained within the E soil horizon, at roughly 40 cmbs (see Figure 15). A total of 28
feature rocks, with a total mass of 7,640 g, were exposed in the floor of the trench. An additional
three feature rocks remained in the north wall of the trench following excavation of the feature,
suggesting that a small portion of the feature extends north beyond the limits of the trench. The
feature rocks were found to be scattered within an area roughly 120 cm east-west by 80 cm northsouth. The feature rocks were encountered in a single layer at roughly the same elevation. No
organic staining was preserved in association with the feature. The origins of the feature remain
somewhat ambiguous. The feature rocks presumably represent the remains of a hearth or roasting
pit.

Trench A7

Trench A7 was excavated to sample anomaly A7, located in the southwestern quarter of the
magnetometer survey area. Trench A7 extended roughly 3 m east to west by about 1 m north to
south. It was excavated to an average depth of 90 cm. Three ceramic sherds and three thermally
altered rocks (with a combined mass of 172.71 g) were recovered during excavation of Trench A7.
The rocks presumably represent the source of Anomaly A7. Four soil zones were identified in the
south wall (Figure 16). The A horizon extended from the ground surface to an approximate depth of
10 cm. It was a 10YR 4/6 dark yellowish brown fine sandy loam. The lower boundary was wavy and
clear. The underlying E1 horizon extended from the base of the above to an average depth of
80 cmbs, and was a 10YR 5/6 yellowish brown fine sandy loam with a smooth and gradual lower
boundary. The underlying E2 horizon extended from the base of the above to an unknown depth,
and was a 10YR 6/6 brownish yellow fine sandy loam. A portion of the lower boundary was
exposed in the south wall at a depth of roughly 90 cm. The underlying Bt horizon was a 5YR 5/6

yellowish red sandy clay mottled with 10YR 6/6 brownish yellow sandy clay. The Bt horizon
extended to an unknown depth.

Trench A8

Trench A8 was excavated to sample anomaly A8, located in a topographically low spot along the
eastern edge of the magnetometer survey area. Trench A8 extended roughly 6 m east-west by 1 m
north-south and was excavated to an average depth of 60 cm. One ceramic sherd, one ground stone
tool, and six pieces of thermally altered rock (with a combined mass of 1,460 g) were recovered
during excavation of Trench A8. The thermally altered rocks presumably represent the source of
anomaly A8. The water table was encountered at roughly 50 cmbs. Two soil zones were identified
in the north wall of the trench (see Figure 16). The A horizon extended from the ground surface to
an average depth of 20 cm and was a 10YR 5/2 grayish brown fine sandy loam. Its lower boundary
was smooth and clear. This was underlain by a 10YR 4/2 dark grayish brown fine sandy loam E
horizon that extended from the base of the above to an unknown depth.

Trench A13

Trench A13 was excavated to sample anomaly A13 located along the southern boundary of the
magnetometer survey area. Trench A13 extended roughly 9 m east to west by 1 m north to south. It
was excavated to an average depth of 90 cm. A small hematite boulder, with a mass of 8,500 g, was
identified during excavation of trench A13, and presumably was the source of anomaly A13. The
boulder did not appear to be burned nor did it exhibit any signs of cultural modification.

Four soil zones were identified in the south wall (see Figure 16). The A horizon extended from the
ground surface to an average depth of 30 cm and was a 10YR 4/6 dark yellowish brown fine sandy
loam. The lower boundary was wavy and gradual. The underlying E1 horizon extended from the
base of the above to an average depth of 80 cm and was a 10YR 5/6 yellowish brown fine sandy
loam. The lower boundary was gradual and wavy. The underlying E2 horizon extended from the
base of the above to an average depth of 90 cm and was a 10YR 6/6 brownish yellow fine sandy
loam. Its lower boundary was smooth and abrupt. The underlying E3 horizon was a 10YR 6/6
brownish yellow coarse sand and gravel that extended to an unknown depth.

Trench C3

Trench C3 was excavated to sample complex circular anomaly C3, which was located along the
southern margin of the artifact high density and diversity area. Trench C3 was first excavated as a
scraped area using the wide blade on the trackhoe (Figure 17). The scraped area extended 12 m
east to west by 3 m north to south. Once the scraped area was excavated to an average depth of
40 cm, the floor was cleaned using sharpened garden hoes to look for features. Following this, a
narrow trench that extended roughly 5 m east to west by 1 m north to south was excavated in the
eastern half of the wider trench. The narrow trench was excavated to an average depth of 95 cm.

Sites 41RK322, 41RK375, and 41RK414
Two ceramic sherds were recovered during excavation of Trench C3. Three soil zones were
identified in the south wall (Figure 18). The A horizon extended from the ground surface to an
average depth of 25 cm and was a 10YR 4/6 dark yellowish brown fine sandy loam with a wavy and
gradual lower boundary. The underlying E1 horizon was a 10YR 5/6 yellowish brown fine sandy
loam that extended from the base of the above to an average depth of 70 cm. Its lower boundary
was wavy and gradual. The underlying E2 horizon was a 10YR 5/8 yellowish brown sand that
extended from the base of the above to an unknown depth.

Trench C4
Trench C4 was excavated to sample complex circular anomaly C4, using the same technique
described above for Trench C4. The wide portion of the trench extended roughly 8 m east to west
by 3 m north to south. It was excavated to an average depth of 40 cm. The narrow portion of the
trench extended 5.5 m east to west by 1 m north to south and was more or less centered within the
wider trench. Three ceramic sherds, one botanical charcoal sample (0.61 g), and two pieces of
thermally altered rock (with a combined mass of 130.99 g) were recovered during excavation of
Trench C4. Three soil zones were identified in the south wall of the trench (see Figure 18). The A

brown fine sandy loam with a smooth and gradual lower boundary. The underlying E1 horizon
extended from the base of the above to an average depth of 100 cm, and was a 10YR 5/6 yellowish
brown fine sandy loam. The underlying E2 horizon was a 10YR 6/6 brownish yellow fine sandy
loam that extended to an unknown depth.

Trench 18

Trench 18 was excavated adjacent to shovel test 18 along the southwestern boundary of the artifact
high density and diversity area. Trench 18 extended roughly 4 m east to west and 1 m north to
south. It was excavated to an average depth of 60 cm. A total of 12 ceramic sherds and 1 piece of
thermally altered rock (23.4 g) were recovered during excavation of Trench 18. Unit 1 was
excavated off of the south wall of the trench, and the profile is described below with the Unit 1
description.

Trench 19

Trench 19 was excavated adjacent to shovel test 19 and within the central portion of the artifact
high density and diversity area. Trench 19 extended 5 m east to west by roughly 1 m north to south.
It was excavated to an average depth of 105 cm. Three ceramic sherds were recovered during
excavation of Trench 19. Five soil zones were identified in the north wall of the trench (Figure 19).
The A horizon was a 10YR 4/4 dark yellowish brown fine sandy loam that extended to an average
depth of 15 cm. The lower boundary was clear and wavy. The underlying E1 horizon was a
10YR 5/6 yellowish brown fine sandy loam that extended from the base of the above to an average
depth of 30 cm, with a gradual and wavy lower boundary. The underlying E2 horizon was a
10YR 5/8 yellowish brown fine sandy loam that extended from the base of the above to an average
depth of 70 cm, with a gradual wavy lower boundary. The E3 horizon was a 10YR 6/6 brownish
yellow fine sandy loam that extended from the base of the above to around 100 cm, with a clear and
wavy lower boundary. The underlying Bt horizon was a 2.5YR 4/8 red sandy clay mottled with
10YR 7/4 very pale brown sandy clay that extended from the base of the above to an unknown
depth.

Trench 49

Trench 49 was excavated adjacent to shovel test 49 and within the artifact high density and
diversity area. Trench 49 extended 5 m east to west by roughly 1 m north to south. It was excavated
to an average depth of 90 cm. A total of four pieces of ground stone, eight ceramic sherds, and three
thermally altered rocks (with a combined mass of 807.53 g) were recovered during excavation of
Trench 49. Four soil zones were identified in the south wall of the trench (see Figure 19). The A
horizon was a 10YR 4/6 dark yellowish brown fine sandy loam that extended from the ground

Sites 41RK322, 41RK375, and 41RK414
surface to about 15 cmbs, with a wavy and clear lower boundary. The underlying E1 horizon was a
10YR 5/6 yellowish brown fine sandy loam that extended from the base of the above to about
65 cmbs, with a gradual wavy lower boundary. The underlying E2 horizon was a 10YR 6/6
brownish yellow fine sandy loam that extended from the base of the above to around 90 cmbs, with
a clear and wavy lower boundary. The underlying E3 horizon extended from the base of the above
to an unknown depth. The E3 was a 7.5YR 5/6 strong brown fine sandy loam.

HAND EXCAVATION

Two 1-x-1-m units (units 1 and 2) were excavated by hand within the site area harboring the
highest density and diversity of cultural materials (see Figure 13). Unit 1 was excavated off of the
south wall of Trench 18. Unit 2 was excavated 1 m to the west of shovel test 51.

Unit 1

Unit 1 was excavated off of the south wall of Trench 18 to sample the artifact high density and
diversity area defined through shovel testing. This unit was excavated to an average depth of 60 cm.
Excavation yielded 13 lithic nontools, 30 ceramic sherds, 9.43 g of faunal remains, 3.14 g of
botanical charcoal, and 19.61 g of thermally altered rock. The vertical distribution of these
materials is presented in Table 5.

Two soil zones were identified in the south wall of Unit 1 (Figure 20). The A horizon was a
10YR 4/6 dark yellowish brown fine sandy loam that extended from the ground surface to roughly
15 cmbs, with a smooth and gradual lower boundary. The underlying E horizon was a 10YR 5/6
yellowish brown fine sandy loam that extended from the base of the above to an unknown depth.

Unit 2
Unit 2 was excavated to sample the artifact high density and diversity area. It was excavated to an
average depth of 80 cmbs. Excavation yielded four chipped stone tools, consisting of one chert
utilized flake, one chert Friley arrow point, one chert Gary dart point, and one metaquartzite Gary
dart point base. Other cultural materials recovered from Unit 1 include 10 lithic nontools, 7 ceramic
sherds, 15.03 g of botanical charcoal, and 183.4 g of thermally altered rock (Table 6).

Three soil zones were identified in the north wall of Unit 2 (see Figure 20). The A horizon extended
from the ground surface to around 10 cmbs and was a 10YR 4/6 dark yellowish brown fine sandy
loam with a wavy and gradual lower boundary. The underlying E1 horizon extended from the base
of the above to around 70 cmbs and was a 10YR 5/6 yellowish brown fine sandy loam with an
abrupt and wavy lower boundary. The underlying Bt horizon was a 10YR 6/6 brownish yellow
sandy gravelly clay that extended to an unknown depth.

FINAL STRIPPING

Following the completion of the above work a roughly 65 m north-south by 25 m east-west area
(Figure 21) was carefully scraped using the broad blade on a small trackhoe in an attempt to locate
ceramic vessels or vessel sections potentially associated with Caddo burials. This area was chosen
for scraping based on the results of shovel testing, the orientation of the landform harboring the
site, and the location of trees on-site.

Earth removed from the scraped area was pushed to the east off of the low rise harboring the site
(Figure 22). Due to the small size of the blade, the trackhoe was only able to remove a small amount
of sediment during each pass and excavated less than an inch down with each pass.

Figure 22. Site 41RK375 Final Stripping
A crew of three walked behind the trackhoe during each pass and examined the newly scraped
surface. Each time a sherd was identified, the area around it was scraped with a sharpened garden
hoe and/or a trowel to determine whether it represented a part of a burial vessel. All temporally
sensitive artifacts located during final stripping were collected. A representative sample of
nondiagnostic artifacts was also recovered. These items include one silicified wood end scraper,
one chert biface fragment, and five ground stone artifacts.

This effort identified two discrete ceramic concentrations (see Figure 21) that represent sections of
several vessels. However no entire vessels that may have been associated with a burial were
encountered. A total of 236 ceramic sherds were recovered during scraping. Of this number, 53
sherds were recovered from two isolable ceramic concentrations. Both ceramic concentrations
were fully exposed and pedestaled using trowels in an effort to determine whether entire vessels
were present prior to the removal of any sherds. In both concentrations sherds were encountered
oriented vertically in the soil and lying flat. Ceramic Concentration 1 (recorded in the field as
Feature 2) consisted of 18 sherds that represent sections of five different vessels. Ceramic
Concentration 2 consisted of 35 sherds and sherdlets that represent sections from two different
vessels. Both ceramic concentrations were identified near the base of the A soil horizon, just above
the conformation with the E horizon. These ceramic concentrations are not considered to be intact
cultural features as they were found in a context that has been altered by historic plowing.

MACROBOTANICAL ANALYSIS (by Leslie Bush)
Eleven samples of carbonized plant material were submitted to Macrobotanical Analysis for
identification from site 41RK375. All of the samples were recovered from nonfeature contexts in
¼-inch excavation screens.

Methods

Carbon samples were collected in the field according to Atkins protocols for radiocarbon dating. In
the laboratory, the samples were sorted on clean glassware and handled only with metal forceps,
metal dissection probe, and latex gloves. The scale pan was cleaned between samples. Samples
were not screened, and contact with paper was avoided. Data were recorded with a plastic
mechanical pencil.

Each charcoal fragment was examined under a stereoscopic microscope at 7–28 X magnification.
Most were easily identifiable as hickory or walnut nutshell at low magnification. The wood charcoal
fragment was snapped to reveal a transverse section and examined under a stereoscopic
microscope at 28–45 X magnification. The transverse anatomy, particularly the presence of pore
chains that characterize the genus Ilex, made examination of tangential and radial sections
unnecessary.
Botanical materials were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level by comparison to
materials in the Macrobotanical Analysis comparative collection and through the use of standard
reference works (Core et al. 1979; Davis 1993; Hoadley 1990; InsideWood 2004-onwards; Martin
and Barkley 2000; Panshin and de Zeeuw 1980). Plant nomenclature follows that of the PLANTS
Database (United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service 2012).
When identification was complete, charcoal pieces were counted and weights were measured on an
Ohaus Scout II 200 x 0.01 g electronic balance. All material was bagged and labeled for curation.

Results

Plants identified from the 41RK375 samples are given in Table 7. All material was identifiable as
either nutshell or wood charcoal. All but one fragment of nutshell was thick-shelled Carya sp.
(hickory); the other was Juglans nigra (black walnut). Some fragments from the interior of the
nutshell could be identified only as Juglandaceae (hickory or walnut). The wood charcoal consists of
a single specimen of Ilex, the genus that includes American holly, possumhaw, dahoon, and yaupon.

RADIOCARBON ANALYSIS
Two radiocarbon samples were submitted to Beta Analytic for analysis. Both samples were
previously submitted to Macrobotanical Analysis for identification. Neither sample was recovered
from an intact cultural feature. Both samples are, however, presumed to have cultural origins
because they were recovered from within the artifact high density and diversity area. Lot 75 was a
burned black walnut nutshell recovered from Unit 1, Level 4. Lot 75 returned a 2- sigma calibrated
date of A.D. 1020 to 1160. Lot 82 was a burned hickory nutshell recovered from Unit 2, Level 5. Lot
82 returned a 2-sigma calibrated date of A.D. 1430 to 1480.

ANALYSIS OF THE CHIPPED AND GROUND AND BATTERED STONES
The cultural materials recovered from 41RK375 are presented in Table 8.

Chipped Stones

The chipped stone assemblage recovered during testing investigations at site 41RK375 includes 51
artifacts, consisting of 7 tools or tool fragments and 44 debitage fragments. The most common
artifactual raw material type is chert, accounting for 41.2 percent of the assemblage (n = 21),
followed closely by metaquartzite, accounting for 39.2 percent of the assemblage (n = 20). Silicified
wood is the third most common material, accounting for 15.7 percent of the total (n = 8). Single

specimens of orthoquartizte and quartz arenite were also recovered, each accounting for 2 percent
of the assemblage. Thermal alteration was observed in 19 artifacts (37.3 percent) which may
indicate intentional modification to improving knapping characteristics.

Lithic debitage includes 13 corticate flakes or fragments, accounting for 29.5 percent of the
debitage and 31 decorticate flakes or fragments, accounting for 70.5 percent of the assemblage. The
percentage of cortical debitage ranges from 0 percent for quartz arenite to 100 percent for
orthoquartzite, with chert, metaquartzite, and silicified wood exhibiting 24 percent, 40 percent, and
50 percent corticate specimens, respectively.

Striking platform was also examined during the analysis. The most common platform type is
faceted (n = 12), followed by multifaceted (n = 8), abraded (n = 3), cortical (n = 3). Eighteen of the
debitage specimens had platforms of indeterminate type. Faceted and multifaceted striking
platforms are usually produced during tool finishing or resharping activities. Abraded and cortical
platforms more likely are associated with initial lithic reduction or early stages of tool manufacture.
This suggests that tool finishing and resharpening were more important activities at the site than
initial reduction and early-stage manufacture.
Chipped stone tools recovered from the investigation consist of three projectile points or
fragments, one end scraper, one biface fragment, one utilized flake, and one utilized fragment
(Table 9).

Projectile Points

Recovered projectile points or fragments include a Friley arrow point, a Gary dart point, and a Gary
dart point fragment, which are described below.

Lot 84.1. This Friley arrow point is manufactured from a medium-grained gray chert. It has a very
small triangular-shaped body, contracting stem, slightly recurved lateral margins, and barbs that
turn upward slightly (Figure 23). The barbs and point appear to have been broken and
resharpened. The artifact is 14.4 millimeters (mm) in length, 11.5 mm in width, and 3.1 mm in
thickness.

Lot 85.1. This Gary dart point was manufactured from a brown to light brown medium-grained
chert that has been thermally altered. It has a triangular-shaped body, contracting stem, convex
basal edge, distinct shoulders with slight barbs, and slightly recurved lateral margins (see Figure
23). The stem, one barb and the distal tip appear to have suffered damage during usage, and the tip
has been resharpened. It is 32.1 mm long, 21.5 mm wide, and 6.4 mm thick. The artifact does not fit
well with any of the varieties of the Gary type proposed by Johnson (1962:162–163), likely due to
alterations that resulted from resharpening. The lateral margins appear to have been resharpened
shortly before discard, and no apparent evidence of utilization is present on the blade edges.

Lot 85.2. This artifact appears to be a basal fragment from a Gary dart point. It was manufactured
from a dark reddish brown fine-grained metaquartzite that has been thermally altered. The body of
the artifact has been truncated just above the stem and one of the stem margins is also fractured.
These fractures do not appear to be use related and probably result from thermal alteration. The
stem is thick, broad, and contracting with a rounded termination (see Figure 23). The extant
portion of this specimen is 18.2 mm in length, 26.4 mm in width, and 7.9 mm in thickness. Although
only a fragment, the artifact appears consistent with the Alsa variety of the Gary type proposed by
Johnson (1962:162–163).
The Friley arrow point is consistent with the early part of the Late Prehistoric period, represented
by the Early to Middle Caddo occupation. The Gary dart point type occurs from the Late and
Terminal Archaic through the Woodland periods in East Texas (Turner and Hester 1993).

Bifaces

The two bifacial tools recovered from site 41RK375 consist of a Stage 2 biface and a distal point
fragment of a Stage 5 biface that are described below.

Lot 87.1. This complete Stage 2 biface (see Figure 23) was manufactured from brown mediumgrained, silicified wood. It is 52.6 mm in length, 23.5 mm in width, and 10.0 mm in thickness. It is a
plano-convex in cross section. The ventral side is convex and the dorsal side retains a small amount
of cortex. The proximal and lateral margins have been bifacially reduced, presumably to form a
hafting element. The distal margin has an unmodified spine plane angle of about 25 degrees. It
exhibits use wear in the form of shallow edge rounding and several small point cone initiated,
feather and step terminated, fractures primarily to the dorsal side. This damage pattern suggests a
shaving activity against a medium or soft to medium material such as fresh wood or plant material.
It is decorticated with an ovate-shaped body and prominent central ridge on both faces. The distal
and proximal margins are convex and exhibit slight crushing damage. The lateral edges are convex,
one markedly so. Both exhibit serrated flaking. No apparent evidence of utilization is present.

Lot 87.2. This artifact appears to be a distal point fragment from a thin biface with a biconvex cross
section and manufactured of very light gray fine-grained chert (see Figure 23). The remaining
portion of the tool is 31.7 mm in length, 26.8 mm in width, and 6.5 mm in thickness, with straight to
slightly convex lateral margins. The point angle is about 45 degrees. The tip of the point has been
truncated with a snap fracture, probably indicative of a prying activity. No apparent evidence of
utilization is present on the lateral margins except for a very slight edge rounding that probably
resulted from light-duty cutting activity against soft or medium material. Based on the remaining
morphology, the artifact probably functioned as a knife or a general purpose biface

(lots 66.1 and 79.1). Lot 66.1 is a thermally altered fragment of reddish brown silicified wood that
has minor unifacial flaking to the proximal end and slight edge rounding on one lateral margin,
suggesting short-term usage in an undetermined activity. Lot 79.1 is a light brown fine-grained
chert tertiary flake that exhibits very fine flaking on the dorsal side of one lateral margin, suggestive
of short-term usage by scraping against soft or medium material.

Ground and Battered Stone Tools

Nine ground and battered stone tools were recovered at 41RK375 (Table 10). Four were recovered
from Trench 49 and five were found during final scraping. Both lower stones and upper hand-held
stones were recovered. The upper hand-held stone is the most easily manipulated and supplies
pressure during the two primary mechanical operations of pounding and rubbing. The lower stone
serves as a stationary platform that absorbs the pressure of pounding and/or rubbing. Recognizing
the range of use-related activities associated with any particular tool can be difficult; however,
understanding the morphological differences between the two types of tools and identifying certain
key attributes help to distinguish the different actions (or processes) and the range of materials
that produced the distinctive wear found on specific tools.

Examination under 10 x power binocular magnification revealed the presence of seven types of
wear on one or more tools: grinding, polishing, pecking, battering, pitting, grooves, and striations.
On the basis of microscopic examination, the recovered tools were assigned to six functional
categories: pitted anvil stone (n = 2), pitted anvil stone/abrader (n = 2), pitted mano (n = 2), mano
(n = 1), polishing stone (n = 1), and possible pestle fragment (n = 1).

Pitted Anvil Stone (n = 2)

A pitted anvil stone is a platform stone that exhibits one or more cupped depressions indicating a
distinctive grinding and/or pounding operation. The two stones assigned to this category have
wear patterns that suggest they were primarily used for processing ocher (Table 11 and Figure 24).

Lot 71.4 is a flat, trapezoidal-shaped stone that exhibits grinding and pitting on both plane surfaces.
Both surfaces and all four edges are heavily stained with yellow ocher. One plane surface exhibits
extensive battering, and grinding occurs only on the high-relief areas. Yellow ocher coats the peaks
of the ground areas and fills the interstices between the peaks. The conical-shaped pitted areas are
shallow and relatively jagged, suggesting that this surface was used most heavily for pounding and
pulverizing ocher nodules.

On the opposite plane surface, the pits are smoother. Grinding also occurs on the high-relief areas;
however, it is more extensive and the ocher staining is more evenly distributed across the face of
the stone, extending into the pitted area, as well. This pattern suggests that this side of the stone
was used to grind down the ocher nodules after they were pulverized on the opposite side.

Lot 87.2 is a rectangular-shaped stone that exhibits a basin-shaped grinding surface on one side
(see Figure 24). On its opposite surface, the remnants of two smooth pits are still visible. The stone
is heavily stained with ocher.

Pitted Anvil Stone/Abrader (n = 2)

Two of the pitted anvil stones exhibit evidence of grinding, but both appear to have been used
primarily as abraders (Table 12).

Lot 87.1 is a large fragment of silicified wood that exhibits both grooves and jagged pits (Figure 25).

Lot 87.3 is a large biconcave slab of hematitic sandstone (see Figure 25). Although the stone is
heavily weathered, one surface still retains evidence of a basin-shaped grinding surface while the
opposite face has the remnants of deep grooves. The grinding surface is too deteriorated to
determine what types of substances were processed.

Mano (n = 1)

One hematite mano was recovered from a back dirt pile during scraping (Lot 92.1; Figure 26). The
stone is 67.56 mm in length and 56.44 mm in width and has an average thickness of 18 mm. Its
small, oval shape makes it easily manipulated with the fingers. Heavy grinding occurs on both faces
and around the edges. Battering occurs along the edge on one side. The stone is heavily stained with
ocher.

Pitted Mano (n = 2)
Two pitted mano fragments were recovered. Both are hematitic sandstone. Although the stones are
weathered, both still exhibit patches of grinding and pitted areas.

Lot 71.1 is a small oval-shaped pitted mano that is missing one end. The remaining end exhibits
battering. Although the stone is weathered, patches of grinding and polish are still visible. Pitted
areas occur on both plane surfaces of the tool and appear as shallow, smooth depressions rather
than jagged pits. On one surface, a depression is located roughly in the center of the stone and
grinding is visible only on the high-relief areas. The opposite surface is better preserved, and
microscopic examination revealed that heavy grinding has obliterated the interstices between the
grains and there are distinct areas of polish that fill the shallow depression and extend around the
edges and onto one side of the tool. Unidirectional striations are also visible on this side of the tool.

Lot 71.3 is a rectangular-shaped stone with flattened sides in plan that is wedge shaped in profile
and exhibits wear on multiple surfaces (see Figure 26). Light battering occurs on both ends. One
relatively smooth convex surface has a wide smooth pitted area that appears as a shallow
depression. The opposite surface is irregular, exhibiting areas of battering. Grinding has flattened
both sides, and remnant areas of a bright smooth polish with sharply defined edges are still visible.
Multidirectional striations are still visible on the two flattened surfaces and suggest a scraping
motion. The striations and the high polish associated with this tool point to plant-processing
activities.

Pestle Fragment (n = 1)

Specimen 71.2 is a roughly cylindrical fragment of quartz arenite (see Figure 26). Ground and
polished areas occur on the high-relief areas of the remaining surfaces of the tool. Unidirectional
striations extend lengthwise down the tool. Microscopic examination of its working surfaces show
that in some areas polish occurs on the high-relief grains, and the interstices between the grains are
free of debris, smooth, and as shiny as the grains themselves. In other areas, there is
microfracturing of the interstices between the grains, and grinding has obliterated the interstices
between the grains, leaving distinctive patches of polish. This mixture of wear types suggests that
this tool may have been a multipurpose food-processing tool used to grind both relatively hard
substance(s) and soft vegetal material.

Ground and Battered Stone Tool Summary

Wear patterns on the eight ground and battered stone tools recovered at 41RK375 provide clues to
the range of resource-related activities carried out at the site. In addition to their use in generalized
pulverizing/pounding activities, wear observed on the four hand-held stones points to the
processing of both hard and soft vegetal material. The basin-shaped surfaces of the anvil stones
point to their use in pounding and/or grinding bulk materials such as plant material. The grinding
Atkins 100027188/120124

101

Sites 41RK322, 41RK375, and 41RK414
of nonplant substances also occurred at the site. This is supported by the ocher stains found on two
of the anvil stones and two of the manos.
A number of nonfood-related activities are also indicated. The presence of the two anvil stones/
abraders with distinctive grooves and jagged pits points to the manufacture and maintenance of a
variety of wood, fiber, stone, and/or possibly bone implements.

FAUNAL REMAINS

During testing at site 41RK375, 8 faunal specimens were recovered from Unit 1, Level 4 (40–50
cmbd). The condition of preservation is very poor, with postdepositional erosion and breakage
being the only observed attrition (Table 13).

*All specimens are from Unit 69, Level 4, 40–50 cmbd.

All eight specimens are attributable to medium-sized mammals. Five of the specimens, including
two longbone diaphyseal fragments and three unidentified fragments could not be identified more
specifically. The three remaining bones could be attributed to a deer-sized artiodactyl. They include
a distal fragment of a left radius, a left 1st phalange medial fragment, and a right 2nd phalange
proximal fragment.

It seems likely that the deer-sized artiodactyl can be attributed to white-tailed deer. Other than
deer, no other deer-sized artiodactyls are thought to have inhabited this region prehistorically.
However, it is possible that the bones are intrusive elements in the archeological deposits and
represent later, historic-aged artiodactyls such as sheep, goat, or swine.

No evidence of cultural modification was present on any of the eight specimens. None of the bones
appear to have been burned. However, other possible predepositional modification would have
been masked by the extreme erosion that the bones have undergone.

Atkins 100027188/120124

6. Site 41RK375
No indication of age or sex is present on any of the specimens. The three specimens identified as
deer-sized artiodactyls appear to be consistent with an average-sized or slightly smaller than
average-sized adult.
Given the concentration of faunal specimens in a single provenience, it seems likely that the bone
fragments are associated and represent a single depositional episode.

ANALYSIS OF THE PREHISTORIC CERAMICS

A total of 457 prehistoric ceramic sherds were recovered from 41RK375 (Appendix A). This total
includes 104 sherds recovered from hand excavations and 353 sherds recovered during scraping.
Analysis of the ceramics proceeded in two phases. The first phase involved an initial sort in which
all sherds in the assemblage were examined in order to identify those that could be conjoined or
confidently be determined to be part of the same vessel (i.e., fitters). During the initial sort, 160
sherds could be matched with at least one other sherd thereby reducing the total count to 297
sherds. After fitters were identified, 69 undecorated sherds measuring less that 2 cm in diameter
and/or heavily eroded sherds were culled, leaving a total of 228 plain and decorated sherds in the
analyzed sample.
The second phase involved a detailed analysis of the ceramic sample. In the absence of whole
vessels or vessel sections large enough to discern typologically distinct decorative motifs, one way
to distinguish subtle differences between relatively similar ceramics is to look at the technological
variation and observable modes found on individual sherds (see Brown 1998; Lechtman 1977; Rice
1987; Rye 1981). Thus, all sherds in the analyzed sample were characterized according to a suite of
key attributes (for detailed discussions of the analytical methods and definitions of the individual
attributes, see Brown 1998; Ellis 1992, 1995, 2010; Perttula 2004, 2005, 2010).

Description and Analysis of Technological Attributes

The following section reviews the technological aspects of the 228 sherds in the analyzed sample in
order to identify locally distinct stylistic and technological behaviors. The technological attributes
recorded for each sherd in the analyzed sample included (1) paste constituency (i.e., identification
of the type of nonplastic inclusions [i.e., sand, bone, grog]), the predominant size range of nonplastic
inclusions [i.e., medium sand, fine sand, very fine sand per Wentworth 1922, 1933], and paste
texture; (2) exterior and interior surface treatment; (3) exterior and interior decorative treatment;
(4) morphological class (i.e., body, base, or rim); (5) average thickness; and (6) firing environment
(i.e., oxidizing vs. nonoxidizing). Each of these attributes provides information about technological
variability enabling finer-grained distinctions between individual sherds, which in turn allow the
analyst to more fully characterize the assemblage even in the absence of identifiable types, thereby
providing a basis for placing the ceramics within a broader regional ceramic context.

Sites 41RK322, 41RK375, and 41RK414

Paste Attributes
Aspects of paste texture and paste constituency were determined by examining each sherd in the
analyzed sample under 10 x binocular magnification.

Paste Texture: Variability of paste texture is influenced primarily by the amount, shape, and size of
nonplastic inclusions and the manufacturing techniques employed by the potter during primary
forming (Shepard 1976:117–120). Given this, textural categories were established on the basis of
two criteria: (1) overall arrangement and orientation of the grains visible in the paste fabric, and
(2) the presence or absence of any intervening pores or voids. Observations about the textural
aspects of a sherd’s general morphology and overall configuration provide information on the
extent to which the clay was manipulated during paste preparation (e.g., wedging, kneading) and
primary forming (e.g., the types of coil joints). To adequately assess this attribute, it is important
that the freshly broken cross section show the vertical rather than the horizontal orientation of the
sherd. Among the 228 sherds in the sample, three textural categories were identified: irregular,
blocky, and laminated.

(1) Irregular – The largest number of sherds in the analyzed sample (n = 162; 71 percent) fall
into this category. In cross section, the sherds with this paste texture have large, widely
spaced irregularities such as hematite nodules, occasional coarse-sized sand grains, or
burned out chaffs of vegetal material. The paste fabric appears uneven, and the coil
junctures are sometimes visible.

(2) Blocky – The cross section surface of pastes assigned to this category have textures that
are similar to those classified as irregular except that the irregularities are larger and the
paste fabric appears even more uneven. Coil junctures are often visible and loosely
consolidated due to the large inclusions. Seven percent (n = 16) of the sherds in the
analyzed sample have paste textures that appear blocky in cross section.

(3) Laminated – Pastes assigned to this morphological category have a stepped or platy look.
In cross section, the relatively straight laminas are oriented at an oblique angle rather
than being parallel or perpendicular to the sherd surface. Coil junctures usually appear
beveled. The direction of the lamina, as well as the alignment of the coil junctures,
provides information about forming techniques. For example, when laminas are angled
toward the interior, this suggests that scraping was done in an upward motion on the
exterior of the vessel and in a downward motion on the interior. Twenty-one percent
(n = 49) of the sherds in the analyzed sample have paste fabrics that appear laminated in
cross section, and most of those have laminas oriented toward the interior portion of the
sherd.

In summary, if we think of the various textural categories as representing locations on a continuum,
then the majority of ceramics recovered at 41RK375 are fairly well worked, with any widely spaced
irregularities being due to the presence of extraneous inclusions embedded in the paste fabric (i.e.,
grog, bone, hematite nodules, large-sized sand grains, etc.). By contrast, 21 percent of the analyzed
ceramics have laminated paste textures indicating less-thorough manipulation of the clay prior to
Atkins 100027188/120124

104

6. Site 41RK375
and during the forming process. These textural differences point to the use of different “paste
recipes” during pottery manufacturing (see Ellis and Ellis 1996a, 1996b; Livingood 2007; Winchell
and Ellis 1991). These differing paste recipes could be related to temporal or functional differences.
Even given the small sample size, a functional difference is supported by the results of an analysis of
Woodland ceramics from the Hawkwind site (41HS915) where ceramics with both irregular and
laminated pastes were both in use over a long period of time (Ellis et al. 2012). If pastes become
better worked through time, then one would expect an increase in irregular textures with a more or
less corresponding decrease in pastes exhibiting laminated textures; however, this does not
necessarily appear to be the case at 41HS915. Thus, it may be that the continued long-term use of
pots with laminated pastes reflects a consistent and intentional manipulation of the clay during
primary forming to create a specific texture that was functionally related rather than temporally
related.

Paste Constituency: Microscopic examination indicated that the basic paste fabric of each sherd in
the sample started with a fine to very fine sandy to silty clay to which varying combinations of
nonplastic inclusions had been added. Each sherd was assigned to a primary paste group on the
basis of the presence or absence of specific tempering agents, with the presence or absence of bone
and/or grog being the primary designators. In all, three Paste Groups (PG) were identified (Table
14). PG 1 included 100 sherds to which grog had been added to the basic paste matrix. The sherds
in PG 2 (n = 82) had been tempered with both bone and grog, and the sherds assigned to PG 3
(n = 46) had been tempered with bone. Within the major paste groups, subgroups were defined on
the basis of the predominant size range of the basic paste fabric (i.e., fine sand, very fine sand, silty
clay, clay) and any additional tempering agents present in the paste fabric (i.e., crushed hematite,
charred organic material, and/or larger-sized sand grains). In all, 26 different combinations of paste
constituencies were observed within the three paste groups.

Paste Group 1

This paste category includes 100 sherds with detectable amounts of grog embedded in a fine to
very fine sandy or silty clay matrix. Paste subgroup 1a contains 10 sherds with grog embedded in a
fine and very fine sandy paste matrix. PG 1b includes 39 grog-tempered sherds with grog
embedded in a predominantly very fine sandy paste matrix, and PG 1c includes 51 sherds whose
basic paste fabrics were predominantly in the silty clay size range. PG 1b and 1c contained sherds
that also included a range of additional tempering agents such as crushed hematite, discontinuously
larger-sized sand grains, and/or charred organic material. The presence of a relatively high
proportion of discontinuously larger-sized coarse-to-very-coarse-sized sand grains mixed within a
predominantly very fine sandy to silty clay matrix suggests the intentional blending of two different
size grades of sand (Connaway 1980; Rice 1987).

Paste Group 2
The sherds included in PG 2 (n = 82) had been tempered with both bone and grog. Paste subgroup
2a includes 15 sherds with bone and grog embedded in a predominantly very fine sandy paste
matrix. Paste subgroup 2b includes 67 sherds with bone and grog embedded in a predominantly
silty clay matrix. A large percentage of the sherds in both subgroups also contain additional
tempering agents such as crushed hematite and discontinuously larger-sized sand grains.

Paste Group 3

This paste category includes 46 sherds with detectable amounts of bone embedded in a fine-to-very
fine-to-silty clay matrix. Paste subgroup 3a includes 1 sherd with finely crushed bone embedded in
a predominantly fine sandy paste matrix. Paste subgroup 3b includes 8 sherds with bone and grog
embedded in predominantly sandy paste. Paste subgroup 3c contains 37 sherds with bone
embedded in a silty paste. A large percentage of the sherds in all three subgroups also contain
additional tempering agents such as crushed hematite and discontinuously larger-sized sand grains.

Summary

In summary, both paste textures and paste constituencies are variable. Three major paste groups
were identified, with 26 different combinations of tempering agents having been used to
manufacture the vessels found at the site. These variable paste constituencies and paste textures
indicate that several different paste preparation and/or fabricating techniques had been used to
manufacture the vessels used at 41RK375.

A closer look at the distribution of paste textures across paste groups shows that the representation
of paste textures in each paste group is relatively consistent (Figure 27). These textural differences
suggest the variable use of different “paste recipes” (see Ellis and Ensor 1998; Ellis and Ellis 1996a,
1996b; Livingood 2007; and Winchell and Ellis 1991) in that different “recipes” require different
aplastic inclusions to be added to the paste, which in turn affects the manipulation of the basic clay
fabric during primary forming. In effect, the larger the inclusions, the more difficult it is to work the
clay and achieve a more consistent paste fabric. Given that in 41 percent of the sherds the temper
was finely crushed and/or sparse, the smaller size of the inclusions would have allowed for better
working of the basic paste fabric, thereby enabling the potter to produce a finer-textured paste.
Thus, the proportionately similar distribution of paste textures across paste groups is less likely to
relate to clay workability, but rather, it simply reflects differences in paste recipes, as well as
possible functional differences in the use of particular vessels (i.e., bone-tempered vs. grogtempered vessels).

Basic Exterior and Interior Surface
When the vessel reaches its final shape, supplemental modifications are made to the surface. These
modifications affect only the outermost surface of the vessel and often effectively obliterate earlier
primary-forming attributes. Techniques that affect the surface characteristics of a vessel can be
carried out during all stages of pottery manufacturing; however, it is useful for analytical purposes
to differentiate between surface modifications that are carried out on wet pliable clay (i.e., wetsmoothing or floating) from those that figure in the finishing of leather-hard or dry vessels (i.e., drysmoothing and burnishing) from those that add to the detail of the overall surface (i.e., decorative
elements such as slips, incised lines) (see Reina and Hill 1978:22–25).

For each sherd in the analyzed sample, the basic finish of the exterior and interior surface,
irrespective of decorative technique, was noted. Visual inspection of the 228 sherds in the analyzed
sample determined that seven different techniques had been used to finish the surface of vessels
found at 41RK375 (Tables 15 and 16). Among the sherds in the analyzed sample, 3 percent (n = 15)
of the exterior surfaces and 8 percent (n = 19) of the interior surfaces are too weathered to
accurately determine their surface finish.

Among the 213 sherds with recognizable exterior surfaces, surface finish seems fairly equally
distributed between dry-smoothed/unburnished (n = 94) and floated/unburnished (n = 83)
(Figure 28). Two brushed sherds have wet-smoothed exterior surfaces. Burnished exterior surfaces

Floating is a process whereby the surface of the pot is repeatedly wet then lightly stroked to
redistribute the finer particles. Sometimes referred to as a self-slip, this process levitates the fine
clay particles to the surface leaving a fine coating of clay on the surface. On the exterior surface of
11 sherds (5 percent), a red pigment had been added to the water used to wet the surface during
the floating process resulting in a distinctive red-floated surface. The surface of four of these sherds
had then been burnished.
By contrast, there appears to be a clear preference for floated/unburnished surfaces in that the
majority of interior surfaces exhibit this finishing technique (46 percent), while only 18 percent are
dry-smoothed/unburnished (Figure 29). Burnished interior surfaces are also more prevalent (20
percent) than are burnished exterior surfaces (11 percent), as are red-floated interior surfaces (8
percent). Two bottle sherds had wet-smoothed interior surfaces.

When looking at particular paste groups, a similar pattern was observed in that dry-smoothed
unburnished surfaces are more prevalent on the exterior of vessels and floated/unburnished
surfaces are more prevalent on the interior of vessels (Figures 30 and 31). There does, however,
appear to be a proportionately greater representation of burnished exterior surfaces among the
bone-tempered sherds in PG 3 (see Figure 30). Burnishing the surfaces would reduce the likelihood
of large chunks of bone breaking loose and mingling with the vessel’s contents; however, most of
the bone inclusions noted in PG 3 (as well as the other paste groups) are finely crushed. Thus, it
may be that interior burnished bone-tempered vessels served some specific as yet unknown
purpose.

Vessel Form
In the absence of whole vessels, the general aspects of vessel form can be assessed through
attributes such as thickness, diameter, and gross morphological category (i.e., body, base, and rim).
The 228 sherds in the analyzed sample include 182 body sherds (80 percent); 11 lower body
sherds (5 percent); 12 bases (5 percent); 2 near-rim sherds (1 percent); and 20 rim sherds (9
percent). One rim-to-base section from a small jar was also recovered (see Figure 34). Overall, the
assemblage is dominated by jars; however, bottle and bowl fragments were also found.

The thickness of the vessel wall was determined as the vessel was formed and its coils obliterated
and is directly related to the intended appearance and function of the vessel. Large containers
require thicker walls making them more resistant to thermal breakage. They are also more
desirable for storage because their thick bases increase stability and keep moisture in, or out, of the
vessel. By contrast, thinner-walled vessels conduct heat more efficiently than thicker-walled vessels
and are more resistant to thermal shock (Rice 1987:227–228).

At 41RK375, thickness varied on each individual sherd, as well as between individual sherds in the
sample. For body sherds, the average thickness was calculated by taking a minimum of three
readings at various points around the edges. The body sherds range in thickness from 4.0 mm to
12.9 mm, with an average thickness of 7.283 mm ± 1.381 mm. For rim sherds, the average thickness
was calculated for the edge opposite the rim edge. Among the recovered rims, thickness ranged
from 4.2 mm to 8.6 mm, with an average thickness of 6.582 mm ± 1.208. When thickness
comparisons are made between the plain and decorated sherds, there is virtually no difference
between the average thickness of the plain and the decorated body sherds (Table 17). There are,
however, notable differences in average thickness between the plain and the decorated rim sherds
even given the relatively similar standard deviations (Table 18). If thinner-walled vessels conduct
heat more efficiently than thicker-walled vessels and are more resistant to thermal shock (Rice
1987:227–228), then it may be the thinner-walled plain vessels were used more for cooking. By
contrast, the thicker-walled decorated vessels would have been more resistant to breakage, making
them more reliable as serving vessels. These assumptions, however, should be viewed somewhat
cautiously given the small and/or disproportionate differences in sample sizes.

Differences in average thickness measurements among the various paste groups were also
calculated. While the average thicknesses of plain body sherds associated with all paste groups are
relatively similar (Table 19), the decorated body sherds in PG 1 and PG 2 also have similar average
thicknesses (Table 20). However, the average thicknesses of both the decorated body sherds and
the plain rims in PG 3 are thinner than those associated with the other two paste groups (see Table
20; Table 21). Unfortunately, no decorated rims were recovered for PG 3, so it was not possible to
determine whether the trend continued (Table 22). If thickness is directly related to a vessel’s
intended use, then it may be that vessels tempered only with bone served a different purpose than
those tempered with grog and/or bone-and-grog. This assumption is bolstered by the
proportionately higher number of bone-tempered sherds with dry-smoothed burnished exterior
surfaces (discussed above).

The base fragments (n = 12) are also highly variable, ranging in thickness from 4.9 mm to 12.4 mm,
with an average thickness of 8.636 mm ± 2.243 mm. Most appear to have been rounded or rounded
flat, with no abrupt change in contour (Figure 32). The average thicknesses of the 11 lower body
sherds (8.309 ± 1.966 mm) are somewhat thinner and exhibit a slightly narrower standard
deviation than the bases. However, it is not unexpected that the lower body sherds would be
somewhat thinner than the bases and thicker than the body sherds.

Rim Characteristics

The analysis of rim characteristics is important because the rim reveals more about the vessel
shape than do the body sherds (i.e., orifice diameter), and when elaborated, they are indicative of
style. Because the rim strengthens the vessel orifice, modifications of rim form often have
functional implications (i.e., pouring, lifting, retaining liquids). For example, a thinned rim edge
Atkins 100027188/120124

114

Sites 41RK322, 41RK375, and 41RK414
would be better for pouring than would a flat lip edge. Thus, the rim is an important element of
both style and function (Shepard 1976:245–248).

The 21 rim fragments recovered from 41RK375 represent an array of bottles and small-to-mediumsized bowls or jars (Figure 33). Fragments of one small jar with a diameter of 5.0 cm were also
recovered (Figure 34). Of the 21 vessel fragments found at the site, 9 have a sufficiently large
enough radius to determine orifice diameter. The average diameter for these 9 vessel fragments is
10.312 cm, with the smallest measuring 5.0 cm in diameter and the largest measuring 15 cm.
When possible, four additional attributes were recorded for each rim in the assemblage, including
rim profile, rim form, lip profile, and lip decoration. Among the 21 recovered rim fragments, 9 are
plain (Table 23 and see Figure 33) and 12 are decorated (Table 24).

Rim Profile

Rim Form

Rim Profile: The rim is the margin of the vessel orifice. This margin is distinctive only when it is set
off by some change in contour or thickness. When the wall of the vessel is carried to the rim without
a break in contour or a change in thickness, the rim is said to be “direct” (Shepard 1974:245). When
the rim is set off from the wall of the vessel by a curve or an angle, the rim is described as
articulated. Where this change exists, the rim is either expanding or contracting (i.e., thinned). The
majority (n = 14) of the rims recovered at 41RK375 are thinned in profile. Three are exterior
expanding in profile and two are expanding/contracting. Two are direct in profile.

Rim Form: The form of the rim is distinguished by the change in orientation between the wall or
the neck of the vessel and lip. An articulated rim is set off by a curve or an angle, while a direct rim
is straight with no change in orientation (Rice 1987:214). At 41RK375, the majority of rims (n = 12)
are outflaring (n = 2) or slightly outflaring (n = 10) in form. Four rims are straight with no
significant change in orientation. Five rims are too small to determine their rim form with any
degree of confidence.

Lip Profile: The lip is the edge or margin of the rim bordering the mouth of the vessel. The shape of
the lip varies depending on the position of the thumb and the fingers. If finished entirely by hand,
the lip edge will be rounded, tapered, or rounded and somewhat flattened. A flat lip edge is
distinguishable from other forms because it results from the use of a straight-edged tool rather than
manipulation by the fingers alone (Shepard 1976:247).

Among the 21 recovered rim fragments, the shape of the lip edge was highly variable and occurs
primarily on the decorated rims (see Table 24). Lip edges varied around two specific techniques:
rounding and flattening. The majority exhibited some variation of rounding. Six had been tapered
then rounded, nine had been rounded toward the exterior, and three had been folded to the
exterior then rounded. Two rims had flattened lip edges. One reconstructed vessel section exhibited
an unusual lip treatment (see Figure 48, Lot 91.2). The lip edge of this vessel had been rounded and
flattened toward the exterior; however, the excess clay rather than being folded and blended into
the clay body on the exterior was left extended at right angles to the lip edge then scalloped. This
decorated rim was the only one that exhibited any type of lip decoration.

In summary, the vessels in use at 41RK375 included bowls and an array of straight-walled jars with
relatively unrestricted orifices that are reflected in the straight and slightly outflaring rim forms. At
least five of the plain rims were bottle fragments. Modifications of rim form often have functional
implications (i.e., pouring, lifting, retaining liquids). If we assume that overall vessel shape is
controlled by the need for containers that serve particular purposes (Shepard 1976:344), then the
vessels in use at 41RK375 appear to include vessels whose variable lip edges were designed to
serve a range of functions.

Firing Atmosphere

The conditions under which a vessel was fired include such variables as the temperature, the
duration of firing, and the amount of available oxygen. Variability in clay composition is also a
factor. In low-fired ceramics, the configuration of the vessel’s firing core reflects variations in these
conditions and the degree to which any organic matter in the clay has been oxidized. Thus,
variation in color generally provides an indication of whether or not pottery was fired in an
oxidizing (lighter colors such as those in the tan, orange, light brown to red range) or nonoxidizing
(dark colors such as dark brown, gray or black) environment [see Rice (1987); Shepard (1976); and
Teltser (1993) for more-detailed discussions of firing attributes.]
Atkins 100027188/120124

119

Sites 41RK322, 41RK375, and 41RK414
At 41RK375, the general variation in color development observed on surfaces and paste cores
clustered more toward the darker end of the color spectrum (Table 25). This firing pattern
indicates that 63 percent of the sherds found at the site were from vessels fired in less-controlled
atmospheres with insufficient or reduced amounts of oxygen, with 25 percent having been low fired
and incompletely oxidized. This could have resulted from factors such as (1) the firing temperature
being too low, (2) the maximum temperature not being sustained long enough, (3) the firing
atmosphere having insufficient oxygen, or (4) some combination of all three variables.

Analysis of the Decorated Sherds
Once the basic finish of the vessel’s surface has been established, the potter may choose to further
enhance or decorate that surface. This enhancement could include one or more techniques that
either displace or penetrate the surface (such as incising, brushing, or punctating) or are added to
the surface (such as slips or washes). The potter also makes a decision as to whether or not the
chosen decorative technique is best rendered on a wet, leather-hard, or dry surface.

Of the 228 sherds in the analyzed sample, only 46 (20 percent) are plain wares (Table 26), while
182 sherds (80 percent) exhibit the remnants of at least one decorative element on their exterior
surface. Eleven of the decorated sherds also exhibit interior surface decoration, and five of those
had been decorated on their interior surface only. Slips were the only form of interior decoration.

Decorative techniques that displaced or penetrated the surface, such as brushing and incising, were
by far the most common (Table 27). Techniques that added to the surface, such as slips or
appliqués, occurred much less frequently and most often occurred in combinations with other
decorative techniques. In general, the assemblage is dominated by utility wares, with fine wares
(e.g., engraved and/or slipped sherds) having only minor representation (14 percent).

Utility Wares

The majority of the decorated sherds (n = 155; 86 percent) are considered utility wares that exhibit
at least 10 combinations of techniques that involve brushed, punctated, incised, appliquéd, and/or
pinched elements.

Brushed

The assemblage is dominated by jars with brushed decorative technique, either as the sole
decorative element occurring on the sherd (n = 58) (Table 28) or in combination with other
decorative elements (n = 43) (see Tables 32–35, discussed in more detail below). The brushing
technique varies, with diagonal brushing, both overlapping (Figure 35, Lots 93.39 and 75.1) and
parallel (Figure 35, Lot 90.13), being the most prevalent. Parallel (Figure 35, Lot 93.29) and
overlapping (Figure 35, Lot 92.52) horizontal and vertical brushing (Figure 35, Lot 93.16) are also
found. Brushing was often used in combination with other decorative techniques such as incising,
appliqués, and punctations.

Punctated

Punctations (n = 55) were found on 31 percent of the decorated sherds. On 19 sherds, they occur as
the sole decorative element (Table 29) and occur in horizontal (Figure 36, Lot 93.6), diagonal
(Figure 36, Lot 92.13), or vertical rows (Figure 36, Lot 93.28). Others occur randomly with no
apparent pattern (Figure 36, Lot 87.2). On 36 sherds, punctations were used in combination with
other decorative elements (discussed below).

Incised

Among the rim and body sherds recovered at 41RK375, incised lines (n = 49) were found on 27
percent of the decorated sherds, and on 14 of those, they are the sole decorative element found on
the sherd (Table 30). More often they occur in combination with other design elements such as
brushing, punctations, and appliqués (discussed below).

They appeared most often as straight horizontal, vertical, and/or diagonal incised lines (Figure 37).
The majority were wide-line incisions executed on a wet paste (Figure 37, Lot 71.2), possibly
fragments from Maydelle Incised vessels. Narrow line incisions were much less common (Figure 37,
Lot 92.28). One sherd (Figure 37, Lot 93.19) has design elements incorporating both wide and
narrow lines. Interestingly, the wide vertical lines were cut into the still wet surface of the vessel.
After the surface had dried to the leather-hard stage, the narrow horizontal lines were placed atop
the wide lines.

Incised-Punctated
Six of the decorated body sherds exhibit decorative elements that incorporated both incised lines
and punctuations (Table 31). On two of the sherds, parallel opposing lines had been crosscut by
random fingernail punctations (Figure 38, Lots 93.26 and 93.52). Three sherds had both parallel
opposing lines and tool punctations. On one of these, rows of large circular punctations abut a
series of narrow, horizontal incised lines (Figure 38, Lot 92.18). Specimen 93.32 exhibits a series of
shallow, narrow crosshatched with remnant fingernail punctations (Figure 38, Lot 93.32).

Incised-Pinched

One of the recovered sherds has broad trailed lines framing a field of shallow trailed lines enclosing
pinched elements (Figure 39). This sherd may be an early variant of the Killough Pinched type.

Brushed-Incised
Roughly 10 percent of the decorated sherds exhibit brushed-incised decorative elements (Table

The brushing technique varied, with diagonal brushing (n = 9) being fairly common (Figure 40, Lots
75.3, 90.2, and 92.41). Vertical (Figure 40, Lot 93.18) and horizontal (Figure 40, Lots 93.4 and

Incised-Appliquéd-Punctated
Two possible Pease Brushed-Incised sherds exhibit a series of narrow, diagonal incised lines that
intersect a punctated appliquéd fillet. Lot 92.36 has a series of straight, evenly spaced tool
punctations impressed into the curved fillet (Figure 41), while Lot 93.11 has large circular tool
punctations (see Figure 41).

Brushed-Incised-Punctated, Brushed-Punctated, Brushed-Appliquéd, Brushed-AppliquédPunctated

On 26 of the decorated sherds (14 percent), brushing had been combined with incising,
punctations, and/or appliqués. The brushed-incised-punctated sherds (Table 33) combine several
basic techniques that were configured to produce different decorative motifs. Grog-tempered rim
sherd 44.1 has wide, horizontally oriented brushed-incised lines executed on a wet paste with a
row of tool punctations encircling the rim (Figure 42). Lot 93.3 is a bone-and-grog tempered sherd
that has overlapping horizontal brushing with a row of punctations separating the brushed area
and the incised lines (see Figure 42). Lot 92.26 has wide incised lines atop overlapping horizontal
brushing with a single tool punctation beneath the rim (see Figure 42). On Lot 79.1, a series of wide
diagonal incised lines had been cut into a field of diagonal brushing abutting what appears to be a
field of drag and jab tool punctations (see Figure 42). Lot 92.3 is a near rim fragment from a small
jar with a narrow horizontal line bounded by a row of stylus punctations. Parallel vertical brushedAtkins 100027188/120124

6. Site 41RK375
One sherd has a brushed-appliquéd design element (Figure 43). This sherd has parallel vertical
brushing with a vertical appliquéd ridge. Patches of residue are still visible on its surface.

Figure 43. Brushed-appliquéd sherd recovered from 41RK375
Fifteen brushed-punctated sherds were found. Among those, fingernail (Figure 44, Lot 68.2), stylus
(Figure 44, Lot 871.), tool (Figure 44, Lot 92.40), and linear (Figure 44, Lots 70.3, 87.5, and 92.39)
punctations that had been used in conjunction with diagonal, vertical, and/or horizontal brushing
(Table 34).

Six sherds exhibit brushed-appliquéd-punctated design elements (Table 35). These sherds are all
similar in that they all have appliquéd fillets bounded by vertical brushing. Linear or tool
punctations had been impressed into the fillets (Figure 45).

Fourteen of the rims and body sherds in the above categories have characteristics diagnostic of the
type Reavely Brushed-Incised (see Hart 1982:64–65; Perttula 2009:160, Table 6, and Figure 13), a
utility ware that is quite common at the Washington Square Mound site (Corbin and Hart 1998).
They exhibit horizontal brushing around the rim and are often vertically brushed on the body of the
vessel. Horizontal rows of linear punctations are often found beneath the rim, and again at the
juncture of the body (Figure 45, Lots 93.10 and 93.13). Often the linear punctations are oriented
vertically across the body of the sherd (Figure 45, Lot 93.27). Nearly all of the brushed-appliquédpunctated sherds found at the site were classified as Reavely Brushed-Incised (Figure 45, Lots
92.35, 93.7, 93.8, 93.34, 93.35, and 93.48). Three of the brushed and linear punctated sherds were
also classified as Reavely Brushed-Incised (Figure 45, Lots 70.3, 87.5, and 92.39).

Fine Wares
Fine wares represent 14 percent of the vessel fragments found at 41RK375. Decorative techniques
noted on these sherds involved the use of engraved lines, slipped surfaces, or combinations of both.
Most of the design motifs were too fragmented to assign them to a specific type with confidence;
however, two sherds may be fragments of Poyner Engraved vessels (see Figure 46, Lot 70.2, and
Figure 47, Lot 75.2).

Engraved

Engraved elements appeared on 8 percent of the decorated sherds. Most involved curved lines,
ladder, and crosshatched motifs (Figure 46).

to red (2.5YR 4.6) (Figure 47, Lot 92.2). A section from a small jar with remnants of an exterior redslipped surface was also recovered (Figure 47, Lot 75.2).

Discussion
The ceramic assemblage at 41RK375 is dominated by decorated wares (n = 181; 79 percent).
Among the 181 decorated sherds, 86 percent are utility wares, while fine wares comprise only 14
percent. Brushing (56 percent) was the principal decorative technique used to enhance the surface
of utility wares. This includes sherds on which brushing appears as the sole decorative element
(n = 58) and those sherds on which brushing had been used in combination with one or more other
decorative elements (e.g., punctations, incised lines, appliqués) (n = 43). Punctations were found on
31 percent of the sherds as either the sole decorative element or in combination with other
decorative elements. Incised lines were found on 27 percent of the decorated sherds. . Plain wares
represented only 20 percent of the ceramic assemblage, making the plain/decorated sherd ratio
(P/DR) quite low at 0.25. The origins of this pattern remain ambiguous and may be due, in part, to
sampling strategy. The majority of the ceramics were recovered from mechanically scraped areas,
which may have introduced a certain collection bias where decorated sherds were more likely to be
recovered than plain sherds. If, for example, decorated vessels were better fired and used less
intensively than plain vessels, decorated sherds might be more likely to survive in the archeological
record and better withstand degradation during mechanical stripping, and consequently be more
likely to have been recovered during stripping. The presence of such a bias may be hinted at by the
fact that the P/DR from the hand-excavated units and the shovel tests is 0.42. However, this ratio is
based on only 47 sherds, which is too small a sample size to be reliable. While the P/DR ratio is
problematic, it does suggest occupation during the latter part of the Middle Caddo period.

During the Middle Caddo period, innovations in ceramic traditions were widespread with regard to
both vessel form and decorative style (Hart and Perttula 2010; Perttula and Ellis 2012). Distinctive
fine wares appeared and engraved motifs included hatched, crosshatched curvilinear and vertical
ladder motifs, and triangular panels filled with concentric circles (Gadus et al. 2006; Perttula 2004;
Walters 2008). Decorated utility wares had a similar broad range of common elements and motifs
that include incised lines, rows of tool and fingernail punctations, appliquéd ridges and fillets,
and/or brushing. While there is broad similarity in the use of decorative styles, the preferences for
differing tempering agents such as bone and/or grog varied from one Caddo community to another
(Perttula and Ellis 2012).

Atkins 100027188/120124

6. Site 41RK375
Given this range of decorative techniques, distinctions have been made between the known Middle
Caddo period sites in the upper and lower portions of the Big Cypress Creek drainage (Bruseth and
Perttula 1981; Nelson and Perttula 2003; Nelson and Turner 1997; Walters 2009) and those
located in the upper and middle reaches of the Sabine River drainage (Walters 2008, 2010; Walters
and Haskins 1998). Comparisons suggest that certain of these distinct characteristics are more
closely associated with sites in each drainage area. Site 41RK375 is located in the middle reaches of
the Sabine River drainage, and the ceramic attributes found at this site are similar to those found at
other Middle Caddo site assemblages in this area.

The prevalence of utility wares over fine wares at 41RK375 and the diversity of decorative
techniques are typical of Middle Caddo assemblages (Perttula and Ellis 2012). Although red-slipped
pottery (7 percent) is somewhat more common at 41RK375 than it is at other sites on the south
side of the Sabine River (Perttula and Ellis 2012), the high proportion of brushed sherds
(56 percent) is also typical of Middle Caddo assemblages in this area (Perttula and Ellis 2012). The
high percentage of ceramic paste groups with bone, either as the primary tempering agents (PG 3,
20 percent) or combined with grog (PG 2, 36 percent), also fits well with assemblages from the
middle reaches and south of the Sabine River. Further, the results from the INAA and petrographic
thin section analyses (see below) strengthen this association.

Four of the 41RK375 sherds were selected for INAA and petrographic thin section analysis (Table
39, Figure 48). Results of the INAA demonstrated a strong similarity to the Core Group from Caddo
Subregion 7, a region that includes most of Rusk County (Appendix B). The petrographic analysis,
however, is much more informative (Table 39; Appendix C). Thin section analysis of the four
selected sherds showed a pronounced variation in ceramic pastes and inclusions (see Appendix C,
Table C-2). The sections varied over a wide range in type and proportions of temper and mineral
inclusions, so much so that the definition of paste groups could not be made on the basis of clearly
observed similarities. In effect, each section was considered its own paste group. However, a
number of minor minerals, such as hematite and muscovite, were observed in all of the sections,
and were probably resident in the natural ceramic clays. In fact, studies have shown that clays from
the Sabine River drainage are higher in resident hematite (Nash et al. 2011; Perttula and Ellis 2012;
Reese-Taylor 1997). In summary, data from the petrographic analysis indicates that the sherds
from 41RK375 fit well within the Sabine River mineral characterization and were most likely
locally produced by different potters using a range of materials and techniques.
Finally, the mere presence of brushed sherds at 41RK375 points to a post–A.D. 1265 date. Given the
high percentage of brushed sherds and a P/DR that seems to hover at the low end of the scale, a
date that is closer to A.D. 1400 is suggested. This time range is also supported by the recognized
types found at the site, including Reavely-Brushed Incised, Pease-Brushed Incised, and the possible
Maydelle Incised and Killough Pinched utility wares, as well as the possible Poyner Engraved fine
ware sherds.

SUMMARY
Site 41RK375 is a multicomponent prehistoric site that appears to have resulted largely from a late
Middle Caddo residential occupation. Based on the recovery of several Gary dart points and dart
point bases along with a Pontchartrain dart point during previous survey (Skokan et al. 1997) and
the present investigation, site 41RK375 appears to have been sporadically occupied during the
Middle to Transitional Archaic period. Based on the recovery of two Friley arrow points, one during
the present investigation and one during previous survey, the site is also thought to have been
occupied during the Early Ceramic to Early Caddo period. The absence of ceramic artifacts from this
period, however, suggests the site was only occupied sporadically, probably for short-duration
task- specific or extractive occupations during the Early Ceramic to Early Caddo periods. One of the
radiocarbon samples returned a 2-sigma calibrated date ranging from A.D. 1020 to 1160 that is
consistent with occupation during this period.
The Middle Caddo component is much better represented than the previous components, namely
by the ceramic assemblage. The high percentage of brushed sherds in the ceramic assemblage and
the low P/DR, along with the assemblage of typed wares, are consistent with occupation during the
latter part of the Middle Woodland period. The density and the distribution of ceramics across the
site are indicative of an intensive, presumably residential, occupation.

The second radiocarbon sample returned a 2-sigma date range from A.D. 1430 to 1480 that could be
consistent with a Middle Caddo occupation, considering that Reavely Brushed wares, which were
relatively common on-site, were produced by Caddo potters well into the fifteenth century
(Perttula 2012, personal communication with Linda Ellis).

6. Site 41RK375
All three prehistoric components appear to have used the topographically highest portion of the
landform harboring the site most intensively. Consequently, it was not possible to isolate any of
these components horizontally. The single burned rock feature identified on-site, which appears to
represent a disarticulated hearth, may be the result of use by the Middle Caddo site occupants or by
previous occupants. The assemblage of temporally diagnostic projectile points recovered through
previous survey and testing predates the Middle Caddo occupation. This observation suggests that
the subsistence strategy employed by the pre–Middle Caddo site occupants focused more heavily
on hunted resources than that employed by the Middle Caddo occupants.

The soil on-site was a deep fine sandy loam Bienville that typically extended to more than 80 cm in
depth before encountering a sandy clay Bt horizon. These soils are excessively well drained and can
be strongly acid. The poor preservation of subsistence remains as well as the absence of pit or post
features on-site is attributable in part to repeated inundation, soil acidity, as well as natural and
cultural sources of turbation.

Several conclusions can be drawn based on the patterned vertical distribution of cultural materials.
The majority of all cultural materials were recovered from within the first 40 cm below the ground
surface. Cultural materials were, however, recovered throughout the vertical column. These
observations suggest that the site has not aggraded substantially since its prehistoric abandonment
and cultural materials migrated throughout the vertical column after they were discarded
systemically. For these reasons, the various components identified on-site could not be isolated
vertically.

NRHP testing at site 41RK375 demonstrated that behaviorally interpretable patterns of discard
have not been preserved on-site. This work identified at least three separate components that could
not be isolated horizontally or vertically. This work also demonstrated that subsistence remains,
spent fuel remains, and cultural features were poorly preserved on-site. Significant data resources,
relevant to understanding the Middle to Transitional Archaic, the Early Ceramic to Early Caddo, and
the latter part of the Middle Caddo periods have not been preserved on-site. For these reasons, site
41RK375 does not appear to warrant NRHP inclusion under Criterion D. No additional investigation
is warranted or recommended.

SITE 41RK414
SITE SETTING
Site 41RK414 is located on a prominent ridge summit at an approximate elevation of 380 ft msl.
Tiawichi Creek is located about 400 m to the north of the site (see Figure 1). The soil on-site is
Darco loamy fine sand, 8 to 15 percent slopes. Presently, about half of the site is in pasture and
dense grasses completely obscure ground surface visibility (Figure 49). The remainder of the site is
in a mixed pine hardwood woods with a dense brushy understory that completely obscures ground
surface visibility. A graded two-track gravel road crosses the site north to south adjacent to the tree
line separating the pasture from the woods (Figure 50). The road bed is deeply incised where it
crosses the ridge summit indicating that road construction, use, and maintenance have resulted in
alteration to the landform harboring the site.

The soil exposed in shovel tests typically exhibited an A/E/Bt profile. The A horizon was a dark
yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) fine sandy loam that extends typically to 30 cmbs. The E horizon was a
yellowish brown (10YR 6/6) sandy loam that typically extended in depth to around 70 cmbs in the
pasture and a meter or more in the woods. The Bt horizon ranged from a yellowish red (5YR 5/8) to
a strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) sandy clay.

BACKGROUND

Site 41RK414 was recorded during previous survey of the Oak Hill Mine (Skokan et al. 1997). At
that time, an intensive surface inspection and 16 shovel tests were conducted to locate the site’s
boundaries. Four chert flakes and three silicified wood flakes were recovered from the ground
surface. Seven shovel tests were culturally positive and yielded five pieces of chert debitage, three
pieces of silicified wood debitage, three pieces of quartzite debitage, one piece of jasper debitage,
one piece of novaculite debitage, one pitted stone, one silicified wood biface fragment, and one
chert Ellis dart point.

POSITIONAL CONTROL

A 20-m grid was established with a hand-held compass and a 60-m tape. Due to dense vegetation
within the wooded portion of the site, using the total station to acquire the locations of shovel tests
was not feasible. A Trimble GPS unit typically accurate to less than 2 m with differential correction
was used to acquire the locations of all shovel tests and the single backhoe trench excavated on-site.

SHOVEL TESTING
Shovel testing was conducted in two phases. During the first phase 36 shovel tests were excavated
at 20-m grid intercepts (Figure 51). Of these shovel tests, 9 were culturally positive and yielded a
total of 18 pieces of nondiagnostic lithic debitage. Shovel test 1 yielded four artifacts, making it
twice as productive as the next highest yielding shovel test and suggesting the presence of an
artifact high density area. Shovel tests 2, 12, 17, 18, and 22 each yielded two pieces of lithic
debitage. All of the remaining positive shovel tests (4, 15, 30, and 31) yielded a single piece of
debitage each.
During the second phase of shovel testing, six shovel tests were excavated around shovel test 1 at
10-m grid intercepts. Of these tests, only shovel test 40 was culturally positive, yielding a single
piece of debitage.

Artifacts were fairly evenly distributed across the site. The highest-elevated portion of the site,
however, appears to have resulted from a somewhat more intensive occupation than the remainder
of the site. The highest yielding shovel test (1) along with four other positive shovel tests (2, 17, 18,
and 40) occurred within a roughly 30-m east-west by 20-m north-south area centered on the
summit of the landform.

BACKHOE TRENCHING

A single backhoe trench was excavated adjacent to the highest yielding shovel test (1). Trench 1
extended roughly 4.5 m in length and was excavated to an average depth of 75 cmbs (see Figure
51). Three soil zones were identified in the west wall of Trench 1 (Figure 52). The A horizon was a
10YR 4/4 dark yellowish brown fine sandy loam that extended from the ground surface to 30 cmbs,
with a smooth and gradual lower boundary. The E horizon was a 10YR 6/6 brownish yellow fine
sandy loam that extended from the base of the above to around 70 cmbs, with a smooth abrupt
lower boundary. The underlying Bt horizon was a 10YR 5/8 yellowish sandy clay (70 percent)
mottled with a 5YR 5/8 yellowish red sandy clay (30 percent), that extended from the base of the
above to an unknown depth.

ANALYSIS OF THE CHIPPED STONES

The chipped stone assemblage recovered during testing investigations at site 41RK414 consists of
19 debitage fragments (Table 40). The most common raw material type is chert, accounting for 63.2
percent of the assemblage (n = 12). Metaquartzite accounted for 15.8 percent of the assemblage
(n = 3). Two specimens each of silicified wood and quartz arenite were also recovered, each
accounting for 10.5 percent of the assemblage. Thermal alteration was observed in 8 artifacts (42.1
percent), which may indicate intentional modification to improve flaking characteristics. No
evidence of use or other cultural modifications was observed in the lithic assemblage.

The assemblage includes 15 decorticate flakes or fragments, accounting for 79.9 percent of the
debitage and 4 corticate flakes or fragments, accounting for 21.1 percent of the assemblage. The
percentage of cortical debitage was 0 percent for quartz arenite, 16.7 percent for chert,
33.3 percent for metaquartzite, and 50 percent for silicified wood.

Striking platform was also examined during the analysis. The most common platform type was flat
(n = 5), followed by multifaceted (n = 3), abraded (n = 3), and cortical (n = 1). Four of the debitage
fragments had missing platforms and 3 had platforms of indeterminate type. Multifaceted striking
platforms are usually produced during tool finishing or resharpening activities. Flat, abraded, and
cortical platforms more likely are associated with initial lithic reduction or early stages of tool
manufacture.

SUMMARY

Site 41RK414 is a diffuse, low density prehistoric lithic scatter that likely resulted from multiple
occupational episodes during the prehistoric period, at least one of which occurred during the
Middle to Transitional Archaic, based on the recovery of a single Ellis dart point during the original
survey of the site (Skokan et al. 1997). The absence of intact cultural features or behaviorally
meaningful patterns of discard strongly suggests that significant data resources that might qualify
the site for NRHP listing under Criterion D have not been preserved on-site. No further work is
recommended.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Two prehistoric sites (41RK375 and 41RK414) and one historic site (41RK322) located during
previous survey within the Oak Hill Mine (Skokan et al. 1997) were subjected to NRHP eligibility
testing.

Research at 41RK375 indicates that it resulted from at least three prehistoric components that
could not be isolated vertically or horizontally. Shovel testing, hand and mechanical excavation, and
a magnetometer survey recovered an assemblage of ceramic sherds dating to the late Middle Caddo
period, two Middle to Transitional Archaic Gary dart points, and one Early Ceramic to Early Caddo
period Friley arrow point. This work also located a single, poorly preserved, disarticulated burned
rock feature. The Middle Caddo component appears to have resulted, in part, from a residential
occupation. The other components appear to represent short-duration occupations. Two
radiocarbon dates, returned from carbonized nutshells recovered from hand-excavated units, are
consistent with an Early Ceramic to Early Caddo occupation and a late Middle Caddo occupation.
The poor preservation and mixed cultural deposits at 41RK375 suggest that significant data
resources have not been preserved on-site. For this reason, site 41RK375 does not appear eligible
for NRHP inclusion under Criterion D, and no further work is recommended.

Shovel testing and the excavation of a single backhoe trench at 41RK414 identified a large and
diffuse lithic artifact scatter that likely resulted from multiple prehistoric occupations. The absence
of ceramic artifacts and the recovery of a single Middle to Transitional Archaic Ellis dart point
during previous survey (Skokan et al. 1997) suggest that these occupations took place prior to the
Late Prehistoric period. The ephemeral nature of the site and the absence of cultural features
suggests significant data resources have not been preserved on-site. For this reason, 41RK414 does
not appear to be eligible for NRHP inclusion under Criterion D, and no further work is
recommended.

Archival research into the history of site 41RK322 suggests it was associated with occupation or
use of the land by the Vansickle/Williams family during the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries. No evidence was obtained suggesting that they were significant to local or regional
development. By 1919, the property appears to have been used for agricultural purposes through
the mid-twentieth century. As a result, the site does not maintain any known historic associations
that would qualify it for NRHP listing under Criterion A or B. Shovel testing at site 41RK322
identified low density scatter of artifacts dating from the late nineteenth to early twentieth century.

Sites 41RK322, 41RK375, and 41RK414
The origins of these materials are uncertain. The site may represent a short-duration residential
occupation. The shallow rocky soils on-site appear to have eroded since the site was abandoned
historically. The ephermal and eroded nature of the site suggests significant buried data resources
have not been preserved on-site. Site 41RK322 does not appear to be eligible for NRHP inclusion
under Criterion A, and no further work is recommended. The THC has concurred with all of the
above recommendations (Martin 2013).

I. INTRODUCTION
This report describes the preparation, analysis, and interpretation of four pottery samples from
41RK375 in Rusk County, Texas. The goals of the research are to examine both the internal
compositional variability with the hope of determining local production signatures as well as
compare these samples to the larger east Texas Caddo database. Sample IDs and some basic
descriptive information are provided in Appendix 1.
MURR has a large sample of data from Caddo ceramics from east Texas, primarily submitted by Tim
Perttula; however, this region exhibits remarkable uniformity in raw clay composition over vast
areas. This uniformity in the chemical composition of the raw materials has limited the potential for
NAA to distinguish likely ceramic production locations (Ferguson et al. 2008). The current samples
are located near the intersection of three of the Caddo regions established by Tim Perttula. Regions
6, 7, and 8 exhibit very similar core group distributions, but there is some evidence suggesting a
stronger link to the Region 7 Core Group.

SAMPLE PREPARATION

Pottery samples were prepared for NAA using procedures standard at MURR. Fragments of about
1cm2 were removed from each sample and abraded using a silicon carbide burr in order to remove
glaze, slip, paint, and adhering soil, thereby reducing the risk of measuring contamination. The
samples were washed in deionized water and allowed to dry in the laboratory. Once dry, the
individual sherds were ground to powder in an agate mortar to homogenize the samples. Archival
samples were retained from each sherd (when possible) for future research.

Two analytical samples were prepared from each source specimen. Portions of approximately
150-milligrams (mg) of powder were weighed into clean high-density polyethylene vials used for
short irradiations at MURR. At the same time, 200 mg of each sample was weighed into high-purity
quartz vials used for long irradiations. Individual sample weights were recorded to the nearest
0.01 mg using an analytical balance. Both vials were sealed prior to irradiation. Along with the
unknown samples, Standards made from National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
certified standard reference materials of SRM-1633b (coal fly ash) and SRM-688 (basalt rock) were
similarly prepared, as were quality control samples (e.g., standards treated as unknowns) of SRM278 (obsidian rock) and Ohio Red Clay (a standard developed for in-house applications).

Irradiation and Gamma-Ray Spectroscopy

Neutron activation analysis of ceramics at MURR, which consists of two irradiations and a total of
three gamma counts, constitutes a superset of the procedures used at most other NAA laboratories
(Glascock 1992; Neff 1992, 2000). As discussed in detail by Glascock (1992), a short irradiation is
carried out through the pneumatic tube irradiation system. Samples in the polyvials are
1

sequentially irradiated, two at a time, for five seconds by a neutron flux of 8 x 1013 n cm-2 s-1 The
720-second count yields gamma spectra containing peaks for nine short-lived elements aluminum
(Al), barium (Ba), calcium (Ca), dysprosium (Dy), potassium (K), manganese (Mn), sodium (Na),
titanium (Ti), and vanadium (V). The samples are encapsulated in quartz vials and are subjected to
a 24–hour irradiation at a neutron flux of 5 x 1013 n cm-2 s-1. This long irradiation is analogous to the
single irradiation utilized at most other laboratories. After the long irradiation, samples decay for
seven days, and then are counted for 1,800 seconds (the "middle count") on a high-resolution
germanium detector coupled to an automatic sample changer. The middle count yields
determinations of seven medium half-life elements, namely arsenic (As), lanthanum (La), lutetium
(Lu), neodymium (Nd), samarium (Sm), uranium (U), and ytterbium (Yb). After an additional threeor four-week decay, a final count of 8,500 seconds is carried out on each sample. The latter
measurement yields the following 17 long half-life elements: cerium (Ce), cobalt (Co), chromium
(Cr), cesium (Cs), europium (Eu), iron (Fe), hafnium (Hf), nickel (Ni), rubidium (Rb), antimony (Sb),
scandium (Sc), strontium (Sr), tantalum (Ta), terbium (Tb), thorium (Th), zinc (Zn), and zirconium
(Zr). The element concentration data from the three measurements are tabulated in parts per
million

Interpreting Chemical Data

The analyses at MURR, described above, produced elemental concentration values for 33 elements
in most of the analyzed samples. Data for Ni in all samples were below detection limits (as is the
norm for most New World ceramics) and was removed from consideration during the statistical
analysis. Calcium levels were found to be high enough in one sample (3.1 percent) to justify a
calcium correction of the dataset. Because calcium has the potential to affect (dilute) the
concentrations of other elements in the analysis, all samples were mathematically corrected to
compensate for any possible calcium included effects (the data were examined before and after
calcium correction and the results were similar). The following mathematical correction was used
as it has been proven to be effective in other calcium-rich datasets (Cogswell et al. 1998:64;
Steponaitis et al. 1988):

106 e
e' = 6
10 − 2.5c

where e′ is the corrected concentration of a given element in ppm, e is the measured concentration
of that element in ppm, and c is the concentration of elemental calcium in ppm. After the calcium
correction, calcium was generally removed from the statistical analyses. Statistical analysis was
subsequently carried out on base-10 logarithms of concentrations on the remaining 31 elements.
Use of log concentrations rather than raw data compensates for differences in magnitude between
the major elements, such as calcium, on one hand and trace elements, such as the rare earth or
2

lanthanide elements (REEs). Transformation to base-10 logarithms also yields a more normal
distribution for many trace elements.

The interpretation of compositional data obtained from the analysis of archaeological materials is
discussed in detail elsewhere (e.g., Baxter and Buck 2000; Bieber et al. 1976; Bishop and Neff 1989;
Glascock 1992; Harbottle 1976; Neff 2000) and will only be summarized here. The main goal of data
analysis is to identify distinct homogeneous groups within the analytical database. Based on the
provenance postulate of Weigand et al. (1977), different chemical groups may be assumed to
represent geographically restricted sources. For lithic materials such as obsidian, basalt, and
cryptocrystalline silicates (e.g., chert, flint, or jasper), raw material samples are frequently collected
from known outcrops or secondary deposits and the compositional data obtained on the samples is
used to define the source localities or boundaries. The locations of sources can also be inferred by
comparing unknown specimens (i.e., ceramic artifacts) to knowns (i.e., clay samples) or by indirect
methods such as the “criterion of abundance” (Bishop et al. 1992) or by arguments based on
geological and sedimentological characteristics (e.g., Steponaitis et al. 1996). The ubiquity of
ceramic raw materials usually makes it impossible to sample all potential “sources” intensively
enough to create groups of knowns to which unknowns can be compared. Lithic sources tend to be
more localized and compositionally homogeneous in the case of obsidian or compositionally
heterogeneous as is the case for most cherts.
Compositional groups can be viewed as “centers of mass” in the compositional hyperspace
described by the measured elemental data. Groups are characterized by the locations of their
centroids and the unique relationships (i.e., correlations) between the elements. Decisions about
whether to assign a specimen to a particular compositional group are based on the overall
probability that the measured concentrations for the specimen could have been obtained from that
group.

Initial hypotheses about source-related subgroups in the compositional data can be derived from
noncompositional information (e.g., archeological context, decorative attributes, etc.) or from
application of various pattern-recognition techniques to the multivariate chemical data. Some of the
pattern recognition techniques that have been used to investigate archaeological data sets are
cluster analysis (CA), principal components analysis (PCA), and discriminant analysis (DA). Each of
the techniques has its own advantages and disadvantages which may depend upon the types and
quantity of data available for interpretation.

The variables (measured elements) in archeological and geological data sets are often correlated
and frequently large in number. This makes handling and interpreting patterns within the data
difficult. Therefore, it is often useful to transform the original variables into a smaller set of
uncorrelated variables in order to make data interpretation easier. Of the above-mentioned pattern
recognition techniques, PCA is a technique that transforms the data from the original correlated
variables into uncorrelated variables most easily.
3

PCA creates a new set of reference axes arranged in decreasing order of variance subsumed. The
individual PCs are linear combinations of the original variables. The data can be displayed on
combinations of the new axes, just as they can be displayed on the original elemental concentration
axes. PCA can be used in a pure pattern-recognition mode, i.e., to search for subgroups in an
undifferentiated data set, or in a more evaluative mode, i.e., to assess the coherence of hypothetical
groups suggested by other criteria. Generally, compositional differences between specimens can be
expected to be larger for specimens in different groups than for specimens in the same group, and
this implies that groups should be detectable as distinct areas of high point density on plots of the
first few components. It is well known that PCA of chemical data is scale dependent (Mardia et al.
1979), and analyses tend to be dominated by those elements or isotopes for which the
concentrations are relatively large. This is yet another reason for the log transformation of the data.

One frequently exploited strength of PCA, discussed by Baxter (1992), Baxter and Buck (2000z),
and Neff (1994, 2002), is that it can be applied as a simultaneous R- and Q-mode technique, with
both variables (elements) and objects (individual analyzed samples) displayed on the same set of
principal component reference axes. A plot using the first two principal components as axes is
usually the best possible two-dimensional representation of the correlation or variance-covariance
structure within the data set. Small angles between the vectors from the origin to variable
coordinates indicate strong positive correlation; angles at 90 degrees indicate no correlation; and
angles close to 180 degrees indicate strong negative correlation. Likewise, a plot of sample
coordinates on these same axes will be the best two-dimensional representation of Euclidean
relations among the samples in log-concentration space (if the PCA was based on the variancecovariance matrix) or standardized log-concentration space (if the PCA was based on the
correlation matrix). Displaying both objects and variables on the same plot makes it possible to
observe the contributions of specific elements to group separation and to the distinctive shapes of
the various groups. Such a plot is commonly referred to as a “biplot” in reference to the
simultaneous plotting of objects and variables. The variable inter-relationships inferred from a
biplot can be verified directly by inspecting bivariate elemental concentration plots. [Note that a
bivariate plot of elemental concentrations is not a biplot.]
Whether a group can be discriminated easily from other groups can be evaluated visually in two
dimensions or statistically in multiple dimensions. A metric known as the Mahalanobis distance (or
generalized distance) makes it possible to describe the separation between groups or between
individual samples and groups on multiple dimensions. The Mahalanobis distance of a specimen
from a group centroid (Bieber et al. 1976, Bishop and Neff 1989) is defined by:

[ y − X ]t I x [ y − X ]
Dy2, X =

where y is the 1-x-m array of logged elemental concentrations for the specimen of interest, X is the
n x m data matrix of logged concentrations for the group to which the point is being compared with
X being it 1 x m centroid, and I x is the inverse of the m x m variance-covariance matrix of group X.
4

Because Mahalanobis distance takes into account variances and covariances in the multivariate
group it is analogous to expressing distance from a univariate mean in standard deviation units.
Like standard deviation units, Mahalanobis distances can be converted into probabilities of group
membership for individual specimens. For relatively small sample sizes, it is appropriate to base
probabilities on Hotelling’s T 2 , which is the multivariate extension of the univariate Student’s t .
When group sizes are small, Mahalanobis distance-based probabilities can fluctuate dramatically
depending upon whether or not each specimen is assumed to be a member of the group to which it
is being compared. Harbottle (1976) calls this phenomenon “stretchability” in reference to the
tendency of an included specimen to stretch the group in the direction of its own location in
elemental concentration space. This problem can be circumvented by cross-validation, that is, by
removing each specimen from its presumed group before calculating its own probability of
membership (Baxter 1994; Leese and Main 1994). This is a conservative approach to group
evaluation that may sometimes exclude true group members.

Small sample and group sizes place further constraints on the use of Mahalanobis distance: with
more elements than samples, the group variance-covariance matrix is singular thus rendering
calculation of I x (and D 2 itself) impossible. Therefore, the dimensionality of the groups must
somehow be reduced. One approach would be to eliminate elements considered irrelevant or
redundant. The problem with this approach is that the investigator’s preconceptions about which
elements should be discriminate may not be valid. It also squanders the main advantage of
multielement analysis, namely the capability to measure a large number of elements. An alternative
approach is to calculate Mahalanobis distances with the scores on principal components extracted
from the variance-covariance or correlation matrix for the complete data set. This approach entails
only the assumption, entirely reasonable in light of the above discussion of PCA, that most groupseparating differences should be visible on the first several PCs. Unless a data set is extremely
complex, containing numerous distinct groups, using enough components to subsume at least 90%
of the total variance in the data can be generally assumed to yield Mahalanobis distances that
approximate Mahalanobis distances in full elemental concentration space.
Lastly, Mahalanobis distance calculations are also quite useful for handling missing data (Sayre
1975). When many specimens are analyzed for a large number of elements, it is almost certain that
a few element concentrations will be missed for some of the specimens. This occurs most
frequently when the concentration for an element is near the detection limit. Rather than eliminate
the specimen or the element from consideration, it is possible to substitute a missing value by
replacing it with a value that minimizes the Mahalanobis distance for the specimen from the group
centroid. Thus, those few specimens which are missing a single concentration value can still be used
in group calculations.

RESULTS
East Texas Caddo ceramics typically reveal limited compositional patterning. This difficulty recently
led to the attempt by Jeff Ferguson and Tim Perttula to reanalyze the entire east Texas Caddo
database (Ferguson, et al. 2008). The reanalysis was moderately successful at finding core groups
for each of the 11 subregions that divided the area (Figure 1), but there was such significant
overlap between the core groups that it is rare to confidently assign unknown samples to a likely
production region. The attempt to project these new data from Rusk County against the east Texas
Caddo database as well as the larger MURR ceramic database are described below. We only briefly
mention internal variability due to the very small sample size from this site.

Internal Compositional Variability

Treating these new data as an isolated dataset is complicated by the small number of samples. A
cluster analysis reveals some closer relationship between LWE117 and 118. Bivariate plots do not
clearly demonstrate any subgroupings within the dataset.

Comparison with the East Texas Caddo Database

As described previously, the East Texas Caddo database has been the focus of a recent study
(Ferguson et al. 2008). This reinterpretation did not result in the determination of region-specific
production areas as initially hoped, with the possible exception of material from the northern
portion of the study area along the Red River. Figure 1 is the subregional map used by Ferguson et
al. (2008). The sample sizes of the subregions vary considerably. Region 7 includes most of Rusk
County and has one of the largest samples, including both a large Core Group and a second group
(Group 1) that separate slightly in chromium concentrations. Unfortunately, almost all of the
subregional core groups almost completely overlap with each other, with the notable exception of
Subregions 1 and 2. In order to facilitate the comparison with the East Texas Caddo subregional
groups, the new data were calcium corrected and concentrations for Ni, Sr, and Ca were removed.

Subregions 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9
These six subregions are considered together here because they all have very similar core groups
and they all have sufficient number of samples to allow the projection of groups membership
probabilities using almost all of the elements (Na, Al, K, and Ti were not included). Subregions 6, 7,
and 8 are also closest to 41RK375. Subregion 7 Group 1 also had a large number of members, so it is
also included in the comparison. These groups represent the most challenging portion of the East
Texas Caddo database reanalysis project because of the overlap. At this point it is difficult to
address how much of this overlap is due to large-scale similarities in the clay deposits, the use of
grog temper, and/or long-distance exchange of vessels. As shown in Table 1, there are almost no
samples with a high probability of membership in only one of these subregional core groups. There
is clearly a stronger similarity between these new samples and the Subregion 7 Group 1. This
similarity is most likely a function of the small sample size of Subregion 7 Group 1. Groups with
only slightly more members than the number of variables used in the calculation tend to exhibit
drastically inflated membership probabilities. In bivariate plots, it is very clear that the samples are
closer to the Subregion 7 Core Group than to Group 1 (Figure 2).

The Core groups for Subregions 6, 7, and 8 are all quite similar, making it difficult to attribute the
samples to a particular Subregion. The group membership probabilities presented in Table 1 can be
misleading for samples from east Texas. Canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) can be a valuable
statistical technique for forcing as much separation as possible between established groups. CDA
creates some separation for these three groups, and when the same projection is applied to the
41RK375 samples the unknown samples strongly trend toward the Region 7 Core (Figure 3). To
date we have not identified any subgroupings within Region 7 that correspond with more specific
production locations, but it is reasonable to suggest production in Subregion 7.

Conclusions
The interpretation of Caddo compositional data is complicated by the large-scale similarity of raw
clays in the region and the frequent use of grog as temper. These factors all contribute to the
difficulty in identifying the areas of production at multiple scales. We have demonstrated the
similarity between the new samples and the Core Group from the Subregion 7.

INTRODUCTION
The petrographic analysis of ceramics from 41RK375 was performed to identify the constituents of
the ceramic material. The purpose of this work was to make a variety of comparisons with other
known ceramics and gain insights on the sample’s technology and manufacturing techniques.
Specific comparisons with sites 41SM404 (Nash et al. 2012) and 41CP408 (Perttula and Ellis 2012)
are made to provide a wider regional perspective. Information on source localities of clays and
other constituents might also be gained. The four sherds selected for the analysis also had material
removed as samples for instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) (Table C-1).

METHODS
The methods employed here adhere to those developed by Atkins analysts in the past to evaluate
ceramics at other Caddo sites in northeast Texas (Nash et al. 2012; Perttula and Ellis 2012; ReeseTaylor 1993, 1995, 1997; Rogers 2011; Skokan and Perttula 1998). This adherence was intended to
enhance comparability with prior analyses and produce descriptions of the ceramic thin sections
that are detailed, quantified, and replicable.

C-1

The principal method of the analysis was identification and point-counting of minerals and ceramic
structures following the method of Chayes (1949) and the approach to petrographic analysis
pioneered in archeology by Shepard (1942, 1976) and elaborated by Rice (1987). Point-counting
consists in counting a set number (200) of ceramic attributes observed in the viewing field during
systematic microscopic traverses of each thin section. Counting the same number of ceramic
attributes in each thin section allows reliable statistical comparisons. Additional information such
as grain size and shape was recorded on the counting sheet for potential future reference. The color
and isotropy of the ceramic matrix was determined and recorded. Any mineral species that was
observed in the initial survey of the section but which did not fall into the count was recorded on
the counting sheet as “tr” for trace, so as not to lose information on rare but potentially significant
bodies. During the point count, the thin section was advanced 0.5 to 1 mm, and the points along the
line were counted, until the 200 count total was achieved.
The analysis was conducted on an Olympus BH 2 stereographic polarizing microscope with a
rotating stage. The ceramic thin sections were prepared by Wagner Petrographics, Inc. of Midvale,
Utah. Each thin section consisted of a prepared slide containing a single ceramic sherd oriented
perpendicular to the vessel wall. The samples were impregnated with epoxy stained with cobalt
nitrite and ground to a standard thickness of 0.03 millimeters (mm).

Observational Conventions

Measurements of all the ceramic components in the thin sections are in millimeters, and grain size
names are those of the Wentworth scale (1922, 1933). The roundness scale of Powers (1953) offers
a consistent scale for determining the qualities of shape. Grog is defined here as ground-up ceramic
sherds, and it is usually identified in thin sections as a body having pronounced angularity and
interior ceramic matrix and a set of its own inclusions. The interior ceramic matrix and inclusions
may be different altogether from the principal ceramic matrix of the section.

Isotropy, or isotropism, is a general optical property of many minerals, and it is reported for the
section matrixes. The property refers to the transmission of light through crystalline materials.
Isotropic minerals do not interrupt the transmission of light in varying ways, but they allow its
transmission through the material in all directions and angles equally. The material appears the
same on the microscope stage when the stage is rotated through any angle. Materials that disrupt
the transmission of light in any way are not isotropic, and are termed anisotropic. When the
microscope stage is rotated through a few degrees, the appearance of the anisotropic mineral
changes in some way; it may appear lighter or darker, change from one color to another, or make
some other perceptible change. The binary isotropic/anisotropic distinction is one of the few
optical ways of identifying differences in clay mineral structures below the ultra-high
magnifications available to scanning electron microscopes.

RESULTS
General Observations
The principal finding of this study is pronounced variation over a very small ceramic sample (Table
C-2). The ceramic pastes and inclusions varied over a wide range in type and proportions, so much
so that the definition of paste groups could not be made on the basis of clearly observed
similarities. Each section in effect is its own paste group. The ceramic pastes of the collection also
lack tell-tales of other regions but contain varying proportions of locally available minerals. The
ceramics represented by the thin sections were most likely locally produced by different potters
using a range of materials and techniques. This variation is seen clearly in the tempering agents.
The potters used from one to three different materials as temper in the ceramic pastes of the
sections, and the tempers are grog, bone, clay balls, and monocrystalline quartz.

Section RK375-91.2
Lot 91.2 (Scrape)
The anisotropic paste is dense, brown in plane polarized light (ppl), and grayish brown to reddish
brown in cross-polarized light (xpl). Voids are distinctively small, jagged, oriented parallel strips.
The tempers are monocrystalline quartz and Grog A. The quartz attains medium-sized sand, while
the maximum size of Grog A particles is coarse sand. The median particle size of all inclusions in the
section is fine sand. The principal minor mineral of the section is hematite in silt through medium
sand sizes. Silt- and very fine sand-sized quartz is a probable resident in the clay, and two grains of
medium sand polycrystalline quartz were observed in the section. A single grain of silt-sized chert
was observed but not counted (recorded as “trace”), but a single grain of muscovite (a form of mica)
fell into the count.

Section RK375-93.4
Lot 93.4 (Scrape)

The isotropic paste is of moderate density, reddish black in ppl, and black in xpl. Voids are thin,
jagged, oriented strips of very small overall size. The tempers of the paste are bone and clay balls.
The largest size of both temper types is very coarse sand. The median particle size of all the
inclusions is fine sand. The predominant form of quartz is resident silt-sized material. Smaller
amounts of monocrystalline and polycrystalline quartz are also present in the section. Hematite
ranges from silt to medium sand in size, and a very small fraction of silt-sized muscovite was also
observed. A single fine sand-sized grain of feldspar was observed in a clay ball in the section.

Section RK375-93.13
Lot 93.13 (Scrape)

The isotropic paste is of moderate density, reddish black in ppl, and black in xpl. Voids are thin,
jagged, oriented strips of very small overall size. The paste and void characteristics are very similar
to RK375-93.4, but the temper and proportions of other aplastic inclusions vary too widely to allow
the identification of a meaningful paste group between the two sections. The temper is
monocrystalline quartz in a small amount, with particles up to medium sand sizes. The section has
one incidental coarse sand-sized particle of bone and a small proportion of clay balls. A single
particle of polycrystalline quartz was observed. The dominant particle in the entire section is siltsized resident quartz. The material composed 27.5 percent of the counted assemblage. The median
particle size of all bodies in the section is very fine sand. Minor minerals consist of a relatively large
proportion of hematite (12.5 percent) and a small amount of muscovite.

C-4

Section RK375-93.11
Lot 93.11 (Scrape)
The isotropic paste is dense and reddish brown in ppl and dark reddish brown in xpl. Voids are
unoriented irregular bodies. The median particle size of all particles is coarse sand. The median size
is influenced upward by the abundant bone temper, with many particles very coarse sand-sized and
a few granule-sized (>1.0 mm). Quartz is present in the section in four forms. The section contains
significant proportions of monocrystalline quartz and silt-sized resident quartz, and it also has
small amounts of polycrystalline quartz and chert. A few particles of hematite were observed,
including both ferrous (valence of +2) and ferric (valence of +3) hematite. A very small amount of
muscovite completes the inventory of minor minerals.

Minor Observations

Hematite was observed in all of the sections, and it occurs in two physical forms. Small discrete
particles in silt sizes are rounded and very rounded. The chemical variants of hematite, ferrous and
ferric, are observed in this form. The second physical form is medium- and coarse-sand-sized
masses, all ferrous and containing silty quartz as an inclusion in the hematite body. The masses,
while bright red, appear transparent and have irregular outlines and sometimes gradual
boundaries with the surrounding matrix. Some specimens are thin-looking and irregular enough to
be considered iron stain. The silty quartz within the bodies is identical in all particulars to the siltsized resident quartz in the ceramic matrixes of the sections. It is probable that all the hematite
forms described here are resident in the natural ceramic clays. Hematite is very common in the
Eocene formations of northeast Texas, and research of the physical forms of the mineral in ceramics
may help provide new keys to the localization of ceramic clay sources.

The clay balls in sections RK375 93.4 and RK375 93.11 appear to be of the same material, light gray
and reddish gray masses with interior silt- and fine sand-sized quartz and hematite particles. The
single particle of feldspar in a clay ball in RK375 93.4 has already been described. A few muscovite
lathes were also observed in some of the clay balls. The clay ball bodies are rounded but have
jagged outlines or sometimes gradual boundaries that seem to grade into the surrounding matrix;
this demonstrates that the material was not fired before being included in the ceramic paste. In
other words, the clay balls are not grog but are probably naturally occurring bodies in the unfired
clay.
The grog in RK375 91.2 was previously fired and, while rounded in most instances, has distinct
boundaries with the surrounding matrix. The grog material is iron-rich, giving the bodies dark red
to reddish black color. The grog has internal bone temper in strong contrast with the larger section,
which entirely lacks bone as an inclusion. Minor minerals are monocrystalline and polycrystalline
quartz and muscovite.

COMPARISONS AND CONCLUSIONS
Reese-Taylor (1997:C7–C14) made a set of northeast Texas regional comparisons with collections
of pottery examined petrographically. She stratified her sample by drainage system, assuming
wisely that such a division would relate directly to resource collection and availability. Her
collections fell within the Sulphur River, Cypress Creek (Tankersley Creek), and Sabine River
drainages (Reese-Taylor 1997:C7–C14). She noted that ceramics in the Sabine River drainage are
especially high in hematite, resident in the clays. This finding accords well with the 41RK375
sections. The site lies in the Sabine drainage.

The Eocene formations of northeast Texas crosscut the three drainages mentioned above.
Therefore, the rivers all drain broad exposures of the same formations in the northeast Texas zone
(Flawn 1975). Yet there are differences in the tell-tale minerals that are found in the ceramics
excavated in those drainages. Reese-Taylor (1997:C7–C14) identified the minerals distinctive of
each drainage (but not exclusive within them). As mentioned, the Sabine River is higher in hematite
and also muscovite. Cypress Creek also claims significant hematite. The Sulphur River has lower
amounts of hematite but highly distinctive amounts of alkali feldspars.
Recent ceramic work adds to these emerging patterns. Site 41SM404 lies to the west of 41RK375 in
the Sabine drainage (Nash et al. 2011). Ten sherds from the site were examined by thin section
analysis. Hematite ranged from 6.5 to 19 percent in all 10 sections. This is a very high hematite
proportion and consistent with the Sabine mineral pattern. Muscovite ranged from a trace to 7
percent in 9 of the 10 sections. Overall, the 41SM404 proportions are higher than the 41RK375
proportions of 0.5 to 2.5 percent. It may be that site 41SM404 lies directly on the muscovitic
Reklaw Formation (Eocene), while 41RK375 lies no closer than a mile to the formation. However,
both sites still accord with Reese-Taylor’s (1997:C7–C14) mineral profile of the Sabine drainage.

At site 41CP408 (Perttula and Ellis 2012), petrographic thin section analysis was performed on 38
ceramic sherds. The site lies within the Cypress Creek drainage. Hematite ranged from 0.5 to 17
percent in all 36 of the sections. Muscovite ranged from 0.5 to 16 percent in 32 of the 36 sections.
Three of the sections lacking muscovite were also determined to be nonlocal ceramics. Site
41CP408 also lies on the muscovitic Reklaw Formation. Muscovite is not part of Reese-Taylor’s
characterization of the Cypress Creek drainage, perhaps because her principal study site, 41TT372,
lies well north of the Reklaw outcrops, across the main arms of Cypress Creek. Sediments derived
from the Reklaw Formation may not have contributed to deposits available to 41TT372, but they
may lie well downstream from it. In comparisons with 41CP408, it is of note that five sections
contained plagioclase feldspar or other igneous minerals, none of which are alkali feldspars, as
might be derived from the Sulphur River drainage. The single grain of feldspar in a clay ball in
RK375 93.4 could not be determined as to its status as alkali or plagioclase. It can be said that a
single grain of feldspar in a clay ball in a sample of four sections does not defy or cast doubt upon
any current mineral characterization of the Sabine drainage basin.
C-6

Further comparisons with 41CP408 and 41SM404 bear on ceramic manufacturing. The bonetempered grog in specimen RK375 91.2 compares closely to Grog Type F at 41CP408. The grog
occurred in all four sections belonging to Paste Group L (Perttula and Ellis 2012). Further, the clay
balls described in sections RK375 93.4 and RK375 93.13 are virtually identical to Clay Ball A,
identified in sections at both 41CP408 and 41SM404, specifically CP408-478.1, SM404-73, SM404138, and SM404-201 (Nash et al. 2012; Perttula and Ellis 2012). If many distinctive clay ball types
are naturally occurring markers in ceramic-quality clays, as they appear to be, then Clay Ball A may
indicate one or more ceramic clay localities shared by these sites’ potters in the Sabine drainage
and possibly in the Cypress Creek drainage as well.
In summary, the four sections analyzed by petrographic thin section analysis all appear to have
local sources of material and manufacturing. Within the local profile, however, there is considerable
potential variation, and the current sample shows some of that potential. The studied collection
coincides with the Sabine River mineral characterization of Reese-Taylor (1997: C-7 to C-14). The
observed variation in hematite suggests hitherto unexplored potential for discovering more source
localities.
