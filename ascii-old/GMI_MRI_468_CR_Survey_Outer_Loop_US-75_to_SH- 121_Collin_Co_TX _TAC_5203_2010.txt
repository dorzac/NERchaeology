MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI), under contract to HNTB Corporation, conducted archeological
investigations along a 4.6-mile (7.4-kilometer) section of the proposed Collin County Outer
Loop, a truck reliever road between U.S. Highway 75 and SH 121 in northeast Collin County.
The area of potential effects (APE) is 500 feet (152 meters) wide. Vertical impacts within the
APE will largely be restricted to the upper 3 feet (0.9 meters) except at creek crossings, where the
depth of construction will extend through soils and sediments to bedrock.
The archeological field investigations involved pedestrian survey of the entire APE in five
parallel transects spaced 30 meters apart. In total, 121 shovel tests were placed where drainage,
soils, vegetation, and low levels of disturbance suggested archeological sites might be preserved,
and as radials around identified sites. Four previously documented archeological sites are located
within 0.6 mile (1 kilometer) of the APE. No materials associated with these sites were found
within the APE, and none of the sites will be affected by this project. Four new historic-age
archeological resources—one locality and three sites (41COL203, 41COL204, and 41COL205)—
were documented during the survey. Sites 41COL203 and 41COL204 are recommended as
ineligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places or for designation as a State
Archeological Landmark. Site 41COL205 was recommended as of unknown eligibility due to the
discrepancy of the age of the artifacts versus the age of the structures, and additional shovel
testing was recommended to determine its eligibility. Texas Historical Commission (THC)
counter–recommended that detailed research be conducted prior to any additional fieldwork.
Research was conducted in February 2010, and the dwelling associated with site 41COL205 was
recommended eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) under
Criterion C. Although it was found that the dwelling was moved sometime between 1989 and
1991, the property met Criterion Consideration B, which states that “a property removed from its
original or historical significant location can be eligible if it is significant primarily for
architectural value” (National Park Service 1997:29). However, the THC decided that, although
the property is significant, it cannot be determined eligible since the original location is unknown.
The commission recommended finding a recipient for the structure and having it moved to a new
location if possible. Therefore, site 41COL205, as a whole, is recommended not eligible for
listing in the National Register of Historic Places or for designation as a State Archeological
Landmark.
All materials generated by this project will be permanently curated at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory at the University of Texas at Austin.

INTRODUCTION

In February 2009, Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI), was contracted by HNTB Corporation to evaluate
archeological resources that might be affected by the proposed construction of the Collin County
Outer Loop, a truck reliever road between U.S. Highway (US) 75 and State Highway (SH) 121
north of Melissa in northern Collin County, Texas (Figure 1). The area of potential effects (APE)
for this project is approximately 7.4 kilometers (km; 4.6 miles [mi]) in length and 152 meters (m;
500 feet [ft]) wide, covering a total area of 287.5 acres. It extends east from US 75 just south of
County Road (CR) 366 and CR 421, first crossing Throckmorton and Slayter creeks, then SH 5,
then Clemons Creek and two small tributaries of Sister Grove Creek, and finally ending at SH
121 (Figure 2). The APE is adjacent and parallel to a TXU Energy electrical transmission
corridor, which runs directly south of the APE on the west end, crosses the APE diagonally near
SH 5, and runs directly north of the APE between SH 5 and CR 419, where the paths of the APE
and the TXU line diverge.
The purpose of the cultural resources investigation in this APE is to determine the
presence/absence of archeological resources (36 CFR [Code of Federal Regulations] 800.4) and
to evaluate identified resources for their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) per Section 106 (36 CFR 800) of the National Historic Preservation Act
(NHPA) of 1966, as amended, or as a designated State Archeological Landmark (SAL) under the
Antiquities Code of Texas (13 TAC 26.12).
Melissa Green of GMI served as the Principal Investigator. Fieldwork was performed by Chris
Dayton, Bethany Oliver, and Jamie Vandagriff of GMI in June 2009. Detailed archival research
was conducted by Tarin Erickson of GMI in February 2010. All materials generated by this
project will be permanently curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) at
the University of Texas at Austin.

CHAPTER 2
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY
The APE is located in northern Collin County at elevations ranging from 630 to 710 ft (192–216
meters [m]) above mean sea level. The APE consists of uplands drained by tributaries of the East
Fork of the Trinity River, including Throckmorton, Slayter, and Clemons creeks and two minor
tributaries of Sister Grove Creek.

GEOLOGY AND SOILS
The western end of the APE is underlain by Quaternary alluvial deposits, which extend along the
APE for approximately 1 km; the remainder of the APE is underlain by the Cretaceous-age
Austin Chalk formation (Stoeser et al. 2007).
Soils on the west side of the APE, between US 75 and SH 5, are mapped as Altoga silty clay,
Austin silty clay, Frio clay loam, Lewisville silty clay, Houston Black clay, Stephen silty clay,
and Trinity clay (Natural Resources Conservation Service [NRCS] 2009). Toward the east,
between SHs 5 and 121, the soil map units include those listed above in addition to Burleson clay,
Eddy gravelly clay loam, Leson clay, and the Stephen-Eddy complex (NRCS 2009). Most of the
soils in the APE are relatively shallow; only the Frio and Houston Black series have A horizons
thicker than approximately 40 centimeters (cm; 16 inches [in]).

CLIMATE
In general, the greater Dallas area, which includes Collin County, has a mild subtropical
humid/subhumid climate with hot summers and cool winters. Summer temperatures average 84
degrees Fahrenheit ( F), with an average daily maximum of 94 F and a record high of 111 F in
1954. Winter temperatures average 48 F, with an average daily minimum of 38 F and a record
low of 7 F in 1971. The average yearly rainfall of 36 inches is seasonally biased toward a
maximum in April/May and a minimum in August. Much of the rainfall occurs in the form of
heavy thunderstorms. Snowfall, which is rare, averages less than 2 inches per year and is
generally present for less than one week (Coffee et al. 1980).
7

FLORA AND FAUNA
Collin County falls within the Texan biotic province and the Blackland Prairie ecological region
(Blair 1950; Griffith et al. 2004), the latter a subunit within the larger Southern Tallgrass Praririe
of Arkansas, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas (Nature Conservancy 2009). Native grasses include
bluestem, dropseed, eastern gamagrass, switchgrass, and yellow Indiangrass (Telfair 1999). In
contrast to the coarser, more permeable soils of the nearby Cross Timbers ecological region, the
clay-rich soils of the Blackland Prairie generally allow tree growth only in riparian contexts
(Prikryl 1990). Trees found in these limited areas may include bois d’arc or osage orange, eastern
red cedar, and hackberry, in addition to multiple varieties of cottonwood, elm, oak, and pecan
(Telfair 1999). A caveat that must be kept in mind is that these prairies have endured centuries of
disturbance and decades of deliberate replacement of tree and grass species, leaving only isolated
examples of prehistoric and early historic vegetation communities today (Telfair 1999).
Faunal communities of the Blackland Prairie have been similarly disrupted. Common animals
include birds such as bobwhites and mourning doves; small mammals such as cottontails,
opossums, raccoons, skunks, and squirrels; and riverine and riparian fauna such as turtles and
various species of fish and shellfish. Prehistoric and early historic inhabitants of the area would
have encountered these animals in addition to antelope, bison, prairie chickens, and wolves, none
of which are observed in the area today (Telfair 1999).

ARCHEOLOGY AND HISTORY OF THE STUDY AREA

Prehistoric Context
Although the chronological framework for the upper Trinity River basin is not well developed,
the available data allow the delineation of the generalized chronology outlined in Table 1 (Peter
and McGregor 1988).

Paleo-Indian Period
The Paleo-Indian period in Northcentral Texas (ca. 9500–6500 B.C.) generally includes the
remains of human presence that can be dated to the very late Pleistocene and the immediate postPleistocene periods (for reviews of this period relevant to Northcentral Texas, see Hofman 1989a;
Johnson 1989; Prikryl 1990; and Story 1990). Unfortunately, the Paleo-Indian occupation of the
upper Trinity River basin is known primarily through diagnostic projectile points from surface
collections or from stratigraphically mixed contexts (Meltzer 1987; Meltzer and Bever 1995).

9

Clovis and Plainview points are commonly found along both Denton and Clear creeks in the
Cross Timbers, northwest of Dallas. Until recently, the Lewisville Lake site (41DN71) was the
best known Paleo-Indian site within the region, containing large burned features interpreted as
hearths and a low density of artifacts including a Clovis point (Crook and Harris 1957, 1958,
1961). Although the original radiocarbon dates on the hearths suggested an anomalous early age
for Clovis points (ca. 37,000 years before present [yrs B.P.]), later work by the Smithsonian
Institution (Stanford 1981) appears to have resolved the controversy concerning the date of the
occupation there. It appears that the presence of naturally occurring lignite—either as a fuel in
these hearths or as an inadvertent inclusion—contaminated the radiocarbon samples.
Consequently, the usually accepted date of 10,000–12,000 yrs B.P. for Clovis period occupations
is probably a reasonable estimate for the first human occupation of Northcentral Texas.
A spectacular exception to the generally limited data on Paleo-Indian sites in Northcentral Texas
is the deeply buried Clovis-age Aubrey site (41DN479), located on the Elm Fork of the Trinity
River north of Dallas (Ferring 1989). The discovery of this site, buried approximately 7–8 m
below the top of the Elm Fork floodplain just below the Lake Ray Roberts dam, suggests that
well-preserved Paleo-Indian sites in Northcentral Texas will only be found by examining deeply
stratified Holocene alluvium in modern floodplain situations. Ferring has suggested that PaleoIndian sites similar to the Aubrey site may occur below 18 m of sediment in the Dallas area
(Institute for the Study of Earth & Man [ISEM] 1990).
Despite the lack of extensive data relating to the early Paleo-Indian period in Northcentral Texas,
some attempts have been made to generalize regarding settlement mobility and intensity of site
occupation, drawing on what is known and on assumptions based on comparisons with other
areas. For instance, a number of researchers have seen evidence for a high degree of group
mobility in the broad distribution of Paleo-Indian artifacts over the landscape and in the variety of
presumably nonlocal lithic raw materials from which the artifacts were made (Meltzer and Smith
1986; Shafer 1977; Story 1990). Likewise, the well-documented exploitation of large megafauna
by Paleo-Indians in the western United States, coupled with the known presence of similar faunal
species in Northcentral Texas between 9000 and 7000 B.C. (see Slaughter and Hoover 1963), has
resulted in the popular (and logical) conclusion that ―big game hunting‖ was part of the PaleoIndian subsistence strategy in Northcentral Texas. However, the recent important excavations at
the Aubrey site have indicated that subsistence efforts did not focus on big game animals alone.
Rather, the occupants of the site used the entire range of prairie and forest species, including
bison, deer, rabbit, squirrel, fish, and abundant turtle (Ferring 1989; Ferring and Yates 1997).
Interestingly, although mammoth remains are present, their exploitation has not been
substantiated (Ferring and Yates 1997). Whether this pattern of a more generalized foraging
subsistence system is characteristic of Clovis adaptations on the fringes of the Eastern Woodlands
and that the focus on now-extinct, big game species is more characteristic of a Plains adaptation
remains to be documented; Ferring and Yates (1997:5) suggest that, in general, the Clovis people
probably employed ―very flexible adaptive strategies.‖

Archaic Period
The Archaic period in Northcentral Texas is tentatively dated between 6500 B.C. and A.D. 700.
As is true for many areas, a threefold division of the Archaic period, consisting of Early, Middle,
and Late ―subperiods,‖ has been applied in Northcentral Texas (Prikryl 1990). Thus, the Early
Archaic has been dated from 6500 to 4000 B.C., the Middle Archaic from 4000 to 1500 B.C., and
10

the Late Archaic from 1500 B.C. to A.D. 700 (recent overviews that cover the Archaic in this
portion of Texas include Hofman 1989a; Prikryl 1990; and Story 1985, 1990). Archaic remains
are usually found in upland settings and are frequently mixed with later material. In fact, the
initial treatments of the Archaic period in Northcentral Texas that defined the Carrollton and
Elam foci (Crook and Harris 1952, 1954) were based upon materials from such mixed terrace
contexts. Consequently, these time-space constructs are no longer recognized as being acceptable
for this area of Texas (Peter and McGregor 1988; Prikryl 1990; Yates and Ferring 1986). General
trends that have been proposed as characterizing the Archaic period in Northcentral Texas
suggest increasingly complex settlement systems, increasing population size and density,
gradually decreasing mobility, and development of distinct group territories (Prikryl 1990; Story
1985:52).

Late Prehistoric Period
The beginning of what is called the Late Prehistoric period in the upper Trinity River basin (ca.
A.D. 700–1600) is marked by the initial appearance of arrow points. The A.D. 700 date for the
start of this period is based upon dated contexts for similar material in the Brazos River drainage
to the west. Both Lynott (1977) and Prikryl (1990) have proposed that the Late Prehistoric period
be divided into an early and a late phase: the early phase reflecting a continuation of the foraging
subsistence system of the preceding Late Archaic period, and the late phase reflecting Southern
Plains influences. In this view, the early phase dates between A.D. 700 and 1200 and is
characterized by sand- and grog-tempered ceramics and by Scallorn, Steiner, Catahoula, and Alba
arrow points (Lynott 1977; Prikryl 1990). The late phase dates from A.D. 1200 to 1600 and is
associated with the appearance of Nocona Plain ceramics of the Henrietta focus, various
unstemmed triangular points (e.g., Maud, Fresno, Harrell, Washita), and the Perdiz point (Lynott
1977; Prikryl 1990). Evidence of horticulture and bison procurement also appears in sites of this
period (Harris and Harris 1970; Morris and Morris 1970).
Investigations at the Cobb-Pool site (41DL148) at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988)
have resulted in a reformulation of the Late Prehistoric period. The Cobb-Pool site has yielded
house structures, roasting pits, Alba points, grog-tempered ceramics, and charred corn cupules.
Radiocarbon dates from several features indicate the site was occupied during the late twelfth or
early thirteenth century. Present evidence suggests that the site does not represent an intrusive
Caddoan occupation; consequently, a significant adaptive change appears to have occurred, in at
least some areas, during a middle phase of the Late Prehistoric period. It is also likely that
ceramics were not introduced to the region before this time.
Whether the Cobb-Pool site merely represents a local experiment or reflects a regional adaptive
change separate from that emerging to the north remains to be fully documented; however,
analysis of a Native American burial salvaged along Spring Creek (site 41DL373) in Dallas
County also suggests maize consumption (Peter and Clow 2000). The individual was a female
around 50 years old. Radiocarbon dating indicates that this individual lived between A.D. 1155
and 1275; a carbon isotope ratio of -17.7 ‰ suggests that, although maize was consumed, it did
not form a major part of her diet (Peter and Clow 2000). These indications of maize consumption
contrast with a small grouping of disturbed human remains recovered from the Harbor Pointe site
(41DL369) in Dallas County (Cliff et al. 1996). This site, located on Rowlett Creek (a tributary
of the East Fork of the Trinity River) yielded remains of at least four individuals dated by
radiocarbon dating of bone collagen to cal A.D. 1010 (1035) 1165. No pottery was recovered
11

with these remains, although shell beads and a shell gorget were present; and a carbon isotope
ratio of -21.6 ‰ suggests that the group’s diet was not high in maize (Cliff et al. 1996). Given
the slightly earlier date of the Harbor Pointe burials compared to Cobb-Pool and 41DL373, it is
possible that maize agriculture was introduced to the Dallas area ca. A.D. 1200; conversely, this
same evidence may indicate that divergent subsistence patterns were practiced by groups in the
Dallas area.

Protohistoric/Historic Native American Period
Within Northcentral Texas, the time from A.D. 1600 to 1800 has been designated the Protohistoric
period. Prior to the founding of New Mexico in 1598, the European presence in the Southwest
and on the Southern Plains had been sporadic at best—Coronado in 1540–1541, the RodriguezChamuscado party in 1581, Espejo in 1582–1583, among others. After 1598, however, Spanish
influence was never absent from the Southern Plains, although actual contact with Europeans
continued to be limited and there are only brief records of journeys into or through the area
(Hofman 1989b; John 1975). Despite this, it was not until the beginning of the nineteenth century
that the physical presence of Europeans on the Southern Plains became commonplace—the result
of increasingly peaceful relations between the Spanish in Texas and the Plains Indians to the
north, and the acquisition of Louisiana by the United States in 1803. Prior to about 1725–1750,
Apachean groups appear to have dominated the western portion of the Southern Plains, known as
the High Plains, while after this time the area was increasingly controlled by the Comanche and
Kiowa. On the eastern portion of the Southern Plains, within the area now known as the Lower
Plains and Northcentral Texas, the Wichita tribes became dominant (Bell et al. 1967; Hofman
1989b:91).
Unfortunately, since good historical documentation is very sparse for the upper Trinity River
basin during the Protohistoric period, it is not clear which specific aboriginal groups were
residing in the Dallas area at the beginning of this period. What is clear is that the Protohistoric
period in Northcentral Texas was a time of population fluctuation, movement, and amalgamation
(see Newcomb 1993). Available data suggest that many, if not all, of the aboriginal occupants of
the eastern margin of the Great Plains, which includes Northcentral Texas, were Caddoanlanguage speakers, from the Arikara in the north to the Wichita and Kichai in the south. In this
light, it is worth noting that it has also been suggested that the Socoatino, encountered by the
survivors of the de Soto expedition in the sixteenth century, were Caddoan speakers and were the
same group as the Canohatino, identified by the French in the latter part of the seventeenth
century, apparently located at that time ―on the Blackland Prairies between the Guadalupe and
Trinity rivers to the east of present-day San Antonio, Austin, and Waco‖ (Newcomb 1993:24). If
the prehistoric occupants of the eastern margin of the plains in Texas were indeed Caddoan
speakers, it would explain how they were absorbed very early by other Caddoan-speaking groups
(such as the Yojuane, Kichai, Tawakoni, Taovaya, Iscani, and Wichita proper) who arrived in
Northcentral Texas in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. Most of these groups,
in turn, amalgamated to form the historic Wichita Tribe, but some were probably absorbed by the
united Caddo Tribes, and some may even have joined amalgamations of a variety of groups, such
as the Tonkawa, during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.
The term ―Wichita‖ has been used to refer to a group of linguistically related tribes, including the
Wichita, Taovaya, Tawakoni, Yscani, Waco, and Kichai, many of whom apparently entered the
Southern Plains in the seventeenth century, probably from Kansas and southern Nebraska, to
12

escape the hostilities of the Osage (Webb and Carroll 1952:2:904). The Wichita were true Plains
Villagers, with an economy that was jointly dependent upon agriculture and bison hunting. They
occupied permanent villages of beehive-shaped, grass houses, from which they conducted
seminomadic bison hunts. In 1719, their villages were located along the Arkansas River in
northern Oklahoma (Hofman 1989b:95). By 1750, they had moved some of their villages to
southern Oklahoma, along the Red River. Others were located on the upper end of the Sabine
and Neches rivers in Texas, and subsequently on the middle Trinity and upper Brazos rivers. In
1772, the year they concluded a nominal peace with the Spanish, one of their villages was on the
Salt Fork of the Brazos on the Lower Plains west of Dallas (John 1975:Map 3; Webb and Carroll
1952:2:705). Wichita groups were included in treaties made with the Republic of Texas in 1843
and with the United States government in 1837 and 1856 (Webb and Carroll 1952:2:709). In
Texas, they continued to live between the upper Brazos and Trinity rivers until 1855, when the
Tawakoni and Waco were placed on the Brazos Indian Reservation, south of Fort Belknap, in
company with a number of other Native American remnant groups (Smith 1996; Webb and
Carroll 1952:1:212, 2:905). As a result of increasing animosity from white settlers, the groups
were subsequently removed to Indian Territory in 1859 (Smith 1996; Webb and Carroll
1952:1:210). The remnants of the Wichita moved to Kansas during the Civil War but returned to
Oklahoma after the war to settle permanently near present-day Anadarko (Hofman 1989b:95).
The Comanche were a Shoshonean group originally residing along the upper Yellowstone and
Platte rivers. About the beginning of the eighteenth century, they left those areas and began to
migrate onto the Southern Plains, where they drove a wedge between the Apache to the west
(driving them farther south and west) and the Pawnee and Wichita to the east. By the early
nineteenth century, their range was at its greatest extent, stretching from central Kansas to Austin,
and from Oklahoma City westward to Raton Pass in New Mexico. The most important divisions
of the Comanche included the Yamparika (root-eaters), who ranged along the Arkansas River; the
Kotsoteka (buffalo-eaters), who were just to the south of the Yamparika; the Nokoni (wanderers),
who occupied the territory along the Red River; the Quahadi (antelope people), located on the
High Plains; and the Penateka (honey-eaters), who were the southernmost Comanche grouping in
Texas (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:385). Their earliest known raid in Texas was in 1758, when
they helped in the destruction of the mission of San Sabá de la Santa Cruz in present-day Menard
County; and for the next 117 years, they waged intermittent warfare against first the Spanish, then
the Mexicans, the Texans, and, finally, the United States (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:385). The
Comanche were nomadic Plains hunters, whose lifestyle depended upon the bison as a source of
meat and raw material for clothing, shelter, etc., and upon the horse as a means of hunting and
transport. The Comanche were signatories to the Medicine Lodge Treaty with the United States
in 1867, in which they agreed to cede all of their territory except for a 5,546-square-mile
reservation in southwestern Oklahoma. Following a general uprising of the Comanche and
Kiowa in 1874, they were defeated by the United States army in 1875 and permanently confined
to their Oklahoma reservation (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:385).
Archeological remains that can be associated with these Protohistoric groups are rare compared to
the remains of earlier periods. Within the upper Trinity River basin, little evidence of these
historic Indian groups has been found, with the exception of a few Native American sites with
European items (Sollberger 1953). In actuality, all of these groups are better represented in the
regions that surround the upper Trinity River valley.

13

Groups of the Wichita Confederacy, being Plains Villagers, left much more substantial
archeological remains. A number of villages belonging to historic Wichita groups have been
identified and investigated in Oklahoma, in Northcentral Texas, and along the boundary of
Northcentral Texas and Northeast Texas (Bell 1984; Fox 1983:41–46). On the basis of
excavations at the Pearson site in Rains County, Texas, east of Dallas County, the Norteño focus
has been proposed for these historic Wichita components (Duffield and Jelks 1961). The most
extensive archeological work has been done at several sites along the Red River in Texas and
Oklahoma, near the present-day Texas town of Spanish Fort, which is believed by some to be the
site of the village attacked by Parilla in 1759 (Bell et al. 1967). The excavations at the Longest
site (34Jf–1) in Oklahoma documented the presence of a fortified enclosure and circular grasscovered lodges. Artifactual material recovered from these Wichita sites shows a mixture of
artifacts of Native American manufacture and of materials obtained in trade with the French or
the Spanish. Artifacts of Native American manufacture include triangular arrow points (i.e.,
Fresno, Harrell, and Washita), thick end scrapers on flakes, diamond-shaped beveled knives, Tshaped perforators, bifacial gun flints, bison scapula hoes, pottery elbow pipes, and Womack
Engraved pottery. Trade artifacts found to be present at Wichita sites include metal knives and
knife handles; axes; splitting wedges; kettle fragments; awls; chisels; scissors; buttons; flintlock
gun parts; bullets and shot; bridle parts; metal ornaments such as bells, finger rings, and bracelets;
and numerous trade beads (Fox 1983:45).
The pressure of the westward movement of Anglo-American settlers displaced numerous Native
Americans from their homelands north and east of Northcentral Texas. Delaware, Chickasaw,
Waco, Cherokee, Shawnee, Caddo, and Kichai sought refuge in Northcentral Texas. As the
Comanche and Kiowa attacked the less populated areas, skirmishes and raids were frequent in the
1830s.

Historic Context
The first European Americans to settle in the region settled along the Trinity River and its
tributaries as the frontier grew westward. The area remained largely unsettled until 1841 when
people, primarily from the upper southern states, were drawn there by a land grant known as the
Peters Colony. William S. Peters and the Texas Emigration and Land Company obtained the first
land contract in 1841 to populate the newly formed Republic of Texas. Over time, Texas
Emigration and Land Company obtained three additional land contracts, and the land grant
encompassed most of Northcentral Texas, including present-day Denton and Collin counties, then
part of Fannin County. Texas was annexed by the United States in 1846, and Denton and Collin
counties were established by the state legislature the same year (Lebo 1990; Odom 2001).
Following the presidential election of 1860, Texas, in common with the rest of the South, began
to consider secession. Although the fighting never reached Northcentral Texas, the Civil War
still inflicted hardships on the region (WPA 1992:55–58). Because most able-bodied men were
away fighting for the Confederacy, most small towns and villages were left unprotected and
fearful of Native American raids (Denton County History Page 2001). The result was an
eastward retreat of the frontier. The region also gradually became impoverished by the war as
food and other commodities became expensive and difficult to obtain (WPA 1992:55–58).

14

Although the region suffered economically in the aftermath of the Civil War, it was not as badly
affected as other areas of the former Confederacy. This greater economic vitality was fueled in
part by streams of immigrants from the rest of the country, who were hoping to make a fresh start
in the as yet unsettled West. Other elements in the economy included the nearby presence of one
of the cattle trails to Kansas and Dallas’s role as a center of the buffalo hide market (WPA
1992:60–70). Prior to the arrival of railroads, most farming was subsistence-based, although
cattle and horse ranching had become an important industry. After the introduction of the
railroad, cotton and wheat production were the major forms of agriculture (Odom 2001).
Nevertheless, by 1910 over a majority of farmers were tenants, many of whom were trapped in a
cycle of debt to the landowners (Green 1977:Table 8.16).
Rural populations began to decline during the 1930s under the impetus of poor climatic
conditions, hard times, the decreased importance of cotton as a cash crop, and the increasing level
of mechanization in agriculture (Lebo 1995b). After a mid-century decline, however, light
industry and retail opportunities reconfigured local economies.
Many Collin County
communities have developed into suburbs of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, and their growth
has been astronomical; the current population of Frisco, for example, is nearly 80 times the 1960
population (Collin County History 2008).

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS IN THE STUDY AREA
Four archeological surveys have been conducted within 1 km (0.6 mi) of the APE. These include
a 2000 Geo-Marine project associated with the 1460-acre Melissa landfill. The project
documented nine historic sites, four prehistoric sites, 11 historic localities, one prehistoric
locality, and 15 structures, though none were determined eligible for inclusion in the NRHP
(Clow and Hunt 2000). In 2001, PBS&J carried out a survey of the TXU transmission line
adjacent to the current APE, identifying and recording one prehistoric site, six historic sites, and
one site with both prehistoric and historic components; none were recommended eligible for
listing in the NRHP and additional work was deemed unnecessary (Cliff and Shortes 2001). A
reconnaissance survey conducted by Blanton & Associates along US 75 between CR 275
(Telephone Road) and CR 375 (County Line Road) did not yield any new sites, but areas along
Throckmorton Creek and the East Fork of the Trinity River were recommended for intensive
survey. Additional investigations were proposed, including archival research on the Governor
James Webb Throckmorton historic marker and the NRHP eligibility assessment of a barn
(Ringstaff 2005). Lastly, a survey for the 7.5-mile Melissa/Anna sewer interceptor pipeline
conducted by AR Consultants, Inc., in 2006 crossed the west end of the current APE, paralleling
Throckmorton Creek from CR 366 south; no sites were identified during the survey (Todd 2007).
A review of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas indicates that there are four archeological sites
within a kilometer of the APE. Site 41COL127, recorded during the survey for the landfill near
Melissa, consisted of historic farm buildings and structures; no additional work was
recommended for this site (Clow and Hunt 2000). Site 41COL142 is a multicomponent site
located immediately north of the APE in a parallel TXU electrical transmission line corridor.
Recorded in 2001, it consisted of tested cobbles, primary flakes, bottle glass, whiteware,
crockery, metal and brick fragments, and no further work was recommended (Cliff and Shortes
2001). Sites 41COL187 and 41COL189 were recorded in 2006 by the Collin County
Preservation Group. Site 41COL187, the homestead of Thaddeus Allensworth Parris, Sr., is
believed to have been built in the mid to late 1800s. As of 2006, the building was scheduled for
15

demolition by the landowner. Site 41COL189, which is immediately adjacent to the south side of
the APE along CR 365, represents the reported location of an old blacksmith and wheelwright
shop owned by Charlie Wysong. According to the Site Data Form available within the Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas, the initial recording effort did not involve any fieldwork at the site,
which consisted of a single wood post; the local informants consulted by previous researchers
commented that all artifacts ―had already been carried off‖ and the shop itself was ―completely
gone.‖

CHAPTER 4
RESEARCH GOALS AND METHODS

The cultural resources investigation documented in this report was undertaken with three primary
management goals in mind:
1. to locate all historic and prehistoric archeological resources occurring within the
designated APE;
2. to evaluate the significance of these resources in regard to their potential for inclusion in
the NRHP or designation as an SAL; and
3. to make recommendations for the treatment of these resources concerning the proposed
undertaking, based on their NRHP and SAL evaluations.
Ultimately, management decisions regarding cultural resources properties are a function of the
potential importance of such properties in addressing defined research needs. The assessment of
significance of a cultural resource property is based on federal and state guidelines and
regulations, which are reviewed below.

NRHP ELIGIBILITY
Cultural resources investigations generally are undertaken with the purpose of identifying
resources that are listed on or eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. Any cultural resource that is
listed on or eligible for inclusion in the National Register is known as a ―historic property,‖ and
the term ―eligible for inclusion in the National Register‖ includes both properties formally
determined as such by the Secretary of the Interior and all other properties that meet National
Register listing criteria (36 CFR 800.2). The criteria to evaluate properties for inclusion in the
NRHP are codified under the authority of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as
amended. These criteria are presented in 36 CFR 60.4 (a–d), which provides the guidelines used
to determine a site’s eligibility for inclusion in the National Register. Subsequent to the
identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions, these four criteria of
eligibility are applied:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design,
setting, material, workmanship, feeling, and association and
17

(a) that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of
our history; or
(b) that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
(c) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant
and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
(d) that have yielded or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history [36
CFR 60].

SAL ELIGIBILITY
At the state level, archeological sites may be considered significant and be recognized or
designated as an SAL, provided that at least one of the following conditions is met:
1. The archeological site is situated on lands owned or controlled by the State of Texas or one of its
political subdivisions; or
2. The archeological site is situated on private land that has been specifically designated as an SAL . . .
and fits at least one of the following criteria:
(A) Preservation of materials must be sufficient to allow application of standard archeological
techniques to advantage;
(B) The majority of artifacts are in place so that a significant portion of the site’s original
characteristics can be defined through investigation;
(C) The site has the potential to contribute to cumulative culture history by the addition of new
information;
(D) The site offers evidence of unique or rare attributes; and/or
(E) The site offers a unique and rare opportunity to test techniques, theory, or methods or
preservation, thereby contributing to scientific knowledge [Texas Natural Resources Code
1977; Title 9, Chapter 191, Texas Antiquities Committee, Section 191.094 and Chapter 41.7,
Antiquities Code of Texas].

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH
Prior to fieldwork, GMI personnel performed a search of the available data sources. Records
maintained by the Texas Historical Commission (THC) and TARL at the University of Texas at
Austin were queried to identify known sites within and proximate to the APE (within 1 km). A
literature review to obtain information from previous investigations and data from geologic maps,
soil surveys, and aerial photographs was undertaken. Historic maps—including nineteenth- and
twentieth-century county maps held in the Library of Congress and early twentieth-century soil
maps produced by the U.S. Bureau of Chemistry and Soils—were also consulted. Subsequent to
fieldwork, additional deed/title research was conducted at Haggard Library in Plano, the
McKinney Public Library, and the Collin County Clerk’s Office, as well as obtaining maps and
aerial images from the Texas General Land Office, the United States Geological Survey (USGS),
and the Perry-Castañeda Library at the University of Texas at Austin. Additional reference
materials, including books on regional architecture and building practices, were consulted also.

18

ARCHEOLOGICAL SURVEY
The archeological survey methodologies employed by GMI in the current study are in accordance
with the State of Texas Antiquities Code and the guidelines of the Council of Texas
Archeologists (CTA) as approved by the THC office of Division of Archeology and overseen by
the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO). The Department of the Interior guidelines for
addressing cultural resources were also followed.
Pedestrian transects were walked at 30-m intervals within the 7.4-km-long, 152-m-wide APE.
Much of the APE consists of active farmland with ground surface visibility up to 80–90 percent.
Therefore, instead of the 80 shovel tests per mile (16 per mile in each of the five 30-m transects)
recommended by the THC for low-slope, low-visibility areas, shovel tests were judgmentally
placed where drainage, soils, underlying geological formations, vegetation, and low levels of
disturbance suggested archeological sites might be preserved, with special attention paid to creek
banks. Erosion cuts in the creek bank were also examined. Shovel tests were approximately 30x-30-cm square and were excavated to subsoil or to 80 cm below surface (bs), whichever came
first. Soils for each shovel test were screened through 0.635-cm (0.25-inch) hardware cloth for
any cultural material. Diagnostic artifacts were collected and processed at the Geo-Marine
laboratory in Plano. All materials generated by this project will be permanently curated at TARL
in Austin. In addition, field notes detailing the survey conditions, landscape features, level of
disturbance, and initial interpretations of the cultural resources were maintained by the project
archeologist. Documentation for each shovel test included stratigraphy, soil characteristics, and
the presence or absence of cultural materials. Digital photographs were taken throughout the
survey to record the general topography, environmental conditions, current land use, and other
factors.

SITE CRITERIA
A site is defined on the basis of content and extent. When a shovel test yields cultural material,
additional shovel tests are excavated in a cruciform pattern at 5-m (16.5-ft) intervals around the
initial test until two sterile shovel tests are encountered in each cardinal direction. In the absence
of visible archeological features such as structural foundations, a site is defined within the extent
of positive shovel tests or surficial artifact scatters or both. For surficial materials or shovel test
contents, a site is defined as five or more cultural items of at least two different artifact materials
or classes (e.g., prehistoric stone tool manufacturing debris exhibiting different raw materials, or
manufacturing debris in combination with stone tools; or several different historic-era ceramic [or
glass] types, or ceramics in addition to glass) within a 20-m (65.6-foot) square. Cultural remains
meeting these criteria are designated as a site, recorded on a Texas Archeological Site Data Form,
and submitted to TARL. Conversely, the discovery of one or two cultural items (either surface or
subsurface) not meeting these criteria is considered an isolated occurrence of human activity and
is simply documented by location and content as a ―locality‖; likewise, historic-era material
representing an obvious single-event trash dump is not considered a site, with only location and
content documented.

19

FRAMEWORK FOR HISTORIC-ERA ARTIFACT ANALYSIS
The analysis of the historic-era material made use of four major analytical categories or classes of
artifacts based on South (1977), consisting of:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)

Domestic (and Furnishings)
Architectural
Personal
Activities
Indeterminate

Artifacts falling into the four major artifact categories—Domestic/Furnishings, Architectural,
Personal, and Activities—are divided into various subcategories. These subcategories are then
subdivided into various classes, types, and subtypes, depending on the type of subcategory and
material. In the case of ceramics and glass, these subtypes are associated with manufacture or use
dates whenever possible. The final category above—Indeterminate—is reserved for unidentifiable
metal, ceramic, and glass fragments (e.g., pieces of thin metal, burned/melted glass globules) that
are unclassifiable as to category.
The Domestic category includes artifacts related to food service (i.e., tableware and food storage,
including food preparation), metal, ceramics, and glass items associated with plates, serving pieces,
glass containers, cooking pots, etc. The Furnishings subcategory includes all nonfood service- or
nonfood storage-related household items such as furniture, stove, and lamp and table glass or
ceramic vase or figurine. An ―unidentified Domestic‖ subcategory subsumes the remainder of the
food-related items such as bone and shell. It should be noted that not all ceramics or glass artifacts
fall within the Domestic category; in some cases, artifacts of these materials belong within the
Architectural (e.g., window glass) or Activities (e.g., electrical insulators) categories. The
Architectural category includes all items that could be related to buildings or structures, such as
window glass, nails, brick, mortar and/or plaster, and ceramic tile or pipe. The Personal category
includes items of individual use such as clothing, buttons, shoes, doll parts, cosmetic bottles, snuff
bottles (identified on the basis of characteristics such as glass color, bottle shape, and lip shape),
musical instruments, and smoking pipes. The final analytical category—Activities —includes all
nonhousehold items such as those associated with transportation and farm-related equipment.
Activities category items include truck or tractor parts, harness buckles, fence staples, fence wire,
horseshoes or horseshoe nails, and firearms/weapons parts and cartridges. As with Personal items,
the Activities category often makes up only a small proportion of the overall assemblage of
identifiable historical artifacts from a site.

CHAPTER 5
RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

INTRODUCTION
GMI archeologists visited the APE in June 2009, beginning at US 75 and ending at SH 121 (see
Figure 2). Most of the APE is undeveloped and consists of pastures and cornfields with excellent
ground visibility. Five pedestrian transects spaced 30 m apart were surveyed along the length of
the APE and 121 shovel test units were excavated. The shovel tests were judgmentally placed
where ground surface visibility fell below the 30 percent threshold mandated by the THC, where
soils, vegetation, drainage patterns, and other factors suggested cultural deposits might be present,
and around identified historic-age structures (see Figure 2). Particular attention was paid to areas
where the APE crossed Throckmorton, Slayter, and Clemons creeks as well as two small
tributaries of Sister Grove Creek. Although no archeological sites had been previously identified
within the APE, three sites—two of historic age and one with both historic and prehistoric
components—had been previously recorded adjacent to it; portions of the APE near these sites
were examined closely.

FIELD SURVEY RESULTS

US 75 to SH 5
The west end of the APE, immediately east of US 75, is characterized by alternating lightly
forested areas interspersed with open pastures covered by short grasses. On the west and south
side of Throckmorton Creek, which runs diagonally NW–SE through the west end of the APE
before turning south (see Figure 2), the ground surface displayed evidence of unstable sediments,
including erosional scarps approximately 1 m high (Figure 3). In addition, topsoil in the grassy
spots tended to be very thin and hummocky, with high concentrations of limestone gravel (Figure
4). Cow bones were observed on the surface, leading GMI personnel to conclude that the
unevenness of the surface was probably also due to livestock disturbance. Therefore, shovel tests
in this area were generally concentrated in the thicker, clay-rich soils on and near the south bank
of Throckmorton Creek (Figure 5). None yielded cultural materials of any kind.

transition to clay with coarse gravel deposits at about 60–80 cm bs.

On the north and east bank of Throckmorton Creek, site 41COL203 (GMI CCL1) was found.
The site, which lies only partly inside the current APE, consists of two historic-age houses, a
carport, six nonhistoric-age outbuildings, and miscellaneous dump areas. Observed levels of
disturbance—including extensive modern dumps and apparent bulldozing along Throckmorton
Creek—did not permit the standard radial pattern of shovel testing, so units were placed
judgmentally around the site. Pastures to the west and east of the site had relatively high ground
visibility and were examined closely (Figure 6). No cultural materials other than modern surface
trash were observed. This site is discussed in greater detail below with two other historic-age
sites documented during the present study.
East of site 41COL203 and immediately west of Slayter Creek, the APE includes a narrow,
curved extension to the north and northeast (see Figure 2). This extension was surveyed and
found to be heavily disturbed by the dumping activity mentioned above, crayfish activity (Figure
7), and a recently constructed Melissa-Anna sewer line (Figure 8). In addition, the relatively
undisturbed portions of the extension consisted of actively farmed fields with high visibility
(Figure 9). Finally, the sewer line route was recently surveyed and no sites were recorded (Todd
2007). Given all of these factors, no shovel tests were placed in the extension of the APE, and no
cultural materials were noted during the survey.

East of the northern extension of the APE, Slayter Creek runs north-to-south across the main APE
before joining Throckmorton Creek (see Figure 2). Although background research on soils and
physiography (see Chapter 2) had led GMI investigators to consider the creek’s banks to be highprobability areas for archeological sites (e.g., see Figure 5), in this area they proved to be
extensively disturbed by heavy machinery due to wood-chipping operations (Figure 10) and
apparent dozing of modern trash into the creek (Figure 11). Several shovel test units were placed
in rare undisturbed areas near the creek. No cultural materials were recovered.

Figure 10. View east to discarded boat buried in wood chips on the west bank of Slayter Creek. Heavy equipment
tracks were visible near the wood chip pile, which extends for nearly 50 m along the creek bank.

Between Slayter Creek and SH 5, most of the APE consists of recently cultivated fields with up to
90 percent surface visibility, obviating the need for shovel tests (Figure 12). No cultural
materials were encountered during the pedestrian transects in these fields. GMI personnel noted
extensive crayfish disturbance and estimated the burrow concentration at approximately one per
square meter (Figure 13). Several shovel tests were placed in the limited forested and pasture
areas between fields; no cultural materials were recovered, and the soils became progressively
thinner and rockier toward the east, as investigators reached the end of the Quaternary alluvial
deposits and entered the area underlain by the Austin Chalk formation (see Chapter 2).
Portions of the APE near CR 365 were examined especially closely, given the location of
previously recorded sites 41COL187 and 41COL189 along CR 365 immediately south of the
APE (see Figure 2). West of CR 365, site 41COL204 (GMI CCL2), a small historic-age barn,
was identified. No cultural materials were found in radial shovel tests placed around the site,
which will be discussed in greater detail below. No trace of site 41COL189, the reported location

high-visibility cultivated field runs directly adjacent to site 41COL187, a mid- to late-nineteenth
century saltbox house and associated outbuilding (Figure 14). No cultural materials were
observed on the ground surface within the portion of the APE near the site.

SH 5 to CR 419
East of SH 5, the APE traverses a railroad track parallel to the highway (Figure 15), and then
nearly 3 km of cultivated fields (Figure 16). As in the fields described above, GMI archeologists
walked transects 30 m apart in these areas. Near the center of the APE, about 1 km east of SH 5,
investigators encountered Clemons Creek in a small patch of forest and pasture between
cultivated fields (see Figure 2). As with Slayter Creek, the area around Clemons Creek had been
noted in pre-fieldwork research as a possible high-probability zone. However, it proved to be
extensively disturbed. Where it crosses the APE, the creek is unnaturally straight and
consistently maintains a width of 3 m and a depth of 1 m, apparently the result of artificial
channelization (Figure 17). Still, three shovel tests were placed on each side of the creek, in areas
that appeared the least disturbed. No cultural materials were found.
East of Clemons Creek, the portion of the APE adjacent to previously recorded site 41COL142
was examined closely during the pedestrian transects. According to the Site Data Form linked to
the THC’s Archeological Sites Atlas, site 41COL142 consists of both prehistoric and historic
artifact scatters, with the former widely spread throughout a 200-m-long stretch of the electrical

No historic materials were observed within the current APE. As far as prehistoric materials are
concerned, GMI personnel observed many quartzite cobbles on the surface, some recently broken
by farm implements, but none that qualified as artifacts (in other words, none with evidence of
deliberate modification). The lack of modified material is unsurprising given the extremely low
density of artifacts recorded in the original Site Data Form: just one per 100 m2. The original
recorders of site 41COL142 did not recommend any further research; GMI archeologists concur
with this recommendation, with the caveat that this concurrence applies only to evidence within
the current APE, not to the site as a whole.
Directly across the APE from site 41COL142 is a small stand of trees that appears to have been a
dump associated with a farmstead; it is surrounded by fallen fence lines and includes historic-age
farm implements and truck components (Figure 18). Since the tree-covered area is outside the
APE it was not surveyed directly but was photographed from the south edge of the APE. GMI
archeologists did not observe any structures but did see historic-age glass fragments and other
materials along the south edge of the APE (Figure 19). The dump was designated Locality 1.

East of 41COL142 and Locality 1, high-visibility fields continue east for approximately 1 km.
Between the end of the cultivated fields and CR 419 (see Figure 2), the APE traverses several
extensively disturbed areas with bedrock at the surface, including a mobile-home park (Figure 20)
and a small ranch with evidence of major landscape modifications (Figure 21). Due to the extent
of previous impacts and the ubiquitous bedrock exposures, no shovel tests were placed in these
areas. No cultural materials were observed, other than modern trash.

CR 419 to SH 121
At CR 419, the APE crosses the first of two minor tributaries of Sister Grove Creek. The first
creek crossing has been disturbed by hog pens, barns, and associated debris on bedrock (Figure
22). Although in this area the creek is most often deeply incised into the chalk, scattered pockets
of soil were visible in cutbanks; these pockets were targeted for shovel tests (Figure 23). No
cultural materials were found in the 13 shovel tests placed in the area.
After traversing a chalk upland to the east of the first Sister Grove Creek tributary (Figures 24
and 25), the APE crosses the second (easternmost) tributary. The second tributary is broadly
similar to the first to the west, its channel deeply incised into the Austin Chalk (Figure 26). As
before, shovel tests were placed where cutbanks revealed significant soil formation (Figure 27).
No cultural materials were recovered.
East of the second tributary, the APE traverses chalk uplands with light grass and tree cover
(Figure 28). Although little soil is currently present in the area, vegetation differences indicated
the presence of several probable Depression-era erosion-control contour terraces. Approximately
250 m west of SH 121 and the eastern terminus of the APE, GMI archeologists discovered site
41COL205 (GMI CCL3), a historic-age farmstead with a late-nineteenth- to early-twentiethcentury house, an intact privy, and a possible root cellar. The site is discussed further below.

Newly Recorded Archeological Sites
Site 41COL203 (GMI CCL1)
Site 41COL203, originally given the GMI field designation CCL1, was recorded at the western
end of the APE, approximately 350 m east of the US 75 on/off ramp and immediately south of
CR 366 (see Figure 2). Since the road APE bears slightly south of CR 366 at this point, the site is
located only partially within the APE, the boundary of which passes between two unoccupied
dwellings (Figure 29). Overall, the site is an inverted ―T‖ shape: nine standing structures (two
historic-age dwellings, a carport, and six newer outbuildings) between CR366 and Throckmorton
Creek in an area roughly 100 m in length (N–S) and 50 m in width (E–W), intersecting with a
dump approximately 140 m in length running NW–SE along Throckmorton Creek.
The primary dwelling faces CR 366 and is a three-bay, side-gabled structure consisting of a
central block, a wing on each side, and a full-height, front-gabled entry porch protruding from the
central block (Figure 30). The porch has arches cut out of the three extruding elevations and
includes decorative metal support poles. The one-story, wood-framed dwelling is clad in
horizontal wood siding and has a white-and-gray corrugated metal roof. Windows on the front
elevations have been replaced with arched frames; the front screen door mimics these curves. A
brick exterior chimney is located on the east gable end. On the west elevation, a gabled-entry
stoop and concrete steps provide access to a secondary entrance. A large shed-roof addition

spanning the length of the dwelling has been added to the south (rear) elevation. Windows on
this elevation vary in size and location. An associated carport sits approximately 8 m to the
northwest of the main dwelling, facing CR 366 (Figure 31). The carport has a very low-pitched
roof with exposed rafter tails supported by nine posts and a rear wall and rests on a poured
concrete slab. The Collin County Central Appraisal District indicates the dwelling, covered
porch, and carport were built in 1945, but construction and materials appear to date to the 1930s.
A Collin County soil survey from 1935 confirms there was a structure on the site at that time
(U.S. Bureau of Chemistry and Soils 1935).

View southwest to carport (outside APE) associated with main house at site 41COL203

Figure 31. View southwest to carport (outside APE) associated with main house at site 41COL203.

A secondary dwelling, located less than 10 m behind the first dwelling, appears to have been built
in the 1940s (Figure 32). It is side-gabled, rectangular in plan, and oriented toward the west. The
gable ends are clad in metal siding, and the front and rear elevations are clad in horizontal
composite planks. The roof is clad in corrugated metal, and rafter tails are exposed. A frontgabled addition has been attached to the north elevation. The addition is clad in composite siding,
and its roof is clad in asphalt shingles. Two two-over-two windows are located on either side of
the primary entrance. A secondary doorway is located on the built addition on this façade. The
south elevation of the main dwelling contains three six-over-six windows, one single-framed and
one double pairing; a metal awning covers the paired window. A square cutout is located under
the roofline on both gable ends; the north elevation cutout has been filled, but the south-facing
cutout remains open. A shed-roofed porch supported by metal poles is located on the east (rear)
elevation and covers a rear door and at least one visible window. The addition also contains a
doorway and six-over-six window on this elevation. Surrounding landscape for this property
includes several trees (many growing close to the structures), grass, and a metal gate and fence
containing a side yard.

View northeast to second dwelling at site 41COL203 (inside APE)

Figure 32. View northeast to second dwelling at site 41COL203 (inside APE).

Six assorted barns and outbuildings are associated with this property (e.g., Figures 33 and 34).
The Collin County Appraisal District lists only one barn with a construction date of 1970, but it is
unclear which building this entry concerns. All six of the outbuildings are informally constructed
of posts, corrugated sheet metal, and scraps of other building materials and appear to have been
built in 1970 or later.
Within and around site 41COL203, much of the ground surface was disturbed and covered with
debris (Figures 35 and 36). In the pasture areas immediately surrounding the site to the east and
west, the ground surface was generally visible at a level greater than 30 percent (Figure 37).
Shovel tests were judgmentally placed in low-visibility, relatively low-disturbance areas and
along the creek bank, but did not yield any cultural material other than modern trash and debris in
the surface sediments.
Overall, site 41COL203 does not meet the eligibility requirements necessary for inclusion in the
NRHP or designation as an SAL. From an architectural-history perspective, the dwellings are of
historic age but are not associated with particular historical events or persons. In addition, they
do not represent particular types or styles and maintain a low degree of integrity. From an
archeological perspective, the data potential of the site is low, given the high level of previous
disturbance and the lack of cultural materials in subsurface contexts.

Site 41COL204 (GMI CCL2)
Site 41COL204 is located approximately 100 m west of CR 365 and consists of an early
twentieth-century single-pen, wood-framed barn situated on one parcel and surrounded by open
pasture (Figure 38; see Figure 2). A TXU Energy electrical transmission line corridor passes
60 m to the north. The structure, which is roughly square in plan and rests on a wood post
foundation, reflects elements of the Folk-style architecture characteristic of late nineteenth- to
early twentieth-century agricultural buildings (Figure 39; see Folk architecture discussion below).
Portions appear to have box-and-strip construction (consisting of vertical boards and wooden
strips), while others are clad in vertical, rough-hewn plank siding. The extended-shed roof is clad
in rusted corrugated metal, and rafter tails are visible; the roof seams do not connect at the
ridgeline (one extends beyond the other). A doorway with a simple wooden latch is located on
the southeast elevation; a hinged, screened opening is located to the right of the doorway. A vent
is located in a boarded-up opening at the gable peak on the same elevation. The southwestfacing, shed-roofed portion of the structure has only one complete exterior wall; the other two
sides contain low openings for livestock. This shed space is divided by a short corrugated metal
wall, which contains an opening. Remnants of old building materials hang from the rafters on
this elevation.
Shovel tests were placed in a radial pattern around the structure, two in each cardinal direction,
but no cultural materials were recovered. No other structures were noted in the area around the
barn, and no materials were noted on the surface. The site does not appear to be represented on a
1935 soil map even though it is adjacent to a major county road that was used at the time (U.S.
Bureau of Chemistry and Soils 1935).

Overall, site 41COL204 does not meet the eligibility requirements necessary for inclusion in the
NRHP or designation as an SAL. Although the structure at the site reflects design elements that
are characteristic of late nineteenth- to early twentieth-century Folk agricultural architecture, it
does not retain its integrity, nor is it associated with any other structures or materials with the
potential to yield data significant to either architectural or archeological studies.

Site 41COL205 (GMI CCL3)
Located approximately 250 m west of SH 121 (see Figure 2), site 41COL205 (GMI CCL3)
consists of a 40-x-70-m, T-shaped area enclosing a probable tenant farmstead. The site includes a
standing, unoccupied dwelling, a standing outbuilding (outhouse), the possible remains of a root
cellar, and a sheet midden of glass, ceramics, and metal fragments (Figure 40).

The dwelling is a single-pen structure with one-and-a-half stories, elements characteristic of Folkstyle farm architecture (see Folk architecture discussion below), which appears to date to the
early-twentieth century (Figure 41). The structure rests on a wood post foundation and is clad in
horizontal plank siding; box-and-strip construction (consisting of vertical boards and wooden
strips) can be seen beneath the plank siding in several areas. The dwelling appears to have been
painted white at one time, but is mostly bare wood now. Metal siding or flashing covers portions
of the western elevation. Corner boards are mostly intact, and corrugated metal is attached as
skirting in some places. The extended-shed roof is clad in rusted corrugated metal; an interior

brick chimney is located on the northwest (rear) slope. Wooden window surrounds remain, but
sashes are missing. The dwelling's primary façade includes one doorway (and remnants of a
wood door), and what appears to be a window covered with corrugated metal. The rear (north)
elevation contains one left-of-center doorway and no window openings; steps or a stoop to access
this doorway have since been removed. The east elevation has three openings for windows, two
on the first floor and one in the gable peak, but the west elevation has only an opening in the
gable peak.
The outbuilding associated with the above dwelling is a side-gabled, wood-framed outhouse from
the same era (Figure 42). It is located under a tree approximately 30 m northwest of the dwelling.
The structure is clad in vertical plank siding and has a metal corrugated roof. Inside, portions of
the floor are missing, but a bench with two circular openings still exists; toilet seats have been
placed on top of the two holes. It appears the door to the structure has fallen off or been removed.
The structure is being overtaken by vegetation. Given that the Austin Chalk bedrock is
sporadically visible at the surface throughout the area, it is likely that the latrine pit beneath the
outhouse is excavated directly into chalk, ensuring the preservation of privy deposits with high
archeological potential but unfortunately also a high potential for hazardous content.
In addition, the remains of a possible collapsed root cellar dug into the chalk bedrock were
identified approximately 15 m northeast of the main dwelling (Figure 43).

A total of 45 shovel tests—generally less than 20 cm in depth due to the shallow bedrock—was
excavated at 5-m intervals in radial patterns around the structures and the possible cellar, with
further 20-m radials placed where allowed by chalk bedrock outcrops and the APE limits (see
Figure 40). When cultural materials were encountered, further radials were placed until two
negatives were found in each direction. Seven of the 45 shovel tests were positive, six of them
grouped tightly together north of the house’s rear entrance, indicating the presence of a sheet
midden measuring approximately 25-x-5 m. Materials recovered from the sheet midden include
items from Domestic, Personal, Architectural, Activities, and Indeterminate analytical categories
(Table 2). Some of the more diagnostic items consist of glass bottle and jar fragments of several
colors (ash tinted [post-1915], amber, aqua, clear [post-1880], cobalt blue, emerald green [post1930], and milk glass) including corrugated glass fragments characteristic of snuff and cheese jars
(post-1900) often reused as tumblers, light ivory-colored whiteware sherds (post-1920), and
various metal items such as wire nails (pos-1890) and crown caps (post-1892). A single Lincoln
penny from 1981 was also found. Though most of the materials have wide date ranges, even to
the present, the majority of the artifacts fall within the early to mid-twentieth-century age range
based on particular attributes (see Appendix A).
Although site 41COL205 has a relatively high degree of archeological integrity, the extreme
thinness of the soils (see Table 2) mean that the site’s archeological data potential is concentrated
primarily in the privy deposits and possible root cellar, rather than a more comprehensive
archeological record (see, e.g., Lebo 1992, 1995a, 1996). As the house contains evidence of use
up to at least the 1970s or 1980s (for instance, beer advertisements from that time used as
wallpaper), the privy likely contains recent waste on top of any archeologically relevant deposits,
presenting an unacceptable biohazard risk for further work. The root cellar, then, is the only
other subsurface feature identified during this study with significant potential for additional
archeological investigations that are both safe and productive1.
The dwelling reflects design elements that are characteristic of late nineteenth- to early twentiethcentury domestic Folk-style architecture. It retains its integrity, has local architectural
significance, and represents a rare intact tenant farmstead in the rapidly expanding northern sector
of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. Although the recovered archeological materials consistently
demonstrate an early- to mid-twentieth-century occupation, this lack of earlier cultural materials
may be due to intensive twentieth-century use masking earlier components, a phenomenon
documented at the historic Niblo Farm (41DL352) in Dallas County (Hunt and Oliver 2009).

Archival Research
Additional archival research was conducted to determine the site’s significance in areas of
history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and culture. In addition to general inquiries about
the area and its development over time, research was conducted at the city of Plano Haggard
Library, specifically its collection of genealogy, local history, and Texana resources; the city of
McKinney Public Library, specifically its historic census records and Collin County resources;

1

GMI initially recommended judgmental placement of additional shovel test units throughout site
41COL205, with several concentrated around the possible root cellar and inside the apparent entrance.
THC subsequently recommended detailed archival research be conducted prior to any additional shovel
testing (THC letter August 25, 2009).

Land History
The land on which site 41COL205 is situated was part of the original December 1849 land grant
to Hiram Brinlee (Collin County 2009; Hamilton 1881). Hiram Brinlee and Elizabeth McKinney
(niece of Collin McKinney, namesake of both the city of McKinney and Collin County) married
in 1832 and lived in Red River County until moving south to Collin County (Pitts and Champ
1994:47). Hiram was a farmer and a slave owner, and he built and owned a general store in
Stoney (also spelled ―Stony‖) Point, a community south of the Hiram Brinlee Survey (Turner
Publishing Company 1995:45). Gaining his original headright certificate in 1838, Hiram
Brinlee’s survey included 1,622 acres of land in Collin County (Figure 44).

Office, Map No. 3416).

The earliest deeds on record at the Collin County Clerk’s office, including the earliest reference
of land transfer for this property, are in Deed Book B. Appendix B contains the details of the
deed history for site 41COL205. On December 13, 1847, Hiram Brinlee deeded 1,280 acres to
Joseph and George P. Carroll (Deed Book B). The Carroll family has had ownership of parts of
this land continuously for more than 150 years. However, in 1852, 590 acres of the 1,280 owned
by the Carroll men—including the land on which site 41COL205 is situated—were deeded to
Thomas Morton (T. M.) Scott (Figure 45). The land remained in the Scott family until 1925.
T. M. Scott, originally from Kentucky, served as a Sergeant Major in the First Kentucky Infantry
during the Mexican War. Scott served as First Lieutenant for Company 1 of the 9 th Texas
Infantry before earning the rank of Captain after the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862 (Hall
2007:125). Captain Scott married Elizabeth Matilda Shirley (also spelled ―Sherley‖), daughter of
Lewis Shirley, a soldier in the War of 1812 (Hall 2004:257). William Sherley, one of Matilda’s
brothers, is listed on land maps as owning a tract of land northeast of the Scott property.

to T. M. Scott in 1852 (Google 2010).

The Scotts, who married in 1850, moved to Texas two years later (Hall 2007:125). Captain Scott
purchased a farm he called ―Belmont Farm,‖ which was located about 4 miles east of Melissa. 2 It
was noted that a log schoolhouse was erected on this property as well, and that Mrs. T. M. Scott
taught at this school. S. O. Scott, son of T. M. and Elizabeth Matilda, attended this school in
1862. He described the schoolhouse as follows:
It had no windows, got light from the cracks between logs. Slab floor, split log seats without
backs or desks, heated by a fireplace, water from Shultz Springs about a half mile south of the
cabin. Located about 12 miles northeast of McKinney [Hall 2007:125].

In addition to the schoolhouse, S. O. Scott claimed that his father’s residence was built between
1858 and 1859 and was located 3 miles southeast of Anna; this land was later conveyed to S. O.
in 1916. As Scott described the house, ―It is a box house and lumber was hauled from Piney
Woods of East Texas, and it is hand planed and tongued and grooved by hand and put together
with square wrought iron nails‖ (Hall 2007:125).

2

Belmont Farm was still in existence in 1878, because records exist from that time of T. M. Scott
observing a solar eclipse from that location; it is unknown, however, if Belmont is associated with the
farmstead currently under investigation (Abbe 1878:90).

S. O. Scott described another house that very closely mimics the design and style of the
41COL205 dwelling standing today. In 1867, he attended school in an ―old residence with a side
room, built of clap boards, one room and slab floor, shed room, dirt floor‖ (Hall 2007:125). The
home, he said, was built by William Sherley, his uncle, in 1852 (Hall 2007:125).
In 1925, Scott conveyed 100 acres of the 590-acre tract—including the land on which the
41COL205 dwelling is situated—to B. W. Wright, who is buried along with his wife in the
Brinlee Cemetery just south of the dwelling today; Wright then conveyed the land to the Federal
Land Bank of Houston. In 1938, the 100-acre tract was conveyed back to the Carroll family, this
time to Wilbur L. Carroll and his wife Modene. The land, in various tracts, stayed with the
Carroll family until 2005, when it was deeded to 545 SE Melissa, a corporation, via Special
Warranty Deed. Special Warranty Deeds are used for a variety of purposes, but they are most
often used in property transfers where the grantor (the seller) did not use or occupy the land for a
significant period of time. It is assumed this was the case with the 41COL205 property.
Over time, the tracts of land changed size with ownership. The property with site 41COL205
became part of a 10-acre tract owned by Wilbur and Modene Carroll (Figure 46). In 1975, a
ranch-style house was built toward the front of the 10-acre tract, facing SH 121. It is possible that
an earlier dwelling existed at or near this location at that time—and was moved for the
construction of this new home—or at a later date.
Wilbur L. Carroll died in 1976; his address was listed as 9425 Highway 121 North, Anna, Texas,
and his occupation listed as farmer and rancher. Later, that 10-acre tract became part of a larger
division, including a 4.98-acre tract facing State Highway 121, a 12.09-acre tract, which includes
the 41COL205 property, and 24.93 acres of native pastureland (Collin County Central Appraisal
District). The 12.09-acre tract reflects the property obtained by the Collin County Toll Road
Authority and is highlighted in Figure 47.
It is clear from aerial images that the dwelling at site 41COL205 was moved to the current
location between 1989 and 1991. The original location for this dwelling, from which it was
relocated, is unknown, but given its architecture, materials and its similarities to other mid- to
late-1800s structures in the area, it most likely did not travel far.
The 1963 USGS 7.5' Anna quadrangle shows a barn structure on the land, but no dwellings
(Figure 48). No structures corresponding to the estimated location of site 41COL205 are visible
on a 1935 soil map (U.S. Bureau of Chemistry and Soils 1935). Nevertheless, this lacuna may
reflect the logistical limitations of the soil survey—for example, the site’s distance from major
roads—rather than an actual absence of buildings at the time of the survey (U.S. Bureau of
Chemistry and Soils 1935). Aerial images from 1952 and 1957 confirm the presence of a large,
rectangular barn northwest of the current location of the dwelling (Figure 49). This can best be
seen in a later aerial image (Figure 50). However, these aerial images do not show any structures
at the location of the dwelling. One or more additional structures of unknown association are
located, however, at the front of the property near present-day SH 121. It is possible that the
site’s dwelling was in fact located near the front of the property and moved to the rear after the
construction of the 1975 ranch dwelling, but this does not explain its ommission from the
topographic map. The barn does not appear in aerial images from the early 1990s; however, thick
underbrush makes it difficult to determine the exact year of its removal. The barn does not exist
today.

Folk Architecture
Although it is known that the dwelling located on site 41COL205 (see Figure 41) at the
approximate address of 9425 State Highway 121, in Anna, Texas, was moved to this location
between 1989 and 1991, this does not diminish the architectural merit of the structure. Folk
architecture is valuable not for its formal designs or impressive detailing, but rather for its simple,
functional elements designed by those not formally trained in the architectural profession. The
style speaks to the influences of the human element—weather, climate, native vegetation, and
terrain—that is imprinted on the walls, ceilings, and floors of these primitive structures (Jordan
1978:3–4). This style is, perhaps more than any other, a reflection of its time and its people.
Typical of Folk dwellings of the time, the one-and-a-half-story, single-pen structure with shed

Texas at Austin).

room at the rear on site 41COL205 is clad in horizontal plank siding; board-and batten, or boxand-strip, construction (consisting of vertical boards and wooden strips) is visible beneath the
plank siding in some areas. Siding of this nature is typically composed of cedar or cypress and
does not need paint to withstand the weather (Heimsath 1968:99). The roof was most likely
covered with rived boards (boards split along the grain instead of being sawn) or shingles when
first constructed but covered with sheets of corrugated tin in the early 1900s, as was common at
the time. Tin, by comparison, was cheaper and easier to lay and thus more practical (Abernethy
1979:150).
Though the building is not log-framed, it does rest on log piers, as does the outhouse located to
the rear of the dwelling. This construction is typical of Folk architecture of the South, where the
homes were usually elevated on brick, stone, or tree-trunk piers (Handbook of Texas Online
2010a). The building was most likely balloon-framed, a construction style that debuted in Texas
after the arrival of many settlers (Abernethy 1979:35). The balloon-framed house could be
constructed by two people using light-weight, precut 2-x-4-inch studs set in at approximately 16
inches apart and fastened by factory-produced nails, as opposed to the earlier more traditional
method of constructing an entire wall flat on the ground (using stout hardwood beams held
together with heavy mortise-and-tenon joints fastened with hand-wrought nail or hand-cut dowel)
prior to the finished wall being lifted into place by a crew of approximately 20 (Balloon Framed
Houses 2010). Although largely ignored in comparison to its log-framed counterpart, the
balloon-framed house represented an important construction technique because it provided a
cheaper, faster option for builders. To add stability to these board-and-batten houses, horizontal

sealing boards were used on the inside walls, as is evident in parts of the 41COL205 dwelling.
Although balloon construction was not widely popular until the 1870s in Texas, it is plausible that
some areas began using the technique much earlier.
The 41COL205 Folk dwelling also reflects German influences, which are seen throughout parts
Texas and represent a significant immigrant group. It is clear that at least one family in the
vicinity—the Sherley/Shirley family—was influenced by German heritage; Lewis Sherley’s
second wife was of German descent, and they were already married when they came to this area
of Texas in 1853 (St. Clair and St. Clair 1982:33). Most notably, the dwelling exhibits a
Teutonic, or saltbox, roof profile created by the continuation of the slope down and over the shed
room (Handbook of Texas Online 2010b). The front door of the single-pen house was often
displaced toward one side or the other in German architecture, and that element is echoed in this
dwelling. The dwelling has a small chimney in the front room with a hole for a stove connection,
a common trait of German homes, rather than an open hearth. Additionally, the stairway is
tucked away in a corner adjacent to the fireplace, as many German stairways were (Jordan
1978:133).

Single-pen dwellings of this size often suggest lower socioeconomic status, and their simplicity of
materials and construction is characteristic of poor agricultural districts (Jordan 1978:107).
Dwellings such as this often housed tenant farmers or enslaved people. It is known that three of
the original landowners—Hiram Brinlee, George P. Carroll, and Thomas M. Scott, as well as
surrounding property owners such as Lewis and Albert Sherley, all owned slaves in 1860 (United
States Census 1860). Thomas M. Scott, who owned the specified tract of land in 1860, had six
slaves and one slave house at that time. Because homes of low-property-value were rarely
recorded in wills or deeds, it is unknown where this slave house was located historically, or if it
could possibly be the house located on this tract of land today.
The dwelling could also represent a tenant farmstead, because the majority of Collin County
residents were farmers at the turn of the century (Brown 1997). Indeed, the county’s percentage
of tenant farmers reached 74 percent by 1925 (Handbook of Texas Online 2010c). Dominant
crops were cotton, corn, oats, and wheat (Brown 1997). Tenant houses ranged from one to four
rooms, with the poorest living in single-pen houses with a shed kitchen (Brown 1997). By
definition, tenant houses were nonpermanent residences, so they were often altered over the
years. Also, older structures were often recycled for a different use or moved to another location
as the owner deemed necessary; farmers would use wood logs for foundations and repair the
sawn lumber if necessary (Brown 1997). For this reason, it is difficult to trace the history of such
buildings.

Regional Examples of Similar Folk Architecture
Located in the same project area, approximately 100 m west of CR 345 in Anna, the structure on
site 41COL204 (see Figure 39) also reflects design elements that are characteristic of late
nineteenth- to early twentieth-century agricultural Folk architecture. The structure is a singlepen, wood-framed barn situated on a single parcel and surrounded by native pastoral land. The
simplicity of construction and functionality of many of its architectural elements suggest an
agricultural association. Like the dwelling on site 41COL205, the barn is clad in vertical, roughhewn plank siding with portions of box-and-strip construction visible underneath. Its extendedshed roof is clad in corrugated tin, giving the two structures remarkably similar profiles (Figure
39).
Of note is another similar structure located in southern Texas, in Brazoria County. The first
capitol building of the Republic of Texas (Figure 51) was built in 1833 and shares many
similarities—including architectural style, materials, and massing—with the 41COL205 dwelling
(see Figure 41). The original capitol building was lost in a storm in 1900, but a replica was built

near the site of its original construction in 1976 (Figure 52). The original story-and-a-half
clapboard structure with an extended-shed roof was built by Leman Kelsey and became the
capitol of the Republic of Texas in 1836 (Texas Historical Marker 1979).

Summary
In summary, archival research indicates that the land on which site 41COL205 is situated was
part of the original December 1849 land grant to Hiram Brinlee and included 1,622 acres of land
in Collin County. In December 1847, Brinlee deeded 1,280 acres to Joseph and George P.
Carroll, and the Carroll family had ownership of parts of this land continuously for more than 150
years. However, in 1852, 590 acres of the 1,280 owned by the Carroll men—including the land
on which site 41COL205 is situated—were deeded to T. M. Scott, and the land remained in the
Scott family until 1925. In 1925, Scott conveyed 100 acres of the 590-acre tract—including the
land on which the 41COL205 dwelling is situated—to B. W. Wright, who then conveyed the land
to the Federal Land Bank of Houston. In 1938, the 100-acre tract was conveyed back to the
Carroll family, in whose ownership the land, in various tracts, remained until 2005, when it was
deeded to 545 SE Melissa, a corporation, via Special Warranty Deed. The 12.09-acre tract on
which site 41COL 205 is situated was subsequently obtained by the Collin County Toll Road
Authority in 2009.

Archival research indicates that the dwelling on site 41COL 205 was most likely moved to its
current location sometime after 1989 and before 1991, though the exact original location is
unknown. It is possible that a different residential structure was located in this area but was
removed or destroyed prior to the earliest aerials (1952) or the 1963 topographic map, or that on
earlier maps, a structure was too far removed from the road to be adequately mapped. Regardless
of its location, the building is architecturally significant for its association with the Folk style.

CHAPTER 6
SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

In June 2009, GMI conducted archeological investigations along a 4.6-mi (7.4-km) section of the
proposed Collin County Outer Loop, a truck reliever road between US 75 and SH 121 in
northeast Collin County. The APE is 500 ft (152 m) wide and consists of sparsely populated land
used for farming and ranching, both historically and currently. Five pedestrian transects 30 m
(98 ft) apart traversed the APE. Because much of the APE consists of high-visibility cultivated
fields, the survey transects with 121 excavated shovel test units were sufficient to examine the
APE. The shovel tests were excavated in lower-visibility portions of the APE, near creeks, and
near previously identified sites. Four historic-age archeological resources—three sites,
41COL203, 41COL204, and 41COL205, and one locality—were documented within the APE.
The three sites were recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP or for designation as an
SAL, and the locality is not eligible because it does not satisfy the definition of a site.
Site 41COL203 consists of nine standing structures (two historic-age dwellings and a carport, as
well as newer outbuildings) between CR 366 and Throckmorton Creek. Site 41COL204 is an
early-twentieth-century, single-pen, wood-framed barn surrounded by open pasture. No artifacts
were found at either site, and both are considered ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for
designation as an SAL. Locality 1 is a dump containing historic-age farm implements and truck
components just outside the APE, and because it fails to meet the criteria for a site cannot be
considered for National Register inclusion.
Of the 121 shovel tests, the seven that yielded cultural materials were all at newly discovered site
41COL205, a historic-age tenant farmstead. The site includes a standing single-pen structure of
one-and-a-half-stories and an extant outbuilding (outhouse), the possible remains of a root cellar,
and glass, ceramics, and metal fragments. The results of the archival research indicate that the
dwelling was most likely moved to this current location sometime after 1989 and before 1991,
though the exact original location is unknown. The archeological materials recovered from
behind the dwelling indicate an early to mid-twentieth century (1920–1940s) occupation, likely
that of a tenant farmer. No archeological materials dating prior to 1900 were identified. It is
possible that a different residential structure was located in this area but was removed or
destroyed prior to the earliest aerials (1952) or the 1963 topographic map. Alternatively, it is
possible that on earlier maps a structure was too far removed from the road to be adequately
mapped. Either way, the artifacts recovered, the presence of a possible storm/root cellar, and the
privy indicate a post-1900 occupation, and the earliest aerial photographs indicate no structure in
this location prior to 1952.
61

The site retains good contextual integrity with three extant structures and little evidence of
disturbances, but additional investigations at the site would have likely yielded redundant
information about lifeways of this time period—the early to mid-twentieth century—in the
general region (see for example Brown and Lebo 1991; Jurney, Lebo, and Green 1988; Lebo
1995a, 1995b; Moir and Jurney 1987). Therefore, GMI originally recommended additional
shovel testing be conducted to aid in the site’s final eligibility determination. However, after
initial THC review of the survey report, THC recommended detailed archival research, which
was conducted, with the hope that the research would yield information that might indicate a
continuous occupation, or person of interest, or some other fact that would indicate particular
significance to the area, and then justify additional archeological investigations. Unfortunately,
based on the findings from the archival review, the need for further archeological investigations
was decidedly not warranted.
GMI initially recommended the dwelling at site 41COL205 eligible for listing in the NRHP under
Criterion C. Even though moved properties are typically considered not eligible for the NRHP,
this dwelling meets Criterion Consideration B, which states that ―a property removed from its
original or historical significant location can be eligible if it is significant primarily for
architectural value‖ (National Park Service 1997:29). Architecturally, the dwelling reflects midto late nineteenth-century Folk architecture. In addition, the dwelling provides an extant example
of Folk architecture associated with the agricultural practices that are rapidly decreasing in rural
areas of Texas. Although the precise historical use of the dwelling is unknown, it was
undoubtedly associated with farming in the area and thus represents an important theme in Collin
County’s history. The building retains a substantial amount of its original materials, door
openings, and window openings and does not appear to have been significantly altered.
Overall, the dwelling reflects Folk architecture in form, construction techniques, and individual
features. However, THC determined that although the property is significant architecturally, it
cannot be determined eligible since the original location is unknown. The commission
recommended finding a recipient for the structure and having it moved to a new location if
possible. GMI supports this recommendation.
Thus, based on all of the evidence provided, 41COL205, as a whole, is recommended not eligible
for listing in the NRHP or for designation as an SAL.
