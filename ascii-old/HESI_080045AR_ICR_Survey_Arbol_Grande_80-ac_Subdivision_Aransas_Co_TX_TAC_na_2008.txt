MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

On 5 and 6 May 2008, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted an
intensive cultural resources survey of Texas Big Tree Holdings, LLP’s (TBTH) proposed 80-acre
Arbol Grande on St. Charles Bay subdivision tract located near Goose Island State Park in
Aransas County, Texas. Although the development is privately funded and located on private
property, any impacts to areas within the proposed development that are under the jurisdiction
of the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) will require a Section 404 permit issued by the
USACE. In addition, the proposed development may also require a Section 10 (a) permit issued
by the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). As these are federal permits, the undertaking is
also regulated by Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as
amended. Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted the survey at the request
of TBTH, in compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA. The purpose of the investigations was
to determine if any archeological sites were located on the property and, if any existed, to
determine their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
The intensive cultural resources survey within the 80-acre tract resulted in the
reassessment of site 41AS31, a small prehistoric campsite that was originally recorded around
1930. Horizon crews excavated a total of 15 shovel tests and 2 extensive backhoe trenches
over this site. Recovered materials were minimal, consisting of only 3 chert flakes from 3
separate shovel tests. In addition, the site has been previously impacted by the construction of
a swimming pool and the 2 associated concrete pads. Due to the sparse nature of the cultural
deposits on site 41AS31, as well as the prior impacts to the site, it is Horizon’s opinion that site
41AS31 is not eligible for inclusion on the NRHP and that no further investigations are
warranted on the site. Aside from site 41AS31, no other cultural resources were documented
on the 80-acre tract.
Based on Horizon’s opinion that site 41AS31 is ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP and
the negative survey results over the remainder of the tract, it is Horizon’s opinion that the
development of the 80-acre Arbol Grande on St. Charles Bay subdivision tract will have no
impact on significant cultural resources and that no further investigations are warranted.
Horizon therefore recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted for the undertaking.
However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial
features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing
maintenance of the tract, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the find

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the Proposed 80-Acre Arbol Grande on St. Charles Bay
Subdivision Tract, Aransas County, Texas

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of an intensive cultural resources survey of Texas Big
Tree Holdings, LLP’s (TBTH) proposed 80-acre Arbol Grande on St. Charles Bay subdivision
tract located near Goose Island State Park in Aransas County, Texas (Figures 1 through 3).
Although the development is privately funded and located on private property, any impacts to
areas within the proposed development that are under the jurisdiction of the US Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE) will require a Section 404 permit issued by the USACE. In addition, the
proposed development may also require a Section 10 (a) permit issued by the US Fish and
Wildlife Service (USFWS). As these are federal permits, the undertaking is also regulated by
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. Horizon
Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted the survey at the request of TBTH, in
compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA. The purpose of the investigations was to determine
if any archeological sites were located on the property and, if any existed, to determine their
eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
The cultural resources investigations consisted of an archival review, an intensive
pedestrian survey of the 80-acre property, and the production of a report suitable for review by
the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas Historical
Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council
of Texas Archeologists’ (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports. Russell
Brownlow (Horizon’s cultural resources director) served as the project’s Principal Investigator.
He and Jared Wiersema (Horizon field technician) conducted the field investigations on 5 and 6
May 2008.
The survey of the 80-acre tract entailed intensive surface inspection, subsurface shovel
testing, and the excavation of 2 extensive backhoe trenches. The Texas State Minimum
Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 1 shovel test per 2 acres for
projects measuring between 11 and 100 acres in size. As such, a total of 40 shovel tests were
required to meet the minimum survey standards. Horizon met these standards by conducting
exactly 40 shovel tests over the property. In addition, due to the deep nature of the sands on
the property, Horizon also excavated 2 extensive backhoe trenches over the sandy terrace
located within the eastern half of the tract where site 41AS31 was previously recorded around
1930.

Subdivision Tract, Aransas County, Texas

The intensive cultural resources survey within the 80-acre tract resulted in the
reassessment of site 41AS31, a small prehistoric campsite that was originally recorded around
1930. Due to its early recording date, very little information about the site was available aside
from location data and a brief description of the site consisting of lithic debris and shells eroding
from a small sandhill (Martin 1930). However, its location was mapped just northwest of “the
Big Tree,” a reportedly 1000-year-old live oak tree that is surrounded by the current property
(hence the name of the property as “Arbol Grande”). Local folklore suggests that the Big Tree
was utilized as a meeting location for Karankawa groups that inhabited the area. As such, it
was initially thought that 41AS31 might represent a sizeable Karankawan campsite. Although
Martin (1930) described the site as a sandhill with lithic debris and shell eroding out, thick
vegetation concealed any evidence of cultural materials eroding from the site. Fortunately,
Horizon’s shovel testing efforts aided in the relocation of the site.
A total of 15 shovel tests were excavated in the vicinity of site 41AS31. Of these, only 3
produced positive results consisting of 1 chert flake in each of the 3 shovel tests, suggesting
that the deposits were generally sparse in nature. No diagnostic lithic implements or ceramics
were recovered. However, because the shovel testing endeavors found the site to be covered
by deep sands that could not be adequately sampled via shovel tests, Horizon also excavated 2
extensive backhoe trenches across the site. These trenching efforts failed to produce any
further evidence of cultural materials on the site.
The reassessment of the site also found that the modern development of the property in
the 1960s has resulted in several impacts to the site including the construction of several
concrete slabs and a swimming pool that has been completely filled in and covered with
vegetation. Due to the sparse nature of the cultural deposits on site 41AS31, as well as the
prior impacts to the site, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41AS31 is not eligible for inclusion on
the NRHP and that no further investigations are warranted on the site. Aside from site 41AS31,
no other cultural resources were documented on the tract.
Based on Horizon’s opinion that site 41AS31 is ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP and
the negative survey results over the remainder of the tract, it is Horizon’s opinion that the
development of the 80-acre Arbol Grande on St. Charles Bay subdivision tract will have no
impact on significant cultural resources and that no further investigations are warranted.
Horizon therefore recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted for the undertaking.
However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial
features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing
maintenance of the tract, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the find
should cease immediately and the THC should be notified of the discovery.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The proposed 80-acre Arbol Grande on St. Charles Bay subdivision tract is located
roughly 1.2 kilometers (km) (1.0 miles) northeast of Goose Island State Park in Aransas County,
Texas. More specifically, it borders a parcel containing the Big Tree, a purportedly 1000-yearold oak tree, just west of St. Charles Bay (see Figures 1 and 2). It can be found on the US
Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute St. Charles Bay, Texas, topographic quadrangle (see
Figures 1 and 2). Generally speaking, the area near Goose Island State Park is currently a
popular location for new subdivisions and similar developments that cater to fishermen desiring
local accommodations, as well as those seeking coastal vacation homes. The proposed Arbol
Grande on St. Charles Bay subdivision, once developed, will feature a lodge where sportsmen
can stay during short-term fishing excursions, a small marina, as well as high-end houses. Onsite photographs of the property are provided in Figures 4 through 15.

2.2

CURRENT LAND USE

In 1961, the property was platted as the Big Tree Fly-In Ranch and was a planned resort
where tourists could “fly in” on their own small aircraft for fishing excursions in St. Charles Bay
and surrounding waters or for other recreational facilities at the resort. Interestingly, the survey
crews were also informed that the resort was also a nudist colony. As can be seen on the aerial
photograph of the property, a runway and hangar were constructed, several small living
structures were completed, and a canal was dredged to provide access for watercraft (see
Figure 3; see also Figures 8 through 15). In addition, the Horizon crew also found a filled-in and
overgrown swimming pool, a well head, and associated concrete slabs in the vicinity of the pool
that suggest some sort of recreational area associated with the development. Currently, the 80acre tract is vacant and not being utilized for any purpose.

2.3

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The 80-acre tract is situated on an upland area on the west bank of St. Charles Bay.
Topography on the majority of the property is generally flat, with the eastern edge of the
property sloping down towards St. Charles Bay and the northeastern portion of the property
sloping down toward an artificial canal (see Figure 2). Dredge materials from the creation of the
canal cover the areas surrounding the canal. Surface elevation ranges from approximately 0 to

VEGETATION

The majority of the 80-acre tract is covered by a variety of coastal grasses and forbs and
provided little to no surface visibility over the property. The extreme western extent of the
property is covered by dense stands of live oak trees, and several small oak mottes are also
present on the eastern portion of the property (see Figure 3; see also Figures 4 through 7).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The archeological record of Central Texas Coast primarily spans between the Early
Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods (7500 to 300 BP). Although Paleo-Indian materials such
as Clovis spear points have been found washed up on the beach along the McFaddin Beach
site on the Upper Texas Coast, Ricklis (1995) indicates that the earliest demonstrable human
occupation along the Central Texas Coast is assignable to the Early Archaic period. A brief
breakdown of this general cultural sequence for the Central Texas Coast is presented below.

3.1

EARLY ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 7500 TO 4200 BP)

Based on available radiocarbon assays, Ricklis (1995) divides the Early Archaic period
into 2 subperiods of occupation. The first, dating between 7500 and 6800 BP, is represented by
several sites in the Nueces Bay area. Cultural components typically consist of thin but dense
lenses of oyster shell resting at the base of Holocene soils. Although limited specimens of lithic
debitage and flaked shell tools have been recovered, other tools and preserved bone are
generally absent from these deposits. The shell deposits clearly reflect the exploitation of
estuarine shellfish, but the lack of preserved fish otoliths in the deposits may suggest that
fishing did not play a significant role in the subsistence economy of early groups on the coast
(Ricklis 1995).
The second period, dating between 5800 and 4200 BP, is represented by more
numerous sites than the previous period. Again, components from this period are represented
by lenses of shell deposits with generally sparse amounts of associated artifacts such as lithic
debitage and flaked shell implements. However, a variety of project points have been
recovered from deposits dating to this period, including Early Triangular, Bell, Andice, and
Tortugas points. A variety of fish remains have also been recovered from sites dating to this
period, suggesting that the coastal occupants were now exploiting both shellfish and fish
(Ricklis 1995).

3.2

MIDDLE ARCHAIC (4200 TO 3100 BP)

Ricklis (1995) indicates that there is a striking absence of radiocarbon data and shell
deposits dating to this interval. Based on this, he suggests that there was likely an apparent
hiatus in shoreline occupations during this period (Ricklis 1995).

HJN 080045 AR

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

3.3

LATE ARCHAIC (3100 TO 1000 BP)

The Late Archaic initiates when sea level stabilized at its modern position around 3000
BP. During this period, sites are more numerous, larger, contain thick shell middens, and have
a greater range and quantity of cultural materials, suggesting more frequent and intense
occupations than the previous period (Ricklis 1995). The dense quantities of shell deposits at
sites dating to this period clearly reflect a significant intensification in the exploitation of
estuarine resources, and an abundance of recovered fish otoliths from midden deposits also
reflects a dramatic increase in fishing. Faunal remains such as white-tailed deer and other
mammals and birds are also present at these sites. Ricklis (1995) indicates that the increased
economic importance of fishing during this time period can likely be linked to the emergence of
the modern estuarine environment were available vegetated shallows led to a considerable
increase in estuarine fish carrying capacity.
Diagnostic lithic implements associated with this time period include Kent, Ensor,
Marcos, Catan, and Matamoros projectile points. Bone implements are also prevalent,
consisting of bone pins, deer bone awls and flakes, antler points, and socketed bone points. In
addition to lithic and bone, the shell tool industry during this period was fairly diverse. Flaked
knives and scrapers made from sunray venus clam shells are present. Body whorls from conch
shells were utilized in the production of adzes, while conch columellae were crafted into
perforators, spear points, and gorges. Burned clay nodules and asphaltum fragments bearing
basketry impressions also reflect the clear use of basketry. Finally, the use of distinct
cemeteries appears to arise during this time period, suggesting the emergence of well-defined
group territories (Ricklis 1995).

3.4

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 1000 TO 250 BP)

Like other parts of the state, the advent of the Late Prehistoric period along the Central
Texas Coast is marked by the replacement of dart/atlatl technology by the bow and arrow.
While ceramics may have been present toward the end of the Late Archaic period, their use
also becomes common during the Late Prehistoric period. Based on radiocarbon dates and
distinctive assemblages, Ricklis (1995) divides the Late Prehistoric period into 2 subperiods.
The Initial Late Prehistoric period, dating between 1000 BP and 750 BP, contains
cultural deposits similar to those seen in the Late Archaic period except that dart points have
been replaced by smaller Fresno and Scallorn arrow points. Shell middens containing fish
otoliths represent a continued exploitation of estuarine environments, while recovered deer
bone also attests to hunting practices. As noted above, the use of ceramics becomes common
during this period, with plain, sandy paste pottery similar to Goose Creek ceramic found along
the Upper Texas Coast being the most prevalent during this period (Ricklis 1995).
The Final Late Prehistoric period, dating between 750 and 250 BP, is marked by the
presence of artifacts associated with the Toyah technocomplex, which includes thin bifacial
knives, Perdiz (contracting-stem) arrow points, small chert drills, and prismatic blades (Ricklis
1995, Ricklis and Collins 1995, Brownlow 1998). This technocomplex is potentially viewed as a
bison hunting toolkit (Ricklis and Collins 1995), so it is not surprising that bison bone is often

16

080045_arch_survey_report.doc

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the Proposed 80-Acre Arbol Grande on St. Charles Bay
Subdivision Tract, Aransas County, Texas

found within site deposits dating to this period. Plain, sandy paste ceramics have also given
way to a variety of ceramic vessel shapes, including cylindrical smoking pipes, that are often
coated and/or decorated with asphaltum (Ricklis 1995). The Rockport phase is characterized
by a combination of ceramics bearing asphaltum coating/decorations with Toyah technocomplex
materials along the Central Texas Coast. As with the earlier periods, flaked shell and deer bone
implements are present within the assemblage. Interestingly, Ricklis (1995) notes no major,
dense shell middens dating to this time period. Rather, deposits associated with this period are
often found draped over earlier shell middens and consist primarily of abundant fish remains
and artifacts, but only scattered amounts of shell. Because of this, Ricklis (1995) suggests that
fishing may have become so effective that shellfish gathering was only a minor subsistence
practice.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Archival research conducted online via the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
indicated that 3 previously recorded archeological sites are located within 1.0 km (0.6 miles) of
the 80-acre tract. The northernmost site, 41AS95, is a historic salt works associated with the
Civil War (THC 2008). It is located roughly 600 meters (m) (1968 feet) north of the property.
The southernmost site, 41AS29, was recorded as a prehistoric camp along the shores of St.
Charles Bay. Finds at this site include ceramics, arrowheads, broken spear points, debitage,
and bone that had eroded into the bay. It is located roughly 400 m (1312 feet) southwest of the
current property. Finally, the third site, 41AS31, is located within the boundaries of the current
property on a sandy ridge just east of the Big Tree (Figures 16 and 17). While site location data
was available on the Atlas, no site form was available as this site was recorded around 1930. A
description of this site in Martin (1930) is extremely short, consisting of the following:
Site 18. This is a small sandhill, much eroded by wind. Flint chips and a few shells
indicate a campsite (Martin 1930).

Aside from this, no other information about site 41AS31 was available for review. While this site
was recorded on the property during the early 20th century, no formal cultural resources
surveys have been conducted on the property according to the Atlas.

5.0 METHODOLOGY

A 2-person Horizon archeological field crew completed the intensive pedestrian survey
of the 80-acre tract on 5 and 6 May 2008. This was accomplished by walking random transects
over the extent of the property and consisted of subsurface shovel testing and surface
inspection. Generally speaking, the entire tract was covered with dense coastal grasses or
other vegetation that completely obscured the ground surface. As such, the field crew relied
heavily on subsurface shovel tests. However, rodent burrow spoil piles were visually inspected
for cultural materials. In addition, the field crew also visually assessed the coastline along the
eastern edge of the property to determine if cultural materials were eroding into the bay. The
Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 1
shovel test per 2 acres for projects measuring between 11 and 100 acres in size. As such, a
total of 40 shovel tests were necessary to meet the TSMASS. Horizon met the TSMASS by
excavating exactly 40 shovel tests over the property. All excavated matrices from these shovel
tests were screened through 6.0-millimeter (mm) (0.25-inch) mesh. Areas consisting of dredge
spoil deposits from the artificial canal excavated on the property were not shovel-tested due to
the thick deposits of spoil.
As will be reported in the following section, the shovel testing efforts served to re-locate
previously recorded site 41AS31, a prehistoric site located on a sandy ridge east of the Big
Tree. All shovel tests on this site were excavated to 100 centimeters below surface (cmbs) and
consisted entirely of fine sands. Due to the depth of the sandy deposits, the presence of
cultural materials below 100 cmbs could not be ruled out. As such, Horizon also excavated 2
extensive backhoe trenches across the site and over portions of the sandy ridge to determine if
any cultural materials were present below 100 cmbs. Each of these trenches measured roughly
30.0 m (98.4 feet) in length and 0.61 m (2.0 feet) in width. Both were excavated to an average
depth of 1.1 m (3.6 feet) where groundwater began to seep in and cause the sandy profiles to
slough. Excavated matrices were shovel-sorted and samples were also screened though 6.0mm (0.25 inch) mesh.
A non-collection strategy was employed during the survey efforts. Any non-diagnostic
cultural materials (e.g., burned rock, lithic debitage, etc.) observed on the surface or within
shovel tests were to be tabulated and described in the field and then subsequently returned to
where they were found. Diagnostic cultural materials (e.g., projectile points, charcoal, etc.) were
to be collected for analysis and further documentation. Field notes were maintained on terrain,
vegetation, soils, land forms, shovel tests, cultural material observed (if any), etc. Standardized

shovel test forms were to be completed for every shovel test, to include location data, depth, soil
type, and notations on any artifacts encountered. Digital photographs with a photo log were
also completed as appropriate. A handheld GPS unit utilizing the UTM coordinate system and
the NAD 27 map datum was used to record pertinent location data. The locations of the
excavated shovel tests and backhoe trenches are presented in Figures 18 and 19. Shovel test
data are provided in Appendix A.

Subdivision Tract, Aransas County, Texas

6.0 RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1

RESULTS

The intensive cultural resources survey within the 80-acre Arbol Grande on St. Charles
Bay tract resulted in the reassessment of 1 previously archeological site on the property
(Figures 20 through 23). Site 41AS31 was originally (and minimally) recorded by Martin (1930)
as a small prehistoric campsite that was evidenced by lithic debris and shells eroding from a
small sandhill. Its location was mapped just northwest of “the Big Tree,” a reportedly 1000-yearold live oak tree that is surrounded by the current property. Local folklore suggests that the Big
Tree was utilized as a meeting location for Karankawa groups that inhabited the area. As such,
it was initially thought that 41AS31 might represent a sizeable Karankawan campsite. Although
Martin (1930) described the site as a sandhill with lithic debris and shell eroding out, thick
vegetation concealed any evidence of cultural materials eroding from the site.
The site was originally relocated when 3 of 15 shovel tests excavated on the landform
containing the site each produced 1 chert flake (3 chert flakes total). These 3 chert specimens
were recovered between 20 and 60 cmbs. In addition to these prehistoric specimens, several
brick fragments, 1 bottle glass fragment, several metal fragments, and a deer-sized metapodial
were recovered from 1 of the 3 chert flake-bearing shovel tests between 20 and 100 cmbs. This
shovel test was excavated near 1 of 2 small concrete foundations that have been constructed
on the landform containing site 41AS31. Along with these 2 small foundations, Horizon also
found a nearby portion of the landform to contain an in-filled and overgrown swimming pool and
associated modern water wellhead (Figures 24 through 26). The proximity of the 2 small
concrete slabs to the swimming pool suggest that they and the pool comprise a recreational
area constructed during the initial stages of the Big Tree Fly-In Ranch that was platted on the
property in 1961. As such, they are considered to be modern impacts to site 41AS31 and do
not represent a historic component on the site.
In addition to the excavation of 15 shovel tests over the site, Horizon also excavated 2
extensive backhoe trenches along the north/south axis of the site (Figures 27 and 28; see also
Figures 18 and 19). These backhoe trenches produced entirely negative results, failing to
produce any additional cultural materials or reveal any observable occupational strata on the
site.

Chapter 6.0: Results and Recommendations

Based on Horizon’s 3 positive shovel tests and the original plotting of the site centroid in
1930, site 41AS31 measures roughly 100.0 m x 100.0 m (328 feet x 328 feet). It is comprised
of sparse amounts of prehistoric materials ranging between 20 and 60 cmbs. Aside from the 3
pieces of lithic debitage, no other cultural materials were recovered during the investigations.
The lack of identified temporally diagnostic implements precludes assigning the occupation of
the site to a defined temporal period. Although the proximity to the Big Tree suggested that the
site may have been a more heavily utilized site, the current investigations have shown the site
to consist of a low-density lithic artifact scatter that possesses little to no research value. Based
on the sparseness of the cultural materials, it is unlikely that the site could provide information
pertinent to the prehistoric past of the area. As such, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41AS31 is
ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP and that no further cultural resource investigations are
warranted on this site. Aside from site 41AS31, no other cultural resources were documented
on the property.

6.2

RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on Horizon’s opinion that site 41AS31 is ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP and
the negative survey results over the remainder of the tract, it is Horizon’s further opinion that the
development of the 80-acre Arbol Grande on St. Charles Bay Subdivision tract will have no
impact on significant cultural resources and that no further investigations are warranted.
Horizon therefore recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted for the entire
property. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or
burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing
maintenance of the tract, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the find
should cease immediately and the THC should be notified of the discovery.
