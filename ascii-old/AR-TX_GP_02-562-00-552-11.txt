ABSTRACT
The Sabine River Authority of Texas and the Sabine River Authority, State of Louisiana,
(collectively, the Authorities), own and operate the 81-megawatt Toledo Bend Project (FERC
No. 2305) (Project), located on the Sabine River in Panola, Shelby, Sabine, and Newton
Counties in Texas, and De Soto, Sabine, and Vernon Parishes in Louisiana. An original
license for the Project was issued by the Federal Power Commission, the predecessor to the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or Commission), in 1963. The Authorities’
existing license to operate the Project expires in September 2013. Consequently, the
Authorities are seeking a new license for the Project pursuant to the Integrated Licensing
Process defined in 18 CFR Part 5 of the Commission’s implementing regulations.
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (Section 106),
requires federal agencies to consider the effects of their undertakings on historic properties
listed in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places. The
Commission’s issuance of a license for the Project is considered an undertaking subject to the
provisions and review process provided in Section 106.1 The Authorities developed a
Cultural Resources Study Plan to identify historic properties within the Project’s Area of
Potential Effects that may be affected by Project operations and activities
The Project’s Area of Potential Effects has been defined to include all lands within the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Project boundary. In general, the Project boundary
encompasses the shoreline and submerged areas around the Project within the topographic
contour elevation of 53 meters (175 feet) above mean sea level. The Area of Potential Effects
also includes any lands outside of the Project boundary where cultural resources may be
affected by Project-related activities that are conducted in compliance with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission license.
At the Authorities’ request, HDR, Inc. (the Authorities' primary consultant for this
relicensing) retained HRA Gray & Pape, LLC to provide cultural resources management
services during the licensing process.
On February 5, 2010, HRA Gray & Pape, LLC submitted a pre-fieldwork report to the
Toledo Bend Cultural Resources Working Group (Working Group) with the results of an
intensive desktop study and background literature review (Soltysiak and Scott 2010). Based
on these results, HRA Gray & Pape, LLC selected a set of priority loci for reconnaissance
survey along the Toledo Bend shoreline within the Project’s Area of Potential Effects. On
February 19, 2010, the Working Group agreed on a total of 424 priority loci for inclusion in
the reconnaissance survey in Texas. These locations included 116 known archaeological
sites, 11 Texas cemeteries, 2 Texas Historical Markers, as well as 68 kilometers (42 miles) of

Texas and Louisiana state laws and regulations also may pertain to historic properties, including the Texas
Antiquities Code (Title 9, Chapter 191 of the Texas Natural Resource Code of 1977), the Louisiana
Archaeological Resources Act (Louisiana Rev. Stat. 41:1601 et seq and Title 25, Part I of the Louisiana
Administrative Code.

shoreline composed of 295 modeled high potential areas where Project operations or
activities may have been threatening the integrity of historic properties.
In Texas, the survey was conducted between April 19 and May 21, 2010 and again in July
2011. Field survey on land owned by the Sabine River Authority of Texas was conducted
with reference to the Antiquities Code of Texas under Permit #5568 issued by the Texas
Historical Commission on March 18, 2010. Field surveys carried out on federal property
owned by the United States Forest Service were conducted under Temporary Special Use
Permit # SAB002501, issued by the Office of the National Forests and Grasslands in Texas
on April 19, 2010.
As a result, a total of 22 new archaeological resources were recorded. Some level of
additional work is necessary at 103 of the 129 cultural resources. Conversely, HRA Gray &
Pape, LLC recommends that 26 known cultural resources be removed from further
consideration based on the results of survey. These 26 loci have either been destroyed as a
result of past landscape modification and/or erosion or are not in danger of potential Project
effects. Finally, a total of 23.7 kilometers (14.6 miles) of surveyed Texas shoreline are
considered developed. HRA Gray & Pape, LLC recommends that no further work be
required at the developed locations.
The results of this study have informed the development of the Authorities’ Historic
Properties Management Plan (HPMP) that was filed with the Commission concurrent with
the final license application. The HPMP will assist the Authorities in managing historic
properties within the Project’s APE throughout the term of the new license. The final HPMP
includes a process, methodology, and schedule for completing the additional studies at the
selected shoreline sites and high-potential areas within the project’s APE. A schedule for
finalizing the HPMP was included in the draft filed with the final license application.
At their request, the Authorities take possession of any artifacts recovered from Sabine River
Authority property, and will curate according to the HPMP. This report is intended to
document the status of field efforts accomplished by HRA Gray & Pape, LLC and to satisfy
permitting requirements for Antiquities Permit 5568. Artifacts and records associated with
Forest Service property are curated with the Forest Service, per their requirements. Records
from all other public lands are curated with the Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory.

INTRODUCTION

The Toledo Bend Project (FERC No. 2305) (or “Project”) is located on the Sabine River in
Panola, Shelby, Sabine, and Newton counties in Texas, and De Soto, Sabine, and Vernon
parishes in Louisiana. The Project was developed jointly by the Sabine River Authority of
Texas (SRA-TX) and the Sabine River Authority, State of Louisiana (SRA-LA) (collectively,
the “Authorities”) as a water supply facility to serve the long-term municipal, industrial, and
irrigation needs of the region. The Authorities operate the Project primarily for purposes of
water supply, and secondarily for power production and recreation.
The Federal Power Act2 authorizes the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC” or
“Commission”) to issue licenses for the construction, operation, and maintenance of
nonfederal hydroelectric projects. On October 14, 1963, the Federal Power Commission
(FPC), predecessor to FERC, issued an original, 50-year license to the Authorities for the
Toledo Bend Project.3 Construction of the Project was completed in 1969. The Project’s
current license, for which the Authorities are co-licensees, expires on September 30, 2013.
The Authorities are pursuing a new license for the Project pursuant to the Commission’s
Integrated Licensing Process (ILP), described at 18 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part
5. In accordance with 18 CFR § 5.17(a), the Authorities filed a final application for a new
license with the Commission on September 30, 2011.
In considering a new license for the Project, the Commission has the lead responsibility for
compliance with applicable federal laws, regulations, and policies pertaining to cultural
resources, including the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (NHPA).4
Section 106 of the NHPA (Section 106) directs federal agencies to take into account the
effects of their undertakings on historic properties and to afford the Advisory Council on
Historic Preservation (“ACHP” or “Council”) a reasonable opportunity to comment.
The regulations implementing Section 106 (36 CFR Part 800) define “historic properties” as
any prehistoric or historic period district, site, building, structure, or individual object
included in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (National
Register). This term includes artifacts, records, and remains that are related to and located
within historic properties, as well as properties of traditional religious and cultural
importance that meet the National Register criteria.
The Secretary of the Interior has established the criteria for evaluating properties for
inclusion in the National Register (36 CFR Part 60). In accordance with the criteria,
properties are eligible if they are significant in American history, architecture, archaeology,
engineering, or culture. The quality of significance is present in historic properties that
possess integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, or association
and:
A. That are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad
patterns of our history; or
B. That are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
C. That embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic

values, or that represent a significant or distinguishable entity whose components may
lack individual distinction; or
D. That have yielded or may be likely to yield information important in prehistory or
history.
Ordinarily, properties that are less than 50 years old are excluded from the National Register.
However, National Register Criteria Consideration G provides that properties that have
achieved significance within the last 50 years and that are exceptionally important on a local,
state, or national level may be considered eligible.
For this relicensing, the Authorities anticipated that the Commission will complete the
Section 106 process by executing a Programmatic Agreement (PA) for managing historic
properties that may be affected by issuing a new license for the Project. The Authorities
anticipated that the PA will provide for the Authorities to implement an approved Historic
Properties Management Plan (HPMP) as a condition of the new license. The HPMP describes
how the Authorities will consider and manage historic properties within the Project’s area of
potential effects (APE) throughout the term of the license.
In September 2008, the Authorities filed a Notice of Intent (NOI) to seek a new license for
the Project with the Commission. Concomitant with the NOI, the Authorities also filed a PreApplication Document (PAD) to initiate the ILP. In developing the PAD, the Authorities
requested HRA Gray & Pape, LLC (HRA Gray & Pape) of Houston, Texas, to conduct a
preliminary archaeological site file search. The report prepared by HRA Gray & Pape
identified several previously reported archaeological sites within the Project’s APE. This
information was summarized in the PAD, and a draft study plan to address cultural resource
issues was included as an appendix to the document submitted to FERC and distributed to
consulted parties.
Following the Authorities’ filing of the PAD and NOI, FERC issued Scoping Document 1
(SD1) on November 21, 2008 and convened scoping meetings and a site tour for agencies
and members of the public on December 16–17, 2008. As provided in 18 CFR § 5.11, the
Authorities developed a proposed Cultural Resources Study Plan to address identified
resource issues, study requests, and comments provided by agencies, stakeholders, Indian
tribes, and other interested parties. The Cultural Resources Study Plan was submitted for
comment to members of the Toledo Bend Cultural Resources Working Group (Working
Group), comprised of representatives of the Louisiana Office of Cultural Development
(LOCD), the Texas Historical Commission (THC), FERC, the United States Forest Service
(USFS), and federally recognized Indian tribes whose interests may be affected by the
Project. The Authorities developed a revised Cultural Resources Study Plan to incorporate
comments from the Working Group, and the Commission subsequently issued a Study Plan
Determination letter approving the Cultural Resources Study Plan on August 6, 2009. The
USFS and the Authorities continued consultation to resolve disputes associated with the
Cultural Resources Study Plan and the Authorities submitted a revised version of the plan on
October 9, 2009. On October 14, 2009, the Commission issued a Study Plan Modification to
include additional subsurface testing as a component of the field investigations associated
with this study. The October 15, 2009 Findings and Recommendations of the Dispute
Resolution Panel reaffirmed the modifications to the study plan that were mutually agreed
upon between the Forest Service and the Authorities.

In accordance with the approved study plan, HRA Gray & Pape produced a desktop-level
pre-fieldwork report that provided an assessment of the potential for archaeological resources
within the APE (Soltysiak and Scott 2010). That report recommended a sample of Project
areas for reconnaissance survey and was presented to the Working Group on February 5,
2010. The Working Group agreed on a total of 424 priority loci for inclusion in the field
reconnaissance survey in Texas. These locations included 116 known archaeological site
locations, 11 Texas cemeteries, 2 Texas Historical Markers, and 68 kilometers (42 miles) of
shoreline composed of 295 modeled high potential areas (HPAs) where Project operations or
activities may have been threatening the integrity of historic properties.

1.1

Project Description and Area of Potential Effects (APE)

The Texas portion of the Toledo Bend Project is located on the Sabine River in Newton,
Sabine, Shelby, and Panola Counties in Texas (Figure 1). The Texas portion of the Project is
located on a total of 21 United States Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute topographic
quadrangle maps. These include: Hurricane Creek, Hemphill, Negreet SW, Haddens, Milam,
Salter Creek, East Hamilton, Patroon South, Patroon North, Brushy Creek, Union Springs,
Huxley, Shelbyville, Logansport East, Logansport West, Beech Bayou, Galloway, Old
Center, Tenaha East, and Toro.
The Project is jointly operated by SRA-TX and SRA-LA through Toledo Bend Project Joint
Operations (TBPJO). Construction of the Toledo Bend Project on the Sabine River was
completed in October of 1966. The body of water formed by the Toledo Bend Dam is known
as the Toledo Bend Reservoir. The drainage area contributing to the Sabine River upstream
of the Toledo Bend Dam is approximately 18,622 kilometers (7,190 square miles). The
reservoir is approximately 112.6 navigational kilometers (70 navigational miles) long with
approximately 1,819 kilometers (1,130 miles) of shoreline at the reservoir’s full pool
elevation of 52.4 meters (172 feet) above mean sea level (amsl). At the full pool water
surface elevation of 52.4 meters (172.0 feet) amsl, the surface area of the reservoir is 74,866
hectares (185,000 acres). At full pond, the active storage capacity is 4,477,000 acre-feet (acft). Toledo Bend Reservoir is located in a topographically flat region and most of its
shoreline is gently sloping. Of the 1,086 kilometers (675 miles) of reservoir shoreline in
Texas, SRA-TX owns approximately 745 kilometers (463 miles) in fee title, with the
remaining 341 kilometers (212 miles) under federal ownership administered by the USFS as
part of the Sabine National Forest (SNF) and Indian Mounds Wilderness Area. Of this, 68
kilometers (42 miles), or approximately 6 percent of the Texas shoreline was selected for
survey during the field reconnaissance survey.
Additional Project components include a 3,429-meter (11,250-foot) long rolled earth-fill
dam, a 255-meter (838-foot) long concrete spillway, and a powerhouse containing two
43,875-kilowatt (58,500-horsepower) vertical Kaplan turbines. At its widest, the Toledo
Bend Reservoir measures 11.3 kilometers (7.0 miles) across. The normal maximum

elevation of the reservoir is 52.4 meters (172.0 feet) amsl. Recorded water levels have ranged
between 48.8 to 53.0 meters (160.08 feet to 173.9 feet) amsl (Authorities 2009).
As defined in the Study Plan, the Project’s APE includes “.... all lands within the FERC
Project boundary. The APE also includes any lands outside of the Project boundary where
cultural resources may be affected by Project-related activities that are conducted in
compliance with the FERC license” (Authorities 2009:4). The FERC Project boundary
generally follows an elevation contour coinciding with the pool level of the impoundment.
Based on this information, all area within the 53-meter (175-foot) amsl contour around the
Toledo Bend Project has been determined as the Project APE.
In consultation with the Cultural RWG, the Authorities identified four Project-related
activities with the potential to directly or indirectly affect historic properties within the APE:
(a) Project operations, (b) shoreline and aquatic recreation activities, (c) shoreline
development, and (d) routine maintenance activities. The indirect or direct effects of these
activities on historic properties may include ground disturbance, sedimentation, looting, or
vandalism (Authorities 2011).
These potential Project effects are most likely to impact archaeological sites along the
reservoir’s shoreline where Project-related erosion, sedimentation, and ground disturbance
could adversely affect the integrity of archaeological deposits or expose sites to looting
and/or vandalism.
The area surveyed within the APE emphasized the Project shoreline, where immediate field
investigation was most warranted under the goals and tasks of the Study Plan (Soltysiak and
Scott 2010). Therefore, for this Project, survey efforts were conducted within 15 meters (50
feet) of the shore at all selected locations, hereafter referred to as the Survey Area.

1.2

Project Goals and Tasks

The principal goal of the cultural resources study is to collect sufficient information
regarding cultural resources within the Project’s APE to assist the Authorities in developing
an HPMP that will provide for the long-term management of historic properties throughout
the term of the license (Authorities 2009). The Cultural Resources Study Plan outlined
objectives for meeting the goals of this study. In consultation with the Working Group and
other stakeholders, the Authorities have subsequently refined these objectives to better reflect
the long-term management goals for historic properties within the Project’s APE. These
objectives now include:
a) Identify and prioritize areas of the APE where ongoing or potential Project effects
may pose a significant threat to the integrity of historic or archaeological resources;
b) Conduct field investigations at high-probability locations within the APE to refine
predictive models and to assess the nature and character of cultural deposits;
c) Identify properties of traditional religious or cultural significance through
consultation with the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma and the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe
of Texas;
5
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

d) Collect sufficient data through background research, predictive modeling, field
studies, and consultation with the Working Group to provide recommendations for an
approach to completing additional field testing within the APE, including site
delineation and evaluation, as appropriate;
e) Facilitate development of the anticipated programmatic agreement between the
Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (Council), the Commission, the State
Historic Preservation Offices (SHPOs), and the USFS for managing historic
properties that may be affected by the issuance of a new license for the continued
operation and maintenance of the Project. The Authorities anticipate that the licensee
and federally recognized Indian tribes will be invited to participate in the
development of the programmatic agreement as concurring parties; and
f) Develop an HPMP in consultation with the Working Group that provides for the long
term management of historic properties within the Project’s APE, including:
­ A plan and schedule for conducting additional testing and monitoring within the
Project’s APE; and
­ Additional management measures to avoid, minimize, or mitigate adverse effects
on identified archaeological sites and historic properties.
At the Authorities’ request, HDR, Inc. (HDR), the Authorities' primary consultant for this
relicensing, retained HRA Gray & Pape in 2009 to provide cultural resources management
services during the licensing process. HRA Gray & Pape’s scope of work included the
following 6 tasks as outlined in the Study Plan (Authorities 2009): 1) additional background
and documentary research to supplement information gathered during the PAD development
process; 2) desktop analysis and the development of a comprehensive cultural resources map
and pre-fieldwork report; 3) archaeological field investigations of shoreline sites, including
subsurface testing at identified priority sites; 4) an architectural/engineering survey for
buildings and structures within the APE that may be eligible for listing on the NRHP; 5) the
preparation and submittal of technical reports; and 6) the preparation of materials collected
from state and federal lands for permanent curation.
To date, Study Plan Tasks 1 and 2 have been fulfilled by the submittal of a pre-fieldwork
report to the Working Group on February 5, 2010 (Soltysiak and Scott 2010). The results of
the background research and literature review containing descriptions of the environmental
setting of the Toledo Bend region, culture history, previous investigations in the area, and
detailed modeling methods can be found in the pre-fieldwork report, prepared by Soltysiak
and Scott (2010).
This report has been prepared in fulfillment of Tasks 3, 4, and 5 of the Study Plan for the
Texas portion of the Project APE (Authorities 2009). A separate report has also been
prepared for all investigation within the Louisiana portion of the APE (Scott and Soltysiak
2010). The objectives of these tasks were to assist the Working Group in the fieldverification of potential Project effects on significant cultural resources that may be
threatened within the APE.

In fulfillment of Task 3, the archaeological reconnaissance survey of the selected priority loci
in Texas was conducted between April 19 and May 21, 2010 and in July 2011. Field survey
on land owned by SRA-TX was conducted with reference to the Antiquities Code of Texas
under Permit #5568 issued by the THC on March 18, 2010. Field surveys carried out on
federal property owned by the USFS were conducted under Temporary Special Use Permit #
SAB002501, issued by the Office of the National Forests and Grasslands in Texas on April
19, 2010.
In fulfillment of Task 4, HRA Gray & Pape completed an architectural history survey to
identify buildings and structures, including Project works and other Project-related facilities,
that are listed in or potentially eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and that may be affected by
Project operations or activities.
The preparation and submittal of a management summary, on which this report is based, to
the Working Group has been conducted in fulfillment of Task 5 of the Cultural Resources
Study Plan (Authorities 2009). Finally, a process and schedule to complete the identification
and documentation of any Traditional Cultural Properties (TCPs) within the Project APE will
be defined in the final HPMP.

1.3

DESIGN AND METHODS

The goals of the reconnaissance-level archaeological field survey were: 1) to determine if
significant archaeological sites and/or historic structures are located along the shoreline
where potential Project effects are occurring or are most likely to occur; 2) to document areas
within the APE that have been surveyed; and 3) to identify areas that may be omitted from
further archaeological investigation. Detailed descriptions of the methods used during the
archaeological survey are discussed in the following sections. Methods used for architectural
research and field survey are detailed in Appendix E.

2.1

Priority Loci Selection Methods

The primary goals of Tasks 1 and 2 as outlined in the Study Plan were twofold: 1) identify
portions of the Project’s APE where continued operation of the Project has the potential to
directly or indirectly affect archaeological resources, and 2) highlight areas of greatest
concern to assist the Working Group in the identification of a priority subset of loci for
immediate field investigation (Authorities 2009). The methods used for identifying these loci
are described in detail in the pre-fieldwork report (see Soltysiak and Scott 2010). A summary
of these methods is presented below.
Activities undertaken to accomplish Task #1 resulted in the identification of areas where
potential Project effects including erosion, Project operations, looting, and vandalism were
occurring or most likely to occur. These areas were recorded in a Geographic Information
System (GIS) and became part of GIS-based Environmental Effects Model (EEM) (Soltysiak
and Scott 2010).
Another model was created to satisfy Task #2. This model used existing assumptions about
environmental factors that combine to form desirable locations for prehistoric occupation.
These data were likewise incorporated into a GIS-based model termed the Archaeological
Predictive Model (APM) (Soltysiak and Scott 2010). An additional factor in the development
of the APM included overlying digitized and geo-referenced historical plat maps and
topographic quadrangles dating to as early as 1863 (Von Rosenberg 1863). These maps
include historic drawings of the approximate locations of agricultural fields, roadways,
homes, town sites, railroads, cemeteries, churches, etc. Historic trails and roads were also
considered to be of particular interest in the development of this model, including the El
Camino Real de Los Tejas, the oldest network of roads in Texas. An early segment of the El
Camino Real, also known as the King’s Highway, is called the El Camino Carretera (cart
road).
In a synthesis of both models, potential Project effects were applied to potential and existing
locations of cultural resources in order to define areas of greatest concern for impacts to
archaeological sites (Soltysiak and Scott 2010). These models were applied to the Survey
Area, defined as the portion of the APE that consisted of all land within 15 meters (50 feet)
of the shoreline at an average water pool of 52.4 meters (172.0 feet) amsl (Figure 2). Selected
areas were divided into 100-meter (300- foot) segments to facilitate

in-field data management and progress tracking. The result was a set of 295 loci,
encompassing 68 kilometers (42 miles), or 6 percent of the Texas portion of the Project that
were selected as HPAs for survey because they contained: 1) the environmental factors that
would make the location desirable for prehistoric occupation; and 2) were being acted upon
by one or more environmental effects (Soltysiak and Scott 2010). In addition, 129 previously
recorded cultural resource loci located at or within 30 meters (100 feet) of the shoreline were
also selected as high priority survey targets. These loci, represented as lines for HPAs and
points for previously recorded sites, were uploaded onto handheld Global Positioning System
(GPS) machines (Trimble GeoXT) and used for guidance in the field.

2.2

Archaeological Reconnaissance Survey of Selected HPAs

HRA Gray & Pape’s survey strategy on federal property adhered to a scope of work
approved by the USFS under ARPA permit (Auth ID #SAB002501) issued on April 19,
2010. Survey conducted on state property owned by SRA-TX following the approved scope
of work under Texas Antiquities Permit #5568 issued on March 18, 2010. Field survey
conducted on property located in Texas was begun on April 19, 2010 and completed on May
21, 2010. During that time, the water pool was at an average elevation of 52.0 meters (171.4
feet).
The archaeological investigations of 295 HPAs selected as priority for survey (Soltysiak and
Scott 2010) were completed by 4 survey crews, each composed of a Crew Chief and Field
Technician, working under the supervision of the Principal Investigator. Reconnaissance
survey techniques consisted of a combination of targeted subsurface shovel testing and
pedestrian surface survey and visual inspections of beaches and exposed cutbanks. Each crew
was assigned a set of priority HPA locations to survey. Survey of each location was limited
to the immediate shoreline and all land 15 meters (50 feet) inland of the shore as this area
within the APE was considered most at risk for immediate potential Project effects (see
Figure 2 above).
Pedestrian survey of the shoreline within selected priority HPAs included a 100 percent
surface inspection of exposed ground surfaces, as well as limited judgmental shovel testing
on landforms that contained flat well-drained surfaces in addition to one or more potential
Project effects. Where possible, cutbanks were visually inspected by boat for the presence of
exposed artifacts and features. If boat access was prohibited by high wave action or shallow,
stumpy waters, HPAs were accessed by vehicle and cutbanks were visually inspected from
the ground surface above.
All shovel tests measured 30x30-centimeter (12x12-inch) in diameter. Vertical control of
each shovel test was maintained by excavating in arbitrary 10-centimeter (4-inch) levels. One
wall of each shovel test was profiled and the walls and floor of each shovel test were
inspected for color or texture change potentially associated with the presence of cultural
features. Whenever possible, shovel tests were excavated into sterile subsoil, and soils were
screened through 0.64-centimeter (0.25-inch) wire mesh; soils with high clay content were
hand-sorted.
11

If buried or surface-expressed resources were located, the locations of the finds were plotted
on field maps, Project-specific site record forms, and their locations were recorded using
GPS. Additional judgmental testing was conducted to loosely define the extent and condition
of archaeological deposits along the shoreline, particularly where erosion was recorded.
Formal site delineation to state standards within the Project APE was not completed as part
of the current field investigation. As appropriate, site delineation will be conducted pursuant
to the methods and schedule for cultural resources studies described in the final HPMP.
Following survey of each HPA, crews completed an HPA Record Form and, if new sites
were discovered, a Project-specific New Site Record Form. The HPA Record Form allowed
survey crews to record environmental characteristics of an HPA, field-verify modeled
potential Project effects and document the work conducted at a particular HPA. Fundamental
data recorded on the HPA Record Form included county name, designated HPA number,
date of survey, names of recorders, environmental description, and shovel test data. Digital
representative photographs of potential Project effects at each HPA were captured and
recorded on the HPA Record Form. A new site recorded at an HPA was listed on the HPA
Record Form and cross-referenced to a Project-specific New Site Form (see Section 2.3
below).
The crews were instructed to record erosion based on the presence or absence of several
observations. Erosion was defined as the loss of top soil, slumping soil, exposed tree roots
and/or fallen vegetation, and vertical and/or concave cut-banks. These observations were not
quantified based on the amount or degree of erosion.
Another indirect potential Project effect, looting, was considered verifiable during HPA
survey if physical evidence of a new or previously identified site was documented in tandem
with the presence of disturbed archaeological deposits marked by open pits, backfill piles,
and/or basic equipment such as screen mesh and buckets. If verified, survey crews
documented their observations on the HPA Record Form in the provided checkboxes and
space allocated for comments. The Crew Chiefs also verified the potential for looting,
identified as an area with public accessibility, such as areas containing public boat ramps,
campgrounds, off-road vehicle trails, marinas, parks, and/or major public roadways. These
observations were recorded on the HPA Record Form using the provided checkboxes and
comments section.
When encountered, standing structures that appeared to be 50 years in age or older were
photographed during the survey and their locations plotted on field maps with GPS points
collected. General characteristics of each resource were noted on standardized forms. If
encountered, these loci were reported to the Project Architectural Historian for assessment.
Refer to Section 2.6 below for a description of the architectural survey methods used.
Following the completion of survey at an HPA, a sketch map of the shoreline was handdrawn. Each map includes a depiction of the spatial relationships among landform, slope,
shoreline, potential Project effects, shovel test locations, disturbances, and archaeological
finds (if applicable). Finally, the Crew Chiefs provided their comments regarding their
12
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

overall impression of the priority for returning to an HPA in the future to gather additional
field data. These data were then reviewed by the Principal Investigator.

2.3

Recordation of New Archaeological Resources

When new archaeological resources were located, the main goal was to make preliminary
assessments regarding potential Project effects. In the field, survey crews completed Projectspecific New Site/Revisit Forms for all archaeological resources. This form resembles the
HPA Record Form and required the recordation of varying degrees of potential Project
effects including erosion, evidence of looting, the potential for looting, and public
accessibility. It also required the designation of a temporary field site number, a discussion of
any verified or potential man-made cultural features such as structures, roads, middens,
mounds, depressions, etc., the number of shovel tests excavated with their results, and a list
of materials observed and collected. As with the recordation of HPAs, digital representative
photographs of each new resource were captured, and test results as well as a generalized
description of the physical setting were recorded and a sketch map was drawn. All tests and
surface finds were recorded with GPS devices when possible.
Based on the perceived Project effect to a new site, a preliminary determination was made on
whether further study or additional site-specific treatment measures were necessary. In
addition to further studies, site specific treatment measures may include resource monitoring,
impact avoidance, protection/stabilization, data recovery, and alternative mitigation. An
Inadvertent Discoveries Plan was prepared for all survey crew that described a set of
protocols and procedures to be implemented in the event that previously unknown, unmarked
burials, or human remains were discovered within the Project APE. If archaeological
materials or human remains were observed eroding out of cutbanks or if looting could be
verified, immediate actions were to be taken to evaluate and possibly mitigate these effects,
including notification of appropriate parties and urgent recovery efforts. However, no such
situation arose during the reconnaissance survey in Texas.
2.3.1 New Archaeological Sites Selected for Additional Survey Work
Of the new archaeological resources recorded in Texas, a subset of sites were selected for
additional shovel testing to gather more information concerning the nature and extent of
archaeological sites in similar contexts along the shoreline. The selected sites were chosen
based on observed erosion, artifact density, and artifact diversity recorded as a result of the
limited subsurface testing conducted. The additional data were used to begin addressing
questions related to the effects on depositional integrity and site significance as a result of
shoreline erosion along sections of the Texas shoreline of the Toledo Bend Reservoir.
At each of the selected sites, a single survey crew composed of a Field Director, Crew Chief
and 2 Field Technicians revisited the locations of recorded materials and placed between 3-5
additional shovel tests along the shoreline. These data were recorded addition to the original
New Site Form completed by the initial survey crew that recorded the site.

2.4

Confirmation of Reported Cultural Resources' Presence

In Texas, a total of 129 locations of reported cultural resources were selected for
confirmation and assessment. The cultural resources selected for revisit included 116 known
archaeological sites, 11 Texas cemeteries, and 2 Texas Historical Markers. The revisits were
conducted by 4 crews, each made up of a Crew Chief and Field Technician, working under
the supervision of the Principal Investigator. Techniques used to confirm the
presence/absence of archaeological sites consisted of a combination of targeted subsurface
shovel testing, pedestrian surface survey, and visual inspections of beaches and exposed
cutbanks. Each crew was assigned a set of priority resource loci to confirm. Efforts were
limited to the immediate shoreline and all land 15 meters (50 feet) inland of the shore as this
area was considered under the greatest threat by potential Project effects.
2.4.1 Confirmation of Known Archaeological Sites
Survey crews attempted to confirm the presence of a deposits at previously recorded centroid
according to a Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) location listed on an official site form
or as digitized by the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) or the USFS. These
data points were preloaded on handheld Trimble GeoXT GPS devices capable of sub-meter
accuracy. Once the UTM coordinates were successfully located on dry, undeveloped land, a
shovel test was excavated in an effort to confirm previously recorded subsurface deposits.
Additional limited shovel testing (1-2 more tests) on favorable landforms may also have been
conducted if no cultural material was recorded at the site centroid. Surface inspection and
shovel test methods followed the same procedures as discussed in Section 2.2 above for
HPAs.
A systematic surface inspection of the shoreline area was conducted within the 30-meter
(100-foot) arbitrary buffer shown on field survey maps. Surface inspection was conducted
along parallel pedestrian transects using the natural topography as a guide. If buried or
surface-expressed resources were located, the locations of the finds were plotted on field
maps, recoded on standard shovel test forms and on the site form, and recorded using GPS. If
applicable, the nature of further treatment or management measures necessary at each site
will be addressed in the HPMP.
Often times, UTM coordinates for site centroids were confirmed in the lake body and were
deeply submerged. In other cases, the UTM location was inundated under only a few inches
of standing water. In these cases, the closest landmass was inspected for evidence of any
cultural material, particularly material matching the descriptions of previously recorded
artifacts from that site.
Regardless of whether the relocation effort was successful, the results were documented on a
Project-specific New Site/Revisit Form designed to capture information specific to identified
potential Project effects and current site conditions such as integrity of the sediment and
visible disturbances. Fundamental data recorded on the form included county name, official
TARL-issued state trinomial or USFS temporary site number, date of survey, names of
recorders, environmental description, and shovel test data.
14

A sketch map of the environmental conditions, locations of all shovel tests surrounding a
known site was hand drawn in the space provided on the form. Finally photographs of the
area were captured and photo-frame numbers were recorded on the form for later reference.
These data were reviewed by the Principal Investigator.
2.4.2 Revisiting Texas Cemeteries and Historical Markers
Survey crews visited the locations of 11 cemeteries and 2 Texas Historical Markers
according to a UTM location provided by TARL. These data points were preloaded on
handheld Trimble GeoXT GPS devices capable of sub-meter accuracy. Each cemetery was
located, briefly inventoried, photographed and recorded on a Project-specific Cemetery
Revisit Form. The form was designed to capture information specific to potential Project
effects. Cemetery demographics were also summarized, including cultural, ethnic, or
religious affiliation, range of interment dates, number of graves with proper headstones,
number of potential graves without markers, fencing, and overall maintenance. Fundamental
data recorded on the form included county name, official TARL-issued cemetery number,
date of survey, and names of recorders, and environmental description.
A sketch map of the environmental conditions, fence line, and approximate locations of
graves was hand drawn in the space provided on the form. Finally photographs of the area
were captured and photo-frame numbers were recorded on the form for later reference. These
data were reviewed by the Principal Investigator. The same general procedures outlined
above were applied to the revisited Texas Historical Markers. If applicable, the nature of
further treatment and management measures necessary at each cemetery and marker will be
addressed in the HPMP.

2.5

Artifact Collection, Laboratory Analyses, and Curation Methods

In general, a no-collect strategy for all non-diagnostic artifacts was used on lands owned by
SRA-TX. Diagnostic artifacts, if encountered on state-owned land, were collected for
analysis and curation. Attributes of non-diagnostic artifacts recorded on state lands were
recorded in the field and left in place.
Per USFS standards, all artifacts (diagnostic and non-diagnostic) recovered from shovel tests
were collected. For surface finds on USFS-controlled lands, only diagnostic artifacts were
collected for analysis. Attributes of non-diagnostic artifacts recorded on the ground surface
were recorded in the field and left in place on federal property. Artifacts were not collected
from private land.
HRA Gray & Pape’s Field Director escorted all collected artifacts to the Houston, Texas
office for laboratory analysis and short-term housing until final arrangements are made for
the disposition of project artifacts and records. All collected artifacts were washed (unless
detrimental to the item) and sorted by artifact type and provenience. The analyses were
conducted using our computerized artifact inventory system, which allows for accurate
assessments of artifact densities and provenience.
15
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

In consultation with the Working Group, the Authorities will develop an appropriate curation
agreement with a state-recognized curatorial repository for all artifacts collected from state
lands. Archaeological survey and excavation records will be included in the curation
agreement with the Texas repository, and artifacts will be curated according to repository
standards. At this time, it is anticipated that all cultural material collected from Texas land by
SRA-TX as a result of the survey will be prepared for curation at the Anthropology and
Archaeology Laboratory (AAL) at Stephen F. Austin (SFA) University in Nacogdoches,
Texas. The curation requirements will be detailed in the final HPMP.
It is understood that all artifacts and cultural materials identified on USFS lands are
considered property of the USFS. Archaeological collections from federally owned lands
administered by the USFS will be curated at a facility that meets or exceeds the requirements
of 36 CFR Part 79. All artifacts, and relevant archaeological survey and excavation records
including site forms, sketch maps, photographs, and notes, will be will be processed
according to TARL standards. The Authorities will determine the appropriate facility or
facilities for curating collections resulting from its investigations of the Project’s APE
through consultation with the Working Group.

PRELIMINARY FIELD SURVEY RESULTS

In Texas, the shoreline is comprised of federal and state-owned lands covering a total of
1,086 kilometers (675 miles). Of this, 68 kilometers (42 miles), or 6 percent of the Texas
shoreline were selected for archaeological survey in partial fulfillment of Task 3 of the
Project Study Plan (Authorities 2009). The archaeological reconnaissance survey in Texas
was conducted during an average water pool elevation of 52.0 meters (171.4 feet) amsl. The
surveyed areas were composed of 295 loci modeled as high potential for the discovery of
archaeological resources where Project operations or activities may be threatening the
integrity of deposits. In addition, attempts were made to confirm site presence/absence and
assess potential Project effects at 129 known cultural resources, including 116 known
archaeological site locations, 11 Texas cemeteries, and 2 Texas Historical Markers.
HRA Gray & Pape also completed an architectural history survey to identify buildings and
structures–including Project works and other Project-related facilities–that are listed in or
potentially eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and that may be affected by Project operations
or activities. This task was completed in fulfillment of Task 4 of the Study Plan (Authorities
2009). These results are presented in Appendix E and in the report of investigations for the
Louisiana portion of the Project (Scott et al. 2010).

3.1

Preliminary Results of Archaeological Reconnaissance Survey

In Texas, the archaeological survey was conducted between April 19 and May 21, 2010.
Field survey on land owned by SRA-TX was conducted with reference to the Antiquities
Code of Texas under Permit #5568 issued by the THC on March 18, 2010. Field surveys
carried out on federal property owned by the USFS were conducted under Temporary Special
Use Permit #SAB002501, issued by the Office of the National Forests and Grasslands in
Texas on April 19, 2010.
Upon completion of the reconnaissance survey of priority HPAs, results indicated that 22 of
the 295 HPAs, or 7 percent, were considered sufficiently surveyed according to Texas
minimum survey standards, while the majority of HPAs were subjected to reconnaissancelevel investigations only. Survey forms completed at each location were reviewed and
analyzed by the Principal Investigator. The results were then entered into a tracking database
and each locus was analyzed. To accomplish the ultimate Project goals, the following items
were used to classify each surveyed locus: the level of survey investigation; recordation of
new resources; and potential Project effects, if any.
A total of 22 new archaeological resources were discovered during the reconnaissance.
Thirty-four of the 116 known archaeological site locations, 10 of the 11 cemeteries, and both
Historical Markers were successfully revisited and assessed for potential Project effects.
None of these resources is threatened by one or more potential Project effects to the extent
that would warrant immediate action. No confirmed evidence of active looting or vandalism
was observed along the shoreline in Texas. Erosion is likely the most destructive potential
17
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

Project effect on significant archaeological resources at Toledo Bend Reservoir. Detailed
descriptions of survey results are provided in the following sections.

3.2

Results of GIS Modeling

As discussed in Chapter 2.0, a set of cultural and environmental factors was applied to the
Project through GIS modeling. Modeled effects were field-verified. The field survey results
were analyzed and compared to the developed models (APM and EEM).
3.2.1 Erosion
Erosion was observed in the field as cutbanks, undercutting, topsoil depletion, slumping soil,
exposed tree roots, and/or fallen vegetation. Desktop modeling predicted the potential for
erosion at 88 percent of the priority HPAs (Soltysiak and Scott 2010). Of the 35 loci where
erosion was not modeled as a potential Project effect, 21 HPAs were reported to show signs
of erosion by field personnel. In total, survey results confirmed erosion at 61 percent of
HPAs. The majority of eroding locations are situated along the main body of the lake or near
the openings of inlets and coves. In particular, the majority of eroding areas are located on
the northern end of the lake, where the Sabine River channel abuts the shoreline. Figure A1
illustrates modeled erosion versus field-verified erosion at surveyed HPAs.
3.2.2 Looting
Although, looting was projected to have been occurring at 62 (21 percent) of the 295 selected
HPAs, no confirmed evidence of active or past looting was observed at any of them. During
the survey, local residents often indicated that during a low water pool, tourists and long-time
residents engage in this activity during summer recreational activities on exposed beaches.
Looting was recorded at a single known site(s) (Site 41SB181/41SB181FS) and evidence
was limited to 3-5 small rounded ground depressions, potential back dirt piles, and the
presence of several 5-gallon buckets. In that case, it appears that any looting activity that may
have occurred was conducted several years ago based on the presence of established
vegetation and decaying leaf litter. No evidence of active looting was confirmed at any of the
locations reported by informants during the desktop analysis (Soltysiak and Scott 2010) or at
any of the other surveyed loci. This may be due to a preference for surface collection along
the beaches over more intensive excavation techniques. This does not necessarily negate the
presence of looting at those locations, but it may indicate a preference for surface collecting
rather than more intensive excavation techniques that leave observable evidence of looting
activities.
3.2.3 Slope
The Texas portion of the Project was suspected to have a wide range in topography from
south to north. This was supported by the contour and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data
utilized for desktop modeling and according to pre-reservoir historic maps. As suspected,
field survey confirmed a wide range of topography, ranging from low floodplain marshes to
extreme sloping hillsides. Slope exceeding 20 percent was recorded in the field along the
18
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

entirety of 38 HPAs, or 13 percent of the surveyed shoreline. Most of the excessive slope was
recorded in the central and northern half of the reservoir.
3.2.4 No Effects
Survey results at 66 of the 295 HPAs, or 14.8 kilometers (9.2 miles) of the surveyed
shoreline indicated that no potential Project effects were presently occurring along the
surveyed shoreline. These data appear to loosely correlate with the locations of HPAs in
coves or inlets, away from the main lake body (Figure A1). The modeled potential for effects
at each of these loci versus the lack of field-verified effects may indicate that these areas are
better protected from the effects of wind and wave action. In any case, no evidence of
Project effects was observed at these locations.

3.3

General Field Observations

Several repeated observations were made in the field. In total, 16 percent or 10.8 kilometers
(6.7 miles) of the surveyed shoreline is either excessively sloped and/or has no obvious
potential Project effects so as not to warrant further investigation at an average water pool
elevation of 52.0 meters (171.4 feet) amsl. On survey forms, the presence of excessive slope
was routinely coupled with comments suggesting a high potential for intact sites further
inland on ridge tops or on submerged terraces. In many instances, an eroding shoreline with
excessive slope and exposed subsoil, likely resulting from continuous rainwater run-off,
prompted survey crews to seek out other prominent landforms within line of sight. However,
in each instance, the closest landform was typically a ridge top or knoll situated inland and
safely away from immediate potential Project effects. In most cases, these landforms are
located outside of the Project boundary beyond the 53-meter (175-foot) amsl contour and are
on privately owned land well beyond the shoreline focus. Therefore, no subsurface testing or
pedestrian survey was conducted.
Another frequently reported observation included shoreline areas with minimal slope where
both an eroding cutbank and sandy beach were observed. Shovel testing on the tops of
cutbanks at these locations was often negative, but artifacts were observed scattered across
the exposed beaches. This situation and those described above suggest 3 scenarios that may
be occurring along the Texas Toledo Bend shoreline: 1) lower water pool elevations could
expose submerged terraces containing archaeological sites, although likely not intact; 2)
artifacts from ridge top sites outside of the Project boundary may be washing down slope and
collecting as colluvium on the beach; and/or 3) sites near the shoreline may have been
washed away by erosional processes and the depletion of intact soils on excessive slopes.
The latter scenario suggests that intact sites may be present near the shoreline but on nearby
ridge tops outside of the Project APE, and possibly on private land.
Based on the results of survey, it is likely that the immediate shoreline at a water pool
elevation of approximately 52.0 meters (171.4 feet) amsl, contains few intact and significant
archaeological sites. Although, only 6 percent of the Texas shoreline has been subjected to
survey, the surveyed areas were selected as a priority and were deemed most likely to contain
archaeological sites that may be threatened by potential Project effects (Soltysiak and Scott
19
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

2010). It is likely that 40 years of erosion have destroyed the majority of sites at the current
shoreline. However, many locations could contain archaeological deposits well above or just
below the surveyed elevation of 52.0 meters (171.4 feet) amsl.
Finally, survey results indicated that 71 of the 295 HPAs, or 24 percent, were considered
developed (Figure A2). Developed areas typically contained one or more of the following
attributes: bulkheads or retaining walls, marinas, residences, public boat ramps, cabins, or oil
fields. Many times these areas include large paved areas, modified landscapes, and areas of
fill. The majority of the developed locations consist of private residences. These locations are
typically maintained to some degree and often have modified landscapes. Most have private
boat launches and many have bulkheads installed.

3.4

New Archaeological Resources

Survey resulted in the identification of a total of 22 new archaeological resources (Figure
A3). Seven new archaeological loci are composed of a single recovered artifact and are
considered isolated finds at the present time. Fifteen of the new finds are composed of 2 or
more artifacts and are considered sites (Table 1). Seventeen of the 22 new sites are located on
property controlled by the USFS, while the remaining 5 are situated on state land (Table 1).
Of the 68 kilometers (42 miles) surveyed, an average of 1 new resource per 3.2 kilometers (2
miles) of shoreline was recorded. These loci were either recorded on the surface or by
subsurface testing, but only as a combination of both at a single location (Figure A4). Surface
finds were generally recorded on the beach just above the water pool at the time of survey.
No tests were performed on exposed beach. In all cases, positive shovel tests were located
above the shoreline on top of the eroding cutbank. Nineteen of the 22 new resources are
prehistoric, 2 are historic, and 1 site contained prehistoric and historic artifacts in a mixed
context. Based on the limited amount of shovel testing conducted, 10 of the new resources
contained only surface scatters, while 11 contained only buried materials. The site containing
a mix of artifact types was present on both the surface and in a buried context. It is possible
that some of the newly recorded resources are portions of previously recorded sites nearby
(Figure A5).
Shoreline erosion was recorded at 18 of the 22 new resources. Surface inspections and
subsurface testing at eroding locations where archaeological deposits were recorded indicate
that few intact deposits remain and are primarily made up of very few pieces of lithic
debitage and/or small pottery sherds situated away from the cutbanks. In no instance were
artifacts observed eroding out of an exposed cutbank. No diagnostic tools or evidence of
features were observed at eroding locations. Therefore, immediate actions to evaluate or
mitigate were not warranted.

No evidence of active looting was observed at these locations. Although some subsurface
testing was conducted, few shovel tests contained more than 2 artifacts, nor were substantial
numbers of artifacts observed on the ground surface (see Table 1). However, surface finds
were more frequent than subsurface finds (see Table 1).
No evidence of the historic El Camino Carretera (cart road), an early segment of the historic
El Camino Real de los Tejas, or of the more southern route of the roadway, was observed
during survey. Portions of the old route near Farm-to-Marker Road (FM) 276 at Patroon Bay
revealed no evidence of a trail, but did result in the identification of a new multicomponent
archaeological site (41SB382), whose integrity has been compromised by modern
developments (see Section 3.5.3 below for details). Portions of the King’s Highway route
near State Highway 21 at the Pendleton Bridge revealed no new archaeological sites,
prehistoric or historic. These areas were most often documented as developed with
significant landscape alterations at the bridge and residential and commercial developments
on either side. Some locations near the segments of old road were characterized as “marshy”
and were described as saturated to nearly inundated with the presence of cypress trees and
tall grasses.

Results of Additional Survey at a Sample of New Archaeological Sites

Following the completion of the initial reconnaissance survey in May 2010, 6 of the 22 new
archaeological sites were selected for additional survey-level investigation to gather more
data concerning the nature and extent of archaeological sites in similar context along the
shoreline. This work was conducted between July 6 and July 13, 2010, during an average
water pool elevation of 51.3 meters (168.45 feet) amsl, which is considered below normal.
The selected sites were chosen based on scale of recorded erosion, artifact density, artifact
diversity, topography, and landform. The additional data were used to begin addressing
questions related to potential Project effects on the depositional integrity and site significance
as a result of 40 years of shoreline erosion along the Texas Toledo Bend shoreline. Of
particular interest was the preliminary investigation of suspected site displacement resulting
from colluvial run-off from upland ridges and littoral transport from boat-generated waves.
The results of additional survey are presented in the following sections. Planview maps and
overview photographs of each site are provided in Appendix B, Figures B1-B6.
3.5.1 Results of Additional Survey at New Site 41SY379
New Site 41SY379, located in Shelby County, was recorded during the initial field
reconnaissance as a prehistoric site with a surface scatter of pottery and lithic flakes (Table
1). The area of surface scatter is on the western end of a sand beach.
The site is on the south end of a peninsula with a predominately clay shore; the sandy area
sits between the current clay shore and a marsh at the foot of the slope inland. During periods
of normal pool elevation of 52.4 meters (172.0 feet) the area of sand would be the shore. The
lower water level has allowed much of the existing shore, not covered in sand, to be
overgrown with a grass. The east end of the shore tapers off quickly where erosion has
22
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

created a sheer face on the eastern side of the landform. The west end curves around to the
north into a marsh. Elevation in the area rises quickly to the north for a distance of
approximately 7 meters (23 feet), where it levels off.
The original shovel test, located on the end of the peninsula west of the observed surface
scatter, was negative. To further assess the extent of the site along the shore, a shovel test
was excavated in the center of the sandy area as the surrounding soils were composed of
basal clays. The shovel test contained a single horizon of loose, friable sand, 10YR7/4
mottled with 10YR6/8, excavated to a depth of 90 centimeters (36 inches) where the water
table was encountered. The test contained no cultural material. The area surrounding the site
was surface inspected and no additional artifacts were located (Figure B1).
The artifacts located during the initial reconnaissance survey most likely ended up in their
recovered position due to eroding down slope from an upland site or were re-deposited in the
soft sandy area by wave action from a submerged site. Site 41SY379 has no depositional
integrity or research significance along the shoreline, and with no subsurface component and
few other favorable areas to subject to further subsurface testing, no additional management
activities are necessary for this site.
3.5.2 Results of Additional Survey at New Site 41SY380
Newly identified Site 41SY380, located in Shelby County, was recorded during the original
reconnaissance as an area of interest with a possible shell midden feature. A surface scatter of
lithic flakes, pottery, and a projectile point tip were recovered from the site. The positive
shovel test excavated during the original reconnaissance survey was located just outside of
the tree line in a small area between the trees and the lake.
The site is on a small boot-shaped landform. The shoreline of the site was covered in grass up
to the tree line where slope restricts the need to conduct additional testing. The shore was
covered in Cypress stumps and proved unfit for testing; the remainder of the landform in the
vicinity of the site is covered in thick vegetation and clusters of Cypress trees (Figure B2).
The concentration of shell in the area of the site appears to have been washed in and has
accumulated in the area around the Cypress stumps and root systems. There is no erosion on
the landform. Shell at the site was determined to be corbicula, an invasive clam species to the
Toledo Bend Reservoir. Therefore, the possible shell midden reported during original survey
was determined inaccurate.
Additional management of this site is not recommended based on the following information:
no evidence of a cultural midden at new Site 41SY380, the presence of an invasive shell
species in a mixed context with surface artifacts, the substantial likelihood that the artifacts
and shell have been washed up from submerged land, rather than washed down of the upland,
the limited area available for meaningful further testing and the presence of erosion.
3.5.3 Results of Additional Survey at New Site 41SB382
New Site 41SB382, located in Sabine County, was recorded during the initial field
23

CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

reconnaissance as a multi-component site, located on a relatively flat parcel of land. The site
sits just north of FM 276 at Patroon Bay. The areas to the south and west of the road are
commercial and residential properties. The location is protected from major wave action by a
peninsula to the east, which extends from the northeast to the southeast, and the bridge to the
south that connects the 2 landforms. Erosion in the area appears to have been primarily
caused by ground water runoff.
During the initial reconnaissance, the area was visually inspected for any evidence of the
historic El Camino Carretera associated with the El Camino Real de los Tejas network of
Spanish trails. Evidence of a trail was not located, as the area has been highly modified for
modern road construction and other developments.
During the reconnaissance, 3 shovel tests were placed on the landform, with 2 on the
northern edge and 1 test between a boat ramp and FM 276. All were positive for historic
and/or prehistoric archaeological materials. Shovel Tests 1 and 2 contained few prehistoric
lithic flakes and plain pottery. Shovel Test 3 by the boat ramp contained both historic and
prehistoric materials in a mixed deposition. During the second site visit, 3 additional shovel
tests were placed along the eastern shore of the landform to investigate the horizontal limits
of the site (Figure B3). The soils in the horizon above the clay B-horizon were a disturbed
sand/silt mix. No more cultural materials were recovered as a result of the additional testing.
Surface inspection of the area provided no additional cultural materials. The area was littered
with debris from fireworks from the 4th of July holiday, suggesting a significant amount of
public activity in the area, although no evidence of looting was present.
Known Site 41SB115 is located 244 meters (800 feet) to the east of new Site 41SB382. The
known site was submerged during revisit. Another known site, Site 41SB12, is situated more
than 366 meters (1,200 feet) to the north. The proximity of these existing sites may be the
cause of the initial artifacts recovered from this site, as wave action and littoral transport may
have washed materials ashore.
The disturbed nature of the landform near FM 276 due to past road and structure
development as well as the installation of a nearby bulkhead and a boat ramp appears to have
resulted in a loss of site integrity at this location. It is also likely that any remnant of El
Camino Carretera has been destroyed by these developments. Although no ongoing Projectrelated effects have been identified, potential effects may occur over the term of the new
license. Therefore, periodic monitoring is an appropriate management measure for this site.
3.5.4 Results of Additional Survey at New Site 41SB388
New Site 41SB388, located in Sabine County, was recorded during the initial field
reconnaissance survey and contained a single projectile point base and 4 lithic flakes. The
site is situated immediately south of a transmission corridor in a small cove. There is no
erosional impact on the site from the reservoir.
Three shovel tests were dug during the original reconnaissance survey, 1 on each of the
eastern, southern, and western sides of the cove. The test on the western side was positive for
cultural materials. Two additional tests were dug to determine the horizontal limits of the
24

CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

site, 1 on either side of the original positive test. Both tests contained the same 3 soil
horizons, including a thin O-horizon composed of an 8-centimeter (3-inch) thick organic mix
of 10YR7/3, followed by an A-horizon between 8-25 centimeters (3-10 inches) of 10YR6/6
fine sand. This was followed by a B-horizon made up of 5YR5/8 basal clay between 25-45
centimeters (10-18 inches) below the surface. No additional cultural materials were observed
as a result of additional subsurface testing (Figure B4). New Site 41SB388 appears to contain
a limited number of artifacts with little to no research potential and is not in significant
danger of erosion. However, these finds could be associated with nearby known Site(s)
41SB60/41SB60FS. Although no ongoing Project-related effects have been identified,
potential effects may occur over the term of the new license. Therefore, periodic monitoring
is an appropriate management measure for this site.
3.5.5 Results of Additional Survey at New Site 41SB389
New Site 41SB389, located in Sabine County, was recorded during the initial field
reconnaissance survey. The site is a prehistoric lithic scatter and is located 76 meters (250
feet) north of existing USFS temporary site #08130700149, both of which are north of a
small transmission corridor. These sites sit on a peninsula between 2 other peninsulas that
would have been a series of ridge tops prior to the creation of the reservoir. Erosion has
created a near vertical bank 1-2 meters (3-6 feet) height around the northern end of the
landform.
During the initial reconnaissance survey, 1 shovel test was dug in the center of the northern
part of the landform. This test was positive for prehistoric materials and contained 11 lithic
flakes from just below the surface to near 1 meter (40 inches) in depth. To determine the
horizontal extent of the site, a series of radial shovel tests was placed along the outer edge of
the peninsula approximately 5 meters (17 feet) in from the bank within the tree line (Figure
B5). All of the shovel tests showed a loamy 10YR4/4 organic O-horizon approximately 1012 centimeters (4-5 inches) thick followed by an A-horizon made up of 10YR7/4 sand
ranging from 40 to 80 centimeters thick, and the underlying 5YR5/6 basal clay B-horizon.
Soils were intact and easily defined.
The additional shovel testing recovered an additional 8 flakes in 3 of the 5 shovel tests along
the eastern side of the landform, although the western side produced no cultural material.
Surface inspection recovered no cultural materials. This site may be potentially be affected
directly or indirectly by Project operations or activities over the term of the new license. As
a result, monitoring is an appropriate treatment for these resources to determine the rate,
severity, and extent of Project-related effects. Additional field studies may be warranted at
new Site 41SB389 based on future monitoring efforts. Such studies could be conducted
within the limits of the Project APE.
3.5.6 Results of Additional Survey at New Site 41SB394
New Site 41SB394, located in Sabine County, was recorded during the initial field
reconnaissance survey. The site is situated on the northern shore of a peninsula just west of
the dam. The erosion in the area is a combination of boat and wind-generated wave action
and natural drainage, leaving 1- to 2-meter (3- to 6-foot) banks along the shore for much of
25

CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

the site and surrounding landform. The natural setting of the area surrounding the site
includes an island to the east and the channel between the site and the island forms a funnel
for wave activity and deposition of new materials is evident.
Three widely spread tests were excavated during the original reconnaissance survey to
investigate the whole landform. Only 1 shovel test was positive for prehistoric artifacts and
contained 2 lithic flakes. An additional 8 shovel tests were completed just inside the wood
line spreading east and west of previous shovel tests to observe the horizontal limits of the
site along the shore (Figure B6). The area to the east of the site has significant buildup of
sand in excess of 70 centimeters (28 inches); no cultural materials were recovered from this
portion of the testing. The area to the west of the site had a 10YR4/2 sandy horizon to a depth
of 25 to 30 centimeters (10 to 12 inches), underlain by a compact 10YR7/2 silt horizon to a
depth of 50 centimeters (20 inches), the subsurface clay was mixed with 10YR7/8 sand.
Several small non-diagnostic flakes were recorded in 1 of the 8 additional tests.
This site may potentially be affected directly or indirectly by Project operations or activities
over the term of the new license. As a result, monitoring is an appropriate treatment for this
resource to determine the rate, severity, and extent of Project-related effects. Additional field
studies may be warranted at this locus based on future monitoring efforts. Such studies could
be conducted if the water pool drops significantly.

3.6

Results of Reported Archaeological Site Confirmation Efforts

The attempt to confirm the presence of 116 previously recorded archaeological site locations
in Texas was made throughout the course of the field survey. As a result, only 34 known site
locations (31 percent) were confirmed via pedestrian survey and/or shovel testing. In general,
of the 34 confirmed site locations, erosion was recorded along the shoreline at all but 7 of
them. Looting was recorded at a single site(s) (Site 41SB181/41SB181FS) and evidence was
limited to 3-5 small rounded ground depressions, back dirt piles, and the presence of several
5-gallon buckets. On May 21, 2010, members of the Working Group inspected this site and
concluded that although looting may have occurred in the past, no active looting was taking
place to warrant immediate further action. It is recommended that this site should be
monitored periodically in the future.
The remaining 80 site locations, or 69 percent, were reported as either submerged at the time
of survey or no evidence of the site was located at the recorded UTM centroid or along the
immediate shore. As described in the pre-fieldwork report (Soltysiak and Scott 2010), there
were over 40 instances where archaeological site trinomials selected for survey were
duplicated. This is due to a discrepancy between recorded UTM coordinates provided by
TARL and those provided by the USFS for the same trinomial. The physical discrepancy
between locations is typically less than a distance of 200 meters (600 feet). During GIS
modeling, it was unclear as to which location was correct; therefore, the duplicates were not
removed from the set of selected site locations. Therefore, of the 116 site locations
recommended for initial survey, only 95 sites are actually represented.

26

CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

At 18 of the 21 sites in which both sets of UTM locations were selected as a priority for
survey, field crews recorded both locations as “submerged” during survey. Of these, only 4
locations or 2 sets of both TARL/USFS locations (Sites 41SB90, 41SB90FS, 41SB181, and
41SB181FS) were located. Originally, Site 41SB90 was recoded as a prehistoric site,
although survey results indicated that historic materials including a whiteware fragment and a
square nail were found at the TARL coordinates, and prehistoric artifacts including 4 lithic
flakes were found at the USFS coordinates. However, both locations recorded for prehistoric
Site 41SB181 were positive and contained prehistoric debitage. As stated above, survey was
carried out during an average water pool elevation of 52.0 meters (171.4 feet) amsl.
Additional survey at a lower water pool could result in the positive relocation of many
currently submerged sites, potentially resulting in resolution of some additional duplicate
TARL/USFS locations.

3.7

Results of Revisited Texas Cemeteries and Historical Markers

Only 10 of the 11 selected Texas cemeteries could be confirmed present. The Toledo
Cemetery located on the southern end of the Project area near the Toledo Bend dam appears
to have been relocated to an undisclosed location away from the shore based on information
from local residents. Eight of the 11 revisited Texas cemeteries appear to be contained by
fence/wall materials. In addition to marked graves, several cemeteries contained potentially
unmarked graves evidenced by ground depressions, lack of vegetation, or the presence of
unique plants. No potential Project-related effects were noted at the 10 revisited cemeteries.
The locations of Texas Historical Markers #7573 and #11040 for the Oliphint Chapel and
Isaac Low Cemeteries were also examined during the survey to determine whether erosion or
vandalism may be affecting the markers. Both markers are intact and sufficiently away from
the immediate shoreline so as not to be affected by erosion. In addition, no evidence of
vandalism was noted at these locations.

3.8

Examples of Typical Shoreline Settings

In general, there are 4 examples of the most frequently encountered environmental settings
along the Texas shoreline of the Toledo Bend Reservoir. Representative photographs of each
prominent environmental setting can be found in Appendix C, Plates C1-C12. The most
frequently observed shoreline setting included a pristine homogenously-forested (often with
planted pine) shoreline, with few logging trails, minor deeply cut drainages, and actively
eroding vertical to convex cutbanks along the shore on the main body of the lake or the
opening of inlet and coves (Plates C1-C3). The second most frequently encountered setting
was within coves and inlets that appear to be better protected from active erosion than areas
exposed along the main body. These areas exhibit some erosion, usually characterized by the
loss of soil and sediment underlying mature trees, leaving them standing on hardened root
structures. Other characteristics generally include a variety of vegetation types, including
grasses and mixed forest with substantial amounts of undergrowth. The third most common
setting involves flat, marshy areas, commonly submerged to near-submerged. These areas
frequently exhibited no evidence of erosion, and contained cypress stumps, and vegetation
characteristic of wetlands, including grasses, lily pads, and other hydric vegetation (Plates
27

CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

C4-C7). The last setting commonly observed included developed areas in coves, inlets, and
along the main lake body where bulkheads, boat ramps, piers, and docks are found. These
shoreline developments typically lead to residences, parks, marinas, and commercial
buildings (Plates C10-C12).

3.9

Results of Additional Survey in 2011

During the original reconnaissance survey in the spring of 2010, over 60% of sites selected as
priority for revisit were reported as submerged beneath the normal water pool elevation of
52.4 meters (172 feet) amsl. A subsequent survey following the manual drawdown of the
impoundment to approximately 49.9 meters (164 feet) amsl indicated that submerged sites
may still contain intact deposits with potential for looting and erosion when exposed above
water (Appendix G). Severe drought following the manual drawdown of 2010 presented a
unique archaeological opportunity with record low water depths nearly 3 meters
(approximately 10 feet) below normal at the time of survey in July of 2011. HRA Gray &
Pape selected 15 typically submerged archaeological sites on the basis of likelihood of
containing potentially significant deposits at potential risk of looting and erosion between
49.6 meters and 49.5 meters (162.8 and 162.5 feet) amsl.
As a result of survey, HRA Gray & Pape is recommending no further work at the following
sites based on a lack of intact or significant deposits: 41SB30, 41SB85/41SB85FS,
41SB86/41SB86FS, 41SB383, and 41SB385. The following sites were still submerged below
49.5 meters (162.5 feet amsl): Maud Howell shipwreck, 41SB40, 41SB41, 41SB43, 41SB46,
41SB52, 41SB55, 41SB61, 41SB63, and 41SB64. Therefore, HRA Gray & Pape also
recommends no further work at the surveyed loci with a water pool between 48.8 meters (160
feet) amsl or higher, as there were no recorded Project effects or potential for Project effects
at this level. Further work at some loci may be warranted should the water pool drop below
48.8 meters (160 feet) amsl.

CONCLUSIONS

This report is intended to document the status of field efforts accomplished by HRA Gray &
Pape, LLC and to satisfy permitting requirements for Antiquities Permit 5568. It presents the
initial archaeological and architectural survey results and preliminary cultural resources
management recommendations under Tasks 3, 4, and 5 of the Toledo Bend Relicensing
Project Study Plan (Authorities 2009). The archaeological reconnaissance produced a total of
22 new archaeological resources. Thirty-four of the 116 known archaeological site locations,
10 of the 11 cemeteries, and both Texas Historical Markers were successfully revisited and
assessed for potential Project effects.
The majority of the 22 new archaeological resources are currently described as prehistoric
light density scatters, primarily composed of non-diagnostic artifacts. Seven loci are
currently only represented by a single artifact and are therefore not referred to as sites at this
time. A schedule and set of procedures for additional studies associated with these resources
will be outlined in the HPMP, to be developed in consultation with the Working Group.
At this time, none of the cultural resources are threatened by potential Project effects to the
extent that would warrant immediate action. No confirmed evidence of active looting or
vandalism was observed along the shoreline in Texas. Erosion has been documented along
the shoreline of the Toledo Bend Reservoir, and it is possible that shoreline erosion has
contributed to site disturbance. Work, including survey, site delineation, and monitoring
efforts, is ongoing, and will continue according to the HPMP schedule.

4.1

Project Effects

Effects on the integrity of cultural resources can come from a variety of sources, including
the ongoing effects of Project operations, recreation, public use, and routine maintenance
activities. Future shoreline development activities, such as development of boat ramps,
docks, or retaining walls, could also directly or indirectly affect historic properties. These
potential activities are most likely to impact archaeological sites along the reservoir’s
shoreline where erosion, sedimentation, or ground disturbance could adversely affect the
integrity of archaeological deposits or expose sites to looting and/or vandalism.
4.1.1 Project Operations
The level of the reservoir is affected primarily by hydrologic conditions in the Sabine River
watershed (e.g., annual precipitation, timing of late-season storms, drought conditions).
Within the restrictions of these hydrologic conditions, the Authorities must operate the
Project for the primary purpose of water supply and to meet the requirements related to the
Power Sales Agreement, the Operating Guide Rule Curve, state water rights, and the Sabine
River Compact. These requirements affect the level of the reservoir during the course of the
year.

29

CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

Archaeological resources located within or adjacent to the normal fluctuation zone of the
Toledo Bend Reservoir (e.g., 51.2-52.4 meters [168-172 feet]) may be periodically subject to
inundation, exposure, and effects of water movement along the shoreline. These shoreline
physical processes are the result of a combination of complex and interrelated natural and
anthropogenic factors that may contribute to shoreline erosion.
Shoreline erosion has been documented at the Toledo Bend Reservoir and observed during
field investigations. Erosion is an ongoing and natural process that occurs when water moves
along a shoreline. As a result, the specific influence of Project operations and reservoir level
fluctuations is difficult to assess or quantify. However, Project operations may have
modified the rate and location of shoreline erosion, especially at higher lake levels
(Authorities 2008).
Loss of intact sediments is more pronounced along the pre-Project course of the Sabine River
and is strongly influenced by seasonal weather patterns, standing timber in sections of the
reservoir, and waves generated by prevailing winds and powerboats. Continued Project
operations may also have resulted in the loss of vegetation and topsoil at inundated sites,
which could expose resources to the indirect effects of looting and vandalism when reservoir
levels are low.
Wave action derived from prevailing winds is the primary cause of erosion at the Toledo
Bend Reservoir (Holmes and Stalling 1987, Taylor 1998). Other factors influencing erosion
include wakes created by powerboats and the continued loss of standing timber that was
inundated when the reservoir was filled. This timber previously served to moderate the
effects of wave action (Holmes and Stalling 1987). Areas of the shoreline where the course
of the pre-Project Sabine River channel is in close proximity to the modern shoreline are
generally the most susceptible to erosion. Erosion is most pronounced along the southern
and southwestern shoreline of the reservoir, where fetch length and location of the preProject Sabine River channel create the most favorable conditions for erosion to occur
(Authorities 2008, Taylor 1998, Holmes and Stalling 1987).
Shoreline erosion may have an adverse impact on archaeological resources within or adjacent
to the Project’s normal fluctuation zone. Erosion may undercut exposed banks, strip topsoil,
create slopes, influence the movement of sediment and smaller artifacts, expose sites to
looting, or result in the burial of archaeological deposits under sediment.
The location of the resource within the fluctuation zone, degree of slope, erosiveness of the
soil, nature of the resource, and amount of exposure to wind- and boat-driven wave action are
all variables that could affect the magnitude and severity of erosion. For example, sites at
higher elevations within the fluctuation zone may risk being undercut by erosion but are
generally not inundated by the impoundment. In contrast, those sites at lower elevations may
be routinely inundated, and those in between are inundated and exposed on a regular basis.
Sites on relatively flat ground or in sheltered coves are less likely to be affected by water
movement, while sites along the main body of the reservoir may be more susceptible to
shoreline erosion.

30

CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

Some archaeological resources are located below the normal impoundment fluctuation zone
(51.2-52.4 meters [168-172 feet) and may become exposed only during periods of low pool
elevation. Periodically, the Authorities draw down the reservoir to facilitate maintenance or
inspection of the Project’s water-retaining structures. Low pool elevations may also occur as
the result of natural drought conditions in the Sabine River Basin that are beyond the
Authorities’ control. Impacts may be caused by looting or vandalism of sites that are
exposed during occasional periods of low reservoir elevation.
Archaeological sites located below the normal minimum reservoir elevation of 49.4 meters
(162.2 feet) are almost always inundated. The condition of these resources, and the nature of
any potential Project-related impacts, is not currently known.
4.1.2 Recreation and Public Use
Recreation and other aspects of public use may affect archaeological resources within the
Project’s APE. Inadvertent damage can be caused by direct physical alterations (e.g., ground
disturbance caused by use of informal recreation trails and fishing access areas). These
activities typically strip vegetation that can increase erosion and/or expose archaeological
and historic resources to vandalism or looting. Concentrated public use of recreation areas
also increases the potential for the incidental looting (e.g., collection of projectile points or
pottery sherds) along eroded shorelines or when reservoir levels are low. Archaeological
sites near developed recreation facilities and other areas accessible by boat or motorized
vehicles are most susceptible to these indirect impacts.
4.1.3 Shoreline Development
Construction of new boat ramps, docks, marinas, retaining walls, and other shoreline features
have the potential to impact archaeological resources within the APE. Shoreline
development activities can vary considerably, and the nature and severity of potential effects
depends on the location, extent, and type of development. Low-impact activities such as the
installation of seasonal floating docks, landscape plantings, or the construction of fencing and
noncommercial piers are unlikely to have any direct effects on historic properties within the
Project’s APE. Ground disturbance associated with these activities generally has a small
footprint, and is limited to pilings, fence posts, etc. However, activities such as dredging or
the construction of new access roads have the potential to adversely affect archaeological and
historic resources. Other indirect effects of shoreline development may include unintentional
changes in the patterns of erosion and sedimentation in the vicinity of historic and
archaeological resources. Shoreline development may also make archaeological resources
more easily accessible to looters and vandals.
4.1.4 Facilities Maintenance and Operations
The Toledo Bend Project includes facilities associated with water supply, hydroelectric
generation, recreation, and other ancillary services. Maintenance of Project facilities and
recreation areas can vary widely depending on the location and the extent of repairs. Routine
Project-related maintenance activities, such as the installation of buoys and lane markers
within the reservoir, painting, and garbage collection, are unlikely to cause any impacts on
31

CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

archaeological sites within the Project’s APE. However, maintenance activities that require
ground disturbance have the potential to adversely affect archaeological resources.

4.2

Assessment of Project-Related Effects

Not all areas of the APE have the same potential to be impacted by Project-related effects.
Erosion was the most commonly observed impact during the 2010 field investigations,
demonstrating that shoreline areas along the main body of the Toledo Bend Reservoir are
more susceptible to the effects of wind and wave action. As a result, coves, inlets, and other
areas that are protected from the force of waves generated by prevailing winds and
powerboats typically remain less affected by shoreline erosion.
Similarly, while recreation and public use can have an effect on cultural resources, these
impacts are generally limited to formal recreation areas and sections of the shoreline in the
vicinity of boat ramps, marinas, and launches. Much of the shoreline along the Toledo Bend
Reservoir is undeveloped and lacks roads or trails. As a result, such areas are not easily
accessible by motorized vehicles. Standing timber also makes accessing the shoreline by
boat difficult outside of designated navigation lanes. Therefore, potential impacts from
recreation, public use, and the continued maintenance and operation of recreation facilities
within the Project’s APE are localized and associated primarily with formal recreation areas.
Potential effects associated with routine Project maintenance and operations have a limited
geographical extent. These activities typically occur in proximity to the Project’s principal
facilities, including the dam, spillway, powerhouse, and observation platforms. Construction
of these facilities and the reservoir during the 1960s required significant excavation and
clearing. Consequently, ground-disturbing activities within these previously disturbed
portions of the APE are unlikely to affect archaeological resources.

4.3

Preliminary Recommendations

HRA Gray & Pape conducted additional survey-level work including supplemental shovel
testing at a sample of 6 of the new sites recorded during reconnaissance. This work indicated
that erosion, wave-action, and groundwater run-off may be impacting archaeological sites by
re-depositing cultural material. These processes are often responsible for the presence of
materials recorded during the current shoreline survey effort. In fact, 2 of the new sites (Sites
41SY379 and 41SY380) are most certainly the visible remains of re-deposited materials from
neighboring sites. Therefore, HRA Gray & Pape recommends no further work based on the
lack of any depositional integrity or potential for intact buried deposits within the Survey
Area of the APE at these particular locations. As a result of 2011 survey, HRA Gray & Pape
is recommending no further work at the following sites based on a lack of intact or
significant deposits: 41SB30, 41SB85/41SB85FS, 41SB86/41SB86FS, 41SB383, and
41SB385. The following sites were still submerged below 49.5 meters (162.5 feet amsl):
Maud Howell shipwreck, 41SB40, 41SB41, 41SB43, 41SB46, 41SB52, 41SB55, 41SB61,
41SB63, and 41SB64. The final HPMP describes the methods and schedule for implementing
future cultural resources studies within the Project’s APE to identify archaeological sites that
are potentially affected by ongoing Project operations or activities.

Regarding the visitation and assessment at previously identified cultural resources, HRA
Gray & Pape recommends that additional treatment measures may be appropriate for 108 of
the 129 revisited cultural resources (or 92 percent) and at 200 of the 295 HPAs totaling 44.3
kilometers (27.4 miles), or 65 percent of the surveyed Texas shoreline (Appendix D, Figures
D1-D5). Further site treatment measures may be appropriate for those sites that may be
affected by the Project over the term of the license, including:
o loci where the GPS positions were submerged at the time of survey;
o loci that require more subsurface testing to negate the possibility for buried
undiscovered archaeological sites;
o loci with low topography that although marshy during survey may become dry at
a lower water pool;
o loci with sloped topography that with a change in water pool may either expose a
submerged terrace or reach an upper ridge top;
o loci with high traffic or in/near parks, campgrounds, and other recreational areas;
and
o loci where no potential Project effects were observed during survey but may
change in condition with changes in the water pool (e.g., potential Project effects
over the term of the new license).
In addition to future cultural resources studies, management and treatment measures for these
sites may include periodic monitoring, site protection/stabilization, data recovery, or
alternative mitigation. HRA Gray & Pape’s initial management recommendations for all
revisited cultural resources are provided in Table D1, located in Appendix D.
In summary, HRA Gray & Pape recommends no further treatment or management of 26 of
the 129 revisited cultural resources (or 7 percent) and 95 of the 295 HPAs totaling 23.7
kilometers (14.6 miles), or 32 percent of the surveyed Texas shoreline (Table D1 and Figures
D1-D5). The 26 known cultural resources include 15 known archaeological sites, 9 of the 11
Texas cemeteries, and both (2) Texas Historical Markers. These 26 loci have either been
destroyed as a result of past landscape modification and/or erosion or are not in danger of
potential Project effects.
The locations recommended for no further treatment or management were either subsurface
tested to a degree that negated the need for further work or contain a level of development or
stabilization that either negates the environmental effects on the shoreline or destroys the
integrity of the location. A developed area typically contains one or more of the following
attributes: bulkheads or any retention wall along the shoreline, marina, residence, public boat
ramp, cabin, or oil field. Many times these areas include large paved areas, modified
landscapes, and areas of fill. A majority of the developed locations consist of private
residences. These locations are typically maintained to some degree and often have modified
landscapes. Most have private boat launches and many have bulkheads installed.
33

Other factors to include in the HPMP include continued effort toward determining the correct
locations of recorded sites for which there are different UTM coordinates provided by TARL
and the USFS for the same trinomial. Surveys conducted at low water pool may resolve
many of these instances as nearly 69 percent of revisited sites were recorded as submerged.
4.3.1 Refining the Models
While confidence in the APM as a planning tool assisted HRA Gray & Pape in the
recordation of 22 new archaeological sites in Texas, the discovery of more new sites was
anticipated and indicated that adjustments to the APM and EEM are warranted. As a result of
the development of the APM, 740 kilometers (460 miles) of the entire 1,160-kilometer (721mile) Texas shoreline was considered to have excellent site potential, the discovery of more
sites was anticipated along the 68 kilometers (42 miles) of HPAs selected for initial survey.
One reason for the small number of recorded sites may be that additional sites at the surveyed
shoreline have been destroyed by 40 years of wave-generated erosion, looting, and shoreline
developments. Another plausible reason could be that intact sites may be situated away from
the surveyed shoreline on ridge tops, shallowly submerged terraces near the shoreline, and on
deeply submerged terraces along the main river channel.
In Texas, the EEM appeared moderately strong at predicting HPA locations where erosion
was most likely, as was indicated by the field-verified presence of erosion at 61 percent of
the 88 percent of HPAs modeled as eroding. It is our hope that, in addition to HRA Gray &
Pape’s own ground-truthed data, the results produced by an ongoing erosional study also
being conducted for the Toledo Bend Relicensing Project be utilized in future model
refinements. These data could assist the Authorities in developing the HPMP and addressing
concerns regarding the effect that erosion poses to the preservation of archaeological sites.
Yet another plausible reason fewer sites were recorded than expected lies with regard to the
23.7 kilometers (14.6 miles) of recorded shoreline development that was not entirely
explored during development of the APM. It is anticipated that this data will be used to
initiate the refinement of the APM and omit areas containing similar developments by using
an array of source material such as county appraisal records, federal, state, and local building
permit postings, up-to-date aerial photography, and continuous field survey.

4.4

Summary

As stated in Chapter 3.0, it is likely that the immediate shoreline at a normal water pool
elevation of approximately 52.4 meters (172.0 feet) amsl, contains few intact and significant
archaeological sites. It is likely that 40 years of erosion has destroyed the majority of sites at
the current shoreline. However, many locations could contain archaeological deposits well
above or just below the surveyed elevation.
As previously mentioned, a frequently reported field observation included shoreline areas
with minimal slope where both an eroding cutbank and sandy beach were observed. Shovel
testing results at these locations were often negative, but artifacts were observed scattered
across the exposed beaches. As stated in Chapter 3.0, it is possible that 3 scenarios that may
34
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

be occurring along the Texas Toledo Bend shoreline: 1) lower water pool elevations could
expose submerged terraces containing archaeological sites, although likely not intact; 2)
artifacts from ridge top sites outside of the Project boundary may be washing down slope and
collecting as colluvium on the beach; and 3) sites near the shoreline have been washed away
by past and present erosional processes and the loss of intact soils on excessive slopes,
suggesting that intact sites are likely present on nearby ridge tops that are most often located
outside of the Project APE, and possibly on private land.
Artifacts deposited on the shoreline, may also be attributable to submerged archaeological
sites. Further studies of reported sites situated just offshore in the body of the reservoir may
be warranted to assess Project effects on these resources. This future assessment should take
place at times when the water pool is at or near its lowest elevation.
Periodic monitoring is recommended for site locations that were initially recorded as areas
where no potential Project effects were noted, but where Project effects may occur over the
term of the license. As discussed above, a change in the impoundment level may reveal
potential Project effects to portions of sites that were not visible during the initial
reconnaissance survey. These revisits would aid in our understanding of the Project’s impact
on the reservoir’s environment.
Finally, some locations warrant treatment because they are located in areas that experience
high public traffic. The information provided by locals throughout the duration of the survey
suggests that beach combing is prevalent.

ABSTRACT
The Sabine River Authority of Texas and the Sabine River Authority, State of Louisiana,
(collectively, the Authorities), own and operate the 81-megawatt Toledo Bend Project (FERC
No. 2305) (Project), located on the Sabine River in Panola, Shelby, Sabine, and Newton
Counties in Texas, and De Soto, Sabine, and Vernon Parishes in Louisiana. An original
license for the Project was issued by the Federal Power Commission, the predecessor to the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or Commission), in 1963. The Authorities’
existing license to operate the Project expires in September 2013. Accordingly, the
Authorities are seeking a new license for the Project pursuant to the Integrated Licensing
Process defined in 18 CFR Part 5 of the Commission’s implementing regulations.
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (Section 106),
requires federal agencies to consider the effects of their undertakings on historic properties
listed in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places. The
Commission’s issuance of a license for the Project is considered an undertaking subject to the
provisions and review process provided in Section 106. Consequently, the Authorities
developed a Cultural Resources Study Plan to identify historic properties within the Project’s
Area of Potential Effects (APE) that may be affected by Project operations and activities.
The results of this study will assist the Authorities in developing a Historic Properties
Management Plan (HPMP) for managing historic properties within the Project’s APE
throughout the term of the new license.
The APE includes the area within the FERC Project boundary, which generally follows a
topographic contour line that encompasses the shoreline of the reservoir. Located at 175 feet
above mean sea level, the contour line represents an elevation slightly above the highest
recorded water level within the impoundment. In addition, the APE includes any land outside
the Project boundary where cultural resources may be affected by Project-related activities
that are conducted in compliance with the FERC license. As identified by the Authorities,
potential affects related to Project-related activities include 1) Project operations; 2) shoreline
and aquatic recreation activities; 3) routine maintenance activities. Specific to historic
buildings and structures, the Authorities determined that routine maintenance activities and
facility improvements pose the potential to affect the integrity of these resources by altering
or removing character defining features.
At the Authorities’ request, HDR|DTA (the Authorities primary consultant for this
relicensing) retained HRA Gray & Pape, LLC (HRA Gray & Pape) to provide cultural
resources management services during the licensing process. Pursuant to the approved
Cultural Resources Study Plan, HRA Gray & Pape conducted an architectural assessment of
the Project’s facilities.
In October 2009, HRA Gray & Pape historians conducted fieldwork and met with staff at the
Authorities’ offices. The historians reviewed archival records, including documents, reports,
photographs, and drawings held on site. In addition, they consulted local repositories, such as
i
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

public libraries, to gather information on the project area’s general historical development.
Findings of the archival research were used to establish a context for evaluation of the
historical, architectural, and engineering significance of the Toledo Bend Dam and its
associated spillway, hydroelectric facilities, and other features.
Components of the Toledo Bend Project are recommended eligible for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places under Criteria A and C in conjunction with Criterion
Consideration G.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
The Toledo Bend Project (FERC No. 2305) (or “Project”) is located on the Sabine River in
Panola, Shelby, Sabine, and Newton counties in Texas, and De Soto, Sabine, and Vernon
parishes in Louisiana. The Project was developed jointly by the Sabine River Authority of
Texas (SRA-TX) and the Sabine River Authority, State of Louisiana (SRA-LA) (collectively,
the “Authorities”) as a water supply facility to serve the long-term municipal, industrial, and
irrigation needs of the region. The Authorities operate the Project primarily for purposes of
water supply, and secondarily for power production and recreation.
The Federal Power Act1 authorizes the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC” or
“Commission”) to issue licenses for the construction, operation, and maintenance of
nonfederal hydroelectric projects. On October 14, 1963, the Federal Power Commission
(FPC), predecessor to FERC, issued an original, 50-year license to the Authorities for the
Toledo Bend Project.2 Construction of the Project was completed in 1969. The Project’s
current license, for which the Authorities are co-licensees, expires on September 30, 2013.
The Authorities are pursuing a new license for the Project pursuant to the Commission’s
Integrated Licensing Process (ILP), described at 18 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part
5. In accordance with 18 CFR § 5.17(a), the Authorities intend to file a final application for
a new license with the Commission on or before September 30, 2011.
In considering a new license for the Project, the Commission has the lead responsibility for
compliance with applicable federal laws, regulations, and policies pertaining to cultural
resources, including the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (NHPA).3
Section 106 of the NHPA (Section 106) directs federal agencies to take into account the
effects of their undertakings on historic properties and to afford the Advisory Council on
Historic Preservation (“ACHP” or “Council”) a reasonable opportunity to comment.
The regulations implementing Section 106 (36 CFR Part 800) define “historic properties” as
any prehistoric or historic period district, site, building, structure, or individual object
included in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (National
Register). This term includes artifacts, records, and remains that are related to and located
within historic properties, as well as properties of traditional religious and cultural
importance that meet the National Register criteria.
The Project’s APE has been defined to include all lands within the FERC Project boundary.
In general, the Project boundary encompasses the shoreline and submerged areas around the
Project within the topographic contour elevation of 53 meters (175 feet) above mean sea
level. The APE also includes any lands outside of the Project boundary where cultural
resources may be affected by Project-related activities that are conducted in compliance with
the FERC license.

At the Authorities’ request, HDR, Inc. (the Authorities’ primary consultant for this
relicensing) retained HRA Gray & Pape, LLC (HRA Gray & Pape) to provide cultural
resources management services during the licensing process. Accordingly, HRA Gray &
Pape undertook a study to identify buildings and structures that are listed in or eligible for
inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) that may be affected by Project
operations or activities. As currently licensed, the principal Project works consist of a dam,
three dikes and powerhouse, gated spillway, and excavated tailrace and spillway channels,
switchyard, and a primary transmission line. The Project also includes public recreation
facilities and public use areas along both Texas and Louisiana shores of the Toledo Bend
Reservoir.

1.1

Project Description and APE

Located along the Sabine River, the Toledo Bend Project occupies land on both sides of the
Louisiana/Texas border (Figure 1). The reservoir extends northward approximately 70
navigational miles from Toledo Bend to just above Logansport, Louisiana. At its widest the
reservoir measures about 7 miles. With a shoreline measuring approximately 1,130 miles in
length, the reservoir inundates land in Newton, Sabine, Shelby, and Panola Counties Texas
and Sabine, De Soto, and Vernon Parishes Louisiana.
Built by the Authorities during the 1960s, the Toledo Bend Project includes an 11,250-foot
long rolled earth-fill dam, a concrete spillway, and a powerhouse equipped with a pair of
43,875-kilowatt capacity, Kaplan turbines.
As defined in the Authorities’ approved Study Plan, APE for the Project “includes all lands
within the FERC Project boundary”. The APE also includes any lands outside of the Project
boundary where cultural resources may be affected by Project-related activities that are
conducted in compliance with the FERC license” (Authorities 2009:3). The FERC Project
boundary generally follows a contour line located 175 feet above mean sea level (amsl).

2.0 PROJECT METHODS
2.1

Literature Review and Background Research Methods

Prior to entering the field, HRA Gray & Pape historians conducted background research
focusing on appropriate secondary sources to establish a context for evaluation of the
significance of the Toledo Bend Dam and its associated spillway, hydroelectric facilities, and
other features. HRA Gray & Pape met with staff of the SRA-TX and the SRA-LA, and
reviewed the archival records, including documents, reports, photographs, and drawings held
on site. Local repositories, such as public libraries, also were consulted to gather information
on the Project area’s general historical development. Findings of the archival research were
used to establish a context for evaluation of the historical, architectural, and engineering
significance of the Toledo Bend Dam and its associated spillway, hydroelectric facilities, and
other features.

2.2

Architectural Field Methods

HRA Gray & Pape undertook the history/architecture survey with a two-person field team.
The survey included digital photo-documentation of the dam and its associated features.
Employees of the SRA-TX escorted the survey team throughout the facility and provided
access to areas, such as beneath the spillway, that are not publicly accessible. Representative
photographs of the exteriors of all buildings and structures were taken, as well as interior
photographs of the power generating building and spillway.

2.3

National Register of Historic Places Evaluation Criteria

2.3.1

Evaluation Criteria

Every building within the Project APE was examined for its potential to meet the criteria for
National Register eligibility. Four criteria are outlined for evaluating properties for eligibility
and inclusion in the National Register. These criteria are:
Ɣ Criterion A: Association with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history;
Ɣ Criterion B: Association with the lives of persons significant in our past;
Ɣ Criterion C: Embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic
values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components
may lack individual distinction; and

4
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

Ɣ Criterion D: Yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or
history (United States Department of the Interior, National Park Service [USDOINPS] 1995:2).
2.3.2

Criteria Considerations

Certain properties, such as museum artifacts, cemeteries, birthplaces or graves of historical
figures, religious properties, moved structures, reconstructions, or commemorative
monuments, and properties less than 50 years old, generally are not eligible. However, they
may qualify if they are part of historic districts or meet one of the following criteria
exceptions.
Ɣ A. A religious property deriving primary significance from architectural or artistic
distinction or historical importance; or
Ɣ B. A building or structure removed from its original location but which is significant
primarily for architectural value, or which is the surviving structure most importantly
associated with a historic person or event; or
Ɣ C. A birthplace or grave of a historical figure of outstanding importance if there is no
other appropriate site or building directly associated with his productive life; or
Ɣ D. A cemetery that derives its primary significance from graves of persons of
transcendent importance, from age, from distinctive design features, or from
association with historic events; or
Ɣ E. A reconstructed building when accurately executed in a suitable environment and
presented in a dignified manner as part of a restoration master plan, and when no
other building or structure with the same association has survived; or
Ɣ F. A property primarily commemorative in intent if design, age, tradition, or symbolic
value has invested it with its own historical significance; or
Ɣ G. A property achieving significance within the past 50 years if it is of exceptional
importance (USDOI-NPS 1995:2).

3.0 HISTORIC CONTEXT FOR THE AREA OF POTENTIAL
EFFECTS
Historic contexts assist in the interpretation of the cultural resources identified during this
survey. This chapter provides an overview of the history of the Project area vicinity. The
historic context is not intended to be a comprehensive history; rather, it is intended to provide
a framework within which to associate historic architectural resources identified in the
Project area and to aid in the evaluation of their potential eligibility for listing in the NRHP.

3.1

Toledo Bend, Louisiana/Texas

The Toledo Bend area includes land on both sides of the Louisiana/Texas border at Newton
County, Texas, and Sabine Parish, Louisiana. Today, Toledo Bend is most closely associated
with the Toledo Bend Dam, which straddles the Louisiana/Texas border at Toledo Bend, and
the Toledo Bend Reservoir, which extends along the Louisiana/Texas border from Toledo
Bend to Logansport, Louisiana. Toledo Bend remains largely rural, with extensive stands of
conifers and hardwood trees dominating the low-lying, undulating landscape. Aside from
facilities associated with the dam and reservoir, the only community of any size in the area is
located at South Toledo Bend, Texas, roughly one-and-one-half miles west of the dam. The
community consists largely of lakeside houses and trailers.
Local histories suggest that Toledo Bend might have received its name from Colonel Jose
Alvarez de Toledo, who fought against the Spanish during the Mexican fight for
independence. The settlement of Toledo Bend, however, appears to predate the life of
Colonel Toledo. A more plausible explanation attributes the name to Spanish explorers, who
might have compared the site to a bend in the Tagus River at Toledo, Spain (Sabine Index
1994).
Today, the Toledo Bend Dam and Reservoir dominate this early Sabine River settlement.
The initial stages of this Project commenced during the early-to-mid 1950s, when engineers
studying the feasibility of damming the Sabine River concluded that Toledo Bend offered the
most practical site for building a massive, earthen embankment. Following approximately 12
years of extensive planning and lobbying, earth turning ceremonies for the dam occurred near
Toledo Bend on October 5, 1961. Construction commenced in April 1964 and continued
through the fall of 1969. According to the SRA-LA, “Toledo Bend Reservoir is the only
public water conservation and hydroelectric project in the nation to be undertaken without
federal participation in its permanent financing” (Longview News-Journal 1964d: 12; ToledoBend.Com 2007a; SRA-LA 2007).
As completed, the Toledo Bend Reservoir features a shoreline measuring approximately
1,130 miles in length. The impoundment inundates land in Sabine and De Soto, Parishes,
Louisiana, and Newton, Panola, Sabine, and Shelby Counties, Texas. The Authorities
developed the Toledo Bend Project as a water supply facility to serve the long-term
6

municipal, industrial, and irrigation water needs of the region. The Project is also a multipurpose resource, providing renewable hydroelectric power generation and a variety of
recreation uses. It also comprises one of the most successful bass fishing destinations in the
country. In addition, 2 state parks and 24 other public recreation areas–including the Sabine
National Forest and Indian Mounds Wilderness Area–are located along the reservoir’s
shoreline, making it one of the largest concentrations of parks and public recreation facilities
in the country (Authorities 2009).

3.2

Sabine Parish, Louisiana

Encompassing 1,008 square miles, Sabine Parish, Louisiana, is located on the western border
of Louisiana, along the east bank of the Toledo Bend Reservoir. During the 1950s and 1960s,
many of Sabine Parish’s residents strongly supported to the Toledo Bend Project. Among the
leading campaigners of the dam was a Many High School teacher and real estate developer
named Cliff Ammons. Believing in the reservoir’s potential for tourism, Ammons ran for the
state senate on a “Let’s Build Toledo Bend Dam” platform. Ammons’s unwavering focus and
determination were instrumental to the passage of the Toledo Bend Dam Bill. The resulting
dam and reservoir proved a boon to the local economy, creating a significant tourism
industry for Sabine Parish that has continued to the present day.

3.3

De Soto Parish, Louisiana

De Soto Parish is located on the east side of the Toledo Bend Reservoir, immediately north
of Sabine Parish, Louisiana. Due to the poor state of the local economy, many of De Soto
Parish’s residents offered strong support for the Toledo Bend Project in the 1950s and 1960s.
Optimistic about the prospects of tourism, local advocates helped campaign and vote for the
Toledo Bend Amendment 8, which provided the necessary financing of the Project (Ammons
1979: 3E; Clements 1999: 313). In the decade following completion of the dam and
reservoir, De Soto Parish experienced population growth for the first time since 1940.
Federal census records indicate that between 1970 and 1980, the population increased about
13 percent. Precisely how much of this growth stemmed from completion of the dam remains
uncertain. Unemployment and poverty have remained in De Soto Parish, with about 25.10
percent of the population living below the poverty line as of 2000 (United States Census
Bureau 1940-2000).

3.4

Vernon Parish, Louisiana

Vernon Parish is located southeast of Sabine Parish, Louisiana and east of Newton County,
Texas and encompasses only a small fraction of the Toledo Bend Reservoir. Vernon Parish
was established in 1871, when the State of Louisiana took land from the Natchitoches,
Rapides, and Sabine parishes. There are many stories concerning the origin of the parish
name, but the state recognizes that Vernon Parish is named after Mt. Vernon, the home of
President George Washington (Louisiana.gov 2011).

Newton County, Texas

Newton County is located in southeastern Texas, bordering Louisiana. Located in the East
Texas timber belt, the county covers 950 square miles of forested, rolling terrain. Longleaf
and shortleaf pines, magnolia, hickory, and cypress trees comprise much of the foliage found
in Newton County.

3.6

Sabine County, Texas

Located in east Texas and north of Newton County on the Sabine River/Louisiana border,
Sabine County is one of the original counties of Texas. In a bid to reverse years of decline,
local legislators began campaigning for a massive dam and reservoir project on the Sabine
River. After years of tireless promotion, local reservoir advocates secured the necessary
legislation and funding to start the Project. Construction began in 1964 and, by 1969, the
Toledo Bend Reservoir was largely complete, with a hydroelectric power plant generating
electricity on the Texas side of the dam. The Toledo Bend Project fueled an era of economic
growth in the Sabine County area. By 1970, the number of manufactories had increased to 18
and the value of farms had increased to $32 million (White and Toole 1972).

3.7

Shelby County, Texas

Shelby County, Texas is located south of Panola County, north of Sabine County, and west
of De Soto and Sabine Parishes, Louisiana. The Toledo Bend Reservoir comprises the
county’s eastern border.

3.8

Panola County, Texas

Panola County, Texas is located north of Shelby County, Texas and west of De Soto and
Parish, Louisiana. The Toledo Bend Reservoir comprises a portion of the county’s eastern
border. The name Panola originated from the native word for cotton, panolo (LaGrone 2011).

3.9

Sabine National Forest

Located along the west bank of Toledo Bend Reservoir in east-central Texas, the Sabine
National Forest is one of four national forests located in the Piney Woods of East Texas. The
forest covers 64 acres in Jasper County, 95,410 acres in Sabine County, 4,317 acres in San
Augustine County, 59,037 acres in Shelby County, and 1,781 acres in Newton County (Texas
State Historical Association 2010a).
During the 1960s, the eastern portion of the Sabine National Forest became the site of the
Toledo Bend Project. Construction of the dam and reservoir required the removal of
thousands of trees within the forest but the resulting reservoir provided a significant tourist
attraction. The Project spawned commercial and residential development in the area around
8

the national forest, creating demand for additional campgrounds and picnic areas (Rhodes
2008: 9).

3.10 The Sabine River
The name “Sabine” is Spanish for “cypress.” The name appropriately describes the Bald
Cypress-lined banks of the river, as it meanders through lower East Texas/West Louisiana.
Flat slopes and wide, low-lying floodplains characterize the Sabine River basin. Soils in the
upper reaches of the river consist of deep sandy loams, loamy sands, and sand. A wide
variety of trees grow along the upper reaches of the river, including longleaf and shortleaf
pines, post, southern, red and white oak, and dogwood. Also in the area, cottonwood,
cypress, hackberry, pecan, blackgum, hickory, and blackjack oak cover the surrounding
landscape. Native grasses include little and big bluestem, Indian, switch, grama, and Virginia
rye. Along the lower stretches of the Sabine, the landscape consists of flat terrain consisting
of sand, gravel, and mud. Due to the swampy nature of the lower Sabine, trees typically
consist of water tolerant varieties, such as Bald Cypress (Texas State Historical Association
2010b).
Unusual for Texas rivers, the Sabine River flows through an area that receives abundant
rainfall. The headwaters of the Sabine experience on average 37 inches of rainfall per year
while the mouth sees about 50 inches per year. The river meanders through sandy country,
which helps conserve runoff. In addition, a great many tributaries and springs feed water to
the river, giving it a strong flow for its length. Due to high rates of rainfall along the Sabine,
the basin experiences frequent flooding, with major floods occurring about every five years.
The Sabine constitutes the largest volume of river discharge in the State of Texas (Texas
State Historical Association 2010b).
During the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, a series of large reservoirs were constructed along the
Sabine River. The farthest upstream water control structure on the mainstem of the Sabine
River system is Lake Tawakoni. Lake Tawakoni is formed by the Iron Bridge Dam, located
at approximately river mile (RM) 501. The reservoir lies at the junction of the South and
Cowleech forks in Hunt, Rains, and Van Zandt Counties, Texas. The reservoir and the Iron
Bridge Dam are owned and operated by the SRA-TX for water conservation and municipal
water supply with no design capacity for flood control. The Iron Bridge Dam consists of a
rolled earth embankment and a concrete ungated spillway.
The Lake Fork Dam, also located upstream of the Toledo Bend Project, is owned and
operated by the SRA-TX and is used primarily for municipal and industrial water supply with
no design capacity for flood control. This reservoir is located on Lake Fork Creek, which is
confluent with the Sabine River at RM 433. The Lake Fork Dam is an earthen dam with five
20-feet-by-40-feet Tainter gates controlling the flow of water over the spillway.
The Toledo Bend Project, the Sabine River’s only hydroelectric project, is located
downstream from Iron Bridge and Lake Fork dams. The Project was jointly developed by
the Authorities. Located at RM 147 of the Sabine River, the Toledo Bend Dam, impounds
9
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

the 70-mile long Toledo Bend Reservoir which extends along the Louisiana/Texas border
upstream from the dam to Logansport, Louisiana. The Toledo Bend Project was conceived,
licensed, developed, and primarily functions as a water supply facility, with secondary uses
of hydroelectric power generation and recreation. Today, the Toledo Bend Reservoir
constitutes the largest manmade body of water in the South and the fifth largest in the United
States (Texas State Historical Association 2010b).

3.11 Sabine River Authority of Texas and the Sabine River Authority,
State of Louisiana
Created by the 51st Texas State Legislature of 1949, the SRA-TX is a water conservation and
reclamation district. Consisting of a nine-member board, it oversees control, storage,
preservation, and distribution of water from the Sabine River and its tributaries within the
State of Texas. The watershed includes all or parts of 21 counties and extends to the
midstream boundary of the Sabine River, which separates Texas from Louisiana (The
Longview News-Journal 1964: 13; SRA-TX 2010).
The State of Texas organized the SRA-TX in response to rapid industrial expansion in the
Sabine River basin area following World War II. Requiring more water for industrial
development, the State of Texas found it necessary to develop better management strategies
for utilizing the waters of the Sabine. To this end, the SRA-TX assumed responsibility for
construction of dams, reservoirs, water supply installations, navigation, and any other
facilities necessary for Sabine River management. The SRA-TX maintains its facilities
through the sale of water, hydroelectric power, and recreation fees (Browning 1973: 3;
Sabine River Authority of Texas 2010).
To help retain and develop its share of Sabine River water, the Louisiana State Legislature
organized the SRA-LA in 1950. The Louisiana authority took control of water management
on the Louisiana side of the Sabine River basin, including all tributaries to the river and the
east half of the Sabine River itself, between the beginning of the Louisiana/Texas state line at
Logansport, Louisiana, and Sabine Lake. By 1951, the two states, in conjunction with
Congress, developed the Sabine River Compact, which provided for the equal division of
Sabine River water, as it existed between the beginning of the state boundary at Logansport
and Sabine Lake. Thereafter, the two organizations worked together to conserve and develop
waters of the Sabine River Basin (Sabine River Authority of Texas 2010).
During the mid-1950s, the two states initiated a study to investigate the practicality of
building a dam and reservoir on the Sabine River. Engineers concluded that Toledo Bend,
located on the Sabine River at the northern boundary of Newton County, Texas, offered the
best location for such a project (Ammons 1979: E3). Actual construction of the Toledo Bend
Dam began in 1964. A joint operation organized and conducted by the Authorities, the
Toledo Bend Project aimed to conserve water, generate electricity, and provide a source of
recreation. Completed during the late 1960s, Toledo Bend Reservoir extends 70 navigational
miles upstream from Toledo Bend Dam. The reservoir includes approximately 1,130 miles of
shoreline, located in Newton, Sabine, Shelby, and Panola Counties, Texas. On the Louisiana
10
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

side of the reservoir, the shoreline extends through Sabine and DeSoto Parishes (SRA-TX
2010).
The largest manmade body of water in the American South, Toledo Bend Reservoir covers
185,000 acres and has a storage capacity of 4,477,000 acre-feet. The states of Texas and
Louisiana hold equal shares in the reservoir’s yield, which amounts to 1,851 million gallons
of water per day. Much of this water passes through the hydroelectric power plant prior to
flowing downstream, where it then becomes available for municipal, agricultural, and
industrial use. Annually, the power plant generates 207 million kWh (SRA-TX 2010).

3.12 Origins of the Toledo Bend Project
As early as 1937, the United States Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) conducted preliminary
studies of the Sabine River in an attempt to locate potential improvement projects. By 1940,
the Corps had delivered an unfavorable report regarding the feasibility of Sabine River basin
improvements. Their report indicated that the Corps could not economically justify any
improvements to the Sabine River basin at that time (Longview News-Journal 1964b: 11;
Sabine Index 1988: 16C).
By the late 1940s, however, conditions along the Sabine River had changed dramatically.
Having relied largely on the timber industry to support the local economy, rural communities
of West Louisiana/East Texas found themselves struggling to survive following the depletion
of the region’s available timber reserves. Mill closures during the 1920s and 1930s, in
combination with the effects of the Great Depression, left many of the region’s residents
without work. As a result, the local population rapidly declined in the post-war years, as men
and women left the area in search of work (Clements 1999: 311-312).
As rural areas of East Texas and West Louisiana declined during the late 1940s and 1950s,
urban centers, like Dallas and Beaumont, Texas, quickly expanded. Requiring increasing
amounts of water for residential, industrial, and agricultural development, these communities
initiated construction of dams and diversion canals on the nearby Sabine River. Unregulated
diversion of the river’s water, however, alarmed the State of Louisiana, which shared 200
miles of the Sabine River with neighboring Texas. In response, Louisiana requested a
meeting between the two states. Moderated by the federal government, the meeting of May
1948 resulted in a water-sharing agreement. The compact ensured an equal division of any
Sabine River water lying between the beginning of the state boundary at Logansport,
Louisiana, and the Gulf of Mexico. The compact also provided for the protection of the river
as a potential navigation corridor (Ammons 1979: E3).
Within a year of signing the compact, the State of Texas created the SRA-TX. The State of
Louisiana followed suit in 1950, when it organized the SRA-LA. The two organizations
assumed responsibility for the conservation and development of the Sabine River (Clements
1999: 311-312). In 1953, the Authorities signed the Sabine River Compact. Ratified by
Congress in 1954, the compact provided the basic law by which the states of Louisiana and
11
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

Texas could develop the Sabine River (Browning 1973: 3; The Longview New-Journal
1964c: 11; Sabine Index 1988: 16C).
In 1955, under memorandum of agreement, the Authorities initiated procedures for
conducting a Toledo Bend feasibility report. Released by Forrest and Cotton Engineering
Consultants in 1958, the feasibility report indicated that the landscape along the length of the
Sabine River lent itself well to reservoir development. Additional studies by Forrest and
Cotton and the Corps determined that a dam built at Toledo Bend in Northern Newton
County, Texas, could create an impoundment that would extend 65 miles upstream to
Logansport, Louisiana. Such a reservoir would provide adequate water storage for
residential, industrial, and agricultural development in the West Louisiana/East Texas area.
In addition, the dam could generate hydroelectric power and provide a significant source of
recreation, attracting tourists from around the region (Ammons 1979: E3; Clements 1999:
312).
Although the proposed Project offered many potential benefits, it received mixed reviews
from the local public. Many residents strongly believed that the dam and reservoir were the
answer to the region’s economic problems. Others, however, feared the loss of their land.
Approximately 300 families lived on farms within the proposed reservoir site. In addition,
numerous cemeteries, churches, and stores dotted the landscape along the length of the river.
More significant to the fate of the Project, however, was the presence of numerous lumber
companies, who owned much of the cutover timberland on the Louisiana side of the river.
These well-financed companies did not intend to relinquish potential pulpwood and lumber.
Similarly, on the Texas side of the river, a large percentage of the land lay within the Sabine
National Forest, where reforestation projects of the 1930s had provided for new stands of
harvestable timber. In addition to a high price tag of $60 million, the Toledo Bend Project
posed a serious challenge for its supporters (Ammons 1979: 3E; Clements 1999: 312).
Despite these obstacles, a number of residents from local parishes took charge of the
promotional campaign. With an unemployment rate of 20 percent, and a recent loss of local
population amounting to as much as 25 percent, Sabine and De Soto parish residents found
themselves desperate to improve local economic conditions (Ammons 1979: 3E). Most
notable among the dam’s supporters was Cliff Ammons, a Many High School teacher and
real estate developer. Having organized the meeting between the states of Texas and
Louisiana during the Sabine River conflict of the late 1940s, Ammons assumed a prominent
role in the overall development of the Project. A tireless supporter of the cause, in 1959, he
ran for the Louisiana House of Representatives on a “Let’s Build Toledo Bend Dam”
platform. Despite a lack of political experience, and a controversial platform, Ammons won
the election (Ammons 1979: 3E; Clements 1999: 313; Raiford 1999: 36).
Upon election to the Louisiana State House of Representatives, Ammons organized a
publicity stunt for the Toledo Bend Project. With a fleet of 14 outboard boats, christened the
Toledo Bend Flotilla, Ammons led a contingent of West Louisiana legislators down the
Sabine River from Toledo Bend to the intercostal canal then up the Atchafalaya and
Mississippi Rivers to the state capitol at Baton Rouge. The fieldtrip garnered appreciation for
12
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

the proposed Toledo Bend Project but did little to motivate legislators to act. Citing financial
difficulties, the head of the state Public Works Department, Lawrence Wimbley argued that
the time was not right for the State of Louisiana to tackle such a large project. Wimbley went
so far as to assert that Ammons would not only hang himself with his proposed dam bill, he
would ruin his own political career and make himself the laughing stock of the legislature.
Despite Wimbley’s stern warning, Ammons persisted (Ammons 1979: 3E; Raiford 1999:
36).
With help from bond attorney Fred Benton, Jr., Ammons located $40 to $50 million in an
escrow fund known as the Tidelands. Consisting of royalty payments paid on oil that came
from disputed state and federal land, acquisition of the funds depended on the outcome of a
court trial between the State of Louisiana and the federal government. Although considered a
long shot, Benton and Ammons prepared a bill that would direct $15 million from the escrow
account to the Toledo Bend Project, given that the State of Louisiana successfully acquired a
share of the royalty payments. After considerable political maneuvering, Ammons’ Toledo
Bend Bill passed through the state legislature. To his disappointment, however, Ammons
quickly discovered that his bill fared little chance of actually securing any of the Tidelands
money. Consequently, Ammons began work on a second Toledo Bend Bill (Ammons 1979:
3E).
With political and technical support from then-Governor Jimmie Davis, Ammons located a
second source of funding for the Toledo Bend Project. Consisting of $15 million from a
property tax levied for the benefit of Civil War veterans, the money served little purpose by
the late 1950s. The governor’s financial advisor, Jim Riley, drafted Toledo Bend Bill No. 2,
which proposed diversion of the property tax to the Department of Public Works for 10 years
(1961-1971). The Department of Public Works would then use the money to build the Toledo
Bend Dam (Ammons 1979: 3E).
Altogether, the second bill provided for the use of $15 million from the Civil War veterans
fund as well as the issue of $30 million worth of revenue bonds. Sold by the states of
Louisiana and Texas, the value of the bonds lay rooted in a contract with power companies,
who agreed to purchase power from the proposed hydroelectric power plant at a rate of
nearly $2 million per year. Texas supplied the remaining $15 million toward the estimated
$60 million construction costs (Ammons 1979: E4). Financing for the Project avoided the use
of federal funds, making the Toledo Bend Project the only public water supply and
waterpower system funded entirely by state money (Browning 1973: 4).
Despite considerable opposition from Sabine River timber interests and property owners,
Ammons succeeded in getting Toledo Bend Bill No. 2 through both the Louisiana Senate and
House of Representatives. The proposed constitutional amendment, however, met opposition
once again when it came up for vote on the November 1959 ballot. The timber interests
raised $100,000 to hire a professional pubic relations firm, who attempted to undermine the
Toledo Bend Dam campaign. In response, proponents of Toledo Bend Dam countered with
publicity stunts of their own. As a result, the issue attracted significant attention throughout
the state. Despite the presence of over 100 constitutional changes listed on the ballot, Toledo
13
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

Bend Amendment No. 8 garnered more votes than any other amendment. Indeed, the number
of votes exceeded previous records for the number of votes received for any one amendment.
Toledo Bend Amendment No. 8 passed by a wide margin, carrying all but three of the state’s
parishes (Ammons 1979: A5E).
Because Texas had already built Lake Tawakoni on the upper reaches of the Sabine River,
Toledo Bend Project voters residing west of the Sabine River had less difficulty visualizing
the ultimate outcome of the reservoir. In addition, the dryer climate of Texas created a more
obvious need for water storage. Due to this latter fact, the state already had a fund in place to
finance water projects. Consequently, Texas secured its half of the funding soon after
Louisiana passed the Toledo Bend Bill (Ammons 1979: 5E).
Upon passage of the necessary legislation, Louisiana and Texas negotiated deals with three
power companies for the sale of Toledo Bend energy. Central Louisiana Electric Company,
Louisiana Power and Light, and Gulf States Utility collectively agreed to purchase nearly $2
million worth of electricity per year for 40 years. The sale agreement enabled the two states
to issue $30 million in revenue bonds. Made available for bid at a special joint meeting of the
Authorities, the bonds sold for 3.36 percent or 0.37 percent better than was required to
finance the Toledo Bend Project (Ammons 1979: 5E).
The final obstacle to construction of Toledo Bend Dam involved the Federal Power
Commission (FPC) and approval to dam the Sabine River. Because the Sabine River
remained potentially navigable, any impediment to possible river traffic violated the Rivers
and Harbors Act of 1899. Engineers, however, provided the FPC with drawings that
illustrated the feasibility of building locks in the dam. If, at some point in the future, it
became necessary to reopen the river to navigation, the locks could facilitate movement of
barges between the lower reaches of the river and the reservoir. Satisfied with the proposed
plans, the FPC approved the damming of the Sabine River in October 1963 (Ammons 1979:
6E).
With funds secured and licenses/permits granted, the Toledo Bend Project transitioned into
the construction phase. The Project began with a formal survey of the shoreline. By May
1963, state agents began purchasing land for the reservoir, and by April of the following
year, contractor Massam-Johnson had begun work on the earthen dam (Ammons 1979: 6E).

3.13 Construction of Toledo Bend Dam and Reservoir
In addition to considerable financial and political wrangling, the creation of the Toledo Bend
Dam and Reservoir required roughly twelve years of extensive study and planning. The final
solution called for construction of a 9-million cubic yard, earth fill dam measuring 11,250
feet in length, including all saddle dikes. The dam would include a concrete spillway
structure, located on the left abutment on the Louisiana side of the river. The spillway would
measure 838 feet in length and include 11 Tainter gates, each measuring 40 by 28 feet. Also
included in the plan, a hydroelectric plant would rest in the right abutment of the dam, on the
Texas side of the river. The reservoir created by the Project would extend 65 miles upstream
14
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

of the dam, cover 197,660 acres, and store approximately 5,097,500 acre-feet of water
(Browning 1973: 3-4).
Massam-Johnson, General Contractors of Kansas City (later acquired by URS Corporation)
won the bid to build the Toledo Bend Dam, spillway, and hydroelectric plant. Forrest &
Cotton Consulting Engineers of Dallas, Texas, who had worked on the Toledo Bend Project
feasibility studies since at least 1955, supervised construction (Barton Rumsey interview).
The groundbreaking ceremony for the Toledo Bend Project occurred at Hadden’s Ferry on
October 5, 1961. Before a sizable crowd of excited onlookers, Texas Governor Price Daniel
and Louisiana Governor Jimmy Davis thrust their gold-painted shovels into the riverbank on
the Louisiana side of the Sabine River then moved to the Texas side of the river to complete
the process. Actual construction of the dam did not begin until April 1964 (Longview NewsJournal 1964d: 12; Toledo-Bend.Com 2007a).
Some tree removal at the dam site began as early as the fall of 1963. Loggers, however,
removed only the marketable timber (The Longview News-Journal 1964e: 8). Clearing
operations followed removal of that timber and, by April of 1964, engineers and surveyors
had begun conducting test borings and staking the construction site. These procedures
preceded earthmoving activities, which began with the excavation of the spillway and
powerhouse. Earth removed from these structures comprised a portion of the dam’s
embankment (Toledo-Bend.Com 2007a).
Much of the surrounding forest remained intact during the initial stages of dam construction
(Photos 18 - 24). The Authorities composed a tree removal schedule that enabled loggers to
remove marketable timber ahead of clearing operations (Toledo-Bend.Com 2007a).
Newspaper reports indicate that the Authorities budgeted $1,700,000 for completion of the
deforestation process. They had also set a date of July 1966 for commencement of tree
removal operations. The plan called for removal of trees along the proposed reservoir
shoreline from the dam to Pendleton. From there, they intended to clear a 1000-foot wide
channel to Logansport (Sabine Index 1965a: 1-A).
As of April 30, 1965, the Authorities had purchased 100,000 acres of the required 197,418
acres of land needed for completion of the reservoir. In addition, Massam-Johnson, Forrest &
Cotton, and the Authorities had 200 men employed in the construction of Toledo Bend Dam.
The Project, however, was 41 days behind schedule. The contractors intended to have
between 500 and 600 men working on the job by July or August, which, they hoped, would
help put the job ahead of schedule. Maintaining the construction schedule was necessary if
the contractor was going to enclose the dam by August 1966, the scheduled date for flooding
the reservoir. This would allow time for the reservoir to reach its operating capacity by
January 1, 1968, which would enable engineers to test the hydroelectric plant and get it ready
for the scheduled commencement of hydroelectric service on June 1, 1968 (Sabine Index
1965a: 1-A).

By July 16, 1965, construction crews had placed 4 million cubic yards of earth atop the dam,
bringing the dam to a height of at least 20 feet above the river bottom. This total constituted
nearly one-half the 9 million cubic yards necessary for completion of the dam. In addition,
construction crews had completed excavation of the powerhouse on the Texas side of the
dam, and most of the excavation for the spillway on the Louisiana side of the dam. Pouring
of concrete for the powerhouse was under way and crews were soon to begin pouring
concrete for the spillway (Sabine Index 1965b: 1-A).
Despite the addition of roughly 300 workers between April and December 1965, the
December 1965, Toledo Bend Dam progress report indicated that the Project was 119 days
behind schedule. Completed work included 76.7 percent of cofferdam construction and 92.3
percent of stripping excavation. They had also placed 50.0 percent of the required compacted
fill and 89 percent of the compacted impervious blanket within the dam. Construction crews
had poured 36.6 percent of the required mass concrete for the power plant structure and 12.7
percent of the concrete required for the spillway chute, stilling basin slabs, and approach
apron. Contractor Massam-Johnson had also completed 98.6 percent of the overlook
facilities. Altogether, the contractor had completed approximately 35.76 percent of the
specified work and had earned $7,942,357.50 (Sabine Index 1966a: 6-A).
Removal of trees from the reservoir basin continued at a steady pace. A progress report from
June 1966 indicates that Jeffcon Inc., of Monroe, Louisiana, had removed 3,125 acres of
trees or 81 percent of its tree-clearing contract on the Louisiana side of the reservoir. The
Authorities anticipated letting another 3,000- to 4,000-acre contract for the Texas side of the
reservoir. Additional contracts would transpire following the completion of land sales in the
reservoir basin. By the end of December 1965, the Authority had written checks for 112,457
acres of land. Combined with 34,200 acres of United States Forest Service land already
secured for the Project, the Authority had acquired 146,657 acres of the required 197,418
acres necessary for completion of the reservoir (Sabine Index 1966a: 6-A).
By August 1966, the scheduled deadline for closing the embankment, construction crews
were still two months away from completing the task. The dry summer months, however,
afforded construction crews an opportunity to move the dam closer to completion (ToledoBend.Com 2007a). By October, the embankment was ready for enclosure. During an
embankment closing ceremony at 9:00 am on Monday morning, October 3, 1966, dignitaries
from the Authorities, as well as members of local chambers of commerce, tossed shovel
loads of earth into the river, marking the beginning of the closing process. Immediately
following these ceremonial gestures, bulldozers proceeded to complete the task. By 2:40 pm
that same day, they had enclosed the embankment. With low flow facilities closed, the
Sabine River began to flood the reservoir basin (Sabine Index 1966b: 1-A; Authorities 1966:
3).
Prior to flooding of the reservoir, numerous gas transmission lines and utility lines required
relocation. Lines located closest to the rising reservoir required relocation first. The first of
these projects to reach completion was the relocation of the Tennessee Gas Transmission
Company and the Texas Eastern-Tailrace pipelines. Completed in March and December

1965, respectively, these projects preceded completion of the dam by a year or more.
Pipelines located farther north did not require relocation until later in the reservoir
development process. Consequently, United Gas Pipeline Company did not complete its
relocation project until June 1967. Located in the upper reservoir area, the pipeline relocation
projects of Magnolia Pipeline Company and Texas Eastern/Gulf did not reach conclusion
until March 1968 (Redding 1971: 15).
Although no towns existed within the Project area, at least 300 families occupied farms and
residences within the proposed reservoirs basin. Farm owners slowly moved from the basin
as the Authorities acquired their land. The first of these land acquisitions occurred in May
1963. Among those selling their land, Sadie Paddie earned the distinction of being the first
resident to move from the reservoir site. Sadie relocated to a brick housing project in Zwolle,
built specifically for former reservoir residents. Additional residents left the reservoir basin
through 1965 and 1966 (Ammons 1979: 6E).
In addition to the relocation of families, the Project required relocation of 16 cemeteries on
the Louisiana side of the river and ten on the Texas side required relocation. Texas completed
its cemetery relocation project by September 1966. Louisiana authorities completed its
relocation process by December 1967 (Redding 1971: 15).
A progress report, published on July 28, 1967, reveals that, up to that date, Massam-Johnson,
General Contractors had received $20,799,959.17 for 93.7% of the work specified through
Change Order No. 4, the most recent estimate for construction costs. Ultimately, construction
costs exceeded the original estimate by about $5 million, forcing the Authorities to cover the
difference. By July 1967, the SRA-LA was on schedule to meet its half of the overrun
obligation with cash received from the State of Louisiana and the SRA-TX. The cash
contributions followed the SRA-LA’s issuance and sale of SRA-TX Hydroelectric Revenue
Bonds Series 1967 (Sabine Index 1967: 2-C).
By the end of July 1967, 277 workers remained employed at the Toledo Bend Dam site.
Work in progress included the placement of concrete in the power plant and the tailrace
wingwalls. Workers had completed considerable concrete work on the tailrace. In addition,
crews finished painting the Tainter gates and their hoists. They also completed installation of
the seals for the Tainter gates. Concurrently, workers continued welding the structural steel
for the powerhouse. Additional work on the powerhouse included the sandblasting and
painting of five of the power intake gates as well as the partial assembly of power intake
gates. The contractor planned to install the gates in August. As the structural work for the
powerhouse progressed, contractor Brock and Blevins worked to erect the twin Kaplan
turbines, built by English Electric Corporation. Installation of electrical equipment associated
with the power plant and switchyard occurred in conjunction with other powerhouse
construction activities (Forrest & Cotton, Inc., 1968; The Longview News-Journal 1963;
Sabine Index 1967: 2-C).
Approximately ten months later, only 155 workers remained at work on the Toledo Bend
Project. By the end of April 1968, the contractor had completed much of the structural work
17
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

at the dam site. The roof on the powerhouse was largely complete and the electrical
contractor had completed nearly all of the work in the switchyard. Most of the electrical work
within the powerhouse was finished and the testing of equipment had commenced. The only
work remaining on the dam itself appears to have been riprap work (Sabine Index 1968a: 6B).
Relocation of roads and state highways continued as the reservoir slowly filled the basin. By
March 1968, Louisiana completed relocation of its Louisiana Highway 6 and Texas had
completed relocation of its Texas Highway 21. The relocation of these roads alone cost the
Authorities a combined $3.5 million. Completion of county and parish roads did not reach
completion until April 1970 (Redding 1972: 15).
Due to excessive rainfall in April 1968, completion of riprap work remained on hold for 13
days. During this period, the Sabine River Basin received 8.28 inches of rainfall. Despite the
heavy downpour, the Authority released no water from the reservoir. United States Weather
Bureau hydrologist John P. McAllister used this particular weather event to study the dam
and reservoir’s impact on flooding. Computer simulations conducted by McAllister indicated
that, had the dam not been in place, the Sabine River would have risen seven feet above flood
stage at Bon Wier in central Newton County, Texas (Sabine Index 1968a: 6-B).
Prior to the storm, the Authorities recorded a reservoir elevation of 158.78 inches above
mean sea level. With gates on the spillway closed throughout the month of April, the
reservoir quickly filled. By 9:00am, May 18, 1968, the reservoir reached the intended
elevation of 172 feet mean sea level or 4,477,000-acre feet of water; the designed power pool
capacity for hydroelectric operations (Sabine Index 1968a: 6-B; Redding 1971: 5).
The progress report for June 1968 showed that Massam-Johnson, General Contractor had
earned $23,509,011.18. The number of workers remaining on the Project totaled 135. These
men remained busy completing the detail work and cleanup effort associated with the
spillway and powerhouse projects. Some of the many items that remained included the
installation of guardrails, access ladders, and doors, as well as the removal of scaffolding and
temporary bridges used to reach various sections of the construction site. These tasks
continued as engineers and electricians completed installation of the turbines and allied
equipment. Also associated with the hydroelectric facility, the Gulf States Utilities Company
completed testing of the switchyard equipment (Sabine Index 1968b: 6-B).
Project planners scheduled completion of the power plant for May 1, 1968, but the
contractors failed to meet the target date. Not until January 1, 1969, did engineers test the
turbines and electrical equipment. However, leaks in the concrete wall surrounding the
turbines allowed water to enter the generator pit. Forrest & Cotton, Inc., consulting engineers
determined that the leakage did not constitute a threat to the safe operation of the plant.
Utility company engineers, however, disagreed. Consequently, Hugh Coughlin, a
representative for the power companies, refused to take possession of the plant. The
Authorities agreed to install a stainless steel liner in the generator pit housing to prevent
water from entering the chamber and the generator windings. Engineers correctly predicted
18
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

that, eventually, the leaks would seal themselves as sedimentation accumulated within the
tiny fissures of the concrete. Having addressed the problem for the short term, the power
companies took possession of the power plant on May 7, 1969 (Authorities 1972: 1-3).
Commencement of power generation at Toledo Bend marked the official completion of the
power plant. Some minor detail work might have remained, but the overall Toledo Bend
Project appears to have been largely complete by the spring of 1969. The resulting reservoir
earned the title of largest manmade body of water in the American South and fifth largest in
surface acres in the United States. The 65-mile long reservoir covered 185,000 acres,
inundating land in Sabine, Shelby, Panola, and Newton Counties, Texas, and Sabine and
DeSoto, Parishes, Louisiana.
With water storage and power generation underway, real estate and recreational development
remained one of the last tasks associated with the overall Project. The presence of partially
submerged tress along the waterline, however, hampered this effort. Although loggers
removed much of the marketable timber in the reservoir basin, the Authorities submerged
20,000 acres of timber and left another 30,000 acres partially submerged. The partially
submerged trees posed an obstacle to construction along the banks of the reservoir,
particularly with regard to dock and marina construction. Consequently, it became necessary
to remove remaining trees, located near the edge of the reservoir, with barge-mounted tree
cutters (Sabine Index 1969a: 1-A; Sabine Index 1969b: 5-A; Toledo-Bend.Com 2007b).
To assist with the tree removal process, Cliff Ammons and Dan Slay developed a bargemounted hydraulic knife, designed to cut trees up to 26 inches in diameter from as much as
10 feet below the surface of the water. Named the “Di Dipper,” the machine also included
dredging equipment and a pile driver for clearing boats lanes and building docks. Under the
name, the Toledo Boat Company, the Di Dipper went to work clearing timber along the edge
of the reservoir during the spring of 1969 (Sabine Index 1969a: 1-A; Sabine Index 1969b: 5A).
In addition to the Di Dipper, Raymond and Don Barnhill (Barnhill Brothers) of Many,
Louisiana, developed a tree-cutting barge of their own. They mounted a Drott Feller Buncher
atop a 20- by 40-foot barge. The buncher consisted of a pair of hydraulic clamps, which
pinched the trees off below the waterline. Capable of extending down to 10 feet below the
waterline, the buncher could cut trees up to 18 inches in diameter. The Barnhill Brothers rig
could cut as many as 50 trees per hour. The Barnhill Brothers removed the cut trees with a
clean-up barge (Sabine Index 1969a).
Cleared of trees, the Toledo Bend Reservoir shoreline offered great potential for swimming,
boating, and fishing. In the years following completion of Toledo Bend Dam and Reservoir,
real estate development and tourism increased significantly. The shoreline around the
reservoir now includes 2 state parks and 24 other public recreation areas–including the
Sabine National Forest and Indian Mounds Wilderness Area–making it one of the largest
concentrations of parks and public recreation areas in the country. The presence of these
public parks and recreation areas has led to the development of a great many private marinas
19

and resort complexes. Tourists from around the world now come to Toledo Bend Reservoir
to partake of the exceptional bass fishing (Authorities 2009: 1).

3.14 Design and Construction of Earth-fill Dams
As their name implies, earth-fill dams consist largely of earthen fill material. Depending on
the availability of construction materials, the nature of the building site, and the size of the
anticipated impoundment, the dam may either consist of a homogonous earthen embankment
or include a sloping impervious, or central impervious, core. Engineers design homogeneous
earth-fill dams when only one type of impervious material is available near the construction
site. Seepage through homogeneous dams is often controlled by means of a chimney drain,
which drains through a horizontal drainage blanket or drainage strip near the base of the dam.
Sloping impervious core earth-fill dams are more complex structures, and include some type
of impervious layer over the surface of the upstream face. Such dams lend themselves well to
enlargement, when greater capacity is required at a later date. The third type of earth-fill dam
contains an impervious core in the center of the embankment. Until the early 1970s, the
central core often consisted of hydraulic fill. Consisting of silt and clay, the hydraulic core
created an impervious layer within the center of the dam. Due to a near-failure of a hydraulic
fill dam in 1971, this type of construction has been abandoned (Kollgaard and Chadwick
1988:683-4).
The most critical consideration when designing an earth-fill dam involves location of the
spillway. Due to their earthen construction, earth-fill dams require an erosion-proof low-level
outlet and spillway system at some point along the length of the embankment or rim of the
reservoir. Located below the crest of the dam, the spillway is designed to prevent a Probable
Maximum Flood from topping the embankment. Spillways generally consist of one of three
basic designs. The first type includes an ogee control structure with a gravity chute located in
a dam abutment or saddle within the rim of the reservoir. The second uses the same type of
ogee control structure, but locates it within the earthen embankment. The third design
incorporates a tunnel or conduit system, known as a “morning glory spillway,” between the
reservoir and downstream face of the dam. The ogee spillways may include gates that dam
personnel can use to control the rate of overflow. Due to their unrestricted flow, overflow
gravity weirs offer greater flow capacity than tunnel or conduit spillways (Ibid: 675-6).
Construction of earth-fill dams requires extensive processing of the materials used in
construction. First, the desired material is screened and/or crushed to meet necessary
specifications. Screening is often performed on a “grizzly,” which consists of a vibrating
steel grate or mesh screen that contains 6- to 12-inch square holes. Set at a 45 degree angle,
the grizzly sorts fill material as it is poured over the screen. The processed fill is then spread
across the top of the embankment and compacted with road rollers and tractors. To optimize
compaction, construction crews wet down the previous layer on the embankment before
spreading the next layer. Each layer is kept to about 6 inches in thickness. Depending on the
design, the structure might require a variety of soil and sand mixtures, each placed at a
different layer or location within the dam embankment. The degree of the embankment’s
20
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

slope depends on the size of the dam, the size of the anticipated impoundment behind the
dam, and the composition of its fill materials (Ibid: 689-90).

3.15 History of Earth-fill Dams
The earliest known dams, built in Jordan ca. 3,000 B.C., were earth-fill dams enclosed in
masonry walls. By this date, the basic components of the modern earth-fill dam structure
were in place; that is, a watertight core, earthen embankments on either side of the dam, and
some form of erosion-resistant covering on the upstream face. During the Roman Empire
period, masonry played a critical role in earth-fill dam construction by providing protection
to the upstream side of the embankment. Using this combination of materials, earthen
embankment dams could be built as high as 79 feet, or about 36 feet higher than the largest
all-masonry dams (Billington et al. 2005:240).
During the Industrial Revolution, earth-fill dams became increasingly important for
generating waterpower. During this period, French theoreticians and British engineers
developed fundamental rules for constructing large earth-fill dams. French engineer Charles
A. Coulomb (1736-1806), for example, discovered that the cohesiveness of a given soil type
determined how well it resisted sliding. A number of Frenchmen further developed
Coulomb’s theories, which were soon put to use by British engineers. Between 1819 and
1824, structural engineer Thomas Telford (1757-1834) built the Glencorse earth dam.
Located near Edinburgh, the clay core and earthen embankment dam was the first large-scale
water supply structure in Britain (Ibid:240).
Across the Atlantic, Americans also built earth-fill dams. The first such structure, simply
called Mill Pond Dam, was built at Newington, Connecticut, in 1677. Thereafter, however,
few earth-fill dams were built in America until the beginning of the nineteenth century. Then,
as the Industrial Revolution took hold, the number of earth-fill dams built increased with
each passing decade. In 1810, Americans built 16 earth-fill dams. During the 1850s, they
built 70 earthen dams. Construction of earth-fill dams continued to increase rapidly in the
second-half of the nineteenth century, with a total of 417 dams built between 1890 and 1900.
Between 1900 and 1910, Americans built 1,626 earth-fill dams. This number more than
doubled during the 1930s and 1940s. In the post-World War II era, earth-fill dam
construction increased to 12,505 dams between 1950 and 1960, and to 20,726 between 1960
and 1970. The number then dropped to 12,564 by 1980 (Kollgaard and Chadwick 1988:674).
By 1980, the number of earth-fill dams exceeding 25 feet in height, and retaining a minimum
of 50-acre feet of water, totaled 61,321. Relatively few of these dams exceeded 100 feet in
height. The first such structure, the San Andreas Dam, was not built until 1870. Only 3 earthfill dams over 100 feet in height were built in the 1890s. During the 1930s, the number
climbed to 59, then to 138 during the 1950s. Between 1960 and 1970, the number increased
to 226 then decreased to 207 the following decade (Ibid:674).
Earth-fill dams became increasingly common due to three main design advantages. First,
earth-fill dams can be built on either earthen or rock foundations, whereas masonry dams
21
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

require a rock foundation; second, they can be built of any number of locally available
materials; and third, earth-fill dams typically cost about as much or even less to build as
concrete dams (Kollgaard and Chadwick 1988:674). As a result of these factors, about 85
percent of the country’s 70,000 dams are earth-fill embankment dams built in both the
nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Despite advances in concrete construction technology
since the late-nineteenth century, about 65 percent of the dams built after 1900 were earth-fill
dams (Billington et al. 2005:239-40).
Another key factor in the proliferation of earthen dam construction was the steady
improvement of excavation machinery. Picks, shovels, and horse-drawn scrapers remained
the primary earthmoving tools of dam construction until the early twentieth century. Steam
shovels became increasingly common during the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries, but these were designed primarily for excavating below ground level, meaning
they could do little in the way of grading. Not until the end of World War I did caterpillardrawn scrapers begin to replace animal power at dam construction sites. By the 1930s, dieselpowered bulldozers, tractors, power scrapers, draglines, and dump trucks moved earth in
volumes previously unimagined (Kollgaard and Chadwick 1988:685-87). These machines
enabled American contractors to build ever-larger earthen dams, and to build them at an
unprecedented rate. Combined with federal funds appropriated through the Flood Act of
1936, mechanized dam construction facilitated a veritable dam-building spree in the late
1930s and the post-war era.

3.16 Tainter Gates
Used to control the flow of water through spillways and over dams, the Tainter gate is a
radial arm floodgate. A Tainter gate features a set of two, triangular-shaped arms that connect
to a large, curved plate. In profile, the Tainter gate resembles a slice of pie, with the curved,
or convex, part of the gate facing upstream, against the flow of water. The steel arms that
support the faceplate anchor to a pair of trunnion bearings, located downstream of the
faceplate. The gate pivots on the trunnion bearings, enabling operators to raise or lower the
gate with an electric powered drum hoist and chain assembly. Invented by Theodore Parker
in the late-nineteenth century, the Tainter gate design became the property of Jeremiah
Burnham Tainter, who patented the gate under his own name in 1886. By 1889, the Corps
was installing Tainter gates on dams built across small rivers. Deemed too small and
unreliable for large dams, the Corps found it necessary to modify the Tainter gate design so
that it could be enlarged. Over time, the Corps created new shapes and supporting structures
for Tainter gates, making them more suitable for large-scale dams. Employed by the Corps at
dams throughout the country, the Tainter gate has been a common feature of Corps-built
dams since the late-nineteenth century (Billington et al. 2005:375).

3.17 Kaplan Turbine
A hydropower plant converts the energy of moving water into electrical energy by means of
hydraulic turbines. The flow of water acts against the turbine’s runner, which consists of a
series of vanes, blades, or buckets. The runner rotates in response to the pressure created by
22
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

the moving water. The spinning motion of the runner in turn drives an electrical generator
(McVarish 2008: 167).
Hydraulic turbines fall into two basic categories, which include impulse and reaction type
turbines. Impulse turbines typically follow the design developed by Lester Pelton. Known as
a Pelton wheel, this particular impulse turbine uses kinetic energy generated by a highvelocity jet to turn a runner, which consists of a collection of bowl-shaped buckets. The
operator of the Pelton wheel controls the volume of water striking the buckets by means of a
bulb-shaped needle in the nozzle (McVarish 2008: 167-168).
Reaction turbines operate differently than an impulse turbine in that the runner remains
entirely submerged within the runner chamber. These turbines conform to three basic
configurations. The first type, known as a radial-flow turbine, requires a flow of water that
enters the runner chamber perpendicular to the axis of rotation. A second type, known as a
mixed-flow turbine, uses a combination of radial and axial flow, wherein water flows
partially parallel and perpendicular to the axis of rotation. The Francis turbine, developed by
James B. Francis, is one of the more common examples of the mixed-flow turbine. In the
third type, known as an axial-flow turbine, water enters the chamber parallel to the axis of
rotation. The Kaplan turbine is the most common example of an axial-flow turbine (Agrawal
1997: 479; McVarish 2008: 167-168).
Developed between 1912 and 1922 by Austrian engineer Viktor Kaplan, the Kaplan turbine
is an evolutionary progression of the Francis turbine. Designed for low head applications, the
Kaplan turbine combines adjustable blades and wicket gates to operate efficiently over a
wide variety of flow conditions. Although similar, the Francis and Kaplan turbines differ in
the number of blades and the direction of flow entering the whirler chamber. The Kaplan
turbine features only 4 to 8 blades within the runner, as opposed to the 16 to 24 blades found
on a Francis turbine. These hollow blades attach to the hub of the Kaplan turbine in a way
that enables operators to adjust their pitch (Agrawal 1997: 479).
The Kaplan turbine operates within a closed conduit that extends from the intake to the
tailrace. Upon passing through the wicket gates, water enters the whirler chamber, which is a
narrow space between the ends of the guide vanes or wicket gates and the leading edge of the
runner. In the whirler chamber, the flow of water changes from radial to axial. This feature
provides one of the key distinctions from the Francis turbine, wherein water enters the
chamber radially (Agrawal 1997: 479).
A speed governor helps the Kaplan turbine maintain a constant rate of rotation. Fluctuations
in the head will cause the governor to adjust the pitch of the blades and the angle of the
wicket gates in a way that maintains maximum efficiency for the current flow conditions. A
critical feature for electrical generation, the constant rate of speed enables the Kaplan turbine
to drive a generator at a steady frequency (Singal et al 2009: 97).
The Kaplan turbine’s design enables it to operate efficiently in low head situations. For this
reason, the designers of the Toledo Bend Project chose to install a pair of Kaplan turbines in
23

the dam’s power plant. . Capable of being remotely operated remotely from the Sabine Plant
in Bridge City, Texas, the two turbines and their associated generators deliver a maximum of
92,000 kilowatts, with an estimated annual energy output of 205 million kilowatt-hours. The
turbines maintain optimum efficiency through a wide range of flow conditions, which
fluctuates from 172 feet above mean sea level to 162.2 feet amsl (Entergy 2009: 1;
Authorities 2009: 1).

Resource Descriptions

Arranged from north to south, the resource descriptions begin with the SRA-LA observation
platform near the north end of Toledo Bend Dam and ending with the SRA-TX observation
platform located near the south end of the dam. All but one resource, the Toledo Bend
Freshwater Fisheries, belong to the Authorities, who built the principal structures and
buildings between 1964 and ca.1969. The SRA-TX administrative office and the SRA-LA
engineering office are also located within the Project’s APE, but were constructed in the
1980s and 1990s. These resources comprise the Toledo Bend Project.
4.2.1

Sabine River Authority, State of Louisiana Observation Platform

The SRA-LA observation platform is located roughly one-third of a mile north of the
spillway (Figures A1 and A5). The building is located atop a bluff, just south of a long drive
and parking lot that extends east of Louisiana State Highway 191. The observation platform
offers an elevated vantage point for visitors to view the spillway, dam, and south end of
Toledo Bend Reservoir.
Massam-Johnson, General Contractors completed this facility by December 1965 (Sabine
Index 1966b: 6-A). The contractor built a similar observation platform just west of the power
plant on the Texas side of the dam.
The observation platform incorporates public restrooms under a flat, observation deck
(Photos 15 and 16). A hexagon-shaped building, the observation platform consists of
reinforced concrete construction clad with reddish/orange colored flagstone. The observation
deck itself consists of a concrete slab with steel rail and chain-link fence guardrails along the
perimeter of the hexagon-shaped platform. A steel staircase provides access to the
observation deck from the rear of the structure.
4.2.2

Fish Hatchery

Located roughly 1,200 feet northwest of the spillway on the Louisiana side of the reservoir,
the Toledo Bend Freshwater Fisheries facility maintains a striped bass stocking program for
Toledo Bend Reservoir and other Louisiana lakes and impoundments. Operated by Louisiana
Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, the fishery helps to maintain an ecological balance in
the reservoir by controlling the shad population with predatory striped bass (Burton Rumsey
interview 2010).

The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries dedicated the Toledo Bend Freshwater
Fisheries at Toledo Bend Dam on Saturday, October 6, 1979. Located on a two-acre parcel,
leased from the SRA-LA, the facility includes a 40- by 80-foot building, containing 3,200
square feet of laboratory and workspace. The building includes hatching vats for fish eggs,
holding jars, holding tanks for rearing fish fry, and a variety of equipment necessary for
growing striped bass (Sabine News 1979: 1).
The facility’s main building consists of a ca. 1979, rectangular, one-and-one-half story sidegabled building with a metal roof and metal siding. This vernacular building is strictly
utilitarian in design. The fish hatchery complex also includes at least three, small, metalsided utility sheds and a ca. 1990 modular dwelling. All of these buildings date from the late
1970s through the 1990s.
4.2.3

Toledo Bend Dam

Toledo Bend Dam is located at the south end of the Toledo Bend Reservoir (Figures A1 and
A4). The dam extends roughly north to south with the left abutment (viewed looking
downstream) located at the north end of the dam on the Louisiana side of the embankment
and the right abutment located at the south end of the dam on the Texas side of the
embankment. Construction of the dam began as early as April 1964, when Massam-Johnson
construction crews began excavating pits for the spillway and power plant foundations. Earth
removed from these sites provided material for the first layers of the earthen embankment
(The Longview News-Journal 1964e: 8). Enclosure of the embankment occurred on October
3, 1966, but work, such as the application of soil cement on the upstream side of the dam,
continued through 1968 and possibly the early part of 1969 (Sabine Index 1966a: 1-A; Sabine
Index 1968a: 6-B).
As built, the Toledo Bend Dam is a rolled, earth-filled embankment that extends
approximately 11,250 feet from the south abutment to the north abutment (Photo 17).
Construction of the embankment required 9 million yards of excavation, 8 million yards of
embankment, and 9,500 tons of steel. A layer of soil cement protects the upstream slope of
the embankment from erosion. The maximum height of the dam, from its base on the
streambed to the top, measures about 112 feet. The crown of the dam measures 25 feet in
width and rests at an elevation of 185 feet amsl (Authorities 2009: 1).
Construction crews used earth excavated from the spillway and powerhouse site to initiate
construction of the dam. Typical of earth-filled dam construction, the process for creating the
embankment would have required the steady application of moist, earthen material followed
by compaction with sheepsfoot rollers and other heavy equipment. Because the composition
of the fill material is critical to the overall strength and longevity of the structure, engineers
and construction workers would have closely monitored and manipulated the fill selection
and application process. At specific locations within the embankment, engineers would have
specified the application of pervious and impervious layers of fill material. These special
layers control seepage and drainage within the dam (see discussion on earth-filled dams).

4.2.4 Toledo Bend Reservoir
The Toledo Bend Reservoir extends along the Louisiana/Texas border between Logansport,
Louisiana and the Toledo Bend Dam at Toledo Bend, Louisiana/Texas. The reservoir
inundates land in Sabine and De Soto Parishes, Louisiana, and Sabine, Shelby, Panola, and
Newton Counties, Texas. Construction of the reservoir began with the commencement of
dam-building activities in the spring of 1964 (Authorities 2009: 1). Tree removal in the
reservoir basin occurred in stages between 1964 and 1969. Flooding of the basin began
following enclosure of the earthen embankment on October 3, 1966 (Sabine Index 1966a: 1A). A series of heavy downpours helped fill the reservoir quickly and by May 18, 1968, the
water level reached the intended operating capacity of 172 feet amsl.
With the reservoir elevation at 172 feet mean sea level, the impoundment totals 65 miles in
length, extending from Toledo Bend Dam to Logansport, Louisiana. At its widest point, the
reservoir measures about seven miles in width. It covers 185,000 acres and extends along
1,130 miles of shoreline. The reservoir receives water from a drainage area totaling 7,190
square miles. The impoundment has a controlled capacity of 4,477,000 acre-feet and a
maximum capacity of 5,097,000-acre feet of water, or a level of 175 feet amsl. The top
elevation of the power pool rests at 172 feet above mean sea level. The power-pool
drawdown elevation is located at 162.2 feet above mean sea level (Authorities 2009: 1-2).
Annually, the reservoir supplies downstream customers with 1,300,000-acre feet of water. If
the Authorities used the reservoir strictly for water storage, as opposed to power generation
and water storage, the impoundment could provide approximately 2,340,000 acre-feet
annually (Browning 1973: 5).
4.2.5

Spillway

The Toledo Bend Dam spillway is a reinforced concrete, gate-controlled gravity chute
located in the left abutment of the dam, on the Louisiana side of the reservoir (Figures A1
and A3). Forrest and Cotton, Inc. completed the spillway plans by December 1962.
Engineers originally scheduled construction of the spillway on the Texas side of the Sabine
River, near the powerhouse. They discovered, however, that the foundation was stronger on
the Louisiana side of the river (The Longview News-Journal 1964e:8). Because of planned
earth removal from the spillway and power plant site for partial construction of the dam,
excavation of the spillway occurred prior to commencement of other projects. Construction
on the spillway began about April 1964 and continued through the summer of 1968, with
only minor details and cleanup work remaining by autumn of the same year.
Measuring 838 feet in length, the spillway includes a series of eleven Tainter gates that
measure 40 feet wide by 28 feet high (Photo 10). Dam operators control the height of the
gates with electric-powered drum hoists, located over each of the gates (Photo 11). The
spillway also includes an 8.33- by 12-foot low flow sluice. The spillway has a designed
discharge of 290,000 cubic feet of water per second.

The spillway includes an approach channel, approach training walls, approach channel slab,
and a concrete gravity ogee weir with 11 Tainter gates (see discussion on Tainter gates) and
10 piers. Concrete retaining walls are located at each side of the spillway chute. A discharge
chute, 8,200 feet long, conveys spillway water to the Sabine River channel (The Longview
News-Journal 1964e: 8).
A concrete stilling basin, measuring approximately 110 feet in length, is located at the
downstream toe of the spillway (Photo 12). Designed to dissipate energy from the discharge
of floodwater, the basin contains a horizontal apron; a series of vertical, concrete baffles
along the width of the stilling pool; and a stepped end sill.
4.2.6 Maintenance Equipment Storage Buildings
The maintenance equipment and storage buildings are located just north of the power plant
on the east side of Farm to Market Road 692, on the Texas side of the dam. This facility is
located immediately south of the Texas/Louisiana border.
Built during the late 1960s or 1970s, this facility includes two, metal-sided storage buildings
and a fueling station. The larger of the two storage buildings consists of a vernacular, sidegabled pre-engineered building. Clad with galvanized, corrugated metal, the building
includes a series of six pairs of large overhead doors, located along the length of the south
façade. The overhead doors replaced the original swinging doors original to the building. A
smaller storage building is located immediately west of the larger building. This building also
features pre-engineered building construction, with corrugated metal siding and a series of
three overhead doors located along the length of the south façade. A large, gabled roof
building is located just north of these buildings. This structure consists of a pre-engineered
structure without walls that supports a metal roof. The facility also includes a pair of fuel
pumps, located under an open steel awning.
4.2.7

Office and Administration Buildings

Two office and administration buildings constructed during the 1980s and 1990s are located
within the Project boundary. The SRA-LA engineering office building consists of a
vernacular, rectangular-shaped one-story building with a gable on hip roof. The building
features a standing seam metal roof, brick clad walls, and windows with sliding aluminum
sash. The building rests atop a concrete slab foundation. The existing engineering office
building replaced a previous structure at the site that was destroyed by fire.
The SRA-TX administrative building is located just west of the Toledo Bend Dam, and near
the SRA-TX observation platform. This vernacular structure was built in the 1980s and
features a standing seam metal roof, brick-clad façade, and windows with aluminum sash.

4.2.8

Hydroelectric Power Plant

The hydroelectric power plant is located in the right abutment of the dam, on the Texas side
of the reservoir (Figures A1 and A2). The facility includes the power plant itself (Photos 1
and 2), which houses a pair of Kaplan turbines and a pair of generators (Photos 3 and 4);
intake gates (Photos 5 and 6), located in the right abutment of the dam; power tunnel (located
inside an earthen embankment); tailrace (Photos 8 and 9); and substation.
Designed by Forrest & Cotton, Inc., and built by Massam-Johnson, General Contractors, the
power plant building includes a substructure and superstructure. The substructure consists of
a reinforced concrete foundation that includes the power tunnel (leading from the intake to
the turbines); the vertical concrete spiral or scroll casings, which encase the wicket gates
leading to the turbines’ runners; and the draft tubes, which lead from the bottoms of the
runners to the tailrace (Entergy 2009: 2; McVarish 2008: 166).
The superstructure includes the housing that covers the generators and control equipment.
The Toledo Bend hydroelectric power plant building takes the form of a tall, Modernist, onestory, rectangular structure with a zigzag or butterfly roof (Photo 1 and 2). The seven gables
that comprise the roof rest atop a series of vertical, steel beams. The series of beams and
gables divide the length of the northeast and southwest facades into seven bays. The upper
half of the building features green corrugated metal siding and the lower half includes steel
sash industrial windows and flagstone cladding. A pair of tall, sliding doors is located in the
northeast façade of the building.
The power plant building contains two, 55,750 horsepower, Kaplan vertical shaft turbines
(see discussion on Kaplan turbines). English Electric Corporation built the turbines at a cost
of $1,292,017 (The Longview News-Journal 1964a:2). Between 1966 and 1969, Brock and
Blevins installed the turbines and the generators (Forrest and Cotton, Inc., October 11, 1968).
Rated at 40,500 kVA each at 0.95 power factor, the pair of water-cooled, umbrella type
generators have an installed capacity of 81 megawatts with an average annual energy output
of 239,635 megawatt hours (Entergy Corporation 2009: 1).
The twin turbines receive water from the reservoir via the intake, located near the right
abutment of the dam. The intake includes a series of debris racks along the edge of the
reservoir as well as a series of control gates (Photos 6 and 7). The racks prevent destructive
objects from entering the power tunnels and the gates control the flow of water entering the
tubes. From the intake, water flows through the power tunnels on its way to the scroll case
and the wicket gates. Operated automatically or manually, the wicket gates control the flow
of water entering the whirler chamber, which surrounds the turbine blades or runners. Water
flowing through the whirler chamber forces the turbine blades to turn. The wicket gates and
the pitch of the turbine blades adjust to the available head of water to ensure that the turbine
blades turn at a constant rate of 100 revolutions per minute. Upon flowing through the
runner, the water exits to the tailrace via a draft tube, located directly below the runner
(Entergy Corporation 2009: 1-2).
29
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

Attached to a generator by means of a direct drive shaft (Photo 3), the rotating blades of each
turbine (Photo 4) creates 13,800 volts alternating current (A.C.). From the generators, the
electricity travels through switchgear, which then routes the current to a transformer. The
transformer in turn steps the voltage up to 138,000 A.C. for transmission. The Sabine Plant in
Bridge City, Texas, operates the two generators via remote control (Entergy Corporation
2009: 1-2).
The planning committee scheduled completion of the power plant for May 1, 1968. The
contractors, however, did not begin testing the power plant until January 1, 1969. At this
time, leaks occurred in the concrete wall surrounding the turbines. As a result, the utility
companies refused to accept responsibility for the facility until the Authorities fixed the
problem. Following installation of a stainless steel lining in the chamber, the utility
companies took control of the plant. On May 7, 1969, the Toledo Bend hydroelectric power
plant commenced the generation of electricity (Authorities 1972: 1-3).
4.2.9

Sabine River Authority of Texas Observation Platform

The SRA-TX observation platform is located just west of the powerhouse (Figures A1 and
A2). The facility is located atop a bluff at the north end of a long winding drive that extends
westward and northward of Farm to Market Road 692. The observation platform offers
tourists a vantage point for viewing the south end of the Toledo Bend Dam, power plant, and
reservoir.
Massam-Johnson, General Contractors completed this facility by December 1965 (Sabine
Index 1966b: 6-A). The contractor built a similar tourist station just north of the spillway on
the Louisiana side of the dam.
The observation platform incorporates public restrooms under a flat, observation deck
(Photos 13 and 14). A hexagon-shaped building, the observation platform consists of
reinforced concrete construction clad with reddish/orange colored flagstone. The one-story
tall observation deck rests atop a pair of men’s and women’s restrooms. The observation
deck consists of a concrete slab with steel rail and chain-link fence guardrails along the
perimeter of the hexagon-shaped platform. A steel staircase provides access to the
observation platform from the rear of the structure.

5.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The Toledo Bend Project includes the reservoir, earth-fill dam, spillway, power plant,
maintenance-equipment storage buildings, Toledo Bend Freshwater Fisheries facility, office
and administrative buildings, and the Authorities’ two observation platforms, located at each
end of the dam. With the exception of the Toledo Bend Freshwater Fisheries facility, office
and administrative buildings, and maintenance-equipment storage buildings, all of these
resources date to the original period of construction for the Toledo Bend Project. Built
between 1964 and 1969, the Toledo Bend Project extended over a five-year period, with
much of the major work completed by late 1966 or early 1967. The fish hatchery, located on
the Louisiana side of the dam, postdates the Toledo Bend Project by more than a decade, as it
was dedicated in 1979. The maintenance-storage equipment buildings were built during the
late 1960s or early 1970s, and have been updated and modified several times since then. Two
additional office buildings constructed during the 1980s and 1990s are also located within the
Project’s APE.
The Toledo Bend Historic District is recommended as an eligible District for the NRHP
under Criterion A. A project conceived, planned, developed, and completed by two state
agencies, the Toledo Bend Project represents an unusual example of state cooperation. The
Toledo Project is significant for its effect upon economic growth and development in the
Sabine River basin. A major source of freshwater in the East Texas/West Louisiana region,
Toledo Bend Reservoir made possible the expansion of residential, agricultural, and
industrial development throughout the Sabine River basin. In addition, the reservoir has
become a significant source of recreation for tourists. The resulting tourist industry has
played a prominent role in local development, particularly in the parishes and counties that
border the Toledo Bend Reservoir.
As the largest manmade reservoir in the South and the fifth largest manmade reservoir in the
United States, the Toledo Bend Historic District is recommended eligible for the NRHP
under Criterion C. Requiring extensive clearing and excavation, the dam and reservoir
constitute a major engineering feat. Contractors labored for approximately five years,
excavating 9 million cubic yards of earth and building 8 million cubic yards of embankment.
The resulting earthen dam measures approximately 11,250 feet in length, providing a
bulwark against a reservoir that extends 70 navigation miles from Toledo Bend to
Logansport, Louisiana.
A resource that has achieved significance in the last 50 years, the Toledo Bend Historic
District is recommended eligible for the NRHP in conjunction with Criterion Consideration
G. Construction began in 1964 and extended through 1969, making the Toledo Bend Historic
District less than 50 years of age. However, from its very inception, the Toledo Bend Project
stood out as a notable endeavor, both for its size and its independence from federal financing.
Subsequent residential, agricultural, and industrial development further contributed to the
Project’s success and significance in the Sabine River basin.
31
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

The period of significance for the Toledo Bend Project is recommended to be 1964-1969,
encompassing the duration of construction and engineering activity at the property. The
earth-fill dam, spillway, power plant, and the Authorities’ two observation platforms are
recommended as contributing resources to the property. The following buildings and
structures are considered the contributing elements of the proposed Toledo Bend Historic
District:






Toledo Bend Dam
Spillway
Powerhouse
SRA-LA observation platform
SRA-TX observation platform

The historic boundaries for the property encompass the Project’s principal engineering
features located at the southern end of the Toledo Bend Reservoir, which itself contributes to
the visual aesthetic and significance of the district.
Built by the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries in 1979, the Toledo Bend
Freshwater Fisheries facility operates independently of the Authorities. Because the fishery
post-dates the Authorities-sponsored Toledo Bend Project, and because it does not function
as an integral component to the dam complex, it is recommended that this facility is a noncontributing resource within the Toledo Bend Historic District. The maintenance-equipment
buildings at the Toledo Bend facility are recommended as non-contributing resources
because they post-date the original Toledo Bend Project and they have been physically
altered and modified on repeated occasions over the years. The administration and office
buildings are recommended as non-contributing resources, as they are of relatively recent
construction, do not reflect the unique architectural and engineering elements of the Project’s
other principal facilities, and post-date the Project’s period of significance.
Relicensing of the Toledo Bend Project will continue to allow the dam and reservoir to be
used for the purpose for which it was designed. HRA Gray & Pape recommends a finding of
“no effect” to this eligible resource. Future renovations or repairs may require review prior to
initiation. The need and procedures for possible future review will be addressed in the final
HPMP.

ABSTRACT
The Sabine River Authority of Texas and the Sabine River Authority, State of Louisiana,
(collectively, the Authorities), own and operate the 81-megawatt Toledo Bend Project (FERC
No. 2305) (Project), located on the Sabine River in Panola, Shelby, Sabine, and Newton
counties in Texas and De Soto, Sabine, and Vernon parishes in Louisiana. An original license
for the Project was issued by the Federal Power Commission, the predecessor to the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or Commission), in 1963. The Authorities’ existing
license to operate the Project expires in September 2013. Consequently, the Authorities are
seeking a new license for the Project pursuant to the Integrated Licensing Process defined in
18 CFR Part 5 of the Commission’s implementing regulations.
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (Section 106),
requires federal agencies to consider the effects of their undertakings on historic properties
listed in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places. The
Commission’s issuance of a license for the Project is considered an undertaking, and is
therefore subject to the provisions and review process provided in Section 106. 1
The Project’s Area of Potential Effects has been defined to include all lands within the FERC
Project boundary. In general, the Project boundary encompasses the shoreline and submerged
areas around the Project within the topographic contour elevation of 53.3 meters (175 feet)
above mean sea level. The Area of Potential Effects also includes any lands outside of the
Project boundary where cultural resources may be affected by Project-related activities that are
conducted in compliance with the FERC license. The Authorities (2009) have identified three
Project-related activities with the potential to directly or indirectly affect archaeological
resources within the Project’s Area of Potential Effects: 1) Project operations; 2) shoreline and
aquatic recreation activities; and 3) routine maintenance activities. Examples of direct or
indirect effects include ground disturbance, erosion/sedimentation, looting, and vandalism.
HRA Gray & Pape, LLC’s primary task was to conduct an intensive desktop study and
background literature review to: a) identify previously reported cultural resources within the
Area of Potential Effects; b): define areas of the Area of Potential Effects most likely to
contain cultural resources; and c) identify where Project operations or activities are potentially
threatening the integrity of historic properties. Using Geographic Information System, this
desktop study resulted in the development of 2 predictive models; 1 was built to identify
favorable archaeological site locations and the other was used to depict portions of the Project
where Project activities have the potential to directly or indirectly affect archaeological
resources as outlined above. These models were married to create a single comprehensive
cultural resources map that identifies all of these areas in order of greatest archaeological
priority.

As state agencies, the Sabine River Authority of Texas and the Sabine River Authority, State of Louisiana are
also subject to the requirements of the Texas Antiquities Code (Chapter 191, Government Code of Texas) and
Title 25 of the Louisiana Administrative Code, respectively.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
The Sabine River Authority of Texas (SRA-TX) and the Sabine River Authority, State of
Louisiana (SRA-LA), collectively known as the Authorities, intend to relicense the Toledo
Bend Project (FERC No. 2305) (Project) in Texas and Louisiana through the Integrated
Licensing Process (ILP) as promulgated by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)
regulations (Authorities 2009). The current Project license extends until September 30, 2013.
Because the Commission’s issuance of a license is considered an undertaking, the Project is
subject to comply with the Section 106 review process as outlined in the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966. The principal goal of the Cultural Resources Study is to
collect sufficient information regarding cultural resources within the Project’s Area of
Potential Effects (APE) to assist the Authorities in developing a Historic Properties
Management Plan (HPMP) that will provide for the long-term management of historic
properties throughout the term of the license (Authorities 2009). As such, the primary
objectives for meeting these goals have been defined as:
(1) Identify through background research, desktop analyses, and field investigations
(including subsurface testing) cultural resources within the APE where Project
operations or activities are threatening the integrity of historic properties;
(2) Cooperatively develop with the Texas and Louisiana State Historic Preservation
Offices (SHPOs), the United States Forest Service (USFS), and federally recognized
Indian tribes a programmatic agreement providing for the satisfaction of the
Commission’s obligations pursuant to Section 106 in the relicensing process and for
the management of historic properties affected by Project operations or activities
during the new license term through an HPMP;
(3) Develop in consultation with the USFS, SHPOs, and federally recognized Indian tribes
appropriate protection, mitigation, or enhancement (PM&E) measures to avoid,
minimize, or mitigate adverse affects to the identified resources;
(4) Develop an HPMP in consultation with the SHPOs, the USFS, and federally
recognized Indian tribes that includes appropriate measures for the long-term
management of historic properties within the Project’s APE, including any PM&E
measures. The HPMP will include a schedule, process, and protocol for implementing
PM&E measures and completing additional studies.
The Authorities filed a Pre-Application Document (PAD) and associated Notice of Intent
(NOI) to initiate the formal ILP process in September 2008. In developing the PAD, the
Authorities requested HRA Gray & Pape, LLC (HRA Gray & Pape) of Houston, Texas
conduct preliminary site file (Soltysiak et al. 2008). The report prepared by HRA Gray & Pape
identified several previously reported archaeological sites within the APE. This information
was summarized in the PAD, and a draft study plan to address cultural resource issues was

CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

included as an appendix to the document submitted to FERC and distributed to consulted
parties.
Following the Authorities’ filing of the PAD and NOI, FERC issued Scoping Document 1
(SD1) on November 21, 2008 and convened scoping meetings and a site tour for agencies and
members of the public on December 16 – 17, 2008. As provided in 18 CFR § 5.11, the
Authorities developed a Proposed Cultural Resources Study Plan (Study Plan) to address
identified resource issues, study requests, and comments provided by agencies, stakeholders,
Indian tribes, and interested parties. The Study Plan was submitted for comment to members
of the Toledo Bend Cultural Resources Working Group (Working Group), comprised of
representatives of the Texas Historical Commission (THC), the Louisiana Division of
Archaeology (LDOA), FERC, the USFS, and federally-recognized native tribes whose
interests may be affected by the Project.
The Authorities developed and revised the Study Plan to incorporate comments from the
Working Group, and the Commission subsequently issued a Study Plan Determination letter
approving the Cultural Resources Study Plan on August 6, 2009. The USFS and the
Authorities continued consultation to resolve disputes associated with the Study Plan, and the
Authorities submitted a revised version of the plan on October 9, 2009. On October 14, 2009,
the Commission issued a Study Plan Modification to include additional subsurface testing as a
component of the field investigations associated with this study. The October 15, 2009
Findings and Recommendations of the Dispute Resolution Panel reaffirmed the modifications
to the Study Plan that were mutually agreed upon between the USFS and the Authorities. The
approved Study Plan is provided in an Appendix on CD-ROM at the back of this report.
In 2009, the Authorities contracted HRA Gray & Pape to complete the following 6 tasks as
outlined in the Study Plan (Authorities 2009): 1) additional background and documentary
research to supplement information gathered during the PAD development process; 2) desktop
analysis and the development of a comprehensive cultural resources map and pre-fieldwork
report; 3) archaeological field investigations of shoreline sites, including subsurface testing at
identified priority sites; 4) an architectural/engineering survey for buildings and structures
within the Project APE that may be eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP); 5) the preparation and submittal of technical reports; and 6) the preparation of
materials collected from state and federal lands for permanent curation.
This report has been prepared in fulfillment of Tasks 1 and 2 of the Study Plan (Authorities
2009). The objective of these tasks was to assist the Working Group in the identification of
priority loci to be investigated during the ILP. The desktop study resulted in the development
of 3 predictive models using Geographic Information System (GIS). The models assisted HRA
Gray & Pape with articulating concise management recommendations for Phase I field
investigations.

The Texas portion of the Project is located on a total of 21 United States Geological Survey
(USGS) 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle maps. These include: Hurricane Creek, Hemphill,
Negreet SW, Haddens, Milam, Salter Creek, East Hamilton, Patroon South, Patroon North,
Brushy Creek, Union Springs, Huxley, Shelbyville, Logansport East, Logansport West, Beech
Bayou, Galloway, Old Center, Tenaha East, and Toro.
The Louisiana portion of the Project is situated in Sabine, De Soto, and Vernon Parishes and
can be found on 19 USGS topographic quadrangle maps (Figure 1). These include: Long
Street, Logansport East, Logansport West, Hunter, Union Springs, Brushy Creek, Zwolle,
Beech Bayou, East Hamilton, Salter Creek, Negreet, Negreet SW, Loring, Toro, Haddens,
Milam, Huxley, Weirgate SE, and Galloway.
The Project is jointly operated by SRA-TX and SRA-LA through Toledo Bend Project Joint
Operations (TBPJO). Construction of the Toledo Bend Project on the Sabine River was
completed in October of 1966 and includes a reservoir covering 74,867 hectares (185,000
acres) with 1,931 kilometers (1,200 miles) of shoreline, a 3,429-meter (11,250-foot) long
rolled earth-fill dam, a 255-meter (838-foot) long concrete spillway, and a powerhouse
containing two 43,875-kilowatt (58,500-horsepower) vertical Kaplan turbines.
At its widest, the Toledo Bend Reservoir measures 11.3 kilometers (7 miles) across. The
normal maximum elevation of the reservoir is 52.4 meters (172 feet) above mean sea level
(amsl). Recorded water levels have ranged between 49.2 to 53 meters (161.3 feet to 173.9
feet) amsl (Authorities 2009). Based on this information, all area within the 53.3-meter (175foot) amsl contour around the Toledo Bend Project has been determined as the Project APE.
As defined in the Study Plan, the “....APE includes all lands within the FERC Project
boundary. The APE also includes any lands outside of the Project boundary where cultural
resources may be affected by Project-related activities that are conducted in compliance with
the FERC license” (Authorities 2009:4).
The Authorities identified 3 Project-related activities with the potential to directly or indirectly
affect archaeological resources within the Project APE: 1) Project operations; 2) shoreline and
aquatic recreation activities; and 3) routine maintenance activities. Direct or indirect effects
may include ground disturbance, erosion/sedimentation, looting, and vandalism (Authorities
2009).

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

The Toledo Bend Reservoir is located on the border of Texas and Louisiana and was created
by damming the Sabine River. The dam is located approximately 157 kilometers (97 miles)
north of the coastline. The impounded portion of the Sabine River extends approximately 93
kilometers (58 miles) up the Sabine River Valley. The drainage area of the Sabine River north
of the Toledo Bend Dam is 18,591 kilometers2 (7,178 miles2) (Authorities 2008).The Gulf
Coastal Plain geologic province is described as a low, level to gently sloping region extending
from Florida to Mexico (Reed and Bush 2007). The surface geology of this geologic province
consists of sedimentary deposits from the Tertiary and Quaternary periods of the Cenozoic Era
(Bureau of Economic Geology (BEG) Staff (BEG Staff 1996, USGS 2010). The basic
geomorphic characteristics of the Texas and Louisiana gulf coastal plains were formed by a
complex regimen of erosion and deposition that resulted from 2 related hydrogeomorphic
mechanisms: (1) major eustatic sea level changes; and (2) radical sediment load capacity
changes in the province’s rivers. Both of these mechanisms are related to glacial advance and
retreat in the northern part of the continent.
The surface is a series of sandy ridges eroded from tilted strata of alternating massive sand
beds and weakly cemented finer grained sedimentary rock that run parallel to the coast
(Barnes 1993, BEG Staff 1996). Originally deposited as marine sediments, regional uplift,
faulting, and erosion have resulted in a landscape of low rolling hills, with narrow ridges and
steep adjoining valleys. Iron and carbonate-cemented nodules and concentrations, lignitic silt
seams, black chert pebbles, and petrified wood gravels are part of these formations. Many
geological formations are shared across the border and have created a similar geomorphic
setting on both sides of the reservoir (Barnes 1993, BEG Staff 1996).
The northern half of the reservoir is underlain by the Paleocene Wilcox Group undivided.
Quartz sand, glauconite, silt, and clay are commonly expressed components of this formation.
Eocene formations occur in belts across the gulf coastal plain south of the Paleocene
formations. In the Project area, formations on the Texas side are somewhat different than those
on the Louisiana side. On the Texas side, Wilcox group, Recklaw Formation, Sparta sands,
Cook Mountain Formation, Yegua Formation, Moody’s Branch Formation, and Yazoo
Formation, represent the Eocene period. On the Louisiana side, the Eocene is represented
primarily by the Cockfield Formation and Sparta Sand. Narrow bands of Jackson Group, Cane
River Formation, and Cook Mountain Formation together only underlie approximately 6
kilometers (3.7 miles) of reservoir shoreline. The Oligocene/Eocene transition is represented
by Nash Creek on the Texas side but does not have surface expression on the Louisiana side.
However, the Oligocene Catahoula Formation is represented on both sides. Oligocene
Vicksberg Group underlies a small area at the southern end of the Louisiana side of the
reservoir. The Carnahan Bayou Member and Lena Member Miocene formations are expressed
on the surface on the Louisiana side and Fleming Formation from the same period is expressed
on the Texas side.
Faults trending generally east-west are mapped coincident with the southern boundary of the
Paleocene/Eocene Wilcox Group on the Louisiana side and is concentrated in the Eocene
6

Sparta Sands on the Texas side of the reservoir (BEG Staff 1996, USGS 2010). This
concentration of faults is more extensive in Louisiana where the cluster extends north into the
Wilcox formation to the north and is bordered east of the reservoir by the Red River and west
of the reservoir by Sandy Creek and Ayish Bayou (Barnes 1993, BEG Staff 1996). The
southern linear part of the fault cluster marks the Angelina-Caldwell Flexure at the southern
extent of the Sabine uplift. The Sabine uplift is centered in Texas west of the reservoir but
extends across the border into Louisiana. The uplift area is about 129 kilometers (80 miles) in
diameter and includes the northern-most portion of the reservoir. Exposed Paleocene and
Eocene sedimentary rock are associated with this uplift (Harris and Veatch 1907, Andersen
1960; Jackson and Laubach 1991).
The uplift of these deposits is thought to be the result of folding caused by regional tectonic
compression during the Mesozoic to Cenozoic eras (Laubach and Jackson 1990, Jackson and
Laubach 1991). South of the Sabine Arch, the Angelina-Caldwell Flexure forms a hinge that
crosses the reservoir approximately 24 to 32 kilometers (15 to 20 miles) north of the dam.
South of the hinge line the underlying strata dips increase from 14 meters per kilometer (45
feet per mile) to over 91 meters per kilometer (300 feet per mile) (Andersen 1960). Toledo
Bend Dam location coincides with the location of the Kisatchie Escarpment (Authorities
2008). Formed by the relatively resistant strata of the Eocene Jackson Group and the
Oligocene Catahoula Formation, this northward facing escarpment marks the transition from
the exposed Tertiary sedimentary deposits to Quaternary sediments (Fisher 1965).
As a result of these formations and geomorphic processes, land surfaces parallel to the
reservoir have higher relief than the coastal plain south of the dam. Coastal plain surfaces east
of the reservoir have slightly less relief than those to the west of the impounded river, this is
most evident south of the hinge. Within the APE of the Toledo Bend Project, the uplands are
comprised of Tertiary sediments, while the river and major tributary valleys are filled with
Quaternary alluvial deposits (Authorities 2008, Barnes 1993). Within the Sabine River’s
modern channel valley, remnant Pleistocene terraces and floodplains line the channel at
elevations above what was the natural floodplain of the river before the dam’s construction.
These terraces have been used as indicators of the elevation and slope of the Pleistocene-aged
river channel(s). Holocene alluvial landforms have formed below these at the base of the
valley along the pre-impoundment Sabine River channel and within the former floodplain
(Authorities 2008). These archaeologically important Pleistocene and Holocene terraces are
largely submerged. However, some terraces are exposed in the northern-most part of the
reservoir and at the mouths of larger streams (Authorities 2008). Holocene deposits are also
mapped for miles upstream of the reservoir along most tributaries. Larger drainages of the
tributaries close to the reservoir also have Holocene alluvium (Barnes 1993, USGS 2010).

2.1 Archaeologically Important Landforms
Relevant to the cultural resources investigations, important landforms in the APE generally
fall into one of 3 categories: (1) Tertiary uplands; (2) Pleistocene terraces, and (3) Holocene
alluvium. Archaeological sites are known in all 3 landforms. Tertiary uplands surround and
intrude on the reservoir, forming the majority of the reservoir bank. Pleistocene terraces are
located at the northern end of the reservoir and along the banks of stream mouths where
7
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

portions of these landforms are higher than the level of the impounded waters.
Pleistocene/Holocene Deweyville Formation surfaces south and east of the dam. Holocene
alluvium is found along all of the major drainages and many smaller ones from the reservoir
edge upstream of their mouths extending sometimes for miles. These landforms occupy the
lowest position in the landscape.
2.1.1 Tertiary Uplands
Tertiary uplands have well-drained sandy surfaces and are known for having numerous
surficial sites that often contain palimpsests of artifacts. Elevation ranges from about 100
meters (300 feet) amsl to the level of the lake at roughly 53.3 meters (175 feet) amsl. Rolling,
sandy hills and valleys are dissected by many small streams. Sandy and loamy soils support
forests of oak, pine, hickory, and sweetgum. Soils are Utisols and Alphisols and typically have
sandy or loamy surfaces. These uplands can be further divided into a northern and southern
region (Griffith et al. 2008). The northern region coincides with the underlying Wilcox group
and is distinguished by darker soil surfaces and more pasture, oak-pine and oak-hickory
forests. However, many areas have been planted with loblolly pine for timber production.
American beech or magnolia-beech-loblolly pine forests occur in more mesic areas of the
southern region. Catahoula sandstone outcrops associated with prominent open barrens or
glades are found in the southern region (Griffith et al. 2008).
Modern alterations to the landscape of the Tertiary uplands are primarily the result of
unexceptional erosional processes that have likely been operating since the Paleoindian
Period. Sandy ridges are stable to erosional due to deep overlying sands but colluvial
deposition occurs in saddles, on relatively gentle slopes off of the summit, and at the
intersection of the slope and Pleistocene terraces (Nail and Gunn 1982, Gunn and Brown
1982). Streams at higher elevations are primarily erosional; however, larger streams draining
the uplands may develop stratified alluvial deposits along its margins (Gunn and Brown 1982).
The Eocene Catahoula Formation is a source of Native American utilized lithic materials
including opal cemented sandstone and silicified wood (Barnes 1993). Black chert gravels can
be found in the Carahan Bayou Member, Blounts Creek Member, and Williamson Creek
Member.
2.1.2 Pleistocene Terraces
Pleistocene terraces in the APE are a direct result of interstadial and interglacial periods, and
the ultimate melting of the glaciers that covered the northern part of the continent. This release
of massive amounts of water created large, sediment-laden rivers that constructed terraces
along stream channels moving these waters south and expanded the continental shelf. During
the melting of the ice at the end of the last glaciation (approximately 14,000 to 18,000 years
ago), floodplains were about 12 to 18 meters higher (40 to 60 feet) in elevation than the
modern level before the dam was constructed. As the flow decreased, river channels
abandoned the larger loops creating oxbows with fluviatile Pleistocene terraces made of
gravel, sand, and silt. Larger rivers, like the Sabine, continued to flow within the floodplain
but a lower level with a lower sediment load resulting in smaller loops and channel braiding
cutting through some terraces, stranding others above the floodplain, and leaving the wider
loops with their terraces and levees to hold smaller streams and oxbows.

CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

These level terraces and terrace remnants can be found in the northern end of the reservoir and
at the mouths of streams on the Texas side and almost continuously along the Louisiana shore
and major tributaries (USGS La, BEG). These terraces occupy a higher position in the
landscape than the later Holocene alluvium. Locally, eolian deposits may drape the terraces as
in the case of Sawtown series soils (soils of Toledo Bend USDA). Colluvial sediments are
commonly deposited along the valley wall transition by slope wash. This colluvial
environment buried the Paleo-Indian component of the Eagle Hill Site in western Louisiana.
Typically, these terraces slopes rise from the reservoir edge at various angles, however, some
have been cut into by wave erosion and have left vertical banks up to 9 meters (30 feet) thick
(Authorities 2008).
Deweyville formation terraces in the APE are located between Pleistocene fluviatile terraces
and Holocene alluvium. This position in the landscape suggests a late Pleistocene to early
Holocene date for the deposits. These deposits are found south and east of the dam but are
presumably present but submerged in other parts of the APE.
2.1.3 Holocene Alluvium
Holocene alluvium aggraded along the same channels cut by the glacial waters after the flow
of meltwater ended. These deposits occupy the lowest position of the landscape and take form
as point bars, natural levees, stream channels, backswamps, and indistinct terraces (BEG
1993). Most of these deposits are within the active floodplain and subject to periodic flooding.
Within the APE, the vast majority of the Holocene floodplain of the Sabine is inundated.
During a low lake level episode in 2006, surveyors found the majority of sites in the exposed
floodplain were on levees of abandoned meanders. Within the APE, Holocene alluvium is
exposed at the northern end along the Sabine River channel and along most tributaries
upstream from their mouth on the reservoir. Levees and overbank deposits are possible along
the channels of large tributaries.

2.2 Soils
Many series of soils are represented in the Toledo Bend Reservoir area due to the variety of
topographic settings and underlying geological formations. As discussed above, 3 broad
categories of landforms represent the archaeological potential of the APE: (1) Tertiary
uplands; (2) Pleistocene terraces, and (3) Holocene alluvium. Archaeological sites have been
found in each of these settings. Soils formed in each setting have potential for surficial cultural
deposits and under specific circumstances buried cultural deposits.
Soils in the uplands are primarily residual and are derived from tertiary formations. However,
colluvium resulting from sheetwash is found on moderate slopes and saddles off the summit of
hills (Gunn an Brown 1982). Soils on slopes and interfluve summits are primarily sandy loams
underlain by clay and clay loams. These are generally formed in clayey to loamy residuum.
According to the United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) National Resources
Conservation Service (NRCS) and Soil Survey Staff (SSS), common soils types in this setting
include Eastwood, Sacul, Kirvin, and Tenaha. In the southern part of the reservoir Kisatche
and Tehran formed on uplands slopes. Kisatche forms on steeper slopes and has relatively thin
9

A and E horizons. Tehran series have a similarly thin A horizon but typically have 3 E
horizons totaling over a meter (45 inches) thick (USDA SSS 2010, SSS NRCS USDA 2010).
These soils support dense vegetation that slows slope erosion, but disturbed areas and steeper
slopes can erode quickly (Authorities 2008, USDA SSS 2010)
Soils on Pleistocene terraces have thick, primarily silty and sandy loam, A horizons and clayey
subsoils. Soils are well-developed in this long stable surface formed by glacial meltwater in
the Pleistocene. Prominent argillic B horizons are recognizable features of the soils. Overlying
post-glacial sediments can be found on these terraces in areas underlain by Wilcox formation.
Sawville soils are formed in loamy mounded eolian sediments. Eolian deposits in the APE are
underlain by plastic clays (USDA SSS 2010). Another result of the thick, sandy, stable surface
is the cumulative effects of bioturbation. Bioturbation in the sandy soils of the Pleistocene
terraces frequently results in the downward movement of artifacts that collect on the denser
clay horizon surface. Younger overlying colluvium and eolian deposits develop similar soils
but typically lack the argillic horizon. Soils commonly found on Pleistocene terraces include
Latonia, Metcalf, Niwana, and Timpson. These soil types are sandy and subject to erosion on
steeper slopes and along shorelines (USDA SSS 2010, SSS NRCS USDA 2010).
Soils formed in Holocene alluvium are primarily silty and sandy loam soils with some silty or
sandy clay loam soils. Soils forming on these floodplains are subject to flooding. Many soils
form just above the water table. Some dominant soils series such as Guyton and Dreka are
hydric. Iuka soils form in stratified alluvium and with Mantachie series soils form on natural
levee formations along the Sabine (Authorities 2008).

2.3 Lithic Resources
Lithic resources in the APE include Opaline-cemented siltstone and sandstone from the
Catahoula Formation, siliceous pebbles from Pliocene and Pleistocene Formations, and
silicified wood formed in Miocene deposits (Jolly 1982, Heinrich 1984). Miocene formations
are found along the southern-most shoreline on the Louisiana side and just south of the APE
on the Texas side.

2.4 Other Geologic Notes
Erosion is most likely at locations where the Sabine River channel is close to the Toledo Bend
Reservoir shoreline and reservoir depths of 30 meters (100 feet) are adjacent to bluff banks of
12 to 15 meters (40 to 50 feet) (Taylor 1998). During the spring and summer of 1964 when the
Toledo Bend Dam was under construction, a series of earthquakes measuring 2.6 to 4.4 on the
Richter Scale co-occurred with the filling of the Sam Rayburn Reservoir west of the APE. The
quakes were confined to the shallow subsurface and the last of these occurred in August 1964
(Stevenson and McCulloh 2001).

3.0 CULTURE HISTORY
Archaeologists within the southeast region of the United States, and more specifically in Texas
and Louisiana in vicinity of the Project, agree on the general framework of cultural time
periods, while disagreeing on the temporal boundaries of these periods based on evidence
supported by the archaeological record. Despite these differences, the chronologies developed
by researchers are based primarily on changes in projectile point technologies within the
region and the introduction of pottery. It is generally recognized that a broad-based hunting
and gathering lifestyle was utilized throughout all time periods in Texas and Louisiana.

3.1 Paleo-Indian Period (circa 12,000 to 8,000 years before present [ybp])
In northeast Texas and northwest Louisiana, the Paleo-Indian Period is primarily represented
by surficial, mixed or isolated finds of diagnostic projectile points. Temporal information
concerning these finds is often derived from comparisons with well-dated and stratified sites
to the east and west of the region. Among the most substantial Paleo-Indian sites within the
northeast region of Texas is the Forrest Murphey Site (41MR62) located near Big Cypress
Creek. The Forrest Murphey Site produced several discrete concentrations of stone tools,
lanceolate points, and diagnostic artifacts including Clovis, Plainview, and Dalton projectile
points, some of which were found in apparent association with extinct elephant bones, a true
rarity (Story 1990). The other substantial Paleo-Indian site from the northeast region of Texas
is the Delta Bone Quarry 5 Site (41DT86), which contained an antler tool and fire hearth.
Carbon dated charcoal from the hearth indicates the site is contemporaneous with Clovis,
Folsom, and Dalton complexes within the region (Perttula 1989).
In northwest Louisiana, one of the earliest surveys, located on Avery Island, on 1 of 5 salt
domes on the coastal zone, provides dates of 10,900 ybp and 11,950 ybp. From this and other
sites, such as the John Pearce (16CD56) and Whatley (16LA37) sites, which are both small,
seasonally occupied campsites, remains have been identified that help in the reconstruction of
Paleo-Indian lifeways (Smith et al. 1983). The few functional artifact types that are associated
with this tool kit were used primarily for killing and butchering purposes. Over time, the
components of this tool kit evolved into those associated with the succeeding Archaic Period;
this evolution was slow and gradual, marked by a diversity of tool forms. In addition to the
classic concave Dalton and San Patrice forms, a variety of side- and corner-notched forms
gradually appeared. Paleo-Indian sites tend to reflect small, temporary occupations yielding
few artifacts (Smith et al. 1983). A typical example of this type of site is found relatively near
the Project area; Site 16DS353 is located on a ridge top near Gandy Bayou and yielded
scattered lithic debitage, scrapers, and several San Patrice points (Girard 2000).
Paleo-Indian occupations are principally located in valleys of major stream basins and
resource rich areas. Generally, Paleo-Indian adaptation within the region was limited to the
use of small encampments and a generalized tool kit (Anderson 1996; Thurmond 1990a). One
model suggests that the earliest Paleo-Indian occupation of the southeastern U.S. occurred in
the resource rich Mississippi River Basin and spread throughout the wooded areas with
occupations/sites separated by 250 to 400 kilometers (155 to 249 miles). The widely scattered
11
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

distribution of sites across diverse landform types and within different settings suggests that
Paleo-Indian groups were very mobile hunter-gatherers rather than megafauna specialists
(Anderson 1996).

3.2 Archaic Period (ca. 8,000 to 2,200 ybp)
In the Northeastern Texas Archaeological Region (Perttula 2004) and within the Management
Unit I of Louisiana (Smith et al. 1983), the Archaic Period is divided into three sub-periods:
Early Archaic, Middle Archaic, and Late Archaic. The division of the period into sub-periods
emphasizes the underlying common characteristics of the period while also recognizing
change over time. Archaic Period groups were largely aceramic hunter-gatherers who ranged
over a variety of environmental settings. The archaeological record reveals an increase over
time in reliance on native plant species, expedient lithic technologies, and long term or
repeated use of site loci. There also appears to have been a population increase and a
concomitant emergence of territorialism between groups. Ceramics make their first
appearance in the prehistory of the region at the end of the Archaic Period. The sub-periods
are defined in part by projectile point sequences established by Johnson (1962), Story (1990),
and Thurmond (1990b). Straight and expanding stem forms are representative of the Early and
Middle Archaic, while contracting stem forms are diagnostic of the Late Archaic.
The first 4,000 years (ca. 8,000 to 4,000 ybp) of the Archaic Period was much drier than today
according to recent paleoenvironmental data (Ferring 1995). Prairies comprised a greater
proportion of the habitat in the region, although the xeric conditions did not preclude human
occupations. During the Early Archaic (ca. 8,000 to 6,000 ybp), groups were highly mobile
and subsisted on a variety of food species, concentrating on deer and aquatic species, as well
as hickory nuts and acorns. Sites often reflect a pattern of repeated occupations by small
foraging groups utilizing an expedient lithic technology. Sites are found along major
drainages as well as in the interior uplands (Anderson 1996).
During the Middle Archaic (ca. 6,000 to 4,000 ybp) occupations became more substantial and
extensive within the major river basins of the region. Less intensively used sites are also
located on minor tributaries and headwaters. “Open camps” are a typical site type with lithic
assemblages comprised of projectile points, generalized cutting and scraping tools, cores and
debitage. Tools were primarily made of locally available lithic material; however, there is
evidence for a limited exchange of finished tools made of non-local material (Fields and
Tomka 1993; Perttula 1984). In the case of sites at Lake Cooper, the non-local raw material
originated in the Red River Basin to the north (Fields et al. 1997). Increased utilization of
plant material is generally associated with the presence of groundstone artifacts and burned
rock features. The burned rock features probably represent hearths, ovens, or cooking pits.
By the Late Archaic (ca. 4,000 to 2,200 ybp) prehistoric groups were exploiting nearly all the
region’s varied environmental settings. Late Archaic sites are found along major streams, near
springs, on spring-fed branches, on upland ridges and on tributary drainages of all sizes (Cliff
and Hunt 1995; Cliff et al. 1996; Dixon et al. 1997; Thurmond 1990b). Settlement data
suggest widely dispersed camps and foraging areas, higher population densities, more limited
group mobility, and the possible establishment of territorial ranges (Perttula 2004). Late
12
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

Archaic people still followed a generalized foraging subsistence strategy; however, the
presence of extensive burned rock features, pits, and hearths at many sites indicates an
increased emphasis on the cooking and bulk processing of plant species. The intensive use of
some sites along major drainages is further evidenced by the presence of earthen middens
(Cliff et al. 1996). Unlike other areas of North America during this period, there is no
evidence for the cultivation of native plant species by prehistoric groups during the Late
Archaic (Fritz 1994). The argument for relatively limited inter-regional interaction between
groups is based in part on the paucity of non-local lithic material (Fields and Tomka 1993;
Perttula and Bruseth 1995). By contrast, contemporary assemblages from sites in the
neighboring Mississippi River Basin abound with non-local lithic raw materials (Saunders and
Allen 1997).

3.3 Woodland/Ceramic Period (ca. 2,200 to 1,200 ybp) in Northeast Texas
In general, people of the Woodland Period, also identified in other regions as the Ceramic
Period (Pertulla 2004), were hunter-gatherers who followed a seasonal foraging strategy but
lived in increasingly larger groups and resided for longer periods of time at certain sites.
Discussed in detail below, the most distinguishing characteristic of the Woodland/Ceramic
Period from the Archaic Period is the appearance of ceramics in northeast Texas.
Use and occupation of the region was variable and site types range from limited-use camps to
moderately sized settlements (Perttula 2004). For example, sites along the Red River range in
size from 1 to 4 hectares (2.5 to 9.9 acres) (Schambach 1983). The presence of middens,
structural remains, and burials provide evidence for increasing sedentism, although not to the
scale of later Caddo occupiers.
One reason for the increase in sedentism may be the adoption of limited horticulture and the
desire to be close to a certain plant food during a particular season (Corbin 1998). The
Woodland diet included a variety of wild terrestrial and aquatic animal species, nuts, native
seeds, as well as cultivated squash (McGregor 1996). Furthermore, chipped stone axes and
hoe-shaped tools suggest horticulture-related activities including colonizing weedy annuals
and clearing forests. During this period, maize was not a significant food source (Rose et al.
1998).
The use of ceramics within the region is variable, with some sites (particularly along the Red
River) yielding copious numbers of ceramic artifacts while others (notably between the
Sulphur and Sabine Rivers) producing far less. Because ceramics are associated with boiled
foods (particularly those rich in carbohydrates) and increased sedentism, archaeologists have
suggested that sites with high numbers of ceramic artifacts reflect different dietary habits and
settlement practices than sites with few ceramics (Perttula 2004; Skibo and Blinman 1999).
Ceramic types tend to be of the Lower Mississippi Valley type and include Tchefuncte
Stamped, Churupa Punctated, Marksville Incised, Marksville Stamped, and Troyville
Stamped. Ceramics may have been traded, or local potters may have adopted these styles from
neighboring groups (Perttula and Bruseth 1995; Schambach 1982).
In addition to the introduction of ceramics, the advent of the bow and arrow was a major
13
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

technological development during the Woodland Period (Turner and Hester 1993; Newcomb
1961). The diagnostic points of this period are Catahoula, Friley, Alba, and Bonham (Turner
and Hester 1993).
Mortuary practices from the Woodland Period provide more evidence for sedentism within the
Woodland Period. While Woodland mounds are present in nearby areas of Arkansas and
Louisiana, no Woodland Period burial mounds have been documented in the immediate
region. The Hurricane Hill Site along the Sulphur River has yielded flexed, bundle, and
cremation burials in a small burial ground (Perttula 1999). At the Snipes Site (41CP8), shallow
extended burials included whole vessels, boatstones, celts, and bifaces used as funerary
objects (Schambach 1982). Burial practices at the Hurricane Hill Site and the Johnny Ford Site
across the Red River in Arkansas are comparable to one another, suggesting shared belief
systems among Woodland Period groups (Perttula 2004). Furthermore, Perttula (2004)
maintains that formally bounded cemeteries at Woodland sites suggest the presence of
distinctive social groups based on kinship or residence.

3.4 Late Prehistoric Period (ca. 1,200 to 250 ybp) in Southeast Texas
In southeast Texas including Newton and Sabine counties, the Late Prehistoric Period marks
the transition out of the Archaic Period with the introduction of ceramics into the assemblage
(Aten 1983), moving first into the coastal region and eventually disseminating inland (Ricklis
2004). Like the Woodland Period identified in northeast Texas, no major shifts in lifestyle are
evident during this period (Ricklis 2004) although there were major technological changes,
such as sandy paste ceramics and, around 700 A.D. in the Late Prehistoric Period, the bow and
arrow (Story 1990; Ricklis 2004).
The Late Prehistoric Period is loosely defined by two schools of thought surrounding the
dissemination of pottery. Some postulate that ceramics diffused from the east and kept some
of the same stylistic attributes from pre-Mississippian Period in Louisiana (Shafer 1975 and
Aten 1984). Alternatively, Story (1990) postulates the presence of a unique ceramic
assemblage called the Mossy Grove Tradition, which is made up of homogenous, sandypasted, sometimes incised vessels that are distinct from Woodland Period ceramics in the
northeast. Perttula (2004) recognizes a correlation between the distribution of Mossy Grove
ceramics and the known Attakapan-speaking linguistic groups.
Similar to those diagnostic of the Woodland Period in northeast Texas, identifying projectile
points associated with the Late Prehistoric Period in southeast Texas are light, small, straight,
and expanded stem types that include the Delhi, Ellis, Epps, Gary, Kent, Alba, Catahoula,
Cliffton, Fresno, Friley, Hayes, Perdiz, Scallorn, and Steiner points (Story 1990; Turner and
Hester 1993; Ricklis 2004).

3.5 Distinctive Prehistoric Periods in Louisiana
Texas archaeology remains broad-themed and groups a range of cultural populations into the
generalized Woodland and Late Prehistoric Periods, described above. The same temporal
period that defines the Woodland Period in Texas may be referred to as the Woodland Stage in
14
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

Louisiana, which has been subdivided into narrow temporal periods named for several notable
“type” sites (Neuman 1984). Newer, smaller sites are classified into these periods based on
descriptions of materials recovered from the type sites (Neuman 1984). Within the general
Project area, periods of the Woodland Stage include the Marksville Period and TroyvilleColes Creek Period. These are discussed in the following sections.
3.5.1 Marksville Period (A.D. 100 to 400)
The Marksville Period was named for the Marksville Site (16AV1) in Avoyelles Parish,
Louisiana. The Marksville Period is thought to reflect northern Hopewell culture. The parallels
between Louisiana Marksville and Hopewellian culture are seen most prominently in burial
practices (Toth 1988). Burials, particularly those of the early Marksville period, show
elaborate mortuary ceremonialism. This includes conical burial mounds with high-status
artifacts. The presence and form of these artifacts are the primary indicators of contact with
Illinois Hopewell cultures. Later Marksville sites are simply villages without mounds.
However, since early and late Marksville sites are often sequentially occupied it can be
difficult to differentiate between them (Smith et al. 1983).
Marksville Period sites are generally located around natural levees and lower river terraces.
Subsistence practices during this time changed little from those of earlier periods, retaining an
emphasis on hunting, gathering, and fishing. Shell middens are present during this period and
their large size indicates a relatively sedentary settlement pattern or frequent reoccupation.
Sites of this period are often located near rivers or floodplain lakes and on higher ground. Site
size ranges from large ceremonial centers to small hamlets and coastal middens. Smaller sites
are recognized as Marksville through material remains such as distinctive pottery designs and
exotic raw materials, rather than through structural remains.
Hopewellian influences are also seen in Marksville ceramics. Hopewellian ceramic decorative
influences include cross-hatching, “u”-shaped incised lines, zoned, dentate, rocker stamping,
and cord-wrapped stick impressions. Hopewellian motifs include the stylized bird and the
bisected circle. Early Marksville ceramics demonstrate a strong Hopewellian influence, though
not a total adaptation of Hopewell cultural traits. At the end of the Marksville Period, there is a
decreasing Hopewellian influence, as demonstrated by the ceramic decorative styles (Smith et
al. 1983).
Ceramics associated with this period are characterized by stylized decorative treatments such
as parallel line-incising, fingernail punctations and zoned dentate rocker stamping, animal
effigy incising, and bisected circles (Toth 1988). Other cultural material includes copper
artifacts, galena artifacts, pearl beads, and carved stone. As some of these materials are nonnative, this indicates that trade networks were still in use at this time. While the day-to-day use
materials were local, the more exotic trade goods were more likely to be associated with burial
mounds (Toth 1988). Examples of utilitarian materials include celts, drills, atlatal weights and
plummets, bone fishhooks, bone awls, and baked clay balls. The dominant projectile point
type is the Gary point.
Medium- and large-stemmed projectile points are prevalent in the archaeological record, and
the Gary type is still the most common. The atlatl was still widely used, and chipped celts and
15

drills make an appearance during this period. During the early part of the Marksville Period, a
blade and core industry was prevalent. Another significant characteristic of Marksville is the
use of imported copper products and exotic lithic raw materials such as mica and greenstone.
Both of the latter artifact types reflect additional manifestations of the Hopewellian influence.
3.5.2 Troyville-Coles Creek Period (A.D. 400 to 1250)
De Soto Parish is located within the Troyville-Coles Creek culture concentration area and a
handful of the sites located within the parish are of the Troyville-Coles period (Smith et al.
1983:185). Although the Troyville and Coles Creek cultures are generally grouped together,
the former is more accurately described as a transitional culture that gave rise to the Coles
Creek culture. Troyville began ca. A.D. 400 and the rather gradual transition to Coles Creek
occurred ca. A.D. 700; the latter persisted until A.D. 1250.
The Troyville transitional period saw 2 technological advancements: the incorporation of
maize agriculture and the adoption of the bow and arrow. Evidence for maize agriculture is
inferred from secondary evidence. For example, an increase in the size and shape of pottery
indicates the storage of grains and seeds. The presence of shell hoes and grinding stones
suggest cultivation and processing. The introduction of the bow and arrow is indicated by the
presence of small arrow points, such as the Scallorn and Alba types.
Troyville period ceramics reflect influences from 2 areas. From the central Mississippi area to
the north, plain pottery is introduced. Decoration is rare and consists of cord marking and red
filming. From the Florida Gulf Coast area to the east, a simplified, zoned, rocker-stamped
decoration and diverse use of incised lines are introduced. Curvilinear motifs also are
introduced from this area.
The Coles Creek culture (A.D. 700 to 1100) is better known than the earlier Troyville culture.
Pottery dating to this period is of a higher quality and employs a wider range of decorative
motifs. The most diagnostic surface treatment of Coles Creek pottery is a series of incised
lines placed below the rim of the vessel with a row of triangular impressions beneath these
lines. This decoration style is known as Coles Creek Incised. Other pottery types that
demonstrate intra-regional influences include French Fork Incised, which reflect
characteristics of Weeden Island (Florida) ceramics, and Pontchartrain Check Stamped, which
reflect characteristics of pottery from eastern Georgia (i.e., Deptford, Irene). Saunders and
Stoltman (1999) recently examined complicated stamped pottery from multiple sites in
Louisiana (including 16SM5) to determine whether this pottery type was locally made or
imported from outside the region. Using petrographic analyses of thin sections from both
complicated stamped vessels and vessels known to have been made locally (that were not
complicated stamped) these researchers found no evidence that complicated stamped vessels
were imported into the region. This finding led the authors to suggest a new type name,
Gainesville, for complicated stamped vessels in southern Louisiana (Saunders and Stoltman
1999:21).
The subsistence strategy employed during this period was a combination of hunting and
gathering and maize horticulture. The addition of maize horticulture resulted in a changing
settlement pattern. Natural levees, old cutoffs, and inactive river channels became preferred
16

site locations. Such locations allowed prime access to both fertile soil for maize horticulture
and a diverse biomass for efficient hunting and gathering.
Coles Creek sites contain mounds, though they are no longer conical as they were during
previous periods. Coles Creek mounds are flat-topped, truncated, pyramidal mounds that were
used not only for burial purposes, but also appear to have been the locations of structures or
residences. This dual function suggests that the mounds became important ceremonial
locations. Generally, Coles Creek sites contain 3 mounds located on 3 sides of an open plaza.
Lesser sites include small villages and seasonally occupied camps.
Overall, Coles Creek is viewed as a time of expansion, as exemplified by an increased
quantity and distribution of sites. Material remains indicate an increasing reliance on maize
agriculture, supplemented by hunting and gathering. This subsistence style is indicated by
increased settlement on the coast, and the widespread use of the bow and arrow. Finally, the
appearance of temple mounds suggests that a stable economic base was in place, and that it
may have fueled an emerging religious elite.

3.6 Caddo Culture (A.D. 800 to 1600)
The most notable prehistoric cultural tradition in both northeast Texas and northwest
Louisiana was the Caddo Culture that spanned across the Sabine River within the Project
APE. The Caddo Culture in Texas and Louisiana, which represents its southwestern most
expression, was part of a larger culture area that spanned east Texas and parts of Arkansas,
Louisiana, Missouri, and Oklahoma. More is known about the Caddo Culture than any of the
previous prehistoric periods largely because their story includes prehistory, history and
ethnography. Archaeologists have used historical accounts by Europeans to augment their
understanding of the archaeological record. After contact with Europeans, the Caddo remained
in northeast Texas and northwest Louisiana, much reduced in numbers, until they either
migrated or were removed (1854) to Oklahoma, where they reconstituted as a now federally
recognized tribe.
Due to the overwhelming diversity of the Caddo Culture, stylistic changes in ceramics, and
geographical dispersion of the Caddo, there is no single accepted framework to organize
Caddo chronology. The commonly used Caddo I-V system as proposed by Davis (1970) is
rejected by Perttula “…as it is fraught with problems and unwarranted assumptions…”
(1992a:58). The scheme used in this report follows Story (1990) because it provides a
generalized overview of Caddo prehistory and early documented history. However, Perttula
(1992a) notes that there are other, more familiar schemes (i.e., Schambach 1983, Rogers 1995,
and Early 1993) that pay specific attention to regional characteristics.
Story’s scheme was chosen here as it makes use of a similar structure that is referenced in the
preceding temporal periods. Story’s (1990) scheme includes 5 major periods: Formative,
Early, Middle, Late, and Historic. The Late Caddo Period is further subdivided into 5 phases
within Texas including Angelina, Frankston, McCurtain, Texarkana/Belcher, and Titus.

3.6.1 Formative (A.D. 800 to 1000), Early (A.D. 1000 to 1200), and Middle (A.D. 1200 to
1400) Caddo Periods
Sites of the Formative, Early, and Middle Caddo Periods are found primarily on elevated
landforms (alluvial terraces and rises, natural levees, and upland edges) adjacent to streams,
minor tributaries, and spring-fed branches. There was a preference for sandy loam soils,
perhaps for the good quality of drainage and fertility. All habitats within the region were
utilized, either intensively via sedentary communities or farmsteads, or periodically through
logistical camps for short-term resource exploitation. The economy, which was a mix of
hunting, foraging and agriculture, supported a complex, hierarchical socioeconomic system
symbolically centered on mound structures (Perttula 2004).
The settlement pattern involved a variety of site types ranging in size, intensity, and
occupational duration. The smallest sites were periodically used for limited resource
exploitation. Medium size sites included agricultural hamlets and farmsteads occupied by one
or more families on a seasonal or permanent basis. The largest sites were permanently
occupied villages associated with mounds or mound complexes (Bruseth 1998; Bruseth and
Perttula 1981; Cliff 1997; Cliff et al. 1996; Cruse 1994, 1995; Largent et al. 1997;
Middlebrook 1994, 1997; Perttula et al. 1986; Thurmond 1990b). The George C. Davis Site is
perhaps the most thoroughly understood site of this type in Texas. The site was occupied from
ca. A.D. 800 to 1350 and consisted of a village with 3 mounds. Mounds A and B were flattopped platform mounds while Mound C was a burial mound that contained 25 to 30 elite
ranking burials (Story 1997, 1998, 2000). The Oak Hill Village Site (41RK214) is a nonmound site with 42 circular to rectangular post structures arranged around a central plaza.
There were also extensive middens, a possible granary and 2 large circular structures that may
have served as public structures (Cruse 1994, 1995; Rogers et al. 1994; Rogers and Perttula
1999).
The subsistence strategy utilized during these periods was a mix of hunting, foraging, and
agriculture. Hunting and gathering activities focused on fish, deer and other animal species as
well as the collection of nuts and tubers. Cultivated foods included native seed, maize, and
squash (Perttula and Bruseth 1983). However, maize does not appear to have been cultivated
prior to ca. A.D. 1300, although by ca. A.D. 1450 it constituted more than 50% of the diet in
some areas (Burnett 1990; Perttula 1996; Rose et al. 1998). The presence of granaries at some
sites indicates that surpluses were common. Burnett (1990) suggests that in the rural Caddo
communities south of the Red River, maize was not a dietary staple, as is evidenced by a low
frequency of dental caries and porotic hyperostosis, poor health conditions often associated
with dependence on maize and other starchy foods.
Regular food surpluses catalyzed the development of a rich material culture, helped divert
labor efforts to the construction of mounds, and support a rank of social elites. The material
culture of Formative, Early, and Middle Caddo groups included well made corner-notched and
rectangular-stemmed arrow points, siltstone and greenstone celts, perforators and borers,
Gahagan bifaces, ceramic earspools, ceramic figurines, and long-stemmed Red River and
cigar-shaped ceramic pipes (Hofman 1967; Newell and Krieger 1949). Mortuary practices
reflect both the wealth of material culture and hint at a hierarchy of social statuses. The burial
of a single child, perhaps 3 to 4 years old, contained a wealth of grave offerings including 8
18

ceramic vessels, 2 paired deer antlers, carved shell inlays, 2 carved bone earspools, 32 olivella
shell beads, 3 columella beads, a turtle rattle, a cache of mussel shell, polished stones, 2 pitted
stones, a cache of six deer ulna awls, 2 beaver teeth, and a cache of lithic pebble cores, flaked
preforms and a notched shell projectile point (Middlebrook 1994).
The mounds and mound complexes are manifestations of an extensive, integrated
socioeconomic system. Both temple (flat-topped platform) mounds and burial mounds were
built. The larger sites with multiple mounds and attendant villages served as important civic
and/or ceremonial loci. These sites emerged after ca. A.D. 900 and are more or less evenly
spaced along the Red River, Sabine River and Big Cypress Bayou. Thurmond (1990a)
suggests that this distribution indicates a regional system of interaction and redistribution.
3.6.2 Late Caddo Period (A.D. 1400 to 1600)
The Late Caddo Period is characterized by a sedentary, agriculturally-based complex society
led by social elites who lived at mound centers. In the Late Caddo Period, the larger Caddo
Culture area (covering parts of Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Texas) is
subdivided into 10 phases.
Within the Piney Woods, the manifestation of the Late Caddo Period has been characterized as
part of a rural Caddo community system (Perttula 1992a). Settlements tend to be along
secondary drainages and are widely dispersed hamlets and farmsteads. The rural community
system was part of a hierarchy of interrelated site types. At the base of the hierarchy were the
short-term camps used for resource exploitation and the dispersed hamlets and farmsteads.
Next in the hierarchy were larger “towns” of linear but dispersed compounds with specialized
structures such as brush covered shelters and storage platforms. At the top of the hierarchy
were civic-ceremonial centers with platform and/or burial mounds (Schambach 1983).
Mound centers tend to be concentrated along major drainages. Mound centers are typically
located on the floodplain floor of a major drainage or on an upland projection. Occupations
associated with the mound centers are not found on the floodplain floor, but rather are located
on rises within the floodplain, terrace, or upland projections (Perttula 2004). There are 3 types
of Late Caddo Period mounds: temple mounds, burial mounds, and fire mounds (Kelley 1998;
Webb 1959). Mound centers served civic-ceremonial functions and were presided over by
resident social elites. In part, evidence for social ranking comes from burials. High status
burials consisted of large shaft tombs with multiple internments, a high percentage of grave
offerings with a great number of arrow points and ceramic vessels, and the inclusion of
specialty grave offerings such as large Galt-style bifaces. Only males were interred in these
burials (Perttula 2004).
Late Caddo Period people buried their dead in a variety of ways. Children in particular were
interred beneath house floors (Perttula 2004), and small family cemeteries were maintained at
hamlets, farmsteads, and in the larger settlements. In addition, formally maintained,
community or supralocal cemeteries are extant, with little incidence of burials intruding one
upon another. This suggests that the cemeteries were planned and periodically expanded
(Perttula 1992b). Family cemeteries contain single, extended interments with graves placed in
rows. Graves have a roughly east-west orientation. Grave offerings differ by age and by sex.

The fewest number of offerings were included in children’s burials while the greatest numbers
were buried with adults. Males tended to be buried with clusters of arrow points, while
females were buried with polishing stones or ceramic vessels (Thurmond 1990b). Community
cemeteries contained individuals from nearby communities. They typically contain 60 to 70
individuals, but some have as many as 150 to 300 individuals (Perttula 1992a; Perttula and
Nelson 1998, 1999; Story 1990; Turner 1978). At the Tuck Carpenter (41CP5) site dating
from A.D. 1350 to 1550 and the H.R. Taylor site (41HS3) researchers have found evidence for
the segregation of graves based on status (Perttula 1992a, Turner 1978).
The material culture of the Late Caddo Period is rich, particularly in decorated ceramics and
adorned luxury items. Ceramics from previous periods were heavily influenced by Lower
Mississippi Valley traditions. It was not until ca. A.D. 700 to 900 that Caddo ceramics
dominated the assemblages of northeastern Texas. Even so, Lower Mississippi Valley styles
remained highly influential (Story 1990). There was a plethora of vessel types including
bowls, bottles, and jars with a wide variety of shapes, sizes and embellishment. Caddo pottery
makers produced both utility wares and fine wares. Ceramics appear to have had an
importance in Caddo life for cooking and serving food and drink, for storing foodstuffs, as
personal possessions, and as exemplars of beauty and craftsmanship. Furthermore, Caddo
ceramics served as status markers for subgroups within the society (David et al. 1988;
Thurmond 1985).
A variety of artifacts have been recovered from Late Caddo Period sites. Earspools were made
of ceramics, slate, and in one case, they were plated with copper. Elbow and biconical pipes
were decorated with incised lines painted with hematite or kaolin clay (Jackson 1933; Turner
1992). Lithic tools and debris are most conspicuous because of their relative scarcity. This
probably reflects a shift to utilization of bone and wood for tool manufacture. Chipped stone
tools include triangular and corner-notched arrow points, flake tools, drills, and scrapers.
Groundstone implements include petaloid and tabular celts, manos and metates, abrading
slabs, and battered and polished cobbles and pebbles (Thurmond 1990a; Turner 1992). Bone
tools include beamers, punches, awls, pins and rattles for turtle carapaces. Exotic materials
such as lithic raw materials and Gulf Coast shells suggest that trade existed between the Caddo
rural communities and the larger population centers. In addition, people of the Caddo Cultural
area maintained trade links with horticulturalists in the southwestern U.S., as well as the
Southern Plains and the Lower Mississippi Valley (Baugh 1998; Kidder 1998).
3.6.3 Historic Caddo Period (1543 to 1835)
Spanish explorers first encountered the rural Caddo communities of northern Texas in 1543
when Luis de Moscoso led a group of men returning to Mexico following the death of De Soto
(Glover 1935). While there was a long hiatus between contacts with Europeans, Caddo
Culture was affected by the introduction of trade goods and new epidemic diseases. In 1679 a
group of Spanish soldiers were stationed at Caddo Lake, which later became the now vanished
town of Port Caddo. At the time of contact the Caddo were organized into confederacies
within the Caddo culture area. Prior to European contact, the Hasinai Caddo groups occupied
permanent settlements along the Neches and Angelina River Basins as far as the Trinity River.
They continued to live in this region until the Republic of Texas removed them in 1836.
20

Beginning in the late seventeenth century, with the intrusion by La Salle into the Hasinai
territory in the 1680s, Caddo groups in northeast Texas became caught up in the rivalry
between the Spanish to the west and the French to the east. French traders were in residence
at many of the major Caddo settlements by the mid 18th century. The Caddo found themselves
on the edges of both the “Horse Frontier” and “Gun Frontier”. Native American groups to the
west had horses, but no guns, while groups to the east had guns but no horses. For a time,
Caddo groups exploited this situation by expanding their hunting territories to the west using
both guns and horses, and at times serving as middle men to provide guns and horses to those
in need. In addition, they became involved with the European fur trade, mainly supplying
buffalo and deerskins. The Caddo also engaged in the Apache slave trade. The Caddo traded
Apache children for European goods at the French and Spanish markets at Natchitoches and
Los Adaes. Their economic stature and skill as mediators made them desirable partners for the
vying French and Spanish, which was manifested in annual gifts to the Caddo from the
European powers.
Population upheavals further altered the character of the Caddo heartland. Displacement of
northern Wichita speaking tribes to the south resulted in an alliance with the Hasinai in the
margins of the Post Oak Savanna. Caddo populations were greatly reduced by epidemics and
decimated groups merged with one another. At the same time eastern tribes (Biloxi, Alabama,
Coushatta, Choctaw and Cherokee) sought and were granted permission to resettle in the
Caddo heartland after being displace from their lands by Anglo settlers. Between 1836 and
1842, the Hasinai, Nadaco, and Cadohadacho Caddo groups were forced from east Texas.
Some moved west of the Brazos River for a short time before being forcibly relocated to the
Indian Territories (present day Oklahoma).

3.7 Historic Period (1540s to 1960s)
3.7.1 European Exploration and Early Regional State Histories
The first likely contact between Native Americans in Louisiana and European peoples was in
the 1540s as the De Soto and Moscoso Expedition traveled through the region (Smith 1983).
After De Soto’s death in 1542, Moscoso led the expedition through Caddo Indian territory in
Louisiana and Texas in an attempt to find their way back to New Spain (Weddle 2010). Early
European settlements in Louisiana were not begun in earnest until the 1700s. The first
permanent European settlement in Louisiana was present-day Natchitoches, founded by the
French in 1714. Meanwhile, Spain established Catholic missions at the frontier of its empire in
present day Texas. Though they experienced greater success in other parts of the state, most
eighteenth century Franciscan missions among the Caddo in eastern Texas were unsuccessful
and short-lived (Wright 2010).
The lands of Texas and Louisiana were colonies of various European powers over the
centuries. The Sabine River was a frontier and border area for several centuries. Spanish rule
in Texas typically dates from 1716 to 1821, though they explored the region in the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries. In 1682, explorers claimed Louisiana for France, which held it until
ceding it to Spain in 1763. Spanish rule in northwest Louisiana lasted until 1800, when it was
transferred to France once again and sold to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of
21
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

1803.
El Camino Real, also known as King’s Highway or Old San Antonio Road, was one of the
important early roads in the region. Present-day Highway 21 follows its route. El Camino Real
ran from Natchitoches, Louisiana west across the Sabine River at Gaine’s Ferry, through
Nacogdoches, Texas, and southwest to the Rio Grande. Much of the path of the road followed
trails between Native American settlements, and was used by Spanish missionaries in the late
seventeenth century as they attempted to establish missions in East Texas. Later, it would be
both an important trade route between the Republic of Texas and Mexico, and a route for
Anglo-American immigration from the east (Williams 2007).
Ferry crossings on the Sabine River often were placed at natural river crossing locations,
which had been used by Indian tribes previously. For example, Haley’s Ferry in Shelby
County, Texas was along the trail from the Hasinai and Natchitoches confederacies of the
Caddo Nation. European settlements throughout northwestern Louisiana increased after the
Louisiana Purchase of 1803 and pushed Caddo populations away from their river settlements
(Girard et al. 2002).
The Louisiana Purchase did not specify the exact location of the border between Texas and
Louisiana. Spanish and American officials agreed on a strip of “Neutral Ground” between the
nations, also known as the Sabine Free State, bordered on the west by the Sabine River and on
the east by the Arroyo Hondo. Until ownership was transferred to the United States in 1821,
the Neutral Ground was a haven for smugglers, cattle rustlers, counterfeiters, and other
outlaws (Haggard 2010). The Regulator-Moderator War of Shelby County, Texas was an
outgrowth of the lawlessness of the region at that time. The small war began as a feud over
fraudulent land deals and vigilantism. Sam Houston, president of the Texas Republic, was
forced to send an armed militia in to Shelby County to end the conflict in 1844.
3.7.2 The Civil War
Immigration in the early- and mid-nineteenth century brought settlers primarily from the Deep
South. The antebellum economies of Texas and Louisiana were centered on plantation
agriculture and slavery. During the Civil War, approximately 47% of Louisiana’s population
was enslaved, as was approximately 30% of Texas’s population (Smith et al. 1983, Campbell
2010). The plantations produced cash crops mainly of cotton, but also sugarcane and tobacco.
Small settlements along the Sabine River, such as Sabinetown and East Hamilton, served as
distribution sites for the cotton produced on nearby plantations (Ferguson 2010). Railroad
construction in Texas began in the 1850s and, along with the use of river steamboats, helped to
connect inland settlements with gulf and river ports.
Though divisions existed, a majority of legislators in east Texas and Louisiana voted for
secession. In addition to many soldiers, both Texas and Louisiana supplied goods for the
Confederacy until major ports in Galveston and New Orleans were blockaded by Union
forces. Louisiana and Texas cotton and other goods were then smuggled over land to Mexico
for export.
Louisiana was soon defeated during the Civil War as Union forces captured the Mississippi
22
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

River and New Orleans. The Battle at Mansfield is remembered as a minor Confederate
victory that turned back a Union assault up the Red River in De Soto Parish. The aim of that
failed Union campaign was to invade Texas. Much of the action in Texas during the Civil War
was limited to occupations of Gulf Coast ports.
The years of reconstruction after the Civil War brought many social and economic changes to
Texas and Louisiana. Two settlement patterns are evident in the late 1800s. As plantations
broke apart after the Civil War, small tenant farmhouses appeared at field edges and in
floodplains (Girard et al. 2002). Small communities also grew around sawmills and railroad
junctions as the timber industry expanded in east Texas and northwest Louisiana.
The short-leaf pine and hardwoods of East Texas were put to use in mills from the early 1800s
onward. At the time of the Civil War there were some 200 sawmills in Texas and the great
virgin pine forests of eastern Texas had, for the most part, been untouched. The logging
industry boomed in Texas in the late nineteenth century until the Great Depression. Company
mill towns, connected to markets by ever-expanding rail lines, sprang up. For years, many
companies clear-cut tracts and then headed to the west coast toward the next virgin stands of
timber. Because the east Texas soil was better suited to pine trees than any kind of agricultural
production, programs of reforestation and selective harvesting were eventually begun.
3.7.3 Post Bellum and Twentieth Century Developments
In the decades after the war, railroads were slowly rebuilt and new lines created. By the 1880s,
east Texas had well-developed rail connections to the transcontinental lines that crisscrossed
the state. The first railroad bridge across the Texas/Louisiana border was completed in 1886,
connecting Houston to Shreveport. The growth of railroads made possible growth in other
industries. Old rail line spurs in the Sabine National Forest are evidence of the timber
industry’s interdependence with rail in the early twentieth century.
At the start of the twentieth century, the region’s first large wells and refineries were
producing oil in east Texas and western Louisiana and along the Gulf Coast. The oil and gas
industry would grow to be one of the most important economic engines in the region. Few
commodities were exempt from the falling prices when the Great Depression hit: cotton, oil,
and timber all sold at record lows. During the Great Depression, exhausted forest tracts were
purchased by the government, creating the Sabine National Forest in eastern Texas among
others. New Deal programs put thousands of men to work in the forests with the creation of
the Civilian Conservation Corps.
The twentieth century saw an increasing urbanization of the region as people migrated from
the country to cities. After World War II, the number of farms and farmers dropped and
industrialization grew. Texas and Louisiana cooperated on the creation of Toledo Bend Dam
and Reservoir. Construction of the Project began in the early 1960s and the powerhouse was
completed in 1969. Flooding much of the bottomland along the Sabine River north to
Logansport, the dam and reservoir provide electrical power as well as fishing and other
recreational opportunities.

4.0 RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
The primary goals of Tasks 1 and 2 as outlined in the Study Plan were twofold: 1) identify
portions of the Project APE with the potential to directly or indirectly affect archaeological
resources, and 2) highlight areas of greatest concern to assist the Working Group in the
identification of a priority subset of loci for immediate field investigation.
Goal #1 was accomplished by performing an intensive desktop analysis involving background
research, a literature review, extensive archival data collection including geo-referencing and
digitizing features recorded on historical maps showing the Project area, and gathering
informant reports. These activities resulted in the identification of areas where potential
Project effects including erosion, Project operations, looting, and vandalism were occurring or
most likely to occur.
Goal #2 was accomplished by using existing assumptions about environmental factors that
combine to form desirable sites for prehistoric occupation to create a GIS-based predictive
model for the Project area. The model was tested against known archaeological site locations.
Potential effects to cultural resources, as identified in Goal #1, were applied to the model in
order to define areas of immediate and greatest concern.

4.1 Background Research and Literature Review
In support of the PAD submittal to FERC in 2008, HRA Gray & Pape completed records
reviews designed to identify previously recorded cultural resources and previous
investigations located within a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile) study radius of the Project (Soltysiak et
al. 2008). This research was completed in April and August 2008 by consulting records on file
in Texas and Louisiana. In December of 2009, under Task 1 of the cultural resources study for
the ILP, HRA Gray & Pape conducted additional site file research at the THC, Texas
Archaeological Research Laboratory (TARL), and LDOA to obtain records for sites identified
within the Project APE between August 2008 and December 2009. Copies of relevant files for
sites recorded by the USFS, but not filed with TARL, were also requested.
Data collection for the 2008 PAD filing and subsequent research included a review of all
topographic quadrangles within a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile) radius of the Toledo Bend Project
boundary. The locations of all known cultural resources including archaeological sites, historic
structures, cemeteries, historical markers, State Archaeological Landmarks (SALs), Recorded
Texas Historic Landmarks (RTHLs), and NRHP properties were plotted on maps and their
spatial coordinates were collected. Information collected from each resource record included
trinomial and/or designation, name (if applicable), resource type, temporal affiliation, size,
depth of subsurface deposits (if applicable), description of environmental setting, and NRHP
status or eligibility recommendation.
Archival research was carried out at other state and local repositories. In Texas, copies of
pertinent files at the county archives, local historical museums, archaeological societies and
local universities were obtained. Visits to the General Land Office (GLO), the University of
24
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

Texas at Austin, and the office of the Texas Natural Resources Information Systems (TNRIS)
were also conducted. In Louisiana, the LDOA was revisited and attempts to contact local
informants and avocational historians in Louisiana were made.
The resultant collection of data included: recently recorded archaeological site records;
previously unreported cultural resource records on file with the USFS; copies of reports and
publications of past cultural resources investigations and historical studies in the area;
numerous historic survey maps, topographic maps, and aerial images. Of particular interest
were historic maps from the mid-1800s to the 1940s. These were reviewed for the presence of
historic and environmental features prior to Project construction including cemeteries,
agricultural fields, trails, roads, structures, extant and remnant waterways, and the natural river
channel.
Other sought information included informant reports of active erosion, reported looting, and
vandalism. Personnel from SRA-TX and SRA-LA, personnel from shoreline campgrounds,
marinas, recreational parks, and local shoreline residents were contacted and provided
questionnaires with accompanying maps of the general Project area. The requested
information was used to gain an understanding about the following Project effects: 1) erosion
occurring along the shoreline of Toledo Bend Reservoir, 2) known episodes of looting at
archaeological sites, and 3) whether or not vandalism was occurring.
Approximately 68 participants were asked to provide information for the study. Of those, 3
were sent questionnaires with maps via facsimile (fax), 7 were mailed a packet containing a
questionnaire and maps, and 1 was emailed the questionnaire and maps. Eleven telephone
interviews were conducted and recorded. Of the 3 questionnaires sent via fax 1 was returned.
Of the 7 mailed packets, 4 were returned. No response was received from approximately 45
participants.

4.2 Establishing and Refining the Project APE
As described in Section 1.1, the Project APE, as defined by the FERC and provided by the
Authorities to HRA Gray & Pape in GIS shapefile format, includes area within the 53.3-meter
(175-foot) amsl contour in and around the Project. All area between the reservoir’s normal
pool elevation of 52.4 meters (172 feet) amsl and the 53.3-meter (175-foot) amsl contour,
defined as the Project boundary, was included in the APE.
In order to satisfy Goal #2, the APE was further refined to emphasize the Project shoreline,
where immediate field investigation is most warranted. Focusing on the shoreline excludes
areas of extensive floodplain or marsh from Phase I consideration, as these areas are likely to
be less threatened by erosion, looting, and vandalism.

4.3 Predictive Modeling of the APE
Since the 1960s, the use of models to increase the likelihood of encountering intact
archaeological resources during field investigations has become widespread (Kvamme 2006).
Under Task 2 of the Study Plan, 2 predictive models were designed for the Project: an
25
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

Archaeological Predictive Model (APM), and an Environmental Effects Model (EEM).
These models were developed using a combination of environmental GIS data, aerial imagery,
modern and historic topographic maps, and informant feedback. Specifically, GIS data
included the following:
1) recorded soils data, including drainage class and Wind Erosion Group (WEG) as
mapped by the United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources
Conservation Service (USDA-NRCS) (SSURGO 2009, 2008, 2007a-c, 2006);
2) Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of 30-meter (100-foot) horizontal resolution for
the region provided by the Authorities;
3) topographic contours provided by the Texas Natural Resources Information System
(TNRIS) website (2010), and the Atlas: Louisiana Statewide GIS (ALSGIS) website
(2010);
4) hillshade rasters provided by the TNRIS website (2010), and the ALSGIS website
(2010);
5) waterways associated with the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) as compiled
by the United States Geological Survey ([USGS] 2004);
6) historic plat maps (Von Rosenberg 1863);
7) recent and historic (circa 1940s) 7.5 and 15-minute USGS topographic quadrangle
maps;
8) locations of boat ramps, campgrounds, public parks, and marinas provided by the
Authorities and digitized in GIS; and
9) locations of informant-reported erosion and site looting digitized in GIS.
Non-GIS derived data were gathered from the THC, TARL, LDOA, and USFS. These data
were digitized and incorporated into the models. To develop and manage data such as slope
and waterflow across the Project area, ArcGIS 9.3.1 with Spatial Analyst and 3D Analyst
extensions was used.
4.3.1 The Archaeological Predictive Model (APM)
In general, the APM was designed to predict locations of archaeological sites within the APE
under a set of environmental variables based on accepted hypotheses related to settlement
patterns (Williams et al. 1973). For example, archaeological sites in the region are most
commonly found in locations characterized by favorable environmental conditions including
flat-level topography with somewhat well-drained to well-drained soils, and access to fresh
water and other natural resources.
26
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

Using ArcGIS, HRA Gray & Pape highlighted all Project areas containing a series of
favorable environmental conditions and removed from Phase I consideration all areas
containing unfavorable conditions. The product of these activities was the development of an
APM specified to the Project area. The development of the APM followed a deductive
approach by which intersections of environmental variables were relied upon as though each
contributed equally to the potential for archaeological resources. Three environmental
variables were used for the model. These included soil-drainage class, proximity to natural
waterways, and slope. The intersections of these 3 variables produced the resultant
environmentally-derived High Potential Areas (HPAs), defined as areas with the most
favorable environmental conditions where archaeological sites are most likely to occur.
Due to the prevalence of silt loam within the Project area, soil type was not distinctive enough
to refine the APM. Therefore, soil-drainage class was instead utilized as one of the measurable
variables. Narrow soil-drainage classes were merged to create 2 broad categories; those soils
whose drainage is adequate to excellent and those whose drainage is poor (Figure 2). More
specifically, the first category included all soils where drainage class was rated as excessively
drained, somewhat excessively well-drained, well-drained, moderately well-drained,
somewhat poorly-drained, and unknown. The second category included only soils rated as
poorly-drained.
The second variable dataset involved building a complex web of remnant and extant
waterways using several sources. The base of the waterways dataset, was derived from the
NHD (USGS 2004), listed above. These data were used to digitize existing well-defined
waterways. Other large waterways were visually digitized using geo-referenced topographic
maps that predate the construction of the Toledo Bend Reservoir. Finally, by using hydrologic
modeling in Spatial Analyst, smaller remnant tributaries and drainages that are not visually
portrayed on topographic maps but present according to the analysis of water flow patterns
across the local relief were also captured.
The waterways dataset was buffered in ArcGIS by 300 meters (~1000 feet) (Figure 2). This
was done for 2 reasons; to capture a distance from water that is within a generally accepted
range as preferred for site location (see Chapter 6) and to capture upland terraces that are
believed to have been the preferred landforms for site location.
Slope was the final variable evaluated in the development of the APM. Slope was derived
from DEM files and visually checked against topographic contours. Excessive slope deemed
unfavorable as practical living surfaces, was removed from consideration (Figure 2).
Two final layers of data were evaluated as both stand-alone variables and as variables upon
which the validity of the APM was tested. Previously recorded cultural resources point data of
all previously identified archaeological sites, recorded cemeteries, SALs, RTHLs, and NRHP
properties.

Archaeological site boundaries are often unrecorded, and represented only as a single centroid
(or map point) according to a Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) location listed on a site
form or as digitized by TARL, the LDOA, or USFS. Therefore, site centroids were buffered
by 30 meters (100 feet) to create arbitrary polygons to add spatial dimension to the sites.
While true site dimensions remain currently unknown, the application of an arbitrary buffer is
intended to capture some portion of the real site boundary and is sufficient for the purpose of
probability modeling and testing against environmental variables. Likewise, in order to
capture all resources whose undefined boundaries may extend in to the APE, the extent of the
APM was adjusted to capture an arbitrary 30 meters (100 feet) distance beyond the Project
APE.
Historical markers and NRHP properties are also typically plotted as single centroid locations
provided by TARL or the LDOA. Cemeteries and their drawn boundaries were visually
digitized from geo-referenced topographic maps. Cemeteries were buffered by 30 meters (100
feet) to capture area exceeding their depicted boundaries because mapped locations can be
subject to some inaccuracy and cemeteries are particularly sensitive resources.
4.3.2 Test Success Rates of the APM
Two sets of archaeological site data that include an area extending to 30 meters (100 feet)
beyond the APE were used to test the success of the APM. These datasets included: 1) known
archaeological sites that have been reported to the state and have been assigned trinomial
identification numbers from the state; and 2) unreported site locations recorded by the USFS
but not assigned official state trinomials.
As a result, the APM captured 95% (n = 299) of all reported archaeological sites with
trinomials. Of the 16 sites that were not captured, 14 were submerged at the base of the
reservoir, 1 site was located in an area with soils classified as poorly-drained, and 1 site was
situated just 70 meters (230 feet) beyond the extent of the model between two HPAs sharing a
single landform.
To test the success rate of the APM, the unreported sites lacking trinomials were overlain. As
a result, the model was 98% (n = 41) successful in capturing these loci. The model captured all
but 1 unreported site that sits submerged at the base of the reservoir. Overall the model
produced a success rate of 95% as result of the tests, indicating that the APM would be a
proficient planning tool for selecting Phase I survey loci.
4.3.3 The Environmental Effects Model (EEM)
The second predictive model, the EEM, was designed to highlight Project areas with the
potential to affect archaeological resources. Like the APM, the EEM emphasizes the
intersections of a set of environmental variables in GIS where the potential to affect cultural
resources is considered the greatest. Selected variables include erosion potential, reported
erosion, accessibility/potential for archaeological looting, and reported looting. The GIS
derived data were limited to identifying areas with the highest potential for erosion and
looting. Erosion potential was derived from the Wind Erosion Group (WEG) dataset, provided
by USGS (Figure 2). The WEG dataset is derived from published soils data that rates the
29
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

susceptibility of soils in cultivated areas to wind erosion (SSURGO 2009, 2008, 2007a-c,
2006). Looting potential was considered high in publicly accessible areas such as marinas,
campgrounds, boat ramps, recreational parks, and public roadways. The facilities were
arbitrarily buffered by 300 meters (~1000 feet), while public roadways were buffered by 30
meters (100 feet) (Figure 2). All other variable data were derived from specific informant
reports of erosion and looting. Areas with reported looting were buffered by 300 meters
(~1000 feet). All layers were overlain in GIS. Areas with intersecting variables were assigned
higher priority ratings.

4.4 Selection Process for Recommended Priority Loci
With both models complete, the HPAs as defined by the APM were refined to facilitate Phase
I selection by comparing them with results generated by the EEM. For Phase I field
investigation, HPAs were divided into 100-meter (300-foot) segments to facilitate in-field data
management and progress tracking. In general, the EEM indicated that the northern portion of
the Project area was not at high risk for erosion or looting due to sedimentation and the lowlying nature of the area. Therefore, HPA segments in this area were removed from Phase I
consideration. Selected HPAs and recorded cultural resources were limited to include
primarily those loci situated adjacent to the immediate shoreline as this area has the greatest
potential to be affected by the Project.
HPAs identified by the APM that intersected with all variables in the EEM (erosion potential,
accessibility/looting potential, and reported looting) or with areas where only looting was
reported were automatically selected as priority loci. Added to these automated selections
were areas selected based on a visual assessment of a combination of factors including:
x

areas near site clusters that intersected with 1 or more EEM variables;

x

areas along the main body of the reservoir where erosion potential is
the greatest;

x

in coves of major and minor tributaries that also intersected with 1 or
more EEM variable;

x

areas adjacent to the confluences of remnant or extant waterways
where site locations are more prevalent; and

x

on islands where the increased elevation may have been preferred for
site location and maybe in danger of erosion.

In addition to these priority survey areas a limited number of loci were chosen that contained
no environmental risk factors in order to test the models.
Known cultural resources were treated as distinct loci, separate from HPAs to avoid
redundancy. Like HPAs, cultural resource loci that intersected with reported looting were
automatically selected as priority loci. Added to those are archaeological sites that:

x

are recommended as eligible for inclusion on the NRHP;

x

have been reported as eroding in the recorded site descriptions;

x

are located along the current water pool of the reservoir where
erosion potential is the greatest;

x

are located in proximity to boat ramps, campgrounds, parks, or
marinas; and

x

are located on submerged near-surface terraces as visible from aerial
imagery that are likely accessible at periods of low water pool.

4.5 Evaluation of the Models
Tests of the APM against known cultural resources within and near the APE typically show a
correlation with the environmental characteristics used in the model. Loamy floodplain
terraces/benches and ridges with acceptable water drainage properties overlooking streams and
small knolls at the confluence of natural waterways seem to be the regional pattern for the
Project area’s cultural resources. As such, it can be expected that a number of unidentified
sites in the APE should also be located in similar conditions across the Project. That said, there
are several noteworthy discrepancies.
While predictive models may show correlations between sites and locations based on a set or
sets of data, the models are limited by the type and amount of information upon which they are
built. Recurring issues with predictive models are the inability of GIS to account for the
cognitive aspect of settlement choice, the analysis of cultural change over time, and the
incorporation of 3D data (Ebert and Singer 2004).
Some examples of potential discrepancies in the APM include sites which may be of a
specialized nature or locations chosen for specific resources not included in the model.
Historic sites may not be subject to the same environmental constraints as prehistoric sites and
their locations would not fall under the assumptions of the APM. Further errors in site
recordation such as incorrect UTM coordinates or undefined site boundaries may be at fault
for missed loci. The GIS data themselves may have inaccuracies built in such as DEM data
with erroneous elevations.
The Project area presents a daunting location for a predictive model as it covers such a large
area with the potential for a wide variety of ecological micro-environments that may remain
hidden within broad landscape characterizations often found in GIS data. Further, changes to
the landscape brought about by the flooding of the reservoir have likely altered the area in
ways that may never be known or understood. Data included in the present models makes use
of informant information that may or may not be accurate, an issue that may be further
complicated by the overall lack of responses that were returned from informants.

The best response to the issues discussed above is to continue to refine the model with data as
it is encountered in the following Project phases. The more information that is plugged into the
model the better the model will represent what is occurring in the real world and thus assist in
the effort to predetermine the locations of cultural resources and the effects that are acting
upon them. At times, this may include only portions of the real site boundary as they relate to
the APE, however, this is sufficient for the purpose of probability modeling and testing against
environmental variables (see Figure 2).
Historical markers and NRHP properties are also typically plotted as single centroid locations
provided by TARL or the LDOA. Cemeteries and their drawn boundaries were visually
digitized from geo-referenced topographic maps. Cemetery boundaries were buffered by 30
meters (100 feet) to capture their entirety and more due to their specifically sensitive nature.

5.0 PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Background research indicates that numerous cultural resources investigations have been
conducted in proximity to the Project area. These investigations have been primarily
associated with academic research projects, USFS research, and more recently for pipeline and
construction projects. Few systematic archaeological investigations within the area were
conducted before the plans to dam the Sabine River were developed. One of the earliest
studies was conducted in 1939 and 1940 by Gus E. Arnold, who performed reconnaissance
surveys in East Texas for the University of Texas and the Works Progress Administration.
The effort resulted in the recording of 200 sites, 25 of which are on the west side of the Sabine
River drainage (Arnold 1940, Girard 1992).
During 1961 and 1962, the Texas Archaeological Salvation Project (a project of the University
of Texas) located 106 sites in the area that would be inundated by the creation of the Toledo
Bend Reservoir. Of these sites, only nine sites were recommended for intensive investigation
while limited testing was recommended at additional 21 sites (Scurlock and Davis 1962).
During 1962 and 1963, the Texas Archaeological Salvage Project conducted test excavations
at 20 of the sites identified in the previous year’s survey as being archaeologically significant.
In addition, 4 newly discovered sites were tested. Ten sites were recommended for limited
testing. Nine sites were recommended for further intense testing including 16SA37, 16SA31,
16SA30, 16SA27, 16DS10, 16DS5, 16DS4, 41SY15, and 41SY64 (Scurlock1964).
During 1964 and 1965, the Texas Archaeological Salvage Project conducted excavations at
the Coral Snake Mound (16SA48), the Salt Lick Site (16SA37a), the Eleven Ton Bridge Site
(16SA37), and the Bison Site (16SA30). Very limited testing was done at the Hurricane Creek
Site (16SA31) and the Salt Works Lake Site (16SA47). All of these sites lie below the current
extent of Toledo Bend Reservoir (McClurkan et al. 1966).
In 1966, both the Goode Site (16SA1) and Area B of the Bison Site (16SA30) in Sabine
County, Texas were revisited and excavated by Southern Methodist University (Woodall
1969). The Goode Site shows periods of occupation by both prehistoric Caddo and early
nineteenth century Anglo-Americans. The Bison Site is a Caddoan cemetery and village. Both
are now inundated by the Toledo Bend Reservoir.
During 1966 and 1967, 4 prehistoric sites were investigated by Southern Methodist University
for the National Park Service: Haddens Bend Site (16DS4), the James Pace Site (16DS10), the
Horatio Kunaz Site (16SA27), and the Coral Snake Mound (16SA48). Salvage excavations
were conducted at these sites, all of which were located within the flood pool of the Toledo
Bend Reservoir or threatened by recreational activities associated with the reservoir (Jensen
1968).
During 1967 and 1968, Southern Methodist University finished investigation activities
recording 27 new sites and excavating 3 prehistoric sites (16SA101, 16SA17, and 16SA100)
(Benham, et al. 1973, Girard 1992).

In 1979, a shoreline survey was conducted within the Yellowpine Ranger District of the
Sabine National Forest in Sabine County, Texas by the USFS in Texas and the Cultural
Resources Laboratory of Texas A&M University. During the survey, 2 sites were recorded,
41SB80 and 41SB82. Artifacts recovered from Site 41SB80 included diagnostic Late Archaic
projectile points, lithic debitage, and ceramic sherds. Site 41SB82 is located on an island in the
reservoir and exhibits non-diagnostic evidence of prehistoric and historic occupation. Neither
site was recommended to be included in the NRHP, but further investigation was
recommended should there be any land modifications (Ippolito 1980).
From 1978 to 1982, Heartfield, Price, and Greene, Inc. (1983) conducted a survey located
north of the Project area along Castor Bayou that recorded 20 sites, 14 of which were historic.
In 1985, the Texas State Department of Highways and Public Transportation conducted a short
archaeological survey before paving a section of Farm-to-Market Road (FM) 3382 in Sabine
County, Texas. Though the project was adjacent to recorded boundaries of the nineteenth
century community of Sabinetown, no evidence of the town was found and no further testing
was recommended (Goode 1985).
In 1985, Deborah Woodiel of the Louisiana Office of State Parks conducted a survey at South
Toledo Bend State Park. This survey located 3 sites: 2 prehistoric petrified wood quarries
(16SA162 and 16SA164) and an early twentieth century historic homestead (Woodiel 1985,
Girard 1992).
In 1987, the USFS conducted a survey in the Tenaha Ranger District of Sabine National Forest
in Shelby County, Texas. Site 41SY3, previously recorded in 1962, was revisited and no
artifacts were recovered. The site was said to be disturbed by the construction of FM 139
(Scurlock and Davis 1962) and inundation and erosion by Toledo Bend Reservoir (Ippolito
1987). It was recommended eligible to be included in the NRHP (Ippolito 1987).
During 1990 and 1991, Northwestern State University’s Regional Archaeology Program
conducted archaeological surveys in the middle Sabine River drainage basin and the lower
Red River valley. The surveys identified 31 sites along the Toledo Bend Reservoir shoreline
or in the middle Sabine River drainage basin. Of these 31 sites, 17 were new archaeological
sites located during a survey of 5 developed parks, and 14 were new and previously recorded
sites located along the lower portion of the Sabine River drainage basin (Girard 1991). Thirty
sites had prehistoric artifacts, 4 of which also had historic and prehistoric components, and 1
site had only historic components.
In 1991, a 33-hectare (81-acre) survey was conducted by Christopher Goodwin & Associates,
Inc. in De Soto Parish, Louisiana and Shelby County, Texas. The survey for a proposed
pipeline revisited 1 previously recorded site (16DS113), a tin-roofed barn, and found it not
eligible for the NRHP and recorded 2 new sites. The two new sites were Locus 4-1 (41SY21),
a small prehistoric lithic and ceramic scatter, and Locus 5-1, a twentieth century dogtrot
house, storehouse, and barn. They did not recommend further testing for Locus 4-1 or for
Locus 5-1 (Goodwin et al. 1991).

34

During 1991 and 1992, Northwestern State University’s Regional Archaeology Program
conducted a 162-hectare (400-acre) survey located mainly along the Middle Sabine River
drainage. This survey resulted in the identification of 42 new archaeological sites and 6
previously recorded sites, 18 of which were recorded in the Sabine River drainage basin.
Several prehistoric sites were discovered or visited during a drawdown of the Toledo Bend
Reservoir and all were described as heavily eroded. These sites included La Nana No. 1
(16SA183), La Nana No. 2 (16SA184), La Nana No. 3 (16SA185), La Nana No. 4 (16SA186),
Highway End (16SA190), Honking Goose (16SA191), Muddy Point (16SA187), and Clare
Point Site (16SA192). Camp Sabine (16SA193) was recorded as the site of a nineteenth
century military encampment east of Sabinetown. It was recommended for further testing to
determine its archaeological integrity (Girard 1992).
In 1993, a 331-hectare (817-acre) survey was conducted by the USFS in the Tenaha Ranger
District of the Sabine National Forest in eastern Shelby County. This survey recorded two
Depression-era farmsteads, Joe Burks Farmstead (41SY95) and Alford W. Parmenter
Farmstead (41SY94), which were recommended not eligible for the NRHP (Skiles and Davis
1993).
In 1995, a 10-hectare (25-acre) survey was conducted in the Yellowpine Ranger District of
Sabine National Forest in preparation for ground-disturbing activities in the timber stands 5, 6,
and 19. Four new sites were recorded (41SB135, 41SB136, 41SB137, and 41SB138), and one
previous site was revisited (41SB128). Sites 41SB135, 41SB137, and 41SB138 are all areas
along the Toledo Bend shoreline where a small number of lithic flakes were recovered from
buried contexts. Site 41SB136 is the historic site of a logging tram shown on Sabine County
maps from the 1930s and 1940s. The path of the tram was still visible on the landscape; built
up in some places and cutting through terraces in others. Rail spikes were recovered nearby.
Site 41SB128 is a prehistoric site originally recorded in 1994 by John Ippolito. During this
revisit, the site boundary was enlarged to encompass four natural mounds. Artifacts recovered
from Site 41SB128 included lithic flakes and a dart point. They recommend evaluation of all
sites to determine eligibility for the NRHP (Wolf 1995).
In 2001, PBS&J conducted a survey of a proposed pipeline and well pad in eastern Shelby
County, Texas for Marathon Oil Company. Two sites (41SY271 and 41SY272) were recorded
during the survey. Site 41SY271 is an early to middle twentieth century house which was
recommended as not eligible for the NRHP. Site 41SY272 is an historic barn located outside
the pipeline project area and which was not surveyed fully. Further investigation of the barn
was recommended (Dippel 2001).
During 2001 and 2002, Northwestern State University’s Regional Archaeology Program
conducted surveys in 13 parishes in northwestern Louisiana. Fourteen new archaeological sites
were recorded and 6 previously recorded archaeological sites were updated. Two of these new
sites were located in Sabine Parish, on small islands that became exposed as water levels
within the Toledo Bend Reservoir dropped in the fall of 2001. Bayou La Nana No. 5
(16SA243) yielded prehistoric artifacts such as Middle to Late Caddoan ceramics and lithic
debitage as well as historic artifacts like early to middle nineteenth century ceramics. Girard et
al. (2002) recommended additional testing of Site 16SA243 to determine National Register
35
CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION – DO NOT RELEASE

eligibility. Bayou La Nana No. 6 (16SA244) had only prehistoric artifacts, including Middle to
Late Caddoan ceramics and lithic debitage. Site 16SA244 was not considered eligible for the
National Register and no further work was recommended (Girard et al. 2002).
In 2004, Sphere 3 Environmental, Inc. conducted a survey along the proposed route of a 32kilometer (20-mile) pipeline in eastern Shelby County. This survey located 11 archaeological
sites; 10 new archaeological sites and 1 site (41SY20) which had been previously recorded by
Scurlock in 1962. Three of the 11 sites are prehistoric, 41SY20, 41SY292, and 41SY494. At
Site 41SY20, Middle to Late Archaic as well as Late Prehistoric Caddo artifacts were
uncovered on a sandy landform beside Flat Fork Creek. The site was identified as a
periodically visited campsite. Site 41SY292 is a small, buried prehistoric lithic scatter on a
rolling terrace near Paul’s Creek. Site 41SY294 is a similar lithic scatter near Dry Creek. Site
41SY295 has both prehistoric and historic components: a buried prehistoric lithic scatter, a
historic cattle pen, and rectangular depression at the ground surface. The 7 historic sites
(41SY286, 41SY287, 41SY288, 41SY289, 41SY290, 41SY291, and 41SY293) all contained
buried artifact scatters and were interpreted to be mainly early twentieth century farmsteads.
The pipeline was rerouted to avoid all 11 sites and no further work was recommended (Belew
2004).
In 2009, a survey of 2 well pads and access roads was conducted by Sphere 3 Environmental,
Inc. Archaeological Site 41PN248 was located along an access road, north of Toledo Bend
Reservoir. Preliminary delineation of the site revealed deeply buried artifacts on an elevated
landform along with an associated earthen mound. Recovered artifacts included chert,
petrified wood, grog-tempered pottery, quartzite debitage, thermally-altered sandstone, and a
Kent projectile point. The project was rerouted to avoid all sites and no further work was
recommended (Belew and Tiemann 2009).
In 2009, an underwater remote-sensing survey of the Sabine River was conducted by PBS&J
in Shelby County, Texas and De Soto Parish, Louisiana. This survey located the shipwreck of
the Neches Belle, a steamboat which sank in 1897, near Highway 84 (Jones and Borgens
2009).

6.0 RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Approximately 338 known cultural resources are located within the Project APE; this
approximation is due to the presence of conflicting data noted in certain resource records, and
is discussed briefly below. The HPA segments and cultural resources recommended as priority
for Phase I of the field survey investigations were selected based on a combination of GIS
modeling exercises outlined in Chapter 4.0 and visual examination of the Project. The
evaluation of potential Project effects on cultural resources located along the shoreline within
the Project APE resulted in the selection of 154 archaeological site locations, 16 cemeteries,
and 2 Texas historical markers (See Appendix A, Figures A1-A22). It is recommended that
these resources be given priority status for Phase I (See Appendix B located on the CD-ROM
included with this document).
It should be noted that in 40 instances, archaeological site trinomials are duplicated. This is
due to a discrepancy between recorded UTM coordinates provided by TARL and those
provided by the USFS for the same trinomial (see Appendix B). The physical discrepancy
between locations is typically less than a distance of 200 meters (600 feet). In Appendices A
and B duplicated trinomials with UTM coordinates recorded by the USFS are identified by the
addition of the letters “FS” to the end of the trinomial. If located within the APE or if
recommended as a priority locus, both locations, or only 1 may be visible on Figures A1-A22
and in Appendix B. Because it is currently unclear as to which location is correct these
duplicates have not been removed from the set of selected site locations. Therefore out of the
total 154 site locations recommended for Phase I of the Project, only 131 total sites are
actually represented. The discrepancies will be resolved as fieldwork proceeds.
Archaeological predictive modeling of the Project resulted in the identification of 1,398
kilometers (869 miles) of shoreline with the potential for containing archaeological sites (See
Appendix A, Figures A1-A22). This amounts to approximately 72% of the entire Project
shoreline. Of that, approximately 161 kilometers (100 miles), or 8% of the Project shoreline
are recommended as priority for Phase I of the field survey investigations, based on the criteria
entered into the predictive models.
While the recommended loci are based on well-established premises in the literature
(Brownlow 2001; Moore 1995; Williams et al. 1973; see also: Cliff and Hunt 1995; Dixon et
al. 1997; Hughey et al. 2004; Hughey and Picklesimer 2004; Turner and Hughey 2006a and
2006b), they should not be the final determining factor. A continued refinement of the models
is also recommended to increase accuracy for cultural resource prediction and environmental
effect across the Project. Ground-truthing of GIS data such as slope, erosion, and the success
rates for predicting archaeological site locations as fieldwork is performed would be highly
beneficial to the refinement of the models. Further, the continued rapport with informants may
add significant data to the sophistication of the models.

Re: Addendum I to Management Summary: Cultural Resources Field Investigations for the
Toledo Bend Relicensing Project in Texas

Dear Mr. Swoboda,

This report is intended as an addendum to the above-referenced management summary for the
Toledo Bend Project (Project) (FERC No. 2305) that was submitted to the Toledo Bend Cultural
Resources Working Group for review on November 8, 2010. As originally reported, the initial
reconnaissance survey effort along the Texas portion of the Toledo Bend Reservoir shoreline
was conducted in April and May of 2010 during an average water pool elevation of
approximately 52.3 meters (171.4 feet) above mean sea level (amsl). During that time, 69 percent
of known sites selected as priority for revisit were reported as submerged (Soltysiak et al. 2010).
As you are aware, water levels in the Toledo Bend Reservoir were lowered during the fall of
2010 to facilitate maintenance at the Toledo Bend Dam. During November 2-9, 2010, HRA
Gray & Pape took advantage of the maintenance drawdown to approximately 50 meters (164
feet) amsl to revisit several priority loci reported as submerged during the spring reconnaissance
effort. This document describes our methods, results, and recommendations for further work at
each locus based on the revisit.
Selected Loci for Fall 2010 Drawdown Revisit
A total of 11 loci were selected for revisit during the water pool drawdown in November of
2010. These included 4 reported prehistoric sites, 5 areas modeled as high potential for
containing buried deposits, also known as high potential areas (HPA), and 2 newly recorded sites
discovered during the spring reconnaissance survey effort. Table 1 below lists the information
known regarding each locus following the initial 2010 reconnaissance survey prior to the revisit.

A brief description of the methods used and the results of reconnaissance at each locus during the
2010 reservoir drawdown are provided below. Based on the results of the 2010 reservoir
drawdown study, Table 2 contains revisions to the initial management recommendations made in
the Management Summary (Soltysiak et al. 2010). Table 2 is located at the end of this addendum
report. Plan view maps (Figures 1-5) illustrating work conducted at each of the revisited sites are
also provided and may be found at the back of this document.
Site 41SB30: This site of a previously reported prehistoric burial is normally submerged. During
the November visit at a water pool level of 50 meters (164 feet) amsl, several hundred meters of
additional shoreline were exposed, including the location of Site 41SB30. The shoreline
environment consists of flats partly covered in grasses and tree stumps while other portions are
bare clay with ‘pitting’ that may be related to wave action. No evidence of burials or ground
depressions were found, but evidence of a roadbed, a pile of prehistoric ceramics, and a broken

2

biface were located approximately 30 meters (100 feet) north of the recorded UTM coordinates
for the burial (Figure 1;Table 2).
Although some evidence of previous collection and discard of artifacts was observed near Site
41SB30, no active looting was observed as a direct result of the water pool drawdown. The
National Register of Historic Places (National Register) eligibility status of this site is not
known. The site does not presently appear threatened by erosion, or active looting/or vandalism.
Periodic monitoring of the condition of Site 41SB30 is recommended only when the reservoir
level dips below 51.2 meters (168 feet) amsl in the future, which is considered to be on the low
end of the normal range of pool elevation. It is anticipated that this site may become exposed
again at this elevation or lower.
Centroids 41SB85 and 41SB85FS: Both of these site centroids, located within 20 meters (66
feet) of each other, were submerged during the initial visit (Figure 2). During the reservoir
drawdown, a terrace was exposed immediately to the west of the site locations, between the
Sabine River and Patroon Bayou. Erosion was evident on the landform where tree stumps and
roots have been exposed on the ground surface. Surface inspection of the exposed landform
revealed only 2 prehistoric ceramic sherds within 5 meters (16 feet) of the UTM location of
41SB85FS. Two shovel tests were excavated at 5 and 15 meters (16 and 50 feet) west of the
centroid 41SB85FS datum and no cultural materials were found below the surface (Figure 2). An
additional exposed landform located approximately 60 meters (197 feet) northeast of Site
centroid 41SB85FS was not tested during the November 2010 effort. Since the National Register
eligibility status of these loci is not known, and they may be affected by Project operations,
monitoring is an appropriate treatment for these resources to determine the rate, severity, and
extent of Project-related effects. Additional field studies may be warranted at these loci based on
future monitoring efforts. Such studies could be conducted if the water pool drops significantly
in the future (Table 2).
USFS Temporary Site #08130700092: This site is normally just beneath the ordinary high water
level of the reservoir. During the November 2010 visit, it was located on an exposed finger ridge
in a relatively calm inlet. There were no signs of erosion or looting. Three shovel tests were
excavated along the high ground of the ridge near the surrounding treeline (Figure 3). A single
chert flake was recorded in a shovel test on the ridge at 20-30 centimeters (8-12 inches) below
the ground surface, which is normally submerged. While the National Register eligibility status
of this site is not known, the site does not presently appear to be threatened by erosion, or
looting, or vandalism. Therefore, periodic monitoring of the condition of USFS Temporary Site
#08130700092 is recommended only when the water pool level dips below 51.2 meters (168
feet) amsl in the future, where it would likely become exposed above water again (Table 2).
HPAs TX101-105: Modeled HPAs TX101-105 were submerged during the initial visit. At a
water pool level of 50 meters (164 feet) amsl in November 2010, all 5 HPAs were exposed. The
near-shore environment consisted of grassy flats sloping gently to the water. A shovel test
excavated near the HPAs contained only very wet sandy clay. There were no signs of erosion
along the shoreline and no evidence of frequent use or access by the public. No cultural materials
were found during a surface inspection, which included locations near previously recorded Sites
41SB87FS, 41SB86FS, and 41SB86. Since, no cultural material was recorded at any of these
HPAs during the drawdown, these loci they are most often submerged under a normal water pool
elevation, no further work is recommended at HPAs TX101-105.

New Site 41SB383: As described, based on the reconnaissance survey conducted in April 2010,
this site is currently composed of 1 fragment of faunal bone and 1 primary petrified wood flake
(Soltysiak et al. 2010) (Figure 4). During the November 2010 revisit, a surface inspection was
conducted of the approximately 40 meters (131 feet) of exposed beach to determine whether the
previously recorded artifacts may have been washed in. No additional materials were observed
on the exposed surface. A shovel test was dug on the gently-sloping beach, north of the site
datum which is on top of the cut bank (Figure 4). No cultural materials were observed within the
additional shovel test at new Site 41SB383. While the National Register eligibility status of this
new site is not known, the site does not presently appear threatened by erosion, or looting or
vandalism. Although no ongoing effects were observed, the potential exists for Project-related
effects over the term of the new license. Therefore, periodic monitoring is recommended as an
appropriate treatment for this site (Table 2).
New Site 41SB385: During the initial visit in April 2010, lithic flakes were noted at this location
on the beach surface, though a shovel test on top of the cut bank did not yield any cultural
material (Soltysiak et al. 2010) (Figure 5). Low reservoir levels in November of 2010 exposed
approximately 38 meters (125 feet) of previously submerged beach surface. Surface inspection
and a shovel test on the beach north of the site datum did not reveal any cultural material (Figure
5). Sediments on the exposed beach consisted of a thin layer of sand and gravel over a red-brown
clay, but no artifacts. Like new Site T41SB385, the National Register eligibility status of Site
TX099-SB1 is not known. The site does not presently appear threatened by erosion, or looting or
vandalism. Although no ongoing effects were observed, the potential exists for Project-related
effects over the term of the new license. Therefore, periodic monitoring is recommended as an
appropriate treatment for this site (Table 2).
Unverified Shipwreck Maud Howell: The Maud Howell is recorded as an unconfirmed
sternwheeler shipwreck dating to the late 1800s on the north side of the Highway 84 bridge in
Logansport, Texas (Jones and Borgens 2009). HRA Gray & Pape revisited the reported location
of the Maud Howell’s wreckage on November 2, 2010. At that time, the reservoir was
approximately 100 meters (nearly 330 feet) wide from bank to bank. Photographs of the Maud
Howell dating to 1956 indicate the river is no more than 45 meters (150 feet) wide at the location
of the wreckage (McEachern 1956). Marine Archaeologists Bob Gearhart and Doug Jones at
PBS&J, who investigated a known shipwreck, the Neches Belle, in Louisiana and the suspected
wreckage of the Maud Howell in 2009 indicated that the river in these 1956 images is well below
the 50-meter (164-foot) amsl (Gearhart and Jones, personal communication 2010). While the
width of a free flowing river may often fluctuate greatly depending on rain, it is highly unlikely
that the reservoir will ever fall below 49 meters (160 feet) or approach only 45 meters (150 feet)
wide.
During the fall 2010 revisit, the area contained no evidence of a shipwreck. Bob Gearhart and
Doug Jones at PBS&J also indicated that the Maud Howell is likely submerged well beneath 50
meters (164 feet) amsl (personal communication 2010). Gearhart and Jones indicated that the
Maud Howell wreckage is likely buried under a significant amount of alluvium as no sonar
targets were recorded and the Neches Belle, which was located by sonar, was not buried under
alluvium (Jones and Borgens 2009). This shipwreck, if present, would not be exposed during any
future water pool drawdown. Based on this information, no further work is recommended at the
Maud Howell shipwreck (Table 2).
