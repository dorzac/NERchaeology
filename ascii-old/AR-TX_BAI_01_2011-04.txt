Between June 23 and 25, 2008, archeologists from Blanton & Associates, Inc., conducted an intensive
archeological survey of approximately 16,896 feet of FM 3083 from IH 45 to LP 336 in the City of
Conroe, Montgomery County, Texas, prior to proposed roadway widening construction within the
existing right-of-way (CSJs: 3158-01-031 and 3158-01-032). The survey was performed at the request of
TranSystems Inc. on behalf of the Texas Department of Transportation’s Houston District. Investigations
discovered no archeological deposits. Curation was unnecessary.

PROJECT TITLE: Archeological Survey of FM 3083 from IH 45 to LP 336 in the City of Conroe,
Montgomery County, Texas.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The project involved a records review and an intensive archeological
survey with judgmental shovel testing and limited backhoe trenching prior to the proposed widening of
FM 3083 from IH 45 to LP 336 in the City of Conroe, Montgomery County, Texas (CSJs: 3158-01-031
and 3158-01-032). The planned construction would occur only on state property within the existing FM
3083 right-of-way (ROW), which varies in width between 110 and 140 feet. The roadway itself is
undivided, 40 feet wide, and contains two 12-foot wide lanes and two eight-foot wide shoulders. The
planned construction would widen the roadway to approximately 84 feet and include four 12-foot wide
lanes, two 10-foot wide shoulders, and a 16-foot wide raised median with left turn lanes. The existing atgrade FM 3083 crossing at the UPRR would be replaced by an elevated above-grade roadway with the
same configuration (CSJ: 3158-01-31). There are two possible alternatives for this section; one with a
retaining wall and one without (see Figure 3). Although the existing and proposed typical sections in
Figure 3 show only the UPRR section, the existing and proposed typical sections for the remainder of the
project (CSJ: 3158-01-032), as per the project engineer, would be the same as the no-retaining wall
alternative.
The Area of Potential Effect (APE) for archeology is approximately 16,896 feet in length, a maximum of
140 feet wide, encompasses approximately 54.3 acres, and will extend to an estimated maximum depth of
four feet below the existing ground surface for roadway widening, 10 feet or less for the culvert
replacement, and 30 feet or more for bridge support columns at Stewart and Little Caney Creeks.
Available schematics indicate that no new ROW or temporary or permanent easements are planned for
the proposed construction.
PROJECT LOCATION: The linear project area is located in the City of Conroe in Montgomery
County. The project area is located on the Conroe, Texas USGS 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle.
TOTAL ACREAGE: Approximately 70 acres.
DATE OF WORK: June 23 through 25, 2008.
PURPOSE OF WORK: Blanton & Associates, Inc., is assisting the project sponsor in their compliance
with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 and the Antiquities Code of Texas.

COMMENTS: Investigations discovered no archeological resources. Based on the lack of archeological
deposits within the project area, Blanton & Associates, Inc. recommends that the proposed construction
be allowed to proceed as planned within the existing ROW without additional investigations. As the
proposed project area has been extensively modified by buried utilities, drainage improvement, and
roadway construction and maintenance, it is extremely unlikely that intact buried cultural resources would
be discovered during construction. If the planned construction should require additional work space
outside of the existing ROW, then additional investigations in those areas would be necessary.

I NT R ODUC T I ON
Between June 23 and 25, 2008, archeologists from Blanton & Associates, Inc. (B&A) conducted an
intensive archeological survey of approximately 16,896 feet of FM 3083 from IH 45 to LP 336 in the City
of Conroe, Montgomery County, Texas (Figures 1 and 2). The survey was performed prior to proposed
roadway widening construction within the existing FM 3083 right-of-way (ROW) (CSJs: 3158-01-031
and 3158-01-032). The survey was performed at the request TranSystems, Inc., on behalf of the Texas
Department of Transportation’s Houston District.
The planned construction would occur only on state property within the existing FM 3083 ROW, which
varies in width between 150 and 180 feet. The roadway itself is undivided, 40 feet wide, and contains two
12-foot wide lanes and two eight-foot wide shoulders. The planned construction would widen the
roadway to approximately 84 feet and include four 12-foot wide lanes, two 10-foot wide shoulders, and a
16-foot wide raised median with left turn lanes (Figure 3). The existing at-grade FM 3083 crossing at the
UPRR would be replaced by an elevated above-grade roadway with the same configuration (CSJ: 315801-31). There are two possible alternatives for this section; one with a retaining wall and one without (see
Figure 4). Although the existing and proposed typical sections on Figure 4 show only the UPRR section,
the existing and proposed typical sections for the remainder of FM 3083 (CSJ: 3158-01-032), as per the
project engineer, would be the same as the no-retaining wall alternative.
The Area of Potential Effect (APE) for archeology is approximately 16,896 feet in length, a maximum of
180 feet wide, encompasses approximately 70 acres, and will extend to an estimated maximum depth of
four feet below the existing ground surface for roadway widening, 10 feet or less for the culvert
replacement, and 30 feet or more for bridge support columns at Stewart and Little Caney Creeks.
Available schematics indicate that no new ROW or temporary or permanent easements are planned.
As the construction would occur on property owned by the State of Texas and administered by TxDOT,
the project is subject to the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas, now subsumed in Title 13, Part II
of the Texas Administrative Code. This legislation defines the necessary conditions for recognition and
preservation of State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) and requires that any state agency must identify
potential SALs through survey of public lands prior to actions that could potentially damage those SALs.
The Texas Historical Commission (THC) Division of Archeology administers the code’s provisions.
Archeological surveys must be conducted under a Texas Antiquities Permit issued by the THC in
accordance with the provisions of the code. The project was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit
No. 4314 issued to Principal Investigator Brandon S. Young.
It is assumed that funding for the proposed highway construction will come in part from the Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA) and, as such, the proposed construction project is also subject to the
provisions of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA). The intent of the
NHPA is to consider the effects on historic properties that might be threatened by actions that are
federally funded or permitted, or which occur on federal property. The act, which created the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), states

that the ACHP must be afforded the chance to comment when any historic properties eligible for
inclusion to the NRHP are present in an area affected by federal agency actions or actions funded or
permitted by federal agencies.
Protection of cultural resources under federal law is tied to eligibility for the NRHP that depends on
criteria defined by the National Park Service (NPS) rules 36 CFR 60. Protection of archeological sites
under state law is tied to eligibility for formal SAL status pursuant to 13 TAC 26.8. Federal and state
review of this project will occur pursuant to the First Amended Programmatic Agreement among the
FHWA, TxDOT, Texas State Historic Preservation Officer (TXSHPO), and the ACHP Regarding the
Implementation of Transportation Undertakings (PA-TU), as well as the Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) between TxDOT and THC. Field investigations were also conducted in accordance with the
aforementioned PA-TU and MOU.
The survey was designed to comply with appropriate archeological survey methods as defined in the
Department of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983), the Guidelines of the Council of
Texas Archeologists (1987), and survey standards developed by the THC in conjunction with the Council
of Texas Archeologists (THC n.d.). The primary intent of the survey was to identify and describe all
cultural resources discovered within the APE, evaluate their potential eligibility for nomination to the
NRHP or for formal SAL designation, and should significant cultural resources be located, make
recommendations for future cultural resource management options such as avoidance, preservation, or
further investigations.

The project area is located on the Gulf Coastal Plain in the Piney Woods of southeast Texas—“the
western margin of the southern coniferous forest belt that stretches…virtually uninterrupted from the
Atlantic Ocean” (Jordan et al. 1982:29). The Piney Woods of Texas encompasses approximately 25,000
square miles and supports a variety of pine and hardwood species (Jordan et al. 1982:28).
Topographically, the study area is nearly level to gently rolling. Climate of the project area is
characterized as humid subtropical with abundant and well-distributed precipitation (McClintock et al.
1972:67). Recent environmental studies for this project area identified no drainages with defined channels
in the archeology APE.
Geology of the project area is the Pleistocene-age Willis Formation that is described as:
clay, silt, sand, and siliceous gravel of granule to pebble size, including some petrified
wood; sand coarser than in younger rocks, noncalcareous; mostly deeply weathered and
lateric, indurated by clay and cemented by iron oxide locally, iron concretions abundant
and locally used as road material in coastward belt of outcrop (Barnes 1992).
There is no Holocene alluvium mapped along Stewart and Little Caney Creeks but the scale at which the
geologic atlas is mapped did not preclude the presence of Holocene alluvium along these drainages.
Soil within the project area belong to the Conroe soil association, which consists of deep, rolling to gently
sloping soils on ridge tops and side slopes that developed from loamy deposits. The association is
primarily Conroe loamy fine sand, 0 to 5 percent slopes. The soil is nearly level to gently sloping, sandy,
and loamy. Bibb soils, frequently flooded, are a component of the association and found along Stewart
Creek and one of its unnamed tributaries just east of IH 45. Additional constituent soils include
Susquehanna fine sandy loam (1 to 5 percent slopes) on the east bank of Little Caney Creek and
Splendora fine sandy loam in the eastern end of the APE. They extend to a depth of approximately 20 to
40 inches below ground surface overlying clayey subsoil or basal clay (McClintock et al. 1972).
Montgomery County lies within the Austroriparian biotic province (Blair 1950). Vegetation typical of this
region is a mosaic of pine and hardwood species. Two general vegetation communities, (longleaf pine and
pine-oak) thrive throughout the Austroriparian province—longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) is prolific in the
southeast portion of the province where the project area is located, while pine-oak forests dominate to the
north and west (Blair 1950). The current study area occupies the longleaf pine zone, which is
characterized by a mixture of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), yellow pine (Pinus echinata), red oak (Quercus
shumardii), postoak (Quercus stellata), and blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica). Land use adjacent to
the FM 3083 corridor in the project area is a mixture of commercial, industrial, and undeveloped tracts.

A review of data available at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) on the THC’s online
Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) was conducted to determine the presence of any previously
recorded sites or previous project areas within or adjacent to the current study area. The review indicated
that there are no prehistoric or historic cultural resources within a one kilometer radius of the APE.
However, a series of cultural resource investigations have been conducted within 1,000 meters of the
project area.
The earliest recorded site within the search radius is 41MQ2, which was documented by John Clark in
1978. The site consisted of a sparse subsurface lithic scatter exposed by bulldozer activity on the east
bank of Little Caney Creek just north of LP 336. The site was described as essentially destroyed with no
research potential (TASA).
In 1986, the State Department of Highways and Public Transportation (SDHPT) conducted a survey
along SH 75 from LP 336 to just north of FM 3083. No archeological deposits were discovered. In 1988,
the SDHPT conducted a cultural resources survey for the FM 3083 corridor east of IH 45. No sites were
discovered along the highway corridor (TASA, Montgomery County files).
Approximately one kilometer southeast of the survey area, TxDOT conducted a small block survey on the
north side of FM 3083 for the proposed FM 1484 corridor in 1993. No cultural resources were discovered
(TASA). In 1996, a survey was conducted along the planned extension of FM 3083 from IH 45 southwest
to SH 105. That study area began in the southwest quadrant of the present study area and extended about
3.5 kilometers southwest to SH 105. No archeological sites were identified during this survey (Turpin
1996). In almost the same location as Turpin’s (1996) FM 3083 extension survey, a second proposed
alignment for the FM 3083 extension to SH 105 was surveyed in 2002 (Barile 2002). No cultural
resources were identified during this survey.
In 2005 and 2006, archeologists conducted two surveys along the east bank of White Oak Creek southeast
of the IH 45/LP 336 intersection (TASA, TARL). The 2005 survey discovered seven buried prehistoric
lithic scatters and/or sparse camp site remains (41MQ201 through 41MQ207) with lithic debitage and a
few ceramic shards. None of the sites were recommended for further investigations. Slightly west and
north of part of the 2005 project area, the 2006 survey resulted in the discovery of two additional buried
prehistoric lithic scatters (41MQ212 and 41MQ213). Due to sparse remains, no additional work was
recommended at either site.
Archeologists conducted an intensive survey in 2005 south of FM 3083 on LP 336 from IH 45 to FM
3083 prior to proposed expansion construction; investigations found no archeological materials (Pickering
2005). Northwest of the LP 336/FM 3083 intersection, an intensive archeological survey was performed
in 2005 prior to the proposed expansion and realignment of FM 1484 that found no archeological deposits
in the project area (Hughey 2005).

More recently, an intensive survey was conducted along IH 45 from LP 336 North to FM 830 for TxDOT
prior to proposed roadway expansion. The report is in production and there is currently no data available
at TARL or on TASA.
Located immediately adjacent to the western end of the project area on the north side of FM 3083 is the
Garden Park Cemetery owned and operated by Cashner Funeral Home & Cemeteries. According to the
cemetery operators, the Garden Park Cemetery was opened on undeveloped land in 1954 (personal
communication 2006). Since the cemetery has been operating since 1954, any potential graves located
within the FM 3083 ROW would have been identified prior to the SDHPT’s construction of FM 3083 east
of IH 45.

B&A conducted a 100 percent non-collection pedestrian survey of the project area with surface and
subsurface investigations in compliance with appropriate archeological survey methods as defined in the
Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983), the Guidelines of the Council of Texas
Archeologists (1987), and survey standards developed by the THC in conjunction with the Council of
Texas Archeologists (THC n.d.). Prior to field investigations, records at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) and data available from the THC’s online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
(TASA) were reviewed for previous investigations and previously recorded site data. All field
investigations were thoroughly documented with digital cameras.
Based on data from the Houston District's Potential Archeological Liability Map (PALM) of the APE, the
study area was primarily subjected to a surface survey without deep reconnaissance, though deep testing
was conducted at Stewart Creek and Little Caney Creek (Figure 4). Surface investigations involved an
inspection of the ground surface within the APE, as well as the ground surface on adjacent private
property visible from the existing FM 3083 ROW. Where possible, cutbank profiles along Stewart and
Little Caney Creeks Creek were inspected for buried archeological deposits. Because the proposed
construction would occur within the existing disturbed ROW, it was the opinion of B&A that it was
unlikely that the project area contained deeply buried intact and potentially significant cultural resources
except at the two drainages. As such, judgmental shovel tests (STs) and shovel probes (SPs) were
excavated throughout the APE, while backhoe trenching occurred where possible at Stewart and Little
Caney Creeks.
Shovel Tests and SPs were 30 to 40 centimeters in diameter and excavated with a standard round point
shovel or, if excavated with a spade, 40 centimeters on a side in arbitrary 20-centimeter levels. All soils
removed from shovel tests were screened through 0.25 inch wire mesh to ensure artifact recovery. Shovel
probes were 10 to 15 centimeters deep and were utilized to confirm the shallow depth to basal clay. All
appropriate data were recorded on a B&A shovel test form, and all shovel test locations were plotted with
a hand-held global positioning system (GPS) receiver.
Backhoe trenches were approximately five meters (16.4 feet) long, 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) wide, and 1.5
meters (4.9 feet) deep. Following excavations, archeologists cleaned and examined trench walls to locate
any in situ artifacts, features, and/or soil anomalies in the trench profiles. Stratigraphic units in each
trench were recorded on a B&A Geologic Profile form and photographed. Backhoe trench locations were
plotted with hand-held GPS receivers.

R E SUL T S OF I NV E ST I G A T I ONS
Intensive survey efforts on FM 3083 from IH 45 to LP 336 (Figures 5.1 through 5.3) indicated that the
existing ROW has experienced substantial surface and subsurface disturbances from erosion, buried (i.e.,
fiber optic cable, sewer, water, and natural gas pipelines) and overhead (electric transmission lines)
utilities, as well as roadway construction (cut-and-fill construction removed up to several feet of the
natural sediments throughout the APE, a substantial steep roadway fill section in many locations, and
drainage improvements that include ditches, culverts, and drains). Figures 6 and 7 provide representative
views of the APE. In addition to utilities in and immediately adjacent to the ROW, there are lateral natural
gas, water, and sewer pipes running perpendicular to the APE serving nearby commercial, industrial, and
residential properties. Investigations on FM 3083 included the excavation of backhoe trenches at Stewart
Creek and Little Caney Creek (Appendix A), as well as the excavation of 29 shovel tests (STs) (Table 1)
and 10 shovel probes (SPs) throughout the remainder of the APE.

As Table 1 indicates, the majority of all excavated STs, whether near drainages or elsewhere, encountered
compacted sandy and clayey construction fill (that became too hard and dense with depth to continue
excavations) overlying Pleistocene basal clay. Because of wet conditions and a concern for getting the
backhoe stuck at Little Caney Creek, investigations there focused on shovel testing. The deepest
(100 centimeters below ground surface) STs (nos. 1 through 6) excavated during the survey were located
at Little Caney Creek where they revealed sandy clay fill over sandy basal clay. Shovel testing discovered
no archeological deposits.

The 10 SPs confirmed that locations exhibiting basal clay at the ground surface did in fact represent
exposures of basal clay rather than construction fill or other introduced soil (see Figures 5.1 through 5.3).
In such areas, erosion and mechanical disturbances have removed all but the Pleistocene-age basal clay.

Despite a high density of utilities, trenching was possible in all four quadrants of the FM 3083 crossing at
Stewart Creek as follows: BHT 1 was located in the southwest quadrant of the creek crossing, BHT 2 in
the northwest quadrant, BHT 3 in the northeast quadrant, and BHT 4 in the southeast quadrant (see
Figure 5.2). Excavation of BHTs 1 through 4 revealed three stratigraphic zones between 0 and 200
centimeters below ground surface.
On the west bank of the creek, BHTs 1 and 2 exhibited similar stratigraphy, with Zones I and II
consisting, respectively, of sand construction fill and sandy clay construction fill from ground surface to a
maximum depth of 65 centimeters below ground surface (Figure 8; see Appendix A). Zone III in BHTs 1
and 2 consisted of moist and firm truncated basal sandy clay between 150 and 200 centimeters. In BHT 1,
the water table was encountered at 185 centimeters and water seepage began to collapse the trench so
excavations were halted at 200 centimeters. This also occurred in BHT 2 at a depth of 150 centimeters
(see Appendix A).

On the east bank of Stewart Creek BHTs 3 and 4, though also containing three broad soil zones, revealed
slightly different stratigraphy than BHTS 1 and 2 (Figures 9 and 10). Between 0 and 40 centimeters
below ground surface in BHT 3, Zone I consisted of sandy construction fill overlying sandy clay
construction fill (Zone II) extending from 40 to 130 centimeters below ground surface. Between 130 and
150 centimeters, Zone III was intact strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) sandy basal clay with brownish gray
(10YR 6/2) mottles. In BHT 4, Zone I (0 to 35 centimeters) and Zone II (35 to 86 centimeters) consisted
of dry compacted sandy clay fill overlying Zone III (86 to 160 centimeters), moist yellow (7.5YR 7/6)
sandy basal clay with light gray (10YR 7/2) mottles (see Appendix A).

Because of wet soil conditions and a concern for getting the backhoe stuck, subsurface testing at Little
Caney Creek involved the excavation of only one trench (BHT 5), so STs 1 through 6 were also
excavated (see Figure 5.2). Similar to BHTs 1 through 4, BHT 5 contained three broad soil zones (I
through III) between 0 and 200 centimeters below ground surface (Figure 11; see Appendix A). As
mentioned, backhoe trenching at Little Caney Creek was augmented with the excavation of six shovel
tests (STs 1 through 6), all of which contained disturbed fill over basal clay with no archeological
materials (see Table 1).

Given the geology and the extremely disturbed surface and subsurface conditions of the APE as well as
the negative survey results, it is the opinion of B&A that there is no potential for the planned roadway
construction to affect previously unidentified intact archeological historic properties or sites.

SUM M A R Y A ND R E C OM M E NDA T I ONS
Intensive archeological survey efforts discovered no archeological deposits within the existing FM 3083
ROW from IH 45 to LP 336 in Conroe, Texas. Surface and subsurface investigations revealed that the
APE has experienced extensive surface and subsurface disturbances from buried and overhead utilities,
drainage improvement, roadway construction, and erosion. Because of these disturbances, the APE
consists of construction fill over basal clay. Accordingly, it is the opinion of B&A that these sediments
are not conducive to containing intact archeological remains.
The above data suggest that there is little to no potential for the APE to contain previously unidentified
archeological historic properties (36 CFR 800.16[1]) or SALs (13 TAC 26.12). B&A recommends
therefore that because no archeological deposits were discovered within the APE, and the geology, soils,
and levels of disturbance within the APE are not conducive to the preservation of archeological deposits,
the proposed construction should have no effects on any SALs or archeological historic properties
pursuant to 36 CFR 800.4(d)(1).
If it is determined that TxDOT requires additional ROW for the proposed construction, then further
archeological investigations may be necessary in those areas. In the event that previously unidentified
archeological materials are discovered during construction, work in the immediate area would cease and
the TxDOT archeological staff would be contacted to initiate accidental discovery procedures in
accordance with the aforementioned PA-TU and MOU.
