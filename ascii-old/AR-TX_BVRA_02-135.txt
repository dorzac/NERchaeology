ABSTRACT
In April of 2004, Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) conducted a Phase I
archaeological survey for a 29 mile water improvements project in central Brown County,
Texas under Antiquities Permit 3399. In all, 11.37 miles (41.3 acres) was surveyed. The
area was investigated through surface inspection, shovel testing, and backhoe trenching.
The Principal Investigator was William E. Moore and the Project Archaeologist was Edward
P. Baxter.
Two previously recorded prehistoric sites (41BR52 and 41BR98) are plotted on the
topographic maps at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) as being very
close to the project area. No evidence was found that site 41BR52 is within the path of the
water line as currently proposed. A sparse surface scatter of lithic materials suggests that
the extreme northwest corner of 41BR98 may be within the project area. BVRA agrees
with the original recorders that these sites are not significant.
Nine previously unrecorded sites (41BR530 - 41BR538) were identified as a result
of this survey, and one locality was observed. These are lithic procurement sites where
local gravels were tested and collected for tool manufacture at other locations. Since these
sites are restricted to the surface; often are sparse in numbers of artifacts; and contain no
features, they are viewed by BVRA as not significant.
Much of the project area traverses an upland setting away from major streams.
Most of the water crossings are low order streams and tributaries of major and minor
drainages. The soils in these areas are typically shallow and rocky, and deep sandy soils
are rare. The Pecan Bayou crossing is the only one major floodplain crossed by the water
line route. It was examined with a backhoe and four shovel tests, and no buried cultural
materials were observed.
A sample of raw materials and artifacts from 41BR532 was collected for analysis at
the laboratory. These specimens were removed from private property and are not worthy
of curation. Following analysis, they were given to the client to return to the landowner. No
artifacts worthy of curation were collected from the remaining sites.

INTRODUCTION
The Zephyr Water Supply Corporation (WSC) of Zephyr, Texas plans to improve its
water distribution system by installing new water line throughout central and north-central
Brown County, Texas (Figure 1). The proposed improvements include 7.4 miles of 12 inch
water line from the existing Brownwood master meter to the proposed 0.15 MG standpipe
and a pump station located near the existing Brownwood master meter. Additional water
lines located northwest of the existing system include 4 miles of 6.5 inch PVC water line,
9.5 miles of 4 inch PVC water line, 6.5 miles of 3 inch PVC water line, and 2 miles of 2 inch
PVC water line. When the final water line is installed, each trench will be covered with 36
inches of earth.
Other improvements include pump stations and a standpipe. The location of these
features have not been determined at this time. It is the intention of the Zephyr WSC to
place all new water line on private property when possible. The proposed 15 foot
easements had not been acquired at the time of the survey. All segments of the water line
considered to be high probability areas were entered into and surveyed. Areas
investigated included private property and Texas Department of Transportation ROW.
This project falls under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 2966
and the Antiquities Code of Texas. The federal agency sponsoring this project is Rural
Utility Services (RUS), and the RUS representative is Steve Kelley.
Numerous surveys have been completed in the Brownwood area, resulting in the
discovery of important archaeological sites. Since the current project area covers
extensive areas in the vicinity of Brownwood and crosses numerous drainage basins, a
cultural resources survey for this project was required by the Archeology Division of the
Texas Historical Commission in a letter signed by Mark H. Denton for F. Lawerence Oaks,
Executive Director, dated February 23, 2004. The Texas Historical Commission requested
that a professional archaeologist identify the high probability areas for archaeological
survey and examine these areas through shovel testing and/or backhoe trenching
depending upon the specific project impacts in these areas. In order to satisfy this
requirement, the Zephyr WSC retained BVRA to conduct a Phase I archaeological survey
of the project area. This project was carried out under Antiquities Permit 3399. The BVRA
project number is 04-10.
The project area is covered by the 7.5' topographic maps Brownwood (dated 1980
and photorevised in 1987; map number 3198-323), Byrds (dated 1969 and photorevised in
1987; map number 3199-444), and May (dated 1966 and photorevised 1977; map number
3198-333. The route surveyed in Area A is depicted on the topographic map Brownwood
in Figure 2. The area examined is on the east side of the road except where the proposed
water line follows State Highway 2524 to the west. Here, it is on the north side. The route
surveyed in Area B is depicted on the topographic maps Byrds and May in Figure 3. Both
sides of the road were examined.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
General
Brown County is northeast of the geographic center of the state, and the southern
boundary is formed by the Colorado River. Many of the soils in the area were formed
under grass vegetation and are dominantly dark colored and loamy and clayey (Clower
1980:1). Brown County is irregular in shape and has a total area of 961 square miles
(615,040 acres), including 7360 acres of water.
Climate
Brown County is hot in summer and cool in winter when an occasional surge of cold
air causes a sharp drop in otherwise mild temperatures (Clower 1980:1). Rainfall is
uniformly distributed throughout the year with a peak in spring. The average winter
temperature is 47 degrees F. and the average daily minimum temperature is 34 degrees F.
In summer, the average temperature is 83 degrees F., and the average daily maximum
temperature is 96 degrees F.
Soils
According to the Soil Survey of Brown County (Clower 1980), the project area is
located in seven general soil types. In Area A, three types are represented at Pecan
Bayou, the area subjected to backhoe trenching. These are Callahan-Throck-Bonti (1)
(gently sloping to hilly, moderately deep to deep, stony, loamy soils over sandstone or
shale), Frio-Sunev-Winters (6) (nearly level to gently sloping, deep, loamy soils over loamy
and clayey alluvium, and Leerlay-Sagerton-Nukrum (9) (nearly level to gently sloping,
deep, loamy and clayey soils over clayey or loamy sediment.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Introduction
Brown County is located in the Central and Southern Planning Region as defined by
Mercado-Allinger et al. (1996) in a planning document published by the Texas Historical
Commission. At the time of this survey, 529 archaeological sites have been recorded at
TARL. The only sites in the county listed in the National Register of Historic Places or
designated as a State Archeological Landmark are historic sites in the city limits of
Brownwood. Threats to archaeological resources in Brown County include oil production,
agriculture, and surface mining.
General Investigations
Although several significant studies involving prehistoric sites have been conducted
in Brown County, most of the site information was obtained from survey level studies with
little or no subsurface testing. In the Abstracts Database for Brown County, 54 publications
documenting work in the county are listed. Only four reports (Gearhart and Voellinger
1986; Greaves 2002; Weston et al. 2003; Mauldin 2003) mention testing in the title.
Therefore, the remainder is assumed to represent survey level work only.
The largest area examined by archaeologists near the current project area is on
property owned by Camp Bowie just to the south. The following summaries discuss work
at this facility.
Ninety acres were surveyed and shovel tested in 2001 by archaeologists from The
University of Texas at San Antonio (Mauldin and Broehm 2001). Three previously
unrecorded sites (41BR499 - 41BR501) were recorded. These sites are described in the
report as lithic scatters defined by surface materials. Diagnostic artifacts found on the
surface date these sites to the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods of Texas prehistory.
Sites 41BR499 and 41BR501 are believed to represent primarily surface phenomena that
have been impacted by plowing. They are, therefore, viewed as not significant. Site
41BR500, however, contains a high artifact density and undisturbed areas that may be
deep enough to contain buried features.
Significance testing at this site was
recommended.

6

In 2001, archaeologists from The University of Texas at San Antonio surveyed three
land parcels (200 acres) and shovel tested four previously recorded sites (Greaves 2002).
One new site (41BR522) was identified and shovel tested. Site 41BR522 is a small burned
rock midden that was recommended by the researchers for significance testing. Previously
recorded sites 41BR467, 41BR469, 41BR471, and 41BR392 were also shovel tested. In
the CRM Abstract, 41BR467 is identified as a low-density lithic scatter, 41BR471 is a small,
relatively dense lithic scatter, 41BR392 is a burned rock midden, and 41BR523 is a World
War II era military site. The other sites are not described, and no recommendations were
made.
In 1999 and 2001, archaeologists from The University of Texas at San Antonio
conducted testing to determine the eligibility status of 18 prehistoric sites (Mauldin
2003). The sites are defined in the report as burned rock middens (n=16) and
quarry/workshops. Twelve sites are viewed by the researchers as eligible for listing on
the National Register of Historic Places as well as designation as State Archeological
Landmarks. The CRM Abstract is incomplete and does not mention those sites viewed
as significant.
Archaeological testing at four sites (41BR392, 41BR471, 41BR500, 41BR522) on
Camp Bowie was conducted by archaeologists from The University of Texas at San
Antonio (Weston et al. 2003). The CRM Abstract mentions the site types as burned rock
middens and campsites, but does not state which site numbers belong to these types.
Sites 41BR392 and 41BR522 were recommended as eligible for listing on the National
Register of Historic Places but not as State Archeological Landmarks. These sites have
data with good integrity, charcoal, and good recovery of ethno-botanical material.
Area Specific Investigations
In Area A, an archaeological survey by W. Hayden Whitsett of the Texas
Department of Water Resources in 1978 resulted in the identification of 11 previously
unrecorded archaeological sites (41BR91 - 41BR101). One of these (41BR98), is within
the path of the water line as currently proposed. This site is described on the 1978 site
form as a "very sparse amount of lithic debitage." The above information was taken from a
portion of a draft report at the Texas Water Development Board and the site form. There is
no final report on file at TARL. The location of this site and others in the area on the
Brownwood topographic quadrangle is depicted in Appendix I.

7

In Area B, a proposed dam site was examined by W. Hayden Whitsett of the Soil
Conservation Service. Those areas to be affected by the impoundment of Elm Creek were
examined, and five prehistoric sites were identified and recorded. These sites are
described on the site forms as an "open site" (41BR52), "open lithic scatter" (41BR53),
"open lithic" (41BR54), "open lithic" (41BR55), and "quarry" (41BR56). Shovel testing was
not conducted (W. Hayden Whitsett, personal communication); therefore, information
concerning the depth of these sites is lacking. It was recommended by Whitsett that sites
41BR52 and 41BR56 be surface collected. No additional work is recommended for
41BR53 and 41BR55. No statement regarding future work is present on the site form for
41BR54. The site forms are dated 1975; however, there is no report on file at TARL. The
location of these sites on the May topographic quadrangle is depicted in Appendix I.

METHODS
Prior to entering the field, the site records at TARL were checked for the presence
of previously recorded sites within the project area and immediate vicinity. The location of
sites in the area were plotted onto field size topographic maps, and the route of the project
area was downloaded into a computer for use in the field. The entire route was driven by
the Principal Investigator and Project Archaeologist, the sole members of the field crew.
During this assessment, they identified 30 high probability areas for surface inspection,
shovel testing, or backhoe trenching. These areas were assigned waypoint numbers on
the computer that also computed the UTM coordinates. The proposed water line occupies
two different segments 18 miles apart. Therefore, the two segments were assigned
separate area designations. Area "A" represents the area near Brownwood and Pecan
Bayou, and Area "B" represents the area to the north near the community of Holder.
The second phase of this study consisted of an on-site visit to each of the 30 areas.
Much of the project area traverses uplands with little or no soil development. In this part of
Texas, surface exposures containing chert cobbles suitable for tool manufacture are
common, and lithic procurement or quarry sites are numerous. Therefore, every area with
exposed rocks on the surface was investigated as a possible lithic procurement site even
though these localities were not always near a major stream. A 100% pedestrian survey
was conducted at these areas. Most of the sites found during this project were sparse in
terms of numbers of artifacts. Site 41BR532, however, is the largest in size and contained
numerous artifacts. Therefore, a sample of the kinds of materials present was collected for
analysis in the laboratory. Appendix II is an analysis of the artifacts collected and was
authored by William A. Dickens. No artifacts were collected at the other sites. Areas not
selected for survey were either very disturbed, contained shallow soils with no rocks or
features exposed on the surface, or far from any source of water.
Upland areas containing sandy soil were shovel tested. These are low probability
areas for buried sites. Therefore, all testing was terminated after digging at least 10 cm
into the clay. All shovel tests were 30 x 50 cm in size. All excavated earth was passed
through quarter-inch hardware cloth. A shovel test log documenting this activity was kept
in the field (Appendix III). In all, 45 shovel tests were excavated. Prior to any subsurface
investigation all buried utilities were located and marked by the client.
Two previously recorded prehistoric sites (41BR52 and 41BR98) are plotted on the
topographic maps at TARL as being in close proximity to the project area. Special
attention was paid to these areas since they may extend into the path of the water line
easement. Shovel tests and a surface inspection were conducted in the vicinity of
41BR52. Since no evidence of this site was found, no site revisit form was completed.
Based on the TARL map plotting, site 41BR98 is very close to the water line route.
Because of shallow, rocky soils, no shovel testing was conducted.
9

A thorough surface inspection revealed exposed cobbles in the project area, but no
cultural materials were observed. Although the extreme northwest corner of this site
probably extends into the project area, this was not confirmed. Therefore, no site revisit
form was completed.
The third phase of this study consisted of backhoe trenching in a floodplain setting
on the north bank of Pecan Bayou. This was the only floodplain observed within the
project area that was likely to contain deeply buried soils. Shovel probes revealed a sandy
and clay matrix. The Principal Investigator visited the local USDA Natural Resources
Conservation Service office and talked with Ricky J. Marks, Soil Conservationist, who
stated that some of the soils along Pecan Bayou could be quite deep. He also stated that
this bayou has only been subjected to occasional floods in recent times. At this location,
four backhoe trenches were excavated to five feet, which exceeds the depth of the
proposed water line in this area. Soil samples from each level were collected, and a
Backhoe Trench Log was kept. The purpose of the backhoe trenching was to identify
buried intact sites if present.
Each of the four backhoe trenches measured 5 meters long, 24 inches wide, and 5
feet deep. Soil samples were taken from every discernable zone. These soils were
checked against the Munsell Book and bagged. A profile was drawn of the east wall of
each trench, and each trench was photographed. Finally, a GPS reading was taken at the
south end of each trench. The location of the four trenches, profiles, and soil information
for each backhoe trench appear as Appendix IV.
Since the location of the proposed pump stations was not known at the time of this
investigation, these areas were not examined as part of this study. In Area A, landowner
permission had not been obtained for the west side of the various roads in most cases.
Since the Zephyr WSC already had a 30 foot easement on the east side, the decision was
made to place the water line in this area. Therefore, the survey crew was not able to
survey the west side of the road in much of Area A. Where the water line follows State
Highway 2524 to the west the north side of the road was surveyed.
At the time of this survey, the client had not made a decision regarding which side of
the road to place the water line in Area B. Therefore, BVRA examined a 15 foot easement
on both sides of the road at each high probability area. The 30 high probability areas
investigated are depicted on the project area maps in Appendix V (backhoe trenching at
Pecan Bayou excluded).

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
This survey resulted in the confirmation of previously recorded site 41BR98 and the
identification of nine previously unrecorded sites (41BR530 - 41BR538) and one locality
(Appendix V). The newly recorded sites are described in this report as lithic procurement
areas with no features observed and shallow rocky soils. This is consistent with the
findings of other researchers in this area. Testing at prehistoric sites 41BR13 and 41BR14
by Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc., for example, revealed no apparent cultural
stratigraphy and very little depth to the cultural deposits (Gearhart and Voellinger 1986:ii).
The few areas containing sandy soil suitable for shovel testing were negative in terms of
cultural resources.
In the south (Area A), the route of the water line as currently proposed crosses one
major stream (Pecan Bayou). This area contained the only floodplain believed to
potentially contain buried cultural materials. Backhoe trenching, however, revealed a
homogeneous clay loam with few gravel and no cultural materials. This area does contain
locations where gravels suitable for lithic tool manufacture are exposed on the surface.
That prehistoric groups visited these locations is evidenced by the presence of three lithic
procurement sites (41BR530 - 41BR532) and one locality containing a very sparse amount
of artifacts (i.e., one core and a flake).
In the north (Area B), the route of the water line as currently proposed does not
cross any major streams. Therefore, the absence of more permanent campsites is not
surprising. The utilization of this area by prehistoric groups is evidenced by the presence
of six lithic procurement sites (41BR533 - 41BR538). Since no diagnostic artifacts were
found, the age of these lithic procurement sites is not known.
Previously Recorded Sites
No evidence of previously recorded site 41BR52 within the project area was found
as a result of this study. Shovel tests within the water line route south of the site as
depicted on the topographic map at TARL were negative, and no artifacts were observed
on the surface. No statement regarding significance of this site can be made based on this
study.
A sparse scatter of cobbles was observed within the water line route in the vicinity of
previously recorded site 41BR98. Although no cultural materials were observed within the
project area easement, it is likely that the extreme northwest portion of this site does
extend into the project area. This site was not viewed by the original recorder as
significant, and BVRA concurs with that recommendation for the portion within the project
area.

Newly Recorded Sites in Area A
41BR530 - This lithic procurement site is located in central Brown County on a small
knoll at an elevation of 1355 feet above mean sea level (AMSL). The nearest water source
is an unnamed tributary of Pecan Bayou .18 km to the east. At the time of this survey the
land was in pasture, and surface visibility was estimated at 60% to 80%. No artifacts were
recovered from shovel testing; all cultural materials were observed on the site surface and
consisted of tested cobbles, primary cortex flakes, and possible cores. No diagnostic
artifacts were observed; therefore, the age of this site is not known. The north-south
boundary of this site is estimated at 60 m. Because the project area was restricted to a 30
foot easement on the eastern side of the road, the western boundary is not known and the
eastern boundary is restricted to the area examined. This is a shallow site with a thickness
of deposit estimated at 10 cm based on shovel tests and surface inspection of a road cut
bank. This site is not eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places or for
designation as a State Archeological Landmark, and no further work is recommended. A
site map appears as Appendix VI to this report.
41BR31 - This lithic procurement site is located in central Brown County on a low
ridge top in an upland area at an elevation of 1372 feet AMSL. The nearest water source
is Deleware Creek .41 km to the west. At the time of this survey the land was in pasture,
and surface visibility was estimated at 70% to 80%. No artifacts were recovered from
shovel testing; all cultural materials were observed on the site surface and consisted of
tested cobbles, primary cortex flakes, and possible cores. No diagnostic artifacts were
observed; therefore, the age of this site is not known. The north-south boundary of this site
is estimated at 75 m. Because the project area was restricted to a 30 foot easement on
the eastern side of the road, the western boundary is not known and the eastern boundary
is restricted to the area examined. This is a shallow site with a thickness of deposit
estimated at 10 cm based on shovel tests and surface inspection of a road cut bank. This
site is not eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places or for designation as
a State Archeological Landmark, and no further work is recommended. A site map
appears as Appendix VI to this report.
41BR532 - This lithic procurement site is located in central Brown County on the
side slope of a hill at an elevation of 1415 feet AMSL. The nearest water source is
Delaware Creek .75 km to the west. At the time of this survey the land was in pasture, and
surface visibility was estimated at 70% to 80%. No shovel testing was conducted; all
cultural materials were observed on the site surface and consisted of early stage bifaces,
tested cobbles, primary cortex flakes, a core/chopper, and a unifacial scraper.

12

No diagnostic artifacts were observed; therefore, the age of this site is not known. A
sample of artifacts was collected for analysis and later discarded (Appendix II). The
northeast-southwest boundary of this site is estimated at 200 m. Because the project area
was restricted to a 30 foot easement on the eastern side of the road, the western boundary
is not known and the eastern boundary is restricted to the area examined. This is a
shallow site with a thickness of deposit estimated at 10 cm based on surface inspection of
a road cut bank. This site is not eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic
Places or for designation as a State Archeological Landmark, and no further work is
recommended. A site map appears as Appendix VI to this report.
Newly Recorded Sites in Area B
41BR533 - This lithic procurement site is located in central Brown County on the top
of a small upland ridge in a deflated area at an elevation of 1578 feet AMSL. The nearest
water source is an unnamed tributary of Elm Creek .21 km to the east. At the time of this
survey the land was in pasture and a cultivated field, and surface visibility was estimated at
80%. No shovel testing was conducted, and all cultural materials were observed on the
site surface and consisted of tested cobbles, primary and secondary cortex flakes, and
cores. No diagnostic artifacts were observed; therefore, the age of this site is not known.
The north-south boundary of this site is estimated at 100 m. At the request of the client,
both sides of the Highway 83 were examined, and cultural materials were found within the
15 foot easement on each side. Therefore, construction of Highway 83, which passes
through the site, is a major source of disturbance. Because of the restrictions placed on
the survey crew by the easements, the east-west boundaries are not known. the This is a
shallow site with a thickness of deposit estimated at 10 cm based on a surface inspection
of the site area and a road cut bank. This site is not eligible for listing on the National
Register of Historic Places or for designation as a State Archeological Landmark, and no
further work is recommended. A site map appears as Appendix VI to this report.
41BR534 - This lithic procurement site is located in central Brown County on an
upland slope above a small unnamed tributary of Elm Creek .13 km to the east at an
elevation of 1624 feet AMSL. At the time of this survey the land was in pasture, and
surface visibility was estimated at 70%. No shovel testing was conducted, and all cultural
materials were observed on the site surface and consisted of tested cobbles and primary
and secondary cortex flakes. No diagnostic artifacts were observed; therefore, the age of
this site is not known. The east-west boundary of this site is estimated at 100 m. At the
request of the client, both sides of County Road 476 were examined, and cultural materials
were found within the 15 foot easement on each side. Therefore, construction of the
county road, which passes through the site, is a major source of disturbance. Because of
the restrictions placed on the survey crew by the easements, the north-south boundaries
are not known.

This is a shallow site with a thickness of deposit estimated at 10 cm based on
surface inspection of the site area and a road cut bank. This site is not eligible for listing on
the National Register of Historic Places or for designation as a State Archeological
Landmark, and no further work is recommended. A site map appears as Appendix VI to
this report.
41BR535 - This lithic procurement site is located in central Brown County on a
gentle slope to an unnamed tributary of Gap Creek .16 km to the east at an elevation of
1675 AMSL. At the time of this survey the land was in pasture, and surface visibility was
estimated at 40% to 60%. No artifacts were recovered from shovel testing, and all cultural
materials were observed on the site surface and consisted of tested cobbles and primary
and secondary cortex flakes. No diagnostic artifacts were observed; therefore, the age of
this site is not known. The east-west boundary of this site is estimated at 100 m. At the
request of the client, both sides of County Road 477 were examined, and cultural materials
were found within the 15 foot easement on each side. Therefore, construction of the
county road, which passes through the site, is a major source of disturbance. Because of
the restrictions placed on the survey crew by the easements, the north-south boundaries
are not known. This is a shallow site with a thickness of deposit estimated at 10 cm based
on surface inspection of the site area and a road cut bank and shovel tests. This site is not
eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places or for designation as a State
Archeological Landmark, and no further work is recommended. A site map appears as
Appendix VI to this report.
41BR536 - This lithic procurement site is located in central Brown County in an
upland area near the headwaters of a small unnamed tributary of Rough Creek .27 km to
the south at an elevation of 1652 feet AMSL. At the time of this survey the land was in
pasture, and surface visibility was estimated at 70% to 80%. No artifacts were recovered
from shovel testing, and all cultural materials were observed on the site surface and
consisted of tested cobbles, primary and secondary cortex flakes, cores, spalling debris,
and a possible early biface. No diagnostic artifacts were observed; therefore, the age of
this site is not known. This site was found on a small knoll on the south and west sides of
the intersection of two county roads. The size of this site is estimated at 50 m north south
and 50 m east west; no cultural materials were observed on the opposite side of the two
county roads. This is a shallow site with a thickness of deposit estimated at 10 cm based
on surface inspection of the site area and a road cut bank in addition to shovel tests. This
site is not eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places or for designation as
a State Archeological Landmark, and no further work is recommended. A site map
appears as Appendix VI to this report.

41BR537 - This lithic procurement site is located in central Brown County in an
upland area near the headwaters of an unnamed tributary of Hog Creek .7 km to the west
at an elevation of 1595 feet AMSL. At the time of this survey the land was in pasture, and
surface visibility was estimated at 70% to 80%. No shovel testing was conducted, and all
cultural materials were observed on the site surface and consisted of tested cobbles,
primary and secondary cortex flakes, and cores. No diagnostic artifacts were observed;
therefore, the age of this site is not known. The north-south boundary is estimated at 75 m.
At the request of the client, both sides of County Road 406 were examined, and cultural
materials were found within the 15 foot easement on each side. Therefore, construction of
the county road, which passes through the site, is a major source of disturbance. Because
of the restrictions placed on the survey crew by the easements, the east-west boundaries
are not known. This is a shallow site with a thickness of deposit estimated at 10 cm based
on surface inspection of the site area and a road cut bank. This site is not eligible for listing
on the National Register of Historic Places or for designation as a State Archeological
Landmark, and no further work is recommended. A site map appears as Appendix VI to
this report.
41BR538 - This lithic procurement site is located in central Brown County on a
gentle slope on the east side of an unnamed tributary of Gap Creek .1 km to the west at an
elevation of 1663 feet AMSL. At the time of this survey the land was in pasture, and
surface visibility was estimated at 30% to 60%. No artifacts were recovered through shovel
testing, and all cultural materials were observed on the site surface and consisted of tested
cobbles, primary and secondary cortex flakes, and cores. No diagnostic artifacts were
observed; therefore, the age of this site is not known. The east-west boundary is estimated
at 100 m. At the request of the client, both sides of County Road 477 were examined, and
cultural materials were found within the 15 foot easement on each side. Therefore,
construction of the county road, which passes through the site, is a major source of
disturbance. Because of the restrictions placed on the survey crew by the easements, the
north-south boundaries are not known. This is a shallow site with a thickness of deposit
estimated at 10 cm based on a surface inspection of the road cut bank and shovel testing.
This site is not eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places or for
designation as a State Archeological Landmark, and no further work is recommended. A
site map appears as Appendix VI to this report.

Localities
This locality is located in central Brown County on a gentle slope of a prominent hill
to the west. The nearest water source is the headwaters of an unnamed tributary of Pecan
Bayou .39 km to the south. This locality is situated at an elevation of 1380 feet AMSL. At
the time of this survey the land was in pasture, and surface visibility was estimated at least
50% visibility due to a two-track road. No shovel testing was conducted, and all cultural
materials were observed on the site surface and consisted of a single core and several
primary cortex flakes. No diagnostic artifacts were observed; therefore, the age of this site
is not known. Because of the paucity of materials at this area, it was decided not to record
it as an archaeological site, and a size estimate was not considered prudent.
Summary
The project area crosses few major creeks, and a large portion of the water line
route passes through uplands away from streams. Overall, the soils are shallow and
rocky, and deep sandy soils are rare. The one major stream crossing (Pecan Bayou) was
examined through shovel testing and backhoe trenching; however, no buried sites were
observed. The primary use of the area in prehistoric times appears to be the testing and
selection of natural chert cobbles exposed on deflated surfaces for use in tool manufacture
at other locations. The presence of nine lithic procurement sites in the project area
supports this statement. These sites are primarily restricted to the surface and contain few
finished or formal tools. Primary cortex flakes; tested cobbles; cores; and early stage
bifaces, typical of the kinds of cultural materials associated with lithic procurement sites,
were observed at the nine sites in the project area. That this is a common site type in
Brown County is evidenced by the work of other researchers who reported numerous
examples as a result of other archaeological surveys in the county. The areas containing
cultural materials varied from a few specimens at a locality (not assigned a site number) to
41BR532 containing numerous cultural materials and lithic source material.
State Standards
The Archeological Survey Standards for Texas were followed. Factors influencing
the number of shovel tests excavated were the presence of shallow, rocky soils with little
depth over much of the project area and excellent surface visibility in some areas.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Since no significant archaeological sites were identified within the areas
investigated, it is recommended that the Zephyr WSC be allowed to proceed with
construction of the water line as planned. In Area A, only the existing 30 foot easement
was examined. Therefore, any changes in this easement that will disturb areas not
surveyed during this project should be evaluated for future analysis by an archaeologist.
The route passes close to the Pleasant Valley cemetery that is enclosed by a fence and is
outside the project area.

APPENDIX II: LITHIC ANALYSIS (41BR532)
The sample analyzed here was collected from a lithic procurement site
(41BR532) in central Brown County, Texas. In all, 30 pieces were studied. They
include 3 early stage bifaces, 5 cores, 9 large flakes, 1 core/chopper, 1 unifacial
scraper, and 11 pieces of natural cobbles and shatter. All of the lithic materials
were made of irregular shaped, yellow and gray chert cobbles.
The three early stage bifaces are rough flaked and are approximately 3 to
3.5 inches in length. They exhibit only large flake removals that have removed
most of the surface cortex.
The five cores are of varying size and condition. They range between 3
and 6.5 inches in length. The surfaces of these cores contain large flake scars
suggesting use in macro-flake production or material testing for the manufacture
of other tool types. The nine large flakes in this sample represent the waste
debris from coring activities.
The core/chopper may be one of the other tools being manufactured. This
specimen is rough, having large flakes removed from most of its surface and a bit
formed by smaller flaking, with most of these flakes terminating in hinge or step
fractures.
The scraper is a unifacial type made from a macro-flake with a concave
ventral surface. The modified edge has a very steep angle that appears to range
between 90 and 95 degrees with a sharp edge slightly overhanging the ventral
surface.
The remaining material consists of unaltered cobbles, chunks, and shatter
reduced through natural causes. Some of the large cobbles collected contain a
number of internal cracks and surfaces containing large rounded scars. This is
typical of the type of damage resulting from exposure to severe freezing or heat.
The collected material is a good representation of typical lithic
procurement activities. These activities include the testing of materials to
eliminate unsatisfactory pieces, preliminary biface manufacture, large flake
(macro-flake) production, and expedient tool (i.e., chopper and scraper)
manufacture. Those materials selected for further reduction were taken to other
locations, and those expedient types (used for purposes while at the site) were
discarded at the quarry.
