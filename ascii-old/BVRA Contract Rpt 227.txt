ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey for the proposed offsite utilities associated with the
Thompson’s Creek Waste Water Treatment Plant project along a 300 meter segment of
a 12-inch water line in west-central Brazos County, Texas was conducted by Brazos
Valley Research Associates (BVRA) on December 5, 2009 under antiquities permit
5473. The area was investigated by a surface inspection as well as shovel testing and
probing. No previously unrecorded prehistoric or historic sites were identified and
recorded, and no artifacts were collected. It is recommended that City of Bryan be
allowed to proceed with construction as planned. Copies of the final report are on file at
the Texas Historical Commission, the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL), the City of Bryan, the Texas State Library, CSC Engineering and Environmental
Consultants, Inc., and BVRA.

INTRODUCTION
BVRA was retained by the City of Bryan to conduct a Phase I cultural resources
survey along a 300 meter segment of proposed 12-inch water line alignment on land on
the east and west sides of Jones Road in west-central Brazos County (Figure 1). Based
on an examination of the project area as depicted on the topographic map, the soil
survey for Brazos County, and a conversation with other archaeologists, the project
area was considered to be a low probability area in terms of containing significant
prehistoric and/or historic sites. The project is planned for the east side of Jones Road
in the right-of-way of Jones Road; however, it is possible that the city may elect to move
part of the area to be examined by BVRA to the west side of the road. Since the
construction of this project will be financed by a municipality of the State of Texas, an
Antiquities Permit was required, and permit 5473 was assigned to this project. The field
survey was accomplished on December 5, 2009. The project area is depicted on the
United States Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5’ Chances Store (3096-422) topographic
quadrangle (Figure 2).

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area is located within the West Gulf Coastal Plain section of the
Coastal Plain physiographic province as defined by Fenneman (1938:100-120). This
physiographic section is subdivided according to the age of the geological formations
(Gulf series) that roughly parallel the Texas coastline. The area is hilly and situated
within the East Texas timber belt. Gould (1969) describes it as an area characterized
by gently rolling to hilly topography with light colored soils that are acidic sandy loams or
sands. The climate is subhumid to humid, and the weather is considered to be
predominately warm. Annual rainfall for Brazos County is 39.21 inches. A January
minimum temperature of 42 degrees Fahrenheit and a July maximum temperature of 95
degrees Fahrenheit combine to produce a growing season of 274 days (Kingston and
Harris 1983:180). The altitude above mean sea level in the county varies from 200-400
feet. In the project area, the altitude is 240 to 260 feet above mean sea level. According
to the soil survey for Brazos County (Chervenka 2003:Sheet 31), the soil in the project
area consists of Robco loamy fine sand, 1 to 3 percent slopes (RoB). This soil is found
in the uplands and on terraces and is described as very gently sloping. The surface
layer is fine sand to 15 inches, and the subsurface layer is loamy fine sand from 15 to
28 inches. The subsoil is clay loam. It is moderately well drained, and the depth to the
water table is between 1.5 and 3.5 feet.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
According to the Office of the State Archeologist, Brazos County is located in the
Southeastern Region of Texas (Figure 3). A check of the records at TARL revealed that
significant prehistoric and historic sites have been recorded in the county. Prehistoric
sites in this area are typically found on sandy ridges and uplands in close proximity to
dependable sources of water such as creeks and rivers. Artifacts associated with the
Archaic and Paleo-Indian periods have been found at a few sites, but no sites that date
solely to these periods are known in the county, and Late Prehistoric sites are the most
numerous. One site (41BZ132) containing an Archaic projectile point and burned rock
was found during a previous survey of the Traditions Golf Course (Moore 2000), but
additional work is needed to determine if this is a pure Archaic site. Prehistoric burials
have been found at sites in adjacent counties such as 41BU16 and 41BU17 in Burleson
County and eroding from the Brazos River, but no burials have been reported at sites in
Brazos County. The three largest surveys in the county were for the Tradition Golf and
Country Club at University Ranch by BVRA (Moore 2000), the Bush Presidential Library
Center by Archaeology Consultants (Moore and Warren 1993), and the White Creek
Archaeological Project by the Archaeological Research Laboratory at Texas A&M
University (Thoms 1993). Historic sites are not always tied to water and can consist of
standing structures dating to the 19th and 20th centuries and isolated features
associated with farming and ranching such as cisterns, wells, and outbuildings. In
certain areas historic bridges and cemeteries are present. One major historic site is the
Richard Carter house site (41BZ74) that dates to the 19th century (Carlson 1983, 1987).
This site represents the earliest historic settlement in the county at circa 1831.Two early
log structures have been reported in the county. One is an early cabin (41BZ93), and
the other is a log crib or cabin (41BZ89) that has been destroyed. The town of Boonville
(41BZ91), including Boonville Cemetery, was the first county seat of Brazos County and
was established in 1841 (Webb 1952:188).

METHODS
Prior to the commencement of the field survey, the Texas Historic Sites Atlas and
the site files at TARL were checked for previously recorded sites and surveys in the
project area and vicinity. This search revealed that no known sites are present within
the project area, and no surveys have been conducted in the area. The project area
was examined through a surface inspection and shovel testing. Since it is possible that
a portion of the water line may be moved to the west side of Jones Road, tests were
excavated on both sides of the road. Shovel tests were dug at intervals of 50 meters
when possible. However, no tests were dug in a low-lying area that contained standing
water in the ditch. In all, ten shovel tests were dug, and their approximate location is
depicted in Figure 4. Shovel tests were terminated when clay, standing water, or
obvious road fill was encountered. The size of each test was 30 x 50 cm and varied in
depth from 50 to 100 centimeters below the existing ground surface. All excavated fill
was screened through ¼ inch hardware cloth. Data obtained from shovel testing were
recorded on a shovel test log (Appendix I). The project area was also documented
through digital photography.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Examination of the files at TARL revealed no archaeological sites have been
recorded in the Area of Potential Effect (APE). According to the Texas Archeological
Sites Atlas, professional archaeologists have not surveyed this area. The project area
was adequately covered, and no cultural materials were observed. The segment of the
project area that is most likely to contain an archaeological site is a hill at the 250-foot
contour (see Figure 4) on the east side of Jones Road. In this area, the water line will
be placed in a ditch six meters below the apex of this hill. A surface inspection of the
exposed cut bank of the hill revealed sandy soil overlying firm clay, and the water line
will be placed well beneath the sandy stratum. On the west side of Jones Road, this hill
continues; however, the tests dug in this area were negative. There is a hill at the 240foot contour about 1500 feet to the southwest that overlooks the main channel of Turkey
Creek. This appears to be a likely setting for a prehistoric site, but it is outside the APE.
The APE has been disturbed by road construction and buried utilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No previously unrecorded sites were found in the project area. Therefore, it is
recommended that the City of Bryan be allowed to proceed with construction as
planned. It is always possible that archaeological sites are missed during any cultural
resources survey. Should areas containing prehistoric or historic artifacts not discussed
in this report be discovered during construction, the Texas Historical Commission must
be notified immediately and all work stopped in the area of concern until the situation
can be evaluated.
