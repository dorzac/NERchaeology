EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

HDR Engineering, the prime contractor for the BNSF Railway Company (BNSF) and Union
Pacific Railroad (UPRR), subcontracted with Geo-Marine, Inc. (Geo-Marine), to conduct the
cultural resources survey of the Tower 55 Surface Improvements project corridor in Fort Worth,
Texas. BNSF and UPRR are working with the North Central Texas Council of Governments
(NCTCOG), which has applied for an American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA)
Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant, for the project
funding. Geo-Marine conducted this project under Texas Antiquities Code permit #5521 in late
January 2010. A separate survey documenting the historic-age structures was conducted in
December 2009 and early January 2010, and the results of that work are reported separately.
Tower 55 is located in the southwest quadrant of the Interstate Highway (IH) 30/IH 35W
interchange. This interchange includes the rail corridors of the Union Pacific Railroad, the
Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Company, the Fort Worth & Western Railroad, and public
rail. In a previous investigation conducted by Geo-Marine in early 2009, the majority of the
current study corridor was surveyed, resulting in no archaeological resources identified due to
extensive previous impacts to the area of potential effects. As in this project, a separate historicage structures survey was also conducted. This report presents the findings of the archaeological
survey of the remaining segments and some additional parcels acquired (2.19 acres for BNSF and
7.24 acres for UPRR) and necessary for proposed easements or improvements. This corridor is
approximately 4.4 miles long and the right-of-way is generally about 100–150 feet wide. With
the exception of a pedestrian concrete underpass at Peach Street, which will be located 14 feet
below the rails, all of the work will be at grade; in other words, maximum depth of the remainder
of the project is 3 to 6 feet. The archaeological survey was confined to the existing right-of-way
and to the parcels or take areas within parcels that will be affected, approximately 85.9 acres
total.
Two historic-age sites were identified in parcels along the corridor. Neither site is considered
significant for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places or designation at a State
Archeological Landmark, and no further archaeological investigations are recommended at either
site or within the current investigated rail right-of-way, with the exception of the Peach Street
underpass area. Recommendations are that the geotechnical cores from the Peach Street
underpass area be analyzed by a geoarchaeologist to determine the presence/absence of buried
archaeological deposits.

All materials generated from this project will be permanently curated at the Texas Archeology
Research Laboratory in Austin.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

Geo-Marine, Inc. (Geo-Marine), was subcontracted by HDR Engineering, Inc., the prime
contractor for BNSF Railway Company (BNSF [Burlington Northern and Santa Fe]) and Union
Pacific Railroad (UPRR), to conduct the cultural resources surveys (Geo-Marine Project
#30008.07.09.01) along the Tower 55 Surface Improvements project corridor. The project
corridor begins at Page Avenue in the south and extends northward to Northside Drive for the
BNSF track and to about 1,000 feet (ft; 305 meters [m]) south of the West Fork of the Trinity
River for the UPRR track (Figure 1). BNSF and UPRR are working with the North Central Texas
Council of Governments (NCTCOG), which has applied for an American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act (ARRA) Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER)
grant for project funding.
The Tower 55 Surface Improvements project corridor is approximately 4.4 miles (mi; 7
kilometers [km]) long, and the right-of-way is generally about 100–150 feet (ft; 30.5–46 m) in
width. Several small parcels along the corridor will be acquired or leased for easements and
improvements outside of the current right-of-way. These 10 parcels total 3.5 acres (ac) in area
and are composed of small wedges or slivers of land along the track, at road intersections, and
across a parcel for a small track reconfiguration easement (Figure 2). The proposed
improvements would be conducted within the current rail right-of-way (approximately 76.5 ac)
and new areas (approximately 2.19 ac for BNSF and 7.24 ac for UPRR), totaling 85.9 ac
surveyed for the current project, which also is the project area of potential effects (APE). With
the exception of pedestrian underpasses constructed by installing a precast concrete semi-arch or
corrugated structural plate arch on a reinforced concrete pad located 14 ft (4.3 m) below the rails
proposed at Peach Street, all of the work will be at grade; in other words, the maximum depth of
the remainder of the project is 3–6 ft (0.9–1.8 m). Right-of-entry permission was obtained for
any proposed new right-of-way parcels, and right-of-entry for the UPRR and BNSF property is in
hand.
The current survey was undertaken to provide baseline information for the project environmental
assessment as required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 [42 U.S.C. §§
4321–4347; P.L. 91–190; 83 Stat. 852]. This investigation was conducted to fulfill compliance
with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended
through2000 [16 U.S.C. § 470 et seq.; P.L. 89–665; 80 Stat. 915], requiring cultural resources
1

survey. In addition, the ultimate client, NCTCOG, is a political subdivision of the state of Texas
and must comply with the Antiquities Code of Texas [Title 9, Chapter 191, the Natural Resources
Code of Texas]. Accordingly, the present investigation was conducted under Texas Antiquities
Code permit #5521. The ultimate goal was to identify and inventory cultural resources properties
contained within the proposed project APE and to evaluate their potential for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or for designation as a State Archeological
Landmark (SAL).
The archaeological investigation was undertaken in late January 2010 by Geo-Marine Principal
Investigator Melissa Green and Staff Archaeologist Steven Hunt, who also supplied archival
research on the Fort Worth and Denver City Railroad. Architectural Historians Jessica Forbes
and Ann Keen conducted the research for the historic background on Fort Worth before and after
the arrival of the railroads. All materials generated from this project will be permanently housed
at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin.
To design the Tower 55 Surface Improvements project, detailed rail capacity modeling,
engineering, environmental review, cost benefit, and economic analysis were performed between
2007 and 2009. As a result, a specified scope of at-grade improvements was generated to address
the infrastructure needs at Tower 55 (Figures 3 and 4):




Construction of additional trackage north, south, and through Tower 55 on the BNSF and
UPRR, adding an additional main line and improving interlocker capabilities;
Improvements to rail intersection quadrant connections to promote both through and
connection movements at the interlocker and to better support concurrent rail operations;
Enhanced Centralized Traffic Control (CTC) signal and interlocker system to
accommodate the additional trackage and connections through Tower 55, and to increase
maximum rail operating speeds to 30 MPH north/south and 40 MPH east/west;
Structural improvements to existing bridges over Stephenson Street and Lancaster
Avenue and additional improved bridges over Rosedale Avenue, Delga Street, Gounah
Street, and Cold Springs Street;
Improvements over the UPRR Duncan Subdivision and drainage infrastructure north of
Tower 55;
City arterial street/intersection improvements supporting closure of 1st and Peach streets
on the northeast side of downtown Fort Worth;
Construction of pedestrian grade separations at Gounah Street, 1st Street, and Peach Street
to promote crossing safety for elementary school children and other pedestrians.

BNSF RAILWAY IMPROVEMENTS
The proposed alignment along the North End includes the construction of a second mainline track
along the east side of the existing mainline track beginning near the Northside Drive overpass and
extending southward at 15-ft (4.6-m) track centers, across a proposed culvert adjacent to the
existing timber railroad bridge at MP 347.88 and proceeding south across Cold Springs Road at
MP 347.29 with a new double-track railroad overpass. The track remains on the east side of the
existing mainline behind the Radio Shack warehouses and adjacent to the Pioneer’s Rest
Cemetery, across Gounah Street at MP 347.03 via a new double-track railroad overpass and

across the existing Peach Street at-grade crossing via a new pedestrian underpass. The proposed
Main 2 alignment ties into the existing rail siding located just north of East 1st Street at MP
346.72. The majority of the improvements remain within existing railroad right-of-way.
The existing track alignment will be realigned from MP 346.3 through the 17th Street Yard. The
north end of the former yard will be removed or stubbed with only about 2,000 track feet (610 m)
remaining available for Amtrak and maintenance-of-way equipment storage. The proposed
mainline will be moved eastward in order to improve the north–south alignment over the
Lancaster Avenue bridge and through the Tower 55 block, allowing train speeds up to 30 MPH
on the BNSF. The BNSF will realign the lead to the Amtrak tracks located at the Fort Worth
Intermodal Transportation Center (ITC). Main 2 will be constructed for additional CTC territory
from the Belknap Bridge through the 17th Street Yard to the proposed Control Point located north
8

of the NW Tower Connection Track at approximately MP 346.20. Between the north end of the
project at MP 348.00 and the joint track at approximately MP 346.20, BNSF will have
approximately 9,500 ft (2,896 m) clear distance for two mainline tracks.
The proposed new track alignments along the South End begin approximately 0.1 mi (0.16 km)
south of the Vickery Avenue railroad overpass (MP 345.52) , which will not be affected by track
improvements, and continue approximately 10,000 ft (3,048 m) south to MP 343.60. In the area
just south of Vickery Avenue overpass, a new mainline track will be constructed to the west of
the existing mainline tracks in order to create the new third mainline extending south from Tower
55. At about 0.3 mi (0.5 km) south of the overpass, UPRR will design a new connection to the
existing BNSF mainline.
South of MP 345.21, the existing BNSF mainline track will remain along its current alignment to
approximately MP 344.8 north of Rosedale Street, with the proposed second main track
constructed to the west at 25-ft (7.6-m) track centers. The proposed second main track will cross
Rosedale Street on a new bridge structure constructed immediately to the west of the existing
BNSF bridge. The existing track alignment and the proposed alignment will be lined over
immediately north and south of Rosedale Avenue to improve track geometry by removing two
reverse curves and straightening the horizontal alignment for both railroads. These improvements
have reduced the acquisition of additional right-of-way, reduced the potential for impacts to
adjacent resources, and will ultimately allow the BNSF and UPRR to recognize improved
operational efficiencies.

UNION PACIFIC RAILROAD IMPROVEMENTS
The UPRR is proposing to build additional mainline track approximately 25 ft (7.6 m) to the east
of the existing mainline on the Choctaw Subdivision from MP 752.4 to approximately MP 753.3,
while modifying track alignments from the Hole-in-the-Wall at MP 753.70 to Tower 55 at MP
754.5. The UPRR is also adding a connection track from its Duncan Subdivision to the Choctaw
Subdivision across the former Fort Worth & Denver Railway facilities areas in downtown Fort
Worth. The UPRR is upgrading special trackwork at various connections and crossovers to
improve train operations on both railroads through thte Tower 55 signal block.

CHAPTER 2
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

Environmentally, the upper Trinity River basin is located in the Southern Plains and includes
three physiographic zones. Moving from east to west, these zones are the Trinity River Flood
Plain Forest, the Eastern Cross Timbers, and the Grand Prairie (see Yates and Ferring 1986:12–31
for a treatment of the environment of the upper Trinity basin). The project area is located
predominantly in the Grand Prairie, which is characterized by black, calcareous clay soils and by
a dominance of grasses, with shrubs and trees present along stream bottoms and flood plains. The
Grand Prairie is supported by the limestone and clay formations of the Pawpaw Formation, Weno
Limestone, Denton Clay, Fort Worth Limestone, Duck Creek Formation, Goodland Limestone,
and Walnut Clay with sands introduced in alluvial settings from the Paluxy Formation farther to
the west.
The entire upper Trinity River basin, including the project area, falls within Blair’s (1950:100–
102) Texan biotic province. Yates and Ferring (1986:22) point out that the Texan province is not
so much a distinct geographic unit as it is a giant ecotone in which species from both the east and
the west overlap at the limits of their ranges. Species composition and forest density vary greatly
between the Eastern Cross Timbers and the Grand Prairie. For prehistoric hunter/gatherers, the
potential for each zone to provide exploitable floral and faunal resources would have been
different from zone to zone.

FLORA AND FAUNA
The uplands of the Grand Prairie are host to small, widely scattered trees, but mature oaks and
cottonwood trees dominate the flood plain environments. Although tall grasses and forbs are
historically the principal vegetation on the prairie, urbanization and growth on the Northcentral
Texas prairie have vastly altered the flora and fauna from that which would have been available
to prehistoric populations. Many of the species growing on the prairie could have provided
nutritious nuts and fruits for prehistoric human and deer populations, but the density of these
foods was too low to have been a significant resource for human subsistence. The Grand Prairie
would have supported occasional herds of large mammals opportunistically hunted for protein
and fat, and larger mammals such as pronghorn and, later, bison may have browsed the prairie,
but in low numbers and with intermittent frequency. Complete listings of the faunal resources of
11

the upper Trinity River basin can be found elsewhere (Yates and Ferring 1986:12–31), but the
region as a whole was characterized by a high species diversity with the majority of these
resources in the bottomlands (Lynott 1977; Yates and Ferring 1986:22). The undergrowth of
berries and grasses would have provided a variety of microhabitats of exploitable floral and
faunal resources for early hunter/gatherers. In addition to the large numbers of mammals and
birds attracted to it, the riverine flood plain area was also a source of fish, turtle, waterfowl, and
shellfish for prehistoric peoples. Despite the intermittent presence of large mammal prairie
species such as buffalo and pronghorn, faunal remains recovered from archaeological contexts
indicate that deer was the primary source of meat protein throughout the prehistoric period (Yates
and Ferring 1986:27).

GEOLOGY
The underlying geology consists of Lower Cretaceous limestones, mudstone, and sandstones,
unconformably overlain by Quaternary-age fluvial, colluvial, and alluvial deposits. From south
to north, they are mapped as the Lower Cretaceous Pawpaw Formation, Weno Limestone, and
Denton Clay Undivided; Fort Worth Limestone and Duck Creek Formation undivided;
Pleistocene Fluviatile terrace deposits, and Holocene Alluvium (Bureau of Economic Geology
1972). Together, this series of fossiliferous, shallow-water marine limestones, claystones, shales,
and sandstones form a package no more than 120 m (394 ft) in thickness, with the bulk of the
sediment being limestone or limey shale. These units dip gently to the east into the East Texas
Embayment so the oldest units are exposed farther to the west and the youngest to the east except
where erosional downcutting has removed the younger units and so exposed the older units
sooner (Barnes 1988). Erosional sculpting of these units has produced very steep, 30–40-m-tall
(98–131 ft) bedrock scarps on both sides of the valley of the West Fork of the Trinity River.
During the extended period of erosion between the end of the Cretaceous and the late Quaternary,
the more erosionally resistant limestones of this sedimentary package probably served to inhibit
valley widening and formed topographic benches and knolls within the flood plain itself.
The active channel of the West Fork is very narrow in the area near the current project and is
deeply entrenched with very steep, almost vertical banks in many places; the surrounding flood
plain is located more than 9 m (29.5 ft) above the normal water level of the river. The West Fork
does appear to be highly sinuous in the vicinity of the study area and, despite the level of
alteration of the flood plain by historic construction activities and channelization, the flood plain
does have what appears to be a considerable number of distinct, preserved fluvial topographic
features such as abandoned channels or sloughs.

SOILS
Soils in the Tower 55 Surface Improvements project corridor area are mapped by the U.S. Soil
Conservation Service as (from south to north) those in the Sanger-Purves-Slidell association,
Aledo-Bolar-Sanger association, Frio-Trinity association, and Bastil-Silawa association (Ressel
1981). The Sanger-Purves-Slidell soils are nearly level and gently sloping, deep and shallow,
clayey soils found on uplands. Aledo-Bolar-Sanger soils are gently sloping to moderately steep,
very shallow to deep, loamy and clayey soils found on uplands. Frio-Trinity soils are nearly
level, deep, clayey soils on flood plains, in particular, the Trinity River flood plain (Ressel 1981).
The Bastil-Silawa association soils are nearly level to sloping, deep loamy soils (Ressel 1981).
12

Twenty-one soil units are mapped within the project area with 10 being either mixed with Urban
Land (areas that are 85 to 100 percent works and structures such as buildings, railroad yards,
airports, streets, sidewalks, and paved driveways (Ressel 1981:57) or Urban Land itself.
Moving from south to north, the non-Urban soils include Arents and Frio silty clay (Frio-Trinity
series) within the floodplain of the West Fork crossing. Although these soils would normally be
considered to be of higher probability for buried archaeology, the current project ends just below
the crossing of the river, and thus soils in these areas will not be disturbed at any significant
depths.

CHAPTER 3
CULTURAL SETTING

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Several major reports concerning the archaeology of the upper Trinity River basin (Peter and
McGregor 1988; Prikryl 1987, 1990; Yates and Ferring 1986) aptly summarize most of the
archaeological investigations within the upper Trinity River drainage and the cultural-historical
framework for the area. Although the combined efforts of professional and avocational
archaeologists have resulted in the recording of numerous sites, it is apparent that much research
remains to be done. As noted by McGregor (1988:27–29), much of the excavation efforts within
the upper Trinity River basin have focused on reservoir development, especially along the Elm
Fork of the Trinity River (Crook and Harris 1957, 1958, 1961; Skinner and Baird 1985; Skinner
et al. 1982) and the East Fork of the Trinity River (Dawson and Sullivan 1973; Lorrain and
Hoffrichter 1968; Lynott 1975; Ross 1966). Field school excavations by the University of Texas
at Arlington at the Northlake site on Grapevine Creek were also reported in the mid-1970s
(Morgan 1975). More recent investigations at Joe Pool Lake (Jurney et al. 1988; Peter and
McGregor 1988) and the test excavations of the River Bend site, 41TR68 (Peter et al. 1987), have
provided the initial assemblage data necessary for an understanding of the adaptations along the
West Fork of the Trinity River.
Cultural resources investigations conducted by Geo-Marine in Tarrant County in the 1990s were
limited in scope and results. The city of Arlington, Parks and Recreation Department, sponsored
a series of projects in southeastern Tarrant County (Hunt 1991; Hunt and Krapf 1996; Hunt and
Peter 1993a, 1993b, 1995, 1996a, 1996b; Hunt et al. 1994; Peter and Gaither 1990). Three small
projects also were conducted for the Fort Worth Zoo (Edwards 1991; Edwards and Peter 1991;
Peter et al. 1994). In 1996, surveys were undertaken at the Westside Recycling Facility in
western Tarrant County (Hunt et al. 1996) and at a housing complex in northern Tarrant County
(Krapf and Hunt 1996). In 1994, a cultural resources survey was undertaken by Geo-Marine for
the proposed replacement of the East First Street Bridge over the West Fork of the Trinity River.
That project included intensive pedestrian survey, backhoe investigations, and architectural
evaluations of standing structures. Site 41TR138, a prehistoric site with deposits to a depth of
4 m (13 ft), was tested and recommended as eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. Geo-Marine
conducted additional surveys and excavations in 1996 for the proposed Randol Mill Road
extension in Fort Worth, where site 41TR138 was again encountered. Geoarchaeological testing
15

suggested that the site could date as early as 4,650 years before present (yrs B.P.) and was of
significance to understanding early human adaptation in the area (Hunt and Peter 1997; Largent
1994).
During a 1997 survey, AR Consultants identified 41TR160, a buried prehistoric site. That project
consisted of a pedestrian survey with limited shovel tests and backhoe trenching conducted in the
route of anticipated pipeline construction (Skinner et al. 1997:Figure 3). Thirteen trenches were
excavated in select locations along the route to identify buried cultural and geological deposits.
Freshwater mussel shell was found eroding out of a sump and was also seen in the gully created
by an earlier pipeline excavation. Trenches were placed west of the earlier pipeline excavation to
locate the source of the mussel shell. Mussel shell, fire-cracked rock, and large mammal bone
were found below 1 m (3.3 ft) in the trenches. Skinner surmised that the site deposit could extend
to the west as far as 35 m (115 ft) to the sump edge, but no more than 4 m (13 ft) to the northeast
toward Trench 11 where no cultural materials were encountered. Bison and deer were
represented in the faunal collection. Two chert flakes, fire-cracked rock, animal bone, and mussel
shell were found at 1.22 m (4.0 ft) below surface. Fire-cracked limestone was found at 2.2 m
(7.2 ft) below the surface (Skinner et al. 1997).
In 1995, AR Consultants conducted cultural resources investigations along the West Fork in
Grand Prairie, Dallas County. Survey and shovel tests revealed no cultural resources, though
archaeological monitoring of construction was recommended (Trask et al. 1995). Two
investigations in the city of Arlington in Tarrant County reported cultural resources deposits on
the Metrovest Development property, bounded on the west by FM 157 and on the east by the
Trinity River (Ferring and Byers 1996; Shaunessy et al. 1994). An additional investigation
reported cultural resources just west of FM 157 at the Trinity River Linear Park in Arlington
(Ferring 1994). Though both properties had been heavily mined for river gravels, the studies
investigated a total of 10 historic and prehistoric deposits on the north, central, and west sides of
the parcel.
At the Trinity River Linear Park, Ferring (1994) reported four prehistoric sites (41TR143–
41TR146) buried in the flood plain. The sites consisted primarily of charcoal, shell, and bone,
with some fire-cracked rock and a few stone flakes. Cultural resources deposits were observed at
depths ranging from 0.25 m (0.8 ft) to over 5 m (16 ft) below surface. Ferring estimated the age
of the sites at between 750 and 3,000 yrs B.P. He concluded that despite low artifact density, the
sites were significant examples of occupation in aggrading fluvial environments.
Following the Linear Park project, two newly discovered sites on the Metrovest property (now
the Lakes of Arlington development area), 41TR142 and 41TR141, were investigated and
recorded. Previously recorded site 41TR128—most likely destroyed by gravel quarrying over the
past years—consisted of the historic-era Bird’s Fort and prehistoric components ranging from the
Late Paleo-Indian to Late Prehistoric periods (Shaunessy et al. 1994:11). Shaunessy et al. (1994)
concluded that the land immediately west of the West Fork, in addition to several other small,
undisturbed portions, had a high potential for yielding buried cultural resources and
recommended backhoe testing. Ferring and Byers (1996) also felt that the flood plains on the east
edge of the Metrovest property exhibited a high potential for preserving cultural remains.
Investigations of site 41TR142 to the west revealed an occupation surface, including artifacts,
fauna, and a hearth, at roughly 140 centimeters (cm; 55 inches [in]) below surface. Evidence
suggested primarily Late Archaic occupation, with some Late Prehistoric artifacts. Ferring
considered both site 41TR142 and the potential deposits in the narrow strip of undisturbed flood
16

plain along the West Fork to be significant in their preservation, complexity, and contributions to
paleoenvironmental reconstruction. He strongly encouraged the protection of these areas from
subsurface disturbance.
In 1998, Ellis (1998) surveyed a 3-mi (5-km) linear segment of the Metrovest property for the
development of a hike-and-bike trail that was developed with funds from the Texas Department
of Transportation (TxDOT). He encountered a scatter of buried archaeological deposits along the
3-mi (5-km) length of the riverbank throughout the Metrovest property that he inclusively
designated as site 41TR167. The observed cultural deposits ranged from roughly 50–350 cm
(20–138 in) below surface and contained mainly burned earth and shell lenses, with very sparse
bone, lithic artifacts, or burned rock. Essentially, the length of the site encompassed the entire
proposed hike-and-bike project area, even though relatively discrete clusters of cultural materials
were recorded. Ellis’s designation of the entire left-bank-stretch of river as a single site without
specific loci made it difficult to manage or interpret prehistoric behaviors within the expansive
site area. A radiocarbon date from a deposit roughly 1 m (3.3 ft) below the terrace tread surface
at the western end of the site indicated that the upper portion of the terrace was occupied 940–
1,160 years ago (Ellis 1998). Nevertheless, the significance of this date is overwhelmed by the
expanse of the site and the number of discrete occupations in the deposits.
In 1999, Geo-Marine conducted a survey that included backhoe excavations of an alluvial terrace
setting along the proposed TRA 72-inch sewer pipeline (Burson et al. 2000). Burson’s survey
resulted in the identification of a large, diffuse site, 41TR174, during the trenching of flood plain
deposits on the left bank of the West Fork of the Trinity River. Backhoe trenching demonstrated
that cultural deposits extended from approximately 80–200 cm (31.5–79 in) below surface,
located entirely within the ubiquitous Pilot Point alloformation and its associated West Fork
paleosol as defined by Ferring (1990, 1994; and Ferring and Byers 1996). The site yielded
quantities of burned rock, burned clay, charcoal, shell, and mammal and fish bone. A
radiocarbon assay of charcoal collected during the survey from approximately 130 cm (51 in)
below surface in survey Backhoe Trench 2 at site 41TR174 indicated that the cultural deposits
were 1,530–1,735 years old (Burson et al. 2000).
It was later discovered that site 41TR174 actually occurs within the northeastern part of Ellis’s 3­
mi-long (5-km) site 41TR167. Nevertheless, the portion of the site dated by Ellis for TxDOT is
located at the extreme opposite end of site 41TR167 and some 5 km (3 mi) southwest of site
41TR174. During 2003, Geo-Marine was contracted to conduct testing at 41TR174 prior to the
pipeline installation (Lintz et al. 2004). Testing included monitoring mechanical Gradall
excavations and opening manual excavation units around observed features or occupation zones.
The 2003 project resulted in the identification of three distinct buried cultural zones. Six hearth
and discard features were identified within one of these cultural zones designated as Analytical
Zone II. Despite the presence of these buried features, however, the absence of diagnostic
materials and the low quantities of archaeological materials were an indication that the
occupation being investigated was too sparse to be considered eligible for inclusion in the
National Register or for designation as a Texas SAL.
Geo-Marine conducted investigations in 2002 on the Riverside Oxbow Project through the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District (Huhnke and Wurtz 2004). That project included
shovel testing, backhoe trenching, and pedestrian survey of a portion of the West Fork flood plain
in Fort Worth. Those investigations resulted in the identification of 41TR198, an 11-ac site
dating to the Late Archaic or Late Prehistoric periods. Buried components of this site yielded
17

four hearth-like features containing bone, mussel shell, and chipped stone between 50 and 200 cm
(20 and 79 in) below surface. This site, although sparsely tested, exhibits a density of cultural
materials that exceeds many other previously identified sites in the region bearing similar
assemblages and retains great research potential. Geo-Marine began mitigation work at site
41TR198 in January 2009 and analyses are currently ongoing.
In 2005, Geo-Marine conducted test excavations at site 41TR170 prior to the construction of a
portion of the proposed State Highway 121 over the Clear Fork of the Trinity River (Lintz et al.
2008). A three-stage tactic was taken in testing the site: archaeological monitoring of the
mechanical excavation of 28 backhoe trenches with geomorphological studies conducted; manual
excavation of 10 test units; and mechanical scraping to target occupation surfaces and the
excavation of three blocks. A series of low-density, highly stratified occupations dating to the
Transitional Archaic period was encountered, and though site context, integrity, and preservation
was good, the paucity of remains was generally insufficient to provide adequate data to address
significant regional research questions. The site was recommended ineligible for inclusion in the
NRHP and no additional investigations recommended.
Projects in the immediate vicinity or within 1 km (0.6 mi) of this current project, according to the
Texas Historical Commission’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas included a 1991 TxDOT survey
for the widening of Beach Street from IH 820 to Long Avenue. No archaeological evidence was
noted (Weir 1991). TxDOT also conducted a small survey for the Hemphill Street extension and
construction in 1993; no sites were recorded (Weir 1993). In 2008, AR Consultants, Inc.,
conducted a reconnaissance survey for a bridge/culvert replacement at 28th Street over an
unnamed drainage. No sites or remains were identified (Davis 2008). Two other surveys were
noted on the atlas, but unfortunately, no additional information was available.
In 2005 and 2006, Geo-Marine (Osburn and Shanabrook 2005; Shanabrook et al. 2007) utilized
geoarchaeological coring as a preliminary assessment of the potential for cultural resources
within the Central City hydraulic mitigation areas associated with flood plain development along
the West Fork of the Trinity River in Fort Worth (Shanabrook et al. 2007). Approximately 291
noncontiguous acres divided into three discrete zones—hydraulic mitigation (Zone 3A), dam
construction (Zone 3B), and recreation (Zone 3C)—were examined through intensive coring.
These high-potential areas were in or adjacent to former meander belts of the West Fork. In
addition, three sites (41TR202 and 41TR203 in Zone 3C; 41TR204 in Zone 3A) were identified
during the coring investigations, and one previously recorded site (41TR160) was revisited in
Zone 3A. Each site was identified by cultural materials that were located stratigraphically within
or just below the West Fork Paleosol. Based on the apparent age of the sediments observed and
the location of the cultural materials observed below or in the basal portion of the West Fork
Paleosol, it seemed likely that the observed cultural materials date to the latter half of the
Holocene. None of the sites has received adequate investigations to date to determine NRHP
eligibility and all have been recommended for further work as the Central City project proceeds.
Finally, in 2009, Geo-Marine conducted the archaeological survey for the Tower 55 Reliever
project through downtown Fort Worth. This project entailed 11.37 mi (18.3 km) of rail, with a
right-of-way of 100–150 ft (30.5–46 m) wide, proposed for improvements to the rail
infrastructure that would improve movement of trains that converge on Tower 55, reducing train
congestion, and improving safety and security. Investigations found that the area had been too
affected by 100 years of use by the railroad, to contain in situ archaeological remains (Tinsley
and Forbes 2010)

CHRONOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK

Prehistoric Framework
Despite a long history of archaeological research in Northcentral Texas and the Southern Plains
(Jelks 1967; Krieger 1946, 1947; Prewitt 1981, 1985), as well as several later summary overviews
(Hofman et al. 1989; Prikryl 1990; Story et al. 1990; Vehik 1994), the chronological framework
for the upper Trinity River basin is not well developed. The available data allow the delineation
of only a generalized chronology. Investigations at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988)
provided evidence for a refinement of the chronology for the Late Prehistoric period, although the
overall regional applicability of the phases recognized there is still in some dispute. Prikryl
(1990) presented a chronological sequence of six periods, but he relied almost entirely on
diagnostic artifacts from surface contexts and comparisons to dated contexts distant from the
upper Trinity River basin. Despite this, chronological data from recent excavations at Ray
Roberts Lake and Lewisville Lake reportedly conform well to his suggested sequence (Ferring
and Yates 1997, 1998).
The prehistoric chronology presented here (Table 1) is taken from the introduction to the regional
preservation plan for the Prairie-Savanna Archeological Region, of which the upper Trinity River
basin is a part (Prikryl 1993). A brief summary of the adaptations and archaeological remains
associated with these periods is presented below.

Paleo-Indian Period
The Paleo-Indian period in Northcentral Texas (ca. 9950–6500 B.C.) generally includes those
remains of human presence that can be dated to the very late Pleistocene and the immediate postPleistocene periods (for reviews relevant to this period in Northcentral Texas, see Hofman 1989a;
Johnson 1989; Prikryl 1990; and Story 1990). Unfortunately, the Paleo-Indian occupation of the
upper Trinity River basin is known primarily through diagnostic projectile points from surface
collections or from stratigraphically mixed contexts (Meltzer 1987; Meltzer and Bever 1995).
The Field Ranch site (41CO10) along the upper Elm Fork is a prime example of typical site
19

contexts (Jensen 1968). Based on a sample of projectile points from surface sites, Prikryl
(1990) has suggested that the most common Paleo-Indian point types in this area are Plainview
and Dalton. Ferring and Yates (1997) suggest that these types date to about 9,500–10,000 B.C.,
based on cross dating with other regions. The suggested age for these types may correspond with
the onset of early Holocene alluviation in the Trinity River valley.
Clovis and Plainview points are commonly found along both Denton and Clear creeks in the
Cross Timbers, northwest of Dallas. Until recently, the Lewisville Lake site (41DN71) was the
best-known Paleo-Indian site within the region, containing large burned features interpreted as
hearths, and a low density of artifacts, including a Clovis point (Crook and Harris 1957, 1958,
1961). Although the original radiocarbon dates on the hearths suggested an anomalously early
age for Clovis points (ca. 37,000 yrs B.P.), later work by the Smithsonian Institution (Stanford
1981) appears to have resolved the controversy concerning the date of the occupation there. It
appears that the presence of naturally occurring lignite in these hearths, either as a fuel or as an
inadvertent inclusion, contaminated the radiocarbon samples. Consequently, the usually accepted
date of approximately 12,000–10,000 years ago (10,000–8000 B.C.) for Clovis period occupations
is probably a reasonable estimate for the first human occupation of Northcentral Texas.
A more spectacular exception to the generally limited data on Paleo-Indian sites in Northcentral
Texas is the deeply buried Clovis-age Aubrey site (41DN479), located on the Elm Fork of the
Trinity River north of Dallas (Ferring 1989, 2001). The discovery of this site, buried
approximately 7–8 m (23–26 ft) below the top of the Elm Fork flood plain just below the Lake
Ray Roberts dam, suggests that well-preserved Paleo-Indian sites in Northcentral Texas will only
be found by examining deeply stratified Holocene alluvium in modern flood plain situations.
Despite the lack of extensive data relating to the early Paleo-Indian period in Northcentral Texas,
some attempts have been made to generalize settlement mobility and intensity of site occupation,
drawing on what is known and on assumptions based on comparisons with other areas. For
instance, a number of researchers have seen evidence for a high degree of group mobility in the
broad distribution of Paleo-Indian artifacts over the landscape and in the variety of presumably
nonlocal lithic raw materials from which the artifacts were made (Meltzer and Smith 1986; Shafer
1977; Story 1990:177). Likewise, the well-documented exploitation of megafauna by PaleoIndians in the western United States, coupled with the known presence of similar animals in
Northcentral Texas between 11,000 and 9,000 years ago (see Slaughter and Hoover 1963), has
resulted in the popular (and logical) conclusion that big-game hunting was part of the PaleoIndian subsistence strategy in Northcentral Texas. However, the recent important excavations at
the Aubrey site have indicated that subsistence efforts did not focus on big-game animals alone.
Rather, the entire range of prairie and forest species was used by the occupants of the site,
including bison, deer, rabbits, squirrels, fish, and abundant turtle (Ferring 1989; Ferring and Yates
1997). Interestingly, although mammoth remains are present, mammoth exploitation has not
been substantiated (Ferring and Yates 1997). Whether this pattern of a more generalized foraging
subsistence system is characteristic of Clovis adaptations on the fringes of the Eastern Woodlands
and the focus on now extinct, big-game species is more characteristic of a Plains adaptation
remains to be documented; but Ferring and Yates (1997:5) suggest that, in general, the Clovis
people probably employed “very flexible adaptive strategies.”

20

Archaic Period
The Archaic period in Northcentral Texas is tentatively dated between 6500 B.C. and A.D. 700.
As is true for many areas, a threefold division of the Archaic period, consisting of early, middle,
and late subdivisions, has been applied in Northcentral Texas (Prikryl 1990, 1993). Thus, the
Early Archaic has been dated from 6500 to 4000 B.C., the Middle Archaic from 4000 to
1500 B.C., and the Late Archaic from 1500 B.C. to A.D. 700. Relatively recent overviews that
cover the Archaic period in this portion of Texas include Hofman (1989a), Prikryl (1990), and
Story (1985, 1990). Archaic remains are usually found in upland settings and are frequently
mixed with later material. In fact, the initial treatment of the Archaic period in Northcentral
Texas (Crook and Harris 1952, 1954), which defined the Carrollton and Elam foci, was based
upon materials from such mixed terrace contexts. Consequently, these time-space constructs are
no longer recognized as being acceptable for this area of Texas (Peter and McGregor 1988;
Prikryl 1990; Yates and Ferring 1986). General trends that have been proposed as characterizing
the Archaic period in Northcentral Texas include an increasing complexity of settlement systems,
increasing population size and density, decreasing mobility, and the development of distinct
group territories (Prikryl 1990; Story 1985:52).
During the Early Archaic (ca. 6500–4000 B.C.), in general, the occurrence of small and widely
distributed sites has been suggested to reflect high group mobility within large and poorly defined
territories, with a generalized hunting and gathering economy (Meltzer and Smith 1986; Story
1985:35, 39). Unfortunately, Early Archaic occupations in Northcentral Texas are poorly
documented, and no sites with isolatable Early Archaic components in this area are known
(Prikryl 1990). Based on surface collections, Prikryl (1990) hypothesizes a generalized hunting­
and-gathering economy during this period, with high group mobility, a lack of regionalization,
and “little in the way of recognized territorial boundaries” (Prikryl 1990:71). Projectile point
forms that may be associated with the Early Archaic in Northcentral Texas include Early Split
Stemmed and possibly Angostura (Prikryl 1990; Story 1990:Figure 31). In comparison to the
Early Archaic, the Middle Archaic period in Northcentral Texas (4000–1500 B.C.) is even less
well known. Fewer sites are known with Middle Archaic components than for any other period,
but the few surface collections available suggest the beginnings of regional cultural differences
by the end of the period (Prikryl 1990). Diagnostic dart points that may be associated with the
Middle Archaic include the Basal Notched group (which includes Calf Creek, Bell, and Andice),
Wells, Dawson, Carrollton, and Bulverde (Prikryl 1990; Story 1990:Figure 31). An intact Middle
Archaic component was identified at the Calvert site (41DN102) at Lake Ray Roberts by Ferring
and Yates (1997) and is summarized as follows:
Hearths, a burial, an unmixed assemblage of artifacts and fauna provide new evidence of adaptations to
a drier Middle Holocene landscape. Artifact types are similar to those from adjacent regions (Story
1990) suggesting broad cultural interactions. The foraging economy emphasized procurement of small
game and deer. It is assumed that these people were quite mobile, as repeated occupations of the site
during the [Middle Archaic] period are evident [Ferring and Yates 1997:305].

Population density may have reached a peak during the Late Archaic period (ca. 1500 B.C.–A.D.
700) in Northcentral Texas. Evidence for this can be found in an apparent increase in the number
of Late Archaic sites, a greater distribution of sites over the landscape, and evidence of
decreasing group mobility (Prikryl 1990). At the same time, interregional contact may have
diminished. If greater spatial dispersal of sites is not a result of sampling error due to unequal
destruction or burial of earlier sites, it may reflect an economic system making increasing use of
21

all available floral and faunal resources. Throughout Northcentral Texas, Late Archaic period
occupation sites are relatively common in the uplands, and a relatively large number of buried
sites are also known from the Trinity River flood plain (Ferring 1990:51). Dart points that may
be diagnostic of the Late Archaic include Castroville, Marshall, Edgewood, Ellis, Trinity,
Palmillas, Yarbrough, Dallas, Godley, Elam, and Gary (Prikryl 1990; Story 1990:Figure 31).
Investigations at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988) and Lake Ray Roberts (Ferring and
Yates 1997) indicate that remains of the Late Archaic period are characterized by assemblages
apparently left by small bands of foraging hunters and gatherers who occupied a locality for a
limited time period and then moved to another locality. These sites were apparently reoccupied
numerous times on a seasonal basis. Faunal remains indicate that Late Archaic populations
exploited a mix of prairie, forest, and riparian species, with white-tailed deer, rabbit, turtle, and
mussel being primary food resources (Ferring and Yates 1997:6). In summarizing the results of
investigations at a number of Late Archaic sites at Lake Ray Roberts, Ferring and Yates
(1997:305) state:
The most substantial occupations of the project area took place in the later part (post-3,000 yr B.P.) of
the [Late Archaic] period. This is clearly a broad regional trend . . . although poor site exposure limits
our understanding of earlier periods. Late Archaic sites here uniformly register mobile foragers that
exploited all habitats available to them. Residential mobility . . . is implied. Repeated occupations at
multiple sites were characterized by use of rock-lined and unlined hearths. On stable surfaces these are
recorded as rock middens. In aggrading environments, discrete hearth construction events are clear.
Import and curation of chert tools is evident, and contrasts with core-biface curation in the [Middle
Archaic] period. Chert was preferentially used for straight, expanding and corner-notched points,
while local raw materials were reduced on-site and dominate the contracting-stemmed forms. Despite
quite good resource availability, dietary stress is recorded from skeletal and dental analyses. . . .

The documentation of large pits associated with Late Archaic period sites in the Richland Creek
and Chambers Creek drainages (Bruseth and Martin 1987) also suggests that important
sociopolitical changes may have been occurring during this time period. Unfortunately, the
significance of these pits remains an enigma despite their excellent documentation.

Late Prehistoric Period
The beginning of what is called the Late Prehistoric period (ca. A.D. 700–1700) in the upper
Trinity River basin is marked by the initial appearance of arrow points. The A.D. 700 date for the
start of this period is based upon dated contexts for similar material in the Brazos River drainage
to the west. Both Lynott (1977) and Prikryl (1990) have proposed that the Late Prehistoric period
be divided into an early and a late phase, with the early phase reflecting a continuation of the
foraging subsistence system of the preceding Late Archaic period and the late phase reflecting
Southern Plains influences. In this view, the early phase dates between A.D. 700 and 1200 and is
characterized by sand- and grog-tempered ceramics and Scallorn, Steiner, Catahoula, and Alba
arrow points (Lynott 1977; Prikryl 1990). The late phase dates from A.D. 1200 to 1700 and is
associated with the appearance of shell-tempered Nocona Plain ceramics, various unstemmed
triangular points (e.g., Maud, Fresno, Harrell, and Washita), and stemmed Perdiz points (Lynott
1977; Prikryl 1990). Evidence of horticulture and bison procurement also appears in sites of this
period (Harris and Harris 1970; Morris and Morris 1970).

22

As a result of intensive excavations at the Cobb-Pool site (41DL148) at Joe Pool Lake, Peter and
McGregor (1988) proposed a reformulation of the Late Prehistoric period. The Cobb-Pool site
yielded house structures, roasting pits, Alba points, grog-tempered ceramics, and charred corn
cupules. Radiocarbon dates from several features indicate the site was occupied during the late
twelfth or early thirteenth century. Present evidence suggests that the site does not represent an
intrusive Caddoan occupation; consequently, a significant adaptive change appears to have
occurred, in at least some areas, during a middle phase of the Late Prehistoric period. It is also
likely that ceramics were not introduced to the region before this time.
In regard to the Late Prehistoric components investigated at Lake Ray Roberts, Ferring and Yates
(1997:305) summarize the results of that research as follows:
There are no woodland-like sites in north-central Texas, suggesting that Plains Woodland
influence/contact did not characterize the transition to the Late Prehistoric period. No ceramics were
found with [Late Prehistoric I] assemblages, which have Scallorn, Alba and small Gary points. These
appear to be short-term occupations that took place under conditions of reduced precipitation
compared to the Late Archaic. Except for the replacement of darts with bow-arrow weaponry, these
occupations are essentially similar to the Late Archaic. Regional exchange of technological
information, rather than environmental change, probably is the factor behind the [Late Archaic] to
[Late Prehistoric] shift.
Late Prehistoric II occupations are characterized by multiple, short-term use of probably logistic sites
that lack ceramics and architecture. The architectural remains at 41DN102 are the only ones in the
project area. At best, this was a small hamlet, occupied ca. 500–650 yr B.P. No evidence of
horticulture was recovered, and the [Late Prehistoric II] faunas indicate a foraging strategy that
emphasized deer procurement and occasionally bison as well. Transport and curation of chert raw
materials was about as frequent as in the [Late Archaic], and long-distance raw material acquisition
(e.g., Edwards, Alibates) is not evidenced. Ceramic traditions are dominated by locally produced
shell-tempered wares, which by this time were being produced in the Southern Plains region generally.
As recorded by previous synthesis (Story 1990), little if any interaction with the Caddoan area is
indicated. Thus, the Ray Roberts prehistoric data suggest that regional traditions emerged at the end of
the [Late Prehistoric] period largely independent of the Plains or East Texas Woodlands.

More recently, McGregor (personal communication 1999 and 2010) has argued strongly for a
“middle subperiod” of the Late Prehistoric that he dates between A.D. 1000 and 1350. He
believes that arrow points with straight or rectangular stems are most diagnostic of this period and
identifies three sites or site areas with relatively clean (or minimally mixed) components of this
middle subperiod—the Cobb-Pool site, Area B at the McDonald site (41HI105) on Hackberry
Creek in the middle Brazos River drainage, and Area F at the Haley’s Point site (34MA15) on the
Red River (Brown et al. 1987; Peter and McGregor 1988; Rohn 1998). McGregor also notes that
maize is common at Haley’s Point, as it is at Cobb-Pool, and suggests that these sites are
representative of a relatively short-lived, region-wide subsistence pattern involving a partial
dependence on agriculture during this middle subperiod (McGregor, personal communication
1999 and 2010).
Although no one can dispute the presence of domesticates at Cobb-Pool and Haley’s Point, the
lack of any evidence for Late Prehistoric agriculture at Ray Roberts Lake and Lewisville Lake
leaves open the question of how extensive and how early this agricultural pattern was. Maize
agriculture is known to have been present at Late Prehistoric sites along the East Fork, based on
the recovery of maize from the Hogge Bridge, Butler Hole, and Campbell’s Hole sites earlier
during this century (Stephenson 1952:305), but the dating of these remains has always been
23

uncertain (Prikryl 1990:77). As late as 1993, the available data allowed Fritz (1993:241) to state
that, apart from Cobb-Pool, Late Prehistoric sites in Northcentral Texas seem to show a
generalized adaptation in which the most important plant foods were nuts, wild seeds, fruits, and
the problematic, possible tuber that might be a species of Psoralea. Since then, several small
projects have shed additional light on the introduction of maize horticulture into Northcentral
Texas. The Harbor Pointe site (41DL369), located on Rowlett Creek (a tributary of the East Fork
of the Trinity River), yielded remains of at least four individuals dated by AMS analysis of bone
collagen to cal A.D. 1010 (1035) 1165. No pottery was recovered with these remains, although
shell beads and a shell gorget were present, and a stable carbon isotope ratio of -21.6 ‰ indicates
that the group’s diet contained little or no maize (Cliff et al. 1996; cf. Lynott et al. 1986:Figure 2).
More recently, a disturbed burial (41DL373), located on Spring Creek (a tributary of Rowlett
Creek), was dated by AMS analysis of bone collagen to cal. A.D. 1155 (1220) 1275, with a stable
carbon isotope ratio of -17.8 ‰ (Peter and Clow 1999). This value is similar to stable carbon
isotope values believed to represent the initial introduction of maize agriculture in New York
around A.D. 1000 (van der Merwe and Vogel 1977) and is comparable to values of -18.0 ‰ to ­
20.0 ‰ for initial maize-consuming Caddo populations in Arkansas (Rose and Hoffman 1989).
Assuming that (1) these carbon isotope ratios directly reflect changes in the C4 plant contribution
to the human diet (see Herz 1990 for a discussion of other possibilities), and (2) these burials are
representative of more regional changes in prehistoric dietary patterns, then maize horticulture
may have been introduced into Northcentral Texas around A.D. 1200.

Historic Indian Period
Within Northcentral Texas, the time from A.D. 1700 to 1850 has been designated the Historic
Indian period (Prikryl 1993). Prior to the founding of New Mexico in 1598, the European
presence in the Southwest and on the Southern Plains was sporadic at best (Coronado in 1540–
1541, the Rodriguez-Chamuscado party in 1581, Espejo in 1582–1583, etc.). After 1598, Spanish
influence was never absent from the Southern Plains, although actual contact with Europeans
continued to be limited and there are only brief records of journeys into or through the area
(Hofman 1989b; John 1975). Despite this, it was not until the beginning of the nineteenth century
that the physical presence of Europeans on the Southern Plains became commonplace. This was
the result of increasingly peaceful relations between the Spanish in Texas and the Plains Indians
to the north, and the acquisition of Louisiana by the United States in 1803. Prior to about 1725–
1750, Apachean groups appear to have dominated the western portion of the Southern Plains,
known as the High Plains. After this time, the Comanche and Kiowa increasingly controlled the
area. On the eastern portion of the Southern Plains, within the area now known as the Lower
Plains and Northcentral Texas, the Wichita tribes became dominant (Bell et al. 1967; Hofman
1989b:91).
Unfortunately, since good historical documentation is very sparse for the upper Trinity River
basin during the early historic period, it is not clear which specific aboriginal groups were
residing in the Dallas-Fort Worth area at the beginning of this period. What is clear is that the
early historic period in Northcentral Texas was a time of population fluctuation, movement, and
amalgamation (see Newcomb 1993). Available data suggest that many, if not all, of the
aboriginal occupants of the eastern margin of the Great Plains, including Northcentral Texas,
were Caddoan language speakers, from the Arikara in the north to the Wichita and Kichai in the
south. In this light, it is worth noting that it has also been suggested that the Socoatino,
encountered by the survivors of the de Soto expedition in the sixteenth century, were Caddoan
24

speakers and were the same as the Canohatino, identified by the French in the latter part of the
seventeenth century, apparently located at that time “on the Blackland Prairies between the
Guadalupe and Trinity rivers to the east of present-day San Antonio, Austin, and Waco”
(Newcomb 1993:24). If the prehistoric occupants of the eastern margin of the plains in Texas
were indeed Caddoan speakers, it would explain how they were absorbed very early by other
Caddoan-speaking groups (such as the Yojuane, Kichai, Tawakoni, Taovaya, Iscani, and Wichita
proper) who arrived in Northcentral Texas in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries.
Most of these groups, in turn, amalgamated to form the historic Wichita Tribe. However, some
were probably absorbed by the united Caddo Tribes, and some may even have joined
amalgamations of a variety of groups, such as the Tonkawa, during the late eighteenth and early
nineteenth centuries.
The term Wichita is commonly used to refer to a group of linguistically related tribes, including
the Wichita, Taovaya, Tawakoni, Iscani, Waco, and Kichai. Many of these groups apparently
entered the Southern Plains in the seventeenth century, probably from Kansas and southern
Nebraska, to escape the hostilities of the Osage (Webb and Carroll 1952:2:904). The Wichita
were true Plains Villagers, with an economy that was jointly dependent upon agriculture and
bison hunting. They occupied permanent villages of beehive-shaped, grass houses, from which
they conducted seminomadic bison hunts. In 1719, their villages were located along the Arkansas
River in northern Oklahoma (Hofman 1989b:95). By 1750, they had moved some of their
villages to southern Oklahoma along the Red River. Others were located on the upper end of the
Sabine and Neches rivers in Texas and subsequently on the middle Trinity and upper Brazos
rivers. In 1772, the year they concluded a nominal peace with the Spanish, one of their villages
was on the Salt Fork of the Brazos, on the Lower Plains west of Dallas-Fort Worth (John
1975:Map 3; Webb and Carroll 1952:2:705). Wichita groups were included in treaties made with
the Republic of Texas in 1843 and with the United States in 1837 and 1856 (Webb and Carroll
1952:2:709). In Texas, they continued to live between the upper Brazos and Trinity rivers until
1855. In that year, the Tawakoni and Waco were placed on the Brazos Indian Reservation, south
of Fort Belknap, in company with a number of other Native American remnant groups (Smith
1996; Webb and Carroll 1952:1:212, 2:905). Subsequently, as a result of increasing animosity
from white settlers, they were removed to Indian Territory in 1859 (Smith 1996; Webb and
Carroll 1952:1:210). The remnants of the Wichita moved to Kansas during the Civil War, but
returned to Oklahoma after the war to settle permanently near present-day Anadarko (Hofman
1989b:95).
Archaeological remains that can be associated with these early historic groups are rare compared
to the remains of earlier periods. Within the upper Trinity River basin, little evidence of these
historic Indian groups has been found, with the exception of a few Native American sites with
European items (Sollberger 1953).

Historic Occupation/Utilization
The first presence of Europeans in Northcentral Texas may have been in 1542, when the remnants
of the Hernando de Soto expedition, led by Luís de Moscoso de Alvarado, entered modern Texas
in an effort to find a land route to New Spain. Some researchers believe that the expedition
crossed Northcentral Texas (Lebo and Brown 1990:61), although others place the route much
farther to the east and south (Bruseth and Kenmotsu 1991; Chipman 1992; Hudson 1986;
Schambach 1989; Weber 1992). A consistent European presence in the region did not occur until
the early 1700s, when French traders from Louisiana began to move west along the Red River.
25

The Spanish considered this French incursion to be a threat to the security of New Spain, and they
responded by redoubling efforts to counterbalance the French influence with the Native
Americans in East and Northcentral Texas. These efforts continued until 1763, when France
ceded Louisiana to Spain under the Treaty of Paris. This reduced the perceived threat to the
security of New Spain and resulted in a reduction in Spanish investment in eastern and northern
Texas. More important, from the Native American viewpoint, was the severe military defeat
inflicted on the Spanish by Wichita and allied tribes at Spanish Fort on the Red River in 1758. It
has been argued that this defeat put an end to Spanish military and missionary expansion to the
north (Weddle 1964, 1965).
The first Euro-Americans to settle in the region were primarily from Arkansas Territory. The
settlement of Bird’s Fort, established in 1840, was the first permanent settlement in the DallasFort Worth area and was established by Captain Jonathan Bird. Located along the West Fork of
the Trinity River in present-day Arlington, the fort consisted of a blockhouse and several log
buildings and served mostly as a trading station. Additional families joined the initial occupants
of the fort in the fall of 1841, but the fort was abandoned by the spring of 1842. Bird’s Fort was
not used again until the summer of 1843 when Sam Houston, President of the Republic of Texas,
attempted to meet with the Indian tribes and establish a peace treaty. The treaty was signed on
September 29, 1843, with representatives of the Delaware, Chickasaw, Waco, Keechi, Caddo,
Ionic, Biloxi, and Cherokee present (Garrett 1972; Sergeant 1953). The settlement of Birdville,
located between Little Fossil Creek and Big Fossil Creek, was founded in 1848 12 miles to the
southeast soon after Bird’s Fort was abandoned.
Meanwhile, in 1841, the Republic of Texas had granted a large portion of land to the Texas
Emigration and Land Company (TELC), which hoped to encourage settlement of Northcentral
Texas. The grants distributed to settlers by the TELC became known collectively as the Peters
Colony. The majority of the Peters Colony settlers held property north of Dallas, which they held
in that name until 1852 when disputes between the TELC and the settlers caused some of the
settlers to band together to defend their title to the land they had settled.
In 1845, a trading post was established at Marrow Bone Springs (later named Mary Le Bone
Springs) along Johnson Creek (formerly called Mill Creek). Although Carol Werdman’s
(1969:10) account of its location suggests either a Rush Creek or Johnson Creek location, an 1872
map of Texas (Petermann 1872) places Marrow Bone Springs on Johnson Creek. Colonel
Middleton Tate Johnson and a company of Texas Rangers also established their headquarters at
Marrow Bone Springs in 1847. Two years later Colonel Johnson received a land grant for his
services, and he established a plantation near Marrow Bone Springs. The community that grew
around the colonel’s plantation came to be known as Johnson Station.
On June 6, 1849, the United States Army established Camp Worth on the bluffs overlooking the
Trinity River, near present day Samuels Avenue. Major Ripley Arnold selected the site of the
installation, which served as a post along the army’s frontier defense line. The fort’s location
atop a high bluff provided an unobstructed view of the surrounding area, and an increased
measure of security as a result (Selcer 2004:4). Despite undergoing a change in name from
“Camp Worth” to “Fort Worth” in November 1849, the installation at Fort Worth was not a
walled or substantially fortified structure as the name may imply. Soldiers did construct
buildings within the installation, however. In 1853 when the army’s frontier defense line shifted
west, the army withdrew its troops from Fort Worth and turned the installation over to a
population of less than 100 civilian settlers who moved into the abandoned structures and adapted
them for their own use (Selcer 2004:7–9).
26

In the early days of Fort Worth, despite the fact that the military installation had been abandoned
in 1853, the population of the frontier town continued to grow, due to the prevalence of water and
fertile land. An important step in connecting the town to a larger transportation network was the
commencement of regular stage service from Fort Belknap, northwest of Fort Worth near presentday Newcastle, and Dallas in 1857 (Selcer 2004:10–11). The first stage line to connect with Fort
Worth was the United States Mail Stage Line in 1856, and in 1858, Fort Worth became an
overnight rest stop on the Fort Worth-Jacksboro Stage Line, which connected to the Butterfield
Overland Stage that linked St. Louis to the West Coast (Sanders 1986:24; Schmelzer 1985). By
1860, Fort Worth’s population had grown to 450 (Roark 1991:5). In the wake of its being voted
as the county seat in 1860, settlement increased and spread from the town center (just west of the
present-day location of the Tarrant County Courthouse) to the south and northeast along the
bluffs.
Fort Worth’s population decreased significantly during the Civil War. By 1865, the population
had been reduced by nearly half from 1860 (Roark 1991:5; Sanders 1986:29). Development of
the town was stagnant during this time, but, unlike many former Confederate strongholds, Fort
Worth began to reshape its economy and identity relatively quickly after the Civil War. After the
war, prosperity returned to Fort Worth with the beginning of cattle drives through the area.
Following the war’s end, a great demand for Texas beef developed in northern states, as the war
had depleted the livestock population in that region (Campbell 2003:297). In April 1866, the first
contract cattle drive from South Texas to Missouri passed through Fort Worth. The town served
as a final stopover for the cattle drives heading from South Texas to shipping depots in Oklahoma
and Kansas along the Eastern Trail. The capital that cowboys brought to Fort Worth greatly
aided the city’s economic recovery.
The 1870s were a time of important developments in Fort Worth. In 1870, streets were surveyed
southward from Courthouse Square and assigned numbers from First Street to Tenth Street. On
February 17, 1873, the state legislature signed Fort Worth’s charter of incorporation, and the
town formally became a city with an area of approximately 4 square miles (Selcer 2004:19). In
response to its incorporation and in anticipation of the railroad’s imminent arrival, Fort Worth
again enjoyed a population and economic boom in the early 1870s with the population rising to
5,000 (Federal Writers’ Project, Writers’ Program [Texas] 1940:260).
Because the Trinity River created a natural barrier to early development to the north of
downtown, the southern and southeastern sections of the city developed relatively early in the
city’s history, beginning roughly concurrent with Fort Worth’s incorporation in 1873 (Knight
1990:198). The city’s southern boundary in 1873 included the stretch of Terrell Avenue between
Eighth Avenue to the west and Virginia Avenue to the east (Historic Preservation Council for
Tarrant County [HPCTC] 1986:2), thus crossing the Tower 55 APE. The line did not necessarily
reflect the extent of the city’s development, but rather the potential city officials hoped would be
realized with the arrival of the railroad (HPCTC 1986:2). The financial crisis of 1873 delayed
railroad construction and put boom hopes on hold for a few years, but the city rebounded, both
economically and population-wise, when railroad plans were finalized.

27

THE RAILROAD BUILT ENVIRONMENT AND IMPACT ON THE FORT WORTH
LANDSCAPE
To move railroad cars from one point to another, railroads require the most obvious of
resources—a railroad roadway, which includes ground modifications, a railroad bed, tracks,
ballast, and ditches; but they also rely on structures (such as bridges, culverts, and trestles) and a
host of buildings for their operations (Schmidt et al. n.d.:Section F:185). Historically, railroad
yards, devoted to the maintenance, construction, and servicing of railroad cars and equipment,
included additional tracks, roundhouses, machine shops, warehouses, yard offices, power houses,
coaling stations, ash pits, ice houses, storage buildings, commercial buildings, signals, and
interlocking towers. Railroad stations, constructed for the purpose of loading and unloading
passengers and goods, included terminals, depots, platforms, warehouses, coal chutes, light
signals, interlocking towers, and commercial buildings.
Fort Worth maps drawn by D.D. Morse in 1876 and Henry Wellge in 1886 and 1891 depict the
evolution of the built environment in the decades during the railroad boom. The Morse map, with
a view looking southeast, shows the concentration of buildings in the central business district and
along the bluffs, with limited development beyond Pecan and 9th streets. Despite the fact that the
Texas and Pacific Railway (T&P) did not arrive until July 1876, Morse’s map, drawn in April of
that year, depicts a T&P train chugging into town along 16th Street, with a handful of buildings
flanking the tracks1 (Figure 5).
Wellge rotated the view for his 1886 and 1891 maps so that they look southwest, illustrating the
extensive industrial development along the tracks, the arrival of additional rail lines, and the
resultant housing boom. The 1886 map features an inset with a version of the famed “Tarantula”
map depicting Fort Worth at the center with rail lines extending in all directions like a spider’s
legs. Illustrated in the final 1891 Wellge map, neighborhood development south of the T&P line
is significant: houses, churches, and a few commercial enterprises are depicted as far south as
Leuda Street. The 1891 bird’s-eye view shows expanded rail lines and yards paralleling Jones
Street, larger industrial buildings along the T&P line south of downtown, and increased
residential density in the south and near-southeast neighborhoods (Figure 6).
In addition to the railroad roadway, the railroad built environment to emerge in Fort Worth during
the late nineteenth century and first half of the twentieth century included buildings and structures
associated with railroad yards, railroad stations, and grade separation structures. As historic maps
indicate, railroad buildings and structures were concentrated along the south end of downtown at
Main and Front (now Lancaster Avenue) streets and on the east side of downtown along Jones
Street. In 1873, city officials donated 300 acres of land to T&P for a railroad reservation. This
area was located south of the present-day convention center where the Fort Worth Water Gardens
now stand. The T&P reservation at Main Street and Lancaster Avenue eventually included a
freight station, roundhouse, machine shops, and a passenger depot. Construction of the T&P
passenger depot in 1900 was spurred by the estimated 50 passenger trains traveling through Fort

1

Although the map appears to be several months ahead of its time with the illustration of the train, it is likely that the
train’s imminent arrival was a well-known fact. By adding the train, Morse’s map was relevant over the next several
years; had he omitted it, the map would have been relevant for only three months from the time of publication.
Morse’s map is valuable in that it establishes a record of the city’s built environment and cultural landscape right at the
beginning of the railroad boom. In comparing Morse’s map to Wellge’s 1886 and 1891 maps, changes in the cultural
landscape and built environment are readily apparent.

Worth every day by the turn of the twentieth century. The depot was a monumental red brick
facility, which sadly, burned in 1904, but was promptly restored. The T&P roundhouse was also
destroyed by a fire in 1909. T&P officials viewed the disaster as an opportunity to replace the
older roundhouse, and work was begun on building a new one at the same location before the end
of the year (Cashion 2006:24, 37; Fort Worth Architecture n.d.; Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps
[Sanborn Maps] 1910–1911).
The T&P was not the only rail company in need of expanded facilities by the turn of the twentieth
century. In 1899, the Gulf, Colorado, and Santa Fe Railway Company (GC&SF) built a large red
brick and limestone terminal building at 14th and Jones streets. The building was later expanded
in 1931 to include a new freight building. Just north of the GC&SF facility, near 9th and Jones,
were the Fort Worth and Denver City Railway (FW&DC) roundhouse, railroad shops and freight
house. The area was surrounded by warehouses and shotgun houses (Sanborn Maps 1910–1911).

Perspective Map of Fort Worth, Tex., 1891, by Henry Wellge

Figure 6. Perspective Map of Fort Worth, Tex., 1891, by Henry Wellge, looking southwest (source:
www.birdseyeviews.org).

The primary intersection for rail lines traveling along the north–south rail corridor and those
traveling along the east–west corridor through Fort Worth was, and continues to be, a point
immediately southeast of downtown Fort Worth approximately three blocks east of the
intersection of Vickery Boulevard and South Main Street. The intersection of individual rail lines
at right angles is known as an interlocker. Prior to the widespread use of remotely controlled
switch operation in the railroad industry, railroads employed individuals to monitor interlockers
and control the flow of rail traffic through the intersection. In order to provide better visibility to
those monitoring interlockers, multistory structures known as signal towers or interlocker towers,
were constructed near the interlockers (Berg 1893). The towers provided not only visibility to
operators, but also housed levers used to operate switches that controlled the train traffic through
the interlocker.
Legislation regulating the construction and operation of interlockers was first introduced in Texas
in 1901. At that time, the state legislature passed an act requiring railroad companies to install
interlockers and other safety devices approved by the Railroad Commission of Texas within one
year of the act’s passing. In 1902, the Railroad Commission established regulations requiring a
formal process for the commission to review and approve plans submitted by each railroad
company for the construction of interlocking plants (History of Interlocking Towers in Texas
2005). Often the interlocking controls were housed in a shelter, but plans submitted to the
Railroad Commission did not provide specifications for the building itself; rather, the plans
focused on the layout and operation of tracks, signals, and switches controlled by the interlocking
mechanism, though footprints of the buildings are present on many plans (Railroad Commission
of Texas n.d.). The interlocker tower constructed southeast of downtown Fort Worth, known as
Tower 55, was completed in 1904. Oriented lengthwise from west to east, the tower had a hipped
roof and rectangular footprint (Railroad Commission of Texas n.d.).
30

Grade separation structures were also a necessary component to rail travel. Within the project
area, wood, masonry, steel truss, and concrete bridges are all present. The earliest of the bridges
within the APE is a single-span bridge with stone abutments at Cold Springs Road, constructed in
1897 (Resource 37). Two bridges over Lancaster Avenue also have stone abutments, with
concrete wing walls modified sometime after the original construction (Resources 10 and 11).
These bridges, both of which were constructed prior to 1910, have riveted steel piers. Located at
IH 35W, below Spur 280, is a 1926 bridge with stepped stone wing walls, colloquially referred to
as the “Hole-in-the-Wall” (Resource 21). Each of these bridges is located on the same north–
south orientation and at one time carried either T&P tracks, GC&SF tracks, FW&DC tracks, or a
combination of railroads.
A steel truss bridge, a type that first became popular in the late nineteenth century, is also
represented in the project APE. East of Cold Springs Road, south of Delga Street is Resource
38—a skewed Warren truss bridge. Originally constructed in 1924, the current through-plate
girder was placed on the existing abutments in 1924. The truss span was fabricated and added in
1953 when the bridge was extended. The bridge originally carried a T&P line over the Chicago,
Rock Island, & Texas (CRI&T), and now carries tracks owned by UPRR. Just north of Resource
38 is a wooden pile trestle bridge (Resource 39) constructed in 1929 over a small creek east of
Samuels Avenue at NE 11th Street. Wooden pile trestle bridges were a relatively inexpensive
form of bridge construction that typically did not require the services of an engineer or bridgebuilding firm (Solomon 2007:59).
By the late 1920s, rail traffic through Fort Worth had increased to the point that larger facilities
and infrastructure were required to accommodate the continuously increasing volume of both
passenger and freight traffic through the city. In 1928, John L. Lancaster, President of T&P,
together with the Fort Worth City Council and Mayor William Bryce initiated a joint effort to
expand T&P facilities and make improvements to existing rail and vehicular traffic infrastructure
where expanded sections of rail were needed. T&P financed the construction of the Lancaster
Yards (now Davidson Yards), a new terminal, and warehouse facilities located near the
intersection of South Hulen Street and West Vickery Boulevard (Fort Worth Architecture n.d.).
While T&P was negotiating the construction of Lancaster Yards, the company also embarked on
the construction of two monumental buildings along Lancaster Avenue adjacent to the rail
company's original rail yard. The T&P complex, designed by architect Wyatt C. Hedrick,
consists of a 13-story passenger terminal and a freight warehouse building. Both buildings were
designed in the Zig Zag Moderne Art Deco style. The terminal, which also contained offices,
was noted for its lobby, which included marble floors and metal in-laid panel ceilings. The
terminal complex is listed on the NRHP (THC 1978).
The city, using funds from a municipal bond election held specifically to secure funding for the
effort, financed the construction of a series of road underpasses at relocated tracks during the
1930s. The Vickery Boulevard Underpass (Resource 08) was constructed under that program and
is located near the center of the project area, southwest of the interlocker at Tower 55. Another
Depression-era grade separation structure, the South Main Street overpass (Resource 04), was
constructed in 1936 by the Texas State Highway Department (Minor 1983; THC 1978; TxDOT
2009).

31

The construction completed by T&P and the city of Fort Worth facilitated an era of prosperity for
the railroads in Fort Worth, for both passenger and freight service, and provided facilities to
support the evolving interface between rail and vehicular traffic. By 1936, 35 motor freight lines
and 14 motor bus lines operated out of Fort Worth (Byars 1936). A newspaper article from that
year estimated that over a million pounds of freight were distributed each day out of Fort Worth,
transported within a 250-mile radius via motor freight lines. At the same time, passenger service
was bustling, with a train or bus departing Fort Worth approximately every 12 minutes, 24 hours
a day. Five years later, the interlocker at Tower 55 was replaced with a new building.
Correspondence from the T&P to the Railroad Commission in 1941 states that the old plant
[tower] would be abandoned and the new plant constructed, “using however certain amount of
old material” (Gammie 1941). Now oriented lengthwise from south to north, Tower 55 is extant
(and within the APE; Resource 09), but no longer used to monitor the interlocker, a job now done
remotely. The tower was decommissioned in 1995 and serves the UPRR police (Union Pacific
Crossroads 1998). The interlocker at Tower 55, however, is currently the busiest at-grade rail
intersection in the country (NCTCOG 2009).

THE EMERGING HIGHWAY SYSTEM IN FORT WORTH
Since the arrival of the railroad in 1876 and its subsequent expansion, another major influence on
Fort Worth’s built environment and cultural landscape was the development of the highway
system. One of the earliest, Highway 183, began as a two-lane highway in 1941 that served as
the primary route connecting Fort Worth and Dallas (DFW Freeways n.d.). The road was
resurfaced with concrete in 1950 just as early suburbs such as Hurst began to develop along the
corridor (Cashion 2006:103). Built during the apex of 1950s federally funded highway projects,
the Dallas-Fort Worth Turnpike (now part of IH 30) opened in 1957, running approximately
parallel of the original T&P line. The turnpike intersected with IH 35W northeast of Tower 55,
and the network of feeder roads and on-ramps at the interchange were widely referred to as the
Mixmaster.
In 1959, Fort Worth Magazine (1959:7) boasted that “Eight important federal and state highways
fall out in every direction [from Fort Worth].” In 1970, Fort Worth and Dallas were joined into
one Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA), and in 1972, the term “Metroplex” was
copyrighted as the region’s name (Cashion 2006:130). A network of interstates and tollways now
connect the two cities and provide access to the many smaller cities that make up the Metroplex.
The IH 30 and IH 35W interchange was improved in the early 1990s, a change that had been
deemed necessary since the 1960s (U.S. Department of Transportation 1989:3.22).

BRIEF OVERVIEW OF BNSF RAILWAY AND UPRR
Although Fort Worth started out with its fair share of railroad companies, through various
mergers and acquisitions at present BNSF and UPRR own the railroad tracks within the Tower 55
Surface Improvements Project area.

32

BNSF Railway
In 1995, the merger of Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Pacific Corporation created one of the
largest railroad systems in the country—BNSF (Handbook of Texas Online 2002a). The
Burlington System represents the conglomeration of nearly 400 independent railroad lines, the
earliest dating back to 1849 (BNSF Railway 2006a). Cattle and wagon trails laid the way for
early routes, and today more than 30,000 miles of BNSF track cover the western two-thirds of the
United States and parts of Canada (BNSF Railway n.d.:3).
Many of the railroads in the Burlington System were renowned for their innovation, technological
advances and “pioneering spirit” (BNSF Railway 2006a). The oldest BNSF lines—the Chicago,
Burlington & Quincy (CB&Q), originally chartered as the Aurora Branch Line, and the St. LouisSan Francisco, or “Frisco,” Railroad, previously known as Pacific Railroad of Missouri—were
both founded in 1849. These lines were followed by the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe (Santa Fe)
Railway in 1863, the Northern Pacific Railway (NP) in 1864, the Great Northern Railway (GN)
in 1893, and the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway (SP&S) in 1905. The Burlington
Northern Railroad (BN) was created in 1970 by the merging of CB&Q, NP, GN, and SP&S
(BNSF Railway 2006b).
BNSF played an important role in developing a transportation network for much of the country,
including parts of Texas. Each of its major contributing rail companies acquired its own smaller
companies, leading to hundreds of lines radiating from major cities across the central and western
United States by the early 1900s. In 1908, CB&Q acquired the Colorado and Southern Railway,
which controlled a rail system that ran through Fort Worth and other parts of Texas. This system
included the FW&DC (later to become the Fort Worth and Denver Railway Company), which
was chartered in 1873, and later additions such as the Fort Worth and Denver South Plains
Railway Company and the Fort Worth and Denver Northern Railway Company (Handbook of
Texas Online 2002b, 2002c). The Denver and New Orleans Railroad Company was chartered in
1881, and plans were made to connect with the FW&DC at the Texas-New Mexico border shortly
thereafter. This connection was made in 1888 and was followed by the integration of the Denver,
Texas and Fort Worth, the FW&DC, and the Denver, Texas and Gulf railroads (Handbook of
Texas Online 2002b).
A lull followed until the 1920s, when the area began developing agriculturally, and both the
Burlington and Santa Fe systems began vying for the area’s business. Booming cotton and wheat
industries spurred the incorporation of the Fort Worth and Denver South Plains Railway
Company, which was later leased to the Fort Worth and Denver Railway (Handbook of Texas
Online 2002b). BNSF is now one of the leading grain-hauling railroads in the country (BNSF
Railway 2006c). By 1952, the majority of remaining Colorado and Southern Railway properties
in the state were absorbed by the Fort Worth and Denver Railway, and 30 years, later both
railways had merged with BN. In 1992, the Burlington System owned more than 1,000 miles of
track in Texas.

UPRR
The UPRR, currently the largest operating railroad in Texas, can be traced back to the first
transcontinental railroad, and the T&P can be traced back to the southern transcontinental
railroad. These once competing railroad giants have long and impressive histories in providing

transportation for goods and passengers alike. Both helped to open lands to the west and for
many areas were a major impetus for growth and development.
After the completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869, the UPRR was involved in financial
troubles, and in 1873, New York financier Jay Gould acquired a large block of its stock. Gould
subsequently purchased control of the Kansas Pacific (KP), the Denver Pacific (DP), and Central
Pacific (CP). Threatened by the westward expansion of the Missouri Pacific Railroad (MoPac),
Gould proceeded to expand his railroad empire and purchased a controlling interest in the
company, becoming its president in 1879 (Union Pacific Railroad 2009a). Also in 1879, Gould
organized a syndicate to acquire an interest in the T&P (Handbook of Texas Online 2002d).
The T&P, the only railroad in Texas to operate under a federal charter, was given the right to
construct a railroad from Marshall, Texas, to San Diego, California, as part of a revived southern
transcontinental railroad project. After making Fort Worth its eastern terminus, the project was
delayed due to the financial panic of 1873, but was later completed in 1876. Between 1881 and
1885, the T&P entered receivership and was leased to the MoPac. Succeeding the cancelation of
the lease contract, the T&P and the MoPac continued to operate as a unified system through Jay
Gould’s holdings in both companies (Handbook of Texas Online 2002d).
In 1917, Gould no longer controlled the MoPac or the T&P, and the MoPac was reorganized.
The new MoPac proceeded to purchase stock in the T&P and by 1930, owned enough to gain 75
percent ownership (Handbook of Texas Online 2002d). In 1982, a merger between the UPRR,
MoPac, and Western Pacific was approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission, and in 1997,
the MoPac was legally merged with the UPRR, with UPRR remaining as the surviving
corporation (Union Pacific Railroad 2009b).

Fort Worth & Denver City Railway Company
Following the Civil War, the citizens of Fort Worth recognized that the railroads were essential
for their future prosperity. B. B. Paddock, editor of the Fort Worth Democrat, envisioned the city
serving as the hub for nine railroads and presented this vision in the pages of his paper. A sketch
of the proposal published by Paddock was referred to as the “Tarantula Map” based on the
perceived resemblance to the proposed railroads.
A more concrete example of the determination of the citizenry occurred in the early 1870s. At
this time, Fort Worth was anticipating the arrival of the Texas and Pacific Railway. However,
construction stalled at Eagle Ford in Dallas County in the wake of the Panic of 1873. Whether or
when the railroad would reach Fort Worth was now in doubt. In response, local businessmen
created the Tarrant County Construction Company in order to provide funding and otherwise
expedite the construction of the railroad. An agreement reached with the Texas and Pacific
confirmed that if the Tarrant County Construction Company would prepare the roadbed, the
railroad would lay the track. As a result of these efforts, the first train arrived in Fort Worth on
July 19, 1876 (Fink 2004:30–33).
Warren H. H. Lawrence, a recent immigrant to Fort Worth, was one of the citizens enthused with
the prospects of railroads. He envisioned a rail line running from the Gulf of Mexico into
Colorado. In 1870 Lawrence attempted to incorporate a railroad that would extend from
Beaumont to Fort Worth and then onward to join with any railroad from Colorado willing to
34

connect with the new line. The bill was introduced to the 1869–1870 session of the Texas
legislature. It was passed by both houses, but vetoed by the governor due to the miniscule
population of the Texas Panhandle during this period (Fink 2004:25–26).
Three years later, Lawrence tried again. The Fort Worth and Denver City Railway Company
(FW&DC) was chartered by the Texas Legislature on May 26, 1873. The company immediately
began a preliminary survey of the route and intended to begin construction soon afterward.
However, poor economic conditions resulting from the Panic of 1873 made funding for the
project difficult and the project was indefinitely delayed. In 1881, Grenville M. Dodge, an
experienced railroad builder, became aware of the project while working with Colorado governor
John Evans in developing a railroad from Denver to New Orleans. Dodge organized a new
company, the Texas and Colorado Railway Improvement Company, which agreed to build and
equip the FW&DC in return for $20,000 in stock and $20,000 in bonds for every mile of track
built. In addition, the Denver and New Orleans Railway Company agreed to connect with the
FW&DC track at the Texas-New Mexico border. Construction of the FW&DC resumed in 1881
and, despite a number of difficulties, met the Denver and New Orleans Railway at Union Park,
New Mexico, in 1888 (Fink 2004:34–41; Handbook of Texas Online 2010).
The FW&DC went through many corporate identities throughout its existence. In 1888, it was
acquired by the Denver, Texas, and Fort Worth, which was in turn incorporated into the Union
Pacific, Denver, and Gulf Railway Company in 1890. The Union Pacific, Denver and Gulf went
into receivership during the Panic of 1893, and in the aftermath, the Fort Worth and Denver City
was reconstituted in 1895. In 1899, the FW&DC became part of the newly chartered Colorado
and Southern Railway Company, but retained its corporate identity. In 1908, the Colorado and
Southern became part of the Burlington system, but once again the FW&DC retained its
corporate identity. In 1951, the FW&DC was renamed the Fort Worth and Denver. In 1952, all
Colorado and Southern properties except the Burlington-Rock Island were merged into the Fort
Worth and Denver. The Fort Worth and Denver became a direct subsidiary of the Burlington
Northern in 1981 and was merged into the Burlington Northern the following year (Handbook of
Texas Online 2002a, 2010)
The FW&DC was an essential element in the settling of the Panhandle. The railroad was
necessary to bring crops and livestock to market and to deliver the supplies required by
Panhandle residents—sometimes these supplies consisted of the necessities of life; Fisk
(2004:142–148) describes the difficulties the railroad had in providing potable water to the town
of Acme. The railroad also recognized that it could not survive without an adequate population to
serve and actively supported the development of agriculture in the region. Some of the
investments included providing trees and seedlings for windbreaks, providing free seed to farmers
during the droughts of the 1890s, and providing free seed for experimental plots (Handbook of
Texas Online 2002a).

CHAPTER 4
SURVEY GOALS AND METHODS

The cultural resources survey documented in this report was designed to identify and inventory
archaeological sites in addition to other important cultural resources contained within the Tower
55 Surface Improvements project area. The work was undertaken with two primary management
goals in mind:
1. to locate cultural resources occurring within the designated survey area
2. to assess the significance of those resources in regard to their potential for inclusion in the
NRHP and for designation as an SAL
The first of these goals was accomplished through the employment of analytical strategies
consisting of the use of a detailed background review and intensive pedestrian survey. These
methods are discussed below.

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH
Prior to beginning fieldwork, background information concerning the project area was collected
and reviewed. The Texas Archeological Sites Atlas, an online electronic site records database
maintained by the Texas Historical Commission, was consulted, and an internal review of
regionally related reports and an extensive investigation of regional library holdings was
undertaken. In addition, examinations of topographical maps, aerial photographs, and soil survey
data were conducted.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY METHODOLOGY
As initially planned, pedestrian survey with shovel testing, conducted by Geo-Marine
archaeologists escorted by railroad safety personnel, was to be restricted to the right-of-way of
both the currently owned lines and parcels to be purchased. Shovel testing was to be judgmental
throughout the APE within right-of-way areas that had not been previously affected by railroad
activities. However, all current right-of-way areas showed evidence of significant disturbance
throughout the length of the APE corridor, as did most of the proposed take parcels, and shovel
37

testing was deemed unnecessary here. Nevertheless, shovel testing was conducted on one of the
proposed parcel-takes, and though it was proposed on another, the threat of extreme soil
contamination prevented shovel testing.
The Project Archaeologist maintained field notes, and detailed photographs were taken,
documenting survey conditions, vegetation cover, and area covered daily, as well as initial
interpretations noted concerning locations along the APE corridor. All documents, photographs,
and other materials related to this work will be permanently curated at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory in Austin, Texas, upon completion of the project.

38

CHAPTER 5
ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY RESULTS

The APE for the archaeological survey was confined to the footprint of the project, which
consists of the current and projected rail right-of-way areas. The construction of the BNSF and
UPRR lines from the southern terminus of the APE to Northside Drive and just south of the West
Fork crossing and the joint-use line at the northern terminus both date to the latter quarter of the
nineteenth century (Figure 7). The archaeological survey of the project area involved pedestrian
inspection along the length of the approximately 11.37-mi-long (18.3 km) right-of-way, visually
assessing the potential for buried archaeological material. The entire length of the right-of-way
revealed evidence of significant disturbance due to cumulative urban development and railroadrelated construction from the last century. These impacts were photographed along the length of
the right-of-way and are reviewed below. For ease of discussion, the right-of-way was
subdivided south to north into two parts: Page Avenue to Tower 55 and Tower 55 to the northern
terminus of the project (Figures 8 and 9).

SOUTHERN SECTION—PAGE AVENUE TO TOWER 55

Current Survey Area

Southernmost Take Area
Only two new areas in this section were examined (see Figure 8). The southernmost take area is
a sliver of land (0.05 ac) within a triangular-shaped parcel at the intersection of Jennings Avenue
and Carlock Street and following the east side of BNSF line, which will be acquired for
additional track (Figure 10). The area is wedged between the track and the rear side of industrial
buildings associated with the Southwest Paper Stock complex. The tract slopes off to the edge of
the building from the edge of the current right-of-way and will be filled and leveled to
accommodate the bed for the additional track. Because of the earlier leveling and filling for the
construction of the building and tracks, as well as any utilities that may exist, the parcel is
extremely disturbed; the soil is classified as Urban land. No archaeological remains were
expected or observed.

Site 41TR236
The second area, a construction easement, along the line is located on the west side of the BNSF
track on a small cul-de-sac at the intersection of Jefferson and Bryan avenues (see Figure 8). The
0.10-ac wedge-shaped parcel follows the rail property from the corner of the intersection of
Jefferson and Bryan northward to the edge of the Allen Street bridge abutment apron, this end
being the widest point (Figure 11). The property is owned by the city of Fort Worth and is kept
mowed. Remnants of a housesite in the form of a concrete slab, measuring 1.5-x-1.5 m (5-x-5 ft)
in size, and a set of cast concrete steps, measuring 2-x-2.5 m (6.6-x-8 ft) in size, were observed
on the surface of the parcel just outside of the take line (Figure 12). A neighbor volunteered the
information that the neighborhood was developed between the 1930s and 1950s and that many
buildings were torn down about the time the Allen Street Bridge was built in the 1970s. A review
of the series of Sanborn insurance maps for this area supports this declaration. The area was not
found on the 1926 Sanborn maps, suggesting that the surrounding area was not yet developed, but
the 1951 Sanborn map does show the site area. Three structures are shown in the vacant lot;
however, only two (the structure associated with the steps and an adjacent garage) are actually in
the current right-of-way. A series of historic aerial photographs was also consulted to determine
the period of demolition. The buildings are present on a 1970 aerial, but were demolished by the
1979 aerial. The Allen Street overpass was also built within this timeframe.

Two shovel tests were excavated within the take line to determine if the area was heavily affected
and if artifacts existed that might help date an occupation. The top 20 cm (8 in) of only one of
the shovel tests, the one to the south of the steps, yielded cultural material—bottle glass (n=6),
wire nail, window glass, clinker, sawn bone, and green glazed stoneware—all typical of a midtwentieth century housesite, as well as numerous gravels of varying sizes. The shovel test unit to
the northeast of the steps contained only large quantities of gravels. Due to the materials found
and the existence of two concrete features on the surface of the parcel, a site number, 41TR236,
was assigned encompassing the whole parcel.

Previously Surveyed Area
(from Tinsley and Forbes 2010)
From the southern end, the project right-of-way begins with the twin BNSF rails located just
south of the intersection of Page Avenue and Hemphill Street (see Figure 8). This southernmost
portion of the project area is residential in nature (Figure 13) and gradually shifts to industrial
(Figure 14) by the point that the right-of-way reaches West Allen Street. The UPRR line joins the
project right-of-way about midway between Page Avenue and Allen Street, west of the Ney rail
yard. The right-of-way south of Allen Street is flat with gravel beds underlying the rails.
Additional impacts in this subsection include the highway overpasses at Main and West Allen
streets.

From West Allen Street north to Tower 55, both BNSF and UPRR rails are adjacent to each other
within the right-of-way (Figure 15). This subsection is primarily industrial in nature, with the
exception of some undeveloped residential lots west of the right-of-way between West Rosedale
Street and Pennsylvania Avenue. The rail lines are elevated as they cross over West Rosedale
Street (Figure 16). Moving north from West Rosedale Street, the right-of-way includes
underpasses at Hattie Street (Figure 17) and West Vickery Boulevard (Figure 18). From Vickery
Boulevard northward to Tower 55, the right-of-way passes under the intersection of IH 35W and
IH 30. Tower 55 is located at the intersection of the UPRR and BNSF lines (Figure 19). Just
north of the Tower 55 building, the north–south (BNSF and UPRR) and east–west (UPRR)
running rail lines cross at-grade (Figure 20; see Figure 8). The numerous rails within the rail yard
and foundations for the concrete underpasses of the interstate highways adjacent to Tower 55
have severely affected any archaeological deposits that may have been present within the rightof-way.

NORTHERN SECTION—TOWER 55 TO NORTHSIDE DRIVE AND SOUTH OF
RIVER
Moving north from Tower 55, the BNSF right-of-way on the west veers slightly to the northwest,
whereas the main north–south UPRR route is on the east. The BNSF line begins just north of
Tower 55 and extends north-northwesterly to Northside Drive, and the UPRR travels nearly due
north ending about 1,000 feet south its intersection with the West Fork (see Figure 9). The rightsof-way of both the BNSF and UPRR main routes pass through areas of extensive urban
development, with the UPRR skirting the eastern edge of the commercial center of downtown
Fort Worth (Figure 21) and the BNSF traveling through the eastern portion of downtown (Figure
22).

BNSF Right-of-Way
Eight new areas in this section will be affected by improvements and therefore were examined
(see Figure 9). The southernmost take areas in this segment of the project are found on the Ron
Investments property found just northeast of the IH 30 and IH 35W interchange in the fork of the
BNSF and UPRR main rail routes. The Ron Investments property is triangular-shaped with the
large end at the north. This area has been utilized by railroad companies for over 100 years (see
Figure 7). At the southern end of the property, only a narrow sliver of land (0.30 ac) will be
taken along the east side of the tracks. In the northern part of the property, a rectangular-shaped
easement (0.75 ac) will be taken for a new track alignment between the UPRR and BNSF lines
(see Figure 9). This easement crosses the remnants of a roundhouse, which are still very evident
on the surface of this area of the property. Tall weeds and grasses cover the surface, and small
clumps of scrub trees are along the north and west edges of the property as well as near a
depression where the turntable for the roundhouse would have been located.

Site 41TR235, the FW&DC Roundhouse
The FW&DC roundhouse site, which was assigned the trinomial 41TR235, is located between the
large railroad marshalling yards in the southeastern portion of downtown Fort Worth that support
BNSF, UPRR, and several other railroads including the TRE, and has been an industrial site for
over 100 years. During that period, extensive alterations have occurred in and near the site area.
The site area is relatively level except of a small, probably man-made depression east of the
53

roundhouse. The site measures about 150-x-90 m (492-x-295 ft), oriented north-northwest–
south-southeast on the parcel (Figure 23). The area nearest the UPRR tracks on the eastern edge
of the site contained several large stacks of railroad ties, severely limiting access to and good
observation of this area.
A review of the series of Sanborn insurance maps for this area indicates railroad tracks and
several roundhouses in the vicinity as early as 1883, but none was at this location. Though the
Fort Worth and Denver City Railroad Company had come to Fort Worth in 1890, the roundhouse
property did not appear on any of the Sanborn maps until the 1910–1911 map (Figure 24). It is
thought that the first roundhouse for the company may have been in Hodge about 5 mi (8 km)
north of this present location (Overton 1953:259).
Several features were identified on the surface of the site. These consist of the bays of the
roundhouse, concrete pads indicating several structures, concrete sidewalks, and several
depressions (see Figure 23). The roundhouse remains consist of a series of 11 concrete floors
(bays) separated by narrow, earth-filled sections which probably contained tracks. A continuous
concrete walkway approximately 2.5 m (8 ft) wide parallels the western edge of the roundhouse.
A brick wall three courses wide forms the exterior (western) wall or foundation. In most places,
the brick wall is exposed at ground surface; however, near the north edge, it extends roughly
10 cm (4 in) above ground surface and the bricks are covered by a thick layer of concrete. This
may indicate that the putative wall is actually a foundation. The concrete bays typically have two
raised concrete areas approximately 50 cm (20 in) in size that appear to be piers for structural
supports (Figure 25). The two piers are not visible in all of the concrete bays, probably due to
demolition.
Feature 1 is a large concrete pad found northwest of the roundhouse. The pad is approximately
21-x-10 m (69-x-33 ft) in size. A raised brick section about 10 cm (4 in) tall near the south end of
the foundation is approximately 2-x-2.5 m (6.6-x-8 ft) in size. Four drains were noted in the top
of this feature; presumably they functioned for shower stalls. This structure does not appear on
any of the reviewed Sanborn maps.
Feature 2 is a small concrete pad and associated gravel area that is about 2-x-4 m (6.6-x-13 ft) in
overall size. It appears to correspond to a building that first appears on the 1926 Sanborn maps.
Feature 3 is a series of concrete pads that represents the machine shop and engine room shown on
the 1910–1911 Sanborn map. The main pad is about 20-x-15 m in size and probably represents
the machine shop. A smaller, 4-x-6-m (13-x-20-ft) area visible inside the larger slab is centered
on a set of tracks and may indicate an earlier phase of construction or a separate part of the
machine shop. Another 4-x-4-m (13-x-13-ft) slab probably corresponds to the engine room
marked on the 1910–1911 Sanborn map. A partial concrete foundation wall and an associated 2­
x-2-m (6.6-x-6.6-ft) slab were also found in the area, but do not appear to be related to the
features shown on the 1910–1911 Sanborn map.
Feature 4 is a large rubble pile containing large concrete pieces, brick, and wood that appears to
have been pushed here to fill a depression estimated at 1.5–2 m (5–6.6 ft) deep (Figure 26). An
office and platform are shown on the 1910–1911 Sanborn map slightly north and east of the
rubble pile. Given the proximity of these features, it is thought that the rubble pile represents the
remnants of these structures.

54

26. Large rubble pile at west edge of site, view southwest

Figure 26. Large rubble pile at west edge of site, view southwest.

Other items not given a feature designation include a short section of track found embedded in the
concrete of the roundhouse and in Feature 3; a manhole cover within the roundhouse that is
embossed “McKINLEY IRON WKS FT WORTH TEX/SEWER”; and three sets of walkways
south of the roundhouse.
The Sanborn maps appear to show that the site developed primarily in the early twentieth century.
There are detailed differences between the 1910–1911 and 1926 Sanborn maps, but the buildings
shown on the 1926 and 1951 maps are the same. The office/storeroom/platform complex (likely
Feature 4) appears stable, but the machine shop complex (Feature 3) has expanded to incorporate
the blacksmith shop shown on the 1910–1911 map. Two new structures are shown northwest of
the roundhouse, but unfortunately, the legends are not legible. One of these structures appears to
incorporate Feature 2, and the other may be intended to represent Feature 1, but the footprint and
location do not match. The 1926 map also shows a track ending at the location of Feature 1. It is
likely that Feature 1 is a very late addition; it does not seem to be present on the 1951 Sanborn
map, but is visible on the 1956 aerial photograph.
Due to the potential of soil contamination from over 100 years of railroad and industrial usage of
the area, the client recommended and greatly encouraged that no shovel testing be conducted
within the site boundaries of 41TR235. Based on a 1963 aerial, the roundhouse was still in use
but was demolished soon afterward. Also due to the extensive use of this area by railroad
companies, the subsurface has been extensively altered over the years (e.g., leveling for
construction, demolition of structures, continued use and reuse of the area as a railroad facility).
Several pushpiles of soil near the putative location of the turntable indicate some evidence of the
removal of that turntable.
58

North of Site 41TR235
Continuing north of the site 41TR235 area along the BNSF right-of-way, the rail bed is level and
moves through the eastern edge of downtown (see Figure 9). The next area to be affected is on
the northwest southwest corner of 1st Street and the track, where a small corner clip, about 0.02
ac, will be taken for grade separation pedestrian access (Figure 27). The parcel is highly
disturbed with buried utilities throughout.

27. Overview of 1st Street corner clip; facing north

Figure 27. Overview of 1st Street corner clip; facing north.

Approximately 0.03 ac at the end of Weatherford Street, also on the west side of the track and a
block away from 1st Street, will be taken. This area once was part of a cross street that was closed
off and realigned along the track northward (Figure 28). This area is also extremely disturbed
from the road construction and removal, and filling and leveling for the rail bed. No
archaeological remains were expected or observed in either of these locations.
At East Belknap Street and northward to and including the intersection at Peach Street, a strip of
land on the east side of the track approximately 0.36 ac will be taken to reinforce the wall along
the track (see Figure 9). The track along this stretch is slightly lower than the surrounding area.
The current east wall of the rail bed exhibits bedrock but requires a retaining wall for support
(Figures 29 and 30).

30. East rail bed wall south of Peach Street; facing south

Figure 30. East rail bed wall south of Peach Street; facing south.

On the north side of Peach Street, a pedestrian underpass is planned. The underpass will be
constructed by installing a precast concrete semi-arch or corrugated structural plate arch on a
reinforced concrete pad located approximately 14 ft (4 m) below the rails. Currently the parcel,
about 0.05 ac, is used as a local parking or turn-around area (Figure 31).
The track north of Peach Street to Gounah is slightly higher than the surrounding area but is near
grade. Two small parcels totaling 0.09 ac will be taken on the east side of Gounah Street for
pedestrian access and additional overpass track (see Figure 9). The parcel on the south side of
Gounah has been used as a parking area and is lined with small scrub trees along its west edge
and at the base of the track bed (Figure 32). Some ground disturbances appear to have occurred
here over the years. The north side of Gounah is composed of the elevated rail bed and the stone
apron of the current rail overpass (Figure 33); McDougall et al. (2010:89–90) recommended this
overpass ineligible due to loss of integrity. This parcel has been affected by previous rail
overpass and street construction activities. The proposed building of an additional overpass with
rail will not affect archaeological resources.
The track from this location up to Cold Springs Road runs on level, at-grade rail beds through
residential and industrial areas northeast of downtown (see Figure 9). It also runs behind the
historic Pioneers Rest Cemetery, the oldest cemetery in Fort Worth. At Cold Springs Road, a
small rectangular shaped parcel measuring 0.07 ac will be taken on the east side of the track for
an additional rail overpass. The current overpass occupies most of this parcel on the north side of
the road (Figure 34), and the south side is used for local parking and turn-around. Broken asphalt
was observed in the turn-around.

North of Cold Springs Road to Northside Drive, the BNSF rail remains mostly at grade with no
additional take areas required.

UPRR Right-of-Way
From Tower 55 to the terminus of the project corridor along the UPRR rail (see Figure 9) an
additional 25-ft-wide (7.6-m) right-of-way along the east side of the existing track for an
additional track will be required. From Tower 55 to Delga Street northeast of downtown, UPRR
already has the necessary right-of-way. However, the 25-ft right-of-way from Delga Street to the
terminus of this corridor—approximately 1,000 ft (305 m) south of the West Fork—is newly
acquired right-of-way. The track for most of this route gradually rises and is well above grade
when it reaches Delga Street (Figure 35). The new take acreage from Delga Street north is
approximately 1.6 ac. Most of the acreage abuts the current apron base and slopes steeply into a
depressed drainage that becomes deeper farther north along the corridor (Figure 36). Standing
water occurs intermittently along this drainage (Figure 37) and it has been used for dumping of
construction debris, possibly an effort to curtail erosion. As the line gets closer to the river, the
grade of the rail gradually becomes nearly level with the surrounding area. The disturbances
from the elevated rail bed and steep drainage walls imply a very low potential for in situ
archaeological deposits.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The intensive archaeological survey of the Tower 55 Surface Improvements project corridor was
designed to investigate properties within the project APE to document previously unknown
cultural resources and collect sufficient data for the evaluation of the eligibility of each resource
for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL. This chapter presents a summary of
investigations and recommendations for the project corridor.

Archaeological sites are evaluated according to criteria based on federal regulations for
determining the significance of cultural resources for inclusion in the NRHP. Recommendations
of eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP are applied following the identification of the following
criteria, relevant historical themes, and related research questions:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archaeology, and culture is present in
districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design, setting,
materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and:
(A) that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns
of our history; or
(B) that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
(C) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual
distinction; or
(D) that have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history[36
CFR § 60.4].

Usually, Criterion D is applied to most prehistoric and many historic sites. Important information
is generally recognized as referring to scientific importance. This importance is, of course, driven
by such factors as current research perspectives and the state of available information regarding a
particular research topic in a specific research area. Over time, data requirements for some
67

research questions may be addressed to various degrees, even though complementary data are
often needed from different temporal periods, geographic settings, or site types to fully
understand the diversity of past human activities. If data approach redundancy, the need for
corroborative information from similar sites is diminished. This suggests that information
deemed important is tied to both a specific geographical area, reflecting a cultural adaptation or
region, and a state of accumulated knowledge regarding a research domain. Archaeological sites
with integrity containing artifacts and features that can contribute information toward addressing
research issues are regarded as significant and are eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.
In many cases, and for various reasons of preservation, site formation processes, or
postdepositional disturbances, some archaeological remains are generally regarded as having very
little or no research potential for contributing useful information toward the understanding of
history or prehistory. For instance, an artifact assemblage might be disturbed from its primary
context, or components of various temporal periods might be mixed or otherwise not
interpretable. In such cases, a site is not regarded as scientifically important, and in general, these
kinds of sites are not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.

State Archaeological Landmark
At the state level, archaeological sites may be considered significant and be recognized or
designated as an SAL if at least one of the following conditions is met:
1.
2.

The archaeological site is situated on lands owned or controlled by the State of Texas or one of its
political subdivisions; or
The archaeological site is situated on private land which has been specifically designated as an
SAL . . . and fits at least one of the following criteria:
(A) Preservation of materials must be sufficient to allow application of standard archaeological
techniques to advantage;
(B) The majority of artifacts are in place so that a significant portion of the site’s original
characteristics can be defined through investigation;
(C) The site has the potential to contribute to cumulative culture history by the addition of new
information;
(D) The site offers evidence of unique or rare attributes; and/or
(E) The site offers a unique and rare opportunity to test techniques, theory, or methods or
preservation, thereby contributing to scientific knowledge [Texas Natural Resources Code
1977; Title 9, Chapter 191, Texas Antiquities Committee, Section 191.094 and Chapter 41.7,
Antiquities Code of Texas].

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The Tower 55 Surface Improvements project corridor is approximately 4.4 mi (7 km) long, and
the right-of-way is generally about 100–150 ft (30.5–46 m) in width. The surface improvements
to this corridor are designed to improve the movement of all trains within and around current rail
infrastructure that converges on Tower 55 in Fort Worth.
The scope of work consisted of the performance of archaeological and historic-age structure
surveys focusing on those properties within the 4.4-mi-long (7 km) project APE, which consisted
of only the current and proposed new right-of-way areas that together encompass approximately
68

80 acs. This report covers the results of archaeological survey; the historic-age structure survey is
presented in a separate document. The ultimate goal of this project was to identify and inventory
cultural resources properties contained within the proposed project area and to evaluate their
potential for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places or for designation as a State
Archeological Landmark. Two historic-age archaeological resources, site 41TR235 and
41TR236, were identified during the survey in two of the proposed take parcels, but both have
lost integrity because of sustained numerous impacts from associated road, rail, and building
construction and demolition, and installation and removal of utilities and other infrastructure.
Additionally, housesite 41TR236, which just barely falls within the timeframe for historic
assessment and, like so many other historic domestic sites in Northcentral Texas from this time
period, would only produce redundant information about lifeways of the mid-twentieth century.
It is recommended as not eligible for inclusion on the NRHP or for designation as an SAL.
Site 41TR235, the Fort Worth & Denver City Roundhouse is a historic resource that was
apparently constructed in the late 1890s or early 1900s and demolished in the 1960s. The 1898
Sanborn Fire Insurance Map does not show the roundhouse, but it is present on the 1910–1911
edition. The roundhouse is also visible on the 1926–1927 and the 1951 editions of the maps. A
series of historic aerial photographs was also consulted to determine when the roundhouse was
demolished. A structure is still visible (and apparently in use) on a 1963 aerial, but is
demolished/gone on a 1970 aerial.
The Sanborn maps appear to show that the site developed primarily in the early twentieth century.
There are detailed differences between the 1910–1911 and 1926 Sanborn maps, but the buildings
shown on the 1926 and 1951 maps are the same. The office/storeroom/platform complex (likely
Feature 4) appears stable, but the machine shop complex (Feature 3) has expanded to incorporate
the blacksmith shop shown on the 1910–1911 map. Two new structures are shown northwest of
the roundhouse, but unfortunately the legends are not legible. One of these structures appears to
incorporate Feature 2; the other may be intended to represent Feature 1, but the footprint and
location do not match. The 1926–1927 map also shows a track ending at the location of Feature
1. It is possible that Feature 1 is a very late addition; it does not seem to be present on the 1951
Sanborn map, but is visible on the 1956 aerial photograph.
Railroad personnel recommended that no excavations be undertaken due to the potential for
contaminated soils; consequently, no shovel testing was conducted and depth of deposits is
unknown. However, impacts from numerous installation and removal of buried utilities and other
infrastructure associated with the roundhouse facility, as well as the demolition and removal of
tracks and buildings, have further disturbed the site. A noncontrolled surface inspection found a
number of features and artifacts visible on the surface. The turntable noted on the Sanborn maps
was not found during this investigation. The putative location was at that edge of a depression
east of the roundhouse and at the edge of a large dump of railroad ties. It appears that the
turntable was either removed or buried after the demolition of the roundhouse. Some
confirmation of this theory is provided by the 1970 aerial, which also shows no evidence of the
turntable. Though the footprint of the roundhouse and a few ancillary buildings and structures
still exist, the amount of missing information about the turntable and any mechanisms on the
working of the facility leave very little potential for significant, intact data in the ground.
Therefore, the site is recommended as not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as
an SAL.

69

Since the area north of Peach Street will be excavated to 14 ft (4 m) below the current grade for
the pedestrian underpass, it is recommended that once geotechnical core samples are taken that
they be analyzed by a geoarchaeologist for potential archaeological deposits. This area is on
Holocene Fluviatile terrace deposits that could contain buried archaeological deposits. Based on
the results of these analyses, backhoe trenching may be required prior to construction of the
underpass.
The remaining areas were shown to have extensive disturbances from the original construction,
subsequent reworking of the rail lines from the late nineteenth century, and utility emplacements
within the right-of-way through the years. The areas originally considered to be of high
probability for buried archaeological materials (i.e., situated within the West Fork flood plain)
were either not to be affected by the current project and/or had already been heavily disturbed by
previous construction activities, except at Peach Street where the pedestrian underpass is
proposed. Though two archaeological historic sites as defined under 36 CFR 60.4, 13 TAC
26.5(6), 13 TAC 26.5(32), and 13 TAC 26.8 were identified during the archaeological
investigation of the current project APE, neither is recommended eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP or for designation as an SAL. In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4(d)(2) and 13 TAC 26.2,
no further investigation is necessary at sites 41TR235 and 41TR236. However, the recommended
analysis of geotechnical core samples from the Peach Street area will determine the existence of
archaeological deposits. At that time, a recommendation for effects to historic properties as
defined by 36 CFR 800.4(d)(2) and 13 TAC 26.2 will be finalized.
