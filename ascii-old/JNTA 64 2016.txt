Caddo Ceramic Vessels from the Fred Yarbrough Site
(41VN6) in the Upper Sabine River Basin,
Van Zandt County, Texas
Timothy K. Perttula
Introduction
Excavations in 1940 by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) at the Fred Yarbrough site (41VN6)
in the upper Sabine River basin (Figure 1) recovered a number of ceramic vessels from Area B of the site
(Johnson 1962:225; see also Wilson 1950). Johnson (1962:226-230 and Figure 22a-g) provided an initial
description of the vessels as well as drawings of a number of the reconstructed vessels. In this article, I reexamine the nine vessels from the Fred Yarbrough site held in the collections of the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory at the University of Texas at Austin (TARL), employing the vessel documentation
protocol used in recent years to document ancestral Caddo vessels from sites in East Texas, and I also provide
photographs of each of the vessels.

Archaeological Context

The Fred Yarbrough site is a multi-component Paleoindian, Archaic, Woodland, and ancestral Caddo
occupation in the Sabine River floodplain in the upper Sabine River basin (Johnson 1962:155). The ceramic
vessels described and documented herein are from Area B of the site, described by Johnson (1962:224-225)
as follows:
This consisted of a small area, approximately 20 feet in diameter, of dark humus-stained
midden soil containing many potsherds and bone scraps…it was a small habitation area of
one, or at the most, two houses.
In addition to the recovery of 612 ceramic vessel sherds from Area B, a total of nine ceramic vessels
were reconstructed by the WPA laboratory. Johnson (1962:225) noted that this “relatively large number of
pots is somewhat surprising considering the small amount of sherds, and leads one to wonder whether they
represent furniture from graves or other features which could have been destroyed by repeated agricultural
cultivation of a recent date.” The provenience information at TARL associated with the vessels indicates that
six of the vessels are from a “burned area” or “burned area on house site,” suggesting the vessels may have
been in situ inside an ancestral Caddo house when it was burned down, thus limiting their spatial dispersal.
Caddo Ceramic Vessels
The nine vessels from the Fred Yarbrough site include two jars, two carinated bowls, three bowls, and
two bottles. Only one of the carinated bowls, one of the bowls, one of the bottles, and one of the jars are
decorated (44 percent of the vessels in the site assemblage); only one of the vessels (11 percent) has a slip
on its exterior surface.

Summary and Conclusions

WPA excavations at the Fred Yarbrough site (41VN6) on the Sabine River in East Texas recovered nine
small to medium-sized Caddo ceramic vessels or reconstructed vessel sections, none clearly from burial
context. Instead, given the association of a number of the vessels with a burned area in Area B midden
deposits, it is probable that these vessels were in a habitation context that was burned in prehistoric times,
preserving the vessels in situ. The nine vessels include two jars, two carinated bowls, three bowls, and two
bottles. One of the carinated bowls and one of the bowls are Sanders Engraved vessels, one of the bottles
is a Sanders Slipped vessel, and one jar is a Canton Incised vessel. These types at the site indicate that the
Area B habitation and midden deposits were deposited in the Middle Caddo period (ca. A.D. 1200-1400),
in a cultural context analogous to the Sanders phase at ancestral Caddo sites in the upper Red, Sulphur, Big
Cypress, and Sabine River basins in East Texas.
The vessels are tempered with grog (56 percent), grog-bone (33 percent), and grog-bone-hematite (11
percent). The vessels were fired in both oxidizing (22 percent) and reducing (78 percent) environments, but
most of the latter vessels were also cooled in the open air (67 percent). Fine ware vessels (i.e., with engraved
or slipped decorative elements) were commonly burnished or smoothed on one or both vessel surfaces, the
one utility ware vessel (i.e., with a wet paste decoration) has been smoothed on its exterior surface, and the
plain wares are either smoothed (80 percent) or burnished (20 percent) on their exterior surfaces, and smoothed
(20 percent) on their interior surfaces.

Archaeological Evidence of the Use of the Horse by
Caddo Indian Peoples
Timothy K. Perttula
Introduction
The introduction of the horse to the Americas by Europeans, particularly the Spanish, after 1492 played a
very important role in Native American history and societal change. As Peter Mitchell (2015:7) has commented
in his book Horse Nations: “the horse was so very widely introduced to population across the world after 1492.
It can thus provide a constant against which to evaluate the many changes that those populations experienced
after European contact, while highlighting the ‘radically different meanings and impacts in distinctive cultures’
that its arrival heralded.” Among the Caddo Indian peoples, the horse was introduced in the late 1600s from
Mexico (Mitchell 2015:Figure 3.6) as well as the Jumano tribe of the Southern Plains (Mitchell 2015:98),
leading to the development of new means to “trade, move, and raid,” and move equipment, as mounted warfare
came to dominate the Southern Plains of North America after about the early 1680s (Mitchell 2015:81-82).
By 1719, the Caddo were domesticating feral horses (La Vere 1998:62), as the horse became well integrated
into their farming economies. By this time, the horse was the prime exchangeable commodity for Caddo
societies south of the Red River.
The Jumano Juan Sabeata had described the Tejas or Hasinai Caddo groups in the early 1680s as “a settled
people [who]…raised grain in such abundance that they even fed it to their horses” (Bolton 1920:314). In
addition to the horses, the Caddo also obtained horse gear, such as bridles and saddles. When La Salle came
to East Texas in 1686, after his expedition to find the Mississippi River had failed along the Texas Gulf Coast,
he purchased several horses from the Hasinai Caddo; when he set out for the Mississippi River in 1687, he
did so on horses previously purchased from the Caddo (Joutel 1906:113). Father Anastasius Douay, who
accompanied La Salle, said that horses were common property among the Caddo and could be purchased
for a single iron hatchet (Hackett 1931-1946, Volume 1, para. 361-363). In 1690, when Henri de Tonti was
in Kadohadacho villages along the Red River in northeastern Texas, he commented that they had 30 horses,
which the Kadohadacho called cavali (after caballo, a horse in Spanish) (Perttula 1992:11). Furthermore,
the Nabedache Caddo in East Texas “possessed them in such numbers that there were four or five about each
house” (Griffith 1954:145). The livestock brought by the Spanish to East Texas became part of the Hasinai
herd after the missions were abandoned in 1693.
By this time, the Caddo had already begun a profitable trade in salt, pelts, and horses with French Louisiana
and Illinois colonies (Giraud 1974:343); in 1714, the Frenchman St. Denis established the Natchitoches post
at the abandoned 1702 Natchitoches village to commence formal French involvement in trade with Native
Americans (Swanton 1946:737-738). For the sale of horses at the French post at Natchitoches, the Hasinai
Caddo received firearms, powder and lead balls, hatchets, knives, hoes, glass beads, mirrors, cloth, garments,
and alcohol (Surrey 1916:282). By about 1716, “the Hasinai and the Cadohadachos marked, respectively, the
saturated frontier of horses moving eastward, and of muskets moving westward in trade” (Perttula 1992:202).
As late as 1800, the Barr and Davenport trading house in Spanish Nacogdoches, Texas, acquired 500 horses
from the Hasinai Caddo groups and immigrant Indians living in East Texas (see Jackson 1986:472).

Archaeological Evidence

Despite the Caddo’s long use of the horse, at the present time there are only three ancestral Caddo sites
that have direct archaeological evidence of the use of the horse by Caddo peoples (Figure 1). All three of the
sites are in the Red River basin, in either East Texas or Northwest Louisiana.

Figure 1. Location of Caddo archaeological sites with evidence of use of the horse.
The first of the archaeological sites is the Belcher site (16CD13). Excavations in Mound B more than 60
years ago recovered one horse phalanx (Webb 1959:180). Other than noting that “bones of horse, cow, and
pig…were probably incorporated in the superficial layers of debris” in the mound (Webb 1959:180), Webb
provides no specific provenience information for the horse bone. If the bone is not modern in age, then it
suggests that the horse bone is part of the very latest Belcher phase occupation at the site, perhaps dating in
the late 1600s or very early 1700s (cf. Kelley 2012).

Journal of Northeast Texas Archaeology 64 (2016) 15
The second site is the Fish Hatchery site in Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana (Walker 1935), not far from
the French post of Natchitoches. This 18th century Natchitoches Caddo site on Cane River, an old channel of
the Red River, is a large cemetery (>100 burials). Amidst the ancestral Caddo burials were two horse burials
(Walker 1935:Figure 1). According to Walker (1935:3):
Most surprising of all was the finding of two horse skeletons, each with a large earthen bowl
placed near the head. The bowls were of plain ware about a foot and a half in diameter and
half an inch thick.
Bolton (1987:153) mentioned the third Caddo site with archaeological evidence of the use of the horse.
He noted that “the excavation of a grave at Atlanta, Texas, in the Caddo country, gives ground for thinking
that after the coming of the horse, the warrior’s steed was buried with him.” Although the specific site is not
mentioned by Bolton, it is suspected that the site is in the same area as other late 17th to early 18th century
Nasoni Caddo sites along the Caddo trace in Cass County, Texas, such as Goode Hunt (41CS23), Clements
(41CS25), A. P. Fourche, and R. A. Simpson on Black Bayou and Black Cypress Bayou (Perttula et al. 2010).
A fourth Historic Caddo site that may have evidence of use of the horse is the Susie Slade site (41HS13)
on Potter’s Creek in the mid-Sabine River basin. This Nadaco Caddo site was used as a cemetery during much
of the 18th century and the early 19th century. The site records at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
at The University of Texas at Austin indicate that the “bones of a horse” were found buried at the site when
excavations were done in the early 1960s by local collectors.
Conclusions
Historical and ethnohistorical sources indicate that the horse was important in Caddo societies and
economic pursuits by the early 1680s, and became even more so in later years as the horse was a prime
Caddo trade product traded with Europeans for many different kinds of commodities. Mitchell (2015:130)
suggests that these horse burials on Caddo sites “attest to the high value that horses held, and we know that
among Caddoan speakers both breeding and trading horses were sources of male prestige.” And perhaps,
these burials marked the graves of important horse traders in Natchitoches and Nasoni Caddo communities.
The virtual absence of horse bones in midden or habitation deposits in Caddo sites also indicates that
they were not a source of meat to Caddo populations, as they were to many Southern Plains bison-hunting
groups (Mitchell 2015:126), but were much more important in enhancing Caddo trading opportunities with
Europeans and other Native American communities, such as the Choctaw, particularly in the peltry, horse,
gun, and salt trades through much of the 18th century (Perttula 1994). In this trade, Caddo communities
supplied food products, material items, and marketable goods such as horses, pelts, and bear grease in return
for European goods. Having the horse also allowed Caddo groups to engage in the long distance exploitation
of Southern Plains bison herds after the 1680s.

A Middle Caddo Period Cemetery (41FK97/139) on
Big Cypress Creek in Franklin County, Texas
Timothy K. Perttula and Bo Nelson
Introduction
In the early 1990s, an ancestral Caddo habitation site and cemetery was reported to the junior author
in the Big Cypress Creek valley in Franklin County in East Texas (Figure 1) by a local collector. The site is
in an area of other known ancestral Caddo cemeteries, including the Bruce J. Connally Farm (41FK5) and
the P. G. Hightower Farm (41FK7) (Thurmond 1990:158-159). In this article we summarize the available
information about this important but still little known ancestral Caddo site.

Area 1 at the site had both arrow points and dart points, as well as eight ancestral Caddo burials. Area 2
may have had midden deposits, and two ancestral Caddo burials were known to have also been discovered
in this part of the site. The burials in Area 1 were in a single north-south row, in east-west oriented graves
where the deceased had been laid out in an extended supine position; based on the size of the graves and the
inclusion of miniature ceramic vessels in two of the burials, six burials in Area 1 were those of adults and
the other two were children. Two of the burials had an ash lining in the grave pit and another was lined with
ferruginous sandstone rocks.

This ancestral Caddo site was not officially recorded until April 1997 when the western part of the site
was investigated as part of proposed SH 37 improvements by the Texas Department of Transportation. It was
noted during the time the site was first recorded that there was a 13 m long looter trench in this part of the
site. A single engraved bottle sherd was collected from the site at that time: the sherd had both vertical and
horizontal engraved lines, as well as one vertical engraved line with open engraved pendant triangles. In April
2010, the eastern portion of the site was recorded, and assigned 41FK139 as its trinomial, the assumption
being made that though the western and eastern parts of the site were on the same upland landform, they
must be separate and unrelated sites. This part of the site was bisected by the right-of-way of the Keystone
XL pipeline (Carpenter et al. 2010). The site form does not mention the occurrence of midden deposits or
burial features, but based on the size of the pipeline right-of-way that was examined, it appears in any event
to be the case that the known extent of the collector-excavated cemetery area is outside of the Keystone XL
pipeline right-of-way; whether there are additional ancestral Caddo burials in the pipeline right-of-way has
not been ascertained. Following Texas Archeological Research Laboratory procedures when an archeological
site has received two separate trinomials (e.g., because the overall extent of the site was not assessed at
the time) when in fact both parts of the site are actually encompassed within a single larger site, the lower
assigned trinomial—in this case, 41FK97—is to be used when referencing the site’s trinomial (Jean Hughes,
June 2015 personal communication to the senior author).
Ceramic Vessel Funerary Offerings
A number of ceramic vessels (n=19) were placed in the graves in Area A at the site as funerary offerings;
this is a mean of 2.4 vessels per grave. This includes five plain bowls, two with opposed lip tabs, a small plain
jar or cup (Figure 3c), seven plain jars or bottles, a Bois d’Arc Plain, var. Crawford bowl with a scalloped and
cut lip (Figure 3a) (Perttula et al. 2016), an effigy bowl with a bird head at one end and a tab tail at the other
end of the bowl, a punctated jar with strap handles (probably Monkstown Fingernail Impressed), a Sanders
Engraved carinated bowl (Figure 3d) with diagonally opposed engraved lines, and two engraved water bottles.
The first bottle is decorated with a series of narrow vertical engraved zones filled with cross-hatched lines
(Figure 3b), while the second bottle—with a carinated body—has two sets of concentric engraved diamonds
or circles on the vessel body, along with a single row of engraved pendant triangles at the top of the vessel
body (Figure 3e).
Summary and Conclusions
41FK97 is a large ancestral Caddo site in the Big Cypress Creek basin, first discovered and investigated
by an artifact collector in the early 1990s; different parts of the site were officially recorded in 1997 and
2010 during the survey of proposed improvements to SH 37 and in the archaeological survey of the proposed
Keystone XL pipeline right-of-way. Two areas of the site—both apparently outside of the proposed SH 37
and pipeline right-of-ways—are known to have ancestral Caddo burials, eight burials in Area 1 and two
burials in Area 2.
The eight burials in Area 1 that were investigated by the artifact collector were in east-west oriented
graves with the individuals (both children and adults) laid in the graves in an extended supine position. One
of the burials had a clay pipe (form unknown), and a total of 19 vessels had been placed as funerary offerings
with the deceased individuals. More than 73 percent of the ceramic vessels are plain bowls, jars, or bottles,
including a distinctive Bois d’Arc Plain, var. Crawford bowl. This variety of Bois d’Arc Plain is common
in Middle Caddo period burial features at the Sanders site (41LR2) on the Red River. Sanders Engraved
carinated bowl are also a common funerary offering in burial features at the Sanders site. The two engraved
bottles share decorative elements on several of the bottles and other fine ware vessels from the Sanders site
(Perttula et al. 2016), including cross-hatched elements as well as diamonds and concentric circles.

Figure 3. Drawings of selected ceramic vessels in the ancestral Caddo
cemetery at 41FK97.
Overall, the character of the ceramic vessels in the burials from Area 1 at 41FK97 suggest that they are
from a Middle Caddo period cemetery dating from ca. A.D. 1200-1400. Thus, the cemetery is contemporaneous
with the Sanders phase occupation of the Red River and upper Sabine River basins, and with several other
Middle Caddo sites and cemeteries in the western part of the Big Cypress Creek basin (Nelson and Turner
1997:1, 5 and Figure 1).

Documentation of Early Caddo Period Ceramic Vessels
from the George C. Davis Site on the Neches River
in Cherokee County, Texas
Timothy K. Perttula
Introduction
The George C. Davis site (41CE19)/Caddo Mounds State Historic Site in Cherokee County, Texas, is a
Caddo site that was occupied by ancestral Caddo peoples between ca. A.D. 940 and the late 1200s (based on
an extensive suite of calibrated radiocarbon dates, see below) on a large alluvial terrace of the Neches River
in East Texas (Figure 1). The site is a planned civic-ceremonial center that has three earthen mounds—Mound
A, a large platform mound with elite residences and special purpose structures; Mound B, a second platform
mound; and Mound C, a burial mound used as a cemetery for the elite or ranked members of the society—a
borrow pit, and a large associated village (estimated at more than 110 acres) with more than 100 known or
suspected structures. The structures include the domestic residences of the commoners that lived at the site
as well as the residences for the elites (chiefs and religious leaders) and special structures used for ritual and
ceremonial purposes (Spock 1977; Story 1997, 1998, 2000).
The George C. Davis site is an archaeological site that has yielded information of major scientific
importance concerning the origins and development of the Caddo peoples, a still little-known but significant
stratified and complex society that lived in the far western reaches of the Southeastern United States and
whose cultural traditions have lasted for more than 1000 years. The expansive nature of the archaeological
investigations at the George C. Davis site since 1939 has obtained unique information on Caddo community
organization and social logic, the nature of Caddo symbolism and ideology, as well as the early existence of
important community political, social, and religious activities within special precincts near Mounds A and
B. The archaeological work has also obtained key insights into the domestic nature of the community, with
residential domiciles dated as early as ca. A.D. 940 organized into compounds with small courtyards; this was
not a vacant mound center. Demonstrating great continuity in Caddo community and social organization, the
same kinds of domestic compounds seen ca. A.D. 940 and after at the George C. Davis site have also been
documented from a 1691 map prepared by a Spanish expedition to a Nasoni Caddo civic-ceremonial center
on the Red River in East Texas.
The George C. Davis site archaeological record from sacred as well as domestic contexts contains important
Caddo data relevant to each of these broad themes. This includes evidence from features for the earliest origins
of the community at ca. A.D. 940 as well as features that demonstrate a continuous occupation that lasted
until the late A.D. 1200s. The use of tropical cultigens preserved in features has been shown to have been an
important subsistence resource in the community, intensifying in use after ca. A.D. 1200 among East Texas
Caddo societies (Perttula et al. 2014), during a period of climate (the Medieval Warm Period) favorable for
agriculture in the Caddo area. A crystallization of religion, ideology, and iconographic practice as a measure
of complexity is seen in the archaeological record of these early Caddos, denoted by the development of
platform mounds with temples and other specialized structures for use by the political and religious elite, the
acquisition and exchange of non-local prestige goods, details of architecture and mound construction (the
use of berms and selective use of brightly colored soils), and the kinds of elaborate burial features (several
with multiple individuals, probably indicative of retainer sacrifice) and associated grave goods in the Mound
C mortuary at the site (e.g., Perttula 2013; Story 1997, 1998, 20000

Journal of Northeast Texas Archaeology, Volume 64, 2016

Journal of Northeast Texas Archaeology 64 (2016)

The George C. Davis has had the most extensive investigations of any Caddo mound site, including
very large scale archaeo-geophysical work (Walker and McKinnon 2012:181-189), and archaeologists have
done an exemplary job in publishing the results of their investigations, beginning with the seminal 1949
study prepared by H. Perry Newell and Alex D. Krieger (1949, 2000). Taken together, the extensive nature
of the work (see Story 1969, 1972, 1981, 1997, 1998, 2000), the quality of the archaeological investigations,
and the unique archaeo-geophysical data set, suggest that the George C. Davis site strongly exemplifies the
character of a Caddo civic-ceremonial community in the Caddo archaeological area, and through its study
has shed unique light on the origins and elaboration of the Caddo cultural tradition.
In this article, I document, using a standardized protocol, the ancestral Caddo vessels and vessel sections
that have been recovered from various kinds of features at the George C. Davis site since excavations began
at the site in 1939. I also discuss the stylistic and functional character of this unique vessel assemblage. The
analysis of the recovered ceramic vessels and sherds from the George C. Davis site has been ongoing since
the 1940s (e.g., Arnold 1973, 1975; Descantes et al. 2005; Marchbanks 1989; Stokes and Woodring 1981),
and has included innovative work in the chemical characterization of the ceramics as well as the preservation
of lipids in samples of ceramic vessels and sherds. Dr. Robert Z. Selden has also obtained 3-D scans of many
of the vessels discussed in this article.

Archaeological Context of the Site and the Ceramic Vessels
Archaeological excavations that have occurred at the George C. Davis site since 1939 have revealed
many preserved features in the mounds and village areas (evidence of wood structures, outdoor activity areas,
borrow pits, burial pits and shaft tombs, discrete mound fills, and mound ramps) (Figure 2). These excavations
have encompassed approximately 3.4 acres (ca. 13,860 m2), or only about 3 percent of the known site area
(Story 2000). Recent archaeo-geophysical surveys of a 110 acre area of the site has also identified over 70
Caddo architectural features as well as possible burials and even possible public spaces or plazas that were
previously unknown and remain unexcavated at the present time (Walker and McKinnon 2012).

The 115 radiocarbon dates from a number of cultural features at the George C. Davis site (Story and
Valastro 1977) can be combined into three groups (Table 1 and Figure 3) of 2 sigma calibrated age range
with all but two calibrated dates falling in Groups 1 and 2. For the 47 Group 1 calibrated dates, the highest
probability (64 percent) is in the A.D. 940-995 range, at the end of the Formative Caddo period (ca. A.D.
800-1000). The combined Group 2 calibrated age range of 66 date is A.D. 1185-1258, at the latter end of the
Early Caddo period (ca. A.D. 1000-1200) and the first part of the Middle Caddo period (ca. A.D. 1200-1400).
On the basis of the present set of calibrated and combined radiocarbon dates from the George C. Davis site,
the overall Caddo occupation there took place between A.D. 940-1258.

Documentation of the Ceramic Vessels
Archaeological investigations at the George C. Davis site since the late 1930s-eartly 1940s have recovered
47 Caddo vessels or vessel sections that are in the collections of the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
at The University of Texas at Austin. The majority of the vessels (n=27, 57 percent) are from the 1939-1941
WPA investigations in and around Mound A and immediately adjacent village areas (see Newell and Krieger
1949, 2000; Story 2000). Another 28 percent are from 1968-1970 University of Texas investigations in Mounds
B and C (Story 1997, 1998), four vessels (8.5 percent) are from 1978 University of Texas investigations in
village areas (Thurmond and Kleinschmidt 1979), and the remaining three vessels are from miscellaneous
contexts. All of the vessels are associated with Early Caddo period Alto phase archaeological deposits and
cultural features.
1939-1941 WPA Investigations
The vessels from the 1939-1941 WPA investigations are not from burial features, but are reconstructed
from sherds deposited in archaeological deposits in or below Mound A, the large platform mound at the George
C. Davis site, or in Caddo structures adjacent to Mound A. This includes two vessels found stratigraphically
between Feature 37, an oval house built in a depression or pit (Newell and Krieger 1949:35), and a later
house (Feature 31) built over the earlier oval house; another vessel in Feature 33, a large circular house that
“lay about half in the village area and half under the mound” (Newell and Krieger 1949:35); and a Crockett
Curvilinear Incised vessel in Feature 42, a structure in the village area (Newell and Krieger 1949:44). Four
other vessels are from Feature 5 in the Inner Village at the site, just north of Feature 3, an oval-shaped house,
and south of Mound A (see Newell and Krieger 1949:Figure 4). This was a ”concentration of broken pottery…
possibly piled in a shallow pit” (Newell and Krieger 1949:52).

1968-1970 University of Texas Excavations
The University of Texas excavations at the George C. Davis site between 1968-1970 focused on village
areas, Mound B (built ca. A.D. 1200), and Mound C, the burial mound at the site (Story 1997, 1998). Ceramic
vessels were recovered in several burial features in Mound C: two vessels each from Feature 119 (four adults)
and Feature 155 (one adult) in Stage II; one vessel in Feature 152 (two adults, one juvenile, and one child)
in either Stage III or Stage IV; one vessel in Feature 154 in Stage IV; and one or two vessels in three burial
features (Feature 106, Feature 107, and Feature 156) in Stage V of the mound. Two vessels were recovered
in the Mound B excavations, one in the fill, and the other from sub-mound contexts.

Summary and Conclusions
The 47 vessels and vessel sections from the George C. Davis site (41CE19) in the collections of the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory include fine wares, utility wares, and plain wares. These vessels
are from a variety of mound (Mound A and B) and non-mound habitation features, as well as vessels from a
series of elite burials with single to multiple numbers of individuals in Mound C; these burials also contain
an assortment of other kinds of locally made and non-locally obtained funerary offerings.
There are five vessel forms in the vessel assemblage, about equally divided between bottles, bowls, jars,
and carinated bowls (Table 1). The bottles are exclusively fine ware forms, while at least one or two of the
three wares are represented in the other four vessel forms. Plain wares (Bowles Creek Plain) comprise 8.5
percent of the vessel assemblage, and utility wares (Crockett Curvilinear Incised, Davis Incised, Dunkin
Incised, Duren Neck Banded, Kiam Incised, Pennington Punctated-Incised, and Weches Fingernail Impressed,
var. Weches) account for another 34 percent of the vessel assemblage. The remaining 57 percent are fine
wares, including Holy Fine Engraved, Hickory Engraved, a red-slipped vessel, and an unidentified engravedpinched jar (Table 1).

Bowls are most frequently represented among Holly Fine Engraved vessels, while jars are most common
among the Bowles Creek Plain, Dunkin Incised, and Weches Fingernail Impressed, var. Weches vessels. The
carinated bowls in the assemblage are almost exclusively Holly Fine Engraved and Pennington PunctatedIncised vessels, and the one compound bowl is a Crockett Curvilinear Incised vessel (see Table 1).
The vessels at the George C. Davis site are almost exclusively tempered with grog (i.e., crushed sherds
or pieces of fired clay) (Table 2): 97.9 percent of the vessels have grog temper. Two other grog-tempered
vessels also have had crushed pieces of burned bone added to the paste, and four vessels had crushed pieces
of hematite or ferruginous sandstone added to the paste during vessel manufacture. Only one vessel (2.1
percent of the vessel assemblage) is tempered solely with crushed and burned pieces of bone.

About 27 percent of the engraved fine ware vessels in the George C. Davis vessel assemblage have had
red hematite-rich (n=6) or white kaolin (n=1) clay pigments added to the engraved decorative elements. This
includes one Hickory Engraved jar, three Holly Fine Engraved bottles, two Holly Fine Engraved bowls, and
one Holly Fine Engraved carinated bowl. The red pigments were clearly preferred by the Caddo potters at
the George C. Davis site, particularly on Holly Fine Engraved vessels.
According to Bobby Gonzalez of the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma (April 2008 personal communication),
“the red pigment means life and is very sacred among the Caddo. The red pigment is now used on peyote
staffs, and during ritual ceremonies and prayer meetings, the red pigment is painted on and in the ears as
well as on the top of the head in the middle of a man’s hair line, running from front to back; the women and
men paint themselves in the morning when the sun comes up.” Vessels found in features in and around the
Mound A platform mound, and in burial features in Mound C, with a red pigment likely are from vessels
that symbolize life and its sacredness to the Caddo. It is possible that the red pigment seen on vessels placed
in Caddo burials at the George C. Davis site may have been added to the vessels shortly before they were
placed in graves with the deceased.

Caddo Vessels from the Susie Slade Site (41HS13),
Harrison County, Texas
Timothy K. Perttula
Introduction
The Susie Slade site (41HS13) is an ancestral Nadaco Caddo settlement and cemetery on a sandy knoll in
the Potters Creek valley in the Sabine River basin (Figure 1). The site is known to have had a large cemetery
(> 90 burials) that was excavated by a number of East Texas collectors and amateur archaeologists in 1962
(see Webb et al. 1969:8), University of Texas (UT) archaeologists (Scurlock 1962), and Buddy Calvin Jones
(1968:98-125); one burial reportedly had 36 stacked Simms Engraved vessels as funerary offerings. Ceramic
vessels from the UT investigations at the Susie Slade site are in the collections of the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL), along with vessels donated to TARL by Forrest Murphey, one of the amateur
archaeologists that worked at the site. These vessels are documented in this article, following the standard
protocol for vessel documentation in use for several years in the analysis of Caddo ceramic vessels from
East Texas sites.

Archaeological Context

The burials at the Susie Slade site were reportedly spaced from 1.8-4 m apart, and they were oriented
in extended supine position in east-west pits, with the head of the deceased facing to the west or southwest
(Jones 1968:102). The UT investigations in 1962 excavated two burials at the site: Burial 4 and Burial 5
(Scurlock 1962). Burial 4 did not have any ceramic vessel funerary offerings, but did have 15 marine shell
beads, seven blue glass beads, and one triangular Fresno arrow point. The UT vessels documented herein
are from Burial 5, and other funerary offerings in this burial included nine blue glass beads, 10 marine shell
beads, and one marine shell disk bead (Scurlock 1962
Three radiocarbon dates have been recently obtained from the Susie Slade site, dating organic residue
on a La Rue Neck Banded jar and an incised-punctated jar from two different Caddo burials excavated by
Jones (Perttula and Selden 2014, 2015). The median calibrated dates for all three samples range between A.D.
1769-1774, and the likeliest probabilities of the three dates overlap between A.D. 1720-1811. The calibrated
dates clearly support the notion that the occupation of the Susie Slade site by the Nadaco Caddo took place
during much of the Historic Caddo period.

Summary and Conclusions
The TARL collections have nine ceramic vessels from the Nadaco Caddo Susie Slade site (41HS13),
including five vessels from a burial feature excavated by UT archaeologists that dates from the early 18th to
early 19th century that also had European glass trade beads. The vessels include several fine wares: Simms
Engraved, var. Darco, Simms Engraved, Taylor Engraved, cf. Ripley Engraved, var. Pilgrims, and Ripley
Engraved, var. unspecified. There also is a miniature engraved bottle of undetermined type. The utility wares
in the small vessel assemblage include jars of Emory Punctated-Incised, Karnack Brushed-Incised, and an
unidentified incised-punctated vessel. The vessels are tempered with grog (56 percent), grog and bone (11
percent), bone (22 percent), and shell (11 percent).
Of the 22 ceramic vessels reported by Jones (1968:Table 3) from the Susie Slade burials, there are 13
ceramic vessels that can be identified from these burials in the collections at the Gregg County Historical
Museum (Perttula et al. 2014). Utility wares in the Buddy Jones collections from the Susie Slade burials
include La Rue Neck Banded and Emory Punctated-Incised. Fine wares are comprised of Natchitoches
Engraved (n=3 vessels), a post-A.D. 1685 ceramic ware, Simms Engraved, Simms Engraved, var. Darco,
a Hood Engraved effigy vessel, and Ripley Engraved, var. Pilgrims (Perttula et al. 2014:32-47). This set of
vessels is tempered with grog (92 percent) and grog and bone (8 percent).

Caddo Vessels from the W. O. Ziegler Farm (41WD30)
and Claude Burkett (41WD30) Sites in the Upper
Sabine River Basin in Wood County, Texas
Timothy K. Perttula
Introduction
Caddo ceramic vessels were collected at the W. O. Ziegler Farm (41WD30) and Claude Burkett (41WD31)
sites in 1930 during archaeological investigations in Wood County by The University of Texas (Wilson and
Jackson 1930). The one vessel from the W. O. Ziegler Farm site, located in the Lake Fork Creek drainage in
the upper Sabine River basin (Figure 1), was found in 1918 at a depth of ca. 1.2 m by the landowner while
digging a storm cellar. University of Texas archaeologists purchased the vessel in August 1930.

The Claude Burkett site is in the Big Sandy Creek basin in the upper Sabine River basin (see Figure 1).
The landowner found two ceramic vessels after a heavy rain had eroded them from the site. University of
Texas archaeologists also purchased these vessels in August 1930. Wilson and Jackson (1930) excavated a
few test trenches at the site at that time, but did not recover any more vessels. They did note that ceramic
sherds were present in small amounts between ca. 15-30 cm bs in the test trenches.

Summary and Conclusions
The three Caddo ceramic vessels from the W. O. Ziegler (41WD30) and Claude Burkett (41WD31) sites
in the upper Sabine River basin are grog-tempered, and each was fired in a reducing environment and cooled
in the open air. The vessels from the Claude Burkett site are from a Middle Caddo period (ca. A.D. 12001400) component based on the identification of a Sanders Engraved carinated bowl. The bottle from the W.
O. Ziegler Farm site is a Late Caddo period, Titus phase (ca. A.D. 1430-1680), Ripley Engraved type with a
scroll and circle motif that features equal-arm cross decorative elements.
