SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION
The Celeron/All American Pipeline (AAPL), McCamey to Webster, will be a 30inch heated crude oil pipeline approximately 512 miles long and buried an average
depth of 6 ft. For the purpose of construction, the right-of-way (ROW) will be 100 ft.
except in special function areas, such as pump stations, where additional tracts are
needed. The permanent ROW will be 50 ft. on State and Federal lands and 50 ft. or
less on private property.
In May and June, 1988, the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TAAL),
The University of Texas at Austin, conducted intensive survey and limited site testing
between milepost 1088. 1 and 1133.9 along the approved AAPL ROW from McCamey
to Webster, Texas (Map). All work was conducted in accordance with the provisions
of both the Programmatic Memorandum of Agreement between the Bureau of Land
Management (BLM), the State Historic Preservation Officers (SHPO) in California,
Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, and Celeron/All American Pipeline Company (AAPL)
and the Record of Decision (ROD). Work on State-owned lands was authorized by a
permit issued by the Texas Antiquities Committee.
This document is the first of a series of proposed Treatment Program Documents
that describe the findings and measures needed to reach maximum data recovery
(MOR) for each segment of the AAPL route as described in the Cultural Resource Plan
(CAP) approved by THC and BLM in May 1988. This treatment program focuses on
the first 45-mile stretch from McCamey to Big Lake, Texas, beginning at the Mesa Tank
Farm in Upton County (Mile Marker 1189+1875') and extending to SH 137 in Reagan
County (Mile Marker 1134 + 1427').

Fifteen sites, consisting of two historic sites, eleven prehistoric sites, and two sites
with both historic and prehistoric components were recorded during initial acquisition
survey and subsequent centerline staking survey (Table 1). The latter was augmented
by subsurface shovel probing and collection strategies as described in the PMOA,
ROD and CAP. The relevance of the located sites to the research questions detailed
in the CRP is addressed in Table 1. The work conducted to date is considered sufficient to mitigate the effects of pipeline construction at all the recorded sites except
41 RG23, a buried hearth field adjacent to Big Lake Draw. A plan for final treatment of
41 RG23 is presented in this document.
This treatment plan document is organized into nine sections: 1) introductory
material; 2) setting; 3) methods; 4) historic component descriptions and proposed
treatments; 5) prehistoric components and proposed treatments; 6) geomorphic
analyses designed to identify areas for trench monitoring during construction; 7) a
summary of the findings within this 45-mile segment; 8) references cited; and 9) supporting documentation consisting of site forms, artifact inventories and other
supplementary information.

SECTION 2: SETTING
Environmental Background

Upton and Reagan counties are considered part of the Edwards Plateau region
of Texas but they are immediately adjacent to the High Plains, the Lower or Rolling
Plains and the Trans-Pecos or Mountain and Basin regions (Gould 1975; Biesaart,
Roberson and Spotts 1985). The climate is semi-arid averaging less than 15 inches a
year. The modern vegetation is invasive mesquite scrub, except in areas maintained
for grazing. Modern land use has undoubtedly degraded the environment from the
grasslands reported by early settlers. No permanent water sources are found in the
study area; the major hydrological feature, Big Lake, has filled about once every 20
years in modern times, the last time in the early 1970s. Presumably, the lake was a
more reliable water source during mesic periods of prehistory. More detailed geomorphic information is reported in Section 4.

Historical Background

Upton and Reagan counties are located in a region of West Texas that was
traversed by explorers and transcontinental migrants long before the construction of
rail lines or the establishment of settlements. The most celebrated expedition to pass
through the general vicinity was that led by Francisco Vazquez de Coronado in the
early 1540s. Driven by reports of golden cities in present New Mexico, Coronado had
little interest in the lands of West Texas. Over a century later, in 1650, captain Diego
del Castillo and Hernan Martin directed an expedition from Santa Fe across West Texas

4

to the Concho River, then known as the Nueces. Operating under the authority of the
New Mexico governor, General Hernando de Ugarte y la Concha, the group surveyed
the territory for natural resources that would prove beneficial to the crown. Their
reports, which included the discovery of fresh-water pearls in the Concho, resulted in
a similar expedition 4 years later under the leadership of Diego de Guadalajara
(Conkling and Conkling 1947).
Accompanying Guadalajara on his 1654 expedition was a young officer named
Juan Domfnguez de Mendoza. In 1685, Mendoza again traversed the region when he
provided military leadership for a missionary expedition to the Jumano Indians along
the Concho River. On the journey, Fray Nicholas Lopez supervised the establishment
of Mission San Clemente near the confluence of the Concho and Colorado rivers
(Conkling and Conkling 1947, Vol. I: 355; Webb 1952, Vol 11:172). Later expeditions
across the West Texas region in the general vicinity of Upton and Reagan counties
included those led by Pedro Vial (1786-1787) and Jose Mares (1787-1788). Both Vial
and Mares were commissioned by the Spanish government to establish a viable trade
route between Santa Fe and San Antonio (Conkling and Conkling 1947, Vol. I: 355;
Webb 1952, Vol. 11:142, 838).
The scarcity of reliable water sources and the hostility of the Indians, including
such notable warriors as the Comanche, proved obstacles to settlement until well into
the nineteenth century. Generally, the earliest Anglo-Americans to visit the area were
traders en route to Santa Fe or gold-seekers journeying to California and Colorado.
A secondary group was comprised of open-range cattlemen who sometimes followed
their drifting herds into the territory. Fort Concho was established in 1867 to counter
the Indian menace; Grierson Springs in Reagan County was an outpost that housed
the famous Buffalo Soldiers on their scouting missions through the study area (Haley

5

1952). It was not until pacification of the Indians and the subsequent construction of
rail lines that the area became open to permanent settlement. The development of
barbed wire, windmills, and dry land farming practices combined to move the frontier
west. Settlers began arriving in present Upton and Reagan counties as early as the
1880s (Eagleton 1971; Werst 1974:1-19, 42-43).
By 1903, the number of settlers in the region influenced the Texas legislature to
create Reagan County from Tom Green County. The community of Stiles served as
the first county seat. In 1935, two years after the opening of the extensive Big Lake
Oil Field, the railroad town of Big Lake became the new seat of government. The Santa
Rita discovery well, drilled on University of Texas lands, dictated dramatic changes in
the state's higher education system and the development of the Reagan County area.
Within days, tent towns sprang up and wildcat drilling operations became common
sights along the prairie (Webb 1952, Vol. II: 825; Schwettmann 1941:30-37). In 1926,
wildcatter George McCamey drilled a successful well in southwestern Upton County.
Founded in 1920, with the community of Upland as county seat, Upton County also
became an important early center for oil production. The town of Rankin became the
new seat of government in 1921 (Webb 1952, Vol. 11:445). Today, oil and cattle
production provide the economic foundation for both Reagan and Upton counties.
Only minimal tracts of land are now devoted to farming.
Although the study area was the scene of dramatic events during the Spanish
Colonial and later Anglo expansion periods, remains from the 1920s oil boom are the
dominant site type expected along the AAPL ROW.. The present route passes just
south of the boom-and-bust towns of Best and Texan. These abandoned communities
demonstrate that the common response to depopulation was the transport of extant

6

buildings to new locations, leaving only foundations and trash to mark the site of oncethriving population centers.

Archeological Background
Upton and Reagan counties are included in the Central Texas cultural area (Brown
et al. 1982), as well as the Panhandle Plains Region (Suhm, Krieger and Jelks 1954).
The area is transitional between the Trans-Pecos, Lower Pecos, Southern Plains, and
Central Texas regions. No cultural chronology has been specifically constructed for
this region but the four broad periods used throughout Texas-Paleoindian, Archaic,
Late Prehistoric and Historic-are represented by artifacts recovered in this survey
and by local collectors. Specific projectile point types and ceramics can be related to
more refined chronologies devised for the Central Texas (Prewitt 1981) and the Lower
Pecos (Dibble, cited in Turpin 1985: Fig. 4) regions.

Local Research
No formal archeological studies have been reported in the vicinity of the approved
AAPL route. Only ten sites have been recorded in Upton County, one as a result of
prior AAPL survey (41UT10). A.T. Jackson (1938: Site 53) recorded a pictograph site
north of McCamey, later assigned the trinomial 41 UT1. Sites 41 UT2, 41 UT3, 41 UT8
and 41 UT9 are a petroglyph-mortar complex approximately 1 mile north of the All
American Pipeline route on Rankin Draw. Sites 41UT4, 41UT6 and 41UT7 are rock
shelters; 41UT4 yielded a complete human burial. Rockshelters 41 UT6 and 41 UT7 are
1 and 2 miles north of the AAPL route respectively. Site 41 UT5 was described as three
sotol pits and 41UT10, near the Crockett-Upton county line, is a large burned rock

7

midden-hearth field with projectile points more characteristic of the Lower Pecos region
to the south than of Central Texas types.
Although the trinomial series for Reagan County shows twelve previously
recorded sites, only four are documented in the TAAL county site files. The remainder
were reserved by Mayer-Oaks for a Texas Tech contract project in northern Reagan
County but no site forms have been filed. Three of the four recorded sites are historic:
the Telegraph Overland Stage Station; the Centralia Station with grave; and Grierson
Springs, the site of a military outpost of Ft. Concho, in service from 1875 to 1882. The
sole prehistoric site, 41 RG4, is a complex of burned rock hearths, a quarry, a lithic
scatter and petroglyphs on Centralia Draw across from 41 AG1, the Telegraph Overland Stage Station.
In terms of prehistoric site types anticipated (CAP 1988), the current sample of
previously recorded sites in Upton and Reagan counties is dominated by rock art (6),
rockshelters (3) and burned rock features (2). Multi-functional sites are petroglyphmortars and petroglyph, burned rock, quarry and mortar complexes. All the recorded
historic sites are special purpose sites (see CAP) related to early Anglo expansion into
the region in the mid-nineteenth century. It is immediately obvious that the avocational archeologists who reported most of these sites were attracted to the spectacular so
the known site inventory can not be considered representative of the entire range of
either historic or prehistoric cultural remains in this region.

SECTION 3: METHODS
Initial fieldwork consisted of one archeologist attached to each AAPL acquisition
survey team. The objective was reconnaissance survey to identify cultural properties
that could be avoided prior to final purchase of easements. Sites were recorded on
the basis of surface-exposed cultural material only during this phase of the project.
The second phase, centerline staking survey, was conducted by a team of two
archeologists who conducted shovel probing and surface collection after approval of
the Cultural Resource Plan. Zigzag transects spaced no less than 15 meters apart
were walked following the staked ROW; all high probability areas were shovel-probed
for buried deposits. Shovel probes were also dug to verify the absence of sites in low
probability areas. Maximal data recovery techniques described in the CAP were implemented on all recorded sites. Shovel probes were dug to determine the presence
of subsurface deposits where possible. The majority of the sites in the McCamey to
Big Lake ROW were completely collected without achieving the 100 lithic artifact goal
set in the CAP. Only 41 RG16 and 41 RG24 provided sufficient artifact density to warrant the collection of 4x4 meter units.
A records and document search demonstrated that no previously recorded sites
are within the approved AAPL route and no sites eligible for the National Register of
Historic Places would be affected by construction {TAAL and Texas Historical
Commission files). Concomitant with the field work, archival research was conducted
and a general history of the region compiled. County historical committee chairpersons were contacted and museums in Rankin and Big Lake were visited. Local

9

informants were interviewed and private artifact and photographic collections were examined.
All recorded sites were classified according to categories established in the CAP
and evaluated as described in the PMOA. In addition, criteria for National Register of
Historic Places eligibility were applied. All properties on State lands can be designated
State Archeological Landmarks. Collected materials have been processed through
laboratory procedures in preparation for analysis and curation when appropriate. All
artifacts and records generated by this project are currently housed at TAAL and available for inspection.
Fieldwork was accomplished by W. Weaver, K. Kleinbach, G. Mehalchick and A.
Hobbs under the direct supervision of L. Bement. Collected historic artifacts were
identified by H. Moncure; oral histories and archival research were performed by D.
Utley. Geomorphic studies were conducted by C. Garan. The principal investigator,
S. Turpin, and the cultural resource consultant, L. Heartfield, oversaw all aspects of
the fieldwork and preliminary analyses.

SECTION 4: HISTORIC SITES
The three historic sites recorded within the pipeline 100-ft corridor are all artifact
scatters consisting largely of broken glass, crockery, metal fragments, and nails, the
residue of domestic and ranching activities. One, 41UT14, has a minor prehistoric component.

A fourth site, 41 RG25, is a prehistoric campsite with a lesser historic

component, an admixture from a nearby ranchstead. With the exception of a few scattered burned rocks, 41 RG25 is outside the pipeline ROW. All the historic sites and
components were identified during centerline staking survey; none proved to have
buried components when shovel probed.

Site No: 41UT13

AAPL No: 193-12-1
USGS Quad: Rankin
Description: Site 41UT13 lies generally south of the community of Rankin on a
flat area west of a series of hills. A windmill stands about 200 meters north of the site.
Two ranch roads intersect and pass west and south of 41UT13 but neither appears to
have led directly to the site.
This historic artifact scatter consists of domestic glassware and cans with a slight
admixture of building materials. The dispersal of cultural material across the surface
of the ROW is more suggestive of a former house site than a trash dump. Building
materials were scarce, limited to a Standard brick, manufactured from 1914 to today,
and one fragment of window glass. Part of a metal bed frame was noted. Collected
artifacts and their diagnostic value are: lavender glass sherds dating to the 1920s and

11
------------

earlier; a hole-in-top can made not earlier than 1900 but gaining popularity in the 1920s;
and a crown closure with pressed cork dating no earlier than 1916.
Disposition: MOR, archival and informant research

Site No: 41 UT14

AAPL No: 193-10-1
USGS Quad: Rankin
Description: Site 41UT14 lies south and east of the intersection of Highways 67
and 349, west of Rankin. A ranch road terminates at a windmill approximately 40
meters northwest of the site.
This historic scatter extends into the ROW from a denser accumulation south
south-east of the ROW. Construction materials, such as Standard brick (see above),
cut limestone and nails, and domestic debris, such as glass, crockery and tin cans,
suggest a former house site. Collected artifacts include wire nails (not earlier than
1890 but uncommon until after World War I in West Texas); a porcelain-lined cap that
served as a canning jar lid (not earlier than 1890 but in use today); a hole-in-top can
(not earlier than 1900 but common after 1920); and an Owens scar on a bottle base
(1930-1950s).

The small sample of prehistoric lithic material found on this site is

described under Section 3.
Disposition: MOR, archival and informant research.

Site No: 41 RG24

AAPL No: 195-1-1
USGS Quad: Texan

12

Description: Site 41 RG24 lies on the west side of a north-south ranch road, 1.5
miles southwest of the abandoned community of Texan. Construction materials from
a fully dismantled wooden structure (boards, wire nails and wooden piers) and concrete foundations are surrounded by a light scatter of milk glass, undecorated
whitewares, window glass, machine-made brick, tin cans, canning jars, milk bottles,
metal fragments and a 1931 Texas license plate. One L-shaped concrete foundation
and a concrete slab, 8 by 4 meters in dimension, with a trough down the center are
accompanied by a dense accumulation of broken milk bottles.

The bottles were

machine made and required an inset cap. A windmill stands some 60 meters south of
the site. The area is heavily deflated. Collected artifacts are an Akra Agate marble
dated to about 1925, and valve-marked milk bottle bases in favor between the 1930s
to 1950s.
Disposition: MOR, archival and informant research

Site No: 41 RG25
AAPL No: 197-1.5-4
USGS Quad: Big Lake
Description: Site 41 RG25 lies 2.5 miles west of Kemper Station on the south
(right) bank of Big Lake Draw. The site is predominantly a prehistoric burned rock and
lithic scatter outside the ROW. The prehistoric component is described in Section 5.
The historic component consists of a bulldozed trash dump composed of electrical
parts, domestic glassware, brick and miscellaneous metal fragments. The dump is
probably associated with a ranch stead 300 meters north of the site. Collected artifacts
include a green pattern glass celery dish lid manufactured by the late pressing process,
ca. the 1930s, and an open wire insulator dating between 1915 and the 1930s.

13

Disposition: Outside ROW, no action.

Discussion: Historic Sites
All the historic sites in the AAPL ROW are best categorized under the CRP classification as habitation sites. Only one, 41 UT14, retains features related to husbandry.
The remains consist of concrete foundations and debris from a dismantled building.
All diagnostic materials date to the 1920s or later, symptomatic of the oil boom years
in this region. None of the sites retain intact buried deposits so MOR was achieved
by surface collection of diagnostic materials and 4x4 meter sample units. None of the
historic sites meet criteria for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places
and only 41 RG25 is on State property, thus qualifying for designation as a State
Archeological Landmark. The significance of these three sites is their role in the larger
settlement patterns of the historic period, a topic-best addressed through archival and
library research.
Tenant structures, built during the 1920s oil boom in this region, are difficult to
trace in the county land and tax records. Their legal anonymity may be obviated
through the use of local informants who recall the outward appearance of the structures, their function and their inhabitants.

14

SECTION 5: PREHISTORIC SITES
Thirteen prehistoric sites, two with historic components, were recorded during
acquisition and centerline survey. The sites fall under the categories listed in the CAP
as Lithic Scatters, Surface (3), Artifact Scatters, Surface (7), and Artifact Scatters, Subsurface (3). Lithic Scatters, Surface consist solely of culturally modified stone that lack
depth of deposits. The category Artifact Scatters, Surface encompasses a broader
range of cultural material, including lithics, burned rock, ceramics, shell and other artifacts with no depth of deposits. Artifact Scatters, Subsurface exhibit similar artifact
inventories but retain buried cultural deposits.
Factors other than cultural resources mandated a reroute of the pipeline around
41 UT11, a lithic scatter (Lithic Scatter, Surface). With the exception of a few scattered
burned rocks, 41 RG25, a hearth field with lithic scatter (Artifact Scatter, Surface), is
outside the ROW.

Lithic Scatters, Surface (3)
SITE NO: 41 UT11

AAPL No: 193-8-1
USGS Quad: Square Top Mountain/Rankin
Description: During acquisition survey, burned rock and an associated lithic scatter were noted in the ROW on an open flat 1 mile east of Fivemile Creek. Artifacts
noted at that time were one end scraper, two secondary flakes and ten tertiary flakes
The pipeline was subsequently rerouted, avoiding 41 UT11.

Reexamination during

centerline survey determined that the burned rock was interspersed with heavy metal

15

cable, eliminating its designation as a prehistoric feature. The land clearing episode
that probably produced the burned rock is too recent and insignificant to warrant designation of this component as a historic site.
Disposition: Avoidance

SITE NO: 41UT14

AAPL No: 193-10-1
USGS Quad: Rankin
Description: Site 41UT14 is an historic artifact scatter found during centerline survey of the ROW south of Highway 67, east of its intersection with Highway 349. The
prehistoric component consists of four chert artifacts: a large oval biface, a secondary flake uniface and two flakes. Remote from a reliable water supply, the site is not
optimal for. prehistoric occupation and the origin of these materials remains undetermined.
Disposition: MOR

SITE NO: 41RG16

AAPL No: 196-1-1
USGS Quad: Rankin
Description: Recorded during acquisition survey, 41RG16 is a natural chert outcrop following the crest, slope and base of a mesa that forms the divide between the
Pecos and Concho drainages. Cores and all classes of debitage extend 560 meters
along the ROW. The chert is fine-grained and ranges from various shades of brown
to dappled in color. The artifacts are most concentrated on the slopes and at the base
of the mesa on the western end of the ROW where material has been transported

16
-------

-

--~

downslope. The majority of the debitage is composed of large primary and secondary flakes but one polyhedral core reflects late prehistoric blade technology (Turner
and Hester 1985). Two bifaces and one triangular dart point probably of Late Archaic
age were collected in addition to a 4x4 meter unit.
Disposition: MOR

DISCUSSION: LITHIC SCATTERS, SURFACE

Using terminology outlined in the CRP, only one of these lithic scatters can be
considered a special purpose site. The largest surficial lithic scatter, 41 RG16, is a
chert quarry characterized by flakes, blades and cores eroding from the divide between the Pecos and Concho drainages (see Section 5: Geomorphic Studies). Its
proximity to Big Lake, however, suggests it provided a convenient raw material source
for the occupants of the playa perimeter. The collected Hthic sample reflects both blade
and flake technologies. Apparently use of the site ranged from the procurement of
raw materials through all stages of the manufacture of stone tools exemplified by an
almost complete gouge and a finished Late Archaic dart point. Although temporal
components can not be isolated, the blade technology evidenced by a polyhedral core,
is generally considered to be late in the prehistoric sequence (Turner and Hester 1985).
Comparison of the raw materials from 41RG16 and the lithics sampled from the other
sites recorded along the ROW indicates that local materials were exploited for stone
tool production.
Minor ambiguity lies in the classification of 41 UT11 as a surficial lithic scatter due
to the presence of some burned rock reported on the site form. The burned rock is
probably historic in origin, the result of land clearing. The limited range and number

17

of artifacts at this site suggests it was a single episode campsite, perhaps occupied
by a very small group of people while in transit from better watered environments.
The last lithic scatter is the prehistoric component of 41UT14, described in the
Historic Sites section of this document. The prehistoric component consists of four
lithic artifacts, collected during sampling of the historic cultural material. The origin of
these prehistoric artifacts is uncertain given the extent of modern disturbances to the
site area. Material types appear to be locally derived but the site location offers few
inducements for prehistoric occupation.
In summary, none of the recorded lithic scatters holds the potential to contribute
to an understanding of regional prehistory beyond the information gained by site
recording. The lithic raw material collected from 41RG16 provides a reference sample
for comparison of materials recovered from the other sites in the region. Therefore,
MOR has been achieved at all surficial lithic scatters in the ROW and none are considered eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. By virtue of their
location on University of Texas lands, 41 UT11 and 41 RG16 qualify as State
Archeological Landmarks.

Artifact Scatters, Surf ace (7)
SITE NO: 41 UT12

AAPL No: 193-11-1
USGS Quad: Rankin
Description: Site 41UT12 was first noted during acquistion survey. An extremely light scatter of burned rock and chert flakes was observed on a small, natural outcrop
of inferior chert nodules. The site was reevaluated during centerline survey. No buried
deposits were detected in shovel probes and the total collection of artifacts from the

18

ROW consisted of five chert flakes. The raw material is not suitable for stone tool
production due to its blocky structure and small nodule size. The small drainageway
adjacent to the site is not capable of providing a reliable water source; the conclusion
is 41UT12 was a temporary campsite occupied by a very small number of people.
Disposition: MOR

SITE NO: 41RG15

AAPL No: 195-1-2
USGS Quad: Rankin
Description: One hearth, a Ught scatter of burned rock and an assortment of lithic
artifacts were recorded during acquisition survey along the banks of a minor
drainageway that eventually flows into the Middle Concho River. The full range of
debitage classes, cores, thick bifaces, an end-and-side scraper and a unifacial blade
scraper were noted at that time. Subsequent centerline survey ascertained that only
one small portion of the site was contained within the ROW. Collected artifacts include
one uniface, six secondary flakes, one tertiary flake and one chip. Shovel probing in
the ROW was negative but some subsurface deposits may be retained on the larger
portion of the site outside the ROW. Given the scarcity of water, it is unlikely that long
term occupation could have been sustained at this location.
Disposition: MOR

SITE NO: 41 RG17

AAPL No: 198-2-1
Quad Map: Big Lake

19

Description: This burned rock and lithic scatter is part of an extensive site complex that lines the margins of Big Lake and its feeder drainages. This site was recorded
during centerline survey along the upper margins of the playa on the more ancient stabilized dune surface.

The majority of the burned rock is limestone with a slight

admixture of sandstone. Collected artifacts include one Late Archaic (Marshall-like)
dart point (Turner and Hester 1985), a biface midsection, two uniface fragments, one
utilized flake and 21 flakes and chips.

Five shovel tests produced no subsurface

SITE NO: 41RG18

AAPL No: 198-2-2
USGS Quad: Big Lake
Description: 41RG18 is very similar to 41RG17 in setting and material culture. On
the northern upper margins of the playa, on the old stabilized dune, a light scatter of
burned rock and lithic artifacts was recorded during centerline survey. Only one of
seven shovel probes produced a few fragments of burned rock beneath the surface.
Collected artifacts include one Marshall-like and one untyped stemmed dart points,
one two-beveled knife fragment, one biface midsection, two steeply beveled end
scrapers, one uniface, six utilized flakes and nine flakes and chips.

The steeply

beveled end scrapers and two-beveled knife are characteristic of the Late Prehistoric
Period, lnfierno Phase in the Lower Pecos River region (Bement and Turpin 1986) indicating at least two components are represented in the surface assemblage at
41 RG18.

Description: A light scatter of burned rock and lithic artifacts was recorded south
of the centerline in the ROW bordering Big Lake Draw during centerline survey. The
site lies at the base of a gradual rise where gullying and sheetwash may have
redeposited much of the cultural material. The artifact inventory included the distal tip
of a biface, one thick biface, one large uniface and flakes.

Description: During centerline survey, a light scatter of burned rock, one concentration of burned rock, and lithic artifacts were recorded on the south (right) side
of Big Lake Draw across from site 41 RG23. Shovel probes yielded only one flake between 15 and 20 ems below the surface. Artifacts collected from the ROW include one
Palmillas and one untyped dart points, four bifaces, one end/side scraper, two cores,
two utilized flakes and 35 pieces of debitage. 41 RG22 is part of the extensive hearth
field along both sides of Big Lake Draw; the major differences are in degree of exposure
and integrity of deposits, both functions of post-depositional disturbance.

SITE NO: 41 RG25
AAPL No: 197-1.5-4
USGS Quad: Best
Description: A few pieces of burned rock in the ROW, noted during centerline survey, led to the recording of 41 RG25, south and west of the ROW on the north (left)
bank of Big Lake Draw, across from 41 RG21. Burned rock and chert artifacts are
distributed along the margins of the draw. No temporal diagnostics were identified by
survey, and shovel probes placed near the draw were negative. It is concluded that
the site is outside the ROW and will not be affected by construction of the pipeline. A
historic trash dump associated with an extant house and barn is described under the
Historic Sites section of this document.
Disposition: Outside of ROW, no action

DISCUSSION: ARTIFACT SCATTERS, SURFACE
The surficial artifact scatters are all habitation sites in the CAP site typology.
These seven sites were characterized by surface exposures of lithic debitage, tools
and burned rock. The latter dominates the cultural material inventory from all sites.
Presumably, much of the burned rock once constituted prehistoric hearths but an admixture from modern clearing is evidenced by the remnants of burned brush piles
common throughout the study area. All these sites are on deflated surfaces and have
been seriously disturbed by modern land use. Stone tool manufacturing by-products
all compare favorably with the raw material sample collected from 41AG16; no exotics
were identified. In a more qualitative typology, all but one of the Artifact Scatters, Surface (41 RG15), as well as the Artifact Scatters, Subsurface, would be classified as
hearth fields (Turpin 1982), further discussed in the summary of the prehistoric sites

22

section. None of the recorded surficial artifact scatters retain the integrity to contribute
to regional prehistory beyond the information gained by their recording. Therefore,
MOR has been achieved at all the sites classed as Artifact Scatters, Surface in this segment of the ROW. None of these sites meet criteria for nomination to the National
Register of Historic Places but all, by virtue of their location on public lands qualify for
State Archeological Landmark Status.

Artifact Scatters, Subsurface (3)
With the exception of buried features noted outside the ROW on 41 RG21, only
41RG19 and 41 RG23 retained alluvial, eolian and colluvial sediments sufficient to bury
hearths and lithic artifacts.

SITE NO: 41RG19

AAPL No: 197-1.5-1
Quad Map: Best
Description: 41 RG19 is the first in a series of sites recorded at AAPL crossings
of Big Lake Draw. 41RG19 lies at the confluence of a small south bank tributary and
the draw where burned rock and chert artifacts are scattered over a broad area.
Shovel probes produced flakes and burned rock to a depth of 25 ems but no intact
features were identified. Only debitage was recovered during surface collection so no
period of occupation can be estimated.

USGS Quad: Best
Description: Site 41 RG21 was recorded during centerline survey of the ROW.
Burned rock and lithic artifacts rim the left side of Big Lake Draw where erosion has
truncated the site deposits. Shovel probes were largely negative and no features
remain intact in the ROW but 90 meters north of the centerline hearths are eroding
from a ranch road that crosses Big Lake Draw. Charcoal and burned matrix was collected from one of these exposed features but the admixture of roots and carbonates
may introduce difficulties into the radiocarbon assay process, now in progress. Total
collection of the artifacts in the ROW produced one biface fragment, one utilized flake,
one medial dart point fragment and eight pieces of debitage.
Disposition: MDR

SITE NO: 41 RG23

AAPL No: 196-1.5-2
USGS Quad: Best
Description: Site 41 RG23 is a burned rock and lithic scatter paralleling the north
(left) bank of Big Lake Draw, recorded during centerline survey. It differs from the
other sites recorded along this drainageway only in density of temporal diagnostics
and the retention of some buried features. During initial recording, one Marshall-like
and one Marcos/Ensor dart points (Turner and Hester 1985), one biface tip, one biface
midsection, two thick bifaces, and debitage were collected.

Two of three shovel

probes produced cultural material at depths between 15 and 25 ems. A hearth eroding from a minor gully suggested that the site held potential for buried deposits.

24

Limited test excavations were initiated to determine if chronometric samples could be
recovered and if features remained intact with depth.
Testing Program 41 RG23

Five 1x1 meter units were excavated in areas where soils deep enough to mask
features and artifacts were retained. Adjacent Units 1 and 2 were placed above the
cutbank exposure of clustered burned rock, noted during centerline survey. A second
pair, Units 3 and 4, was excavated in the vicinity of Shovel Probe 3 where buried cultural material was recovered, and the fifth unit was established midway between the
cutbank and Units 3 and 4. All were excavated to a minimum depth of 60 cm in 20 cm
increments.

Fill was screened through 1/4 in. hardware cloth.

Burned rock was

weighed, recorded and discarded. All cultural material was recorded on University of
Texas level forms. An updated site map, profiles and feature map were drawn and the
testing was documented using both black-and-white and color photographs. The 395
stone artifacts recovered from surface collection, shovel tests and limited testing are
tabulated for ease of reference (Table 2).
Units 1 and 2, placed to delineate the eroding burned rock cluster, revealed that
the hearth remnant was probably once a burned rock pavement, now buried 20-40 cm
below the surface. Level 2 in both units contained the greatest density of cultural
material, consisting largely of debitage but with three utilized flakes, one biface edge
fragment and a Middle Archaic Pandale dart point. The latter suggests an affinity with
the Lower Pecos River region, south of the study area (Johnson 1964).
Test Unit 3 produced large numbers of debitage in all three levels and a portion
of an intact burned rock pavement hearth was uncovered in Level 3 (40-60 ems). Test
Unit 4 expanded Unit 3 to expose approximately 80% of the hearth, designated as Feature 1 in the field notes. Lithic debitage counts were comparable to those from Unit 3

with a slight decrease in Level 3.

Unfortunately, no temporal diagnostics were

recovered in either Unit 3 or Unit 4.
Feature 1 is a roughly circular pavement of burned limestone cobbles covering
an area 70 cm in diameter (see Supporting Documentation: 41 RG23). The pavement
appears to have been laid on a flat surface as base elevations range from 41 to 45 cm
below the current surface. No subsurface pit could be detected in profile and no charcoal or heat alteration of the sub-hearth deposits were apparent.
A sandstone grinding slab fragment was laying on the northeastern perimeter of
the feature. Both sides of this unburned metate had been worn by a circular grinding
motion. Extensive use had worn a cavity in the center which may have led to fracture
and discard of the slab. Preliminary phytolith analysis of residues on this slab indicates some potential for determination of materials processed. Full analysis is now in
progress.
Test Unit 5 was arbitrarily placed between the paired units along the draw and
the Feature 1 units. Small ,am_ounts of burned rock, large numbers of debitage, a large
bifacial core, a core fragment and the midsection of a dart point were recovered from
this unit (Table 2).
Each of the five test units revealed the same depositional pattern: dark brown
sandy silty loam from the surface to approximately 50 cm, underlain by a lighter brown
sandy silty loam with pea gravels and caliche inclusions. The cultural material was
predominantly in the upper zone but some mixing with lower zone gravels was noted.
In summary, limited testing at 41 RG23 demonstrated that intact burned rock features are buried, albeit shallowly, in areas of deeper sediments along the draw.
Artifacts related to food processing are closely aligned with at least one of the burned
rock features. In the absence of chronometric samples, dating of site deposits must

27

rely on temporally diagnostic artifacts, ranging from an early Middle Archaic Pandale
dart point to Late Archaic Marcos/Ensor and Marshall-like specimens.
Treatment Plan

Site 41 RG23 demonstrably contains relatively intact subsurface cultural deposits
including at least one circular pavement of burned rock, a sandstone grinding slab
with adhering phytoliths, and the debris indicative of stone tool manufacture. That portion of the site within All American Pipeline's ROW is recommended for extensive
subsurface excavation to recover maximum data possible and to provide a means to
mitigate the effects of pipeline construction on the site. The following excavation plan
is proposed to structure the treatment of site 41 RG23.
The next phase of investigation will consist of excavation of at least two 4x4 meter
blocks to a minimum depth of 60 cm. One of the two 4 x 4 meter units will be placed
adjacent to Test Units 3 and 4 which contained Feature 1. The objective of excavating this second 4x4 meter unit is to provide broader areal exposure for interpretation
of this activity area. The second 4 x 4 meter unit will be placed in the vicinity of Test
Unit 5 which yielded considerable debitage, one core, one chunk and a biface fragment.

This location will test the integrity of this possible lithic reduction/tool

manufacturing station and define its relationship to possible hearth areas. Additional
subsurface units will be excavated if artifact patterns or burned rock features require
greater areal exposure for interpretation.
Each 4 x 4 meter block will be removed in 1O cm increments by shovel and trowel
with all fill screened through 1/4 inch hardware cloth. Since burned rock features are
known to be present in relatively intact condition, all burned limestone cobbles will be
pedestalled and mapped in place. Such treatment of burned rock will provide information on hearth configuration and disturbances by cultural practices or natural

28

agencies. Other artifacts, particularly formal tools, will also be mapped in place prior
to removal. Metates or grinding slabs, in addition to in situ plotting, will be packaged
so that, if preserved, phytolith and pollen samples can be obtained from the grinding
surfaces. A soil sample will be collected within 1 meter of all metates for comparative
purposes, and a 1 liter soil sample will be collected from each culture-bearing zone in
each excavation block.
A topographic site map showing the location of the 4 x 4 meter units and their
relationship to the test units and shovel probes will be drawn. A University of Texas
Level Form will be completed for each excavated level and plan maps drawn for any
pedestalled material and features. A representative wall of each unit will be profiled to
supply depositional relationships of cultural zones.

Black-and-white and color

photographs will be taken to document the progress of excavations, artifacts, features
and significant materials recovered.
Preliminary analysis of materials resulting from this excavation will follow acceptable procedures typically included in excavation. Artifacts will be labeled, inventoried
and packaged for curation. All artifacts will be separated into broad manufacture classes (i.e. flaked stone, ground stone) and subdivided into technological stages.
Finished tools and those fitting into defined types will be identified by appropriate
category. Distributional analysis will be performed if applicable and special samples
will be submitted to various consulting laboratories for processing (pollen, phytolith,
C-14, sediment). Since hearths tend to be one focus of camp activity, it is anticipated
that food processing tools will be found in a zone around each feature. The.generally poor preservation characteristic of eolian sediments suggests a low probability for
the recovery of plant macroparts, pollen or bone. In the absence of these primary in-

29

dicators of processed materials, an in-depth use-wear analysis will be performed on
any appropriate tools such as utilized flakes, scrapers and knives.

DISCUSSION: ARTIFACT SCATTERS, SUBSURFACE

The three sites classified as Artifact Scatters, Subsurface are habitation sites in
the CAP typology. They are characterized by burned rock and lithic material and all
represent occupation of the Big Lake drainage, presumably during mesic intervals
when the lake held water. Surface collection and subsurface probing achieved MOR
at 41 RG19 and 41 RG21.

Based on the investigations carried out within the ROW,

neither of these sites meets criteria for nomination to the National Register of Historic
Places but their location on State lands qualifies them for designation as State
Archeological Landmarks.
Temporal diagnostics recovered from surface collection in the ROW are largely
Late Archaic in age with the exception of a Late Prehistoric component at 41RG18.
Subsurface and surface finds demonstrate, however, that 41 RG23 was utilized during
at least during the Middle Archaic and Late Archaic periods. Time markers from sites
outside the ROW on Big Lake proper expand the range of regional occupation from
the Early Archaic through the late Late Prehistoric periods.
Materials amenable to radiocarbon or thermoluminescent dating processes are
rarely preserved in this environment; the one sample extracted off the ROW in an eroding hearth at 41 RG21 may prove too scanty for accurate assay. Radiocarbon dates
derived from shallow or surface features similar to the hearths along Big Lake invariably provide relatively recent dates (Moore 1982; Luke 1983), a function of preservation
rather than occupancy of the sites. Limestone is not conducive to thermoluminescent

30

assay, especially when the features were undoubtedly exposed for long periods of
time prior to burial.
In a qualitative typology, six of the surficial artifact scatters and the three artifact
scatters with subsurface deposits would be classed together as hearth fields (Turpin
1982). The most difficult interpretive aspect of hearth field investigations is relating
features to each other and to artifacts. Contemporaneity remains undemonstrated
due to the loose and shifting nature of the soil matrix and to the slow processes that
effect burial. However, specific areas of 41 RG23 may produce information on site
layout, activity loci, resources exploited and general range of occupancy. Therefore,
the treatment plan was designed to exploit the few areas of the ROW where sediments
may be deep enough to hold intact deposits. Despite the large sizeÂ·of the site, erosion
has effectively reduced the area within the ROW where excavation might prove fruitful.

31

SECTION 6: GEOMORPHIC ANALYSES
Geomorphological Assessment

In keeping with the Cultural Resources Plan, Environmental Section, a map and
records review was conducted by C. Garan to identify areas where cultural resources
might remain buried and where monitoring of trench excavation is warranted. From
McCamey to Big Lake, the pipeline ROW crosses surface geological units dating as
old as the Lower Cretaceous and as recent as modern alluvial and eolian deposits
(Bureau of Economic Geology 1974). The Upton/Reagan county line marks a drainage
basin divide between the Pecos River to the south and the Middle Concho River to the
north. Five miles east of the county line, the Big Lake playa drainage basin begins its
capture of rainfall and runoff.
The Pecos, Middle Concho and Big Lake drainage basin margins are capped by
the highly fossiliferous Buda Limestone; the lower elevations consist of exposures of
the Segovia Formation and the Antlers Sand of the Edwards Group (Bureau of
Economic Geology 1974). The drainage bottoms contain Quaternary alluvial and colluvial deposits.
Medium to fine-grained, tan to dark brown cherts contained in the Segovia Formation provided a major resource for prehistoric stone tool manufacture. Site 41 RG16
is one example of a quarry/lithic procurement site exploiting an exposure of eroding
chert nodules. In addition, the limestones of the Segovia and Buda formations contributed hearth stones evident in the majority of the recorded prehistoric sites.
Big Lake is a large playa that gathers water from an internal drainage basin, fed
by Big Lake Draw on the west and Sugar Draw on the east. The northern rim of the

32

lake is bounded by stabilized dunes, composed of eolian deposits throughout their
exposure. These dunes and the lake are considered by Garan to be the most significant geomorphic feature in the vicinity of this segment of the ROW.

Three

approaches have been taken to clarify the role of the playa in prehistoric and historic
settlement patterns in this region.
First, an archeological reconnaissance of the lake perimeter identified a concentration of sites along the northern rim, adjacent to or upon the dunes (41RG13,
41RG14 and 41 RG26). Although these sites are clearly outside the purview of AAPL,
their location and artifact assemblage expand the interpretive range of the site inventory gained within the ROW. In the absence of chronometric samples, these sites are
a possible means of dating the geomorphic sequence at Big Lake. Site 41RG13, at
the base of the truncated dunes that line the northern perimeter of the Big Lake playa,
yielded bison teeth and Early Archaic stone tools. Apparently, these materials were
redeposited on the playa floor as the dunes eroded. An extensive burned rock midden, also slumping on to the playa floor east of 41RG13, was designated 41RG14.
One mussel shell was identified as Amblema plicata (Neck, 1988, personal communication), now found in the Concho River system, north of the study area. Site
41 RG26 is an extensive hearth field rimming the northwestern arc of the playa. Now
cut by numerous gullies, the site contains isolated pockets of artifacts and both concentrated and dispersed burned rock. The most signficant find was a cluster of six
plainware sherds and a Perdiz arrow point..
Secondly, the highest exposure of dune associated with an archeological site
(41RG13) was profiled and excavated into the lake bottom sediments and sediment
samples were collected. Finally, a historic review of lake fill and drain is being compiled from aerial photographs, newspaper accounts and construction permits issued

33

by the University of Texas lands. In addition, Soil Conservation Service scientists are
currently conducting field checks of their soil survey for Reagan and Irion counties and
have provided preliminary findings. Although much of the data is still in analysis, Garan
has determined that the Big Lake drainage system from Mile Markers 1122 to 1134
and beyond holds priority for monitoring during clearing and grading and trench excavation (Map). The remainder of the ROW, from McCamey to 5 miles east of the
Upton/Reagan county line, holds little potential for buried archeological sites or for
preserved paleoenvironmental data so monitoring is not recommended.

Paleontological Monitoring
Geomorphological monitoring can be carried out in conjunction with the paleontological monitoring described in the ROD: Section B-7.

The two segments

recommended for paleontological monitoring within the first 45-mile stretch of the ROW
are both exposures of the Lower Cretaceous Fort Terrett Formation (Kft). They ex_tenc;f from Mile Marker 1106 + 3000' to 1108 + 00 11 (Rankin USGS) and from Mile Marker
1109 + 00' (Rankin USGS) to 1110 +00' (Rankin NE USGS) in Upton County.

34

SECTION 7: SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
The historic period sites recorded along the pipeline ROW are all remnants of the
1920s boom in Upton and Reagan counties, precipitated by the discovery of oil. Two
major boom towns, Best and Texan, lie north of the ROW; both are reduced to remnant foundations and trash scatters but historical records and photographs show
thriving communities once flourished in the area. The few remains left in these towns
do, however, illustrate the common practice of removing structures for use in other
locations. The sites represented by the historic scatters recorded in the ROW probably functioned within the economic and social sphere of these towns but their physical
remains provide little data.
The relevance of the historic sites to the research questions posed in the CRP
lies in determining their role in the large sphere of economic development. They are
most pertinent to Question 1: What is the variation in human numbers in the study
area? and Question 2: What is the nature of variation in the size/organization of communities in the study area? In addition, historic research into the fill sequence at Big
Lake, although outside the ROW, will address Question 6: What is the nature of variation in the historic environment? The drain and fill sequences in Big Lake incited
considerable local interest so the phenomenon is documented in newspaper accounts
and in long time residents' memories. Thus, research into the historic period in Upton
and Reagan counties is dependant on information other than that physically obtainable
from the three historic sites in the ROW.
Despite the meager recovery from the majority of the prehistoric sites in the first
45-mile stretch of the AAPL ROW, investigations carried out in conjunction with the ac-

35

quisition and centerline survey and geomorphic analyses have significant implications
for future research in the region. The universal dominant factor in arid lands settlement is water availability and the sites recorded along the pipeline ROW can not be
interpreted without expanding the study area to include an analysis of the surrounding hydrology. So few sites had been recorded in Upton (10) and Reagan (4) counties
prior to this survey that distributional studies must rely on information other than that
contained in the county files.

Discussions with local collectors confirmed that the

largest, most complex and longest occupied sites are found north of the ROW along
the Concho River system or south in the Pecos River drainage. The Hickman Library
and Museum in Big Lake holds diagnostic projectile points from Reagan County ranging from Late Paleoindian dart points to Historic metal arrow points, largely collected
north of the study area. The most significant feature in the vicinity of the ROW is Big
Lake, a large, saline playa, fed solely by rainwater, that has intermittently filled and
drained in historic times. Garan has determined that the Big Lake geomorphic sequence may well hold the key to understanding climatic episodes and the formation
of playas throughout the arid west.
The sites recorded along the pipeline increase with proximity to Big Lake Draw
and the playa. The Upton County sites are limited lithic scatters that provide little interpretive value beyond assuming that single episode camp sites were selected on
criteria other than proximity to water. Of the remaining prehistoric sites, only 41RG15
can be considered an outlier to the Big Lake drainage system settlement pattern. This
burned rock and flake scatter lies adjacent to an unnamed drainway that intermittently flows north to the Middle Concho River. Although the main body of the site lies
outside the ROW, the location seems most appropriate for a temporary campsite with
little interpretive value beyond recording.

36

The remaining prehistoric sites are all part of the complex occupation of Big Lake
Draw and the playa.

Although eight sites were recorded along the ROW, this

distribution is more a function of the route of the pipeline than of prehistoric preference.
Moving the corridor to avoid these sites could only be accomplished by a massive
rerouting as cultural material lines the banks of the draw on both sides for its entire
length. Each of the sites along Big Lake Draw probably constitutes but one area of
massive hearth fields that parallel the draw and line the northern perimeter of the lake.
Early Archaic through Late Prehistoric occupations are reflected in the temporal diagnostics recovered from the vicinity of Big Lake.
Based on the series of research questions proposed in the Cultural Resources
Plan, the prehistoric sites in the ROW are most relevant to:
Question 1: What is the nature of variation in human numbers in the study area:
Question 3: What is the nature of variation in the use of the environment in the
study area:
Question 5: What is the nature of variation in the extent and magnitude of exchange networks in the study area?
The distribution of sites in Upton and Reagan counties reflects two modes of occupation.

The limited activity sites are consistent with small numbers of people

camping for an extremely short period of time while the hearth fields that line Big Lake
Draw reflect more intensive exploitation of the playa resources during periods of lake
fill. The inability to delimit specific times of site habitation is the limiting factor in the
interpretability of the distribution pattern. Thus, while no estimate of the exact population numbers can be made with any degree of accuracy, a relative density can be
detected in the intensity of occupation at the ROW sites.

37

No exotic items suggestive of trade were collected during the survey; all lithic
material was comparable to the chert quarry inventory (41 RG16). Relevant artifacts
found outside the ROW are one mussel shell, derived from the Concho drainage
(41RG14), and six plainware sherds (41 RG26) similar to ceramics found in the Abilene
area.

These finds suggest movement of people south to the Big Lake drainage,

probably during more mesic periods. In addition, one Pandale dart point recovered
during testing at 41 RG23 is more characteristic of the Lower Pecos Region to the south
than any local tradition. Thus, the evidence to date favors transport of materials by
mobile populations rather than through exchange and exploitation of local resources
in stone tool production.
In addition, the identification of Middle and Late Archaic components at 41 RG23
suggests that the planned excavations at this site hold potential for addressing:
Question 6: What is the nature of variation in the prehistoric environments in the
study area?
A full response to this question, however, is dependant on the acquisition of paleoindicators from Big Lake. The key role of Big Lake in the interpretation of regional
prehistory was exploited by the investigations described under Section 4: Geomorphic
Studies. As part of this environmental reconnaissance, a circuit of Big Lake was conducted to determine the relationship of prehistoric cultural materials to the series of
superimposed stabilized dunes on the north side. Sites noted in this reconnaissance
included a burned rock midden surrounded by lithic material; a probable Early Archaic
bison kill site and an extensive hearth field now eroding to the lake bottom levels. Informants from the Big Lake area confirmed our impression that sites cluster on the
northern rim of the playa. Although continuing investigations of the archeological
resources at Big Lake proper are clearly beyond the scope of the present study, these

38

sites may identify periods of lake ebb and flow that are critical to the reconstruction of
climatic models.
With the exception of 41 RG23, none of the sites recorded in the AAPL ROW meet
criteria for National Register of Historic Places eligibility. Sites 41 UT11, 41UT14 and
41RG14 through 41 RG25 are on University of Texas lands and therefore qualify for
designation as State Archeological Landmarks. The additional excavation proposed
at 41 RG23 will complete the maximum data recovery required for all sites in the McCamey to Big Lake segment of the ROW.
Thus, the treatment program for the first 45-mile stretch of the AAPL ROW concentrates on 1) additional treatment of the single site on Big Lake Draw (41 RG23) with
intact subsurface deposits; and 2) monitoring of trench excavation from the first encounter with Big Lake Draw, north of and across the playa and its eastern tributary,
Sugar Draw, outside the current

~egment.

The field work will be augmented by

thorough analysis of the archival and informant research to compile a regional history
and identify the role of the historic sites in modern development. Local collectors and
museums have been contacted and their materials will be further studied during additional excavation of 41 RG23. The lithic sample collected from the various sites will be
more thoroughly analyzed as the appropriate tasks are implemented. Geomorphic
studies are dependant upon monitoring of the pipeline trench during trench excavation.

UNKNOWN PREHISTORIC

WHEN THE SITE WAS INTIALLY

THIS WAS A QUICK AND WRONG
EVALUATION. WHAT WAS
CONSIDERED DEBITAGE ON THE

EXHIBIT RECENT FLAKE SCARS.
THEY ARE SMALL AND BLOCKY.

HISTORIC--1920'S AND LATER

THE SITE CONSISTS OF A GENERAL
ARTIFACT SCATTER. THERE WAS

AN ARTIFACT CONCENTRATION TO
WARRANT BEING A DUMP. NEITHER
WERE ANY FEATURES OR BUILDING
REMNANTS OBSERVED (OTHER THAN
A BRICK FRAGMENT AND WINDOW
GLASS) TO WARRANT THE AREA
BEING CALLED A HOUSESITE. OF
NOTE. HOWEVER, IS THE
SIMILARITY IN ARTIFACTS
OBSERVED TO 41UT14, A HOUSE
SITE, LOCATED FOUR MILES WEST.
BOTH ARE PROBABLY RELATED TO
THE 1920'S OIL BOOM. THE
PURPOSE OF THE MAN-MADE

Discussion of Site

UNKNOWN PREHISTORIC AND
HISTORIC 1920'S

THIS SITE PROBABLY REPRESENTS
A HOMESTEAD. BASED ON
DIAGNOSTICS RECOVERED AND
STRUCTURAL ARTIFACTS (BRICK,
LIMESTONE, NAILS). THE SITE IS
CIRCA 1920'S AND MAYBE RELATED
TO THE OIL BOOM IN TEXAS AT
THIS TIME.

Components

Site Type :
HISTORIC HOMESTEAD/LITHIC SCATTER

Cultural Features

ONE 4 METER SQUARE COLLECTION
SAMPLE WAS TAKEN FROM THE
DENSEST PORTION OF THE SITE.
THIS DID NOT EQUAL THE 100
ARTIFACT GOAL. HOWEVER. NO
MORE SAMPLES WERE TAKEN SINCE
ARTIFACTS ARE HEAVILY
REDUNDANT IN THIS AREA (AREA
MOSTLY CONSISTS OF BROKEN
BOTTLE GLASS AND NAILS).
THEREFORE. ONE 4 METER SQUARE

Discussion of Site :

UNKNOWN PREHISTORIC

ONLY THE NORTHERNMOST PART OF
THE SITE WILL BE IMPACTED BY
THE AAPL. THE MAIN BODY OF
THE SITE IS LOCATED
APPROXIMATELY 70-100 METERS
SOUTH OF THE R.O.W., SO
AVOIDANCE WAS NOT RECOMMENDED.
THE SITE IS A MODERATE LITHIC
SCATTER ON THE SURFACE.
FURTHER WORK MAY REVEAL
EVIDENCE OF A CAMPSITE.
FLAKES ON BURROWS SUGGEST
SUBSURFACE DEPOSITS. SITE
BOUNDARIES ARE ESTIMATIONS
BECAUSE WE DID NOT HAVE MUCH
TIME TO SPEND ON THE SITE.
SITE WAS MOST PROBABLY
SEASONALLY OR TEMPORARILY USED
BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF WATER.

Components

Basis for Determination :
R.O.W. SURVEY ONLY/NO DIAGNOSTICS
Site Type :
OPEN CAMPSITE

Cultural Features
ONE ERODED BURNED ROCK
CONCENTRATION NOTED ON THE
EASTERN EDGE OF THE SITE. A
FEW FLAKES AND A UNIFACIALLY
WORKED END AND SIDE CBLADE
SCRAPER) WERE NEAR IT. SIZE
IS ABOUT 50CMS.X 50CMS. EIGHT
BURNED ROCKS DEFINED THE
FEATURE. NO CHARCOAL OR
BURNED SOIL REMAINS

SITE REPRESENTS A TEMPORARY
OPEN CAMPSITE. THIS
OBSERVANCE WAS MADE WHEN THE
INITIAL SURVEY WAS DONE. THE
MAIN BODY OF THE SITE IS NOW
UPSLOPE (SOUTH) OF THE
RIGHT-OF-WAY. THE FEW
ARTIFACTS THAT WERE ON THE
RIGHT-OF-WAY HAVE BEEN
TRANSPORTED DOWN.

ARCHAIC

THE SITE REPRESENTS AN OPEN
CAMPSITE USED FOR A SHORT
PERIOD OF TIME WHEN WATER WAS
AVAILABLE IN BIG LAKE DRAW.
MOST OF THE ARTIFACTS OBSERVED
WERE RIGHT AT THE EDGE OF THE
DBAW. SO THE MAJORITY OF THE
SITE IN THE R.O.W. HAS
PROBABLY ERODED AWAY.

Time Periods of Occupation

Discussion of Site :

MIDDLE TO LATE ARCHAIC

THE SITE REPRESENTS AN
OPEN CAMPSITE OCCUPIED WHEN
WATER WAS AVAILA.BLE IN BIG
LAKE DRAW. I BELIEVE IT
REPRESENTS A SINGLE COMPONENT
BECAUSE OF THE SMALL AMOUNT OF
ARTIFACTS THAT WERE OBSERVED.
THERE IS VERY LITTLE
DEPOSITION ON THE SITE (SEE
SHOVEL TEST FOBMl â¢ THERE ARE
SEVERAL CAMPSITES ALONG THE
DRAW CWE HAVE RECORDED THREE
PRIOR TO THIS ONE). WE CAN
ONLY SURVEY THE R.O.W., BUT
THEY APPEAR TO BE MOSTLY
SURFICIAL AND OCCUPIED FOR A
SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.
85% OF THE ARTIFACTS WERE
COLLECTED FROM THE WESTERN 1/4
IN THE ROW. A SMALL CLUSTER
OF BURNED ROCK AND THIN
SCATTER OF BURNED ROCK IS
LOCATED HERE ALSO. THE
REMAINING 15% OF ARTIFACTS
WERE SCATTERED IN THE ROW.
