ABSTRACT

Two archeological projects were undertaken in the fall of 1982 by
Prewitt and Associates, Inc.
Both projects were authorized by the
Willacy County Drainage District No. 1.
The first investigation was an archeological survey to locate,
record and assess previously unknown cultural resources which potentially could be affected by proposed drainage ditch development (Main
Floodway Channel) in the central county area. Field inspections of this
proposed alignment detected 24 archeological sites.
Fourteen of these
recorded sites are classified as isolated finds which are presumed to be
prehistoric.
The remaining ten resources are classified as sites, six
containing prehistoric materials and four attributed to the recent
(post-1900) historic past.
Five of the prehistoric sites, 41WY84,
41WY86, 41WY89, 41WY90 and 41WY91, were assessed initially as having
high information yield potential, and testing was considered warranted
prior to the construction of the Main Floodway Channel to more fully
assess the potential eligibility of these sites for nomination to the
National Register of Historic Places.
This recommendation for testing prompted the second project which
involved test excavations at site 41WY84. Site 41WY84 was selected from
the five prehistoric sites for testing to better assess the nature and
condition of these resources.
It is concluded from the data recovered
that site 41WY84 contains thinly dispersed cultural materials in a
highly disturbed context and therefore does not warrant nomination to
the National Register of Historic Places. On the basis of these testing
results, archeological clearance for the proposed Willacy County Drainage District No. 1 Main Floodway Channel is recommended.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

The completion of the projects reported here was possible through
the aid of several individuals. Of primary importance was the cooperation of the Willacy County Drainage District No. 1 of Lyford and its
District Manager, Mr. Jim Riggan, and the engineering firm of Melden and
Hunt, Inc. , Edinburg.
Thanks also are extended to a.11 the landowners
involved with the Main Floodway Channel. Mr. Floyd Rhodes was particularly cooperative by allowing testing of site 41WY84, which is on his
property.
Both field crews were provided with housing and hospitality by Mr.
and Mrs. "Tex" Foster of Raymondville, Texas.
A number of Prewitt and Associates, Inc. personnel contributed
their efforts as well.
The survey fieldwork was accomplished by the
author and Assistant Archeologist, Vance o. Langley.
Mr. Langley's
familiarity with the area and its cultural resources proved invaluable.
Testing of site 41WY84 was undertaken with the capable assistance of Liz
Day, Ron Holan and Jerri McLerran. Patricia A. Mercado-Allinger served
as Project Archeologist for both projects and prepared this report.
Cartography was provided by Sandra Hannum Price and Kerza A.
Prewitt. Linda Battles-Herron illustrated the artifacts, while administrative assistance and typing of the report was contributed by Linda
Nance Foster and Cris Emmons.
The Principal Investigator for both projects, El ton R. Prewitt,
assisted in editing and contributed the airphoto analysis. The historic
ceramics were identified by Kerza A. Prewitt, and faunal identifications
were made by Bonnie Yates. Laboratory processing was undertaken by the
author with the assistance of Martin Salinas.

SURVEY AND ASSESSMENT OF CULTURAL RESOURCES IN PORTIONS
OF WILLACY COUNTY DRAINAGE DISTRICT NO. 1;
WILLACY COUNTY, TEXAS

INTRODUCTION

A cultural resources survey and assessment was conducted by Prewitt
and Associates, Inc. along a proposed drainage ditch alignment in
Willacy County under terms of a letter of agreement with the Willacy
County Drainage District No. 1, Lyford, Texas.
Fieldwork included
inspection of those areas to be affected by drainage construction along
the proposed 14.5 mile Willacy Drainage District No. 1 Main Floodway
Channel. All investigations and survey results herein reported comply
with the provisions of Permit No. 321 issued by the Texas Antiquities
Committee to the Willacy County Drainage District 1.
Fieldwork was initiated on August 24, 1982 and was completed
August 28, 1982. A two-person crew conducted these investigations with
Patricia A. Mercado-Allinger serving as Project Archeologist and Vance
o. Langley as Assistant Archeologist. The Principal Investigator was
Elton R. Prewitt.
The current project is located in the same general area previously
described by Day et al. (1981) and Mallouf et al. (1977). Day et al.
(1981) reports surveys and assessments of the Hida.lgo Drainage District
Main Floodway alignment and various lateral ditches near the present
project area.
Therefore, background information which has been previously reported will only receive brief reference here; to facilitate
discussion, the same terminology developed in these earlier reports has
been incorporated.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Willacy Country Drainage District No. 1 Main Floodway Channel
is located north of the Arroyo Colorado in the northern edge of the Rio
Grande delta plain.
Its eastern limit is in central Willacy County.
From this point, the alignment extends westward toward the HidalgoWillacy county line and passes between the towns of Raymondville and
Lyford (Fig. 1).
No natural drainage occurs in this portion of the Rio Grande delta
plain.
This lack of drainage combined with the flat character of the
landscape, contributes to periodic and prolonged episodes of flooding.
As the main form of land use in the region is agriculture, the flooding
problem is being addressed with a proposal which includes a complex of
drainage systems under the jurisdiction of the Willacy County Drainage
District No. 1.
This plan involves improvements to existing agricultural earthen drainage ditches as well as the excavation of additional
channels.
The Willacy County Drainage District No. 1 Main Floodway
Channel is a part of this proposed system.
Since the predictive sample survey conducted by Mallouf et al.
(1977) and the reconnaissance of the Hidalgo County Drainage District
Main Floodway Channel (Day et al. 1981) both report potentially significant cultural resources in the same general area, it was highly likely

PART I: SURVEY AND ASSESSMENT

that other, unknown cultural materials would be impacted by further
drainage development. The purpose of the current project was to determine, through field inspection, if cultural resources are present in the
proposed channel development route.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Willacy County comprises a part of the Rio Grande delta plain in
southern Texas. This area is included in the Matamoran district of the
Tamaulipan biotic province (Blair 1950:102-105). Climate for this province is characterized as semiarid and megathermal with an average 61.65
cm annual rainfall which historically supported at least 61 species of
mammals, 2 land turtles, 3 urodeles and 19 species of anurans (Blair
1950:102-105).
Land clearing for agricultural purposes has eliminated
the native brushland in the current project area.
Day (1981:6-8) has
compiled a list of biota observed in eastern Willacy County which will
not be repeated here.
The deltaic plain has a flat to slightly undulating surface topography.
Elevations increase slowly westward from the Gulf shoreline.
Only the late Pleistocene Beaumont Formation is exposed in the current
project area.
A thin veneer of surface sediments overlie the Beaumont
Formation and are interlaced with relict interdistributary channel remnants and their associated eolian depressions (Mallouf et al. 1977: 13).
In their predictive sampling survey, Mallouf et al. delineated
seven environmental zones in Willacy County (1977:102-109).
The proposed alignment of the Willacy County Drainage District No. 1 Main
Floodway Channel alignment crosses two of these--Environmental zones II
and IV. Environmental Zone II is present only in the western limits of
the project area near the Willacy-Hidalgo county line. Zone II, designated as Lasara Loess, is relatively flat and lacks natural rock or
gravel outcrops (Mallouf et al. 1977:104). Environmental Zone IV, the
Raymondville Alluvial Plain, also has a flat character and has no exposed rock or gravel resources (Mallouf et al. 1977:106), and comprises
the majority of the project area. Neither zone has any natural drainage
and both are susceptible to periodic flooding.
Observed land use in
these two zones is highly dependent upon agriculture.
The project
alignment includes one very small area north and east of Lyford which
could not be considered agricultural.

ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND

A thorough review of past archeological research in the region is
provided in Mallouf et al. (1977). The interested reader is directed to
this reference for information on historic, ethnohistoric and prehistoric investigation undertaken before 1975 in the south Texas counties
of Brooks, Cameron, Hidalgo, Jim Hogg, Kenedy, Starr, Zapata and
Willacy.
Of note is Prewitt (1974) , wherein a useful site situation

PART I: SURVEY AND ASSESSMENT

typology was developed on the basis of a survey in Cameron County and
review of the A.E. Anderson collection.
Since 1975, a predictive sampling research project was conducted
which stressed the significant interrelationships that environmental and
geological characteristics have with the cultural resources in portions
of Hidalgo and Willacy counties (Mallouf et al. 1977) .
Day et al.
(1981)
reported another cultural resource survey accompanied with
limited testing in the two counties:
this survey was guided by a predictive site location model using terminology and test implications
developed in Mallouf et al. (1977).
The most recent work in Willacy
County involved testing of two prehistoric sites, 41WY71 and 41WY72, in
eastern Willacy County (Day 1981).

INVESTIGATION PROCEDURES

The current project followed closely the predictive model and
investigative methodology defined in Day et al. (1981:26-31).
It also
incorporated additional airphoto analysis accomplished prior to field
work.
The airphotos used for this analysis are high altitude stereoscopic color aerial photographs taken of Willacy County by the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Mission 220 in 1972 with an
approximate scale of 1:62 500. These airphotos were examined by using a
stereoscopic viewer to identify surface features not shown on United
States Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5' topographic sheets.
In this
manner, depressions and relict distributary channel scars were identified in and adjacent to the project alignment.
These features were
then plotted on the appropriate USGS 7. 5' sheets to be used in the
field.
Briefly, the predictive model developed for this portion of the Rio
Grande deltaic plain assumes a hunting-gathering adaptation by the aboriginal inhabitants on the basis of assembled prehistoric data (Mallouf
et al. 1977:198). Such a lifeway is reliant upon the procurement of a
variety of natural resources, particularly those associated with supplies of fresh water. Climatic conditions and the physical characteristics of the deltaic plain have important implications for this model.
Each of these factors contribute to alternating periods of severe flooding and aridity for the area. Thus, aboriginal populations would probably have sought out higher elevations (such as those provided by
natural levees along relict channel scars) during wetter seasons. Relict
channel depressions likely contained potable water in drier times.
The
availability of other exploitable resources is expected to have been
influenced by these conditions. Aboriginal settlement of the region is
therefore anticipated to have involved a patterning of temporary and
semi-permanent camps and resource exploitation localities dependent upon
the availability of resources.
As stated earlier, the Willacy County Drainage District No. 1 Main
Floodway Channel alignment traverses portions of two environmental zones

6

INVESTIGATION PROCEDURES

(II and IV).
Geomorphic features identified for these two zones are
limited to relict distributary channel scars and associated depressions.
These features are considered to have high potential for containing
archeological sites.

SURVEY METHODS
The current project represents a continuation of earlier surveys
and assessments reported in Day et al. (1981). The research orientation
was to locate, record and provide initial assessment of cultural resources encountered during the pedestrian inspection of the project
area.
Determination of potential impacts posed by proposed drainage
development was the ultimate goal of this work.
Unlike the previous surveys, this project area included no unmodified land. The majority of the project alignment included cultivated
fields, many of which were devoid of any vegetation at the time of inspection. Surface visibility therefore varied from good (75 percent) to
excellent (100 percent) for much of the project area. The exceptions to
this general statement were certain of the existing drainage ditches
which support moderate to thick grass covers and a 4.6 km (3. 7 mi)
stretch immediately east of the Sample 3 quadrant investigated by
Mallouf et al. (1977: 118-123).
The area east of Sample 3 supports
densely planted cotton crops which affords very limited surface visibility. The existing drainage ditch which extends through this same 4.6
km area was thickly covered with grass.
In the areas where surface
visibility was good to high (75-100 percent), the method of investigation generally involved two zigzagged sweeps, using the proposed alignment as a center line. Each sweep covered approximately 100 m, providing an average coverage of 200 m.
In the more densely vegetated area,
the strategy was modified.
In the area containing growing crops, the
survey procedure was to follow along alternate cultivated furrows to the
desired 200 m width. Where drainage ditches existed, both cutbanks and
the associated spoilage mound were intensively searched.

IDENTIFICATION OF RESOURCES
Archeological research in this area has established that prehistoric deposits contain a paucity of cultural materials. Common indicators are lithic tools, fired clay lumps and faunal remains such as bone
and freshwater or marine shells.
Combinations of these indicators
detected within a 100 m surface diameter (or less) defines a prehistoric
site (Day et al. 1981: 34) •
Fired clay lumps in prehistoric context
indicate hearth features. However, similar clay lumps may also be produced by historic field clearing and burning.
Therefore, the presence
of clay lumps does not necessarily establish the presence of a prehistoric site.
Historic sites commonly contain glass, metal, ceramics and structural remains.

7

PART I: SURVEY AND ASSESSMENT
Several isolated finds were also noted during the current project.
An isolated find is defined here as a solitary specimen or a concentration of homogeneous materials. Single lithic artifacts, clay lumps
and bone fragments (or concentrations) were recorded as isolated finds.
The latter two categories have questionable cultural associations.
Both archeological sites and isolated finds were recorded using
State of Texas site data forms.
Locations were plotted on USGS topographic sheets, and permanent trinomial designations have been assigned
by the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) , The University of
Texas at Austin. Since the entire project area was located in Willacy
County, Texas, all numerical designations are prefaced with 41WY. Surface collections were limited to either diagnostic specimens or representative materials. Curation of these collections has been arranged
with TARL.
Lastly, all cultural resource identifications were made solely on
the basis of surface inspections. At no time were subsurface probes
excavated.
SURVEY RESULTS
Twenty-four cultural resources locations were recorded by this
investigation.
More specifically, six are classified a.s prehistoric
sites, four are historic sites and fourteen are isolated finds (Figs. 2
and 3).
Cultural resources were encountered in both of the defined environmental zones that occur in the project area. Distributions of these
resources are given in Table 1.

PART I: SURVEY AND ASSESSMENT

Most of these sites were found to be associated with relict distributary channel scars and their depressions (Figs. 2 and 3) .
This
applies to both prehistoric and historic resources in support of the
predictive model and survey results presented in Day et al. (1981).
It is important to recall, however, that the entire project area
has been subjected to varying degrees of surface modification related to
agriculture.
Nowhere in the proposed channel alignment was there any
unmodified land surface.
Certain of the prehistoric materials were
encountered in highly disturbed contexts that has resulted from both
cultivation and previous drainage ditch excavation.
Despite this, the
possibility exists that intact subsurface deposits may be present below
the disturbance zone.
The following is a presentation of survey results organized by site
and isolated find categories.
The discussion includes permanent TARL
designations, locational data, general descriptions of the sites and the
materials observed and collected, assessments and recommendations. Site
descriptions also include a discussion category.
No distinction has
been made here to formally differentiate prehistoric from historic resources. A summary of observed materials (Table 2) follows the detailed
descriptive discussion.

None.

Discussion: The glass observed was bottle glass with no markings.
Overall, the deposit is a thin scatter which has been displaced by
repeated plowing.
Assessment: The site appears to be a twentieth century trash scatter, possibly associated with an occupation. Present information indicates that this deposit has a low information yield potential.
Recommendations:
Further work is felt not to be scientifically
productive at this time.

USGS Raymondville 7.5' (1956, revised 1970)

Location: The site is in a cultivated field northwest of Lyford;
north on Business Route U.S. Highway 77 1.2 km and west on an unnamed
dirt road 2.5 km. The site is on the south side of the road.
Description:
The site is a thin deposit found in an intensively
cultivated field. At the time of inspection, the field was fallow and
covered with a moderately dense cover of forbs. Several relict channel
scars have been noted in the area.

SURVEY RESULTS

Discussion:
The collected bone specimen has been identified as a
goat/sheep (Capra/Ovis) metacarpal of probable recent origin. This bone
may not be associated with the marine shell fragment.
Assessment:
This is a possible prehistoric aboriginal camp or
resource exploitation site. Information yield potential is high.
Recommendations: The presence of marine shell indicates the possibility of potentially significant deposits. Subsurface testing prior to
channel development may be warranted at this site to determine eligibility to the National Register of Historic Places.

Environmental Zone: IV
Map Reference:

USGS Raymondville 7.5 1 (1956, revised 1970)

Location:
The site is on the northwestern corner of an intersection at Business Route U.S. Highway 77 and an unnamed dirt road near the
northern Lyford city limit. The dirt road is 0.6 km north of FM 1921.
Description: An existing drainage ditch runs north-south along the
eastern site limit. A thick growth of bermudagrass covers this ditch,
while the site proper is in a plowed flat field.
North of the site
area, a cotton crop was growing at the time of inspection.
A relict
depression is also present to the north.
Horizontal Extent: 25 m N-S by 35 m E-W
Vertical Extent:

Undetermined.

Material Observed: Ceramic sherds (earthenware, stoneware, decalcomania), glass bottle fragments (clear, purple), rusted metal bolts and
brick fragments.
Collections:

3 ceramic sherds, 2 glass fragments.

Discussion: The collected ceramic sherds were identified as stoneware and earthenware. The collected glass included one bottle neck and
rim, and one handle.
All observed materials were attributable to the
twentieth century.
Assessment:
The USGS map shows structures were present at this
location in the recent past. This historic trash scatter probably indicates the remains of these structures which, judging from the nature of
observed materials, were probably twentieth-century occupations.
Present information indicates a low information yield potential at this
site.

SURVEY RESULTS

Description:
This deposit is in a cultivated field which was
recently harvested, allowing 100 percent surface visibility.
A large
depression is located over 100 m to the west of the site. The surface
of the site slopes gradually to the southwest.
Horizontal Extent:
Vertical Extent:

85 m N-S by 54 m E-W
Undetermined.

Materials Observed: One modified split cobble and three clay lumps
were observed on the plowed field while a possible clay lump hearth
feature was noted in the western bank of an existing drainage ditch
immediately to the east of the major site area.
Collections:

One modified split cobble.

Discussion:
A local farmer indicated that massive disturbance of
this particular field has included land leveling, vegetation clearing
and filling.
The site area has therefore undergone extensive displacement.
Assessment: This deposit is a prehistoric camp or resource exploitation site which may still contain undisturbed, intact materials below
the plowzone.
Recommendations: Subsurface testing may be warranted at this location prior to further drainage development to establish ~he presence or
absence of potentially significant deposits.

ARTIFACT DESCRIPTIONS
Limited surface collections were made at two historic sites (41WY82
and 41WY87) as well as at five prehistoric sites (41WY84, 41WY86,
41WY89, 41WY90 and 41WY91). Seven of the isolated finds were also collected ( 41WY92, 41WY93, 41WY94, 41WY96, 41WY97, 41WY98 and 41WY103) •
Descriptions of these specimen are provided below according to prehistoric or historic affiliations; provenience is given by site. Artifact
terminology and presentation is compatible with Day et al. (1981).
PREHISTORIC SPECIMENS
Specimens identified as prehistoric included three analytical categories: lithic artifacts, fired clay lumps and faunal remains. Identifications are made using the most general descriptive divisions, progressing when possible to more precise categories using functional terms,
established tool types and faunal taxonomy. Provenience of the artifacts is summarized in Table 3.
Knapped Stone
All artifacts which were manufactured by the removal of flakes,
whether in the resulting production of a tool or representing chipping
debris is included in this category.

HISTORIC SPECIMENS
The historic materials collected during the current project at
sites 41WY82 and 41WY87 are believed to date to the present century,
probably from 1930 to the present. None of the nine recovered specimens
were found to be particularly diagnostic of significant time periods or
events.
Only two categories of historic artifacts are represented in the
survey collection~ ceramic and glass. Brief descriptions of each are
given below and are followed by a provenience summary table (Table 4).

CONCLUSIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS
The distribution of aboriginal sites along the Willacy County
Drainage District No. l Main Floodway Channel is consistent with the
predictive model across Environmental Zones II and IV.
However, the
summary of findings according to zone (Table 5) should be viewed with
the project bias for Zone IV.

PART I: SURVEY AND ASSESSMENT
areas identified from airphoto analysis as low levees and eolian depressions. Inspection of existing drainage ditches also presented evidence
for the possibility of additional subsurface cultural resources.
Surface materials which appear to be prehistoric in age were recorded at six sites, 41WY83, 41WY84, 41WY86, 41WY89, 41WY90 and 41WY91.
The 14 isolated finds (41WY92 through 41WY105) have also been tentatively identified as prehistoric. More precise temporal assignments are
not possible due to the small number of collected materials and the lack
of a reliable cultural chronology or developmental construct for the
region.
The following interpretations however, are presented on the
basis of observed prehistoric materials:
1. Lithic tool manufacturing and useage are indicated at sites and
isolated finds.
2. Lithic resources were procured from distances of over 45 km (36
mi), suggesting wide ranging exploitation activities or trade.
3. The presence of fired clay lumps both in isolated and site
deposit context suggest probable cooking/heating activities.
4. Terrestrial (medium to large mammal) and marine animal (turtle
and shellfish) species may have been exploited prehistorically.
5. The sparse and dispersed nature of the recorded sites, which
may have been a condition of original deposition, have been i~pacted by
land clearing and cultivation.
Each of the historic sites contained materials attributable to
post-1900 land use and are probably indicative of farming or ranching.
The predictive model was a less effective locational tool for these
resources.
ASSESSMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
As stated earlier, the current project area involves no unmodified
land.
Modification has included the clearing of vegetation, surface
leveling, cultivation and, in certain areas, the excavation of drainage
ditches.
It was therefore difficult to make assessments of significance or
recommendations for further research on the basis of observations made
on these highly disturbed land surfaces. Nonetheless, determinations of
anticipated information yield potential were attempted for each cultural
resource recorded (Table 5). Resources were ranked according to high,
low or undetermined information yield potentials.
Assessments of low or undetermined information yield potentials
were made for all isolated finds, historic deposits and one site tentatively identified as a prehistoric camp. Isolated finds were assessed
44

ASSESSMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
thusly due to their highly disturbed and isolated context or questionable cultural derivation.
Historic sites were assessed as having low
information potential on the basis of the recent (post-1900) materials
found and the absence of structural features. Site 41WY83 was desig. nated as having undetermined potential because of a lack of demonstrable
cultural material. Additional field investigations are therefore not
considered to be scientifically productive at this time for those resources assessed as having low or undetermined information yield potential.
The possibility of undisturbed and buried deposits below the plowzone was considered for the remaining sites.
Significant data could
occur at these locations, which subsurface testing would establish.
Testing may then be warranted before channel development along the proposed alignment. It is recommended that such action be considered to
allow for proper assessment of eligibility to the National Register of
Historic Places for those sites assessed as having high potential.
Undisturbed and buried cultural deposits may exist below the plowzone at these remaining sites. Consequently, significant archeological
data may be expected at sites 41WY84, 41WY86, 41WY89, 41WY90 and 41WY91.
However, to establish the integrity of the deposits and to demonstrate
the actual information yield potential of these sites, subsurface testing is required. This testing should be done before additional construction of the drainages ditches is initiated, and should be of sufficient scope to allow a determination of eligibility for nomination to
the National Register of Historic Places for each of the sites.
The lack of excavated prehistoric archeological sites in the general project area makes it difficult to predict what may be encountered
within an excavated context, and even more difficult to a.nticipate the
scope of testing needed to accurately assess the information yield
potential of any specific site. In order to address these problems, a
limited program of investigation is recommended. Rather than test all
five of the sites which are felt to require more detailed assessments,
it is suggested that only one site be selected for initial testing and
that the testing be of sufficient scope to allow preliminary calculations of the density of cultural materials and the presence or absence
of isolatable occupational zones or strata.
If this testing at one site yields positive data collection results, then all five sites should be considered as eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places.
In this case, the
ditch should be rerouted to avoid the sites, or if this is not possible,
then intensive controlled excavations should be undertaken to mitigate
the loss of the sites.
However, if the testing yields negative results, then none of the
sites would be considered eligible for nomination to the National Register. In this instance, no further archeological work would be required
and construction could proceed with altering the expected route of the
ditch.

PART I: SURVEY AND ASSESSMENT

It is suggested that site 41WY84 near the east end of the project
area be selected for the testing program.
Since construction is expected to begin at the east end of the project alignment and extend
westward, this will allow sufficient time for adjustments to be made in
the project routing or for site mitigation to be effected as may be
necessary.

PART II
ARCHEOLOGICAL TESTING AND ASSESSMENT OF SITE 41WY84,
WILLACY COUNTY, TEXAS

INTRODUCTION

The test excavation of prehistoric site 41WY84 was undertaken by
Prewitt and Associates, Inc. under terms of a letter of agreement with
Willacy County Drainage District No. 1, Lyford, Texas.
The testing
results reported herein comply with the provisions of Permit No. 328
issued by the Texas Antiquities Committee to the Willacy County Drainage
District No. 1.
Field investigations required eight working days which were initiated on November 2, 1982 and completed on November 11, 1982. The field
crew consisted of the Project Archeologist, Patricia A. MercadoAllinger, and three Archeological Assistants:
Liz Day, Ron Holan and
Jerri McLerran. Elton R. Prewitt served as Principal Investigator.
Site 41WY84 was located and documented during the cultural resources survey and assessment of the proposed Main Floodway Channel
Alignment reported in Part I of this report. Testing of site 41WY84 was
proposed to more fully assess the potential eligibility for nomination
to the National Register of Historic Places of one of the five prehistoric sites recorded within the alignment right-of-way. The paucity of
excavated prehistoric archeological sites in the general project area
makes difficult the assessment of a site's information yield potential
on the basis of surface evidence. One local testing program reported by
Day (1981) indicated that cultural material density was low while labor
intensity requirements were high.
It was felt, therefore, that test
excavation of one prehistoric site would provide the data necessary for
assessment purposes for all five sites.
Since environmental and archeological background information has
already been provided in Part I of this report, it is not repeated here.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Site 41WY84 is in Willacy County, Texas, southeast of the community
of Willamar (Fig. 1, Part I). This site was recorded during the surface
survey of the proposed Willacy County Drainage District No. 1 Main
Floodway Channel, reported in Part I of this report.
Site 41WY84 is
situated near the eastern limit of this channel alignment which extends
from central Willacy County westward toward the Willacy-Hidalgo county
line, passing between the towns of Lyford and Raymondville.

RESEARCH DESIGN

The testing strategy followed at 41WY84 was designed to obtain data
necessary to assess its eligibility for nomination to the National
Register of Historic Places.
In order to make an assessment of the
site's overall scientific value, excavations were undertaken to:

METHODOLOGY
Testing at 41WY84 involved the manual excavation of two 2x2-m units
(Test Areas A and B) and three 30-cm-diameter shovel probes. In addition, fourteen 20x20-m units were intensively searched for surface cultural materials. All of these investigations were undertaken within the
limits of the proposed Main Floodway Channel right-of-way.
A permanent reference point (site datum) was established at the
southwestern corner of a concrete culvert located in the existing drainage ditch immediately west of the site. This action was necessary as no
known survey points are present in the vicinity of site 41WY84.
A
second, temporary reference point, NlOOO/WlOOO, was located above the
drainage ditch in the northwestern site area. Using NlOOO/WlOOO as the
northwestern limit, an arbitrary grid aligned 7.5° east of magnetic
north was established. All investigation units are referred to by their
northwestern coordinate.
Project documentation included the maintenance of daily general
field notes.
In addition, excavation progress was noted on a daily
basis on forms designed to assist in unit/level recordkeeping. Photography, both color and black-and-white, was another method used to document the testing of site 41WY84 (Fig. 6).

RESEARCH DESIGN

All of the specimens recovered from site 41WY84 were sent to the
laboratory at Prewitt and Associates, Inc. for processing and analysis.
Processing of specimens included washing, labeling and cataloguing.
Permanent curation has been arranged with the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) , The Uriiversity of Texas at Austin.
More-detailed discussion of the techniques used for each form of
data recovery is given below.
2x2-rn Units
Excavation of Test Area A involved the initial excavation of one
lxl-m unit in arbitrary 10-cm-thick levels for vertical control.
All
fill was screened through 1/4-in mesh hardware cloth.
Unit N986/W986
was to be this initial lxl-m square and had been started as such, but
rain caused this plan to be altered. A second unit within Test Area A,
N985/W987, was selected and excavated as the initial unit in the manner
described.
Test Area A was selected for excavation because it occurs
within a part of the site where a surface concentration of bones and
fired clay lumps was found during the archeological survey. The information derived from this first test provided the basis for further
testing decisions.
Stratigraphic data obtained from N985/W987 established the depth of
the plowzone at the site.
Upon reaching a culturally sterile zone at
60-70 cm below the present surface, excavation of the unit was terminated and three adjacent lxl-m units were excavated to foZ1fi the rest of
the 2x2-m test.
Excavation of these units followed closely the techniques used for N985/W987 with one exception.
Specifically, in these
three units only matrix from certain of the levels below the identified
plowzone was screened through 1/4-in hardware cloth.
In this manner,
access to the probable cultural zone was expedited.
The coordinates
bounding Text Area A are:
N986/W987, N986/W985,
N984/W985 and
N984/W987.
The second 2x2-m unit, Test Area B, was located south and east of
Test Area A. Like Test Area A, Test Area B showed a relative concentration of cultural materials on the present surface (Fig. 7). A modified
excavation strategy was followed for Test Area B.
The plowzone was
removed for the entire 2x2-m area, and the cultural zone was then excavated separately for each of the four lxl-m units.
Furthermore, the
cultural zone was excavated as a stratigraphic unit using matrix color
and texture to identify its vertical extent. Only the matrix excavated
from the cultural zone was screened using 1/4-in hardware cloth. Upon
reaching the bottom of this cultural zone, excavation of Test B was
terminated. The coordinates bounding Test Bare: N951/W967, N951/W965,
N949/W965 and N949/W967.
All excavations at Test Areas A and B were accomplished manually,
using shovels, picks and trowels. The selection of the excavation tool
was dependent upon the requirements imposed by matrix conditions.
At
each 2x2-m test, a temporary datum was established at the highest corner. The elevation of each of these points was recorded in relation to
51

that of the permanent site datum.
The temporary unit datum was then
used to record relative elevations with the aid of a string line, line
level and metric hand tape for all four lxl-m units of each 2x2-m test.
All specimens recovered from Test Areas A and B were bagged according to minimum provenience unit.
Bag inventory slips with provenience
information and specimen data were also completed and included in each
bag.
Unit level forms were maintained for each level excavated and
representative profiles of the completed 2x2-m tests were drawn to scale
to show site stratigraphy.
Unsieved matrix samples taken from the northeastern corner of each
unit level excavated below the plowzone were collected from Test Areas A
and B.
Plowzone samples were taken from units N985/W987 and N986/W986
only.
The amount gathered for each sample filled approximately onethird of a #20 bag. After returning to the laboratory, about 800 cubic
cm was selected from each sample and retained.
The remainder of each
sample was then discarded.
Excavation information for Test Areas A and B is summarized in
Table 6.
Schematic drawings showing the uni ts in each Test Area is
provided in Figure 8.
Shovel Probes
Three shovel probes were excavated near the following grid points:
N920/W965, N900/W965 and N880/W965.
The stratigraphic information obtained from the two 2x2-m units was used to identify the plow and cultural zones.
Cultural zone matrix was sieved through 1/4-in hardware
cloth.
Each probe was terminated at the bottom of the cultural zone,
the maximum depth being about 43 cm below the present surface.

SITE DESCRIPTION

Site 41WY84 is situated between two northwest-southeast trending
relict interdistributary channel scars southeast of Willamar, Texas.
During the initial survey and assessment, cultural materials were detected both in a plowed field and in a cutbank of an adjacent earthen
drainage ditch. This drainage ditch runs generally north-south parallel
to the western edge of the site for a distance of . 36 km, and turns
eastward to parallel the southern edge of the site.

PART II: TESTING AND ASSESSMENT OF SITE 41WY84

During the testing, the drainage ditch was holding a small amount
of wa.ter. Vegetation was limited to the ditch cutbanks and consisted of
bermudagrass, johnsongrass, sunflowers and a few isolated mesquites.
Cotton is the usual crop planted in the field but had been harvested
prior to testing.
Surface visibility therefore varied from 30 to 100
percent along the ditch and was 100 percent in the field.
Elevations recorded during the testing are approximate due to the
lack of known survey points in the area. Mapping efforts were able to
establish, however, that the elevations of the site vary within a 20-cm
range at approximately 6.0-6.2 m (20.0-20.6 ft) above msl. The drainage
ditch elevations range over 2.4 m, from approximately 6.7 m (22.3 ft)
above msl at its highest point to approximately 4.3 m (14.3 ft) above
msl at the bottom of the ditch (see Fig. 8).

STRATIGRAPHIC INFORMATION
Test excavations revealed five discernible strata at 41WY84.
The
description of each is presented below from top to bottom, based on
field identifications made by Archeological Assistant Ron Holan and the
Project Archeologist.
References to matrix color are standardized Munsell soil color
designations (Munsell Color Co. 1975).
It should also be noted that
determinations of moisture levels are somewhat biased as a locally
intense rainfall occurred during the project.
Figure 9 presents a compilation of stratigraphic information in the
form of generalized cross sections and selected profiles from the site.
Table 6 also contains stratigraphic information.
Stratum I
Stratum I is a fairly unconsolidated surface plowzone. It is made
up of hard and blocky clods of dry, very dark grayish brown silty loam
(lOYR 3/2) within a loose matrix of gray sand (lOYR 5/2). Crop trash
such as roots and woody material was found mixed throughout the stratum.
No established root system was present, nor were any inclusions observed. Only one burrowing disturbance was encountered, at the base of
Stratum I in Test Area A.
The thickness of Stratum I varies from 2.5 to 13.5 cm. This variation is probably a result of continuous cultivation.
In viewing this
uppermost layer in cross section, it is apparent that the maximum depth
occurs between 1.2 and 1.1 m above site datum.
Stratum II
Stratum II is a more compacted zone. The matrix is slightly moist,
very dark grayish brown (lOYR 3/2) silty loam.
Its texture is slightly
gritty, indicating the presence of sand. A small number of sand inclusions and burrowing disturbances were encountered in this stratum. The

PART II: TESTING AND ASSESSMENT OF SITE 41WY84
burrows are of the same coloration as the surrounding matrix, distinguishable only by textural and compaction differences. The sand inclusions observed are either light brownish gray (lOYR 6/2) or medium brown
(lOYR 4/3).
The quantity of vegetal debris in Stratum II is much less than that
in Stratum I, with roots noticeably lacking. However, like Stratum I,
this zone is probably a plowzone. At the base of Stratum II are traces
of plow chisel marks and root stains. The combination of these factors
is interpreted here as evidence for deep rootplowing. Rootplowing is a
method extensively used locally for eliminating natural vegetation to
prepare an area for cultivation.
The maximum depth of Stratum II is variable, occurring between 0.9
and 1.1 m above site datum. Shovel probes in the southern site area
indicated a higher basal depth of 1.1 m above datum.
The range of
thickness of this zone is 15 to 20 cm.
Stratum III
The third stratum encountered at site 41WY84 is a densely compacted
loam. The matrix is very dark gray (lOYR 3/1) and appears to be more
compact and slightly moister than the strata above it. Fewer, lessprominent sand inclusions occur in this zone, and only two additional
burrowing disturbances were noted in Test Area A.
Root staining evident at both Strata II/III and Strata III/+v contacts suggests that the dark coloration of Stratum III could be attributable to organic content. No vegetal debris was found in this layer
but terrestrial snail shells and shell fragments (particularly Rabdotus
sp.) were visibly abundant throughout.
In the northern site area, the thickness of Stratum III ranges
between 8 and 15 cm.
From Test Area B southward, the thickness increases from 10 to 20 cm. The base of Stratum III is also irregular,
occurring between 0.85 and 1.03 m above site datum.
Stratum IV
Stratum IV was fully defined in only one lxl-m unit of Test Area A,
N985/W987. From this limited information it appears that Stratum IV is
a highly mottled clay loam, probably a transitional zone between Strata
III and V. The mottling is very dark gray (lOYR 3/1) while the matrix
is very dark grayish brown (lOYR 3/2).
Observations at unit N985/W987 indicate that Stratum IV is 3-14 cm
thick, with a maximum depth of 0.81 m above site datum. Overall, Stratum IV is dense and fairly moist, with no new burrowing disturbances or
inclusions detected.
Also absent from Stratum IV are any traces of
vegetal debris.

60

TEST RESULTS

Stratum V
In unit N985/W987 of Test Area A, a stratum of extremely compact
brown (lOYR 4/3) clay was encountered. The moisture level of this clay
is slightly less than that obserVed in Strata III and IV. Absent from
this layer are disturbances and inclusions.
The vertical extent and thickness of this stratum were not determined due to the termination of excavations at 0. 685 m above datum.
Nonetheless, observations made in the adjacent drainage ditch indicate
that this stratum continues below this depth.

TEST RESULTS

Ninety-two specimens were recovered from testing at site 41WY84.
With the material collected during the earlier survey, this brings the
total site assemblage to 103 specimens.
These items are classified
according to basic physical characteristics, thus producing five analytical categories:
knapped stone, faunal remains, fired clay lumps/
balls, charcoal flecks and metal. A graph summarizing the assemblage is
provided in Figure 10.

PART II: TESTING AND ASSESSMENT OF SITE 41WY84

SPECIMEN DESCRIPTIONS
Identifications are made using general descriptive divisions and
progress to more precise subcategories when possible.
The materials
recovered from the earlier survey project are described in Part I of
this report.
Knapped Stone
The intentional removal of flakes from stone in the process of tool
manufacture and use is reflected in the archeological record as finished
tools and chipping debris (debitage). At site 41WYB4, debitage is the
only recovered evidence of these activities.
The survey assemblage
includes two pieces of debitage. Testing yielded two additional specimens:

Faunal Remains
Thirty-four bone fragments were recovered from 41WYB4.
As indicated in Part I, seven fragments were collected during the initial
recording of the site.
The survey collection included one Bison sp.
fragment with a cut edge as well as six mammalian fragments, one of
which is charred.

68

TEST RESULTS
Most of the faunal remains recovered during the testing project are
unidentifiable fragments. Only three specimens exhibit charring, and
one is mineralized. All were recovered from Test Area B. A small number of fragments can be identified further:

N950/W967 (Level 3):

One vertebra and one distal humerus, both
One rodent-sized mammalian distal femur.

Terrestrial snail shell was also recovered during test excavations
for general density comparisons. Table 10 indicates that terrestrial
snail shells were present in each of the screened levels at Test Areas A
and B. The three shovel probes also produced snail material. The shell
recovered from screening is in such fragmentary condition that it cannot
be accurately speciated. Some of the more complete shells appear to
belong to the genus of Rabdotus. Table 10 presents the occurrence of
terrestrial snails in weight measurements.
Fired Clay Lumps/Balls
Clay lumps or balls with varying degress of thermal alteration are
commonly encountered in the project area. It has been documented that
these items were used prehistorically in hearth features due to the lack
of stone resources (Mallouf et al. 1977:189). However, this is not the
only process which produces clay lumps. Land clearing for agricultural
purposes includes the burning of vegetation which also produces fired
clay specimens. Thus, the fired clay lumps recovered from the disturbed
strata at 41WY84 have dubious cultural associations. Nonetheless, all
specimens encountered at the site were collected.
Two clay lumps were collected during survey investigations -- one
subcircular and one amorphous in shape. The coloration of the subcircular specimen grades from reddish yellow (7.5YR 7/6) to yellowish red
(5YR 5/6). The amorphous shaped lump is yellow (lOYR 7/6) in color.
Fifty additional clay lumps were recovered during the testing project. Sixteen of these were collected from the surface. The remainder
were retrieved from the screening of excavated matrix with one exception.
One large fired clay lump was encountered in Level 3 of Unit
N951/W967 and recorded in situ. This specimen grades in color from
brownish yellow (lOYR 6/6) to reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6). The maximum
dimension of this large lump is 51 mm and its shape is amorphous.
A summary of the physical characteristics of the fired clay lump/
ball specimens recovered from site 41WY84 is presented in Table 11. The

Charcoal
Eleven small flecks of charcoal were encountered at site 41WY84.
The charcoal was of insufficient quantity and concentration for radiocarbon assay.
Because of the paucity of this material, no distinction
between hearth activities or recent brush burning could be made.
Metal
Two metal specimens were collected from site 41WY84:

SPECIMEN DISTRIBUTIONS
Specimens from each of the analytical categories were found on the
surface of site 41WY84. The occurrence of these materials within the
20x20-m collection units is plotted on the site map (see Fig. 7). The
survey collection includes knapped stone, faunal remains and fired clay
lumps. The 20x20-m collection units yielded no additional knapped stone
but do contain specimens from each of the other categories.
It is important to emphasize that this site is in a field which has
undergone continuous cultivation for several decades. Test excavations
revealed two plowzones -- one shallow zone (Stratum I) which is believed
to reflect ongoing cultivation, and one deeper zone (Stratum II) which
appears to indicate deep rootplowing undertaken to clear the land of
vegetation. The materials recovered from the surface and Strata I and
II should therefore be considered displaced. The matrix characteristics
and amount of specimens recovered from Stratum III support its identification as the remnant of the original cultural deposit. Stratum IV was
not thoroughly investigated but does seem to indicate a relative paucity
of cultural materials.
Vertical specimen distributions are presented in Table 12.
The
results are given in terms of actual totals for each analytical category
as well as in percentages relating to the overall site assemblage and
each individual category. When the data are analyzed in this manner,
the amount of disturbance at 41WY84 is readily apparent. Over 50 percent of the assemblage was retrieved from disturbed contexts, accounting
for all of the knapped stone and most of the charcoal and faunal material. Although the lower reaches of Stratum III seem fairly intact, no
features or activity areas could be discerned.
Cultivation and deep
rootplowing have undoubtedly displaced a fair amount of what was probably a sparse cultural deposit, possibly reflecting a basic adaptation
to a low resource density area (Hester 1981).
On the basis of the limited investigations undertaken, it seems
that Stratum III, the cultural zone, dips slightly to the south. The
only distinction detected in this stratum is in the differing densities
of faunal remains in Test Areas A and B. A significantly larger amount
was recovered from Test Area B.

DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY
Evidence of aboriginal occupation is limited and sparsely scattered
at site 41WY84. Knapped stone is particularly scarce, indicating limited lithic tool use and manufacture.
This situation may be accounted
for by the lack of local lithic resources.
Faunal remains suggesting hunting are more abundant.
Some show
signs of cultural modification in the form of charring.
Two of the
recovered bone fragments identified as Bison sp. are especially significant due to the limited amount of bison remains reported locally. Of

73

PART II: TESTING AND ASSESSMENT OF SITE 41WY84

particular interest is the bison specimen collected during the survey
phase which has a cut edge, indicating animal processing.
Fired clay lumps are the most numerous specimens in the 41WY84
assemblage. One-half of the clay lumps .and a minute amount of the charcoal were produced from the relatively intact cultural zone.
These
materials probably reflect food preparation and other hearth-related
activities.
Finally, the presence of metal objects is believed to derive from
recent land use.
No undisturbed associations between the metal and
aboriginal specimens could be established.

COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS
The results of testing at 41WY84 are compared with data recovered
from test excavations at two other sites in Willacy County, 41WY71 and
41WY72 (Day 1981:54) (Table 13). When considering relative frequencies,
sites 41WY71 and 41WY84 have several similarities -- both lack ground
stone and ceramics.
Sites 41WY72 and 41WY84 are similar in that they
both lack cores and marine shells.
Unlike site 41WY72, site 41WY84 yielded no temporally diagnostic
artifacts. Furthermore, 41WY84 appears to have a single component while
41WY71 and 41WY72 were stratified, undisturbed deposits. Despite these
differences, general similarities between the three sites exist. "Hunting and gathering adaptations appear to be suggested by the material
remains of each site.
The information gathered at these sites is insufficient to make
accurate assessments regarding aboriginal seasonality patterns, social
group size or temporal range.

ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Test excavations conducted at site 41WY84 revealed it to be a
highly disturbed, single aboriginal component of probable prehistoric
age.
Since temporal diagnostics were not recovered and sufficient
amounts of material for radiocarbon assay were lacking, more precise
temporal placement of the component is not possible.
Because of the apparent lack of intact, significant deposits, it is
felt that further work at site 41WY84 would be scientifically unproductive at this time. Furthermore, nomination to the National Register of
Historic Places is not warranted on the basis of the test results presented in this report. Archeological clearance is therefore recommended
for the proposed Willacy County Drainage District No. 1 Main Floodway
Channel alignment.
