EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

In conjunction with the proposed resurfacing of a portion of Ocean Drive, southeast of Magnolia
Beach, Calhoun County, Texas, a Phase I cultural resources assessment was undertaken to satisfy
state requirements for the identification and evaluation of cultural resources that might be
affected by the road work. The Ocean Drive resurfacing will encompass approximately 1,850
feet of Right-of-Way (ROW) beginning at the intersection of 24th Street and moving north.
Due to the potential impacts from the proposed resurfacing of Ocean Drive on cultural resources
properties (i.e., archaeological sites and historic-era buildings, structures), Geo-Marine, Inc., was
contracted by Tim F. Glendening and Associates, Inc. to conduct the Phase I studies (Geo-Marine
project number 30646.00.01), under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 5551, to record and
evaluate cultural resources in the area of potential effects (APE), as required by the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 [42 U.S.C. §§ 4321–4347; P.L. 91-190; 83 Stat. 852],
the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended through 2000 [16 U.S.C. §
470 et seq.; P.L. 89-665; 80 Stat. 915].
The Phase I investigations conducted on February 22-24, 2010 consisted of two tasks: (1)
archaeological survey; and (2) historic architectural resources survey. In accordance with
guidance from the Texas Historical Commission (THC) for this project, the architectural survey
recorded all buildings that are 45 years of age or older. Two historic-age architectural resources
were recorded in the architectural survey APE; neither is recommended eligible for listing on the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). No buried cultural deposits were identified during
the intensive survey of the archaeological APE. Within the APE for the architectural survey, two
buildings appear to have been constructed in or before 1965. Of those buildings, one is a motel
and one is a domestic single-dwelling. Neither of the historic-age architectural resources is
recommended eligible for listing on the NRHP.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

This report presents the results of a Phase I cultural resources assessment conducted in relation to
the proposed resurfacing of a portion of Ocean Drive, approximately 1.5 miles southeast of
Magnolia Beach, Calhoun County, Texas. The Magnolia Beach project area encompasses
approximately 1,850 linear feet of ROW which comprises the Area of Potential Effects (APE)
which would potentially be impacted by the resurfacing of the segment of Ocean Drive. The
ROW for the archaeological survey just involved the 50 foot Ocean Drive ROW, while the survey
for architectural resources made use of an expanded 150 foot zone extending from each side of
the Ocean Drive ROW. All construction and operation activities for resurfacing will take place
within the Ocean Drive ROW.
Due to the potential impacts of the proposed resurfacing of a portion of Ocean Drive to cultural
resource properties (i.e., archaeological sites and historic buildings and structures), Tim F.
Glendening and Associates, Inc., contracted with Geo-Marine, Inc., to conduct Phase I studies to
record and evaluate historic properties in the APE, as required by the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 [42 U.S.C. §§ 4321–4347; P.L. 91-190; 83 Stat. 852], the National
Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended through 2000 [16 U.S.C. § 470 et seq.;
P.L. 89-665; 80 Stat. 915. The results of the archaeological and historical architecture resources
surveys are the focus of this volume of the report.
The Phase I investigations conducted on February 22-24, 2010, consisted of two tasks: (1)
archaeological survey; and (2) historic architectural resources survey. In accordance with Texas
Historical Commission (THC) guidance for this project, the architectural survey recorded all
buildings that are 45 years of age or older. Two historic architectural resources were recorded in
the architectural survey APE; neither is recommended eligible for listing on the National Register
of Historic Places (NRHP). No buried cultural deposits were identified during the intensive
survey of the archaeological APE. Within the APE for the architectural survey, two buildings
appear to have been constructed in or before 1965. Of those buildings, one is a motel and one is a
domestic single-dwelling. Neither of the historic architectural resources is recommended eligible
for listing on the NRHP. All written records will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory in Austin for permanent curation and storage.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

This report presents the results of a Phase I cultural resources assessment conducted in relation to
the proposed resurfacing of a 1,850 foot portion of Ocean Drive, south-east of Magnolia Beach,
Texas (Figure 1). Due to the potential impacts of the proposed resurfacing of a portion of Ocean
Drive to cultural resource properties (i.e., archaeological sites and historic buildings and
structures), Tim F. Glendening and Associates, Inc., contracted with Geo-Marine, Inc., to conduct
Phase I studies to record and evaluate historic properties in the APE (GMI project #30646.00.01),
as required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 [42 U.S.C. §§ 4321–4347;
P.L. 91-190; 83 Stat. 852], the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended
through 2000 [16 U.S.C. § 470 et seq.; P.L. 89-665; 80 Stat. 915. This contract was initiated on 5
February 2010. The results of the archaeological and historical architecture resources surveys are
the focus of this report.
The Magnolia Beach project area encompasses approximately 1,850 linear feet of ROW which
comprises the Area of Potential Effects (APE). The APE for the archaeological survey involved
the 50 foot Ocean Drive ROW, while the survey for architectural resources took place in an
expanded survey area of 150 feet on both side of the ROW. Thus, the maximum extent of the
APE consists of both the Ocean Drive ROW (50 feet) and the architectural resources zone
extending 150 feet from both sides of the road ROW. Based on data obtained at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, one archaeological site (41CL39) is
recorded as present within the current project APE. Due to the presence of a recorded site within
the APE, an intensive survey methodology was developed to fully document the presence of any
undisturbed archaeological deposits within the Ocean Drive ROW.

CHAPTER 2
ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT

This chapter discusses the environmental setting of the Magnolia Beach Intensive Cultural
Resources Survey Project Area within the context of the Central Texas Coast. The project area is
located in Lavaca Bay, approximately 1.5 miles southeast of the community of Magnolia Beach
in Calhoun County. The following sections summarize the area‘s geology and geomorphology,
soils, hydrology, climate, flora, and fauna. Finally, biotic and nonbiotic resources that could have
been of potential benefit to prehistoric peoples are discussed.

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY
Although there have been few large-scale surveys of the coastal plain landscape that have
examined the geomorphology in detail, a solid start is provided by Abbott (2001), who compiled
a broad suite of local geomorphic and Quaternary stratigraphic information to achieve a similar
goal for the Houston District of the Texas Department of Transportation, which shares a
geological landscape similar to the project area. Site contexts within the coastal plain vary
significantly, for the landscape is dynamic, with factors such as alluvial sedimentation and
erosion, eolian deposition, colluvial deposition, and sea-level rise during the Holocene period, all
affecting site location and site integrity.
The project area consists of Pleistocene uplands overlain in some areas by coastal beach
sediments of alluvial derivation. The middle Texas gulf coastal plain is underlain by a series of
coastward-dipping fluvial and fluvial-deltaic deposits that have largely been mapped on the basis
of their geomorphic expression as morphostratigraphic units. These surfaces are generally
separated from one another by gentle scarps and often differ significantly in terms of their
topography and the clarity of relict fluvial geomorphic features preserved on their surface as
viewed from the ground (cf. descriptions in Sellards et al. 1932:786, 792–793) or on aerial
imagery. In general terms, as the surfaces become older, the definition of relict fluvial
geomorphic features diminishes, a process referred to by Fisk (1940) as ―landscape
deterioration.‖ The relationship of these surface deposits to subsurface geology is reported to be
somewhat tenuous (Winker 1990b). In the vicinity of the project area, the Pleistocene-age coastal
morphostratigraphic unit Beaumont Formation is present.

3

The Beaumont Formation
The Beaumont Formation is the youngest of the coast-parallel Pleistocene-age deposits. It crops
out on the coastward side of and laps onto the Lissie Formation. It was first named by Hayes
(1915) for exposures near Beaumont, Texas. Deposition of the Beaumont Formation is attributed
to fluvial-deltaic processes during an interglacial period. The surface of the Beaumont Formation
is generally flat and is known for its prominent vertisols and well-developed gilgai that cover
more than 4 million hectares (Nordt et al. 2006).
Beaumont Formation Age and Fossil Content: A few vertebrate fossils have been recovered
from the Beaumont Formation (most notably Elephas imperator Leidy), but the most common
fossils reported are marine and brackish water invertebrates such as Rangia cuneata Gray and
Ostrea virginica Gmelin (Deussen 1924; Sellards et al. 1932). These are of little assistance in
dating the unit. Radiocarbon ages have been used to constrain the upper limit of Beaumont
Formation deposition at around 35,000 years (cf. Birdseye and Aronow 1991:A223; Gaston 1979;
Nordt et al. 2006), but many samples of potentially radiocarbon datable material (shells and
wood) that have been dated returned ―dead‖ ages in excess of 40,000 years old (Aronow 1988;
Heinrich 2007; McFarlan 1961; Otvos 1971). The Beaumont clearly predates the Deweyville
terraces that are inset into it and mark the entrenchment of the modern streams. Recent
luminescence dating by Durbin (Durbin 1999; Durbin et al. 1997) has yielded ages for both the
Beaumont Formation and the Deweyville terraces along the Nueces River. Durbin et al. (1997)
report thermoluminescence (TL) dates for the Beaumont Formation derived from cutbank
exposures around Nueces Bay of 91.7±7.9 ka and 71.9±6.9 ka and suggest that these ages provide
an upper limit to Beaumont sedimentation that is consistent with TL dates from the High
Deweyville terrace of 52.6±5.2 ka by Durbin et al. (1997) and optically stimulated luminescence
(OSL) dates of 63.1±4.0 ka and 50.4±3.2 ka reported by Aiuvalasit (2006, 2007).
Recently, Blum and Aslan (2006) and Blum and Price (1998) have presented new stratigraphic
and geochronologic information for the Beaumont Formation near the mouth of the Colorado
River that demonstrates that it is considerably more complex than previously thought. In specific,
they have demonstrated that the complex of Beaumont Formation meanderbelts mapped by BEG
can be separated into at least three distinct incised valley fills that they informally named the
Lolita, El Campo, and Bay City. The oldest of these is the Lolita, which has yielded TL dates of
307 and 323 ka, placing its deposition in oxygen isotope stage 9. The intermediate age unit, the
El Campo, is undated but thought to have been deposited during oxygen isotope stage 7, whereas
the youngest Beaumont-age incised valley deposit, the Bay City, has yielded TL dates from
channel sands that range between 155 and 102 ka, placing its deposition during the falling sea
levels of oxygen isotope stage 6 and the sea level high-stand of oxygen isotope stage 5. As a
result, Blum and Aslan (2006) suggest that the Beaumont Formation likely includes deposits from
the entire post-Lissie period but preceding the incision and deposition of the first Deweyville
Formation deposits. This interpretation is in opposition to previous impressions of the Beaumont
Formation as a last interglacial high-stand deposit.
SOILS
There is one soil type within the APE: Psamments (beach) deposits (Figure 2). The entire APE
consists of gravelly beds of Psamments containing fine and very fine shell fragments mixed with
varying amounts of sand – with water present at a depth of approximately 24 inches. Psamments
of this type are commonly of zero to one percent slopes (Mowery and Bower 1978). This soil
unit is of high salinity but is commonly used as a building and road material.
4

HYDROLOGY
The uplands of the APE are devoid of natural fresh water sources. The project area fronts Lavaca
Bay which is part of the greater Matagorda Bay system of the Central Texas coast.

CLIMATE
The climate of the project site can be characterized generally as subtropical humid (Larkin and
Bomar 1983). Data from a local climate monitoring station (Southern Regional Climate Center
[SRCC] 2008) show an average daily maximum temperature of 80°F, with an all-time maximum
of 111°F in 2000, and an average daily minimum temperature of 61°F, with an all-time low of
9°F in 1989. The mean wind speed throughout the year is 10 mph, with a record high of 83 mph
in 2003. Relative humidity in Victoria averages 76 percent but increases dramatically throughout
each night, rising from a 6:00 P.M. average of 60 percent and a 6:00 A.M. average of 91 percent.
Precipitation averages 40 inches per year, with a 24-hour record of 10 inches in 1991, and
snowfall is negligible (SRCC 2008).

FLORA
According to the TPWD broad-scale map, Vegetation Types of Texas (Frye et al. 1984), the APE
lies within the bluestem grassland vegetation type. The APE is bordered by marsh to the west
and coastal beaches to the east. Common plants in the APE include bushy bluestem, slender
bluestem, little bluestem, silver bluestem, three-awn, buffalograss, bermudagrass, brownseed
paspalum, single-spike paspalum, smutgrass, sacahuista, windmillgrass, southern dewberry, live
oak, mesquite, huisache, baccharis, and Macartney rose (Frye et al. 1984).

FAUNA
Calhoun County is home to a variety of animal species. Mammals include whitetail deer
(Odocoileus virginianus), beaver (Castor Canadensis), armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus),
raccoon (Procyon lotor), opossum (Didelphis marsupialis), gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus),
and rabbit (Sylvilagus spp.). Birds residing in the area include herons (Ardea spp.), ducks (Anas
spp.), geese (Branta spp.), turkey vultures (Cathartes aura), hawks (Accipiter spp.), and owls
(Strigidae spp.). Several species of snakes, lizards, frogs, and turtles are among the reptiles and
amphibians living within Victoria County. Some of the aquatic species native to the county are
gar (Lepisosteus spp.), gafftopsail catfish (Bagre marinus), eel (Anguilla spp.), clam (Rangia
cuneata), eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica), and several mussel species (McGuff 1978;
White et al. 1989).

RESOURCE POTENTIAL
Lavaca Bay and to a lesser extent, the adjacent uplands, provided a wide range of resources useful
to indigenous hunter-gatherers. The climate was generally warm to hot, with relatively low levels
of rainfall. Even though no natural caves and shelters were present, the climate did not typically
require tremendous investments in constructing substantial buildings. Much of the vegetation
6

tended to be thorny, but this does not seem to have been a major impediment to human
movement; after all, Cabeza de Vaca traversed the area in the 1530s in a nearly naked state of
dress (Krieger 2002).
Generally, prehistoric sites are found near water rather than in dry upland contexts (Ricklis 2004).
The Pleistocene-age Beaumont terraces discussed previously under Geology and Geomorphology
would have provided excellent settlement locations as sea (and river) levels rose throughout the
early and middle Holocene, reaching modern ranges approximately 3,000 years ago (Paine 1991).
Given that few grinding implements have been recovered from prehistoric sites in the area, it
seems likely that edible legume beans and pods were pounded in wooden mortar and pestles.
Stone cobbles also served as heating elements in stone boiling or griddle cooking activities; other
stones were used as heating elements in hearths for a wide range of activities.
The region also has a great diversity of animals, as discussed previously under Fauna. Many of
the larger animals could have been hunted using atlatl darts, spears, and later by bows and arrows;
the smaller game might have been caught in wooden snares or deadfalls. After meat and hides
were removed, animal bones provided the raw materials for various tools and ornaments such as
pins and beads. Lacustrine, and estuarine environments along Lavaca Bay would have provided
abundant resources, including various varieties of shellfish and finfish. Shell middens
demonstrate a continuous subsistence focus on local mollusks from Archaic through Historic
times, as well as utilization of fish with breeding cycles dependent on estuarine salinity
fluctuations (Ricklis 2004). In addition to nutrients, mollusks also provided shells that could be
made into scrapers or ground into fragments for use as ceramic temper in the Late Prehistoric
period (although it must be said that the clays in the immediate study area often include a sandy
fraction that serves as a natural temper, obviating the need for additional temper material).

CHAPTER 3
CULTURAL CONTEXT

INTRODUCTION
Based on early taxonomic divisions within coastal archaeology (Ambler 1967; Aten 1983;
Campbell 1960), the Texas Gulf Coast has been divided into three basic zones: upper, central,
and lower coasts. This review of prehistory and history will only include the central Texas coast
in general, and more specifically, it will focus on the current project site and the surrounding
region within a 20-mile radius. The central Texas coast is most commonly discussed as
extending from the Colorado River south to the northern reaches of Baffin Bay (Ricklis 2004).
This area includes the barrier islands and coastal fringes and continues inland for approximately
25 miles. The central Texas coast has survived as a useful geographical unit because its
geomorphology, namely its five estuarine bay systems, has produced rather unique and bounded
assemblages from at least the Late Archaic period (1150 B.C–1000 A.D.).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Professional archaeological investigations on the Central Texas coast date back to the early
1930s. However, work in the immediate area of the APE is limited to one General land Office
(GLO) survey performed in 1974 (Fritz 1975). The GLO survey recorded a total of seven
archaeological sites. Five of the surveyed sites (41CL33, 41CL34, 41CL35, 41CL36, and 41CL
37) were described as prehistoric shell middens of unknown age. The remaining two sites were
described as a nineteenth century cemetery (41CL38) and the location of Indian Point (41CL39).
Indian Point was also known as Karlshaven, the site of a ninteenth century German settlement.
The site boundaries for Indian Point (41CL39) are located within the current project APE and the
only site within one kilometer of the project area. No previous architectural studies conducted
within or near the APE were discovered during this study.

CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY
Thomas N. Campbell (1960) was the first to fully synthesize the archaeology of the Texas central
and lower coasts. Using information from many of his own excavations within Copano Bay and
Laguna Madre, along with other existing yet sparse information, Campbell created a basic two8

part chronology: the pre-ceramic Archaic Aransas focus, followed by the Late Prehistoric
Rockport focus. These taxonomic designations were created using artifact typologies and
apparent stratigraphic relationships without the assistance of radiocarbon dating techniques.
Since Campbell‘s (1960) synthesis, there has been a tremendous increase in the number and
complexity of archaeological research projects along the central Texas coast. The vast majority
of this research in recent decades has been carried out as cultural resources management projects.
Many attempts have been made to organize the large amount of archaeological data from this
region into a cultural chronology that is both generally accepted and integrates well with adjacent
areas. As part of a review of south Texas archaeology, including the coast, Stephen L. Black
(1989) created a taxonomic cultural sequence for the central coast. Black‘s elaborate system of
―phases‖ is a significant expansion of Campbell‘s simplistic two-part chronology. In Black‘s
system, there are eight phases from just the Late Archaic to Historic periods. Richard Weinstein
(1992) further expanded Black‘s work, but cultural chronologies for the central Texas coast are
still the focus of much debate and little agreement (cf. Ricklis 2004).
In order to avoid debates of taxonomy, the current review will use a simple chronological
framework when discussing the indigenous archaeology of the central Texas coast (Table 1).
This chronology includes the Paleo-Indian (ca. 9200–5500 B.C.), Early Archaic (ca. 5500–2200
B.C.), Middle Archaic (ca. 2200–1100 B.C.), Late Archaic (ca. 1100 B.C.–A.D. 1000), Late
Prehistoric (A.D. 1000–1700), and Early Historic (A.D. 1700–1800) periods.

Paleo-Indian (ca. 9200–5500 B.C.)
The Texas coastal region underwent dramatic changes in geomorphology throughout the late
Pleistocene and early Holocene. By the peak of glaciation within the Pleistocene (ca. 20,000
B.C.), sea levels were at least 100 m below current levels. Global warming trends ca. 18,000
years ago triggered sea level increases, which by 9,000 years ago allowed for the initial formation
of the modern bay systems of the central Texas coast (Brown et al. 1976; McGowan et al. 1976).
Sea levels continued rising throughout the early Holocene and did not approximate modern levels
until ca. 1,050 B.C. (Anderson et al. 1992; Brown et al. 1976; McGowan et al. 1976; Paine 1991).
The shallow water estuary/barrier island chain systems characteristic of the central Texas coast
began to approximate their modern forms during the end of the Middle Archaic Period ca. 3,000
years ago (Paine 1991).
Due to the dynamic nature of the Texas coast during the early Holocene, evidence of Paleo-Indian
archaeology is sparse on the central Texas coast and primarily consists of isolated, scattered finds.
Site 41VT112 is the only stratified site with Paleo-Indian components within the region.
Although some Paleo-Indian projectile points (Golondrina, Angostura and Plainview) were
recovered from the Morhiss Mound (41VT1) excavations of the 1930s, they were from mixed
contexts and provide little more data than the stray finds typified by site 41VT85 along the
Guadalupe River (Campbell 1976:84–85).

Early Archaic (ca. 5500–2200 B.C.)
For the first two millennia of the Early Archaic, sea levels continued to slowly rise, and the active
channels of the San Antonio and Guadalupe rivers were still below their current depths (Pearson
et al. 1986). Phytolith data indicate that throughout the Early Archaic period the environment
underwent a gradual transition to drier conditions (Robinson 1979). Given the amount of general
geomorphological and climatic change occurring throughout the Early Archaic, it has been
difficult for archaeologists to locate occupations dating to this period. In spite of two notable
exceptions, intact sites attributed to the Early Archaic are rare for the central Texas coast. The
two exceptions, the Morhiss Mound site (41VT1) and the Buckeye Knoll site (41VT98).

Morhiss Mound Site (41VT1)
When first investigated in 1932, the 300 x 400-ft mound was over 20 ft in height. A. T. Jackson,
and later his assistant, A. M. Woolsey, began initial trenching of the site in 1932. This initial
work resulted in the recovery of 10 human burials, Pleistocene fauna, and a range of artifacts
(Campbell 1976). Although later determined to be a natural Pleistocene (Deweyville) terrace,
Jackson believed the mound was anthropogenic in origin and should be more thoroughly
excavated.
As part of a WPA excavation, Morhiss Mound was once again investigated for a total of 16
months from 1938–1940 under the direction of W. A. Duffen (1940). Duffen‘s large WPA crews
often totaled more than 30 individuals, and they were able to excavate the entire mound, resulting
in the removal of 5,000 five-foot-square units. As methods of the day were crude, the excavated
material presently has little useful contextual information. Additionally, the excavation in its
entirety has never been properly published, and current knowledge of the site is limited to a few
10

specialists‘ reports (e.g., Dockall and Dockall 1996). However, approximately 7,000 artifacts and
200 human burials were recovered from the WPA excavation. Although no formal absolute
dating has been carried out on organics from Morhiss Mound, lithics have provided one of the
few glimpses into its chronology. The Early Archaic period is represented at Morhiss Mound in
the form of Gower, Hoxie, and Victoria diagnostic projectile points (Campbell 1976).

The Buckeye Knoll Site (41VT98)
Located adjacent to the Victoria Barge Canal, site 41VT98 is situated atop a surviving
Pleistocene terrace (Beaumont Formation). The large site was first identified by E. Vogt in the
1960s, but professional work did not begin at the site until the late 1980s when the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, Galveston District, initiated testing of several sites along the Victoria Barge
Canal (Weinstein 1992). Testing of site 41VT98 revealed stratified deposits in excess of 2.5 m
deep beginning with the Early Archaic period (Weinstein 1992). Additional testing began in
November 2000 under the direction of Ricklis, and although results have yet to be published,
initial reports indicate the presence of approximately 75 human burials dating to the Early
Archaic, along with significant amounts of faunal material and other cultural remains (Ricklis
n.d.).
Although intact archaeological deposits dating to the Early Archaic are rare for the central Texas
coast, it is significant to note that both Buckeye Knoll and Morhiss Mound are located within the
20-mile project region. These two sites both occupy remnant Pleistocene terrace formations that
would have provided natural protection in the floodplain of the Guadalupe River system during a
time of sea level rise. As the central Texas coast continued to transform to its modern
configuration throughout the Early Archaic, Pleistocene terrace remnants would have not only
provided natural protection but also a higher probability of preserving archaeological deposits.

Middle Archaic (ca. 2200–1100 B.C.)
Sites with Middle Archaic components are slightly more numerous than previous periods. It has
been suggested that by this time, the San Antonio estuary system would have extended farther
north than in previous periods (Prewitt and Paine 1988; Weinstein 1992). Dated oyster reef
deposits collected three miles north of Green Lake indicate that by the end of the Middle Archaic,
productive estuary resource systems were well established for the lower Guadalupe River valley
(Weinstein 1992).
As for prehistoric occupation during this period, both Morhiss Mound (41VT1) and Buckeye
Knoll (41VT98) contain diagnostic Middle Archaic projectile point types. Nolan, Travis,
Bulverde, Palmillas, Kent, and Tortugas types were recovered from Morhiss Mound (Campbell
1976). Both Bulverde and Kent Middle Archaic points were reported from the initial testing of
Buckeye Knoll (Weinstein 1992). Other probable Middle Archaic sites within region include
Sentinel Oak (41VT79), Linn Lake (41VT81), Texas West Indies Ranch (41VT9), and Eagles
Roost (41VT80).
Like the Morhiss Mound and Buckeye Knoll sites, other sites in the region with Middle Archaic
components are all located on Pleistocene terrace remnants at the river valley edge. The Texas
West Indies Ranch site (41VT9) contained both an occupation area and a possible Middle
11

Archaic cemetery in which a Palmillas point was found in association with one of the burials
(Huebner 1988). Nearby Linn Lake (41VT81) has produced Tortugas and Palmillas points, and
Bulverde dart points were found at Eagles Roost (41VT80) (Hester 1985). Lastly, Middle
Archaic Refugio projectile points were recovered from Sentinel Oak (41VT79). Both Blue
Bayou (41VT94) and Sentinel Oak (41VT79) have been tentatively associated with the Middle
Archaic (Weinstein 1992).
With the gradual stabilization of sea levels and establishment of active estuary systems
throughout the Middle Archaic, the central Texas coast likely became a more predictable
environment for the procurement of marine and brackish-water fish and mollusks. Throughout
this and previous periods, Pleistocene terraces were the preferred locations for sites.

Late Archaic (ca. 1100 B.C.–A.D. 1000)
The number of archaeological sites attributed to the Late Archaic period on the central Texas
coast is substantially greater than for previous periods. The reasons for the dramatic increase in
number of known sites for this time period are still uncertain. However, it has been suggested the
combination of sea level stabilization, increase in river sediments, and the gradual formation of
Matagorda Island would have acted to reduce salinity of the San Antonio Bay system, thereby
increasing the productivity of oysters and other estuarine resources (Nelson and Bray 1970;
Pearson et al. 1986) and leading to an increase in the population of people. Concomitantly,
evidence of Late Archaic subsistence is dominated by fish species—black drum, redfish, spotted
sea trout, and Atlantic croaker—whose yearly cycle is tied to estuary bay systems (Ricklis 2004).
In addition to the increased reliance upon estuarine resources, the archaeology of the Late
Archaic reveals a diverse shell tool industry and evidence of basketry (Campbell 1947, 1952;
Ricklis 1990, 2004). Although perforated oyster shell and edge-flaked clamshell scrapers are
known from the Early Archaic and continue to be found in later periods, the use of conch shell for
tools appears to begin only in the Late Archaic (Campbell 1952; Ricklis 1990, 2004).
Additionally, the number of bone artifacts (e.g., awls, socketed points) increases dramatically in
the archaeological record of the Late Archaic.
Within the Central Texas coast region, Late Archaic occupations include both sites with earlier
contexts—Morhiss Mound (41VT1), Blue Bayou (41VT94), Buckeye Knoll (41VT98), Sentinel
Oak (41VT79), Linn Lake (41VT81), and Eagles Roost (41VT80)—as well as numerous sites
upstream along the Guadalupe River and Coleto Creek and downstream adjacent to Green Lake.
From Morhiss Mound, Late Archaic diagnostic material has included Morhiss, Marshall, Lange,
Marcos, Darl, Ensor, and Fairland projectile points (Campbell 1976; Suhm and Krieger 1954).
Campbell (1976) suggests that the majority of the burials from Morhiss Mound were interred
during the Late Archaic period. Castroville, Marcos, Darl, and Fairland points were reported
from the Sentinel Oak, Linn Lake, and Eagles Roost sites, suggesting similar components among
sites along the western edge of the Guadalupe River valley (Weinstein 1992). Sites adjacent to
Green Lake revealed Late Archaic diagnostics, and both sites 41CL1 and 41CL62 contained shell
middens that gradually changed composition from mixed oyster and clam (Rangia) to
predominantly Rangia (Weinstein 1992). This transition in taxa is cited as evidence of the
Guadalupe River shifting to a more western course away from Green Lake, which in turn led to
more brackish conditions in the lake.

12

As the central Texas coast estuary bay systems began to increase their biotic productivity
throughout the Late Archaic, areas such as the lower Guadalupe River valley possibly began to
offer more opportunities for prehistoric activities. In addition to the continued use of existing site
locations (e.g., Morhiss Mound and Buckeye Knoll) during the Late Archaic, other areas (both
upriver and downriver) were for the first time associated with significant increases in
archaeology. The increase in both the number of sites and use of estuarine resources is a trend
that continues into the Late Prehistoric period.

Late Prehistoric (ca. A.D. 1000–1700)
Using a socio-cultural evolutionary taxonomic system, the end of the Late Archaic period on the
central Texas coast, like the remainder of the state, is signaled by the widespread adoption of the
bow and arrow and ceramics (Hester 1975, 1981; Suhm and Krieger 1954). Based on changes in
artifact types and suspected shifts in subsistence practices, the Late Prehistoric period for the
central Texas coast is divided into Initial Late Prehistoric (ca. A.D. 1000–1250/1300) and Final
Late Prehistoric ( ca. A.D. 1250/1300–1700) phases (Ricklis 2004).
The Initial Late Prehistoric phase along the central Texas coast is characterized by Scallorn and
Fresno arrow points along with plain, sandy paste ceramics similar to Goose Creek of the upper
Texas coast (Ricklis 2004; Weinstein 1992). By the Final Late Prehistoric phase, Perdiz arrow
points predominate along with a prismatic blade technology, thin bifacial knives, and Rockport
sandy paste ceramics (Fritz 1975; Ricklis 1996). Rockport ceramics are quite distinctive because
many have asphaltum decorations and were produced in a variety of shapes (e.g., bowls, jars, and
ollas) (Ricklis 1996).
Fishing continued to be a major focus of subsistence in the Late Prehistoric period and was
possibly of even greater importance than in the Late Archaic (Ricklis 1990, 1996; Weinstein
1992). At several sites (e.g., 41CL2) along the central Texas coast, Late Prehistoric fish-rich
middens are stratigraphically above Late Archaic shell middens, suggesting a possible shift in
resource selection (Weinstein 1992). Additionally, by A.D. 1250/1300, bison became a significant
resource for the region as numerous upland hunting camps, such as 41RF21, have been dated to
this period (Ricklis 1989, 1990, 1996).
The abundance of subsistence data gathered from Late Prehistoric sites has made it possible to
address issues of seasonality and group migration. Analysis of fish otolith data from large
shoreline sites has shown that the most important species (black drum and redfish) were collected
during the fall through early spring periods (Ricklis 1988, 1990, 1996). Additional data from
Rangia cuneata shells in river margin sites have revealed late spring through summer occupations
(Aten 1981; Carlson 1988; Ricklis 2004). Collectively, these data along with site size
information suggest large aggregations of groups occurred during the fall and winter months
along the coast, followed by a late spring and summer dispersal of smaller groups into upland
river margin settings. Ricklis (1990, 1992, 1996), using archival sources, has suggested similar
seasonality patterns existed within the early historic period Karankawa along the central Texas
coast.
Within the region, Late Prehistoric sites occupy a range of settings. Some of the major sites from
earlier periods (e.g., Morhiss Mound [41VT1], Sentinel Oak [41VT79], Buckeye Knoll
[41VT98]) have very small Late Prehistoric components, but others (e.g., Linn Lake [41VT81]
and Blue Bayou [41VT94]) either continued at earlier size/use or took on greater significance
13

during the Late Prehistoric period (Weinstein 1992). The larger sites for this period appear to be
near the coast and appear to have operated as large aggregation centers for winter fishing. One
such aggregation center is the Guadalupe Bay (41CL2) site. Although first established in the Late
Archaic, the Guadalupe Bay site has a significant Late Prehistoric component composed of
Rockport ceramics, Fresno arrow points, and large amounts of faunal material. Smaller sites for
this period are those located upstream along upland settings, often at the river margin. Many of
the smaller upland sites are indicative of hunting camps such as the Mellon site (41RF21) which
yielded concentrations of deer and bison bone (Ricklis 2004).
Settlement patterns appear to have changed by the Late Prehistoric, whereby the larger sites
upstream along the river margin such as Buckeye Knoll and Morhiss Mound were largely
abandoned, as large aggregation sites along the coastal edge, such as Guadalupe Bay, became
prevalent. At the same time that upland sites such as Morhiss Mound were falling out of use,
many more were being created upstream along the river margin as short-term hunting/fishing
camps. In some cases, sites that were active in earlier periods such as Linn Lake appear to be the
focus of hunting and possible trade activities well into the historic period (Hester 1985; Weinstein
1992).

Historic Period (ca. A.D. 1519–present)
Prior to any permanent European settlement on the Texas coast both French and Spanish
explorers traveled in the area of present-day Matagorda Island. Spanish explorers were among
the first Europeans to document what is now Matagorda Bay. In 1519, Alonso Alvarez de Pineda
visited the locality as part of an expedition to map the Gulf coast from Florida to Vera Cruz
(THRS 1941:1). Within a decade, on November 6, 1528, Alvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca and his
crew arrived on the Texas coast near Galveston after a difficult expedition in Florida, and later
traveled in the vicinity of Matagorda Bay during their eight year journey to Culiacan, Mexico
(THRS 1941:1; Weber 1992:42-44).
Though the Spanish recorded the area in the 16th century, Europeans did not establish any
encampments in the vicinity of Matagorda Bay for over a century. In 1685, the French explorer
Rene Robert Cavalier, Sieur de La Salle, landed on the Texas coast during his voyage to locate
the mouth of the Mississippi River. Having miscalculated the latitude and longitude of the river‘s
confluence with the Gulf of Mexico three years earlier, LaSalle traveled the Texas coast looking
for the mouth of the river behind the region‘s numerous barrier islands (Weber 1992:42-44).
LaSalle devised to construct a settlement from which to base his further explorations, and
identified a location in early 1685 in present-day Calhoun County. Located five miles up
Garcitas Creek from Matagorda Bay, La Salle ordered his crew to begin construction on a fort,
which he named Fort St. Louis (Weber 1992:149). After two years of further hardships including
loss of their ships, bouts with disease, and hostile encounters with Native Americans, a group of
LaSalle‘s men murdered the explorer in March 1687. In 1689, a Spanish expedition sent to locate
LaSalle‘s settlement discovered remains of the destroyed fort, and the bodies of a three colonists
who had remained after LaSalle‘s death (Weber 1992:152). Fort St. Louis and its related ship La
Belle, have been the focus of intensive archaeological investigations in recent years (Davis and
Bruseth 2000; Bruseth and Turner 2005).
LaSalle‘s short tenure at Fort St. Louis marked the first attempt at European settlement in presentday Calhoun County. Numerous European-Americans began settling in Southeast Texas under
land grants issued by the Republic of Texas beginning in the late-1830s. The first permanent
14

European-American settlement at Indian Point occurred in 1842 when the board of land
commissioners for Jackson County issued a headright certificate to Samuel A. White. White,
after receiving the land grant, constructed a home on the land at Indian Point (Malsch 1977:7).
Two years after White settled at Indian Point, he encountered Prince Carl of Solms-Braunfels, a
representative of the Society for the Protection of German Immigrants, or the Verein zum Schutze
deutscher Eidwanderer in Texas (commonly abbreviated as ‗the Verein‘) (Jordan 1975:41;
Malsch 1977:7). The Verein was formed on April 20, 1842 at Biebrich am Rhein in Germany.
The Verein appointed Solms-Braunfels commissioner to the Texas colony in May 1844, and the
prince left for Texas the same month (Malsch 1977:6). The Verein consisted of wealthy German
noblemen who sought to provide economic and social relief in Germany by acquiring land in
Texas and encouraging emigration to their colonies. In turn, the members of the Verein hoped to
one day see a profit from the venture once farming and other activities made land values in the
colony increase (Jordan 1966:43).
Prior to his arrival at Indian Point, Solms-Braunfels had first traveled to Galveston, where he
found no accommodations or land available for the society‘s recruited settlers. Solms-Braunfels
traveled south along the coast searching for a more favorable location to establish a port at which
to disembark persons traveling to the society‘s colony. Solms-Braunfels identified Indian Point
as an appropriate location to disembark German immigrants for the journey into the society‘s land
grant, located further inland. The point, located ―on the northern end of a low, sandy strip of land
along Lavaca and Matagorda Bays,‖ was ―virtually islanded by the bays, lakes, bayous, and
marches‖ (THRS 1941:6). The location at which Indian Point projects into the water is the
location where Lavaca and Matagorda bays join; unlike other locations along those bays in 1844,
the water at Indian Point was of sufficient depth to allow ships traveling through Pass Cavallo to
easily and safely dock (Malsch 1977:6). Solms-Braunfels made arrangements with Samuel White
whereby German immigrants would land and camp near White‘s residence upon their arrival
(Malsch 1977:7).
Solms-Braunfels arrived at Indian Point in late 1844 ahead of several hundred German settlers
who were to land there before making their way to the area of present-day New Braunfels,
approximately 300 miles away (THRS 1941: 6; Fritz 1975: 58; Malsch 1977:8). The Adelsverein
had procured a land grant in that region, but had not established any amenities, nor constructed
any shelter there. The society‘s first group of immigrants arrived at Galveston on November 23,
1844, and sailed for Indian Point shortly after. Three more vessels arrived at Indian Point in
December of that year to find no quarters or amenities at ―Karlshaven‖ (Karl‘s Harbor), as the
German immigrants referred to the community (Malsch 1977:7, 11). Some immigrants,
discouraged by the Verein‘s obvious lack of planning, elected to remain in the vicinity of Indian
Point rather than continue on into the interior colony once a route inland was attempted early in
1845 (Malsch 1977: 8).
Approximately three miles south of Karlshaven, a small settlement centered on a customs house
and several cabins was also established in 1844 (THRS 1941:6). The settlement was located on
Powderhorn (sometimes written as ―Powder Horn‖) Bayou, and one of the cabins was reportedly
reserved for Prince Solms-Braunfels (THRS 1941:6). The limited number of houses at
Powderhorn Bayou was in no way close to substantial lodging for the thousands of immigrants
that arrived at Indian Point in 1844-47. Due to the large number of persons arriving during that
time period, immigrants at Karlshaven lived in tents before moving further inland or constructing
homes of their own, either on the coast, or between the coast and New Braunfels (Jordan 1966:52;
Seeligson n.d.; THRS 1941:6).
15

Due to poor planning and poor execution, the Verein went bankrupt in 1847 (Jordan 1966:45).
Thousands of German settlers had settled in areas along the road to the interior, including DeWitt,
Victoria, and Goliad counties (Jordan 1966:52). Like the settlers in those areas, the German
settlers at Indian Point planted roots and established communities, and essentially became the first
Euro-Americans to settle in southeast Texas in significant numbers.
Calhoun County was formed in 1846 from portions of Jackson, Victoria, and Matagorda counties
(Guidry 198 1: ―Calhoun County History‖). By that year, an estimated 1000 German immigrants
had arrived at Karlshaven (Fritz 1975:58). Despite bouts with numerous illnesses and the
elements, many settlers remained at Karlshaven and began to establish permanent institutions.
George Thielepape surveyed Indian Point in 1846 for Samuel White and William M. Cook,
generally regarded as the town‘s founders. The plan laid out 733 building lots on 82 blocks,
including lots for both a public and market square (Malsch 196:15-17). The following year, the
United States established a Post Office at Indian Point. Transportation to and from the growing
town developed as well, when, in 1848, John B. Brown established regular weekly stagecoach
service from Victoria to Indian Point, which was meant to capitalize on the arrival of the New
Orleans-based shipping firm of Harris & Morgan. The shipping firm established a weekly
schedule between Galveston and Matagorda Bay, with Port Lavaca as its terminus in the area
(Malsch 1977:20).
Indian Point enjoyed increasing prosperity as a port throughout 1848. William Cook moved into
a large wharehouse in January, and constructed a wharf for his commission business. In late
1848, Harris & Morgan constructed a long wharf at Indian Point to accommodate their ships.
Despite the collapse of the Verein under its bankruptcy, European immigrants continued to arrive
steadily at Indian Point (Malsch 1977:22-23). On February 1, 1849, Indian Point was renamed
Indianola at the suggestion of Mrs. (Mary) John Henry Brown. Mrs. Brown reportedly derived
the name by combining the word ―Indian‖ with ―ola,‖ the Spanish word for wave (Wolf 1999:23).
No sources state what prompted the change of name, but residents adopted the new name, though
it was not long before broader developments resulted in yet another name change for Indianola.
In 1849, officials at Port Lavaca increased dockage fees at the city‘s port. As a result of the
increase in fees, Charles Morgan of Harris & Morgan relocated the firm‘s Matagorda Bay
terminus to Powderhorn Bayou (Malsh 1977:39; THRS 1941:8). The bayou and adjoining lake
were suited for use as a harbor, and had more land fronting the water on which a town could
expand. Powerderhorn Bayou, in the vicinity of the customs house and dwellings constructed
circa 1844, was at that time a small, residential community (THRS 1941:8). Johann Schwartz,
one of the Verein‘s early immigrants, constructed a home there after purchasing land from
Samuel White in 1845, and was later regarded as the first settler in Indianola (Malsch 1977:8).
Initially envisioned as an extension of Indianola, Powderhorn (also known as Brown‘s Addition)
eventually eclipsed Indian Point or ―Upper Indianola‖ in size and commercial import (Malsch
1977:43). Many residents of Indian Point relocated to Indianola, and Indian Point became known
as ―Old Town‖ (Fritz 1975: 58). In 1852, Indianola at Powderhorn became the county seat, and
was incorporated as the city of Indianola in 1853 (THRS 1941:9). Though regarded as the upper
portion of Indianola, Old Town lacked the significant commercial activities that made Indianola a
thriving port for over two decades following its incorporation. Though commercial activities
were centered in Indianola, Indian Point evidently retained residential and religious facilities, as a
Reverand Holcinger, a Lutheran minister, reportedly relocated from Matagorda Island to Indian
Point as early as 1854 to preach there (Seeligson n.d.). The focus of most historical studies,
16

however, shifts to Indianola after 1850 and it seems Old Town assumed alesser role in the region
as it does in the historical record.
In 1875, the first of two large hurricanes struck the city of Indianola, causing significant damage.
Destruction was widespread and approximately 270 of the city‘s estimated 2,000 residents were
killed (Malsch 1977:244; THRS 1941:14). Despite the loss of lives and property, the city rebuilt
and attempted to re-establish its prominent role as a Texas seaport. Commerce suffered however,
due in part to the Morgan Line reducing trips to Indianola by 50 percent (THRS 1941:14). Old
Town was also damaged in the storm, but one report notes, ―the destruction of Old Town was
great, although no lives were lost there‖ (THRS 1941:14).
In August 1886, another hurricane devastated Indianola, and a fire followed the storm itself,
essentially destroying much of what the storm had not. The city was subsequently abandoned,
leaving the narrow strip of land along the bay with no settlement of significant size. Port Lavaca
became the county seat once again. The devastation in Indianola and the subsequent exodus of its
residents and institutions was so great that there is virtually no information on the condition of
Old Town. Due to its proximity to Indianola, the community that was left at Old Town after the
1875 hurricane most likely suffered substantial damage as well. The inscription on a headstone at
Old Town Cemetery reveals the storm‘s impact on at least one survivor whose husband died in
the storm; the headstone for David Lewis, died August 20, 1886, reads, ―Departed this life by
drowning in the great Cyclone. Farewell, O husband dear, farewell. Thou hast left me lonely‖
(Wolff 1999:115).
Though historians have written little about developments in Indianola, Indian Point, or Magnolia
Beach from late 1886 to the present day, photographs in a few local histories reveal that the area‘s
waterfront location was utilized as a resort and fishing destination in the early 20th century, while
field work for this study revealed that Indian Point and Magnolia Beach are utilized for that
purpose at present. Sunbathers were photographed at Indianola in 1918 (Baker 1986:66), while a
photograph of Magnolia Beach from 1920 showed several small beach houses that ―attracted
resort dwellers and Sunday sightseers‖ and had ―been replaced many times during the past 55
years‖ (Frier 1979:194). A U.S. military camp that utilized tents for barracks was established at
Indianola during World War II, mirroring Indian Point‘s original use as a tent colony (CCHC
1981:296).
Indian Point appears to be have been used primarily as a resort area for tourists and fishing
enthusiasts for several decades. An aerial photo from 1977 indicates little development in the
area aside from an RV camp and a small number of residences. Web searches for Indianola and
Indian Point today produce several advertisements for fish camps, rental houses, small hotels, and
RV parks. The area‘s location, which once resulted in its rapid growth, has proven to be a
hindrance to any substantial permanent construction, and the twentieth century brought several
more hurricanes including significant storms in 1919, 1942, and 1961 (CCHC 1981:297, Malsch
1977:270). Projecting into deep waters on the west shore of Matagorda and Lavaca bays, the
point remains vulnerable to storm surges and damage from high winds brought by tropical storms
and hurricanes. Today, the effects of the storms and adaptations to their inevitable occurrence are
evident in the numerous vacant lots, extensively patched and repaired standing structures, and the
predominance of moveable housing types (namely mobile homes and RVs) in and around Indian
Point.

CHAPTER 4
METHODOLOGY

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH
Prior to fieldwork, a search of the available archival data was undertaken by the Principal
Investigator who reviewed data sources housed at TARL and in the Texas Archaeological Sites
Atlas to obtain information on previous investigations and known sites within the project APE or
located within one kilometer of the project area. An examination of geological sources, available
early historic maps, and aerial photographs was instrumental in forming a background for the
history of the area. Only one archaeological site (41CL39) was located within one kilometer of
the APE. Site 41CL39, is the recorded location for the abandoned town of Indian Point. The site
was recorded as part of a Government Land Office (GLO) archaeological survey performed in the
area in 1974 (Fritz 1975). The results of the research were used to guide the field methods, to
determine the areas in which previously recorded sites would be encountered, and to locate
landforms with the highest probability to retain archaeological deposits. These data also served
as a contextual framework so that any newly recorded sites could be evaluated for significance.
In preparation for the architectural survey, the project architectural historian searched the Texas
Historic Sites Atlas to identify any previously recorded or designated structures within the APE;
none were found. Additionally, no recorded cemeteries are located within the APE, or within 500
feet of the proposed work. Research efforts at the Victoria Public Library, the Plano Public
Library, and the Texas/Dallas History & Archives Division of the Dallas Public Library provided
both primary and secondary sources from which the historic context was developed. A limited
number of historic aerial photographs were located, which were used in conjunction with Calhoun
County Appraisal District (Calhoun CAD) records to assist in determining dates of construction
for architectural resources documented during the field survey.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY
From February 22 -24, 2010, Geo-Marine, Inc., undertook the intensive archaeological survey of
the proposed location of road resurfacing to be completed on a 1,850 foot section of Ocean Drive,
approximately 1.5 miles southeast of Magnolia Bay, Texas. The total APE for this project was
approximately 1,850 feet in length with a right-of-way width of 50 feet.
18

Archaeological survey methodology consisted of systematic shovel testing along two transects;
one on each side (east and west) of the existing road. The entire archaeological APE was
considered to be high probability for encountering intact cultural deposits given that the entire
project area is within the site limits of 41CL39 and as such, the entire 1,850 foot ROW was
subjected to visual inspection and systematic shovel testing at 30 m (98.4 ft) intervals.
A two-person field crew performed the archaeological survey of the project area using the above
methodology. The crew was equipped with a Trimble® Pro XH global positioning system (GPS)
unit for recording the position of data such as shovel tests, property boundaries and the limits of
the Ocean Drive ROW. All shovel tests were approximately 30 cm (11.8 in) in diameter and
were excavated either to the top of the B horizon or to a depth of 80 cm (31.5 in), whichever
came first. Soil from each shovel test was screened through 0.25-inch hardware cloth. All
artifactual material, whether encountered on the surface or in shovel tests, was collected and
analyzed.

ARTIFACT TREATMENT AND ANALYSIS METHODS
No archaeological materials were collected during the survey of the project area. No prehistoric
or historic-era artifacts were found during the survey.

HISTORIC ARCHITECTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY
Historic architectural resources within the Magnolia Beach project APE were documented and
evaluated for NRHP eligibility by an architectural historian who meets the Secretary of the
Interior‘s professional qualification standards. Fieldwork was conducted on February 23, 2010.
The project historian recorded all historic resources within the APE with digital photography and
field notes, and evaluated these resources based on National Park Service (NPS) standards for
identification and evaluation of historic properties, as presented in 36 CFR Part 60.4 [a—d]. In
brief, historic-age resources may be eligible for listing on the NRHP if they possess significance
for at least one of the following criteria:
A. be associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns
of our history; or
B. be associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
C. embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or
represent the work of a master, or possess high artistic values, or represent a significant
and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
D. have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history.
Not only must a resource possess significance for at least one of the three criteria, to be eligible
for inclusion in the NRHP, it must also maintain a certain level of integrity. The National
Register defines seven aspects of integrity: (1) location, (2) design, (3) setting, (4) materials, (5)
workmanship, (6) feeling, and (7) association. Although not all seven aspects of integrity must be
present for the resource to be eligible, the resource must retain, overall, the defining features and
characteristics that were present during the property‘s period of significance.

SURVEY RESULTS

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY RESULTS
Intensive survey of the APE consisted of shovel testing performed at 30-m intervals along two
transects. Transect one was located east of Ocean Drive within the ROW limits, while transect
two was located to the west (Figure 3). The total APE for this project was approximately 1,850
feet in length with a right-of-way width of 50 feet. The APE was located within a developed
residential area adjacent to Lavaca Bay, Calhoun County, Texas. The APE contained several
areas that could not be shovel tested due to street crossings and standing water. In total, 16
shovel tests were excavated during the survey of the Ocean Drive APE. No buried archaeological
deposits were identified during the intensive survey of the APE.
Both transects began at the northern terminus of the APE and shovel tests were numbered
sequentially (for each transect) moving south (see Figure 3). The northern end of the APE was
typical of the project area in general with Ocean Drive fronting seasonal R.V. parks and beach
homes (Figure 4). Throughout the project area, the Ocean Drive ROW consisted of cleared
drainage ditches backed by a low to almost level berm.
A representative shovel test from the APE consisted of mixed sediments (5Y 4/1, dark gray, clay
sand mottled with shell hash beach deposits). All shovel tests were excavated until reaching
water, which varied in depth from 25-40 cm (Figure 5). Modern roadside debris was noted in
shovel tests to a depth of 40 cm and included vehicle safety glass and bathroom tile fragments.
Although no clay is listed on the USDA soil survey for the APE, it was mixed with excavated
sediments throughout the project area. Palcedo clay is listed on the USDA soil survey for the
area several hundred meters to the north of the APE.
The deeply buried modern roadside debris and mixed clay fill deposits, suggest heavy disturbance
within the APE since the abandonment of Indian Point or Karlshaven (41CL39) in the later part
of the nineteenth century. Based on the current survey results, there appears to be no remaining
archaeological evidence of the long abandoned settlement of Indian Point. Even the only
archaeological evidence of Indian Point noted in the Fritz (1975) survey (a shelcrete cistern
foundation) is no longer present on the adjacent beach front. The two nineteenth century
hurricanes and citywide fire along with significant beach erosion and modern development have
profoundly affected the archaeological deposits of site 41CL39. Today, the area consists of
modern beach residences and motels (Figure 6).

HISTORIC ARCHITECTURAL SURVEY RESULTS
No buildings or standing structures associated with the historic settlement of Indian Point or Old
Town are extant in the APE or surrounding area. The majority of architectural resources in the
APE are domestic dwellings, permanent structures associated with RV parks, small motels, and
outbuildings and awnings associated with the domestic dwellings. Within the APE for the
architectural survey, two buildings appear to have been constructed in or before 1965 (Figure 7).
Of those buildings, one is a motel and one is a domestic single-dwelling. Neither of the historicage architectural resources is recommended eligible for listing on the NRHP. THC Historic
Resources Survey forms for the recorded historic architectural resources are located in Appendix
A of this report.

General Comments on Architectural Resources in the APE
Several of the buildings within the project APE share similar design characteristics and materials.
Of the 20 buildings in the APE, all but two were domestic dwellings. Most commonly, domestic
dwellings in and around the APE are elevated on timber piers or pilings, a foundation commonly
seen and often required by local building codes in coastal areas. Typically, the area underneath
the house remains open. Domestic dwellings are typically one story with gabled roofs. The
majority of buildings feature no architectural ornamentation or discernable stylistic influences.
Due to their similarity in form, assessment of the application and type of building materials
present on the buildings was most helpful in estimating dates of construction for those buildings
23

without records in the Calhoun CAD database. Those buildings without Calhoun CAD records
that were determined to post-date 1965 feature massing, fenestration, placement of materials and
doors, and structural elements that are not consistent with pre-1965 construction (Figures 8–10).
Two buildings listed in this report as historic have noticeable features such as wood window
casings, wood sash windows, exposed rafter beam ends, and wood plank or asbestos shingle
siding that clearly predate 1965.

Historic Architectural Resources Recorded within the APE

Resource 01
Located at 1301 N. Ocean Drive, an L-shaped building associated with the Bayshore Courts RV
camp appears to pre-date 1965 (Figure 11). Exterior siding consists of a mixture of concrete
fiberboard and asbestos shingles. The building has side-gabled wings with a composite shingle
roof. Exposed rafter beam ends are visible on all elevations except the gable ends. Single-hung,
one-light wood-sash windows are present on the west and north elevations. Both aluminum- and
wood-sash windows are present on the south and east elevation (the elevation facing the bay).
Concrete piers visible on the north and west elevations indicate a pier-and-beam foundation is in
place. At the east end of the north wing, timber piers partially support a second story addition
which was most likely constructed circa 1970. A one-story dwelling atop timber piers is attached
to the north elevation of the addition (Figure 12). The dwelling appears to have been constructed

in the late 1970s or early 1980s due to its size, building materials (specifically horizontal vinyl
siding and vinyl decorative shutters), and inset front porch, which are common among other
residences in that area constructed during the same era.
Based on its style and materials, an estimated date of construction for the L-shaped building is
circa 1940. The massing and placement of doors and windows indicate that the building
originally served as a motel, an association that it maintains. Resource 01 maintains its historic
function as a motel in a coastal community, but is not found to have a significant association with
historic events or persons (Criteria A and B), nor does it represent the work of a significant
architect or engineer, nor display distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction (Criterion C), nor does it have the potential to provide information about prehistory
or history (Criterion D). The building lacks sufficient historical and architectural importance for
individual listing on the NRHP under Criteria A, B, C, or D, therefore, Resource 01 is not
recommended eligible for listing on the NRHP.

Resource 02
Resource 02 is a single dwelling located on the west side of N. Ocean Drive (Figure 13). The
one-story, front-gabled building is supported by unfinished (most likely pine) timber piers.
Exterior siding consists primarily of horizontal wood siding; however, a portion of the north
elevation has been clad in standing-seam metal siding, as has the roof. Exposed rafter beam ends
are visible on the north and south elevations. Double-hung, two-light aluminum-sash windows
are located on the north, south, and west elevations, all of which are installed in wood casings,
which appear to predate the aluminum windows. On the east elevation, large windows flank a
single-door entry, the only extant entry on the building. A raised deck, also supported by timber
piers, is present on the east elevation. The materials and arrangement of fenestration and doors
indicate Resource 02 was constructed circa 1950. The building appears to have always been a
residential building, and maintains that association, though it appeared to be vacant at the time of
the field survey.
Though it maintains its historic function as a domestic dwelling in a coastal community, Resource
02 is not found to have a significant association with historic events or persons (Criteria A and
B), nor does it represent the work of a significant architect or engineer, nor display distinctive
characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction (Criterion C), nor does it have the
potential to provide information about prehistory or history (Criterion D). The building lacks
sufficient historical and architectural importance for individual listing on the NRHP under
Criteria A, B, C, or D, therefore, Resource 02 is not recommended eligible for listing on the
NRHP.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Archaeologists and an architectural historian from Geo-Marine, Inc., conducted an archaeological
survey and historic architectural resources analysis of the approximately 1,850 foot section of
Ocean Drive to be resurfaced. Archaeological survey and a historic architectural resources
assessment were conducted along the entire length of the project area. In the present study, the
archaeological survey was restricted to the 50 foot Ocean Drive ROW, while an expanded zone
(150 feet on each side of the 50 foot Ocean Drive ROW) was utilized for the historic architectural
resources analyses.
Archaeological survey methodology consisted of systematic shovel testing along two transects;
one on each side (east and west) of the existing road. The entire archaeological APE was
considered to be high probability for encountering intact cultural deposits given that entire project
area is within the site limits of 41CL39 and as such, the entire 1,850 foot ROW was subjected to
visual inspection and systematic shovel testing at 30 m (98.4 ft) intervals.
Excavated shovel tests within the APE revealed disturbance likely related to numerous storms as
well as previous road construction activities that included excavation activities as well the
introduction of clay fill deposits. Modern roadside debris was detected in all shovel tests and was
detectable at depths of approximately 40 cm, the deepest any shovel test could penetrate before
reaching standing water. No historic or prehistoric archaeological materials were detected in any
of the excavated shovel tests.
An architectural historian recorded all historic resources within the APE with digital photography
and field notes, and evaluated these resources based on NPS standards for identification and
evaluation of historic properties, as presented in 36 CFR Part 60.4 [a—d]. The field survey for
the historic architectural resources investigation found two of 20 buildings in the project APE to
be of historic-age (constructed in 1965 or before). No marked or previously recorded cemeteries
were located within the architectural survey APE or within 500 feet of the proposed work. Of the
two buildings in the historic architectural resources survey APE, none are recommended eligible
for listing on the NRHP (see Appendix A for the THC Historic Resources Survey forms for the
recorded historic architectural resources).

30

The archaeological and architectural investigations identified no cultural deposits or potentially
NRHP eligible structures within the Ocean Drive APE. Therefore, no further cultural resources
investigations are considered necessary, and no further work is recommended for the 1,850 foot
Ocean Drive APE.
