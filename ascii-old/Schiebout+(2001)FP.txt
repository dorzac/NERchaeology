13. ABSTRACT (Maximum 7£)0 words)

Focus of paleontological research on the Miocene of Fort Polk has shifted to the stratigraphically lower localities, particularly
the TVOR SE site, which contains a mix of marine and terrestrial animals. It is the only site that has yielded a varied fauna to quarrying.
Mammal teeth are now being recovered from TVOR SE clays at rates comparable to those of previous work on layers rich in soil-formed
nodules.
TVOR SE fossils occur in a resistant sandstone or in clay just above it, and include remains of small whales, camels the size of
Aepycamelus, maychippinehorses, prosynthetocerines, and very large perciform fish. Foraminifera, both from the Miocene and
reworked from the Cretaceous, have been recovered. Large oysters with both valves (cf. Crassostrea), common in the sandstone layer,
suggest that the marine component has K,robablyundergone less trans~ort than the terrestrial component, for which no two elements
of an individual animal have been foun . The possibility that the foss' ferous layers record a storm and its aftermath is being
investigated.
Other Fort Polk Miocene sites have amtinued to be productive. DISC Site has yielded merychippine horse and
prosynthetocerine material, and two beautifully preserved tortoise shells.

ABSTRACT

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Focus of paleontological research on the
Miocene of Fort Polk has shifted to the
stratigraphically lower and more marine influenced of two bands of localities, particularly the
TVOR SE site, which contains a mix of marine
and terrestrial animals. It is the only site which
has yielded a varied fauna to quarrying. Previous
emphasis was on fossiliferous conglomerates rich
in soil formed nodules, which generally lacked
specimens larger than the teeth of cricetid,
heteromyid, and geomyoidrodents, which are their
most common identifiable mammal contents.
These three types of rodents are now beingrecovered from TVOR SE clays at rates comparable to
those from to the conglomeratic concentrations.
TVOR SE fossils occur in an approximately
20 em layer of resistant argillaceous and calcitic
quartz sandstone, or in clay just above it, and include both petrosals of a small whale, one vertebra of a marine mammal, a radius of a camel the
size ofAepycamelus, a merychippine horse upper
molar, a prosynthetocerine mandible fragment,
and dorsal spines ofvery large perciform fish, most
similar in size and robustness to those of modem
very large marine perciforms like groupers. The
spines are probably from fish over 2 meters long.
Foraminifera, both from the Miocene and reworked from the Cretaceous, have been recovered.
Large oysters with both valves (cf. Crassostrea),
common in the sandstone layer, but not cemented
to one another, suggest that the marine component has probably undergone less transport than
the terrestrial component, for which no two elements of an individual animal have been found.
The possibility that the fossiliferous bed records a
storm and its aftermath is being investigated.
Other Fort Polk Miocene sites have continued to be productive. DISC Site has yielded
merychippine horse and prosynthetocerine material to surface search. Two beautifully preserved
tortoises from DISC, including both carapace and
plastron, have just been prepared so that study
on them can commence.

We wish to thank individuals at Fort Polk,
especially Director of Public Works, LTC, EN,
Edward Mazion, Jr. and his environmental staff,
including Dr. Charles Stagg, James Grafton, Robert Hays, and Ellen Ibert for their help and cooperation which made this research possible. We
greatly appreciate being allowed to study specimens in or on loan from other institutions. Mary
Lee Eggart of the LSU Department of Geography/Anthropology drafted figures and Kerry Lyle
of the LSU Coastal Studies Institute took photographs. Gary Byerly, Xiaogang Xie, Zhong Geng
Ling, and Kun Lian provided microphotography
expertise. Discussions with many colleagues including Dr. Zhexi Luo of Carnegie Museum of
Natural History on whale material and Dr. Hank
Bart of'fulane University on fish were very helpful. Dr. Barun Sen Gupta of the LSU Department
of Geology and Geophysics identified Cretaceous
foraminifera and Dr. Peter McLaughlin, Senior
Scientist, Delaware Geological Survey, identified
the Miocene foraminifera. The U. S. Geological
Survey, Ruston, Louisiana, office, drilled and cored
three fifty-foot holes for sedimentological, stratigraphic, paleopedologic and other study. James
Rogers, a consultant retired from the U. S. Ge0logical Survey, logged thewellcoring on these three
cores. The U. S. Geological Survey shru.'ed core
material on the 100-foot well (Well 3) at Discovery
(DISC) Site. Many LSU students have assisted
with field work on the Fort Polk Miocene. Michael
Williams, Christy Wright, andKelli Wilson helped
in work on TVOR SE in 2001. John Grubb assisted with report formatting, and Coy Computer
Inc. was very helpful in managing computer equipment problems.
Work has been and is currently supported
by the U. S. Army FORSCOM, on contracts administered and managed by U. S. Army Corps of
Engineers, Fort Worth District, issued under contracts to Prewitt and Associates, Inc. Support has
also been provided by the LSU Museum of Natural Science.

I. INTRODUCTION
Background

General Geologic History,
Regional Correlation, And
Depositional Environments

This is the third report since 1994 for
the Corps of Engineers to be prepared on a
portion of the work supported by the D. S.
Army FORSCOM on contracts with the Corps
of Engineers via Prewitt and Associates.
Publications in the scientific literature and
presentations at scientific meetings are given
in Appendix C. The fauna has grown
appreciably, both in numbers and in taxa
recovered. The Fort Polk Miocene fauna
occupied 577 numbers in the Vertebrate
Paleontology collections of the LSD Museum
of Natural Science at the completion for the
first report (Schiebout, 1997b), 3,991 numbers
for the second report (Schiebout and Ting,
2001), and now numbers 4,389.
Before the discovery of the Fort Polk
Miocene sites, there was only a single report
of Miocene land animal remains from
Louisiana (Arata, 1966), the tips of the lower
tusks of a gomphothere (Mammalia:
Proboscidea). Arata (1966) estimated that the
specimen was from Miocene beds of Fort Polk,
and it could have come from the vicinity of
one of the sites currently under study in this
project, but precise locality information on it
was not available. Only a single proboscidean
specimen, a tooth fragment, has been
recovered in the current work on Fort Polk
(Schiebout, 1997b, p. 60), so our work has not
provided a solid link to the occurrence of that
specimen. The previous lack of Louisiana
Miocene fossil mammals results in most
genera recovered in the research on the Fort
Polk Miocene fauna being new to the state.
In the following report, emphasis is on
the TVOR SE site and its fauna. Technical
terminologx for fossil teeth (Appendix A) and
abbreviations (Appendix B) are given in the
Appendices.

The upper half of the Castor Creek
Member ofthe Fleming Formation (Figure 1)
has yielded the mammals discussed in this
report. The Castor Creek Member underlies
the Blounts Creek Member, uppermost of the
six members in the Fleming Formation, which
outcrop in a broad band crossing Fort Polk.
Further information on the extent,
composition, and depositional environments
of the Member is found in Rogers and
Callandro (1965), Jones et al. (1995), Hinds
(1998, 1999), and McCulloh and Heinrich
(2000). Correlation of at least part of the
Castor Creek Member with beds exposed at
Burkeville, Texas has been based in part of
their both containing the Potamides matsoni
fauna (Figure 2) of brackish water
invertebrates (Rogers and Callandro, 1965;
Turcan et al., 1966; and Hinds, 1998). The
Castor Creek mammal faunas of the DISC
site have been correlated with the Cold Spring
Local Fauna of east Texas (Figure 3), younger
than the stratigraphically lower Burkeville
Local Fauna of Wilson (1956) (Schiebout et
al. 1996,Schiebout, 1997a, 1997b;Schiebout
et al. 1998; Schiebout and Ting, 1998;
Schiebout and Ting, 2001), but determination
of the age of the TVOR SE site (Figure 3),
which may be Burkeville, is one of the goals
of work on the site. The upper Castor Creek
Member was deposited during a period of
falling sea levels, and TVOR SE,
stratigraphically lower than most of the sites,
is the first site with an appreciable marine
component. It contains a mixture of terrestrial
and marine forms and was probably deposited
in a shallow marine environment.

II. METHODS

near TVOR Site. A third site, called Shamrock,
just outside the Fort Polk boundary, has yielded
Miocene rhinoceros material which is
considered with the rest of the Fort Polk
fauna. Relative heights and stratigraphic
relationships are given in Figure 33.
TVOR sites are named after the
terminal very-high frequency omni range
radar tower, off of Exchange Road. TVOR SE
is an erosional gully striking E-W. Natural
exposure is mainly yellow and gray clay with
patchy, complex masses of harder sandstone
which contain both oysters and bones of
medium to large terrestrial mammals.

Field and laboratory methods of fossil
recovery are given in detail in Schiebout
(1997b), Schiebout et al. (1998), and Schiebout
and Ting (2001). Dooley et al. (in press)
focuses on bulk lab methods. Laboratory
treatment of the Fort Polk Miocene
conglomerates involves soaking chunks in
approximately 10% acetic acid to partially
dissolve and break up the rock, which releases
the fossils and nodules as a residue, which is
then sorted under the microscope to pick out
small fossils, mainly bone scrap and teeth.
Sandstone from TVOR SE that is strongly
cemented with calcite is treated as the nodulerich conglomerates are. Mudstone from the
site is dried, soaked in water, and sceened
without acid treatment. Material washed
from TVOR SE totals 1,029 pounds. TVOR
SE and Shamrock were the only sites where
quarrying was a major collecting method and
TVOR SE is the only current active quarrying
site (Figure 4, 5, 6). Removal of calcium
carbonate nodular material, other mineral
coatings, and clay from large vertebrate
specimens is accomplished mechanically,
either with an engraving tool or with mounted
needles and dental tools.
A clay sample from TVOR SE was
processed with the goal in mind of recovering
small foraminifera which would go through
the screens used to recover small mammal
teeth. It was processed by Lorene Smith,
Invertebrate Collections Manager, LSU
Museum of Natural Science. The sample was
soaked overnight in soap and water, boiled
ten minutes, and then wet screened using a
230 mesh (63 micron) U.S. standard testing
sieve. No foraminifera were recovered.

IV. SYSTEMATIC
PALEONTOLOGY
Descriptions of taxa which have already
been described in Schiebout (1997b) or
Schiebout and Ting (2001) are abbreviated.
PALEOBOTANY
Clays at TVOR SE are rich in pieces of
charcoal (Figure 7). Wood is not identifiable.
INVERTEBRATE ANIMALS
FORAMINIFERA
Invertebrate microfossils were expected
from the Castor Creek Member sites because
the Potamides matsoni invertebrate fauna had
been reported from the Member in Louisiana
and the member was considered to be brackish. Schiebout (1997b) reported upon the failure to recover any foraminifera or ostracodes,
and Schiebout and Ting (2001) reported on the
failure to recover any fish otoliths, another
expected microfossil, despite processing of
promising clays. Regular laboratory procedure
in our lab is to screen sediment removed from
bone in the process of preparation for study.
When clay removed from mammal bone from
TVOR SE was washed and screened, both reworked and Miocene foraminifera were recovered.

III. SITE DESCRIPTION
More detailed descriptions of sites
worked prior to 2001 are given in Schiebout
(1997b) and Schiebout and Ting (2001). Fossil
sites occur in two main clusters, those near
the original Discovery Site (DISC) and those

(pers. com.) This is the long-expected first
Miocene foraminiferan. It is an open ocean,
outer neritic form.

Ray teeth were the first fossils from
TVOR SE and have also been recovered from
TVOR S, for a total of two from each site as
reported in Schiebout and Ting. (2001). One
additional ray (LSUMG 12119» has been
recovered from TVOR SE since then.

Crassostrea, usually a brackish water form
(Laurie Anderson, pers. comm.), are common
in the TVOR SE sandstones (Figure 12). They
do not show well on broken pieces of the rock
but are clearer on sawn slabs. Some isolated
oysters are seen in the TVOR SE clay (Figure
13). Pieces of badly weathered large invertebrate shell are common in the vicinity of the
sandstone patches at TVOR SE. The material
is usually a friable white powder, but a few
pieces retain enough detail to make it clear
that they were part of large bivalves.

large fish spines.
Discussion All of the large fish spines from
TVOR SE are being catalogued with a single
number. The number of spines has passed
the number that a single individual would be
expected to yield, but which spines belong together and the total number of individuals
cannot be determined.
Large fish spines from TVOR SE are attributable to a very large perciform fish, probably similar to the modern grouper or the giant sea bass, based on comparison with modern osteological specimens oflarge marine fish
in the collections at Tulane University and
conversations with Tulane ichthyologist Dr.
Hank Bart. With the number of large symmetrical spines, interpreted as dorsal spines,
now over 30, more than one very large fish
has to have been present. The absence of other
parts of the fish, for example, more than one

(pers. comm.) has commented upon the fact
that the Fort Polk dorsal spine specimens are
sharper than such spines usually seen in modern forms. The modern very big perciforms are
usually immune from predation, and the Miocene ones may have been preyed upon by
animals no longer present.

APLODINOTUS sp.

have been recovered from DISC and both have
just undergone cleaning and stabilization, as
they arrived in the laboratory on December
10, 2001. It is expected that a more detailed
identification of these specimens will be possible after study and comparison. They both
include most of the dorsal shell (carapace) and
the plastron, and are the single most complete
specimens from the Fort Polk Miocene.
LSUMG 12224 has the slightly concave plastron of a male and LSUMG 12223 has the flat
plastron more likely to be indicative of a female. TVOR SE has yielded a single fragment
of tortoise shell, LSUMG 12237.

Dung of carnivorous animals is most likely to
fossilize because of its chemistry and because
it often contains bone from which calcium may
be leached to form calcium carbonate to cement the mass. These specimens are recognized on their shape and are probably from a

can not be separated reliably to apply to either
equid species recognized in Schiebout and
Ting (2001), and could well belong to an equid
or equids for which dental material is as yet
unavailable. LSUMG 12233, an accessory
metapodial distal end, shows an articulation
for an accessory toe, proving that at least
some of the Fort Polk Miocene horses are
three-toed.

TVORSEPALEOECOLOGY

Family CRICETIDAE

Palynological work by John Wrenn,
reported in Schiebout and Ting (2001),
indicated that the TVOR SE region included
a mixed hardwood forest with pines, and that
TVOR had less abundant hardwoods than
TVOR SE, with more open and wetter areas
in the region. Phytoliths indicate a grassy
savanna habitat associated with all sites
(Schiebout and Ting, 2001, p. 28), but it must
be kept in mind that 40% of them were
unidentifiable and that the phytoliths were
affected by diagenesis.
In Schiebout (1997a, b) and Schiebout
and Ting (2001), percentages of the three most
abundant rodent types were used for
estimation of relative amounts of forest and
open areas at Fort Polk sites. Modern
heteromyid rodents prefer open areas, and
cricetid rodents prefer wooded areas (Dorsey,
1977). DISC had been the site with the
highest percentage ofthe possibly-burrowing
geomyoids until screening began at TVOR SE,
which is now the most geomyoid-rich site
(Figure 32). TVOR SE has approximately
twice as many cricetids as heteromyids. This
is a pattern inconsistent with previous results
in which the site with the highest percentage
of geomyoids was also the lowest in cricetids.
High percentages of geomyoids and low
percentages of cricetids had been interpreted
to indicate a relatively more open and possibly
drier situation at DISC (Schiebout and Ting,
2001). Several explanations for the TVOR SE
situation are possible. DISC and TVOR SE
have much smaller numbers of rodents
recovered than do TVOR and Stonehenge. The
relative percentages of rodent types might
change considerably with increased
screening. The TVOR SE site clearly drew
from a mix of environments including both
marine and terrestrial ones, and may well
include mammals from a mix of terrestrial
environments. Possible relative upland or dry
land indicators at TVOR SE include

COPEMYS

Figure 27
The TVOR SE Copemys fall close to those
of TVOR in size (Figure 28).

v. PALEOECOLOGY
INFORMATION ON DISC
PALEOPEDOLOGY
Soil morphology and classification
Slickensides, redoximorphic features,
and carbonate nodules are the common pedogenic features found in DISC core III
paleosols (Figure 29). These features suggest
that pedogenesis took place in an environment
that was for the most part subtropical, but
had a dermed dry season as evidenced by welldeveloped carbonate horizons and slickensides
in many ofthe paleosols. The presence of welldeveloped slickensides would suggest that
these ancient soils were subjected to periods
of wetting and drying producing this pedogenic feature common to vertisols. In addition, the presence of carbonate nodules also
suggests that these paleosols were dry for
some time during pedogenesis. Redoximorphic
features are also common in vertisols and suggest a high fluctuating water table.
Xrd analyses
Figure 31 and Table 3 show the clay minerals present in b horizons of DISC core II.
Quantitative analyses of the clay fraction indicates that the most abundant clay mineral
is kaolinite, followed by smectite and then illite (Table 3). Kaolinitic soils commonly occur
in tropical and humid climates.

from the DISC conglomerates to indicate an
early Late Barstovian age, in part because of
the presence of the rodent Copemys. The lowest stratigraphic occurrence of Copemys at
DISC cluster is at Stonehenge Site and the
highest is the main DISC conglomerate layer.
In the TVOR cluster, its highest occurrence is
at the main TVOR conglomerate, approximately level with the top of the TVOR core,
and its lowest is at TVOR SE. Copemys from
TVOR SE plot with Copemys from TVOR in
size (Figure 32).
In comparison with a sequence of Miocene local faunas in east Texas (Wilson, 1956;
Tedford et aI., 1987), DISC Site has been considered most closely equivalent to the sites of
the Cold Spring Local Fauna (Schiebout,
1997a; Figure 2). Surface search at the DISC
exposure, just above the main DISC conglomerate, has yielded a prosynthetocerine jaw
similar to the prosynthetocerine seen in the
Cold Spring Local Fauna, different from the
animal seen in the underlying Burkeville Local Fauna. The most diagnostic TVOR SE vertebrate for comparison with the east Texas
faunas is a Prosynthetoceras mandible fragment (LSUMG 11207), which is similar to the
equivalent portion of the DISC animal, suggesting that that TVOR SE is Cold Spring
equivalent. The TVOR SE specimen is only a
scrap of mandible with one premolar, so this
is a very tentative conclusion.
Occurrence of the Potamides matsoni
zone (based on invertebrates) in the Louisiana subsurface in conjunction with benthic
foraminifera had led Tedford et al. (1987,
p.176) to conclude that the age of the
Burkeville Local Fauna (vertebrates) in east
Texas is between 14.5-13.0 Ma. Fort Polk work
has sharpened his estimate. The terrestrialmammal-bearing Fort Polk Miocene beds lie
between 13.9 Ma and 12.6 Ma in age based on
magnetostratigraphy, and the highest main
fossiliferous levels at Fort Polk, DISC, are at
approximately 13.5 Ma (Schiebout and Ting,
2001). DISC is Cold Spring equivalent, so the

The marine component at TVOR SE also
includes a mixture of forms from different
environments. The oysters are shallow marine
or brackish water dwellers (Laurie Andersen,
pers. com.). The presence of oysters with both
valves is considered more diagnostic of the
depth (relatively shallow) of the TVOR SE site
than the foraminifera from deep water and
the cetaceans. According to Peter McLaughlin
(pers. comm.) the occurrence of a large specimen of keeled globorotalid such as
Globorotalia menardii generally suggests
outer neritic or deeper (> 100 m) water depths,
and there should be other, shallower-dwelling planktonic forams such as Globigerinoides,
where this species occurs. Screening to recover
such small forms was unsuccessful (Lorene
Smith, pers. comm.).

VI. BIOSTRATIGRAPHY
Paleobotany and Invertebrates
Schiebout and Ting (2001) reported John
Wrenn's palynological results for TVOR SE
and 1.67-1.69 m in the TVOR Core as indicating an age no older than about 11 million years
(Styzen, 1996; Wrenn, 1996). Approximately
11-12 my was the earlier estimate for the top
of TVOR Core (Schiebout, 1997B). TVOR SE
foraminifera include Globorotalia menardii
which indicates an age of -12 Ma or younger
(peter McLaughlin, pers. com.).
Vertebrates
Several papers arising from this research
(Schiebout, 1994, 1996, 1997a; Schiebout et
al. 1996, Schiebout and Ting, 1998; Schiebout
and Ting 2001) have focused on the age of the
Fort Polk Miocene sites, considering finds

29

r

Burkeville must be older than 13.5. The age
range of the Barstovian is 15.9 Ma to 11.5 Ma,
and Late Barstovian is 14.8-11.5 according to
Woodburne and Swisher (1995). This
magnetostratigraphic work is consistent with
the Fort Polk Miocene sites being within the
Late Barstovian.
Palynological research suggests an age
for TVOR SE no older than 11 and the
foraminifera-based estimate is no older than
12, but a combination of magnetostratigraphy
and vertebrate biostratigraphy suggest an age
older than 13.5 Ma (Figure 33) Work on fossil
vertebrates, invertebrates and pollen and use
of additional dating techniques is needed to
unravel this contradiction.

rine environment, perhaps a bay or estuary, a
storm coming in from the Gulf could have
brought whale and large fish inshore, and retreating storm surge and rivers swollen after
heavy rains could have brought the terrestrial
materials out to cover the oysters. Why no
other part of the large fish, other than the
spines, has yet been recovered is currently not
understood, as modern large perciform fish
have lots of heavily ossified parts in their
skulls, and a relatively heavy vertebral column and ribs. Whale petrosals become separated from skulls relatively easily, so the lack
of other whale skull material is less of a problem to explain.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

VII. TAPHONOMY

TVOR SE is the first Fort Polk Miocene
site to yield a marine vertebrate and marine
invertebrate microfauna. It is the first site to
yield enough invertebrate shell for some large
invertebrates to be identified, the first site to
yield whale material, and the first site to yield
foraminifera. Early in the work at Fort Polk,
it would have been sensible to expect recovery of all three, but as the years of surface
search and screening went on with no success
in these areas, it seemed likely that there
would never be success. The relatively small
size of the Fort Polk outcrops has meant that
odds of anyone particular find are low.
TVOR SE continues to yield surprises.
Screening clay there is as productive of small
terrestrial mammal teeth as is dissolving and
screening of conglomerates rich in soil-formed
nodules at other Fort Polk Miocene sites. The
size range of fossils in less than a meter vertically, from a large camelid limb bone to tiny
insectivore teeth and from large clam and oyster shells to foraminifera, suggests that forces
dumped animals together from land and sea,
both shallow and deep open sea, with little
sorting. The TVOR SE sandstone may represent sand and mud (and fossils) dumped on
top of patchy oyster beds when a hurricane
hit, bringing waves to rework the shallows,

The TVOR SE site includes estuarine
to shallow marine animals, probably in place
(the oysters with both valves); marine animals
coming from a deep to shallow environment
(the Miocene Globorotalia and the baleen
whale); reworked marine fossils (the Cretaceous foraminifera); transported, possibly reworked from soils, terrestrial animal materials (terrestrial mammals large and small); reworked soil components (carbonate and manganese nodules, Figure 30); and other transported terrestrial material (charcoal pieces
and coprolites). Wood chips are abundant in
the clays above the oyster-bearing sandstone
level at TVOR SE. Some wood in the sediments is silicified, but most is carbonized.
SEM pictures of the carbonized wood show
that it breaks to form crisp edges, suggesting
it may have been charcoal when transported
and buried (Collinson, pers. comm.). A wildfire on land could have denuded the surface
and exposed it to erosion, increasing the concentration in clays of small vertebrates and
materials from soils like the nodules. Coprolites have not been found elsewhere in the Fort
Polk Miocene. Dry dung would have floated
well and been carried out to sea with the charcoal. If the oysters represent a shallow ma-

both marine and terrestrial, and heavy rain
to erode soils in river terrace dryer highlands
and wet coastal lowlands, bringing fossils from
each into the sea. If wild fIre had denuded the
land, effects would be magnllied and the presence of charcoal in the TVOR clays explained.
Conclusions from the second report (Schiebout
and Ting, 2001) mentioned that catastrophes
were generally not involved in the Fort Polk
Miocene record, which was a story of fairly
slow environmental changes. At TVOR SE, a
rapid event seems to have played a major role.
The age of TVOR SE is Late Barstovian
based on fossil mammals. Whether the fauna
of TVOR SE is Cold Spring Local Fauna
equivalent or equivalent to the older
Burkeville Local Fauna, one which has also
yielded both mammals and marine invertebrates, can not be determined. The similarity
of a TVOR SE mandible fragment with one
premolar to the DISC prosynthetocerine suggests that TVOR SE is Cold Spring equivalent. The presence of a merychippine horse
comparable to Merychippus goorisi is also suggestive. Finding more age diagnostic mammals is a goal for the future.
Other sites, particularly DISC, have continued to be productive. The two tortoises from
DISC are the best preserved and complete fossils of individuals yet recovered from the Fort
Polk Miocene. Questions remain that have not
been clarllied by continuing work, most notably the disparity of ages produced by vertebrate paleontology and magnetostratigraphy
on one hand (older) and paleopalynology and
study offoraminifera (younger) on the other.
More taphonomic and paleoecologic work may
help clarify this, especially at TVOR SE which
contains a physically mixed fauna from a variety of environments, and possibly, from a
greater range of ages than the other sites.

Work at all currently known productive
sites should continue. This report represents
an intermediate stage in ongoing work which
is continuing to yield results for publication
in the scientific literature.
As noted in Schiebout and Ting (2001),
the possibility of new sites is good wherever
the top 20 m of the Castor Creek Member is
exposed, either by erosion or human
activities. Field work should concentrate on
this interval, although nodule or oyster
concentrations that are found in the future
anywhere in the Fleming Formation might
yield concentrations of vertebrate fossils. Any
extensive Miocene exposures should be
checked, even if no conglomerates are present,
because of the possibility of an isolated animal
in overbank mudstone, like the Shamrock
rhino or cetacean vertebrae recently
recovered from upsection in the TVOR SE
gully (Grafton, pers. comm.). The new barrow
pit (James Grafton, pers. comm.) being
developed east of the current sites should be
monitored.
The discrepancy between paleomagnetic
and vertebrate biostratigraphic dating results
on one hand and dates based on foraminifera
and pollen on the other should be resolved
through further study. More study of the Fort
Polk Miocene soils would be desireable.
Additional comparison of Fort Polk Miocene
fossils with specimens at other museums
should take place, for example, at the Florida
State Museum in Gainesville, which houses
eastern Gulf Coastal Miocene faunas, and the
Nebraska State Museum in Lincoln which
houses extensive Miocene high plains faunas.

TVOR Site Cluster
As noted in Schiebout and Ting (2001),
original TVOR and exposures north and
northwest of the well site should be
periodically examined for additional
conglomerate. Extensive bulldozing and
churning of the surface has taken place, and

32

future rains may clean off conglomerate now
concealed by mud.
TVOR SE Both surface search, quarrying, and
screening should continue. The area high in
the gully from which cetacean material
continues to weather should be quarried at
the next dry weather. The type of soil log
shown in Figure 29 should be done all along
the TVOR SE gully.
TVOR S should be examined by surface
prospecting and the strongly cemented rock
which appears similar to the oyster sandstone
at TVOR SE should undergo more study and
quarrying.

DISC Site Cluster
Stonehenge Rock remains at the DISC
landfarm, available for further processing.
Stonehenge remains one of our most productive sites. It is the site processed by screening
from which the most complete specimens of
tiny animals are recovered. Continued processing of the Stonehenge rock and study of
resulting fossils is recommended.
Gully Periodic examination for exposure of
new promising conglomerate should be done.
DISC Surface search of any areas still open
should continue. The location of the two excellently preserved tortoises (Figure 34)
should be examined for any taphonomic information which can be extracted. The type
of soil log shown in Figure 29 should be done
at DISC.

Outreach
A main focus of outreach efforts
should remain the Fort Polk Environmental
Learning Center. The nontechnical booklet for
youngsters (Schiebout and Dooley, 2001), the
posters prepared for professional meetings
which are then brought to the center, and the
hands-on fossil dig, which uses casts and
picked screening residue from the project to
simulate fossil hunting, are available there.
The booklet for youngsters should be revised

to incorporate information on recent research.
As more whale material becomes available, a
segment needs to be added to the brochure on
Fort Polk Miocene cetaceans. LSUMG 12233
is a horse metapodial distal end which shows
an articulation for an accessory toe. It could
be figured as part of a discussion of three-toed
Miocene horses. LSU undergraduate and
graduate classes have been brought on field
trips to the Fort Polk Miocene, and portions
ofthe research have been carried out by graduate students as part oftheir training, and this
should continue.
The LSU Museum of Natural Science is
now the main component of the Louisiana
State Museum of Natural History, and it is
hoped that increased outreach on museum
research will become possible in the future.
As the Fort Polk Miocene fauna grows, spectacular animals like the giant camel and the
rhino are added, and the ecological picture
comes into sharper focus, to be fit into earth
history on the global scale. The opportunities
to interest and educate the public can be expected to expand in the future.
Videoclips have been proposed as a new
form of deliverable for future Fort Polk Miocene research. These could be used by the
Fort Polk Environmental Learning Center in
developing interactive displays, videos, and
websites. They would not be completed video
shows, but rather short segments showing
specimens, with a researcher pointing out features and talking about the specimen where
appropriate. At least one clip should be produced per vertebate animal family. Videoclips
of sites and field work should also be produced.

This research is part of an ongoing
project, and some materials from screening
and surface search are not identified or
curated. If further research and more recent
finds allow their identification, they will be
numbered and curated to the Museum of
Natural Science, and if not, they will be preserved in curated lots in the Museum for further research.
