Indian Grinding Stones or Metates
in East Texas
E. W. HAYNER
IN ATTEMPTING to deal with the Indian metate in East Texas, we have
a real problem on our hands. It is difficult to assign this artifact to any
particular stage or culture, or to determine what was ground on it-whether corn or something else.
The American Indian must have been the world’s busiest grinder,
because so many of the things he used in his daily life had to be
ground, and he had to do the grinding himself. This daily grinding of
so many" different things is the reason that we find so many pitted and
milling stones of different sizes.
In East Texas, pitted stones are plentiful. Every camp site or village
area has some of them, and at some sites they are very numerous.
Most of the manos that are found here have pits in them. Some have
one pit, and others are pitted on both faces.
However, it is not the purpose of this article to deal with the small
pitted stone, or "nut stone," which occurs in all foci in East Texas, but
rather to try to shed a small amount of light on the large grinding
stone, or metate. This large type of grinder is not common in East
Texas, and in the last few decades, when much of the farm land has
been turned into pasture, the large grinding stones are not as easy to
find as the), once were.
I have worked on a large number of sites in this area, sites belonging to all three aspects--Archaic, Gibson, and Fulton--and have
visited other sites which were being worked by other people. The
metate is nearly always conspicuous by its absence. In fact, the metate
is one artifact which is extremely hard to find.
The Indian grinding stones that are found here are made from different kinds of stone, some of them native to the area and others imported. All the grinders can be classed in one or the other two types,
the small pitted or nut stone, and the metate with a large concavity.
Many of the artifacts have pits or concavities on both faces.

A peculiar thing about the large grinders is that the concavities on
some of them are rough, whereas on others the concavity is smooth,
polished by use. Almost all of the small pitted stones have polished
pits.
Many of the large grinders have a small pit in the center of the large
concavity. Sometimes this combination occurs on both faces of the artifact. This combination of pits seems to indicate that the artifacts were
used to grind some substance which could not be handled in one size
of the pit alone.
It is not the purpose of this article to try to assess the uses and values
of the various grinders. Rather, the writer wishes to correct some of the
statements in the literature which, on the basis of his experience in
finding a number of metates in place in prehistoric campsites, he feels
to be in error.
Most of the people who write about the metate assign it to an agricultural culture. They do not seem to think that the Indian in the
Archaic Stage could have had a use for the large grinding stone. However, four of the metates in my collection have come from Archaic
sites. I am certain of this fact, because I found them myself. In addition, I found another specimen which I replaced in its bed at the
site and covered it over again with soil.
This discussion is based specifically on a group of twelve metates,
of which five are from sites which by current standards are judged
to belong to the Archaic Stage. The other seven are from surface ]ocations in different East Texas counties. In this group of twelve specimens. four are made from stones resembling rocks from glacial till.
These four specimens are of a quartz-like or granitic material. Two
other specimens are made from a compact hard claystone material,
another is from hematite, and the remaining five are made of local
ferruginous sandstone. In dimensions these specimens vary from 8 x
6 x 3 in. to 14 x 12 x 6 in. The concavities vary from 5 x 3 in. to 8 x 6
in., and are from 1 to 3 in. deep.
Brief descriptions of these twelve specimens, with their places of
discovery, are given below. The numbers correspond to those in Fig. 1.

"Glacier-formed" stones, quartz-like and granitic material
#1. From Morris County; a surface find, site unknown. On each
face of the stone is a large concavity which covers almost the entire
surface. Within each concavity is a small pit.
#2. From Cass County; a surface find, site unknown. On each face
of the stone is a large concavity, and in each concavity is a small pit.

#3. From Morris County; a surface find, site unknown. This stone
has a large concavity on one face only.
#4. From Harrison County; from a proven Archaic Stage site. This
stone has a large concavity on each face, and each concavity extends
over the edge of the stone at the thinnest side.
Claystone material, source unknown
#5. From Gregg County; from a proven Archaic site. This stone
has a large concavity on one face and a small pit on the opposite face.
#6. From Morris County; from a proven Archaic site. This stone
has a large concavity on one face. The opposite face has no concavity
or pit.
Ferruginous sandstone, source native
#7. From Harrison County, on the Hayner old plantation; a surface find, site unknown. This stone has a large concavity on one face,
The opposite face is rough.
#8. From Morris County; a surface find, site unknown. This stone
has a large concavity on each face.
#9. From Morris County; a surface find, site unknown. This stone
has a large concavity on one face, with a small pit in the center of the
concavity. The opposite face is rough.
# 10. From Morris County; a surface find, site unknown. This stone
has a large concavity on each face, with the concavities extending over
the thin side of the stone.
# 11. (not illustrated). From Gregg County, from an Archaic site.
This stone is of hematite in a bad state of decomposition, and has a
large concavity on one side. As is the case with most hematite tools, it
is polished all over the surface. It is about average in size for a metate.
After it was found, this specimen was replaced in the spot where it
was discovered and covered over again with earth. This procedure
was followed so as to be able to prove, without any question, that there
were grinders of this type in the Archaic Stage. There is a witness to
the find and the replacement.
#12 (not illustrated). From Gregg County; from the same Archaic
site as #5. This stone has a depression on one face which seems to
have been started as a large concavity but was finished to make a
smaller pit, which is nevertheless much larger than the pit of the average nut-stone.

Summary and Conclusions
As stated at the beginning of this article, when we try to deal with
the Indian milling stone in East Texas, we have on our hands a problem which is as yet unsolved. The stones themselves are large enough
so that it is unlikely they were buried accidentally. The writer has
observed that most Indian campsites seem to have been cleaned by the
process of spreading new or clean sand over the area. In this process
the large grinder would not be covered as many smaller objects would
have been. Also, being a large stone, and in most cases being near the
surface, it is one of the first objects to be disturbed by the plow. Furthermore, if left on the surface by the Indians where last used, these
stones are slow to become covered with organic matter through natural
processes. Therefore, when found buried, it seems likely that they
were buried intentionally.
In this paper twelve large grinders have been described; call them
metates, milling stones, or whatever you wish--they are, in any case,
Indian grinding stones. Of the twelve, five are from Archaic sites. I
found them myself, and am certain of this fact. There is no way of
knowing how many of the others are of Archaic origin.
This article has been prepared for the express purpose of proving
that agriculture is not always implied by the presence of the metate.
We assume that the Archaic Indians did not have corn; but they did
have the metate. On the other hand, because of the fact that the later
pottery-making Indians did have corn, most writers feel that the
Archaic Indians did not have any agriculture.
The Indian grinding stone in East Texas, and in other areas of the
state as well, has not had the attention which it deserves. Because of
the Indians’ methods of gathering and preparing food, the grinder had
to be one of his most important tools, if not the most important. Perhaps someone will eventually have the time that is needed to give this
important phase of Indian economy the attention that it deserves.
