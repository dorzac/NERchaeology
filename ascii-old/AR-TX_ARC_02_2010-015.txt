ABSTRACT
The City of Fort Worth intends to install approximately 11 miles of the
Fort Worth Reclaimed Waterline from the Village Creek Water Treatment
Plant to the DFW International Airport boundary near SH 183. The
majority of the waterline route falls within existing utility easements or
under roadways. One section of the proposed waterline will travel under
Calloway Cemetery Road; the centerline for the route is approximately 20’
from the recorded Calloway Cemetery boundary. The preferred method of
pipeline installation is via open cut within this section of the route. Since
the cemetery boundary is less than 100’ from the waterline route, the
Texas Historical Commission requested testing within the waterline rightof-way to determine if there were unmarked burials present. Alan
Plummer Associates, Inc. contracted AR Consultants, Inc. to conduct the
testing. The pipes along Calloway Cemetery Road will be 24” in diameter
and will be buried between 6’ and 7.5’ deep within the 50’ permanent and
construction easements. At the conclusion of trenching, it was apparent
that no graves or grave shafts were in any of the eleven trenches excavated
in the proposed waterline route. These negative results, combined with the
recent discussions with Bill Golden of the Calloway Cemetery Association
suggest that burials were not placed north of the cemetery fenceline but
were within the fenced cemetery boundaries. Calloway Cemetery Road
has been an active thoroughfare since the beginning of the 20th century,
and the roadbed itself is 10” to 12” below the ground surface of the
cemetery with a gravel bed ranging from 16 to 60 cm thick. Based on the
negative results of this study, AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that
further cultural resource investigations are unnecessary. If unmarked
graves should be uncovered during installation of the waterline, work
should cease immediately in the area and the Texas Historical
Commission should be consulted.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Fort Worth intends to install approximately 11 miles of the Fort Worth
Reclaimed Waterline from the Village Creek Water Treatment Plant to the DFW
International Airport boundary near SH 183. The majority of the waterline route falls
within existing utility easements or under roadways. This route was investigated by AR
Consultants, Inc. (ARC) under TAC permit 5351 and the results of this study were
included in the report Archaeological Survey of the Proposed City of Fort Worth
Reclaimed Waterline Route (Shelton 2009). In the recommendations, ARC noted that one
section of the proposed waterline will travel under Calloway Cemetery Road, and the
centerline for the route is approximately 20’ from the recorded Calloway Cemetery
boundary. The preferred method of pipeline installation is via open cut within this section
of the route. Since the cemetery boundary is less than 100’ from the waterline route, the
Texas Historical Commission requested testing within the waterline right-of-way to
determine if there were unmarked burials present and approximately 600’ of the waterline
route was recommended for testing (Figure 1). The pipes along Calloway Cemetery Road
will be 24” in diameter and will be buried between 6’ and 7.5’ deep within the 50’
permanent and construction easements. The City of Fort Worth contracted Alan Plummer
Associates, Inc. (APAI) to conduct the environmental permitting and APAI has
contracted with ARC to conduct the testing along the waterline route where it fronts the
Calloway Cemetery.
The cultural resource investigation was required because the City of Fort Worth is a
political entity of the State of Texas; Texas Antiquities Permit Number 5423 was issued
for the archaeological survey. In addition, since the route for the reclaimed water pipeline
crosses the West Fork of the Trinity River’s floodplain, it falls within the jurisdiction of
the Fort Worth District of the US Army Corps of Engineers. Relevant federal legislation
includes the National Historic Preservation Policy Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515),
the National Environmental Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), the Archeological and Historical
Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93-291), the Clean Water Act, as amended
PL92500 and the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899. The Archeology Division of the Texas
Historical Commission not only will review this report as the State Agency, but also as
the Section 106 review agency.
This report is written in accordance with the guidelines adopted by the Archeology
Division of the Texas Historical Commission (THC), and developed by the Council of
Texas Archeologists (n.d.). The following report presents a brief description of the
natural setting of the project area, followed by a discussion of the culture history and
previous investigations within the study area. A chapter on the research design and
methodology employed in the investigation is then followed by the results of the field
investigation. The report concludes with recommendations followed by the references
cited.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The study area is located in the eastern half of Tarrant County, which is in the Eastern
Cross Timbers vegetative area. The underlying bedrock is the Cretaceous aged Woodbine
Formation, but the cemetery rests on overlying Fluviate Terrace sediments that are
approximately 50’ above the floodplain northwest of the West Fork of the Trinity River
(Bureau of Economic Geology 1988). The terrace deposit consists of laminated gravel,
sand, silt, and clay. Bastsil fine sandy loam is mapped at the cemetery location, with
Silawa sandy, loamy and sandy clay soil to the north, east and west (Ressel 1981: Sheet
26).
The Ap horizon in the Bastsil series is described as pale brown (10YR6/3) or brown
(10YR4/3) fine sandy loam that is 11” deep followed by yellowish red (5YR5/6) sandy
clay loam B21t horizon between 11” and 30” (Ressel 1981:85-86). The B21t horizon is
followed by the B22t horizon of red (2.5YR5/6) sandy clay loam between 30” and 56”.
The last horizon described is the Bt&A’2 horizon which is a yellowish red (5YR5/8,
5YR4/6) sandy clay loam with few light gray (10YR7/2) clay flows and pale brown
(10YR7/3) sand grains.

CULTURAL HISTORY
Tarrant County’s first Anglo settlers made their way to the prairie during the 1840’s. The
earliest Anglo settlements in Tarrant County were Bird's Fort, established around 1840,
and Lonesome Dove, settled in 1845. Lonesome Dove was the first permanent settlement
in Tarrant County (Garrett 1972:55). Settlers came through the auspices of Peters Colony
land grants with 160 families or single pioneers taking advantage of the grants (Garrett
1972:57).
Calloway Cemetery
After moving to Texas from Tennessee, Richard H. and Joseph W. Calloway received
land grants in Tarrant County in 1857 and 1862 respectively. Later, the Calloway
brothers purchased the land where the cemetery is located in the James R. Newton
Survey #1170 from the Newton heirs. The historic Calloway Cemetery was founded in
the late 19th century with the burials of two brothers, Richard (1832-1874) and Joseph
Calloway (1829-1877). Apparently, the brothers were not the first burials in the cemetery
which were of two slaves that are marked by sandstone rocks. The overview of the
cemetery history was compiled from notes of interviews with Mrs. Lloyd T. Cannon
(Jessie) (1979) and a synthesis of archival records compiled by Mrs. James A. Cushman
(1980).
After the burials of Richard and Joseph, Catherine “Kate” Calloway, Richards’s widow,
deeded 1.5 acres that included the burials of the Calloway family and neighbors for
public burials in 1886 (Tarrant County Deed Book Vol. 81, Page 521). In 1903,
Catherine Calloway sold the remainder of the 180 acre parcel to Henry F. Ferris. An

excerpt from an interview with Ferris’s daughter, Mrs. Lloyd T. Cannon, describes access
to the cemetery with the main road on the south. Shortly thereafter, the railroad was built
and a new road was opened on land donated by Mr. Ferris, presumed to be the entry road
north of the cemetery. Subsequent burials of family members and of the community
followed, and, to date, the cemetery has almost 500 internments. A wooden tabernacle,
which still stands today, was constructed in 1908 and later was restored (Figure 2).

Figure 2.

Entry to the Calloway Cemetery and the wooden tabernacle, view is to the
southwest.

The cemetery is not shown on the 1893 Sam’s Street map of Tarrant County, but
Caloway (sp) Lake is mapped south of the cemetery road. The Oklahoma, Kansas, and
Texas Railroad was constructed by 1890 and is now the Trinity Railway Express (TRE).
The rail line runs in a northeast/southwest direction immediately north of the cemetery.
The 1920 USDA Tarrant County soil map shows a cemetery south of the rail line (Figure
3). The 1959 Euless, TX’ 7.5’USGS map also shows the location of the cemetery on the
south side of Calloway Cemetery Road. Additionally, a 1974 Grapevine-EulessArlington area road map shows the location of the cemetery south of Calloway Cemetery
Road (Figure 4).

In 1956, members of the Mary Isham Keith Chapter of the Daughters of the American
Revolution surveyed the cemetery. A copy of their records can be found in the Tarrant
County Cemetery Records, Vol. VII pages 74-86. In 1977, a subsequent resurvey
conducted by Donald F. Parkins, Mrs. James A. Cushman and Miss Jane Cushman
recorded 466 burial sites with 447 legible inscriptions. A comparison of the two surveys
shows that twenty-two markers were missing between the 1956 and 1977 inventories. In
1975, the Calloway Cemetery Association was established with six trustees. In 1980, a
Texas Historical Marker #638 was placed at the site.
The Calloway Cemetery Association members estimate that at least 50 unmarked graves
are present. Cemetery records are on file at the Special Collections at The University of
Texas at Arlington Library, the Euless Public Library, the Heritage Room at Tarrant
County Junior College, and with the Tarrant County Archives.
In July 2009, Ofa “Mary” Faiva-Siale, the project coordinator for the Euless Historical
Preservation Commission was contacted to determine if a detailed map existed of the
grave locations. Faiva-Siale noted that a map was currently being drafted using the
information from the previous surveys (Personal correspondence 2009). During the
cultural resource survey, the grounds of the cemetery were walked in north south parallel
transects. Several of the headstones had been broken, some were moved or obviously
missing. The earlier burials appear concentrated on a low rise near the center of the
cemetery grounds, and the more recent burials appear to be closer to the edges of the
grounds nearer to the east and west fences. Headstones varied in style from simple
sandstone markers to ornate marble headstones. A broken concrete footstone labeled
“CLA” was noted in the chain link fence line which parallels Calloway Cemetery Road
(Figure 5).
On the first day of testing along the waterline route, Bill Golden, a member of the
Calloway Cemetery Association, was out to finish photographing the headstones as part
of a digital mapping project of the cemetery. This information will eventually be
available online on the City of Euless website for genealogical research
(http://maps.ci.euless.tx.us/freeance/Client/PublicKiosk1/index.html?appconfig=calcem).
The map will be interactive and will allow researchers to locate marked burials within the
cemetery and to see images of the headstones online (Golden, personal correspondence
2010).

Previous investigations in the area have recorded prehistoric sites in a variety of settings,
while a limited number of historic sites have been recorded near the study area. Much of
the area, specifically along Calloway Cemetery Road, has been heavily disturbed by
activities such as gravel or sand mining, industrial development, the installation of utility
lines, and road construction. In July of 2009, AR Consultants, Inc. conducted a survey of
the 11-mile route for the Fort Worth Reclaimed Waterline (Shelton 2009). During these
investigations, Calloway Cemetery was revisited. The edge of the cemetery is less than 5’
from the road easement and a chain link fence currently defines the boundaries of the
cemetery.

RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODOLOGY
The purpose of the investigation was to determine if unmarked graves had been placed
north of the boundary fence of Calloway Cemetery. Based on the results of the archival
research, it appears that Calloway Cemetery Road has been present almost as long as the
cemetery has been in place, and according to a member of the Calloway Cemetery
Association, the property has been fenced for most of the cemetery history (Bill Golden,
personal correspondence 2010).
Based on the archival evidence, the likelihood of locating burials outside of the fenceline
appeared low since the road had been present since the 1920s as seen on the Tarrant
County Soils map. Yet due to the number of known unmarked burials within the
cemetery, and the proximity of the waterline route to the cemetery fenceline of
approximately 20’, testing for unmarked burials was recommended within this section of
the proposed waterline route.
Methodology
AR Consultants, Inc. recommended a sampling strategy for testing within this section of
the route that fronts Calloway Cemetery and presented the methodology to the THC and
APAI in August of 2009. The testing proposed twenty 15’ trenches in a 600’ distance for
a 50 percent sampling strategy. Each trench was to be excavated to the proposed depth of
installation for the waterlines, which is between 6’ and 7.5’ deep in this section of the
waterline route. The trenches were to be excavated using a trackhoe to remove the asphalt
then to scrape the soil below in 10 to 20 cm layers to look for grave shafts. In addition to
excavation by mechanical methods, the sidewalls, steps and floor surface of the trench
were scraped with a trowel and skimmed with a shovel to identify any variations or
discolorations in the soil that would indicate the presence of grave shafts. Soil samples
from the trench walls, steps, and floors were screened to look for cultural material
associated with graves such as wood fragments, coffin hardware or human remains.
Field archaeologists inspected the backdirt from each trench as it was being removed.
Each trench was stepped to meet OSHA standards, and each trench was approximately
10’ wide.
If any burials were recorded in the proposed waterline route, the trenches were to be
immediately refilled and the THC and the Tarrant County Clerk’s Office were to be
notified, and that portion of the route would be bored.

INVESTIGATIVE RESULTS
Calloway Cemetery is 420’ by 238’ and abuts Calloway Cemetery Road. The cemetery is
enclosed by chain-link and wooden fences on all boundaries. From west to east, the
elevation rises from 495’ asl to 498’ asl, then continues to gently rise to 504’ asl at the
eastern end of the cemetery (Appendix A). Calloway Cemetery Road is a two lane
asphalt road with narrow easements that receives heavy traffic from the gas, gravel, and
other distribution businesses that line the north and south sides of the road.
An 8” Magellan Gas pipeline intersects the road from north to south at a 45 degree angle
north of the western corner of the cemetery. Approximately 100’ west of the cemetery
boundary is the TRE rail line which will be bored under (Figure 6). In addition, there is
an AT&T telephone line installed approximately 6’ north of and parallel to the cemetery
fenceline in the road easement. The telephone line and pipeline routes were flagged at the
time of the testing and avoided.

Figure 6.

West end of route before testing began, note the orange paint marks the
waterline centerline and the yellow line and arrow mark the Magellan Gas
Pipeline.

The trench locations were centered on the centerline of the route which had been marked
on the pavement. Installation of the waterline will not require more than a 4’ opening, but
due to the depth of the trenches and the necessity to step them, the exploratory trenches
were opened approximately 10’ wide.

Due to the location of the Magellan Gas Pipeline, the AT&T telephone line, and the
proximity to the TRE rail line to the northwest, trenches could not be excavated beyond
the western corner of the cemetery. A commercial business entrance and driveway is
immediately adjacent to the east of the cemetery fenceline, and the entrance could not be
trenched or blocked during the investigations. The original proposal had anticipated up to
twenty 15’ trenches in a 600’ distance for a 50 percent sampling strategy. A total of
eleven trenches between 15’ and 24’ long were excavated within a 375’ corridor where
trenching was permitted. The total length of excavated trenches equaled 179’ (Figure 7).
In trench T9 and T10, the asphalt had been stripped before the archaeologists had arrived
the morning of 24 March 2010. In addition, the trackhoe operator had spaced them farther
apart than the intended 15’. The trenches were opened up to 20’ and 24’ respectively to
maximize the testing along the front of the cemetery.

Trenches were generally excavated from west to east (T1-T11), with no more than two
trenches open at any given time. Trench 4, on the westernmost end, was opened the
second day, as a representative for the Magellan Gas needed to be present during the
trenching. For each trench, the excavation was as follows: The overlying asphalt and
gravel bed were removed by the trackhoe operator, then the walls of the trench were
troweled and the floor was shovel scraped to expose a smooth soil surface. The trenches
were then excavated in 10-20 cm levels (or lifts). After each level was removed, the
sidewalls and the steps were troweled and shovel scraped (Figure 8). The cleaned walls,
steps and trench floors were examined for grave shafts, caskets, and any variation in the
matrix. Soils were screened at each level from the sidewalls, steps, and trench floor to
look for casket hardware, wood fragments, or human remains (Figure 9). The south wall
of each trench was profiled.

Figure 8. Cleaning walls and floors of Trench 2, view is facing east.
Although mapped as Batsil fine sandy loam (Ressel 1981: Sheet 26) the soil
characteristics identified in the majority of the trenches were similar to Silawa sandy,
loamy and sandy clay soils which was mapped by the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) to
the north and south of the study area, and the route most likely crosses trhough a
transition between the two soil types. The A horizon in the Silawa series is described as
dark yellowish brown (10YR4/4) or dark brown (10YR3/3) fine sandy loam (Ressel

1981:106) that is 6” in depth followed by the B21t horizon of red (2.5YR5/6 or
2.5YR4/6) sandy clay loam between 6”-21”. The B22t horizon of yellowish red (5YR5/6)
sandy clay loam is between 21”-46”, followed by reddish yellow (7.5YR6/6) fine sandy
loam in the B3 horizon between 46”-60”.

Figure 9. Screening dirt from T9, view is facing west southwest.
The following trench descriptions are presented from west to east and are grouped
according to similarities identified in the stratigraphy (Figure 10). Trenches T4, T1, and
T2 were at the western end of the cemetery, 5’-10’ lower in elevation than the trenches
upslope to the east. The road surface at T1 was 10” below the ground surface of the
cemetery. The road bed gravel ranged in depth between 16 and 40 cmbs, with a white
caliche layer followed by a smaller gravel layer present in T2, but absent in T4 and T1.
T2 was further upslope than T4 and T1. The gravel road fill was followed by an A
horizon (A1) of brown (7.5YR4/4) and (A2) yellowish red (5YR4/6) loose, fine sandy
loam which extended up to 53 cm below the surface. Most likely due to the road
construction, the A1 horizon was absent in Trenches 1 and 2, but present as a thin 10 cm
layer in T4. The A horizon was given two horizon designations, A1 and A2, as there was
a distinction in the color, yet the matrix was the same.

The boundary between the A2 and B21t horizons was smooth yet abrupt where the clay
content increased in the soil. The B horizon was yellowish red (5YR4/6) or red
(2.5YR4/8) sandy clay loam that was moist with weak structure, this soil is also
consistent with that described for the Silawa series. The boundary between the B21t and
B22t horizons was gradual and smooth to the sandy clay B22t horizon with the same
colors recorded in B21t. The Bt horizon is differentiated from the B22t and the B3
horizon due to the increased clay content. The red (5YR4/6) sandy clay was more
compact and mottled with 30 percent subangular dark red (2.5YR3/6) and light brown
(7.5YR6/4) sandy clay inclusions. The B22t and Bt horizons have inclusions of light
brown sand that appears to have settled in these horizons during shrink-swell events, and
are evidenced by vertical exposures of fine sand in the sandy clay (Figure 11).

Trench 1, south wall, second step in the B21t and B22t horizons.

At the bottom of T1, the sand content increased slightly in the mottled Bt horizon. A
burned root was encountered at 53cm in the northwest corner of the trench, as several
smaller roots were in the top of the B21t horizon in T2.
Continuing upslope to the east trenches T3 through T6 were excavated. The gravel bed
underlying the asphalt varied in thickness from 35, 23, and 37 cmbs respectively. The
brown (7.5YR4/4) A1 horizon of loose, fine sandy loam was present in all four trenches,
followed by the yellowish red (5YR4/6) A2 horizon in T3 and T5. The B21t horizon
began between 48-62 cmbs respectively, and the boundaries were smooth and abrupt
between the A2 and B21t horizon (Figure 12). The B22t horizon extended to the bottom
of the trenches, except for in T5 where the Bt horizon was encountered and the clays
became more compact.

In T3, between the A1 and A2 horizons (37 to 40 cmbs), a dark, discontinuous stain,
which appeared to be rodent burrows, was encountered in the south side of the trench
(Figure 13). The entire south side of the trench floor was troweled, and the soils were
screened. No distinct boundaries were identified, and the stain shifted in size and shape as
the trench floor was scraped. The discoloration of the soil abruptly ended with the
transition into the B21t horizon. No cultural material was recorded, and it appeared that
the discoloration of the soil was due to the burrowing activities and not related to a grave
shaft.

Rodent burrows in the A1 horizon of T3.

The final trenches were T7 through T11. Beginning in T7, the gravel bed became thicker,
and the A horizon, beginning at 38 cmbs, varied slightly from the trenches to the west
and was subdivided as A1, A2, and A3 based on color variations within the fine sandy
loam. The A1 horizon (38-48 cmbs) was followed by dark yellowish brown (10YR4/6)
fine sandy loam to a depth of 53 cmbs, with a wavy, gradual boundary between the two
horizons. A thin layer, approximately 5 cm, of yellowish brown (10YR5/6) fine sand,
also wavy, overlaid the red (5YR4/6) sandy clay B21t horizon which began at 62 cmbs.
The B22t horizon extended to the bottom of the trench, and no mottling was observed.
The variation in the A horizon was attributed to road construction and mixing of the
topsoil.
The gravel road bed was much thinner in T8, it ended at 21 cmbs, and was followed by a
thin layer of yellowish brown sand as in T7, then the brown (7.5YR4/4) fine sandy loam
A1 horizon that contained a lens of charcoal flecks until about 50 cmbs (Figure 14). At
54 cmbs, the weak, sandy clay loam of the B21t horizon was encountered and the
boundary between A1 and B21t was smooth and abrupt. The charcoal flecked soil ranged
between 10 and 15 cm in thickness throughout the trench. The trench walls were troweled
and the soils screened, but no cultural material was encountered. The B22t horizon was
encountered at 146 cmbs, and extended to the bottom of the trench.

Charcoal lens in A1 horizon, T8 north wall.

Continuing to the east in T9, the gravel bed was much thicker and extended to 60 cmbs.
The A1 horizon was shallow (5 cm thick) and was followed by the sandy clay loam in the
B21t horizon. The B22t horizon was followed by a B3 horizon that was red (2.5YR4/8)
like the B3 horizon, but had a higher sand content. These boundaries were diffuse, and
indistinct.
In T10, the charcoal lens reappeared in the A1 horizon as diffuse and uneven. The bottom
of the charcoal lens disappeared at the smooth, abrupt boundary of the sandy clay loam
B21t horizon. Once again, the charcoal stained soils were screened from the floor and
side walls of the trenches, yet not cultural material was recovered. The charcoal were
small flecks, approximately 1 to 2 mm in diameter. The B21t horizon was followed by
the B22t and B3 horizons, with the boundaries being diffuse and smooth between each
horizon.
In the final trench, T11, the gravel bed ended at 34 cmbs, followed by the sandy loam A1
horizon interspersed with occasional rodent burrows. The sandy clay loam B21t horizon
began at 43 cmbs and continued to 64 cmbs, followed by the sandy clay B22t horizon. As
in the previous two trenches (T9 and T10) the boundaries between the various B horizons
were smooth and gradual, with a slight increase of sand in the B3 horizon at the bottom
of the trench.
At the conclusion of trenching, it was apparent that no graves or grave shafts were in any
of the eleven trenches excavated in the proposed waterline route (Figure 15). These
negative results, combined with the recent discussions with Bill Golden at the Calloway

Cemetery Association, suggest that burials were not placed north of the cemetery
fenceline, but were within the fenced cemetery boundaries. Calloway Cemetery Road has
been an active thoroughfare since the beginning of the 20th century, and the roadbed
itself is 10” to 12” below the ground surface of the cemetery with a gravel bed ranging
from 16 to 60 cm thick. The lowered surface may be due to the intentional leveling of the
road.

The charcoal lens exposed in the A horizon of trenches T8-T10 (although severely
truncated in T9 due to the gravel fill) appears to have been associated with a historic burn
event, but could not be identified as an occupation surface. No artifacts were uncovered
during the testing, nor during the screening of the charcoal flecked soil. Overall, the A
horizon appeared to be relatively sterile of organic material as well, as few roots were
identified, and no grubs or other insects were present. The only evidence of animal
activity was that of the rodent burrows, yet the overall absence of organic materials
suggest that the A horizon has been buried for some time.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the negative results of this study, AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that further
cultural resource investigations are unnecessary. If unmarked graves are uncovered
during installation of the waterline, work should cease immediately in the area and the
Texas Historical Commission should be consulted.
