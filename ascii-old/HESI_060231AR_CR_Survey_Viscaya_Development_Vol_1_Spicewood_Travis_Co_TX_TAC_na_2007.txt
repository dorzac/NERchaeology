MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

During March 2007, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted an
intensive cultural resources survey of the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) jurisdictional
areas within the proposed 1060-acre Vizcaya development near Spicewood, Travis County,
Texas. Although the development is privately funded and located on private property, the
development of the property within the USACE jurisdictional areas will require a Section 404
permit issued by the USACE. As such, the development within these jurisdictional areas falls
under the regulations of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966,
as amended. Horizon conducted the survey at the request of the Lake Travis Ranch, LLC in
compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA. The purpose of the investigations was to determine
if any archeological sites were located within the USACE jurisdictional areas and, if any existed,
to determine their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). In
all, the USACE jurisdictional areas on the property total 229 acres of the overall 1060 acres.
The survey resulted in the documentation of 3 new prehistoric archeological sites
(41TV2263, 41TV2264, and 41TV2265). All 3 of these sites are prehistoric open campsites,
each exhibiting various degrees of utilization. Site 41TV2263 is a moderate-sized campsite with
3 visible burned rock middens present. The presence of several manos and metate fragments
suggests that plant processing was a prominent activity at this site. No temporally diagnostic
materials were observed on the site. Based on the presence of the 3 burned rock middens and
the potential for buried deposits within these features, the possibility exists that site 41TV2263
could contain significant cultural deposits. However, additional testing investigations are
necessary to determine this. As such, it is Horizon’s opinion that the NRHP eligibility status of
site 41TV2263 is currently undetermined. Horizon recommends NRHP eligibility testing
investigations on this site to formally determine its NRHP eligibility status.
Site 41TV2264 is a small short-term aboriginal encampment on a rock ledge lacking
buried deposits. The site consists of a scatter of burned rock that appears to be an eroded
hearth, an un-typed arrow point, and a scatter of lithic debitage. The artifacts suggest that this
was a small encampment utilized as possibly a hunting camp during the Late Prehistoric period.
Because the site appears to have been completely destroyed by sheet erosion and high creek
flows, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41TV2264 is not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and that
no further work at this site is warranted. Horizon recommends that cultural resources clearance
be granted for this location.

Management Summary

Finally, site 41TV2265 is an extensive aboriginal campsite located on what currently is a
peninsula that extends into Lake Travis. Low lake levels at the time of the survey allowed for
the documentation of portions of the site that have been submerged by the lake for roughly the
past 70 years. The site consists entirely of upland locations entirely lacking in alluvial deposits.
As such, cultural debris was scattered on the surface over a large area. Observed cultural
materials include countless burned rocks, dense areas of chert debitage, manos, metate
fragments, early stage bifaces, an Edwards arrow point, a Darl dart point, a Travis dart point,
and a possible lanceolate projectile point. These specimens suggest that the site was occupied
potentially as early as the Paleo-Indian period up through the Late Prehistoric period. In
addition to the observed surface materials, at least 5 burned rock middens were observed at
various locations on this large site. While all 5 middens appeared to be composed of dense
amounts of burned rock situated on shallow soils or limestone bedrock, a probe or “pokey rod”
pressed into the midden closest to the lake extended to a depth of 1.5 meters below surface,
suggesting some sort of pit or karst feature beneath the midden deposits. Based on the dense
amounts of cultural materials on this site as well as the 5 observed middens, the potential exists
that site 41TV2265 could contain significant cultural deposits. However, additional testing
investigations are necessary to determine this. As such, it is Horizon’s opinion that the NRHP
eligibility status of site 41TV2265 is currently undetermined. Horizon recommends NRHP
eligibility testing investigations on this site to formally determine its NRHP eligibility status.
Aside from these 3 sites, no other sites were documented within the remaining USACE
jurisdictional areas in the Project Area. As such, it is Horizon’s opinion that development within
the USACE jurisdictional areas beyond the boundaries of sites 41TV2263 and 41TV2265 will
have no impact on significant cultural resources. Horizon therefore recommends that cultural
resources clearance be granted for all of the USACE jurisdictional areas within the 1060-acre
property with the exception of the locations of sites 41TV2263 and 41TV2265. As stated above,
NRHP eligibility testing is recommended for these 2 sites to formally determine the NRHP
eligibility status of each.

Volume 1: Survey Level Investigations within the Proposed 1060-Acre Vizcaya Development

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of an intensive cultural resources survey of the US
Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) jurisdictional areas within the proposed 1060-acre Vizcaya
development (Project Area) near Spicewood, Travis County, Texas (Figures 1 through 3). The
development will consist of a luxury residential golf-course community in the Hill Country with up
to 500 custom homes, hiking trails, a marina, and an 18-hole Reese Jones-designed golf
course. Although the development is privately funded and located on private property, the
development of the property within the USACE jurisdictional areas will require a Section 404
permit issued by the USACE. As such, the development within these jurisdictional areas falls
under the regulations of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966,
as amended. Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted the survey at the
request of the Lake Travis Ranch, LLC in compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA. The
purpose of the investigations was to determine if any archeological sites were located within the
USACE jurisdictional areas and, if any existed, to determine their eligibility for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). In all, the USACE jurisdictional areas on the
property total 229 acres of the overall 1060 acres.
The cultural resources investigations consisted of an archival review, a general
reconnaissance assessment of the property, a subsequent intensive pedestrian survey of the
property, and the production of a report suitable for review by the State Historic Preservation
Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice
and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council of Texas Archeologists’ (CTA)
Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports. Russell Brownlow (Horizon’s cultural
resources director) served as the project’s Principal Investigator. Reign Clark (Horizon project
archeologist) supervised the field crew consisting of Ron Ralph, Jared Wiersema, Michael
Mudd, Abigail Weinstein, and Diamond Kapanday.
Horizon conducted the survey of the USACE jurisdictional areas on the 11th and 12th of
March 2007. This entailed intensive surface inspection and shovel testing. Due to the fact that
the majority of the soils encountered during the survey consisted of compact, rocky clay or
exposed limestone bedrock with no potential to contain buried, intact cultural deposits, shovel
tests of significant depth were predominantly unsuccessful. The Texas State Minimum
Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 1 shovel test per 3 acres for

projects measuring over 200 acres in size. In the case of the USACE jurisdictional areas on the
property, a total of 76 shovel tests were necessary to meet the minimum standards. Horizon
exceeded the minimum survey standards by excavating a total of 163 shovel tests within the
USACE jurisdictional areas.
The survey resulted in the documentation of 3 new prehistoric archeological sites
(41TV2263, 41TV2264, and 41TV2265). Site 41TV2263 is an aboriginal open campsite that
somewhat straddles a drainage above the Colorado River. Visible cultural features on the site
include 3 burned rock middens aligned in a relative triangle. The larger of the 3 middens
consists of a mound of burned rocks measuring approximately 20.0 meters (m) in diameter and
1.1 m high, while the 2 other middens appear to be dense concentrations of burned rock on
sloping surfaces. Artifact frequencies on this site appear to be densest in the area contained
within the triangle formed by the 3 middens. Observed artifacts include several sandstone
mano and metate fragments, cores, and chert flakes. No temporally diagnostic artifacts were
encountered. Shovel tests within the area of observed artifact density indicated buried deposits
up to 30 centimeters (cm) in thickness. Areas of the site beyond the middens consist of
exposed limestone bedrock and shallow rocky soils with no apparent potential to contain buried
deposits. Based on the presence of the 3 burned rock middens and the potential buried for
deposits within these features, the possibility exists that site 41TV2263 could contain significant
cultural deposits. However, additional testing investigations are necessary to determine this.
As such, it is Horizon’s opinion that the NRHP eligibility status of site 41TV2263 is currently
undetermined. Horizon recommends NRHP eligibility testing investigations on this site to
formally determine its NRHP eligibility status.
The second site, 41TV2264, consists of a small, aboriginal open campsite situated on a
bedrock ledge above a waterfall on an intermittent drainage. Observed cultural materials
include an eroded hearth, several chert flakes, and an unclassified arrow point. Limestone
bedrock is prevalent across the site, and shovel tests placed in areas of soil revealed only
shallow soils overlying bedrock. Based on the observed arrow point, the site appears to be a
temporary camp utilized during the Late Prehistoric period. It appears to have been completely
destroyed by sheet erosion and high creek flows. Because of this, it is Horizon’s opinion that
site 41TV2264 is not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and that no further work at this site is
warranted. Horizon recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted for this location.
Finally, the third site, 41TV2265, was recorded as an extensive aboriginal campsite
located on what currently is a peninsula that extends into Lake Travis. Low lake levels at the
time of the survey allowed for the documentation of portions of the site that have been
submerged by the lake for roughly the past 70 years. The site consists entirely of upland
locations entirely lacking in alluvial deposits. As such, cultural debris was scattered on the
surface over a large area. Observed cultural materials include countless burned rock, dense
areas of chert debitage, manos, metate fragments, early stage bifaces, an Edwards arrow point,
a Darl dart point, a Travis dart point, and a possible lanceolate projectile point. These
specimens suggest that the site was occupied potentially as early as the Paleo-Indian period up
through the Late Prehistoric period. In addition to the observed surface materials, at least 5
burned rock middens were observed at various locations on this large site. Three of the

middens are located in an upland area along the ridge of the peninsula, while 2 are located on a
finger of the peninsula that has been submerged by the lake. While all 5 middens appeared to
be composed of dense amounts of burned rock situated on shallow soils or limestone bedrock,
a probe or “pokey rod” pressed into the midden closest to the lake extended to a depth of 1.5 m
below surface, suggesting some sort of pit or karst feature beneath the midden deposits. Based
on the dense amounts of cultural materials on this site as well as the 5 observed middens, the
potential exists that site 41TV2265 could contain significant cultural deposits. However,
additional testing investigations are necessary to determine this. As such, it is Horizon’s opinion
that the NRHP eligibility status of site 41TV2265 is currently undetermined. Horizon
recommends NRHP eligibility testing investigations on this site to formally determine its NRHP
eligibility status.
Aside from these 3 sites, no other sites were documented within the remaining USACE
jurisdictional areas in the Project Area. As such, it is Horizon’s opinion that development within
the USACE jurisdictional areas beyond the boundaries of sites 41TV2263 and 41TV2265 will
have no impact on significant cultural resources. Horizon therefore recommends that cultural
resources clearance be granted for all of the USACE jurisdictional areas within the 1060-acre
property with the exception of the locations of sites 41TV2263 and 41TV2265. As stated above,
NRHP eligibility testing is recommended for these 2 sites for formally determine the NRHP
eligibility status of each.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The overall Project Area consists of an approximately 1060-acre tract located west of
Austin, northeast of Bee Creek Road. More specifically, the Project Area is located north of
Siesta Shores Drive and south of Thurman Bend Road in Spicewood, Travis County, Texas
(see Figures 1 and 2). It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5’ Pace Bend,
Texas, topographic quadrangle (see Figure 1). The USACE jurisdictional areas within the
Project Area, which comprise the areas assessed during the current investigations, primarily
consist of a series of 6 unnamed drainages that drain the property from west to east (see Figure
3). These drainages all ultimately empty into Lake Travis on the Colorado River. For survey
purposes, the USACE jurisdictional areas were assumed to be all areas within 60.0 m (200.0
feet) of each jurisdictional drainage and the shoreline of Lake Travis (see Figure 3). In all, the
USACE jurisdictional areas total 229 of the overall 1060 acres within the Project Area. Prior to
the construction of Mansfield Dam in the 1930s, the southeastern portion of the Project Area
was situated at the confluence of Bee Creek and the Colorado River.

2.2

CURRENT LAND USE

The overall Project Area consists of partially cleared pastureland and woodlands with
unimproved 2-track roads throughout. The Project Area is divided north/south by Siesta Shores
Drive. The western portion of the Project Area was actively being grazed by cattle at the time of
Horizon’s field investigations. The parcel of land located east of Siesta Shores Drive was
dominated by dense woodlands. A modern rural residential site is present on the property near
its southeastern boundary along Lake Travis. The residence is currently vacant, but is used for
occasional recreational purposes. On-site photographs are provided in Figures 4 through 11.

2.3

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

Topography on the Project Area is sloping in a west-to-east direction toward Lake Travis
on the Colorado River (USGS, 1986) (see Figure 1). Surface elevation ranges from
approximately 700 to 960 feet above mean sea level. Generally speaking, the Project Area
consists of upland rolling hills typical of the Texas Hill County. The Project Area is in the Lake
Travis watershed on the Colorado River, with surface water flow from west to east over most of
the site, typically by overland sheet flow and unnamed tributaries of Lake Travis (COA, 1998).

GEOLOGY AND SOILS

A review of existing literature shows that the Project Area is underlain by the Glen Rose
geologic formation and the Glen Rose Corbula bed (UT-BEG, 1981). The Corbula bed is
described as the lower part of the Glen Rose and is about 160 feet thick with abundant
steinkerns of Corbula harveyi in an interval up to 5 feet thick. The Glen Rose geologic formation
is described as relatively impermeable and as the lower confining unit of the Edwards Aquifer. It
has a maximum thickness of about 350 to 500 feet. Stair-step topography is characteristic of
the upper member of the Glen Rose Limestone. The Upper Glen Rose Limestone is described
as yellowish-tan, thinly bedded limestone and marl (Garner and Young, 1976). The upper
member of the Glen Rose Limestone is relatively more thinly bedded, more dolomitic, and less
fossiliferous than the lower member of the Glen Rose Limestone. The top of the upper member
of the Glen Rose Limestone is red-stained, lumpy, irregular, and bored, with oysters cemented
onto the surface (Rose, 1972).
Soils on the subject site consist of the following soil types (Werchan et al., 1974):

VEGETATION

The Project Area is situated within the Edwards Plateau vegetational area of Texas
(Gould, 1975). Vegetation on the Project Area is dominated by dense woodlands of Ashe
juniper (Juniperus asheii) and plateau live oak (Quercus fusiformis). Other vegetation observed
throughout the Project Area consisted of bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon), Texas grama
(Boutelouna rigidiseta), purple threeawn (Aristida purpurea), immature honey mesquite
(Prosopis glandulosa), twist leaf yucca (Yucca rupicola), flame-leaf sumac (Rhus lanceolata)
agarita (Berberis trifoliate), and willow baccharis (Baccharis negelecta).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The archeological record of Central Texas spans the known cultural-historical sequence:
Paleo-Indian, 11,200 to 8000 BP; Archaic, 8000 to 1400 BP; and Late Prehistoric, 1400 to 400
BP. A brief breakdown of this general sequence is presented below.

3.1

PALEO-INDIAN PERIOD (CA. 11,200 TO 8000 BP)

The Paleo-Indian period is believed to be the earliest cultural occupation in the Central
Texas region. This stage is characterized typologically by the occurrence of distinctive
lanceolate projectile points and highly mobile settlement and exploitation patterns. These
populations probably practiced a foraging (i.e., hunting and gathering) type of subsistence
(Prewitt 1981; Weir 1976), although the best-known sites exhibit a focus on the exploitation of
large mammals, including Mammuthus sp. and Bison antiquus. Investigations at sites such as
the Kincaid Rockshelter, Wilson-Leonard, and Gault have shown that, during the early part of
the Paleo-Indian, the Clovis stage, subsistence included large herbivores (e.g., mammoth,
bison, and horse) as well as smaller animals such as water turtles, badgers, and raccoons. A
multitude of plants are presumed to have also been an important part of the aboriginal diet.
However, during the later part of the Paleo-Indian period, the Folsom and Plainview stages,
subsistence seems to have depended more heavily on the specialized hunting of big game,
particularly bison. This presumption is based on the fact that only camps, stone-working
locations, and kill sites, mostly in or near grassland habitats, have been documented (Collins
1995:382). This change was most likely attributable to the climate, which had become warmer
and drier than the previous Clovis stage.

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 8000 TO 1400 BP)

The Archaic period, which covers 2/3 of Central Texas prehistory (Collins 1995), is
divided into 3 subperiods: Early (8000 to 5000 BP), Middle (5000 to 3000 BP), and Late (3000
to 1200 BP) (Hester 1986). The beginning of the Archaic period in Texas represents a similar
transition found world-wide at approximately the same time, the most noted indicators being the
extinction of Pleistocene megafauna and climatic changes. In Texas, there was a gradual
decrease in moisture and humidity reflecting the intensification of warming and drying trends
first noted during the Clovis-Folsom transition. An often-quoted response to these climatic
changes was a greater and more varied use of local resources; in actuality, this was already the
case in most places. Plant-processing implements such as manos and metates and earth

ovens become more evident in the archeological record, while the hunting of game continued.
Although still nomadic, people of the Archaic period restricted their travel to smaller areas than
did the Paleo-Indian groups.

3.3

EARLY ARCHAIC (8000 TO 5000 BP)

The Early Archaic, the least understood period, is distinguished by the switch from
Paleo-Indian lanceolate-shaped points to notched-and-stemmed points. Overall, the Early
Archaic patterns in Texas are fairly similar throughout the state. Hester (1989) observed that,
prior to 5000 BP, the late Holocene hunters and foragers were essentially indistinguishable in
terms of subsistence strategies across Region 3, which includes the Central Texas Plateau
Prairie, South Texas Plains, and Lower Pecos Canyon lands. After that date, regionally
distinctive projectile points emerge. Hughes (1991) also noted similarities when he wrote that
the Early Archaic typological developments on the Texas High Plains resembled developments
in Central and Southwestern Texas as well as in other bordering regions.
Although settlement patterns for the Early Archaic are little known, it is assumed that the
population density was low and organized into small bands practicing a mobile, generalized
subsistence and settlement pattern. The wide distribution of artifacts suggests that mobility was
high and territories relatively undefined. McKinney (1981), among others, has noted that the
distribution of Early Archaic sites was apparently concentrated along the Balcones Escarpment.
This phenomenon may possibly reflect the greater availability of water resources along this
feature during an arid climatic interval (Hester 1989).
Sites containing Early Archaic components are open campsites such as Loeve, WilsonLeonard, Richard Beene, Sleeper, Landslide, Granberg II, Jetta Court, and Hall’s Cave. Lithic
materials found within these components include grinding implements, hammerstones, projectile
points, a variety of unifacial and bifacial chipped stone instruments, and Clear Fork and
Guadalupe bifaces. The Clear Fork tools, although indicative primarily of the Early Archaic,
actually appeared in the Late Paleo-Indian period and, in some regions, lingered into Late
Archaic and Late Prehistoric times (Hughes 1991).

3.4

MIDDLE ARCHAIC (5000 TO 3000 BP)

The Middle Archaic is marked by an increased number of sites, which may reflect an
expanding population, the development of regionally distinct cultural patterns, and changes in
settlement, technology, social systems, and territorial boundaries (Black and McGraw 1985:38).
Hester (1986) suggests that, during this period, the inhabitants of the Balcones Escarpment
region developed specialized adaptations to the hunting and gathering of abundant regional
resources, particularly acorns and white-tailed deer.
Site types include open campsites located near streams or tributaries, lithic workshops in
upland areas, and special-activity sites such as hunting camps or food-processing stations
(Black and McGraw 1985). Large burned rock features (hearths and rock ovens) of the early
part of the Middle Archaic gave way in the later Middle Archaic to burned rock middens (Collins
1995).
These latter features have been interpreted as representing several different

14

060231_arch_survey_report

Volume 1: Survey Level Investigations within the Proposed 1060-Acre Vizcaya Development

subsistence practices. For example, Hester (1986) proposed that they represent intensive
utilization of acorns, while Johnson and Goode (1994:26) suggested that they were more
frequently being used to cook xerophytes such as sotol. This latter explanation has been
supported by a number of recent investigations where evidence of preserved camas bulbs have
been recovered within oven and midden contexts (Brownlow 2003, 2004a, 2004b; Bush 2004;
Dering 1999, 2002; Mauldin et al. 2003; Ricklis and Collins 1994). Middle Archaic projectile
points include Nolan, Travis, Langtry, and Pedernales (Black 1989), the latter of which is
considered by Hester (1986) to be diagnostic of this time period in the Balcones Escarpment
region.

3.5

LATE ARCHAIC (3000 TO 1400 BP)

The Late Archaic is represented by a continuation, and possibly intensification, of the
subsistence patterns seen in the Middle Archaic (Hester 1986; Collins 1995). The use of
burned rock midden sites continued throughout the Middle Archaic, peaking during the latter
part of this period (Collins 1995). Large cemetery sites are first noted during the Late Archaic
and may reflect the establishment of territories and subsistence schedules (Black 1989:30;
Black and McGraw 1985; Story 1985:49). Hester (1986) suggests that the development of
wide-ranging trade contacts also may have occurred around this time. Characteristic projectile
points include triangular types such as Lange, Montell, Castroville, and Marcos, along with
smaller, expanding-stem points such as Ensor, Frio, Darl, and Fairland.
Although Hester (1986) places the Late Archaic between 3000 and 1400 BP, a later
carving of the Archaic period by Johnson and Goode (1994) attempts to push back the initiation
point of the Late Archaic to around 4300 BP. This more recent division is based on what is
seen as a strong continuity between the material culture and subsistence practices of groups
utilizing the Pedernales point style and those utilizing the later Montell point style. Primarily,
Johnson and Goode (1994) point to similarities in the blade shape of these 2 styles, as well as
similar large, billet-thinned knives utilized during the times of these point styles. They also note
the continuance of Pedernales period plant baking within existing burned rock middens by later
groups utilizing Montell points. In fact, they view this continuity as evidence of a distinct culture
or “folk” on the eastern Edwards Plateau.
In addition to attempting to push back the initiation date of the Late Archaic period,
Johnson and Goode (1994) have also attempted to further divide the Late Archaic period into 2
subperiods (Late Archaic I and Late Archaic II) based on the material cultures as well as climatic
conditions. Their Late Archaic I subperiod coincides with the Dry Edwards Interval when xeric
conditions persisted between 4300 and 2600 BP. Diagnostic projectile points of this subperiod
include the Bulverde, Pedernales, Marshall, Montell, and Castroville styles. The Lange style
may also correspond to this subperiod based on the recovery of Lange specimens in
association with both Montell and Castroville specimens at 41WM815 and dated between 2800
to 2400 BP (Brownlow 2003). Johnson and Goode (1994:34) note that burned rock middens on
the Edwards Plateau during the Late Archaic I subperiod are more frequent than in any other
period. The increase in burned rock middens during this subperiod is undoubtedly a result of
the xeric climatic conditions that effectively expanded the ranges of certain geophytes such as

HJN 060231 AR

15

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

sotol and yucca: foodstuffs that require extended baking periods (in stone-lined ovens) in order
to break down their starches into edible simple sugars. The xeric conditions likely resulted in
the spread of grasslands on the plateau, which would have in turn attracted herds of buffalo.
Plentiful geophytic plants, as well as the presence of buffalo herds, may account for an increase
in human populations in the region as well (Weir 1976; Prewitt 1985).
Johnson and Goode’s (1994) Late Archaic II subperiod spans the time period between
2600 and 1400 BP. They equate this subperiod to more mesic climatic conditions that resulted
in the active aggradation of floodplains at many localities. The Marcos, Ensor, Frio, and Darl
dart point styles are viewed as indicators of this subperiod. Observing a break in the broad
blade stylistic tradition suggested for the Pedernales and Montell styles, Johnson and Goode
(1994:37) suggest that similarities in the Marcos style dart points to styles on the Southern
Plains may indicate an influx of new occupants from the Southern Plains or perhaps a borrowing
of projectile making techniques from this region. In addition to a perceived influx of new people
or technologies, Johnson and Goode (1994) also suggest some degree of social intercourse
with groups from the eastern US. This is evidenced by the recovery of materials such as whelk
shells and atlatl weights of exotic stone from burials dating to this time period. Although not
conclusive, Johnson and Goode (1994:37) suggest that these materials may indicate a
spreading of Eastern religious cult ideas into the region. While it cannot be conclusively stated
that groups on the Edwards Plateau subscribed to the beliefs and practices of the Eastern
religions, the evidence does suggest that groups on the plateau participated in extensive trading
with Eastern groups, primarily contributing large, thin corner-tanged knives made from local
Edwards chert.

3.6

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 1400 TO 400 BP)

The Late Prehistoric period is separated from the preceding Archaic by the introduction
of the bow and arrow and ceramics. Two phases are recognized within this period: the Austin
(ca. 1400 to 800 BP) and Toyah (ca. 800 to 400 BP) phases. The Austin phase is characterized
by the transition from the use of the atlatl and dart to that of the bow and arrow and arrow
points, particularly the expanding-stemmed Scallorn type. This phase is also distinguished by a
decline in population and changes in settlement practices, in which there was a shift from open
to protected (rockshelter) sites (Black 1989:32; Collins 1995:385). In spite of these changes,
most archeologists agree that Late Archaic subsistence practices and settlement patterns
appear to have continued during the Austin phase (Black 1989; Collins 1995; Prewitt 1974).
The Toyah phase is characterized by relatively rapid changes in technology, notably
pottery (both local and imported from the Caddo area); large, thin bifaces; Perdiz (contractingstem) arrow points; and prismatic blades (Black 1989; Collins 1995). Limited horticulture may
also have begun during this time. The Toyah tool kit was associated with the hunting of bison,
deer, and antelope, and, although nearly all sites dating to this phase have yielded bison bones,
deer was the most significant faunal resource during this time (Black 1989:32). Evidence for
agriculture is seen in the occasional corn cob found at sites such as the Timmeron Rockshelter
in Hays County. Of course, the corn could also be attributed to the same trade network that
was bringing in the Caddoan pottery.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH AND INITIAL RECONNAISSANCE

4.1

PRELIMINARY ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Preliminary archival research conducted on the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
Database web site indicated the presence of 7 archeological sites recorded within a 2.0kilometer (km) perimeter of the Project Area (THC, 2006). These sites included 4 prehistoric
burned rock middens (41TV22, 41TV23, 41TV168, and 41TV241), 2 prehistoric lithic scatters
(41TV1107 and 41TV1113), and 1 prehistoric lithic procurement area (41TV193).
According to the current Atlas plotting, site 41TV22 was recorded within the boundaries
of the Project Area near its extreme southeastern boundary. Site 41TV22 was recorded as a
prehistoric burned rock midden in 1937 by A.T. Jackson and A.M. Woolsey, prior to the
construction of Mansfield Dam (Woolsey 1938). It is located within the portion of the Project
Area that extends into Lake Travis (Figure 12). The site’s centroid rests approximately 100
meters east of Lake Travis’s west bank within the normal flood pool of Lake Travis. However,
with the lack of rainfall and subsequent low lake levels in 2006, site 41TV22 was assumed to be
exposed at the time of the archival review. Based on the site form, surface artifacts recovered
in association with the burned rock midden in 1937 included lithic scrapers, a projectile point of
unknown type, and mano fragments. The NRHP and SAL eligibility status of the site was not
included on the site form due to its early recording in 1937.
No other sites, including any listed in the NRHP or designated as State Archeological
Landmarks (SALs) were recorded within or immediately adjacent to the current boundaries of
the Project Area. Based on the Atlas maps, no formal cultural resources surveys had been
conducted within the boundaries of the Project Area.

4.2

GENERAL RECONNAISSANCE

To assess the potential for unrecorded sites within the Project Area and to determine if
site 41TV22 was actually located on the property and exposed at that time by the low lake
levels, Horizon archeologists conducted a general reconnaissance assessment of the property
in November of 2006. During the general reconnaissance assessment, 2 Horizon archeologists
spent approximately 4 hours driving through and walking across portions of the Project Area to

Chapter 4.0: Archival Research and Initial Reconnaissance

Figure 12. Atlas map showing location of 41TV22

determine: 1) if settings conducive to containing cultural deposits were present; 2) if any
standing historic structures were present; 3) if any prehistoric deposits were visible on the
surface of the property; and 4) if any prior impacts to the property had occurred that would
negate the potential for cultural deposits. This field reconnaissance consisted only of a visual
inspection of the ground surface in the traversed portions of the Project Area in order to
determine if surface cultural materials were evident. No subsurface shovel testing endeavors
were conducted.
The field reconnaissance initiated in the eastern portion of the Project Area where the
upland landforms begin to slope downward toward Lake Travis. Immediately upon exiting the
field vehicle, aboriginal cultural materials were observed on the upland landform. These
included chert flakes, a biface fragment, a quartzite hammerstone, and numerous burned rocks.
As these materials were observed on an upland landform, the potential for deeply buried
deposits was extremely low due to the presence of shallow, rocky soils.

18

060231_arch_survey_report

Volume 1: Survey Level Investigations within the Proposed 1060-Acre Vizcaya Development

Following this, the crew moved down slope to the east, working its way toward the
location of site 41TV22 near the lake that was indicated by the Atlas maps (THC 2006). Upon
reaching the lower elevations of the eastern portion of the Project Area, aboriginal artifacts (e.g.,
chert flakes and burned rock) were observed over much of the area. Nearing the modern house
at the eastern edge of the Project Area, dense amounts of burned rock and chert flaking debris
were observed in the road bed and in most areas where surface visibility was good. This
surface scatter of materials continued toward the lake where the crew relocated a dense
concentration of prehistoric materials that were assumed at that time to be the remains of
previously recorded site 41TV22. Due to the low lake levels, the landform containing this site
was well exposed, and wave action over the years had served to erode the majority of the soil
on the site, leaving prehistoric artifacts exposed on the site’s surface. In addition to observing
countless chert flakes, cores, quarry blanks, bifaces fragments, hammer stones, and a metate,
the crew also located what appeared to be a deflated burned rock midden that had been
previously noted on the 41TV22 site form. Several newly excavated holes in the midden
attested to the current looting of the midden deposits. However, these looter holes also
revealed that, although much of the site’s soils had eroded away, the rocks capping the midden
had preserved the soil within the actual midden mound. An examination of the looter spoil piles
revealed that the midden deposits contained dense amounts of cultural materials (primarily
chert debitage). Based on the observed extents of the aboriginal surface scatter, the site
(presumed to be 41TV22) appeared to occupy much of the peninsula in the southeastern
portion of the subject site, well beyond the originally recorded boundaries of site 41TV22. The
density of the observed materials suggests that the area was intensively occupied over an
extended period of time by aboriginal groups.
Moving to the western portion of the Project Area (i.e., the longer north/south portion),
only an extremely low amount of cultural materials was observed by the field crew. These
included only a few chert flakes and an occasional burned rock. In addition, this portion of the
Project Area appeared to be generally lacking in the potential for buried deposits due to: 1) the
distance of the area from the original channel of the Colorado River; and 2) the predominant
presence of exposed limestone bedrock and subsurface marl deposits. In all likelihood, this
area was traversed by the aboriginal occupants of the area during hunting excursions, but was
not intensively occupied like areas closer to the Colorado River where water was available. Any
sites in this area would likely represent short-term hunting encampments rather than extended
occupation locales. Although only sparse amounts of cultural materials were observed in this
area, it should be noted that considerably less of the field effort was spent in this area, and that
the bulk of the field effort was utilized in the eastern portion of the subject site where cultural
deposits were the densest.

4.3

IN-DEPTH ARCHIVAL REVIEW

Following the general reconnaissance assessment of the property, a Horizon
archeologist accessed the site files and maps maintained by the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL) in order to gather more data pertaining to site 41TV22, which was believed
to be present in the southeastern portion of the Project Area based on the preliminary archival

HJN 060231 AR

19

Chapter 4.0: Archival Research and Initial Reconnaissance

review. Primarily, this more in-depth research was undertaken to: 1) gather the earlier notes
and report for the investigations conducted on site 41TV22 by Jackson and Woolsey in 1937
and 1938; 2) gather early photographs of the site for comparison with the current status of the
site after being submerged by Lake Travis for close to 70 years; and 3) to ascertain the exact
location and boundaries of site 41TV22 in order to clarify that its currently plotted location on the
THC’s Atlas maps was correct.
According to the site file, site 41TV22 was originally documented in 1937 by Jackson
and Woolsey during the archeological survey of the basin of then-termed Marshall Ford Lake
(now Lake Travis). When first recorded, it was referred to as Site No. 19 in the Marshall Ford
Basin and then later assigned the formal trinomial of 41TV22. The site was originally recorded
as a “burnt-rock midden” that “extends along [the] west bank of [Bee] creek for some 100 feet
and back from the stream about 45 feet” (Woolsey 1938). It is further described as being near
“Blue Hole,” a pool of deep clear water with a tall bluff on the opposite side of the creek
(Woolsey 1938).
From this initial description of the site, doubt began to surface regarding the currently
plotted location of 41TV22 on the THC’s Atlas maps. Namely, the site observed within the
Project Area at the currently plotted location of 41TV22 is located on what would have been the
north bank of Bee Creek and not on the west bank as noted in the site description. Additionally,
the site is described as being opposite a tall bluff that borders the creek. When standing on the
site observed on the property (initially assumed to be 41TV22), the area consists of sloping
hillsides that once extended down to Bee Creek with no tall bluffs present. However, looking to
the west, several tall limestone bluffs are present along the banks of Bee Creek. This
preliminary information suggested that the current plotting of site 41TV22 is off by several
hundred meters to the east.
Upon reading further into Woolsey’s (1938) field notes, further discrepancies became
obvious. Woolsey (1938) notes:
The midden is on the south bank of Bee Creek and is about one mile and a half up the
Creek from the place where it enters the Colorado. At this place the Creek is running
toward the west but within a distance of one hundred yards, the creek makes a bend and
goes north, down something of a canyon to the river. . . . Across the creek and north from
the midden and extending both up and down the creek, is a limestone bluff. Beginning
about 150 yards below the midden the creek enters a canyon, between whose walls the
creek flows all the way to the river. The walls of the canyon are of the Edwards
limestone.

Again, the location of the observed site within the Project Area is on the north bank of
Bee Creek and not the south (or west) bank. Woolsey’s continued description is somewhat
confusing as Bee Creek drains in an easterly direction into the Colorado River. He noted that
creek was running to the west and then made a bend to the north where it went down a canyon
to the river. It is assumed that he meant that the creek was running to the east.

20

060231_arch_survey_report

Volume 1: Survey Level Investigations within the Proposed 1060-Acre Vizcaya Development

Woolsey indicates that the midden is 1.5 miles up the creek (west) from where it
confluences with the Colorado River. The location of the current site in question is immediately
west (less than 100 meters) of the confluence of Bee Creek and the Colorado River.
Woolsey’s description of the limestone bluff extending up and down the creek across
from the midden may be possibly relevant in determining the actual location of 41TV22. As
noted earlier, limestone bluffs are clearly visible to the west of the location of the site on the
current property, but are nowhere near 1.5 miles west of the confluence. Rather, they are more
like several hundred meters to the west (Figure 13).
Based on the written description of the location of site 41TV22 provided by Woolsey, it
became relatively clear that the observed cultural materials within the Project Area at the
currently plotted location of 41TV22 were not actually 41TV22. In further support of this,
Woolsey (1938) noted that investigations on 41TV22 included the excavation of “50 ten-foot
squares” that were “dug to an average depth of 24 inches.” He added that “removal to another
site was made.” When standing on the current site in question, there is no evidence of earlier
investigations that would have removed such a sizeable quantity of soil. Moreover, the
presence of abundant burned rock, flakes, and other materials suggesting the presence of a
deflated midden at the current location definitively shows that the current site has not been
excavated.

Chapter 4.0: Archival Research and Initial Reconnaissance

Finally, maps within the Works Project Administration (WPA) files were reviewed to
determine if Woolsey and Jackson had actually plotted the location of 41TV22. In fact, they did
plot a location of the site on an early topographic quadrangle (Figure 14). Unfortunately, the
plotted location of 41TV22 on this early map only serves to confuse the issue further as its
plotting also does not conform entirely to Woolsey’s description. It does lie near observed
limestone bluffs, but it is not 1.5 miles west of the confluence of Bee Creek and the Colorado
River, nor is it on the south (or west) bank of Bee Creek. Regardless, it can safely be
determined that the prehistoric materials observed at the southeastern edge of the Project Area
are not those associated with site 41TV22 and that no previously recorded sites are present
within the current boundaries of the Project Area. Additionally, it can be clarified that the current
Atlas plotting of site 41TV22 is erroneous and should be corrected.

5.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

A 4-person Horizon archeological field crew completed the intensive pedestrian survey
of the USACE jurisdictional areas within the 1060-acre Project Area on the 11th and 12th of
March 2007. This was accomplished by walking linear transects along the first terrace
bordering each of the USACE jurisdictional drainages on the property and along the shorelines
of Lake Travis in the southeastern portion of the property. Generally speaking, these areas
equated to those within 30 to 60 m of either side of USACE jurisdictional drainages and the
shoreline. In all, these areas totaled approximately 229 acres within the overall 1060-acre
development (see Figure 3). The survey entailed intensive surface inspection and subsurface
shovel tests only within the USACE jurisdictional areas on the 1060-acre property.
Due to the fact that all soils within the Project Area consisted of compact rocky clay or
exposed limestone marl and limestone bedrock with little to no potential to contain buried, intact
cultural deposits, shovel tests of significant depth were generally unsuccessful, yet still
conducted in areas where soil was present. These shovel tests averaged 30 cm in diameter,
and all excavated matrix from each shovel test was passed through 6-mm hardware mesh. In
areas lacking soil deposits, intensive surface inspection was sufficient to determine if surface
cultural materials were present. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards
(TSMASS) require a minimum of 1 shovel test per 3 acres for projects measuring over 200
acres in size. In the case of the USACE jurisdictional areas on the property, a total of 76 shovel
tests were necessary to meet the minimum standards. Horizon exceeded the minimum survey
standards by excavating a total of 163 shovel tests within the USACE jurisdictional areas.
A non-collection strategy was employed during the survey efforts. All non-diagnostic
cultural materials (e.g., burned rock, lithic debitage, etc.) observed on the surface or within
shovel tests were tabulated and described in the field and then subsequently returned to where
they were found. Diagnostic cultural materials (e.g., projectile points, charcoal, etc.) were
collected for analysis and further documentation. Field notes were maintained on terrain,
vegetation, soils, land forms, shovel tests, cultural material observed (if any), etc. Standardized
shovel test forms were completed for every shovel test. These forms included location data,
depth, soil type, and notations on any artifacts encountered. Digital photographs with a photo
log were also completed as appropriate. The locations of all shovel tests were recorded via
handheld GPS units utilizing the UTM coordinate system and the NAD 27 map datum. Shovel
test locations are presented in Figure 15. Shovel test data are presented in Appendix A.

6.0 RESULTS OF THE SURVEY LEVEL INVESTIGATIONS

The survey of the USACE jurisdictional areas within the 1060-acre Vizcaya development
resulted in the documentation of 3 new prehistoric archeological sites (41TV2263, 41TV2264,
and 41TV2265) on the property. Each is described separately below. The location of each site
is presented in Figure 16.

6.1

SITE 41TV2263

6.1.1

General Description

Site 41TV2263 is an aboriginal open campsite located on the western portion of a
peninsula that extends easterly into Lake Travis (see Figure 16). The area is wooded with Live
oak, Ashe juniper, hackberry, Texas persimmon, and Chinaberry trees, with an understory of
greenbriar, prickly pear, and native grasses. Considerable amounts of flotsam over most of the
site suggest that the location has been flooded in the past when lake levels reached their
maximum extents. The most obvious portion of the site lies on the northern edge of the
peninsula, somewhat straddling a drainage above the Colorado River. As this is an upland
location, the site is situated primarily in an erosional setting (aside from the drainage swale)
where shallow, rocky soils and exposed limestone bedrock prevail. As such, cultural materials
appear to be primarily restricted to surface contexts. Visible cultural features on the site include
3 burned rock middens aligned in a relative triangle over the shallow drainage swale that
extends through the site (Figure 17). Artifact frequencies on this site appear to be densest in
the area contained within the triangle formed by the 3 middens. Observed artifacts include
several sandstone manos, cores, and chert flakes. No temporally diagnostic artifacts were
encountered. Based on the observed middens and manos, the site appears to represent a
possible plant-processing locale. General views of the site are presented in Figures 18 and 19.
6.1.2

Observed Cultural Materials

Cultural materials on the site were generally sparse considering the presence of 3
burned rock middens. Obviously, copious amounts of burned rock were present, comprising
each of the 3 middens, but associated artifacts were generally lacking. This may be due to a
decreased surface visibility over the site resulting from vegetative cover. Observed artifacts
include several sandstone mano fragments, several chert cores, and sparse amounts of lithic

debitage (Figure 20). A shovel test in the presumed center of the site produced additional
burned rocks; however, no temporally diagnostic artifacts were observed on the site.
The cultural materials on this site appeared to be primarily concentrated within the
center of the triangle formed by the 3 burned rock middens. Surface inspection beyond the
middens produced only minimal cultural materials that were found lying on exposed limestone
bedrock.
6.1.3

Cultural Features

Observed cultural features on site 41TV2263 consist of 3 burned rock middens aligned
in a relative triangle over the shallow drainage swale that extends through the site. The larger
of the 3 middens, BRM-1, consists of a mound of burned rocks measuring approximately 20.0 m
in diameter and 1.1 m high (Figure 21). Three to 4 looters holes were visible on this midden,
which is covered by large Ashe juniper trees and greenbriar. The second midden, BRM-2, is
also roughly 20.0 m in diameter and approximately 30.0 cm high (Figure 22). It is located on the
slope of the drainage extending down toward the lake and appeared to be somewhat scattered.
Finally, the third midden, BRM-3, measured only about 12.0 m in diameter with a height of 40.0
cm (Figure 23). It is also located on a sloping surface near the upper extent of the drainage
swale.
6.1.4

Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials

Based on the observed extent of the surface materials/features, the horizontal extents of
site 41TV2263 were assessed at 50 m north/south by 60 m east/west. Generally speaking, the
majority of the site consists of an erosional setting where the observed cultural materials and
features are resting on bedrock or subsurface marl. However, 1 shovel test in the central
portion of the site did produce specimens of burned rock down to a depth of 30 cm. In regard to
the 3 middens, each appears to be resting on bedrock, so materials below these features are
unlikely. However, the middens themselves retain deposits measuring between 30 and 110 cm.
6.1.5

Summary

Site 41TV2263 is an aboriginal open campsite of indeterminate age due to the lack of
recovered diagnostic materials. Generally speaking, the majority of the site lacks the potential
for buried deposits. However, the central portion of the site between the middens, as well as
the middens themselves, has the potential to contain significant cultural deposits. To determine
this, additional testing investigations are necessary. As such, it is Horizon’s opinion that the
NRHP eligibility status of site 41TV2263 is currently undetermined. Horizon recommends
NRHP eligibility testing investigations on this site to formally determine its NRHP eligibility
status.

SITE 41TV2264

6.2.1

General Description

Site 41TV2264 was recorded as a small, aboriginal open campsite situated on a bedrock
ledge above a waterfall on an intermittent drainage (Figure 24; see also Figure 16). Limestone
bedrock is prevalent across the site, and shovel tests placed in areas of soil revealed only
shallow soils overlying bedrock. Cultural materials on the site were generally sparse, consisting
of a small scatter of burned rock, an unclassified arrow point, and a scatter of lithic debitage.
Based on the observed arrow point and the scarcity of materials, the site appears to be a
temporary camp utilized during the Late Prehistoric period. The site seems to have been
completely destroyed by sheet erosion and high creek flows.
6.2.2

Observed Cultural Materials

As indicated above, cultural materials on the site were generally sparse. A scatter of
burned rock in a shallow swale appeared to be the remnants of an eroded hearth.
Approximately 6 tertiary flakes and an unclassified arrow point were observed in the area
surrounding the burned rock scatter. The arrow point has a fractured base and missing distal
tip, and, as such, was not readily assignable to a specific style (Figure 25). A shovel test on the
site encountered bedrock at a depth of 4.0 cm and failed to produce any cultural materials.
6.2.3

Cultural Features

No intact cultural features were observed on this site, although the scatter of burned rock
on the site’s surface appeared to represent an eroded hearth. It has been destroyed by erosion.
6.2.4

Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials

Based on the observed surface materials, this site is extremely small, measuring only
about 2.0 to 5.0 m in diameter. As the site is situated in an area of exposed bedrock, it lacks
buried deposits. All observed cultural materials were confined to the surface of the site.
6.2.5

Summary

Site 41TV2264 was recorded as a small, aboriginal open campsite situated on a bedrock
ledge above waterfall on an intermittent drainage. Based on the scarcity of materials and the
observed arrow point, the site appears to be a temporary camp utilized during the Late
Prehistoric period. It has been completely destroyed by natural forces. Because of this, it is
Horizon’s opinion that site 41TV2264 is not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and that no further
work at this site is warranted. Horizon recommends that cultural resources clearance be
granted for this location.

SITE 41TV2265

6.3.1

General Description

Site 41TV2265 is located at or extremely near the location of previously recorded
41TV22 as indicated on the Atlas map files. However, as discussed in Section 4.0, site 41TV22
is misplotted based on the descriptions of the site as well as its location on the WPA era maps.
As such, this location was recorded as an entirely new site and assigned the trinomial
41TV2265.
Site 41TV2265 was recorded as an extensive aboriginal campsite located on what
currently is a peninsula that extends into Lake Travis (Figure 26; see also Figure 16). Prior to
the construction of Mansfield Dam and the subsequent flooding of the Colorado River basin, this
location would have consisted of hill bordered to the south Bee Creek and to the east by the
Colorado River. The hill would have extended to the east and southeast toward the confluence
of the 2 waterways (see Figure 14). With the flooding of the lake, the southeastern portion of
the hill was submerged, leaving only the elevated ridgeline exposed. Low-lake levels at the time
of the survey allowed for the documentation of portions of the site that have been submerged by
the lake for roughly the past 70 years. General photographs of site 41TV2265 are presented in
Figures 27 through 30.
The site consists entirely of upland locations entirely lacking in alluvial deposits. As
such, cultural debris was scattered on the surface over a large area. Observed cultural
materials include countless burned rocks, dense areas of chert debitage, manos, metate
fragments, early state bifaces, an Edwards arrow point, a Darl dart point, a Travis dart point,
and a possible lanceolate projectile point. These specimens suggest that the site was occupied
potentially as early as the Paleo-Indian period up through the Late Prehistoric period. In
addition to the observed surface materials, at least 5 burned rock middens were observed at
various locations on this large site. Three of the middens are located in an upland area along
the ridge of the peninsula, while 2 are located on a finger of the peninsula that has been
submerged by the lake (Figure 26). Based on the dense amounts of cultural materials on this
site as well as the 5 observed middens, the site appears to be the result of repeated, intensive
occupations spanning much of prehistory.
6.3.2

Observed Cultural Materials

As indicated above, rather copious amounts of cultural material were observed littered
over the site’s surface. This material consisted primarily of dense amounts of scattered burned
rock and lithic debitage. These were evidenced primarily in the 2-track roads traversing the site
and in areas of exposed limestone bedrock where vegetation was minimal. In addition to these
general materials, numerous sandstone and quartzite manos, sandstone metate fragments, and
early stage bifaces (blanks) were observed scattered over the site’s surface. One of the
observed manos appears to be made from Packsaddle schist, a material that would have been
transported to the site from a fair distance away. A photograph of select specimens is
presented in Figure 31.

In addition to the generally non-diagnostic cultural material encountered on the site’s
surface, several temporally diagnostic projectile points were also recovered. In all, a total of 4
projectile points or point fragments were recovered during the survey level investigations on the
site. These include a Darl dart point and a medial fragment of lanceolate point from the upper
ridge of the site, and an Edwards arrow point and a Travis dart point from the lower portion of
the site nearest the lake. The lanceolate fragment suggests a possible Paleo-Indian
occupation, while the Travis dart point reflects a later occupation during the Middle Archaic
period. The Darl point indicates usage of the site during the Transitional Archaic period
(possibly into the Late Prehistoric period), while the Edwards arrow point rounds out the
temporal sequence with the Late Prehistoric period. A photograph of these specimens is
presented in Figure 32.
It should be noted that evidence of artifact collecting was visible over the site and that
any larger specimens that might have once littered the site’s surface have likely been looted
from the site, leaving behind the smaller, less-obvious specimens. Considering the dense
amount of non-tool materials over the site, the recovered tool counts from the survey are
generally low in comparison.
6.3.3

Cultural Features

In addition to the observed surface materials, at least 5 burned rock middens were
observed at various locations on this large site. Three of the middens are located in an upland
area along the ridge of the peninsula, while 2 are located on a finger of the peninsula that has
been submerged by the lake (see Figure 26). The largest of the 5 middens, BRM-1, is located
on the north central portion of the upland ridge of the site. It measures approximately 12.0 m in
diameter and approximately 70.0 cm high (Figure 33). It is entirely covered with soil and grass
and was only found when a shovel test placed on the visible mound produced burned rock
specimens (Figure 34). BRM-2 is located immediately adjacent (southwest) to BRM-1 and is
not readily visible aside from a small rise in topography. It measures approximately 12.0 m in
diameter and roughly 40.0 cm in height. BRM-3 is a small, incipient midden located on the
upper ridge of the site, west of BRM-1 and BRM-2. It was exposed within the profile of a
shallow road or borrow scrape. It measured roughly 5.0 m in diameter and 25.0 cm thick. The
Darl dart point noted above was found near this midden.
The remaining 2 middens are located in the lower elevations of the site that are usually
submerged by the lake (see Figure 26). The smaller of these 2 middens, BRM-4, is located on
the northern portion of the submerged area and consisted only of a small rise composed of
burned rock (Figure 35). It measures roughly 5.0 m in diameter and 30.0 cm in height. The
larger midden, BRM-5, was documented as more of an extensive concentration of burned rock
and lithic debris rather than the typical mound of burned rock one thinks of when burned rock
middens are mentioned (Figure 35). When first observed, it appeared to have once been a
mound of burned rocks and other debris that had perhaps been deflated by wave action and
inundation. Based on the observed limestone bedrock prevalent across this portion of the site,
it was assumed that BRM-5 was resting on bedrock. However, a soil probe or “pokey rod”
pressed into this midden extended to a depth of 1.5 meters below surface, failing to encounter
bedrock. This suggested some sort of pit or karst feature beneath the midden deposits. The

Edwards arrow point and Travis dart point were found within the dense cultural material
comprising this midden, indicating a Middle Archaic and Late Prehistoric usage of the area.
6.3.4

Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials

Based on the observed surface scatter of cultural materials, this extensive site appears
to span a horizontal extent of roughly 450 m east/west by 200 m north/south.
As the site is entirely an upland location void of alluvial deposits and covered with
exposed limestone bedrock, the majority of the cultural materials appear to be confined to
surface contexts. During the delineation of the site, a total of 37 shovel tests were placed along
transects over the site. All were extremely shallow, encountering bedrock between depths of
2.0 and 20.0 cm. The exceptions to this are, of course, the midden deposits that range between
25.0 and 70.0 cm for BRMs 1 through 4. In the case of BRM-5, the “pokey rod” placed in the
center of this midden suggests deposits up to 1.5 m in depth, perhaps within some sort of pit or
karst feature. Again, areas away from the middens possess very shallow or no subsurface
deposits.
6.3.5

Summary

In summary, site 41TV2265 is an extensive aboriginal campsite located on what
currently is a peninsula that extends into Lake Travis. The site consists entirely of upland
locations entirely lacking in alluvial deposits. Recovered diagnostic specimens suggest that the
site was occupied potentially as early as the Paleo-Indian period up through the Late Prehistoric
period. In addition to the observed surface materials, at least 5 burned rock middens were
observed at various locations on this large site. While all 5 middens appeared to be composed
of dense amounts of burned rock situated on shallow soils or limestone bedrock, a probe or
“pokey rod” pressed into the midden closest to the lake extended to a depth of 1.5 meters below
surface, suggesting some sort of pit or karst feature beneath the midden deposits. Based on
the dense amounts of cultural materials on this site as well as the 5 observed middens, the
potential exists that site 41TV2265 could contain significant cultural deposits. However,
additional testing investigations are necessary to determine this. As such, it is Horizon’s opinion
that the NRHP eligibility status of site 41TV2265 is currently undetermined.

7.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

7.1

SUMMARY OF INVENTORY RESULTS

During March 2007, Horizon conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the
USACE jurisdictional areas within the proposed 1060-acre Vizcaya development near
Spicewood, Travis County, Texas. Although the development is privately funded and located on
private property, the development of the property within the USACE jurisdictional areas will
require a Section 404 permit issued by the USACE. As such, the development within these
jurisdictional areas falls under the regulations of Section 106 of the NHPA. Horizon conducted
the survey at the request of the Lake Travis Ranch, LLC in compliance with Section 106 of the
NHPA. The purpose of the investigations was to determine if any archeological sites were
located within the USACE jurisdictional areas and, if any existed, to determine their eligibility for
inclusion in the NRHP. In all, the USACE jurisdictional areas on the property total 229 acres of
the overall 1060 acres.
The survey resulted in the documentation of 3 new prehistoric archeological sites
(41TV2263, 41TV2264, and 41TV2265), which are summarized in Table 2. All 3 of these sites
are prehistoric open campsites, each exhibiting various degrees of utilization. Site 41TV2263 is
a moderate-sized campsite with 3 visible burned rock middens present. The presence of
several manos and metate fragments suggests that plant processing was a prominent activity at
this site. No temporally diagnostic materials were observed on the site.
Based on the
presence of the 3 burned rock middens and the potential for buried deposits within these
features, the possibility exists that site 41TV2263 could contain significant cultural deposits.
However, additional testing investigations are necessary to determine this. As such, it is
Horizon’s opinion that the NRHP eligibility status of site 41TV2263 is currently undetermined.
Site 41TV2264 is a small short-term aboriginal encampment on a rock ledge lacking
buried deposits. The site consists of a scatter of burned rock that appears to be an eroded
hearth, an unclassified arrow point, and a scatter of lithic debitage. The artifacts suggest that
this was a small encampment utilized possibly as a hunting camp during the Late Prehistoric
period. Because the site appears to have been completely destroyed by sheet erosion and high
creek flows, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41TV2264 is not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP
and that no further work at this site is warranted.

HJN 060231 AR

Chapter 7.0: Summary and Recommendations

Finally, site 41TV2265 is an extensive aboriginal campsite located on what currently is a
peninsula that extends into Lake Travis. Low lake levels at the time of the survey allowed for
the documentation of portions of the site that have been submerged by the lake for roughly the
past 70 years. The site consists entirely of upland locations entirely lacking in alluvial deposits.
As such, cultural debris was scattered on the surface over a large area. Observed cultural
materials include countless burned rocks, dense areas of chert debitage, manos, metate
fragments, early stage bifaces, an Edwards arrow point, a Darl dart point, a Travis dart point,
and a possible lanceolate projectile point. These specimens suggest that the site was occupied
potentially as early as the Paleo-Indian period up through the Late Prehistoric period. In
addition to the observed surface materials, at least 5 burned rock middens were observed at
various locations on this large site. While all 5 middens appeared to be composed of dense
amounts of burned rock situated on shallow soils or limestone bedrock, a probe or “pokey rod”
pressed into the midden closest to the lake extended to a depth of 1.5 m below surface,
suggesting some sort of pit or karst feature beneath the midden deposits. Based on the dense
amounts of cultural materials on this site as well as the 5 observed middens, the potential exists
that site 41TV2265 could contain significant cultural deposits. However, additional testing
investigations are necessary to determine this. As such, it is Horizon’s opinion that the NRHP
eligibility status of site 41TV2265 is currently undetermined.

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION IN THE NRHP

Ultimately, management decisions regarding cultural resource properties are a function
of the potential importance of the sites in addressing defined research needs. Cultural
resources are usually evaluated according to criteria established to determine their eligibility for
inclusion in the NRHP. Determinations of eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP are based on the
criteria presented in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) in 36 CFR §60.4(a-d). The
4 criteria of eligibility are applied following the identification of relevant historical themes and
related research questions:

44

060231_arch_survey_report

Volume 1: Survey Level Investigations within the Proposed 1060-Acre Vizcaya Development

The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of
location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and:
a. [T]hat are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history; or,
b. [T]hat are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or,
c.

[T]hat embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose
components may lack individual distinction; or,

d. [T]hat have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory
or history (U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service (36 CFR
§60.4).

The first step in the evaluation process is to define the significance of the property by
identifying the particular aspect of history or prehistory to be addressed and the reasons why
information on that topic is important. The second step is to define the kinds of evidence or the
data requirements that the property must exhibit to provide significant information. These data
requirements in turn indicate the kind of integrity that the site must possess to be significant.
This concept of integrity relates both to the contextual integrity of such entities as structures,
districts, or archeological deposits and to the applicability of the potential database to pertinent
research questions. Without such integrity, the significance of a resource is very limited.
For a cultural resource to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, it must meet legal
standards of eligibility that are determined by 3 requirements: (1) properties must possess
significance, (2) the significance must satisfy at least 1 of the 4 criteria for eligibility listed above,
and (3) significance should be derived from an understanding of historic context. As discussed
here, historic context refers to the organization of information concerning prehistory and history
according to various periods of development in various times and at various places. Thus, the
significance of a property can best be understood through knowledge of historic development
and the relationship of the resource to other, similar properties within a particular period of
development. Most prehistoric sites are usually only eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under
Criterion D, which considers their potential to contribute data important to an understanding of
prehistory. All 4 criteria employed for determining NRHP eligibility potentially can be brought to
bear for historic sites.

7.3

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Site 41TV2263 is an aboriginal open campsite with 3 burned rock middens and the
potential for buried deposits within these features. With this in mind, the potential exists that site
41TV2263 could contain significant cultural deposits. However, additional testing investigations
are necessary to determine this, and it is Horizon’s opinion that the site’s NRHP eligibility status

HJN 060231 AR

45

Chapter 7.0: Summary and Recommendations

is currently undetermined. Horizon recommends NRHP eligibility testing investigations on this
site to formally determine its NRHP eligibility status.
Site 41TV2264 consists of a small, aboriginal open campsite situated on a bedrock
ledge above a waterfall on an intermittent drainage that has been completely destroyed by
sheet erosion and high creek flows. Because of this, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41TV2264
is not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and that no further work at this site is warranted.
Horizon recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted for this location.
Site 41TV2265 is an extensive aboriginal campsite with dense amounts of cultural
materials as well as the 5 observed middens. With this in mind, the potential exists that site
41TV2265 could contain significant cultural deposits. However, additional testing investigations
are necessary to determine this, and it is Horizon’s opinion that the NRHP eligibility status of
site 41TV2265 is currently undetermined. Horizon recommends NRHP eligibility testing
investigations on this site to formally determine its NRHP eligibility status.
Aside from these 3 sites, no other sites were documented within the remaining USACE
jurisdictional areas in the Project Area. As such, it is Horizon’s opinion that development within
the USACE jurisdictional areas beyond the boundaries of sites 41TV2263 and 41TV2265 will
have no impact on significant cultural resources. Horizon therefore recommends that cultural
resources clearance be granted for all of the USACE jurisdictional areas within the 1060-acre
property with the exception of the locations of sites 41TV2263 and 41TV2265. As stated above,
NRHP eligibility testing is recommended for these 2 sites to formally determine the NRHP
eligibility status of each.
