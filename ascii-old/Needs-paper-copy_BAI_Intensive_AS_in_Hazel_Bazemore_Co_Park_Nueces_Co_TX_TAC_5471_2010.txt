On December 31, 2009, and January 1, 2010, Blanton & Associates, Inc. (B&A) conducted an intensive
archeological survey of approximately 20 acres in Hazel Bazemore County Park in Nueces County,
Texas. The survey was conducted at the request of Olivarri & Associates, Inc., and on behalf of Nueces
County, prior to the proposed mechanical removal of debris and trash (e.g., hundreds of automobile tires)
from a large ravine in the park and subsequent ravine stabilization efforts. Investigations discovered no
prehistoric or historic archeological resources. Given these results, B&A recommend that the proposed
project should be allowed to proceed as planned without additional investigations, as no sites eligible for
formal State Archeological Landmark designation would be impacted. No artifacts were collected and
curation was unnecessary.

PROJECT TITLE: An Intensive Archeological Survey in Hazel Bazemore County Park, Nueces
County, Texas.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: At the request of Olivarri & Associates, Inc., and on behalf of Nueces
County, Texas, Blanton & Associates, Inc. (B&A) conducted an intensive archeological survey of
approximately 20 acres in Hazel Bazemore County Park (HBCP) in Nueces County, Texas. The survey
was conducted prior to the proposed mechanical removal of debris from a large ravine in the park, as well
as subsequent ravine stabilization efforts.
Nueces County proposes to remove hundreds of old tires, as well concrete, brick, metal, brush, and tree
limbs and other debris from the ravine in the southern part of HBCP. The proposed impact area is
bounded on the west and southwest by a park road while County Road 69 (CR 69) bounds the southeast
and east sides of the project area. The northern end of the study area, which would be used as a staging
area for equipment and supplies during the proposed undertaking, corresponds with an existing park road
and picnic area (with surface and subsurface utilities). Heavy machinery (e.g., cranes and/or tracked
vehicles) would be used to remove the debris from the ravine. Once cleared, the sides of the ravine would
be stabilized against further erosion. Vertical impacts associated with the proposed stabilization of the
ravine against erosion would extend at least 100 centimeters below ground surface. In addition to
subsurface disturbances, surface impacts (e.g., compression or crushing of artifacts or features) from the
machinery would occur to any archeological resources in the study area. Access to the ravine would be
from CR 69, as well as potentially along corridors cleared through the vegetation along the margins of the
ravine.
PROJECT LOCATION: Hazel Bazemore County Park is on CR 69 east of River Hills Country Club
and approximately one mile west of the IH 37/US 77 interchange in the City of Corpus Christi, Nueces
County, Texas.
TOTAL ACREAGE: Approximately 20.0 acres.
DATE OF WORK: December 31, 2009 and January 1, 2010.
PURPOSE OF WORK: B&A was assisting the project sponsor in their compliance with the Antiquities
Code of Texas.

COMMENTS: Given that no archeological resources were discovered during the survey, B&A
recommends that the proposed project should be allowed to proceed as planned without additional
investigations as no archeological sites eligible for formal State Archeological Landmark (SAL)
designation would be impacted. If the proposed project should require additional workspace outside of the
survey area, then additional archeological investigations there may be necessary.

On December 31, 2009 and January 1, 2010 Blanton & Associates, Inc. (B&A) conducted an intensive
archeological survey of approximately 20 acres in Hazel Bazemore County Park (HBCP) in Nueces
County, Texas. The park is on County Road (CR) 69 east of River Hills Country Club (Figures 1 and 2)
and approximately one mile west of the IH 37/US 77 interchange. The survey was conducted at the
request of Olivarri & Associates, Inc., and on behalf of Nueces County, prior to the proposed mechanical
removal of debris from a large ravine in the park, as well as subsequent ravine stabilization efforts.
Nueces County proposes to remove hundreds of old tires, as well concrete, brick, metal, brush, and tree
limbs and other debris from the ravine in the southern part of HBCP. The proposed work area is bounded
on the west and southwest by a park road while CR 69 bounds the southeast and east sides of the project
area. The northern end of the study area, which would be used as a staging area for equipment and
supplies during the proposed undertaking, corresponds with an existing park road and picnic area (with
surface and subsurface utilities). Heavy machinery (e.g., cranes and/or tracked vehicles) would be used to
remove the debris from the ravine. Once cleared, the sides of the ravine would be stabilized against
further erosion. Vertical impacts associated with the proposed stabilization of the ravine against erosion
would extend at least 100 centimeters below ground surface. In addition to subsurface disturbances,
surface impacts (e.g., compression or crushing of artifacts or features) from the machinery would occur to
any archeological resources in the study area. Access to the ravine would be from CR 69, as well as
potentially along corridors cleared through the vegetation along the margins of the ravine.
Because the planned construction would occur on property owned by Nueces County, the proposed
project is subject to the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas, now subsumed in Title 13, Part II of
the Texas Administrative Code. Protection of archeological sites under state law is tied to eligibility for
formal State Archeological Landmark (SAL) designation pursuant to 13 TAC 26.8. This legislation
defines the necessary conditions for recognition and preservation of SALs and requires that any state
agency or subdivision of the state must identify potential SALs through survey of public lands prior to
actions that could potentially damage those SALs. The Texas Historical Commission (THC) Division of
Archeology administers the codeâs provisions. Archeological surveys must be conducted under a Texas
Antiquities Permit issued by the THC in accordance with the provisions of the code. This project was
conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 5471 issued to Principal Investigator Brandon S. Young.
The intent of the survey was to identify and describe all archeological resources discovered within the
project area, evaluate their potential eligibility for formal SAL designation and, if significant resources
were discovered, make recommendations for future archeological management options such as avoidance,
preservation, or further investigations.

Geology of HBCP consists of the Pleistocene-age Beaumont Formation that primarily consists of clay,
silt, sand and gravel from stream channel, point bar, levee or backswamp deposits. Massive
accumulations of caliche are common (Barnes 1975). Given the age of the Beaumont Formation, which
predates known human occupation of the region, it has little potential to contain intact buried
archeological deposits.
SOI L S
Soils in the proposed survey area are described as Gullied Land due to extensive erosion. Gullied Land is
steep and consists mostly as clay (with occasional loamy soils) in bands along drainages. Surface soil
only remains as isolated âislandsâ surrounded by erosional gullies. If present, surface soil is gray crumbly
clay approximately 30 centimeters thick (0 to 30 centimeters below ground surface) overlying light gray
clay subsoil over hard, limy basal clay (Francki et al. 1995). Given the possibility of some intact soils
along the margins of the ravine, there is a potential for the project area to contain shallowly buried
archeological material.
F L OR A
The vegetation of the study area is relatively diverse Tamaulipan thornshrub on the drier uplands and
slopes that merge into riparian woodlands in the ravine. Dominant canopy species include Texas
sugarberry (Celtis laevigata), anaqua (Ehretia anacua), and honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa). Other
species observed in this habitat patch include lotebush (Zizyphus obtusifolia), Texas torchwood (Amyris
texana), cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia), winged elm (U. alata), colima (Zanthoxylum fagara), southwest
myrtle croton (Bernardia myricifolia), allthorn (Koeberlinia spinosa), and retama (Parkinsonia aculata).
Common herbaceous species in the project area include guineagrass (Urochloa maxima), buffelgrass
(Pennisetum ciliare), common bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon), common lantana (Lantana camara),
pigeonberry (Rivina humilis), narrow-leaf erect dayflower (Commelina erecta), sensitive brier (Mimosa
sp.) three-awn grass (Aristida sp.), King Ranch bluestem (Bothriochloa ischaemum), and Texas
gramagrass (Bouteloua rigidiseta),

A review of records available on the THCâs online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) was
conducted on November 22, 2009 to determine the presence of any previously recorded sites or
previously investigated project areas in or near the study area. The research indicated that there are no
previously recorded archeological sites within the planned impact area. However, the review did indicate
a series of previously recorded prehistoric sites (41NU225 through 41NU229) on private property
adjacent to the southeast corner of HBCP, as well as several sites (e.g., 41NU79, 41NU90, and 41NU208)
downstream and within 1,000 meters of the proposed construction area.
Near the southern margins of HBCP along the dissected upland bluff overlooking the Nueces River is a
concentration of five prehistoric sites (41NU225 through 41NU229). The sites were originally recorded in
1984 during a survey for the proposed Bayfront Landmass Development Project. The sites consisted of
scatters of flint flakes, chips, cores, bifacial preforms, utilized flakes, cobbles, shell, and several small
burnt clay nodules. Site 41NU227 had one Late Prehistoric ceramic sherd and site 41NU228 exhibited
evidence of a possible oyster shell midden and a Matatmoros projectile point. Examinations of cutbank
profiles and cuts along existing dirt roads, as well as backhoe trenching, revealed subsurface artifacts
extending from 0 to 30 centimeters below ground surface. Due to disturbances, none of the sites were
recommended for additional investigations (Warren 1993).
In 1985, the Galveston District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducted a survey in parts of the
area previously surveyed by Warren (1993). During those investigations site 41NU225, 41NU226, and
41NU229 were revisited and it was recommended that additional subsurface testing would determine if
there was any in situ cultural deposits remaining beneath the depth of disturbances (TASA 2009).
In 1972, T. R. Hester recorded prehistoric site 41NU79, which is approximately 1,100 meters downstream
from HBCP. Site 41NU79 is on the same dissected upland bluff as the above described sites. The site is
described as, â...in the humus zone up to 1.5 feet thick, overlying caliche and clays. Numerous Bulimulus
shells, burned clay nodules, flint flakes, and scattered Rangia sp.â Roughly 100 meters northwest of
41NU79 is site 41NU90, which was also recorded by T. R. Hesterâs survey. This site was recorded as a
Rangia flexuaosa midden approximately 50 feet by two to three feet and four to six feet thick and buried
60 to 90 centimeters below ground surface (TASA 2009).
Site 41NU208 was recorded in 1983 by a member of the Texas Archeological Society. The site contained
two human burials exposed during landscaping and earth-moving activities within an existing
subdivision. Observed cultural materials included a compact pavement of Rangia flexuosa clam shells,
Rabdotus sp.; mammal long bone fragments and baked clay nodules (TASA 2009).

B&A conducted an intensive archeological survey of the planned impact area in HBCP with surface and
subsurface investigations as necessary based on field conditions. Investigations complied with appropriate
archeological survey methods as defined in the Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines (NPS
1983), the Guidelines of the Council of Texas Archeologists (1987), and survey standards developed by
the THC in conjunction with the Council of Texas Archeologists (THC n.d.). All surface investigations
were thoroughly photo-documented with digital cameras.
Surface investigations consisted of a 100 percent pedestrian inspection of the ground surface within the
proposed impact area. Where possible, cutbank profiles along the ravine were inspected for the presence
of buried archeological deposits. Given the study areaâs geology and soil characteristics, backhoe
trenching was unwarranted and subsurface investigations consisted of systematic shovel testing.
Shovel test excavations were systematically conducted at 15- to 30-meter intervals. Shovel tests were 30
by 40 centimeters in size and excavated with a spade in arbitrary 20-centimeter levels until
100 centimeters below ground surface was reached or until soil characteristics or bedrock prohibited
deeper excavation. All removed soil was screened through 0.25-inch wire mesh to ensure artifact
recovery. All appropriate data were recorded on a B&A shovel-test form, and all shovel-test locations
were plotted with a hand-held global positioning system (GPS) receiver.

Intensive survey investigations in HBCP discovered no prehistoric or historic archeological resources or
historic standing structures (Figure 3). The proposed impact area around the ravine has been disturbed to
varying degrees by natural erosion, previous vegetation clearing, as well as park road construction and
maintenance (Figure 4). Additionally, the northern edge of the project area is an existing picnic area and
paved parking lot with buried utilities.
The ravine itself is steep-sided with an average depth of about 10 to 20 meters and choked with dense
woody vegetation (Figure 5). The remainder of the proposed impact area exhibited approximately 25 to
40 percent ground surface visibility (Figure 4). Given these conditions, in conjunction with soil and
geologic characteristics of the study area, systematic shovel testing was necessary to determine the
presence or absence of shallowly buried archeological material.
Subsurface investigations consisted of the excavation of 26 shovel tests (ST) (Appendix A and Figure 3)
and the inspection of cutbank profiles where possible within the ravine. As Appendix A indicates, the
maximum depth of excavation was 90 centimeters below ground surface (e.g., ST 24). Shovel testing
typically revealed three strata consisting of clay loam or clay (from 0 to a maximum depth of 48
centimeters below ground surface) overlying sandy clay or clay that in turn overlies sandy clay or clay
subsoil. An exception to this general pattern was observed in STs 22 through 26, which exhibited one
strata of construction fill containing rock and modern glass fragments, beer bottles, brick fragments, and
plastic from 0 to a maximum depth of 42 centimeters below ground surface (e.g., ST 22) overlying coarse
sand (to a maximum depth of 77 centimeters below ground surface in ST 22) that overlies eroded
sandstone bedrock (Appendix A).
Surface and subsurface investigations in HBCP discovered no archeological materials or historic standing
structures. Modern debris and trash (e.g., chicken bones, bottles, bottle caps, etc. from park visitors; as
well as charcoal and ash from the cleaning of the parkâs barbeque pits) were observed on the ground
surface, as well as the upper levels of several STs, and represent the only cultural material discovered
during the survey. Based on these results, it is B&Aâs opinion that there is little potential for the proposed
impact area to contain previously unidentified archeological deposits.

Intensive archeological survey efforts in HBCP within the proposed impact area discovered no
archeological resources or historic standing structures. Surface investigations indicated that the surface
throughout the planned impact area (and the park itself) has experienced disturbances from erosion, heavy
machinery (during park road construction and maintenance episodes, as well as vegetation clearing, and
construction of park facilities), and general park use. Subsurface investigations revealed primarily dense
clay loam or clay overlying sandy clay. Modern debris and trash were the only discovered cultural
materials.
Given the negative results of the survey, it is the opinion of B&A that there is little to no potential for the
study area to contain intact archeological or historic resources eligible for formal SAL designation that
could contribute new or important information to our understanding of regional or local prehistory and
history. B&A recommends, therefore, that because no surface or subsurface archeological deposits or
historic standing structures would be impacted by the proposed debris removal and ravine stabilization,
the proposed project should be allowed to proceed as planned without additional investigations
If it is determined that the proposed project requires impacts to occur outside the recent survey area, then
further archeological investigations would be necessary in those areas. If evidence of archeological and
historic resources is identified during construction, work in the immediate area should cease until the
THC is contacted and accidental discovery procedures can be implemented.
