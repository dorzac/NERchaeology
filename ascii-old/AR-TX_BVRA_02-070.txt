ABSTRACT
A Phase I archaeological survey of 12 areas (4.8 miles) along a 7.2 mile right-ofway in central Madison County, Texas was conducted in November 2000 by Brazos
Valley Research Associates (BVRA) of Bryan, Texas under Texas Antiquities permit
number 2485. William E. Moore was the Principal Investigator and supervised the
project. The project area was investigated using shovel testing and probing. One
prehistoric site (41MA26) was identified in the right-of-way. Site 41MA26 is a prehistoric
campsite on Iron Creek in which no diagnostic artifacts or features were found. The
eastern edge of the site occupies an area that was off limits to the survey crew.
Therefore, the significance of this site can't be determined until the remainder of the site
area is investigated. It is recommended that construction be allowed to proceed as
planned in those areas surveyed except at site 41MA26 and in two areas where
backhoe trenching of floodplain areas was not possible at the time of the survey due to
recent rain. Copies of the report are on file at the Archeology Division, Texas Historical
Commission; the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory; Texas Department of
Transportation; Brazos Valley Research Associates; and Corrigan Consulting, Inc. The
artifacts and supporting documents have been placed in permanent curation at the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin, Texas.

INTRODUCTION
BVRA was retained by Corrigan Consulting, Inc. of Seabrook, Texas to conduct a
cultural resources survey of proposed right-of-way (ROW) along a 7.2 mile segment of
State Highway 21/U.S. Highway 190 from a point 2.7 miles east of North Zulch to Farm
to Market Road 1452 in central Madison County (Figure 1).
The proposed highway ROW varies in width from 50 to 316 feet. In an attempt to
avoid affecting as many residences as possible, the proposed ROW is on the north side
of the highway in some areas and on the south side in others. The project area as
currently planned is depicted on United States Geological Survey (USGS) topographical
maps Madisonville (dated 1963) and North Zulch (dated 1975; photorevised 1989) and
on engineering maps provided by WSBC Civil Engineers, Inc. The USGS maps depict
the general route of the project area and appear as Appendix I to this report.
Although the proposed 7.2 mile ROW crosses several major streams, only
Foards Branch and Iron Creek are in the area for which permission was obtained.
Other minor drainages, usually tributaries of major streams and lower reaches of
tributaries, cross the highway along the entire route. The rest of the ROW follows
stretches of uplands between drainages.
Because of the potential for archaeological sites within the current project area,
an archaeological survey was required by the Archeology Division, Texas Historical
Commission before the Texas Department of Transportation would be able to proceed
with construction. In order to satisfy this requirement, Corrigan Consulting, Inc.
contracted with BVRA to perform this service. Antiquities Permit 2485 was assigned to
this project by the Texas Historical Commission. The project number assigned by
BVRA is 97-17. The fieldwork was conducted on November 12-15, 2000.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Madison County is poorly represented in the archaeological record in terms of
numbers of site recorded. The project area is located in the Prairie Savanna
Archeological Study Region of the Eastern Planning Region as defined by the
Department of Antiquities Protection (now Archeology Division) in Archeology in the
Eastern Planning Region, Texas: A Planning Document (Kenmotsu and Perttula
1993:6). As of October 17, 1997, there were 24 recorded prehistoric and historic sites
in Madison County (TARL site records). According to Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993:11),
Madison County in 1997 contained 0.001 - 0.1 site per square mile and is one of the
counties with the lowest density of recorded sites in Texas.
Although Madison County is located in the Prairie-Savanna study region, as
defined by Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993), it is immediately adjacent to the Southeast
Texas planning region to the south and the Northeast Texas planning region to the east
(Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:6). Therefore, Madison County probably shares cultural
traits with these nearby regions.
Only one major survey involving Madison County has been conducted. In 1981,
Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (Kotter 1982) conducted a cultural resources survey of the
Millican Project. The purpose of this investigation was to survey transects in order to
sample the cultural resources of the Navasota River Valley in Brazos, Grimes, Leon,
Madison, and Robertson counties. The data collected were used to assess the adverse
affects of four proposed reservoir alternatives prior to selection of the final reservoir site.
This project recorded sixteen cultural resource sites. Of this number, 6 are prehistoric,
3 are historic, 1 contained both prehistoric and historic components, and 6 consisted of
isolated prehistoric finds.
Prehistoric occupations in the region cover all time periods from Paleo-indian
through Historic Caddoan, circa 9500 B.C. - A.D. 1860 (Kenmotsu and Perttula
1993:44). There is no evidence, however, of historic Caddo sites in Madison County.
Previously recorded sites tend to be predominantly Late Prehistoric with several isolated
finds. The reader is referred to this comprehensive and well organized document for
additional information regarding the archaeological background for Madison County and
vicinity. Historic sites dating from the 19th century through the present are common in
the county and region.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area is located within the West Gulf Coastal Plain section of the
Coastal Plain physiographic province as defined by Fenneman (1938:100-120). This
physiographic section is subdivided according to the age of the geological formations
(Gulf series) that roughly parallel the Texas coastline. The area is hilly and situated
within the East Texas timber belt. Gould (1969) describes it as an area characterized
by gently rolling to hilly topography with light colored soils that are acid sandy loams or
sands. The climate is subhumid to humid and the weather is considered to be
predominately warm. Annual rainfall for the county is 41.50 inches. A January
minimum temperature of 40 degrees and a July maximum temperature of 94 degrees
combine to produce a growing season of 272 days (Kingston and Harris 1983:246). The
altitude varies from 200-370 feet. The 7.2 mile ROW is located on a tract of land that is
crossed by two major streams, namely Foards Branch and Iron Creek. Elevations vary
from 200 feet along the lower creek terraces to over 300 feet on the higher terraces.

METHODS
The field survey was preceded by a check of site records housed at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas and an examination of
archaeological site reports and other manuscripts. At the request of BVRA, the TARL
records were checked for a listing of known sites in the project area and vicinity by Jean
Hughes, Assistant Curator of Records.
Prior to the field survey, a reconnaissance was conducted by the Principal
Investigator and Project Archaeologist. The entire route was driven, and the project
area was divided into two categories - areas to examine through a surface survey only
and high probability areas to be examined through shovel testing and backhoe
trenching. Areas to be examined by a walkover are those tracts primarily between
drainages. These are often lengthy segments not close to water. The main purpose in
walking over these areas by the survey crew was to look for surface evidence of historic
sites not associated with standing structures. Areas next to creeks that seemed to be
likely settings for prehistoric sites were marked for shovel testing and probing. In all, 12
areas (A-L) were evaluated using one of the two methods described above (see
Appendix I).
The project area was examined in the field by means of a Phase I 100%
Pedestrian Survey. The entire tract (areas for which permission was available) was
walked by the field crew and Principal Investigator. In terms of prehistoric site location,
sandy terraces adjacent to creeks are the areas of highest probability. Therefore,
shovel tests and probes were concentrated in these areas. All excavated fill from
shovel tests was screened through 1/4 inch hardware cloth, data obtained from shovel
testing were recorded on a shovel test log (Appendix II), and shovel test profiles were
drawn in the field. In all, 27 shovel tests were dug. Each test was excavated to clay
and backfilled. Individual tests were 30 x 50 cm in size and varied in depth from 10 to
90 centimeters below the existing ground surface. When exposure was favorable, the
exposed surface was examined in addition to shovel testing. Shovel probes (not
screened), designed to test the subsurface, were dug in selected areas. In all, 28
probes were dug throughout the ROW.
It should be noted that the entire 7.2 mile ROW was not investigated during this
study. At the time of this survey, permission had not been granted for certain tracts,
and landowners of other tracts had not responded to letters requesting permission sent
by Corrigan Consulting, Inc. Only these areas for which permission had been obtained
were examined by the field survey crew. It has been calculated that approximately 4.8
miles of the 7.2 proposed ROW were investigated.

5

Two floodplain areas (Foards Branch and Iron Creek) were not investigated due
to standing water and generally wet conditions. These areas were marked on the
engineering maps and recommended for backhoe trenching at a later date. A
"windshield survey" of the areas off limits to the survey crew was conducted, and
recommendations were made regarding future archaeological work involving these
tracts should this be required. All areas recommended for future work are discussed in
the Recommendations section below.
Soil descriptions were taken from Soil Conservation Service (SCS) soil survey
published for the area (Neitsch 1994). This office is now referred to as the United
States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service. Field notes
were taken by the Principal Investigator and Project Archaeologist.
Prehistoric site 41MA26 was discovered when a chert flake was found on the
surface in an exposed area created by a collapsed tree. Shovel testing revealed buried
cultural materials in the form of lithic debitage (flakes). Once an archaeological site was
confirmed, additional tests were excavated to determine site depth and size within the
ROW. Six tests (22-27) were dug in the site area. Additional tests to determine the
extent of this site were not necessary because of the following limitations: the survey
was restricted on three sides by the existing highway and ditch, the proposed ROW,
and private property for which permission to enter had not been granted. On the fourth
side (to the southwest), the landform slopes to the floodplain of Iron Creek. One shovel
test on this slope (27) did not yield any cultural materials. A sketch map utilizing a
compass and metric tape was made of the site in the field; it was later professionally
drafted for this report (Figure 2). The location of 41MA26 is depicted on the topographic
quadrangle Madisonville in Appendix I.
Numerous houses and other buildings are located along the ROW. As per a
previous agreement, these extant structures will be evaluated by the architectural firm
Hardy, Heck, Meyers & Moore, Inc. Therefore, they were not examined by the field
survey crew. No historic sites other than standing structures were observed.
All artifacts collected from 41MA26 were examined by William A. Dickens under
a 40 to 70 x microscope. Specimens were examined for platform preparation, use
wear, flake type, and manufacturing stage. Some conclusions regarding the kinds of
activities carried out at this site were hypothesized (see Results and Conclusions
below).

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
One archaeological site was found within the ROW and is described in this report
as a prehistoric campsite. Site 41MA26 is located on a sandy terrace above the
floodplain of Iron Creek on the east bank. It is located in Boonville fine sandy loam, 1 to
3 percent slopes (BoB) as defined in the soil survey for Madison County (Neitsch
1994:21, Sheet 20). This is a very deep, very gently sloping upland soil generally found
on lower, slightly concave side slopes or in broad, low, smooth areas. Typically, the
surface layer is a slightly acid, very dark grayish-brown fine sandy loam (about 15
inches thick) over a subsoil of medium acid, dark gray clay. Since no diagnostic artifacts
were recovered, the age of 41MA26 is not known. Some inferences, however, can be
made based on the analysis of the sample of lithic debitage collected at this site. In all,
26 flakes were collected from the surface (n=1) and in five shovel tests (n=25). The
debitage was analyzed by size grading, and each flake was tabulated for a number of
attributes such as striking platform, bulb of percussion, termination, completeness, and
raw material, as well as an indication of other damage such as burning or heat treating.
These tabulations were studied in order to determine the kinds of cultural activities
represented by this cultural debris.
This study found that the flakes were uniformly small. Three flakes were
measured as size grade 5 (1/2 inch), 8 flakes are size grade 6 (3/8 inch), 7 flakes are
size grade 7 (1/4 inch), and 8 flakes are size grade 8 (less than 1/4 inch). All of the
flakes present in this sample are interior flakes (those having no cortex on their dorsal
surface) except two that are secondary (those with a small amount of cortex present).
All striking platforms are natural (cortex covered) or plain (no cortex present), and one
was abraded (ground). The bulbs of percussion were all diffuse or almost flat. Some
cortex was noted on several (n=2) lateral edges and platforms. Flake termination was
present in the form of feathering (indicating late stage manufacturing) and step fractures
(middle stage manufacturing). In terms of completeness of flakes, most were broken
with a large percentage of distal ends present. Types of raw material represented in the
sample include chert (probably from gravels), red jasper, opalized wood, silicified wood,
and quartzite, all typical locally obtainable materials. The variety of raw material seems
to suggest that they were collected from different areas and probably at different times.
This could indicate that a number of knapping episodes had been performed.
Data obtained from the lithic debitage indicate that secondary reduction or tool
maintenance activities were major activities conducted at this site. Without diagnostic
artifacts, however, the exact type of reduction cannot be determined with any degree of
certainty. Several of the flakes do contain some amount of cortex on their lateral edge
or on their platforms. This suggests that reduction was being performed on late early or
middle stage bifaces. Gravel reduction requires that width be retained as long as
possible due to the limiting size of gravels. The hard cortex of gravel is not considered
an impediment to reduction; therefore, the lateral edges will often retain some cortex
until the final stages. In summary, the artifacts recovered from the five shovel tests
indicate that early, middle, and late stage reduction took place as well as tool
rejuvenation. Not one of the flakes was altered by heat prior to detachment.

Summary of Areas Surveyed
It should be repeated here that all areas for which permission was granted were
evaluated at some level during this survey. A brief summary of the level of work for
each area is presented below. The areas surveyed are depicted on the topographic
maps in Appendix I.
Area A
This upland area on the south side of the highway is one of the two shortest
segments in the project area at 450 feet. At the time of the survey it was observed that
the area had been completely disturbed by a borrow ditch. No shovel tests were
excavated.
Area B
This is an upland area on the north side of the highway with a length of 3540
feet. It overlooks Foards Branch, one of the major streams in the ROW, on both banks.
The west bank appeared to be the most probable location for a prehistoric site. One
shovel test (19) was excavated on the east bank of the creek. It proved to be shallow
with yellow clay present at 25 cm. Shovel probes in the area confirmed the continuation
of shallow soils. Two shovel tests (20-21) were dug on the west bank of the creek.
They revealed a shallow fine sandy loam overlying yellow clay at 30 and 60 cm. No
cultural materials were recovered, and no additional work was conducted. No backhoe
trenches were excavated, as it was too wet.
Area C
Area C consists of uplands on the north side of the highway overlooking the west
bank of an unnamed creek and continuing past the creek to the east (total length 3500
feet). Three tests (16-18) were excavated on the west bank and revealed a shallow fine
sandy loam overlying red clay at 20 and 25 cm. Shovel probes in the area confirmed
the continuation of shallow soils. No cultural materials were found, and no additional
work was conducted.
Area D
Area D consists of uplands (3080 feet) on the south side of the highway
overlooking both sides of an unnamed creek or tributary. One test (3) was dug at the
east bank and revealed a shallow fine sandy loam overlying gray clay at 20 cm. Shovel
probes in the area confirmed the continuation of shallow soils. Three tests (4-6) on the
west bank revealed a shallow fine sandy loam overlying gray clay at 20 and 30 cm.
Additional shovel probes confirmed the continuation of shallow soils. No cultural
materials were found, and no additional work was conducted.

9

Area E
Area E consists of the shortest segment in the project area at 320 feet. It is an
upland area on the south side of the highway with no major creek crossing. It was
investigated by a walkover with no shovel tests. No surface evidence of a site was
seen.
Area F
Area F consists of an upland area (1500 feet) with no major creek crossing. It
was investigated by a walkover with no shovel tests. No surface evidence of a site was
seen.
Area G
Area G consists of an upland area on the north side of the highway (1220 feet)
with no major creek crossing. Two tests (1-2) were dug on the east bank of a small
creek and revealed the presence of a shallow fine sandy loam overlying red clay at 10
and 20 cm. Shovel probes confirmed the continuation of shallow soils in the area. No
cultural materials were found, and no additional work was conducted.
Area H
Area H consists of a small upland area (700 feet) on the north side of the
highway with no major creek crossing. It was investigated by a walkover with no shovel
tests. No surface evidence of a site was seen.
Area I
Area I is the longest segment in the project area at 4600 feet. It consists of a
lengthy upland area on the north side of the highway with a major creek crossing (Iron
Creek). The upland area was investigated by a walkover, and no surface evidence of a
historic site was seen. The east bank of Iron Creek was shovel tested, and a prehistoric
site (41MA26) was found. Six shovel tests (22-27) were excavated, and cultural
materials (flakes) were found in five tests. Modern glass was found in two of the tests
mixed with the flakes. No features, burned rock, or diagnostic artifacts were recovered.
The depth of the site varied from 30 - 90 cm. All tests were dug to yellow clay.
On the west bank of the creek four tests (9-12) were excavated. These tests
revealed the presence of a shallow fine sandy loam overlying yellow clay at 15-30 cm.
Additional probes confirmed the continuation of shallow soils in the area. No artifacts
were found, and no additional work was conducted.

10

On the west bank of a tributary of Iron Creek three shovel tests (13-15) were
excavated. They revealed the presence of a shallow fine sandy loam overlying yellow
clay at 15-30 cm. No cultural materials were found, and no additional work was
conducted. Shovel probes in the area confirmed the continuation of shallow soils in the
area. No cultural materials were found, and no additional work was conducted. It was
too wet to utilize a backhoe. It is recommended that this be done when conditions are
favorable.
Area J
Area J consists of a small upland area (1200 feet) on the north side of the
highway with no major creek crossing. It was investigated by a walkover with no shovel
tests. No surface evidence of a site was seen.
Area K
Area K is the second longest segment in the project area at 4300 feet. It consists
of an upland area on the north side of the highway with no major creek crossing. It was
investigated by a walkover with no shovel tests. No surface evidence of a site was
seen.
Area L
Area L (1700 feet) consists of uplands on the south side of the highway
overlooking both banks of a small creek. One shovel test (7) was dug on the west side
and revealed the presence of a shallow fine sandy loam overlying red clay at 20 cm.
Shovel probes confirmed the continuation of shallow soils. No artifacts were recovered,
and no additional work was conducted. One shovel test (8) was dug on the east side
and revealed the presence of a shallow fine sandy loam overlying red clay at 30 cm.
Shovel probes confirmed the continuation of shallow soils. No artifacts were recovered,
and no additional work was conducted.
Review
The vast majority of ROW consists of featureless uplands between streams,
viewed as low probability areas for prehistoric sites. The two major stream crossings
(Foards Branch and Iron Creek) were considered by the survey team as high probability
areas. Foards Branch (Area B), as evidenced by shovel tests and probes, revealed a
rather shallow soil (15-30 cm) on the west bank and disturbed soils on the east bank. It
was hypothesized that more suitable locations for sites are probably present in other
areas along this stream. Iron Creek (Area I), with a confluence of this stream and a
major tributary as well as the major drainage close to the ROW, was viewed as the
highest probability area in the project area. Therefore, it received the most attention (12
shovel tests). On the west bank the soils were uniformly shallow (15-30 cm), while on
the east bank they were deeper, and a prehistoric site was found.

11

The absence of sites in other areas along the ROW is probably explained by
shallow soils and the presence of minor stream crossings, such as tributaries of streams
and lower reaches or terminal ends of streams, also considered low probability areas for
prehistoric sites.

12

RECOMMENDATIONS
Surveyed Area
As a result of this investigation, it is recommended that construction be allowed
to proceed as planned in those areas investigated during this study except in the area of
site 41MA26 until the remainder of the site area can be properly evaluated and at two
floodplain areas not examined by the field survey crew because of wet conditions.
Although site 41MA26 contains a fairly significant number of flakes, the apparent
absence of diagnostic artifacts and intact features suggests that this is a site that may
have been occupied on a temporary or periodic basis. If this proves to be true,
additional testing will probably result in a return of more of the same; that is, additional
flakes and perhaps some formal tools. It is important to state here that modern beer
bottle glass was found in the first 30 cm of the site mixed with prehistoric cultural
materials, and additional disturbance was probably caused by the construction of the
stock pens to the northwest and vehicle traffic that has driven across the site. In a
recent conversation with the landowner (Shannon Sweatt, personal communication,
June 13, 2001) it was learned that the previous owner had dug in this site as a collector.
It is not likely that Phase II testing in the area already examined will provide new or
significant data for this region of Texas. This site may extend to the east on land for
which permission to survey was denied. If access to this tract is granted it is
recommended that additional shovel tests be excavated in order to help determine the
research potential of archaeological site 41MA26.
Areas Not Surveyed
There are, however, areas that were not available to the field survey crew, and
backhoe trenching was not possible in the floodplains of the major creeks investigated
due to muddy conditions and standing water. Two levels of effort are recommended for
the remainder of the project area. These are backhoe trenching at the two major creek
crossings (Foards Branch and Iron Creek) and a 100% pedestrian survey of the
remainder of the unsurveyed area that is considered to be low probability based on the
results of similar areas surveyed during this investigation. It is recommended that these
areas be examined by the field survey crew by a "walkover" designed to locate surface
indications of historic sites not associated with standing structures. Shovel tests are not
recommended in these areas unless there is an indication of a historic site. As stated
above, additional shovel tests need to be excavated in the area of site 41MA26 on land
owned by Wallace Osborne. These tests should be dug by levels and should clearly
define the site limits to the east. Backhoe trenching at the two floodplains is
recommended for the following:
The floodplain on the west Bank of Foards Branch on property owned by W. R.
Coffey. The uplands were investigated through shovel testing. However, it was too wet
to consider a backhoe at the time of the survey. It is recommended that two trenches
be excavated in the floodplain of this stream.

13

The floodplain on the west bank of Iron Creek just below site 41MA26 on
property owned by James and Shannon Sweatt of Madisonville, Texas. Site 41MA26 is
located at the confluence of Iron Creek and one of its tributaries. It is recommended
that two trenches be excavated in the floodplain of this stream.
It is always possible that cultural materials are missed during any cultural
resources survey. Should additional areas containing prehistoric or historic artifacts not
discussed in this report be discovered during construction, the Archeology Division,
Texas Historical Commission must be notified immediately and work stopped until the
situation can be evaluated.
