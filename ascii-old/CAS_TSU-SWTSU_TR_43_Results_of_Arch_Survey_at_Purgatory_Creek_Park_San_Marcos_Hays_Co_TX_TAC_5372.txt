Abstract
In October and November of 2009, the Center for Archaeological Studies at Texas State UniversitySan Marcos performed an intensive archaeological survey of the 487-acre Purgatory Creek Park (Park),
in San Marcos, south-central Hays County, on behalf of the City of San Marcos (City). The City has
acquired this acreage with the intent of leaving it as green space but developing it as a park with hiking
and off-road biking trails. This undertaking will have a direct negative impact in cases where trails
are installed or maintained through site boundaries, and also a potential indirect impact as park-users
leave marked trails and encounter archaeological materials. Because the project is an undertaking of
the City, it falls under the jurisdiction of the Texas Antiquities Code and requires an archaeological
survey. This survey was performed under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 5372, granted to Jon C.
Lohse. Field work was conducted by David M. Yelacic, who served as Project Archaeologist, Amy
Benton, and Joshua Hamilton.
The intensive archaeological survey consisted of pedestrian coverage and careful ground inspection
of the entire park area, as well as the excavation of 153 shovel tests within the Park. As a result of
survey, 14 previously unrecorded archaeological sites were documented and one previously known
site, 41HY72 and was revisited. Sites 41HY452, 41HY453, 41HY454, 41HY455, 41HY456, 41HY458,
41HY459, and 41HY460 are thin prehistoric lithic scatters located in the upland portions of Purgatory
Creek Park. CAS recommends that these sites are not eligible for NRHP listing or SAL designation,
and also that no further investigations are necessary.
Sites 41HY463, 464, and 465 are also prehistoric lithic scatters, but they represent locales
where raw lithic materials were directly procured. These three sites are clustered in the west-central
portion of the park along an unnamed tributary of Purgatory Creek. Sites 41HY463 and 41HY464 are
recommended not to be eligible for NRHP listing or SAL designation, whereas the NRHP and SAL
eligibility of 41HY465 is recommended to be unknown. At all three sites, CAS recommends that no
further investigations are necessary.
Site 41HY462, which contains prehistoric and historic components, is a rock shelter located on
Purgatory Creek in the southern portion of the Park. Prehistoric occupation of the geological feature is
indicated by the presence of lithic debitage recovered from below the surface by shovel tests excavated
in the shelter. Historical visitations at the site are apparent by the presence of graffiti, which identifies
the names of some individuals and the dates of their visits. Site 41HY462’s eligibility for NRHP listing
and SAL designation is unknown. This shelter is an impressive natural feature within the Park, and
foot trails currently lead to the site. Because this site has strong potential to contain intact buried
deposits, and because it will receive a high volume of foot and bike traffic, CAS recommends that the
City develop specific plans to protect the site from damage. If the site can not be effectively protected,
additional excavations should be conducted in order to determine the NRHP eligibility and SAL
worthiness of the site. If found to be significant and if protection measures are not effective, practical,
or desired, CAS recommends that the City consult with the Texas Historical Commission to develop
plans for data recovery from this site.
iii

Sites 41HY457 and 41HY461 are historical sites identified within the Park. Both are accumulations
of historic debris. CAS recommends that neither site is eligible for NRHP listing or SAL designation,
and also that no further investigations at these sites are necessary.
Site 41HY72 is a prehistoric lithic scatter that was initially recorded in 1974. At that time, the
archaeologists recommended that no further investigations were necessary. CAS agrees with the initial
recommendation, and recommends that the site is not eligible for NRHP listing or SAL designation and
need not be further investigated.
CAS also recommends that the City offer measures of protection for all of the archaeological
sites within the Park. In the event that no protection can be or is offered to any one of the sites, it is
recommended that further work is necessary to offset the loss of data.

Introduction

of the Texas Antiquities Code (TAC). The TAC
requires that such an undertaking consider
the potential impact on any cultural resources
that might be present and that might contribute
information that is meaningful or significant to
understanding the history and/or prehistory of
the State of Texas. All archaeological work was
performed under auspices of Texas Antiquities
Permit Number 5372, granted to Jon C. Lohse,
Director of CAS.

This report presents the results of an intensive
and systematic archaeological survey of the 487acre Purgatory Creek Park performed by the
Center for Archaeological Studies (CAS) on behalf
of the City of San Marcos (City), Hays County,
Texas. Purgatory Creek Park (Park) is an existing
City park located in west San Marcos, along
the Purgatory Creek drainage and immediately
adjacent to the Wonder World Drive Extension,
currently under construction (Figure 1). The
objective of this project is to
compile an inventory of historic
and/or prehistoric archaeological
sites located in the Park so that
the City can effectively manage
these cultural resources and
monitor disturbances resulting
as park-goers visit the Park.
Indirect impacts have arisen
due to the increase in pedestrian
traffic resulting from public use
of the park as a recreational
facility--park-goers occasionally
wander off the trails and disturb
cultural resources that are
present. Additionally, possible
direct impacts may result from
the installation of a formal trail
system. As a result of these
impacts, an archaeological
survey of the entire 487-acre
Park is necessary. An inventory
describing the location and
current condition of sites will
assist the City in managing and
protecting these resources.
As a political subdivision of
the State of Texas, development
of property by the City of San
Marcos falls under the purview

maps (San Marcos North/South) and within the counties of Texas.

Cultural resources located on land owned or
controlled by the State of Texas, or its political
subdivisions, are protected by the TAC (Texas
Natural Resources Code, Title 9, Chapter
191), which identifies significant sites as State
Archaeological Landmarks (SALs). Rules of
Practice and Procedure for the Antiquities Code
of Texas (Chapter 26), as defined by the Texas
Historical Commission (THC), are explicit about
perception and protection of cultural resources
located on State owned or controlled land:

thereby supporting the research potential or
preservation interests of the site;
(3) the site possesses unique or rare attributes
concerning Texas prehistory and/or history;
(4) the study of the site offers the opportunity to
test theories and methods of preservation, thereby
contributing to new scientific knowledge;
(5) the high likelihood that vandalism and
relic collecting has occurred or could occur, and
official landmark designation is needed to insure
maximum legal protection, or alternatively
further investigation are needed to mitigate the
effects of vandalism and relic collecting when
the site cannot be protected.

. . . archeological sites and historic
structures on lands belonging to state agencies
or political subdivisions of the State of Texas
are State Archeological Landmarks or may be
eligible to be designated as landmarks. . . . The
State of Texas considers that all publicly owned
archeological sites and historic structures have
some intrinsic historic value, and the Antiquities
Code provides some level of protection for those
sites… regardless of their size, character, or
ability to currently yield data that will contribute
important information on the history or prehistory
of Texas. . . . (26.2).

Under formatting standards set forth by
the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) and
adopted by the THC, this report provides a brief
overview of the regulatory requirements for this
project (above), defines the project area setting,
describes the methods used in gathering data, and
presents the results of the survey. The fieldwork
for this project was performed by the authors,
Amy Benton, and Josh Hamilton.

As all cultural resources located in, on,
or under State owned or controlled land are
considered SALs, and not all cultural resources
are appropriately designated as such or directly
threatened by development, the THC has criteria
for practically assessing the significance and/or
need for further investigations under the permit
process (Rules and Practice, Chapter 26.8):

Project Area Setting
The project area is located in the western
portion of the City of San Marcos, Hays County,
Texas (see Figure 1). Purgatory Creek Park is
above the Balcones Escarpment in southeastCentral Texas. The Balcones Escarpment marks
a transition between the Blackland Prairie
environment to the east and the Edwards Plateau,
or Hill Country, environment to the west.
Ecotones, or transitional zones between adjoining
environmental provinces, are high-energy
settings capable of supporting richly diverse flora

(1) the site has the potential to contribute
to a better understanding of the prehistory and/
or history of Texas by the addition of new and
important information;
(2) the site’s archeological deposits and the
artifacts within the site are preserved and intact,

and fauna (Crumley 1994). Abundant in natural
resources, these regions are also likely areas for
historic and prehistoric human occupation. Brief
descriptions are presented of the project area in
terms of geology and soils, climate and weather,
and flora and fauna and are followed by a brief
review of the cultural history of the region, and
then by previous archaeological investigations in
the vicinity the Park.

layer of about 12 to 17 cm (six to seven inches)
in thickness overlying a subsoil to a depth of
approximately 30 cm (12 inches). The outcropped
rock is generally dolomitic limestone, barren of
soil except in narrow fissures and fractures in the
exposed rock. Composing RUD, Rumple soils
are found on broad ridgetops and side slopes, and
Comfort soil is primarily found in more sloping
locations near drainages and bedrock outcrops.
Rumple soil has a surface layer approaching 25
cm (10 inches) in thickness composed of reddish
brown cherty clay loam, an intermediate subsoil
of dark reddish brown cherty clay reaching 36 cm
(14 inches) in thickness, and a bottom subsoil of
about 36 cm (14 inches) in thickness composed of
dark reddish brown extremely stony clay. Comfort
soils is typically composed of a surface layer of
about 18 cm (7 inches) in thickness consisting of
dark brown extremely stony clay, and a subsoil
consisting of dark reddish brown extremely
stony clay reaching a thickness of 31 cm (12
inches). TaB is situated in genly sloping areas
on uplands of the Edwards Plateau. The surface
layer of TaB is generally dark brown clay nearing
16 cm (6 inches) in thickness, and subsoils are
approximately 43 cm (17 inches) thick and consist
of dark reddish brown clay.

Geology and Soils
Underlying bedrock in the vicinity of
the project area is Edwards Limestone (Ked)
(Bureau of Economic Geology, Seguin Sheet,
1974). Edwards Limestone covers a great area of
Texas, however, in the project area, it approaches
400 feet in thickness and ranges from massive to
thinly bedded nearly-pure calcareous to dolomitic
deposits with cherty nodules and thin cherty
strata (Sellards et al. 1932).
Soils of this area are described by Batte
(1984). Because the project area includes upland,
sloping areas as well as low-lying areas, soils
range from shallow and virtually non-existent to
moderately deep, dependent upon relief. Mapped
soil units include Orif soils, frequently flooded
(Or); Comfor-Rock outcrop complex, undulating
(CrD); Rumple-Comfort association, undulating
(RUD); and Tarpley clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes
(TaB). Or soils are found on flood plains and are
typically deep and well-drained. Generally, the
surface layer of Or is grayish brown gravelly
loamy sands extending as deep as 50 cm (20
inches), and the subsoil is characterized as
gravelly sandy loam interbedded with loam, very
gravelly sandy loam, and gravelly sand up to 155
cm (60 inches). CrD is found on the tops of hilly
areas and consists of shallow, clayey soils and
rock outcrops. The soils associated with CrD is
typically dark brown with a stony clay surface

Climate and Weather
Based on a thirty-year record (1951-1980),
summers have mean maximum temperatures
approaching 97° F, and winters have mean
minimum temperatures near 40° F in Hays
County (Bomar 1983). December and January
are the only two months on record that have not
had temperatures above 90° F, while freezing
temperatures have been recorded between
October and April. The mean annual precipitation
recorded for Hays County is 33.75 inches.
Precipitation in the county is bimodal, with most
precipitation occurring in the late spring and in

Cultural History

the early fall (Dixon 200; Tyler 1996). Weather
in southeast-Central Texas is dynamic and often
marked by severe events. Hazardous weather is
not uncommon in the region. The Hill Country,
in general, has a serious threat of flash floods due
to thin soils and steep slopes. Cloud bursts may
unload a relatively high amount of precipitation
on a confined area in a short period of time,
resulting in the area’s tributaries and river levels
to rise rapidly (Woodruff 1979). At the other end
of the spectrum, drought is also a common feature
of Central Texas weather; there is not a decade
in the twentieth century that did not experience
drought conditions (Bomar 1983:153).

Overall, Central Texas is known for its rich
and diverse archaeological resources, especially
in river valleys such as the San Marcos River
(Collins 2004). Archaeological deposits
from Central and South indicate rich cultural
development spanning several millennia. Black
(1995), Hester (1995, 2004), and Collins (1995,
2004) have recently synthesized available
archaeological evidence from the region. All
dates are in the radiocarbon time scale and given
as years before present (BP, i.e. before 1950).
Human presence is divided into three periods:
Prehistoric, Protohistoric and Historic.

Prehistoric

Flora and Fauna

The Prehistoric period is divided into three
major temporal stages, the Paleoindian, Archaic
and Late Prehistoric. The Paleoindian stage
begins with the earliest known human occupation
of North America and extends to approximately
8800 BP. The Archaic stage follows, extending
from ca. 8800 BP to 1250 BP. The Late Prehistoric
stage begins ca. 1250 BP and is characterized by
the development of bow and arrow and ceramic
technologies.

Floral and faunal characteristics of both the
Edwards Plateau and the Blackland Prairie are
present in the project area. The region’s natural
vegetation is generally a grassland-woodlandshrubland mosaic, where grasslands separate
patches of woody plants and scrubs (Ellis et al.
1995). Mesquite, post oak, and blackjack oak
interrupt grasslands composed of little and big
bluestem, Indiangrass, switch grass, sideoats
grama, hairy grama, tall dropseed, silver
bluestem and Texas wintergrass on the Blackland
Prairie, and live oak, shinnery oak, junipers,
and mesquite compose the overstory while
switchgrass, bluestems, gramas, Indiangrass,
wildrye, curly mesquite, and buffalograss make
up the understory on the Edwards Plateau (Gould
1962). As Described by Blair (1950), typical
modern fauna of the region include white-tailed
deer, eastern cottontail, raccoon, opossum, and
badger as well as myriad other species.

Paleoindian
Collins (1995:381–385, 2004) dates the
Paleoindian period in Central Texas to 11,5008800 BP; we divide the Paleoindian into Early
(11,500-ca. 10,200 BP) and Late (~10,200-8800
BP) phases. Early Paleoindian artifacts are
associated with the Clovis and Folsom cultures
and diagnostic items include fluted, lanceolate
projectile points. Clovis is also characterized by
well-made prismatic blades (Collins 1995; Green
1964). The Early Paleoindian stage is generally
characterized by nomadic cultures that relied
heavily on hunting large game animals (Black
1989); however, recent research suggests that
early Paleoindian subsistence patterns were
4

considerably more diverse than previously
thought, and included reliance on local fauna
including turtles (Black 1989; Bousman et al.
2004; Collins and Brown 2000; Hester 1983;
Lemke and Timperley 2008). Folsom cultures are
considered to be specialized bison hunters.

technologies and diet is most likely merely a
reflection of preservation bias.

Early Archaic
While Collins (1995:383, 2004) argues
that the Early Archaic spans from 8800 to
6000 BP based on three divisions of projectile
point types, the current project considers the
Early Archaic to extend from 8800 to 5800 BP.
Changes in lithic technology, such as notched
projectile points and specialized tools (e.g.
Clear Fork and Guadalupe bifaces), as well
as a dietary adjustment, as evidenced by the
increased number of ground stone artifacts and
rock cooking features, distinguish this cultural
period from previous ones (Collins 1995; Turner
and Hester 1993:246–256). A variable climate
and concomitant variation in game resources
(i.e. bison, Dillehay 1974) are strongly related to
shift in subsistence, and Collins (1995) suggests
that Early Archaic peoples occupied the wetter
portions of the Edwards Plateau. Early Archaic
sites are thinly dispersed and are seen across a
wide area of Texas and northern Mexico (Weir
1976). Johnson (1991) notes a concentration of
Early Archaic components along the southeastern
margins of the Edwards Plateau, close to major
spring localities such as in San Marcos.

The Late Paleoindian stage occurs from
ca.10,200-8800 BP. Reliable evidence for these
dates was recovered from the Wilson-Leonard
site, in Williamson County (Bousman et al. 2004;
Collins 1998). At Wilson-Leonard, archaeologists
excavated an occupation known as Wilson, named
for the unique corner-notched projectile point.
The dense occupation also included a human
burial (Bousman et al. 2004; Collins 1998). In
addition to the Wilson occupation, GolondrinaBarber and St. Mary’s Hall components, dating
between 9500 and 8800 BP, were excavated.
Collins (1995) suggests these components are
transitional between the Paleoindian and Archaic
Periods due to notched projectile points and
burned-rock cooking features.

Archaic
Collins (1995, 2004) contends the Archaic
stage in Central Texas lasted approximately 7500
years, from 8800-1200/1300 BP, and divides the
stage into Early, Middle and Late Archaic based
on Weir’s (1976) chronology. The Archaic stage
marks several important transitions: shifting
hunting foci from Pleistocene megafauna to
smaller animals; the increased use of plant
food resources and use of ground stones in
food processing; increased implementation of
stone cooking technology; increased use of
organic materials for tool manufacturing and
an increase in the number and variety of lithic
tools for wood working; the predominance of
corner- and side-notch projectile points; greater
population stability and less residential mobility;
and systematic burial of the dead. What appears
as a new emphasis on organic materials in tool

Middle Archaic
The Middle Archaic, ca. 5800-4000 BP,
is approximately marked by the onset of the
Altithermal. Climate fluctuated from arid to
mesic to back to arid in Central Texas during
this period. Vegetation and wildlife regimes all
responded to these environmental oscillations,
as did human groups. Collins (1995) divides the
Middle Archaic period by projectile point style
intervals: Bell-Andice-Calf Creek, Taylor, and
Nolan and Travis. The Bell-Andice-Calf Creek
(Calf Creek) interval was a mesic period when
grasslands, attractive to bison herds, expanded
southwards into Central and South Texas. Calf
5

Creek peoples, as evidenced by hunting-based
lithic technology, were specialized bison hunters
who followed the herds southwards (Johnson
and Goode 1994). As climate shifted from mesic
to arid, both bison and bison hunters retreated
northwards. During this transitional period,
Taylor bifaces were manufactured. Later in the
Middle Archaic, Taylor bifaces were replaced
by Nolan and Travis points (Collins 1995, 2004).
The Nolan-Travis interval was a period when
temperature and aridity were at their greatest
levels. Prehistoric inhabitants acclimated to peak
aridity as seen through increased utilization of
xerophytes such as sotol (Johnson and Goode
1994). These plants were typically baked in earth
ovens and reflected the development of burned
rock middens. During more arid episodes,
the aquifer-fed streams and resource-rich
environments of Central Texas were extensively
utilized (Story 1985:40; Weir 1976:125, 128).

were becoming territorial (Story 1985:44–45);
however, some other archaeologists challenge the
interpretation of a growing population by citing
a decrease in burned rock middens (Prewitt
1981:80–81).

Late Prehistoric
Collins (1995, 2004) dates the Late Prehistoric
in Central Texas at 1,300/1,200–260 BP, and
follows Kelley (1947) in dividing it into Austin
and Toyah phases. The current project delimits the
Austin phase to 1250-750 BP and the Toyah phase
to 750-300 BP. The most distinctive changes in
relation to previous eras include a technological
shift away from the dart and atlatl to the bow
and arrow, and the approximately concurrent
incorporation of pottery (Black 1989:32; Story
1985:45–47).

Austin Phase
The Austin phase is characterized primarily
by the appearance of arrow points, including
Scallorn and Edwards types. Evidence for
increasing social strife, if not overall populations,
is seen multiple burials from Central Texas that
date to this period. Burials from this time reveal
numerous incidents of arrow-wound deaths,
suggesting that population growth resulted in
disputes over limited resource availability (Black
1989; Meissner 1991; Prewitt 1974). Burned rock
middens are occasionally found with these types
of points (Houk and Lohse 1993), and ground
and pecked stone tools, used for plant food
processing, become increasingly common in the
Austin phase.

Late Archaic
The Central Texas Late Archaic dates to
approximately 4000-1250 BP (Collins 1995:384,
2004). The Late Archaic, according to Johnson
and Goode (1994), is marked by two significant
cultural traits: 1) the billet thinning of bifacial
knives and projectile points leapt forward in
terms of artistry and technology, and 2) the
human population appears to have increased.
These patterns vary considerably through time
and from one sub-region to another across Central
Texas, but strongly shape the archaeological
record of the Late Archaic. Overall, evidence
suggests an increasingly mesic climate through
the Late Archaic (Collins 1995; Johnson and
Goode 1994; Mauldin et al. 2010). Mauldin et al.
(2010) suggest that climatic variation resulted in a
general decrease in grassland bison range. Some
archaeologists note the presence of cemeteries
at sites such as Ernest Witte (Hall 1981) and
Olmos Dam (Lukowski 1988) as evidence that
populations indeed increased and that groups

Toyah Phase
The beginning of the Toyah phase (750 BP)
in Central Texas is characterized by contracting
stem points with flaring, barbed shoulders, a style
known as Perdiz; by the common occurrence of
blade technology that is considered to be part of
a specialized Toyah bison hunting and processing
6

toolkit (Black and McGraw 1985; Huebner 1991;
Ricklis 1994); and by the appearance of bonetempered pottery in Central Texas (Johnson
1994:241–281). The wide variety of ceramic
styles and influences seen throughout Toyah
phase ceramic assemblages provide important
information concerning the social composition of
these cultural groups (Arnn 2005). Toyah ceramic
assemblages display Caddo, Texas Gulf Coast,
and Jornada Mogollon influences (Arnn 2005). In
addition to shifts in material technology, Mauldin
et al. (2010) suggest that bison herds foraged
across increasingly widespread ranges, at least
partly in response to climatic patterns described
above. They conclude that this change in bison
herd behavior is partly responsible for what they
identify as a change in Toyah hunting strategy,
involving increasingly logistically-organized
hunting forays in pursuit of spatially dispersed
herds. Based on the ratio of zooarchaeological
to archaebotanical data associated with types
of sites (e.g. bulk plant processing, bulk meat
processing, residential), Dering (2008) provides
further evidence of Toyah phase logisticallyoriented subsistence strategies and broad diet
breadths. Included with logistical subsistence
strategies was what appears to be either trade for
horticultural products not produced in Central
Texas, or of low instensity, localized horticultural
practices. Both scenarios involve maize, which
is exceedingly uncommon in Toyah-period
archaeological contexts in Central Texas but which
has been reported from at least three locales, the
Kyle Rockshelter (41HI1) in Hill County (Jelks
1962), Bear Branch (41CA13) in Callahan County
(Adams 2002), and the Timmeron Rockshleter
(41HY95) in Hays County (Harris 1985).

established forts and missions in Northern Mexico
into Central, Coastal, and East Texas in the late
seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries.
These encounters began with the venture into
Texas by the Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca
and the Narvaez expedition in 1528. The period
is generally dated between 1500 and 1700 (or
1528, the date of the Cabeza de Vaca/Narvaez
expedition, to the establishment of the first
Spanish mission, Mission San Antonio de Valero
in 1718).
With Alonso de León’s expedition of 1680, El
Camino Real (the King’s Road) was established
from Villa Santiago de la Monclova in Mexico
to East Texas. This roadway followed established
Native American trade routes and trails and
became a vital link between Mission San Juan
Bautista in Northern Mexico and the Spanish
settlement of Los Adaes in East Texas (McGraw
et al. 1991).
Spanish priests accompanying entradas
provided the most complete information of
indigenous cultures of early Texas. Those
documented during the early entradas include the
Cantona, Muruam, Payaya, Sana, and Yojuane,
who were settled around the springs at San Marcos
and described as semi-nomadic bands. Other
tribes encountered at San Marcos included mobile
hunting parties from villages in South and West
Texas, such as Catequeza, Cayanaaya, Chalome,
Cibolo, and Jumano, who were heading for bison
hunting grounds in the Blackland Prairies (Foster
1995:265–289; Johnson and Campbell 1992;
Newcomb 1993). Later groups migrated into the
region and displaced the former groups or tribes.
These included the Tonkawa from Oklahoma and
Lipan and Comanche from the Plains (Campbell
and Campbell 1985; Dunn 1911; Newcomb 1961,
1993).

Protohistoric (Spanish Entrada
Period)
In Texas, the Protohistoric period, also known
as the Spanish Entrada period, was marked by
Spanish entradas, the formal expeditions from

Previously Identified Cultural
Resources

Archaeological sites dated to this period
often contain a mix of both European imported
goods, such as metal objects and glass beads, and
traditional Native American artifacts, such as
manufactured stone tools.

Only one previously identified archaeological
site exists within the Park, 41HY72. Site 41HY72
is located adjacent to an intermittently flowing
tributary of Purgatory Creek on a gentle slope
in the eastern portion of the Park. The site was
initially discovered and recorded in 1974 as a
lithic resource procurement locale, and at the
time, 41HY72 consisted of a concentration of
chert cobbles, both nodular and tabular, and
numerous cores, flakes, partially worked bifaces,
and performs. The site contained evidence of
disturbance by fluvial erosion, and no further
investigations were recommended (Patterson
and Ivey 1974).

Historic
Spanish settlement in Central Texas first
occurred in San Antonio with the establishment
of Mission San Antonio de Valero (the Alamo)
in 1718, and the later founding of San Antonio
de Béxar (Bolton 1970; Habig 1977; de la Teja
1995). Some researchers demarcate the transition
in Texas between the Entrada (Protohistoric) and
Historic periods by the construction of the first
Spanish missions in Texas. Most knowledge of
this period is gained through the written records
of the early Spanish missionaries. Besides the
mission town of San Antonio, the only other
Spanish settlement in the region was San Marcos
de Neve, established in 1808, four miles south of
present day San Marcos. San Marcos de Neve was
abandoned in 1812 as a result of constant raids
by local tribes (Dobie 1932). During this time,
massive depopulation occurred among the Native
Americans, mostly due to European diseases to
which the indigenous people had little resistance.
Those few indigenous people remaining were
nearly all displaced to reservations by the mid1850s (Fisher 1998).

In addition to 41HY72, at least four other sites,
41HY333, 41HY386, 41HY387, and 41HY388,
are present immediately adjacent to the Park
(Jones and Hail 2002; Nickels and Payton 2005).
Site 41HY333 is a shallow rock shelter that was
recorded during a Texas State University field
school in 2002. This shelter, at the time it was
recorded, was believed to contain at least some
intact deposits beneath a layer of fallen rock that
had collapsed from the limestone overhang. Areas
within the shelter that were not protected by the
roof-fall had been extensively looted, attesting to
the probability that additional deposits remain.
Rock shelters such as these afford better than
average preservation conditions for organic and
other remains, and it was suggested that this
site may be eligible for listing to the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and worth of
designation as a State Archeological Landmark
(SAL).

European presence in the region increased
as settlers received land grants from the Mexican
government until 1835. Settlement was difficult,
however, due to continuation of hostilities with
and raids by Native American tribes. The Texas
Rangers provided protection from these conflicts
after Texas secured independence from Mexico
in 1836. Settlement in the region increased until
1845, when Texas gained admission to the United
States, resulting in the formation of Hays County
in 1848 (Bousman and Nickels 2003).

Methods

the THC, all temporally diagnostic artifacts as
well as non-diagnostic lithic tools (e.g., bifaces)
were collected when encountered. These will be
prepared for permanent curation at the Center for
Archaeological Studies, Texas State UniversitySan Marcos. All excavations were backfilled
upon completion.

Development of the Purgatory Creek Park
trail system consists of a linear trail system with
minimal direct impact. However, the use of the
trail system by residents of San Marcos has
resulted in indirect impacts to cultural resources
in the Park. The indirect impacts of increased
pedestrian traffic are known to have included relic
collecting. Therefore, the THC has recommended
the entire 487-acre Park to be subjected to
pedestrian survey with shovel testing.

In addition to the search for unrecorded
cultural deposits, CAS revisited the previously
recorded site, 41HY72, in order to assess its
current condition and to ensure that potentially
significant deposits or remains were not present
that were initially missed or went unrecognized.
A Site (Update) Form was filled out for each site
and placed on file at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory at the University of Texas
at Austin.

By guidelines set out by the CTA and
adopted by the THC, intensive surveys of areas
greater than 200 acres require at least one shovel
test per three acres as appropriate (i.e., shovel
tests are not necessary for slopes of greater than
20° or areas where bedrock
is exposed). All shovel tests
excavations were evenly spaced
to ensure adequate coverage, but
with special emphasis given to
areas characterized by extensive
deposits. Each shovel test was
excavated to a maximum depth
of 75 cm, or to sterile deposits,
and all excavated sediment was
passed through a ¼” hardware
screen. The purpose of this
coverage was to locate any
buried archaeological deposits
that might be present but not
visible from the surface. The
locations of all shovel tests
were recorded by hand-held
global positioning system (GPS)
and plotted on a map of the
project area. All archaeological
materials recovered during the
shovel testing was described and
documented, and then returned

Results

41HY452
Site 41HY452 is a prehistoric lithic scatter
on a small ridge near the confluence of two
unnamed tributaries of Purgatory Creek in
the northern portion of the Park. Vegetation is
composed of cedar and sparse ground cover
(Figure 3). Cultural material associated with the
site is scattered across the surface in an area of
approximately 40 m within Park boundaries. The
Wonder World Drive Extension is adjacent to the
site, and if a portion of the site ever extended to
the northeast, it has been adversely impacted by
development of that roadway. One shovel test
was excavated amid the surficial lithic scatter,
and another was excavated 50 m from the site
centroid. Neither yielded cultural material, and
bedrock was reached within 20 cm.

Generally, topography within the Park is
highly variable and was a determining factor for
shovel test locations. Much of the Park is dissected
by deeply incised streams, and the slopes from
ridges down to streams expose bedrock in many
places. These slopes and bedrock exposures
make up an area of approximately 97.4 acres,
approximately 20 percent of the Park (Figure
2). Nonetheless all Park terrain was covered
by pedestrian survey, and 153 shovel tests
were excavated. Shovel test excavations were
concentrated on stable landforms (i.e., ridge tops
and terraces) and at archaeological sites known
previous to or discovered during this survey.
Given that stable features on the landscape
have a higher probability of containing and
preserving archaeological deposits, investigation
of these landforms was aimed at identifying
and delineating archaeological deposits. Shovel
tests were excavated at higher rates than what is
minimally required by THC guidelines in these
settings, especially where archaeological deposits
were encountered.

Cultural Materials
Cultural materials found here include a very
low amount of lithic debitage, a complete biface,
an unidirectional core, and an edge modified
flake. All of these materials were found on the
surface, just above the confluence of unnamed
tributaries. Therefore, they are probably from
secondary contexts, yet still contribute valuable
information about the site.

A total of 14 previously undocumented sites
were recorded in the course of this survey (Figure
2). Eight of the newly recorded sites are prehistoric
lithic scatters (41HY452, 41HY453, 41HY454,
41HY455, 41HY456, 41HY458, 41HY459, and
41HY460); two (41HY457, 41HY461) are historic
dumps, one of which (41HY457) contains the
remnants of a collapsed outbuilding; another is
an unknown historic structure (41HY461); three
are lithic resource procurement sites beneath rock
overhangs (41HY463, 41HY464, and 41HY465);
and the last is a rockshelter with historic and
buried prehistoric components (41HY462).
Descriptions of these 14 sites and a reassessment
of 41HY72 follow.

The fine-grained chert biface is ovate in
shape and is relatively small, measures 6.5 cm in
length, 4.0 cm in width, and 1.0 cm in thickness,
and weighs 26.35 g. The maximum width of the
specimen is skewed by a missing portion of the
lateral edge at the piece’s widest point (based
on interpolation of plan view). A hinge fracture
indicates that this missing lateral edge is due
to manufacture failure. Indeed, many of the
flake scars terminate in hinge or step fractures.
Additionally, the entire perimeter edge is sinuous,
and there is a small amount of cortex present
at the distal end. A very light colored patina is
present on the surface of the entire biface.

to the surface. No diagnostic material was
observed, therefore, no definite cultural period
can be identified. Cultural material found at the
site was collected from secondary context, on the
ridge’s slope. The site is located approximately
500 m from the nearest park trail, and there are
no apparent signs of vandalism.
Due to a paucity of artifacts and a lack of
ideal context, it is recommended that 41HY452 is
not eligible for NRHP listing or SAL designation,
and that no further investigations are necessary,
provided that measures of protection are provided
to the site. In the event that no protection is afforded
to the site, it is recommended that further work
be performed to determine the amount and type
of effort required to mitigate adverse impacts.

The unidirectional core has a flat and curving
platform surface, which extends approximately
10 cm and from which several flakes have been
removed. The distal end of the core is subround
to subangular, and approximately 75 percent of
the surface consists of cortex. This nodule of
medium-grained light grayish brown chert is
approximately 14 cm long, 7.0 cm wide, 5.0 cm
thick, and weighs 602.3 g. A patina covers the
entire surface of the core, however, not all flake
scars are equally patinated.

41HY453
Site 41HY453 is a prehistoric upland lithic
scatter that spans the southeastern portion of
a bifurcated ridge near the center of the park.
Topography in the area of the site ranges from
gently undulating near the top of the ridge to
relatively steep slopes (greater than 20 percent),
which terminate at small drainages or at either
of two unnamed tributaries of Purgatory Creek.
Vegetation ranges from dense groves of cedar,

One flake, measuring approximately 10.7 cm
long by 5.7 cm wide by 1.8 cm thick, has microflake scars present on both ventral and dorsal faces
almost continuously around the lateral margin.
These small vestiges of flake removal are more
common on the dorsal surface. Relatively larger
flake scars are present on the dorsal face, whereas
the ventral face is almost completely smooth.

Discussion and Recommendations
Site 41HY452 is a thin prehistoric lithic scatter
located in the northern-most corner of the Park on
a ridge just above the confluence of two unnamed
tributaries of Purgatory Creek. The portion of
the site contained within the Park’s boundary is
a relatively thin scatter of lithic artifacts limited

Cultural Materials
There are no obvious chert
sources
within
41HY453’s
boundary, but abundant amounts
of chert, in both tabular and
nodular form, outcrop within 500
m of the site. Tabular and nodular
chert cobbles, tested and whole,
are present at the site. Each of
the eight lithic concentrations
contained a relatively high
amount of lithic debitage, and
seven of the eight concentrations
contained additional evidence of
stone tool manufacture, including cores, bifaces,
edge modified flakes, and refitting flakes. A total
of five cores, 20 bifaces, 11 edge modified flakes,
and five refit flakes were collected from seven of
the eight concentrations (Table 1).

Site 41HY453 measures approximately 525 m

deposit extends as much as 43 cm below the
surface. This large extent was delineated by 39
shovel test excavations, and also by artifacts
scattered across the surface (Figure 5). The site
contains eight surficial lithic concentrations
characterized by a high amount of chert
cobbles, stone tools, and lithic debitage. Each
concentration measures approximately 20 m in
diameter (Figure 6). Concentrations are present
on top of the bifurcated ridge as well as on slopes
and at the base of the ridge, and are interconnected
by a thin scatter of lithic debitage. No diagnostic
artifacts were observed or collected, leaving the
time(s) of occupation unclear. Two major trails
intersect approximately 30 m away from the site’s

initial shaping of the raw material, but differ
in their use of hard (Stage 1) and soft (Stage 2)
percussors as the primary means of removing
flakes. Abandonment at this stage may be a result
of manufacturing failure or suitability for use
of the early-stage stone tool (Goode 2002). The
absence of late-stage bifaces at the site indicates
that stone tool manufacturing were started here
but completed elsewhere. However, the absence
of late-stage stone tools may also be a result of
indirect impacts resulting from pedestrian
traffic through the site. At any rate, upland
lithic scatters and lithic procurement locales
often lack finished stone tools on account
of later stage reduction and completion
occurring at habitation sites.
Amount of bifaces among the lithic
concentrations, which compose 41HY453,
varied. More were present at the site centroid
(n = 10), on top of the ridge, and concentration
E (n = 6) (Figure 8), on the south slope of
the ridge, than at concentrations B, C, D,
and G (for each n = 1). Generally, bifaces
are ovate/eliptical or triangular in shape,
have cortex present, are partially patinated,
are composed of fine- to medium-grained
gray brown chert, and have relatively

common step or hinge fractures.
Two bifaces from the centroid
are broken, with manufacturing
evidence in the form of snap
or hinge fractures alluding to
failure and discard. All lithic
concentrations from which
bifaces were collected contained
complete specimens exhibiting
possible edge modification or
use wear. Therefore, most of the
bifaces collected from 41HY453
fit nicely into Goode’s (2002)
framework of Stage 1 to 2
termini.

Two interesting artifact clusters are bifaces
with at least one refitting flake. Near the site
center, one tabular chert cobble with bifacial
flake removal was within 20 cm of four flakes that
can be refit in sequence back onto the specimen.
Similarly, a bifacially worked chert cobble was
found in proximity to a single refitting flake at
concentration E (Figure 9). While these clusters
of refitting flakes and bifaces may represent intact

41HY453’s present inability to provide additional
information to the understanding of prehistoric
cultures of the region, CAS recommends that no
further investigations are necessary, provided
that measures of protection are taken. In the event
that no protection is or can be offered to the site,
it is recommended that further effort is required
to mitigate adverse impacts.

Discussion and Recommendation
Site 41HY454, located just above a limestone
escarpment at the confluence of two unnamed
tributaries in the western portion of the Park, is
an upland lithic scatter. No diagnostic material
was observed or collected from the site, but there
is a relative abundance of chert debitage. Below
the site on the escarpment, there are three shallow
overhangs identified as lithic procurement sites
(41HY463, 41HY464, and 41HY465). Two of
these three sites have accessible lenses of chert
embedded within the limestone. It is not clear
whether or not any of the chert from these seams is
the same material as what it present at 41HY454.

41HY454
Just above a limestone escarpment at the
confluence of two unnamed tributaries of
Purgatory Creek in the western portion of the
Park is an upland lithic scatter, 41HY454. The site
is approximately 50-by-80 m, as delineated by
Park boundary, the escarpment, and two sterile
shovel tests. It consists of flakes, flake fragments,
cores, and tested cobbles. Four shovel tests were
excavated here, with two yielding flake fragments
at a maximum depth of 20 cm. Topography in
the vicinity slopes gently downward toward
the escarpment. Vegetation consists of short
grasses, patchy cacti, and isolated shrubs, and is
interrupted by a hiking trail that intersects the site
(Figure 11). A stack of limestone cobbles marking
the trail, flagging tape, and other synthetic debris
are evidence of modern disturbances. Limestone

is no apparent evidence of modern disturbance.
Based on the abundance of lithic scatters
in the region, and the lack of information
about prehistoric culture at 41HY455, CAS
recommends that no further investigations are
necessary. CAS, however, also recommends that
measures of protection are taken at the site. In
the event that no protection can be afforded, it is
recommended that further work be performed in
order to mitigate adverse impacts.

41HY455
Site 41HY455 is a lithic scatter located in
the western corner of the Park on a small ridge
just above the confluence of two unnamed
tributaries of Purgatory Creek. The site consists
of a concentration of lithic debris in an area of
10 to 15 m in diameter and faintly extending out
another 50 m (Figure 12). The dimensions of the
site were determined by Park boundary and the
scatter of lithic debitage on the surface; a single
shovel test excavation revealed thin soil (13 cm
thick), shallow bedrock, and no cultural materials.
Bedrock is exposed over a portion of the site and
extends down slope to the unnamed tributaries.
Vegetation ranges from patchy grasses and
cactus to small stands of oak and cedar trees. A
hiking trail skirts the eastern portion of the site.
Cultural material at 41HY455 included whole
and tested cobbles, flakes, and flake fragments.
No diagnostic material was observed, and no
artifacts were collected.

41HY456
Site 41HY456, an upland lithic scatter, is
located approximately 200 m south of 41HY455
on a gentle slope. The site is situated on a small
ridge above an unnamed tributary of Purgatory
Creek. Vegetation in the vicinity ranges from

Discussion and Recommendations
Located on a small ridge just above the
confluence of two unnamed tributaries in the
western corner of the Park, 41HY455 is a relatively
small lithic scatter. The absence of any stone
tools, formal or informal, can possibly indicate
that the site functioned only as a locale for initial
lithic reduction. The absence of any diagnostic
material makes it impossible to tie 41HY455 to
any temporal or cultural period. Aside from the

factors, including but not limited to an
insufficient amount of energy transferred

These vestiges of historic occupation do not
provide clear evidence of the period during which
this historic structure was built. However, they do
indicate use no earlier than the late nineteenthcentury. Corrugated metal sheets present at
41HY457 are thoroughly oxidized, and appear to
predate the 1961 invention of continuous rolling
and galvanizing mass productions of corrugated
metal (NSW Heritage Office 1998). Differential
weathering/corrosion of sides on continuously
rolled and galvanized corrugated metal sheets,
due to uneven application of galvanizing metal,
assists in distinguishing them from earlier made
corrugated metal sheets. Though wire nails have
existed since the early-1800s, they were not
commonly used in the United States until after
1890 (Sutton and Arkush 2002).

Discussion and Recommendations
Site 41HY457 contains the remnants of a
small historic structure, and is located in the
western corner of the Park on a small ridge south
of an unnamed tributary of Purgatory Creek.
While artifacts at the site are not characteristic
of a particular point in history, they indicate
construction between the 1890s and 1961. The
historical function of the site remains unclear.

Figure 15. Overview of 41HY457, photographed
facing south, with remnants of a historic structure in
foreground.

41HY457
Site 41HY457 is a small, collapsed historic
structure on a small ridge near the western corner
of the park (Figure 15). The horizontal extent of
the site is less than seven meters in diameter,
as delineated by the extent of cultural material
scattered across the surface. A single shovel test
adjacent to the pile of debris yielded no buried
cultural remains, and it revealed bedrock at 15
cm below the surface. Vegetation in proximity to
the cultural material ranges from stands of cedar
and oak trees to open grasslands with patches of
cacti.

Presently, 41HY457 does not have the
potential to contribute significantly to local,
state, or national history, and as such, appears
not to be eligible for NRHP listing or SAL
designation. Accordingly, CAS recommends that
no further investigations are necessary. However,
CAS recommends that the site be protected from
adverse impacts. In the event that no protection
is or can be afforded, it is recommended that
the further work be performed to offset adverse
impacts.

Cultural Materials
Cultural materials associated with 41HY457,
which were not collected, include five sheets of
corrugated metal, four 4-by-4” pieces of wood,
several 1-by-4” pieces of wood, and wire nails.
19

Cultural Materials
Cultural materials present at 41HY458
include artifacts typical of the upland lithic
scatters within the Park: tested cobbles, cores,
flakes, and flake fragments. A single flake with
edge modification and use-wear, classified as a
shouldered end scraper as described by Allen
et al. (1967) was collected (Figure 17). This
specimen is approximately five centimeters in
diameter, contains no cortex, is composed of finegrained brown chert, and has three edges with
microflake scars. The distal end of the flake has
been retouched to a convex shape, and a lateral
edge (the left if looking from proximal to distal
end with dorsal face up) has a small concavity
that forms a shoulder or spur where the distal
and lateral edges meet. All edge modification
is focused on the dorsal face of the flake. The
presence of this artifact, like edge modified flakes
present at other sites within the Park, suggests that
activities beyond lithic procurement were once
taking place at 41HY458. These extra activities,
however, are not understood.

Figure 16. Overview of small ridge upon which
41HY458 is located, and small tributary from

41HY458
Site 41HY458 is an upland lithic scatter situated
on the shoulder of a small ridge overlooking
Purgatory Creek and an unnamed tributary in
the southern portion of the Park (Figure 16).
Within the park, the site spans the upper portion
of the easterly-trending ridge (approximately 50
m by 5-15 m). However, a fence line marking
the boundary between City property and private
land containing a horse corral obscures the full
extent of the site. To the east, the site is delimited
by increasing gradient; where artifacts litter the
surface, slope ranges from 5 to 15 percent, but
slope increases to much greater than 20 percent
towards Purgatory Creek and the unnamed
tributary. Three shovel tests were excavated at
the site; one atop the ridge and one at the base of
the slope on either side. No shovel test contained
cultural material, and all excavations revealed
relatively shallow bedrock (less than 25 cm below
surface). Vegetation on top of the knoll consists
of scattered shrubs, small trees, and patches of
cacti. Bedrock is exposed across the ridge, and
composes a greater percentage of the surface as
slope increases.

Discussion and Recommendations

Cultural Materials

A lithic scatter, 41HY458, is located spanning
the top of a lightly wooded ridge overlooking
Purgatory Creek and an unnamed tributary. The
recorded extent of the site is limited by private
land use and slope, and all artifacts are limited
to the surface. Artifacts present at the site
include tested cobbles, cores, a shouldered end
scraper, and other flakes and flake fragments. No
diagnostic material was observed or collected.

Cultural materials associated with 41HY459
include a low amount of lithic debitage and a
core, which was collected. Measuring 10.7-by6.7-by-5.0 cm, the flake core is composed of
fine- to medium-grained grayish brown chert.
Approximately 30 percent is covered by cortex,
and it has a single continuous edge from which
flakes were removed. A portion of this edge has
microflake scares, which may either be the vestiges
of platform preparation or edge modification for
use as an expedient tool. Artifacts present here
are typical of the upland lithic scatters at the Park;
they do not include any diagnostic tools, nor do
they indicate any activities other than primary
lithic reduction.

At present, this site does not appear to have
the potential to contribute to the understanding of
local or regional prehistory. As such, 41HY458 is
not recommended to be eligible for NRHP listing
or SAL designation and no further investigations
are recommended at this time. However, CAS
recommends that the site be protected from
potential adverse impacts. In the event that no
protection is or can be afforded, it is recommended
that further work be performed to offset the loss
of data.

Discussion and Conclusions
Site 41HY459 is a lithic scatter located at the
junction of an abandoned two-track road and a
hiking trail on a terrace above Purgatory Creek
in the southern portion of the Park. A low amount
of artifacts associated with the site include lithic
debitage and a core, all present on the surface. No
diagnostic materials were observed. Aside from
the intersecting trails, there are no other apparent
signs of modern disturbance at 41HY459.

41HY459
Site 41HY459 is a lithic scatter in the southern
portion of the park on a terrace just above
Purgatory Creek. Two shovel test excavations
were devoid of cultural material and were
terminated at bedrock at a maximum depth of 22
cm below surface. Sterile shovel tests and surface
visibility were used to define the horizontal site
limits as an area of approximately 50-by-20 m.
Vegetation in the vicinity consists primarily of
oak and cedar trees and isolated clearings with
short grasses (Figure 18). Bedrock is outcropped
in portions of the area. Additionally, the site is
at the intersection of an abandoned two-track
road and a hiking trail which connects Purgatory
Creek Park to Prospect Park. No other modern
disturbances are apparent.

hand corner and the two-track road running from

The relative paucity of artifacts here limits
what can be learned about local or regional
prehistory from 41HY459. CAS recommends that
the site is not eligible for NRHP listing or SAL
designation, and that no further investigations are
necessary at 41HY459 at the present time. The
site should be protected from damaging impacts
from park-goers. In the case that protection is
not or cannot be provided, it is recommended
that further work is performed in order to offset
adverse impacts to the site.

Vegetation in the vicinity includes large
oak trees, patches of shrubs, and short to tall
grasses. In proximity to the mound, there are
several limestone boulders on the surface, but no
limestone outcrops are apparent in the area of the
site. There is, however, limestone exposed in an
escarpment across Purgatory Creek from the site,
and approximately 75 m to the north of the site is a
slope, with exposed limestone bedrock, that leads
to the next terrace higher in elevation. There is
also an abundance of limestone cobbles, some of
which are burned, scattered across the surface. A
hiking trail connecting Purgatory Creek Park to
Prospect Park, the same trail that passes through
41HY459, runs through 41HY460 and cuts across
the northern portion of the mound. Aside from
the trail, no modern intrusions are apparent.

41HY460
Site 41HY460 is a lithic scatter and small
mound situated on a terrace above Purgatory
Creek in the southern portion of the Park (Figure
19). One out of three shovel test excavations in
proximity to the mound yielded a small flake
fragment in the first level (0-20 cm below
surface), and a single shovel test at the top of the
mound revealed organic-rich sediment, charcoal,
thermally fractured chert, and burned limestone
cobbles. A paucity of cultural material in shovel
tests left the scatter of lithic debris on the surface
as the delimiting factor of the horizontal extent of
41HY460. The surficial scatter covered an area of
approximately 50 m in diameter.

Cultural Features
A single, small mound feature is located at
41HY460. The feature is located approximately
15 m from the terrace’s slope to Purgatory Creek.
It is distinctly oblong in shape, and measures
approximately eight to 10 m in diameter and
+/- one meter in height. A shovel test excavation
into the mound was terminated at approximately
75 cm below surface due to the combination of
an increasing amount of limestone cobbles and
excavator arm length. This shovel test revealed
organic-rich, black, loamy sediment throughout
the profile except where an mass of dark reddish
brown clay loam was encountered between 15
and 35 cm below surface in a portion of the wall
of the probe. Charcoal was observed throughout
the shovel test excavation, and is also plainly
visible on the surface. Also revealed throughout
excavation into the mound was a low amount of
thermally fractured chert pebbles, at least one
of which was a flake fragment. A slightly higher
amount of limestone cobbles were present as
well, and the amount of chert and limestone rocks
increased with depth.

Figure 19. Overview of and mound feature at
41HY460, photographed facing south.

22

Cultural Materials

In addition to the limestone cobbles present
within and surrounding the mound, there are
several very large limestone boulders, some
measuring more than 50 cm in diameter, adjacent
to the feature. Across Purgatory Creek, which
is only active during floods and has no distinct
channel at this location, there is a limestone
outcrop/escarpment. Approximately 75 m to
the north of the site, there is some limestone
cropping out of a slope which leads to the next
higher terrace. Yet adjacent to the site, there is
no outcropped limestone bedrock, and thus, it is
unclear how these limestone boulders arrived to
their current location; the most likely explanation
is that they were deposited during a severe flood
event. While there is charcoal within the mound,
there is also a piece of charred wood on the
surface adjacent to the mound. Charred wood is
also present across portions of the broad terrace
on which the mound is located.

Cultural materials at 41HY460 were limited
to a low amount of lithic debris and burned
limestone cobbles. No artifacts were collected.
Chert pebbles, flakes, and flake fragments are
visible on the surface that surrounds the mound
and extend approximately 20 m north of the
mound. A flake fragment was recorded in Level
1 of a shovel test excavation. No artifacts have
characteristics diagnostic of temporal or cultural
periods, and no clearly defined activities are
recognized.

Discussion and Recommendations
Site 41HY460 contains of a low amount of
lithic debris and a small mound situated near
the edge of a terrace overlooking Purgatory
Creek. No diagnostic materials were observed
or collected from the site. The age and function
of the mound associated with 41HY460 is not
completely understood. Burned limestone
cobbles and lithic debris adjacent to the mound,
in addition to burned limestone, chert rocks, and
charcoal within it, could indicate that the mound
is prehistoric in age. However, charred wood on
the surface adjacent to the mound, as well as the
surrounding landform, is clearly modern, and
the mottled stratigraphy of the mound suggests
it is the result of disturbance. Accordingly,
our conclusion is that this mound represents a
relatively recent or historic “push pile” following
a controlled burning event. There are old growth
trees on the terrace, though these all are located
along the edges. All vegetation across the terrace
surface is relatively young growth, indicating that
this landform had been cleared in historic times.

No diagnostic materials were observed at the
site, and no worked tool fragments, as seen at
other sites described in this report, were present.
Sediments making up the mound, including
charcoal, are quite different in texture from
sediment encountered in nearby shovel tests.
From these difference in sediment, the inclusion
of charcoal and other burned debris (e.g., chert
and limestone), and also from the protruding
morphology of the feature compared to the
surrounding landscape, the mound is clearly the
result of human activity. The culture which this
feature represents, however, is not clear. There
are no apparent signs of a historical component,
whereas, lithic debris is located within and
surrounding the feature. Additionally, the
presence of burned limestone cobbles, albeit low
in frequency, is characteristic of hot rock cooking
features across Central Texas (c.f., Black et al.
1997; Nickels et al. 2001).

Presently, 41HY460 does not appear to be
eligible for NRHP listing or SAL designation.
CAS recommends that no further investigations
are necessary, given that measure of protection
are provided to the site. In the event that no
protection can be provided, it is recommended

numerous signs (modern refuse) of relatively
recent flooding events. The extent of the site,
approximately 40-by-20 m, was delimited by the
extent of the clustered historic artifacts. No shovel
tests were excavated in the channel. Vegetation
within the channel at this location is grasses and
small shrubs. Lining the channel there are oak
and cedar trees, and bedrock is exposed in the
escarpment to the north.

to mitigate adverse impacts.

Cultural Materials
Historic debris associated with 41HY461
includes scraps of ferrous metal, soles and
uppers of leather shoes, and a variety of glass
sherds. Diagnostic glass sherds, i.e., pieces with
maker’s marks or any other temporally sensitive
characteristics, were collected in order to provide
an estimated age of the cluster. A total of 10 glass
sherds and two complete vessels were collected.
Using catalogs of historical bottle maker’s marks
and other identifying characteristics compiled
by Toulouse (1971) and Lindsey (2010), the
diagnostic sherds and bottles date from the early
twentieth-century to relatively recent (Table 2).

41HY461
Site 41HY461 is a scatter of mid-twentiethcentury historic debris near the confluence of
Purgatory Creek and a small, unnamed tributary
in the southeastern portion of the Park (Figure
20). Cultural material was found in a 40-by-20 m
cluster in the diffuse channel of Purgatory Creek
just downstream from the confluence. Along this
stretch, Purgatory Creek is intermittent, only
flowing during massive flood events, and it has no
incised, distinct channel. The unnamed tributary,

Discussion and Recommendations
Located in the diffused channel of Purgatory
Creek, just downstream from a confluence with a
small unnamed tributary, there is a relatively small
concentration of historical debris, site 41HY461.
Historical artifacts present are characteristic of
domestic occupation nearby, and identifiable
sherds of glass are indicative of early twentiethcentury to present. These artifacts, however, are
in poor context and do not represent primary
deposition. It appears that the historical site from
which the artifacts originated, mobilized by the
unnamed tributary, is located on the escarpment
north of Purgatory Creek. Accordingly, this site
has little research value without the definitive
association with a dump or structure from which
they originated.

to the south and a limestone escarpment to the
north. The terrace opposite the rockshelter has
vegetation ranging from short grasses and small
shrubs to large oak trees, and the vegetation atop
the limestone escarpment consists of grasses,
patchy cacti, and cedar and oak trees.
The space beneath the overhang is
approximately 25 m wide, 20 m deep, and at least
seven meters high (Figure 22). One lithological
unit within the rockshelter has weathered slightly
less than all others and creates a shelf that spans
the entire shelter. This unit, as well as the others,
has weathered and eroded throughout the shelter’s
life. As a result, the surface has an abundance of
pebble to boulder-sized limestone rocks, as well as
fine- grained sediments, covering it. Three shovel
tests excavated in the rockshelter revealed rockladen sediments to a maximum depth of 50 cm
below surface. All of the shovel test excavations
were terminated at an impenetrable rock stratum,
which represents either unconsolidated bedrock or
concentrated roof/wall collapse. All three shovel
tests contained buried cultural material. Historical
as well as prehistoric artifacts are present on the
surface within the shelter. In addition to historical
artifacts, there is a long history of graffiti etched
into or written on portions of the walls and ceiling

CAS recommends that 41HY461 is not
eligible for NRHP listing or SAL designation, and
also that no further investigations are necessary.
However, in the event that these artifacts could
be linked to a significant historical site, CAS
recommends that 41HY461 be protected. In the
case that no protection is or can be offered, it is
recommended that further work is performed to
offset the loss of data.

41HY462
Site 41HY462 is a rockshelter located in a
limestone escarpment along Purgatory Creek
in the southern portion of the Park (Figure 21).
Along this stretch of Purgatory Creek, the slightly
incised channel is defined by pebble to bouldersized rocks between a terrace, which stands
approximately three meters above the channel,

been burned. These artifacts
are medium- to coarse-grained

two probable looting pits. Geocaching is a techsavvy scavenger hunt, where participants use GPS
devices to locate geocaches (Groundspeak, Inc.
2010). Additionally, the San Marcos Greenbelt
Alliance (2009) advertises a proposed trail, which
is already a well-defined path, to the rockshelter.
This overhang is a dramatic natural feature of
the Park, and presently draws large numbers of
visitors to the site.

Faunal remains were also recovered from
a shovel test excavation (JH 13) at the highest
and deepest point of the rockshelter. A lumbar
vertebra of a juvenile/subadult goat-sized
mammal was recovered from the first level of the
shovel test (0-20 cm below surface), and a goatsized humerus fragment was recovered from
approximately 45 centimeters below surface.
The sediment encountered in this shovel test
excavation contained a great amount of limestone
pebbles and sandy silt matrix. All of these faunal
remains, however, are not clearly prehistoric in
age. The bird bone fragment came from a level
where a piece of glass was also observed, and
the two goat-sized bones were not observed in
association with any lithic material.

Prehistoric Component
The prehistoric component of 41HY462, as
observed by CAS archaeologists, is limited to
vestiges of stone tool manufacture. Lithic artifacts
were observed on the surface and a sample was
collected from a shovel test excavation.

and graffiti on a number of walls within the
rockshelter. Artifacts and features (graffiti)
represent very brief visits to the site, probably
lasting no more than an afternoon, from the
nineteenth century to present.

Site 41HY462 is a rockshelter, located on
Purgatory Creek in the southern portion of the
Park, containing prehistoric and historic artifacts
and features. Prehistoric occupation of the
geological feature is indicated by the presence
of burned lithic debitage, and historical visits to
the site are apparent with the presence of graffiti,
which identifies the name and date of some
individuals’ visits. While periods of prehistoric
occupation are unclear, it is unambiguous that
people visited the rockshelter from the nineteenthcentury to present.

Historical features at 41HY462 consist of
markings made by visitors on the walls of the
rockshelter. This graffiti primarily records
visitors’ names and dates they were present;
some are engraved into the limestone and others
are written in lead or ink (Figures 23, 24). The
oldest legible signature was written in lead,
presumably during the nineteenth-century, and
this signature is the only discernable vestige
of the century. Much of the graffiti is dated
to the first half of the twentieth-century.
There is, however, graffiti spanning the
entire twentieth-century and continuing to
present-day.
Unfortunately, many of the names
engraved and written are not entirely
legible. These mementos left by visitors of
the past, especially the earliest, are very
interesting and should be protected and
preserved. However, at present they do not
appear to contribute to the history of San
Marcos, Texas, or the United States.

Figure 23. A sample of historical graffiti within the
rockshelter. Note Francisco Leche 18(?)9 in bottom right
hand corner.

Historical artifacts consist of two small
sherds of clear bottle glass. Both were
observed in a shovel test excavation (DY 6),
which also yielded six chert flake fragments
and a bird bone, located on the talus slope
near the front of the rockshelter. One sherd
was observed in the first level (0-20 cm
below surface) and the second sherd was
observed in the second level (20-40 cm
below surface) of the excavation. Neither
sherd had any identifiable characteristics.

41HY463

Aside from knowing the identity of historical
visitors to 41HY462, the historical component
of this site does not provide information that
can further any understanding of local, state, or
regional history. Still, given the age of some of
the graffiti, it is of historical interest to the San
Marcos community. Prehistoric occupation of the
site is presently not well understood. Vestiges of
looter’s pits indicate that buried cultural deposits
could be compromised, and additionally with the
rockshelter’s location on Purgatory Creek, flood
events may have also compromised prehistoric
deposits. However, the condition of the prehistoric
component of the site is not known.

Site 41HY463 is one of three rock overhangs
situated along the north bank of an unnamed
tributary of Purgatory Creek. This particular site
is the easternmost of the three. The geological
feature is weathered and eroded into a limestone
escarpment approximately 3-5 m above the
channel, and it measures approximately seven
meters in length, 2.5 m high, and 2-3 m deep
(Figure 25). There is no sediment beneath
the overhang—the floor is also composed of
limestone—however, there is a talus slope, in
front of the overhang composed of fine-grained
sediment and pebble- to boulder-sized limestone
rocks produced by mechanical weathering. A
single shovel test was excavated into the talus
slope and yielded a low amount of cultural
material. The extent of the site is limited to the
rock overhang and the talus slope in front of it.

Presently, the eligibility of 41HY462
for NRHP listing and SAL designation are
unknown. The site has potential to contain
intact, undisturbed buried prehistoric deposits. If
present and identified, these would have strong
potential for contributing to knowledge of the
Central Texas region. Considering the amount
of traffic that the site receives, it is presently
exposed and vulnerable to disturbance or even
destruction. CAS recommends that clear and
effective measures be taken by the City to protect
the site from further disturbance. Minimally, this
should include a regular program for monitoring
the site and might also include posted signs at
the Park entrance informing the general public
that destruction of sites and removal of
artifacts are prohibited by law. If these
measures can not be implemented or
prove ineffective, then CAS recommends
that the City conduct additional
investigations at this site in order to
determine its NRHP and SAL eligibility,
and to recover data to offset the loss of
valuable cultural information.

There are several veins or nodules of
coarse-grained chert exposed in the limestone
escarpment and within the walls of the overhang.
The exposed in situ chert has not been discernibly
flaked or removed by people. However, most
of the flake fragments that were observed here
are of the same material that is exposed at this
location. There are no cultural features indicating
any prolonged human habitation, and the site is

considered to be a lithic resource procurement
locale.

Given the paucity of evidence for prehistoric
habitation, it does not appear that the site could
contribute significantly to the understanding
of prehistory in Central Texas. Accordingly,
CAS recommends that the site is not eligible for
NRHP listing or SAL designation. There are
no clear signs of modern perturbations at the
site. However, CAS recommends that measures
of protection are ensured. If the site can not be
protected, CAS recommends that further work
would be necessary to offset the potential loss of
data.

Cultural Materials
Cultural materials associated with the site
consist only of flake fragments. Eleven flake
fragments were recovered from the surface
and two were recovered from within the first
level (0-20 cm below surface) of a shovel test
excavated into the talus slope. Materials observed
on the surface include coarse-grained, thermally
fractured dark gray chert (n=7); three fragments
of flakes composed of light gray, finer-grained,
thermally fractured chert; and one fine-grained,
brown chert flake fragment. Two flake fragments
from the shovel test are composed of light gray,
fine- to medium-grained chert—similar to three
fragments recovered on the surface.

41HY464
Site 41HY464 is the second, and middle, of
three rock overhangs along the same tributary
of Purgatory Creek in the west-central portion
of the Park. The site is approximately 20 m
west of 41HY463 and 20 m east of 41HY465.
This geological feature is approximately seven
meters wide, 2.5 m tall, and 2-3 m deep (front to
back), and it is also located approximately three
to five meters above the modern channel (Figure
26). Similar to 41HY463, site 41HY464’s rock
overhang contains no sediment, but beyond the
rock overhang there is a talus slope composed of
fine-grained sediments and pebble- to bouldersized rock fall. There are also two distinct veins
of chert that are exposed in the back wall of this
geological feature (Figure 27).

The coarse-grained, dark gray chert artifacts
recovered from the surface appear consistent
with the in situ chert exposed in the limestone
escarpment and in the walls of the rock overhang,
whereas the light gray and brown finer-grained
chert artifacts do not appear to have come from
this particular outcrop.

Discussion and Recommendations
Site 41HY463 is a lithic resource procurement
locality in a rock overhang, with exposures of
coarse-grained chert veins/nodules, along a
tributary of Purgatory Creek in the west-central
portion of the Park. The overhang resembles
a shallow rockshelter, although the site lacks
any cultural features characteristic of a
habitation site. A shovel test excavation
into the talus slope in front of the
overhang revealed cultural materials
deposited as deep as 20 cm below surface.
No culturally or temporally diagnostic
artifacts were observed.

photographed facing north.

Cultural Materials
Vestiges of human presence at 41HY464 take
the form of flakes and flake fragments. A total of
eight flakes and flake fragments were observed
on and collected from the surface. All of these
artifacts appear consistent with the composition
of the finer-grained, lower chert stratum exposed
in the walls of the overhang. A single shovel test
excavated into the talus slope beyond the extent
of the rock overhang contained two chert pebbles
that were not distinctly cultural. Both of these
specimens were observed in the first level (0-20
cm below surface) of the excavation, which was
terminated at a impenetrable zone of rock. No
culturally or temporally diagnostic artifacts were
observed at 41HY464.

Discussion and Recommendations
Site 41HY464 is interpreted as a lithic resource
procurement locality in a rock overhang, which
has two exposures of chert veins, along a tributary
of Purgatory Creek in the west-central portion of
the Park. This site is located approximately halfway between two other rock overhangs, 41HY463
and 41HY465. The overhang is morphologically
similar to a rockshelter, however there is an
absence of cultural features characteristic of a
habitation at the site. No culturally or temporally
diagnostic artifacts were observed.

Figure 27. Back wall of 41HY464 overhang with two
distinct veins of chert exposed.

The upper vein of chert is a relatively coarsegrained, light grayish brown chert, and the lower
vein is fine-grained grayish brown chert. Both
exposures have been broken off and worked
back to be almost even with the adjoining chalky
limestone. Chalky limestone on either side of
both chert veins has weathered and eroded rather
smoothly, compared to the adjacent, craggy
limestone strata. It is possible that in some places
the chalky limestone has been removed in order
to expose the veins of chert.

Given the lack of evidence for prehistoric
habitation, it does not appear that the site could
contribute significantly to the understanding
of prehistory in Central Texas. Accordingly,
CAS recommends that the site is not eligible
for NRHP listing or SAL designation. There
are no apparent signs of modern disturbances
at 41HY464. However, CAS recommends that
the site is protected from damage or vandalism.
If protection cannot or is not offered to the site,
CAS recommends that further work would be
necessary to offset the potential loss of data.

Given the absence of cultural features
indicating habitation of 41HY464, the site is
interpreted as a lithic resource procurement
locality. The extent of the site is limited to the
area beneath the rock overhang and the talus
slope in front of it.

fall. The formation and ultimate destruction of
rock overhangs (or, rockshelters if prolonged
occupation can be proved) results from two
processes:
high-frequency
low-magnitude
breakdown and low-frequency high-magnitude
collapse events (Collins 1991). The talus “cone”
in front of the overhang at 41HY465, due to
its location, morphology, and composition, is
interpreted as the result of a high-magnitude
collapse event.
As the walls of the rock overhang could
not be accessed, no in situ chert exposures
were observed. There were, however, cultural
materials present on the surface and as deep as
20 cm below the surface in front of the mounded
sediment. The extent of the site is limited to the
overhang and the deposit of material in front of it.
Because the interior of the overhang could not be
accessed, and therefore, the presence of cultural
features characteristic of habitation at the site
could not be investigated, it remains a possibility
that this site was indeed occupied on a temporary
basis. Additional excavations are needed to
disprove this possibility.

Figure 28. Overview of 41HY465, photographed
from the tributary channel facing north. Note the
talus deposit obstructing the rock overhang.

41HY465
Site 41HY465 is the western-most of three
sites along a 50-meter stretch of an unnamed
tributary of Purgatory Creek in the west-central
portion of the park. Whereas the other two sites are
accessible rock overhangs located approximately
three to five meters above the modern channel,
41HY465 has a talus deposit impeding entrance
and is approximately two to three meters above
the channel (Figure 28). Though a mound of
debris blocks its entrance, the morphology of the
rock overhang can be approximated from exposed
portions. The dimensions of this geological
feature are similar to those of 41HY463 and
41HY464, however, the depth and height are not
known.

Cultural Materials
Cultural materials collected from 41HY465
include lithic debitage and faunal remains,
though faunal remains are not clearly prehistoric
in age. Two shovel tests excavated in front of
the talus deposit (channel-side) revealed a total
of 15 flakes and flake fragments, four of which
were thermally fractured. From the surface, six
pieces of lithic debitage were collected—four of
these artifacts have clearly been heated, whereas
the remaining two have not. The collected flake
fragments are composed of fine-grained dark
grayish brown chert, which is dissimilar to the
chert exposed at 41HY463 and 41HY464. No
culturally or temporally diagnostic stone artifacts
were observed.

The talus deposit impeding access to
the overhang is composed of fine-grained
sediments and pebble- to boulder-sized rock
31

41HY72

In addition to lithic artifacts, two bones of
a goat-sized animal(s) were recovered from
the surface at the site. One is a complete, right
metacarpal and the other is the distal end of a
femur. Though both specimens appear old and are
weathered, neither contains remnants of cultural
activities (e.g., cut marks), and neither is clearly
prehistoric in age.

Site 41HY72 was initially recorded during
a survey of the area’s drainage basins in 1974
and was described as an upland lithic scatter
composed of tabular and nodular chert cobbles,
cores, crude bifaces, and a high amount of lithic
debitage. It is located on a gently sloping ridge
just above an unnamed tributary of Purgatory
Creek. Vegetation in the vicinity of the site is
grassland with patchy cacti and discontinuous
stands of trees. Vegetation becomes woodier at
the shoulder of the slope down to the unnamed
drainage.

Discussion and Conclusions
Site 41HY465 is the western-most of a series of
three rock overhang sites located along a tributary
of Purgatory Creek in the west-central portion
of the Park. Unlike the other two overhangs,
41HY465 is inaccessible due to a talus deposit,
which most likely represents the collapse of a
portion of the rock overhang. The talus slope is
composed of fine- and coarse-grained sediments,
and it contains cultural material. Because access
to the overhang is obscured by the talus slope,
it is not known whether people occupied this
site in prehistoric times or whether it served as
a lithic procurement locality like the other two
nearby overhangs. If the site was occupied in the
past as a small habitation site, there is a very high
likelihood that evidence of that occupation is well
preserved and intact beneath the talus deposit.

One shovel test was excavated near the center
of the scattered cultural material composing the
site. This shovel test excavation revealed four
small flake fragments in the top 10 cm, and the
excavation encountered a rubified sterile subsoil
at approximately 20 cm below surface. As a result,
delineation of the site’s boundary was measured
by the extent of the surface scatter of lithic
debitage. Site 41HY72 is currently approximately
75-by-50 m in area.

Cultural Materials
Cultural materials currently present at
41HY72 include small piles of mixed chert and
limestone rocks, tested chert cobbles, and lithic
debitage. The piles of rocks, which were not noted
by Patterson and Ivey (1974), appear to be the
result of modern activities. None of the limestone
or chert cobbles show evidence of burning.
No crude bifaces or culturally or temporally
diagnostic artifacts were observed.

As a result of the relative ambiguity of
the cultural deposits, CAS recommends that
41HY465’s eligibility for NRHP listing or
SAL designation is presently unknown. CAS
recommends that the City protect the site from
negative effects from Park visitors. So long as the
site is not impacted, CAS recommends that no
additional work here is necessary. However, in
the event that no protection is or can be offered,
CAS recommends that further work is necessary
to determine the site’s NRHP and SAL eligibility
and to offset any potential loss of data resulting
from adverse impacts.

Discussion and Recommendations
Site 41HY72 is an upland lithic scatter located
on a gently sloping ridge top just above an unnamed
tributary of Purgatory Creek. The condition of the
site does not appear to have changed dramatically
since it was initially recorded in 1974. There are,
32

however, some important differences between
reports, indicating relatively recent disturbances
to the site.

human activity along Purgatory Creek. A total of
11 prehistoric sites (41HY452, 41HY453, 41HY454,
41HY455, 41HY456, 41HY458, 41HY459,
41HY460, 41HY463, 41HY464, and 41HY465),
two historic sites (41HY457 and 41HY461), and
one rockshelter (41HY462) containing prehistoric
and historic components were recorded as a result
of this project.

The current presence of piled chert and
limestone rocks does not correspond to the initial
report. These could be the result of uncontrolled
activities at the site, as relic hunters sift through
the cultural material and throw rocks into piles.
Additionally, while much of the chert debitage
is patinated, there are a number of pieces that
are not patinated and appear to have been
removed relatively recently. As discussed with
site 41HY453, differences in rates and degrees
of patination can be due to variable mineral
compositions and ambient conditions. However,
it is highly unlikely that a single artifact will be
patinated in some areas but not others unless that
artifact has been worked since in modern times.
In other words, some artifacts at this site clearly
show modern flaking, providing evidence that the
site is being negatively impacted or has been in
recent times. Recent human activities at 41HY72
are also evident by a stack of rocks, similar to
those marking trails throughout the park, and an
arrow scratched on to a boulder of limestone.

Sites 41HY452, 41HY453, 41HY454,
41HY455, 41HY456, 41HY458, 41HY459, and
41HY460 are thin prehistoric lithic scatters
located in the upland portions of Purgatory
Creek Park. These sites contain varying amounts
of lithic debitage, stone tools, cores, and tested
cobbles characteristic of primary or early-stage
lithic reduction. No unambiguous culturally or
temporally diagnostic artifacts were observed at
or recovered from any of these seven sites. The
absence of diagnostic artifacts (i.e., projectile
points) may be a result of those artifacts having
been removed from the Park by relic collectors,
though there is currently no way to verify this
possibility. At any rate, due to the common
occurrence of upland lithic scatters, both in the
Park and in Central Texas, combined with the
inability of these sites to significantly strengthen
the understanding of prehistoric lifeways in the
region using current research methods, CAS
recommends that these sites are not eligible for
NRHP listing or SAL designation, and also that
no further investigations are necessary. CAS also
recommends, however, that all of these sites be
protected by the City against adverse impacts as
trail systems are developed and Park visitation
increases. In the event that no protection is or
can be offered to any one of these sites, or that
protective measures are enacted that prove
ineffective, CAS recommends that further work
at that site would be necessary to offset the
potential loss of data.

While the site does not appear to contain the
potential to contribute significantly to the general
understanding of Central Texas’ prehistory, CAS
recommends that 41HY72 be afforded protection
from further adverse impacts. CAS recommends
that the site is not eligible for NRHP listing or
SAL designation, and that no further work is
necessary, pending protection.

Summary and Conclusions
Intensive archaeological survey at Purgatory
Creek Park identified a number of cultural
resources representing prehistoric and historic
33

Sites 41HY463, 464, and 465 are also
prehistoric lithic scatters, but they represent
locales where raw lithic materials were directly
procured from exposed outcrops. These three
sites are clustered in the west-central portion of
the park along an unnamed tributary of Purgatory
Creek and each is associated with a rock overhang.
While habitation is not indicated at two of these,
41HY463 and 41HY464, it remains a possibility
that 41HY465 was occupied in prehistoric times.
None of these sites yielded diagnostic material
during investigations. Sites 41HY463 and
41HY464 are recommended not to be eligible
for NRHP listing or SAL designation, whereas
the NRHP and SAL eligibility of 41HY465
is presently unknown. At all three sites, CAS
recommends that no further investigations are
necessary, provided that measures of protection
against adverse impacts are ensured. In the
event that no protection can be offered or proves
ineffective, CAS recommends that further work
may be necessary to offset the loss of information
resulting from negative impacts.

at least in concentrated areas. Additionally,
because of the rockshelter’s location on Purgatory
Creek, flood events may also have compromised
some potential prehistoric deposits. However,
the condition (nature, extent, age, degree of
disturbance) of the prehistoric component of the
site is presently not well known. Accordingly,
41HY462’s eligibility for NRHP listing and SAL
designation is unknown, though the site appears
to have strong potential for containing materials
and deposits that would add considerably to the
understanding of local and regional prehistory.
Because the site is frequently visited, and recent
inspections by CAS personnel (on 10 March,
2010) show that some of the historical graffiti has
been overwritten since it was documented during
this project (in the Fall, 2009), CAS strongly
recommends that the City enact protective
measures for the site as soon as possible.
Currently, the site is highly vulnerable to negative
impacts from Park visitors. If protective measures
are not effective or can not be instituted, CAS
recommends that the City contract for additional
investigations designed to finalize determinations
of NRHP and SAL eligibility. If the site proves
eligible for NRHP listing and SAL designation
and remains vulnerable to negative impacts,
CAS recommends that the City work with the
THC to determine an appropriate level of effort
for mitigating the loss of important information
through additional excavations and detailed
analyses.

Site 41HY462, consisting of prehistoric and
historic components, is a rockshelter located on
Purgatory Creek in the southern portion of the
Park. Historical visitations to the site are apparent
from the presence of graffiti, which identifies
the names and dates of some individuals’
visits. Based on the dates that accompany
some names, it is evident that people have been
visiting the rockshelter from the nineteenthcentury to present. Aside from knowing the
identity of historical visitors to 41HY462, the
historical component of this site does not provide
information that can help understand local, state,
or regional history. Prehistoric occupation of the
geological feature is indicated by the presence of
thermally fractured lithic debitage, though the
nature of this occupation is presently not well
understood. Vestiges of looter’s pits indicate that
buried cultural deposits could be compromised,

Sites 41HY457 and 41HY461 are the only
strictly historical sites identified within the Park.
Site 41HY457 contains the collapsed remnants
of a small structure, most likely an outbuilding,
located in the western corner of the Park on a
small ridge south of an unnamed tributary of
Purgatory Creek. Site 41HY461 is composed of a
cluster of historic debris, including glass sherds of
the early to middle twentieth-century, located in
the southern corner of the park at the confluence
34

of Purgatory Creek and one of its small, unnamed
tributaries. CAS recommends that neither of
these sites is eligible for NRHP listing nor SAL
designation, and also that no further investigations
are necessary. It is also recommended that these
sites be provided protection against potential
adverse impacts such as vandalism and theft. In
the case that no protection is or can be offered,
CAS recommends that further work would be
necessary to offset potential loss of data.

of prehistoric sites containing relatively high
amounts of lithic debitage, rough stone tools,
cores, and tested cobbles that were recorded
here, it is notable that no clearly diagnostic
artifacts (i.e., projectile points) were observed.
Clearly, not all prehistoric sites contain projectile
points. However, the absence of these diagnostic
artifacts at many sites on public parkland, both in
San Marcos and across the State of Texas, has led
some archaeologists to conclude that uncontrolled
collection of materials (looting) has occurred
(c.f., Howard et al. 1996). Looting, in this case
the theft by illegal removal of cultural resources
from City-owned property, is a common form of
vandalism to sites. At the minimum, measures of
protection should be taken to ensure that further
theft does not occur at Purgatory Creek Park.
Possible examples include erecting clear signage
notifying the public about the sensitive nature
of archaeological sites on public property and
of the unlawfulness of disturbing them, though
without providing specific information about
site locations or contents, at the trail head or
any other location that is commonly accessed.
Additionally, developing schedules for monitoring
site conditions by trained City personnel would
be another effective way of identifying impacts
almost as soon as they occur. In any event, CAS
recommends that any additional development of
trail systems, including schedules and methods
for maintaining these trails once installed, avoid
these recorded sites.

Additionally, the current project revisited and
reassessed site 41HY72, an upland lithic scatter
that was initially discovered and recorded in
1974. There are minor discrepancies between the
original site form and the site’s current condition,
which shows evidence of some relatively recent
disturbances. Based on the reevaluation, CAS
concurs that the site is not eligible for NRHP
listing or SAL designation and that no further
investigations are necessary. Like all other
sites recorded through the course of the current
project, however, CAS recommends that 41HY72
be protected from additional adverse impacts.
In the event that no protection can be offered,
further work is recommended in order to offset
potential losses of data.
A final comment is warranted regarding
the nature of cultural materials that have been
documented at the Park. Considering the number
