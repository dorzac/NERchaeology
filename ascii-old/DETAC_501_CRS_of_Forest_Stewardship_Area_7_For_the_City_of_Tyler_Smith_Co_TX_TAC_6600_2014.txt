ABSTRACT
Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants (DETAC) conducted a cultural resource
management survey for the City of Tyler, Texas of select areas of two tracts of Forest
Stewardship Area 7 around Lake Tyler East for timber thinning operations. Timber
thinning in Tract 1 will be conducted over 30.5 hectares (ha) (75 acres (ac)) and timber
thinning in Tract 2 will be conducted over 19.4 ha (47.9 ac) for a total of 49.9 ha (132.9
ac). Texas Antiquities Permit #6600 was obtained for this project, and all terms of the
permit were carried out pursuant of the Texas Antiquities Code. Timber will be thinned in
the project area and hauled off the property. The pedestrian survey was conducted with a
combination of visual examination in floodplains and shovel testing across upland ridges
and in the Mud Creek floodplain. A total of 185 shovel tests were excavated across eight
elevated landforms and a portion of the Mud Creek floodplain totaling 30.4 ha (74.9 ac).
No new archaeological sites were recorded. No artifacts were collected or curated.
DETAC requests concurrence with a determination of “no effect” to properties listed or
eligible to the National Register of Historic Places for the proposed timber thinning
operations. If any artifacts, dark greasy soils, or human bones are uncovered during the
timber thinning, then all work will stop in the immediate area and both DETAC and the
THC will be notified immediately.

INTRODUCTION
In August and September 2013 DETAC conducted a cultural resources survey for
the City of Tyler, Texas of two tracts in Forest Stewardship Area 7 (FSA 7) near the
southeast corner of Lake Tyler East (Figure 1). The survey was conducted upon request of
the City of Tyler for timber thinning operations. No timber thinning will be conducted
within 30 meters (m) (100 feet (ft) of the lake shore. Texas Antiquities Permit #6600 was
obtained for this project, and all terms of the permit were carried out pursuant of the Texas
Antiquities Code.
The two tracts, totaling 238.3 hectares (ha) (588.8 acres (ac)), encompass the
southwestern portion of Lake Tyler East. Tract 1 (190 ha (117 ac)) is located north of the
dam and includes the channel connecting Lake Tyler East and Lake Tyler West. It extends
to the east bank of Lake Tyler East, but it stops short of the shore line. Tract 2 (48.3 ha (30
ac)) is south of the lake dam and extends from the upland ridge west of Mud creek into the
floodplain. Given these boundaries, the archaeological survey was to focus on shovel
testing on ridge summits and shoulders of each tract; however, a meeting with the logging
contractor onsite revealed Tract 2 was only going to be timbered from the uplands to a fence
line west of Mud Creek. Recalculated with the new boundaries, the timber thinning will
take place on 30.5 ha (75 ac.) of Tract 1 and 19.4 ha (47.9 ac) of Tract 2. The archaeological
survey encompassed the entire timber thinning area with shovel testing conducted on ridge
summits, toe slopes and a portion of the Mud Creek floodplain. A visual examination was
conducted on backslopes. Shovel testing and visual examination did not record any
archaeological sites in the project area. Several modern trash piles, a road cut, and two
telephone outlets suggest portions of Tract 1 were utilized or prepared for modern use. The
archaeological survey of Tract 2 was almost a mirror of the proposed work; the uplands
were highly disturbed and contained shallow soils while the floodplain contained deeper
sandy and silty soils with less modern disturbances. No artifacts were collected or curated.
The archaeological survey did not record any archaeological sites. No further
archaeological work is recommended for the proposed timber thinning in FSA 7. DETAC
requests concurrence with a determination of “no effect” to properties listed or eligible to the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) for the proposed timber thinning operations in
FSA 7.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Smith County is within the Pine Woods subdivision of the East Texas Timber Belt
of the Gulf Coastal Plain Physiographic Province of North America and the Austoriparian
Biotic Province of Texas. The Gulf Coastal Plain Province is characterized by low
topographic relief, extensive marshy tracts, altitudes below 152 m (500 ft), and sedimentary
geologic formations (Atwood 1940; Bureau of Economic Geology [BEG] 1965). The
Austoriparian Biotic Province is characterized by pine and pine-oak forests on the uplands
and by the abundant oak, elm and ash hardwoods in the lowlands (Blair 1950). The Pine
Woods subdivision is the dissected sandy forestlands with rolling relief whose western
boundary is approximately the 109 centimeters (cm) (43 inches (in)) rainfall line (Chambers
1948). The East Texas Timber Belt geographic region supports abundant pine and oak
woodlands and is characterized by a gently rolling to level sandy terrain, annual rainfall in
excess of 102 cm (40 in) and an average growing season of over 240 days (Bray 1904).
Vegetation in the Pine Woods subdivision includes a variety of pine, maple, and oak trees
with a wide variety of shrubs to include beauty berry, yaupon, farkle berry, and sumac. The
woody vine understory includes muscadine grape, poison ivy, Virginia creeper, and saw
greenbrier.

Geology
The Gulf Coastal Plain was an elevated sea bottom (Hunt 1974) formed during the
Cenozoic Era when cycles of transgression and regression of the ancestral Gulf of Mexico
deposited sands, shales, clays and marls in sedimentary geologic formations. Transgressive
deposits are generally clay and silty deposits making them more resistant to erosion.
Regressive deposits are generally silty and sandy and less resistant to erosion. Resistant
strata form escarpments or cuestas with rolling hills and prairies (Fisher 1965). The streams
that flowed through these hills and prairies typically had floodplains 1.6 to 16.1 kilometers
(km) (1 to 10 miles (mi)) wide. These floodplains generally occurred 30.5 to 45.7-m (100
to 150-ft) below the regular elevation of the land creating narrower floodplains where
streams cut through the cuestas (BEG 1965, 1977; Fenneman 1938).
The geologic units in the survey areas are exclusively Eocene age Queen City Sand
formation on ridge summits and back slopes with Quaternary Alluvium in the floodplain
3

(BEG 1967). Queen City formation is a regressive deposit with thin beds of clay, sandy clay,
and ironstone concretions that weather to grayish, orange and pink sandy and clayey loam.
Ferruginous ledges and rubble are common. The Quaternary alluvium is significantly
younger and, because of its location on the landscape, has the only potential for containing
deeply buried archaeological sites in colluvial deposited material from the adjacent slopes.
Unfortunately, the mapped Quaternary Alluvium is underwater near Tract 1. Tract 2 extends
into the Mud Creek floodplain; this area was inspected for cutbanks for depositional profiles
and inspected for low rises that may contain cultural resources. Refining how local geology
affects the proposed timber thinning relies on the information derived from the Web Soil
Survey (NRCS 2013).

Soils
Soils within the project area vary according to the underlying geology and position on
the landscape. The ridge summits are all Bowie fine sandy loam (BoB) and Lilbert loamy
fine sand (LtC). Backslope soils include Cuthbert fine sandy loam (CfE, CuC), Darco loamy
fine sand (DaC), and Gallime fine sandy loam (GaB) which extends to the lake shore. The
floodplains that are not inundated with water are described as Mantachie loam (Ma),
frequently flooded. According to the soil survey (NRCS 2013), Bowie and Cuthbert series
have A and E horizons of fine sandy loam between 8 and 25 cm (4 and 10 in) over a Bt horizon
of sandy clay loam. Lilbert series soils have A and E horizons of loamy fine sand 60 cm (24
in) deep over a Bt horizon of sandy clay loam. Darco series include A and E horizons of 130
cm (53 in) of loamy fine sand over a Bt horizon of clay. Gallime series includes A and E
horizons 50 cm (22 in) of fine sandy loam over a Bt horizon of sandy clay loam. Mantachie
loam has an A horizon of loam and fine sandy loam over a weak B horizon of gley colored
loam. Gley color soils are indicative of long term saturation. No buried soils were noted in
the Mantachie series description.

CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY
The project area is in the Northeast Texas Archaeological Region (Kenmotsu and
Perttula 1993). The Cultural Chronology is divided into Paleo-Indian, Archaic, Early
Ceramic, Late Prehistoric, and Historic periods. Each period was delineated by a change in
environment, technology, and/or population requiring adaptations to meet varying
circumstances. Each period is described in reference to the cultural phases within the period,
settlement patterns, subsistence, and artifacts associated with the period.

Paleo-Indian Period
The Paleo-Indian period (prior to 6000 B.C.) is the earliest generally accepted
cultural period in the New World and includes populations that inhabited North America
from the Late Pleistocene to the Early Holocene. The use of non-local materials and tool
recycling lead Story and others (1990) to suggest this population was organized into small,
mobile bands of hunters and gatherers that consumed a variety of plants and animals.
Overall, tool types are generally carefully fashioned bifacial and unifacial tools. PaleoIndian sites are typified by scattered Clovis, Scottsbluff, Dalton, San Patrice, and Plainview
projectile points. These sites are rare in the region with only one or two documented
components per county in the area. Paleo-Indian artifacts recovered in the region suggested
that early occupations were principally distributed in the valleys of major stream basins
(Perttula 1995). Waters (1992:151) suggests sites from the Paleo-Indian period are less
frequent in active floodplains because of the changes in the landscape over the last 8000 years.

Archaic
The Archaic (6000-200 B.C.) refers to hunter-gatherers who implemented more
regionally specialized approaches toward exploiting their environment. The Archaic period
is represented by three divisions: the Early, Middle, and Late Archaic during which tool
technology progressed from the large points that typify the Paleo-Indian period to the use of
sand and grog tempered ceramics and the bow and arrow in the Early Ceramic and Late
Prehistoric period. The Archaic, in general, represents a shift in subsistence as Late Archaic
sites are more abundant than Early Archaic sites as populations shifted from major streams to
minor streams and natural springs (Story et al. 1990). This increase in site count and
5

distribution throughout the Archaic suggests a successful adaptation to the environment
lasting until the development of pottery and/or the development of the bow and arrow.
Features found on sites in the Archaic include stone-lined hearths, baking pits, milling
implements, and polished stones that serve as indicators of new technologies (Story et al.
1990:213). Cemeteries date to the Archaic period as well (Story et al. 1990) and become an
integral part of the Late Archaic. When compared to Paleo-Indian artifacts, Archaic lithic
assemblages are more functionally varied; however, tool types are generally less well made
and of increasingly more local materials than the Paleo-Indian period and earlier Archaic
divisions. Projectile point types associated with the Archaic period include earlier expanded
stem (e.g., Keithville, Palmer, Kirk and Cossatot), corner-notched, and side notched points
(e.g., Big Sandy, Calf Creek , Johnson, Carrollton, and Morrill) followed by stemmed points
(e.g., Lang, Castroville, Palmillas, Ellis, Edgewood, and Yarbrough) (Story et al. 1990).

Woodland Period
The Woodland period (200 B.C.-A.D. 800) period (Perttula 2004:9), first introduced
as the Early Ceramic (Story et al. 1990:293), represented an increasing utilization of the
environment and technological changes. A number of characteristic innovations appear
during the Woodland period along with regional differences within the same environment.
In particular, there is a greater reliance on cultigens along with larger and more prolonged
occupations at specific locales. The technological innovation appearing during the Early
Ceramic period was the widespread production of pottery and the introduction of the bow
and arrow very late in the period (Story et al. 1990; Thurmond 1990). Pottery was
introduced from the Lower Mississippi Valley as the Fourche Maline culture in northeast
Texas. Plainware ceramics north of the Sabine River are clay/grog or bone temper (Williams
Plain; however, Marksville Stamped, Marksville Incised, Tchefuncte Stamped, Troyville
Stamped, and Chrupa Incised) (Story et al. 1990; Thurmond 1988; Cliff and Peter 1994:23).
South of the Sabine River ceramics are mostly plain sandy paste Mossy Grove varieties (Story
1990, Ricklis 2004:189). Recently, Black and Story (2003) described the Mill Creek culture
along the Upper Sabine River basin with pottery similar to Williams Plain but with incised
lines and punctations. Gary and Kent projectile points are common all three cultures, but
corner-notched arrow points are common north of the Sabine River (Thurmond 1990) while
6

stemmed arrow points are common to the south (Perttula 2004:376). Populations throughout
the region attempted to utilize plant resources along valley margins as sites were located along
increasingly larger landforms and covered larger areas (Corbin 1998:115).

Late Prehistoric Period
In the Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 800-1680) Smith County was in the Caddoan
cultural area. The Caddo culture was an indigenous development strongly influenced by the
Mississippian tradition of the Lower Mississippi Valley (Story et al. 1990:323; Wycoff 1971).
Caddo subsistence and social organization differed markedly from the Woodland period as
horticulture supplemented hunting and gathering followed by a diet dominated by maize,
beans, and squash.

Increasingly larger aggregates of people became sedentary and

constructed villages with public ceremonial areas. A stratified social structure developed
corresponding to the chiefdom level as first defined by Service (1962, 1975). Extensive
commercial networks were also established with hamlets and farmsteads surrounding a larger
community mound center. Settlements were mainly distributed on elevated landforms
adjacent to major streams, as well as along minor tributaries and spring-fed branches. The
Late Prehistoric Period is divided into Formative, Early, Middle, and Late Caddoan phases.
The phases indicate changes in socio-political, habitation, and material culture with
increasingly smaller regional differences. Overall, the Late Prehistoric Period to the north is
typified by a variety of arrowpoints, ground stone artifacts, and a variety of ceramic vessel
types. Formative and Early Caddo sites include maize, and populations lived in semipermanent hamlets and farmsteads (Perttula 1986:54-55). Middle Caddo sites include
increased use of planted crops, increasingly larger settlements, more and larger mounds sites,
and evidence of more social and political organization. The Late Caddo period has the
greatest regional and temporal variation which is divided into archaeological phases, e.g., the
earlier Whelan phase (ca. A.D. 1350-1450) is replaced by the later Titus phase (ca A.D. 14501650) along the upper Cypress Creek basin and the Frankston phase (ca. A.D. 1400-1650)
along the Neches and Angelina River basins (Thurmond 1990; Perttula 2004).

Historic
Although the Spanish had a presence in east Texas since the late seventeenth century,
the area that would become Smith County was not inhabited by Anglo settlers until American
traders moved into the Neches Saline area in the late 1820’s. The area was not heavily settled
until the Cherokee were removed in 1839. Smith County was officially formed on 11 April
1846 with Tyler as the County Seat. Cotton was the primary trade commodity, but corn, fruit,
and vegetables sustained the growing population.

Throughout the 1850’s the county

continued to grow as more farmers planted cotton with slave labor. The county had a diverse
economy with sawmills, gristmills, and three distilleries. Smith County voted for secession
and hosted two Confederate Camps (Camp Clough and Camp Ford) (Thoms 2000) north and
east of Tyler respectively along with a transportation depot, ordinance plant, and stockade.
Race relations were strained in Smith County into the 1870’s as the black population was
constantly harassed.

The Houston & Great Northern Railway reached Tyler in 1873

(Zlatkovich 1981:8). Three years later 33 km (21 mi) of railway connected towns across the
county. Cotton sales increased dramatically and livestock sales followed. Tyler grew with
new industries and colleges over the next 20 years. Agriculture across the county expanded
to include the sale of what had been subsistence vegetables and fruits. However, cotton still
dominated the market despite the Great Depression and boll weevil infestations in the 1930’s.
After the depression, industry steadily grew as oil exploration, a renewed military industry
(with WWII), and the lumber industry returned Smith County to prosperity (McCroskey
2012).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
The archaeological regional overview documents of primary importance are D.A.
Story's (1990) and J.A. Guy's (1990) discussions of the Gulf Coastal Plain. Additionally, the
Texas Historical Commission (THC), Department of Antiquities Protection developed a
document for the east Texas portion of the Texas State Plan (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993).
This THC document include several historic contexts each of which deal with a particular
facet of northeast Texas prehistory. This state plan synthesize the state of archaeological
research in the region and identified problems and objectives to be addressed in future
research and cultural resources management.

Several weak areas in archaeological

knowledge of the region were identified in these recent studies. Chronology, settlement
patterns, subsistence, and historic continuities were some of the general research directions
that all of these recent syntheses emphasize as important for developing future archaeological
research designs. More recently, Perttula (2004:370-408) includes the most up to date
descriptions of the region for the Caddo Cultural Area which extends from the Red River to
Angelina County in Texas.
Large-scale investigations (e.g., research within specific drainage systems and
extensive excavations on large sites) were conducted across the region providing most of the
prehistoric and historic cultural information. Substantial investigations began in the 1930s
with University of Texas surveys along major stream valleys. Later, large survey areas
included surveys and site excavations for reservoirs (e.g., Story 1965; Jelks 1958; and
Anderson 1971). These and other large area surveys over the next forty years document a
majority of the archaeological sites recorded and provide the basis for predicting site locations
across the landscape. The abundance of site data lead to studies of individual basins (e.g.,
Thurmond’s 1990 study of the Cypress Creek basin) and excavations of specific sites (e.g.,
Thom’s 2004 excavations at Camp Ford). Small-scale investigations include numerous well
and pipeline surveys for utilities, private interests and TxDot scattered across the county.
The Texas Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2013) was consulted for the locations of
known archaeological sites, National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) properties, and
State Archaeological Landmarks (SAL).

The Site Atlas shows four archaeological

investigations and nine archaeological sites within one mile of the survey areas (Appendix
B). The previous investigations include a survey along C.R. 3341 at the west end of the
9

project area by the TDHPT in 1976; a powerline right-of-way survey by Espey, Huston &
Associates (Nash et al. 1993) roughly one mile to the southwest, and two well pad surveys
by Archeological and Environmental Consultants (AEC) roughly one mile to the northeast
Perttula and Nelson 2005).
No archaeological sites were documented during the TDHPT survey. The pedestrian
survey by Nash and others (1993) was approximately 67.1 km (41.7 mi) long for a power
line right-of-way through Anderson, Cherokee, Henderson, Rusk, and Smith counties; seven
sites were recorded but none within 1.6 km (1 mi) of the current project area. AEC
conducted a survey of two well locations northeast of the project area for the Misselwhite
Gas Unit Well No.1 (Perttula and Nelson 2005).

These surveys were successful in

documenting one site (4SM213) as a Caddo artifact scatter eroding into the lake. Shovel
testing found artifacts in 11 of the 22 tests excavated in the area. Sites 41SM204, 41SM205,
41SM206, 41SM207, 41SM208, 41SM210, 41SM211 and 41SM217 were recorded but no
information on the site type recorded or artifacts found were available on the Texas
Archaeological Sites Atlas.
The results of the previous investigations shows there is potential for archaeological
sites on the elevated landforms and along the lake shore. Prehistoric sites are most likely
found on prominent landforms overlooking the lake. Artifacts can be recovered from the
surface along the shore line and in shovel tests between the surface and the Bt horizon.
Perttula and Nelson (2005) recommended site 41SM213 be monitored by the City of Tyler
to ensure the area was not looted, but no determination of NRHP eligibility was made for
the site.

10

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
DETAC performed these investigations in accordance with the procedural rules of
the Texas Antiquities Code, the CTA Guidelines for Professional Performance (2005a), and
the ethical codes of conduct described by the Texas Archaeological Society and the Register
of Professional Archaeologists. No new roads will be constructed, but logging vehicles and
equipment will move freely among remaining trees disturbing the ground surface. No
thinning will be conducted within 30 m (100 ft) of the lake shore.
Research began with a literature review for material pertinent to the project area.
The literature review included: reading archaeological and historical publications on the
Texas Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2013); reviewing any information concerning
historical, geomorphological, and archaeological information at the Stephen F. Austin State
University Library in Nacogdoches, Texas; and obtaining digital data from the Texas
Natural Resources Information System (TNRIS 2013).
To aid in the survey, high and low probability areas were determined by combining
the previous site information with topographic and soils data. Previous investigations in the
area documented archaeological sites from the Archaic and Late prehistoric periods on
prominent landforms overlooking the lake. Research shows that artifacts can be recovered
from the surface along the shore line and in shovel tests between the surface and the Bt
horizon. Most previously recorded sites were lithic scatters with several artifacts recovered
in over half of the excavated shovel tests in a site area. Based on this information, high
probability areas were prominent landforms overlooking the lake. Expected sites should
contain numerous artifacts in several shovel tests.
The pedestrian survey was conducted using a visual assessment and shovel testing.
The visual assessment was a continuous effort between shovel tests, in low-lying areas, and
in the creek floodplain. The visual assessment of the floodplain focused on finding elevated
areas not visible on the topographic maps. Overturned trees, burrowing animal disturbances,
lake shores, and unimproved roads were also examined for artifacts on the surface. Shovel
tests were excavated at 30 m (100 ft) intervals or less in high probability areas and in
accordance with the THC’s guidelines for cultural resources surveys. Upon finding an
artifact, archaeologists excavated shovel tests at 10 m (33 ft) intervals in the cardinal
directions until two consecutive negative shovel tests or the landform (e.g., steep slope)
11

determined the site boundary. Shovel tests were approximately 30 cm (12 in) square. Shovel
testing included excavating in 10 cm (4 in) increments to the Bt horizon or to 90+ cm. All
excavated matrix was screened through 0.64 cm (0.25 in) hardwire cloth. The depth, soil
texture, color, and any artifacts from each shovel test were recorded as part of a GPS
position with 1 to 3 m (3 to 10 ft) accuracy.
Copies of the draft report were provided to the THC for review following CTA
Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports (2005b). Upon completion of
consultation, a final report was prepared incorporating any comments provided by the THC.
Final digital and hard copies of the report will be provided to the THC for inclusion in the
Texas Archaeological Site Atlas.

RESULTS
Field Investigations were conducted between 2 August and 6 September 2013.
Shovel testing and visual examination of the project area included walking transects across
the property, making notes on surface disturbance, and shovel testing at low and high
probability intervals. Forest Stewardship Area 7 (FSA 7) included two tracts (1 and 2) at
the southwest corner of Lake Tyler East. Tract 1 spans the channel connecting Lake Tyler
West and Lake Tyler East. Six landforms in Tract 1 were shovel tested while the shore line
and low-lying areas were inspected for artifacts. Tract 2 is located south of the Lake Tyler
East dam and access road. Two areas were identified as needing shovel testing; however,
additional shovel tests were excavated in the Mud Creek floodplain after the initial visit to
the project area. Topography, vegetation, soils, and pedestrian survey results are described
for each tract.

Tract 1
Tract 1 included 30.5 ha. (75 ac.) spanning the channel connecting the two lakes.
The western boundary is defined by C.R. 3341; the eastern boundary is Lake Tyler East; the
northern boundary is a private property boundary; and the southern boundary is the dam
access road from C.R. 3341 (Figure 2). Modern features in the tract include the channel
which bisects the tract from east to west and a pipeline. The closest previously recorded
sites are 41SM206, 41SM207, and 41SM208. All three sites were recorded along a series
of low islands overlooking the lake east of the project area. None of the islands are in the
project area.
Vegetation in Tract 1 is dominated by mixed hardwood and pine forest with a
moderate understory of bushes, shrubs, and vines. Ground cover is leaf litter. Vegetation
along the lake shore is dense grass with bushes, briars, and small trees along the treeline.
No shore line was visible; instead, the edge of the lake was a marsh with tall grasses. Soils
in Tract 1 were described as Bowie fine sandy loam and Lilbert loamy fine sand along the
upland ridges with Cuthbert fine sandy loam and Darco loamy fine sand along the
backslopes.

No floodplain was present in Tract 1; however, low areas were noted along the
channel. Inspection of the low-lying areas was conducted along east-west transects while
traversing the areas between the access point on the west end of the project area and the
survey areas along the lake shore.

The inspection found the low-lying areas were

crisscrossed with shallow drainage channels and cleared areas where surface water cleared
deadfall and leaf litter but had not formed a channel. A pipeline right-of-way was noted
between Survey Areas 1 and 2.
Survey Area 1 is in the northwest corner of the Tract. A total of 2.6 ha (6.4 ac) was
shovel tested on the summit and shoulder of a narrow upland ridge. Twenty-two shovel
tests (1-22) were excavated in the area (Figure 2 and Appendix A). Soils ranged from 30
cm (12 in) deep on the slope shoulders to 90 cm (36 in) deep on the ridge summit. No
artifacts were collected and cultural features were noted. Scattered modern trash was
observed near the west end of the survey area.
Survey Area 2 is in the north-central portion of the Tract. A total of 5.6 ha (13.8
ac) was shovel tested on the summit and shoulder of a narrow upland ridge. The visual
inspection found a shallow road cut along the ridge summit; the road cut lead toward a
phone outlet observed in Area 3 (Figure 3). Twenty-nine shovel tests (23-51) were
excavated across the survey area (Figure 2 and Appendix A). Soils ranged from 20 cm (8
in) deep on the slope shoulders to 90 cm (36 in) deep on the ridge summit. No artifacts
were collected; however, scattered modern trash was noted near the north end of the
survey area.
Survey Area 3 is along the eastern end of the Tract overlooking the lake. A total of
5.2 ha (13 ac) was shovel tested on the summit and shoulder of a narrow upland ridge.
Forty-five shovel tests (52-97) (Figure 2 and Appendix A) were excavated across the survey
area; two transects of tests were excavated at 30 m (100 ft) intervals close to the lake shore
and a third transect of tests was excavated at 50 m (160 ft) intervals to the west. Soils ranged
from 30 cm (12 in) deep in low-lying areas close to the lake shore to 80 cm (32 in) deep on
elevated sandy areas. No artifacts or cultural features were noted, but several modern trash
piles and a telephone outlet box was found near the southern end of the area.

Survey Area 4 includes the summit and shoulder of a narrow upland ridge south of
the channel near the west end of the Tract. The pipeline noted between survey Areas 1 and
2 crosses Survey Area 4. Eleven shovel tests (127-137) were excavated in the 1.1 ha (2.8
ac) area (Figure 2 and Appendix A). Soils ranged from 20 cm (8 in) deep near the road on
the south end of the survey area to 60 cm (24 in) deep on the on the ridge summit. No
artifacts or cultural features were noted.
Survey Area 5 is in the south-central portion of the Tract between the channel and
dam access road. A total of 2.3 ha (5.7 ac) was shovel tested on the summit and shoulder
of an upland ridge. Twenty-seven shovel tests (110-126) (Figure 2 and Appendix A) were
excavated in soils between 10 cm (4 in) and 80 cm (32 in) deep. Deeper shovel tests were
found on the shoulder of the landform closer to the lake shore. No artifacts or cultural
features were noted.
Survey Area 6 is south of the channel and immediately west of the Lake Tyler East
dam. Ten shovel tests (98-107) (Figure 2 and Appendix A) were excavated in the 1.3 ha
(3.1 ac) area. Shovel tests were excavated on the summit and shoulder of an upland ridge
entirely within a stand of planted pine trees. Soils ranged from 10 cm (4 in) to 60 cm (24
in) deep on the ridge summit. A telephone outlet similar to the one found Survey Area 3
was found near the lake shore. No artifacts or cultural features were noted.
In summary, Tract 1 was investigated with shovel testing in six survey areas and a
visual inspection of the low-lying areas. Shovel testing found sandy loam soils with various
depths and color but no prehistoric or historic cultural material. The visual inspection found
several modern trash piles along with a road cut in Survey Area 2 and telephone outlets in
Survey Areas 3 and 6. No further work is recommended for Tract 1.

Tract 2
Tract 2 included 19.4 ha. (47.9 ac) spanning the summit, shoulder, and toe slope of
an upland ridge along with the adjoining floodplain south of the Lake Tyler East dam and
west of Mud Creek. The northern boundary is the dam access road; the eastern and southern
boundaries are fence lines; and the western boundary is private property (Figure 4). Modern
features in the tract include a well pad, access road, and pipeline. The closest previously
recorded sites were 41SM206, 41SM207, and 41SM208. All three sites were recorded north
17

of the dam along a series of low islands overlooking the lake northeast of the project area.
Shovel testing focused on finding similar landforms in the floodplain south of the dam.
Vegetation in Tract 2 varies between the uplands and the floodplain. The uplands
include patches of mixed hardwood and pine and patches of planted pine trees. The
lowlands include mixed hardwood and pine forest with a moderate understory of bushes,
shrubs, and vines in the floodplain. Ground cover is leaf litter. Soils in Tract 2 range from
Cuthbert fine sandy loam and Gallime fine sandy loam on the uplands.

Lowland

(floodplain) soils were Mantachie loam.
Shovel testing in the floodplain began on the toe slope and progressed toward the
fenceline at the eastern boundary. The intermittent stream on the topographic map was
diverted to a channel that paralleled the fence line. No clear rises were obvious in the
floodplain. A total of 27 tests (1-24, 28, 29) (Figure 4 and Appendix A) were excavated
across the 5.5 ha (13.5 ac) floodplain to find deeper sandy soils. Shovel testing found that
soils averaged 30 cm (12 in) fine sandy loam and silt loam. No artifacts were collected and
cultural features were noted.
Survey Area 1 covered the uplands west of the floodplain south of the lake dam
access road/powerline corridor. An oil/gas well pad was built on the shoulder and slope of
the highest ridge in the survey area and a pipeline crosses the area. Visual examination of
the uplands found the area highly disturbed; several cuts and piled earth were observed
among mature pine trees. Understory was various bushes and shrubs and ground cover
was almost exclusively pine straw. The large amount of ground disturbance limited the
areas where a “natural” ground surface was available for shovel testing. The only area
with a higher potential for containing intact cultural deposits was a narrow ridge along the
southern boundary of the survey area. A total of 19 shovel tests (30-48) (Figure 2 and
Appendix A) were excavated in the 6.7 ha (16.5 ac) area. Soils on the narrow ridge were
mostly yellowish brown gravelly sandy loam 10 to 50 cm (4 to 20 in) deep. Soils across
the remainder of the uplands ranged from 10 cm of red cobbly sandy loam to 60 cm of
pale brown loamy sand. No artifacts were found in the shovel tests or surface inspection
and no cultural features were found.

Survey Area 2 follows the shoulder of an upland ridge at the southernmost point of
Tract 2. A fenceline follows a road cut along the edge of the ridge. Five shovel tests (2227) (Figure 2 and Appendix A) were excavated along the shoulder and summit of the ridge
north of the fenceline. Soils ranged from 20 cm (8 in) of yellowish brown sandy loam to 40
cm (28 in) of light brown sandy loam over clay. No artifacts were found in the shovel tests.
The only cultural feature was the road cut.
In summary, Tract 2 was investigated with shovel testing in two survey areas and
the floodplain. The observed topographic and modern features suggested the floodplain
was less disturbed than the adjacent uplands. Shovel testing on the two ridges and across
the floodplain found deeper sandy soils with fewer modern impacts in the floodplain. No
artifacts were found in shovel testing; no further work is recommended for Tract 1.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The City of Tyler is thinning timber in Forest Stewardship Area 7 at the southwest
corner of Lake Tyler East in Smith County, Texas. DETAC acquired Texas Antiquities
Permit #6600 and all terms of the permit were carried out pursuant of the Texas Antiquities
Code.
These tracts included ridge summits and shoulders overlooking the lake and a
portion of the Mud Creek floodplain south of the lake dam. The archaeological survey
included shovel testing of the upland and floodplain with a visual examination between
shovel tests and in low-lying areas between ridges. All timber thinning will be more than
30 m (100 ft) from the lake shore.
Shovel testing and visual examination did not record any archaeological sites in the
project area. Several modern trash piles, a road cut, and two telephone outlets suggest
portions of Tract 1 were utilized or prepared for modern use. The archaeological survey of
Tract 2 was almost a mirror of the proposed work; the uplands were highly disturbed and
contained shallow soils while the floodplain contained deeper sandy and silty soils with less
modern disturbances. Shovel tests focused on the floodplain and two narrow ridges
overlooking the floodplain.
The archaeological survey did not record any archaeological sites. No further
archaeological work is recommended for the proposed timber thinning in FSA 7. DETAC
requests concurrence with a determination of “no effect” to properties listed or eligible to
the NRHP for the proposed timber thinning operations in FSA 7. If any artifacts, bones, or
dark greasy soils are found, then work should stop in the immediate area and both the THC
and DETAC should be contacted immediately.
