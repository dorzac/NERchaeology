ABSTRACT
Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) conducted an archaeological
survey at two construction sites (areas A and B) along the coast in Matagorda
County, Texas. When completed, Area A (42 acres) will contain a boat canal
and lots to be sold as house sites. Thirteen acres in Area B (20 acres) will be
converted into wetlands as a “trade off” for a wetlands area that will be destroyed
through construction of the 42-acre tract. The northern two-thirds of the 42-acre
tract had been scraped to clay and cleared of vegetation prior to this study, and
some construction had already begun. The 20-acre tract, planned for conversion
to a wetlands area was covered with grass.
A 100% Pedestrian Survey was conducted on both tracts, and the
subsurface of each area was examined through shovel testing and backhoe
trenching. Although oyster shell was observed on the surface in three areas of
the 42-acre tract, no prehistoric artifacts were present. It is hypothesized that
some of the shell was originally associated with a road culvert in the northeast
corner of the tract. The remaining areas of shell are interpreted as natural
occurrences.
According to local informants, a barn and corral were once present in the
northeast corner of Tract A. These features were constructed over 50 years ago,
but have been demolished and burned. Therefore, they could not be evaluated.
The only information regarding this historic site was found in the scattered
surface debris and through a personal communication with a former resident of
the area.
Although a historic site may have been present in the 42-acre tract, no
cultural resources remain that are significant. No evidence of a prehistoric or
historic site was found in Tract B. It is, therefore, recommended that construction
be allowed to proceed as planned. No artifacts were collected.

INTRODUCTION
Mike Mobley, a local developer, plans to convert a 42-acre tract (Area A)
into a residential area complete with boat canal and house lots known as the
Edward David Estates in south-central Matagorda County (Figure 1). As a direct
result of this construction, 13 acres of wetlands in the southern portion of the
tract will be affected. In order to compensate for this loss, 13 acres of new
wetlands will be created in a 20-acre tract (Area B) to the northeast. Figure 2
depicts the location of areas A and B. The permit application number for this
project assigned by the COE is 23521.
In order to create a boat canal in Area A, a 150-foot wide trench will be
dug to a depth of 13 feet from the ground surface to the bottom of the canal. The
excavated area will be protected from erosion by a steel bulkhead along the
Intracoastal Waterway and 180 feet into the proposed boat canal. The bulkhead
along the boat canal will consist of concrete panels for the remaining distance.
Three feet of earth will be removed from a 13-acre portion of Area B.
The project area is bounded on the north by County Road 259 (Old Gulf
Road), on the east by coastal plain and wetlands, on the west by the Matagorda
Harbor levee, and on the south by the Intracoastal Waterway. This area is
depicted on the U.S.G.S. 7.5’ topographic quadrangle Matagorda, Texas (2895323).

ENVIRONMENT
Matagorda County is located in the southeastern part of Texas along the
Gulf of Mexico. It lies in two major land resource areas, the Gulf Coast Prairies
and the Gulf Coast Saline Prairies. The county is roughly rectangular in shape
and covers about 888,173 acres. The landscape in the county is generally broad
and nearly level. Sloping areas are typically next to the Colorado River, Tres
Palacios River. Caney Creek, Peyton Creek, and Wilson Creek. Overall, the land
slopes upward from the southeast to the northwest, and elevation rises from sea
level at the Gulf of Mexico to over 70 feet at points along the Wharton County
line. Most drainage flows to the south and southeast through the rivers, sloughs,
and bayous that dissect the county.
Soils belonging to two soil series are present in the project area. These
are the Livia-Palacios-Francitas and Harris-Velasco-Placedo series, dominantly
clayey soils found on coastal lowlands (Hyde 2002:General Soil Map).
Specifically, five types are present. They are the Francitas clay, 0 to 1 percent
slopes (FrA), Ijam clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes (ImB), Livia loam, 0 to 1 percent
slopes (LvA), Palacios loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes (PaA), and Placedo silty clay,
frequently flooded (Pc). All five types are located within Area A, and PaA soils
occupy all of Area B.
FrA is a very deep, saline, clayey soil found on nearly level coastal
uplands. The source of this soil is related to saline parent material or flooding by
sea water during high tides. Typically, the surface layer is very dark gray, slightly
saline, moderately alkaline clay about six inches thick. From a depth of about 55
inches, the subsoil is a clay that is black in the upper part and grades to grayishbrown in the lower part. Between 55 and 80 inches, the subsoil is light yellowishbrown clay in the upper part and a yellowish-red silty clay loam in the lower part.
The subsoil is saline in the upper part and moderately alkaline throughout. This
soil is poorly drained. Permeability and surface are very slow, and available
water capacity is low or moderate because of high sodium content. A perched
water table is within a depth of two feet during rainy periods. This soil is present
within the central portion of Area A. This discussion was taken from the soil
survey for Matagorda County (Hyde 2002:35-36).
ImB is a very deep, very gently sloping soil that forms in material dredged
from the channel of the Intracoastal Waterway. There is a distinct break between
the stratified Ijam soil and an underlying darker colored soil, and this is
observable all along the Waterway. Typically, the surface layer is grayish-brown,
moderately saline and moderately alkaline clay about six inches thick. Between
6 and 63 inches, the underlying material is a moderately saline and moderately
alkaline, mottled clay that has strata in colors of dark grayish-brown, grayishbrown, and olive gray. Between 63 and 80 inches, the underlying material is a
moderately alkaline, stratified sandy clay and sandy clay loam that is dark brown
in the upper part and yellowish-red in the lower part.

This soil is poorly drained and permeability is very slow. Surface runoff is
rapid. The degree of salinity is dependent on the original salinity of the dredged
material and the length of time since dredging. The water table is at the surface
in some areas and as deep as three feet in other areas. This soil is present in
the wetlands portion of Area A. This discussion was taken from the soil survey
for Matagorda County (Hyde 2002:38).
LvA is a very deep, nearly level, saline, loamy soil that forms on ancient
stream meander ridges on broad coastal uplands. Typically, it is at an elevation
of 10 to 40 feet above sea level. The surface layer normally consists of a dark
grayish-brown, slightly saline, slightly alkaline loam about six inches thick. The
subsoil extends to a depth of approximately 61 inches. From a depth of 6 to 47
inches, it is saline, moderately alkaline clay that is very dark gray in the upper
part, dark grayish-brown in the next part, and grayish-brown in the lower part.
Between 47 and 61 inches, it is light brownish-gray, slightly saline, moderately
alkaline clay. The underlying material, 61 to 80 inches, is a pale olive, slightly
saline, moderately alkaline clay that has grayish mottles. This soil is poorly
drained, and surface runoff and permeability are very slow. Available water
capacity is moderate, but high sodium content makes this soil “droughty” during
dry periods. It is saturated at times during rainy periods in winter months. This
soil is present in the center portion of Area A. This discussion was taken from
the soil survey for Matagorda County (Hyde 2002:43).
PaA is a very deep, nearly level, saline, loamy soil that forms on ancient
stream meander ridges on broad coastal uplands. Typically, this soil is found at
an elevation of 10 to 40 feet above sea level. A typical surface layer consists of
a neutral, very dark grayish-brown loam about five inches thick. The upper part
of the subsoil, between 5 and 13 inches, is a black, slightly alkaline clay loam.
The lower part, from a depth of 13 to 72 inches, is a moderately saline or slightly
saline, slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline clay. It is a very dark gray and grades
to light gray and light brownish-gray with increasing depth. The subsoil has
yellowish and brownish mottles below a depth of 25 inches. The underlying
material, between 72 and 80 inches, is a yellowish-brown, moderately alkaline
silty clay loam. This soil is poorly drained, and surface runoff and permeability
are very slow. Available water capacity is moderate, but high sodium content
makes this soil “droughty” except during rainy seasons. It is saturated at times
during the winter. This soil is found in the northern part of Area A and is the only
soil type present in Area B. This discussion was taken from the soil survey for
Matagorda County (Hyde 2002:45-46).

5

PC is a very deep, saline, clayey soil that forms on nearly level to weakly
concave flood plains along the coast. A high water table fluctuates from above
the surface to a depth of about 12 inches, and ponding is common. A typical
surface layer is dark gray, strongly saline, moderately alkaline silty clay and clay
about 31 inches thick with brownish mottles. The underlying material, from a
depth of 31 to 62 inches, is a gray, strongly saline and moderately alkaline clay
loam with yellowish mottles. This soil is very poorly drained. Permeability is very
slow, and surface runoff is very slow or ponded. The water table is at or near the
surface most of the time. This soil is frequently flooded for durations of seven
days to a month by runoff from nearby uplands, by daily or monthly high tides,
and by storm tides. This soil is present in the wetlands portion of Area A. This
discussion was taken from the soil survey for Matagorda County authored by
(Hyde 2002:46-47).

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Prehistoric Period
Matagorda County is located in a portion of Southeast Texas where few
systematic and professional archaeological investigations were conducted prior
to the 1970s. The first documented archaeological report from Matagorda Bay
consists of field notes written by A. M. Woolsey working under the Anthropology
Department of The University of Texas at Austin during the 1930s. In July of
1932, Woolsey and his crew spent five days working at the Battle Island site
(41MG1) in Matagorda County (Woolsey 1932:43-45). This site represents the
location of a battle between a band of Karankawa Indians and a company of
volunteers led by Captain Ayeltt E. Buckner in 1826. This site is along the
Intracoastal Waterway about 3500 meters east of the current project area.
The next large-scale project was conducted by G. E. Arnold, a field
archaeologist from The University of Texas at Austin, in 1941. He spent one
month conducting a reconnaissance along the coast in Matagorda and adjacent
counties. Arnold (1941:1) reported one village campsite and three shell middens.
In 1950, the probable location of La Salle’s Fort Saint Louis and the first
location of Presidio Nuestra Senora de Loreto de la Bahia (Keeran site) were
excavated by the Texas Memorial Museum of Austin, Texas. Unfortunately, the
results were never published, and the field notes are no longer available.
Kathleen Gilmore (1973), working through the Texas Historical Commission,
published a report concerning this site.
In 1965, Dee Ann Story and Doris Olds conducted an archaeological
survey between the channels of the Lavaca and Navidad rivers several miles
above their confluence. Three prehistoric sites and four historic sites were
recorded. One of the Indian sites (Anaqua) was excavated under the direction of
Dr. Story in 1967. That work represents the only systematic excavation of a
prehistoric site ever conducted in the Matagorda Bay area.
In 1967, the Texas Archeological Salvage Project (TASP) recorded five
archaeological sites in the Palmetto Bend Reservoir area (Wakefield 1968),
Their research was designed to compare site density of the freshwater reservoir
area with that of the higher salinity environment closer to the Lavaca Bay margin.
As a result, their study recorded five sites in the Matagorda Bay survey area
outside their survey area.

During the period 1972 – 1973, three target areas in Calhoun, Jackson,
and Matagorda counties were examined by archaeologists from the Texas
Archeologidal Survey (Fritz 1976). This effort recorded four prehistoric sites
(41MG7 – 41MG10) in a marshy area north of the Intracoastal Waterway. Fritz
describes two of these sties as shell middens, and the remaining two as areas
containing prehistoric artifacts with little or no shell present. This large
concentration of aboriginal sites is between 3000 and 4000 meters to the
northeast of the current project area.
The most recent professional investigation in the area was a survey of the
area along the Intracoastal Waterway for the United States Army Corps of
Engineers, Galveston District by Prewitt & Associates, Inc. in 2002. According to
E. Francis Gados, the report has been written but remains unpublished. This
survey revisited one shell midden (41MG2) and recorded two previously
unreported shell middens (41MG123 and 41MG124).
Two reports which provide histories and maps of past surveys and
excavations along the entire Texas coast have been prepared by Aten (1971)
and Briggs (1971). Both of these publications deal with the problem of site
destruction and include recommendations for mitigating damage in the future.
Additional sources are the well-researched book by Lawrence E. Aten (1983), a
bibliography of the Southern Coastal Corridor Region of Texas by Gail Bailey
(1987), and the Abstracts in Texas Contract Archeology series published by the
Texas Historical Commission (1987-1992).
Historic Period
Matagorda County is one of the 23 original counties in Texas. It was
created in 1836 and organized in 1837. American colonists founded the port
town of Matagorda in the 1820s on the east side of the Colorado River
overlooking Matagorda Bay. Stephen F. Austin brought 300 families to Texas in
1823, and 53 of these families settled in what is now Matagorda County.
Matagorda was reported by a representative of the Mexican government to be
the third largest town in the Province of Texas in 1835. The community of
Matagorda was a prominent seaport and a major port for Texas immigrants.
From 1840 to 1865, it ranked to Galveston as a leading port on the Texas coast.
By the 1870s, the construction of railroads to the Brazos River and the increased
use of other nearby ports lessened Matagorda’s importance as a seaport. The
town of Matagorda had a cotton gin in 1825, the largest sugar mill in the state
before 1860, and a gristmill in 1859. Rice, fruit, and vegetables are important
crops, and oil and sulphur deposits have been developed in recent years. In
addition fishing and hunting adds to the local economy. The population of the
county was 20,066 in 1940, 21,519 in 1950, and 37,828 according to the 1980
census figures.

METHODS
Prior to conducting this survey, the site records at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas were checked for the presence of
previously recorded sites in the project area and vicinity. In addition, a review of
the literature for the region was conducted in order to become familiar with recent
work in the area and the types of sites recorded in the county. When possible,
the project area was examined by a 100% Pedestrian Survey in an attempt to
locate surface indications of prehistoric and historic sites. The field survey was
documented by a Kodak 4 mega pixel digital camera, various forms for use in the
field, and a daily journal.
Area A
This area consists of an upland margin or shoreline (29 acres) bounded
on the south by a 13 acre area designated as wetlands (Figure 3). The total area
is 42 acres.
The 29 acres that make up the upland portion of this tract have been
previously disturbed prior to the field survey (figures 4-5). Much of the area had
been scraped and bulldozed. Between 6 and 18 inches of soil have been
removed, and no topsoil or native vegetation was present in this area at the time
of this survey. The deepest excavation was in the proposed boat canal where
soil had been re-deposited along both sides of the channel cut. Two large topsoil
stockpiles occupied a part of the project area, and a smaller pile of soils and
debris from the barn and corral were also present. These accumulations
obscured the ground surface; therefore, the ground surface beneath these piles
could not be examined. Concrete bulkhead sections had been prepared and
stored on site. The ground surface in these areas could not be examined as
well. According to local informants, a barn and corral used to be present in the
northeast corner of this tract. It is believed that these features were demolished
and burned prior to this survey.
The subsurface was examined through 20 shovel tests and 4 backhoe
trenches (Figure 6). Fifteen shovel tests were placed randomly in the upland
portion of the tract, and five shovel tests were excavated in the wetlands area
where shell was observed. Each test was excavated in arbitrary 10 cm levels
and varied from 10 to 30 cm in depth. All matrix was screened using ¼”
hardware cloth. Shovel test data were recorded in the daily journal and on a
shovel test log (Appendix I).

Figure 5. Disturbance in Area A
The four backhoe trenches were excavated within the footprint of the
proposed boat canal. They were dug with a trackhoe with a four-foot wide
bucket. This produced a wide trench with an excellent view of the profiles. Each
trench was dug to the water table, and several collapsed during the excavation.
The dimensions for the four backhoe trenches in Area A are 10 meters long and
between two and three meters deep. Backhoe Trench 3 is depicted in Figure 7.
The Project Archaeologist examined the profiles (Appendix II) and photographed
and monitored backhoe excavation. In addition, soil samples of each stratum
were taken. Control was achieved by the use of a hand-held Garmin Map 76
GPS system. At the time of this investigation, small, low water-filled areas,
grasses, and shrubs covered the thirteen acres that were virtually undisturbed.
No backhoe trenches were excavated in this low, marshy area.

Area B
This is an upland area that is twenty acres in size and adjacent to a
marshy area to the east (Figure 8). At the time of this investigation, the only
observed disturbance was the removal of natural vegetation sometime prior to
acquisition by the Applicant. Ten shovel tests and two backhoe trenches were
excavated in the area where soil will be removed (Figure 6). Each shovel test
was excavated in arbitrary 10 cm levels and varied from 30 to 40 cm in depth. All
matrix was screened using ¼” hardware cloth. Shovel test data were recorded in
the daily journal and on a shovel test log (Appendix I). The two trenches in this
area were dug with a backhoe with a two-foot wide bucket. The dimensions of
the trenches were 10 meters long and 2 meters deep. The Project Archaeologist
examined the profiles (Appendix II) and photographed and monitored backhoe
excavation. Backhoe Trench 6 is illustrated in Figure 9. In addition, soil samples
of each stratum were taken. Control was achieved by the use of a hand-held
Garmin Map 76 GPS system.

RESULTS
The archival researched identified the presence of the historic Matagorda
Cemetery on the north side of County Road 259 just to the northeast of the
project area. The oldest graves in this cemetery date to the 1830s. Additionally,
the site of Fort St. Louis on Matagorda Bay and a battle site between the local
settlers and the Karankawa Indians are located in the area. In addition to the
better-known historic Indian groups in this part of Texas, the French explorer
Joutel encountered a group of Ebahamo Indians living along the lower Colorado
River near Fort St. Louis who told him about a band who were known as the
Spicheat Indians. It is reported that the Spicheat lived between Matagorda Bay
and the Colorado River (Webb 1952).
No prehistoric sites were found in either Area A or Area B. Oyster shell
was observed in three locations: (1) barn and corral area, (2) edge of the
Intracoastal Waterway, and (3) edge of the wetlands in Area A. As debris
associated with the barn and corral was moved across Area A, shell and historic
artifacts were spread throughout the northern and western parts of Area A.
Based on a discussion with local resident Doris Moberly and the results of
the field survey, it was concluded that the shell in the barn and corral area were
originally deposited during construction of the culvert associated with County
Road 259. Shovel tests revealed that the shell along the edge of the Intracoastal
Waterway was only present on the surface. No cultural materials were found in
any of these shovel tests. The shell at the interface of the wetlands and upland
area (Area A) was found to be a shell hash, an indicator of a wave deposition
along a former shoreline. Shovel tests and surface inspection did not yield any
cultural materials. No evidence of prehistoric utilization of the project area was
found in any of the six backhoe trenches.
The demolished and burned remains of a historic site were found within
the northeast corner of Area A where a barn and corral dating to the 1940s is
reported to have been present. In the field, evidence of this site was noted in the
form of 20th century artifacts (ceramic floor tiles, metal pipe, white ware, amber
glass, clear glass, burned timbers, roofing tin, plastic, and brick fragments), some
of which were scattered across the northern and western portions of Area A as a
result of pushing of earth and debris during land clearing. According to local
resident, Doris Moberly who is 84 years old, the ceramic tiles were stored in the
barn and never used. She stated that her husband, Oscar Moberly and the
landowner (Mr. Dumbar), constructed the barn in the late 1940s.
The Dumbar residence was located to the east and outside the project
area. It was constructed by the Dumbar family who owned the land prior to 1919
and until recently when it was purchased by Mrs. Moberly.

15

Mrs. Moberly also stated that she never found any Indian artifacts in the
area, and she had no knowledge of artifacts being found by others. According to
her, prior to construction of the Intracoastal Waterway, the Bay Shore was part of
the project area that is now designated as wetlands.

16

RECOMENDATIONS
No evidence of a prehistoric site was found within the project area, and no
intact historic site is present. Therefore, it is recommended that construction be
allowed to proceed as planned. Should evidence of a prehistoric or historic site
be encountered during construction, especially in Area B, work must cease until
the COE and THC can evaluate the situation.
