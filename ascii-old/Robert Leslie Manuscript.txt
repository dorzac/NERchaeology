CHAPTER 1 THE TWO PITROOMS
(ROOM NO. 1 AND ROOM NO. 2)
VISIBLE SURFACE FEATURES

I was first taken out to the site by two fellow members of the Lea County Archeological Society
(a newly formed amateur group) who had been screening off and on for about a year in one
(Refuse Area A) visible trash mounds. This was in the spring of 1959.
At this time a large amount of digging had taken place in what is designated as “Refuse Area A
and B” in this report. Area A had the most disturbance. Although I was told that originally a
mound slightly higher than the surrounding surface was visible, none was noticeable at this
time. Area B however did appear to be 18 to 24 inches higher than the surrounding surface in
the south portion where there was only a small amount of disturbance. All of the diggers
apparently were saving only the “Goodies” as the screened piles were full of bone and sherds. A
few small “Pot holes” were scattered around the site area but nothing to indicate any added
features was noticed. The only thing visible on the undisturbed surface of the site was an
occasional piece of burned caliche rock and examining real close a small bone sliver or a small
sherd was noted. The most interesting was two pits that had been dug to west of Refuse B near
the edge of the escarpment. One designated as Pit 1 was about 3 feet deep and dug through
concentrated trash deposits. The east side of the pit was what possibly could be a pitroom wall.
Pit number 2 was a few feet west of Pit 1 and was also about 3 feet deep and dug through trash
and concentrated bone especially along the bottom.

Excavations
The following Saturday after my first visit to the site and after discussions with some of the other
members of the LCAS and deciding to try and salvage some of the information from the site
before it was completely destroyed, a crew of four began working in Room 1. This continued off
and on over a period of about 12 months before the room was completed, with a lot of help from
a lot of unknown “diggers”. The number in the crew during this time varied from 2 to 6.

ROOM 1
When we began excavating in Room 1 we started expanding the two previously dug pits, I and 2
(Figure 1.1). It was soon discovered that the fill had an excellent stratigraphy that was very
visible end easily separated. This is discussed in “The stratigraphy of Room 1” (Figure 1.5).

Realizing that we would not be able to use established procedures in excavating the complete
room area layer by layer as we were sure to have a lot of disturbance because of so many digging
on the site of which we had no control. We decided to remove it by the stratas or zones A to I in
sections 12 inches or wider depending on how much time we had and was needed to take from
the surface down about 3 ½ feet to what appeared to be a floor surface (later upper floor). A small
section with a complete vertical control would possibly produce better information than a larger
area with the information from only one zone and if we were lucky maybe two. Each zone was
first troweled and then sifted through a ¼ inch mesh screen. Some unusual areas or pockets were
sifted through a 1/8 mesh. All materials was sacked and labeled as to the zone found.
My son Mark and I were expanding Pit 1 to the south along the east end of room. Here we found
that Zone A cover a concentrated trash deposit that appeared to have been dumped into the room
all along the east end. This deposit, designated as Zone C extended all the way down to the upper
floor, zone F.
To obtain a vertical distribution within this trash deposit we excavated a section 5 feet by 5 feet
by 3 ½ feet deep in 6 inch levels. The same procedure was used as in the other parts of the room
except it was by 6 inch levels and not by zones. The remaining portion of the trash deposit was
excavated and recorded as Zone C. The section taken off in 6 inch levels is reported as “C-2” and
the data given Vertical Distribution of Artifacts from Zone C-2.
We were able to continue without any outside disturbance for five straight Saturdays. We were
able to remove a large portion of the fill above and including the upper floor with good control.
This was a wide area through the center of room and along the east end (Figure 1.2 and Figure
1.4).
We always kept all of the excavated screened dirt cleared out of the room. When left our last time
out we left our excavated area clear and clean including the floor area. So what we found our next
time out came as quite a shock. (See Figure 1.3). Someone had been screening in the room,
mostly along the south side and west end leaving the room full of their screened dirt. They
apparently had undermined the harder upper portion zone A and screened the lower fill which
was a lot softer as well as much more productive in artifacts. Sometime after they left and before
we returned to the site all of this top zone A that had been undermined fell off in large sections
into the room on top of their screened dirt. All of the bone and pottery sherds were still in the
screened dirt so they only kept the good artifacts. Most of this remained in the room for some
time and as it crumble up in small pieces we screened some of it. Most of it was eventually
shoveled out of the room un-screened. Zone A had very little cultural material.
After this we changed our operations. We were no longer able to have any control of our
excavations. We also decided to play the same game as the other “diggers” and from then on we
only removed what dirt was necessary to excavate a small area at a time. Before we left we were
sure to leave as much in the room as when we started that day. This process had a lot to be
desired but if they got in the room and began digging up what was left they would have all that

dirt to contend with. This may have helped and although we had several incidence where they
dug in the room it was usually in small amounts.

1.
The remaining portion of Zone C was not disturbed, only a lot of screened dirt thrown over parts
of it. We were able to finish excavating it without any more damage. Most of the area along the
north wall was removed with only a small amount of disturbance. This was no longer separated as
to zone and was recorded as upper fill or upper floor. As we cleared portions of the floor we
examined it closely for features. We had already uncovered two fire hearths on the floor. One was
near the center of room, 3 ½ feet out from the east wall. It was still pretty intact or undisturbed. It
consisted or a circular ring of caliche rocks with an outside diameter of 16 inches. The inside
“firebox” was about 10 inches. A dark lens or soil was inside along the bottom or about the floor
level. Both or these hearths were on the floor surface with no evidence of a pit. The other hearth
was also about the center of room and about 4 feet from the west wall to center. The part of
hearth nearest the wall was all that remained in place with the remaining rocks scattered along the
floor toward the center of the room. It appeared to be constructed about the same as the first only
a bit larger with a “firebox” of about 13 inches.
Near the northwest corner of room, 2 feet from the north wall and 2 feet from the west wall was
noticed an area where there was a difference in the color of the soil. The color of the floor surface
after the accumulations of trash, ashes, ect had been removed was a dark red or apparently pure
clay like the clay found along the face of the escarpment below the caliche. This small “spot”
about 8 inches in diameter was of a lighter red with blending of grayish-tan. We found a similar
situation in about the same location from the northeast corner. Here the floor surface was pretty

dark because of the leeching from the above trash pocket, zone C. A circular spot about 10 inches
in diameter was much darker than the other floor surface. Not much was thought about these at
the time but we did make note of their presence. Earlier we had spent two days in Room 2
(discussed under Room 2) and during this time we found a pattern of post holes outside the room
in caliche about 12 inches beck from the edge of the room. Also we had removed all of the
screened dirt pile up along the rim of Room 1 and dumped it over the escarpment to the south of
the pit. While the area was cleared off we checked outside the room near rim in the caliche
bedrock for postholes (we had located them outside the pit at Room 2). We found two that were
still complete and one that had been about ½ weathered away. One complete was uncovered
about 12 inches from the edge and 24 inches east of' the northwest corner along the north side;
one that was only ½ left was found about 12 inches from the original edge and about 24 inches
west of the northeast corner along the north side. One was located about 12 inches from the edge
and 24 inches east of the southwest corner on the south side. If one had been located west of the
southeast corner it had weathered away. All of these were about 8 inches in diameter and from 10
to 14 inches deep. None were found along the west edge and if any were located along the east
end they had weathered away (see Figure 1.5).
As at this time we were of the opinion that we were at the bottom of the room, found the post
holes and all of the fill had been screened at least once, our next time out we planned to clean out
the room and take a close look at the floor area and take a lot of photographs (both black and
white and color) and this would about complete the room.
When we returned to the site we found that a lot of digging had been done deeper and that the
floor we had all uncovered was a second or upper floor and that the first floor was 24 inches
deeper. Needless to say our photo session was canceled. The room was filled with screened dirt
until in the summer of 1963 when it was cleaned out again but the walls were about all dug away
and little was left intact.
For several trips we continued to screen the fill between the upper and lower floors which
included Zones G and H. We found nothing in Zone G and almost no cultural material in Zone H.
The area in the northwest corner of room in the upper floor where we suspected the presence of a
posthole was examined by excavating a cross section of the fill at this location. A difference in
the color of the soil was noted in an area about 10 in. in diameter and 12 - 14 inches into the fill
from the top of the upper floor. In contrast to the surrounding fill, a light red below the deep red
clay of the floor; this spot was a light tan and or light gray. Although we still thought this to be
where a post had been it is sti1l questionable. The other suspected areas in the northeast corner
was dug through by parties unknown before we could check it farther.
We were able to screen a large portion of the fill along the floor, mostly through the center of the
room (Figure 1.5). We were able to observe all of the floor uncovered but not at one time as a lot
of screened dirt remained in the room.

The room measurements at the bottom (lower floor) was 16 feet north and south and 18 feet east
and west. A sloping entry ramp extended to the southeast from the southeast corner. This was
never excavated. It appeared to have been 3 feet 6 inches to 4 feet in width. A lot of weathering
had taken place and it was mostly filled with weathered caliche (same as Zone D).
There was about 6 inches of soil and some trash above the caliche bedrock and the pit was dug
into the caliche 5 feet or 5 feet 6 inches from the surface.

Figure 1.4 – Upper fill and floor of Room 1

Figure 1.5 - Lower fill and floor of Room 1
A fire hearth was located in the center of the room 2 feet from the west wall. It consisted of a ring
of caliche rocks that lay on the floor. The outside diameter was about 18 inches. The inside
(firebox) as about 12 inches. It was all still in place except along the east toward the center of

room and three of the caliche rocks lay a short distance to the center of the room. A small amount
of ashes and burned soil was at the bottom of the "firebox".
In the center of the room was found a hole dug into the floor 12 inches in diameter and 11 inches
deep. (posthole?) (ladder hole?). As an entry ramp was present, entry through the roof was not
likely. Without some kind of post or column for a support the span of the roof would be great and
timbers to carry the weight would be hard to come by if at all.

STRATIGRAPHY OF THE FIIL IN ROOM I
The fill in Room 1 was separated, excavated and most of it recorded in separate zones designated
from A through I (Figure 1.6). Each zone is described below as well as the artifact as recovered
from each zone. The interpretation of the separate zones is my own.

ZONE “A”
The thickness of this zone or layer that covered all of the top fill varied from as much as 18
inches in the center of room to as little as 6 inches around the cutter edges.
This apparently was an accumulation of fill blown in as well as washed in from the surface
around the outside rim of the room. This probably all took place after the site was abandoned.
It contains numerous small caliche gravels along with reddish sandy clay and deteriorated
powdered caliche end few burned
caliche rocks. Apparently this combination of materials
caused it to cement together becoming hard especially when it was dry. We had to use a small
pick to remove it and break it up to get it through the screen. This is just opposite to the fill below
as it was very soft and could easily be troweled or shoveled.
Figure 1.3 upper left shows a lot of the zone still held together after it fell into the room as a result
of unknown parties digging and keeping to more productive area below and undermining it
leaving it intact and it caved off later. Very few artifacts as compared to other zones was
recovered in zone “A”.

ZONE B
This zone was about 6 inches thick within the center of the room and around 10 inches thick
along the outer edges along the walls. It was made up of concentrated trash including many large
and small bone, sherds, lithic tools, sand and ashes.
This zone was different from Zone C by a large amount of large bone while C only had many
much smaller fragments only. It was also different from Zone E as E consisted of mostly large
bone with very little trash. Zone B appeared to be a combination of the other two or a place where
all of their trash was deposited. This was probably contributed by the latest period of occupation
of the site.

ZONE C
Zone C consisted of trash deposits that covered the entire east end of the room from about 6
inches below the surface and sloping downward out up to the upper floor at a distance of 5 feet
west of the east wall. This zone was about 36 inches in depth along the wall (see Figure 1.6).
Heavy concentrations of trash was found throughout the deposit and included many artifacts,
small fragments of bone, and ashes. This appeared to be the trash that they were cleaning off the
room floors and out of the fire pits and dumped into the east end of room. This trash deposit was
possibly always built up higher than the rest of the fill in the room there was no blending or
penetrations from any of the other zones.
Most all of Zone C was excavated with only a small amount of disturbance, confined to C1 the pit
that was dug before we started working at the site. Most of the artifacts recovered from C1 are
included in this inventory of material from C. A small area in the entry way was not removed and
a very small amount of disturbance took place during excavations.

ZONE D
Zone D consisted of caliche that had weathered off of the top of the wall all along the east end of
room. It accumulated within the corner of room and up the east wall (See Figure 5). This
appeared to have happened sometime after the roof of the lower or original room had fell in as the
remnants of roof lay under it and extended to the east wall. Very little of the blow sand of zone G
had accumulated in the room before Zone D was deposited as Zone G lay above Zone D. Also the
upper floor or Zone F was built over Zone D. Conclusions are that this took place after the room
was abandoned the first time but before the floor of the second occupation was built. No artifacts
in Zone D.

ZONE E
Zone E was deposits of almost solid bone. Some were from small animals but most were large
pieces from the larger animals. As we were not versed in bone identification I will not attempt to
identify them but from the size of many of them a lot of bison was included as well as many deer
and antelope. Most of the smaller bones were jack rabbit and lesser amounts of various other
smaller animals. Noted bone parts that were present in large numbers were; large fragments and
complete ribs, many vertebrae, different leg bone joints some of these almost complete, pieces of
skulls, pieces of jaw bones, some with teeth these all were small enough to be deer or antelope,
large sections of teeth so large that they had to be bison. Many other smaller pieces of all kinds of
bone parts.
Mixed within the bone was a sandy clay and what appeared to be a lot of deteriorated bone. Only
a few small artifacts were recovered from this zone, however there were several larger tools and
scattered through it were several burned caliche rocks.
The thickness of this zone was about 15 inches. Except a few areas along the center of room there
was an area about 6 inches thick of a reddish sandy clay between the upper floor and Zone E.
This is Zone F as discussed later.
Zone E appeared different from zone B and C in that here they were throwing the larger items
individually while in zones B and C they were depositing regular accumulations of trash in bulk.

ZONE F
Upper Floor Area
Zone F is along the upper floor area and about 6 inches above between Zone E and the upper
floor. The upper portion of zona F consist of a reddish sandy clay about 4 inches thick all along
the floor except a few small areas within the center where the above zone E extends down to the
floor surface. No artifacts were in this layer. It is not known whether this was blow sand
accumulations before they began to dump trash into the room or if this is remains of the roof. All
of the artifacts of Zone F were recovered along the floor in a 1-2 inches of trash.

ZONE G
Zone G was immediately below the upper floor clay. It completely covered the room area except
a portion of zone D. Zone D however was deposited before most all of Zone G. The thickness
was about 18 inches in the center and some thinner around the walls or outside edges where parts
of Zone H was built up along the corners of room. This zone consisted of reddish sandy clay. This
apparently was wind deposited sometime after the room or site was first occupied but before the
construction of the upper room floor. Outside this "blow sand" the only other material recovered
from this zone were several small flakes of charcoal.

ZONE H
Zone H consisted mostly of the collapsed and decayed roof. No actual wood survived or that we
noticed but a couple of areas observed a few inches above the floor with a different color of soil
that could have been caused from decayed roof timbers. Within the upper part of Zone H there
were several small pieces of burned caliche rocks and a number of s all ca1iche (unburned)
gravel. The lower portion appeared to be the clay that was on the roof and it was a deeper red
than the blow sand in Zone G but not as red as the clay found in the upper floor or Zone F.
Also deposited on top of Zone H but under Zone G along the east one half of the north and south
walls were small areas of “raw caliche” that had weathered off the rim of the pit. It was not as
solid or compact as that in Zone D along the east end that also lay over the top of Zone H.
Under Zone D along the east end of room where it was possibly had some protection from the
weather was found a number of large sections of clay from the roof. Some were about 3 inches
thick and as much as 8 inches in diameter. The impressions of small limbs or sticks were visible
on one side and numerous streaks or veins (possibly the remains of grass) all through the clay.
Grass was evidently used in the “Plaster on the roof”. Out in the center of the room a few inches
above the floor was noticed a few small clay "balls" that was probably the remains of the roof
clay but as the clay had very little cementing quality when it was wet and as it was exposed to
moisture more here it had about all melted and blended in with the blow sand of Zone G. Also as
the room was so large most of the roof probably collapsed and fell around the outer edges of
room along the walls.
What few artifacts found in Zone H are included in the inventory of the material recovered from
Zone I. Two items that were found were a sandstone metate turned upside down and the mano
that was used with lay just beneath. It was mostly within Zone H with about 2 inches of the
metate extending into Zone G. As the bottom of the mano was about 8 inches above the floor
possibly suggests that it was left on or along the side of the roof and it fell into the room when the
roof collapsed.

ZONE I
Zone I consists of the lower floor and about two inches above which consisted of mostly “floor
trash”. The floor was level and smooth, probably had been treated (dampened and packed?). This
deep into the caliche was below the hard upper crust and at this level it was “crumbly”, softer and
could be dampened with water and packed (even just by use) it would form a surface almost like
concrete.

Material Recovered from the Fill of Room 1 Zone “I”
All of the following material is recorded from Zone I or the lower floor area. A very small
amount could have come from Zone H but none was recovered from Zone G. All is from below

the upper room floor and would have been contributed during the time the room was first
occupied.

36 to 42 inch level

All of this level was within zone “C”. Including in this level is the upper floor surface where
many artifacts were recovered and the upper some 4 inches consisting of what appeared to be
either a layer of blow sand or the remnants of the roof. The color is black like the other- areas of
this trash deposit and not the usual reddish color as it appeared within this level in other areas of
the room that is not covered by concentrated trash deposits. This dark color is possibly the results
of leaching from the above deposits. Few artifacts were recovered in this level.

ROOM 2
For some time we suspected a room or something existed along the north end of Refuse Area B as
the digging here was much deeper than other areas of the trash mound where the caliche bedrock
was only about 12 inches. Here some of the digging was as much as 2 feet deep and still not
down to caliche bedrock.
When we arrived on the site one trip much recent digging had taken place here and what possibly
was the top of walls were exposed along the east and south sides. A lot of the screened dirt was
piled along the edge outside of the pit as well as a large amount left in the room.
We still had a lot of unexcavated areas in Room 1 but as it was filled with screened dirt and there
were no recent disturbance in the room we decided to examine the newly disturbed area, so we
spent the next two days trying to establish if this was a room or just a fault in the caliche trash
filled.
We first cleared out the already screened dirt (screening it all so as not miss anything) about all
we recovered was sherds and bone slivers. The outline of the room was uncovered when we
removed all of the screened dirt around the edge of the room down to the bedrock caliche.
Between the caliche and the disturbed dirt was about 12 inches of trash fill. The room measured
12 feet north-south and 8 feet east-west. Extending on to the north for another 6 feet the east wall
formed the east wall for a 6 feet by 3 ½ feet “anti-chamber” thought to have been the entry to the
room as later it appeared as a ramp with a bottom sloping from a few inches below the top of the
caliche to within about 12 inches of the bottom floor.
Along the west wall near the northwest corner a section of the wall had weathered off. At the end
of the first day we encountered what appeared a sol id bedrock caliche at a depth of about 1 foot
into the caliche or about 2 feet from the surface. At this time we thought we had reached the
bottom and
it appeared as a fault in the caliche that had been filled with trash. We did wonder
how come the hole was not already with soil before the site was occupied by natural means.
When we returned to the site the next Saturday we continued to remove the fill within the "entry"
and part of the main room and soon discovered that the caliche "bedrock" found earlier was a
large caliche boulder that had fell into the room from the east wall. About 3 inches down from the
top of the "boulder” an upper floor of apparently pure dark red clay was encountered. This floor
was about 3' 6” below the surface within the main part of the room but a few inches less within
the entry. It was still intact within the “entry” and about the north two thirds of the main room.
About one third had been already removed by previous digging for a distance slightly below.
In comparing the fill above the upper floor to the that above the upper floor in Room 1 there were
some correlations but because of possibly the surrounding circumstances such as drainage from
up the ridge and the adjacent trash mound just to the south and late to cover the room itself some
of the recognized zones that were found in Room 1 were not recognized in Room 2. As the fill

within the upper part of the room had already had so much uneven digging no separation as to the
level that the materiel was found was kept.
What remained of the upper fill that we excavated within the upper fill that we excavated within
the room area would compare to what was found within the trash mound (Refuse B) just to the
south of the room and appeared to have completely covered the room with a depth of about 12
inches a1ong the east wall and 18 inches along the south end and west side. These depth were all
from the caliche bedrock. At the north end of “entry” the depth was only about 6 inches or about
it was over the rest of the site when not within either of the two main trash mounds. Apparently
all of this had been thrown into the room by the occupants and or later weathered off the trash
mound possibly much higher and confined to a smaller area when it was used to dispose of their
trash.
Included were numerous pot sherds, a few small pockets of concentrated ashes and also pockets
of bone. These were mostly down near or on the upper floor. Large and small pieces of bone were
scattered throughout the fill, as were lithic artifacts both chipped and ground. Like in the trash
mound areas, we encountered many burned caliche rock.
The fill in the “entry” appeared to compare more with Zone C-2 of Room 1 along the north end
and with Zone E long the southern portion.
The northern part was filled with concentrate ashes and charcoal (like what would have come out
of a fire pit of which only a few artifacts were recovered. These consisted of a few sherds, and
small bone slivers. Within one small area of the ashes we recovered 22 ½ kernels of charred
acorns. This amounted to four areas of the site that the recovery of charred scorns are recorded
and all came from concentrated or pure ashes like that cleaned out of a fire pit. Apparently being
charred and deposited in the ashes helped to preserve them where in other areas of the site they
didn’t survive.
Within the southern portion of the “entry” we found mostly concentrations of large and small
bone with a filler of fine grayish soil. This area resembled Zone E within Room 1.

When we uncovered a portion of' the upper floor we were convinced that this was a pitroom and
as the dirt had been cleared off along the rim of the pit so it would not be in our way the bedrock
caliche was examined closely for post holes.
The post hole pattern for the main was uncovered, all along the outside of the pit and about 12
inches from the rim as following; one post hole about 12 inches west and one north of the
southeast corner, one 12 inches east and one 12 inches north of the southwest corner, one east 12
inches and if one was south of the northwest corner it had been destroyed when the wall section
fell off into the room. Only a single hole was found 12 inches from the rim of the pit about 12
inches into the "entry” or in line east from the one east of the northwest corner (see Figure 1.11).
All of the holes were dug into herd bedrock caliche; were all about 8 inches in diameter and 10 to
12 inches deep. If any were connected to the "entry”, we found none but probably would have
been weathered away.

We did not examine the upper floor to see if the post holes for this floor were inside the room. Or
were these used for both floors or were these used for the upper floor.
When we finished the second day of excavations we never worked in the room again as we went
back to the other pitroom (Room 1) and the surface rooms.
The room remained with only a small amount of disturbance now and then until late in 1964 after
we had finished excavation on the site, except in the spring of ’65 when Room 10 was completed,
when a couple screened most of the remaining fill. I was able to obtain two sacks of sherds and
bone that had been saved from the lower fill.
Not much data on other artifacts ect was obtained. The following is noted from information given
to me by one of the two doing the excavations.
The lower floor was reached about 5 feet into the caliche or 6 feet from the surface.
The floor was of hard, smooth caliche; no data as to floor features ect.
The upper portion of the fill just under the upper floor appeared to be mostly a reddish "blow
sand".
Along the floor and about a foot above there was a lot of trash, burned and "raw" caliche rocks,
what artifacts recovered along with the blow sand.
A large number of arrow points; “mostly” triangular un-notched with straight and concave bases,
(Types 1-B and 1-C) triangular side-notched with straight and concave bases, (Types 2-B and 2C.
Several small end scrapers and 2 larger dart Points (type ?).

DISCUSSIONS AND COMMENTS ROOM 1 AND 2
From the data obtained from the two pitrooms it suggests that they were both occupied at or about
the same time during the earlier occupation at the site. What difference that does occur within the
lower and upper fill of both rooms was most likely because of the location of the rooms.
Room I is located near the rim of the escarpment and at about as high point of elevation found on
the site, this limited what amount of filling of the pit washed in from surrounding surface with the
larger portion caused by Hind or blow in. This took longer.
Room 2 on the other hand was located slightly down grade from most of the occupied site area,
(especially the later period?) and a great amount of water drained into the pit through the "entry"
washing in a lot of foreign material from the surface. Also the possibility that trash was built up
as a trash deposit. During the first occupation just to the south and latter to continue to be used,
filling the room and some 12 inches or more above at the time the site was abandoned. This trash
also weathered into the room mixing with the “blow sand” within the lower fill. After the upper
room in both rooms was no longer in use they were used to dump their trash. Because Room 2
was smaller or the area was used more it filled completely and above while Room 1 was not filled
completely with trash when they left the site. Resulting in Zone A.
The artifact types that we do have some data will also compare. The lower fill and floor of Room
I to the Lower fill and floor of Room 2. Also the upper fill and floor of Room 1 is somewhat
similar to that of Room 2.

CHAPTER 2 “MERCHANT SITE” (SURFACE ROOMS)

ROOM 3
One Saturday in October 1960 I went out to the site taking along my two kids Mark and Cindy
and we were out there all day alone as no one else showed up. We had a lot of rain a few days
before and areas around the site were still pretty wet I planned to continue working in Room 1 as
we still had some areas in the room that were un-excavated when we left the last time out. In the
meantime some of our unknown helpers had been around and left the room filled with screened
dirt. Feeling sort of discouraged, (a feeling that usually came over me every time I returned to the
site) I decided to take a good look around the site to see if the rain had revealed anything on the
surface.
A number of areas had been uncovered enough to indicate the presence of some kind of features.
I decided to investigate in an area at the southwest edge of the north trash mound (Refuse A
Figure 2.19) which had mostly been screened before we started working on the site. Along the
south edge of the area that had been screened I thought I could detect a line of caliche rocks
aligned east and west, (about a half dozen). The area screened came up almost to this line of rocks
and along the bottom of their digging was a lot of reddish colored soil. Around the site area the
surface above the caliche generally consisted of small loose caliche rocks and fire blackened soil
and trash. No natural red sand or clay was above the caliche cap that covered the top of the ridge
so this also added to the suspicion that something unusual existed in the area.
After removing only a few inches of soil with a trowel I exposed a clay surface and because it
was so wet it was almost a maroon red or pure clay that is found below the caliche along the face
of the ridge. From this day on during every visit to the site other rooms and features could be
detected having been revealed by wind, rain and other digging on the site. This brought about the
excavation of other surface rooms.
Figures 2.1A and B will show my progress of excavation. The first notice of floor, fire pit and
south wall and the portion of room completed that day (I did cover the area with dirt before I left
to go home).
There was a fill above the floor ranging from 3 inches at the north side to about 12 inches along
the south edge or slightly above the south wall which was about 10 inches high at this point. A
cross section of this fill near the wall where it was thicker is the following: Top 6-7 inches
appeared to be mostly weathered fill occurring after the room was abandoned. About 3 inches of
light reddish clay; probably remnants of walls and roof after it collapsed and about 2 inches
laying just above the floor that was mostly floor trash and had many artifacts. The area above the
roof is recorded as fill, the area below and on the floor is recognized as floor. Later when I
discovered that the floor of Room 3 continued under Room 4, the floor there was included with
that north of the wall the fill in this area is included in Room 4 as no fill that belonged to Room 3
was separate and is recorded as fill in Room 4.

The portion of Room 3 floor north of wall was 5 ft. north and south, 7 ft. east and west. A small
portion of the floor could have been removed by the previous digging. As before stated the floor
extended under Room 4 as was found later when Room 4 was excavated. The floor area turned
out to be; east-west 7 ft. north-south 8 ft. 6 inches so comparing it to other rooms on the site, little
or none of the north portion of floor had been removed.
The fire pit was located, 2 ft. 3 inches from the north floor edge of pit and 1 ft. 6 inches from the
south wall to the south edge of the pit. The pit was oval in outline, (the only one on the site so far
known to have an oval outline) width 11 inches length 15 in. and depth of 7 in. A slightly raised
clay rim 1-2” high completely surrounded the pit. It was completely filled with ashes from their
fires.
Near the outer edge of floor on east and west and in line with the center of the fire pit was found
on east side two and west side three flat caliche rocks (flagstones). These extended about 2
inches above the floor and were sunk into the floor clay 2-3 inches. This same situation was later
found in Room 5 and the unexcavated room above Room 8. These were also in line with the
center of the fire pit. At first I considered them as “pads” for some sort of wall-roof support
(post?) but finding them in other rooms and as none were in the center of room, the others closer
to a wall makes me wonder if they may have something to do with some kind of rack over the fire
pit or “pot rest”.
I returned to the site the following Saturday, and as usual a visit by our unknown helpers had
exposed another wall about 8 ft. south of the wall I found the week before and continuing to dig
here I found that the wall found earlier was laid above the floor of Room 3.
As I am missing the photo of Room 4 after excavation was completed the drawing in Figure 2.4
includes both Room 3 and Room 4. As is discussed later Room 3 had been placed in “Period 2”
or an individual surface room.

ROOM 4
I continued to work for the next two Saturdays in the area between the south wall of Room 3 and
wall about eight feet to the south that was exposed by unknown party during the week. A pile of
screened dirt had been left along the edge of the cliff and just west of area where I also set up my
screen. Although much digging was outside (south) of the wall there was little disturbance within
the room area.
An average of about 4 inches of fill was above the roof-wall clay. Roof-wall clay was about 6
inches thick within the center and lesser along the walls or outer edges of room. Between the
roof-wall clay and clay floor was about 2 inches of trash. The clay used on the floor was a much
deeper red than that of the roof-walls as the latter had other things mixed with it. I went through
the floor to determine its thickness (about 3 inches) and discovered about 3 inches of trash under
it and above another clay floor. This floor turned out to be the floor of Room 3. Extending under
Room 4 for 3 feet and that the south wall uncovered previously was built over Room 3 when
Room 4 was built.
The room was east-west 8 feet 6 inches, north-south 8 feet. The doorway was along the west wall,
of which 2 feet of my screened dirt had to be removed to get to, was 2 feet north of southwest
corner; 4 feet 6 inches from northwest corner with an opening of 30 inches. This west wall was a
single row of caliche rocks and were all still in place minus the door opening. The north wall was
about 10 inches high and 10-12 inches thick with the mortar and caliche rocks still intact. This
wall extended to the east for at least 40 feet forming the north wall of 5 to 7 rooms. The east wall
like the west wall consisted of a single row of caliche rocks some of these were out of the wall
line and two to three were missing as was about all of the clay mortar. The south wall was still in
good shape, well mortared with clay and was about 8 inches wide and 8 inches high. No fire pit
was found. Room 4 is the only surface room so far excavated on the site that did not have a fire
pit.
While excavating the trash pocket under wall just east of Room 3 and Room 4, discussed later, a
clay floor was found east of the east wall of Room 4. About a year later the wind and water had
much of the south side of the screened pile on the west side of room a line of caliche rocks were
exposed for about 4 feet westward from the southwest corner of Room 4 (Figure 2.5). A test pit
was dug 2 ft. west of corner and on the north side of line of rocks where another room floor was
found. No evidence of rooms were found to the south of these rooms and at this time there
appears to be a vacant area, (breezeway) between the north and south block of rooms and about 6
feet wide. A photograph of Room 4 after it was completely excavated is missing. Figure 2.4 is a
drawing of both Room 3 and Room 4.

The 19 Chupadero Black-on-white sherds were found in a pile on the floor in the southwest
corner of the room (Figure 2.2 and Figure 2.3). All are bowl sherds; 5 rim and 14 body. As far as
could be determined, each sherd was from a different vessel. All could be classified as “typical”
with a thin, light gray slip applied to the interior surfaces. The color of the slip is the same as the
vessel wall. As is usual the case of Chupadero Black-on-white sherds found as ingressive’s in the
Eastern Jornada Area; this slipped surface has numerous hairline cracks (Crackling). All interior
surfaces are decorated with black paint. The lips and upper portions of all 5 rim sherds are painted
black.
Exterior finishes were; striated with different degrees of smoothing or rubbing until some were
almost completely obliterated, or smoothed with a sandy, gritty surface.
Paste is very fine, color light gray with a slightly darker core.
Assuming this was a collection of Chupadero Black-on-white sherds by someone possibly the
occupant of the room. Assuming this, will bring about a number of questions but no answers.
Were they collected from the Merchant site or from earlier sites within the area, (there are several
nearby).
If they were picked off other sites; then how many other decorated sherds were brought in from
other sites and discarded?

Why were only bowl sherds involved would be second guessing the collectors interest, (Jar sherd
on local sites will out number bowl sherds 3-4 to 1). The fact that the black/white sherds collected
were all Chupadero Black-on-white of course would be explained by the fact that this is the only
black/white type to be found within the area that the people of the Ochoa Phase seemed to range.
Their curiosity could have been increased by the suggestion of evidence collected at the period of
time that Room 4 (Period 3) was occupied was later than the period of time that Chupadero
Black-on-white was manufactured, or at least they were no longer able to obtain them. This is the
only Chupadero sherds found on the floors of rooms assigned to Period 3 that have been
excavated so far.
Of course this is not new as on many occasioned items have been found on sites that were
collected from earlier sites. This commonly occurs on our local “sand dune” or gathering sites in
that they were continuing to use (usually milling tools) that were left at the location by earlier
people. Often they were just collected out of curiosity, but more often they held more of a
practical purpose; use. A good example of this is found right here on the Merchant site in the
number of Type 8 dart points commonly found throughout the Eastern Jornada Area on sites that
were occupied within the Late Archaic (pre-ceramic) Period. Most of those not recovered from
the trash areas were found on the room floors (all periods). Most showed evidence of resharpening and dull blade edges from use. They were probably hafted and used as small knifes.
Material large enough to make a large cutting tool were rare in local material (gravels).

Location
Under long rock wall foundation extending from the northwest corner of Room 4, eastward
across about the center and over the floor of Room 3. This wall formed the north or back wall of
at least five rooms and extended for about forty feet eastward.
Six inches east of the floor of Room 3 and Room 4 and under this wall was what appeared as a
natural depression in the caliche bedrock (Figure 2.6). The measurements across the top northsouth 32 inches east-west 40 inches. The depth below the base or bottom of the wall was 18
inches but only 14 inches into the caliche as the area of the surrounding surface had about 4
inches of cultural and or natural fill above the caliche bedrock. As it sort of bowl shaped the
bottom dimensions were much smaller.

Inventory of Material Found:
Besides the items listed below that were found when screening this area was completely full,
down to caliche bedrock, of small and large animal bone, charcoal and ashes, a few lithic chips
and flakes and burned soil.

bison. Some heavier bones were also used.
W:
Bone awl complete. Bone and section not identified.
DISCUSSION:

The surface around and within the site usually have few inches of soil and small loose caliche
rocks just above the caliche bedrock. This depression was swept clean by the wind or cleaned out
by the people on the site for some purpose before filled with trash as it lay right down on bedrock.
Probably trash from the occupants of Room 3 to level up the area, could have been filled while
the wall was being built. An earlier pitroom may be nearby and the trash is from that period. The
artifacts suggest they are from Room 3 (Period 2) or earlier from the pithouses or (Period I).

Figure 2.7 Artifacts from the Trash Deposit (Refuse D see Figure 2.6) under wall just beast of
Room 3

ROOM 5

Room 5 is located roughly 16 feet east and in the same line of rooms along the south side of the
long wall as Room 4. Was first excavated down to the roof-wall clay (thinking it was complete)
in late February, 1963. Was later completed by excavating to and removing everything above the
floor in September, 1964 of eighteen months later.

After the first excavation it was reported to be 9 feet east-west and 6 feet 6 inches north-south.
The east, west and north walls were uncovered and still pretty well intact. The front or south wall
was reported as three large caliche rocks in a line east-west and about 6 inches apart. The
remaining was absent of any caliche rocks. The floor was of a lighter clay than other floors that
had been excavated (however it was very dry when the excavations took place). The floor was
also very soft and not firm at all, however it was very near the surface. It was also about 6 inches
higher in the center than around the edges near walls. The east and west walls extended beyond
the “wall line” of the three large caliche rocks for about 2 feet. Discussing it with parties who did
the excavation I expressed my belief that the fill above the roof-wall clay was all that was
removed. The fire pit was reported at this time in the center of the room but this was determined
from an ash zone blending through the clay it was not excavated or examined farther. Figure 2.8A
was taken about two weeks after the first excavation. Was busy in other areas of the site and no
one was disturbing the room farther only wind and rain so it was left like this for the next
eighteen months.
In August 1964 I continued to excavate in the room one day when the soil was wet. About 5
inches of what turned out to be roof-wall was removed down to the floor. Thickness was about 5
inches in the center of room but much less around the edges near the walls. A thin layer of trash
lay on the floor. The floor was more compact than the clay above and was a much darker red. At
this time it was cleaned up to the three rocks though to be within south wall line. Figure 2.8C
shows how the room looked when I quite that day.
As I still was not convinced that this room was completely excavated, several months later I
returned to the site for the specific purpose to make sure, one way or the other. This was in March
1965 and the last time that I dug on the site. In Figure 2.9 I have tried to show the room as it was
when it was finely completed as the floor was found to extend about another 2 feet to the south. I
did intend to continue to try and clean up and or complete excavating some of the rooms that need
finishing but by this time all of the diggers seemed to have decided that the site was tore up and
about all that it could be so the digging just stopped. I did visit the site every few months for the
next eighteen years to look over and other than a lot of natural destruction by wind and water,
exposing some and covering some. Some digging was done in Room 11 and small amounts of
expanding the digging in both refuse areas A and B.
DESCRIPTION OF ROOM 5 WHEN FINISHED:

The room was east-west 9 feet; north-south 8 feet 2 inches. The back, north, wall was part of the
long wall running east and west forming the north wall of five or more rooms. It was 12 to 14
inches in height off the floor and about 10 inches wide. Was semi-coursed various size caliche
rocks held together by and all spaces filled with clay mortar.
The west wall was only about 10 inches in height above the floor and some 8 inches in width. It
was also semi-coursed especially along the lower portion and held together by a clay mortar. A
section about 3 feet long from the northwest corner southward and about 5 inches thick on top of
the wall consisted of only clay with a large amount of small caliche (gravel). A similar situation

was found along the east wall. Was this a door threshold or just part of the wall construction? A
short section at the south end was missing (the top portion) when the last excavation took place.
Most of this however was still pretty much in place when the first excavation took place. What
remained was the lower course with the top being the floor level. This wall appeared to have been
built between the north and south walls having been butted up to the latter.
The east wall in several ways was similar to the west wall, about 10 inches high above the floor
level and about 8 inches wide the bottom portion the full length of wall was semi-coursed and
held together with clay mortar. It was also built between the north and south walls. Like the west
wall a section about 30 inches in length and 5 inches thick along the north end and on top of wall
consisted of only clay mixed with a lot of small caliche gravel. From this clay section south to the
south wall line the top course was made up of more or less uniform size caliche rocks laid on
edge and across the wall each spaced about 2 inches apart and filled with clay mortar.
The south of front wall has been pretty well weathered away and all that remained was 6 almost
flat rocks that apparently were part of the bottom course. All were at or below the floor level. A
possible doorway was near the southeast corner. The south wall continued on to the east as well
as to the west and both east and west corners were still present.
The fire pit was located where previously reported, in the center of the room between the east and
west wall. Three feet 6 inches from center to the east wall and 3 feet 6 inches from center to the
west wall. Three feet 6 inches from center to north wall and 4 feet 8 inches to the south wall. It
was circular, 12 inches in diameter, 6 inches deep with raised clay rim some1 ½ inches high. The
pit was about one half full of burned caliche rocks and the remainder was filled with ashes.
On opposite sides of the room in a line with the center of the fire pit were, on the east side up
against the wall, two almost flat caliche rocks and on the west side also up against the wall were
three. All of these extended above the floor level two to three inches and the remainder,
depending on the thickness of the rocks were sunk into the floor clay.
When the roof-wall clay was removed southward beyond the three large caliche rocks at floor
level one of them had been removed and lay near, where it was removed from or under the others
was found no penetration of the floor so evidently the middle and west two were laying on the
floor the smallest one on the east was laying 3 inches above the floor level. Apparently they had
no original part in the room construction. In fact it is possible they were at one time part of the
front (south) wall.

ROOM 6
Room 6 is located about 12 feet southeast of Room 5. As no other room was found to join it on
any side it is classified as an individual surface room of Period 2.
The room was excavated the last weekend in February 1963. Figure 2.10 was taken facing north
during excavation on Saturday I was not back on the site on Sunday when the excavation was
completed so it was two weeks later when the photo (Figure 2.10A) facing east was taken.
The excavators reported that the room was completely surrounded by a single row of caliche
rocks 6 – 8 inches high with the exception of an area about 30 inches wide located near the north

corner along the northwest wall which was probably the doorway. By the time the photos in
Figure 2.10 was taken two weeks later many of these had been disturbed (There were usually
several kids with their parents and several of these seem to have thrived on tearing things up).
The room was orientated diagonally as compared to the surface room blocks to the north, west,
south and east. The slides were northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest. Dimensions of
the room were, northwest to southeast 8 ft. 6 inches and northeast to southwest 7 ft. Figure 2.11.
Only a thin layer of weathered fill was above the roof-wall clay especially along the center of the
room and over the fire pit where it was right at surface level (about 6 inches thick). A thin layer
of trash lay on the floor which was a darker red than that in the fill.
The fire pit was located in the center; about 12 inches in diameter and 7 inches deep. A clay rim
about 1 inches high was present. Clay lined and filled with burned rock and ashes.

ROOM 7
Room 7 is an individual surface room located several feet down the ridge south of the main site
area. It is the largest surface rom thus far located measuring about 11 feet north-south and 10 feet
east-west.
The thin layer of fill was removed mostly with a broom at the same time, late February, 1963, as
Room 5 and 6. About two months later and after a lot of wind I cleaned off the surface a bit and
took the photograph (Figure 2.12). The fill was removed down to the top of roof-wall clay that
apparently covered all of the floor surface. Like most all of the surface rooms so far excavated the
clay was 4-5 inches higher within the center of the room. Today after twenty years it has all
weathered down and appears level over the room.
At this time the corner rocks and a few along the north and east walls were still in place but only
one remained in each of the south and west walls.

Although the fire pit was not uncovered, a heavy ash layer was present in about the center of the
room showing through the roof-wall clay.
As the room was right at the surface the wall rocks had been weathered away through the years.
Several of these were scattered around on the surface nearby.

Figure 2.12 Overview of Room 7, down to the roof clay

Materials Recovered
Very little midden was present around the room area. Besides being some distance from the main
portion of the site, possibly the room was only used for a short period of time. As the small
amount of fill above the roof clay would have to have weathered from areas adjacent to the room
resulted in very little cultural material present in this fill.

ROOM 8
One trip on the site in July 1964 we noticed someone had dug a hole near the edge of the cliff
about 10 feet southwest of the southwest corner of Room 4 to a depth of 12 inches, 30 inches
wide and about 60 inches in length. The depth and still in fill at this point of the ridge didn’t
compare to other areas of the site and as the caliche bedrock was exposed on the surface about
four feet west along the cliff edge. At this time we all agreed that this was a room of some kind.
It was a couple of weeks before we could return to the site and we found that someone (later
learned it was one of the fellows along the previous trip) had expanded the pothole and had left
exposed part of the floor sand fire pit. I late obtained his field records and complete inventory of
artifacts and material that he recovered.
At this time we did limited excavations on west side of pit and immediately encountered a wall. A
small section of the south wall was already visible. The room still has only about one half of the
floor excavated so the size is unknown. This section of floor that was exposed was removed down
to the caliche bedrock and this revealed that the bottom of the fire pit had been pecked into the
caliche about 2 inches. This is the only time we removed the floor clay from a room (only a small
test hole to determine the thickness) so we do not know was done in any other room.
OUR EXAMINATION REVEALED:

Probably un-observed by wither of the previous parties who dug here before, they dug through a
surface room that was built above Room 8.
This upper room had a east wall that was still in good shape solid caliche rocks mortared together
with clay. It was in line with and appeared to be a continuation of the wall that formed the west
wall of Rooms 9 and 10. The top was just barely under the surface and only 5 inches above the
floor clay of the upper room. The south wall was visible by several rocks in a line from east to
west however many of the rocks were missing. The north and west walls only had two to three
still in place in each, there were a number of rocks laying nearby that possibly had been part of
the walls. The west side was so near the edge of the cliff that a lot of weathering had already
taken place. The room appeared to measure about 8 feet from east to west and 8 feet 6 inches
north to south. The location of door way was not determined but it is possibly within the west or
north sides of the room.
As luck would have it had been raining a lot that summer and after scaling about an inch off the
side of the dug hole the stratification from the caliche bedrock to surface was very easy to see.
Starting on the lower caliche bedrock, the stratification I read it as following.
The caliche bedrock was more or less level but very rough and jagged. Above this was 2-3 inches
of dark red (pure?) clay. As in most of the other surface rooms, just enough clay was used to level
and smooth the floor.

A thin layer, (1-1 ½ inches thick) consisting of ashes, burned soil and cultural artifacts lay
between the floor clay and roof wall clay. This is recorded as “floor” area as apparently this was
accumulations on the floor while the room was occupied.
A layer of light reddish clay with a few areas of light brown, tan and gray. These later
discolorations is thought to be caused from parts of decaying framework. This layer had a
thickness of about 3 inches.
Above this roof-clay was 2-3 inches of what looked like blow sand light red in color. From the
top of this sand to the bottom of the surface room floor clay 4-5 inches was filled with dirt, small
caliche rocks with little trash or cultural materials. It appeared to have been filled to level the area
in preparation for the upper room floor.
From the bottom of the upper room floor, about 5 inches to the surface was all clay except a thin
layer of sand, (blown in ) on top. The only separation of the floor and roof was a small dark (ash)
line. The color of the clay ranged from a deep red at the bottom to a much lighter red at the top.
As seemed to be the case in Room 9 and 10, all the fill above the roof clay was mostly blown in
or settled in from the air as because of the rooms situated at about the highest point on the ridge
and the absence of any trash mound uphill from it (like the rooms in the north room block) blown
in by wind was about the only way it could get into the room.
The total depth from the surface to the bedrock caliche was about 20 inches.
We have no information on the fire pit for this upper room. If there was one it was probably dug
through when the room was first dug in.
Neither do we have any artifacts or material recorded from this room as everything was recovered
above the lower roof was recorded as fill. All thought to be fill above Room 8 only.
A small section of the lower room (Room 8) was exposed around the southwest corner. About 2
fett 6 inch to the north slowing the west wall and 18 inches to the east along the south wall. The
pit had been dug into the caliche bedrock for about 14 inches.
The fire pit was located 2 feet 8 inches from the east wall line of the upper surface room and 4
feet north of the south wall of the lower room (Room 8). These measurements are to the center of
the fire pit. The fire pit was circular, 11 inches in diameter, 7 inches deep and as stated before it
was pecked into the caliche bedrock 2 inches (Figure 2.14). Around the pit was a clay rim about 3
inches high and was filled with burned caliche rocks and ashes (Figure 2.15).
Rom 8 is classified as a shallow pitroom. It has more similarities to the individual rooms found on
the site than to the deep pitrooms 1 and 2. One other room not yet excavated Room 13 may have
similar depth.

Materials Recovered
Fill:

As previously stated everything recovered above the roof-wall clay of the lower room and as to
what room or level it was recovered from is not known; however from the stratification seen in
the wall of the pit, it would possibly be safe to assume that most if not all belonged to the upper
room.

ROOM 9
Room 9 was excavated during a two day weekend in August 1964. Because of the traffic over the
site during the previous five years the surface was disturbed to cause the wind and water to erode
the surface revealing outlines of the south, west, and north walls of the room.
A; of Figure 2.16 Overview of room was taken facing north on Saturday before the excavation
was completed on Sunday. (I was not present when completed). The drawing; Figure 2.17 is to
show the room when completed.
The dimensions of the room were; north to south 9’6”, east to west 9’.

The south wall consist of a double row of small caliche rocks placed about 6” apart. The rocks
were mostly uniform in size, rectangular (Naturally) and placed on edge laid parallel to the wall
and filled with a clay mortar of the dark red color as the floor clay. The height off the floor level
was about 8 inches. A small area was examined just to the south of this wall and a floor to
another room was found, but not excavated. It has not been assigned a number before but for this
report it will be Room 17.
The west wall was still about completely in place with only a small amount of mortar weathered
away and this probably took place before the room became filled sometime after abandoned. It
consisted of a single row of caliche rocks that were larger than these in the south and north walls.
About half of these were laid parallel with the wall and the others were laid across.
Thickness or width was about 8 inches and the height off of the floor level was 8 inches. This
wall extended on south of the southwest corner of Room 9 and on the north forming the west wall
of Room 10 and the east wall of Room 15 and other of this multiple room structure.
The north wall was constructed very similar to the south wall and both were built the east and
west walls. The two rows of caliche rocks in the north wall were placed wider apart than the
south wall about 10 inches. It was also filled with a dark red clay mortar. This was also the south
wall of Room 10.
The east wall consisted of a single line of caliche rocks mortared together with clay. A space
about 30 inches wide was absent of any rocks and located near the southeast corner of the room.
This was probably the entry or doorway. This wall was 6 to 8 inches wide and 8 inches in height
above the floor level.
The weathered in fill in the room varied in depth from some 8 inches along the outer edges along
the walls to the clay from the roof-walls exposed on the surface when excavations started. As this
group of rooms is located near the edge of the ridge and at near the highest elevation on the site
the only way that fill could get into the rooms was to blow in. This resulted in it consisting of a
reddish to light tan very fine sand. Almost no cultural material was found in this, only a few fine
flakes of charcoal.
The roof-wall clay was mostly piled up in the center of the room and except out along the walls it
filled the room to the top of the walls or about 8 inches thick.
What appeared as a post mold and remains of the decayed bottom portion of an added post or roof
support was found in the center of the room. The post apparently remained in place until after the
clay from the roof had fell into the center of the room and built up around it. The clay had also
covered the fire pit about 3 inches. There seemed to have been some flaw or weakness in the roof
construction, as throughout the rooms that had been excavated, the roof or at least the clay it was
the first to fall in.
Below the roof-wall clay and above the clay floor was 1-2” of trash and was the area where most
of the material was recovered.

Floor features consist of; The post mold in center of room with an inside diameter 5 inches and
the post had been setting on the floor. Fire pit: diameter 18 inches, circular, about 7 inches deep
with a raised clay rim and was filled with ashes. Location was between the center and the
northeast corner. The measurements to center of pit were; from east wall 3’6”, from west wall
5’6”, from the north wall 3’4”.
A flat caliche slab was located just north of the fire pit between it and the north wall. Dimensions
8 by 10 inches it was placed partly down into the floor. Suggest it to be a pot rest. Laying on the
floor near the northwest corner of room were two well used hammerstones of natural shaped
quartzite pebbles. In the northeast corner leaning against the wall were two small sandstone
manos with convex grinding surfaces and a small sandstone metate with an oval shaped shallow
grinding basin.

ROOM 10

Room 10 was excavated the same weekend as Room 9, very little on Saturday with most of it
done on Sunday, even then a portion along the north wall (later found to be about 1 foot) was still
unexcavated until about a month later when the room was completed.
Dimensions of the room were: north-south 9 feet, east-west 9 feet 2 inches.
Before excavation was started only sa few caliche rocks along the west wall were visible. The
tops of the others were covered with an inch or two of overburden (fill).
The south wall was the partition all between Room 9 and 10 and is previously described in the
Room 9 discussions.
The west wall, a continuation of the west wall of Room 9 was completely in place and consisted
of a similar construction as in Room 9. The caliche rocks were also placed parallel to the wall and
across the wall. There was an opening about 30 inches wide about 1 foot from the northwest
corner south. At each side of the opening was placed a long 12” caliche rock (see Figure 2.18).
The north wall appeared to be constructed about the same as the south wall. A solid line or row of
rectangular caliche rocks were placed on edge forming the inside or south portion of the wall.
Examining a small area near the east end the wall appeared to be constructed similar to the south
wall; two rows of rocks spaced about 8 inches apart and filled with clay mortar. What appeared as
a room floor was also found on the north side. The height was about 8 inches and overall width
about 12 inches. Like the south wall this wall was built inside the east and west walls.
The east wall consisted of a solid row of rectangular caliche rocks laid end to end with one
occasionally laid across the wall. It was a continuation of the east wall of Room 9 and an
determined number of other rooms in the a north south line. Although this was an outside wall
there no break in the wall or any visible doorway. The wall was constructed about 8 inches high
with 2-3 inches of overburden above. The width was also about 8 inches.
The fill above the thin (1-2 inches) of trash on the floor was about 7-8 inches thick. It appeared to
consist mostly of roof-wall clay with a few pockets or areas of reddish and or light tan sand
(blowsand?). As it was very dry it all seemed to more or less blend together. Almost no cultural
material was recovered from the fill, only a few small burned caliche rocks and a few small
flakes. The fill appeared to consist of the roof-wall clay and blow in sand and soil.
The thin trash area above the floor, (1-2 inches) consisted of a number of artifact types as well as
burned or blackened soil, ashes, bone slivers and flakes. All of the material from the room was
recovered from this area. The floor clay was about 4 inches thick and was the usual dark red in
color.

Floor features consisted of a circular fire pit; 18 inches in diameter, 7 inches deep with a slightly
raised clay rim. Location was within the northeast ¼ of the room 3 feet 6 inches from the north
wall to center of the pit. It was filled with ashes. It was a also a duplicate of the fire pit in Room
9.
Embedded in the floor clay flush with the surface just inside the wall line in center of doorway
along the west wall was a flat caliche slab, (flagstone step?) 23 inches long 11 inches wide.
Also embedded into the floor suspending above the floor about 3 inches along the north wall in
the northeast corner were two rectangular slabs; one 10 inches by 14 inches and one 8 inches by
11 inches. The slab in the doorway was most likely a step, the two along the wall could be a step
into the room to the north but more likely it was used as “Pot Rests” in conjunction with the fire
pit (see drawing Figure 18).

Materials Recovered From Room 10
Fill:

As before stated the fill was almost void of any cultural material being restricted to an occasional
small piece of burned caliche rock, a small number of flakes and a few flakes of charcoal.

When the rest of the floor was uncovered along the north wall a small metate 9 inches in length 6
inches wide and 2 inches thick with an oval basin about ¾ inch deep.
A small mano with convex grinding face was laying near by, it fit the metate and was most likely
the one used with it. These were both made from a local sandstone.
On the floor was many small bone fragments and several flakes.

Figure 2.18 Overview and Cross Section Room 10

NUMBERED UNEXCAVATED INDIVIDUAL SURFACE
ROOMS
Several of what appeared to be individual surface rooms were discovered and were numbered in
the order that they were found. One was completely dug through within the south half of
“Refuse” Area B. The others were dug into but never completed.

ROOM 11
Room 11 is located a few feet south down from the ridge from the south edge of the screened area
of “Refuse B” on the east side of the “neck” or “horseshoe” of the escarpment (see site map
Figure 19). There was nothing visible on the surface of the presence of this room for the first 2-3
years that we worked on the site. The disturbance that had taken place just up the slope of the
ridge in “Refuse B” the piles of screened dirt ect. had diverted water from rains to flow over the
top of the room and removing the surface to reveal the outline of all four walls. At first only a few
of the higher rocks within all of the walls and corners, later the complete walls were visible. The
west wall was about 3 feet from the edge of the cliffs edge.
The room remained in this condition for about a year and no disturbance took place but one time
on the site it was noticed that someone had dug a pothole in the center of the room about 3 feet
diameter. Before leaving that day I backfilled the pothole with the screened pile of dirt and
leveled the area covering the walls in the process. The room remained like this the rest of the time
we were working on the site. About 10 years later while visiting the site someone had just
recently dug in the room, (the walls had again been uncovered) removing about two thirds of the
interior of the room fill through the floor at least in one area down to the caliche bedrock. None of
the walls were disturbed however. No measurements were taken but the room was slightly
rectangular about 8 feet north-south and 9 feet east-west. There was no surface indication of any
connecting rooms or room. Excavation may show otherwise. Other than natural filling the dug
hole in the room it remained in this condition as of May, 1984.

ROOM 12
Room 12 is located a few feet southeast of Room 6 and about the same distance from Room 2
(see site map Figure 19). There was nothing visible on the surface to suggest any joining or
connecting room.
The room was dug into by one of the Lea County Archaeology Society members after the wind
and water had blown and washed away the surface revealing the outline of some of the walls.
He kept insisting that he was going to complete the room so the room was left for him but he
never did complete it. In time the area dug was about filled in and littler to indicate the presence
of a room.

At the time about 2 feet of the fill was removed along the south wall. The south wall was
completely exposed as a the southeast and southwest corners and about 2 feet of the east wall and
2 feet of the west wall the remainder of the room to the north remained covered. The fill in this
area was removed down to the clay floor. The width of the room east to west was 7 feet 8 inches.
The dimensions north-south is unknown. All of the data I have is that a few arrow points and
several sherds.

ROOM 13
Room 13 is located between the two pitrooms Room 1 and 2 a little closer to Room 2. After
spending all day on the site working in Room 1, we were all ready to take it to the house and
waiting for the boys to show back on the site as they had wandered off into the flat and around the
old lake bed “lion” huntin with their air rifles, I began to poke around along the west edge of the
digging in Refuse Area “B”. The midden was only about 8 inches down to the caliche bedrock, at
first, but within 12 to 18 inches it dropped off into very soft fill for about 12 inches to a clay
floor. An area about 30 inches along the east wall and 24 inches along the north wall was
removed down to floor.
What I had apparently dug off into was a shallow pitroom that had been dug into the caliche
bedrock about 12 inches, similar to Room 8. Also the room had burned most likely while the
room was being occupied.
Laying more or less diagonal to the room, on and an inch or two above the floor were several
burned limbs, sticks or whatever (a part of the wall-room framework?). They were not in a pile
but were separated from one another by 2 to 4 inches. The diameter were ½ to 1 ½ inches. The
ends of some extended on along the floor under the un-excavated fill in the room.
A layer 3-4 inches thick lay on the floor that appeared to be burned clay and vegetable materials
from the walls and roof. In this were numerous small compact “clods” of clay and two larger ones
that had been heated enough to make them very hard. In the smaller one was a stick 1 inch in
diameter running through it and it was burned. The other one which was larger, about 7 inches
long, 4 inches wide and 3 inches thick. This piece had the impressions of two sticks, one ¾ inch
and one 1 ¼ inches in diameter. Both had several burned lines or streaks throughout and were the
burned fibers “grasses” used in the clay plaster? to help hold it together.
Lying face up on the floor in the corner was a nice shaped sandstone mano. Close by were two
fairly large rim sherds of Ochoa Indented jar, (the two fit together).
The boys returned within an hour so the hole was backfilled and the surface was smoother over
before we went home. I did drive down a stake to mark the spot.
It was several weeks before I was able to return to the site and found that someone had expanded
the digging for several feet to the west right across the room. From a close examination it
appeared that only about 8 inches of the top was removed and the floor and most of the lower fill

was not bothered. Also examining the screen piles I could find nothing similar to what was found
earlier on the floor.
As the room was not being damaged further we never excavated the room, the stake has either
been covered or removed. This room would produce much valuable data if it is a room that had
burned as is indicated.

ROOM 14
Room 14 was exposed after a lot of screening had been done within the south portion of Refuse
Area B. All that remained was about 6 square feet of the floor and a wall section on the north side
of the about 30 inches long. All of the area around had been dug 10 to 12 inches deeper.
The floor was of the usual dark red clay. The section of wall was built on about 4 inches of trash.
It was constructed of random placed caliche rocks with all spaces between filled with clay mortar.
Width was about 8 inches, the height was about 10 inches but only 6 inches above the top floor
surface.
Apparently the walls were first constructed and then the interior was filled with about 4 inches of
clay which served to level the floor as well as bringing the floor surface a few inches above the
ground surface and preventing some of the moisture problem. There was not enough left of the
room to indicate the size of the room and no sign of a corner was present.
The 4 inches of trash under the wall; the wall 10 inches high and about 4 inches of trash above the
wall would make the trash mound at this point some 18 inches deep when this digging took place.
One can only imagine the depth when they last used it to dump their trash. No excavation was
done at this time. Later more screening was done by unknowns and screen-dirt piles were all over
the area where the room was. It is not known whether the remaining portion of the room was dug
up or just covered over. We have no material data. Several Ochoa Indented sherds were taken
from the surface of the screened dirt piles.

OTHER SURFACE ROOMS CONNECTED TO EXCAVATED
ROOMS WITHIN THE NORTH AND SOUTH MULTIPLE
ROOM STRUCTURES
Most of the following have been discussed in part or all in the discussion of other rooms. Some of
these may turn out to not be rooms with more excavation but by what was found by the small
amount of testing and some surface evidence I am considering them as rooms.
Previously they were not given a number but are numbered in this discussion so as to identify and
locate them on the site (Figure 19).

ROOM 15
Room 15 is a surface room built over the top of Room 8. About all the information obtained is
included in the discussion of Room 8.

ROOM 16
Room 16 is a surface room east of Room 8 and north of Room 10. The presence of the room was
established from two areas tested where in each a floor was found. Three Ochoa Indented sherds
and a few small bone slivers were found on the floor in the small area tested just east and adjacent
to Room 8. Seven Ochoa Indented sherds, several small bone slivers, one Type 2-E arrow point,
one small mano with flat grinding face and a small end scraper were found on the floor of the
area tested just north and adjacent to Room 10.

ROOM 17
Room 17 was established from a small test area where a room floor was found just south of the
south wall of Room 9. The soil was wet at the time and the floor was very easy to detect by the
much darker clay as compared to the above fill. One Ochoa Indented sherd was found on the floor
surface. No rocks to indicate the presence of a room were visible on the surface. As the top of the
ridge sloped gently to the southeast the fill above the floor was beginning to be very shallow, only
5 to 6 inches. No excavations were conducted and the room is still undisturbed.

ROOM 18
Room 18 is located west and adjacent to Room 4. As there was a pile of screened dirt over the
area put there before and during excavation of Room 4 the area had not been bothered. In August
during the time that Rooms 9 and 10 was excavated it was noticed that the rains and especially
wind had removed much of the south side of the screened pile, (as it was dirt that had gone
through the screen) there were no rocks or gravel in it so the wind was able to blow it away.
Extending west from the southwest corner of Room 4 for about 4 feet was visible the top of the
wall. This was an extension of the south wall for all the rooms to the east. On the north side of the
wall (inside?) and 2 feet from the corner a small area was tested. A floor surface was found about
6 inches below the surface. As the soil was wet it was easy to separate the dark red floor from the
light fill. Two Ochoa Indented sherds were found on the floor. The last time I was on the site the
pile of dirt was still on top of the room. This was good as the area would probably have been dug
up as the north trash mound Refuse Area A was screened right out to the edge of the escarpment
all along the north side but as the pile of dirt was already screened none wanted to move it.

ROOM 19
Room 19 is located just east and adjacent to Room 4. The floor which was the usual dark red
clay, was uncovered in two areas. One was along the north wall when the trash pocket under this

wall was excavated, and the other a small area near the southwest corner. The south wall of Room
4 continued east to form the south wall of Room 19. No cultural material was recovered from the
test area in the southwest corner and what was if any recovered along the north wall has been
included in the material from the trash pocket.

ROOM 20
Room 20 is located just west and adjacent to Room 5. These two rooms 19 and 20 will take up
the space between Room 4 and 5. A small area about 2 feet square was tested just west and about
the center of the west wall of Room 5. The fill, including the roof-wall clay was about 8 inches
thick above the floor where seven Ochoa Indented sherds, one small end scraper, and two Type 2E arrow points were found.

ROOM 21
Room 21 is located just east and adjacent to Room 5. The long wall running east and west
forming the north wall of this row of rooms had become visible at a point what later was just east
of Room 5 and a trench 18 inches wide and 4 feet long was dug starting on the south side of the
wall and angling somewhat to the southwest corner. The usual weathered fill, roof-wall clay,
floor trash and floor were present. This trench was dug a few weeks before Room 5 was
excavated and a record and the material recovered has survived and is given here.

ROOM 22
Room 22 is located just east and adjacent to Room 21. At the time the trench was dug in Room 21
nothing was visible on the surface to indicate a room this far to the east suggesting that Room 21
was the east most room. Later digging was expanded eastward in Refuse Area A and causing the
surface to weather down exposing the extension of the north wall. In the spring of 1965 when I
finished excavating Room 5 some of the caliche rocks that formed the east wall and the west wall
which was also the east wall of Room 21 were visible on the surface. Nothing was ever visible
that indicated a wall on the south side. All of the time this area had been driven over and
sometimes used for parking.
The weekend that Room 5 and 6 were excavated about 25 individuals of both members of the Lea
County Archaeological Society and non-members were present on the site on Saturday but only a
few of these returned on Sunday. With little or no control they just picked a spot and started
digging. Many of them screened in one or the other of the two trash areas, but one couple started
in an area just north of what turned out to be Room 6 and a short distance southeast of Room 5.
This was on Saturday and they did not return the next day. As the few that did return the next day
had their own projects started that they were finishing up, no further excavation was conducted to
determine what did exist here. With all of the screened dirt piles around within a few weeks the
wind and rains had filled the area until nothing was visible on the surface.
Expecting the excavation to continue, no great amount of attention was given to what was being
uncovered at the time. No field notes or any information of the artifacts recovered. My memory
of casual observations is given here along with a photo that was taken at the time facing north;
(Figure 13-B). In the left center of Figure 13-B from the pile of screened dirt to the southeast
parallel to the shovel appears a wall, however these were placed here by some kids that were on
the site that day. Most of these came from the top of the east wall of Room 5. Three or four
caliche rocks with no apparent pattern are shown as they were uncovered just northwest of the
northwest corner of Room 6 that was being uncovered. Also several were uncovered a few feet
northeast of the northeast wall of Room 6 with no apparent pattern. In neither of these areas was
the presence of any clay that would suggest the presence of a room floor. Instead the fill appeared
to be the usual trash midden that covered the site though somewhat thinner at this spot. More
excavations is needed to determine what existed here but at present these appear to be from fall of
nearby rooms, mainly Room 21 and 22.

ROOM 23
Room 23 is located to the southwest of the southwest corner of Room 9 near the edge of the
escarpment. The distance from the southwest corner of Room 9 to the southwest corner of Room
23 would be 16 to 18 feet.
The couple that excavated Room 6 first started here but as it was so dry and fill above the caliche
bedrock was so shallow (about 6 inches) after a short time they decided to move.

At this time the presence of a floor was apparent, also a 3 foot section of the south wall and three
caliche rocks within the west wall was uncovered. Later when the soil was wet I did a small
amount of excavation with trowel and found at this time the floor was very easy to detect.
Material recovered was; two type 2-E arrow points, one small end scraper, 14 Ochoa Indented
sherds and several bone fragments.
About half way between and in line with the west wall of Room 15 and 23 two sections of walls
were uncovered by sweeping the loose dry fill with a broom. One section was about 42 inches in
length. The rocks were spaced laid on edge at right angles to the wall line. The other was about 6
feet in length and rocks were laid end to end and with the wall line. These were about 8 feet west
of the west wall of Room 9 and 17.

John;
Would this be the place, when all of the rooms are described to present some discussion,
conclusions, hypothesis or whatever concerning the different types of architecture on the site or
should all of this be with other discussions at the end?

CHAPTER 3 REFUSE AREAS & TRASH DEPOSITS THE
“MERCHANT SITE”

THE REFUSE AREAS
A number of concentrated areas of refuse (trash mounds) were present on the site. The three main
areas are designated as A, B, and C (Figure 2.19 of Chapter 2). Refuse A and B were actually
mounds, C was a concentration of trash deposited off the escarpment in a neck or horseshoe along
the southern edge of the site. Another area designated D was a trash pocket that fill a depression
in the caliche bedrock under a wall just east of Rooms 3 and 4.

REFUSE AREA “A”
“A” is located at the northern most part of the site as it is known at this time. It was just north of
the multiple surface room structure. At the time it was dug up it covered and area about 75 feet
east to west and about 30 – 40 feet north to south. The greatest depth was about 18-20 inches at
the center but it became thinner outward to the edges on the east, west, and north but to the south
(down grade) the depth remained 18-20 inches. Here it had weathered down filling all of the
rooms and in some areas as much as 6 inches above the foundation walls.
This is the area where two of the Lea County Archaeological Society members had done most of
their screening for about a year before I was on the site. I was told by another couple were
screening in another trash mound Area “B” and by mutual agreement they did not bother each
other’s area (I wish we could have gotten an agreement from those that were tearing us up all of
the time).
When I first visited the site no mound as such was visible because of so much digging and pile of
screened dirt scattered around. They told me however at the beginning a low mound was present.
One can only speculate the size and height of the mound when it was in use or at the time the site
was abandoned but it was much smaller in area as having a greater height.
I was able to record and classify both of the artifact collections recovered by the two that dug at
Refuse Area A earlier. Very few of the non “goodie” items were saved however. A few of the
other parties that screened in Refuse Area A made their collections available to record and turned
in to me the items they did not want to keep. Many other parties screened in both Areas A and B
of which no data was obtained. As so few sherds had been saved by the ones screening in both
“A” and “B” many were collected from the screened piles where after a rain many were visible.
Not much detailed information was obtained (such as measurements, material type, color, ect.)
from many of the items from most of the collections. They were only classified or typed and
recorded. The material such as sherds, grinding tools ect. that were in my possession were given
much more attention.

Throughout the lower levels within the center (un-weathered area) of the mound were a number
of small pockets of bone and other types of trash. None of this was present where it had
weathered in and over the rooms to the south or along the outer edges. Scattered throughout the
mound was found complete and fragments of sandstone grinding tools, pottery sherds, bone and
other types of lithic tools. Many of these appeared to be discards because they were either broken
or worn to the point they were no longer useable. Many small to larger pieces of fire burned
caliche rock was present.

REFUSE AREA “B”
Area “B” is located just south and southwest as covering Room 2 to a depth of 12 inches or more.
At the time it was dug up it covered an area about 60 feet north-south and 50 feet east-west. A
depth of up to 24 inches near the southern edge was present and a slight mound was visible. The
depth tapered off around the outer edges to a depth of about 6 inches. Like Area A one can only
speculate as to the original height and size of the mound at the time they quit dumping their trash
here but no doubt it was much higher and confined to a smaller area. Later as it spread out to the
west it covered the top of Room 14 and individual shallow pit room to a depth of 6 to 8 inches
(see Figure 3.2).
With the south part of the mound an individual room (Room 13) the foundation walls were
constructed over some 4 inches of midden. The walls were about 12 inches high and trash
covered the top of the walls 10 to 12 inches.
Like Area “A” small pockets of concentrated ashes as well as pockets of bone was present within
the lower deposits at the center of the mound. These concentrations was not noticed around the
outer edges.
As stated before a couple was digging in Area B during that time that the two LCAS members
were screening in Area A, however I was told others had dug here before and during that time
that they were. I was later able to classify and record most of the collection of one of the
individuals and was able to briefly examine the artifacts in the other collection but he moved out
of state before I could record it. Nothing unusual as far as artifact types was noticed, about the
same as being found throughout the site. They did not save any of the sherds, bone, ect. I was
able to obtain some data from a few of the other parties that screened in Area B from time to time
but most of it was not made available for any study at all. Many of the sherds were collected
from the screened piles after winds or rain.

It is very obvious that the data from both Area A and B is very bias. It is given here to add to the
record of artifacts from the site. The information obtained from Area C and D may have some
valid data concerning the earlier Period or Periods on the site.

REFUSE AREA “C”
Within a short gully or neck in the escarpment at the southern edge of the site someone had dug a
couple of small pot holes in the accumulated fill in the bottom of the gully (Figure 3.4).
Observations from examining the dirt that had been removed that a lot of cultural trash was
present in the deposits.
To examine it further to determine how much trash and it’s depth a pit was dug 3 feet wide 6 feet
in length and an average 3 feet deep down to sterile red clay. Location of the pit was within the
lower portion of the deposits.
A discussion of the stratigraphy as it appeared in the profile along the north or upper wall of the
pit, Figure 3.5. This as well as the type of artifacts that were recovered suggests that the deposits
(especially lower) were from the earlier period of occupation on the site.

E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L
Type 1-C (Fresno). A small triangular un-notched arrow point with concave base. (Preform for Type 2-C and Type 2-F?)
M, N, O, P, Q, R
Type 2-B (Washita). A small triangular arrow point with straight base and small side
notches opposed. Began to appear on local sites around A.D. 1200. It continued as major

atyle but never the most popular until the Eastern Jornada area was abandoned by the
local Mogollon people around A.D. 1450-1500.
S, T, U, V, W, X, Y
Type 2-C (Washita). A small triangular arrow point with concave base and small side
notches opposed. This was the most common style of arrow points within all periods of
the Eastern Jornada Mogollon beginning around A.D. 1250 until the area was abandoned
by the local Mogollon people around A.D. 1450-1500. Was the most common style at the
Merchant Site in all Periods.
Z
Type 8-D (Carlsbad). A wide expanding stem dart point. This specimen is much thicker
than the arrow points. It shows a lot of re-sharpening and was probably somewhat larger
originally. The blade edges are dull. Was probably picked up at some earlier local site
where the type is common and used as a hafted knife.
AA
Type 3-F. A small corner notched arrow point with rounded base and serrated blade
edges. Common within Eastern Jornada area from about A.D. 1000 to 1200.
BB
Type 3-E. A small corner notched arrow point with straight stem. Would probably be
included in the Livermore type. Common within the Eastern Jornada area from A.D.
1000 to 1200.
CC
A leaf-shaped biface knife showing a lot of re-sharpening especially on the small end.
The edges are dull from use. Material suggest a local gravel.

TRASH POCKET (REFUSE D)
Location:
Under long rock wall foundation extending from the northwest corner of Room 4, eastward
across about the center and over the floor of Room 3. This wall formed the north or back wall of
at least five rooms and extended for about forty feet eastward.
Six inches east of the floor of Room 3 and 4 and under this wall was what appeared as a natural
depression in the caliche bedrock. The measurements across the top north-south 32 inches eastwest 40 inches. The depth below the base or bottom of wall was 18 inches but only 14 inches into

the caliche as the area of the surrounding surface had about 4 inches of cultural or natural fill
above the caliche bedrock. As it was sort of bowl shaped the bottom dimensions were much
smaller.

Inventory of Material Found:
Besides the items listed below that were found when screening this area was completely full,
down to the caliche bedrock, of small and large animal bones, charcoal and ashes, a few lithic
chips and flakes and burned soil.

Small finely chipped end scrapers. Not only are they very common at the “Merchant Site”
but also common on all known sites that were occupied during the “Ochoa Phase).
V;
Notched Bison? Rib. Notcheds Notches are on the inside of rib. Commonly called
“rhytum bones” or “Noise makers” notched bone is not recorded from earlier sites within
the area but are common on “Ochoa Phase” sites. They are usually wfrom ribs of deer,
antelope or bison. Some heavier bones were used.
W:
Bone awl complete. Bone and section not identified.

DISCUSSION
The surface around and within the site usually has a few inches of soil and small loose caliche
rocks just above the caliche bedrock. This depression was swept clean by the wind or cleaned out
by the people on the site for some purpose before filled with trash as it lay right down on bedrock.
Probably trash from the occupants of Room 3 to level up the area, could have been filled while

the wall was being built. An earlier pit room may be near by and the trash is from that period. The
artifacts suggest they are from Room 3 (Period 2) or earlier from the pitrooms or (Period I).

CHAPTER 4 PROJECTILE POINTS AND OTHER ARTIFACTS
FROM THE “MERCHANT SITE”

LITHIC ARTIFACTS
A large number of stone artifacts are recorded from the site. This is only part of the total that has
actually been removed from the site by many that did not make their collections available for this
report. The projectile points consist of the largest number of single artifact types of which 1,652
are recorded. Waste material such as chips, flakes, and cores were plentiful on the site at most all
locations. Few of these were saved and those that were saved were never tabulated and not
included in this report. Neither are the many fragments of unidentified items.
The foregoing sample is considered a good representation of the material from the site and all
artifact types known from the site are included.

RAW LITHIC MATERIALS
A number of different types of materials were used in the manufacture of lithic tools. The smaller
chipped artifacts such as arrow points, small scrapers, knifes, and drills apparently were mostly
made from local fine-grain chert (broad single category) gravels. These gravels are readily
available throughout the low area to the south and west of the site any where the Triassic Red
Clay is exposed and not covered by recently formed small sand dunes. A wide range of colors are
present to include: light and dark gray, tan to buff, light and dark browns, light and dark red,
shades of pink, and true white to dirty or smokey white. Most of these gravels are rather small
round 1 to 2 inches in diameter. Occasionally one may be larger with a diameter of up to 4-5
inches. Usually they are oval in shape or about the size and shaped like an egg.
These gravels consist if an estimate of about 80% of both fine and course grain quartzite. The
most common color is a light tan or brown with lesser amounts of red, dark brown, maroon and
light green. The hammerstones and choppers were of quartzite, this was probably because this
material was more resistant to shattering on impact than the chert or other available material. The
remaining 20 % is mostly chert with small amounts of mudstone, petrified wood and even lesser
amount of igneous material.
These gravels are always present from thinly scattered to heavy concentrations anywhere the
Triassic Formation is exposed on the surface west of Mescalero Ridge and east of the Pecos River
within the Eastern Jornada Area. They are included in the red clays and within conglomerate
layers of sandstone. Those here near the Merchant Site are weathering out of the red clay beds.
Only a few “pea” size gravels have been observed in the local sandstone that outcrops below the
escarpment.
Another local material that was used in the manufacture of a few of the small arrow points and
occasionally the larger and cruder scrapers. The local seasonal campsites to the east and southeast
located along the western edge of the Llano Estacado have this material strewed all over the

surface in the form of flakes and cores as well as used in most of the finished artifacts collected.
This did not appear to be a preferred material to use because of it was usually of poor quality and
was used very little when the gravels were available.
Several terms have been used by different geologist in the identification of this material such as;
hydrous quartz, opaline quartz, caliche quartz and a form of gypsum. It appears in thin veins and
from observing it in it’s original position it is in all levels of the Ogallala Formation and above
the Triassic Red Clays. It can be found eroding along the face of many of the ridges. It can also
be found on the surface under some of these ridges but it is thought to be from the erosion of the
upper Ogallala.
Within the Eastern Jornada Area it is found in a wide variety of deep bright colors of reds,
yellows, dark gray, a blue, light gray and black. This far south it all very light from a dull flat
surface white to a glossy smokey white and occasionally almost as clear as glass. All of the above
may appear within one “chunk” of this material.
Large massive outcroppings and a number of large boulders of sandstone are exposed just under
the escarpment south and west of the site. Numerous bedrock mortars and grinding basins are
found in this sandstone. Most all of the grinding tools are made from this local sandstone to
include pestals, manos, mutates, and shaft abraders.
Caliche which is very much available, was used in some of the digging tools, some of the heavy
mauls, several bedrock mortars were in the caliche bedrock on top of the ridge. It was used in the
construction of the foundations of the surface rooms. Also it was used in the hearths and fire pits.
Another Natural resource, although not classified as lithic was used (the Triassic red clay) in the
preparation of their floors as mortar in the foundations of the surface rooms, in the plaster on the
walls and roofs and in the preparation of the fire pits.

PROJECTILE POINTS
Projectile points were the most common lithic artifact type found on the site with a total of 1,562
recorded. A large number of fragments, too small to identify as to type and or function were
found. As only a few of these were recorded they are not included in this report.
The same typology as Leslie (1978) is used in the following discussions and descriptions. Each
style (sub-type) is described and discussed separately even though about the only difference may
be the shape of the base. In the discussions of collected data concerning this style within the
Eastern Jornada Mogollon Area there will usually be a difference in the distribution as far as
concentrations and or lack of concentrations in certain areas at a particular time period. Also the
difference in the time span and suggested dates of each style within one type.
Basically the projectile points from the Merchant Site are represented by only 4 types. Types 1
and 2 are separated by base shapes Types 3 and 8 are separated by the shape of the stem.

ARROW POINTS
All of the thin lightweight small projectile points are considered as arrow points made to be
hafted on an arrow shaft to be used with a bow.
TYPE 1

A total of 576 or 37% of the projectile points recorded from the site are placed in Type 1. This
type is separated into four styles or sub-types and include all of the small triangular un-notched
specimens. The separate is made primarily by the shape of the base. These include: Type 1-A,
convex base; Type 1-B, straight base; Type 1-C, concave base and Type 1-D, whose base is either
indented or with a deep V notch.
The question will usually come up as whether these are only “Blanks”, unfinished pre-forms for
other types. A large number of Type 1 from the “Merchant Site” (not tabulated) appeared to have
been broken in the process of manufacture and then discarded. Other were the results of bases
that had been removed from the shafts and discarded after it had been broken from use. I am of
the opinion that some were used in this form and some were “Blanks” for the more finished
notched styles. Whatever the term pre-form would apply as these were the first step in making of
the styles that would have notches added.

size)

DISCUSSION: Type 1-A was not common at the site and appears to be confined to the latter
room floors or from the trash that was contributed be the latter occupation. Also appearing about
the same that that Type 1-D and 2-F. This style was common on total sites occupied within the
Queracho and Maljamar Phases along with a number of styles of arrow points with convex bases.
It was absent on any of the sites within the Southern Jornada Area occupied after the Maljamar
Phase and before the Ochoa phase or about A.D. 1300 to 1350.
Within the Young type in Texas (Suhm and Jelks 1962). It is sometimes placed in the Fresno type
(Suhm and Jelks 1962).
It is more common within the Jornada Mogollon and western Mogollon cultures to the west than
those of the south Plains and Central Texas.

LENGTH: 1.5 cm to 3 cm Average about 2.5 cm
WIDTH: 1 cm to 1.8 cm Average about 1.5 cm
THICKNESS: 0.2 cm to 0.5 cm Average about 0.3 cm

DISCUSSION: Type 1-B was found throughout the site and within all periods. It was somewhat
more common early. Like Type 1-A this type first appeared in the Eastern Jornada Area along
with the first straight base corner-notched arrow points and continued throughout all of the
ceramic-arrow point periods until the abandonment of the “Merchant Site”. It seemed to always
be a minor type and pre-form for Type 2-B and 2-D. These would be included in the “Fresno”
type (Suhm and Jelks 1962).
TYPE 1-C

Figure 4-3

Number recorded, 367 or 23.6 % of total points from the “Merchant
Site”, 60 % of the Type 1 points

BLADE OUTLINE: Triangular
BLADE EDGES: Slightly convex, straight and re-curved. Re-curved edges are more common in
Type 1-C than any of the other types of Type 4.
NOTCHES: None
BASE: Slight to moderately concave. A number of specimens are flared at the base.
LENGTH: 1.6 cm to 3.5 cm. Average about 2.5 cm
WIDTH: Some greater at base, 1 cm to 1.8 cm Average about 1.4 cm
THICKNESS: 0.2 cm to 0.5 cm Average about 0.3 cm
DISCUSSION: Type 1-C was the most common style of Type 1 at the “Merchant Site”
throughout all time periods. It first appeared within the Eastern Jornada Area along with Type 2C as the first concave base arrow point style. From about 1200 A.D. until the abandonment of the
“Merchant Site” it was always the most common style of type 4. Considered as a pre-form for
Type 2-C and Type 2-D. It is within the “Fresno” type (Suhn and Jelks 1962).

LENGTH: 1.5 cm to 3 cm. Average about 2.5 cm
WIDTH: 1 cm to 1.6 cm Average about 1.2 cm
THICKNESS: 0.2 cm to 0.6 cm Average about 0.4 cm
DISCUSSION: Type 1-D first appeared within the Eastern Jornada Area late in the Ochoa Phase
or near the end of the occupation at the Merchant Site 1400+ A.D. Type 1-D is not recorded from
any of the other Ochoa Phase sites within the locale area. Similar points have been referred to by
both Garza, (Runkles, 1964-see A and B figures) and Soto (Phelps 1964) and others. The Garza is
common within the southern Llano Estacado (Johnson 1977 and Perry and Speth 1984). The date
for the Garza is 1500-1650 A.D. This is a bit later than the date suggested at the Merchant Site.
The Soto is reported from the Trans-Pecos, Big Bend Area in Texas and from Northern Mexico.
The relation between the two if any is not clear at this time, or with these from the Merchant Site.
Type 1-D does appear to be a pre-form for the side notched style, 2F here at the Merchant Site.
This brings up the similarity of some of the 2-F specimens to the Toyah Point, a Trans-Pecos, Big
Bend and Northern Mexico type (Suhn and Jelks 1962).

Figure 4-4 Outline and Sketch of Type 1-D Arrow Points from the Merchant Site (Approximate
size)
TYPE 2

A total of 936 Type 2 points are recorded from the site. Type 2 include all of the small, thin,
lightweight, triangular arrow points with side notches. These are separated into six styles
primarily by the shape of the base. One of the six, convex base is not present in the collection.
Those present are; 2-B straight, 2-C concave, 2-D straight with center notch, 2-E concave with
center notch, and 2-F indented or deep V notch.

TYPE 2-A

Type 2-A is the only style of type 2 that is not present at the Merchant site. It is a very common
type within the earlier Maljamar Phase within the northern part of the Eastern Jornada Area north
of Maljamar.
This style is the first side notched arrow point to appear on sites within the northern section of the
Eastern Jornada Area with Type 2-B appearing about the same time. It is very common on the
surface of “Pitroom” sites north of Maljamar located under Mescalero Ridge as far north as U.S.
380. It was also common in the excavated collection from the “Boot Hill” site (Corley and Leslie
1960). The dates for this style on these sites are from about 1150-1200 A.D. to around 1300 A.D.
or the end of the Maljamar Phase. This style is very rare south of U.S. 62-180 within the Eastern
Jornada Area.
TYPE 2-B

Figure 4-5

Number recorded, 133 or 8.5 % of total points from the “Merchant Site”,
14 % of the Type 2 points

BLADE OUTLINE: Triangular
BLADE EDGES: Slightly convex, straight
NOTCHES: Side opposed
BASE: Straight
LENGTH: 1.5 cm to 3 cm. Average about 2.5 cm
WIDTH: Usually greater at base, 1.2 cm to 2.2 cm Average about 1.5 cm
THICKNESS: 0.3 cm to 0.5 cm Average about 0.4 cm
DISCUSSION: Type 2-B has the distinction of being associated with all of the styles of side
notched arrow points not only here at the “Merchant Site” and the Eastern Jornada Area, but from
most all of the sites reporting the presence of side notches arrow points throughout the Southwest
and Plains. This style never seems to be the popular style, however the classification is more
restrictive in that straight is straight and anything that varies from this will put it into another
style. Here there is usually a variance such as slightly convex or slightly concave-concave.
Obviously one would not use the term slightly straight. Along with Type 2-A this was one of the
first side-notched styles to appear on sites within the Eastern Jornada and probably derived from
the then common corner-notched arrow points. This point style continued to be a minor to
common style until the end of the Ochoa Phase. This point has been named a Washita Point (Bell
1958).

TYPE 2-C

Figure 2-6, 2-7 Number recorded, 433 or 27.8 % of total points from the “Merchant
Site”, 48 % of the Type 2 points
BLADE OUTLINE: Triangular
BLADE EDGES: Slightly convex, straight or re-curved
NOTCHES: Side opposed
BASE: Concave, slight to deeply
LENGTH: 1.8 cm to 3.2 cm. Average about 2.5 cm
WIDTH: 0.9 cm to 1.8 cm Average about 1.5 cm
THICKNESS: 0.2 cm to 0.5 cm Average about 0.3 cm

DISCUSSION: This style of Type 2 is the most common style within all the periods at the
“Merchant Site” as well as earlier periods within the Eastern Jornada beginning late in the
Maljamar Phase or around 1250 A.D. It is a common style all over the southwest and plains
during the late prehistoric and early historic times. It is also included in the Washita type (Bell
1958).

BLADE OUTLINE: Triangular
BLADE EDGES: Slightly convex, straight or re-curved edges are rare.

BASE: Straight with center notch
LENGTH: 1.5 cm to 3 cm. Average about 2.2 cm
WIDTH: 1 cm to 1.7 cm Average about 1.5 cm. It is usually widest at base.
THICKNESS: 0.2 cm to 0.5 cm Average about 0.3 cm

DISCUSSION: Type 2-D like 2-E and 2-F first appeared late at the “Merchant Site” or around
1400 A.D. or later. All of the above mentioned styles of Type 2 are absent in all of the earlier
periods within the Eastern Jornada Area. Type 2-D is the same as Type 2-B only a notch has been
added in the center of the straight base. This type is included in the Harrell type (Suhm and Jelks
1962).

TYPE 2-E

Figure 4-9, 4-10 Number recorded, 210 or 13.5 % of total points from the “Merchant
Site”, 22.3 % of the Type 2 points
BLADE OUTLINE: Triangular
BLADE EDGES: Slightly or slightly convex, occasionally re-curved.
NOTCHES: Side opposed
BASE: Straight to deeply concaved with center notch

LENGTH: 1.7 cm to 4.2 cm. Average about 2.8 cm
WIDTH: Greater at base, 1.3 cm to 2.2 cm Average about 1.6 cm.
THICKNESS: 0.2 cm to 0.5 cm Average about 0.3 cm
DISCUSSION: The first appearance of Type 2-E within the Eastern Jornada Area was late at the
Merchant Site or within Period 3, where the only floor areas that this style was found were those
of the multiple room structures, the latest rooms on the site. Other areas where they were
recovered were; the fill above the north room structure, Refuse Areas A and B and the upper fill
in Room 2. All of these areas of trash could most likely contributed by the occupants of the two
multiple room structures.
Several of these triple notched styles have been found in the northern Eastern Jornada Area up
around U.S. Highway 380, Mescalero Sands, Mescalero Point, and north of Milnesands. The
larger number of these are made of Alibates and Quita flint. These are probably from the north
and east in Texas.
The name of these points are Harrell Point (Suhm and Jelks1954 and 1962, Bell 1958). This point
is widely distributed throughout the Plains and Southwest.

Number recorded, 82 or 5.2 % of total points from the
“Merchant Site”, 8.6 % of the Type 2 points
BLADE OUTLINE: Triangular
BLADE EDGES: Slightly convex, straight and several serrated..
NOTCHES: Side opposed
BASE: Indented or deep V notch
LENGTH: 2 cm to 4 cm. Average about 2.5 cm
WIDTH: Usually widest at base, 1.2 cm to 1.6 cm Average about 1.5 cm.
THICKNESS: 0.2 cm to 0.6 cm Average about 0.4 cm

DISCUSSION: Like Type 2-D and 2-E, Type 2-F first appeared within the eastern Jornada area
late in the Ochoa Phase or Period 3 at the Merchant Site.
Two variations are present in the specimens that were placed in thisd group, the indented base
and the deep V notch. Many of these4 were recorded on site where both varieties were lumped
into one type. As I never had the opportunity to re-examine these there is no way knowing how
many of each were recovered from the site.
In the collections that I was loaned for examination, make drawings and photograph of some of
the two styles were separated, 25 had indented bases and 18 had the deep V notch. The indented
base variety differs from Type 2-E not only the indented base but the rounded corners at the
notches and each outside base corner. Most all other side notched styles have sharp notches at
both the notches and base. Several of both indented and V notched could be placed in the
“Toyah” type with the slender serrated lateral blade edges (see Figure P-9). Besides Toyah other
names have been used in reporting similar points and are reported from the Trans-Pecos Big Bend
and northern Mexico as far south as Durango (Howard 1957). This is the results of adding the
side notches to the Type 1-D style.

Figure 4-11 Outline of Type 2-F Arrow Points from the Merchant Site (Approximate size)

Figure 4-12 Sketch of Type 2-F Arrow Points from the Merchant Site (Approximate size)

TYPE 3

Placed in Type 3 are all of the small thin lightweight arrow points with corner notches or
stemmed arrow points. Leslie (1978) separated Type 3 into six different styles or sub-types. Four
of the six are recorded from the Merchant Site (Figure 4-13). Of the 19 recorded, only six are
classified to style the other 13 were recorded on the site as Type 3. The suggested dates of the
corner notched arrow points here in the Eastern Jornada Area are about A.D. 1,000 to 1,200.
Similar point types are common and many have been collected from sites that appear to be earlier
than the Ochoa Phase, on sites down near the lake in the flat Lea County Archaeological Sites #
E-1, E-23, and E-72. Also E-122 located up the ridge north of the Merchant Site (see Figure x.x).
As the corner notched arrow points were not in use within the Eastern Jornada Area for some 150
years before the beginning of the occupation at the Merchant Site and as they are readily available
on the surface of many local sites, one would be justified in assuming that these were picked up

and brought in by the Ochoa people and although they could have used them, they probably did
not make them.

Figure 4-13 Outline of Arrow Points and Small Dart Points from the Merchant Site
DISCUSSION: A: Type 3-F, blade edges are serrated, stem is slender slightly expanding with
convex base. Found throughout Eastern Jornada Area. Color light tan. B: Type 3-E, long slender
blade, barbs project out at right angles, stem straight. Is found throughout the Eastern Jornada but
more so in the southern portion. Type 3-E would be well within the Livermore type (Suhm and
Jelks (1962). Color a dirty white. C: Type 3-F, long slender blade, long downward sweeping
barbs, expanding stem and convex base. This Type 3-F generally referred to as one of several

variants of a local “Southwestern New Mexico Livermore point”. Color dark gray. D, E, and F:
These all within Type 3-A thin corner notched with expanding stem and convex base. F has extra
wide stem but is thin and lightweight no doubt an arrow point. Colors are D, tan, E, dark gray,
and F, a light tan. All of these points are chert. All of the above except B are common on many
sites, and those East of the Pecos River always have a lot of pottery of the earlier plain
brownwares and the associated Red on browns, occasionally a few sherds of Mimbres or
Chupadero Black-on-white may be present.
PROVENIENCE OF ILLUSTRATED SPECIMENTS: A and C was recovered from the upper
fill of Room 1, B and F was recovered from Refuse Area A, D and E was recovered from the
lower floor area of Room 1.
A large number of unclassifiable fragments and un-identifiable types were recovered but as only a
few of these were recorded the few that were are not included in this report.
DART POINTS

A total of 32 dart points was recovered from the site. All but one are classified as Type 8 (Leslie
1978). Illustrated G, in Figure P-10 Gary-like, rare for southeastern New Mexico but are to be
found on a few sites around the Texas-New Mexico State line southeast of Hobbs and east into
Texas. Color a dark gray and is made of a non-local material.
TYPE 8

Thirty-one Type 8 dart points are recorded from the site. Ten of these were recorded on the site
only as Type 8 and the style or sub-type is not known. Six of these did have the notation that they
appeared to have been re-worked or re-sharpened. The remaining 21 were in the collections that I
was able to study, make drawings and photograph some. These are illustrated in Figure P-10 and
Figure P-11.
All four of the separate styles Leslie, (1978) are included in the collection.
TYPE 8-A

Figure 4-13 J and B, Figure 4-14
Corner notched with expanding stem and convex base. J shows some re-sharpening. Figure P10B does not. Length of this type is usually about 3.5 cm, width about 2.5 cm. This is the most
common style of Type 8 throughout the Eastern Jornada Area. This type would be within the
Ellis type (Suhm and Jelks (1962).
TYPE 8-B

Figure 4-13 H and Figure 4-14G
Well barbed, corner notched, expanding stem with straight base. Found throughout the Eastern
Jornada Area as a minor style. Usually found on the surface and excavations in association with
the other styles of Type 8 within the late Archaic (non-ceramic) Period. This style also would be
included in the Ellis type (Suhm and Jelks (1962).

TYPE 8-C

Figure 4-14A and Figure 4-14K
Type 8-C is also found throughout the Eastern Jornada Area, It is more common in the north part
then in the south. Well barbed to strong shoulders, corner notched usually wide expanding stem
and convex to rounded base. This type would fall within the Palmillas or Williams type (Suhm
and Jelks 1962).
Figure 4-14A: Recovered from refuse area “B”; Color a tan-gray blend, source of material is
unknown, possibly Triassic gravel chert. Blade edges show a small amount of re-sharpening?
Edges are dull.
Figure 4-14F: Recovered from floor area of Room 10. Color a dark gray. The material source
unknown. Does not appear to be a local gravel. Blade edges are dull but show no re-sharpening.
Figure 4-14K: Recovered from Refuse Area “A”. Color a dark gray. The material appears to be
same as “F”. Blade edges show re-sharpening and are dull.

Site (Approximate Actual Size)
TYPE 8-D (Carlsbad Point) (Leslie 1978)

DESCRIPTION: (After Leslie, 1978, Figure 19b, p. 133)
BLADE EDGES: Convex, straight or concave; sometime different on the same specimen. Recurved and apparent re-sharpened with dull edges are common.
BLADE OUTLINE: Triangular
SHOULDERS: Pronounced to well barbed
NOTCHES: Corner-wide
STEM: Wide-expanding, length is sometimes equal to ½ it’s total length
BASE: Convex

LENGTH: 3 to 6 cm. Average about 5 cm
WIDTH: 2 to 2.5 cm. Average about 2.4 cm at shoulders.
THICKNESS: 0.4 to 0.9 cm. Average about 0.6 cm.
DATE: Suggest pre A.D. 900-950. One of the major style of Type 8 the late, local Archaic Period
(Hueco Phase?)
ASSOCIATED CERAMICS: None known within the local area.
DISTRIBUTION: Determined from published information available to the author, as well as
examining a large number of collections taken from sites within southeastern New Mexico. Many
of these collections were quite large numbering into the thousands, and were collected over many
years. The collections examined from these made within the Carlsbad area were usually full of
this type, also common in many of the collections taken throughout the southeast corner of New
Mexico. They were rare in collections east and south in Texas but here they are found. All of this
data leads to the conclusion that the concentrated area of distribution is confined mostly to a
hundred mile radius and centering around Carlsbad, New Mexico. Thus the Carlsbad :Point.
Many of the specimens placed in Type 9 because of the notches being only mm up the sides from
the corners should be included as Type 8-D. Both Type 8 and Type 9 points are almost always
found together on the surface and some of our excavations.
Leslie, 1978, places smaller versions of Type 8-D in a separate type, Type 6-D. They are in every
way similar to Type 8-D except they are much smaller. Although they were used as probably both
they are listed as a dart and/or arrow points. Type 6-D are concentrated on a number of sites in
the same area as sites with concentrated Type 8-D but the concentrations 0of each are never the
same on the sites. Recovered with Type 6-D have been early plain brownwares and rare sherds pf
Mimbres Black-on-white and Red Mesa Black-on-white. These are thought to partly be the
results of the transition from dart to arrow point to be used with the bow.

TYPE 8-D specimens from the MERCHANT SITE
Illustrated in Figure 4-13 I, K, L and Figure 4-14C, D, E, H, I, J, L, M, N, and O. Many other
points of the 8-D type were recovered, one from Refuse Area C and one from Refuse Area D. Of
the 31 Type 8 points recorded from the site 15 are identified as Type 8-D. Eight of the 15 points
had the points missing. Apparently they were broken and discarded but what remained of the
blades suggested reworking and dull edges. Three had a barb or shoulder broken, all three had
extensive resharpening and had dull blade edges. The remaining four also showed to have been
reworked and dull edges from use as a cutting tool. One or more Type 8 points were found in all
of the floors excavated within all periods of occupation at the site except Rooms 4, 6, and 8.

A large number of “Carlsbad” points were recovered from the Garnsey Spring campsite about 20
km, (12 miles) east of Roswell, New Mexico (Perry and Speth 1984). From the study of edge
angles ect. the following was noted on page 56:
“Most dart points in the sample show heavy wear on the lateral edges (step flaking,
crushing and abrasion) and many seem to have been re-sharpened or reworked. In at least
two cases the tips have been reworked into “Spurs” for graving or boring. In general the
“dart points” appear the have been used for a variety of heavy cutting, scraping and
piercing task, and probably did not serve exclusively or even primarily as weapon
points.”
This appears to be the same situation here at the Merchant site. The dart points in Type 8 to
include the “Carlsbad Points” were probably all used as cutting tools (many hafted knives?). The
unanswered question here is; were they made for this purpose by the occupants of Merchant, or
were they originally made to be used as a “dart point” by earlier Archaic pre-ceramic groups, left
ion local sites, picked up by later people that were living at the Merchant Site and utilized as
cutting tools.
COMMENTS: As I have been interesting in the “Carlsbad Point” for a number of years special
attention was given to them in the examining and recording projectile points from sites within the
Eastern Jornada Area. They are found in large numbers on a number of sites that appear to have
only ceramic period occupations with little or no Archaic. These will usually about all the styles
in Type 8. Many of these will appear to have been reworked or re-sharpened with dull lateral
edges (from use?). A number of sites in the Eastern Jornada Area, especially in the southern part
south of US 62-180, (More of the sites in the north show to have a number of different periods of
occupation) that appear to have been occupied only within the Archaic Periods; recovered only
dart points, no arrow points or ceramics. Usually a number of “Carlsbad Points” and other Type 8
are recorded from these sites. In general, even though many may appear to have been reworked,
with close examination it will show that they were originally made this way. Occasionally one
will be re-sharpened indicating the point had been broken but was still useable. Rarely do any in
these collections have dull lateral edges.
A wide variety of materials was used in the manufacture of the Type 8-D, Carlsbad Points,
including those recovered from the “Merchant Site”. (This wide a range is not found in the small
arrow points as they will usually reflect a local gravel source). No specific source of materials
used in the dart points has been identified however, locals where some of the cherts are present
(not necessarily the only local they are present), this includes a large area of good size Triassic
gravels are plentiful around the Mescalero Point-Sands area in the north, mapping sites in the
southern Sacramento Mountain area south of Weed, New Mexico where unfinished, broken and
complete Carlsbad points have been found and along the eastern slopes of the Guadalupe
Mountains west of Carlsbad. This could be expected as some of the sources of the materials used
as it is about the range of the heaviest distribution of the Carlsbad point. The Late Archaic people
who made and used these points were nomadic and had a considerable area of travels and or

living as indicated. There seem to be a considerable larger number of larger blades, bifaces ect
used as cutting tools found on sites occupied with the Late Archaic period than the sites primarily
occupied during the Ceramic Periods. The larger cutting tools are made of similar materials as the
dart points and as it was suitable material; it was there and they were there it was used. Some of
the material used could have been obtained from any number or cources here in southeastern New
Mexico in the form of gravels east of the Pecos River but the larger gravels are not plentiful in
some of the gravel beds.
On the other hand during the late ceramic periods they were occupying more permanent sites and
their area of activity was much smaller. These sites are always located around a source of water
and with few exceptions the water source is within and area where the Triassic Formation is
exposed and of course this means that gravels are available for lithic tools. Usually the gravel is
large enough for the arrow points and small tools but the larger blades and bifaces would have to
be made from materials from somewhere else where they would have to travel for some distance
to obtain or secure it through trade. Probably because of the scarcity of suitable material is reason
for the lack of many of the larger cutting tools found on these sites. Under these conditions, if the
dart points were laying around on the surface of earlier sites in the area, why not pick them up,
take them home and have a ready made cutting tool.

Outline is oval or triangular, made from primary and secondary flakes knocked from local chert
gravels (Figure 4.15). A small number were made of a local siliceous light colored quartz. There
is a steeply chipped straight to convex or curved bit on larger end. A large number are chipped on
both sides but not near as steeply. The small end is usually rounded or with a flat vertical surface

with the cortex remaining also with a striking platform and the bulb of percussion visible on the
internal surface which in most specimens is concave. A few do have a pointed end with no cortex.
Outer or top surface is completely chipped removing all of the cortex. Those made from the
interior or secondary flakes are usually chipped on large end with steeply chipped curved bit and
very little or no work on the sides. Two with pointed ends appeared to have been used for boring.
Out of the 62 in the Leslie collection, length are; 55 from 1.5 to 2.5 cm, six are from 2.5 to 3 cm.
Only one is slightly over 3 cm. Fifty-seven are made of local chert (gravels) and five are made of
local light color quartz.
SIDE SCRAPERS:
Number recorded 46
These are made from large flakes or cores of local quartzite and white quartzite (Figure 4.15). A
few made of chert suggest non-local materials. One steep angled chipped edge is present on one
side. Outline is triangular and irregular, length to 7 cm, thickness to 2 cm.
COMBINATION SIDE AND END SCRAPERS:
Number recorded 19
Most are rectangular in outline with one side and one end with steeply chipped edge angles
(Figure 4.15). Two are finished round end both sides. One is finished on both ends and both sides.
Materials are of local quartzite and white quartz with many of the larger specimens made from
non-local? cherts though to be intrusive from the south in the Edwards Plateau Trans-Pecos areas
of Texas. Items made of this non-local chert is much more common within the later periods at the
site and one in the earlier period.
Length to 9 cm, thickness 4.5 cm

Figure 4.15 Merchant Site Small End Scrapers, Side Scrapers, and Combination Side and End
Scrapers
DRILLS
Number recorded 22
Drills were not common and most of those recovered were from the later periods of occupation at
the site (Figure 4.16, 4.18 and 4.19). Many were fragments; either the base with the point missing

or the point only. Bases were worked and amounted to 1/3 of the length of the total length. Two
were re-worked from projectile points. Length 4 cm to 7 cm, one point section was 7.5 cm in
length. Material; local chert (smallest) non-local chert larger items.
BIFACE TOOLS

LEAF SHAPED KNIVES
Total number recorded 26
These are biface tools (usually thin) with one dull point and the other end rounded (Figure 4.16 to
4.19). Both sides have been chipped for a cutting edge and usually appear dull from use (?). Few
are complete. Length from 6 to 10 cm, width to 2 cm. Like the other tools recovered, the smaller
specimens reflect local materials while the larger specimens appear to be non-local chert common
to the south in Texas.
FOUR BLADE ALTERNATE BEVELED KNIVES
Total number recorded 10
Only four of these were complete and appeared to have been about worn out and discarded
9Figure 4.17). Three were fragments on one end broken in about the center. Three were center
portions with both ends missing.
This type of knife is very rare in Southeastern New Mexico more commonly reported from
Central Texas and also from the Texas panhandle. Collins (1968) reports several from the
Andrews Lake Site. Here in southeastern New Mexico: when the time period can be determined
they appear to be late. Materials are of a fine grade of chert usually a light to dark gray and is not
to be found locally. Length runs to 8 cm.
OVAL KNIVES
Total number recorded 7
These are biface cutting tools oval to circular in outline. All have been finished with a cutting
edge completely around the outer edges of the specimen and very sharp in some and dull in
others.

Some may be the results of re-working other shaped or broken or worn bifaces. Diameters, 3 to 5
cm, thickness 1 to 1.2 cm. Two appear to made of local chert. The remaining five suggest a
material from outside the area, possibly to the south, southeast in Texas.
TRIANGULAR BIFACE KNIVES
Total recorded 23
These are similar to the leaf shaped knives only they have straight to slightly concave bases.
Width will range from 2.5 to 5 cm, length from 5 cm to 9 cm and thickness from 1 to 1.3 cm.
Most specimens are of material that suggest an orgin from outside the Eastern Jornada Area,
possibly from south in Texas.
Several miscellaneous biface tools were recovered. Only a few of these were entered into the
record. These were listed as “blanks”, “crude knives” and “crude thick tools”.

CHOPPERS
Number recorded 13
These are large flakes and or cores of large quartzite and chert gravels. Three are made of local
quartz. Uniface or biface chopping bit is restricted to one end or side. Irregular shapes are
[present to include oval, rectangular and sub-triangular. Lengths are 8 to 12 cm. All are somewhat
crude and show only enough workmanship to make a tool to perform the job.

Figure 4.19 Biface Knifes and Drill recovered from the Merchant Site
STONE DIGGING TOOLS
Total number recorded 11
Most of these are what appear to be one hand digging or grubbing tools. Two were larger and was
used by both hands. One was notched near the smaller end and could have been hafted. Shaping
was by crudely chipping where necessarily long edges to form a desired size and shape. Outline is

either rectangular with a rounded top and dull point on other end or triangular with rounded top
and dull point at other end. The top is shaped and smoothed to fit the hand. Material is usually a
hard form of caliche. Two are made from large flat quartzite cobbles.
Complete specimens are 122 to 22 cm in length, 7 to 12 cm in width and 3 to 6 cm thick.
PECKED AND GROUND TOOLS
HEAVY MAULS:

Total number recorded 5
These are large heavy Dolomite or quartzite boulders with both ends well battered from use
(Figure 4.20). Three of the five recorded natural concave sides near center and the other two had
concavities formed on opposite sides near the center by pecking. This was done possibly so they
could be hafted and used like a “sledge hammer”. The measurements included length 20 to 28
cm, width 8 to 12 cm, and thickness 5 to 8 cm.
These heavy mauls along with the above digging tools are common on sites within the Eastern
Jornada that have pit rooms dug into bedrock caliche. In years past they were found on the
surface but today is usually only while excavating.
The two appear to be associated to each other as tools in digging the rooms. After working a hole
through the top hard crust in the caliche, the lower softer material was dug out undermining the
harder upper crust which was then broken off by heavy mauls.
This was the common process we used in the 1930’s to dig numerous cess pools as most were too
poor to use or have someone use dynamite. We did have a bit more modern tools: a pick to dig
out the softer material and a 8 or 12 pound sledge hammer to break off the harder upper curst that
could not be penetrated by a pick.
While excavating a unfinished pitroom being dug into caliche bedrock at the Monument Spring
Site (Leslie 1968) one of these heavy mauls was recovered from the pile of caliche rocks that had
been thrown out of the pit while it had been dug. Two “digging tools” were recovered from the
bottom of the pit. The north side of the pit had a finished face like a masonry wall. The south wall
where they apparently were still expanding when they hit the softer caliche dug out
underpinching the upper hard crust for about 12 in.

Heavy Maul; C, D, E – Convex Face Manos; Note Drilled Hole in “D”. B: A and B, Heavy
Mauls; C – Sandstone Pestle
About three years after our excavations at the Boot Hills Site, Corley and Leslie 1969, a cache of
heavy tools were uncovered along the east edge of trash mound consisting of five large mauls,
four digging tools and two larger well used hammerstones. Two of the digging tools were made
of quartzite and were more like hand picks. The end for the hand hold on each digging tool had
been badly battered and probably used like a chisel when the caliche was too hard too hard to dig
out by hand. The large hammerstones were probably used as hammers. These tools are recorded
from most of the sites that are known or suspected to have pit rooms but are absent on the earlier
and on non-ceramic occupations here within the Eastern Jornada Area.
SHAFT SMOOTHERS:

Number recorded 4
These are simple tools with one small shallow grooves (n=3) and one that is fragmentary with
two shallow grooves, pecked and ground into a quartzite pebble. Two are made of quartzite, two

are of sandstone. One is a one hand sandstone mano with one convex grinding face grooves were
pecked into the sides to form handhold. A ridge had been formed on the upper surface in which
was one small groove. Length of mano 12 cm. One was made from a quartzite gravel with more
or less triangular cross section. Both ends had some shaping by pecking and grinding. There is
one small groove on top. Diameter 6 cm. The other made of sandstone was tubular with a semiround cross section about 7 cm in length with the single groove extending about ½ around the
surface.
Even though they are rather simple as compared to those usually found to the west, the ones
recovered here at the Merchant site is the only ones known from the Eastern Jornada Area. They
are absent within all of the earlier periods.

Figure 4.21 Merchant Site Shaft Smoothers
HAMMERSTONES:

Total number recorded 69
These are mostly un-modified quartzite pebbles (Figure 4.22). A few had some degree of change
from the original shape and size by use. Some had battering marks on only one end, some on both
ends and occasionally both sides and ends were used. Many pebbles that showed a small amount
of use but the ones entered into the records were well used. The hammerstones were oval in
outline and from 5 cm to 10 cm in diameter. These pebbles were readily available off the ridge to
the west of the site.

Figure 4.22 Merchant Site Hammerstones

CONVEX FACE MANOS:

Total number recorded 71
These are made of sandstone that is very similar to that exposed off the ridge to the west.
Two had two convex grinding surfaces (faces), the remaining 69 had only one grinding surface
with the upper surface being altered enough to make it smooth enough for the handhold (see
Figure 4.20). A small amount of shaping by pecking or grinding along the edge is suggested on
only a few of the specimens. After the rough shaping for the desired size and shape, the
remaining alterations came about from use. Only the mano from the floor of Room 10 also used
as a shaft smoother had grooves along the edges for hand holds.
Outline and cross sections varied. Rectangular to oval, the amount of use seems to determine
which. Many have been worn very small and forming a feathered thin edge on one side or
completely around the specimen. The manos length ranged from 12 to 17 cm, width 9 to 12 cm,
and thickness to 5 cm. All are of the one hand variety. Used with basin metate.
FLAT FACE MANOS:

Total number recorded 50
These are also all made of a local (?) sandstone available off ridge west of site. All have one flat
used surface with the other surface un-used (see Figure 4.20). The outline and size is about the
same as the manos with the convex faces however the thin feathered edges from use are missing
on the flat faced manos. All would be of the one hand variety. Used with the slab metate.
OVAL BASIN METATES:

Total number recorded 32
All of the basin metates recovered from the site had oval outline basins (Figure 4.23). None with
circular or “bowl” basins are in the number from the site, however one was found on the surface
of an earlier occupied site north of the site LCAS E22 and one was also found on the surface
down near the lake at LCAS E23. Twelve of the 32 were complete with the remaining 20
fragments that appear to represent one half or more of the original specimen. All were made of
what appeared to be local sandstone outcropped below the ridge west of the site.
Several have been well shaped and finished by pecking and grinding. Outline is usually
rectangular with the ends rounded, one end is smaller. Some of the smaller specimens are oval in
outline. Two are near 45 cm in length but most are rather small about 25 cm. Width is from 13 to
25 cm and thickness 5 to 9 cm. The depth of the basins probably will reflect the amount of use
from slight to the case of one having been ground through the bottom at which time the metate
was probably discarded.

SLAB METATES:

Total number recorded 18

Eight of these are complete, the remaining 10 are one half or better complete (Figure 4.23). The
flat grinding surface is about all that is different from the basin metates as material, size and
outline is similar. Like the basin type they appeared throughout the site but were not as common
in the latter surface rooms.

Figure 4.23 Upper photo: Oval basin metates from the Merchant Site Lower Photo: Slab metates
from the Merchant Site
PESTLES:
Total number recorded 5

These are long tubular tools circular in outline to flat sides to form an oval outline in cross section
(see Figure 4.20). The cross section of the pestle as well as the outline of the mortar is the results
of the motion used while the grinding or pounding was taking place. Only one had a circular cross
section while the four remaining had oval cross sections with the oval probably the ones used in
the oval outlined mortars uncovered on the site. Materials were sandstone (n=3), caliche (1), and
Dolomite (n=1). What appear to be small fragments of this tool were recovered (not recorded)
that also include an igneous material. Length 18 to 25 cm. Diameter 5 to 7 cm. This is the tool
used in the hand, as the mano used in the metate; these were used with the mortar. The like of or
the scarcity of this tool on or around the suite plus a large number of mortars possibly is the result
of the ones visible on the surface had been collected through the years. The earlier users took the
with them and possibly the people who lived at the Merchant site also used the wooden pestle.
BEDROCK MORTARS:

Number uncovered within site area (on ridge) 14
Two areas just north of Refuse Area A were noticed where the wind had blown away some of the
top soil forming a slight depression void of any vegetation (Figure 4.24 and Figure 4.25). After
removing a few inches of the top down to the caliche bedrock seven mortars were uncovered at
the area farthest to the north and six were found within the other area. Probably there are other
such areas scattered along the ridge around the site.
About 1976 one mortar was uncovered in the caliche bedrock along the edge of the escarpment
just west of Room 1. During the time we were working on the site this particular area was
covered. This leads to the possibility that many more are present along the cliff’s edge but are
presently covered.
All are oval in outline at the top, the walls slope inward with the bottom also oval in outline. The
measurements are pretty much uniform with a length of 20 to 25 cm, width of 17 to 20 cm, and
depth of 20 cm.

ARTIFACTS OF BONE
ANTLER:

Total number recorded 3
Several fragments of antlers were recovered that had any sign of use. These were not recorded
and not included here. Two of the three recorded that did show some use on the tip and on the
side where concavities and been formed by use. The third only had wear on the tip. Lengths were
12, 14 and 15 cm.
AWLS:

Total number recorded 43
About one half of the awls recovered appeared to be complete and these were usually recovered
from trash deposits mixed with ashes or some depth below the surface (Figure 4.26). Those found

in shallow deposits were quite fragile and had under gone a lot of deterioration even though they
could have originally been complete at the time they were either lost or discarded.
A number of different bone and parts were used but the most common was split joint section of
leg bone of deer or antelope. Different degrees of grinding on some of the joint ends had just
about obliterated the joint section, other had little or no amount of alteration. A few specimens
were possibly broken and the point fragment was still in use with the broken end rounded off.
These were usually shorter. Other could be within the “splinter awl” type. Length will vary from
6 cm to 16 cm within the complete specimens.
NOTCHED BONE:

Number recorded 44 (all fragments)
The largest fragments recovered were about 9 cm. in length, most were smaller. The common
bone used was the rib of deer or antelope as well as a few made from leg bone of unidentifiable
animal. Notches were placed 1.5 to 2 cm apart along the flat incurved side of the rib. As only
fragments were recovered the original length is unknown. One was found with burial at Bell Lake
that was complete had a length of 39 cm. The notches on some of the fragments were along the
narrow edge of the bone (rib?). A few were made from unidentifiable animal leg bones.
These are usually referred to as “rhythm” bones or “noise makers”. The noise made by raking the
notched surface with another bone or stick. This type of artifact is present within the “Ochoa
Phase” only as they are absent in the earlier periods of the Eastern Jornada.

Figure 4.26 Outline of bone awls from the Merchant Site (Approximate actual size)
CARVED BONE:

Total number recorded 8
Fragments only were recovered, mostly end fragments of a solid round bone (possibly rib).
Diameter was usually about 2.5 cm. One or two shallow grooves were carved completely around
the specimen about 2 cm from the end and which had been rounded off. One center section had
crude geometric designs carved on both sides. No holes for suspension were present on any of the
fragments.

STONE PENDANTS
Total number recorded 5
These are small groundstone of various outlines, rectangular, oval and triangular. All had one
hole drilled with a bevel from both sides. Materials were; quartzite (n=2), sandstone (n=2), and
red ochre (n=1). Length or diameter ran from 2 cm to 3 cm.
ARTIFACTS OF SHELL
FRESH WATER MUSSEL SHELL

Total number recorded 31
These are all small pendants and beads made from mussel shell. There are a number of forms to
include; rectangular, oval, circular as well as other irregular shapes. One that was fragmentary
appeared to part of some type of effigy. Most are rather simply made. Many are only fragments
usually fractured at the suspension hole leaving a part of the hole on the fragments, Although
most had or showed the existence of a drilled hole originally, a few were only a plain shell piece
that had been shaped round or rectangular with edges notched but no suspension hole.
RAW FRESH WATER MUSSEL SHELL

Total number recorded 11
Mussel shell was more common the site than is indicated by the 11 only that happened to be
saved and recorded, these wound up in some of the sacks. Like the bone most were not saved or
recorded.
When investigators find mussel shell on sites within the Eastern Jornada Area they are reported as
coming out of the Pecos River. Maybe so in a few instances, but I rather think they were taken
from many of the fresh water lakes. Many of the local sites around fresh water lakes will have
mussel shells scattered over the surface, however after being exposed from a time and blown
around they soon become only small slivers.

Figure 4.27 Shell artifacts from the Merchant Site
Many fragments are usually visible within the lake bed west of the site as well as others in the
area after dry spells and high winds in the spring. These were probably the remains of mussels
that were ijn the lake when it dried up. We found no direct evidence that they were used for food
but assume that they were.

OLIVELLA SHELL:
Total number recorded 11
These small Olivella shells show no alterations other than the small end ground off enough to
expose the inside cavity in preparation for stringing. These were not found in any concentrations
but scattered throughout the site. This type shell was not common on the sites within the Eastern
Jornada Area and are found mostly on sites that were occupied within the latter periods. This is
the only ornament found on the site that came from outside the Eastern Jornada area (Usually
reported as from the Lower California Area?).

CHAPTER 5 CERAMICS FROM THE “MERCHANT SITE”

CERAMICS FROM THE MERCHANT SITE
Ceramics, by sherd count was the most numerous artifact type from the site of which a total of
11,432 was recovered and identified. This was by no means the number of sherds on the site as
many were not saved by some parties and many that were saved were not made available from
this report.
Fifteen types and/or variants of types have been identified in the collection. Only one type, Ochoa
Indented (Figure 5.2) along with three subtypes Ochoa Plain, Ochoa Plain Corrugated and Ochoa
Plain corrugated and Ochoa Smudged are considered to be of the local types, made on site or
other area Ochoa Phase sites.
The paste and temper materials in two types Roswell Plain Brown and Roswell Plain Corrugated
is readily available within many areas of the Eastern Jornada Mogollon east of the Pecos River
and although not made on the site it was most likely made east of the Pecos River (Runyan and
Hedrick 1973 and Runyan n.d.).
This same materials appear in many of the El Paso Polychrome sherds from the site and other
local sites south of U.S. 62-180 that suggest an occupation a little earlier than the Merchant Site,
or within the Post Maljamar Pre-Ochoa Period A.D. 1300 – 1350? This also suggest that some of
the El Paso Polychrome could have been made east of the Pecos River (Runyan n.d.).
Five types, Three Rivers Red-on-terracotta, Lincoln Black-on-red, Glaze A Red, Glaze A Yellow
and Chupadero Black-on-white are considered to be intrusive to the site as well as the Eastern
Jornada Area either directly or indirectly from the Sierra Blanca, Chupadero Mesa or other
Central New Mexico Areas.
Three types also intrusive to the site and the Eastern Jornada Area directly or indirectly from
southwestern New Mexico, eastern Arizona, and/or northern Chihuahua, Mexico are; Gila
Polychrome, Ramos Polychrome, and Playas Incised.
The origin of two highly polished black incised bowl sherds has not been determined as they were
not identified as to type.
Sherds of the types not examined for their temper materials by Runyan (nd) were closely
examined visually and compared with sample sherds from areas considered to be the most likely
center of areas where these types were made.
In the following discussion of each type when the temper materials are not given the sherds
appear and are considered as typical representatives of that type. The type identifications are my
own. Also in the discussions, if comparisons are made to other local areas of the Eastern Jornada
Area and/or other periods the schemes as devised by Corley (1965) and Leslie (1977-1979) from
the Eastern Jornada Mogollon Area are used.

Much of the information in the above titles was the results of a site inventory and surface
collection from over 300 sites within the Eastern Jornada Area, extreme southeastern New
Mexico between 1955 and 1975. The other was obtained from a number of excavations. Most of
these sites are on file with the Bureau of Land Management District 6 office in Roswell and have
been given a BLM number. A number of these are also on file with the Laboratory of
Anthropology at Santa Fe and have been given an LA number.

OCHOA INDENTED BROWNWARE
Number of sherds recorded 10,829
HISTORY:
First named and described and published in “Facts and Artifacts” Newsletter of the Lea County
Archaeological Society Vol. I, No. 2, July, 1965 (Leslie 1965A). Also reported and described by
Michael B. Collins in his report of The Andrews Lake Locality M.A. Thesis University of Texas
at Austin (Collins 1968).
The description given here includes portions of both these given by Leslie and Collins, as well as
many additions.
AREA OF DISTRIBUTION:
These ceramics are known from southeastern Eddy, southern Lea and from the surface of a few
seasonally occupied sites, and one as far north as the “Mescalero White Sands”, (LCAS Site No.
A51) in southeastern Chaves County. All are east of the Pecos River.
They are also south into Loving and Winkler, east into Gaines, Andrews and Dawson counties in
Texas. Collins reports sherds from Glasscock and a site on Lacy Creek in Sterling counties also in
Texas.
TYPE SITE:
“The Merchant Site”, LCAS Site Number E4, BLM Number AR30-6-31, located in south central
Lea County, New Mexico.
NAME:
The name is taken from the no longer existing community of “Ochoa” about 15 miles northwest
of Jal and south of the “Merchant Site”. Ochoa was known throughout the area during
“prohibition” in the 1920’s and early oil boom days in southeastern New Mexico and near by
west Texas for that good “Ochoa Whiskey”. Many of the areas Old Timers were very familiar
with it and referred to it as “that fighting Ochoa Whiskey”.
DATE:
It is originally suggested by Leslie as A.D. 1375 – 1425 based on dated intrusive decorated
ceramics. Collins suggested sometime within the period, A.D. 1300 – 1500 although neither is a
firm date, evidence at the Merchant Site may suggest that a beginning date there was around A.D.

1350 or shortly thereafter. There appears to be an absence of any intrusive decorated types or for
any intrusive ceramics at all during the latest period of occupation, (Period 3). It is not known at
this time if this period at the site is later than the dates that these intrusive types were being made
or if for some other unknown reason they were not available. The total length of time that the
Merchant Site was occupied was first thought to be about 50 years. Presently it is thought to have
been much longer than that. A date of A.D. 1350 to 1500 or a short time later is suggested or
some parts there of. Until better dates are obtained this date will have to be tentative.
DERIVATION:
Probably and Eastern Variety of Roswell Brown and/or Roswell Corrugated. Reported as
Northern Area Brown and Northern Area Corrugated (Leslie 1979).
METHOD OF CONSTRUCTION:
Coiled
PASTE:
Jars; Color: Dark brown to black and light to dark gray and tan. Many jars show use as cooking
vessels and these were usually always black throughout the past; the exterior core and interior.
Bowls; Bowls apparently were not used for cooking vessels and these sherds have a wide range of
colors to include gray, reddish-tan, light to dark tan, olive tan, light to dark brown and black.
TEXTURE:
Moderately compact to very friable.
TEMPER:
The temper includes crushed caliche, medium to very coarse. Some particles so large they
protrude through one and sometimes both surfaces of vessel walls. Some of the particles are over
5 mm but most are around 3 mm. Many of the larger particles are not caliche and have smooth
rounded edges on one or more sides, appear to be crushed small gravel and are usually dark gray
to black in color. A few small flakes of light colored mica (biotite) in some sherds and fine to
medium rounded sand grains. All of this material, except the caliche can be found as inclusions in
some locale sandstone outcropping in about the same proportions. Suggesting the possibility that
they were using crushed sandstone and crushing burned and un-burned caliche.
WALLS:
Thickness of walls vary from 0.4 to 1 cm. The amount of rubbing and scraping and obliterating of
indentations will contribute to most of these variations. Most bowl sherds are not distinguishable
from those of jars but those that are generally thinner than jars.
SURFACE FINISH:
EXTERIOR; the coils on the exterior of vessels apparently were all indented. Some were very
uniform, other were irregular and haphazard. The uniform indentations were more commonly

within the upper portions of the vessels; necks and rims of jars and the rims of bowls. Although
there is a variation in the size of the indentations on different sherds they are usually uniform on
any one sherd. Various amounts of rubbing, scraping, and raking of indentations on many sherds,
resulting in obliteration of them leaving a very uneven rough bumpy surface but never smooth.
From limited restoration of a few vessels, both jars and bowls, some vessels had both of these
finishes. The uniform indentations along the rims and necks graduated to a rubbed scraped finish
along the shoulder and bottom of vessel.
It is sometime referred to as “finger indented”. I am not ruling out that possibly some of the
indentations were made with the finger or more likely thumb but there is a variation of the width
of the indentations from slightly less than 1 cm to more than 2 cm. Like Collins (1968) I did some
experimenting with modeling clay to try and determine if some other tools might have been used
other that the finger-thumb to make some of the indentations.
I had examined hundreds of indented sherds with a low powered reading glass and I was not
convinced that what I was seeing was actually finger prints, neither could I find any sign of a nail
imprint in the paste. Assuming that if in fact had finger nails at least some should remain. The
process included rolling out coils of modeling clay, placing one on top of the other and pressing
the top coil over the lower coil with finger, thumb and eventually several different small, fine
chipped end scrapers from the Merchant Site. At first I was using fairly stiff (dry) clay. The
results was that the finger thumb imprint as well as the nail print was very visible without the
reading glass, finger prints were not easily recognized as such without the reading glass however.
The pattern of the flake scars on the scrapers was distinguishable as such but not too much
different than the finger prints. This was repeated several times using all fingers and thumbs on
both hands as well as the smallest and largest of the scrapers. The results were all about the same.
In comparing the indentations in width with many of the indentations on the sherds I found a
much similarity between these and those made by small end scrapers but very little in those made
with the fingers. I repeated this same procedure with softer clay, more pliable and the results were
the same. This little experiment of course is not all that conclusive but it helped me to maintain
the impression that these end scrapers, plentiful on the site was primarily used to indent the
pottery.
Bonding of the coils are poor on the indented surfaces of all vessels where pressing down on the
lower coil of the indentations was the only sealing of the vessel walls on the exteriors. Although
the smoothing or polishing of the interiors helped, it was still not enough to prevent the
commonly fracturing horizontally between the coils leaving a convex-concave edge on the sherds
at break and separating the coils. The sherds with a great amount of rubbing and scraping on the
exteriors do not show this as much and fracture vertically as well as horizontally.
A low degree of firing and/or inferior materials used may also contribute to this.
INTERIORS; Jar interiors are always smoothed rarely semi-polished. Bowls are semi-polished,
rarely just smoothed. About 20 percent of bowls appear to have intentional smudging on interiors
and these sherds always have a well-executed polish.

VESSEL FORMS:
Information of vessel forms and size are limited as no complete vessels have been recovered, only
sherds. However from rim sherds and limited restoration amounting to only a few sherds of any
one vessel, but of both jars and bowls. We were not able to determine any accurate measurements
or size of any vessel, but both small to medium jars and medium bowls were present.
Collins (1968, A Fig. 28) was able to restore one jar enough to determine a vessel form similar to
that illustrated in Figure x.x with a height of 25 cm, diameter of 35 cm and the mouth opening
about 15.5 cm. This appeared as the most popular jar form at the Merchant Site as could be
determined from the rim sherds studied.
VESSEL FORM AS ILLUSTRATED IN FIGURE 5.1

No vessels were restored enough to determine any accurate measurements so these are not to
scale, but do reflect the forms as indicated by the sherds.
BOWLS:
As determined by rim sherds and limited reconstruction of a few vessels at least two variations of
bowl forms are present.
A: Those with rounded bottoms and vertical walls and slightly incurved rims.
B: Bottoms are rounded but not as wide as “A”. Walls taper out and rims are straight.
Lips are rounded on both interiors and exteriors; or rounded on exteriors and slightly beveled on
interiors.
JARS:
C: In Refuse Area “A” and on the floors of the surface rooms, several rims sherds were recovered
and enough sherds for limited restoration on one vessel that some vessels were much smaller than
most jars. These have rounded bottoms weak shoulders long necks in proportion to vessel size
slightly flaring rims and small mouths.
D: Rounded bottoms, wide mouth gently outward sloping necks and short vertical rims and weak
shoulders.
E This type seems to be the most common of the jar, rounded bottoms wide mouths, short out
curved necks and strong shoulders. Rims are flared. Lips are rounded on exterior and interior
rounded exteriors and slightly beveled interiors or rounded interiors and slightly beveled exterior.
No evidence of any kind of attached handle was found.

OCHOA BROWN WARE VARIANTS
OCHOA PLAIN BROWN
Number of sherds recorded: 47

The sherds placed in this variety of Ochoa are in every way identical to Ochoa Indented in paste,
temper, and color; the difference being in the exterior finish which is smoothed to a well-executed
polish, The interiors are the same.
All sherds recovered are from the early part of the Ochoa Phase; not only at the Merchant Site but
at all other Ochoa sites as well.
A small jar was partly restored from sherds recovered from the surface of LCAS E23 (down near
the lake). It is suggested a vessel form and flaring but not thickened rim, as El Paso Polychrome.
The paste and temper however was the same as Ochoa.
OCHOA PLAIN CORRUGATED
Number of sherds recorded: 32
The sherds placed in this variety of Ochoa are in every way identical to Ochoa Indented in paste,
temper and color; the difference being in the textured exterior finish. The plain coils are similar to
Eastern Roswell Corrugated with plain corrugations that have been rubbed to partly smooth them
out.
Like Ochoa Plain Brown, this variety appears early in the Ochoa Phase not only at the Merchant
Site but other Ochoa Phase sites as well.
OCHOA INDENTED SMUDGED
Number of sherds recorded: Not tabulated
This variety seems restricted to the indented bowls. In a small sample of one hundred identifiable
bowl sherds twenty or twenty percent were of the smudged variety.
This appeared to be intentional smudging of bowl interior leaving a blackened semi to highly
polished surface.

ROSWELL PLAIN POLISHED BROWN
(LOCAL VARIETY)
In the 29 sherds placed in this type only jars are recognized of which three rim sherds are present.
The outward appearance, a well executed polish on the exteriors with no polishing marks,
interiors well smoothed, rarely are the larger temper particles visible on either surface, color
usually light brown or tan will compare with the outer description of Roswell Brown by Jelinek
(1967). The interior paste appears somewhat similar also however the identifying characteristic,
the red specks (identified as oxidized feldspar) by Jelinek are absent in the Eastern variety of

Roswell Brown. Sherds collected from a few sites to the west of Mescalero Sands, north from
Diamond Mound to Sardine Mountain show the Roswell Brown in the collections is mostly
sherds with the reddish particles in the paste but are rare to absent in sherds east and south of this
area.
Roswell Brown was not separated from Jornada Brown and Runyan and Hedrick (1973) but the
listed temper types, E, F, and G are identified in Roswell with the more common consisting of
Gypsum and coarse to medium quartz sand grains (crushed sandstone from the Triassic
Formation) (Runyan n.d.). These materials are readily available within the Eastern Jornada Area.
This the variety of brown referred to as Northern Area Brown by Leslie (1979). It is the common
variety of brownware found on the midden-pitroom sites of earlier periods within the area of the
Mescalero Ridge-Mescalero Sands north from Maljamar to U.S. 380.
This is also the variety of plain brown along with El Paso Polychrome. Roswell Corrugated and
several of the latest (for the Eastern Jornada Area) intrusive decorated types, in the collections
from the surface of sites south of U.S. 62-180. The occupations on these sites are tentative dated
around A.D. 1300-1350 or just prior to the Ochoa Phase. These dates are referred to as the Post
Maljamar-Pre Ochoa Period by Leslie (1979).
The validity of Roswell Brown as a separate type has been questioned when it appears as
intrusive consisting of only a few sherds on sites where El Paso and Jornada Brown are the
common brownware. However little (almost none) archaeological studies have been conducted
within the area where this type (Eastern Variety) is the more common brownware. Here it occurs
as the most easily identified and the most common brownware variety. It has much less variations
in visual appearance in finish and paste from early to late with the only change being in rim forms
of the jars from a more direct longer neck to a shorter neck and flaring rims.
The dates that are given to Roswell Brown (usually estimates) range from A.D. 900 to 1250 and
A.D. 900 to 1300. As a suggestion I would like to date it here within the Eastern Jornada Area at
A.D. 950 to 1300 in the north but as late as A.D. 1350 or maybe later within the area south of
U.S. 62-180. This would have it lasting longer that other brownware types within the Jornada
Mogollon.

ROSWELL PLAIN CORRUGATED
(LOCAL VARIETY)
The 19 sherds placed in this type consist of one bowl rim and two jar rims. The remaining are
body sherds and could not be determined whether bowl or jar.
This type has the same paste, temper and color, a slight brown or tan as the above discussed
eastern variety of Roswell Plain Brown, with the difference being the plain rubbed corrugations
on the exterior of both bowls and jars. The interior surfaces are well smoothed and semi-polished
on both bowls and jars. Although it was not found on any of the sherds found at the Merchant Site

sherds from other sites within the Eastern Jornada Area some bowl sherds have highly polished
interiors.
These have been referred to as Northern Area Corrugated (Leslie 1979). This is the type of sherds
that have been mentioned as Ochoa with only sand temper from other areas by Runyan and
Hedrick, (1973) and are not Ochoa but Roswell Corrugated and are visually different from the
Ochoa Plain Corrugated. I was able to examine some of the sherd collections from sites reporting
corrugated sand tempered Ochoa along the Eastern Caprock and would identify them as Roswell
Corrugated with a slightly earlier date or within the Post-Maljamar Pre-Ochoa Period.

EL PASO POLYCHROME
Ninety-one sherds are identified as this type. All appear to be from jars. Sixty-two of the sherds
have designs of black and red paint or, as many of the sherds are so small only one of the colors,
either black or red are present. Twenty-nine sherds have no paint at all but as they compare to the
painted sherds in color, paste, thinness, ect and as no other similar type such as El Paso Brown is
found on the site they are all considered El Paso Polychrome.
Eighteen are rim sherds. All are typical rim forms for the El Paso Polychrome type with
thickened rims and flat or rounded lips. Rims flair out and the portion of short necks is very thin.
Most jars appear to be of medium size and will compare favorably with El Paso Polychrome
sherds that I have examined from the Roswell, Rio Bonito and Corona areas rather than from
those from the El Paso area. Exteriors have a good polish with polishing marks rare or absent;
interiors are smoothed to semi-polished. The base color is usually a dark brown but some are
lighter brown. The visible temper particles are not as pronounced as is on most of the El Paso
Polychrome from areas to the west of the Pecos River. Dark cores are rare. The vessel form of
medium size, short necks and flaring rims are similar to jar forms of Roswell Brown (late) and
Ochoa Indented.
In examining the temper in the El Paso Polychrome from the “Merchant Site” and other local
sites south of U.S. 62-180 Runyan found the sherds from the Merchant site and many of those
from other local sites had gypsum and coarse to medium quartz sand, (thought to come from
crushed Triassic sandstone readily available locally (Runyan n.d.).
This type began to appear in small amounts on the surface of a few sites within the Eastern
Jornada Area during the late Maljamar Phase or after A.D. 1200. It’s great popularity was within
the area south of U.S. 62-180 during the Post-Maljamar Pre-Ochoa Period or just prior to the
Ochoa Phase.
Dates given to El Paso Polychrome vary from A.D. 1100 – 1350 and A.D. 1200-1400. Although
some of this type most likely made within the Eastern Jornada Area; none is thought to have been
made at the Merchant Site.

THREE RIVERS RED-ON-TERRACOTTA
Sixteen sherds of this type are identified in the collection. All are from bowls of which four are
rim sherds. All have decorations in a pale red consisting of as many as four narrow lined running
around the vessel interiors near the rim. The lips of the rim sherds are painted red, two have
rounded lips and two are flat with slightly incurved rims.
The color of all sherds was the typical terracotta one of the identifying characteristics for this
type. Two of the sherds have gray exteriors (fire-clouds); the remaining 14 have the same
terracotta color on both interior and exterior. The interiors are well polished, exteriors are
smoothed to semi-polished. Three Rivers Red-on-terracotta was a common intrusive decorated
type within the Eastern Jornada Area a bit earlier than A.D. 1200 or throughout the Maljamar
Phase especially in the north. It was usually rare on sites south of U.S. 62-180 within the postMaljamar Pre-Ochoa Period and appeared early here at the Merchant site. The dates given to this
type are A.D. 1150 – 1350.

LINCOLN BLACK-ON-RED
Thirty-six sherds in the collection are identified as Lincoln Black-on-red. All are from bowls of
which seven are rim sherds. All have black decorations on interiors consisting of horizontal fine
lines near rims or a combination of lines and small triangles. All of the lips are painted. It is not
uncommon when Lincol Black-on-red and Three Rivers Red-on-terracotta appear together on
sites within the Eastern Jornada Area that the base color of the vessels are the same usually red
rather than terracotta. The sherds from the Merchant site however are; Three Rivers all a
terracotta color and all of the Lincoln sherds are red. This type appears on the surface of a small
number of sites within the Eastern Jornada north of Maljamar, but here only a few sherds.
Because of other presumed associated ceramics this suggest an occupation after the Maljamar
Phase or A.D. 1300. It is usually common on sites south of U.S. 62-180 occupied within the PostMaljamr Pre-Ochoa Period or from A.D. 1300 to around A,.D. 1350. It appears to have been one
of the latest intrusive types at the Merchant Site up to around A.D. 1400.
Dates given to Lincoln Black-on-red are within the period A.D. 1300-1400.
There were a number of sherds of both Three Rivers Red-on-terracotta and Lincoln Black-on-red
that had no paint. As they as well as the number of each type has been misplaced or lost this data
is not included in this report.

RIO GRANDE GLAZE A RED
Fifty-three sherds are identified as this type in the collection. Forty-five are bowl sherds of which
seven are rims. Eight are jars sherds of which two are rims.
Bowls are well polished on interiors and exteriors and slipped or well fired to marron. Exteriors
are unpainted, interiors have thin black glaze decorations near the rims on the rim sherds. As the

portion of the vessel where the other bowl body sherds are from is unknown, as the location of
the decorations within the vessels are also unknown. All body sherds are painted.
The eight jar sherds have thin black glaze decorations on the exteriors. The two rims sherds
indicate the vessels have short necks, direct rims and medium mouths. These eight jar sherds are
the only jar sherds recorded from the Eastern Jornada Area east of the Pecos River.
Glaze A Red is rare and found on only a few sites within the Northern Eastern Jornada Area.
These sites were occupied after A.D. 1300. It is common on sites south of U.S. 62-180 on sites
occupied during the Post-Maljamar Pre-Ochoa Period and still more common within the Ochoa
Phase. These sherds are intrusive to the Merchant Site, directly or indirectly from the Middle Rio
Grande Area in Central New Mexico.
Glaze A on Red is dated to A.D. 1300 to 1425+.

RIO GRANDE GLAZE A ON YELLOW
(CIENIGUILLA GLAZE ON YELLOW)
Twenty-eight sherds are identified as this type. Twenty-three are bowl sherds of which two are
rims. Five are jar sherds.
Exteriors of bowls are slipped with a cream to light yellow. Interiors are slipped with the same
color with black glaze paint decorations.
Exteriors of jars are also slipped with a light yellow and decorations in black glaze paint. Interiors
are smoothed but are un-slipped and un-painted.
These Glaze A Yellow vessels were intrusive to the Merchant Site, directly or indirectly from as
far away as the Galisteo Basin south of Santa Fe.
This type is recorded on only two other sites within the Eastern Jornada Area, E25, “Bell Lake”
and D20, Pearl Valley. Both are south of U.S. 62-180 in Lea County; both were occupied within
the Ochoa Phase. Collins (1968) reports this type from the Andrews Lake Site in Andrews
County, Texas, also an Ochoa Phase Site.
Glaze A on Yellow has been dated to A.D. 1350 to 1425.

CHUPADERO BLACK-ON-WHITE
One hundred seventy-seven sherds of Chupadero Black-on-white were recovered from the
“Merchant Site”. Thirty-eight are bowl sherds of which eight are rims. One hundred thirty-nine
are jar sherds of which two are from handles, 11 are from the rims of the vessels and 126 are
body sherds.
Nineteen of the bowls sherds were recovered from the floor of Room 4 in a pile (cache?)
illustrated in Figures 5.3 and 5.4. Five of these were rims sherds; 14 were body sherds. Seven of
the remaining bowl body sherds were recovered from the upper concentrated trash deposits, (B)

within Refuse “C” see Figure x.x. and restored to one large sherd. By the apparent contour of the
sherds the diameter of the vessel was some 12 inches. This left only 12 bowl sherds found in all
of the areas of the site. The eight bowl sherds had black decorations on the interior surfaces,
including rims and lips. The interiors are slipped with a thin light gray the same color as the paste.
The exteriors are roughly smoothed with a sandy surface, no striations are visible.
The two jar handles were, (1) three small ropes placed together and (2) one large rope flattened
and scored in center to imitate two ropes. The 11 jar rim sherds were all from small mouth vessels
with outward flaring rims. The interiors are smoothed and slipped with a light gray down about
three inches below the lip, but unpainted. The body portion was striated. One hundred four of the
jar sherds are from body portions, all have a light gray slip and decorations in a black paint. The
other 22 body sherds have no paint decorations. These were probably from lower portions of the
vessels.
Rare sherds of Red Mesa Black-on-white and Cebelleta Black-on-white were recorded from a
few sites with an occupation within the earlier ceramic period, (Queracho Phase) all up around
U.S. 380 or the Mescalero Point Mescalero sands area. Mimbres Black-on-white is recorded on a
larger number of sites and on some of these several sherds have been found; these sites are as far
south as U.S. 62-180 and on sites that appear to be occupied a bit later maybe as late as A.D.
1200,
On most of the sites Chupadero Black-on-white is to be found on the surface. It appears to have
been the most common within the Late Maljamar Phase (A.D. 1200-1300). Within thre Eastern
Jornada Area east of the Pecos River Chupadero Black-on-white suggest it to be intrusive from
about all the sites that it was made in Central New Mexico as about all of the variations before
mentioned in several published reports may be found on these sites. They will possibly represent
the complete time span A.D. 1150 to 1400+ given for this type. Many of the sites south of U.S.
62-180 will have Chupadero Black-on-white but none of the before mentioned Black-on-white
types have been found or recorded from this far south. None of this type is thought to have been
made east of the Pecos River.
Chupadero Black-on-white at the site appeared within the earlier period as none were found in the
later if one considers the cache of 19 sherds found on the floor of Room 4 a collection from
earlier periods on the site or earlier sites in the area. As four room floors of this period was
excavated and the 19 sherd cache was all of this type found.

Figure 5.3 Chupadero Black-on-white Bowl, Interior design found as seven sherds and glued
together from Refuse Area C (Actual size).

Figure 5.4 Chupadero Black-on-white jar sherds, A and B possibly from the same vessel, C was
found as five sherds and glued together. All were found within Area C as designated in Room 1
(Actual Size).
The reason for this is not known but possibly for some unknown reason their source was cut off.
Or that the last period of occupation at the site was of a later date than that which Chupadero
Black-on-white was made.

GILA POLYCHROME
Thirty-five sherds are identified as this type in the collection. Twelve are bowl sherds of which
four are rims. Twenty-three are jar sherds, all are body sherds.

The interiors of the bowls are smoothed, slipped with a dirty white and decorated with a thin or
fugitive black paint. The rim sherds are slightly incurved, lips are rounded. The exteriors are
slipped with a thin red with the base color brown visible on some sherds. The paste has a lot of
sand and seems quite friable, does not resist weathering or wear. This is also present on the
exterior of the jar sherds.
Interiors of jars are smoothed but not polished. The color remains the same light brown as the
paste. Exteriors of all sherds are slipped with a bright red some have black decorations probably
from upper portions of vessels. Others have no black decorations and are probably from the lower
portions of vessels.
Gila Polychrome appeared ion all periods at the Merchant Site however only one sherd was
recovered from the latest period, Room 4 floor within the multiple room structure. This was the
only intrusive sherds other than the cache of Chupadero sherds also recovered from the floor of
Room 4 found on the room floors of the latest period of occupation on the site.
Gila Polychrome is recorded from the surface of a few sites in the Northern Eastern Jornada Area
but consisting of only one to six sherds. Ochoa Indented is also found on the surface of all of
these sites. Although still rare, it is to be found on most of the Ochoa Phase sites south of U.S.
62-180.
Gila Polychrome is intrusive to the Merchant Site directly or indirectly from Eastern Arizona or
southwestern New Mexico. Dates that have been given to this type are A.D. 1300 to 1400+.

RAMOS POLYCHROME
Twenty-three sherds of this type were recovered from the Merchant Site. All are from jars that
appeared to be of a medium size. Twenty-one are body sherds and two are rims. Two separate
vessels are represented in the two rims. Necks appear to be short, rims are everted and lips are
rounded. Interiors are smoothed, color is the same as the paste; a dirty white to cream. Exteriors
are polished, un-painted surfaces are a cream or tannish white. Decorations, of a thin black and
red paint are on 18 of the sherds, three have no paint.
Ramos Polychrome was absent on the room floors excavated within the latest surface rooms and
only one sherds was recovered from the fill above these rooms. Present information restricts it to
the earlier rooms and trash mounds.
It is recorded from only one site north of U.S. 62-180 (two sherds) and only five to the south.
Like Playas Incised is seems to be mostly earlier than the Ochoa Phase or within the PostMaljamar Pre-Ochoa Period.
Ramos Polychrome is intrusive to the Merchant Site directly or indirectly from Southwestern
New Mexico-Northern Chihuahua Mexico. It is dated to A.D. 1050 to 1350.

PLAYAS RED INCISED
Fifteen sherds are identified as this type. All are jar sherds of which three are rims. The three rim
and seven of the body sherds that appeared to be from the “neck” portion of vessel had short
incised lines. The other five had no incisions so apparently were from the lower part of the vessel.
Necks were short, mouths medium and rims were slightly flared. The exteriors are smoothed and
slipped over and into the incisions with a deep red. Interiors are well smoothed but not slipped.
Vessels are well fired and rather hard. A few small flakes of golden mica are visible on both
surfaces.
All of the sherds appear to be from one vessel although none fit together and seven came from the
lower floor of Room 1 and the other eight including the three rims came from next to the bottom
layer of trash in Refuse Area C designated as C-2. The artifacts types from both areas suggest that
both are possibly from the same time period of occupation.
This type is intrusive to the Merchant Site within the early period, directly or indirectly from
Southwestern New Mexico or Northern Chihuahua, Mexico. The sherd is dated from A.D. 1050
to 1350.
