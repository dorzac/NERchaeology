Aboriginal Ceramic Sherd Assemblage from the Harrell Site (41YN1) in the
Upper Brazos River Basin, Texas
Timothy K. Perttula
Introduction
The Harrell site (41YN1) is situated on the eastern flank of the Rolling Plains in the
Western Cross Timbers ecoregion of southern Young County (Figure 1), in the North Central
Texas archeological region. The site is approximately 15 km west of the Cross Timbers and an
equal distance east of the Broken Red Plains on the floodplain and alluvial terraces at the
confluence of the Salt and Clear Forks of the Brazos River. The Harrell site was excavated by the
Works Progress Administration (WPA) in 1938 and 1939 (Fox 1939; Hughes 1942; Krieger
1946:87-120).
One of the characteristic material culture remains recovered from the Harrell site in WPA
excavations were sherds from a number of plain (or minimally decorated) shell-tempered vessels.
Shell-tempered vessels were relatively abundant in archeological deposits of Late Prehistoric age
at the site, being associated with Harrell and Washita arrow points (see Krieger 1946:Figure 7a-h;
Duncan et al. 2007:55-56; Turner et al. 2011:196, 215). Such archeological associations in the
southern Plains are thought to date from ca. A.D. 1200-1500, but this is far from certain.
Uncalibrated radiocarbon dates from sites in southern and western Oklahoma with Harrell arrow
points range from A.D. 1050-1750, but are concentrated between A.D. 1080 and A.D. 1400;
IntCal13 calibrated age ranges for these dates fall between A.D. 1170 and A.D. 1425. There
presently are no radiocarbon dates from the Harrell site.
In this article, I first discuss the stylistic and technological character of the ceramic sherds
and other clay artifacts from the Harrell site, based on the recent reanalysis of the rehabilitated
WPA collection by sherd type, temper, surface treatment, firing conditions, sherd thickness, rim
and lip character, orifice diameter, and decorative elements (see Appendix 1); also of interest is the
distribution of refitted sherds in the assemblage. Information on the provenience of the sherds and
other clay artifacts in block excavations are then employed in conjunction with the sherd
assemblage data to more completely characterize the range of ceramic wares at the site, and then
compare them to other southern Plains ceramics in northern Texas and southern Oklahoma.
Archeological Context
The WPA excavations at the Harrell site were extensive, and included three excavation
blocks, two on a low alluvial terrace, and a third block on the higher terrace (Figure 2). The third
block—Excavation 3—is of particular concern because all of the ceramic sherds and other clay
artifacts from the site were found in this excavation.

Figure 2. Excavation areas 1-3 at the Harrell site.
The Excavation 3 block covered an area 135 x 85 feet (41 x 25.9 m) in size, divided into
476 5 x 5 ft. squares (Figure 3). All of the block was excavated to 5 ft. bs (1.52 m), while the
western half of the block was then excavated to 10 ft. (3.05 m) bs (Krieger 1946:Figure 3). As
artifacts were recovered, their depths were recorded by unit in inches, likely inches below the
surface rather than depths measured from a central datum (see Krieger 1946:92).
Krieger (1946:92 and Figure 4) recognized two principal occupational strata at the Harrell
site: an upper midden deposit (labeled stratum II) ca. 20-45 inches (ca. 51-114 cm) in thickness,
beginning at the surface (except where buried by Stratum III, a wind-blown sand, in certain parts
of the block excavations), and a lower deposit of sandy reddish clay (Stratum I). This stratum
extended to at least 10 ft. bs. According to analyses by Hughes (1942) and Krieger (1946:Tables 13), the ceramic sherds found at the site were basically confined to Stratum II (and between 0-5 ft.
bs). Krieger (1946:100) defined a Level 1 as the upper midden deposits, and a Level II as confined
to the sandy reddish clay, and determined (not including sherds of indeterminate provenience) that
90 percent of the recovered ceramic sherds (n=474) in his analysis occurred in Level 1 and the
remaining 10 percent (n=53) fell in Level II.
Although a large number of burned rock features and burial features were excavated at the
Harrell site (Krieger 1946:94-95), few contain any associated ceramic sherds (see Appendix 1). It
is likely the case that the vast majority of these features predate the ca. A.D. 1200-1500 Late
Prehistoric occupation at the site.
According to Krieger (1946:109-112 and Table 3), the Harrell site assemblage
included 597 pottery sherds from Excavation 3, almost all of which occurred in the upper
stratigraphic levels (Level I and stratum II) in excavations in the thick midden deposits. Most of
the ceramics were shell-tempered wares that he classified as Nocona Plain. Krieger (1946:110)
described Nocona Plain as a coiled pottery “abundantly tempered with crushed mussel shell…the
inner surface is always poorly smoothed…[t]he exterior is consistently more even and better
smoothed than the interior.” Sherds came primarily from jars, but deep bowls were also present
(Krieger 1946:Figure 5n-q). A small number of the Nocona Plain sherds had appliqued nodes,
fingernail punctations, incised lines, and tool punctations (see also Suhm and Jelks 1962:115 and
Plate 58)

The paste matrix of the remaining sherds included those that had no apparent temper that
were from a very thick ware, several sherds of which had a “thin red coating on the interior”
(Krieger 1946:111 and Plate 6g-h). Two sherds were considered “trade pieces”: one may have
been a sherd from a southeastern New Mexico ceramic ware and one was probably a post-ca. A.D.
1400 Poynor Engraved sherd from a vessel made by a Caddo group living in the upper Neches
River basin in East Texas (Krieger 1946:112).
Krieger (1946) noted the similarities between the sherds found at the Harrell site and whole
ceramic vessels found in graves in East Central Oklahoma and Northeast Texas. He argued that the
Harrell site was the southernmost expression of the Plains Village tradition and considered the site
to be the “type site” of the Henrietta focus, now thought to date to the period between ca. A.D.
1200-1500 and referred to in current taxonomies (if at all) either as the Henrietta phase or
complex.
The ceramics from the Harrell site were later reexamined by Brack (2000), who determined
that between 25 and 30 separate vessels were represented in the assemblage. He concluded that
most of the vessels were round-bottomed jars with restricted necks averaging 15 cm in diameter,
many of which flared out at the rims. At least four bowls were also represented in the collection.
The vast majority of the sherds (98 percent) were plain shell-tempered wares; however, a few
exhibited simple decorations, primarily rows of appliqued nodes. Other decorative techniques
appearing on the vessel body were vertical fingernail marks, incised diagonal lines, and stamped

impressions. Brack’s (2000) study of shell-tempered pottery from North Texas and Oklahoma led
him to conclude that the ceramic wares from the Harrell site closely resembled ceramics found at
Plains Village sites along the Red River and the Washita/Canadian River drainages in southern and
western Oklahoma.
Ceramic Sherd Assemblage
Detailed attribute data on each of the 578 sherds and two other clay artifacts (i.e., a figurine
fragment and a clay bead fragment) in the Harrell site ceramic assemblage are provided in
Appendix I. Approximately 86 percent of the sherds and the figurine and clay bead fragments
came from Excavation 3 (N=499), while the remainder are sherds with little to no provenience
and/or depth information: test pits (n=4), trenches (n=4), the Old Cellar (n=6), general surface
(n=8), and sherds with no provenience (n=57), that information having been lost over the years
since the collection was obtained.
In addition to information on provenience, depth (in inches), and specimen number, each
sherd in this analysis is categorized by sherd type (i.e., rim, body, and base), temper, surface
treatment, firing conditions, thickness, and decoration (plain or a specific decorative element).
Other data has been gathered on rim and lip form, rim orifice diameter, as well as base form (i.e.,
flat or rounded), and the presence of preserved organic residue on sherds (only a very few such
sherds have been noted in the assemblage). On the figurine and clay bead fragments, information
has been obtained on temper and firing conditions, along with data on their size and shape.
Although most of the sherds from the Harrell site had been separated into distinct vessels
(Vessel No. A-N) by Krieger (1946:109), each with between 6-62 sherds per vessel, I chose not to
employ these vessel sherd batches in the analysis of the ceramic sherd assemblage. I made this
decision based on the fact that the sherds comprising the different vessels recognized by Krieger
were characterized by considerable diversity in surface treatment, firing conditions, and thickness,
such that it appeared that the sherds in the vessel batches were not all from the same vessel.
Furthermore, almost all of the sherds in these vessel batches did not refit, and thus they did not
permit a confident assessment that the sherds from each vessel batch belonged together. During the
analysis of the sherds, I recorded the vessel letters for the sherds that had been separated into
distinct vessels by Krieger, and my analysis notes are on file at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory at The University of Texas at Austin.
The density of sherds in Excavation 3 is very low: a mean of 1.01 sherds per each 5 x 5 ft.
unit, and with a range of only 1-25 sherds in the 166 units in the block that have ceramic vessel
sherds (Figure 4). The mean spatial density of ceramic sherds in the units in Excavation 3 that have
sherds is only 3.0 sherds per 5 x 5 ft. unit.

Figure 4. The distribution of ceramic vessel sherds at the Harrell site.
Spatially, the sherds in Excavation 3 can be divided into Concentration A and
Concentration B in the central and northern versus southern parts of the block, respectively.
Concentration A covers a ca. 70 x 90 ft. area of the block, with the highest sherd densities—either
7-10 sherds per 5 x 5 ft. unit or 25 sherds in one 5 x 5 ft. unit (most likely from one vessel)—in
units Q11, H9, L10, N13, and P9 (Figure 5). Concentration B is much smaller in size, covering a
ca. 25 x 25 ft. area at the southern end of the block. The highest sherd densities are in only three
units (Z13, AA9, and AA10) that have between 7-10 sherds per 5 x 5 ft. unit.

By depth, the majority of the ceramic sherds recovered in the excavations are found from
6-25 inches in depth (ca. 15-63 cm bs) (Table 1). However, sherds of all three wares were found to
depths of at least 55 inches (ca. 141 cm bs).
In the case of the principal ceramic ware—shell-tempered vessels—more than 63 percent
of the shell-tempered sherds were found between 6-20 inches (ca. 15-51 cm bs) (see Table 1). But
the sherds from shell-tempered wares were recovered to depths of greater than 61 cm (ca. 153 cm
bs) in the archeological deposits. The shell-hematite-tempered sherds were recovered from the
same depths, as more than 65 percent were also from 6-20 inches below the surface. Conversely,
bone and non-tempered paint cup sherds in the assemblage, as well as other bone and nontempered sherds, were most commonly found between 21-35 inches (ca. 53-89 cm bs) (42.8
percent), with another 28.6 percent from deposits below 36 inches (ca. 91 cm bs) (see Table 1).
The one grog-tempered sherd in the assemblage came from 10 inches bs (ca. 25 cm).

Plotting the distribution of ceramic sherds found below 40 inches bs in Excavation 3
indicates that these deeper sherds are also spatially associated with Sherd Concentrations A and B
in the block (Figure 6), and do not have a distribution separate from the overall distribution of
sherds in the block. While it is possible that the sherds found at greater depths (i.e., below 36-40
inches) are from an earlier Late Prehistoric occupation than the sherds concentrated between 6-20
inches at the Harrell site, it is just as likely that they are the product of bioturbation and the
movement of sherds from upper to lower levels in the archeological deposits by aboriginal digging
and use of pit features and hearths. Pit features were apparently common in the midden deposits,
and extending into the lower reddish sandy clay (Krieger 1946:92). In any case, as the discussion
below indicates, there are no stylistic or technological differences between the sherds found in
either upper or lower archeological deposits at the site, and thus they appear to represent wares
from only one principal ceramic-bearing component.

Sherd Refits
The refitting of ceramic sherds in the Excavation 3 block indicates that almost all the sherd
fitters in the assemblage are found in Concentration A (Figure 7; see also Figure 5). Plotted by
depth, the principal zone of sherd refits is between 6-22 inches (ca. 15-56 cm bs) (Figure 8), with
only a few instances of refits between sherds in this zone and sherds from much deeper depths
(i.e., as deep as 75 inches bs). Taken together, the sherd refit data indicates that the principal
distribution of sherds in Excavation 3 is in Concentration A and occurs in relatively shallow depths
in Stratum II and Level 1.

Use of Temper
Ninety-one percent (n=527) of the ceramic sherds in the Harrell site assemblage are
tempered with crushed and burned mussel shell. Another 5.4 percent (n=31) are tempered with
mussel shell and crushed pieces of hematite; most of these sherds are likely from one vessel (i.e.,
Krieger’s Vessel C) because they are concentrated in only one unit in the larger Concentration A
the block (Figure 9). Thirteen sherds (2.2 percent) are from non-tempered paint cups (see below),
three other paint cup sherds have bone-temper (0.5 percent), and the remaining 0.9 percent of the
assemblage are from vessels with no temper or have bone temper. In total, 96.4 percent of the
ceramic vessel sherd assemblage is from shell-tempered vessels, including primarily jars, some
bowls, and a very few bottles.

Decorative Elements
Fifty-two sherds in the assemblage from the Harrell site have decorative elements: 40 are
from the shell-tempered ware (9.9 percent of the shell-tempered wares), two are from the shellhematite-tempered ware (6.4 percent), eight are from paint cups (53.3 percent), one is from a sherd
with no temper, and the one grog-tempered sherd has an engraved decorative element. These
include appliqued, brushed, brushed-incised, incised, incised-punctated, punctated, and red washed
decorative elements in the shell-tempered and shell-hematite-tempered wares, and incised,
incised/red washed, and red washed decorative elements on the paint cup sherds (Table 2); none of
the paint cup sherds in the assemblage have exterior corn cob-impressed decorations, which is the
most common exterior decoration on paint cups in southern and western Oklahoma Plains Village
sites (Brooks and Drass 2005:154-155).

with sets of diagonal incised lines on the rim and at least two rows of vertical fingernail punctates
on the vessel body (Figure 10a). The shell-tempered sherds with decorative elements include those
with appliqued nodes and ridges (n=9, 22.5 percent of the decorated shell-tempered sherds) at the
rim-body juncture (Figures 10b-c and 11a-b), brushing (n=9, 22.5 percent), brushed-incised (n=8,
20.0 percent), incised (n=3, 7.5 percent) (Figure 11d), tool punctated (n=6, 15.0 percent) (Figure
11e), and red washed on the interior vessel surface (n=5, 12.5 percent). These red washed sherds
are not from paint cups, but from relatively thin-walled bowls.

30 inches bs; c, Unit W9, 12 inches bs; d, Unit C3, 10 inches bs.
All of the appliqued sherds are from the Concentration A in the northern part of Excavation
3 (Figure 12), and most were found between 11-20 (ca. 28-51 cm bs) inches bs. Brushed and
brushed-incised sherds have a similar spatial distribution, with a notable concentration of brushedincised sherds (probably from one vessel) in Unit H9 (Figure 13). Sherds from brushed and
brushed-incised vessels are concentrated between 6-15 inches bs (ca. 15-38 cm bs). Sherds from
vessels with either incised, incised-punctated, or tool punctated decorative elements occur in
Concentration A (Figure 14), and are found primarily from 6-25 inches bs (ca. 15-63 cm bs).

The thin-walled sherds with an interior red wash are found only in Concentration B in the
southern part of Excavation 3 (Figure 15); it is notable that this is the same area where a number of
thick-walled paint cup sherds were found in the excavations (see below). Four of the five thinwalled sherds with an interior red wash were recovered between 31-45 inches bs (ca. 79-114 cm

bs), as were 60 percent of the decorated paint cup sherds with provenience information, suggesting
they may have come from pit features.

Figure 15. Distribution of thin-walled sherds with an interior red wash in Block 3 at the Harrell
site, as well as the location of the reported Poynor Engraved sherd.
Krieger (1946:112) reported a Poynor Engraved sherd in the collection from the Harrell
site, recovered in Unit C3 at 10 inches bs (ca. 25 cm). Krieger described it as an “orange-colored,
polished sherd with a branching, engraved line across one end.” The sherd has two parallel
engraved lines, with a third line branching off from one of the parallel lines (see Figure 10d).
Poynor Engraved is a fine ware made by Caddo potters in the Neches River basin in East Texas
after ca. A.D. 1400, consistent with the likely age of the Late Prehistoric component at the Harrell
site. The branching element suggests the sherd came from either a Poynor Engraved, var.
ARCHEOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE TEXAS PRAIRIE-SAVANNAH

20
Blackburn, var. Cook, or var. Lang vessel (Perttula 2011:Figure 6-64). These varieties of Poynor
Engraved in the upper Neches River basin occur most commonly between ca. A.D. 1400-1560
(Perttula 2011:Table 6-37).
Paint Cups
Certainly the most distinctive ceramic ware in the sherd assemblage from the Harrell site is
the paint cup (see Brooks and Drass 2005). These sherds, either with no apparent temper or
tempered with bone, are from thick hand-molded cylindrical vessels that were made to hold
pigment and paint. Brooks and Drass (2005:149) note that “with the low temperature firing, walls
of the paint cups are probably more permeable and pigment placed in the cups could potentially
soak into the pot’s interior surface. Most paint cup sherds studied by Brooks and Drass (2005:150151) have a corncob-impressed surface, but smooth surfaced paint cups and cups with cordimpressed exterior surfaces are also known. Interior surfaces of the paint cups have a red pigment
or wash.
The paint cup sherds from the site are found in three small clusters in Excavation 3 (Figure
16), two within the area of Concentration A and the third within the area of Concentration B (see
Figure 5). None of the 14 paint cup sherds from the Harrell site have a corncob-impressed surface.
Five of the paint cup sherds have an interior red wash, remnants of a paint stored in the cups (see
Table 2). One of the red washed sherds also has parallel incised lines on the exterior cup surface.
Other decorated paint cup sherds have parallel or straight incised lines, and one has an incisedpunctated element with incised lines interspersed with tool punctations.

The two paint cup rim sherds have a direct rim and a flat lip. A red wash is present on the
interior of both rims. The paint cup rims range in thickness from 14.0 mm to 14.4 mm, with a
mean thickness of 14.2 mm. The mean thickness of bone-tempered paint cup body sherds is 17.2
mm, while non-tempered paint cup sherds have a mean thickness of 15.65 mm. The one flat paint

cup base sherd is 14.9 mm thick. None of the paint cup sherds have any form of interior or exterior
surface treatment. More than 73 percent of the paint cup sherds are from cups fired and cooled in
an oxidizing environment, 13.3 percent are from vessels fired in a reducing environment and
cooled in the open air, another 6.7 percent are from a vessel that was incompletely oxidized during
firing, and the last sherd is from a vessel fired in an oxidizing environment but then sooted or
smudged on the exterior surface, probably during firing (cf. Krause 2016). The differing firing
conditions in the paint cup sherds from the Harrell site suggest that at least three paint cups had
been broken and discarded in the area of the Excavation 3 block by the aboriginal inhabitants. In
general, paint cups appear to have been poorly fired for a short period at low temperatures (Brooks
and Drass 2005:149).
Paint cup sherds have been reported in two Plains Village sites in North Central Texas—
including the Harrell site—as well as a number of Plains Village sites in southern and western
Oklahoma (Figure 17). The other North Central Texas site with paint cup sherds is the Glass site
on the Red River in Montague County (Lorrain 1967:199; see Prikryl and Perttula 1995), although
Krieger (1946:111) noted that he had seen a few other such sherds in the collections made by a Mr.
Powell Goodwin in the same general area (Archer and Young counties) as the Harrell site, but he
noted they were rare. Krieger (1946:132) also saw “two thick, yellowish bowl-rim sherds, finger
molded rather than coiled and quite like those from the Harrell site” in collections from sites in the
Little Wichita River basin in Clay County, Texas. These sites are thought to date between ca. A.D.
1250-1500 (Drass 1998).

The ceramic sherd assemblage includes 42 rim sherds, 520 body sherds, and 16 base sherds
(Table 3). Rim sherds and base sherds are confined to the shell-tempered ware and the non-

In addition to the two direct and flat rims from paint cups in the sherd assemblage, there are
40 rim sherds from shell-tempered vessels. Where rim profile could be accurately determined, 57.5
percent (n=23) have everted rims and rounded lips, and are likely from jars. Six rims (15.0 percent)
have direct profiles and rounded lips, and one of these rims (with an appliqued decorative element)
had a rounded and exterior flattened lip. These rims may be from bowls. On the other rims, only
the lip form could be determined: rounded (n=10) and flat, with an expanded lip (n=1). One
everted rim has lip tabs, and two of the rims have loop handles (see Figure 11f); a lower rim and
body sherd with appliqued nodes also had evidence of a handle attachment (see Figure 10c). The
loop handles range from 16-26 mm in length and 11-15 mm in width. The one rim sherd with a
loop handle that has provenience data is from Unit AA, 53 inches in depth, in Concentration B in
the Excavation 3 block.
Rim sherds range from 3.4-9.7 mm in thickness, with a mean thickness of 6.78 mm. Fifty
percent of the rim sherds fall between 6.1-8.0 mm, but several others (19 percent) have notably
thicker vessel walls (8.1-10.0 mm), and are likely from larger vessels. About 12 percent of the rims
have thin walls (3.1-5.0 mm), and these rim sherds are likely from bowls.
Orifice diameters of the rims ranged from at least 7.0 cm to as great as 25.0 cm, suggesting
that small to medium-sized vessels were made and used at the Harrell site. These fall into clusters
ranging from at least 7-8 cm in orifice diameter, at least 10-12 cm, at least 14-15 cm, 17 cm and 19
cm, and 24-25 cm.
Body sherds from shell-tempered vessels have a considerable range in thickness, from 2.9
to 12.0 mm. More than 70 percent range in thickness from 4.1-8.0 mm (Figure 18), and another 11
are between 8.1-9.0 mm. The highest proportion of sherds fall between 6.1-7.0 mm in vessel wall
thickness.

Figure 18. Thickness of shell-tempered and shell-hematite-tempered body sherds in the
assemblage from the Harrell site.
Based on the different kinds of decorated body sherds in the shell-tempered wares, those
with body wall thicknesses greater than 6.0 mm are from jars. These have incised, appliqued,
punctated, brushed, and brushed-incised decorations on the vessel bodies. A number of the
brushed-incised sherds (n=6) are from large and thick jars, with vessel wall thicknesses that range
from 8.1-12.0 mm. Conversely, body sherds from vessels with an interior red wash range in vessel
wall thickness of 3.9-6.0 mm, with 60 percent falling between 4.1-5.0 mm. These distinctive red
washed sherds are likely from thin-walled bowls or cups. Other thin-walled vessels in the

assemblage have tool punctated, incised-fingernail punctated, appliqued, brushed, and incised
decorative elements.
The shell-hematite-tempered body sherds with a measurable thickness (n=28) have a mean
thickness of 5.84 mm. About 70 percent of the body sherds from this ware have vessel wall
thicknesses that range from 5.1-7.0 mm; the proportion of shell-tempered sherds that fall in this
range comprise only 42 percent of the measurable body sherds.
Where it could be determined, the base sherds (including a few body-base sherds) from the
shell-tempered wares are either rounded (n=6) or flat (n=2). They range in thickness from 8.1-16.0
mm, with a mean thickness of 11.1 mm.
While the vast majority of the shell-tempered sherds from the Harrell site are from jars or
bowls, three sherds (less than 1 percent) are from bottles. These sherds have the characteristic
unsmoothed and scraped interior surface seen on bottles. These bottle sherds are found in
Concentration A in Units L5, Q6, and Q12, at depths of 12 inches bs (ca. 30 cm), 14 inches bs (ca.
36 cm), and 42 inches bs (ca. 107 cm).
Surface Treatment
None of the non-tempered and bone-tempered paint cup sherds or the few other nontempered or bone-tempered body sherds have any form of surface treatment (i.e., smoothing or
burnishing) on interior or exterior vessel surfaces. The one grog-tempered body sherd has been
smoothed on both interior and exterior surfaces. About 12.9 percent (n=4) of the shell-hematitetempered sherds are from vessels that have been smoothed only on their exterior surface. Among
the shell-tempered sherds, 0.2 percent (n=1) of the sherds are burnished on the interior surface, and
another 0.2 percent (n=1) are burnished on the exterior surface. These sherds are likely from
bowls. Approximately 4.9 percent (n=26) of the shell-tempered sherds have been smoothed on the
interior vessel surface, and 27.7 percent (n=146) have a smoothed exterior surface.
Firing Conditions
Sherd cross-sections were examined to determine the conditions under which the vessel
from which the sherd came was fired. This cross-section includes the firing core as well as the
oxidation (i.e., high oxygen) or reduction (i.e., low oxygen) that occurred during the firing and as
the vessel cools (Teltser 1993:Figure 2; Perttula 2005:Figure 5-30). The analysis is based on the
categorization of sherd cross-sections, where A on Figure 19 indicates the sherd came from a
vessel oxidized during firing. Cross-sections C-E represent sherds that came from vessels that were
incompletely oxidized during firing. Cross-section B represents a vessel that was fired and cooled
in a reducing environment, while cross-sections F-H are from sherds that came from vessels that
were fired in a reducing environment but cooled in the open air. Lastly, cross-sections I-L
represent the firing conditions on sherds that came from vessels that were smudged, sooted, or
refired.

Figure 19. Firing conditions chart (after Teltser 1993; Perttula 2005).
The three main ceramic wares at the Harrell site were fired in different ways. The different
firing conditions likely are a product of the kinds of vessels that were being fired and their
intended uses.
Almost 89 percent of the shell-tempered sherds are from vessels fired in a reducing or low
oxygen environment, about half of these vessels then being cooled in the open air (i.e., firing
conditions F-H) (Table 4). About 5 percent of the sherds are from vessels that have been sooted or
smudged. More than half of the shell-hematite-tempered sherds are from vessels incompletely
oxidized during firing, and virtually the remainder are from vessels fired in a reducing
environment and then cooled in the open air; one sherd is from a vessel fired and cooled in an
oxidizing environment. Approximately 33 percent of these sherds also have evidence of sooting or
smudging, mainly on vessels that were incompletely oxidized during firing. The frequency of
exterior sooting (i.e., Firing condition L) suggests the vessels used at the Harrell site had been fired
mouth down in an open fire (see Krause 2016:59).

More than 73 percent of the paint cup sherds are from cups fired and cooled in an oxidizing
environment, and another 6.7 percent of the sherds are from a vessel incompletely oxidized during
firing (see Table 4). Lastly, the relatively thin-walled sherds from non-tempered or bone-tempered
vessels were uniformly fired in either an oxidizing or a reducing environment (see Table 4).
Figurine and Clay Bead Fragments
The figurine and clay bead fragments in the assemblage were both recovered in
Concentration A (Figure 20). The one figurine fragment is from Unit L11, 10 inches bs (ca. 25
cm). The rectangular and flat-based fragment is not tempered or smoothed, but has a distinct
flattened surface at the top of the fragment, and two depressions on the interior surface (Figure
21a-a’). It is 29.1 mm in length, 22.9 mm in width, and 13.2 mm thick.

The clay bead fragment was recovered in Unit S10 at 22 inches bs (ca. 56 cm). The
fragment is not tempered, and has roughened interior and exterior surfaces, with a prominent drill
hole that runs from the top to the bottom of the rounded bead surfaces (see Figure 21b-b’). The
drill hole ranges from 7.0-12.0 mm in diameter, narrowing from one surface to the other. The
height of the bead is 24.2 mm and it is 35.9 mm in width.
Regional Comparisons
Plain shell-tempered ceramic wares are a notable feature in ceramic assemblages in the
Red, Brazos, and Trinity River basins in North Central Texas, like they are at the Harrell site in the
upper Brazos River basin, and in aboriginal settlements in southern and western Oklahoma in Late
Prehistoric or Plains Village contexts dating after ca. A.D. 1200-1300 (Drass 1997, 1998; Ellis et
al. 2015). Shell-tempered ceramics continued to be made and used in parts of North Central Texas
into the 18th century, particularly along the Red River in the Spanish Fort area. That more than 96
percent of the ceramics from the Harrell site are from shell-tempered vessels suggests that the
aboriginal occupation there postdates A.D. 1300, based in part on the very considerable increase in
the proportions of shell-tempered vessels in post-A.D. 1300 sites in Plains Village sites in southern
and western Oklahoma (Drass 1997:87) and in Late Prehistoric sites in the upper Trinity River
basin (Ellis et al. 2015:172) and the upper Red River basin (Martin 1994).
In proximity to the Harrell site is the O. W. Hill site (41YN2), also in the upper Brazos
River basin. The small ceramic sherd assemblage there had shell tempered sherds (n=5), along
with thinner sherds (3.6-4.8 mm) of an unknown temper; thin shell-tempered sherds are present at
the Harrell site, although they are not common (see Figure 18). One rim had an everted profile, and

ARCHEOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE TEXAS PRAIRIE-SAVANNAH

30
such rims were common at the Harrell site, and other sherds were decorated with punctations or
shallow parallel incised lines (Ellis et al. 2015:178). Incised and punctated sherds comprise about
18 percent of the decorated sherds from the Harrell site (see Table 2). The commonalities between
the Harrell and the O. W. Hill sites suggest both were contemporaneously occupied during the Late
Prehistoric period, sometime after ca. A.D. 1200-1300. Plain shell-tempered sherds identified as
Nocona Plain have also been recovered, but in very low numbers, during the archeological survey
of South Bend Reservoir on the Brazos and Brazos Clear Fork rivers (Ellis et al. 2015:Table 5).
Ceramic bearing sites in the Little Wichita River in the upper Red River basin also have
plain shell-tempered pottery from globular jars with rounded or flat bases, handless and lugs, as
well as paint cup sherds (Krieger 1946:132). Some vessel sherds were decorated with cord marks
as well as appliqued nodes below the rim or an exterior appliqued strip; no cord-marked sherds
were present in the decorated sherd assemblage from the Harrell site. There are also shell-tempered
sherds with cord-marked decorations from sites on the Red and Pease rivers; cord-marked pottery
is a distinctive feature of ceramic vessels on post-A.D. 1250 Plains Village sites in southern and
western Oklahoma (Drass 1997, 1998).
Plains Village sites in Cooke and Montague counties in the upper Red River basin have
plain, smoothed, shell-tempered pottery, primarily flowerpot-shaped jars and bowls with flat bases
(Lorrain 1967, 1969; Prikryl and Perttula 1995:191). Decorative elements are limited to appliqued
collars fingernail punctations, and appliqued nodes on the rim (Ellis et al. 2015:163). The Glass
site in Montague County also had several paint cup sherds from non-tempered, thick, and handmolded vessels (Lorrain 1967:44).
Ceramic vessel sherds from the 13th century A.D. Haley’s Point site (34Ma15) on the Red
River at the upper end of Lake Texoma are almost exclusively shell-tempered, but a considerable
proportion also have crushed limestone and/or burned bone added to the paste (Brack 2000:129).
The use of limestone and burned bone as tempers added to the paste along with burned mussel
shell led Rohn (1998:129) to refer to this pottery as Woodward Plain, var. Haley’s Point rather
than Nocona Plain. Other differences between this pottery and the Nocona Plain ceramics from
sites in North Central Texas include vessel forms (deep bowls and barrel-shaped jars rather than
globular jars), rim profiles (direct rims rather than everted), and base form (a flat disk rather than a
combination of rounded and flat disk bases) in the Harrell site ceramics. The shell-tempered
ceramics from the Haley’s Point site are minimally decorated: appliqued bands or collars on the
rim and smoothed into the lip (Rohn 1998:Figure 45, 47-48; Brack 2000:Figure 17). No such
appliqued bands or collars were identified in the Harrell site ceramic assemblage, but they are
present on Nocona Plain ceramics from other North Central Texas sites (see Krieger 1946:132).
Brack (2000:215) has suggested that “Nocona Plain and Woodward Plain probably
represent closely related geographic varieties within a single type, rather than two exclusive
types.” Based on this conclusion, and the possibility of temporal changes between Plains Village
and Late Prehistoric sites in the region, Ellis et al. (2015:162) have proposed temporal changes in
vessel form and rim treatment as well as the use of rare decorative treatments (i.e., appliqued
nodes, appliqued ridges, lip tabs, and trailed, brushed, incised, punctated, and impressed lines and
rows) between ca. A.D. 1200-1300 to post-A.D. 1300 “jars in Henrietta and Washita phase Plains
Village sites that have globular bodies, everted rims, and both round and flat bases.”
Summary and Conclusions

ARCHEOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE TEXAS PRAIRIE-SAVANNAH

31
The 1938-1939 WPA excavations at the Harrell site (41YN1) on the Brazos River in the
upper Brazos River basin in North Central Texas recovered a substantial but low density aboriginal
ceramic vessel sherd assemblage (n=578 sherds) from archeological deposits in Excavation 3 that
likely date between ca. A.D. 1300-1500; also present are figurine and clay bead fragments.
However, there are no radiocarbon dates from the site, and the estimated age of the ceramicbearing component is based primarily on the very high proportion (96 percent) of shell-tempered
sherds in the assemblage and very high shell temper proportions in related post-A.D. 1300 Plains
Village sites in southern and western Oklahoma. Krieger (1946) identified the shell-tempered
sherds as Nocona Plain, a widely distributed ceramic type in the Trinity, Red, and Brazos river
basins in North Central Texas and parts of Oklahoma. One possible Poynor Engraved sherd from
the Excavation 3 block indicate that the occupation lasted until after ca. A.D. 1400, based on the
established age of this ceramic type in Caddo sites in the upper Neches River basin in East Texas.
The sherds are mainly from 6-22 inches bs (ca. 15-56 cm bs) in Stratum II, and two
different concentrations (A and B) are identified in the Excavation 3 block; sherd refits are also
prevalent between 6-22 inches. Sherds recovered from below 40 inches (ca. 102 cm bs) also occur
in these same spatial concentrations; whether they represent an earlier component or simply sherds
moved and bioturbated from the aboriginal excavation of pit features is not known at present.
Radiocarbon dates on animal bones from different depths in the archeological deposits would be
useful in unraveling the stratigraphic context and archeological components of the sherds at the
Harrell site.
The reanalysis of the ceramic wares at the Harrell site reported on in this article include
shell-tempered, shell-hematite-tempered, thick (14-19 mm) non-tempered or bone-tempered paint
cups, and other non-tempered or bone-tempered sherds not from paint cups. Most of these sherds
are from plain vessels, but 42 (7.5 percent) shell or shell-hematite-tempered sherds have
decorations, as do eight (53.3 percent) paint cup sherds. The shell-tempered and shell-hematitetempered vessel sherds have appliqued, brushed, brushed-incised, incised, punctated, incisedpunctated, and red washed decorative elements; the latter are from thin-walled bowls, and not from
paint cups. The paint cup sherds also have a red wash on their interior surface, extending up to the
lip, and haphazard incised and incised-punctated elements on the exterior surface; none are
corncob-impressed, the main style of paint cups in Plains Village sites in the southern Plains. The
paint cup sherds from the Harrell site are the southernmost occurrence of this distinctive vessel in
North Central Texas and southern and western Oklahoma, and suggests a close association
between the Harrell site aboriginal occupants and Plains Village settlements on the Red River in
North Central Texas and Washita phase settlements in southern and western Oklahoma (see
Brooks and Drass 2005).
The shell-tempered wares at the Harrell site are from jars, bowls, and a very few bottles.
The jars have moderately thick walls (generally between 6.1-8.0 mm in thickness), with everted
rims, and rounded and flat bases. Bowls have direct rims. Orifice diameters on these vessels range
from at least 7 cm to 25 cm. About 28 percent of the exterior surface of these vessel sherds had
been smoothed; 13 percent of the shell-hematite-tempered sherds have smoothing on their exterior
surface. The shell-tempered wares were fired almost exclusively in a low oxygen or reducing
environment, while the shell-hematite-tempered sherds were most commonly from vessels that
were incompletely oxidized during firing. Paint cup sherds were fired primarily in an oxidizing or
high oxygen environment.
The Harrell site ceramic vessel sherds comprise a distinctive but far from homogenous
aboriginal assemblage in the upper Brazos River basin in the Rolling Plains of North Central

Texas. The detailed analysis of sherd type, rim, lip, and base form, temper, surface treatment,
firing conditions, and decorative elements has in fact recognized three separate ceramic wares—
shell-tempered, shell-hematite-tempered, and non-tempered and bone-tempered paint cups—with
their own characteristic ways in which vessels were shaped, tempered, smoothed, decorated, and
fired, not just Nocona Plain vessel sherds. Of the three wares, 91 percent are tempered with shell
and are from everted rim and globular jars, bowls, and bottles, a few sherds of which were
decorated with wet paste elements on their rim and/or bodies, or had an interior red wash. The
shell-hematite-tempered sherds comprise only 5 percent of the assemblage, and most of these may
be from a single vessel based on their spatial distribution. The paint cup sherds account for 2.6
percent of the ceramic vessel assemblage, and may be from three different paint cups. The paint
cup sherds at the Harrell site are the best available clue to the cultural and social relationships of
the Harrell site aboriginal occupants and contemporaneous Plains Village settlements on the Red
River in North Central Texas and southern and western Oklahoma and settlements in the Washita
and Canadian rivers in southern and western Oklahoma (see Drass 2008:Figure 1).
