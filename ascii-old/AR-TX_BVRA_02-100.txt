ABSTRACT
Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) conducted a cultural resources
survey of a three acre tract in the city limits of Navasota, Texas in April of 2002 under
Texas Antiquities Permit Number 2832. This work was performed under the supervision
of William E. Moore and Roger G. Moore and was sponsored by the City of Navasota.
Two historic standing structures are present in the project area. They are a Band Hall
(41GM407) and a Bath House and Pool (41GM408). These buildings are part of a
greater historic landscape created in the 1930s by the Works Progress Administration.
The Band Hall (41GM407) is eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic
Places. Therefore, any planned modifications to this structure must follow the
recommendations of the Texas Historical Commission, History Programs Division. The
Bath House and Pool (41GM408) is not eligible for listing on the National Register of
Historic Places. It is recommended that modifications to this structure be allowed to
proceed as planned.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Navasota intends to remodel two buildings on a three acre tract of
land that overlooks Cedar Creek in the approximate center of town in order to have a
local recreation center (Figure 1). The two standing structures on the property were
both constructed by New Deal work projects started by the Franklin D. Roosevelt
administration in the 1930s.
The two buildings are identified in this report as the Band Hall at 200 Brule Street
(41GM407) and the Bath House at 302 Brule Street (41GM408). Appendix I contains
photographs of the Band Hall, and Appendix II contains photographs of the Bath House.
Adjacent to the Bath House is a swimming pool that is in use during the summer
months. Renovations are planned for both buildings. The Band Hall will be completely
redone with changes made to the interior and exterior. On the outside, stucco will be
added to the rough stone above the sill area. It is believed that this was the intent of the
original builders; however, it was never carried out. Figure 7 in Appendix I depicts a
close-up of the front elevation of the Band Hall showing the finished rock below the
windowsill and the scored rock above the windowsill. On the inside, 7288 square feet
will be affected by the planned improvements. Only the second floor of the Bath House
will be renovated (2894 square feet). This area was altered when the original roof was
removed and the second floor added in the 1960s. The stairs on the outside are not
original and considered to be unsafe. They will be replaced, and a wheel chair lift will
be added. Additional improvements include a courtyard, eighteen parking spaces,
program signs, landscaping, irrigation, and area lighting (City of Navasota 2001:4-5).
Figure 2 depicts the areas of proposed new construction outside the buildings. The
area to be examined is located on a hill overlooking Cedar Creek between 30 and 60
meters to the northwest.
Grimes County is an area that contains significant archaeological sites, both
prehistoric and historic. This area has been the subject of several major cultural
resources investigations such as the Millican Project, Navasota River Basin in Grimes
and four other counties. Because of the archaeological potential of the project area, a
cultural resources survey and clearance from the Texas Historical Commission was
requested by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department in a letter from Tim Hogsett,
CPRP to the Honorable Mayor Patricia M. Gruner of Navasota dated March 15, 2002.
In order to comply with this request, the City of Navasota contracted with Brazos Valley
Research Associates (BVRA) to conduct the cultural resources survey. The project
number for the recreation center is 51-00041, and the BVRA project number is 02-06.
Topographic coverage of the project area is provided by the Navasota 7.5'
topographic quadrangle dated 1958 and photorevised 1989 (Figure 3).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
The vast majority of cultural resource work in Grimes County was undertaken in
rural areas where historic sites found usually consist of isolated houses, farmsteads,
and associated features. One exception is the work at Fanthorp Inn (41GM79) in
Anderson, an early 19th century residence, Inn, and Stagecoach stop by the Texas
Parks and Wildlife Department in 1982 (Ing and Hart 1987). Previous archaeological
work in the county is discussed in several reports by various contractors. The most
notable project undertaken in Grimes County (and the first major archaeological
investigation in the area) was the Millican Project, Navasota River Basin in Brazos,
Grimes, Leon, Madison, and Robertson counties (Sorrow and Cox 1973). The majority
of work was centered on Brazos and Grimes counties. Later work in the area was
carried out by Prewitt (1974), Prewitt and Dibble (1974), and Kotter (1982). To the north
of the current project area lies the Texas Municipal Power Agency (TMPA), Gibbons
Creek Mine Areas. These areas have been intensively examined by archaeologists
beginning in the 1970s and lasting through at least 1994. Numerous archaeological
sites (prehistoric and historic) were recorded, and a significant number were tested. A
review of the archaeological literature revealed several significant investigations
conducted on TMPA property.
In 1976, the first archaeological survey on Texas Municipal Power Agency
(TMPA) property was conducted. This examination, performed by Texas A&M
University (Bond 1977) looked at three tracts of land and recorded sites to the north
(north of Highway 30) south, and east of the current project area. Shovel testing was
not conducted and the authors cite the heavy vegetation as a hindrance to their survey.
The nearest sites to the current project area are 41GM50 and 41GM51. Both of these
sites contained a paucity of artifacts, and further work was not recommended. An
archaeological bibliography of reports documenting work at TMPA is provided as
Appendix III to this report.
Other smaller cultural resource studies have been carried out in the county, but
not one examined as much territory or examined as many sites as the Millican River
Basin endeavor. The interested reader is referred to the three reports mentioned above
for detailed information concerning this project. Additional reports regarding the
prehistory and history of Grimes County can be found in the libraries at TARL and the
Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division.

FIELD METHODS
Fieldwork was conducted on April 10, 2002 by William E. Moore (Principal
Investigator), Roger G. Moore (Project Archaeologist), and Lili Lyddon (Photographer).
The area examined consists of a three acre tract overlooking Cedar Creek to the
northwest. On this tract are two historic buildings constructed by New Deal work
projects in the 1930s, and they were the focus of this investigation. Five shovel tests
were manually excavated in those areas believed to contain undisturbed or minimally
disturbed soils. In the field it was noted that the landscape varied between apparently
undisturbed soils and areas that had been artificially altered by excavation or other
forms of soil removal. Since one of the New Deal era rock walls is located on a lower
area beneath the Bath House, it became obvious that the excavation of soils in this area
had been done at or prior to the 1930s. The excavated areas are depicted on the
Project Area map (Figure 2). The location of the five tests is depicted in Figure 2, and
other shovel test data are presented in Appendix IV. The project area is situated on an
elevated landform above the floodplain of Cedar Creek, and it was difficult to ascertain if
the buildings and pool were constructed on fill or on undisturbed soils. The shovel tests
were excavated to help solve this mystery and to recover artifacts that may be the
remains of earlier sites, prehistoric or historic, that may be present. All excavated earth
was passed through 1/4 inch hardware cloth. It should be noted that shovel test
locations were selected for their lack of imported materials and surface obstructions
such as dense road metal deposits (here, gravel) and asphalt. This was especially true
for the area in front of the Band Hall (41GM407). Artifacts recovered were examined in
the field. Shovel tests 1 and 5 were dug between the Band Hall and Bath House in an
area that is believed to represent the natural ground surface (Figure 2), although Shovel
Test 5 was dug through a very fine sand that appears to be fill over the original surface.
Tests 2-4 were dug in front of the Band Hall in an area that has been shallowly
excavated (approximately 30 cm) sometime in the past (Figure 2).
Since not one of the artifacts found during shovel testing possesses historical,
cultural, or scientific value they were discarded (see Results and Conclusions below). A
digital camera was used to take elevation photographs of the two buildings. Finally, the
Principal Investigator and Project Archaeologist met with local informants who provided
information about the structures and information regarding the governmental agencies
responsible for their construction. The Band Hall and Bath House and Pool were
assigned the temporary numbers TS-1 and TS-2 and recorded at TARL as sites
41GM407 and 41GM408 respectively.
A major part of this project was the archival research conducted in the City of
Navasota. At the High School, sources reviewed include the school newspaper, The
LaSalle; the High School Yearbook, The Rattler; Grimes County histories, The
Navasota Bluebonnet (Grimes County Chamber of Commerce 1954); Heritage and
Progress: History of Grimes County (Grimes County Historical Commission 1982); and
Reflections of Grimes County, Texas 1994 (Whitten 1994). This aspect of the project
was made possible by the cooperation of local residents and agencies (see
Acknowledgments above).

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
A check of the site files and topographic maps at TARL revealed no previously
recorded sites in the project area. This investigation covered a three acre tract. No
additional sites were found through shovel testing. Two historic structures are present
in the project area. These are the Band Hall located at 200 Brule Street (41GM407),
and the Bath House and Pool located at 302 Brule Street (41GM408).
As stated above, the two historic buildings in the project area are part of a
greater New Deal era public works landscape created in the 1930s when they and other
architectural features were constructed. In addition to sites 41GM407 and 41GM408,
pubic works projects were responsible for the construction of the football stadium
(1934), the gymnasium (1934), a small out building (currently a pump house) that was
located at the site of the rock crusher for construction of the buildings and other features
and several rock walls associated with these facilities. Also, three bridges crossing
Cedar Creek and associated stone walls were likewise constructed; however, it is not
known at this time if they were part of the High School campus project. According to a
plaque on the High School, this building was constructed in 1930 prior to the New Deal
sponsored projects. The City Manager at that time was Robert Joe Brule. At one time
Cedar Creek flowed through the area where the football stadium is now located. It is
believed that one of the local New Deal projects was to channelize and straighten the
creek. According to the high school newspaper, The LaSalle (XIII, Number 11, Page 1,
March 30, 1934), the Civil Works Administration (CWA), is given credit for constructing
the football stadium and early work on the gymnasium that was completed by the Works
Progress Administration (WPA).
The CWA was a short-lived agency that was in existence from November 8, 1933
to April 1934. The Works Progress Administration (WPA) that officially began on May 6,
1935 replaced it. The WPA changed its name to the Work Projects Administration on
July 1, 1939. The Public Works Administration (PWA), established in 1933, continued
until 1940.
Band Hall (41GM407)
A bond issue of $10,000 was passed in 1935 for the purpose of constructing a
new school building (Grimes County Historical Commission 1982:150). The Band Hall
was designed by Robert Joe Brule and constructed from native rock obtained near
Anderson. The WPA provided Labor, and construction took 10 months, utilizing a work
force of some 30 local men. School Superintendent J. L. Southerland applied for and
received affiliation (equivalent to today's accreditation) after completion of the building.

According to Charles Allphin (Class of 1949), the Band Hall was built as part of a
government program called the National Youth Administration (NYA), and the building
was known as the "NYA Building" for many years by students and faculty. This federal
agency was established in 1935 within the Works Progress Administration. Its purpose
at first was obtaining part-time work for unemployed youths. As war approached, its
emphasis was shifted to training youths for work. Its activities ceased in 1943. The role
of this agency as it related to this building is not known at this time. During the 1940s
there was no floor, and it was used as a storage area for paper drives during the War.
According to Muriel Moody Bingham (Class of 1945), band students were in
another building at that time. Based on a photograph in the Grimes County History
(Grimes County Historical Commission 1982:155), the band is depicted in back of the
south end of the Band Hall in 1949, and the assumption is made that this structure
housed the band at that time. According to a photograph in the high school annual, The
Rattler (Rattler Annual Staff 1950-1951), the north end of the Band Hall was used as an
agricultural classroom. This picture shows the rock wall on the inside, evidence that the
inside has been remodeled since that time. Additional evidence of change to this
building is found in a photograph in the 1951 Rattler that shows the original door on the
southeast. Figure 6 in Appendix I depicts the modern entrance.
Bath House and Pool (41GM408)
In 1935, work resumed on the swimming pool [and Bath House?] by the WPA,
according to high school newspaper, The LaSalle, Volume XV, Number 5, Page 1,
December 11, 1935. Earlier (last year) work had been carried out under another federal
agency, the Public Works Administration (PWA). According to this article, City Manager
Robert Joe Brule stated that "swimming pool would be completed in 4 months" or early
1936. The PWA was established as part of the New Deal in 1933 in an effort to
promote and stabilize employment and purchasing power. It administered the
construction of various public works such as public buildings, bridges, dams, and
housing developments.
Shovel Testing
Shovel testing did not identify the presence of additional sites; however, seven
artifacts which were determined in the field to lack historical, cultural, or scientific value
were recovered. They consist of a small whiteware fragment with no maker's mark, a
green bottle glass fragment, a clear glass fragment (unidentified), a frosted glass
fragment, a high-fired brick fragment, a piece of metal wire, and an unidentifiable metal
fragment. These objects represent discarded trash and are probably not associated
with either of the historic structures.

The shovel tests also revealed a varied landscape that appears to contain fill in
certain areas over undisturbed soils. The five tests were excavated to a depth greater
than 12 inches, the limit of subsurface disturbance according to David R. Pippin,
Director of Parks and Recreation in a personal communication to William E. Moore on
April 9, 2002.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The Band Hall (41GM407) is eligible for listing on the National Register of
Historic Places. It is recommended that any modifications to this structure by the City of
Navasota strictly adhere to the guidelines as set forth by the Texas Historical
Commission, History Programs Division. The Bath House (41GB408) is not eligible for
listing on the National Register of Historic Places. It is recommended that modifications
to this structure by the City of Navasota be allowed to proceed as planned.
