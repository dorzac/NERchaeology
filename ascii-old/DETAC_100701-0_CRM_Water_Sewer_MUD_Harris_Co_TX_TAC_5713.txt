Cultural Resource Management
Phase I Intensive Archaeological Resources Survey
For the proposed Water, Sewer & Drainage Improvements,
Harris County Municipal Utility District (MUD) No. 383 for
RH of Texas Limited Partnership, Northlake at Gleanloch Development
On a 33.03-acre± tract of land, Tomball, Harris County, Texas
Texas Antiquities Code Permit No. 5713
CRC, LLC Project No. 100701.0
Introduction and Management Summary
In July 2010, RH of Texas Limited Partnership, Houston, Texas contracted with CRC, LLC,
International Archaeology & Ecology, LLC (CRC, LLC) to conduct a Phase I intensive cultural
resource investigation for the archaeological Area of Potential Effects (APE) above referenced
(Figures 1-2 and Table 1).
This investigation included a file search at the Texas Historical Commission (THC) Archeological
Sites Atlas in Austin, Texas, and background archival, literature, and record review of the general
project area. Our research indicated that there is one pre-recorded archaeological site (41HR958)
located approximately one-km north-northeast of the APE.
The results of any other archaeological projects that have been accomplished in the general area
were used in conducting the current investigation. Further, this research indicates the absence of
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) listed properties, State Landmarks, or previous
archaeological surveys within this APE.
Seventeen auger test excavations and 26 pedestrian surface examination transects were completed.
All auger tests and transects were negative. It is CRC, LLC’s conclusion and recommendation that
no further archaeological investigations be required for this proposed project by the RH of Texas
Limited Partnership, Northlake at Gleanloch Development, Tomball, Harris County, Texas.
Professional Compliance Standards
This proposed survey was conducted in compliance with 36 CFR 800 and the State Historical
Preservation Officer (SHPO) standards for cultural resource investigations. Reporting was
completed in accordance with recommendations of the SHPO. All contracted services were
conducted in a manner consistent with the level of care and skill ordinarily exercised by members of
the Register of Professional Archeologists.

Research Design and Proposed Scope of Work
Research Design
The Phase I intensive survey of this APE and the subsequent analyses were expected to reflect
highly mixed deposits that relate to urban soil and previous surface disturbance. Predicated on the
archival research and the cartography report(s), the following two items are expected:
1. Any historic artifacts recovered will suggest late nineteenth through late twentieth century
development and occupation.
2. Prehistoric artifacts, features, or cultural material may be located but not in an in situ context.

Proposed Scope of Work

Environmental Definition of Study Area
Surface Ecology
The APE is as a vacant tract with a mixture of heavily wooded, undeveloped land and mowed
grasses with a minimum of understory trees, brush, and vines (Photographs 1, 2 and 4). There is a
small, manmade lake in the northern portion of the APE (Photograph 3). The vertical dimensions of
the APE disturbance will be greater than one mbsl. Surface visibility was zero- to 50-percent. The
nearest perennially potable water is Willow Creek, which is approximately 1.5-km north-northwest
of the APE.

Geomorphology
The project location contains one soil series – Wockley (Wo):
The Wockley series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately slow permeable
soils. These nearly level soils upland soils formed in loamy sediments from the Willis Formation of
late Pliocene age. Slope ranges from 0- to 1-percent but is dominantly from 0.1- to 0.5-percent. The
Holocene deposits were expected to extend from 18- to 45-cm.
Investigative Studies and Methodology
During the period of July 31 – August 01, 2010, Robert P. d’Aigle, Principal Investigator with Jerry
Raymond, as crewmember, completed the Phase I intensive archaeological survey. The weather was
mild and clear. There were no logistical impediments in completing the required testing. The manmade lake was the only area excluded from testing.
Auger Testing
The seventeen auger test excavations were sufficient in number and depth to assure satisfaction of
permit requirements (Figure 4 and Tables 3-4). All tests extended at least 10-cm into Pleistocene

soil. All excavated spoil was screened through 0.635 centimeters perforated aluminum or thoroughly
examined by trowel. All auger tests were negative.
Pedestrian Transects
Twenty-six pedestrian transects at 20-m intervals were completed across the APE. The surface
visibility was zero- to 50-percent. All transects were negative (Figure 5 and Table 5).

Interpretation of Results and Recommendations
CRC, LLC certifies that no indications of cultural deposits were found during this investigation. No
historical structures and other historic cultural features were noted. There was no evidence of
prehistoric midden deposits, structural features, or other deposits.
It is our conclusion and recommendation that no further archaeological investigations be required for
this proposed project by the RH of Texas Limited Partnership, Northlake at Gleanloch Development,
Tomball, Harris County, Texas.
While an archaeological investigation to identify the presence of significant cultural resources within
the current APE has been performed, the possibility must always be acknowledged that some deeply
buried, or otherwise obscured, cultural resource deposits or features might not have been identified
in the course of this investigation. In the event that project construction or disturbance should reveal
any significant archaeological remains not identified in this investigation, the client is requested to
contact CRC, LLC, International Archaeology & Ecology Consultants, Conroe, Texas (832-5929549).
