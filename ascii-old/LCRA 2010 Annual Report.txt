Management Summary
In June, 2010, the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) entered into a new Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) with the Texas Historical Commission (THC) under which the LCRA is granted
permission under the Antiquities Code of Texas to conduct cultural resources assessments for LCRA
construction projects. The new MOU replaced a previous Memorandum of Agreement that the agencies
had entered into in May, 2005. The new MOU allows the LCRA archaeology department to conduct
construction monitoring, archaeological surface reconnaissance, and intensive cultural resource surveys
on new and existing tracts, facilities, transmission lines, and substations 300 acres or less in size under
authorization of a yearly blanket Texas Antiquities Committee Archeology Permit issued for the calendar
year. Such projects are submitted to THC through interim reports that THC reviews and comments on
during a 30-day review process. These reports are then finalized and included in the Annual Report.
There are now three notable exceptions to these Standard Review and Reporting Procedures. The first is
for small (less than five acres in size), negative (no archaeological sites present) field surveys. The results
of such projects are summarized in memo form for LCRA project managers and then compiled in the
Annual Report for ex post facto THC review.
The second is for maintenance projects that involve routine and/or periodic potentially ground-disturbing
activities in areas that have been previously disturbed by initial construction or through a history of
similar activities. These are primarily for transmission line rights-of-way (ROW) but may also include
fence repair and replacement, prescribed burns, and existing fire lane and road maintenance. Such
projects receive at minimum a file review that evaluates previous levels of investigation and locations of
previously identified sites that are potentially eligible or listed as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs).
If warranted, such projects will also undergo field surveys that will typically focus on high probability
areas where ground disturbance is expected. Recommendations for any site or ground disturbance
avoidance areas are then communicated to LCRA project managers in memo form, and likewise compiled
in the Annual Report for ex post facto THC review.
The third exception is for projects that occur in previously disturbed areas of existing LCRA-owned lands
and LCRA ROW easements, including (1) electrical substations, (2) power plants, (3) water and
wastewater treatment plants, (4) routine structural maintenance of existing electrical transmission poles,
and (5) pipeline repair or replacement in existing trenches. Under the new MOU, such projects do not
require review by the THC. However, LCRA project managers must coordinate with LCRA
archeologists early in the planning stage to ensure that no SALs and/or NHRP eligible or potentially
eligible archeological sites are present in the new construction areas and that the new construction areas
have indeed been previously disturbed.
Other projects reviewed by LCRA archaeologists do not require an archaeological survey, typically
because they are in low probability areas or have been previously evaluated. In such cases letters are sent
to the THC reviewer explaining the rationale for such recommendations. As with interim reports, THC
reviews and comments on these within a 30-day review period. These letters are also included in the
Annual Report.
From January 1 through December 31, 2010, the Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Cultural
Resource Services staff conducted file searches, field reconnaissance, intensive survey-level cultural
resource investigations, and archaeological monitoring for 73 projects under Antiquities Permit No. 5528.
These took place in west, central, and south-central parts of the state in 35 counties. The total area
covered by these projects adds up to 4704.71 acres. However, actual on-the-ground surveys covered
812.37 acres and 490 acres of this was done during the Grelle Recreation Area Survey, a synthesis of
surveys done over many years prior to 2010.
i

Thirty previously unrecorded archeological sites were given trinomials. These new sites include 23
prehistoric components and nine historic components. Five new sites, all in the new San Saba River
Nature Park, have been designated SALs. These sites are situated along both sides of a spring-fed creek
in the floodplain of the San Saba River. All of these SALs probably contain substantial Late Prehistoric
occupations and at least two have evidence of Late Archaic occupations as well. Backhoe trenching
exposed buried stone hearths at most of these sites as well as charcoal and bone, indications of good
preservation. Notably, large concentrations of mussel shell are found at these sites, indicating a heavy
reliance on this food source. In addition to the prehistoric manifestations, the new park also has three
historic sites, including the masonry ruins of a late 19th century waterworks built by Edmond Risien.
During other 2010 projects, six new sites were assessed as potentially eligible for SAL designation, most
recorded during the T-267 Buchanan CTEC to Pitsburg Maintenance project that crossed a dozen streams
in the eastern part of Llano County, including two crossings of the Llano River.
Fifty-seven previously-recorded archeological sites were also assessed during these projects, either by
field survey or through file searches. One of these sites is 41BT1, also known as the Grelle site, was
excavated by the University of Texas in 1939 and 1940 and has already been designated as a SAL.
Sufficient information has been gathered on two other sites in the Grelle Recreation Area to know that
they are also eligible of SAL designation. A previously-recorded site, 41SS113, revisited during the San
Saba River Nature Park Survey was also designated an SAL. In addition, 25 more of the previouslyrecorded sites are potentially eligible for SAL designation.

Introduction
From January 1 through December 31, 2010, the Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA)
Archaeology Services staff conducted file searches, field reconnaissance, intensive survey-level cultural
resource investigations, and archaeological monitoring for 73 projects within the LCRA’s 11-county
statutory district and broader 42-county service area (Figure 1). Additional electrical transmission-related
projects were also conducted outside of LCRA’s traditional service area. These cultural resource
investigations were conducted by LCRA Archaeology Services staff members Daniel J. Prikryl and
Andrew F. Malof with the aid of contracted archaeologists Charles A. Hixson, Glenn T. Goode, and Pat
Hatten under the authorization of Texas Antiquities Permit Number 5141. Mr. Prikryl, Mr. Malof and
Mr. Hixson were the Principal Investigators under this permit.
The LCRA’s 2010 Annual Report, the twentieth in a series of yearly reports submitted to the Archeology
Division (AD) at the Texas Historical Commission (THC), summarizes in-house investigations that
include records checks, reconnaissance, intensive surveys, and monitoring of projects that are each 300
acres or less and are located on LCRA’s lands and easements. Investigations for projects of more than
300 acres or involving test excavations or full-scale mitigative excavations are conducted under
authorization of separate Texas Antiquities Permits either by in-house staff or consultants and are not
reported in this document.

Environmental Background
Introduction
From its headwaters on the Llano Estacado near Lamesa, Texas, the Colorado River flows 864 river miles
to its mouth at Matagorda Bay, a watershed that for millennia has been the major source of water for
Central Texas and portions of the Coastal Plain (Figure 2). It has provided prehistoric and historic Native
Americans as well as historic pioneers with the resources necessary to sustain life. The effects of
environmental change on the river and its resources have a concomitant impact on the people who are
dependent on those resources. Subsequent change can be reflected in the settlement patterns or in the
tools prehistoric people used to process the various food resources. Research of the landscape and
cultural evolution along the river is a goal of the LCRA. The information in some areas is more abundant
than in others, the result of differential research. This section provides a brief physiographic background
for the Colorado River within the 11-county LCRA statutory district from San Saba County in the Llano
Uplift Region to Matagorda County on the Gulf Coastal Plain (Figure 1). Subsequent sections focus on
the ancient and modern people who depended on the river for sustenance.
Physiography and Geology
The Colorado River flows in a generally southeasterly direction crosscutting bands of geologic deposits
generally oriented on northeast-southwest lines. Along its course through the LCRA statutory district, it
crosscuts three major physiographic zones: the Llano Uplift, the Hill Country, and the Gulf Coastal Plain
(Sellards et al. 1932: Figures 3 and 4).
The Llano Uplift. As the Colorado River enters San Saba County at the northwest boundary of the LCRA
statutory district, it intersects Paleozoic Era formations of sandstone, limestone and shale of
Pennsylvanian and Misissippian ages (Arbingast et al. 1976:11). Beginning about midway in the county
and into Burnet and Llano counties, the river traverses billion-year-old Precambrian Era igneous and
metamorphic formations of the Llano Uplift region (Fisher 1981). Granite, schist, and gneiss are a few of
the rocks observed in the region. The Llano Uplift region has very rugged topography with elevations
that range from 1,500 ft above mean sea level (MSL) to 825 ft MSL along the river. High points are
Packsaddle Mountain, Backbone Ridge, Long Mountain, and the Riley Mountains. Black (1989:7)
observed that Packsaddle schist and granite were used by prehistoric aboriginal groups in Central Texas.
Grave offerings made from the schist were reported at a cemetery site downstream on the coastal plain in
Austin County along the Brazos River (Hall 1981). Granite cobbles from the river were favored for use as
grinding stones (Johnson 1991) and observed by the authors at sites in the Hill Country and at the
Kingsland Site (41BT215). Gravels deposited during Pleistocene floods cover earlier deposits in some
areas along ancient flood terraces. The gravels provided prehistoric people with cobble chert and
quartzite for stone tools.
The Edwards Plateau/Hill Country. Continuing its meandering course, the river traverses Cretaceous
limestone deposits in Burnet and Travis counties (Fisher 1974 and 1981). The area is classified as the
Hill Country, a subprovince of the Edwards Plateau (Woodruff 1975:4). Woodruff (1975:4) describes the
area as “.... an area of high relief, steep slopes, and high stream dissection that occurs between the
Balcones Escarpment on the east and the contiguous Edwards Plateau farther west”. Elevations do not
change radically from the preceding reaches. The formations can contain nodular and tabular chert. The
prized chert of the Edwards Limestone formation provided highly workable raw material for the
manufacture of prehistoric chipped stone tools. In addition, the gravels deposited during Pleistocene
floods that mantle earlier deposits in some areas along ancient flood terraces provided prehistoric people
with cobble chert and quartzite for stone tools. The Balcones Escarpment marks the southern boundary of
the Edwards Plateau and the southeastern boundary of the Hill Country.

From this point, the limestone dips southeast and under younger sandstones. From the edge of the
escarpment, the river continues its course onto the geologically younger Gulf Coastal Plain. Given the
resistant nature of the geologic formations in the Hill Country and Llano Uplift regions, it is probable that
the river entrenched early in time, forming steep-sided, narrow canyons in some areas (Looney and Baker
1977:323). This is not the case along the lower channel on the Coastal Plain where the river has
frequently meandered and rechanneled in the less resistant formations.
The Gulf Coastal Plain. The Blackland Prairie represents the first surface unit traversed by the river at the
interior end of the Gulf Coastal Plain. Situated at the base of the Balcones Escarpment, the Blackland
Prairie is a northeast-southwest trending geographic province (Arbingast et al. 1976:12). The Blackland
Prairie has relatively flat topography and its surface geology consists of Cretaceous-aged clay and marl.
As the river continues through Bastrop, Fayette, and Colorado counties, it has incised a channel into
Eocene and Miocene age sandstones and clays, leaving behind ancient floodplain terraces (see Caran et
al. 1992). Radiocarbon dating of a volcanic ash zone in one of the older upper floodplain terraces near
the town of Smithville in Bastrop County indicates terrace development prior to the 620,000 BP (before
present) date (Caran et al. 1992:3-4). The ash is a Middle Pleistocene windblown deposit from volcanoes
in the Yellowstone area. The uplands are hilly in places with gentle slopes. Elevations range from 500 ft
MSL in the uplands to 350 ft MSL along the river banks. Gravel deposits along the river in Bastrop and
Fayette counties are millions of years old. The earlier gravels (i.e., deposited during the late Tertiary
Period) were deposited by large ancient river courses transporting gravels in the channel from as far away
as the Rockies. Now these same erosion-resistant gravels mantle river basin and tributary divides.
Referred to in some areas as Uvalde Gravels (Byrd 1971), they provided prehistoric man with a source of
usable chert and quartzite for chipped stone tools.
The outer bands of the Gulf Coastal Plain in Colorado, Wharton and Matagorda counties are composed of
relatively flat clayey Pleistocene surfaces of the Beaumont Formation and other fluviatile terraces. Relief
is minimal with elevations ranging from 10-40 ft MSL in the uplands to 5-10 ft MSL on the flats near the
river channel. Gravel deposits are scarce. Prehistorically, this resulted in an adaptation to other types of
material for tools such as shell and bone. On the outer plain where the Pleistocene Beaumont clays
predominate, a high incidence of megafauna remains ( e.g., mammoth, camel, mastodon, bison, sloth) has
been observed and specimens collected from the clays at places such as the mouth of the Sabine River
(Long 1997). Paleoindian artifacts dating to 12,000 years ago have been found on the nearby beach
(Long 1977).
Soils
Except along the Colorado River floodplain where aggrading alluvium has formed terraces, soils along
the river uplands bespeak the underlying strata or parent material. Numerous Soil Conservation Service
soil series describe the consistency of the various soil groups.
In the Llano Uplift area, upland soils can be formed from decomposing granitic and decomposed organic
material (e.g., leaves, bark, berries, cedar duff). The sandy granitic soils contain particles of mica, quartz
and schists (constituents of the granite). At 41BT215 (The Kingsland Site), some of the sandy granitic
soils have been redeposited down slope by runoff (colluvial redeposition). Near the base of the slope
where the soils have been redeposited, the river has flooded and deposited sediments. The combination
has left alternating bands of alluvial and colluvial deposits.
In the limestone country of the Hill Country, the soils are deep to shallow, and predominantly consist of
stony calcareous clays and clay loams that formed from parent limestone, marl, and organic humic
deposits. In some places where erosion has exposed limestone bedrock, the soils are pocketed on

5

erosional benches. Since these clay and clay loam soils are non-acidic, bone and charcoal are better
preserved in archeological deposits.
On the Gulf Coastal Plain, topsoils are variable and mimic the underlying geologic formations. Beginning
with the Blackland Prairie on the interior edge of the Gulf Coastal Plain, clay and clay loam topsoils are
derived from the underlying limestone, marl, and clay surface geologic formations. Downstream from the
Blackland Prairie, sandy to fine sandy loams occur in areas underlain by various Eocene and Miocene
sandstone bedrock formations. Further southeastward, clay loam and clay topsoils are found adjacent to
the Gulf of Mexico in the Coast Prairies of Wharton and Matagorda counties.
Vegetation
Changes in the vegetation along the Colorado River correspond with changes in soils and bedrock
geology. McMahan et al. (1984) describe the various vegetal classifications. The descriptions presented
by the authors include dominant as well as understory species. To more fully understand the
classifications, two physiognomic classes need definition:
1. Parks - Woody plants mostly equal to or greater than 9 ft tall, generally dominant and growing in
clusters, or as scattered individuals within continuous grass or forbes (11 to 70 percent woody canopy
cover overall).
2. Woods - Woody plants mostly 9 to 30 ft tall with closed crowns or nearly so (71 to 100 percent canopy
cover); midstory usually lacking (McMahan et al. 1984:2).
The Llano Uplift Region is characterized by Live Oak - Mesquite Parks, where overstory species include
post oak, blackjack oak, cedar elm, and black hickory. Understory species include buffalo grass, curly
mesquite, little bluestem and Texas winter grass. These species mainly grow in granitic soils.
In the Hill Country the vegetation ranges from Live Oak - Ashe Juniper Parks to Live Oak - Mesquite Ashe Juniper Parks, where overstory species include live oak, Texas oak, shin oak, and cedar elm with
under story species such as agarito, flameleaf sumac, Texas pricklypear, little bluestem, Texas winter
grass, and curly mesquite. These species are mainly found on level to gently rolling uplands and ridge
tops.
Along the edge of the Balcones Escarpment the vegetation is referred to as Live Oak - Ashe Juniper
Woods. Overstory species are the same as in the preceding categories, with some different understory
species such as evergreen sumac, twistleaf yucca, and escarpment cherry. Species are mainly found in
shallow limestone soils in the hills and escarpment.
On the coastal plain, the original vegetation of the Blackland Prairie was bunch and short grasses
(Arbingast et al. 1976:13) with narrow riparian zones restricted to the flanks of stream channels. Much of
the Blackland Prairie was placed into crop production during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. As a
result only occasional remnants of the original prairie grasslands have survived. East of the Blackland
Prairie, a Post Oak Woods/Forest with Grassland mosaic is found in the Post Oak Savannah. Overstory in
these areas is post oak, blackjack oak, eastern red cedar, mesquite, black hickory, cedar elm, and
hackberry. Understory species include little bluestem, silver bluestem, dewberry, and yaupon.
Anomalous to the area are stands of loblolly pine mixed with post oak in Bastrop County. Along the
coastal prairies in Wharton and Matagorda counties, the original vegetation consisted of coarse and coarse
bunch grasses and marsh and salt grasses. The development of croplands in the historic period has altered
the vegetation regime in many parts of this region.

Archaeological Background
Introduction
The portion of the LCRA’s 11-county statutory district from its upstream end in San Saba County down
into central Bastrop County falls within a region defined as the Central Texas Culture Area during
prehistoric times (Prewitt 1981). Downstream eastward from the vicinity of Bastrop, Texas to Wharton,
Texas, prehistoric remains show influences from both Central and Coastal Texas during certain
prehistoric periods (Skelton 1977). At least one attempt to define an East-Central Texas prehistoric
culture area within the Post Oak Savannah region has been made (Goode 1984). However, aside from the
fact that burned rock midden sites are restricted to the Hill Country area, prehistoric archeological
materials from the Paleoindian and Archaic periods in East-Central Texas and along the coastal portions
of the Colorado River drainage are generally similar to those found in Central Texas Culture Area. For
this reason, the prehistoric Culture History Section that follows heavily utilizes the well-established
Central Texas chronology. In the Late Prehistoric section, however, the cultural remains along the coast
are discussed separately from those inland since a distinctive Late Prehistoric cultural tradition is evident
on the coast from the Bay City area down to the coastal shoreline (including barrier islands) beginning
approximately A. D. 1000. Last of all, the authors recognize the merits of Ellis et al’s (1995) argument
that the traditional Central Texas prehistoric cultural sequence summary typically presented in
archeological reports glosses over the wide range of environmental diversity and the full range of huntergatherer adaptations and processes. However, it is beyond the scope of this report to adequately detail the
full range of such prehistoric adaptations and cultural processes along the lower Colorado River.
Prehistoric
First evidence of human occupations in Central Texas dates to what is known as the Paleoindian period.
This period is defined as prior to 8500 years BP. The Paleoindian period has been divided into two
distinct periods (Collins 1995: 376, Table 2), with the earlier Clovis, Folsom, and Plainview cultures
present at 11,500 BP. These early people are typically thought to have subsisted on varieties of big game,
the Clovis on mammoth and extinct forms of bison, the Folsom and Plainview on bison. New evidence is
suggesting that this view is in error, and that these people utilized the big game when necessary or
advantageous, but subsisted on a substantial percentage of smaller game as well (Collins 1995:381). This
early Paleoindian period was followed by a Late Paleoindian period, which has subsumed portions of
Prewitt’s Early Archaic. For example, the Golondrina style point, placed in the Early Archaic by Prewitt,
has been placed in the late Paleoindian period by Collins (1995:376) based on distinctive features such as
edge grinding and size. Lifeways, however, seem to indicate a more archaic lifestyle (Collins 1995:382).
This has been termed a transitional period, with Paleoindian strategies slowly giving way to broaderbased pursuits of the relatively more sedentary hunter-gatherers of the Archaic (Johnson 1989:52).
The entire Central Texas Archaic spans some 7500 years, from ca. 8500 BP to around 1250 BP. It can be
characterized generally as a time of increasing human populations adapting within a fluctuating but
generally warming climate. Following Collins (1995) the Early Archaic begins around 8500 BP, and lasts
until 6000 BP. The Middle Archaic follows and lasts until around 4000 BP, followed by the Late Archaic
I to 2500 BP, and the Late Archaic II, to about 1200 BP. The Late Prehistoric, or as Johnson now refers
to it, the Post Archaic, follows, and here the phases mentioned earlier seem to hold fairly well, with
Austin phase peoples around until about 800 BP when a seemingly true cultural horizon (Johnson 1994),
the Toyah phase, began.
Foraging cultures are immediately dependent upon natural resources for subsistence. It follows that much
information about lifeways can be gathered if ecological conditions can be ascertained. Collins et al.
(1993) and Johnson (1995) have both examined lines of evidence to suggest warming and cooling trends,
7

and these are both through the proxy of moisture, as temperature is very difficult to determine. Collins et
al. depend heavily on pollen analysis, which provides information on plant regimes from which climatic
data can be extrapolated. Johnson utilizes various lines of data, including pollen and microfauna from
buried contexts at Halls Cave, and also dated evidence of aggradation or lack thereof of stream side
terraces, with the assumption being that surfaces aggrade (or deflate) during wetter times, but remain
stable during drier times. Their interpretations agree very closely for the Middle and Late Archaic, but
are in direct opposition during much of the Early Archaic. Collins is also somewhat more conservative,
avoiding some of the fine-grained peaks and valleys seen in Johnson’s reconstruction (Collins 1995:Table
2, Johnson 1995:Figure 35).
The Early Archaic was a time when persons were having to adapt to the widespread extinction of the
large animals that had existed during the preceding Paleoindian period. Although the big game hunting
nomadic lifeway has been shown to be largely a stereotype, mobility was probably high and populations
relatively low (Collins 1995:381, Johnson 1989). This basic way of life extended into the first part of the
Early Archaic. Dart points are described as Early Split Stem, and include the Gower type first defined at
the Youngsport Site (Shafer 1963). Johnson has determined the period was relatively moist (Johnson
1995:Figure 35), while Collins shows it as fairly dry (Collins 1995:Table 2). Both indicate that the
beginning and end of the period were opposite what they showed for the majority, i.e., a peak of either
dryness or wetness at about the middle of the period. Evidence suggests that there were no bison during
this time (Collins 1995:383).
The question of bison presence or absence is very significant for understanding human behavior. Bison,
and to a lesser degree antelope, prefer open grasslands and prairies, and are also social animals, traveling
in large herds. The habits of these large-bodied mammals can be contrasted with the largely solitary
habits of woodland-preferring deer. In most cases bison would be considered to have high return rates,
tempered to some extent by high processing costs. The results would be evident in scheduling, mobility,
and technology of prehistoric people. In general, bison could be expected in tall grass prairies as opposed
to, for instance, oak savannas. Increases in available moisture favors tall grass over short grass, but also
can result in replacement of grasslands by woods. Johnson suggests that bison favored dry conditions in
Central Texas (Johnson 1995:86). Collins indicates bison were present in both wet and dry conditions,
and it is difficult to derive any patterns from his projected data (Collins 1995:Table 2). The strongest
correlation is between moisture-loving microfauna at Halls Cave and a long period of bison presence
through the Late Archaic. At other times bison are seen when all other indicators are of dry conditions.
Perhaps the best explanation comes from Ellis et al.’s (1995) discussion of environmental diversity.
Differential change on a micro- or meso-scale favored bison presence or absence on a scale too fine
grained to be reasonably compared with broader climatic shifts.
The Middle Archaic shows climatic conditions of Collins and Johnson coming into fairly close alignment.
Both agree that there was an initial period of fairly mesic conditions followed by a period of drying.
Johnson sees a relatively mild and slow-paced change, while Collins sees an almost catastrophic drought.
Regardless, it is at this time that rock features, designed in the Early Archaic for efficient control of fireproduced heat, expand in function and complexity, coinciding with a spread of xerophytes from the west
due to drying conditions, and resulting in the burned rock middens that begin to be seen (or at least are
more common) during the end of the Middle Archaic (Collins 1995:384, Prewitt 1991:26).
Projectiles in the first part of this period are thin, broad-bladed Bell/Andice/Calf Creek types, deeply
notched points that are believed to have been used both for hunting based on impact breaks, and as
knives, as seen in microwear analysis. This is consistent with a specialized hunting economy, and the
apparent bison presence at that time would be an obvious target of a multipurpose projectile/knife
(Collins 1995:384). The disappearance of bison coincides with the replacement of these types with
narrow, thick, heavy Travis and Nolan points. Johnson sees precursors of the bison tool assemblage
8

coming in from the Plains, and precursors of these latter points perhaps from the Lower Pecos, in the form
of Pandale points (Johnson 1995:88). This is suggestive, as the Plains would of course have had bison,
while they were largely absent in the Lower Pecos. Perhaps the new style was more efficient for the
newly high-ranked deer, which would surely have replaced bison as the preferred meat source. Toolkits
in general became more diverse, as diet breadth widened and generalization became necessary in order to
effectively intensify the use and processing of lower ranked food sources (Prewitt 1981:73).
The Late Archaic, as noted earlier, is divided into subperiods I and II. The first portion saw a
continuation of the dry period initiated earlier, and burned rock midden accumulations peaked at this
time. The Bulverde point, although in some respects similar in form to Travis/Nolan points, is seen, at
least by Johnson, to be a distinct technological break, and again to have apparent influences from the
northeast and Plains regions (Johnson 1995:89-90). It is this break, combined with a continuity seen in
succeeding Pedernales types as well as the extent of burned rock midden accumulations, that has resulted
in this major reordering of this portion of the Archaic.
Also appearing about this time was the Marcos-style point, another broad-bladed point with deep corner
or side notching, similar in some respects to the Pedernales, at least in width of blade. It is at this time
that Late Archaic I shifts to Late Archaic II, and the climate seems to become much moister. Apparently
bison are present throughout most of the Late Archaic, even as narrow bladed Ensor/Fairland points begin
replacing the broader Marcos/Williams/Marshalls.
One interesting way of explaining this seeming discrepancy would be by having these latter points hafted
on arrows (Tomka 1998), with an underlying (but wholly subjective) assumption that darts did not have
enough penetrating power for bison and so the emphasis was on a wide blade causing extensive
hemorrhaging. The penetration of darts was perhaps sufficient for deer if a narrower blade was used. A
narrow blade propelled by a bow, however, might have enough penetration to effectively kill a bison.
Regardless, increased moisture saw a retreat of the xerophytes, and a corresponding decrease in the
construction of burned rock middens, especially in the eastern portion of Central Texas.
There is also evidence of increasing populations, and processing of plants other than xerophytes is evident
based on an increase in numbers of groundstone from these components (Collins 1995:385). It is not
clear what was being so extensively processed with these implements. Acorns and grass seeds are two
possibilities. Cemeteries became more widespread, as does evidence of internecine warfare (Hall
1981:iii). Combined, these would suggest an attachment to land and protection of resources, and also a
certain increase in environmental stress or resource depletion. As well, Johnson sees general technologies
arriving from the plains, while social variables seem to be influenced from Woodland cultures to the east
and northeast (Johnson 1995:96, 97). In short, it seems to be a time of rapid changes in social complexity
with resource intensification and a broadening of the diet base, most likely as a response to the demands
of increasingly large human populations.
The Late Prehistoric period seems to be a continuation of Late Archaic lifeways up until Toyah times
when bison reappeared, as did a more nomadic life as well as technologies (blades and specialized
scrapers) not seen since Paleoindian times. The Late Prehistoric period has been subdivided into two
distinct intervals by Collins (1995: 385), which correspond to Prewitt’s Neo-Archaic Austin and Toyah
Phases. The early Late Prehistoric, or Austin Phase, shows a distinct trend toward arrow points, but the
Archaic lifeways seem to persist. The late Late Prehistoric corresponds to the Toyah Phase, and cultural
remains indicate a shift back towards a hunting subsistence base. Bison apparently became common once
more in Central Texas (Collins 1995:377, Table 2; Prewitt, 1981:84), and prehistoric peoples evidently
took full advantage of that resource. This period, of course, came to its conclusion shortly after the
arrival of Europeans to Texas in the early 16th century, marking the beginning of the Historic Period.

In the coastal region of the Colorado River drainage, Ricklis (1995) has proposed that the Late Prehistoric
extends from about AD 1000 to about AD 1700. During that era the material assemblage includes pottery
with types identified as sandy paste Goose Creek variations and Rockport Black-on-Gray variations some
with asphaltum decorations. During the historic period and quite probably during the later part of the
Late Prehistoric, Karankawan groups occupied the central coast. Archeological data suggests that the
Karankawa spent the fall and winter along the coastline in large encampments (Ricklis 1996:101).
Fishing and collection of shellfish were the principal economic pursuits at these sites. In the early spring,
and continuing through the summer, the Karankawa moved inland to smaller camps along the rivers and
creeks that empty into the coastal bays. The collection of wild plant foods and hunting of deer and bison
were important pursuits during that portion of the year.
Historic (200 BP - recent times)
Native American. The Historic Period begins at the time of European contact, ca A.D. 1500, although
along the Colorado River little direct interaction between Native Americans and Europeans occurred for
as much as 200 years after this time. Evidence of the early part of this period in terms of archaeological
materials is generally quite rare and minimal. While the descendents of the Late Prehistoric in the
vicinity of the mouth of the Colorado River appear to be the historic Karankawa (Ricklis 1995), the
cultural evolution of descendants of the Toyah Phase peoples is not well understood in the Central Texas
region. For example, Campbell (1988:73) cautiously names at least 60 historic Indian groups associated
with the Bastrop County area. Of these, only a portion could be considered native to the area. The
Tonkawa, generally believed by the public to be the single indigenous "tribe" of Central Texas, were
immigrants probably from what is now Oklahoma (Campbell 1988:75). Further westward in the Hill
Country, the Apache and Comanche were present during the Historic Period. Aggressive European
settlement across eastern and coastal Texas just into the fringes of the Hill Country destroyed most of the
native population prior to their removal to reservations.
Euro-American. In the early 1530s, Cabeza de Vaca became the first known European to transverse the
lower Colorado River (Hester 1999). Members of La Salle’s expedition and a number of early Spanish
explorers and missionaries crossed the Colorado in the late 17th century, but it was not until the early 18th
century that Europeans are known to have stayed for any length of time on the river (Baumgartner et al.
1997:17-26). In 1709, for example, the Spanish explorers of the Espinosa-Aguirre Expedition stopped
along the river in the vicinity of Wilbarger Creek between present day Austin and Bastrop, Texas
(Campbell 1983).
There are no records of any Spanish missions being constructed on the Colorado River, and actual
Spanish settlement on the Colorado River did not occur until relatively late. In 1805, Manuel Bustamante
ordered Spanish troops to be stationed at the El Camino Real crossing of the Colorado at present-day
Bastrop, Texas where a stockade was built and named Puesta del Colorado (Webb 1952, Vol. 2:120). It
was not until 1829 that permanent settlement began at Bastrop (formerly called Mina) with the arrival of
settlers associated with Stephen F. Austin’s third grant that was also known as the “Little Colony.”
Shortly before his death in 1821, Moses Austin had obtained from Spain the first land grant to introduce
American families into Texas. By the time the Congress of Mexico reaffirmed conditions of this grant to
his son, Stephen F. Austin, in 1823, settlement of the “Old Three Hundred” families on the lower Brazos
and Colorado rivers was well underway. On the Colorado River drainage, the grant allowed Anglo
settlement from the coast all the way up to the vicinity of present-day La Grange, Texas in Fayette
County.
Typical of early Anglo settlement on the Colorado River was Beason’s Crossing near the present-day
town of Columbus, Texas (Webb 1952:378). Among the early colonists at this settlement was Jesse
10

Burnam, who was able to raise enough able-bodied men in the Beason’s Crossing area in 1822 to march
down to the mouth of the Colorado to check on the robbery of a sailing vessel (Webb 1952:378).
Downstream in present-day Wharton County, twenty-five of the “Old Three Hundred” families received
title to land in that county in 1823 and 1824. Early settlement there centered around a trading post called
Preston, which was located on the east bank of the river about 10 miles south of the current town of
Wharton (Webb 1952:890). By the early 1830s, the western edge of the frontier had extended into
eastern Travis County with a chain of small family forts located at Webber’s Prairie, Coleman Branch,
and Fort Prairie (Webb 1952:796).
Numerous men from the Colorado River settlements participated in the Texas Revolution. However,
none of the major battles occurred on the Colorado River. Beason’s Crossing figured prominently,
though, in the Runaway Scrape, as many Texans crossed the Colorado at that location. After their safe
passage, Houston ordered the town of Columbus burned (Webb 1952:379).
Following the Texas Revolution, the community of Waterloo in central Travis County was selected as the
capital and renamed Austin in 1839. Settlements on the Colorado River below Austin continued to grow
as more settlers arrived in the years leading up the Civil War. In counties on the coastal plain, plantation
style agriculture was practiced by the wealthier landowners. While the majority of the settlers were
originally from the southern United States, German immigrants began entering the Biegel’s Settlement
area Fayette County area in the 1830s (Carter and Ragsdale 1976). After the Civil War, many former
plantation owners in Fayette, Colorado, and Wharton counties sold their lands in small parcels to other
German and Czech immigrants. They, along with former Black slaves, usually worked the land as tenant
farmers before accumulating enough money to purchase land. Cotton, corn, and sorghum were the staple
crops well into the mid 20th century.
Prior to the Civil War, Anglo settlement had spread up the Colorado River into through western Travis,
Burnet, and San Saba counties. Fort Croghan was established at the future townsite of Burnet in 1849
(Webb 1952:253). Among the earliest settlers in this region were a group of Mormons who operated a
mill. Noah Swithwick, a well-known early settler in Bastrop County, bought the Mormons’ mill in 1854
when he moved upstream to Burnet County. Several years later he built a new mill at a new site on the
nearby Colorado River (Smithwick 1983). Settlement along the middle Colorado was well-established by
the mid-1850s (Malof 2008).
Archival and oral historical research has been undertaken in recent years on a number of the early
communities in the present Lake Travis area in Travis and Burnet counties (Utley 1994 and 1996). In this
research, Utley (1996:9-10) notes that the Texas Hill Country lies west of the 98th meridian, Webb’s
(1931:8-9) dividing line between forested areas of the eastern United States and the Great Plains.
Following Webb’s thesis concerning how this dividing line affected the way of life of early settlers, Utley
shows how early attempts at cotton farming in the rocky soils frequently failed. As a result most settlers
adapted to ranching and other economic pursuits.
The construction of a chain of four lakes by the newly formed Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA)
in the late 1930s and early 1940s dramatically changed the landscape and the small communities along
the Colorado River in western Travis, Burnet, and Llano counties. The former emphasis on ranching has
given way to the development of lakefront subdivisions and tourism associated with the lakes.

Results of Investigations
During calendar year 2010, the LCRA’s Archeology Services staff conducted in-house cultural resource
investigations for 73 projects. As shown on Figures 3 and 4, 32 of these projects were located in the
Edwards Plateau/Hill County Region and areas westward, while 41 were located to the east of the
Balcones Escarpment. Table 1 provides a listing of the project names, project numbers, Interim Report
(IR) numbers, dates of investigations and THC concurrence (when applicable) and the construction status
of each project. This table also gives data on archeological sites that were recorded or revisited during
each project, the State Archeological Landmark (SAL) status of each archeological site, the amount of
acreage involved in each project area, and the county in which each project is situated.
Figures 3 and 4, along with Table 1 show that nearly 60 % of the construction-related projects were
located in just three of the nine major physiographic/natural regions that overlap the LCRA’s 42-county
service area (see Figure 1). Fifteen of these projects lie in the Blackland prairies, 18 on the Edwards
Plateau, and 10 in the Llano Uplift region. Much of this activity is related to development of parks and
preserves.

Part 1. Full Reports of Survey Investigations
Results of 14 interim reports (IRs) detailing cultural resource investigations for projects that
ranged mostly from five to 300 acres in size and/or resulted in the assessment of cultural resource
sites are presented in this section. The Archeology Division (AD) at the THC has previously
reviewed all 14 reports, and, in each case, concurred with the assessments and recommendations
presented by the LCRA Archeology Services staff.
An overall size exception occurred with a 15th report presented in this volume. The 500-acre
Grelle Recreation Area Survey was allowed under the terms of the Annual Permit as agreed upon
by the Texas Historical Commission (THC) and LCRA. This report is a summary of
investigations done in Grelle prior to 2010. Since it was not project-driven, the report was not
submitted previously as there was no need for review and concurrence.

Introduction
The Grelle Recreation Area (GRA), located on Lake Travis in southeastern Burnet County (Figure 1),
contains extensive archaeological deposits, both in upland margin areas and especially in the lower
terraces of Little Cypress Creek and the Colorado River. These terrace deposits are potentially the most
significant for archaeological research because they are preserved in stratified sediments. However, The
GRA terraces all lie below the normal pool elevation of Lake Travis and are subject to the detrimental
effects of fluctuating water levels (Lenihan et al. 1981, Malof 1988, Will and Clark 1996). At Grelle,
such fluctuations have clearly caused some sediment movement and displacement of cultural material.
Boat launching from trailers and relic hunting by park visitors have caused further impacts. Obviously it
is only logistically feasible to excavate these terrace sites when they are exposed during prolonged
droughts.
The upland margin sites at Grelle, often quite extensive, present their own integrity problems. Long-term
aboriginal use of essentially stable, non-aggrading landforms has resulted in the mixing of materials from
different cultural groups. Still, the archaeological record there complements that found in terraces and
can lead to a fuller understanding of aboriginal adaptations.
During the winter of 2005/2006, LCRA’s Archaeology Services staff made the first attempte at an
extensive cultural resource survey of the area in over 25 years. Approximately 265 acres, or 65 per cent,
of the land above the full pool level of 681 feet above mean sea level (amsl) of Lake Travis received at
least a reconnaissance-level inspection. During a period of drought conditions, another 130 acres below
the normal pool level down to an elevation of 662 feet amsl were also surveyed that winter, the first
systematic survey ever attempted of the near-shore lake bottom of the Grelle Recreation Area. Additional
survey work of the exposed lake bottom was conducted during the drought in the summer of 2009. As of
2011, approximately 490 acres of the GRA tract, including areas normally under Lake Travis, have been
surveyed The only areas that have not been surveyed lie mostly above the 800 foot contour, amounting to
approximately 40 acres.
This report presents the results of these recent surveys, and includes information gathered from earlier
surveys that have taken place in the GRA. The archeological sites are described and their significance is
assessed using the criteria for the determining State Archeological Landmark (SAL) status. These criteria
are described in Chapter 26 of the Texas State Antiquities Code.
Physiography and Landforms
Physiography, the study of physical geography, provides landform data that aids in assessing the locations
and distributions of various types of natural and cultural resources. In the broad sense, the GRA is
located within the Edwards Plateau section of the Great Plains physiographic province (Carr 1969:3). In
the general area around the Grelle property, land surfaces consist mostly of plains with high hills
(Hammond 1964:Map 4). Locally, the recreation area is situated immediately southwest of the
confluence of the Colorado River and one of its larger spring-fed tributaries, Little Cypress Creek.
The lower reaches of this creek bisect the Grelle landscape as the creek channel courses from west to east
before turning northeastward to empty into the river. Through time, the creek has dissected the landscape
to create a valley while simultaneously depositing sediment loads from upstream areas. Similarly, the
river affected the landscape and laid larger, thicker alluvial deposits immediately northeast of the
recreation area on LCRA-owned land. However, the tops of all of these alluvial deposits laid by both the
river and creek are usually about 10 feet below the normal level of Lake Travis of 681 feet amsl. Overall,
the Grelle Recreation Area lands and adjacent inundated areas can be divided into three localized
environmental/topographic zones: lowland/floodplain, upland margin, and uplands (Figure 2).

Lowland/Floodplain Zone
The lowland/floodplain zone extends from the top of the original banks of the Colorado
River and Little Cypress Creek at an elevation of 620 feet amsl up to 670 feet amsl. Sediments consist of
Holocene-era alluvium. As stated above, this entire zone is normally inundated by the conservation pool
level of 681 feet amsl of Lake Travis. A pre-reservoir map indicates that a broad expanse of the
lowland/floodplain zone was present immediately southwest of the confluence of Little Cypress Creek
and the Colorado River. This area measured about 1,650 feet on an east-west line by 660 feet on a northsouth line. Archaeological excavations at this area in 1940/41 led to the recovery of prehistoric artifacts
as deep as 24 feet below ground surface (Kelly 1940, 1941). These excavations will be discussed in detail
in a later section of this report.
Further south and westward, the lowland/floodplain zone that flanks both sides of the original Little
Cypress Creek channel is much narrower, ranging on average from 800 feet wide in the center of the
recreation area to only 400 feet in width at the far west (upstream) edge of the recreation area.
Undoubtedly, too, the thickness of the alluvial topsoil in the lowland/floodplain zone decreases
dramatically as one proceeds upstream on Little Cypress Creek.
Upland Margin Zone
The upland margin zone is defined as generally extending from 670 to 800 feet msl at Grelle. At normal
lake conservation pool level, the vast majority of the landscape within the recreation area falls within this
zone. Topography within upland margin zone is highly variable. For example, steep slopes constitute
major parts of this zone in the southeast quadrant of the recreation area. In that area, topsoils are shallow
to nonexistent with numerous exposures of bedrock geology, including Cow Creek limestone, Hammett
shale, and Sycamore sand evident on ground surface. In contrast, the southwest quadrant of the recreation
area consists of slightly sloping expanses of upland margin terrain with gravelly, stony loam and clay
loam topsoils of two- to 12- inch thickness.
Ridge tops overlooking the floodplains are capped with a thick layer of cobbly sand apparently of
Pleistocene age. Kelly (1940) called these landforms the “high terraces” in contrast to the lower alluvial
terraces of the Colorado River.
Upland Zone
Topographically, the upland zone extends from 800 feet amsl upward. Accordingly, the only upland area
within the Grelle property is situated within the southeastern quadrant. There, the landscape is flat to
slightly sloping. Exposures of the bedrock geology are common and elsewhere shallow gravelly clay
topsoil is present.
Vegetation
The vegetation of the GRA and surrounding areas has been classified as a live oak-ash juniper park
(McMahan et al. 1984). However, this is a highly generalized classification pertaining to upland areas
and other plant communities are present. Fowler (2005) lists seven different plant communities found in
the eastern Edwards Plateau, two of which, tree savanna and cedar break, probably occur in the GRA
today. In addition, two other of Fowler plant communities, riparian forest and bottomland forest, once
were present in areas now often inundated by Lake Travis.
32

Figure 6. Aerial showing the three environmental/topographic zones with the Grelle Recreation Area.

The tree savanna plant community occurs in portions of the uplands and the upper elevations of the major
ridges in the upland margins. These areas are typically drier since they receive more sunlight and lie well
above the water table. Principal tree species include live oak and cedar, and Texas persimmon. Mesquite
is found where soils are adequately deep.
The cedar break plant community is composed nearly exclusively of ashe juniper with a few scattered
oaks. It is found in the upland margins on the slopes of the major ridges and on the near-level to low
sloping ground in the southwestern part of the GRA.
A 2006 aerial shows the GRA to have a high percentage of tree canopy coverage in contrast to the open,
savanna-like vegetation in the ranchlands outside the park’s boundaries (see Figure 2). Aggressive
clearing on the surrounding private lands have kept the cedar (ashe juniper), the dominate tree species, in
check while cedar has mostly been allowed to grow freely in recent times in the GRA with only
occasional and very limited tree clearing. Examples of this clearing can be seen as small, irregular
openings in the tree canopy dotting the upland areas south of Little Cypress Creek. It is generally
acknowledged that modern ranching practices, especially the suppression of grass fires, have contributed
to cedar’s modern abundance and growth structure. Its distribution in the past is unknown but presumed
to be restricted to places less subject to the affects of fire such as ridge slopes.
Two other plant communities described by Folwer (2005), riparian forest and bottomland forest, once
existed within the tract in areas now inundated by Lake Travis. The riparian forest grew along the margins
of Little Cypress Creek and the Colorado River. Large cypress stumps from this forest are still visible
along the creek channel when lake levels are low. Certainly other riverine tree species grew there as well
such as sycamore and willow. Bottomland forests probably were found on the stream terraces but were
cleared for agricultural fields in the late 19th and early 20th century. According to map drawn by A.T.
Jackson in 1937, the Grelle family was cultivating areas on both sides of Little Cypress Creek
immediately upstream from the homestead buildings (Jackson et al. 1940).
Prehistoric Background
Over 50 years of archaeological investigations in central Texas have led to a general understanding of the
region’s chronology and prehistoric subsistence patterns (Collins 1995). From at least 11,500
radiocarbon years ago up until the Spanish period, the Edwards Plateau and the much of the rest of central
Texas was inhabited solely by hunter-gathering peoples. Even in the Late Prehistoric period (AD 700 –
1650) when native groups in other parts of what is now Texas were making the transition to an
agriculture-based economy, the central Texas groups continued to rely completely on wild resources.
Much of the archaeological record as presently understood relates to subsistence activities, the presence
of burned rocks from cooking facilities being a notable example. At certain locations, burned rock
fragments have accumulated around earth ovens or “baking pits” to the point of forming thick deposits
called burned rock middens (Black et al 1997). Usually when located on stable, non-aggrading
landforms, these middens attain a mounded appearance, hence they are known colloquially in the Hill
Country as “Indian mounds.”
Texas has traditionally been divided into a number of different archaeological regions, each defined by a
set of shared cultural traits such as projectile point forms. Many archaeologists today interpret huntergatherer cultures in terms of their adaptation to the natural environment, and one criticism of
archaeological regions is that they often encompass more than one environmental zone and so contain
more than one type of adaptation (Ellis et al. 1995). For example, the Central Texas Archaeological
Region encompasses six natural regions, including the Edwards Plateau where the GRA is located (LBJ
School of Public Affairs 1978).
34

One cultural trait that is characteristic of the Edwards Plateau, especially the eastern half, is the immense
size of burned rock middens, some covering several acres. Burned rock middens are found in other
natural regions of the state but the large size of those on the Plateau is unique and suggests a level of
activity and time depth not seen elsewhere.
Historic Background
This property was named after the Grelle family who owned the land from 1892 until it was sold to
LCRA in 1940. No documentation has been found indicating that anyone of Old World descent lived on
the land before Carl and Maria Grelle established their home there in 1892. Carl Grelle, in some
documents referred to as Charles Grelle, immigrated to the United States in 1859 from the SchleswigHolstein region of Germany, then under control of Demark. He lived first in New York City but soon
moved to Chicago where, in 1874, he wed another German émigré, Maria Severin (Debo 1979). In 1879,
the couple moved to Texas with their two young sons, living first in Smithville and later moving to
Burnet County, after the birth of their first daughter.
For a time the Grelle family rented land from W. H. Fowler of the Spicewood community, and then in
1892 bought the first of several land holdings located near the mouth of Little Cypress Creek. Their land
acquisitions would eventually take in portions of the James H. Johnson, James Cooper, and James Carr
surveys. During 1892, the Grelle family apparently built or at least had begun construction on a house
and outbuildings, had cleared and fenced fields and pastures, and put in cotton crop. That same year
marks the birth of August W. Grelle, one of 14 children of Carl and Maria Grelle, nine of whom lived to
adulthood. About this first year, Iona Grelle Ross, August’s daughter, wrote the following:
That first year was busy one with the grubbing and clearing land for the fields,
but grosspapa [Carl Grelle] and his two sons were equal to the task they
undertook. The crops were good on the newly cleared fields and they picked 100
bales of cotton the first year. The garden also yielded ample vegetables for table
use and for canning and drying for later use (Ross in Debo 1979).
An 1898 photo (Figure 3) shows the entire Grelle family posing in front of their home, a side-gabled halland-parlor house with clapboard siding (McAlester and McAlester 2009). The structure has an entrance
porch on one side and what appears to be a full-width porch with extended roof on the opposite side. A
much later photo (Figure 3, left) of the west façade of the August Grelle house shows a board and batten
sided house with a wrap porch on at least three sides all covered by an integral pyramidal roof. Obviously
the house had undergone substantial remodeling or perhaps was rebuilt entirely. This was often case as a
family grew in numbers and wealth could afford larger accommodations. In this later photo, a barn,
which was reputedly quite large, is visible in the background.
A.T. Jackson’s 1937 map drawing shows the Grelle farmhouse and an outbuilding (garage?) on the west
side of a road across from two other structures, one the large barn which dwarfs the other buildings
(Jackson et al. 1940). A small agricultural field is depicted immediately north of the building close to the
creek channel and a larger field on the east side of the creek.
In addition to growing cotton and other crops, the Grelles owned a peach orchard and harvested pecans
from native and perhaps planted trees growing along the creek and river. Sometime between the late
1890s and early 1910s, a large family by the name Wallace lived as tenants in a house on a hill across the
creek from the Grelle farmstead. Little is known about them, and they appear to have moved away from
the Spicewood area before or soon after Carl Grelle’s death in 1911.

1930s or early 1940s at left, and in 1997 in Marble Falls at right.

Ownership of the farm eventually passed on to August Grelle and his wife Donna (Ross, interviewed by
Utley 1997). In 1940 just before the property was sold to LCRA, an appraisal showed 60 acres under
cultivation, another 450 acres devoted to pasturage; 40 fruit trees and 350 pecan trees were growing on
the property. The buildings then present included the farmhouse, barn, garage, and two sheds. These
were auctioned off by LCRA, the house being sold and moved to Marble Falls and still occupied in the
1990s (Figure 4, right).
The Grelles were aware that Native Americans once lived on their property, the evidence being
particularly noticeable on the mounds in the large field across the creek from the homestead. August
Grelle probably led archaeologists to these mounds, which were actually burned rock middens, in 1937.
In my daddy’s field, which was bordered on the west by Cypress Creek, and on the north
and east by the Colorado River, were some large Indian mounds. After a rain or after my
daddy had plowed over the mounds, arrowheads were easy to find. There were a number
of pecan trees on the creek also. When the pecan crop was maturing, the squirrels were
plentiful. It was during this time I would often go with daddy squirrel hunting. When we
would tire of hunting we would go to the arrowhead mounds and hunt arrowheads (Ross
in Debo 1979).
It appears that some Grelle family members participated in the archaeological excavations conducted by
the University of Texas on their property:
As years passed, the Lower Colorado River Authority bought our land on the creek and
river. L.C.R.A. allowed the University of Texas to send workmen to dig into the
campsites for Indian artifacts. Many were found, including six Indian skeletons buried in
a sitting position with large stones over their heads. Either because of lack of funds or
the filling of the Lake Travis, the excavations were abandoned in 1940 (Ross in Debo
1979).
Previous Investigations

The Grelle Site, 41BT1
On June 16, 1937, LCRA granted permission for the Anthropology Department of the University of
Texas to conduct an archaeological survey of the basin of the Marshall Ford Dam. The project was
funded by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and was intended to locate archaeological sites in
areas that would be inundated by the reservoir. One of the sites recorded by the survey’s field
archaeologist, A. T. Jackson, was on the east bank of Little Cypress Creek in an agricultural field owned
by August W. Grelle. Jackson reported two large burned rock middens and recommended the site for the
excavation phase of the basin survey project (Jackson et al. 1940).
The excavations that were eventually carried out at the site were some of the largest in terms of volume of
earth moved in the history of Texas archaeology (Figure 5). It is now called the Grelle Site and has since
been given the trinomial of 41BT1. J. Charles Kelly, who had recently led excavations at two other sites
downstream from Grelle, supervised a team of WPA relief workers from December 1940 until funding
ended four months later.
At a time when archaeology was concerned with chronology and typology, the excavations at Grelle and
the other Marshall Ford sites were remarkable for the attention paid to site formation processes, especially
37

in regard to burned rock middens. Stone hearths and rock scatters were common in the black silts that
capped the underlying red clay deposits. Kelly theorized that the slow natural deposition of these silts
resulted in one hearth being constructed immediately on top of earlier ones in areas of frequent human
occupation and that middens are therefore the result of numerous, superimposed hearths, what became
known as the “intersecting hearth theory.” Most archaeologists today favor the explanation that each
midden contains the detritus from repeated use of center-focused earth ovens and is not composed of
numerous hearths (Black et al. 1997).
In his monthly reports on the excavations, Kelly (1940, 1941a, 1941b, 1941c, 1941d) devoted extensive
space to descriptions of the terrace structures along Colorado River and the lower reaches of the Little
Cypress Creek. Archaeological material was found primarily in the meter-thick zone of black humic
loam that caps the terrace about 40-foot above the lake, and in the upper part of the red clays beneath.
Sparse cultural material was recovered at even greater depths down to 25 feet. The terrace at about 20foot above the lake appeared to contain only displaced artifacts and is composed chiefly of the black
loam. Considering how deep the excavations went, the artifacts collected from secure contexts only date
back some 4500 years. Apparently older sediments – and the cultural material in them - were washed
away during earlier cycles of erosion and the present-day terraces built up relatively recently.
Kelly noted that the upper (100-foot) terraces capping the upland margins were deposited in a geological
period that predated humans and that those areas did not contain artifacts. Through shovel testing, we
now know that these upper terraces actually have a high artifact density. However, this cultural material
was originally deposited on the surface and has since been transported down into the terrace deposits by
natural disturbances such as vegetation growth and animal burrowing and possibly in some instances by
human-caused disturbances.
These early investigations encountered unanticipated finds including six burials, five in a compact group
that formed one of the few prehistoric cemeteries so far known on the Edwards Plateau. One burial
contained bone ornaments and another tortoise shell rattles. Each burial was enclosed by a kind of vault
– the Burial 1 vault was “monumental in character” – that was formed by rock slabs and grinding utensils
(Kelly 1941a). The excavations also uncovered burned tree stumps buried deep in the terrace. Kelly
speculated that these stumps were part of an ancient riverine forest, the precursor to the one that oldtimers told him once grew along the creek and river before clearing for agriculture (Kelly 1941c).
Other Investigations
In the 1960s, two burned rock midden sites, 41BT53 and 41BT54, were recorded by avocational
archaeologists who reached the property by boat. The sites are apparently under the full pool elevation
of Lake Travis and were exposed at the time because of drought. Site 41BT53 was tested using several
excavation units, during which a human burial was exposed. The recorders of these sites were aware they
were near a site excavated by the University of Texas, presumably 41BT1. Subsequent surveys by LCRA
archeologists failed to relocate these sites – they do not appear to be in the areas where they are currently
plotted on the TARL maps. One possibility is that that these two sites are actually the burned rock
middens at nearby 41BT1. If so, the recorders were unaware of this fact, and they also misplotted their
locations.
The upland and upland margin areas of the property were surveyed for the first time in 1979 by Prewitt
and Associates Incorporated (PAI) for an LCRA brush clearing project (Prewitt and Kotter 1979). The
survey took place over a few days and therefore was cursory at best. Still, 10 sites were recorded, most
being lithic scatters or lithic procurement sites located on the high terraces along the upland margins. In
addition, the Grelle farmstead (41BT166) was formally recorded for the first time along with another
38

Figure 9. 1. Aerial showing areas excavated during 1940 and 1941
39

historic site (41BT158) that, according to oral histories taken by historian Dan Utley in the 1990s,
represents the site of the house that was rented by Carl Grelle to the Wallace family.
Several more sites were recorded by LCRA staff archaeologists between 2000 and 2003, including the
first terrace site, 41BT345, since the WPA excavations. Two upland sites, 41BT448 and 41BT349, were
recorded during this time for a fence replacement project. Six more terrace sites lying below the full pool
level of the lake were located during the 2005/2006 inventory survey; two of these possessed burned
middens and several middens were documented at the previously recorded 41BT345. Only superficial
shovel testing was done at these sites but the potential exists for deeply buried cultural deposits.
Survey Results
A total of 25 archaeological sites have been recorded in GRA (Table 2, Figure 10). Twenty-three of these
sites contain only prehistoric components while two sites, 41BT158 and 41BT166, contain both
prehistoric and historic material. The prehistoric components include ten open camp sites, three lithic
procurement sites, four lithic scatters, four mixed-use areas, one cache site, and one campsite/cemetery.
Four of the open camps contain burned rock middens in addition to the usual burned rock scatters. Both
prehistoric components represent late 19th and early 20th century homesteads.
Prehistoric sites are divided into types based on features and artifact types found within them. These five
types are lithic scatter, lithic procurement, mixed use, cache, and open camp. A lithic scatter consists of
lithic materials including flakes, cores, informal tools, and formal tools. Such sites will have more laterstage reduction flakes (secondary and tertiary), than lithic procurement sites. Lithic procurement sites are
more limited in artifact types, but also more specialized, representing a specific activity. These sites
usually contain cores, tested cobbles, and a high ratio of primary flakes as opposed to secondary and
tertiary flakes. These are also dependent on the land form, as they are always found within existing
naturally occurring gravel deposits. A mixed use site will contain any number of lithic materials, and
evidence of food consumption or processing in the form of food remains (mussel shell or bone), or
implements (grinding stones). A cache site contains an isolated cluster of artifacts, usually of the same
class such as bifaces, concealed by someone for later use. An open camp contains burned rock, either
scattered or in the form of hearths or larger features. An open camp will of course also have a variety of
other materials.
Site Descriptions
41BT1
This is the site excavated by the University of Texas under the direction of J. Charles Kelly in the fall of
1940 through the spring of 1941. The site is located on the lower right terraces of Little Cypress Creek
immediately downstream from its confluence with the Colorado River. The excavated areas lie below an
elevation of 665 ft amsl except for a 30 feet square excavation pit placed on a slightly higher landform at
the east end of the site overlooking the Colorado River. In any case all the excavation areas lie well
below the historic average lake level of 668.97 ft amsl and have usually been underwater since the lake
was impounded in 1941.
Evidence of these excavations was documented by Archeology Services staff on several visits in 2005
and 2006. The still-visible outlines of the excavation areas correspond well in layout with those shown
on Kelly’s map on file at TARL. The large excavation pit in Area 8 was visible as a rectangular

depression in the creek bank (Figure 11). The long “control trench” running through Areas 9, 29, and 49,
while completely filled-in could still be made out by a strip of greener vegetation, similar to “crop
marks.” Former excavation pits in Areas 29 and 49 were also visible as rectangular patches of greener
vegetation.
Piles of burned rocks by these latter pits appear to be midden and hearth material discarded during the
excavation. These piles contain little loose sediment other than sand that has washed in recently and are
in clear contrast with the presumably intact burned rock midden surfaces that are exposed in the same
area. In these latter features, the burned rocks are densely packed within dark sediment.
Although a considerable volume of the terrace was excavated in 1940 and 1941, the methods used at that
time probably resulted in the lost of considerable information. For instance, excavated fill was not
screened and vertical controls were poor (Kelly, oral history on file at LCRA). Much could still be
learned by excavation of the intact portions of the terrace, which are considerable in volume since less
than ten percent of the site area (as presently defined) has been excavated. While the cultural deposits in
upper levels of the site, in particular in the black loam, are compressed and mixed to some degree, those
below in the red silty clay are probably separated into discrete zones. Kelly (1941d) only reported one
occupation level in the red silts but did note that artifacts continued to be found in small numbers down to
24 feet below the surface of the 40 foot terrace.
43

In January 1997, 41BT1 was formally designated as an SAL by the Texas Historical Commission.
Although the WPA-era excavations were quite large, much of the site has not been excavated. The 1941
report did not provide a detailed artifact analysis, and much additional research could be undertaken on
the existing artifact collections for the previous excavations.

41BT158
This is a historic house site and mixed-use prehistoric site located on the surface of a large ridge that
extends northwards into Lake Travis when at full pool. The surface and upper slopes of this ridge lie
within the Upland Margin zone as defined in this report. The northern end of the ridge is part of the
“upper terraces,” a term that Kelly (1940) used for high Pleistocene deposits to distinguish them from the
lower, geologically recent terraces of the Colorado River. The surfaces of these landforms are covered by
gravels densely packed in a sandy matrix. At 41BT158, the sandy soils support thick woods composed
mostly of cedar and mesquite with a thick understory of whitebrush, prickly pear, and tasajillo.
The site was recorded by Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (PAI) during the 1979 brush clearing project as a
Historic site within a much larger prehistoric site, 41BT159, that covers nearly the entire ridge (Prewitt
and Kotter 1979). At that time three or four small rectangular-shaped stone features possibly representing
piers to a structure were seen at 41BT158. The PAI archeologists considered the site “relatively intact”
and thought it might contain buried cultural deposits. Avoidance during the brush clearing project was
recommended.
When Archeology Services visited the site in 2006, the stone features were no longer arranged in
rectangular patterns but instead were jumbled together along with smaller fragments of burned rock on an
earthen mound, probably pushed up by heavy machinery (Figure 12). It appears that the PAI
recommendation was never followed during the 1979 brush clearing.
Shovel testing in 2006 recovered a surprising number of prehistoric artifacts at the site, mostly debitage
but also a few informal tools and two Late Archaic II projectile points (Figure 13, Table 4). A mussel
shell umbo, perhaps associated with the prehistoric component was also recovered. Historic artifacts such
as bottle glass, ceramics, and unidentifiable metal fragments were recovered mostly from the upper 20cm
of soil although a few were found at depths of between 40 and 60cm.
The shovel tests were excavated into a sandy loam matrix containing abundant gravels, which is the
typical material capping the ridges overlooking the Colorado River Valley. Since these sediments were
deposited hundreds of thousands of years ago, they predate humans in the Western Hemisphere. We can
discount colluvial deposition on the nearly level surface, so all the artifacts must have worked there way
down into the soil either by natural processes such as bioturbation, or by disturbances caused by human
activities. However, the prehistoric material does not decrease in frequency with depth, as would be
expected if it was originally deposited on the surface and then was displaced downward over time. This
suggests a long period of time has elapsed or major ground disturbances have occurred on the ridge.

44

While most of the cultural material at 41BT158 is buried, a moderate surface scatter of household trash
associated with the occupation of the house is spread across the site area, including aqua and amethyst
bottle glass, whiteware and stoneware sherds, and various metal objects. An unusual iron ball
approximately the size of a billiard ball was collected from the dirt road adjacent to the rubble pile.
Site 41BT158 appears to represent the house site that was rented to the Wallace family by Carl Grelle.
There is no known documentation on this house but the artifact assemblage dates to between 1880 and
1915 and overlaps the time when Carl Grelle was alive. Kelly established his field camp in the general
area of 41BT158 during the 1940/41 field season yet makes no mention of a house site. This suggests that
the structure had been removed or dismantled by that time.

As with the other ridge top sites at GRA, the 41BT158 cultural deposits are temporally mixed. Cultural
material probably began to accumulate soon after humans entered the area, although in very small
numbers at first but increasing with a rising human population, accounting for the relatively large number
of artifacts. The research potential for such sites is not immediately apparent considering the importance
of temporal control in archeology.
The historic component is restricted to a very narrow time frame, perhaps not more than 10 years,
providing information on the living conditions of tenet farmers in the first decade of the 20th century. The
house site has been totally destroyed but the surrounding sediments contain buried trash discarded by the
inhabitants. One or more privies are probably present that may contain more concentrated trash deposits
but these will be difficult to locate. Presently, historic components dating to the early twentieth century
are usually assessed as not eligible for formal designation as SALs. However, because future researchers
may someday view historic components such as the one at 41BT158 as having the potential to contribute
to a better understanding of early 20th century rural life in the Hill Country, the historic component’s
research is rated as uncertain.

41BT159
This mixed-use prehistoric site shares the same ridge top with the more spatially restricted 41BT158 and
is essentially an extension that site’s prehistoric component. PAI described this site as an upland camp
noting the presence of possible burned rock and a mano, in addition to debitage, cores, and early-stage
bifaces (Prewitt and Kotter 1979). Like the other ridge top sites in the GRA, the site area is extensive and
represents long-term use.
The cedar woods which cover the ridge are densest at the north end while at the south end the vegetation
is somewhat more open. Soils are typically gravelly and sandy.
Later surveys of the site were done at the reconnaissance level. Bruce Nightengale visited the site in 1994
and collected an “abrading stone” from the surface (Table 5). This artifact is made from a dark gray rock,
possibly graphite schist, oblong in shape, and measuring 8cm by 4cm. A rough groove runs lengthwise
down one side of the artifact and the opposite side is worn smooth. It possibly functioned as shaft
smoother.
Archeology Services conducted a pedestrian survey across the site in 2006 but did not do shovel testing.
Numerous chert cobbles, cores, and flakes were seen on the surface and suggest the site primarily was
used for lithic procurement. It is classified here as a mixed use site based on the presence of a mano. No
burned rocks were seen during the recent surveys.
The recovery and soil profile of the shovel tests at 41BT158 are probably indicative of what might be in
north half of 41BT159. Soils are made up of sandy loam at least 60cm thick (probably much thicker)
with abundant cobbles. As with the prehistoric component at 41BT158, the artifacts in these sediments
are temporally mixed and represent material that accumulated over thousands of years. Isolated cooking
facilities cannot be ruled out at this site but if they are present are thinly distributed and do not represent
near the intensity of use seen on the lower terraces of the creek and river. One potential positive attribute
of the site is its nearby location to and possible role as an upland activity area associated with site 41BT1.
As with 41BT158, however, the research potential of site 41BT159 is rated as uncertain.

41BT160
This prehistoric site covers the northwest end of a low wooded ridge that lacks the steep topography of
the other ridges in the GRA (Figure 14). And unlike those other ridges, it is not capped by thick, cobbly
sediments. Instead there exists a thin clayey soil with scattered gravels over bedrock. Because of its low
slope and easy access to the lake when at full pool, the point contains the main GRA campgrounds
currently open to the general public.
Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (PAI) recorded the site during the 1979 LCRA brush clearing project (Prewitt
and Kotter 1979). The site was described as a prehistoric terrace camp with one “hearth-size” feature of
burned rocks exposed in a dirt road. It was considered intact and avoidance was recommended during the
brush clearing.
A 2006 survey by LCRA’s Archeology Services for another round of brush clearing found that the
boundaries of 41BT160, for the most part, lie within the established GRA campground, an area where
there are numerous gravel roads, picnic tables, and a public restroom building (Hixson and Kiker 2007).
A small amount of chert debitage was observed on the surface along with natural chert cobbles in the
northwest part of the site area as defined by PAI. No tools or features were seen and only a few pieces of
burned rock were noted but these could well have come from the numerous stone-ringed campfires that
park visitors have built in this area. The intact hearth noted in the 1979 survey was not found although
this would be expected since the roads have been resurfaced with gravel. A shovel test (ST1) placed
within the area of the surface scatter recovered three chert flakes in the upper 20 cm of soil (Table 6). A
second test placed to the north of the first test recovered no artifacts.
Another 2006 survey, this time for an LCRA tree planting project, took place between the north boundary
of 41BT160 and the channel of Little Cypress Creek (Hixson and Kiker 2007). Lying closer to the creek,
there was a strong probability that 41BT160 extended into the area. Archeology Services placed four
auger tests in the area, reaching depths of between 50 and 100cm. No artifacts were recovered. Based
on information gathered from the recent surveys, in its current state 41BT160 is classified as a lightlyused lithic procurement area based on the co-occurrence of low-density debitage and naturally-occurring
chert cobbles. The hearth seen during the 1979 survey has either been destroyed or covered by park road
resurfacing. No other evidence of prehistoric cooking activities has been found during the surveys by
Archeology Services. If other hearths are indeed present they occur in such low numbers as to be
virtually undetectable by conventional survey methods. The site does not appear to meet any of the
criteria for designation as an SAL.

41BT161
Located 300 meters to south from 41BT160, 41BT161 was described by PAI archeologists as a
prehistoric upland limited activity area consisting of a surface scatter of tertiary flakes and one Pedernales
point (Prewitt and Kotter 1979). Because of disturbance to the thin deposits, it was not considered
significant enough for avoidance during the 1979 LCRA brush clearing project.
During the 2005/6 inventory survey by Archeology Services, the center of this site was found to be
located 500 feet to the southwest of where it was originally plotted, otherwise the findings match those of
the 1979 survey (Figure 15). A low density scatter of chert debitage was seen across 0.6 acres of a
heavily wooded, northeast trending upland slope. One shovel test was dug to a depth of 13 cm before
encountering limestone bedrock. One tertiary flake and the medial section of a dart point were recovered
from the shovel test (Table 7). This shovel test was placed in the portion of the site that appeared to have
the best depth of topsoil. Elsewhere, limestone bedrock is exposed and/or partially exposed in many areas
indicating very little potential for buried deposits. No burned rock or other classes of artifacts were seen
during the survey investigation.
Site 41BT161 represents one of only three lithic scatters in the GRA, sites containing only debitage and
chipped stone artifacts unassociated with naturally occurring chert cobbles. The small site area in an
upland area without nearby water sources suggests the lithics were disposed during a single period of use.
Alternatively, the site could just happen to be located in an area where, for local environmental reasons
such as sheet erosion, artifacts that are part of a much more extensive scatter have become more visible.
Either way, the site has little research potential beyond providing information on site distribution patterns.
It does not appear to meet any of the criteria for SAL designation.

41BT162
This prehistoric mixed-use site is located in the upland margins near the northeast corner of the property
(Figure 16). The site was initially recorded along with three other sites (41BT163-165) on the same
prominent landform, a sort of promontory jutting out into the Little Cypress Creek estuary (Prewitt and
Kotter 1979). All four sites were originally described as shallow lithic scatters. More intensive surveylevel work by LCRA’s Archeology Services staff in 2005 found that much of the promontory’s surface
contained buried prehistoric cultural material with the deepest and densest artifact areas lying along the
southern edge of the promontory. The site area of 41BT162 was redefined to include the entire ridge,
subsuming the areas previously covered by sites 41BT163 through 41BT165. These trinomials are no
longer in use.
The surface of the ridge appears flat and drops off steeply north east and south. The ridge top and slope
are covered by woods composed of cedar and various oaks. A few hickory trees are also present. A littleused dirt road runs the length of the ridge and descends down to the estuary of Little Cypress Creek at its
east end. Prior to the impounding of Lake Travis, the nearest water source to the site was the creek, about
50 meters to the east.
Shovel testing showed that the eastern half of the promontory is capped by thick, apparently Pleistocene
age alluvial deposits consisting of densely packed cobbles and pebbles within a sandy matrix (Table 8).
These deposits, which are also found on the other ridges that overlook the Little Cypress Creek estuary,
are not depicted on the Geologic Atlas of Texas, Llano sheet (Barnes 1981). Dense concentrations of
artifacts, mostly debitage and a few stone tools such as an unidentified dart point (Figure 17) were
recovered from the southern edge of the ridge. Considering the age of the high terrace deposits, these
artifacts must have worked their way down into the gravels from the surface through bioturbation or other
disturbances.
Site 41BT162 occurs in a similar environmental and topographic setting as 41BT158, 41BT159,
41BT167, and 41BT400. All these sites appear to have been used primarily for lithic procurement and
most have evidence for other activities more directly related to food preparation or consumption.
However, unlike the other ridge top sites, 41BT162 has strong evidence of cooking activities in that firecracked manos, a metate fragment, and other burned rocks from a possible hearth were recovered in a
shovel test (ST 7). How such a feature could become buried in Pleistocene deposit is puzzling and
suggests disturbances much greater than those caused by bioturbation.

As with the other ridge top sites, mixing of cultural remains a major obstacle to research. Even if
somewhat intact burned rock features were present, it would be difficult to determine which nearby
artifacts are actually associated with the features. For this reason, the site is assessed as not eligible for
formal designation as an SAL.

41BT166
Site 41BT166 represents the remains of the Grelle Homestead. Several features are still clearly visible,
including the underground cistern with above ground collar, and portions of the rock and mortar house
foundations (Figure 18). The frame house that once rested on the foundation, as stated earlier, has been
moved to Marble Falls. When first recorded by Prewitt and Associates in 1979, the house foundations
were still intact with masonry steps on the south side and a sandstone block on the west side thought at
the time to be a chimney foundation (Prewitt and Kotter 1979). By 1997 when the site was visited by
LCRA archeologists, the south and east sides of the foundation along with the stone steps had been
pushed aside by heavy machinery to an area north of the house site. The “sandstone” or concrete block
on the west side was found to have the imprint of a horseshoe on the top surface which is visible in a
1920s era photo of the front porch area of the house.
The cistern, constructed of limestone bricks and concrete masonry, is located at the southeast corner of
the house. A small concrete box, perhaps a filtration box used to filter rain water coming off the roof,

Figure 18. House foundation at Grelle Homestead site, 41BT166

once stood next to the cistern. Somehow the cistern collar escaped the bulldozing but the concrete box is
now lying in the rubble pile. The lower part of the cistern collar is in the form of a truncated pyramid 2
feet at the base and capped by a square concrete slab with a square opening (Figure 19). On one side of
the opening is an inscription written into the concrete when wet that reads “A L G FEB 25_27” (Figure
20). This indicates the cistern was built or repaired in 1927 perhaps by August Grelle although his middle
initial was apparently “W.”

The root cellar mentioned by Iona Grelle Ross in her family history is no longer evident (Ross in Debo
1979). To the east in an area that would be just under water when the lake is at full pool are stone
alignments and rock piles that may be associated with
with the barn and other outbuildings that were once
located in that area, as shown in the sketch drawing mentioned in the Historic Background section of this
report.
Household trash was absent in the vicinity of the house site. In 2005, Archeology Services
Serv
staff placed
three shovel tests around the house foundations to look for buried cultural deposits (Figure
(
21). The only
Historical artifacts recovered were 22 small rusted metal fragments from ST3, which was placed eight
meters northeast of the cistern (Table 9). It appears as though the Grelle family did not allow nonnon
perishable trash to be discarded near the house and instead disposed of it some distance away. In addition
to the Historic metal objects, ST1 recovered a prehistoric
prehistoric unifacial tool and ST2 recovered two pieces of
debitage, demonstrating that 41BT166 has a minor prehistoric component as well.
To conclude, the Grelle house is no longer present at the site, and portions of the house foundations and
stone stair steps were apparently damaged by previous brush clearing activities. Shovel testing around the
house revealed extremely few historic period artifacts and a minor number of prehistoric artifacts. The
remaining features are an underground cistern, the north and west sides of the house foundations, and a
linear arrangement of rocks that may be the foundations of former barn or outbuilding (Figure 21). This
last feature is normally covered by the lake’s conservation pool. Archaeologically, it is uncertain as to
whether the site would still merit formal designation as an SAL. A wealth of oral history and archival
data has already been gathered, and it is also uncertain whether any such additional data could be found.

Site 41BT167 is an extensive lithic procurement area covering the surface and upper slopes of a large
ridge located on the north side of Little Cypress Creek across from the main GRA campground (Figure
22). When the lake is at full pool, the ridge becomes a peninsula jutting out into the water. A woods of
juniper, and post oak covers the ridge and a few hickories grow on its north slope. A dirt road runs down
the spine of ridge, ending at the area of the Grelle Homestead (41BT166).

Figure 22. Map of 41BT167 showing shovel test locations.
65

When the site was recorded by Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (PAI) archeologists in 1979, they noted a high
concentration of debitage on the ridge. An unidentified dart point stem was found as well as several edge
modified flakes. The site was classified at the time as a lithic scatter.
Archeology Services staff visited the site in the winter of 2006 and generally confirmed PAI observations
regarding surface artifact density and type. Because of the numerous chert cobbles that cap the ridge, the
site was reclassified as a lithic procurement site. Two quartzite hammerstones were also noted. The
recovery from the two shovel tests placed in the site is shown in Table 10.
Site 41BT167 is the only ridge top site in the GRA with no reported evidence of mixed-use, such as
groundstone or food remains. The site is considered to have been fully recorded, and it is doubtful that
new or interesting data would result from any additional investigations. Thus, the site is assessed as not
eligible for formal designation as an SAL.

41BT345
This prehistoric campsite is located on a low terrace about 80 meters south of the Little Cypress Creek
channel and about 900 meters southwest of the confluence of this creek and the Colorado River (Figure
23). The site lies about 20 to 23 feet under the normal Lake Travis conservation pool level of 681 ft msl.
The site was exposed during the drought in the year 2000 and was recorded at that time with the
assistance of an informant, Bob Wishoff. Much burned rock, chert chipping debris, ground stone, and
mussel shell was exposed on ground surface when the lake level was low. According to Wishoff, several
arrow points and an Andice dart point had previously been found at the site.
At the time the site was recorded, four circular patterns of burned rocks that are probable prehistoric
hearths were visible in the bed of a dirt road in the northwestern half of the site. Two larger, slightly
mounded burned rock concentrations were also visible further southeastward off the road. Shovel Tests
(ST) #1 and 2 were excavated within these two burned rock concentrations. These shovel tests showed
that the cultural deposit extended downward from ground surface only 20 cm. ST #3 which was
excavated on the far southeast edge of the portion of the exposed terrace landform beyond the limits of
the surface exposed artifacts, indicated that a 60 cm plus thick cultural deposit was buried under 20 cm of
sterile flood silt. Based on the findings in ST #3 it appeared that the site extended for a length of at least
205 meters on northwest-southeast line by an average width of 25 meters.

66

Figure 23. Aerial map of 41BT345.

67

During a revisit to the site during the drought in the year 2007, an additional mounded burned rock
concentration was seen in the southeastern part of the site in addition to the two that had been previously
noted. All three of these features appeared to be small burned rock middens. Additionally, a large hearth
was observed at the far southeast edge of the site at that time and a Perdiz point was collected from the
surface (Table 11).
Several pot holes were noted in both 2000 and 2007 in various spots where artifacts are present on ground
surface. Although STs #1 and 2 indicate that the portion of the site exposed on ground surface does not
have much depth of deposits. However, the presence of buried cultural deposits at the far southeast end
of the low terrace suggests that intact, buried deposits with better research potential could be present in
that area. Based on that fact, the site is assessed as potentially meriting formal designation as an SAL.

41BT348
This is a small prehistoric site located along the west edge of a broad upland lobe gently sloping to the
north. The LCRA boundary fence bisects the west edge of the site, which probably extends eastwards
onto private property. Soils are generally shallow over limestone cobbles and bedrock or clay on which
grow short grasses and forbs under juniper/oak parks and woods. To the west, the ground descends
towards a deeply dissected drainage that runs in a northerly direction towards the lake. The slope is
densely wooded with cedars.
The site was recorded by Archeology Services for a 2001 fence building project. Artifacts observed on
the surface included a granite mano, approximately 1/3 complete, a sandstone metate in seven fragments
ranging from 5-10 cm in size, and two to three chert chunks. A total of three flake fragments were
recovered from three shovel tests.
This may be a single event locale with the groundstone set (mano and metate) representing "curated"
materials for upland food processing since hunting and tool maintenance activities are not clearly
represented. No additional information is considered to be available at this site, but if the adjacent private
property is ever available for investigation more information may be available there. The portion of the
site on LCRA property is assessed as not SAL eligible.

41BT349
This site is a low-density buried lithic scatter located 40 meters north of 41BT348 on the same broad
upland lobe. It is probably also bisected on the east by the LCRA boundary fence. This may be the edge
of more substantial deposits on private property to the east, and may have some connection with
41BT348, although the two are separated by eroded and sterile ground.
68

Soils are generally shallow over limestone cobbles and bedrock or clay. Seven chert chips and flake
fragments were recovered from 2 shovel tests. No additional information is considered to be available at
this site, if adjacent private property is ever available for investigation more information may be available
there. The portion of the site on LCRA land is assessed as not eligible for SAL listing.

41BT392
This is a burned rock midden site located on the right bank of Little Cypress Creek northeast of the GRA
campground and 80 meters upstream from 41BT345 (Figure 24). At an elevation of 665 ft, the site lies
below the full pool elevation of Lake Travis is often submerged. Archeology Services staff discovered
the site in 2005 during a drought when lake levels were low and Cypress Creek had retreated to its former
stream channel. At that time the burned rock midden was visible in the creek bank as a burned rock lens
approximately 50 to 75 m in length and not more than 30cm thick.
Shovel Test 1 was placed 3.2 meters southwest of the exposed rock layer where the midden layer was
expected to continue into the terrace sediments. The burned rock zone was encountered 18 cm below
grayish brown silty clay and was found to be surprisingly thin – only 10cm thick and resting at 28cm
below the surface. The test was dug down another 92cm to a total depth of 120cm through reddish brown
silty clay. Two flakes were recovered from the sediments above the burned rock lens and two more were
recovered from the burned rock lens (Table 12).
A second test was dug a few meters south of the southeast end of the exposed burned rock layer in an area
expected to be immediately outside the midden (Figure 25). Two flakes and six possible burned rocks
were recovered from the upper 40cm. Four possible burned rocks and piece of wood came from the level
below. The test was to a depth of 90cm and recovered no clear artifacts below 40cm.
Immediately upstream from the midden are five discrete concentrations of burned rock each not more
than a meter across. Since the rocks are mostly buried, they could be isolated exposures of one large
burned rock midden or several smaller middens, or even individual hearths. These features were first
noticed during a 2009 reconnaissance and their locations were marked with a GPS. They were not shovel
tested so their horizontal and vertical extent beneath the surface is unknown. At present, the site is
assessed as potentially eligible for formal designation as an SAL.

This small lithic scatter is located 175 meters north of the south property line fence and 290 meters east of
the entrance road to the Grelle Park. The artifacts - four late stage biface fragments and approximately 20
pieces of chert debitage - were found on the surface within a clearing situated near the top of a lobe. The
lobe is positioned on the lower slope of a narrow V-shaped valley of a dry tributary creek located some
distance to the east. A woods of cedar and oak surround the clearing, however these are not as dense as
the cedar breaks that grow on the upper valley slope. A shovel test placed two meters southeast of the
lithic scatter encountered no real soil zone, only the gravelly substrate that covers the lower valley slope.
Considering the small area covered by the artifact scatter, about three square meters, the site could
represent a single event situation where one to several people were repairing or finishing bifacial tools.
Additional testing would probably be unproductive and the site is considered fully recorded. The site is
not eligible for formal designation as an SAL.

41BT394
This prehistoric campsite is located on a low terrace inside a sharp bend of Little Cypress Creek (Figure
26). As with the other terrace sites in the GRA, it was recorded during a period of low lake levels and it
is normally 13 to 19 feet below the normal conservation pool of Lake Travis. Two possible hearths, each
roughly one meter in diameter, were found on ground surface in the west half of the site (Figure 27).
Other potential features seen on ground surface are all located on the eastern half of the site. These
included a mussel shell concentration that measured about 2x3 meters, a burned rock concentration that

71

Figure 26. Shovel Testing at 41BT394, looking east.
measured 3x10 meters, a second burned rock concentration that covered a 3x7 meter area, and a burned
rock midden on the southeast edge of the shoreline that measured 8 meters in length and about 20 cm in
thickness.
Artifacts that were collected from the surface of the site consisted of seven bifaces and one dart point of
the Frio type (Figure 28, Figure 29, Table 13). Five shovel tests were also excavated in the western half
of the site. These tests were generally dug to depths of 60 cm below ground surface (bs) in the grayishbrown clay deposits. Chert debitage, one unidentified dart point, and burned rocks were recovered in the
upper 20 to 40 cm of these tests, and it is uncertain whether other more deeply buried prehistoric
components are present. All shovel tests were excavated in the western half of the site on a higher terrace
landform. No shovel tests could be excavated in the lower terrace that constitutes the eastern half of the
site because the water table lies just below ground surface.
Based on presence of features and some potential for buried deposits, the site is assessed as potentially
eligible for formal designation as an SAL.

This is another low terrace prehistoric campsite with burned rock features recorded in 2005 when lake
levels were low due to drought (Figure 30). It lies a short distance downstream from 41BT394 on the
north or left bank of Little Cypress Creek immediately east of the Grelle Homestead (41BT166). The
site was first recorded by Archeology Services in January, 2006 when the lake level was at 664 feet amsl
when only a small area of the site, approximately 20 by 5 meters, was exposed along shoreline. Two
burned rock features were observed, both probably representing dispersed hearths. Feature 1 is a circular
cluster of burned rock two meters in diameter. Feature 2 is a scatter of burned and unburned rocks with
on core covering an area of two by three meters.
The site was briefly revisited in May and June, 2006 when the lake had dropped to 659 feet amsl. A
much larger area of the site was then exposed, approximately 140 meters long and 30 meters wide. Two
areas (Area A and Area B) containing moderate amounts of scattered burned rocks and debitage were
noted. Area A contains the burned rock features recorded earlier and is separated from Area B, which lies
downstream, by an artifact gap of 40 meters.
The site was found to extend another 100 meters to the north where a left tributary creek to Little Cypress
Creek forms an inlet when the lake level drops to around 660 feet amsl. Cultural material is made up of
scattered burned rocks and lithics in low densities. A Nolan (or possibly a Travis) point along with a
Stage 2 biface were found 14 meters apart on low rock outcrops north of Area B.
The 41BT395 deposits appear deflated and somewhat dispersed by wave action. Presumably most of the
lighter artifacts have washed away. However this needs to be verified through shovel testing before any
assessment on SAL eligibility can be made.

41BT396
This prehistoric campsite is located on a low terrace west of the mouth of Little Cypress Creek in an area
that is usually inundated by Lake Travis. The site appears to extend westwards along the north side a
small tributary creek from its confluence with Little Cypress Creek. Lake levels were steadily dropping
at the time of the survey and little if any vegetation had begun to grow on the exposed lake bottom. Even
with excellent visibility, artifacts appeared few and those that were present - cores, large flakes, and a few
scattered fire-cracked rock – were generally heavy and therefore less likely to have been washed away by
waves. This site has been clearly affected by wave action which has removed the finer constituents of the
soil along with lighter cultural material.
Four rock clusters were seen along the shoreline. Some or all of these features might represent hearths or
ovens. Only one of these features, though, had associated artifacts. It is a concentration of burned and
unburned rock covering a two by five meter area near the center of the site. One core, one core or large
chunk of chert, and several flakes were seen within ten meters of the feature.
The surface and upper 30cm of the site has been severely disturbed by waves. Buried cultural deposits
might be present however none are exposed in the cutbank and finding them would require trenching or
other method of deep testing. At present, the SAL status of this site is uncertain.

41BT397
This prehistoric campsite occupies the two lower terraces fronting the Colorado River channel
downstream from the confluence with Little Cypress Creek (Figure 31). The lower terrace contains a
major Toyah phase component with ceramics and bison bone. Late Archaic and probably more Toyah
artifacts are scattered on the upper terrace along with both dispersed and partially intact stone hearths.
Lying at an elevation of between 668 and 642 ft amsl, the site has usually been submerged by the waters
of Lake Travis since 1941.
The site area falls within the easternmost row of the grid that J. Charles Kelly (1940) laid out on August
Grelle’s field between Little Cypress Creek on the west and the Colorado River on the east. While nearly
all of Kelly’s excavations were done within the western grids facing the creek he did do one test
excavation (Test 1) on the highest point of the second (40 ft) terrace fronting the river (see Figure 9).
Kelly intended this to be a deep test pit and planned to excavate down to 15 feet. He found some
scattered burned rock between four and five feet below the surface but no intact hearths. Artifacts were
few (N=40) considering the size of the excavation area, a square 30 ft on a side. No cultural material was
found below the burned rock scatter down to a depth of 10 feet where the test ended.
While Kelly was aware of prehistoric artifacts on the river-facing terraces, there is no mention in his letter
reports of the presence of bison bone and ceramics in this area and it can be presumed that this material
was still buried under sediments at that time. He makes a point of stating that the only aboriginal
ceramics and arrow points were excavated from Area 9 on the creek (see Figure 9).
41BT397 was first recorded by Archeology Services staff in December, 2005 when the lake had dropped
to approximately to 665 ft amsl because of drought. At that time only the upper terrace surface was above
water. Six concentrations of fire-cracked limestone rocks were recorded on the exposed terrace edge and
upper slope along a 130 meter stretch, in addition to scattered debitage. Two shovel tests placed on the
terrace surface (ST1 and ST2) reached depths of 60 and 80 cm respectively in the brown silty clay loam
that capped the terrace. The only artifact recovered was a chert flake fragment from the near the surface
78

in ST2 from loose sediments thought to be recent. Obviously there is a surface component on the upper
terrace since burned rocks are scattered on it and probably buried components as well but these do not
appear to be concentrated and none are clearly exposed in the terrace slope. In addition two hearths
(Features 2 and 3) were seen at the northern end of the exposed terrace.
Archeology Services staff visited the site several occasions in October, 2007 when the lake had dropped
to an elevation of 645 feet amsl exposing the entire surface of the lower terrace along with the upper slope
of terrace (Figure 32). A scatter of large animal bones was recorded along the lower terrace edge
stretching for a distance of 200 meters (Figure 31, Table 15). Nearly all the bone came from cow-sized
animals and some exhibited green-break fractures. A cluster of burned rocks (Feature 1) with
considerable amounts of what appeared to be charcoal was seen in the area with the highest concentration
of bone (Figure 33).
Few artifacts were found in association with the bone; these included four flakes, an informal unifacial
tool, and a bone-tempered potsherd (Figure 34, far left). The latter artifact is only one that is timesensitive and tentatively places the bone accumulations to the Toyah phase.
The bones and other material appeared to be eroding from the slope immediately below the lower terrace
edge. A 30cm auger attached to a skid steer was used to excavate two subsurface test (ST 3 and 4) on the
surface of the terrace immediately back from the terrace edge in hopes of encountering the buried
component containing the bones. Both tests reached a depth of 110cm but the only cultural material
recovered came from ST 3 which was placed near Feature 1. These were a small bone fragment and a
piece of charcoal from between 60 and 70cm hinting that a component could be buried in the lower
terrace. Soon after, the entire site was again inundated after heavy rains, halting plans for further testing.
The site was next visited by Archeology Services staff in March of 2009 when lake levels dropped to the
point of exposing the upper terrace and a small strip of the lower terrace at the base of the upper terrace
slope. A careful inspection of the lower terrace surface resulted in the recovery of 22 prehistoric ceramic
sherds (see Figure 31) amid the burned rocks and debitage that had washed down from the edge of the
upper terrace. Presumably the sherds had also washed down from the upper terrace although it cannot be
ruled out that they originated from the lower terrace. In any case, a majority of the sherds (N=18) came
from two adjacent groupings (Sherd Group 1 and Sherd Group 2) near the north end of the site (Figure
35). The sherds from these two groups appear to be from the same vessel because all are relatively thin,
smoothed on both sides, and smudged black. Four isolated sherds (IS1 through 4) were found along the
same base of the second terrace slope but further downstream. These appear to be from one or more
vessels with thicker walls than the vessel represented by the sherd groups. Two salt-glazed stoneware
sherds were noted on the surface near the sherd groups.
As far as we could tell by examining the prehistoric sherds with a microscope, they all appear to be
abundantly tempered with crushed limestone, quartz sand, and perhaps bone, although no example of the
latter was positively identified.
A return visit was made by Archeology Services in August of 2009 after the lake had further dropped to
634 ft. Because of the length of time of exposure, a thick carpet of vegetation had grown up over the sites
cutting off all visibility of the surface except on steeper portions of the terrace slopes. To determine if the
Toyah ceramics were originating from upper terrace surface, three shovel tests (ST 5-8) were placed on
the slope of the upper terrace immediately above and slightly downstream from the sherd groups. While
all the tests recovered pieces of debitage, only the one placed near the base of the slope recovered
aboriginal ceramics (N=1) so the findings were inconclusive. This sherd could have come from either the
upper or lower terrace. The presence of prehistoric ceramics, which are possibly associated with the
bones, suggest the bison kill took place sometime between AD 1300 and AD1650 or latter.

Figure 32. Site 41BT397 looking north showing scattered bones eroding from lower terrace slope.

During the same visit the Feature 1 hearth was relocated and more large animal bone found in the area
immediately upstream from this feature. Two sacrums and other bones were found partially buried in the
lower terrace edge. Careful toweling around the bones revealed articulated bones buried in the sediment
below the ones that were already exposed. Realizing that a larger scale excavation was needed, the
location was marked with a GPS unit and a metal post was erected nearby as a datum to relocate the
bones for future recovery.
Site 41BT397 is potentially one of the most important in the GRA. A Toyah Phase component contains
the remains of butchered and processed bison still buried in the upper sediments of the lower terrace.
There is a good probability that partially articulated bison skeletial material is present, too. The site is
rated as eligible for formal SAL designation.

41BT398
Site 41BT398, a prehistoric lithic scatter or possible campsite, is located 350 meters north northwest of
the Grelle Homestead site between two branches of a small left tributary of Little Cypress Creek. These
branches descend at a steep gradient from the ridges 70 meters northwest of the site and probably only
retain water after heavy rains. The site lies slightly above the historic lake level average of 668.97 feet
amsl and has suffered the effects of wave action. Little if any of the upper soil zone is present, leaving a
deflated surface of redeposited sand over a silty clay subsoil.
Artifact density is low and includes one thick chert biface, one thin chert biface or dart point fragment, ten
pieces of chert debitage, and three chert cores. Some scattered fire-cracked rocks are also present. As
stated above, this material lies on the deflated surface of the near-shore lake bottom and has been locally
transported by wave action. The chert flakes are generally large and heavy. Any lighter artifacts have
probably been washed away. A shovel Test (ST1) recovered three pieces of debitage in the redeposited
sands (Table 16).
Research value of this site is low due to the disturbances caused by wave action. The site is assessed as
not eligible for SAL designation.

41BT399
During an inventory survey in December, 2005, Archeology Services staff discovered a cache of large
chert flakes in the dirt road leading to the Grelle homestead (Figure 36). There is no obvious way of
knowing when the cache was deposited and it could represent a modern “collector’s pile.” The nearest
archeological site is 41BT167, a lithic procurement area 300 meters to the southeast.
86

The cache is made up of about 20 chert flakes scattered within a 80cm diameter area. Most of the flakes
were completely exposed on the surface at the time of the survey although a few were partially buried. A
core and early stage biface lay within a meter of the cache. No other artifacts were seen in the immediate
area.
The site is assessed as not SAL eligible since it has little potential to yield additional information.

Figure 36. Flake cache at 41BT399 with 30cm ruler for scale.

41BT400
Site 41BT400 is located on a ridge 350 meters west of Little Cypress Creek (Figure 37). The east end of
the ridge top is capped by Pleistocene-age gravels of chert and quartzite within a sandy soil supporting
wooded area consisting of oaks and cedar.
The cultural material at this site is similar to the other ridge top sites (41BT159, 41BT162, and 41BT167)
in that it mostly derives from prehistoric lithic procurement activities. While the surface of the ridge is
strewn with cobbles, especially near its eastern “point” end, actual surface artifacts are rare. A few flakes
and cores or tested cobbles were noted as well as one granite mano. Shovel Test 1, placed near the site’s
east end had by far the greatest artifact recovery (Table 17). The other shovel tests placed further up the
spine of the ridge had no recovery.
The site appears to be confined to the extreme east end of the ridge top, covering a much smaller area
than other sites on similar landforms in the GRA. Since the site is mostly buried, additional testing is
needed to determine the nature and research potential of its deposits. At present, the SAL status of this
site is uncertain.

41BT441
41BT441 is a lithic scatter located in the northwest corner of the GRA at the base of a limestone hill.
Archeology Services staff discovered the site during a 2007 water pipeline survey that ran along the
northern boundary of the park. Since the site lay outside the pipeline route, it was not formally recorded
at the time, however a proximal fragment of a possible Angostura point was collected (Table 18). The
hafting element is slightly constricting and the lateral edges are ground. In addition to the point, a light
scatter of debitage was noted along the west property fence.
Since nearly all the artifacts lie along the property fence, the site area probably continues to the west onto
the adjacent private property. The portion of the site on LCRA property appears to be confined to the
surface with little chance of buried deposits because of the thin soil cover. Site 41BT422 is fully recorded
east of the property fence and is not considered eligible for SAL designation.

41BT442
This is a prehistoric terrace campsite located on the east edge of the GRA on an unnamed tributary creek
upstream from its confluence with the Colorado River (Figure 38). It lies at an elevation of between 650
and 670 feet amsl and, as with the other GRA terrace sites, is usually inundated by Lake Travis. A small
corner of the northeast site area is on private property. The site is separated from the larger 41BT397 to
the north by a 20 meter-wide section of the terrace containing a few displaced burned rocks.

Figure 38. Aerial map of 41BT442, showing features and shovel test locations; park boundary shown in blue.

90

The eastern edge of 41BT442 ends at the cutbank to the creek which is eroding laterally to the west
(Figure 39). A cluster of several burned rocks (Hearth 1) is exposed in the cutbank one meter below the
terrace surface. Many more burned rocks lie at the base of the cutbank, presumably haven fallen from the
feature. A shovel test (ST 1) placed on the terrace surface three meters west of Hearth 1 recovered one
burned rock and a burned chert flake at about 50cm, perhaps at too high an elevation to be in the same
component as the hearth. A second shovel test (ST2) was placed on the terrace edge above a second
scatter of burned rock (Hearth 2) resting at the base of the cutbank. This test recovered two flakes
between 20 and 55cm and a mussel shell half at 62cm.

Figure 39. Cutbank at 41BT442 looking northeast showing burned rocks at base of slope.

An inlet or slough forms the south edge of the site while the northern boundary is the artifact gap
separating it from 41BT397. A shovel test (ST3) placed nine meters west of the cut bank recovered one
flake between 0 and 20cm, no artifacts between 20 and 40cm, and one small flake at 55cm. No artifacts
were recovered from 55 down to 80cm where the test ended. The presumably continues to the west an
unknown distance.
Site 41BT442 appears to have good integrity in that cultural material, including parts of at least one
hearth, is buried well below the plow zone. The site is assessed as eligible for SAL designation.

Summary
Terrace sites
Eight sites have been recorded on the stream terraces within the GRA. All lie below the Lake Travis
conservation pool level of 681 feet amsl. Some of the lower lying sites have been submerged for periods
lasting as long as 19 years. It appears that those sites (or areas of sites) lying an elevation closest to the
historic average lake level of 668.9 feet amsl have suffered the most from erosion and dispersal of site
deposits. These affects are worst on shorelines facing the open lake, such as 41BT396, the upper terrace
of 41BT397, and all of 41BT398 while those sites further up the Little Cypress Creek estuary, such as
41BT345, 41BT392, and 41BT394 seem better preserved.
Kelly (1941d) defined two alluvial surfaces consisting of a higher terrace which he called the “40 foot”
terrace and a lower alluvial surface which he called the “20 foot” terrace. Two principal alluvial fills are
present in these Holocene terraces at Grelle, a reddish silty clay lower unit and a darker silty clay upper
unit. Kelly (1941d) first recognized these two units in his “40 foot” terrace at 41BT1: a one to four foot
thick surface stratum composed of “black humic silts” over a second, more ancient stratum 27 feet or
more thick composed of “red clay silts.” Kelly saw an erosional unconformity or “disconformity”
between the two units meaning that a period of erosion had removed the upper portion of the red silts
before deposition of the black humic materia commenced. Therefore, a gap in the stratigraphic sequence
exists in alluvial terraces at Grelle. Kelly’s “20 foot” terrace on the creek was found to be mostly
composed of the black humic silts.
The majority – or at least the densest cultural material – in the 40 foot terrace was found in the upper
alluvial fill. Three components or layers with scattered burned rock and hearths were recorded in the
black humic silts, merging together in places and a third prehistoric component was found at the contact
zone between the two alluvial units. Below this level in the red silts, cultural material was considered
sparse but continued to be found down to a depth of 24 feet. From this level down to the contact zone
between the red clay silts and shale bedrock, no artifacts were found.
The 20 foot terrace also contained considerable prehistoric cultural material. Kelly thought this material
had originated from the 40 foot terrace and was subsequently redeposited on the lower terrace. The 20
foot terrace or its equivalent on the Colorado River was apparently not investigated by Kelly. This river
terrace appears substantially wider than the 20 foot terrace on the Little Cypress Creek.
Further up Little Cypress Creek, the upper, dark alluvial unit begins to thin out. At 41BT392, it is only
about 18 to 24cm thick over the red silty clay. Eventually further upstream on the creek the red silty clay
should break to the surface as it does at the LCRA’s Double Horn Resource Area above the GRA on Lake
Travis (Prikryl et al 2004).
These two alluvial fills are seen in other Colorado River terraces around Lake Travis and further
upstream. They were encountered during a 2001 excavation of two-by-two meter test unit at 41BT37 on
Double Horn Creek (Prikryl et al. 2004). In this unit, the sediments from the surface down to a depth of
170 to 180 cm have a brownish hue and may correspond to the Qal-1 Late Holocene fill described by
Blum and Lintz (1993) much further upstream at the O. H. Ivie Reservoir. The Qal-1 fill at O. H. Ivie
built up between 2500 BC and AD 950. Below this fill in the test pit profile at 41BT37, the color of the
sediments changes markedly to a reddish hue, and may correspond to the upper portion of Blum and
Lintz’s (1993) Qal-2 Early to Middle Holocene fill, deposited from roughly 8000 to 3000 BC. The
vertical positions of the dateable artifacts appear to support this interpretation although excavation deeper
into the Qal-2 zone will be needed for its verification. Surface observations and shovel test profiles from
work at the Double Horn Resource Area indicate that the top of Qal-2 zone rises as one goes away from
92

the river channel, eventually breaking to the surface on the east side of 41BT36, about 800 meters west of
the Colorado River Channel.
Burned Rock Middens
All the recorded burned rock middens in the GRA are found on the terraces of Little Cypress Creek
immediately upstream from its confluence with the Colorado River (Figure 40). In contrast, no middens
have been recorded on the terraces facing the river although burned rock pavements probably representing
deflated ovens are present. Middens appear to be absent as well from the upland margins and upland
areas of the GRA where burned rock features such as hearths are rare.
The GRA middens take the form of relatively thin stratums of burned rock, either exposed on terrace
surfaces or buried in sediments. Buried middens are thought to have higher research value compared to
middens that formed on stable, non-aggrading surfaces because of a higher degree of organic
preservation, structural integrity, and stratified deposits (Black et al. 1997).
The burned rock deposits that make up the buried midden at 41BT392 are unusually thin – 10cm in
thickness – and could be an example of a sheet midden (Young 1985). The behaviors that produced such
middens are unknown although some have proposed they are “incipient middens” more or less formed by
the same earth oven use as other midden types.
Ridge top sites
Large prehistoric sites are found on the ridges that fringe the valley edge of the Colorado River. The
ridges rise about 70 to 80 feet above the banks of the creek and river and are covered by cedar breaks.
Pleistocene-age gravels of flint and quartzite cap the ridges, imbedded in a loose, sandy soil. These sites
were used primarily for lithic procurement.
Considering the age and composition of the soils, it is surprising that they contain substantial amounts of
buried prehistoric cultural material. While some small artifacts such as debitage could be worked into the
gravels through bioturbation, it is more difficult to explain a feature such as the possible hearth buried
43cm in the gravels in 41BT162. This feature also contains metate and mano fragments.
Considerable disturbances must have taken place at 41BT162 and the other ridge top sites to bury such
large objects, disturbances beyond the usual natural processes such as root growth and animal burrowing.
Early historic land clearing – for which there is little evidence – or prehistoric pit digging must be
considered. Possibly, earth ovens were dug into the gravels on occasion, the advantage being that such
pits would not have to lined with rocks carried in from elsewhere. Such activity would also explain the
large amounts of burned gravels in the sediments capping the ridges at Grelle and at other Lake Travis
parks such as Shaffer Bend. The main drawback to digging baking pits into the gravels is that the flint
shatters when exposed to fire which could get into the food being cooked.
Other sites
Sites not found on the terraces or ridge tops tend to be few and widely scattered. These include the Grelle
Homestead (41BT166) and the Wallace House (41BT158) Occupation began at the Grelle Homestead
site in 1892 continued until around 1940 when the land was sold to the LCRA. The dates of the Wallace
site occupation are not as precisely known but the artifact assemble places it in the late 19th century and
perhaps continuing into the first decade of the 20th century,

Three small lithic scatters have been recorded in the upland margins. These sites have a high tool to
debitage ratio and are not located in areas where good-quality flint occurs. The artifacts were probably
discarded after being used to perform certain tasks involving extraction of resources located away from
the terrace campsites. Two of the three lithic scatters contain projectile points, so hunting was commonly
carried out into area unless the points were recycled for other purposes.
A fourth small lithic scatter and a mixed-use site are located in the uplands on the eastern perimeter fence.
Probably only a small portion of each site is on GRA side of the fence and it is possible that both sites
merge together on the private property to the east.

Management priorities
The terrace sites at Grelle contain potentially significant archaeological information and should be
preserved. Since these sites lie below the normal pool of the lake, they will probably not be threatened by
park development. Obviously, any dredging of the Little Cypress Creek estuary is to be avoided. As long
94

as lake levels are high, the sites are, for the most part, safe from artificial impacts other than boat
propellers.
Concerns develop when lake levels drop below the 670-foot elevation allowing park visitors to drive onto
the exposed lake bottom to fish or launch boats (Figure 41). In the past this has caused deep ruts and
damaged the shallowly buried middens. Possible measures might include temporary barriers or covering
sensitive areas with some sort of protective covering. An area away from the archaeological sites could
be designated for launching boats.

Figure 41. Vehicle tire ruts at 41BT345.

The large upland margin sites are located on overlooks that could see development such as cabins and
other park buildings. Much of the survey work on the upland margins reported in this document has not
been intensive survey level investigation. Before any construction begins, proposed construction and
development areas will need to be more thoroughly investigated. Otherwise, these upland margin sites do
not seem to be threatened and no looting has been reported, probably because these sites are not very
visible.
In 2008, LCRA sold the northwestern portion of the Grelle Recreation Area to a private party in order to
increase the amount of funding available to purchase future LCRA park properties in other parts of the
LCRA service area. That land sale included all portions of the Grelle Recreation Area above the 670 ft
msl contour north and west of the Little Cypress Creek channel. Cultural resource sites that were
included in that land sale consisted of 41BT162, 41BT166, 41BT167, portions of 41BT396, 41BT398,
41BT399, 41BT400, and 41BT441. None of these had been formally designated as SALs prior to the
land sale so no restrictions were placed on the new landowner’s use of the areas containing these sites.

Introduction and Management Summary
On January 6, 21, and 22, 2010, LCRA Archaeology Services staff conducted a cultural resource
assessment of two tracts of land located within the Fayette Power Project (FPP); Borrow Area 3 covering
approximately 13 acres, and Borrow Area 4 covering approximately 14 acres (Figure 42). The land is
being prospected for suitability as a borrow area for clay suitable to cap an existing ash pond (a
previously excavated area in which coal byproducts are placed. The cap has to meet certain permeability
and other requirements. In order to determine such suitability, LCRA hired consulting firms to conduct
geotechnical investigations. These investigations consisted of a series of small backhoe trenches and
geotechnical bores. In order to facilitate the archaeological investigations, it was decided to monitor
select backhoe trenches as an addition to standard pedestrian survey.
The property in question has been partially impacted by past borrow activities, most likely in the mid to
late 1980s. Internal maps and files indicate that much, if not all of the proposed borrow areas were
previously surveyed. However, due to a lack of clear documentation, it was determined that the land
should be evaluated. Work was conducted under LCRA’s Blanket Antiquities Permit # 5141 and in
accordance with guidelines as established by the Council of Texas Archeologists.
As a result of the investigations, two new archaeological sites, 41FY558 and 41FY559, were recorded and
sites 41FY470 and 41FY4375 were revisited (Figure 43). Site 41FY470 is not in the project area and
there was no evidence of 41FY475. Site 41FY558 is a diffuse lithic procurement scatter in light gravels
located in Borrow Area 3. One isolated thick biface, determined to be a likely gouge, was present, as was
a single piece of blue featheredge ceramic and a whiteware ceramic sherd. These historic artifacts are
most probably outliers from the nearby Biegel House site (41FY94). 41FY559 is a lithic scatter located
on the southwest edge of Borrow Area 4. The site area appears to extend southwards away from the
project area.
The vast majority of both areas have very thin to no topsoil over clay. The highest elevations have a
coarse sandy organic loam to a depth of no more than 20 cm. The portions of 41FY558 and 41FY559
within the project area are considered fully recorded and ineligible for formal listing as State
Archeological Landmarks.
No artifacts were collected and no curation will be necessary. It is recommended the project be allowed
to proceed.

Natural Setting
The project area is located near the juncture of the Post Oak Savannah and Blackland Prairie in mapped
Post Oak Woods, Forest, and Grassland Mosaic and Cropland (McMahon et al. 1984). Soils are mapped
as Vernia series soils, described as loose gravelly sands over sandy clay loams in excess of 70 in in depth
(SCS 1974). These soils developed in the Miocene Era Oakville Sandstone Formation which consists of
sandstone and clay to a thickness of 500 ft, and very near the Early Pleistocene Willis Formation,
consisting of sands and gravels with silts and clay to a depth of 100 ft (Barnes 1974). Baylor Creek, a
minor right bank tributary of the Colorado River, drains the area. Observed conditions were of grassland
and woods in highly eroded clay or gravelly clay soils (Figure 44).

Culture History
The project area is considered to be in the central Texas archeological region (Ellis et al. 1995). Central
Texas prehistory has typically been divided into four main subdivisions, known variably as eras or
periods, which are subdivided further into phases or subperiods. These subdivisions combine to begin to
describe 11,500 years of history. A longstanding chronology of Prewitt (1981, 1985), has recently been
revised by Johnson and Goode (1994) and Johnson (1995), who utilized new lines of evidence based on
climatic and geomorphological data to redefine period divisions. This can be contrasted with Collins
(1995), who indicates climatic variables at times were somewhat different than those of Johnson and
Goode. The ultimate goal of many modern archaeologists is to transcend the culture history of an area
and attempt to explain why change occurred in various cultures and regions. To this end carefully revised
chronologies are to be expected and encouraged.
The prehistoric chronology used in this report follows that presented in Johnson and Goode (1994) and
generalized by Collins (1995) in years before present (B.P.).
Paleoindian period: 11,500
Early Archaic period: 8,800
Middle Archaic period: 6,000
Late Archaic I period: 4,000
Late Archaic II period: 2,600

The region now known as Fayette County was first crossed by the Spanish in the early eighteenth century
(Garrett 2001). Stephen F. Austin’s colonists arrived in 1822 and initiated settlement, particularly near an
important road crossing located near present day La Grange. In 1837 the county of Fayette was
established, named after the Marquis de Lafayette, with La Grange made the county seat. Early industry
was based on farms and plantations, which focused on production of corn, tobacco, wool and cotton.
Slavery became a mainstay of the economy, even as the county voted against secession. After the civil
war the plantation economy collapsed, and share cropping became common. German and Slavic
immigrants increased during the decades surrounding the 1870s, and former plantation owners sold large
plots which were subsequently subdivided to newcomers. Germans and Czechs became strong social
forces around the turn of the century. Cotton was the predominant cash crop through the Depression, but
by the end of World War II cattle became more important. Oil was discovered in the county in 1943,
which led to a new shift in industry. The LCRA’s Fayette Power Project is now the largest employer in
the county.
Previous Investigations
The construction of the Fayette Power Project, along with cooling reservoirs and coal prospects resulted
in several large-scale and other archaeological projects during the 1970s and 1980s (e. g. Jackson and
Skelton 1975, Carter and Ragsdale 1976, Skelton 1977, Nightengale 1983, Nightengale and Jackson
1983, Nightengale et al. 1985). These investigations resulted in numerous historic and prehistoric sites
being recorded. Prehistoric sites included lithic scatters and procurement sites, open campsites, and at
least one single event butchering event locale within an upland hunting camp and tool manufacturing site
(Skelton 1977:29-55). Historic sites included numerous homesteads and associated buildings, as well as
burials and cemeteries, in particular one associated with the Biegel Community (Carter and Ragsdale
1976) which was relocated in advance of proposed reservoir construction on Cedar Creek (Nightengale
1983:9).
102

In 1983 by Bruce Nightengale surveyed an area as part of the assessment of the proposed ash disposal
area for the power plant. Eight sites were either revisited or recorded for the first time. These again were
a mixture of historic and prehistoric sites. Historic sites consisted of a possible human burial, later
determined to be a simple rock cairn (Nightengale 1983:7), a sugar cane press probably later destroyed
(Nightengale 1983:8), and a house of 1880s construction. Prehistoric sites included two lithic scatters and
or/procurement areas. One open campsite, 41FY53782, was also recorded to the south of the project area,
but apparently received no additional levels of investigation (Skelton 1977). In 2001, a road reroute area
was surveyed by LCRA (Malof et. al 2003:280). One buried lithic scatter, 41FY537, was recorded at that
time. It was considered ineligible for formal SAL listing.

Figure 44. Project setting.

While researching previous investigations for the present project, internal LCRA files were located that
indicated that several hundred acres of proposed borrow areas had been surveyed between about 1985 and
1989. Various maps showed where borrow areas were proposed, and short letter reports requesting
clearance were present. There were few accompanying figures however, so it remained unclear what had
actually been surveyed. In 1992, Bruce Nightengale developed a proposal to systematically survey the
remainder of the LCRA-owned Baylor Creek watershed. He produced a map of all areas previously
surveyed up to that time, which included the present project area. However, as it could not conclusively
demonstrated through documentation that the area had been surveyed, it was felt prudent to double check.
Nightengale’s figure is recreated here, with other, more recent projects added, to improve accessibility of
information (Figure 49, Table 19 in Appendix 1). Areas shown as unsurveyed should be considered as
such unless other projects can be demonstrated to have occurred. Areas shown as surveyed should be
considered on a case by case basis, and may require revisits dependent on the type of project, especially
considering the less intensive survey methods often used at the time. Sites within surveyed areas may
still require avoidance or other measures (such as 41FY469) and should be assessed on a project by
project basis.
Research Design and Methods
The field investigations were designed to identify any possible cultural resource sites within the project
area and to assess their potential eligibility for formal listing as State Archeological Landmarks. Survey
was conducted by systematic pedestrian transects with examination of the ground surface and exposures.
The survey was augmented by the excavation of two backhoe trenches and two shovel tests in Borrow

103

Area 3 and seven backhoe trenches in Borrow Area 4 (see Figure 43). Due to the nature of the soils and
lack of artifacts, backhoe trenches were recorded at a gross, generalized level. No profiles were drawn.
Results of Investigations
Borrow Area 3
Borrow Area 3 is located on the sloping divide between between Baylor Creek and a short, left bank
tributary. It is entirely within open pasture with spotty grass coverage affording excellent visibility. Soils
were pale gray of light grayish brown silty loams or else eroded to gravelly clay (Figure 45).
Two backhoe trenches were monitored, after which the backhoe developed mechanical problems (Figure
46). Two shovel tests were subsequently excavated. Given the shallow nature of the soils and the overall
good visibility this is considered sufficient.
One previously unrecorded archaeological site, 41FY558, was recorded in Borrow Area 3 as a result of
the investigations. This is a light lithic scatter containing procurement-related materials within a light
scatter of gravels. One biface with gouge-like characteristics was seen. Also seen was a fragment of blue
featheredge ceramic and a whiteware sherd. There was no immediate nearby evidence of a source for
these historic materials, and they are considered to be part of a scatter associated with 41FY94, located
well outside the project area to the south. Two backhoe trenches and two shovel test confirmed that soils
were very shallow over clays.
Because there is no potential for additional, buried deposits to be present within the project area, site
41FY558 is considered to be fully documented and not eligible for formal listing as a State Archeological
Landmark. It is recommended the project be allowed to proceed.

Borrow Area 4
Borrow Area 4 is located on the crest and west facing slopes of a moderate hill overlooking Cummins
Creek. Its general description is very similar to Borrow Area 3, with shallow, gravely soils over clay.
Unlike Borrow Area 3, however, it has two minor drainages that can be seen on the USGS maps as slight
“nicks” in the contour lines that can be extended into the project area. Both these drainages were incised
to clay subsoils. Elsewhere, visibility was fair to excellent.
Seven of approximately 12 planned backhoe trenches were monitored. The monitored trenches were
selected in order to provide as much diversity and coverage as possible. As in Borrow Area 3, topsoils
were generally shallow, although more variable in color and texture and occasionally up to 40 or 50 cm in
thickness.
One new prehistoric archaeological site, 41FY559 was recorded in Borrow Area 4. Site 41FY559 is a
previously unrecorded lithic scatter located on the west edge of Borrow Area 4 where a dense woods of
cedar and oak meets a terraced field. Three cores and four pieces of chert debitage were found on eroded
surfaces a few meters with the woods. No subsurface testing was done but a careful inspection of the
walls and bottom of a three-foot-deep gully immediately north of the artifact scatter found no cultural
material. Considering the lack of artifacts in the gully and absence of artifacts on the surface of the field
north of the woods, it does not appear that 41FY559 extends into Borrow Area 4. The site may extend
southwards into the woods and away from the project area. The site’s SAL eligibility is undetermined but
it should not be impacted by the project.
A previously recorded site, 41FY470, is plotted on the TARL maps 60 meters west of the southwest
corner of Borrow Area 4. The subsurface extent of this potentially significant prehistoric site was never
established during previous surveys. During this project, no artifacts were seen on the surface of the
project area nearest 41FY470 and none were seen in the backhoe trench (BHT 415) placed in this area.
41FY470 does not appear to extend into Borrow Area 4.
The boundaries of a second previously recorded site, 41FY475, overlap the northwestern quadrant of
Borrow Area 4. It was originally recorded as a lithic procurement site and not considered significant.
The original recorders thought that the historic December house (41FY93), since moved to another
location, was originally plotted within the boundaries of 41FY475. They assessed the Historic
component as potentially significant although they were uncertain of its location. For this project,
Archeology Services staff walked a series of transects across the 41FY475 area in Borrow Area 4 and
found a total of two flakes. Two backhoe trenches were also dug in this area, without uncovering any
cultural material. The nearly total lack of artifacts in this part of Borrow Area 4 possibly means that
41FY475 is located further to the east than currently plotted.

Summary and Recommendations
LCRA proposes to excavate clay material from two areas within its Fayette Power Project totaling about
27 acres in size. The material is necessary to close out an existing ash disposal pit located elsewhere on
the property. Because the fill material must meet certain permeability and other requirements,
geotechnical prospecting in the form of backhoe trenching was included as an aspect of the archaeological
survey.
Nine backhoe trenches were monitored, and two shovel tests were excavated. Fourteen shovel tests are
suggested for a project of this side. Regardless of whether the larger size of the backhoe trenches is a

106

substitute for additional shovel tests, given the high visibility, generally eroded nature of the ground
surface and shallow soils, this number is considered sufficient.
One archaeological site was recorded within the project area, and another was seen and recorded outside
the project area. Site 41FY558 is a light scatter of lithic materials reflective of early stage reduction and
procurement. A gouge-like
like biface was also present. Two sherds of white stoneware, one a rim section
with blue featheredge decoration were also seen. Two shovel tests within the site wand two nearby
backhoe trenches, along with surface examination, confirmed there is no depth and no potential for buried
components. The site is considered fully recorded and ineligible for formal listing as a State
Archeological Landmark.

Figure 48. Sketch of 41FY559.

107

Site 41FY559 was light lithic scatter that appeared representative of secondary reduction. There may be
more evidence of this site under dense leaf litter within the heavy woods where it was recorded. Such
wooded areas will not be impacted by the project.
No evidence of previously recorded quarry site 41FY475 was found within the project area. Site
41FY470 was relocated, and it does not extend into areas proposed for borrowing.
It is recommended the project be allowed to proceed in the areas described.

Physical Description
The house at site 41SS176 is a small, three-room, T-plan frame residence of minimal construction that
exhibits elements of various building materials and methods. Field analysis indicates it was built in
phases, possibly utilizing salvaged materials in some sections. The two key components are a squared,
south-facing front portion with a gabled roof on an east-west axis. An ell extension to the rear of the
house is aligned perpendicular to the front axis. It also features a gabled roof, although the ridgeline is
several feet lower than the front portion, tying in along the north side roof slope. Metal valleys along the
intersection lines of the two roofs do not align properly, an indication they were not part of the original
design and that the back portion of the house may have been added at some point using an existing
structure moved to the site.
A masonry chimney once anchored the east side of the home, and evidence of the original limestone
chimney foundation, possibly expanded later in footprint with ashlar-cut sandstone blocks of random size,
now extends beyond the outer frame wall. On the south side of the structure are the partially-collapsed
remains of a triple-bay shed porch that once extended symmetrically across most of the front façade. The
porch, which tied into the house below the roof’s drip line and a milled cornice board, featured turned
wooden posts common in Victorian-era construction. The porch floor, as well as at least the front room, is
comprised of tongue-and-groove flooring, although the main house has a six-inch wide board subfloor.
Evidence of the evolutionary nature of the home can best be seen by an inspection of the interior space,
since the exterior is covered in large part by asphalt-based roll siding. The entry wall, east wall, and part
of the north wall (to its intersection with the entry to the back ell) of the front part of the house feature
balloon framing, with stud walls and clapboard sheathing on half of the southern exterior. The remaining
exterior walls are of both horizontal and vertical board with missing battens. Wallboard at one time
covered the interior space but has since been mostly removed. A box-frame wall of single vertical planks,
with a framed door opening, runs on the east-west axis and divides the interior space of the front portion
asymmetrically. The same type of construction finishes out the remainder of the outside south wall and
the entire length of the west wall. Where the asphalt covering has deteriorated, exposed boards and nail
patterns indicate board-and-batten construction. Although the battens were removed at some point prior to
the application of the asphalt covering, it appears a few of them served as filler material in other parts of
the house. Wire nails are used throughout most of the house, although cut nails could be found in the ell
and along the entirety of the bottom course of the balloon frame construction, and in certain trim elements
such as exterior window and door frames.
In close proximity to the house, and within the channel of Mill Creek, are the elaborate stone remains of
what is believed to be part of the City of San Saba’s original waterworks operation Edmond E. Risien and
several associates set up in the 1870s. The construction of the dam for the waterworks led one of the
partners, J.H. “Shorty” Brown, to file suit against E.E. Risien. Although Risien ultimately prevailed,
Risien soon abandoned the waterworks and his nearby home for a new one outside the town.

Preliminary Historical Background
Information gathered in San Saba through oral history informant research with Mrs. Elsie Millican, a
Risien family descendant, and Mr. Dan Vaughn, a former resident of the house, indicates Edmond E.
Risien (1853-1940) and his wife, Elizabeth (1853-1953), both natives of England, came to the San Saba
County area in the 1870s. Soon after, Edmond Risien and several business partners established the first
water works. Whether or not the Risiens established a house on the property in question prior to the early20th century is not known. Mrs. Millican has stated that the Risiens built and lived in the house currently
on the site. There are no written records that verify Mrs. Millican’s statement, but two other informants

have also said that the Risiens built and lived in the house. The area where the house is located is
sometimes covered with water during floods, and it is possible that the Risiens lived in a different house
that is no longer present on the tract. Also, since the existing house appears to have been modified
several times during its history, it is possible that a portion of the existing house was built and occupied
by the Riesens. In any case, the couple evidently moved to their larger home outside the city sometime
prior to 1909, according to Mrs. Millican. Although the exact date of the Risiens’ sale of the land is not
recorded, the Risiens’ son, E. Guy Risien regained ownership of the property in 1943, and used it as rental
property. Regular occupation of the existing house ceased sometime prior to the 1980s.
At his new home and property, E.E. Risien experimented with the production of native pecans,
developing and improving propagation methods to increase production and introduce new varieties. His
pioneer work in that regard, for which he received federal patents and widespread recognition, directly
influenced the development of San Saba County as a state leader in production of the crop. Following his
death in 1940, his son, E. Guy Risien, continued with the family work and made his own lasting
contributions to the field.

41SS176 House Site: Historical Background and Architectural Description Addendum
Historical Background
Following the earlier preliminary report on the house site at 41SS176, the LCRA contracted with
historian Dan K. Utley to conduct additional archival research on the property and to provide a historical
architectural assessment of the structure. With regard to the latter, Stan Graves, director of the THC’s
Division of Architecture, also visited the site and made some preliminary observations on the evolution of
the building phases that have been incorporated into this addendum. The additional research corroborates
preliminary assessments regarding the history and architectural integrity but also highlights the complex
nature and unavoidable gaps in the overall story of historic occupation and riparian rights related to the
site.
Ownership of the property dates to 1847 and patents of land acquired by brothers Robert Daugherty
McAnelly and Pleasant McAnelly (also shown variously as McAnnally, McAnnelly, McAnally, etc.).
Both came to Texas, then a part of Mexico, in 1835 and participated with the Texan army during the
Siege of Bexar (San Antonio). For their service, the State of Texas set aside land grants for the brothers in
present San Saba County. (Pleasant received Abstract 36; Robert received the adjacent Abstract 37. Both
numbers were subsequently changed.) Their lands were situated on the eastern side of the present San
Saba townsite along a stream initially designated McAnelly Creek, but later known as Mill Creek. Robert
McAnelly acquired his brother’s interest only three years later, adding to his considerable landholdings
that included land in nearby Lampasas County along the Colorado River.
Born in Kentucky in 1806, Robert D. McAnelly worked as a surveyor in Texas, and in the course of his
work he managed to buy up several bounty certificates, eventually acquiring over 3000 acres. He and his
wife, Sarah Jane (Rowe), made their home in Lampasas County along what was known as McAnelly’s
Bend of the Colorado River. Today, the area is known as the Bend Community. There, the McAnellys
farmed the land and raised a family of nine children. Robert also served as a justice of the peace
(Lampasas County Historical Commission, 1991: 26).
Robert D. McAnelly died at Bend in 1888, but for some reason the record of his 1847 patent for land in
San Saba County was not formally filed until 1909. Despite that discrepancy, records indicate a series of
early land conveyances involving the property. In February 1868, for example, McAnelly sold twelve
acres to James C. Rogan for $975, noting in the deed: “I hereby reserve to myself the privilege of backing
water up said (McAnelly/Mill) Creek for the purpose of erecting machinery.” The relatively high per acre
price of $81.25 might lead one to believe there were improvements to the land at the time, but in reality
the price reflects a premium associated with riparian rights, a situation that will be discussed later.
Unfortunately, a page of the deed is apparently missing, despite consecutive page numbers in the deed
volume, as the document ends in mid-sentence at the end of the first page. (The first page of the document
also references an “interlined word” on the second page which is not evident.) Regardless of the missing
piece of the puzzle, land no doubt transferred to Rogan (San Saba County Deed Records: B-3/312).
Tennessean Dr. James C. Rogan (1822-1903) came to Texas in 1848, soon wed Mary Armour Brown in
Caldwell County, and settled with his family in the San Saba area in 1855. A founder of the town the
121

following year, he was one of its prominent pioneer citizens as a practicing physician, a major landowner,
and an active civic leader. Records indicate he owned city lots, several tracts within the McAnelly
Surveys, and over 700 acres in the Wilcox Survey as well. (San Saba County Historical Commission,
1983: 285; San Saba County Deed Records: various).
According to a Risien family story that is noted in a county history book and further documented in
county deed records, Dr. Rogan was instrumental in conveying the target property to Edmund E. Risien. It
is believed the Risien family may have lived on the land adjacent to the creek prior to ownership. While
Risien was initially a local furniture merchant, he also conceived a practical concept for damming the
creek (then known as McAnelly Creek) to provide a steady supply of water to the town.
The 1880 conveyance from Rogan to Risien mentions the matter of water rights and provides some details
to both land occupation and the construction of a water system. A series of conditions within the deed
noted first:
That said Risien shall keep up his present dam across Mill Creek, just below the crossing
of the road, from San Saba to Lampasas, and Austin, or any other good and sufficient
dam at the same locality, so as to maintain a depth or a head of water of not less than ten
feet, six inches in height from the surface water immediately below, and at the base of the
dam during the ordinary flow of water in the creek (San Saba County Deed Records:
I/438).
It is our interpretation that the phrase “below the crossing of the road” in the passage above means north
of the road, since the creek flows from south to north. Thus, the dam would be situated within the new
LCRA San Saba Park property. The conditions further stipulated that Rogan reserved access to the “dam
and premises” that would allow him, at his own expense, “to locate a Hydraulic Ram or Hydraulic Rams,
with the necessary pipes, fixtures and appurtenances to make complete the Hydraulic apparatus for raising
and conducting away water at or near the dam, as will afford the greatest power and facilities.” The
document concludes with statements exonerating Risien from any unforeseen drop or damaging rise in the
stream level, although he remained obligated to make any necessary repairs in a timely fashion. (San Saba
County Deed Records: I/438)
Strangely, the deed does not list the total acreage in the conveyance, but the story of the land transfer
from Rogan to Risien is consistent with family tradition as noted in a county history book:
Dr. Rogan gave the Risiens one bank of the creek and enough land for their home, yard
and machinery. In return they were to provide him with water. T.W. Ward, co-founder of
the City National Bank, lent the money for the dam and the manufacturers sold the
machinery on time (San Saba County Historical Commission, 1983: 281).
The article does not provide site specific information on the Risien House, but it indicates the family had
a cow and beehives, which they used to produce milk and honey for sale, and that they also made money
from a bathhouse on their property. The bathing facilities are believed to have been upstream from the
dam and east of the house. (Vaughn 2009) According to Risien descendant Elsie Millican, who resides in
122

San Saba, the numerous square concrete pads found around the existing house site were once part of the
bathhouse operation (Millican 2009).
If the Risiens were living on the property prior to ownership, as the family believes, they could have been
there as early as the mid-1870s, when construction began on the dam below the main road. That time
frame is consistent with at least some of the elements of the house, although later work may have resulted
in removal of earlier materials. Ms. Elsie Millican, a 95 year old descendent of the Risien family, has
stated that the Risien family lived in the house currently on the property. No written records have been
found that would confirm that the house on the property was occupied by the Risien family. According to
Ms. Millican, the Risiens lived at the site until around the time of a legal dispute with a partner in the dam
operation, J.A. “Shorty” Brown (Millican 2009). Brown brought the suit against Risien in 1885 over the
matter of riparian rights along McAnelly Creek, and Risien appealed to the Texas Supreme Court which
heard the case in January 1889. Essentially, the dispute arose over who had the legal authority to
construct a dam across the creek; Brown argued he had exclusive rights through conveyances from the
original landowner, Robert D. McAnelly, but Risien countered that any changes he made were with the
prior knowledge and implied authorization of Brown. Although Brown prevailed in the lower courts, the
Supreme Court ruled in Risien’s favor in what became a landmark water rights case in the state (The
Southwestern Reporter, 1889: 661-664).
The legal wrangling disrupted the longstanding relationship between Brown and Risien, and not long after
the decision Risien chose to sell his property along the creek and move to another location in San Saba. It
was there that he became best known for his work in pecan grafting, work that led him to be
acknowledged as the father of the Texas pecan industry. Exactly when Risien sold his property is
unknown; an out conveyance could not be located in the county records. Mrs. Millican believes it was
prior to 1909, and it may be that he sold to the local water works and that the deed is listed under a
trustee’s name. Regardless, it is known the San Saba Water Company had possession of the land by 1919,
when it sold to John L. and Nannie Aylor. They, in turn, sold the land the following year to P.I. Myers,
but John Aylor filed suit against P.I. and Ethel P. Myers four years later, and as a result the land conveyed
to the sheriff for public sale, with T.S. Aylor as the new owner. He retained ownership until 1940, and
subsequent owners between then and 1943 included David Gillespie and Sam Moore. In December 1943,
though, the property once again conveyed to the Risien family through E.E. Risien’s son, E. Guy. Like his
father, E.Guy Risien was prominent in the pecan industry, and he also owned considerable acreage around
San Saba. During his ownership of the target site, he rented the property along the creek, with one of the
tenants being the Vaughn family in the 1950s. Dan Vaughn, who met with LCRA staff and contractors at
the site in April 2009, recalled living in the home with his family as a teenager. As he walked through the
house, he provided information on interior furnishings, including the kitchen area with its kerosene stove,
the main living area that included a wood burning stove in front of the fireplace, and the bedroom area
that once had shelves and a closet. To him, the house had changed little since the 1950s, although the
ceiling material was no longer in place. Mr. Vaughn also noted that the greenhouse is no longer present
on the east side of the house, nor is the open shed addition present on the far north end of the house. It is
believed the Vaughn family was among the last to live in the house and that it has remained vacant for
decades (Vaughn 2009).

Physical Description
In general, the house at site 41SS176 can be described as a small, T-plan, cross-gabled, rectilinear frame
house constructed in multiple phases over a period of years from the late nineteenth century to the midtwentieth century. The structure faces south and is located immediately east of Mill Creek, which flows
from south to north along the property at that point. The house is an example of an evolutionary form that
may reflect from three to five distinct building periods. In its current state, it includes three rooms: a
living area, bedroom, and kitchen. It most likely began as a one-room structure, however, with the west
side exhibiting signs of the earliest construction. Given the various changes to the structure, it is best
described through descriptions using detail photographs taken by LCRA photographer Billy Moore on
December 21, 2009.
Figure 54, which was taken from the southeast corner of the home, shows a partially collapsed front porch
that at one time had turned posts reminiscent of the Victorian era. Diagonal bracing has been added
recently to prevent further collapse. The porch roof overhangs two doors—one centrally located on the
south façade and flanked by a similar door to the west—as well as a vertical window opening on the east
side of the south façade. Window openings on the south and east sides do not match in size or general
verticality. Also evident in the photo is the use of horizontal planking covered at one time by rolled
asphalt sheathing. Only one window is present on the east side of the structure, which is an unusual
configuration for such early houses. More conventional would be single windows located on either side of
a central chimney on the gable end of the house.

Figure 54. 41SS176 house site, southeast oblique.
124

Evident in Figure 55 is the use of vertical planking on the west side of the front façade. Note also the lack of a
window on the west facade, the dilapidated state of horizontal planks along the southwest corner of the porch, and
the minimal rock underpinning, as compared to a more substantial base on the southeast corner.

Figure 55. 41SS176 house site, southwest oblique.

The T-extension, or ell, of the house served as a kitchen and may have been added to the original part of
the structure at a later date (Figure 56). It may have been built on site or, more likely, salvaged from
nearby property. Evidence can be seen of vertical planking in the addition, contrasting with the visible
horizontal planking on the south part of the house. The planks on the north wall, especially, show the
existence of earlier nail holes, suggesting there were possibly battens over the openings prior to the
application of the rolled sheathing. There is an entryway on the east side of the kitchen but no windows
on either the eastern or northern exposures. Note that the metal roofing has been bent over the gable end
for weather protection instead of the standard system of cornices.
At one time, a shed extended from either the kitchen ell or main house on this side (Figure 57). Probably
open-sided, it served as space for parking a car or machinery. Information on the addition came from oral
histories, and no evidence of it could be found on the structure, although archeologists located what
appears to be a stone support just below ground several feet west of what was the original part of the
house.

125

126

The stonework represents one of the more interesting, but also confusing, elements of the construction.
Figure 58 shows an evolution in construction that is consistent with other indicators inside the house.
What was most likely the original stone foundation, comprised of ashlar-cut gray limestone, can be seen
to the left. An extension to the right, added when the east side of the house was either rebuilt or enlarged,
is formed of squared red sandstone blocks that serve, in effect, as a veneer for the earlier construction.
Note the large hearthstone, right top center and the use of Portland cement as a binder, indicating later
repairs. Note also that the support beam to the left has been painted white, an indication that it was
possibly salvaged from another structure. At least one of the beams, not visible in this photo, includes
commercial-style lettering.

Figure 58. 41SS176 house site, chimney foundation detail, east side of house.

The southeast foundation of the house, in marked contrast to other corners, shows considerable
underpinning using both limestone and sandstone blocks (Figure 59). The stonework, however, does not
exhibit a high degree of craftsmanship, such as is evident in the chimney base or nearby waterworks.
Stan Graves pointed out the different surround detailing used for the two doors on the front façade, an
indication they were built at different times. Figure 60 shows care was taken to cut and abut horizontal
planks flush with the vertical surround. Note that the horizontal planks are overlapping clapboards at this
point, in contrast to the flat and abutted planks on the east side of the house, and vertical planks on the
west side.

127

Figure 59. 41SS176 house site, foundation detail, southeast corner.

In contrast to the other door on the south façade, the clapboards are not flush with the easternmost door
surround, but instead lie underneath both the vertical board and the asphalt sheathing (Figure 61). This
indicates the door opening was added at a later date, causing Graves to speculate the westernmost door
might have been centrally located on the south façade at one time. Archeologists attempted to locate
evidence of an extension to the front façade on the west side, but the only foundations unearthed were not
in line and probably remain from the garage shed on that side.
Figure 62 provides evidence of the minimal construction of the front porch, believed to have been added
in the mid-twentieth century. The rafters, some of which have been “sistered” to other boards, were
toenailed to the cornice board with wire nails in a system that has allowed it to fail over time. No
evidence of earlier mortise holes were noted either on the interior or exterior, so it is believed the house
originally had no porch on the south side.

130

Figure 62. 41SS176 house site Porch roof detail

At one time, a series of turned posts supported the front porch roof (Figure 63). The posts exhibit different
overall designs, as well as considerable weathering, so they may either be culls or remnants from another
site. The roof structure showed no signs of brackets or other ornamentation that would be expected with
such posts. It may be they were added at the time of the porch construction in an effort to stylize the
addition.
Square nails were used to secure the vertical planks on the west side of the house, an indication of that
section’s earlier construction, probably from the late nineteenth century (Figure 64). A few square nails
were also evident along the north side bottom edge of the kitchen extension, but wire nails were used
elsewhere throughout the house.
Figure 65 shows the separation of flooring materials between the original house section and the kitchen
ell, an indicator of different construction periods.

Figure 66 shows the variety of construction methods evident in the house. Taken from the main body of
the house looking back into the kitchen ell, it shows box frame construction on the left of the door and
Western frame construction on the right.

Figure 66. 41SS176 house site, interior detail, looking toward kitchen ell.

Figure 67 shows what should have been the opening for the chimney, the sizeable base for which was
noted in Figure 58. The area has been boxed in, which in effect shows the outside line of the house was
extended at some point. What appears to be the hearthstone at the bottom center of the photo is actually
the top of a concrete slab poured over the hearthstone to a depth of about two inches. At one time, a wood
stove may have been placed on the hearth and vented out through the framed area.
Visible in the center of the roof rafters is The remains of a wood stove vent pipe are visible in the center
of the roof rafters (Figure 68). Almost immediately below is a charred space on the floor that, according
to former resident Dan Vaughn, was the location of the heating stove in the 1950s.

Figure 68. 41SS176 house site, interior view showing evolution of heating systems.

In the mid-twentieth century, this kitchen area included a kerosene stove (Figure 69). A sink is shown to
the left, although whether or not the house had running water is uncertain. There was no interior
bathroom, though, and outhouses were located to the northeast of the house.
Figure 70, facing south in the bedroom area, shows the corner junction point formed by horizontal and
vertical walls. In the bedroom, there is a door on the south wall and a window on the north wall; no
window exists on the western wall.
The interior wall in the bedroom is box framed over vertical planks without battens (Figure 71). The
unevenness of the boards at the rafter level indicates the wall was most likely added at a later date from
salvaged lumber. Evidence of cheesecloth, the base material for wallpaper, can be found around tacks on
the boards.
The connecting rooflines of the main house (foreground) and kitchen ell (background) are visible in
Figure 72. The connection was made with minimal construction, and the metal valleys at intersecting
points are clearly seen from the interior. Note the porcelain insulators and electrical wires, and the rafter
cleats used for nailing up ceiling materials, most likely fiberboard or sheetrock.

Conclusion:
Historically, the house at site 41SS176 has ties to two members of the family for which it is best known
during two separate periods of ownerships. Both E.E. Risien and E.Guy Risien were considered
prominent leaders in their community who were instrumental in the development of San Saba as a vital
center of pecan production in the state. Their periods of significance, however, were more closely
associated with other residences and commercial structures within the city. It is believed by three
informants that E.E. Risien lived in the house, or at least an early portion of the house, along Mill Creek
at a time when he was a key player in a landmark riparian rights case involving a water works operation
on adjacent property, but the house was not integral to the legal proceedings. The primary historical
features associated with the case are the remains of the waterworks in the bed of Mill Creek.
Architecturally, the house at site 41SS176 is a vernacular structure believed to date in part from
the late nineteenth century, although a specific date of construction remains undeterminable through
available local records. Historic period artifacts recovered during the archaeological survey of the house
site area mostly date from the early through mid 20th century. The house evolved in footprint, materials,
and construction techniques into the mid-twentieth century, and in its latter years it served as rental
property and then storage space. It has been unoccupied for several decades, a situation which has
contributed considerably to its present deteriorated state. Because of the various phases of construction, it
is not possible to determine a precise sequence of the architectural evolution. The west side of the house
appears to predate the east side, as does the kitchen ell. Each section of the house, however, lacks both
structural and architectural integrity, and significant elements fail to relate in a logical sense. Repairs or
additions to the house at 41SS176 probably occurred as families grew or as floods inundated the site. A
significant rise along the San Saba River and its tributaries in 1938 no doubt took its toll on the property
and may have necessitated the reframing of the house on the east side.

Management Summary
In February 2010, the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) staff completed an intensive cultural
resource survey of the LCRA’s proposed San Saba River Nature Park. The 46.6-acre park tract is
located on the eastern edge of the City of San Saba in San Saba County, Texas. The park acreage
primarily consists of alluvial terraces along the banks of the San Saba River and Mill Creek, a spring-fed
tributary of the river.
LCRA is proposing a low impact park development at the nature park. The principal construction
elements include a 1.5-mile long hiking trail with three adjacent scenic overlook platforms and two foot
bridges over the Mill Creek channel. A series of signs that will focus on the cultural and natural history
of the park area will be placed along the hiking trail. The other principal development features are two
small parking lots and associated vehicular access roads.
The intensive cultural resource survey of the park area consisted of pedestrian survey and the excavation
of 83 shovel tests, 17 auger tests, and 16 backhoe trenches. As a result of the survey, six new cultural
resource sites consisting of 41SS175-178, 41SS181, and 41SS182 were recorded and assessed.
Additionally, one previously recorded site, 41SS113, was revisited and assessed. Sites 41SS113,
41SS176, and 41SS177 were determined to be multi-component sites with both prehistoric and historic
materials. Sites 41SS175, 41SS178, and 41SS181 were found to contain prehistoric materials
exclusively, while site 41SS182 was found to contain only historic materials.
All prehistoric components appear to be terrace campsites with site 41SS177 also including a burned rock
midden feature. Shovel and mechanical testing generally examined the upper 1.0 to 1.2 meters of cultural
deposits at each of these prehistoric sites. All of these prehistoric components revealed artifacts mostly
consisting of large numbers of mussel shells, and smaller quantities of burned rock and chert tools and
debitage. Diagnostic prehistoric artifacts recovered during the survey investigations consist of single Late
Archaic II dart points found at sites 41SS175 and 41SS176 along with a Toyah Phase arrowpoint from
site 41SS177. Importantly, buried, burned rock features were found during the survey work within the
prehistoric components at sites 41SS175-41SS178 and 41SS113. The presence of intact, buried features
suggests a high degree of contextual integrity of deposits at these sites. Thus, there is good potential for
stratified cultural deposits at these sites and here is also a possibility that buried, stratified deposits with
intact features could also exist in unexamined portions of the remaining prehistoric component site,
41SS181. Therefore, all prehistoric components discovered during the park survey are assessed as
potentially eligible for formal designation as State Archeological Landmarks (SAL).
The four sites that have historic period materials are 41SS113, 41SS176, 41SS177, and 41SS182. At
41SS176 and 41SS177, historic period house site remains are present. Features associated with the
residential occupations are a standing, three room structure at 41SS176 and the chimney associated with a
former house structure at 41SS177. Artifacts recovered around the two house areas primarily date from
the early to mid twentieth century. A very limited number of artifacts at these sites date to the late
nineteenth century. Although one informant stated that the house at 41SS176 was occupied during the
1880s by E. E. Risien, the well-known father of the pecan industry in San Saba County, there are no
written records to corroborate this information. Further, the location of the house and its exterior features
do not match two early twentieth century photographs. A detailed physical inspection of the house at
41SS176 shows indications of three to five construction modification phases. The house at 41SS176 is
assessed as not architecturally significant, and the details of its early history remain uncertain. Written
documentation and photographs of the house have been previously submitted to the Texas Historical
Commission. The archeological deposits associated with the house are assessed as not eligible for formal
designation as an SAL.
143

Other historic period remains at 41SS176 are a set of cut limestone mortared features that are located in
the bed of Mill Creek about 30 meters east of the historic house component. Archival research indicates
that these features are the original waterworks for the City of San Saba, and that they were constructed by
E. E. Risien and several associates during the early 1880s. The waterworks were in operation until
approximately 1900. The waterworks features retain some integrity and have good interpretative
potential in conjunction with the park development. For these reasons the portion of site 41SS176
containing the waterworks is assessed as eligible for formal designation as an SAL.
The house at 41SS177 is no longer present, and the archaeological materials associated with it appear to
date predominantly from the early to mid twentieth century. Archival research shows that the house
changed owners numerous times in the early twentieth century before becoming a rental property in later
years. Although a chimney is still present, it does not have any outstanding construction characteristics
and it is currently a safety risk in a public park setting. LCRA proposes to dismantle the majority of the
chimney to eliminate this risk. The historic component at 41SS177 is assessed as not meriting formal
designation as an SAL due its relatively late date and lack of noteworthy architectural features.
The remaining two historic components are found at sites 41SS113 and 41SS182. The historic component
at 41SS113 is an apparent trash dump that does not appear to have any research potential, and it is
assessed as not eligible for formal designation as an SAL. Site 41SS182 represents the remains of an old
wastewater treatment plant that one informant says operated between about 1900 and the mid-1920s. The
two principal features are a subsurface concrete tank and an attached drain field. Shovel testing within
and around the features produced no artifacts. No inscriptions that would aid in dating the features were
found in the concrete. Site 41SS182’s potential to provide any new or interesting data about wastewater
treatment plant technologies is presently unknown. No impacts are planned for this area, but future work
may require additional investigations.
According to current park development plans, potentially significant prehistoric deposits at site 41SS178
may be affected by the proposed construction of one of the footbridges. The area of concern at 41SS178
is situated between previously excavated backhoe trenches #1 and 2 in the vicinity of Shovel tests #30,
75, and 76. After the exact location and methods for the footbridge construction have been determined,
LCRA will consult with the THC on the need for any further investigations before construction starts in
this area.
Although the ground disturbance associated with the proposed hiking trail construction should be
confined within the upper 8 cm of soil deposits, that construction could damage potentially significant
prehistoric deposits within some parts of sites 41SS177 and 41SS178. At 41SS177, the main hiking trail
could follow at existing dirt road where the upper cultural deposits have been previously damaged by
vehicular traffic and the previous construction of a wastewater pipeline. The other section of the
proposed trail system within 41SS177, an appendage in the southwest part of the site that leads to one of
the scenic overlook platforms, has a greater potential to damage intact cultural deposits. At 41SS178, the
artifact returns were highly variable from the uppermost level of various shovel and auger tests, but some
potentially significant prehistoric deposits could be affected by the trail construction at that site also. The
LCRA proposes to have members of its archaeological staff monitor the construction of the hiking trails
through 41SS177 and 41SS178 as a further assessment of prehistoric deposits. Aside from these
recommendations for further cultural resource investigations, it is recommended that all other
construction, as currently planned, be allowed to proceed.

Introduction
The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) has purchased a 46.6 acre tract on the northeast edge of the
City of San Saba, Texas for development of a new park (Figure 73). The new park is situated north and
west of two existing City parks, Mill Pond and Risien parks, respectively. The San Saba River, a major
tributary of the Colorado River, forms the northern boundary of the new park, and Mill Creek, a large
spring-fed creek, runs through the southern and central parts of the park property before emptying into the
San Saba River at the northeastern edge of the tract. Prominent man-made features within and adjacent to
the park are State Highway 190, which forms the southern boundary of the park, and the old Santa Fe
Railroad tracks and right-of-way, which bisects the park on an east-west line.
Proposed park development elements are diagrammed on Figure 74 and Figure 75. The most
concentrated development will occur at the southwestern end of the park where a 200 foot long entrance
road and associated 15 to 20 stall parking lot will be constructed. An observation deck and two
interpretative markers are proposed for construction to the east of these features. A second smaller
parking lot will also be constructed adjacent to Risien Park at the far eastern edge of the new park. Other
proposed construction includes a 1.5 mile long low impact hiking trail that will traverse the majority of
the parkland. Along this trail, two foot bridges will be constructed across Mill Creek and three
observation decks will be placed at scenic spots overlooking this creek. A series of rest stops/sitting areas
featuring interpretative signage will be constructed along the trail. The principal themes of the
interpretative signage will be prehistoric and historic cultural resource sites present within the park
property. Additionally, two of the scenic overlooks will be constructed to provide views of a historic site,
the City of San Saba’s first waterworks.
An intensive cultural resource survey of the new park property was conducted by the LCRA Archaeology
Services staff in stages from mid 2009 through early 2010 under Texas Antiquities Committee Blanket
Permits #5141 and #5528. Personnel involved in the survey consisted of LCRA Archaeology Services
staff members Daniel J. Prikryl (Principal Investigator) and Andrew Malof along with contracted
archaeologists Chuck Hixson, Pat Hatten, and Glenn Goode. A contracted historian, Dan Utley, assisted
by Andrew Malof, conducted archival research, oral history interviews, and other associated research on
the historic period sites within the project area. All cultural resource work was completed in accordance
with methods for fieldwork and reporting as proposed by the Texas Council of Archeologists (1992).
Environmental Background
Holocene era alluvium deposits associated with the San Saba River system are present across the surface
of all of the project area, except at the far south edges of the tract where fluviatile terrace deposits of
Holocene or Pleistocene age are present (Kier et al. 1976). The San Saba River floodplain and its
terraces are flanked on the north by sandstone outcrops of the Pennsylvanian-aged Strawn Group and on
the south by Pennsylvanian Marble Falls Formation and Smithwick Shale. Numerous fault lines are
present in areas where these later two geologic units abut each other and where they abut the much older
Ordovician-aged Gorman Formation. It appears that a number of springs issue along these fault lines
including the headwaters of Mill Creek.
Topsoils in the project area are all Frio silty clay loam (Bynum 1982:Map Plate 25). Frio soils form on
the nearly level alluvial surface of the silty clay sediments that make up the San Saba River floodplain.
The depth of these sediments ranges from six to 30 feet and overlie sand, gravels, or limestone bedrock.
Because of the frequency of flooding, about once every five to 12 years, these soils see incremental
deposition of parent material while they are concurrently undergoing pedogenic processes.

This results in an “overthickened” A horizon with the upper soil zone less weathered than the underlying
soil zones (Ferring 1992). Frio soils are described as silty clay loams reaching an average depth of 65
inches (Bynum 1987). The color of the upper 22 inches is a dark grayish brown to very dark grayish
brown due to high levels of organic matter. From 22 inches down to a depth of 42 inches, the soil is a
dark brown with calcium carbonate films. The basal zone from 42 inches to 65 inches is a C horizon that
is brown in color with many calcium carbonate films and treads.
It is generally thought that prior to Anglo-American settlement, deciduous forests grew in the valleys of
the major streams in central Texas while upland areas were covered by a mosaic of woods and grasslands
(Black et al. 1997). This basic pattern still exists today but the composition and distributions of plant
species now largely derive from disturbances caused by modern land-use practices (McMahan et. al
1984). Much of the San Saba floodplain today is considerably altered from its natural state by agriculture
and development. The floodplain north and west of Mill Creek is now an open field cleared long ago for
cropland. South of the railroad ROW is an abandoned pecan orchard with an underground irrigation
system. Some areas within the boundaries of the park appear less modified. These include the low
terraces and benches near the confluence of Mill Creek and the San Saba River where large pecan trees
grow with little understory woody vegetation, and areas along the steep banks of these incised streams
which harbor a riparian woods.
South of the San Saba River valley lies the northern edge of the Edwards Plateau. The terrain is hilly and
covered by park-type vegetation, meaning there is a continuous grass cover with an 11 to 70% tree
canopy cover (McMahan et. al 1984). The most frequent tree species are live oak and Ashe juniper along
with mesquite in areas of deep soil; these trees grow in clusters (mottes) or as individuals. Riparian
woods occur along larger creeks.
To the north of the San Saba River valley lies the south end of the Mesquite Plains, a southern extension
of the North Central Plains physiographic region (Bureau of Economic Geology 1977). The region is also
known as the Rolling Plains (Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs 1978). Griffith et al. 2004 call
this region the Limestone Plains and consider it the southeastern part of the Central Great Plains. They
place the region more to west than other geographers and consider the region immediately north of the
project area as the south end of the Western Cross Timbers. According to McMahan et. al (1984),
vegetation in this area is patchwork of plant communities found in the Cross Timbers and prairies, and
plant communities typical of the Edwards Plateau. Both communities are dominated by oaks, ash juniper
and mesquite with many similar understory species such as agarita and Mexican persimmon.
Prehistoric Background
The project area lies in the northwest corner of the Central Texas Archeological Region, as defined over
the years by various researchers (Suhm 1960, Prewitt 1981, Brown et al. 1982). Archeological regions
are identified on the basis of “cultural sameness,” a list of material cultural traits that set one region apart
from other regions. For central Texas, these traits have mainly centered on projectile point styles. The
validity of defining “archeological regions” and specifically of defining a central Texas archeological
region has been addressed by archeologists in recent years (Collins 1995, Ellis et al. 1995, Black 1997).
As a geographical unit, central Texas has no natural boundaries and is more an artificial construct
resulting from the present political boundaries of the state. It does not necessarily correspond to any past
social or cultural network and, in any event, the geographical extent of any social-cultural systems would
have fluctuated over time making it impossible to define a single boundary.
In the 1960s and 1970s, many processual archaeologists argued that a culture operates as a system with
adaptive functions; As Lewis Binford (1961), referencing anthropologist Leslie White (1959), put it
“culture is the extra-somatic means of adaptation for the human organism.” Human ecology and cultural
149

adaptation have remained important themes in hunter-gatherer archeology. Since Central Texas is an
environmentally diverse region, many different cultural systems must have operated in the past, probably
encompassing more than one natural subregion. San Saba lies at the ecotone between the Edwards
Plateau and the Mesquite Plains and presumably both subregions played key roles in the subsistence
strategies of the local population. Resources from the nearby Llano Uplift and the Lampasas Cut Plains
were probably also important, either obtained directly or through exchange.
Regardless of one’s theoretical orientation, chronological frameworks are considered important tools for
ordering the past. Chronological frameworks for Central Texas have been fine-tuned over the years by
various researchers, with the one most in use at present being that of Johnson and Goode (1992). As with
all such frameworks for the region, projectile point forms are used as time markers to recognize various
time periods and subperiods. Most of the information used to create the chronological frameworks for
central Texas has come from stratified sites well to the east of the project area (Prewitt 1981, Johnson
1995, Collins 1998). All these frameworks start with the three cultural evolutionary periods used for
North American prehistory based to a large extent on subsistence patterns. “Paleoindian” and “Archaic”
are terms universally used in North America for the earliest of the three periods while “Late Prehistoric”
is now commonly used to name the last of the prehistoric periods in central Texas, although other terms
have been proposed such as Post Archaic (Johnson 1995) emphasizing a continuation of subsistence
strategies.
The Paleoindian period in Texas has been dated from 11,500 BP (before present) to 8800 BP (Collins
1998) and includes the earliest known archeological cultures of North America This period has been
traditionally divided into an Early subperiod when Pleistocene megafauna such as mammoths were still
part of the subsistence base and a Late subperiod after these animal had become extinct. Paleoindians in
central Texas appear to have practiced a generalized hunter-gather or foraging strategy with the possible
exception of one archeological culture, Folsom, whose toolkit suggests specialization on hunting bison.
The succeeding Archaic period is dated from 8800 BP to 1200 BP (Collins 1998) and has been divided
into three subperiods based in part on differences in projectile point technology (Johnson 1995). Like
most of the Paleoindian cultures, the Archaic peoples were generalized hunter-gathers with the defining
difference being their intensive use of hot rock cooking technology (Collins 1998). The degree to which
such technology was used on the Edwards Plateau and adjacent regions to the north and west can be seen
in the size and frequency of fire-cracked rock accumulations known as burned rock middens (Black et al.
1997).
The last prehistoric period, the Late Prehistoric begins around 1200 BP with the adoption of the bow and
arrow and lasts until 300 BP when local cultural systems are starting to be profoundly influenced, directly
or indirectly, by Europeans. Early in this period, Archaic subsistence patterns persist but with the
appearance of the Toyah culture around A.D. 1300, a more mobile, hunting-oriented way of life is seen in
the archeological record. This specialized hunting culture may have been a response by the regional
population to the re-incursion of bison into central and south Texas sometime after A.D.1200 (Dillehay
1974). Alternatively, this culture may have been brought into the region by intrusive groups (Johnson
1994).
Previous Investigations
According to the Archeological Sites Atlas of Texas there are presently 178 archaeological sites recorded
in San Saba County (early 2010). If a less arbitrary measure is used, about 270 archaeological sites are
found within an approximate 20 mile radius of the town of San Saba. This does not include some 220
sites within the Lake Buchanan and Inks Lake areas. A random sampling of recorded site information
indicates a typical assemblage of prehistoric campsites, lithic scatters and procurement areas as well as
150

shelters, caves, rock art and burial sites. Historic sites include homesteads and farmsteads, engineering
features and other commercial development projects, especially at Colorado Bend State Park. The Atlas
indicates that there are 27 formal State Archeological Landmarks in San Saba County, all at Colorado
Bend State Park, except for the courthouse in San Saba, which is listed. The courthouse is also on the
National Register of Historic Places, as is the Regency Suspension Bride which spans the Colorado River
between San Saba and Mills Counties.
Several clusters of recorded sites stand out. The majority of these were recorded in association with
Texas Tech University field schools and surveys. To date, no syntheses of these projects have been
located (although some more site-specific projects resulting in master’s theses are summarized below).
In the San Saba area there is a cluster of about 35 sites, primarily on the San Saba and Algerita USGS
quads. Within the city of San Saba are three sites. Site 41SS113 is located within the present project area
and described in detail below. Local archeology steward Buddy Whitney monitored construction of a
wastewater line and found dense lithics, large (bison) bone and ceramics. Whitney also recorded a large
burned rock midden in Mill Pond Park (41SS166) just upstream from the project area on Mill Creek, and
a buried lens of burned rock while monitoring excavating for concrete footings in the central town area.
About 1.5 miles downstream from the junction of Mill Creek and the San Saba River is a series of sites on
existing or fossil meanders of the river. These were recorded or re-recorded for the LCRA Lampasas to
Evant transmission line. The most substantial is probably 41SS28, an open camp with mussel shell and
which may have intact, buried components and has produced two arrow points. Other sites included a
camp, a lithic scatter with burned rock, a highly disturbed rock scatter and a lithic procurement site.
The most substantial site cluster is on the Baker Spring and Brady Mountain USGS quads, where 46 sites
are recorded along either side of the San Saba River, about 12 miles south-southwest of San Saba.
Representative sites include large open camps, some with burned rock middens (41SS51, 97, 115, 116
and 135) and an historic cemetery (41SS114). Occasional historic material was noted as well. Five
Paleoindian era Plainview points were reported, one at 41SS135 and four at 41SS116. Site 41SS51 had a
large (75 x 100 m) burned rock midden that was later partially excavated and analyzed (discussed below).
Sites more removed from the floodplain, either on near-river terraces or more upland settings, included
41SS8, the Bloody Hand Site, named after a pictograph at this open camp and shelter, a mortar hole site,
and other open camps and burned rock middens. Site 41SS52 had a series of rock alignments and rock
piles, and was hypothesized as a bison jump site. Additional investigations, while unable to demonstrate
the site was a kill site, did provide several evidentiary lines suggesting it probably was (Howell 1999).
Surrounding Barnett Springs, a bit south and east of the last selection of sites, are at least eight more
recorded sites including two lithic procurement sites, a lithic scatter, as well as open camps, some with
extensive midden deposits and one with buried bone seen in a cutbank. At 41SS110 a Marshall point was
found as were three ceramic sherds. Site 41SS104 and 41SS112 both had open, semi-circular limekilns.
Site 41SS107 had limestone rock walls that were described as possible fortifications. Chert chipping
debris was also present. The majority of these sites were recorded by Texas tech students.
Twenty-five miles north of San Saba, on the opposite side of the Colorado River in Mills County, is a
substantial series of sites recorded along and between Pecan Bayou and several short tributary creeks,
including Chambers Creek. The land here is heavily dissected. Texas Tech University held its 1991 field
school here, and documented a number of sites (41MI66-41MI96). Many of the sites apparently were
pointed out to them by Del Barnett, the landowner, who had a seemingly well-provenienced surface
collection that minimally included San Patrice, Martindale, Castroville, Pedernales, Ensor and Scallorn
points. Once again, burned rock middens and open camp sites, many with buried components, were
present.

151

Some 25 miles northwest of San Saba is a cluster of about 20 sites, the majority in Mills County on the
Bowser USGS quad. Sites 41SS19, SS74 and SS75 are located on the inside of a pronounced bend of the
Colorado River. All are open camp sites, with 41SS74 and 75 recommended for testing prior to work on
FM 45, and 41SS19 being the Happy Patch Site, an extensively collected site reported in a Bulletin of the
Texas Archeological Society (BTAS). The FM 45 crossing of the river was also used historically. It does
not appear the two sites were ever tested. The Happy Patch Site included two intact shell middens and at
least six other disturbed ones (Bonine et. al 2008). The original author (Green 1971) mentioned burned
rock middens nearby.
In the area just east of Richland Springs is a rather astonishing cluster of sites recorded by L. M. Green in
the late 1960s and early 1970s. These nine sites (41SS10-13, SS20, 23, 24, 36 and 37) all contained
burned rock, most had burned rock middens, and were primarily Archaic with seeming Late Prehistoric
overprinting. Bison bone was common, and at 41SS23 human phalanges were reported. Site 41SS10
included bone tools, incised bone and a stone gorget near a large mound containing a burned rock
midden. Many sites were in jeopardy from bulldozing and agricultural use.
Included in this cluster was 41SS20, the Finis Frost Site, which was reported in the 1973 BTAS (Green
and Hester 1973). The site form reports it as a Toyah phase terrace site with ceramics, Perdiz, Fresno
(like) points and a Washita point, as well as ceramics. Comment was made on the large number of
scrapers and other tools, which included bi-pointed and four beveled knives. The depth of fill was
described as only 5-8 inches. According to a site summary (Bonine et.al 2008), the authors (at the time)
suggested that this was a semi-sedentary occupation area with evidence of both extensive bison hunting
and processing activities, but also plant processing, based on a number of manos and metates that were
present. Incipient maize production was suggested.
In 1988 Espey Huston and Associates surveyed 19 miles of 51.5 mile-long T-138, which runs from
Lampasas west and north to San Saba, then generally north to Goldthwaite (Jones et. al 1988). (The
section from San Saba to Goldthwaite has been re-designated T-461.) Survey areas focused on two
Colorado River crossings and a crossing of the San Saba River. Twenty-seven archaeological sites were
recorded. Within the ROW, six terrace sites were felt to have additional research potential and were
subjected to construction avoidance. Four historic sites that were once contained structures were
recorded, and an unsuccessful effort was made to locate the Simpson Creek (aka Barnett-Hamrick)
Settlement. None of the historic sites were considered eligible within the ROW. Open camps 41LM12
and 41SS59 were located in the vicinity of the Colorado River crossing. Site 41LM12 was on a tributary
creek about 600 m north of a bend of the Colorado River. Debitage, burned rock and mussel shell was
seen. It was felt that an alluvial setting adjacent to the creek potentially contained buried materials. Site
41SS59, on the high terrace overlooking the river to the east had an historic component that consisted of a
log structure and cement and rock features, all outside the ROW. The prehistoric component consisted of
a lithic scatter consistent with procurement activities as well as small amounts of burned rock and mussel
shell. It was felt there was potential for buried deposits in the alluvial portion of the site.
Colorado Bend State Park
This 5,328-acre park is located about 15 miles southeast of San Saba. It is on the edge of the Llano Uplift
in an area where Paleozoic limestones (rather than Precambrian granites and schists) prevail. A 2001
Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) report summarizes archaeological investigations through
the year 1996 (McNatt et al. 2001). At that time, 3,021 acres were surveyed or resurveyed and 39 sites
were documented, 21 of which had been previously recorded. (The Texas Historic Sites Atlas indicates
that as of 2009 there 61 archaeological sites recorded within the property.) There were 28 prehistoric
components and 14 historic components. Historic components consisted primarily of fishing and
152

recreation camps associated with earlier private operations, and also the Scholten Brothers cedar cutting
operation, which was a thriving business in the early twentieth century. A small cemetery was also
recorded, and over one hundred years of graffiti is present within the main Gorman Cave. Two historic
mine shafts were also present. Prehistoric sites were described as lithic scatters (n=11), terrace sites
(n=10), rock shelters (n=5), burned rock middens (n=4), a sinkhole/cave and a pictograph site.
Primarily a management document, the report did not explore the various research domains it established
(McNatt et. al 2001:22) in great detail. However, it was noted that prehistoric sites were found near water
sources almost exclusively – only two sites were found within upland settings not in “close proximity” to
water sources (McNatt et. al 2001:76). The chert found within the local limestone was of poor quality,
and almost all chert artifacts were from river cobbles rather than embedded sources (McNatt et. al 2001:5,
180), and a lithic analysis conducted on recovered debitage showed that almost 70 percent of debitage
(across all sites) was indicative of early stage reduction, a very high percentage for sites not considered to
be lithic procurement locales, but also not surprising given the immediacy of the resource. Recovered
diagnostic artifacts covered all segments of the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods. Groundstone in the
form of manos, metates, and nutting stones were reported, although the vast majority was from 41SS29, a
large terrace campsite with multiple burned rock middens. At least one incipient bedrock mortar was
reported.
A subsequent survey of 1,125 acres of the park by SWCA (Lawrence et. al 2009) recorded an additional
18 sites on either side of the Colorado River. The sites included open camps, terrace sites, rock shelter
and lithic scatters as well as additional historic sites largely associated with the cedar operations. Eleven
of the recorded sites were considered eligible or potentially eligible for formal SAL listing.
Lawrence et. al (2009: 67-81) followed up on the previously established research domains, looking
primarily at the nature and distribution of the cultural resources in the context of the paleoenvironment.
Focusing on the prehistoric sites, they fell chronologically into Early, Late and Transitional Archaic
times, with Paleoindian, Middle Archaic and Late Prehistoric sites absent or very rare. As noted
previously, river cobbles were preferred over the lower quality locally occurring chert for tool production,
although some expedient tools found in uplands were an exception. No burned rock was found in upland
settings. Colorado River terrace sites were found to contain potential intact features, and the potential for
preservation of organic material was good, as was the potential for buried cultural deposits at some
locations. Such recovery, combined with potential use wear studies on stone tools were thought to be a
useful avenue for better understanding past environments and human adaptations to them. The study also
reiterated the findings of McNatt et. al (2001) that sites tended to be close to water sources, and no real
difference in distributions through time was recognized. The distribution of sites compared favorably to a
regional study by Bonine et. al (2008), discussed below.
41SS164, Sites Synthesis
Prepared in conjunction with testing at 41SS164, located near Richland Springs, Bonine et. al (2008)
compiled an impressive and comprehensive summary of sites in a three county (Lampasas, Mills and San
Saba) area centered on 41SS164. They compiled a list of all recorded sites (N=330) and then culled those
down to sites with reported time diagnostic tools (n=56). The majority dated to the Late Archaic and Late
Prehistoric periods (the majority of these sites appeared to cover both periods). The sites were coded as
to physiographic zone (Llano Uplift, Lampasas Cut Plain, and Mesquite Plains) and to geographic setting,
which included hill tops, hill slopes, terraces (which were not necessarily alluvial terraces) and
floodplains, among others. The majority of all recorded sites were in the Llano Uplift, followed by the
Lampasas Cut Plain and then the Mesquite Plains. It was noted the numbers of sites did not correlate well
with the relative amount of area of each region in the study zone. No normalization was attempted, but
153

differences in recording intensity was suggested as a factor, as well as prehistoric settlement preferences.
An apparent settlement preference for hill slopes (defined as slopes greater than 20 percent) was noted,
including for camp sites. This seems curious, and may be a factor of map interpretation. (THC does not
require shovel testing on slopes greater than 20 percent.)
At 41SS164 an apparent sheet midden was encountered at a depth cross-cutting one meter, within a
cumulic buried A horizon. Another apparent hearth was seen in profile but not fully excavated. Wood
charcoal from oak and mesquite was recovered, and a date of 2,900 +/- 40 years B.P. was returned. A
Pandale point was found in the same level, leading them to suggest that about 4,500 years of
accumulation had been compressed into a 30 cm thick layer. Ultimately, the portion of the site to be
impacted was determined to be ineligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places.
Site 41SS164 was compared to the only four known previously excavated (or collected) sites, 41SS19
(Happy Patch), 41SS20 (Finis Frost), 41SS51 (Sloan) and 41LM3 (McCann). Only 41LM3 and 41SS51
had reported stratigraphy, and dates as early as late Paleoindian and Early Archaic, respectively.
Comparisons were made regarding the types of burned rocks found at each, and it was determined that
site inhabitants used the rock that was at hand (sandstone, limestone, or both). Granitic middens were not
available in this sample. The synthesis concluded with comments on the small sample size but suggested
an emphasis on the collection of certain types of data can help further define settlement in the region. The
exhaustive sites compilation is a worthy addition to this end.
The Sloan Site (41SS51) and 41SS52 (proposed bison jump site)
Two sites within the present study area received additional study by Texas Tech students. Site 41SS51,
the Sloan Site, was excavated between 1993 and 1996 (Butler 2006). It was determined that it could be
separated into three primary stratigraphic units corresponding to Early Archaic (a Gower point), LateTransitional Archaic (Pedernales, Montell, Ensor, and Darl points, among others), and Late Prehistoric
periods. (Note: the thesis places Pedernales points in the Middle Archaic Period, and states there were
three Darl points, considered intrusive, in what was called the Early Archaic zone.) The Early Archaic
zone had a seeming dependence on mussel and snail gathering. The Late Archaic zone saw an increase in
bone and a sharp decrease in mussel shell. This same zone contained a large burned rock midden, with a
Scallorn point suggesting formation into the Late Prehistoric Period. The upper deposits likewise have
burned rock midden deposits, as well as continued increases in bone with decreasing shell counts. Perdiz
arrow points and typical central Texas ceramics (Leon Plain) were recovered. No carbon dates were
obtained for this site.
An extensive lithic analysis was conducted for a portion of the site (Troell 2003). Disregarding the
assignment of the primary analytical deposits to the Middle Archaic period (rather than Late Archaic),
Troell found almost no change in the reduction strategies over the past 4,500 years, with an emphasis on
the production of expedient or informal tools from readily available river cobbles. Early Archaic
occupants did more on-site early stage reduction as well as more tool rejuvenation than later occupants.
Little change was noted between later Archaic stone use and that of Late Prehistoric inhabitants.
However, during the Archaic there was a shift to the use of chert from the Marble Falls formation, which
Troell suggests was due to increasing populations and pressures placed on the local river cobble supply.
A reduction “learning curve” for this lower quality material was soon overcome, and it became fully
incorporated into the assemblage. In general however, there were only slight fluctuations in what could
be considered a generalized mode of stone tool production, suggesting little change in basic subsistence
strategies through time.
Site 41SS52 was another site investigated by Texas Tech students (Howell 1999). This site had an
impressive linear arrangement of stacked stone as well as smaller stone clusters. Various reasons for the
154

alignment were explored, including an early attempt at damming the San Saba River. Despite being
unable to demonstrate conclusively that the site was a bison jump site, Howell demonstrated that it very
well could have been, most conclusively by analyzing the soils that had accumulated alongside the
feature. The formation of a Bt horizon that rested against the side of the linear feature indicated a
substantial (in a relative sense) period of time since the feature was created. Unfortunately, testing at the
base of the cliff failed to produce any concrete evidence, probably due to scouring by the river, although
the general vicinity had clearly been part of prehistoric use area, based on a Pedernales point and chipping
debris.
Summary
There are numerous sites with substantial archaeological deposits within the San Saba area. Particularly
striking is the number of sites reported with burned rock middens. All known prehistoric time periods are
represented, from early Paleoindian (Clovis, Plainview) through very late Late Prehistoric (Perdiz,
Fresno, ceramics). Late Archaic sites are the most common among those that can be placed in time. Very
few sites, however, have been systematically examined. The most recent investigations at 41SS164,
despite finding buried, stratified deposits, did not recover a sufficient quality of materials to invite indepth analysis. Sites in the San Saba region therefore have high potential for increasing an understanding
of prehistoric settlement pattering in this portion of central Texas.

Historical Overview
San Saba County is situated along the western edge of Central Texas, northwest of Austin and southwest
of Waco, in a geographic area known as the Llano Basin. Various Native American groups either made
their homes there or traversed the area from prehistoric times until the European and Anglo-American
contact period that extended into the nineteenth century. It is believed the groups included, at different
times, Apaches, Caddos, Comanches, and Tonkawas.
The first Spanish explorer known to have visited the area was Juan Antonio Bustillo y Ceballos, the
governor of Texas, who personally led a punitive expedition against Apaches in the vicinity of the San
Xavier (San Gabriel) and San Saba rivers in 1732. Just over a half century later, José Mares led an
expedition out of San Antonio in search of a more direct route to Santa Fe. Leaving San Antonio in
January 1788, he took a northwesterly route that carried his group along the San Saba and Colorado
rivers. In the course of the explorations, the expedition provided some of the earliest detailed accounts of
the region. (Tyler, 1996: Vol. 5, pp. 877-878; Tyler, 1996: Vol. 1, pp. 865-866; Tyler, 1996: Vol. 4, p.
503)
Soon after the advent of Anglo-American colonization in Texas during the 1820s, settlers began moving
steadily westward from the coastal plains. Although the San Saba River country remained beyond that
advancing line of permanent settlement for years, part of it was included in an early empresario contract
to Stephen F. Austin. In 1828, a group of settlers from around Gonzales passed through the region in
pursuit of horses, but it was not until the 1830s that serious planning for colonization of the area got
underway. In 1839, during the Republic of Texas era, an exploration group known as the San Saba
Company formed to study the feasibility of opening the area to settlers. Although President Mirabeau B.
Lamar offered his personal approval of the effort, the company apparently made little headway for several
years. In 1843, though, Houston newspapers reported on its status:
The party of gentlemen who left this city a few weeks since, to survey the tract of country
on the head waters (sic) of the San Saba, are returning without effecting the object of the
155

visit. On arriving at Washington [Texas], they were informed by the President that he had
recently sent Commissioners to treat with the Indians in that section, and he feared the
presence of an armed party of whites in that region at this juncture would induce the
Indians to fear that they intended to resume hostilities, and thus the treaty would be
prevented. Satisfied that these objections were reasonable and just, they, with a
commendable forbearance, concluded to relinquish their expedition, although they had
expended a very large sum in preparing for it. (Biesele 1930: 77)
Acting as agent for the company was Henry Francis Fisher, who would figure prominently in the
subsequent colonization effort in the area. In partnership with Burchard Miller and Joseph Baker, he had
helped secure a colonization contract from President Sam Houston the previous year that would have
resulted in the settlement of a thousand families from several countries, including Germany, Switzerland,
Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, between the Llano and Colorado Rivers. Under a September 1843
renewal contract administered by Fisher and Miller, their effort became the San Saba Colonization
Company, which may have been a continuation of the earlier effort. Regardless, Fisher headed to
Germany to recruit settlers. Under the provisions of the second contract, Fisher and Miller proposed to
settle 600 families and single men in an area totaling more than three million acres. Included was much of
what is now San Saba County, as well as other present counties. Due to a series of complications, Fisher
and Miller failed to meet early deadlines of the contract, and they eventually sold their rights to the
Society for the Protection of German Immigrants in Texas, better known as the Adelsverein.
Although the society eventually focused on other areas and consequently settled few colonists in what
was to become San Saba County, the pioneer legal efforts relative to the Fisher-Miller Land Grant paved
the way for future settlement. Equally important was the completion of an 1847 treaty signed not far from
present San Saba between society members, led by John O. Meusebach, and the Comanche. The era of
peace that followed led to increased settlement throughout the region. As a result, by 1860, the Texas
Legislature approved the creation of seven counties from the original grant. The earliest were San Saba,
Llano, and McCulloch, all formally organized in 1856. (Biesele 1930: 78-82 and 157)
The town of San Saba, laid out on land owned by R.D. McAnelly and John H. Brown, soon became the
seat of government for San Saba County. Other early towns in the county included Chappel, which
predated the county seat, as well as Richland Springs, Harkeyville, Cherokee and Bend. San Saba
developed as a major commercial center for a widespread agricultural area. Cotton farming and livestock
production dominated the local economy in the early years, although relatively light commodity levels
failed to warrant the immediate attention of railway companies. As a result, pioneer residents regularly
hauled their goods to Lometa, twenty miles away, until the early twentieth century.
In its formative years, San Saba was located along the state’s frontier line of settlement, and that period of
its history reflected its relative isolation. During the Civil War, the nearby Confederate outpost of Camp
McMillan (about 24 miles northwest of the county seat) provided protection for the area as part of an
extended frontier defense system that reached from the Red River to the Rio Grande. In civil matters,
reaction to lawlessness resulted in the formation of vigilante groups—the most noted being dubbed the
San Saba Mob—that operated without much opposition until the 1890s, when the Texas Rangers, in
cooperation with the local newspaper editor and county attorney, began to shut the activities down. By
1900, local authorities were once again in control. (Texas Historical Commission Marker Files, “The
Texas Rangers and the San Saba Mob” and “Camp McMillan, C.S.A.”)
Despite the relative isolation, San Saba County developed steadily in its first decades of existence.
Citizens erected a two-story courthouse in 1857 and replaced it only a few decades later following a
devastating windstorm that destroyed the structure. The new stone building served the county until
construction of the current courthouse following a 1910 bond election. At the same time, increased
156

agricultural settlement in the county and farther west influenced the development of a rail line through the
area. A Lometa to Eden branch of the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway crossed the county in 1911,
providing both passenger and freight service to the county seat, as well as Richland Springs, Algerita, and
Hall Valley. (San Saba County Historical Commission, 1983: 485-487).
The railroad provided viable markets for local commodities, which in 1920 showed great diversity
through the production and shipping of cotton, poultry, onions, wool and mohair, mussel shells, cedar
posts, livestock, sweet potatoes, and pecans. The latter had not been a major factor in the economy only a
few years earlier, as noted in a 1917 soil survey of the county:
The native pecan trees growing in the alluvial valleys of the perennial streams bear a nut
of high quality and are a considerable source of revenue to landowners. In a few localities
there has been some attempt to improve the native stock by grafting and the cultivation of
selected trees, but the cultivated orchards have not yet attained any considerable
commercial importance. (Veatch, et al, 1917: 14-15)
Within a few short years, however, thanks largely to the pioneering and experimental cultivation efforts
of Edmond E. Risien, a native of England who moved to San Saba in the 1870s, the county became one of
the state’s top producers of pecans. In 1933, the railroad shipped three million pounds of the crop, as
compared to 6,000 bales of cotton and 500,000 pounds of wool. As a result, the town of San Saba has
long billed itself the “Pecan Capital of the World.” Adding to the growing economy in the ensuing years
has been fruit production, stone quarrying, and even tourism, with both fishing and hunting becoming
major draws for the county. (San Saba County Historical Commission, 2002: 269)
Early public education efforts in San Saba County date to the antebellum period in several communities.
There were also a number of subscription and private schools, as well as the San Saba Male and Female
Academy, and the West Texas Normal and Business College (later Cherokee Junior College). Around the
turn of the last century there were more than forty separate schools in the county, but with statewide
consolidation programs that culminated not long after the end of World War II, the number of districts
narrowed to three. (Tyler, 1996: Vol. 5, pp. 877-878)
The county seat of San Saba has experienced a number of setbacks throughout its history, including a
devastating commercial district fire in 1913, a number of floods, most notably one in 1938, and severe
droughts in the 1950s and early twenty-first century. The town reached a peak population of 3,400 shortly
after World War II, and by 2008 there were 2,499 residents. At the time, that number accounted for just
less than half the county’s population. By comparison, the county’s other major town, Richland Springs,
had only about 350 residents. (Tyler, 1996: Vol. 5, pp. 877-878; Alvarez, 2008: 375; City-Data.com,
2010)
Today, just over a century and half after its founding, San Saba County residents proudly celebrate a rich
heritage, which reaches much farther back to prehistoric times. Formally settled only a few decades after
the advent of the first Anglo-American colonies in Texas, the county continues to reflect its ties to the
early Texas frontier. It maintains an active county historical commission, which publishes books,
preserves records, and works to interpret its past through support of historic preservation and historical
markers. In recent years, county officials have also voted to pursue a grant through the Texas Historical
Commission that, if approved, will fund full restoration of the county’s unique 1911 courthouse.
Methodology
The purpose of the survey was to identify all archeological sites within the 46.6 acre tract that might be
impacted by the proposed park development and to assess their potential for designation as State
157

Archeological Landmarks (SALs) using criteria described in Chapter 26 Rules of Practice and Procedures
of the Texas State Antiquities Code. The entire park area was walked over by the survey crew and the
steep banks of the incised streams were inspected for cultural material that might be eroding from deeply
buried deposits. Because nearly the entire survey area lies within an active floodplain, archaeological
material could potentially be buried in any area and at any depth within the alluvium, which can be up to
30 feet deep. Intensive subsurface testing was the primary means of identifying site areas, using shovel
testing, auger testing, and backhoe trenching. The locations of these tests are shown in
Figure 77 and Figure 77. Areas where development is planned were more intensively tested, with the
depth of the tests usually determined by the expected depth of the disturbances, usually less than one
meter. For example, shovel testing along proposed hiking trail routes ended at depths of 40 to 50cm, well
below the expected soil disturbance depth of 8 centimeters.
Both the auger tests and the shovel tests excavated roughly the same size hole, 35 to 40cm in diameter.
The average depth of the auger holes was about 100cm while that of the shovel tests was much less at
around 60cm. The tests were excavated in 20cm levels and all of the fill was screened through a ¼ inch
wire mesh. All chert tools and debitage, bone, whole mussel shells, and mussel shell umbos were
collected and bagged according to level. Small, unidentifiable mussel shell fragments were noted on the
shovel test forms but not collected. Burned rock was weighed and returned to the test hole. A soil profile
was recorded for each test before refilling. Appendix 1 shows the soil profiles of all subsurface tests.
The shovel tests and auger tests were numbered together in the same sequence, totaling 100. Eighty-three
shovel tests were dug, numbered 1 through 16 and 30 through 100. Seventeen auger tests were dug,
numbered 13 through 29.
Eleven backhoe trenches were placed in areas along Mill Creek at locations for anchors of the originally
proposed foot bridges and in the proposed parking area in the southwestern part of the project area. Five
more trenches were placed within the limits of 41SS175, which included some spots along proposed
hiking trail routes. Each of the 16 trenches was about five meters in length and 80cm wide. Depths of the
backhoe trench excavations generally varied between 80 and 140cm. For each trench, a one-meter-wide
section of one of the walls was cleaned with trowels and a soil profile was then drawn on graph paper.
All exposed artifacts and features were plotted on the soil profile. A sample of the fill was screened
through a ¼ inch wire mesh, maintaining roughly 20cm-thick increments of depth. Artifacts were
bagged in the same manner as with the shovel and auger tests. The unsampled portion of the backdirt
was also inspected for cultural material.
All artifacts recovered from screening the shovel tests, auger tests, and trench fill were collected and
taken to the LCRA Archeology Services lab for analysis. Diagnostic artifacts found on the surface were
also collected. All the lithics and prehistoric ceramics collected during the survey will be curated at the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin.
Survey Results
The survey resulted in the recording of six new archeological sites, 41SS175 through 41SS178, and
41SS181 and 41SS182 (Figure 78). Two of the new sites, 41SS176 and 41SS177 have both prehistoric
and historic components (occupations). Three others, 41SS175, 41SS178, and 41SS181 have only
prehistoric components, and one, 41SS182, has only a historic component. The previously-recorded site,
41SS113, was found to have an historic component, in addition to the prehistoric component recorded in
1994.

The soil profiles from the shovel and auger tests are described in Appendix 1. The artifact recovery from
these tests as well as for that of the backhoe trenches is shown in Appendix 2.
The prehistoric components at these sites, except at 41SS181, would traditionally be typed as campsites
by Texas archeologists (see Collins 1995) because they contain hearths and abundant food remains,
mostly mussel shell. Multiple occupations are represented at these campsites with cultural material
recovered from most levels of the tests and trenches. Further testing at 41SS181 would probably also
demonstrate that it too is a prehistoric camp with hearths but at this point it is only known to have mussel
shell and lithics. These prehistoric sites are situated on the terraces overlooking the incised channel of
Mill Creek, except for 41SS175 which extends along the edge of an upper terrace between the creek and
the San Saba River.
The historic component at 41SS176 represents a house site occupied from the late 19th century until the
mid-20th century. In the adjacent streambed lie the remains of an early waterworks that operated in the
last two decades of the 19th century. Site 41SS177 contains the remains of an early 20th century house
built atop a prehistoric burned rock midden. Site 41SS182 consists of a small wastewater treatment
facility that probably operated in the early 20th century based on construction methods and a local
informant (THC Steward Buddy Whitney). The previously-recorded site 41SS113 has a minor historic
component consisting of an early 20th century trash scatter. Each site is described in more detail in the
following paragraphs.
Site Descriptions
41SS175
This prehistoric site is situated on an alluvial terrace in the northern part of the park between the south
side of the San Saba River and the north bank of Mill Creek (Figure 79). These two streams have their
confluence about 300 meters east-southeast of 41SS175. The site area was cleared of mesquite and brush
several years ago by the previous landowner. It is presently an open field covered by various grasses and
western ragweed. Scattered prehistoric materials are visible on ground surface at the eastern edge of the
terrace over an area measuring about 60 meters north-south by 20 meters east-west. Immediately east of
this area, the terrace descends about two meters in elevation down onto a lower alluvial surface that is a
broad floodplain covered with pecan trees.
Prehistoric artifacts seen on ground surface included burned limestone rocks, mussel shell fragments,
chert debitage and tool fragments, and possible ground stone artifacts. One Late Archaic II dart point
fragment was collected as was the medial section of a thin biface. The dart point specimen is of the Darl
type and it had been reworked to the extent that very little of the blade remained. During the initial visit
to the site, a member of the family of the previous landowner brought his artifact collection to the site.
Those artifacts included arrow points of the Scallorn and Perdiz types, another Terminal Archaic point
like the one found by the crew on the site surface, some Late Archaic dart points similar to Ensor and Frio
types, a probable Middle Archaic Bulverde point, and several other untyped dart points. Additionally, the
collection included two perforators and various bifaces and biface fragments. The artifacts in that
collection were mostly found during ground-disturbing activities associated with recent brush clearing.

163

Following pedestrian survey of the area where artifacts were visible on ground surface, five backhoe
trenches, consisting of BHT# 11, and 13-16, were excavated by the LCRA staff in order to aid in
determining the horizontal extent of the site and to search for buried cultural deposits. The backhoe
trenching showed that the site is much larger than the area where surface materials are evident, as buried
prehistoric materials extends for a length of 170 meters on a northwest-southeast line by at least 100
meters on a northeast-southwest line (see Figure 79). Importantly, buried burned rock features were
struck at the south end of the site in Backhoe Trench #11 at 45 to 50 cm below ground surface and at the
northwest end of the site in Backhoe Trench #15 at 70 to 75 cm below ground surface. The ages of these
features are uncertain due to the lack of associated diagnostic artifacts and the fact that no materials useful
for radiocarbon dating were found within the features.
Appendix 2 shows the artifact recovery by 20 cm increments from samples of fill from the five backhoe
trenches. The artifact recovery table shows that on the east-central edge part of the site at BHT #13 and
14, the volume of cultural materials is highest in Levels 1 and 2. The locations of these two trenches
generally coincide with the only areas within the site where cultural materials were evident on ground
surface during the pedestrian survey.
In BHT# 11 at the south end of the site adjacent to Mill Creek, no cultural material was evident on ground
surface or the screened sample of Level 1 fill. The volume of burned rock and mussel shell was highest
in Levels 2 and 3 at BHT #11, and several burned rocks that are part of a burned rock hearth feature were
visible in the backhoe trench wall from 45 to 52 cm below ground surface (Figure 80). A second small
peak in burned rock occurred in Level 5 of BHT #11. Although the number of artifacts drastically
decreased in level 7 at the bottom of the trench, it is possible that deeper components are present.
At the northwestern end of the site where BHT #15 and 16 were excavated, cultural materials first
become evident at about 40 cm below ground surface. As shown in Appendix 2 the burned rock weight
total of 2,700 grams from Level 4 at BHT #15 stood in sharp contrast to the almost total absence of
burned rock in any of the other levels at this backhoe location and at the nearby BHT #16. Significantly,
a cluster of several burned rocks found in the northeast corner wall of BHT #15 at 70 to 75 cm below
ground surface coincides with a sharp increase in the volume of burned rocks recovered in Level 4 of
BHT #15 during the screening of samples of fill from that trench. The low artifact recovery from BHT
#16, which was excavated about 37 meters southwest of BHT #15, suggests that this trench may be near
the western edge of the prehistoric occupation area.
The site is rated as potentially significant due to the presence of intact buried features at that are
associated with lithic debitage and faunal materials. It is also possible that other more deeply buried
cultural zones are present at depths not penetrated by the backhoe trenches. The only proposed park
development elements that are proposed within the 41SS175 site area consist of a hiking trail that will
cross the north and south ends of the site where the tops of the prehistoric materials occur at 40 and 20 cm
below ground surface, respectively. Since the maximum depth of impact associated with the hiking trial
is 8 cm, the site deposits should not be affected by the trail. Furthermore, the trail is not located near the
east-central part of the site where artifacts are visible on ground surface.
41SS176
This site is situated in the southwestern part of the proposed park and extends from the Mill Creek
channel south and westward (see
Figure 78). This multi-component site consists of a
prehistoric campsite component and a historic period component that includes both a house site and the
remains of a water management engineering feature. Based on the excavation of three backhoe trenches

164

Figure 80. Site 41SS175, BHT #11 profile showing burned rock feature at 45 to 52 cm below ground
surface.
and 17 shovel/auger tests, the site appears to cover an area measuring approximately 126 meters east-west
by 100 meters north-south (Figure 81).
Prehistoric Component at 41SS176
Prehistoric materials observed at the site consist of chert tools and debitage along with burned rocks and
numerous mussel shell fragments. The densest prehistoric materials appear to be located on the terrace
overlooking the creek channel in the northeast part of the site. In that area, intact, buried prehistoric
features were found where BHTs #4 and 5 were excavated (see Figure 81). At BHT #4 several burned
rocks were observed in the wall of the trench at depths of 78 to 85 cm below ground surface. Since the
depth of these burned rocks coincided with a dramatic increase in the amount of burned rock (2,375
grams) recovered in the screening of a Level 4 sample of fill, it is probable that a majority of an intact
burned rock feature had been removed by the backhoe bucket. The screened sample of fill from Level 4
also contained a large increase in the number of mussel shell umbos in comparison to the levels above and
below. Shovel Test #10, which had been previously excavated near BHT #4 showed increasing amounts
of burned rock with depth, but since that shovel test was terminated at the end of Level 3, it probably did
not penetrate the cultural zone represented by the probable hearth in BHT #4.
In BHT #5, which was placed at the far east edge of the site about 20 meters east of BHT #4, two dense
mussel shell lenses were observed at depths of 30 to 38 cm below ground surface and at 45 to 50 cm
below ground surface (Figure 82). In the screened sample of Level 2 (20-40 cm) fill from this backhoe
165

Figure 81. Map of 41SS176.

166

trench approximately 100 mussel shell umbos recovered. This total was the highest count of mussel shell
umbos of any backhoe trench levels from the entire project. This large number of mussel shells coincided
with the upper mussel shell lens in the backhoe trench wall. The second, deeper mussel shell lens
correlates with Level 3 which had 51 mussel shell umbos in the screened sample, which is the second
highest count from any backhoe level dug during the entire project.
BHT # 5 was also noteworthy for having the highest recovery of chert debitage of any of the backhoe
trench screened samples and shovel/auger tests with a total of 34 flakes/chips recovered. A relatively
high volume of burned rock also came out of the screened sample from BHT #5 although no feature
outlines were evident in the walls of the trench. A Late Archaic II dart point fragment similar to the
Zephyr and Darl types was found on ground surface in the vicinity of BHT #5. The blade of this dart
point has been extensively reworked.
Two noteworthy surface features present near BHT #5 are two apparent mortar holes that were observed
in the surface of a limestone slab that is shallowly submerged in the bed of Mill Creek (Figure 83). These
features are situated about 15 meters southeast of the backhoe trench.
Elsewhere at site 41SS176, the shovel testing and backhoe trenching produced much lower numbers of
prehistoric artifacts. In particular, BHT #12 about 22 meters northwest of BHT #4, did not produce very
many artifacts nor were any features evident in the walls of that trench.
The survey investigation of the prehistoric component at 41SS176 indicates that potentially significant
prehistoric deposits are present in the eastern part of the site where BHT #4 and 5 were excavated.
Elsewhere at 41SS176, the investigations suggest that prehistoric materials are more sparse and lack any
intact features. Proposed impacts to the prehistoric component consist of the proposed entry road,
parking lot, and observation deck. All of the proposed construction will occur in areas where prehistoric
materials are assessed as not significant. Further, BHT #12 was excavated at the location of the proposed
observation deck with no intact features or significant artifact deposits being found.
Historic Component at 41SS176
The historic component at 41SS176 includes a standing structure that is a small, T-plan, cross-gabled,
rectilinear frame house constructed in multiple phases over a period of years from the late nineteenth
century to the mid-twentieth century. The structure faces south and is located west of Mill Creek. The
two key components are a squared, south-facing front portion with a gabled roof on an east-west axis
(Figure 84) and an ell extension to the rear (north end) of the house that is aligned perpendicular to the
front axis (Figure 85). The ell extension also features a gabled roof, although the ridgeline is several feet
lower than the front portion, tying in along the north side roof slope. A detailed description of the house
with accompanying photographs was provided to the THC on January 21, 2010 in a separate review.
That review document also provided archival data on the nearby water works features describe later in
this section.
The LCRA Archaeology Services staff was assisted by contractor Dan Utley and THC staff member Stan
Graves in documenting and interpreting the construction history of the house at 41SS176. In summary,
they determined that three to five distinct building phases are evident. In its current state, the house
consists of three rooms: a living area, bedroom, and kitchen. It mostly likely began as a one-room
structure, however, with the west side on the main house exhibiting signs of the earliest construction. It is
possible, too, that the original structure once extended further westward, but that part of the house is no
longer present for reasons unknown. Examination of the structure also suggests that the ell extension to
the rear of the house was a later addition to the house, and the porch was likewise added later in time.
Some of these additions possibly utilized salvaged materials from other structures.

Figure 83. View of two apparent mortar holes in limestone bedrock presently submerged by Mill Creek.
As described in the previous report sent to the THC, the house has three different types of exterior walls
which are further indications of various phases of construction additions and modifications. The entry
wall, east wall, and part of the north wall (to its intersection with the entry to the back ell) of the front part
of the house feature balloon framing, with stud walls and clapboard sheathing on half of the southern
exterior. The remaining exterior walls are of both horizontal and vertical board with missing battens.
Wire nails are used throughout most of the house, although cut nails could be found in the ell and along
the entirety of the bottom course of the balloon frame construction, and in certain trim elements such as
exterior window and door frames.
A masonry chimney once anchored the east side of the home (Figure 86), and evidence of the original
limestone chimney foundation, possibly expanded later in footprint with ashlar-cut sandstone blocks of
random size, now extends beyond the outer frame wall (Figure 87).
A variety of construction methods are also evident in the interior of the house. For example, Figure 88,
which was taken from the main body of the house looking back into the kitchen ell, shows box frame
construction on the left of the door and Western frame construction on the right.
The interior chimney hearth has also been modified. Figure 89 shows the former opening for the
chimney. That area has been boxed in, which in effect shows the outside line of the house was extended
at some point. What appears to be the hearthstone at the bottom center of the photo is actually the top of
a concrete slab poured over the hearthstone to a depth of about two inches. At one time, a wood stove
may have been placed on the hearth and vented out through the framed area.

A total of 352 historic period artifacts were recovered from 16 shovel and auger tests and from samples of
fill from 3 backhoe trenches excavated around the vicinity of the house at 41SS176 (see Appendix 3).
The most common historic artifact categories are fragmentary pieces of glass, plain whiteware ceramic
dishes, and scrap metal. Other fairly common artifact categories consist of cut and wire nails. Nineteenth
century artifacts consist of a two-hole shell button, a two-hole bone button, a fragment of dark green
glass, and an amber bottle neck with an applied lip. Twelve other artifacts consisting of one painted
ceramic sherd, four cut nail fragments, four amber colored panel bottle glass fragments, two heavily
patinated glass fragments, and four aqua colored glass fragments probably date from the late nineteenth to
early twentieth centuries. All other historic artifacts appear to date from the early to mid twentieth
centuries. Among the most common twentieth century artifacts are clear glass fragments, scrap metal
fragments, plain whiteware ceramic sherds, and wire nails.
Overall, the historic archaeological remains relating to the house at 41SS176 are assessed as not eligible
for formal designation as a SAL due to the relatively late dates of the vast majority of the artifacts. The
house is assessed as not architecturally significant due to its numerous modifications, and many details
about its history remain uncertain.
Risien Waterworks
In close proximity to the house, and within the channel of Mill Creek, are the elaborate stone remains of
what is believed to be part of the City of San Saba’s original waterworks operation that Edmond E. Risien
and several associates set up in the 1870s. The construction of the dam for the waterworks led one of the
partners, J.H. “Shorty” Brown, to file suit against E.E. Risien. Although Risien ultimately prevailed,
Risien soon abandoned the waterworks and his nearby home for a new one outside the town.
The rockworks in Mill Creek consist of crudely coursed, mortared ashlar limestone masonry. Some
portions of spillways are of poured cement or concrete. Large sandstone and concrete blocks enhance
potions of the spillways. The main dam portion forms an obtuse angle facing upstream, creating a small
pond in a bend of the creek (Figure 90). This pond is channeled in three directions: a cement spillway
along the right bank of the creek; a central, deeply channelized course flanked by a gently curved
limestone wall; and a left bank spillway that enters an enclosure created by two limestone walls meeting
at right angles on the creek bank, with an exit through a reduced opening to join the other two diverted
flows (Figure 91). A semi-circular enclosure about four feet in diameter separates the two rightmost
spillways. Primary flow is through the central channel.
The left bank, right-angled walls join at a point approximately 10 feet above the present water level
(Figure 92). Both are approximately 30 feet in length, and both slope downwards towards the upstream
or downstream end, respectively. The downstream wall has two large openings, about 24 inches tall by
20 inches wide. Both are about 40 inches above the water level. Four inverted “T” notches are present,
in two groups of two. They are about 10 inches tall and three inches wide, and the base is about 8 inches
wide. The sets of two are 30 inches apart, and separated by about four feet. These are in general vertical
alignment with a minimum of two smaller (about 4 x 4 inches) notches in the upstream wall. Two
smaller notches are located in offset position above these by 16 inches, and are about 48 inches above the
water. In combination, these notches suggest a working platform about 3 feet above the water, with two
small openings (doorways?) along the bank, and supports for equipment above the floor.
The curvilinear central wall is about 20 feet in length (see Figure 91). Embedded iron rods are bent at a
steep angle in the downstream direction, and mortar along the top remaining course of stone indicates
severe flood damage. Cement and sandstone blocks along the main dam portion are not representative of
original construction techniques, and likewise indicate repair and possible repurposing of the feature.

173

Figure 90. Right bank portion of dam, looking downstream and generally west. Note house in
background.
The central channel was informally investigated one warm summer evening (Figure 93). It is composed
of solid limestone bedrock that has been excavated to a depth of about four feet below the water level
(perhaps providing stone for the walls). The semi-circular feature is enigmatic, but also appears to be
disrupted (Figure 94). This feature abuts the right bank cement spillway. This cement spillway has two
vertical channels on the upstream side. Perhaps created by the forming process, it seems more likely that
they are intended to act as a support for a gate system. The right bank structure is now a stepwise descent
to the dam.

An unprovenienced newspaper article, entitled “Our City Water Works System” written by E. E. Risien
and provided by Ms. Elsie Millican, partially describes the original water works. Risien places the date of
dam construction as 1883 (rather than 1880). There was a five-foot fall that turned a water wheel which
powered a piston pump. Risien notes that there was no water tower, only the ever-turning wheel
connected to the pump with a bevel gear which could supply steady pressure for a distance of close to one
mile. Risien states the water works operated for 18 years, to between 1898 and 1901. Sanborn maps do
not show the present feature, but the mill at Mill Pond Park is shown in 1885, 1889, and 1894 as J. H.
Brown’s San Saba Mills. In 1902 it is shown as the location of San Saba Water Company.
A pair of undated photographs from Ms. Millican shows an apparent outing of a child, five women and a
man in early twentieth century clothing at what was presumed to be the bathhouses mentioned elsewhere
(Figure 95). The man appears to be engaged in maintenance; however, and the main, right angled
upstream wall looks almost identical to its appearance now. One photograph suggests a tree fall may
have caused wall damage, although it may have been designed that way. A simple shed covers the
interior, left bank pool, and a wooden walkway covers the downstream portion, supported by the central
wall section, which looks taller than at present. A weir or filter grate appears to cover the upstream side
of the left bank chute, and various lateral and vertical support beams are present. An angled metal pipe
runs upward from the back corner to apparently run across the upper terrace. This appears to be a
working assembly, rather than a bathhouse.
A large structure, probably a house, is visible immediately above the main walls on the left bank. It
appears to be much closer to the stream than the present house at 41S176, and based on alignment, has to
be 60 to 80 feet further east than the present house. It is constructed of vertical boards in balloon fashion
with an apparent window centered under the main ridge, which appears to be generally aligned on an
east/west axis. A porch extends off the south side. Attempts to match it with aspects of the house at
41SS176 are inconclusive. It appears to be somewhat larger, and window locations do not match, nor
does the directionality of the wall boards on the corresponding east wall. It is possible, and perhaps even
likely, that portions of this house were recycled into the house presently on site, but the photographic
information is too vague to make any conclusive statements.

Since the waterworks features retain much of their integrity and represent an interesting set engineering
features relating to early historic period water management technology, the portion of the site containing
these features is assessed as meriting formal designation as an SAL. LCRA proposes to preserve the
waterworks features. Additionally, as a part of the park development plan, the history of the waterworks
and its physical remains will be highlighted with signage on viewing platforms on the top of the terrace
edges.
41SS177
This multicomponent site extends for a length of approximately 180 meters on a north-south line on the
east side of Mill Creek (Figure 96). The maximum width of the site occurs in the southern half of the site
where it is about 110 meters wide on an east-west line. Previous construction of an elevated railroad
track on an east-west line through the center of the site has somewhat damaged a 25 to 30 meter wide
strip.
A prehistoric burned rock midden feature is located in the southwestern part of the site. Much burned
rock and dark stained soil is visible on ground surface on the two foot high elevated surface manifestation
of the midden. This surface mounded area, which measures about 9 meters east-west by 7 meters north178

south, is probably the central part of the midden with buried portions of the midden feature extending
outwards in all directions. For example, the excavation of ST #13 about 13 meters southwest of the
center of this mounded area struck a dense lens of burned rock that represents a buried part of the midden
at depths of 40 to 70 cm below ground surface. Approximately 5,000 grams of burned rock were
removed from Level 3 of that shovel test and 1900 grams was removed from Level 4, the deepest level
excavated. As shown in Appendix 2, the volume of mussel shell umbos and lithic debitage also increased
in Levels 3 and 4 in comparison to Levels 1 and 2. Artifacts recovered from ST #13 also became more
numerous in Levels 3 and 4. A small aboriginal ceramic sherd was recovered from ST 29 in Level 3. In
ST 16 an arrow point was recovered from Level 1.
The top of a lens of burned rock burned rock was also struck at the bottom of Level 3 of ST #16, which is
located 25 meters northeast of the center of the burned rock midden. Excavation of the shovel test was
terminated when the burned rock lens was encountered. Although it is probable that the burned rock lens
is the top of an individual hearth, it is conceivable that it represents a northward continuation of the buried
portion of the burned rock midden feature. The burned rock lens coincides with the highest counts of
lithic debitage and mussel shell umbos from the shovel test.
North of the railroad tracks at the north end of the site, another burned rock feature was found in the wall
of BHT #3 at about 70 cm below ground surface. The portion of the feature evident in the trench wall
extended for a length of 20 cm. The excavation of several shovel tests east of BHT #3 showed that the
site extended about 30 meters east of that trench.
Other shovel and auger tests that were excavated to help define the limits of the site include STs #38 and
39, which were positive shovel tests that indicate that the site extends at least 100 meters east of the
burned rock midden and probably even further eastward beyond the east boundary of the park. Auger
tests #28 and 29, along with ST #31 and BHT #6 aided in defining the south boundaries of the site.

In addition to the LCRA survey level investigations, numerous prehistoric artifacts have been previously
seen in the portion of the site within the railroad ROW years ago when a trench was excavated for a small
diameter wastewater pipeline. That pipeline was proposed for a new home on the south side of the
railroad ROW that was not ever built. An informant observed that numerous burned rock features that lay
from 30 to 60 cm below ground surface were exposed by the pipeline trenching. These features were
seen beneath the elevated railroad bridge trestle and for a length of about 15 meters southward within the
railroad ROW. The vast majority of diagnostic artifacts that the informant saw in association with those
features are typical of the Toyah Phase of the Late Prehistoric era. Specific artifacts included Perdiz
arrow points, beveled knives, end scrapers, and flake drills. Bone-tempered plain pottery and some
incised sherds were also found, as were bison and deer bones. Additionally, a stone hearth with ash was
observed at depths of six to seven feet below ground surface in the portion of the pipeline trench dug
north of the railroad ROW. This last feature, which is situated within what is now LCRA property, must
represent an earlier prehistoric component.

Based on the data gathered during the survey and the information provided by a local informant, the
prehistoric component at 41SS177 is assessed as potentially eligible for formal designation as a SAL.
The historic component at site 41SS177 represents a former house site that is located on top of the burned
rock midden. The only remaining standing structural feature of the former house is a chimney that
extends to a height of about 14 feet above ground surface (Figure 97). This feature along with a scatter of
large sandstone and limestone foundation stones suggests that the house was purposefully erected directly
on top of the above ground-mounded part of the burned rock midden feature. The large size and excellent
craftsmanship of these foundation stones suggests that they may have been salvaged from an existing
building in San Saba. Their arrangement on the ground covers an area measuring about 30 feet on a
north-south line by 20 feet on an east-west line.

Figure 97. LCRA archaeologist recording information on 41SS177. Note the collapsed firebox on the
chimney. The house at the site was most likely constructed free of the nearby oak tree, but the tree has
since grown over the site, providing a covering canopy above the chimney. It is believed the house
extended eastward to the foreground, with the primary façade to the south (left) in the general vicinity of
where the archaeologist is standing.
Historic artifacts seen on the ground and recovered in shovel tests mostly consist of fragmentary pieces of
glass, scrap metal, and wire nails. The vast majority of these historic artifacts appear to date to the early
to mid 20th century. Of the 73 glass fragments, there are three aqua colored and purple (solarized)
specimens that may date to the late 19th century. All other glass fragments are either nondiagnostic or date
to the 20th century. The nails consist of 2 cut nails that probably date to the late 19th century and 22 wire
nails that date to the 20th century.
Archival research and oral history interviews were conducted by Utley on the historic period occupation
of site 41SS177. Utley determined that the land that includes 41SS177 was owned by John H. “Shorty”
181

Brown, one of the founders of San Saba, from 1866 to his death in 1896. However, Brown’s home was
not located within the LCRA park property. Deed/title research indicates that 6.25 acres that includes site
41SS177 was carved out of the Brown estate in 1904 and sold to O. D. Kirkpatrick at a price that suggests
that there were likely improvements (probably the former house) on the property at the time of the sale.
The property then changed owners frequently for about two decades with family owners associated the
tract including the Faver, Abbott, Oliver, Halden, Bolton, and Stafford families.
A tangible physical element associated with one of the early 20th century families who occupied the house
site is a set of names written on a smooth stone on the back side of the standing chimney (
Figure 98). Utley determined that these are a list of the Oliver family children. Utley’s research showed
that Alex and Mary Oliver owned the property from 1904 -1905 to 1908, and that the names on the
backside of the chimney are those of 10 of the Oliver children. The Oliver family then moved to
McCulloch County in 1908 and later further northwestward to Foard County. In subsequent years, five or
six additional children were born to the family.

Figure 98. Close-up view of one of the chimney stones on back side of chimney showing the handwritten names of the Oliver family children.
In 1928, E. Guy Risien acquired the property and he began to use the structure as housing for families
who were employed as workers for his pecan business. Mrs. Flossie Kelley Woodward, who lived in the
house briefly as a child in the early 1950s remembered that the house was a small frame residence of
three or four rooms. She recalled a kitchen, living area, two bedrooms, and a sleeping porch. The house
was likely demolished in the 1960s.
The stone chimney noted earlier is the remaining feature associated with the house. Although it exhibits
some measure of craftsmanship in the use of squared stones, a large, smoothed lintel stone, and textured
patterning utilizing limestone and sandstone blocks, the chimney is of minimal construction. It has a
shallow firebox only one or two stones deep in the back; there is no separate brick firebox as might be
expected of a more permanent fixture. The structure has suffered from considerable settling and spalling
182

over the years, in part due to missing mortar or the inappropriate use of Portland cement as patching
material in the past. Measureable deterioration has occurred even in recent months as the site has been
under investigation as several stones have fallen out of the side wall of the firebox. Because a large tree
root is slowly causing the foundation shift, the structure leans precariously and poses an immediate safety
risk (Figure 99).

Figure 99. Side view of chimney at 41SS177 showing current precarious forward tilt of the feature.
In summary, the historic component is a former house that most likely was constructed in the early
twentieth century. Inscribed names associated with the Alexander and Mary Oliver family that owned the
property from 1904 to 1907 provide solid evidence of occupation by that time at the earliest. No
conclusive evidence of the size and configuration of the home is known to exist, although oral sources
indicate it was a small frame structure of minimal construction. While it was occupied in its early years
by owner families, it served as rental property by the mid-twentieth century and was evidently razed
several decades ago.
The historical research associated with this report provides an overview of the associated families, and no
further archival work is recommended. The historic period artifact assemblage overwhelmingly consists
of artifacts that date from the early to middle twentieth century and because of the relatively late date and
lack of diversity of materials, the historic archaeological component is assessed as not eligible for formal
designation as a SAL. Similarly, the chimney is assessed as not SAL eligible due to its minimal
construction and its poor state of preservation.

41SS178
This prehistoric campsite is located on an alluvial terrace within a bend of Mill Creek with the curving
creek channel being located to the east, north, and west sides of the site (Figure 100). Mill Creek has its
confluence with the San Saba River about 275 meters to the east of the center of the site. Most of the site
area is currently an open field that is grown up in mesquite and brush. The terrace edges and slopes that
descend to the deeply entrenched creek channel are wooded with large pecan, oak, and elm trees.
Aside from an occasional artifact seen in the roots of fallen trees or in eroded areas on the terrace slopes,
there are no prehistoric materials visible on ground surface. To further examine the terrace deposits
within the bend of the creek, a series of auger tests and backhoe trenches were excavated. In total, 12
auger and shovel tests and 2 backhoe trenches were excavated. These subsurface tests showed that the
site extends for a length of about 105 meters north-south by 75 meters east-west.
Backhoe trenches #1 and 2 were excavated on the east edge of the site on the terrace edge overlooking
Mill Creek. In BHT #1, a burned rock feature was observed in the walls of the trench at a depth of about
50 cm below ground surface (Figure 101). Approximately 3,000 grams of burned rock was recovered
during the screening of a sample of fill from Level 3, the level in which the feature occurred. BHT #1
was also noteworthy for having the highest yields of debitage and larger bone fragments from any single
level excavated during the entire survey. Some of these bone fragments are the remains of large
mammals, probably bison.
At BHT #2, which was placed approximately 30 meters south of BHT#1, moderate amounts of burned
rock were found in the upper 60 cm of deposits, but no evidence of any actual burned rock features was
seen. The numbers of artifacts in all other categories were also lower in BHT #2 than in BHT #1.
Shovel Test #30, which was excavated about midway between these two backhoe trenches yielded a
moderate amount of burned rock. In ST #32, which was excavated about 20 meters south of BHT #2, an
apparent burned rock hearth feature was struck at about 70 cm below ground surface. Artifacts yields
were lower in ST # 18, 19, and 33 which all occur within the southern edge of the site.
About 50 meters west of BHT #1, Auger Test #19 hit the top of an apparent burned rock feature at depths
of 59 to 61 cm. Although few artifacts were recovered from the screening of fill from this auger test, the
presence of an apparent intact feature suggests that higher yields of artifacts are probably present in the
vicinity of this feature.
Based on these subsurface tests, it appears that the densest cultural materials are located in the
northeastern part of the site where BHT #1 and Auger Test #19 were excavated. Moderate amounts of
artifacts and features are also present south of BHT #1 along the east edge of the site. Cultural materials
were found throughout the 100 cm deep subsurface tests, and it is possible that other materials may be
present all greater depths. Due to the presence of intact buried features and indications of stratified
cultural deposits, the prehistoric materials at 41SS178 are assessed as potentially eligible for formal
designation as a SAL.
41SS181
This prehistoric terrace site is located on the left side of Mill Creek 440 meters upstream from its
confluence with the San Saba River. The river meanders less than 90 meters to the north of the site area.

184

Both streams have deeply incised into the surrounding sediments in an otherwise fairly level floodplain.
The site is situated 20 feet or more in elevation above the incised creek channel. Riparian woods grow

along the terrace slope while the level area between the creek and river has apparently been cleared in the
past for agriculture. At the time of the survey the site was covered by waist
waist-high
high grass and forbs.
The site deposits appear to be completely buried and were detected by shovel testing along the proposed
hiking trail route that runs along the north side of Mill Creek north of the railroad ROW. However
because of the poor ground visibility, surface cultural material cannot be ruled out. Shovel Test #45,
placed a few meters north of the terrace slope, recovered a single mussel shell umbo between 20 and
40cm, the depth at which the test end. Shovel Test #46, placed 30 meters west northwest of ST #45,
recovered one mussel shell umbo and one chert flake between
between 0 and 20cm, and five mussel shell umbos
and one biface fragment between 20 and 40cm. No artifacts were recovered from 40cm down to 60cm
where the test ended.

186

Other shovel tests placed along the proposed hiking trail to the east of ST #45 and to the west of ST #46
recovered no obvious artifacts. The northern limits of the site were not established however it is unlikely
that the site extends much further in that direction which is away from the creek. Therefore the site area
appears to be quite small. Artifact density is apparently low but on par with that of the other terrace sites
in the park. Most of the cultural material lies below 20cm and consists of mussel shell umbos. The upper
20cm of soil is presumed to be disturbed by plowing but further testing would be needed to determine if
the deposits below the plow zone meet the requirements for SAL eligibility.
41SS182
This historic site represents the remains of a wastewater treatment facility that probably was in operation
during the early to mid 20th century. It is located near the west side of the park immediately south of the
railroad ROW. It consists of two features. The principal feature is a concrete tank with an attached drain
field retained by a low concrete wall (Figure 102). A second feature consists of a partially buried pile of
concrete rubble 30 feet west of the concrete tank. Thirty meters south of these features is a linear
depression that drains eastwards towards Mill Creek. An abandoned pecan orchard extends southwards
from the depression.
The concrete tank is completely buried with only the upper surface visible more or less flush with the
surrounding ground. The top of the tank measures 33 feet east to west and 13 feet north to south. It has
four rectangular openings, two of which have small hackberry trees growing out of them (Figure 103).
Through these holes, the tank can be seen to be divided into two chambers by two parallel baffles or
interior walls. Two 4-inch clay pipes enter the west chamber from the top surface and a smaller metal
pipe exits the east chamber 15 inches below the tank’s top and enters the drain field. The bottom of the
tank is filled with broken concrete, tree branches, leaves, and a few pieces of modern trash leaving a gap
between it and the ceiling of four feet. Because of the amount of debris the true depth of the tank could
not be measured.
The drain field is connected to the east end of the tank and is enclosed by a low concrete retaining wall.
Its interior dimensions measure 40 feet east to west and 13 to 16 feet north to south. The ground within is
sunken approximately 15 inches from the top of the retaining wall. The drain field surface is covered
with debris, mostly rotting tree branches and some recent trash. A shovel probe placed in the drain field
encountered dirt and debris down to depth of 30cm where the probe ended.
Attached to the outside east wall of the drain field is a water-filled concrete vat opened at the top and
measuring 36 inches east to west, 33 inches north to south, and 19 inches deep on the exterior. A second,
deeper concrete box rests catty cornered on top of the lower vat. This one is empty and measures 36
inches by 31 inches and 22 inches deep in the interior. A concrete lid that appears to go on the upper box
lies on the ground immediately to the north. The purpose of the boxes is unknown.
The concrete used in this feature is made from Portland cement mixed with coarse sand and small gravels.
No inscriptions were seen anywhere on the concrete surface and no artifacts were seen in the vicinity
other than modern trash. A shovel test (ST #96) was placed 10 meters west of the tank and four meters
south of the cement rubble pile. It reached a depth of 45cm without recovering any artifacts. The rubble
pile measures about 5 feet across and is mostly buried. It contains large chunks of concrete similar to that
used in wastewater facility.

No informants with knowledge of the dates of the usage of the features could be found, although regional
THC Steward Buddy Whitney was able to determine it probably operated from between about 1900 to the
mid 1920s, and was probably San Saba’s first wastewater treatment facility. Site 41SS182’s potential to
provide any new or interesting data about wastewater treatment plant technologies remains unknown
pending any future investigations. At present no park development or use is planned for this area.
41SS113
This prehistoric campsite was originally recorded by Daniel Fox (1994), during a survey for a proposed
wastewater pipeline that was to be placed parallel to an existing pipeline just north of the railroad ROW.
The site is located on the west side of Mill Creek immediately north of the deep slough that was
excavated years ago to provide fill for the elevated railroad bed (Figure 104). At the site, Fox noted
chipped stone debris, burned rocks, and mussel shells along the terrace edge overlooking Mill Creek in
the vicinity of the previously constructed sewer pipeline. The site was estimated to cover a horizontal
area of 40x50 meters and the depth of cultural deposits was estimated to be 2 meters. The site was rated
as potentially significant, and further impacts were avoided by continuing usage of the existing pipeline
for the wastewater flows within the perceived site boundaries as opposed to building a new pipeline.
During the current survey, the site was revisited and further investigated (Figure 104). Pedestrian survey
showed very few artifacts on ground surface, although one of those artifacts is a Late Archaic dart point
of the Frio type. Some historic period trash debris dating from the early to late twentieth century was
found within and around the edges of a cluster of oak trees north of the area recorded by Fox. According
to the previous landowner, he and others have used that area through time to dump bricks, mortar, old car
parts, and other miscellaneous debris.
Since one of the originally proposed footbridges over Mill Creek was to be anchored on the terrace within
the prehistoric site, BHT #9 was excavated at this proposed location early during the field project (Figure
105). The soil profile showed that the upper 20 to 30 cm of soil deposits were disturbed fill that is
probably the result of the previous excavation of the nearby wastewater pipeline. Artifacts recovered
from the first two levels of the sample of backdirt from the trench mostly consisted of historic period
debris including a tobacco tin, several small metal fragments, and a glass bottle base. Some small bone
fragments found in these levels could be prehistoric or historic. Several mussel shell fragments, the other
major artifact category from these levels, appear to be of prehistoric origin.
The screened soil samples from deeper levels of backhoe trench fill contained undisturbed prehistoric
artifacts, principally burned rocks, mussel shells, and a few bone fragments. In particular, the volume of
burned rock in levels 3-5 was high, and an apparent burned rock hearth feature was evident in the
backhoe trench wall at 70 to 75 cm below ground surface. Importantly, too, some charcoal fragments
were recovered in the screened sample in that level, making this the only burned rock feature to have any
potential for radiocarbon dating.
The site was visited at a later date to get a better handle on the horizontal extent of the buried prehistoric
deposits. At that time, ST #99 was placed 30 meters north of the BHT #9 location. The test recovered
one chert spall in the upper 20cm of soil and one chert flake fragment and a mussel shell umbo between
20 and 40cm. The test continued to depth of 80cm without recovering more artifacts. The soil profile
showed no obvious signs of disturbance. A large pile of limestone rubble covering an area 40 meters
north to south and 20 meters east to west is located a short distance north of this shovel test. The cultural
deposits of 41SS113 probably extend into the sediments underlying the rubble.

Shovel Test #100 was placed 40 meters west of BHT#9 in a thicket of small saplings. A square wooden
post stands in the ground six meters to the west. Several whole mussel shell halves were noted on the
surface in this area. The test recovered one to two mussel shell umbos and one to two small burned rocks
in each of the three 20cm level between 20 and 80 cm below surface. The test was not dug deeper than
80cm. These tests show that buried prehistoric cultural deposits extend northwards from the slough for a
distance of at least 60 meters and westwards for a distance of at least 50 meters. In addition to the
prehistoric cultural material, several aqua and amethyst bottle glass fragments were noted in the dirt road
that runs along the west edge of the site. A partially buried concrete U-shaped feature can be seen
immediately east of the road.
Due to the discovery of an apparent buried burned rock feature in BHT #9, the prehistoric component is
assessed as potentially eligible for formal designation as an SAL. Due to finds in BHT #9, the location of
the proposed footbridge that would be anchored within the site deposits was moved elsewhere. The
historic component at 41SS113 primarily consists of early to late twentieth century trash dump materials,
and this component is assessed as not SAL eligible.

Conclusions and Recommendations
Six new cultural resource sites, consisting of 41SS175-178, 41SS181, and 41SS182, and one previously
recorded site, 41SS113, were investigated during the San Saba River Nature Park Survey. Prehistoric
materials are evident at all sites except 41SS182. Buried, burned rock features were found at sites
41SS113 and 41SS175-178 during backhoe trenching and shovel testing associated with the current
survey. Two buried, mussel shell midden-like features were also found at site 41SS176. All of these
features were observed within the upper meter of soil deposits, but there are possibilities that more deeply
buried features could be present at depths not penetrated by the current subsurface investigations. In fact,
an informant has stated that a buried, burned rock feature was previously seen at depths of two meters
below ground surface in the northern part of site 41SS177 during the excavation of a pipeline trench.
The buried, burned rock features observed at these prehistoric sites appear to have been preserved due to
alluvial deposition of silty clay loam sediments during overbank flooding of the San Saba River and Mill
Creek. The presence of these intact features below ground surface strongly suggests that the prehistoric
191

components at these five sites have a good contextual integrity of deposits. It is also possible that intact
buried features are present in untested parts of the sixth prehistoric site, 41SS181.
The large number of mussel shells evident at all prehistoric sites is a second striking aspect of the
prehistoric components, and poses a potential research question involving the use of river mussels as a
food source. The mussel shells could also be used in carbon isotope studies for insights on climatic
changes through time.
Additionally, the prehistoric component at site 41SS177 includes a burned rock midden feature along
with an area containing a high density of Toyah Phase artifacts as indicated by the collections of a local
resident. The above ground central part of the burned rock midden has probably been damaged by
historic period activities associated with a historic period house that was constructed on that area around
1900. However, shovel testing indicates that undisturbed buried portions of the midden are present from
40 to 70 cm below ground surface approximately 13 meters southwest of the center of the midden.
Further investigation of the buried parts of the midden could potentially provide subsistence data, while
further exploration of areas beyond the edges of the midden could provide data about off-midden
activities.
The previously collected Toyah Phase materials from 41SS177 mostly come from the railroad ROW,
which is not actual LCRA property. According to an informant, intact hearths, ceramics, and wellpreserved bone are all present within the Toyah component. The recovery of a Perdiz point in ST #16 just
south of the railroad ROW indicates that at least a part of that component extends into LCRA property.
Elsewhere single Late Archaic II Period dart points were found at sites 41SS113, 41SS175, and 41SS176.
To conclude, the prehistoric components at sites 41SS113, 41SS175-178, and 41SS181 are all assessed as
potentially meriting formal designation as State Archeological Landmarks. According to current park
development plans, potentially significant prehistoric deposits at site 41SS178 may be affected by the
proposed construction of one of the footbridges. The area of concern is situated in the vicinity of the
previously excavated BHT #1 and 2 and ST #30, 75, and 76. After the final location and methods for the
footbridge construction have been determined, LCRA will consult with the THC on the need for any
further investigations in this area before construction starts. Additionally, the proposed construction of
the hiking trail appears to have some potential to damage potentially significant prehistoric deposits
within sites 41SS177 and 41SS178. However, the ground disturbance associated with the trail
construction should be confined to the upper 8 cm of soil deposits. At 41SS177, much of the proposed
trail may follow at existing dirt road where the upper cultural deposits have been previously damaged by
vehicular traffic and the previous construction of a wastewater pipeline. Other parts of the proposed trail
within 41SS177, principally in the southwest part of the site near the burned rock midden, have a greater
potential to damage intact cultural deposits. At 41SS178, the artifact returns were highly variable from
the uppermost level of various shovel and auger tests. LCRA proposes to monitor the construction of the
trail through 41SS177 and 41SS178 as a further assessment of prehistoric deposits.
The four sites that contain historic components consist of 41SS113, 41SS176, 41SS177, 41SS182. At
41SS176 and 41SS177 historic period house site remains are present. Features associated with the
residential occupations consist of a standing three-room house at 41SS176 and the chimney of the former
house at 41SS177. The artifacts found at around the two house areas primarily consist of ones that date
from the early to mid twentieth centuries. A few artifacts at each of the house sites could date to the very
late nineteenth century.
One informant has stated that Edmond E. Risien, the well-known father of the pecan industry, occupied
the house at 41SS176 during the 1880s. There are no written records to collaborate this information.
Physical characteristics suggest that portions of the house could date as early as the late nineteenth
192

century and it is known from informants that it was later occupied by a number of families until the 1950s
or 1960s. The location of this house does not appear to match the house shown in the historic photograph
that is Figure 23 in this report. Further, the house in the photograph has wide vertical boards on its east
side and also has a window on the northeast part of the east wall. The current house has narrower,
horizontal boards on its east side with a window in the southeast part of the east wall rather than in the
northeast half. The current house is situated in a flood prone area and appears to have undergone three to
five construction modification phases. As stated in a previous report sent on the house at 41SS176 that
was sent to the THC in January 2010, the structure is assessed as not architecturally significant, and the
details of its early history remain uncertain. The house and its associated archeological deposits are not
eligible for formal designation as an SAL.
Site 41SS176 also includes a set of unusual mortared stonework features in the bed of the adjacent Mill
Creek channel. Archival research indicates that these features are the original waterworks for the City of
San Saba, and that Edmond E. Risien and several associates constructed them sometime between 1880
and 1883. The facility was in operation until sometime between 1898 and 1901. A wooden structure that
stood on a part of the stonework foundations is no longer present. A review of historic photographs
indicates that some of the stone walls once stood higher. The features retain enough integrity, however,
to merit formal designation as an SAL. LCRA proposes to preserve the waterworks features.
Additionally, as a part of the park development plan, the history of the waterworks and its physical
remains will be highlighted with signage on viewing platforms on the top of the terrace edges.
The house that stood at a second site, 41SS177, is no longer present. The historic period archeological
deposits associated with the house appear to date predominantly to the early twentieth century, and are
not considered eligible for formal designation as an SAL. The 14 foot high chimney associated with the
structure is still standing, and has some interpretative potential as a part of the park development project
particularly in conjunction with the burned rock midden feature upon which it sits. However, in its
current state the chimney presents an immediate threat to public safety. Deterioration, including the loss
of stones, continues to advance rapidly, and any effort to stabilize the remaining elements would not
prevent the overriding safety concerns. It would also present other problems associated with security of
and limited access to the site. Therefore, the LCRA proposes to dismantle the vast majority of the
chimney. Only the chimney foundation and the lower, stable parts of the chimney firebox would be left
intact. Signage placed near the remaining part of the chimney could be used to tell the story of the
historic occupation and the research undertaken on the signed Oliver stone. That stone might be donated
to a local museum, if one exists, for use in a protected exhibit.
The other two historic components are found at sites 41SS113 and 41SS182. The historic component at
41SS113 is an apparent trash dump that mostly consists of concrete and limestone rubble, bricks, and old
car parts dating from the early to late twentieth century. This historic component does not appear to have
any research potential, and it is assessed as not eligible for formal designation as an SAL. Site 41SS182
represents the remains of an old wastewater treatment plant that probably dates to about 1900 and was
reportedly San Saba’s first such facility. The two principal features are a subsurface concrete tank and an
attached drain field. Shovel testing within and around the features produced no artifacts. No inscriptions
that would aid in dating the features were found in the concrete. Site 41SS182’s potential to provide any
new or interesting data about wastewater treatment plant technologies remains unknown. No park
development or use is planned for this area, so no additional investigations are felt to be necesary at this
time.

Cooperative’s Proposed Beback Substation in Hays County, Texas

Introduction
The Bluebonnet Electric Cooperative is proposing to build a new electrical substation south of San
Marcos in Hays County (Figure 106). The proposed construction site, which covers a little less than three
acres, is located adjacent to the north side of Be Back Inn Road, hence the name of the new facility, the
Beback Substation. The area is currently used as pasture and was probably cropland at one time (Figure
107). Thirty meters north of the construction site is a 13-acre reservoir created by the damming of a small
first-order tributary creek that loops around the west and north sides of the project area. The stream
channel originates 800 meters to the southwest.
The Bluebonnet Cooperative was required to obtain a Comprehensive Site Preparation Permit from the
City of San Marcos because the construction site lies within what is considered a floodplain in the city’s
Extraterritorial Jurisdiction (ETJ). Part of the permit application required a Statement of No Impact to
archeological sites, necessitating an archeological survey. The Cooperative requested that the LCRA do
this survey since the LCRA’s Transmission Services Corporation (TSC) will be constructing the facility.
LCRA’s Archeology Services staff conducted an intensive archeological survey of the project area on
February 25, 2010. The crew consisted of Charles Hixson and Patrick Hatten, archeologists contracted to
the LCRA. Charles Hixson served as Principal Investigator and the work was conducted under the
LCRA’s Texas Antiquities Permit #5528.
Environmental Background
Geology and Soils
The project area lies within the northern Blackland Prairie ecoregion, a narrow band of rolling grassland
running in a north- south direction between the Edwards Plateau, Limestone (Lampasa) Cut Plains, and
Cross Timbers on the west and the Post Oak Savannas on the east (Griffith et al. 2004). The region has
long been recognized in Texas for its distinct black soils and its suitability for agriculture.
The proposed Beback Substation area is underlain by chalk and marls of the Cretaceous-age Pecan Gap
Chalk formation. It consists of chalk in its lower part and grades upwards to chalky marl. This formation
contains abundant Exogyra ponderosa, a fossil oyster, examples of which are scattered across the project
area.
Like most of the upland areas of the Prairie, the surface soils are dark and clayey. In the project area,
these soils formed on the weathered marls of the Pecan Gap Chalk formation. According to the soils map
produced by the United States Soil Conservation Service (Batte 1984), the project area is nearly entirely
covered by the Houston Black series, a series being the lowest category in the system of soil classification
used by the National Cooperative Soil Survey. Small areas of Heiden series might be present in the
lower areas down slope. Houston Black soils typically have a surface zone of very dark gray clay 50
inches thick and a lower zone of grayish brown clay 27 inches thick. They overlie the little-altered parent
material of yellow marly clay with common soft masses of calcium carbonate. Heiden soils have a 13inch thick surface horizon of dark grayish brown clay that overlies 14 inches of grayish brown clay. The
parent material is a pale yellow shaly clay.
The implications for archeology
The soils found within the project area formed on 65 million year old deposits and any cultural material,
no matter the age, was originally deposited on the surface. However, there are natural processes by

215

Figure 106. Project area shown on portion of the San Marcos South USGS 7.5’ quad.

216

which cultural material can be incorporated into these soils creating, in effect, buried archeological sites.
Houston Black is a classic Vertisol and such soils are known to develop deep wide cracks when dry
through which small surface artifacts can fall to lower depths within the soil (Holliday 2004). In addition,
Vertisols become extremely plastic when wet leading to soil movement and the formation of gilgais, a
superficial microrelief of ridges and swales (Waters 1996). Surface objects can be rapidly buried as deep
as two meters by soil movement associated with gilgai (Perttula 2004). Artificial disturbances such as
plowing can result in the vertical as well as horizontal movement of artifacts. Whether by natural or
artificial means, burial of cultural material in these soils results in a distortion of their behavioral and
temporal associations.

Vegetation
.
The Blackland Prairie is considered one of the most altered ecoregions in the state with nearly all
available land used as cropland or prepared pasture (Diamond 2010). Before Anglo-American settlement,
the region was a grassland. Common grass species in the uplands included little bluestem (Schizachyrium
scoparium), big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii), Indian grass (Sorghastrum nutans), and tall dropseed
(Sporobolus asper).
Vegetation seen during the survey was limited to low forbs with grasses mostly dormant or absent.
Herbaceous species observed were dried silverleaf nightshade and dandelions in bloom. The only woody
217

vegetation in the project area was a low spiny deciduous shrub probably representing a small mesquite
tree.
Historic Background
The project area lies within two miles of the Camino Real, also known as the King’s Highway and Old
San Antonio Road. The Camino Real was a network of roads and paths used by the Spanish that ran
from the Rio Grande River northeastwards into east Texas. The basic routes of this road system were laid
out during Spanish expeditions to Texas beginning in the late 1600s. In 1691, the Teran-Massanet
expedition crossed the San Marcos River below the Balcones Escarpment while searching for an easier
route to the newly-established missions in East Texas. The expedition encountered large numbers of
Indians from west Texas and south of the Rio Grande who had gathered at the river to hunt and trade with
other Indian groups (Foster 1995). Eighteen years later in 1709, the Espinosa-Olivares-Aguirre
expedition crossed the river in the same area during a reconnaissance to the Colorado River.
The Spanish were interested in placing a mission on the San Marcos River as early as 1729. In 1755, a
mission and presidio were finally established on the river but they lasted less than a year. A second
attempt to settle of the area was made in 1808 when 80 people from San Antonio were moved to the river
crossing (Greene 2010). The settlement was abandoned after fours because of flooding and Indian
attacks.
Anglo-American settlement of the San Marcos area began in 1846 when Thomas McGehee built a
homestead at San Marcos Springs (Greene 2010). Other early settlers were former members of John C.
Hays Texas Rangers, including William Moon. Their settle eventually became the town of San Marcos,
which was named the county seat in 1848 when Hays County was formed from portions of Travis
County. Over the next 14 years the county gained and loss land from neighboring counties. The borders
were stable from 1862 until a 1955 resurvey added portions of Travis County.
Prehistoric Background
The current project is located within the Blackland Prairie subregion of central Texas. This subregion
more or less forms the easternmost part of the Central Texas Archeological Region as defined by Prewitt
(1981) and Brown et al. (1982). Suhm (1960) extends the boundaries eastwards to include the Post Oak
Savanna, but many researchers now consider this environmental subregion a separate archeological
region (Fields 1995). These archeological regions are defined by shared traits, such as projectile point
styles, and the Post Oak Savanna points are sufficiently different from the central Texas types to justify
being a separate archeological region. Projectile point forms from both archeological regions occur in the
Blackland Prairie, but the clear majority represent central Texas styles such Pedernales, Montell, and
Ensor. Projectile point styles common to the Post Oak savanna, such as Gary, Yarbrough, and Kent,
occur less frequently in the Prairie. Sometimes the same site will have central Texas points from one
period along with Post Oak Savanna points from another period demonstrating that interactive spheres
changed over time (Mahoney et al. 2003).
It is unlikely that any human group ever foraged exclusively within the Blackland Prairie, perhaps in part
because of low food resources but also because hunter-gatherer territories tend to encompass large areas.
There is also the advantage of locating territories along ectones where two or more environmental regions
can be exploited (Shafer and Bryant 1976). Groups who visited the interior of the Blackland Prairie
where the current project is located probably included the nearby Balcones Canyonlands within their
subsistence sphere. From the projectile point evidence mentioned above, it appears that the Prairie was
used more intensely by groups to west.

218

Most of the information used to create the chronological frameworks proposed for central Texas has come
from stratified sites in the Blackland Prairie (Prewitt 1981), Balcones Canyonlands (Johnson 1995), and
the Lampasas Cut Plains (Collins 1998). Although these frameworks have been used to serve all the
Central Texas Archeological Region, they appear especially appropriate here because they are based on
information gathered relatively close to the current project area. The Collins (1998) chronology is a
refinement of the one proposed by Johnson and Goode (1995) which is derived from earlier ones such as
Prewitt’s (1981). All these frameworks start with the three cultural evolutionary periods used for North
American prehistory based to a large extent on subsistence patterns. “Paleoindian” and “Archaic” are
terms used over much of North America for the earliest of the three periods while “Late Prehistoric” is
now commonly used to name the last of the prehistoric periods in central Texas.
Previous Investigations
As of March 1, 2010, 471 archeological have been recorded in Hays County. A large number of these
sites are located within a five mile radius of downtown San Marcos where most of the archeological
surveys have taken place. East of Interstate 35 in the Blackland Prairie, site density appears low
compared to adjacent areas of the Edward Plateau immediately west. Within a three mile radius of the
project area, about 30 sites have been recorded. Twenty-eight of these have historic components and 14
have prehistoric components. Historic site types include farmsteads, cemeteries, schools, and segments
of old, abandoned roads, all of which mostly date from the late 19th century through the middle 20th
century. At least one segment of the Camino Real (41HY290) has been recorded within the three mile
radius. A nearby granite monument erected in 1918 to commemorate the road has also been recorded as
an archeological site (41HY87).
Although most of the prehistoric sites within a three mile radius of the present project area are lithic
scatters and lithic procurement sites, a few campsites have been recorded. One of these is 41HY300
situated on a slope overlooking an intermittent, second order creek. In addition to chert chipping debris,
the site contains burned rocks scattered by plowing and other surface disturbances. Three other
prehistoric campsites have been recorded in upland areas away from streams. Site 41HY288 is situated
on a low slope 200 meters north of a small, first order stream. Sites 41HY276 and 41HY277 are located
400 and 500 meters respectively from a higher order stream (York Creek). All these campsites are small
and probably represent short-term use.
Methodology
A file search showed that no archeological sites have been recorded in or near the project area. The
Geologic Atlas of Texas shows no Holocene alluvium in the area and therefore cultural material
associated with an archeological site in most cases will be on or near the ground surface.
The purpose of the field survey was to record any archeological sites within the project area and assess
their potential for designation as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs). The criteria used to determine
SAL status are described in Chapter 26 “Rules of Practice and Procedure” of the Texas State Antiquities
Code. In brief, these criteria include: (1) the potential to contribute to a better understanding of history or
prehistory; (2) preserved and intact deposits; (3) unique and rare attributes; (4) opportunities to test
theories and methods of preservation; and (5) likelihood of vandalism and relic collecting. The survey
involved walking transects across the site to inspect the ground surface for cultural material. In addition,
six shovel tests were dug to search for buried archeological material within the upper 50 to 60cm of soil
(Figure 108). These tests were placed in the higher elevations of the project area where ground visibility

219

220

was poor and the soil less waterlogged. This is the minimum number of shovel tests the THC
recommends for a three acre project area. Deep testing methods such as trenching were not implemented
because the geology precluded deeply buried intact cultural material.
Results
No cultural material other than recent trash was seen on the surface within the project area. About 60%
of the ground surface was visible with the rest covered by low forbs and cow manure. Because of recent
rains, the clay surface was soft and sticky but without the standing pools of water seen at the lower
elevations adjacent to the creek channel
No cultural material was recovered from the six shovel tests. These tests encountered a dark upper soil
horizon that reached depths of between 18 and 27cm below the surface (Figure 109). Below this zone
was a lighter-colored soil horizon. Both zones were composed of clay with varying amounts of calcium
carbonate nodules. These nodules were generally more numerous in the higher elevations and rare to
absent in tests placed on the lower slope.

221

The lower soil zone encountered in the shovel test matches the description of the C Horizon soil zone for
Houston Black soils in the Soil Survey, which typically is found between 77 and 90 inches below the
surface (Batte 1984). If this zone is indeed the C Horizon, then the soils within the project area may have
been truncated with most of the A Horizons missing. The soil profiles of the six shovel tests are
described in the Appendix.
Recommendations
The survey found no evidence of an archeological site within the boundaries of the project area. Because
of the geology, if any cultural material were present, it would be either on the surface or within reach of
shovel testing. No signs of gilgais or other natural processes were seen that could bury artifacts deeper
than depths reached by the shovel tests. Since no State Archeological Landmarks will be impacted by the
proposed substation construction, it is recommended that the Bluebonnet Electric Cooperative be allowed
to proceed with the project.

Introduction
Introduction and Management Summary
LCRA has recently purchased certain facilities within an existing substation from Cap Rock Electric. It is
located in southern McCulloch County, about 1.25 miles north of the Mason/McCulloch county line and
about 3 miles south of the small Community of Camp San Saba, which is situated on the south side of the
San Saba River (Figure 110). LCRA will replace certain elements within the existing substation, and will
also expand the substation grounds by about 1 acre onto land purchased from a private landowner.
Because there is no record of the substation location having been previously surveyed for cultural
resources, a cultural resources assessment was conducted in March of 2010. A map review indicated that
the setting was of moderate probability for containing prehistoric cultural resources, but probably low
probability for historic resources.
Field investigations were conducted on March 9, 2010 by two members of LCRA’s contracted
archaeological staff. A total of six shovel tests were placed within the substation expansion area,
exceeding the recommended minimum as suggested by Texas Historical Commission guidelines.
One previously unrecorded archaeological site, 41MK47, was recorded as a result of the investigations.
This site is a lithic scatter that has been severely impacted by past clearing activities. The site is
considered to be fully recorded within the substation expansion area and is not considered eligible for
formal listing as a State Archeological Landmark.
All work was conducted under the terms of and in accordance with LCRA’s annual antiquities permit
Number 5528 and the Antiquities Code of Texas. No artifact collections were made and no curation will
be necessary. It is recommended the project be allowed to proceed.
Natural Background
The project area is located near the western edge of the Llano Uplift within the Upper Cambrian San Saba
member of the Wilberns formation, which consists of dolomite and limestone. The limestone is described
as granular and moderately glauconitic and ranges in color from light gray to greenish gray (Kier et. al
1976). Soils are mapped as Stilskin series, which are described as forming from calcareous sandstone.
They typically contain a 15 cm thick A horizon over a Bk horizon that rests on bedrock (Cr horizon) at a
depth of about 43 cm. Mesquite plains are present about 15 miles to the north, and the Live-oak mesquite
savanna about equally distant to the west. The vegetation regime is mapped as Live Oak-Ashe Juniper
parks and Live Oak Mesquite Ashe-Juniper parks (McMahon et al 1984). Texas, oak, shin oak, cedar
elm, agarito, persimmon and various grasses and forbs are common.
Topographically, the project area is at the base of a large hill, marked San Saba (but not San Saba Peak)
on the USGS map (see Figure 110). This hill is a portion of a divide that separates east-trending
drainages that feed Katemcy Creek and the San Saba River from drainages that run more westward,
feeding Cavin Branch, also a tributary of the San Saba River. A spring is mapped about 1.5 miles to the
west, and abrupt stream heads along nearby ridge edges suggest at least seasonally available ground
water.

Previous Investigation
There is only one recorded archaeological site within a five mile radius of the project area. Site 41MK1
has only a key card site on file, which references a small collection of 29 unspecified artifacts from
Katemcy Creek, but the accuracy of the location and site dimension is questionable. Before the present
survey, only 46 sites were recorded in all of McCulloch County. Mason County, located immediately to
the south, has a total of 96 recorded sites. A recent linear project through Mason County attempted to
characterize types of sites that might expected within a nearby portion of the Llano Uplift. Common
lithic scatters often appeared to represent short-term and sometimes single event hunting or other nonlithic resource acquisition sites that were probably support locales for larger base camps located along
larger water bodies. Such areas may also be the result of seasonal exploitation, (most likely deer),
possible on an interregional basis (Malof and Hixson 2009).
Camp San Saba
Camp San Saba is a small community located about three miles north/north east of the project area, near
the junction of the San Saba River and Katemcy Creek. Texas Rangers were station there in the 1850s, a
few years after the Muesebach-Comanche Treaty of 1847, which was signed nearby. During the Civil
War the camp was manned by confederate soldiers, but was apparently abandoned by the end of the war.
The emerging community was the primary area of settlement until Brady was named the county seat in
1876, the same year Camp San Saba acquired a post office. The community probably peaked in the mid
1880s, when there was three churches, three stores, a school and 250 inhabitants. After the railroad
passed through Brady in 1904, Camp San Saba began to dwindle, losing its post office in the 1930s. By
1939 only 50 inhabitants were left. In 2000 that number was down to 36.
Methodology
The purpose of the field survey was to record any archeological sites within the project area and assess
their potential for designation as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs). The criteria used to determine
SAL status are described in Chapter 26 “Rules of Practice and Procedure” of the Texas State Antiquities
Code. In brief, these criteria include: (1) the potential to contribute to a better understanding of history or
prehistory; (2) preserved and intact deposits; (3) unique and rare attributes; (4) opportunities to test
theories and methods of preservation; and (5) likelihood of vandalism and relic collecting. The survey
involved walking transects across the site to inspect the ground surface for cultural material.
In addition, six shovel tests were dug to search for buried archeological material (Figure 111). These tests
were circular holes 35cm in diameter and dug in 20cm levels down to bedrock. The soil removed from
the tests was screened through a ¼” wire mesh. Artifacts recovered from the tests were recorded on the
shovel test forms and returned to the test hole during refilling. The locations of the shovel tests are shown
in Figure 111. The soils in the northwest quadrant of the project area are shallow with frequent bedrock
exposures, and the shovel tests were mostly placed to the south and east of the existing substation where
soils appeared deeper. No artifacts were collected for curation during the project.
Results
A new archeological site, 41MK47, was recorded during the survey, covering nearly the entire one-acre
project area. It consists of five pieces of widely-scattered chert debitage (chipping debris) and the
proximal fragment of an untyped dart point, all observed on the ground surface. These artifacts are made
from Edwards chert of varying colors and textures but all have some degree of white patination. There is
little or no cortex on these artifacts. A sixth tertiary flake was recovered from a depth of about 20cm in a
shovel test placed ten meters south of the substation. The flake was made of gray unpatinated chert. This
229

\

was the only artifact recovered from the six shovel tests. These six flakes are all relatively thick and were
struck from cores using hard hammer percussion. Several fire-cracked rocks were also present on the
surface, one near the entrance gate and the others in the southern half of the project area. Naturallyoccurring chert of a quality useful for stone tools was not seen in the project area.
An area covering about two acres around the existing substation, including the entire project area, had
been bladed by a backhoe sometime in the last few years, either by the land owner or by the previous
substation owner (Figure 112). This was apparently done to clear vegetation and perhaps to contour the
surface. The only obvious sign that an appreciable amount of dirt had been removed are the earth berms
that lie along the perimeter of the cleared area immediately outside the project area (Figure 113). No
artifacts were seen on the surface of the berms, although visibility was poor because they were covered by
sprouting herbaceous plants and dried brush.
Recommendations
The survey recorded one archeological site, 41MK47, consisting primarily of a surface scatter of flakes
with a few possible burned rocks. The entire project area has been bladed leaving berms of earth and
brush along the perimeter. Due to the geology and soil type, most of cultural material at this site would
have originally been on and in the upper soil zone; probably the vast majority of it is now in the berms
and out of context. What was noted during the survey is probably only a small fraction of the cultural
material that was once present. Even this material has been displaced by the blading. Shovel testing
indicated that little cultural material is now buried in the remaining soil.
Because of the severe impacts to 41MK47 caused by the blading, the portion of the site within the project
is not considered eligible for SAL designation. Therefore we recommend that the project be allowed to
proceed with standard emergency provisions always applicable. We ask for you concurrence on this
assessment and recommendation.

Abstract
The Lower Colorado River Authority’s Archaeology Services staff conducted an intensive cultural
resource survey of the proposed Big Hill Electrical Substation (formerly known as the McCamey D
Electrical Substation) in northern Schleicher County, Texas. No cultural resource sites were found
during the survey of the 43-acre tract. Since it does not appear that any cultural resource sites eligible
or potentially eligible for designation as State Archeological Landmarks will be affected by the
proposed construction of the substation, it is recommended that the proposed project be allowed to
proceed.
Because no cultural resource sites were found during the survey, there are no artifacts that will require
curation.

Introduction
The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) has recently purchased a 43-acre tract in northern
Schleicher County, Texas for the construction of the Big Hill Electrical Substation (formerly called the
McCamey D Electrical Substation). The center of the substation tract is situated about 1.82 km (6,000ft)
west-northwest of the intersection of County Road 431 and U. S. Highway 277 in the far northern part of
the county (Figure 114).
The LCRA Archaeology Services staff has completed an intensive cultural resource survey of the entire
acreage. The survey consisted of pedestrian survey and shovel testing. Personnel who conducted the
fieldwork consisted of LCRA staff member Daniel J. Prikryl (Principal Investigator) and contracted
archaeologists Charles Hixson and Patrick Hatten. The investigation was conducted in order to meet
LCRA’s obligations to the Antiquities of Code of Texas under TAC Blanket Permit #5528. Since there is
no federal funding or permitting involved with the construction of the substation, a Section 106 review
under the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 is not applicable. All cultural resource work was
completed in accordance with methods for fieldwork and reporting as proposed by the Council of Texas
Archeologists (1992).
Environmental Background
The project area is located on an upland terrace slope approximately 2.15 to 2.80 km northwest of the
South Concho River. An unnamed tributary of the river lies about 200 meters east of the northeast corner
of the project area while a smaller fork of that tributary creek runs parallel to the entire south boundary of
the tract also at a distance of about 200 meters.
Surface geology in the project area consists of cherty limestone and dolomite of the Segovia Formation of
the Lower Cretaceous-aged Edwards Group (Barnes 1976). Limestone bedrock and medium-sized
boulders are present on the ground surface in some areas (Figure 115). The terrain generally slopes
downward in a southeasterly direction. At the far south end of the project area adjacent to County Road
431, the terrain flattens (Figure 116).
Soils present in the project area consist of the Ector Association and the Kavett-Tarrant Association. The
Ector series consist of dark grayish brown gravelly loam topsoils that are generally about 20 cm (8
inches) thick. This topsoil lies directly on limestone bedrock. The typical soil profile of the Kavett series
consists of a 23 cm (9 inch) thick very dark grayish brown silty clay surface layer that sits above an 18 cm
(7 inch) thick brown silty clay. Deeper, a thin indurated caliche layer occurs above limestone bedrock.
The Tarrant series has a 33 cm (13 inch) thick very dark grayish brown to dark brown cobbly clay topsoil
that rests above indurated limestone bedrock.
The project area is currently a grass-covered pastureland with some mesquite trees present. The Atlas of
Texas describes the present-day vegetation of this general area as a Mesquite Savanna (Arbingast et al.
1979:13). Creel (1978) has described the upland areas around the South Concho River as having been
primarily grasslands with a few mesquite and oaks prior to changes brought about by Euro-American
settlement.

Culture History
Although the project area lies just outside the western edge of Prewitt’s (1981,1985) Central Texas
archaeological region, his detailed cultural chronological sequence is generally applicable. The Central
Texas archaeological record has typically been divided into four main subdivisions.
These periods, in chronological order from the most ancient to the most recent are as follows: the
Paleoindian, the Archaic, the Late Prehistoric, and the Historic Periods. These periods are differentiated
mostly by broadly defined subsistence patterns. The prehistoric part of the this chronology has been
subdivided by Prewitt into11 Archaic and 2 Late Prehistoric phase divisions based on changes in material
culture, especially projectile point styles, and to some extent changes in subsistence patterns. It is
important to note that the Schleicher County area was occupied for at least 13,000 years prior to the
coming of Europeans. Excavations in the West and Central Texas areas show that throughout these
millennia, prehistoric people were nomadic hunter-gatherers who moved across the landscape exploiting
seasonally available plant and animal resources.
All archaeological materials dating greater than 8,500 years ago are assigned to the Paleoindian Period.
This era extends from the later end of the Pleistocene into the very early part of the Holocene when the
climate was changing from cool, moist conditions of the last Ice Age into the warmer, and drier climate
that continues into the present day (Bryant and Shafer 1977). Early researchers emphasized the hunting
of now-extinct Pleistocene fauna by Native Americans during this period, but in reality the subsistence
pattern of these people included the utilization of small game and plant foods (Collins 1995:382).
Paleoindian sites are rarely found due to the low populations and the apparent highly mobile lifestyle of
these early people.
During the Archaic Period, which dates from approximately 8500 to 1250 years before present (BP), the
onset of the modern-day climate took hold as the gradual warming continued. Several brief shifts in the
climate brought somewhat cooler, wetter conditions around 5500 and 2600 BP, however (Collins
1995:383-385). These short intervals of mesic conditions appear to coincide with the occurrence of larger
numbers of bison bones within archaeological sites in Central and West Texas. In contrast, a period of
harsher dry and arid conditions extending from around 4500 to 3000 BP seems to mark increased usage of
a unique type of prehistoric features that archaeologists call the burned rock midden or mound. These
features represent the remains of earth ovens that were used to bake plant foods, principally tubers of
sotol and lechuguilla plants.
During the Archaic, prehistoric human populations grew and became less mobile. The appearance of
groundstone tools indicates more intense use of plant food resources in the Archaic. The Archaic Period
can generally be divided into three parts, Early, Middle and Late, although Prewitt (1981) has proposed
11 more detailed divisions within the Archaic based on changes in projectile point styles and subtle
changes in subsistence practices.
The Late Prehistoric Period begins at approximately 1250 BP with the introduction of the bow and arrow,
a major shift in hunting technology. However, the prehistoric groups in the Concho River area continued
to function as nomadic hunter-gatherers. Around 650 BP, a second technological improvement, the
introduction of the usage of pottery occurred. In Central Texas, the earlier part of the Late Prehistoric has
been defined as the Austin Phase, while the period after 650 BP is termed the Toyah Phase (Jelks 1962;
Prewitt 1981, 1985). In the San Angelo area, Creel (1990:15-18) has defined a local prehistoric cultural
phase called the Blowout Mountain Phase as a regional alternate to the Austin Phase. Archaeological
materials associated with the Blowout Mountain Phase consist of distinctive arrow point types including
diminutive forms of Darl and Zephyr dart points, Alba-like and Bonham-like specimens, stone-lined

239

hearths, flexed burials in stone cists and rock cairns, and the frequent occurrence of large quantities of
mussel shells in habitation sites.
During the early Historic Period, European explorers saw the Jumano, Apache, and Comanche in the
Schleicher County area (Bolton 1911:74-83;Kelly 1955). Much of the following information about the
history of Schleicher County is taken from Smyrl’s (2009) article in The Handbook of Texas Online.
Initial settlement by people of Old World origin did not begin in the general area until Fort McKavett was
opened in 1852 in adjacent Menard County. It was not until the mid 1870s that permanent ranches were
established in the project region. The first town in Schleicher County was Verand, which was established
on the Vermont Ranch in 1895. The townsite, which no longer exists, lies about 13.1 km south of the
substation tract.
Growth was slow and in the 1900 census, Schleicher County had only 515 citizens. Most individuals
made their living in stock raising around the turn of the century, with some agricultural production on the
South Concho River and the upper tributaries of the San Saba River.
Beginning in the 1910s and continuing into the 1980s, sheep and goat production increased for the wool
and mohair industries. In 1930, 1.5 million pounds of wool was produced in Schleicher County. The
West Texas Woolen Mills was established in El Dorado in the early1940s, making Schleicher County one
the state’s most important wool-processing centers.
The first railroad was constructed through Schleicher County in 1929 and 1930. During the 1930s, the
county’s population began to decline as people began to move from farms to the cities. This trend
continued until the 1970s, when the population began to grow slightly again. In 1990, the county
population was 2,990 with 2,019 of the residents living in the town of El Dorado.
Previous Investigations
The first noteworthy archaeological investigation near the project area was Creel’s (1978) student survey
of a portion of the South Concho River. Many of the 57 prehistoric sites that Creel recorded and studied
are located just 4 to 6 miles north-northeast of the proposed substation tract. Creel’s objective was to
completely survey a large continguous block of land that reflected the environmental diversity
represented in the broader region. Prehistoric sites found by Creel in his study area consisted of burned
rock accumulations and/or middens, lithic scatters, lithic scatters with burned rock, lithic procurement
sites, lithic procurement sites with burned rock accumulations and/or middens, and rockshelters. He
plotted the distribution of these sites by microenvironmental locations and noted that burned rock
accumulations and middens always were associated with stands of oak and/or pecan trees, and also with
water sources. Creel concluded that these burned rock accumulations and middens are associated with the
exploitation of mast crops.
Closer to the project area, site 41SL7 was recorded about 2 miles north-northeast of the project area
during the cultural resource survey for the All-American Pipeline Project in the late 1980s (THC Site
Atlas). This site is situated near a tributary the South Concho River and it is described as a prehistoric
lithic scatter/procurement site lacking any temporally diagnostic artifacts. The portion of the site within
the pipeline right-of-way was assessed as insignificant.
The Texas Department of Transportation’s (TxDOT) work at 41TG91 represents the first modern largescale excavation of a prehistoric site in the project vicinity (Creel 1990). This site is located on the South
Concho River just downstream from the Twin Buttes Reservoir Dam. At this site, TxDOT excavations
within the proposed realignment of FM 584 led to the recovery of cultural materials from the Late
Archaic Period and the Blowout Mountain and Toyah Phases of the Late Prehistoric Period. The
240

principal Late Archaic component was represented by finds of Marcos dart points in association with
bison bones, hearths, mussel shell concentrations, and other chipped stone tools and debitage. The Late
Archaic finds were radiocarbon-dated at 600 BC to AD 100. In other less intensive Late Archaic
occupations dating from approximately AD 100 to 800 or 900, a single Ensor point was found with a few
slab-lined hearths, mussel shell clusters, and chert debitage.
At 41TG91, Blowout Mountain Phase materials dating from AD 900-1300 included arrowpoints
resembling the Alba, Bonham, and Cliffton types along with a few Washita points. Other artifacts and
features associated with this cultural component consisted of a slab-lined hearth, a mussel shell
concentration, and several human skeletal fragments. Bison bones were notably absent.
Toyah Phase occupations were the best represented at 41TG91. Materials associated with this phase
consisted of Perdiz, Cliffton, and Harrell arrowpoints, end scrapers, beveled knives, flake tools, and
debitage, bone-tempered pottery, slab-lined hearths, and burned slab clusters, a few mussel shell
concentrations, and numerous bison bones.
A second noteworthy excavation project in Tom Green County was conducted at the Rush Site
(41TG346), which is located on the North Concho River about 10 miles north of San Angelo (Quigg and
Peck 1995). This site showed evidences of five Toyah Phase occupation zones, with the most profilic
zone, Occupation 4, dating approximately AD 1575 (375 BP). The remains indicated utilization of bison
and carbon isotopes from bulk matrix samples produced C4 plant material, which indicated dryer climatic
conditions during the last 600 years. Studies have shown that modern bison prefer C4 grasses.
The lithic debitage from this Occupation 4 showed two separate flake production technologies – a blade
technology for the manufacture of arrow points and scrapers, and a general biface technology used for the
production of large bifaces. Bison was the dominant food source at the Rush Site. Features consisted of
hearths, ash piles, ash lenses, and burned rock concentrations. The hearths were used as cooking and
heating features, while ash piles may be the byproduct of bone grease rendering activities. The presence
of two ceramic traditions and several projectile point types may suggest communal bison hunting by two
or more social groups.
At the O. H. Ivie Reservoir, two Late Prehistoric ceramic sites, 41CC131 and 41RN169, were excavated
(Treece et al. 1993a). At 41CC131, 52 features including slab-lined hearths, basin-shaped hearths,
ash/charcoal lenses, unlined pits, post holes, ash lenses, lithic and bone concentrations, and a wall trench
for a possible house were found within three buried occupation zones. Perdiz and Toyah arrow points,
Harahey bifaces, beveled knives, unifaces (mostly scrapers) were recovered along bone tools, engraved
mussel shell ornaments, and a large ceramic sherd collection mostly Leon Plain. Reconstructed vessel
fragments suggest that the vessels lacked necks and shoulders, and that they consisted of small, thinwalled globular jars. The most common bones within the site were bison. Radiocarbon dates ranged
from AD 1300 to 1790.
At the 41RN169 site, a Toyah Phase living surface was explored. Forty-five features including hearths,
basin-shaped rock concentrations, ash/charcoal lenses, a wall trench from a small circular structure, bone
peg alignments, and a scraper cache were found. Radiocarbon dates ranged from AD 1300 to 1650.
Projectile points consisted of Perdiz, Washita, and Cliffton types, with many end scrapers being present.
Three hammerstones and four anvil stones were found as were 351 pottery sherds of the Leon Plain. One
wide-mouth, flat-bottom jar with vertical sides was reconstructed. Overall, the artifacts and features
suggested short-term occupations with intensive bison processing, bone grease extraction, stone tool
production, and maintenance.

241

Five non-ceramic sites were also excavated during the O. H. Ivie Reservoir data recovery project (Treece
et al. 1993b and Lintz et al. 1995). These sites consist of 41RN108, 41CC170. 41CC112, 41RN3, and
41CN19. Excavations at 41RN108 and 41CC170 did not produce any substantial results. The most
remarkable find occurred at 41CC112 where the remains of a circular structure supported by posts footed
in rock and containing a central hearth were uncovered at depths of 2.7 to 2.9 meters below ground
surface. The features was radiocarbon dated at 5600 BC, and the floor of the structure contained a
distinctive tool kit consisting of ones associated with hide working butchering, wood working, and
freshwater clam cooking.
Other slightly more recent campsite materials dating to approximately 5310 BC were found in the levels
above those containing the structure at 41CC112. Higher in the soil column at 70 to 120 cm below
ground surface, stone-lined storage pits were found in association with a buried burned rock midden. The
storage pits were radiocarbon dated to 1070 BC.
Late Archaic campsite remains were uncovered at sites 41CN19 and 41RN3. At 41CN119, the work
produced a noteworthy well-preserved bone assemblage including bison, deer, and many small animals
with a burned rock feature, a mussel shell concentration, and an ash/charcoal concentration. A
radiocarbon age of AD 380 was obtained. A second Late Archaic component was uncovered at 41RN3,
where dense lithic debris and mussel shells were found in two stratified lenses that contained six burned
rock features. These occupations were dated between AD 1 to about AD 400.
Importantly, too, five burned rock ring middens were investigated at O. H. Ivie Reservoir at sites
41CC112, 41RN3, and 41RN169. Radiocarbon dates showed that all of these features dated from AD
400 to AD1350. Attempts to determine what type of food resources were being processed in these
features yielded no concrete results.
Survey Methods
The purpose of the cultural resource survey was to locate and assess the State Archeological Landmark
status of all cultural resource sites within the project area. A file search showed that there are no
previously recorded archaeological sites within the project area and that no parts of the project area had
ever been surveyed by professional archaeologists. Given the fact that the entire southern flank and
northeastern part of the project area are both situated within 300 meters of tributaries of the South Concho
River, it appeared that prehistoric sites could be present. To gauge potential for historic sites, an attempt
was made to search for old maps particularly early USGS maps to determine if any historic period
structures are depicted as having been located within the project area. A search for such maps revealed
no maps older than the 1972 USGS map. No structures are shown on this map or any other more recent
maps.
The intense cultural resource field survey conducted for this project consisted of pedestrian survey with
shovel testing. During the pedestrian survey, a three-person crew walked zig-zag transects at 30-meter
intervals across the entire project area. Bare and eroded areas were carefully inspected for cultural
materials. Shovel tests were to be excavated in areas with poor ground surface visibility and/or in areas
with a potential for buried cultural deposits. Additionally, shovel tests were excavated to aid in
determining the boundaries of all cultural resource sites that were found. All shovel tests were 35 to 40
cm diameter holes that were excavated 20 cm levels with all fill being screened through ¼ inch wire mesh
to determine if any artifacts were present.
Any cultural resource sites that were discovered during the field survey were to be recorded on State of
Texas Archeological Site Forms, and sketch maps of each site were to be drawn in the field. Site

locations would also plotted of USGS maps and on aerial photographs. The survey had a “no collection”
policy. Therefore, there will be no artifacts to curate at TARL at the conclusion of the project.
Survey Results
The entire 43-acre tract was intensively surveyed. The majority of the survey area was found to have
good ground surface visibility with limestone bedrock and/or limestone rubble exposed on ground surface
in some areas (Figure 115). In some parts of the survey area, recent brush clearing activities have
churned the topsoil and, thus, provided good ground surface visibility (Figure 116). In a few areas,
leftover brush piles obscure the ground surface. In those areas and in other areas with poor ground
surface visibility, shovel testing was employed during the survey to determine if any surface or subsurface
artifacts were present. Figure 117 shows the locations of the shovel tests. Although the total of 10 shovel
tests that were excavated is below the THC’s recommended number for a 43 acre tract, the fact that there
was good ground surface visibility and very little or no topsoil present in many areas negated the need for
additional shovel tests (see Figure 115 and Figure 116).
The shovel testing showed that shallow cobbly clay and silty clay topsoils are present above limestone
bedrock and indurated caliche/limestone throughout the project area. Three of the 10 shovel tests had
topsoil deposits less than 10 cm thick and 2 other shovel tests had deposits that were less than 20 cm
thick. The thickest topsoil deposit was found in Shovel Test #9, where a 45 cm thick silty clay was
found. Appendix 1 provides a description of the soils from the shovel tests.
Despite an intensive search, no cultural resource sites were found during the survey. The absence of
prehistoric sites may be due to the apparent absence of any chert cobbles for the production of chipped
stone tools. The lack of prehistoric activity may also be due to the project area’s distance to larger, more
permanent water sources.
Recommendations
As a result of the intensive cultural resource survey the proposed Big Hill Electrical Substation, it does
not appear that any cultural resource sites eligible or potentially eligible for formal designation as State
Archeological Landmarks are present within the project area. The LCRA recommends that the proposed
construction of the Bill Hill Substation be allowed to proceed. However, should any presently unknown
cultural resource sites be found during construction, then work should halt in the vicinity of the discovery,
and the LCRA Archaeology Services should be immediately contacted at 1-800-776-5272, ext. 6714 so
that the find can be reported to the Texas Historical Commission and a determination can be made as to
whether any avoidance/mitigation measures are needed.

Introduction and Management Summary
LCRA proposes to construct an elevated water storage tank near the intersection of State Highway 71 and
Farm to Market Road 3238 (Hamilton Pool Road) in western Travis County, Texas (Figure 118). The
water tower will be supplied by an existing water treatment facility and will tap in to an existing water
line that runs down the the south side of SH 71. In addition to the tower and tap line, an access road will
be necessary.
A cultural resources investigation was conducted during May of 2010 by staff and contracted
archaeologists of LCRA’s Archaeology Services department under authorization of blanket Annual TAC
Permit No. 5141 for the year 2010. The investigation consisted of a file review and field survey of a 13acre tract identified as an area of potential effect.
As a result of the investigations one previously recorded prehistoric site, 41TV2328, was revisited and
and assessed. The present survey does not support some conclusions reached by the original recorders,
and no avoidance measures are considered necessary at the site, which is not considered eligible for
formal listing as a State Archeological Landmark. Elsewhere, there is little to no potential for there to be
undiscovered archaeological materials that would be eligible for formal listing as State Archeological
Landmarks. It is recommended that the project be allowed to proceed at any and all locations within the
study area.
This interim report provides a level of natural and cultural history background necessary for placing the
project in context. The final version of this report will be submitted in LCRA’s Annual Report of
Cultural Resource Investigations which will summarize the more general aspects of the larger study area
in accordance with reporting standards as established by the Council of Texas Archeologists and the
Texas Historical Commission.
No artifacts were collected and no curation will be necessary.

Study Area
The 13-acre study area is located on the top and northerly slopes of a topographically prominent hill that
rises about 100 ft above the surrounding land. Such hills are common in this portion of the Edwards
Plateau. The landform in question is a divide between Barton Creek, which lies to the south and the
Pedernales River, which is a bit further to the north. The divide forms a ridge overlooking the Colorado
River to the east. Geologically, the entire area is almost exclusively part of the Glen Rose formation,
which is comprised of limestone, dolomite and marl, except on some of the higher elevations, where
remnants of chert-bearing Fredericksburg Group Edwards Limestone formation, or more specifically,
Member 1 of the Edwards formation, in which tabular chert is abundant, are present (Barnes 1974, 1981;
Rodda 1971). Observed vegetation consists of juniper and established oak mottes and medium to tall
grasses in shallow Brackett series soils. Previous clearing within the project area was clearly evidenced
by a rolling topography with numerous depressions. This clearing was not recent, however, and probably
occurred 10-20 years ago, or perhaps longer. From the hilltop the Little Barton Creek valley is clearly
evident to the not-distant south, and minor drainages are apparent to the east and west.
Numerous investigations and studies have demonstrated clearly that the study area conforms to generally
accepted prehistoric cultural sequences (e.g. Collins 1995), while historic settlement of Travis County and
the Bee Caves area is well-documented.

Recent archaeological projects include several water pipeline-related projects constructed by LCRA,
including a line crossing Little Barton Creek, which resulted in the testing (and ultimate determination of
ineligibility) for campsites 41TV1914 and 41TV1916 (Oksanen et. al 2002). At 41TV528 several
seasons of field work provided significant information on an Early Archaic occupation of Barton Creek in
the nearby Shield Ranch (Karbula 2000), which had been surveyed by University of Texas staff and
students over a period of at least three years, the results of which indicated there was a high probability
for intact sites in this portion of the Barton Creek drainage (Hester 1990, in Karbula 2000:3).
The Texas Archeological Sites Atlas was reviewed for archaeological sites in settings similar to the
project area within a 5 km (3 mile) radius. A total of fourteen sites were reviewed. The vast majority
were described as lithic procurement or quarry sites (N = 7) or lithic scatters (N = 5) while two (41TV624
and 41TV1043) were described as open camps, although little in the sites’ forms actually supported such
an interpretation.

Research Design and Survey Methods
Because a known site was located across the vast majority of the project area, the survey was designed to
evaluate the conclusions and interpretations of the previous investigators. Site 41TV2328 (Figure 119)
was described as an extensive lithic scatter, along with a very large (100 m long) burned rock midden and
nearby dense burned rock scatter located near the crest of the hill (Owens 2009). These features were
observed but not tested, due to their location outside the area of the project. Recommendations were for
avoidance of this feature, as it remained not assessed for State Archeological Landmark potential.
The present project, therefore, focused on evaluating this proposed burned rock midden, as well as the
remainder of the recorded site and areas outside the recorded site’s boundaries but within the present
project area. The site map from the previous investigation (Owens 2009:28, Figure 7) was georeferenced
with aerial and topographic imagery in a GIS, while topographic lines were uploaded into a GPS unit to
aid in ground orientation. Pedestrian survey and shovel testing was concentrated in the vicinity of the
mapped midden and burned rock scatter, as well as the knoll top location of the proposed water tower.
Secondary effort was directed at the possible waterline connector and access road corridors along the
sloping northeastern face of the landform, with pedestrian transects designed to cover the entirety of the
tract in order to enable maximum end-project flexibility.
A total of ten shovel tests were excavated within the 13- acre project area, exceeding the minimum
standards as suggested by the Texas Historical Commission (six to seven shovel tests for a project of this
size). A no-collection policy was maintained throughout the project, and documentation was achieved by
way of photography, GPS records and field notes.

Results of Investigations
The investigations began by a reconnaissance of the hilltop area in an attempt to locate the burned rock
midden and/or burned rock scatter. No evidence of either was seen, although dense accumulations of
thin, angular tabular chert were common, almost always with some evidence of reduction in the form of
tested fragments, flakes, and early stage bifaces, which were not uncommon. Chert chunks were very
common, most of which could not be determined to be of aboriginal origin, and could just as easily be the
result of land clearing activities described above. Additionally, the chert was at first glance identical to
limestone, given the dense and weathered cortex. After experimentally breaking a few pieces it became
evident that chert was by far the most common lithic material on the hill, with limestone much less
common. Chert occasionally showed heat-crazing, and there were various levels of patina, although
251

252

dense patina was fairly rare. Limestone occasionally had the classic “FCR” appearance, but was never
seen as such in any concentrations.
Testing then began in the probable location of the water tower. The first test was excavated to a depth of
25 cm, where reddish clay was encountered. The upper 25 cm consisted of many dozens of chert chunks,
a few flakes and three or four cores in grayish brown loam. The chert was primarily tabular, although one
nodule, closely approximating the appearance of a very large sweet potato, was also recovered (Figure
120).

Figure 120. Shovel Test 1 recovery. Note angular chert.

The next test was placed about 20 m to the ENE, and was negative for cultural material, with only eight
chert chunks recovered from mottled grayish brown clay loam to a depth of 20 cm where reddish clay was
again encountered. The final hilltop test was placed about 35 m to the north, and was similar in recovery,
with numerous chunks and pieces, about 15 flakes, four or five cores, and a crude biface. The profile was
also similar, although cherty limestone bedrock was encountered at a depth of 30 cm.
Tests 4 and 5 were placed within the area mapped as the burned rock midden (Figure 121). There was no
cultural recovery in ST4, and only three thin flakes and several chunks in ST 5. Soil matrix in both was
gray or grayish brown clay loam, with dense cherty limestone, limestone and chert as coarse fraction.
One possible fire-cracked limestone piece was found in ST4. Observations of the landform noted past
disturbances in the form of numerous depressions, and at least one portion of the previously mapped
feature is almost certainly an old bulldozer push pile.
Shovel Test 6 was placed within the “dense burned rock accumulation.” There was no cultural recovery.
The matrix was 30 cm of grayish brown loam with a moderate amount of limestone cobbles and a few
chert chunks.

253

The remaining four test were placed in lower elevations to assess the possible pipeline route, access road,
and that portion of the landscape. There was no artifact recovery in any of these tests. Soil profiles
ranged from 5 cm over limestone bedrock (ST 9) to 12-20 cm of grayish brown loamy clay or clay loam
over reddish clay (ST 8 and 10) or 23 cm of silty brown loam over limestone bedrock (ST7).

Figure 121. Shovel Test 4 within “burned rock midden.”
During the pedestrian survey another dense artifact scatter was recorded on the north flank of the knoll,
located south of ST 10. Within a 100 m diameter was seen several thousands of chert chunks and tabular
fragments, along with many hundreds of definite artifacts. Additionally, a projectile point fragment was
found in the area between the “burned rock midden” and the “dense burned rock accumulation.” This
point may be either a Bulverde or Andice point (Figure 122). If the latter, it significantly extends the time
frame of site usage when added to the possible Pedernales point recovered in the previous investigations
(Owens 2009:Figure10). The pedestrian survey also confirmed that the boundaries of site 41TV2328 as
described by Owens (2009) are accurate within the present project area.

Summary and Recommendations
LCRA proposes to construct an elevated water storage tank on a hilltop within a 13-acre portion of land
located near Highway 71 and the Community of Bee Cave in western Travis County. The majority of this
tract is covered by previously recorded site 41TV2328, which included a burned rock midden and dense
burned rock scatter as originally recorded.
The present investigations could find no evidence of the burned rock midden or scatter. It is suggested
that because the previous investigators were unable to fully document the site due to much of its location
being outside their project area their conclusions were of a preliminary nature, and that additional survey
work such as that conducted in the present project would have yielded similar conclusions. The “midden”
and burned rock accumulation were in actuality composed almost entirely of tabular chert with thick
limestone cortex. The black soil noted in the original report (Owens 2009:29) was not seen, although
there were natural distributions of differing soils across the project area. There was also clear evidence of
past bulldozing activities, which may account for the some of the accumulations of lithic material (Figure
123). Past brush burning may have also occurred, possibly explaining the black soil previously reported.

Figure 123. Detail of chert and limestone bulldozer push pile.

Site 41TV2328 is an impressive lithic procurement locale, and is explained by its distinct, but not
unusual, local geological setting. It is clear that resistant chert within certain Lower Cretaceous
formations has been left at specific elevations as lag deposits over older Glen Rose formation limestone,
which is regionally predominant. Such locations were undoubtedly “mapped onto” by prehistoric peoples
and may well have been part of a temporally continuous geospatial knowledge base. As such, the site is
certainly interesting and useful in aiding with increasing the understanding of settlement patterns
regionally and settlement systems in general. The remains of this particular site, however, are too
compromised to add any specific information of value to what is already known about it. Even advanced
research designs would be largely useless, given the obvious degree of disturbance in the form of
redistribution of and damage to the artifact assemblage.

255

The site is considered to be fully recorded. There is no evidence of activities other than basic lithic
acquisition and early stage reduction. Outside the site’s boundaries the remainder of the tract is likewise
considered to be fully investigated. It is recommended that the project be allowed to proceed anywhere
within the described project area without additional cultural resources oversight, as the potential for
archaeological deposits eligible for formal State Archeological Landmark status is negligible.

Introduction and Management Summary
LCRA proposes to construct a new wastewater line that will connect the existing Lake Pointe lift station
to the existing West Travis County Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant (Figure 124, Figure 125). Both
these facilities are on or near Bee Caves Road (FM 2242) just east of SH 71 in the community of Bee
Cave in western Travis County, Texas. The total length of the wastewater line will be approximately
2100 feet and will be constructed within a typical 30 ft-wide construction easement, with a permanent
easement of about 10 feet in width. Total project area is about 1.44 acres. The majority of the line will
be within TxDOT ROW, while the majority of the remainder will be within existing roadways within the
recently developed subdivision.
A cultural resources investigation was conducted during May of 2010 by staff of LCRA’s Archaeology
Services department under authorization of blanket Annual TAC Permit No. 5141 for the year 2010. The
investigation consisted of a file review and field survey. One previously unrecorded archaeological site,
41TV2375 was recorded as a result of the investigations (Figure 126). Site 41TV2375 is a scatter of
historic material that appears to date to the early 1900s, but the location coincides with a structure seen on
the 1896 map of the Austin area. The original structure probably is associated with the Bohls Ranch, and
possibly was built by a German immigrant named Rohrmiller (alternatively Rohrmuller). Both Bohls and
Rohrmiller were early settlers in the Bee Cave area.
The site is located around the base of a large oak tree, and the project already included a plan to bore
under the tree. Due to short notice and an accelerated construction schedule, and following consultation
with the Texas Historical Commission, the area around the site and tree was flagged for avoidance by
construction activities (Figure 127), and construction was allowed to commence on the project during
cultural resources review period.
This report recommends that the archaeological site is fully recorded and that no significant additional
information would be forthcoming from the archaeological deposits, and that the site within the project
area and area of potential effect is not eligible for formal listing as a State Archeological Landmark. The
results of initial conversations with local informants have provided basic information on possible
construction and occupation sequences and are summarized in this interim report. Additional visits with a
Bohls descendent are planned and any new information will be included in the final report that will be
submitted to THC with the Annual Report of Investigations for 2010.
This interim report provides a level of natural and cultural history background necessary for placing the
project in context. The final version of this report will be submitted in LCRA’s Annual Report of
Cultural Resource Investigations which will summarize the more general aspects of the larger study area
in accordance with reporting standards as established by the Council of Texas Archeologists and the
Texas Historical Commission. No federal permitting or funding was involved with this project.
No artifacts were collected and no curation will be necessary.

Study Area
The project area is located within the community of Bee Cave, which is centered near the intersection of
SH71 and Bee Caves Road (FM 2242), which was fully settled by 1870 (Smyrl 2001). Among the
earliest settlers were members of the Bohls family who arrived as early as the 1850s
(http://pr.beecavetexas.com), and the Bohls cabins are a familiar site for those crossing Barton Creek on
SH 71. Another early settler, John Freitag and his family, built a substantial rock house with a nearby
small cemetery, with the earliest graves dating to 1863 or 1865 (Malof and Prikryl 2001:118). Recent

communications with a Freitag family descendent indicated the house and possibly the cemetery were in
jeopardy from continuing development.
Bee Cave is within the Lower Cretaceous Glen Rose formation (Barnes 1981) with shallow Brackett
series soils (Werchan et. al 1974) supporting Live Oak-Ashe Juniper parks and woods (McMahon et. al
1984). The project area is now within heavily developed commercial, residential and highway ROW
properties.
262

Nearby recorded archaeological sites include 41TV1286, which was located just west of the project area
and consisted of the Bohls ranch headquarters. All that remains is is a stone smokehouse that was
incorporated as a storage building for the restaurant that is now located there. Site 41TV2063 was a lithic
scatter recorded at the present wastewater treatment plant, just south of the present project area.

Research Design and Survey Methods
Despite the small project area, due to time constraints and project needs a cultural resources survey was
conducted in order to identify any potential cultural resource sites that may still exist within the areas that
have not been covered by streets or roads. Any such sites would be assessed as to potential for formal
listing as State Archeological Landmarks. Following a review of recorded sites using the online Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas database, it was determined that no sites had been recorded within the project
area.
Field work consisted of surface examination of areas considered potentially relatively undisturbed by
development. No shovel tests were excavated due to the shallow soils and exposed bedrock. A no
collection policy was maintained throughout the investigation.

Results of Investigation
One previously unrecorded archaeological site, 41TV2375 was recorded during the investigation. The
site consisted of about 40 pieces of apparent post-1900 household artifacts that includedglass: aqua, lavender (not "purple") cut crystal (slightly solarized), brown, heavily patinated brown,
crown top, clear; ceramics: salt glazed, plain whiteware, hand painted white ware; metal: a wire nail, an
apparent cast iron stove fragment; and other; apparent pieces of slate.
These items were in area about 30 m long and 10 m wide along the TxDOT ROW and centered on a
large, very old oak tree, which is the most likely explanation for the continued presence of the artifacts.
When the site location was placed on a georeferenced map from 1896, is clearly aligned with the location
of a structure, which is now most likely in the backyard of or underneath a modern house (Figure 128).
The modern USGS topographic map shows a barn or other structure at that location.
Local historian Elaine Perkins was contacted about the location of the site. She indicated it may have
been the Rohrmiller (alternatively Rohrmuller) place. She said Rohrmiller (probably Joannis) was the
builder of a number of stone structures in the Bee Cave area, but that he was gone from census roles by
1880. Rodney Bohls, a descendant of the original Bohls family, indicated that Rohrmiller was an early
settler in the region, reportedly having moved north after serving with Maximilian in Mexico, which
would place his arrival sometime after 1864. Various internet searches failed to find anything definitive
on Rohrmiller.

Summary and Recommendations
LCRA is in the process of constructing a 2100-ft long wastewater line that will connect an existing lift
station to an existing wastewater treatment plant. Almost the entirety of the line will be within TxDOT
ROW or underneath existing paved streets.
A cultural resources survey recorded one historic site. Site 41TV2375 is considered to be fully recorded
and not eligible for formal listing as a State Archeological Landmark. The artifacts do not correspond
with the potential earliest occupation of the site, and any possible structural remains, which would be
limited to foundation remnants, would be located on private property outside the project area. Neither of
the consultants (informants) Elaine Perkins or Rodney Bohls was immediately familiar with the site when
its location was described to them. Rodney Bohls, however, offered to make a field trip to the location in
the near future. If any additional information is forthcoming, it will be included within the final report of
this investigation, which will be submitted within LCRA's annual report of investigations for 2010.
Otherwise, no additional research is considered necessary at this time.
Because of the advanced nature of project scheduling, verbal and email communication with Mark
Denton of the Texas Historical Commission (THC) was conducted on June 2, 2010. The portion of the
project that might potentially impact the site had already been scheduled for boring rather than open
trenching, in order to avoid impacting the large oak tree. Mr. Denton agreed to allow the project to
proceed with the understanding that surface impacts would be avoided at the site until such time as the
project could be reviewed by the THC. The area was flagged by LCRA Archaeology Services staff on
June 8, 2010, and avoidance information was communicated to project managers, who have agreed that
avoidance can be accomplished. Assuming THC agrees with the recommendations in this report, once
concurrence is received, avoidance will no longer be necessary, although no significant impacts to the site
are anticipated.

Introduction and Management Summary
The LCRA’s Conservation Services plan to replace the existing fences along RR3014 in their Cedar Point
Recreation Area and create firebreaks by clearing small trees and brush from a 16-foot wide strip of land
behind the new fences (Figure 129). The existing wood fence posts will be pulled out vertically and new
pipe posts 4” in diameter will be hammered into the ground. No holes will be excavated during the
building of the fence. In addition, a 26 acre area within the park south of RR3014 at the north end of
Maxwells Slough will be cleared of invasive mesquite and juniper using bulldozers and Seppi mulchers.
This area was leased as a RV park in1970s and contains overgrown paved and dirt roads.
The LCRA’s Cedar Point Recreation Area is a 400 acre public tract located on the northwest shore of
Lake Buchanan in Llano County. RR3014 runs roughly parallel to the shoreline and bisects the park into
north and south halves. At the east end of the park, Hi-Line Drive splits off the highway to the north.
The proposed fence and firebreak on the north side of the highway ROW and the north side of Hi-Line
Drive will run the entire length of the park east to west for a distance of 8300 feet. The south fence and
firebreak will be constructed in two sections separated by a stretch of private land, one running eastwards
from the west property line for a distance of 3400 feet and the other starting where the east property line
crosses RR3014 and running westwards for a distance 2500 feet. Two pipe gates will be constructed in
the new fence line on the north side of the highway, one for the park road leading to the boat ramp and the
other for a second park road 1000 feet to the east (Figure 130).
Previous cultural resources surveys have already looked at the project area west of Cowan Creek and the
area on the south side of the highway between the creek and Frazier Road, leaving approximately 5800
linear feet left to be surveyed for the fence and firebreak portion of this project as well as the entire 26acre area north of Maxwells Slough. During these earlier surveys (Prewitt and Kotter 1980, Malof et al.
2004, Malof 2010), three sites were recorded that intersect the current project area: 41LL354, 41LL424,
and 41LL485 (see Figure 130). All three sites are potentially eligible for SAL designation and the
Conservation Services staff has agreed to use a Seppi mulcher in these areas to avoid ground
disturbances.
The survey for the present project was conducted by LCRA’s Archeology staff on July 19, 22, and 27,
2010. A new site, 41LL510, was recorded in the 26-acre area north of Maxwells Slough and the
boundaries of previously-recorded 41LL485 were found to extend into the proposed firebreak north of
RR3014. Both sites do not appear to be eligible for SAL designation and no avoidance measures are
recommended.
Natural Background
The Cedar Point Recreation Area is located within the northeastern corner of the Llano Uplift region of
central Texas. The western half of the project area is underlain by Precambrian Town Mountain granite
which outcrops along the eroded margins of streams (Barnes 1981). Cambrian sandstones outcrop east of
Cowan Creek with large boulders strewing the tops of ridges. The topography of the west half of the
project area consists of low hills and ridges declining northwards towards the Lake Buchanan. On the
east half, RR3014 runs along the spine of a low ridge towards the community of Paradise Point where
side ridges slope north towards the lake and south towards Maxwells Slough, a large inlet. Five small
streams and numerous washes cross the project area from north to south, the largest of these being Cowan
Creek, which appears to flow nearly year around. The other four streams are mere gullies that have
incised down to bedrock. Soils are shallow and consist of gravelly, sandy loams over gravelly clay or
bedrock.

The exceptions are found adjacent to Cowan Creek where dark gray clays greater than 40cm occur and in
other low-lying areas where colluvial sand accumulates.
Three plant communities occur in the project area, mixed woodland, tree savanna, and cedar brake
(Fowler 2005). Mixed woodlands are primarily found east of Cowan Creek and north of RR3014 on a
north-facing slope and are dominated by oaks and juniper. The tree savanna is found mostly west of
Cowan Creek and south of RR3014 and is composed of scattered live oaks with open areas of short to
mid-grasses and mesquite. Cedar brakes occur on steep, rocky slopes and at the heads of drainages.
Previous Investigations
Portions of the present project area were previously surveyed for cultural resources during earlier LCRA
projects. LCRA land along the north edge of the RR3014 ROW west of Cowan Creekwas surveyed for a
2002 fence replacement project (Malof et al. 2004), during which a new prehistoric site, 41LL424, was
recorded and the boundaries of a previously recorded multicomponent site, 41LL354, extended eastwards
towards Cowan Creek. Both sites were assessed as potentially significant and recommended for
avoidance.
LCRA land along the south side of the RR3014 ROW east of Frazier Road was surveyed for a 2009 brush
clearing project. Potentially significant prehistoric sites were recorded adjacent to the highway ROW on
both sides of Cowan Creek. The west side site is apparently a southward extension of 41LL354 cut off by
the highway and contains buried lithics, groundstone, and burned rock. The survey level of work did not
determine how intact these deposits are and as a precaution avoidance was recommended. The site
recorded on the east side of Cowan Creek, 41LL485, extends from the creek eastwards to the summit of a
low ridge. Limited shovel testing close to the creek bank found buried lithics. Because of the potential
for more buried remains, avoidance was recommended for this site as well.
Methodology
The purpose of the field survey was to record any archeological sites within the project area and assess
their potential for designation as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs). The criteria used to determine
SAL status are described in Chapter 26 “Rules of Practice and Procedure” of the Texas State Antiquities
Code. In brief, these criteria include: (1) the potential to contribute to a better understanding of history or
prehistory; (2) preserved and intact deposits; (3) unique and rare attributes; (4) opportunities to test
theories and methods of preservation; and (5) likelihood of vandalism and relic collecting.
Because of the dense vegetation, linear transects through the proposed firebreak area were impossible.
Instead, the survey crew entered from the highway ROW through small openings in the brush to inspect
the ground for cultural material. Shovel tests were placed in areas close to drainages where ground
visibility was poor (STs 1, 4, and 7) and at locations where surface artifacts were found (ST 6). In
addition, shovel testing was done to establish horizontal limits of buried cultural deposits within the
project area by placing tests 20 to 30 meters on either side of any positive test (STs 2 and 3). Each shovel
test was dug in 20cm levels down to bedrock or the clayey B horizon, and the fill screened through a ¼”
wire mesh. All artifacts recovered from the tests were returned to the hole during refilling.
The 26 acre area north of Maxwells Slough had somewhat more open vegetation so that formal transects
spaced at 20 meter intervals were possible. Shovel tests were placed in areas where soils appeared deep
and ground visibility was poor. Shovel tests were also placed at distances of 20 to 35 meters around the
one positive test (ST8) to determine the extent of the buried cultural material. The locations of all the

271

272

shovel tests are shown in Figure 131. Approximately half the 26 acre area is covered by rock outcrop
with pockets of soil only a few centimeters deep, and these areas were not shovel tested.
No artifacts were collected for curation during the project.
Results
The boundaries of one previously recorded site, 41LL485, were found extend into the proposed firebreak
area on the north side of RR3014. Two pieces of chert debitage were recovered in the upper 40cm of soil
from ST 1 placed 14 meters east of Cowan Creek. Shovel tests placed on either side of this test were
negative and no artifacts were seen on the surface. It appears that the relatively dense cultural deposits
reported for the portion of 41LL485 on the south side of the highway do not extend to the north side.
Because of the low artifact density, the portion of 41LL485 within the proposed firebreak and fence
rebuild area north of RR3014 are not eligible for SAL designation. However, the earlier
recommendation (Malof 2010) for avoidance of 41LL354 south of RR3014 still holds for the current
project. The two proposed gate locations on the west side of the creek were inspected and found to be
thoroughly disturbed with little or no original soil surface left in the construction area.
A new archeological site, 41LL510, was recorded in the northern part of the 26-acre area north of
Maxwells Slough, consisting of a light scatter of chert debitage (Figure 132 and Figure 133). The site is
spread out across a low slope without remarkable features other than a low, rocky rise on the northeast
that forms a divide between drainages that lie outside the site area. The general area is covered by brushy
savanna vegetation with mesquite and cedar brush the dominant woody vegetation. Two pieces of
debitage were recovered from Shovel Test 8 between 40 and 60 cm. The soil profile consisted of loamy
sand 73cm thick over a red clay substrate. Shovel Test 9 was dug 35 meters north of ST8 where a large
flake was found on the surface. This test recovered no artifacts in the 26cm of loamy sand that overlies
sandstone rubble. One other flake was noted on the surface on the low ridge top 50 meters east of ST9.
A shovel test (ST 14) placed near this artifact recovered no artifacts and struck bedrock at nine
centimeters.
Site 41LL510 contains few artifacts, all of which are pieces of chert debitage that are mostly dispersed.
Shovel testing indicates that substantial buried cultural deposits are not present at the site. Therefore, it
does not appear to be eligible for State Archeological Landmark designation.

Recommendations
New site 41LL510 and the portion of 41LL485 that lies in the proposed firebreak north of RR3014 do not
appear to the meet the standards for SAL designation. No special precautions need to be taken when
clearing brush in these areas.
From information gathered during the 2009 brush clearing project (Malof 2010), 41LL485 and 41LL354
south of RR3014 are potentially eligible for SAL designation. Additionally, a 2002 fence project (Malof
et al. 2004) found that the portion of 41LL354 north of RR3014 and another site, 41LL424, located near
the park’s west entrance, are potential SALs as well. All brush clearing for the firebreak within these
sites will be done using a Seppi mulcher to avoid ground disturbances.

Electric Distribution Line Easement across LCRA Property at the Travis County Precinct 2
Facility, Travis County, Texas

Introduction and Management Summary
Austin Energy has requested a 15-foot wide easement for an electric distribution line across LCRA Tract
TN-2 that is being leased to Travis County for their Precinct 2 offices and equipment yards (Figure 134).
One segment of the easement will start at FM620 on the northwest corner of the Precinct 2 area and run in
a southeast direction following an existing telephone line ROW to the LCRA T-160 Transmission Line
(Figure 135). Two other segments will extend eastwards through developed parts of the Precinct 2
complex. The total length of the easement is 679 meters covering an area of 0.77 acre.
Most of the easement sections will run through areas that are covered by buildings and paved streets. The
only undeveloped areas are in the northwest corner immediately south of FM620 and a somewhat larger
area between the Precinct 2 south perimeter fence and the T-160 corridor. Both areas have the potential
to contain intact archeological deposits and together they cover approximately 0.1 acre (see Figure 135).
Since clearing and utility pole placement will cause subsurface impacts within these undeveloped portions
of the easement, a field survey was conducted by two members of LCRA’s contracted archeology staff.
The survey took place on August 2, 2010. One new archeological site, 41TV2382, was recorded
immediately south of the Travis County Precinct 2 area (see Figure 135, Figure 136). The site is
classified as a short term camp because of the small amount of mussel shell and burned rock in addition to
lithic debitage and tools. This material is restricted to the surface and scattered by previous transmission
line construction and maintenance activities. The site is considered to be fully recorded and is not
considered eligible for formal listing as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL).
.
Natural Background
The project area is located in the Balcones Canyonlands on the east edge of the Edwards Plateau. The
underlying bedrock is limestone belonging to the Lower Cretaceous Glen Rose Formation (Barnes 1974).
The proposed easements will run across the upper slope of the divide separating the Colorado River from
its tributary, Bear Creek. Limestone outcrops are frequent with smaller areas of stony, clayey Tarrant
soils up to 20cm thick (Werchan et al. 1974). Areas that have not been cleared for development are
covered by cedar breaks, dense stands of Ashe juniper with scattered live oaks and Texas oaks (Fowler
2005). Along the edges of cleared ROWs, the survey crew saw Texas pistache, flame sumac, and
mesquite.
Previous Investigations
Most of LCRA Tracks TN-1 and TN-2, which lie south of Mansfield Dam, were surveyed by Prewitt &
Associates for a 1980 LCRA brush clearing project (Kotter 1980). Three sites, 41TV525-527, were
recorded, all on ridge tops or slopes on the north side of Bear Creek. Site 41TV525 was recorded as a
lithic procurement locale containing low densities of debitage and battered cobbles. Site 41TV526 is
situated on a geomorphic bench at the head of a small tributary to Bear Creek and contains a few flakes,
scattered burned rock, and mussel shell fragments. Site 41TV527 contains early to mid 20th century
domestic trash and possible foundation stones. There is also a minor prehistoric component with lithics
and possible burned rock. None of the sites was considered eligible for formal designation as SALs or for
listing on the National Register of Historic Places because of previous disturbances.
In 2004, LCRAs Archeology Services staff surveyed segments of the T-160 and T161 corridors with a high
probability for prehistoric sites, mainly areas close to streams (Hixson et al. 2006). The portion of the
corridor that crosses the current project area was not surveyed because of its distance from Bear Creek, the
nearest stream. Six new prehistoric sites were recorded: 41TV2108, 41TV2110, and 41TV2119 through

41TV2122, all west of the present project area. A seventh prehistoric site, made up of a scatter of debitage,
grinding stones, and burned rock, was also recorded as new (and given the trinomial of 41TV2109) but was
later found to be part of a previously recorded site, 41TV1228. The most significant of these sites is
41TV2108, located on the right or north bank of Bear Creek 350 meters east from where the proposed
easement crosses the T-162 line. It is made up a light surface scatter of stone tools and debitage along with
a stone hearth. The hearth is eroding out of the ground at a spot west from the creek channel and north of
the T-161 line.
Methodology
The purpose of the field survey was to record any archeological sites within the project area and assess
their potential for designation as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs). The criteria used to determine
SAL status are described in Chapter 26 “Rules of Practice and Procedure” of the Texas State Antiquities
Code. In brief, these criteria include: (1) the potential to contribute to a better understanding of history or
prehistory; (2) preserved and intact deposits; (3) unique and rare attributes; (4) opportunities to test
theories and methods of preservation; and (5) likelihood of vandalism and relic collecting.
All undeveloped areas within the proposed distribution line easement were surveyed on foot. These areas
are shown in yellow in Figure 2. Three shovel tests were dug where there was soil cover, each a circular
hole 35cm in diameter dug in 20cm levels down to bedrock or the B horizon. All fill was screened
through ¼” mesh for artifact recovery. Two shovel tests (ST1 and ST2) were placed south of the Precinct
2 perimeter fence and one (ST3) was placed in the area immediately south of FM620 (see Figure 2).
No artifacts were collected for curation during the project.
Results
One new archeological site, 41TV2382, was recorded during the survey (see Figure 136). It lies south of
the Precinct 2 complex where the proposed easement crosses the T-162/197 corridor. Most of the site
area is spread out across the nearly level surface of a limestone bench which has been cleared of trees and
brush. Limestone outcrops over roughly half the ground surface with the rest covered by thin, clayey soil.
The ground rises sharply to the north towards the Precinct 2 fence and slopes more gently to the south
towards other LCRA transmission line corridors. Further down slope about 200 meters south of the south
edge of the site flows Bear Creek. Areas outside the transmission line corridors are thickly wooded with
cedar and scattered live oaks.
All cultural material was observed on the surface, mostly concentrated in an area of the transmission line
ROW adjacent to the northeast side of the existing telephone line. Lithic artifacts include the distal
fragment of a thin biface, perhaps a projectile point, with one lateral edge "crudely" beveled, three pieces
of debitage, and one split cobble. Several burned rock rocks were noted in this area along with one whole
mussel shell and several smaller shell fragments. These items are perhaps the remains of a hearth and
associated food. Several other flakes and one core were found in the general area within a 20 meter
radius. Because the corridor has soil little soil cover – it is mostly rock outcrop - shovel tests were placed
on the wooded slopes immediately to the north and south. Shovel test 1 struck bedrock at 10cm and
Shovel Test 2 struck red clay subsoil at 18cm. Neither test recovered any cultural material.
Site 41TV2382 probably represents a small knapping station or short term camp. It is similar to 41TV526
in its topographic setting and composition and amount of cultural material. At 41TV2382 most of the
cultural material lies on the surface within the T-162/197 corridor and has been displaced by transmission
line construction and maintenance activities. It is considered fully recorded and no further investigation is
recommended.
282

Recommendations
One archeological site, 41TV2382, was found along the route of the proposed distribution line easement.
It contains a small amount of prehistoric cultural material that has been dispersed by construction and
maintenance of the transmission line and is not considered eligible for SAL designation. It is
recommended that Austin Energy be allowed to use the easement for their distribution line.

Introduction and Management Summary
The LCRA’s Conservation Services plan to clear brush and small cedar and mesquite trees in the
northeastern part of the LCRA’s Cedar Point Recreation Area on the northwestern shore of Lake
Buchanan in Llano County.(Figure 137). The clearing will be done using bulldozer, Seppi mulcher, and
hand saws. The 80 acre project area is bordered by Cowan Creek on the west, Lake Buchanan on the
north, a private subdivision on the east, and the north ROW fence of FM3014 on the south. A 15 foot
wide strip of land adjacent to the north side of the ROW fence was previously surveyed by LCRA
Archeology Services staff for a proposed firebreak. This survey found a small area of debitage that
appears to be an extension of 41LL485 previously recorded on the south side of RR3014. No avoidance
measures were recommended for this portion of 41LL485.
The Cedar Point Recreation Area was surveyed for cultural resources in 1979 by Prewitt and Associates
for an LCRA brush clearing project (Prewitt and Kotter 1980). One site, 41LL353, was recorded that lies
within the current area. The site is located on the upper slope of a ridge and contains two areas with light
scatters of debitage. One edge modified flake and some mussel shell were also noted. As was standard
methodology at the time, the survey relied completely on surface inspection without shovel testing. Since
buried cultural deposits could be present at this site and elsewhere in the project area, LCRA’s
Archeology Services staff conducted an intensive survey to relocate 41LL353 and shovel test it and other
areas with a moderate to high potential for prehistoric archeological sites (Figure 138). The survey took
place on three separate days during August and September, 2010.
During the survey one new archeological site, 41LL511, was recorded at the west end of the project on a
wooded slope overlooking Cowan Creek (Figure 139). It contains a light to moderate scatter of buried
lithics, mostly chert debitage, over a 0.29 acre area. Since the site is located on a non-aggrading
landform, this material must have migrated down from the surface into the sandy loam soil. There is no
evidence of features such as hearths or discrete components, and the site does not appear to be eligible for
State Archeological Landmark designation. The previously recorded site, 41LL353, is plotted on a ridge
east of Cowan Creek. The present survey could not relocate this site with certainty because of the low
artifact density. The general area is rocky with thin soil cover where intact buried cultural deposits are
unlikely. This site, as observed during the current survey, does meet the standards for SAL designation.
Since no sites eligible or potentially eligible for SAL designation are known to be present in the project
area, it is recommended that the brush clearing proceed without any avoidance measures. As always,
standard emergency discovery provisions are applicable to this project. Should the crew uncover any
presently unknown buried archeological features during the brush clearing, then work should cease in the
immediate area of the discovery and the LCRA Archeology Services staff should be notified at 1-800-7765272, ext. 6714 so that the find can be assessed in consultation with the THC. In such a situation, clearing
can continue in other areas where no archeological materials are present.
No artifacts were collected during the survey and therefore no curation is needed. There is no Federal
funding or permitting involved that required a Section 106 review.

Natural Background
The Cedar Point Recreation Area is located within the northeastern corner of the Llano Uplift region of
central Texas on the northwest shore of Lake Buchanan. The lake is an artificial reservoir created in the
1930s by the construction of Buchanan Dam across the Colorado River 15 miles downstream from the
park. The northern shoreline of the park is about a half mile from the river channel.

Cowan Creek forms the western boundary of the project area. It is by far the largest stream in the park
and usually flows throughout most of the year. However at the time of the survey it was dry. Several
other small arroyos enter the lake to the east of Cowan Creek. Most of these smaller stream channels join
Cowan Creek further north in areas now inundated by the lake. Between these drainages are low ridges
that slope towards the north and form low promontories when the lake it at fool pool.
The western half of the project area is underlain by Precambrian Town Mountain granite and eastern half
by Cambrian sandstones (Barnes 1981). The granite provides the parent material for the gravelly, loamy
Click series and the sandstones the Nebgen series (Goerdel 2000). The exceptions are found adjacent to
Cowan Creek where dark gray clays greater than 40cm occur and in other low-lying areas where colluvial
sand accumulates.
Mixed woodlands cover much of the project area, dominated by oaks and juniper (Fowler 2005). Cedar
brakes occur on steep, rocky slopes and at the heads of drainages.
Previous Investigations
The entire Cedar Point Recreation Area was surveyed by Prewitt and Associates in 1979 for an LCRA
brush clearing project (Prewitt and Kotter 1980). During this survey, one site, 41LL353, was recorded
within the boundary of the present project. The site is situated on the northwest side of a ridge of land
extending into Lake Buchanan. Little is known about the site and it has not been shovel tested by
archeologists. The original survey reported two areas with light scatters of flakes and few mussel shells.
Most of the artifacts were observed in a dirt road. Archeological material was thought to be confined to
the surface and to largely intact. Avoidance was recommended.
A survey by LCRA Archeology Services staff for a fence and firebreak project earlier this year found that
a previously recorded site, 41LL485, extends north of RR3014 for an unknown distance on the east side
of Cowan Creek. The portion of the site within the firebreak area was assessed as ineligible for SAL
designation. The THC concurred with this assessment.

Methodology
The purpose of the field survey was to record any archeological sites within the project area and assess
their potential for designation as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs). The criteria used to determine
SAL status are described in Chapter 26 “Rules of Practice and Procedure” of the Texas State Antiquities
Code. In brief, these criteria include: (1) the potential to contribute to a better understanding of history or
prehistory; (2) preserved and intact deposits; (3) unique and rare attributes; (4) opportunities to test
theories and methods of preservation; and (5) likelihood of vandalism and relic collecting.
The survey was restricted to areas with a moderate to high potential for prehistoric sites; for this project,
these areas were defined being within 150 meters of perennial or intermittent streams (Figure 138).
Previous work within the park has shown that prehistoric sites that are regulatorily significant are found
adjacent to these types of streams (Malof et al 2004, Malof 2010). These areas included the east side of
Cowan Creek and both sides of two unnamed right tributaries of this creek, totaling 28 acres or 35% of
the 80 acre project area. These moderate to high site potential areas were intensively surveyed on foot
with shovel testing. Thirty-three shovel tests were excavated, each a circular hole dug in 20cm levels
down to the B-horizon or bedrock (see Figure 139). No alluvium has been mapped in the project area and
any cultural material would be expected on and near ground surface. An attempt was made to spread the
tests out across the survey areas to insure adequate coverage. Some areas, mostly the ridge tops, had little

289

if any soil cover and these were not tested. The fill from the shovel tests was screened through a ¼” wire
mesh to recover any cultural material. All non-diagnostic artifacts were returned to the shovel test hole
during refilling. Since no diagnostic artifacts were found during the survey, no artifacts were collected for
curation during this project.
Results
During the survey one new site, 41LL511, was recorded (see Figure 139). This is a prehistoric lithic
scatter located on a densely wooded lobe facing northwest towards Cowan Creek. This site contains a
light subsurface scatter of lithic debitage within a 0.29 acre area. One small biface fragment was
recovered from one of the six shovel tests excavated in or adjacent to the site area. The debitage mostly
consists of small flakes that are without cortex, produced by both soft and hard hammer percussion, and
of different colored and textured Edwards chert. All have migrated downwards from the surface and were
recovered from different elevations down to depth of 50 to 60cm. No clearly identifiable hearth stones
were seen at the site. The lack of features and discrete components suggests a low information yield for
this site and no further investigations are recommended.
The previously recorded site, 41LL353, could not be relocated with certainty, probably because of the low
artifact density and the fact that the dirt roads through the area were overgrown with grass and forbs at the
time of the survey. When the site was originally recorded thirty years ago, the roads were still in use and
provided good ground visibility. Shovel testing demonstrated that the soil cover is thin on the upper ridge
slope. None of the six shovel tests placed within or near where 41LL353 is plotted recovered any cultural
material and suggests that extensive buried cultural material is not present in the area. The only
indication of site was one isolated surface flake found in the south part of where 41LL353 is plotted. The
low artifact density and lack of buried cultural deposits suggests little research potential.
Previously recorded site 41LL485 does not appear to extend into the project area. It northern limits end a
few meters north of the RR3014 ROW.
Of the 33 shovel tests dug during the project, only four were positive for prehistoric cultural material.
These were tests that happened to be placed within the bounds of the newly-recorded site 41LL511. A
few other tests recovered modern trash, mostly in the upper 20cm of soil. The only surface artifact was
the one flake found in the southern part of 41LL353.
Recommendations
Two archeological sites, new site 41LL511 and the previously recorded site 41LL353, have been recorded
in the proposed brush clearing area. Neither appears to the meet the standards for SAL designation and
no special precautions or avoidance measures are recommended. Elsewhere in the project area, brush
clearing can proceed in the manner previously described. However, standard emergency discovery
provisions still apply should archeological features be encountered.

Travis Substation Expansion, Kerr County, Texas

Introduction and Management Summary
The Lower Colorado River Authority is planning to expand their Kerrville Travis Substation located on
the northeastern edge of Kerrville in Kerr County (Figure 140). The substation will expand to the
northeast about 200 feet and southeast about 100 feet from its present location into areas that are currently
undeveloped and covered by woods. The expansion will encompass 2.17 acres (Figure 141).
The field survey by LCRA’s Archeology Services staff took place on September 22, 2010. The entire
project area was walked over and areas with ground exposure examined. No shovel testing was done
because of lack of soil due to erosion and past land clearing practices. The only artifacts seen on the
survey were articles of recent trash and few pieces of rusted iron.
One site, 41KR704, was recorded as a result of the survey. It consists of a segment of an old stone wall,
probably a field fence, that has completely fallen down into a linear rubble pile 62 feet in length along the
east side Travis Street at the northwest corner of the project area (Figure 142 and Figure 143). This 62foot segment is the portion that lies within the project boundaries, however the wall continues to the
northeast outside the project area. Traces of the wall extend another 100 feet to the southwest between
the rubble pile and the existing substation, but this stretch has mostly been obliterated by what appears to
be efforts by the city to remove soil slippage from Travis Street (Figure 5). A ditch approximately 18”
deep had also recently been dug between Travis Street and the stone wall, probably by the city to divert
rain runoff. The wall profile of this trench shows only the gravelly clay substrate without visible cultural
material.
The wall was measured and photographed during the project. Since there are no cultural deposits
associated with the wall, further field investigation will yield little additional information. The site does
not appear to meet any of the criteria for designation as a State Archeological Landmark and the
substation expansion project should be allowed to proceed.
.
No artifacts were collected during the survey and therefore no curation is needed. There is no Federal
funding or permitting involved that required a Section 106 review.
Natural Background
The project area is located in south central part of the Edwards Plateau. The immediate area around the
substation is underlain by bedrock belonging to the Glen Rose formation (Barnes 1981). This formation
consists of alternating layers of limestone, dolomite, and marls that erodes into a stairstep topography.
Chert is absent from this formation. Two hundred meters to the east, the Fort Terrett formation outcrops
on the summit of a high hill at elevations above 1800 feet above sea level (the project area is between
1677 and 1683 feet above sea level). The Fort Terrett formation is made up of limestone and dolomite
and chert. Along Quinlan Creek 150 meters to the west, the surface geology consists of Holocene or
Pleistocene terrace deposits.
The soils in the area are mapped as Kerrville-Urban land complex (Dittemore and Coburn 1986). This
complex of soils is found in hilly topography on the edges of developed areas. Kerrville soils
predominate where the natural ground surface is undisturbed. Since they form on a parent material
derived from interbedded marl and limestone, they are typically associated with the Glen Rose formation.
A woods of cedar and ligustrum has grown over the project area. This woods appears to have originated
fairly recently since the area has evidence of extensive clearing by bulldozer in the form of large push
piles, in addition to the fact that one of the principal trees, ligustrum, is non-native having escaped from
neighborhood landscaping.

Previous Investigations
The T-383 Transmission Line running southwards from the Kerrville Travis Substation was surveyed by
Espey, Huston, and Associates for an LCRA pole replacement project in 1995 (Taylor and Bates 1995).
The EH&A archeologists surveyed areas within a 30 meter diameter area around existing pole
replacement locations. Since a pole is located adjacent to the southeast corner of the current project area,
it is possible this area was inspected by EH&A. If so, then no sites were recorded at that location.
Methodology
The purpose of the survey was to record any archeological sites within the project area and assess their
potential for State Archeological Landmark designation. The survey involved walking over the entire
project area and inspecting all exposures of ground surface, including gully cuts, and other eroded areas.
Past land clearing and subsequent erosion on the slope appears to have removed the upper soil zone,
making shovel testing unnecessary. Surface visibility was good due to sparse ground cover.
Results
One site, 41KR704, was recorded during the survey. The site consists of a stone field fence which runs
along the east side of Travis Street a few feet within the wooded area north the existing substation. A 62foot stretch of the wall within the project area appears mostly undisturbed but has fallen in place into a
linear pile 6 feet wide and about two feet high with small trees growing out of it (Figure 143). The wall is
composed of dry-laid, undressed limestone boulders. Considering the size of the rubble pile, the wall was
relatively high or wide for field fences. An old barbed wire fence supported by cedar posts runs along
the west (street) side of the collapsed wall. This wire fence is in a state of ruin and was probably built no
earlier than the mid 20th century, so this presumably makes the stone fence much earlier. Both fences
continue northwards up the hill slope and outside the project area.
Traces of the stone fence – a boulder here and three – extend for another 100 feet from the south end of
the rubble pile towards the substation (see Figure 142, Figure 144). This section has been severely
damaged by road clearing apparently carried by the city.
The project area north of the existing substation is covered by recent plastic and paper trash. No artifacts
from the mid-20th century or older were seen with the possible exception of one rusted metal cam part
from some sort of engine.
Recommendations
The one site recorded in the project area consists of a section of a stone field wall probably dating to late
19th or early 20th century. It apparently marked an old property boundary before the town of Kerrville
expanded westwards in the mid 20th century. If the wall ever continued in a southwesterly direction past
the substation, it has been completely destroyed by urban development. This feature was fully recorded
within the project area and further investigation would yield little additional information. It is
recommended that the substation expansion project proceed as planned.

Abstract
In September and October 2010, the Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Cultural Resources
Services staff conducted a cultural resource survey of the LCRA’s proposed Kimbro Substation Project in
northeastern Travis County, Texas. The project will consist of the construction of a new electrical
substation on an approximately 10-acre sized tract adjacent to LCRA’s existing T-421 electrical
transmission line. The project will also include the construction of a 305 meter long, 24.3 meter wide
access road corridor that will extend from Manda Carlson Road to the substation site.
As a result of pedestrian survey and shovel testing, one new cultural resource site, 41TV2384, was
recorded and assessed. Site 41TV2384 is an historic farmstead site that was originally settled in the very
late nineteenth or early twentieth century. Although no house or other outbuildings are still standing, the
underground portion of a brick-lined cistern is still present in the northern part of the site. Artifacts
observed on ground surface and recovered during shovel testing at the site date from the very late
nineteenth/early twentieth century through the mid twentieth century and are generally nondescript and
lacking in diversity. Through these years the land was probably used chiefly for the production of row
crops such as cotton and corn.
During the time that the field survey was being undertaken, the LCRA decided to shift the substation tract
northwestward so that the cistern cavity would not conflict with the desired construction area. The
western one-quarter of the artifact scatter associated with site 41TV2384 is within the redefined
substation boundaries. The cistern lies about three meters east of the east boundary of the redesigned
substation tract. Site 41TV2384 is considered to have been fully documented during the survey, and it is
assessed as not meriting formal designation as a State Archeological Landmark. It is recommended that
construction of the electrical substation and associated access road be allowed to proceed without any
further cultural resource investigations.
Since no artifacts were collected during the investigation, no curation of artifacts will be needed.

Introduction
The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) is proposing to construct the Kimbro Substation on an
approximately 10-acre sized tract adjacent to its existing T-421 electrical transmission line in northeastern
Travis County, Texas (Figure 145). The actual substation construction will affect about 2.5 acres. The
project will also include the construction of a 305 meter long, 24.3 meter wide access road corridor that
will extend from Manda Road to the substation site.
During the time that the field survey was being undertaken, the LCRA decided to shift the substation tract
northwestward so that a subsurface cistern cavity would not conflict with the desired construction area.
Both the originally proposed substation tract and the revised substation tract, which includes the
northwestern quarter of the original tract, were entirely field surveyed.
The intensive cultural resource survey of the proposed project area was conducted by LCRA’s Cultural
Resource Services staff member Daniel J. Prikryl (Principal Investigator) and contracted archaeologists
Glenn Goode and Charles A. Hixson in September and October 2010. The investigation was conducted
under Texas Antiquities Committee Blanket Permit #5528, which was issued to the LCRA by the Texas
Historical Commission for Calendar Year 2010. Since there is no federal funding or federal permitting, a
Section 106 review under the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 is not applicable. The project
was undertaken in accordance with methods for fieldwork and reporting as proposed by the Texas
Council of Archeologists (1992).
Environmental Background
The project area is situated within the Blackland Prairie geographic province (Arbingast et al. 1976:13).
The surface geology consists of clays and marls of the Cretaceous-aged Navarro and Taylor Groups,
Undivided (Barnes 1974). Soil mapped within the project area is the Houston Black clay (Werchan et al.
1974). The upper one meter of the Houston Black clay typically is a very dark gray clay with subangular
to angular, blocky structure that contains a few strongly cemented calcium carbonate concretions. It is
moderately alkaline and is black in color when wet.
According to Arbingast el al. (1976:13), the Blackland Prairie’s original vegetation commonly consists of
bunch and short grasses. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries much of the prairie was converted
to croplands (McMahan et al. 1984). By the 1970s, production of crops, principally cotton and corn, had
declined with the land becoming pastureland for cattle.
Culture History
The project area is located within the Central Texas archeological region (Ellis et al. 1995). The Central
Texas archeological record has typically been divided into four main subdivisions. These periods, in
chronological order from most ancient to most recent are: the Paleoindian, the Archaic, the Late
Prehistoric, and the Historic periods. These periods are differentiated mostly by broadly defined
subsistence patterns. The prehistoric part of this chronology has been subdivided further into phases
based largely on changes in material culture, especially projectile point styles. Combined, this
information begins to describe the 11,500 year history of human occupation in Central Texas.

Substation Project Area.

A longstanding chronology of Prewitt (1981, 1985), has recently been revised by Johnson and Goode
(1994) and Johnson (1995), who utilized new lines of evidence based on climatic and geomorphological
data to redefine period divisions. This can be contrasted with Collins (1995), who indicates climatic
variables at times were somewhat different than those of Johnson and Goode. Though these chronologies
are invaluable to our knowledge base for Central Texas archeology, they must be used as a stepping-stone
to expand our understanding of the cultural history of an area by addressing the question of why changes
occurred in various regions and cultures when they did.
Prehistoric site types in Central Texas consist of camps, caches, isolated artifacts, interments, cemeteries,
kill/butcher locales, quarry/workshops, lithic scatters, and rock art sites (Collins 1995:363). Central
Texas is perhaps best known for the many burned rock midden sites that occur on the Edwards Plateau.
Numerous excavations of major campsites have been conducted along the larger streams and rivers (cf.
Prewitt 1982). Such excavations have demonstrated that Central Texas was occupied for at least 11,500
years prior to the coming of Europeans. These also show that throughout these millennia, prehistoric
peoples were nomadic hunter-gatherers who moved across the landscape exploiting seasonally available
plant and animal resources.
Histories of several counties have been compiled by the LCRA staff for historic background information
(LCRA files). The region now known as Travis County was first visited by Domingo Terán de los Rios
around 1690 (Smyrl 1999). By 1730 the Spanish had visited the Barton Springs area. Stephen F. Austin
brought settlers into the area by 1830, and shortly thereafter forts were established at Wilbarger’s Bend,
Webber’s Prairie, and Gilleland Creek, among other locations, due to Comanche depredations. Waterloo
was settled by 1838, and in 1840 was renamed Austin and declared the capital of the short-lived Republic
of Texas. Shortly thereafter Travis County was established, and initially covered 40,000 square miles,
from which numerous other counties were later derived. Corn, wheat, cattle and sheep were the economic
mainstays of the 1850s and ‘60s, while the state government provided the impetus for continued growth.
By 1880 the region had begun to recover from the economic hardships of the Civil War and
Reconstruction. The railroad appeared in 1871, and spurred development, particularly in the cotton
industry. Travis County enjoyed a rich ethnic mix as black residents stayed or moved into the area, along
with Germans, Swedes, and Mexicans. Tenant farming was common until the 1930s, when lowered
production in exhausted soils removed much of the profit margin. By the 1960s larger farms were
producing hay and sorghum, while sheep and goat production also increased. Travis County is presently
home to the University of Texas and numerous state agencies, which provide much of the employment in
the region, and high-tech firms have recently added additional opportunities. Many people now choose to
live in communities outside of Austin and commute to jobs in the city.
The project area is located in northeastern Travis County about 3.5 miles east of the New Sweden
community, which was founded in 1873 and was originally known as Knight’s Branch (Smyrl 2002a).
With the construction of the New Sweden Lutheran Church in 1876, the community became known as
New Sweden, and as implied by the name, many immigrants of Swedish origin were settling in the
immediate area at that time. By 1882, a cotton gin was operating at New Sweden and a post office was in
service from 1887 to 1902. Two other early communities, Carlson and Manda, were located even closer
to the project area at distances just one mile to the north and south, respectively, of the survey tract.
Manda was founded in the mid 1880s with a cotton gin being in operation in 1886 and the Manda
Methodist Church being organized in 1892 (Christianson 2002). The children at Manda went to school at
New Sweden, Carlson, and Willow Branch. Carlson is known to have had a school by 1881, and a store
a several residences were still present in the mid 1930s (Smyrl 2002b). In 1947, all schools in the area
were consolidated with the founding of the Manda Common School District. It remained a school district
until 1963. Today, the only remaining structures associated with these three communities are the New
Sweden Church and the old school house building at Manda.

Previous Investigations
Two areas within five miles of the current project have received a considerable amount of archeological
investigation at the survey level, one in the uplands northeast of Manor and the other along Brushy Creek,
a major perennial stream that flows from west to east across the Blackland Prairie. The Manor survey
was conducted in 1987 by Lone Star Archeological Services for a proposed City of Austin airport that
was never constructed (Briggs 1988). Roughly 1,000 acres were surveyed during which 20 cultural
resource sites were recorded. Nearly all the sites represent homesteads containing house and other
structures constructed during the late 19th or early 20th century. Most if not all the homesteads had
underground cisterns and, when noted, these were at least partially constructed of brick.
Only three of the sites had prehistoric components, two of which represented habitation sites. One of the
prehistoric habitation sites is situated less than 100 meters from the channel of Wilbarger Creek while the
other is situated on the top of a high hill overlooking the same stream at the same location as one of the
historic homesteads. In contrast, the historic sites were usually built of the upper slopes of low lobe-like
hills several hundred meters from the nearest drainage.
In the 1970s and 1980s, Robert Stiba recorded 10 prehistoric along a one-mile stretch of Brushy Creek
north of the current project area (THC Site Atlas). Four extensive prehistoric habitation sites were
recorded along with six smaller sites. One of the larger sites, 41WM727, contained a large burned rock
midden and evidence of three or four human burials. The burials contained grave offerings such as
marine shell ornaments and groundstone artifacts that were thought to be atlatl weights. The burials could
date to around AD 600 based on the possible association with Darl points. Points collected by Stiba at
this site span the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods.
An extensive site, 41WM959, found by Stiba on the north side of the creek contained two smaller
middens and at least one burial. Another extensive campsite, 41WM958, has a long sequence of
projectile points beginning with the Late Paleoindian period and continuing through the period of
Scallorn arrow points. The smaller sites, such as 41WM960, appear to be more restricted in time span
typically dating from the latter part of the Late Archaic through the Late Prehistoric. Stiba found a Clovis
point at one of these smaller sites, 41WM956, located on a bluff on the north side of Brushy Creek.
In 1994, the Texas Department of Transportation surveyed the ROW of the proposed FM973 expansion
using backhoe trenches on the flood plain of Brushy Creek along the same stretch where Stiba recorded
sites. The survey recorded four buried sites, 41WM815-818. Most of these sites contained very sparse
cultural deposits within the road ROW with the exception of 41WM815 where buried hearth features
were exposed in the trenches (TxDOT 1999). TxDOT contracted with the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL) to conduct data recovery from the site (Brownlow 2003). The TARL excavations
identified two buried occupational surfaces separated vertically by about 20cm. A large oven feature was
uncovered on the upper surface. It was a shallow bowl-shaped depression two meters in diameter and
lined with burned rocks. The oven matrix contained large amounts of charcoal, some from eastern camas
bulbs, and fragmented animal bone representing deer and numerous other taxa. Radiocarbon dates from
charcoal in this feature dated to between 775 B.C. and 370 B.C. Two Montell points were found in
close association with this feature, which is consistent with the radiocarbon dates. Castroville and Lange
points were also recovered from the upper occupation zone. The lower occupation was identified
primarily by an increase in artifact density and a circular scatter of burned rocks.
In 1999 LCRA archeologists conducted a survey in the area adjacent to the south and east sides of Elgin
for a wastewater pipeline project (Prikryl and Malof 1999). The entire length of 6.3 miles was surveyed
resulting in the recording of three sites, 41BP540-542. Site 41BP540 is an historic house site located on
the second terrace of an intermittent creek and was probably built in the early 20th century, based on the
306

presence of wire nails. The site contains a brick-lined cistern and building debris from the house in the
form of bricks and cinder blocks. Only clear bottle glass was recovered from the shovel testing, which
suggests the occupancy of the house began after 1915, perhaps by tenant farmers or sharecroppers who
grew cotton when demand was high during World War I.
Site 41BP541 is a Late Archaic campsite located near the confluence of Elm Creek and one of its
tributaries. It consists of a light scatter of fire-cracked rocks and lithics within the pipeline easement. Site
41BP542 is another prehistoric campsite located at the head of an upland drainage on the edge of the Post
Oak Savanna. The cultural material, made up of lithics and small burned rock fragments, was recovered
in the upper, sandy soil zone and was thought to disturbed. Both sites demonstrate that smaller streams
near the boundary of the Blackland Prairie and the Post Oak Savanna where locales for campsites.
Survey Methodology
Field survey methods used during the project consisted of a 100 percent intensive pedestrian survey along
with shovel testing. During the pedestrian survey, the project area was walked on 30 m zig-zag transects.
Bare and eroded patches of ground surface were inspected. Shovel tests, which consisted of small 35 to
40 cm (13.5 to 15 inch) diameter holes, were judgmentally placed in areas of high probability having poor
ground surface visibility and also to help determine the boundaries of any archeological sites. Since the
main focus of the investigation was to search for historic period remains, it was assumed that such
remains would be present on ground surface or would be shallowly buried. Therefore, the shovel tests
were generally only dug to depths of 30 to 50 cm below ground surface or to the top of the B horizon
clay. The shovel tests were excavated in 20 cm increments with all fill being screened through ¼ inch
wire mesh. A total of 20 shovel tests were excavated within the approximately 23 acres that were
examined. This number well exceeds the Texas Historical Commission’s minimum requirements.
All shovel tests were carefully backfilled immediately after excavation to restore the ground surface to its
original appearance. Further, no artifacts were removed from the property. Any artifacts observed on the
ground surface or found in the shovel tests were examined, analyzed, and photographed in the field, as
necessary, and then placed back in their original locations. Appendix 1 provides lists the soil descriptions
from each shovel test, while Appendix 2 provides descriptions of the artifacts recovered from the shovel
tests.
Results of Investigations
One site, 41TV2384, was recorded during the survey. The site consists of a scatter of late
nineteenth/early twentieth century to mid twentieth century historic period artifacts and one subsurface
feature, a brick-lined cistern. The site area covers an area measuring about 120x120 meters (Figure 146).
About a quarter of the site area, approximately 0.6 acres, overlaps the final substation location while the
majority of the site lies east and southeastward in the originally designated substation area.
A review of the 1904 Bastrop, Texas 30’ USGS map shows two structures in the vicinity of the site, with
the northern structure mostly likely corresponding with the site location. The 1948 Elgin, Texas 15’
USGS map shows a dense cluster of five structures at the site location. These structures probably
represent the former domestic residence and four associated outbuildings. The aerial map dated to 1970
in the 1974 Travis County Soil Survey (Werchan et al. 1974) indicates that only one of the five structures
shown on the 1948 map was still standing at that time. Presently, there are no standing structures at the
site. However, one isolated outbuilding or small cottage that is probably associated with the second
historic structure shown on the previously mentioned 1904 Bastrop, Texas 30’ quad is visible in the
distance on the adjacent property tract to the south of the project area. That structure is probably about

Site 41TV2384 is situated on a low slope 350 meters west of Little Willow Creek, an intermittent stream
which joins with Willow Creek to enter Wilbarger Creek seven miles to the south. The area was
formerly under cultivation but is presently pastureland that is covered by wild grasses and forbs. No
woody vegetation grows in the immediate area. The soils are composed of a dark gray to olive gray to
black clay. The LCRA’s existing T-421 transmission line crosses the south end of the site area from east
to west.
The only visible feature in the site is the subterranean portion of a cistern that was presumably built
adjacent to a house to collect rain runoff from the roof. It lies nine feet to the east of the final designated
substation project area. No collar or other above ground parts of the cistern have survived and no other
features associated with the house were evident. The entrance to the interior of the cistern is a circular
hole flush with the ground and largely obscured by weeds. The circular hole measures 33 inches in
diameter. Someone has made an effort to block the opening with three T-posts, a metal pipe, and piece of
limber.
The underground chamber of the cistern appears to be bottle-shaped and about 12 feet wide in maximum
diameter near the bottom. The bottom of the cistern was covered by trash floating in water so the true
depth of the chamber could not be estimated. The distance from the ground surface to the top of the trash
was estimated to be 14 feet. Much of the trash within the cistern is made up of large plastic tubs and
plastic bottles. The sides of the chamber are lined with orange-brown bricks set in lime mortar. Traces of
a concrete coating were seen although this could represent more recent repair work.
Artifact scatters occur in two areas of the site. The larger area includes the area within a 20 meter radius
of the cistern and it also extends 90 meters further to the south so that it covers an area of about 1.3 acre.
The northwestern portion of this scatter extends into the current project area. A second, smaller discrete
surface scatter of artifacts covering about 0.4 acre was observed centered about 65 meters east of the
cistern. It is probable that the scatter around the cistern is associated with a former residential structure
while the scatter to the east may associated with a larger structure, perhaps a barn, that shows on a 1951
aerial map.
Both scatters contain essentially the same types of artifacts which include clear and purple bottle glass
fragments, a few milk glass fragments, whiteware sherds, Bristol glaze stoneware sherds, flower pot
sherds, a few brick fragments, and miscellaneous metal fragments. Clear bottle glass fragments and
whiteware sherds make up most of the observed cultural material. The artifact assemblage
predominantly points to an early to mid 20th century occupancy of the site.
The vast majority of artifacts found in shovel testing came from Shovel Tests 1, 3, 4, and 5 which were all
excavated in areas within 10 meters of the cistern. All artifacts were recovered from the upper 40 cm of
soil deposits with those objects found at depths greater than 20 cm probably becoming incorporated into
the deeper deposits through years of plowing. For the most part, this buried material reflects what is seen
on the surface.
Archival deed/title research conducted in connection with site is described in Appendix 3. In summary,
this research showed that the property on which the site is located is a part of a larger tract that was
conveyed in 1881 to John Carlson, Peck Carlson, Gust Carlson, and C. J. Anderson by S. M. Swenson, a
prominent businessman who encouraged Swedish immigrants to settle in Central Texas after the Civil
War. The 80 acres containing site 41TV2384 went to Gust Carlson. Efforts to find specific information
on Gust Carlson were inconclusive due to the abundance of individuals with similar names that occur in
the records. However, all of these individuals were natives of Sweden. By 1926, Edward M. Carlson
sold the property to Albert T. Carlson. The familial relationships of these two Carlsons to Gust Carlson is
unknown, too. Albert in turn sold the property to the Thrall Gin Company in 1928, but the gin company
309

only held the property for two years before selling it to Oscar Forsdahl in 1930. Thus, it is probable that a
cotton gin was not ever built on the property. Forsdahl sold the land to Fritz August Schiller and his wife,
Hattie, in 1933. Mr. Schiller died in 1959 and his heirs sold the property to Edwin and Anna Magnuson
in 1976. The Magnuson kept the property until recently.
Attempts were made to contact former landowners and their descendents to learn more about the site.
Boyd Magnuson, the nephew of Edwin and Anna Magnuson, was interviewed on November 4, 2010. He
remembered the underground cistern on the property and stated that the single remaining site structure
that shows on the 1970 aerial map in the Travis County Soil Survey was a barn. He also said that
previous owners, Mr. and Mrs. Schiller and their daughter were all deceased. We also learned from Mr.
Magnuson, that Mr. Carl Carlson, who lives near the project area is probably related to the Carlson family
that previously owned the property. Repeated telephone calls to Mr. Carlson were not answered, and he
apparently does not have a messaging machine on his phone.
Recommendations
As a result of pedestrian survey and shovel testing for the LCRA’s proposed Kimbro Substation Project,
one new cultural resource site, 41TV2384, was recorded and assessed. Site 41TV2384 is an historic
farmstead site that was originally settled in the very late nineteenth century or early twentieth century.
Although no house or other outbuildings are still standing, the underground portion of a brick-lined
cistern is still present in the northern part of the site. Artifacts observed on ground surface and recovered
during shovel testing at the site date from the very late nineteenth century through the mid twentieth
century and are generally nondescript and lacking in diversity. Through these years the land was
probably used chiefly for the production of row crops such as cotton and corn.
During the time that the field survey was being undertaken, the LCRA decided to shift the substation tract
northwestward so that the cistern cavity would not conflict with the desired construction area. The
western one-quarter of the artifact scatter associated with site 41TV2384 is within the redefined
substation boundaries. The cistern lies about three meters east of the east boundary of the redesigned
substation tract. Site 41TV2384 is considered to have been fully documented during the survey, and it is
assessed as not meriting formal designation as a State Archeological Landmark. It is recommended that
construction of the electrical substation and associated access road be allowed to proceed without any
further cultural resource investigations.
As always, standard emergency discovery provisions are applicable. Should the personnel conducting the
work uncover any presently unknown buried archaeological materials during construction, then work
should cease in the immediate area of the discovery and the LCRA Archaeology Services staff should be
contacted at 1-800-776-5272 ext. 6714 so that the find can be reported to the Texas Historical Commission
and a determination can be made as to whether any avoidance/mitigation measures are needed.

Appendix 3
Historic Archival Deed/Title Research

41TV2384: CARLSON-SCHILLER FARMSTEAD
The artifacts and features noted at 41TV2384 are historically consistent with the land ownership of two
families that covered much of the period from the late nineteenth century to the late twentieth century.
The 78.13-acre tract is located within the Robert Fletcher Headright Survey of 320 acres patented to
Fletcher’s assignee, S.M. Swenson, in 1855 by the State of Texas. The patent was not formally recorded
until 1875, and in 1881, S.M. Swenson, a resident of Brooklyn, New York, acting through his attorney,
conveyed the entire headright to John Carlson, Peck Carlson, Gust Carlson, and C.J. Anderson. (Travis
County Deed Records: 50/612 and 51/113)

Swante Magnus Swenson was a pivotal figure in the immigration and commercial history of Texas. Born
in Sweden in 1816, he emigrated to the U.S. in 1836, making his way to the Republic of Texas two years
later. Successful as a planter in the eastern part of the state, he moved to Austin by 1850 to join with his
uncle, Swante Palm, in the development of a mercantile business. Together, the two men also worked to
encourage further Swedish settlement to Texas. Swenson’s continued success in business led him to
expand into other operations, including land speculation, and at one time he was one of the largest
landowners in the state. During the Civil War he was a staunch Unionist, despite his prior experience as a
slave owner, and his unwillingness to help the Southern cause made him highly unpopular. He eventually
fled to Mexico fearing for his life. Soon after the Civil War, though, he moved to Brooklyn, but retained
many of his business connections with Texas, including land sales. (Tyler, 1996: 6/176)
The 1881 sale of the Fletcher Headright to the Carlsons and Anderson marked the beginning of a
dispersed agricultural community that came to be known as Carlson. In November of that year, the four
men partitioned the headright, with each receiving 80 acres. Tract number one, which went to Gust
Carlson, included the current target site. Efforts to find specific information on Gust Carlson through
census records proved inconclusive, though, due to the abundance of individuals with similar names
(Gust, Gustaf, August, Augustus, Gus, etc.). All individuals located in close proximity to the target area
were natives of Sweden, and the assumption is that the Gust Carlson in question was as well. What is
known for certain is that the land (actually 78.13 acres) remained in the ownership of family members
into the twentieth century. In 1926, Edward M. Carlson sold to Albert T. Carlson, and in March 1928,
Albert and his wife sold the land to the Thrall Gin Company. The exact relationship of Edward and Albert
Carlson to Gust Carlson could not be determined. (Travis County Deed Records: 51/113 and 446/312)
Headquartered in the Williamson County town of Thrall, east of Taylor, the company owned considerable
land for cotton production, as well as several gins. It is unlikely it operated a gin on the Carlson land,
however, since it sold out to Oscar Forsdahl less than two years later. Additionally, it is known that John
Carlson operated the Carlson Gin on his portion of the land, three tracts north of the target property.
Forsdahl, also of Sweden, was a large landowner in the area, and in 1933 he deeded the property to Fritz
Schiller of Bastrop County. Born in Germany in 1883, Fritz August Schiller listed himself in census
records as a farmer, and the 1930 census showed him living in Elgin with his wife and daughter, both
named Hattie. He died in 1959, but his heirs retained ownership until selling to Edwin S. and Anna
Magnuson in 1976. The Magnusons kept the property until selling in 1995. (Travis County Deed Records:
446/312, 497/312, and 12349/2127; Tyler, 1996: 1/979; Texas Death Records; U.S. Draft Registration
Records, 1918; and 1930 U.S. Census)

317

Historical records indicate the Carlson family lived on the target property, and artifacts dating to the late
nineteenth century represent that period of occupation. It appears the land has historically remained in
agricultural use, although later owners may have lived elsewhere. Extensive terracing of the land probably
dates from the 1930s or 1940s and may reflect investments by the Schiller family. A 1951 aerial photo of
the property shows a number of structures clustered together, as would be expected of a family farm site
that would include a house, barn, and associated outbuildings. (1951 aerial photo)
Site 41TV2384 represents remains of an agricultural-use property dating from 1881 to the present, with
principal owners being members of the Carlson and Schiller families. Key artifacts on the site—the house
and other structures—are no longer extant and were removed at some time after the 1950s. Archival
research and archeological investigations conducted in association with this report are considered
sufficient for assessment, with the final determination being that the site is not eligible for formal
designation as a State Archeological Landmark. No further work is recommended.

Part 2. Negative Surveys less than 2 Acres in Size, Transmission Line Maintenance Projects, and Projects
Cleared through File Searches
This section contains the texts of the results of 43 cultural resource assessments that were cleared
internally through memos from LCRA Archaeology Services to project managers. Twenty-two of these
projects included on-the-ground assessments. Five of these were transmission line maintenance or
enhancement projects and resulted in to recording of 14 new archaeological sites. The rest were less than
5 acres in size and no archaeological sites were present.
Twenty of these projects involved file searches. Most were for transmission line maintenance projects
and consisted of reviewing previously recorded sites and/or identifying high probability areas where
ground disturbance minimization was recommended. A minimal number of others were in areas that had
been previously investigated and either had no sites present or the sites had been previously determined
ineligible for SAL listing.
Additionally, transmission line project 8.10 in Crane, Crockett, Pecos, Terrell, Upton, and Tom Green
counties involved adding vibration dampeners using helicopters, ensuring the avoidance of the areas
described in the memo.

Type of Investigation:

File search

Date of Investigation:

January 2010

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Archaeology Services staff has completed a cultural
resources desktop review for the proposed FY10 maintenance work on Transmission Line T-544. This
transmission line extends from the Glidden Substation to the Columbus Substation to the Staford Hill
Substation to the Altair Substation in Colorado County, Texas.
A file search showed that there are no previously recorded cultural resource sites within the T-544 rightof-way (ROW). The file search also indicated that the T-544 transmission line corridor has not previously
been field surveyed for cultural resource sites. There are several areas that may contain unrecorded
archaeological sites that could be impacted by maintenance work. In particular, unrecorded
archaeological sites located adjacent to stream channels could be adversely affected by subsurface
disturbances caused by tree/brush clearing activities and by alteration of terrace stream banks for
construction of low water creek crossings. Review of topographic maps suggests that unrecorded
archaeological sites that might be affected by such activities could be present along stream channels
within the following areas:

Columbus Substation to Staford Hill Section:
1. From 200 feet southeast of STR #11 to 250 feet northwest of STR #13.
Staford Hill Substation to Altair Substation Section:
1. From 100 feet southeast of STR #51 to 150 feet northwest of STR #53,
2. From 300 feet northwest of STR #67 to 50 feet northwest of STR #69,
3. From 50 feet northwest of STR #89 to the location of STR #90.
The four high probability areas listed above are locations where ground disturbance should be minimized.
In particular, there should be no modifications of existing creek banks, and any vegetation clearing
(especially tree removal) should be done without root disturbance (i.e. no bulldozing). If such areas
cannot be avoided, Archaeology Services should be contacted at ext. 6714 two weeks prior to the
proposed disturbance so that a field assessment can be conducted. If the assessment indicates that
potentially significant archaeological sites are present, then additional test excavations and/or mitigation
may be necessary prior to the disturbance.
Aside from the special conditions for the four areas listed above, the proposed maintenance work on the
T-538 line may proceed. However, standard emergency discovery provisions are always applicable.
Should the personnel conducting the work uncover any presently unknown buried archaeological
materials during construction, then work should cease in the immediate area of the discovery and the
LCRA Archaeology Services staff should be contacted at ext. 6714 or 2753 so that the find can be
reported to the Texas Historical Commission and a determination can be made as to whether any
avoidance/mitigation measures are needed.

T-265 Colorado to Nada Switch Maintenance

Colorado

Type of Investigation:

File Search

Date of Investigation:

January 2010

The LCRA’s Transmission Services Corporation is planning maintenance on their T-265 Transmission
Line between the Colorado Substation and the Nada Switch Structure in Colorado County. The T-265
ROW was surveyed for cultural resources by Espey, Huston & Associates (EH&A) in 1991 prior to
construction of the transmission line. The survey resulted in the recording one archeological site,
41CD125, located on a low rise 180 meters east of Middle Sandy Creek.
Site 41CD125 contains buried chipping debris in moderate amounts down to a depth of 60cm. In the
opinion of the EH&A archeologists, 41CD125 was not adequately documented by their survey-level
investigation and as a precaution they recommended avoidance during the construction of the
transmission line. If avoidance was not possible, then further testing and geomorphological investigation
would be needed to determine the site’s significance.
For the upcoming maintenance project, we were concerned that the buried cultural deposits at 41CD125
might extend westwards to the banks of Middle Sandy Creek beyond the area shovel tested by EH&A.
After a careful review of the EH&A report, we learned that shovel testing was done in the area of concern
resulting in no recovery of artifacts. Therefore, 41CD125 appears to be confined to the rise where EH&A
archeologists recorded it.
During the upcoming maintenance project, we recommend that the 41CD125 site area be avoided by
vehicles and that all clearing be done by hand. The area of concern lies in the north half of the ROW
beginning at Structure 3/14 and running eastwards for a distance of 130 feet. Elsewhere in the T-265
ROW, if any unexpected archeological material is encountered, please cease operations at the find site
and contact Archeological Services so an evaluation can be made

Date of Investigation:

January 2010

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Archaeology Services staff has completed a cultural
resources desktop review for the proposed FY10 maintenance work on Transmission Line T-546. This
transmission line extends for a length of about 8.74 miles beginning at the Altair Substation and
continuing down various line routes through the Garwood Relift Tap (LCRA), the Ideal Tap (LCRA), the
Ideal Cement Tap, the Garwood Relift, and Garwood Pump, the TXI Tap, the Ideal Cement (LCRA), and
the TXI (LCRA) in Colorado County, Texas.
A file search showed that there are no previously recorded cultural resource sites within the T-546 rightof-way (ROW). The file search also indicated that the T-546 transmission line corridor has not previously
been field surveyed for cultural resource sites. There are several areas that may contain unrecorded
archaeological sites that could be impacted by maintenance work. In particular, unrecorded
archaeological sites located adjacent to stream channels could be adversely affected by subsurface
disturbances caused by tree/brush clearing activities and by alteration of terrace stream banks for
construction of low water creek crossings. Review of topographic maps suggests that unrecorded
archaeological sites that might be affected by such activities could be present along stream channels
within the following three areas south of the Altair Substation:
1, From 100 feet southeast of STR #47 to 250 feet southeast of STR #46,
2. From the location of STR #36 to 150 feet southeast of STR #35, and
3. From 50 feet northwest of STR #32 to the location of STR #31.
The three high probability areas listed above are locations where ground disturbance should be
minimized. In particular, there should be no modifications of existing creek banks, and any vegetation
clearing (especially tree removal) should be done without root disturbance (i.e. no bulldozing). If such
areas cannot be avoided, Archaeology Services should be contacted at ext. 6714 two weeks prior to the
proposed disturbance so that a field assessment can be conducted. If the assessment indicates that

Date of Investigation:

January 2010

LCRA proposes to modify existing structures on select transmission lines through the addition of
vibration dampers. A cultural resource assessment has been completed for the following lines:
T438, T449, T449, T449, T449, T446, T446, T444, T429, T429, T443, T454/T484, T456, T451, T451,
T455 , T455 , T452, T470, T470, T470.
Avoidance areas (described below) are present on T-446, T-444, T-443, T-455/452, and T-470.
Otherwise, the project may proceed without additional input from Archaeology Services, although
clarification on any recommendation is always available.
As with all projects, there is a standard emergency discovery clause. If previously unknown buried
archaeological materials are discovered during project-related activities then such activities should cease
in the immediate area of the discovery until Archaeology Services staff can be contacted and possible
investigations evaluated.
The projects below are ordered by construction start date.
T-438
T-438 was reviewed by Archaeology Services in a memo to Liz Duron dated September 23, 2009. There
are numerous avoidance areas on this project. Please contact Archaeology Services if additional guidance
is needed.
T-449
T-499, Mesa View to Rio Pecos, was surveyed by PBS&J in 2003 (PBS&J Document No. 020395).
PBS&J focused on high probability areas. One archaeological site, an isolated prehistoric hearth, was
recorded as 41PC67. The site was considered too badly disturbed and lacking any buried materials to
make it eligible for formal listing as a State Archeological Landmark. There were no recommendations
for any avoidance or any other other additional cultural resource investigations at the site or the remainder
of the line.
As a result, LCRA Archaeology Services has no recommendations for the damper addition project, which
may proceed without additional input from Archaeology Services staff.

T-446 was reviewed by Archaeology Services in a memo to Liz Duron dated September 23, 2009. There
is one avoidance area at STR 63, where it is recommended that all traffic remain in the ROW between the
small drainage just south of STR 63 northwards for a distance of 500 feet. Please contact Archaeology
Services if additional guidance is needed.
T-444
T-444, Fort Lancaster to Mesa View Switchyard, was surveyed by PBS&J in 2003 (PBS&J Document
020395). As a result of their investigations, which focused on high probability areas, six archaeological
326

sites, 41PC30, 41PC117, 41PC570, 41PC571, 41PC572, and 41CX912 were recorded and/or reassessed.
Of these six sites, one, 41PC572, was was recommended for avoidance and/or testing. This site had
burned rock features and artifacts indicating occupation up to 3,500 years ago. During construction it was
determined that a transmission structure, STR161, needed t be placed within the northwestern edge of the
site’s boundaries. In a letter from PBS&JJ to the Texas Historical Commission dated July 13, 2003,
results of additional shovel tests at the proposed structure location were described. These tests found very
little cultural material and no evidence of buried features. THS allowed placement of STR 161 within the
boundaries of the site. Avoidance recommendations remained the same for the remainder of the site.
For the present damper project, it is recommended that any vehicular traffic remain on existing pathways
between STR 161 and the stream crossing located 500 ft to the southeast. Aerial imagery suggests there
is an improved crossing on this stream. This crossing can be used without modification to the stream
banks. If stream bank modification or extensive movement of machinery within the ROW between
STR161 and the stream becomes necessary, then LCRA Archaeology Services should be contacted so any
additional cultural resource investigations can be coordinated prior to ground disturbance. Elsewhere the
project may proceed without additional input from Archaeology Services.
T-429
T-429, from Twin Buttes to San Angelo, was surveyed by PBS&J in 2003 (PBS&J Document 030346,
030292). PBS&J surveyed select high probability, and recorded one archaeological site, 41TG577,
described as a sparse lithic scatter within the access road to the the Twin Buttes substation. No cultural
resource sites were within the transmission line ROW, and there were no recommendations for avoidance
or further work at any areas. .
As a result, LCRA Archaeology Services has no recommendations for the damper addition project, which
may proceed without additional input from Archaeology Services staff.
T-443 (bolt measuring project)
T-443, North McCamey to West Yates, including T-552 to the new Tippet substation, was most recently
assessed by LCRA Archaeology Services Staff in 2009 prior to a planned rebuild. The line was originally
surveyed by LCRA Archaeology Services in 2002. At present there are six prehistoric archaeological
sites recorded along the line. There is one avoidance area within the ROW. From the Pecos River
northwards for a distance of 250 feet there should be no ground disturbance. This area contains no
structures, and is the terrace below (south of) STR 131. As long as this area can be avoided and there is
no disturbance outside the existing ROW on the south side of the Pecos River, than Archaeology Services
has no concerns with the proposed bolt measurement project. If unexpected impacts become imminent,
please contact Archaeology Services for guidance.
T-454/484
T-454/484 was reviewed by Archaeology Services in a memo to Liz Duron dated September 23, 2009.
There are no avoidance areas on this line. Please contact Archaeology Services if additional guidance is
needed.
T-456
T-456, from the North McCamey Switchyard to Southwest Mesa Switch, was surveyed by PBS&J in
2003 (PBS&J Document No. 030118). PBS&J surveyed select high probability areas and found no
archaeological sites. There were no recommendations for any further work or avoidance.
As a result, LCRA Archaeology Services has no recommendations for the damper addition project, which
may proceed without additional input from Archaeology Services staff.

327

T-451
T-451 was reviewed by Archaeology Services in a memo to Liz Duron dated September 23, 2009. There
are no avoidance areas on this project. Please contact Archaeology Services if additional guidance is
needed.
T-455/452
T-455 and T-452 are double-circuited between Rio Pecos and North McCamey. The line was surveyed
by PBS&J in 2002 PBS&J Document 020253). According to a figure included with PBS&J’s document
is a project area map that indicates survey may have stopped short of the Crane substation instead of
ending at the McElroy Tap (which does not appear to exist any longer). It is clear, however, that 1.6
miles between the end of their survey and the Crane substation would have been within a low probability
that PBS&J would not have surveyed.
On archaeological site was recorded as a result of their investigations. Site 41UT41 is a small camp
within a rock overhang that contains red monochrome pictographs, a mortar hole, and buried camping
debris. It is located along the ridge overlooking a small stream immediately north of STR 191. This is
shown as the next structure north of STR 189 (i.e., there does not appear to be a STR 190).
Site 41UT41 is potentially a very important site and is considered eligible for formal placement on the
National Register of Historic Places and listing as a State Archeological Landmark. For the purposes of
this and any future projects, a 50 foot avoidance radius should be enforced north of the structure. Under
no circumstances should equipment or personnel be allowed past the limestone ledge that overlooks the
creek. If such avoidance is not possible, then testing and/or site mitigation may be necessary. There are
no cultural resource restrictions for the reminder of the project.
T-470
T-470, from Abilene to Eskota, was assessed for standard maintenance-related impacts to cultural
resources by LCRA Archaeology Services staff in 2009. In a memo from Program Manager Dan Prikryl
to Environmental Coordinator Jennifer Leeper dated September 14, 2009, a set of recommendations was
made. These recommendations are still valid for the present project.
Although there are seven archaeological sites along the line, only one, 41TA1, requires any type of
avoidance. Site 41TA1 was recorded first in 1930s when mammoth bones and stone tools were found in
close association, indicating a 10,000 year-old-plus camp site. Backhoe trenching and monitoring of new
structures in 2003 by PBS&J (PBS&J Document 020391) failed to find evidence of this site, however
there may still be portions of the site intact elsewhere. It is therefore recommended that there be no
ground disturbance between Antilley Road (just northwest of STR 28) and STR 30. In particular, care
should be taken to avoid activities that might increase stream bank erosion. If avoidance is not possible in
this area, then additional investigations will need to be considered.
Note: this entire project was done by helicopter.

Project 10.10 Equipment Laydown Area on Hwy. 290 West of Manor, LCRA Clear Springs to Hutto
Transmission Line Project
(Figure 151)

County(s):

Travis

Type of Investigation:

Field survey

Date of Investigation:

February 2010

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Archaeology Services staff has completed a cultural
resource assessment for the proposed equipment laydown area located immediately south of U. S. Hwy.
290 west of Manor, Texas (Figure 1). The laydown area will be utilized of the upcoming LCRA Clear
Springs to Hutto Transmission Line Project. The property to be leased for the laydown area consists of
about 6.42 acres.
A file search showed that there are no previously recorded archaeological sites within the equipment
laydown area. The file search also indicated that an approximately 50 meter wide strip immediately south
and parallel to U. S. Hwy. 290 had been previously surveyed for cultural resources. That survey was
conducted for a proposed widening of U.S. Hwy. 290 which has not yet occurred. No cultural resource
sites were recorded in the project area during that survey.
A cultural resource field survey of the portion of the tract not previously surveyed for cultural resources
was undertaken by the LCRA Archaeology Services staff on February 15, 2010. The field crew found
that the northwestern 4.8 acres is covered by an 8- to 10-ft thick layer of earthen fill that is capped by road
base gravel. The remaining 1.9 acres consists of waterlogged terrain immediately adjacent to an unnamed
tributary creek that flows into Walter E. Long Lake. About 0.35 acres of that marshy area had been
covered by the TxDOT survey.
The crew attempted to look along the edges of the area covered by fill but they could not find any natural
ground surface exposures. The crew then walked the area between the fill and the creek. The ground was
very waterlogged from recent rains. No cultural materials were seen on ground surface in this area. No
shovel testing could be attempted because of the waterlogged nature of the soil deposits.
Real Estate staff has stated that the marshy area will not be used for storage of equipment.
Elsewhere, it does not appear that any cultural resource sites will be affected by the proposed equipment
laydown activities because of the thick fill material. Since the marshy area actually field surveyed was
less than 2 acres, a report does not have to be sent to the Texas Historical Commission at this time.
Instead, the proposed use of the tract for equipment laydown activities may immediately proceed and staff
will report the results of this negative field survey in the 2010 LCRA Annual Report of Cultural Resource
Investigations next year.

(Figure 152)

County(s):

Colorado, Wharton

Type of Investigation:

File search

Date of Investigation:

March 2010

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Archaeology Services staff has completed a cultural
resources desktop review for the proposed FY10 maintenance work on Transmission Line T-545. This
transmission line extends for a distance of about 31.65 miles from the El Campo Substation to the LCRA
Altair Substation in Wharton and Colorado counties, Texas.
A file search showed that there are no previously recorded cultural resource sites within the transmission
line right-of-way (ROW). The file search also indicated that no portions of the transmission line ROW
have ever been surveyed for cultural resource sites by professional archaeologists.
A review of topographic maps suggests that are several areas of concern where unrecorded archaeological
sites could be impacted by maintenance work. In particular, there should be no modifications to existing
creek banks, and any vegetation clearing (especially tree removal) should be done without root
disturbance (i. e. no bulldozing). These sensitive areas around stream crossings consist of the following
areas:
1. Palacios Creek – From the State Hwy. 71 crossing of the transmission line eastward to the FM
653 (Wharton Street) crossing of the transmission line;
2. Blue Creek – From the location of STR #2/20 northward to the location of STR 3/4
3. East Mustang Creek – From the location of STR 7/3 northwestward to the FM 2546 crossing of
the transmission line;
4. Unnamed creek south of Garwood – From 250 feet northwest of STR 21/7 northwestward to the
location of STR 22/2;
5. Marys Branch – From the location of STR 27/6 northeastward to the location of STR 28/1;
6. Skull Creek and adjacent tributary – from 500 feet southeast of STR 30/6 to 400 feet northwest of
STR 31/2;
7. Dry Branch – From 100 feet southeast of STR 32/2 to 200 feet northwest of STR 32/4.
If ground disturbing activities within these areas cannot be avoided, Archaeology Services should be
contacted at ext. 6714 two weeks prior to the proposed disturbance so that a field assessment can be
conducted. If the assessment indicates that potentially significant archaeological sites are present, then
additional testing and/or mitigation may be necessary prior to disturbance.
Aside from the special conditions relating to the seven areas described above, the proposed maintenance
work on the T-545 line may proceed. However, standard emergency discovery provisions are always
applicable. Should the personnel conducting the work uncover any presently unknown buried
archaeological materials during construction, then work should cease in the immediate area of the
discovery and the LCRA Archaeology Services staff should be contacted at 1-800-776-5272 ext. 6714 or
2753 so that the find can be reported to the Texas Historical Commission and a determination can be
made as to whether any avoidance/mitigation measures are needed.

(Figure 153)

County(s):

Fayette

Type of Investigation:

File search

Date of Investigation:

March 2010

Portions of the Plum Tract were investigated in 1999. One archaeological site, 41FY531, was recorded
near the entry at that time. Other sections of the property, particularly nearer the river, were not
fully investigated, and unknown archaeological sites may be present.
The location proposed for the camp host site was surveyed in 1999, and no archaeology sites were
documented at that location. Because the project area is smaller than 2 acres in size and no sites are
known to be present, the project may proceed without the standard 30-day review by the Texas
Historical Commission (THC). Other future projects at the Plum Park may require field investigations
and/or review by the THC.
Also, please be aware that if unexpected archaeological materials are discovered during ground
disturbing activities, then those activities should stop until Archaeology Services staff can be contacted
and the find evaluated.

Type of Investigation:

Field survey

Date of Investigation:

March 2009

The LCRA is decommissioning the South Road Water Plant located near Marble Falls in Burnet County.
This will involve the demolishing of all buildings, fences, and equipment, leaving only a bare lot. In
addition, a new buried water pipeline will be installed along the western boundary of the lot running from
Calle Uno Street on the north to Calle Dos Street on the south. The total length of this pipeline will be
140 feet.
LCRA Archeology Services visited the work site on March 12, 2010 to spot monitor the trench for the
new pipeline, which could impact any unrecorded archeological sites in its path. At the time,
approximately 80 linear feet of north end of the trench had already been dug with the water pipe laid but
not refilled. About 12 to 18 inches of soil was exposed over fractured limestone bedrock. The walls of
the trench were inspected for cultural material and none was seen. No artifacts were seen on the ground
between the south end of the trench and Calle Dos. Visibility was good there because of the lack of
vegetation and rutting caused by heavy machinery.
No archeological sites appear to be in the project area.

(Figure 155)

County(s):

Wharton, Colorado

Type of Investigation:

File Search

Date of Investigation:

March 2010

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Archaeology Services staff has completed a cultural
resources desktop review for the proposed FY10 maintenance work on Transmission Line T-548. This
transmission line extends for a distance of about 37.8 miles from the El Campo Substation to the Eagle
Lake Substation in Wharton and Colorado counties, Texas. Along this route, the transmission line passes
by the Garwood, Lone Star Cement Tap, Lonestar Tap, Lone Star, Matthews, and Lakeside Pump
Substations.
A file search showed that there are no previously recorded cultural resource sites within the transmission
line right-of-way (ROW). The file search also indicated that no portions of the transmission line ROW
have ever been surveyed for cultural resource sites by professional archaeologists.
According the LCRA’s computerized Tesla Light maps, the transmission line corridor is situated
immediately east of the historic Lakeside Cemetery, which is located about 0.9 miles south of Eagle Lake,
Texas. Because unmarked graves are sometimes located outside the fenced boundaries of early
cemeteries, it is recommended that care be taken during maintenance work adjacent to the cemetery fence
in the area between transmission structures G through I. Specifically, to ensure that there will be no
disturbance to subsurface soil deposits, no bulldozing should be allowed in that area. Instead, the use of a
sepii and/or hand clearing of vegetation in this area is advised.
A review of topographic maps suggests that are also a number of areas of concern adjacent to stream
channels where unrecorded archaeological sites could be impacted by maintenance work. In particular,
there should be no modifications to existing creek banks, and any vegetation clearing at stream crossings
(especially tree removal) should be done without root disturbance (i. e. no bulldozing). Beginning at the
south end of the project area and continuing northward, these sensitive areas around stream crossings
consist of the following areas:
8. 1st crossing of Tres Palacios Creek – From the location of STR 2/1 northwestward to the location
of STR 2/5;
9. 2nd crossing of Tres Palacios Creek – From the location of STR 2/18 northwestward to 180 feet
northwest of STR 2/21;
10. East Mustang Creek – From the location of STR 59 northwestward to the location of STR 64;
11. 1st crossing of West Mustang Creek – From 120 feet southeast of STR 95 northwestward to the
location of STR 99;
12. Two unnamed tributaries of Porters Creek – From 100 feet southeast of STR 153 northwestward
to 60 feet southeast of STR 158 and from the location of STR 159 northwestward to 120 feet
southeast of STR 164;
339

13. Porters Creek – From the location of STR 391 northwestward to 120 feet south of STR 386;
14. 2nd crossing of West Mustang Creek – From the location of STR 269 northward to 100 feet south
of STR 264;
15. Unnamed tributary creek near transmission line crossing of State Hwy 71 – From 100 feet north
of STR 210 northward to 200 feet north of STR 205;
16. Unnamed tributary creek south of Garwood, Tx. – From 100 feet south of STR 192 northward to
200 feet north of STR 188;

17. Unnamed tributary creek north of Colorado River – From 200 feet northeast of STR 174
northeastward to the location of STR 169;
18. Unnamed tributary creek west of Eldridge, Tx. – From the location of STR 147 northeastward to
the location of STR 142.
If ground disturbing activities within these areas cannot be avoided, Archaeology Services should be
contacted at ext. 6714 two weeks prior to the proposed disturbance so that a field assessment can be
conducted. If the assessment indicates that potentially significant archaeological sites are present, then
additional testing and/or mitigation may be necessary prior to disturbance.

Date of Investigation:

March 2010

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Archaeology Services staff has completed a cultural
resources desktop review for the proposed FY10 maintenance work on Transmission Line T-547. This
transmission line extends for a distance of about 9.73 miles from the Altair Substation to the Eagle Lake
Substation in Colorado County, Texas. Along this route, there are several side extensions arms that are
included as part of T-547. It should also be noted that the transmission line also extends through areas
that connect to the Riverside Tap, Riverside, Prairie Pump Tap, Prairie Pump, Parker Tap, Parker, and the
Parker Pump Tap Substations.
A file search showed that there are no previously recorded cultural resource sites within the transmission
line right-of-way (ROW). The file search also indicated that no portions of the transmission line ROW
have ever been surveyed for cultural resource sites by professional archaeologists.
A review of topographic maps suggests that are several areas of concern adjacent to stream channels
where unrecorded archaeological sites could be impacted by maintenance work. In particular, there
should be no modifications to existing creek banks, and any vegetation clearing at stream crossings
(especially tree removal) should be done without root disturbance (i. e. no bulldozing). Beginning at the
west end of the project area and continuing generally eastward, these sensitive areas around stream
crossings consist of the following areas:
1. Unnamed tributary creek north of gravel pit complex – From 200 feet east of STR 132 eastward
to 100 feet east of STR 135;
2. Unnamed tributary creek west of McCreary Creek – From the location of STR 147 eastward to
200 feet east of STR 151; and
3. Unnamed tributary creek at north end of the Eagle Lake water feature – From the location of STR
157 eastward to 200 feet west of STR 161.
If ground disturbing activities within these areas cannot be avoided, Archaeology Services should be
contacted at ext. 6714 two weeks prior to the proposed disturbance so that a field assessment can be
conducted. If the assessment indicates that potentially significant archaeological sites are present, then
additional testing and/or mitigation may be necessary prior to disturbance.
Aside from the special conditions relating to the three areas described above, the proposed maintenance
work on the T-547 line may proceed. However, standard emergency discovery provisions are always
applicable. Should the personnel conducting the work uncover any presently unknown buried
archaeological materials during construction, then work should cease in the immediate area of the
discovery and the LCRA Archaeology Services staff should be contacted at 1-800-776-5272 ext. 6714 or

Project 21.10 Hutto Laydown Area
(Figure 157)
County(s):

Williamson

Type of Investigation:

Field survey

Date of Investigation:

March 2010

The LCRA’s Archeology Services conducted a cultural resource survey of the proposed equipment
laydown yard located ¼ mile east of Hutto in Williamson County. The project area covers slightly less
than two acres within a triangular piece of land bordered by Highway 79 on the south and County Road
136 on the north and east (Figure 1). A file search showed that no archeological sites have been recorded
in the project area. The geology of the area suggests that any archeological material will be found on or
near the ground surface.
The property tract, which was staked at three corners, was found to be level and nearly devoid of trees
and other woody vegetation. The ground was covered by a thick carpet of grass and forbs except along
the south edge of the project area which was covered by a gravel pavement left by a former business. The
entire project area was walked over and bare spots where the ground was visible were inspected for
cultural material. None was seen other a few pieces of modern trash.
Because of the poor ground visibility, five shovel tests were dug in different areas within the proposed
laydown yard to check for buried cultural material (see Figure 1). Four of the five tests encountered a
surface zone 15 to 22cm thick composed of packed gravels in a matrix of yellow sandy loam. This
appears to be artificial fill brought in to cap the black clay, the natural soil in the surrounding area. The
upper 20 to 25cm of the clay beneath the fill was screened for artifacts and none were recovered. A fifth
shovel test placed in the southwestern corner of the project area encountered an upper zone of brown
loam 22cm thick over black clay. No artifacts were found in the loam or in the upper 23cm of clay
beneath the loam. The loam, like the gravels encountered in the other shovel tests, appears to be material
brought to the site during previous construction activities.
Since the project covers less than two acres and contains no archeological sites, a report does not need to
be sent to the Texas Historical Commission for approval. The area can be used as an equipment laydown
yard without further archeological investigation.

Date of Investigation:

April 2010

The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) Transmission Services Corporation (TSC) is proposing to
add a capacitor bank at the Leakey Substation in Real County, Texas. The project involves 1) removing a
15.6 MVAR capacitor bank for the Bandera Substation (already completed), 2) adding a 15.6 MVAR
capacitor bank at the Leakey Substation, and 3) removing the 69 kV voltage regulator at the Leakey
Substation. All of the proposed work will occur within the previously disturbed grounds of the
substations.
A file search showed that the LCRA Archaeology Services staff conducted a cultural resource survey for
proposed construction within a westward expansion of the Leakey Substation in 2003. That work also
included investigation for rebuilding the first transmission structure north of the substation property. No
cultural resource sites were found during the survey, and based on that work it is doubtful that any
cultural resource sites every existed within or near the substation area. Given the results of the previous
survey and the previous disturbance, the currently proposed project at the Leakey Substation may proceed
without any further coordination on cultural resources.

(Figure 159, Figure 160)
County(s):

Burnet

Type of Investigation:

Field survey

Date of Investigation:

June 2010

LCRA is installing a trailer pad and utilities for a new camp host site to be located at the Double Horn
Resource area in Burnet County, Texas. The pad will consist of road base or the equivalent placed upon
the ground surface. It will be placed between an existing modern pole barn and a historic house at
41BT260. Electricity will be supplied from the pole barn, and a wastewater line will tie in to an existing
septic tank system, with each within a separate trench. The total length of trenches will be about 85 feet
in length. They will be excavated with a standard Ditch Witch and will be one to two feet in depth and
eight inches wide. Due to the small size of the project, it was determined monitoring of excavation
activities would be the most appropriate method of ensuring cultural resource compliance. Monitoring
was conducted on June 10, 2010, by LCRA Archaeology Services staff.
Trench 1 runs from the northeast corner of the pole barn southeasterly for a distance of 50 feet. It was
excavated to a depth of 24 inches (60 cm) through brown loam and light brown silty loam. There was no
evidence of a subsoil. One green glass fragment, one burned milk top glass fragment, two bone pieces
(deer or cow), one brown crockery fragment, and one piece of flat glass were seen, all from the
southernmost portion of the trench closest to the house at 41BT260.
Trench 2 runs from a point about 15 m south of the northeast corner of the pole barn directly east for a
distance of about 35 feet. It was excavated to a depth of 12 inches (30 cm) through light brown silty
loam. Three pieces of burned whiteware ceramics and one piece of thin clear glass were seen, again near
the east end of the trench closest to the historic house.
The monitoring of trench excavation at or near 41BT260 resulted in minimal artifact recovery, and adds
no appreciable information to what is already known about the site. The project was allowed to proceed
without additional cultural resource oversight.

Type of Investigation:

Field survey

Date of Investigation:

June 2010

LCRA Transmission Services Corporation (TSC) is planning standard maintenance and enhancement
activities on transmission lines T-223/224 and T-457 in the vicinity of Georgetown in Williamson
County, Texas. Activities may consist of mowing, shredding, tree trimming and removal, repair and
replacement of gates, and maintenance of existing transmission line structures. Because neither of the
two lines has been assessed in their entirety for cultural resource constraints, a cultural resources survey
of select high probability areas was conducted by LCA Archaeology Services staff on June 3, 2010. The
survey consisted of pedestrian survey with very limited soil probing, due to the general nature of the clay
soils in this area.
T-223/224
There are two archaeological sites previously recorded within or very near the T-223 ROW; sites
41WM430 and 41WM915. These were all described as lithic scatters or lithic procurement areas. Site
41WM430 was recorded during survey for the Gabriel substation. No evidence of this site could be seen
within the transmission line corridor. Site 41WM991 was a quarry for which no further work was
recommended. It is now covered by a new road and buildings. Neither of these sites was within high
probability areas.
There are no avoidance or impact minimization areas for T-223/224.
T-457
There are two previously recorded archaeological sites within or very near the ROW of T-457. Site
41WM130 was recorded in 1979 as a lithic scatter with burned rock. It is on a high bluff overlooking the
North Fork of the San Gabriel River from the south. This area has been highly developed within the past
few years, and a new rod runs parallel with the transmission line in this area. The ROW was examined
and some few chert artifacts and possible burned limestone were noted. Of interest was the presence of
three similarly formed steeply beveled unifaces, indicating a specific type of processing in this location.
However, there is no soil to speak of here and the area has been impacted by development. There is little
chance that additional information would be forthcoming.
Site 41WM915 is a lithic scatter located on Pecan Branch. One shovel probe was placed on the south
bank of the Creek where there was poor visibility. It indicated the gravelly soils were shallow and
disturbed by flooding and probably root plowing. Within the creek bed were several large flakes and
tested cobbles, including a series of large flakes that could be refitted. This was quite surprising in this
location, so either the creek does not flood at high velocity here or these are apparent artifacts created
recently. However, the sum of artifacts suggests they are genuine. Regardless, there is little scientific
value at this location, and no avoidance is necessary.
One previously unrecorded archaeological site was documented south of 41WM915 on Pecan Branch.
Site 41WM1254 was a light lithic scatter on either side of the creek. The south side of the creek was low
351

and swamy and had a proliferation of wild onions. On the north side there was a remnant bench of sandy
loam soil, much different than the surrounding Ferris clay vertisols. Materials included a core and a thick
biface and a few flakes of all classes. These materials had been derived from the gravels within the creek
bed, except, possibly, for a flake that was of tabular Georgetown chert, suggesting a manuport. Widely
scattered across the site, both within the pasture and a plowed field, were quantities of gray, somewhat
angular limestone. It is unknown whether these are of aboriginal or modern origin. There is no need for
avoidance at this site for the present project; however, future more intensive projects such as a rebuild
should consider revisiting this site and conducting limited testing, especially within the pocket of sandy
loam soil.
For the present project, there are no avoidance or impact minimization areas for T-457.

Type of Investigation:

Date of Investigation:

June 2010

This memo covers enhancements (maintenance) on transmission lines T-140 (Hallettsville to Yoakum)
and T-373 (Schulenburg to Glidden). Both lines are scheduled for enhancements to begin on July 5,
2010. Neither of these lines has had past field assessments for cultural resources. As of the date of this
memo, notification letters to landowners have not been sent. As a result, it will be impossible to conduct
planned field cultural resource assessments (CRAs) prior to the scheduled start of enhancement activities.
Therefore, desktop reviews of these two lines have been performed that identify areas considered to be of
high probability for containing cultural resources that may be eligible or formal listing as State
Archeological Landmarks (SALs). These are primarily areas where the line crosses stream channels, but
also includes locations where historic homesites are present or may have once been present. The high
probability areas (HPAs) have been marked both digitally in an Archeology Services GIS and on
hardcopies of topographic maps, and have been transcribed into spreadsheet form for use by the
Transmission Services environmental department. One spreadsheet is attached for each line. High
probability areas are identified by the nearest structure to one end of the HPA followed by a distance in
feet and a direction (bearing) from that structure and then a distance and bearing to the other end of the
HPA. In some intances the HPA begins at a structure, in which case the distance is "0" and the bearing is
"At." In some cases also, a HPA contains more than one structure. This is recorded in the column
labeled "Notes."
The recommendations for HPAs are as follows:
Avoid excessive ground disturbance;
Avoid travelling with heavy machinery when the ground is wet;
Avoid mechanical removal of tree root systems;
Avoid modifying stream banks at crossing locations; and,
Whenever possible, use existing paths for travel down the ROW
If ground disturbance becomes necessary, in particular the bulldozing of trees or the modification of
stream banks, please notify Archeology Services at ext. 6714 one week prior to such disturbances so that
a field visit can be arranged, if necessary.
Archaeology Services may also conduct field investigations during the enhancement activities, which
may result in the modification of recommendations for some HPAs.

Project 30.10 T-375 Enhancements
(Figure 164)
County(s):

Hays

Type of Investigation:

File search

Date of Investigation:

June 2010

LCRA proposes to conduct enhancements on transmission line T-375, from the Hilltop to McCarty lane
substations in Hays County, Texas. Activities will include standard maintenance to ensure the ROW and
transmission line remains reliable.
A cultural resources assessment of this line was conducted by LCRA Cultural resources staff in 2001.
The work consisted of a files and map review.
It was determined that the portion of the line from the Hilltop Substation to RR 12 had been previously
surveyed, and that eight previously unrecorded archaeological sites had been documented. None of the
sites were considered to be eligible for formal lists or registers, and no avoidance measures were
necessary.
Based on these findings, the map review indicated that the remainder of the line, from RR 12 to the
McCarty Lane Substation, was of low probability for containing intact archaeological deposits. A letter
was submitted to the Texas Historical Commission (THC) requesting concurrence with recommendations
that no survey was needed for the entirety of the line. The THC concurred on December, 17, 2001.
As a result of the previous file and map review, along with correspondence with THC, there is no need for
additional investigations for the T375 enhancement project, nor are there any areas requiring avoidance or
impact minimization.

Type of Investigation:

Date of Investigation:

July 2010

This memo covers enhancements (maintenance) on transmission lines T-355 (Chief Brady to Rivery) and
T-378 (Round Rock to Chief Brady), which total about 9.3 miles in length. Both lines are scheduled for
enhancements to begin in July 5, 2010. Neither of these lines has had past field assessments for cultural
resources. File and map review indicated there were several areas of high to moderate probability for
containing cultural resources on each line, for a total of approximately two miles of high probability. . A
cultural resources survey was conducted by LCRA Cultural Resources staff on July 6, 2010. Three
archaeological sites, 41WM1256, 41WM1257 and 41WM1258 were recorded. All three sites are on T355. In addition, there is an area along T-378 that was no fully investigated, and it is recommended that
there be no bulldozer or similar heavy equipment movement in this area until a more intensive cultural
resource assessment is completed.
Site 41WM1256 is a small rockshelter located on the bluff above the South Fork of the San Gabriel River,
about 120 m south of Structure 105 (Figure 165). The shelter is about 5 m wide, 2 m deep and and 1 to
1.5 m high and is located below the crest of the bluff and above a long limestone ledge that parallels the
river at a height of about 30 feet (Figure 166). There is a small chamber on one side of the shelter, which
is dry. A Darl or Darl-like point was present on the surface (Figure 167), as was a tabular chert fragment
likely of cultural origin. Some bone was also present, although almost certainly brought in by animals,
except possibly for one tooth from a large bovid or horse. No other skeletal material was present that
might explain its presence. There are no impacts expected that this location for the present project, and
no suggestions for avoidance are made. This is potentially a highly significant site, and its presence
should be made known to construction and other personnel only if absolutely necessary.
Site 41WM1257 and 41WM1258 are both located in close vicinity to the large quarry (Texas Crushed
Stone) on IH 35. Site 41WM1257 is centered on Structure 94, and extends about 100 m on either side.
Site 41WM1258 is located between STR 89 and 91, and extends a distance of about 700 meters. Both
sites consist of large amounts of tabular chert (“Georgetown flint”) that has been variously reduced into
flakes and occasional bifaces. The entire stretch of ROW has been severely impacted by bulldozing, and
machine flakes are undoubtedly common as well. The two sites are actually loci of activity and raw
material abundance, and could probably be joined into one very large site is desired. These sites,
therefore, represent a locale more than bounded sites. There is little research value within the ROW, but
the general area has potential for useful landscape studies. Regardless, there are no recommendations for
avoidance at these two sites.
On T-378 the area north of FM3406 is overgrown with small mesquite. It parallels and crosses Onion
Branch. The soils here are heavy dark clays. A single shovel test was placed about 50 m north of STR
61. There are no recommendations for avoidance here, other than to not use bulldozers for clearing.
Otherwise, shredders and seppie-like machinery will not impact this area any more than has been done
previously. The area recommended for bulldozer avoidance is between FM3406 and STR62.
The remainder of the high probability areas was found to be either artificially contoured or so minor as to
not warrant intensive survey for this project.
360

In summary, for the purposes of this memo, there is one area on T-355 and T-378 that requires avoidance
in the form of not allowing bulldozing. This is between FM3406 and STR 62, a distance of about 470 m.

Project 32.10 T- Elm Creek Lift Station Expansion
(Figure 170)
County(s):

Travis

Type of Investigation:

Field survey

Date of Investigation:

July 2010

On July 7, 2010, LCRA’s Archeology Services conducted a cultural resource field survey of the Elm
Creek Lift Station Expansion project area in Western Travis County one mile west of Elgin. The
expansion will cover a 5625 feet2 (0.13 acre) square-shaped area, 75 feet on a side, adjoining the north
side of the existing lift station perimeter fence. The west side of the addition area is bounded by County
Line Road. Earlier, a file search by Archeology Services staff showed that this area had not previously
been surveyed for cultural resources.
The survey involved a walk-over of the project area and the excavation of two shovel tests. For each
shovel test, a circular hole 35cm in diameter was dug and the fill screened through a ¼ inch wire mesh to
recover any artifacts. At the time of the survey, the project area was covered by a thick carpet of grasses
and forbs, allowing little visibility of the ground surface. The few patches of visible earth showed no
artifacts or other evidence of human presence.
The west half of the project area ascends to the elevated bed of County Line Road. A shovel test placed
in this area encountered mottled yellow and brown clay loam from the surface down to a depth of 40cm
where the test ended. No artifacts were recovered from this test. The mottled, and presumably disturbed,
earth appears to be fill brought in to raise the roadbed. A second test excavated on the more level ground
east of the rise encountered a very different, perhaps natural, soil profile. The upper 12cm of soil was
composed of a dark grayish brown clay loam overlying a grayish yellow clay. The dark grayish brown
clay loam contained abundant charcoal fragments, burned pebbles, clear bottle glass, and Styrofoam
fragments. The clay beneath contained no artifacts down to a depth of 40cm. It appears that recent trash
burning - or dumping of burned trash - took place within the project area. However, no evidence of
earlier human use of the area was found. Probably the low-lying, flood-prone area was unsuitable for
human occupation in the past.
Since no archeological sites were recorded during the survey and the project area covers less than five
acres, a report does not need to be sent to the Texas Historical Commission for review and the project can
proceed by virtue of this memo.

Project 33.10 Fire break at McKinney Roughs
(Figure 171)
County(s):

Bastrop

Type of Investigation:

Field survey

Date of Investigation:

July 2010

LCRA proposes to construct a firebreak along the eastern portion of its McKinney Roughs property in
Bastrop County, Texas. The project will consist of clearing a minimum of a 16 foot wide corridor of
vegetation along approximately 3,000 feet of existing public and private roadways and constructing a new
fence (Figure 1). All clearing is expected to be done by hand. Following clearing, a new fence will be
constructed to replace an existing barbed wire fence that is in disrepair. Although actual ground
disturbance will be minimal, it was determined that much of the area had not been surveyed for cultural
resources, and that there were some areas, particularly near the Colorado River, that warranted an
investigation.
Investigations were conducted on July 8, 2010, by LCRA Cultural Resources staff. The southern portion
of the project area is near the residence and maintenance facilities that were previously investigated in
2003. One archaeological site, 41BP661 was recorded and determined to be not eligible for formal listing
as a State Archeological Landmark. This area was not reinvestigated. The remainder of the project,
running northward to the Colorado River, is alongside a road that has been cut into a hill side, resulting in
a deep gully where clearing will take place. The only exception is near the river, where there is a small
side drainage and the final river terrace. Three shovel probes were excavated within these settings. The
first found loams to a depth of 60 cm, the second clay to a depth of 40 cm, and the third fine sand to a
depth of 40 cm. The probes were not expanded or deepened due to the obvious low probability of the
relative steep and dissected terrain.
No cultural resources were identified as a result of these investigations, and the project may proceed
without additional input from Cultural Resources staff. If, however, unexpected archaeological materials
are found during the project, please halt ground disturbing activities in the vicinity of the discovery until
Cultural Resources staff can be notified and assess the find.

Project 35.10 2010 Vaughn Tract Fence Replacement Project at the Wheless Tract
(Figure 172)
County(s):

Travis

Type of Investigation:

Field survey

Date of Investigation:

July 2010

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Archaeology Services staff has completed a cultural
resource assessment for proposed construction of a replacement fence around the northeast portion of the
Vaughn Tract, which is a southward extension of the LCRA Wheless Tract in Travis County, Texas
(Figure 1). Approximately 4,900 linear feet of new fence will be constructed to replace an existing fence.
The fence line is adjacent to a previously cleared 16 ft wide fire lane area, so the only soil disturbance
will be the placement of the fence post holes.
The file search that was conducted for the proposed project showed that there are no previously recorded
archaeological sites along the proposed fence line. The file search also indicated that an approximately
1,200 foot long stretch of the existing fence line that formed the original south boundary of the Wheless
Tract had been previously surveyed with negative results during LCRA staff field inventory work in
2002. Map review of the other 3,700 linear feet of the fence line not previously surveyed suggests that an
approximately 1,400 foot long stretch has a moderate to high probability for unrecorded cultural resource
sites. This 1,400 foot long section extends from the original south boundary of the Wheless tract to the
north bank of a tributary of Long Hollow Creek and it is shown as the solid red line on Figure 1. The
remainder of the unsurveyed area is judged to have a low probability for any unrecorded sites due to the
steeply sloping nature of the terrain.
A cultural resource field survey was undertaken of 1,400 foot long stretch of high to moderate probability
area fence line on July 21 by the LCRA Archaeology Services staff. Areas that were field investigated
consisted of the terraces and floodplain areas adjacent to the channel of the previously described tributary
of Long Hollow Creek. The investigation was intended to consist of pedestrian survey and shovel testing
where needed. Ground surface visibility was found to be variable. In some areas, ground surface
visibility was good due to sparse vegetation and the presence of limestone bedrock and/or gravels on
ground surface. The shredded wood from previous tree and brush clearing for the fire lane obscured the
ground surface in some areas of the fire lane, but good ground surface visibility was often present just
beyond the edges of the fire lane. Topsoil deposits were absent in many parts of the survey area, and at
best were generally only 5 to 10 cm thick where present at all. The only exception was the presence of a
30 cm thick deposit of grayish brown silty clay loam topsoil along an approximately 20 meter long stretch
of floodplain immediately north of the tributary creek channel. A gully located immediately adjacent to
the fence line in that area provided a long subsurface profile of the soil deposits on that floodplain. No
buried artifacts were observed in the gully, and the good exposures in the gully walls made shovel testing
unnecessary. Nor was any shovel testing deemed necessary elsewhere in the project area due to the lack
of any thick topsoil deposits.
In all, about 0.48 acres were intensely surveyed. No cultural resource sites were found during the
investigation. Based on the negative results of the fieldwork and the fact that the fence line area totals
less than 5 acres in total area, a report does not have to be sent to the Texas Historical Commission at this
time. Instead, the proposed fence construction may proceed by virtue of this memo. The LCRA
Archaeology Services staff will report this investigation next March in its annual report to THC under
Blanket Antiquities Permit #5528. However, should the personnel constructing the fence uncover any
presently unknown buried archaeological materials, then work should cease in the immediate area of the
369

discovery and the LCRA Archaeology Services staff should be contacted at 1-800-776-5272 ext. 6714 so
that the find can be assessed and a determination can be made as to whether any avoidance/mitigation
measures are needed.

LCRA proposes to conduct standard enhancement and maintenance on T-383, between the Kerrville
Stadium and Kerrville Legion substations. Transmission line T-383 was surveyed by Espey Huston and
Associates (EHA, now PBS&J) in 1995. As a result of the investigations site 41KR504 was recorded.
This was a historic trash scatter that was considered to be fully recorded and ineligible for formal listing
as a State Archeological Landmark. No other archaeological sites were recorded during the survey on T383.
LCRA Cultural resources department therefore has no restrictions for the 2010 enhancement
project. Should this line ever be rebuilt, the report by EHA should be reassessed for scope of survey, and
select high probability areas should be considered for additional investigations.

(Figure 174)
County(s):

Type of Investigation:

File search

Date of Investigation:

July 2010

The cultural resource assessment of the proposed FY 05 enhancement work on T-131/379 (Gillespie - Live
Oak - Fredericksburg) has been completed by the LCRA’s Archeology Services staff. The assessment
consisted of a search of the Texas Historical Commission’s computerized Sites Atlas and the LCRA’s
internal cultural resource files.
The file search indicated that one previously recorded site, 41GL279, extends into the T-131/379
approximately 500 feet southeast of the Gillespie Substation. The site was discovered by archeologists
from Espey, Huston & Associates (EH&A) during a 1994 survey for the LCRA of the T-266 line, which
shares the corridor with T-131/379 for a distance of 600 feet south of the substation. Site 41GL279 consists
of a light scatter of chipping debris – less than one flint flake per square meter – and one simple flake tool.
These materials are confined to the surface and the absence of natural soil cover at this locality means that
there is no chance of any buried cultural material. Because of the scarcity of the artifacts and lack of formal
tools, coupled with the fact that buried cultural deposits do not exist, site 41GL279 was deemed ineligible
for State Archeological Landmark status by the EH&A investigators and no avoidance was recommended at
the time.
No evidence was found during the file search that the rest of the T-131/379 corridor has ever been surveyed
for cultural resources by professional archeologists. An inspection of the West Fredericksburg 7.5’ USGS
map showed that the T-131/379 crosses Barons Creek, a perennial stream as well as its tributary, Winfried
Creek. Areas along such creeks have a high potential for prehistoric sites and are often covered by alluvial
deposits that might contain buried cultural material.
For the upcoming enhancement work, subsurface disturbances need to be kept at a minimum within
1000 feet of either bank of both Barons Creek and Winfried Creek. However, if any buried
archeological features are uncovered during unavoidable ground-disturbing activities, then work
should cease in the immediate area of the discovery, and the LCRA Archeology Services staff should be
contacted at 1-800-776-5272, ext.6714 so that the find can be assessed and a determination can be made as
to whether any avoidance/mitigation measures are needed.

(Figure 175)

Date of Investigation:

July 2010

(this memo was originally sent in 2004)
A cultural resource file search has been conducted for the Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA)
proposed clearing and maintenance work on Transmission Line T-157, which is also known as the Luling
to Lockhart Transmission Line. A check of the Texas Historical Commission’s digitized Site Atlas and
the LCRA’s internal cultural resource files indicates that the T-157 transmission line has not been
previously surveyed for cultural resource sites. The file search also showed that are no previously
recorded archeological sites that are located within or near the T-157 line right-of-way (ROW).
Examination of topographic maps suggests that there are high to moderate potentials for unrecorded
archeological sites where T-157 crosses the floodplain and first terraces on either side of the Clear Fork of
Plum Creek, the West Fork of Plum Creek, and at the two crossings of Seals Creek. If any of these
streams require modifications to the channels or banks, or should the personnel conducting the clearing
and maintenance work uncover any presently unknown buried archeological materials, then work should
cease in the immediate area of the stream or discovery area and the LCRA Archeology Services staff
should be contacted at 1-800-776-5272, ext. 6714. LCRA staff will then determine what, if any
additional investigations should be conducted, and if necessary work with the Texas Historical
Commission to assess the emergency discovery finding and determine if any avoidance/mitigation
measures are needed. In such a situation, work can continue in other areas where stream crossings are not
necessary and no archeological materials are present.

(Figure 176)
County(s):

Type of Investigation:

File search

Date of Investigation:

August 2010

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Archaeology Services staff has completed a cultural
resource desktop review for the proposed overhaul work on Transmission Line T-519, which is also
known as the Lockhart to Reedville line. This transmission line extends for a length of about 9 miles in
Caldwell County, Texas.
The desktop review showed that the portions of the T-519 having a high probability for cultural resource
sites were field surveyed by LCRA Cultural Resource staff in 2009 prior to scheduled transmission line
maintenance activities. Two archaeological sites, 41CW147 and 41CW148, were recorded during the
field survey. Site 41CW148 is a small historic period trash dump that consists of artifacts dating from the
late 19th to early 20th century. Site 41CW148 was assessed as insignificant and proposed maintenance
activities were allowed to proceed through the site area. Any needed overhaul work may also proceed
within this site area.
Site 41CW147 is multi-component site consisting of a prehistoric campsite and a historic period artifact
scatter that may represent the remains of a former farm house or another trash dump. The portion of
41CW147 that is located within the transmission line ROW was assessed as insignificant, and
maintenance was allowed to proceed within the ROW. However, during the field survey, Doug Dube of
the LCRA Energy Services Supervisor showed the archaeological crew the route of a proposed vehicular
access road that will extend outside the transmission line ROW around the north end of a portion of the
ROW containing site 41CW148. That road loop was needed to avoid damaging a sensitive wetland area
located within the transmission line ROW. Subsequent archaeological investigation of the proposed
access road area showed that potentially significant archaeological deposits that are a part of 41CW148
were present in the road corridor. The archaeologists then found an alternative road route for Dube to use
so that no significant archaeological deposits would be damaged by vehicular traffic. That alternative
access road route is marked as the “preferred access road corridor” on the attached map, and it was
described in the Environmental Summary for Maintenance Activities as the sensitive area in the vicinity
of Structure 64/5. The overhaul crew should also use this same access road corridor if they need to travel
outside the transmission line ROW to avoid the wetland feature. Driving off this designated access road
is prohibited.

(Figure 177)
County(s):

Caldwell and Hays

Type of Investigation:

File search

Date of Investigation:

July 2010

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Archaeology Services staff has completed a cultural
resource desktop review for the proposed overhaul work on Transmission Line T-220, which is also
known as the San Marcos to Camp Gary to Reedville line. This transmission line extends for a length of
about 5.3 miles in Caldwell and Hays Counties, Texas.
The desktop review showed that the portions of the T-220 having high probabilities for cultural resource
sites were field surveyed by LCRA Cultural Resources staff in 2009 prior to scheduled transmission line
maintenance activities. One archaeological site, 41HY466, was recorded during the field survey. This site
is a prehistoric campsite that was found on the east side of the Blanco River. The site was assessed as
insignificant because deposits were found to be shallow and thoroughly disturbed by land clearing and
plowing. All proposed maintenance activities were allowed to proceed within the archaeological site area
and elsewhere.
A check of the Texas Historical Commission’s computerized Site Atlas indicated that there have not been
any new cultural resource sites recorded within or near the transmission line ROW since the time of the
LCRA staff’s fieldwork last year.
Based on the results of the review, it does not appear that there are any significant or potentially significant
cultural resource sites within the T-220 corridor. The LCRA Cultural Resources staff recommends that all
of the proposed T-220 overhaul work be allowed to proceed. However, standard emergency discovery
provisions are always applicable. Should the personnel conducting the work uncover any presently
unknown buried archaeological materials during construction, then work should cease in the immediate area
of the discovery and the LCRA Archaeology Services staff should be contacted at 1-800-776-5272 ext.
6714 or 2753 so that the find can be reported to the Texas Historical Commission and a determination can
be made as to whether any avoidance/mitigation measures are needed.

Project 44.10 Pedernales River Nature Park Demolition
(Figure 178)
County(s):

Blanco

Type of Investigation:

Field survey

Date of Investigation:

August 2010

At their Pedernales River Nature Park in Blanco County, the LCRA is planning to fill in the swimming
pool and demolish the associated bathhouses and nearby lodge building. These facilities were built by the
previous owner of the property and have not been in use for many years. In addition to the demolition of
these facilities, the LCRA plans to remove a large pile of concrete rubble located near the park’s eastern
boundary fence. Cultural resources surveys by the LCRA’s Archeology Services staff had earlier
recorded prehistoric archeological sites near these areas. Site 41BC155 lies immediately to the west of
the swimming pool, 41BC161 lies immediately north of the lodge building, and 41BC154 lies a short
distance north of the concrete rubble pile. The demolition activities and the removal of the rubble pile by
heavy machinery could damage portions of these sites should they extend into the project areas, or
damage other sites that are yet to be recorded. Therefore, Archeology Services staff conducted a cultural
resources survey of all three areas, which together cover about two acres, to assess the significance of any
archeological deposits that might be present.
The survey was conducted on August 2, 2010 starting first at the swimming pool complex. No cultural
material was seen during the surface inspection along the facility’s perimeter fence. A shovel test was
placed on the west side of the complex between it and the known site area of 41BC155. The test found no
intact topsoil, only what appeared to be the clayey subsoil containing a few fragments of modern glass.
The ground in and around the swimming pool complex appears to have been contoured and built up in
places with earthen fill. If 41BC155 once extended into the area, all traces were removed during
construction of the complex.
The survey proceeded next to the lodge building. The ground in the area had been bladed, presumably to
level the surface for the lodge construction. A gravel road, now overgrown with grasses, runs around the
south and east sides of the structure. Soils were found to be too shallow for shovel testing and the survey
was restricted to inspecting the ground surface for cultural material. No surface evidence of an
archeological site was found.
The area around the concrete rubble pile was surveyed last. The pile was located immediately south of an
old concrete retaining wall or foundation on the opposite side of a drainage from 41BC154. In addition to
the concrete rubble, there was a smaller pile of dirt a short distance to the south. Because of the sparse
vegetation in the area, ground surface visibility was good and no artifacts were seen. A shovel test placed
on the slope immediately south of the retaining wall where soil appeared deepest recovered no artifacts.
It does not appear that any cultural resource sites exist in the area around the rubble pile.
Since the project covers less than five acres and contains no archeological sites, a report does not need to
be sent to the Texas Historical Commission for approval. The demolition of the swimming pool complex
and lodge building, and the removal of the rubble pile can proceed.

Project 46.10 Cultural Resource Assessment for the Proposed Construction at the FM 237 Yorktown
Substation
(Figure 179 and Figure 180)
County(s):

DeWitt

Type of Investigation:

Field survey

Date of Investigation:

August 2010

The GVEC has purchased an approximately 4 acre sized tract about 1.75 miles east-northeast of
Yorktown, Texas for the construction of the new FM 237 Yorktown Substation (Figure 179). The
substation acreage is situated immediately northeast of the point at which LCRA’s T-541 transmission
line crosses FM 237. The GVEC will own the substation property and will install associated facilities
such as the control house, ground grid, grading, graveling, and boundary fence. GVEC will also install a
new 69-13.09 kV 4.2 power transformer, voltage regulators, circuit switch with associated relaying and
controls, a 138 kV ABS, and will also install a new low side four bay distribution bus. The LCRA will
construct a 69 kV bus, transmission line A frames, and will install two 69 kV circuit breakers, and
associated relaying and control systems. LCRA will also install a metering package and SCADA
monitoring facilities. As a part of the project, too, LCRA will replace STRs 28/15 and 28/16 on the T541 line with steel poles within the substation property (Figure 180). LCRA STRs 28/13 and 28/14,
which are located southwest of the substation property will be replaced with concrete poles in the same
holes as will STR 28/17 which is located northeast of the substation property.
The LCRA Cultural Resource Services staff has completed a cultural resource assessment for the portions
of the project that LCRA will construct. A file search that was conducted by the Cultural Resource staff
at the start of the project showed that there are no previously recorded cultural resource sites within the
proposed substation property nor are there any sites within the portion of LCRA’s existing T-541
transmission line right-of-way (ROW) in the vicinity of the substation. The file search also indicated that
these areas had not ever been surveyed for cultural resources by a professional archaeologist.
Review of the Yorktown East, Texas 7.5’ USGS map suggested that the substation tract and the area
around the LCRA’s existing STR 28/17 were high probability areas for unrecorded prehistoric
archaeological sites due to nearby presence of an unnamed tributary of Fifteenmile Creek. To assess the
potential for unrecorded historic period sites (a second category of concern), early dating USGS maps
were examined to determine if any houses or other types of structures had ever been present on the
substation tract and associated transmission line. The earliest dating available map is the 1909 Goliad,
Texas 1:125,000 map. That map indicates that in 1909, there were no houses or other structures in the
project area, and the acreage appears to be non-cultivated rangeland. Subsequent maps consisting of the
1963 and 1987 Yorktown, East Texas 7.5’ USGS maps do not show any houses or other types of
structures within the project area. The 1963 map suggested that the substation tract had been cleared and
was under cultivation during that era.
Because of the potential for unrecorded prehistoric sites, a cultural resource field survey was conducted
on August 11, 2010. Areas investigated consisted of the substation elements that LCRA will construct
and the area near the creek where LCRA will replace STR 28/17. LCRA’s proposed construction will
take place in an area about 0.25 acre is size. That area was field surveyed as was an additional 0.85 acre
area surrounding the LCRA construction where the ground could be disturbed by vehicular traffic and
construction staging.

384

The field investigation showed that the substation area is covered in thick grasses, but the presence of
numerous gopher burrow backdirt piles provided a good sample of the types of soils and materials within
the surface and subsurface deposits. Ground surface visibility was found to be better in the area closer to
the creek where STR 28/17 will be replaced, and numerous gopher burrow backdirt piles were also
present in that area. Additionally, five shovel tests were excavated to further sample the areas where
LCRA will undertake construction. The shovel tests where dug where the new bus, A frames, and circuit
breakers will be built and where the two existing STRs 28/15 and 16 will be replaced within the proposed
substation tract.
Topsoils were found to be the Papalote fine sandy loam that ranged from 39 to 84 cm in thickness. This
topsoil was mostly void of any lithic or other types of materials within the exception of Shovel Test #4
where a few rounded quartize gravels with a maximum diameter of 2.5 cm were found at depths of 30 to
80 cm below ground surface. Deeper, a dark gray sandy clay formed the B horizon subsoil in all shovel
tests.
No evidences of any prehistoric sites were found within the areas where LCRA will construct substation
elements and replace transmission poles along the T-541 line. Based on the negative results of the
fieldwork and the fact that the areas investigated total less than 5 acres, a report does not have to be sent
to the Texas Historical Commission at this time. Instead, LCRA’s proposed construction for the
substation project may proceed by virtue of this memo. However, standard emergency discovery
procedures are always applicable during construction. Should the personnel constructing LCRA’s
portion of this project uncover any presently unknown buried archaeological materials, then work should
cease in the immediate area of the discovery and the LCRA Cultural Resource staff should be contacted at
1-800-776-5272 ext. 6714 so that the find can be assessed and a determination can be made as to whether
any avoidance/mitigation measures are needed.

Yard
(Figure 181)
County(s):

Mason

Type of Investigation:

Field survey

Date of Investigation:

August 2010

On August 10, 2010, LCRA’s Archeology Services staff surveyed a 4.9 acre area in Mason County that
the LCRA Transmission Services Corporation plans to use as an equipment laydown yard for the
Pittsburg to Fort Mason T-268 Transmission Line Overhaul project. The proposed laydown site is
located at the southwest corner where T-268 intersects RR1900.
The survey team investigated a square area measuring 140 meters (463 feet) on a side with the northeast
corner being where the south edge of the T-268 ROW and the west edge of the RR1900 ROW intersect.
This area was mostly level and open with a few scattered trees and brush along the south and west
margins. Low granite outcrops are frequent and, with a few exceptions, flush with the ground surface.
These were inspected for prehistoric cultural features such as grinding slicks and mortar holes that occur
on granite exposures in the region. No bedrock features were seen. In places with soil, ground visibility
was generally good because of the sparse grass cover. No artifacts were observed on the ground surface.
To check for buried cultural material, two shovel tests were placed in areas that appeared to have more
than a few inches of soil depth. The deepest of these tests encountered bedrock at a depth of 15cm (six
inches). The fill from both tests was screened through a ¼” wire mesh for artifacts and none were
recovered. Further shovel testing was deemed unnecessary by the survey crew because of the thin soil
cover and good surface visibility. If an archeological site were present in the project area, there would be
evidence on the surface.
Since the area of possible subsurface disturbances covers less than five acres and contains no
archeological sites, a report does not need to be sent to the Texas Historical Commission for approval.
Use of this area as a laydown yard can proceed.

Date of Investigation:

August 2010

LCRA proposes to enhance transmission lines T-430 and T-431 in Coke, Sterling and Mitchell counties,
Texas. Work will consist of standard maintenance and other activities required for maintaining access
and ensuring reliability.
Both T-430 and T-431 were surveyed for cultural resources by PBS&J in 2002 as part of the Morgan to
Comanche Creek transmission line construction project which included T-422 (PBS&J Document
020173). Several sites were recorded, and only two (41CK218 and 41TG565) required any type of
avoidance. These sites were both on T-422. There were no avoidance areas on T-430 or T-431.
In summary, for the proposed enhancement project on T-430 and T-4321 there are no know cultural
resource issues. Should crews uncover substantial cultural materials during ground disturbing activities
they should cease such activities in the location of the find until Cultural Resources staff can be notified
and the find evaluated.

LCRA proposes to reshred the existing ROW on the T-413 transmission line which runs from Glasscock
to Andice in Williamson County. This line was surveyed by Horizon Environmental Services in 2005,
prior to construction. As a result of the survey, nine archaeological sites, 41WM1135-41WM1142 and
41WM1145 were recorded. There are two areas that were recommended for avoidance during
construction. These were at sites 41WM1140 and 41WM1141. For the purposes of the present project
there are no special precautions at 41WM1141.
At or very near, probably just to the west of STR 84 (the site report is not clear), is located a hand-dug
stone-lined cistern that makes up 41WM1140. It is very near a large oak tree. Care should be taken not
to accidently damage this feature with equipment.
There are no other concerns for the rest of this project. Future projects with more substantial impacts may
require additional avoidance areas.

(Figure 184)

Type of Investigation:

File search

Date of Investigation:

August 2010

Note: This memo was originally sent in April, 2004
The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Archeology Services staff has completed a cultural
resource assessment for the proposed FY 04 clearing and maintenance CIP work on Transmission Line T240, which is also known as the Turtle Creek to Hunt Transmission Line. The assessment consisted of a
file search for the entire transmission line route and a field survey of selected sites of archeological
significance that might be impacted by the maintenance operations.
The file search consisted of a check of the Texas Historical Commission’s digital Sites Atlas and the
LCRA’s internal cultural resource files. The file search indicated the entire transmission line corridor was
previously surveyed for cultural resources by Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc in 1985. Fifteen prehistoric
archeological sites were identified during that survey including three that had been recorded previously.
Only three of these 15 sites (41KR100, 41KR223, AND 41KR228), all burned rock midden sites with
associated lithic scatters, were recommended for State Archeological Landmark designation and avoidance
during future maintenance and repair of the T-240 line.
On April 15, 2004, LCRA Archeological Services staff planned to revisit all three sites recommended for
avoidance to ascertain how they might be impacted during the upcoming maintenance operations and to
determine what avoidance measures should be taken. However, one site, 41KR100 on Turtle Creek, could
not be reached because access was blocked by a high fence across the T-240 ROW. The Espey, Huston, &
Associates, Inc report indicated that the burned rock midden at 41KR100 was outside the transmission line
ROW and that the site as a whole had been severely damaged by looting. According to Michael Havner,
an LCRA employee familiar with the T-240 corridor, the site lies in an open field and probably would not
need the kind of heavy brush clearing that might disturb subsurface cultural deposits.
Of the two sites that were visited during the April 15 survey, 41KR223 on Ox Hollow Creek will probably
not be adversely impacted by the maintenance operations and no special precautions are recommended.
Neither the burned rock midden nor its associated lithic scatter extend into (or really come close to) the
transmission line ROW. Only a few chert flakes and one core were observed on the surface in the area
southwest of the ROW but this area also contains naturally occurring chert that has been crushed and
burned during repeated land clearings.
The other site visited that day, 41KR228 close to the Guadalupe River near Hunt, did possess a small,
apparently intact burned rock midden in the center of the ROW directly under the transmission line wires,
approximately 140 to 180 feet west of the Structure 65. This midden, referred to as ‘Midden B’ in the
Espey, Huston & Associates report, has the appearance of a low knoll eight inches or so high and 40 feet
across with fist-size limestone rock exposed on the surface. Plowing and other farming activities have no
doubt caused some damage but the subsurface portion of Midden B could be more or less intact and should
be avoided by heavy vehicles. The other burned rock midden at 41KR228, Midden A, is located outside
the ROW and will not be impacted by the maintenance efforts.

394

In summary, the field investigations confirmed the location of two previously recorded sites, 41KR223 and
41KR228, while a high fence across the ROW prevented access to the third site, 41KKR100, which was not
visited by the Archeological Services staff. With information supplied by an LCRA employee and the
Espey, Huston & Associates report, 41KR100 probably will not be impacted since the midden lies outside
the ROW and the lithic scatter portion of the site is situated in open field devoid of trees and brush. At
41KR223, the archeological deposits, including a small midden also lie outside the ROW and will not be
endangered by the proposed maintenance. Only at 41KR228, where a burned rock midden lies directly in
the T-240 ROW, do any avoidance measures need to be taken. This can be accomplished by simply not
driving any heavy vehicles directly over the midden. Instead, the vehicles should drive along either the
north or south edges of the ROW in this vicinity.
Aside from this recommendation, work may proceed without any further cultural resource review.
However, should any buried archeological features be uncovered during ground-disturbing activities, then
work should cease in the immediate area of the discovery, and the LCRA Archeology Services staff should
be contacted at 1-800-776-5272, ext.6714 so that the find can be assessed and a determination can be made
as to whether any avoidance/mitigation measures are needed.

Locater notes:
Avoidance at 41KR100 is at or very near STR 8
Avoidance at 41KR223 is about midway between STRs 57 and 58
Avoidance at 41KR228 is about midway between STRs 65 and 66
Additional note:
Sites 41KR223 and 41KR228 are formally listed as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs).

This memo was originally sent by Chuck Hixson to Melissa Moore in September of 2004
The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Archeology Services staff has completed a cultural
resource assessment for the proposed FY 05 clearing and maintenance work on Transmission Line T-177,
which is also known as the Fayetteville to Salem Transmission Line. The assessment involved a search of
the LCRA’s internal cultural resource files which indicated that the entire transmission line corridor had
been previously surveyed for cultural resources by the Texas Archeological Survey of the University of
Texas in 1982.
During the 1982 survey, only one archeological site (41AU53) was identified within the corridor between
the Fayetteville and Salem Substations. This site consisted of a 700 m2 scatter of flint chipping debris on a
terrace remnant of a dry tributary of West Fork Mill Creek located approximately midway along the
corridor between the two substations. No stone tools or features, such as cooking hearths, were observed
and an inspection of the channel cut indicated that the chipping debris was confined to the surface. The site
was judged not to have National Register significance and no avoidance or monitoring was recommended.
The very act of recording the site was considered sufficient to mitigate whatever damage might occur
during any future improvements within the transmission line corridor.
The clearance and maintenance work on the T-177 line may therefore proceed without any further cultural
resource review. However, should any buried archeological features be uncovered during grounddisturbing activities, then work should cease in the immediate area of the discovery, and the LCRA
Archeology Services staff should be contacted at 1-800-776-5272, ext.6714 so that the find can be assessed
and a determination can be made as to whether any avoidance/mitigation measures are needed.

Project 58.10 Formal Bird Viewing Area at Lake Bastrop South Shore Park
(Figure 186)

County(s):

Bastrop

Type of Investigation:

Field survey

Date of Investigation:

October 2010

The LCRA is planning to construct a formal bird viewing area in the Lake Bastrop South Shore Park.
The project will involve the construction of a covered viewing shed resting on a 25 foot by 8 foot pad of
decomposed granite. The structure will be anchored by eight posts with a diameter of 8 to 10 inches
placed two feet into the ground. A circulating pond will be built on the ground surface to the east of the
proposed viewing shed consisting of a cattle trough encircled by stone. Electricity to power the
recirculating pump will come from an underground power line running from the pond to an existing
utility pole 400 feet to the north. The trench for the power line will be 18 inches to 2 feet in depth and 6
inches wide and will run along the west side of the existing hiking trail. In addition, dead trees, brush,
and four cedar trees in the shed footprint will be hand cleared. Underbrush will also be hand cleared in
the area east of the proposed viewing shed to provide a clear view of the lake.
A file search showed that no archeological sites have been recorded in the project area. Since no
evidence could be found that the area had been previously investigated for cultural resources, the LCRA
Archeology Services staff visited the project area on October 15, 2010 to conduct a field survey. The
survey consisted of surface inspection and the excavation of two shovel tests to search for buried cultural
material. In addition, a magnetic detector, a device that detects the magnetic field of iron objects, was
used to search for buried ordinance in areas were ground disturbances will occur.
The viewing shed construction site was investigated first. The ground in and around the trail in this area
was mostly free of vegetation. No artifacts were observed. The area was swept with the magnetic
detector and no buried iron objects were detected. A shovel test was placed within the footprint of the
proposed shed. It was dug to a depth of 60cm through loamy sand and no artifacts were recovered. The
ground to the east of the proposed shed site was also inspected for cultural material and none was found.
Next the ground along the west side of the hiking trail where the power line trench will run was
inspected and swept with the magnetic detector. No cultural material was seen on the surface however
the magnetic detector did detect three buried iron objects at different locations along the trail. The first
detector strike was located 32 meters north of the proposed viewing shed. The object turned out to be a
large nail buried several inches below the surface. A shovel test placed at this location encountered
gravelly loamy sand to a depth 12 cm before hitting a clay zone. No artifacts were recovered. The other
two detector strikes were located at the north end of the trail just south of where it exists out into the open
parking area for the boat ramp. One of these strikes turned out to be a buried piece of a wire fence. The
other detector strike occurred over a small area of concrete that had been poured in the bed of the trail
perhaps for stabilization. Presumably an iron object is encased in the concrete.
Finally the open area between the north end of the hiking trail and the utility pole was inspected and
swept with the magnetic detector. This area lies within 20 feet of the shoreline of the lake. No surface
artifacts were observed, however the magnetic detector did have 15 strikes. These strikes were arranged
linearly, each strike being about 18 inches apart. Several of these strike locations were excavated and all
turned out to be large staples about an inch in width and about 4 inches long buried just under the ground
surface. Presumably all the strikes in this area were caused by buried staples. Considering their
399

arrangement and location near the shoreline, the staples were probably used to hold down netting or fabric
for erosion control.
Our survey found no evidence of an archeological site within the project area. All the iron objects
detected with the magnetic detector appear to be modern. No ordinance or other objects associated with
the World War II period of Camp Swift were found. Since no archeological sites are present and the
project area is less than five acres, a report does not have to be sent to the Texas Historical Commission
for review. The project can proceed by virtue of this menu.

Date of Investigation:

October 2010

LCRA proposes to conduct enhancements on transmission line T-342, from the Kendall to Mountain Top
substations in Kendall and Blanco counties, Texas. Activities will include standard maintenance to
ensure the ROW and transmission line remains reliable.
A cultural resources assessment of this line was conducted by LCRA Cultural Resources staff in 2007.
The work consisted of a file and map review.
The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Archaeology Services staff has completed a cultural
resource review for proposed overhaul work for Transmission Line T-342, Kendall to Mountaintop,
Upgrade Project. The assessment consisted of a file search of the entire transmission line corridor. The
file search indicated that a cultural resource field survey of T-342 was conducted for LCRA by Prewitt
and Assoc., Inc. in 2004 as a part of the larger Kendall to Miller Creek Transmission Line Rebuild
Project. One potentially significant archaeological site, 41KE158 was found in the T-342 portion of the
survey. This archaeological site is a buried Native American campground deposit with materials
extending from 6 to 24 inches below the current ground surface.
The Prewitt and Assoc. Inc. report states that Transmission Structure #54/5 is within the boundaries of
site 41KE158. Since it turned out that Transmission Structure #54/5 was not one of those that LCRA
needed to rebuild back in 2004, the only requirement for the 2004 rebuild project was that vehicles using
the T-342 ROW to access other rebuild areas avoid this archaeological site area during wet weather
conditions.
For the present project, ground disturbing activities should be minimized from STR 54/5 to a point
350 to the northeast. Heavy equipment should avoid this area during wet conditions.
Aside from issues related to site 41KE158, the current T-342 enhancement may proceed without any
further cultural resource review. However, as always, should the personnel conducting the upgrade work
uncover any presently unknown buried archaeological materials during construction, then work should
cease in the immediate area of the discovery and the LCRA Archaeology Services staff should be
contacted at 1-800-776-5272 ext. 6714 so that the find can be reported to the Texas Historical
Commission and a determination can be made as to whether any avoidance/mitigation measures are
needed.

LCRA proposes to construct a new restroom facility at the Rio Vista river access property located near
McKinney Roughs on Poe Bend Road (Figure 1, Figure 2). The facility will consist of a prefabricated
building placed above a hole that will be three to four feet deep and six to eight feet in diameter.
Despite the small footprint of the project, its location on a high probability terrace of the Colorado River
near previously recorded State Archeological Landmark site 41BP821 necessitated a field investigation.
Investigations were conducted on November 16, 2010 by LCRA Cultural resources staff. A single shovel
test was excavated at the location of the proposed toilet. It was excavated through 26 cm of compacted road
base after which brown sandy clay loam was encountered to a depth of 46 cm. The test continued through
brown sandy clay to a final depth of 75 cm, where increasing density rendered further hand testing
impossible.
Despite not reaching the desired test depth of 100-120 cm, the shovel test indicates that the potential for
buried cultural materials at that location to be very slim. The project may proceed as described; however,
please inform construction personnel that if unexpected cultural materials are encountered during
excavation then construction should cease until Cultural Resources staff can be contacted at Ext. 6714 and
the find is assessed.

Type of Investigation:

Field survey

Date of Investigation:

December 2010

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Cultural Resource Services staff has completed a cultural
resource assessment for the proposed Cuero area equipment laydown for the T-541 Upgrade Project. This
proposed equipment laydown area is located about 2.7 miles north-northwest of the center of downtown
Cuero, Texas. The laydown area is also situated about 1,500 feet northwest of the intersection of FM 766
and the county road that leads to the Cuero Hydro Power Plant (see map attachment). The laydown area
is a four-acre sized tract that is located immediately north of the previously mentioned county road.
A file search showed that there are no previously recorded archaeological sites within the equipment
laydown area, and that the area had not ever been investigated by professional archaeologists. The
laydown yard area was assessed as having a high probability for unrecorded prehistoric cultural resource
sites because it is located near the Guadalupe River and one of its tributary creeks. For this reason, a
cultural resource field survey of the entire four acre tract was undertaken by the LCRA Cultural Resource
Services staff on December 8, 2010.
A pedestrian survey was conducted by a three-person team that walked 30 meter wide transects across the
hayfield where the laydown area will be situated. Bare and eroded areas were checked for evidences of
cultural resource sites. Because of limited ground surface visibility in most of the tract, five shovel tests
were excavated to aid in the assessment. These shovel tests found sandy loam topsoils that extended
downward to depths of 30 to 60 centimeters (cm) below ground surface with gray and reddish-orange
mottled clay subsoil showing up deeper. All fill from the shovel tests was screened through ¼ inch wire
mesh in 20 cm levels.
No artifacts were found during the pedestrian survey or during the shovel testing. Because of the negative
results of the field investigation, it does not appear that any cultural resource sites that may be eligible for
formal designation as State Archeological Landmarks are present.
The proposed use of the four acre tract for the laydown and storage of equipment for the T-541 upgrade
project may proceed at this time without any further cultural resource investigations. Since the area
investigated was less than five acres in size, a report does not have to be sent to the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) at this time for a 30-day review/comment period. Instead, as per our Memorandum
of Understanding with the THC, the results of this investigation will be reported in the LCRA’s Annual
Report of Cultural Resource Investigations for Calendar Year 2010 next April.

Type of Investigation:

Date of Investigation:

November 2010

The LCRA’s Transmission Services Corporation is planning routine enhancement on their T-137
Transmission Line that runs through Fayette and Lee Counties. The transmission line starts at the Warda
Substation and runs for 9.7 miles in a mostly northerly direction to the Giddings Substation on the east
side of that town. A file search showed that the T-137 Line had not been surveyed for cultural resources
except for a 0.5 mile segment at the north end where it shares a corridor with T-222. T-222 was surveyed
by LCRA archeologists in the 1980s and no sites were recorded within the shared corridor.
The unsurveyed portion of T-137 crosses seven streams in which water flows at least part of the year.
These streams include Rabbs Creek, a major stream in the area which the line crosses three times, and
four of its tributaries: Pin Oak Branch, Oil Branch, and two unnamed streams. Areas along intermittent
and perennial streams have a high potential for prehistoric sites and such areas are also more likely to be
disturbed during maintenance operations because of denser vegetation and the need to modify stream
banks for vehicle crossings. For these reasons, Archeology Services staff conducted a field survey to
record and assess the significant of any archeological site near these stream crossings that could be
impacted by the project. The survey was done on November 10, 2010 beginning at the first stream
crossing north of the Warda Substation and proceeding northwards towards Giddings. The following
paragraphs discuss each stream crossing separately.
Pin Oak Branch
At the time of the survey, the Pin Oak Branch was not flowing but did contain isolated pools of water
within its deeply incised channel. A thick woods grows along both sides of the creek but is more
extensive on the south side. The transmission line corridor has cut through these woods leaving it free of
large trees and brush. North of the Creek lies a large field covered by Bermuda grass.
The ground within the corridor between Structure 8/9 on the north side of Pin Oak Creek and Structure
9/1 on the south side – separated by 700 feet - was inspected for cultural material. One archeological site,
41FY561, was recorded on the north bank of the creek. The only cultural material noted were four flint
flakes in eroded areas near the upper edge of the north cutbank. Scattered fire-cracked chert pebbles were
also noted but these could have been burned by natural fires or recent land clearing.
The only anticipated impacts from the proposed maintenance would be the re-cutting of an existing
vehicle ramp that had been cut into north bank of the creek on the northeast end of 41FY561. To check
for any cultural deposits that could be impacted by such modification, a shovel test was dug in the field
immediately north of the upper end of a ramp. No cultural material was recovered from the test. The
soil consisted of sandy loam with abundant pebbles and cobbles. These sediments are alluvial in origin
and probably pre-Holocene. Any intact cultural material would have to overlie these gravels, placing
them on or just under the ground surface where they would be dispersed by land clearing and by plowing.
Therefore, the portion of 41FY561 within the ROW is not considered eligible for SAL designation and
does not need to be avoided during the maintenance project. No shovel testing was done south of the
creek, so buried cultural deposits could still be present there. However, since no clearing will be needed,
any cultural deposits should be unaffected by the project.
Unnamed stream crossing #1

409

The next stream crossing surveyed is located 1.5 mile east of the town of Northrup. This stream, which
is a tributary to Rabbs Creek, is not named on the topographic map. The ground was inspected between
County Road 219 north of the creek and a point about 100 feet south of the creek, covering the entire
ROW between Structures 6/6 and 6/7, a distance of about 800 feet. No archeological material was seen
on the surface. The ground north of creek had been scraped and cleared by a bulldozer, leaving a large
backdirt pile. Several abandoned vehicles and farm machines were also in the area north of the creek.
Considering the fair visibility and ground disturbances, if an archeological site were present then some
artifacts would be visible on the surface.
Oil Branch
The line crosses a creek call Oil Branch three miles south of Giddings. The creek channel was
completely dry at the time of the survey, and moderately entrenched. Its banks, including those within the
ROW, are thickly wooded. The ground between Structures 4/6 north of the creek and 4/7 on the south
was inspected for cultural material and none was seen. The slight rise north of the creek (where Structure
4/6 is located) appeared to have a high potential for a site. The ground was carefully inspected for
artifacts and one shovel test was dug. The soil consisted of a thin sandy surface horizon over a substrate
of red clay. No artifacts were recovered. Another shovel test was dug on the south side of the creek. It
reached a deep of about two feet in silty sand without any artifact recovery.
Rabbs Creek crossings
About 3500 feet north of Oil Branch, the line crosses Rabbs Creek at three locations as it meanders
through a broad valley floor that is mostly open pasture. At this point the creek flows through a deeply
entrenched channel with high steep banks. The location with the highest potential for a site appeared to
be on the south side of the first crossing north of Oil Branch where the ground is highest and where
Structure 4/1 is located. No artifacts were seen on the surface or in the upper part of the cut bank. A
shovel test encountered a thin zone of silty sand over silty clay and recovered no artifacts. The narrow
area on the east side of the meander north of the first crossing is low-lying and open and was not
surveyed. The area between the second crossing and the third crossing, essentially between Structures
3/10 and 3/9, was inspected and no artifacts were found. The line’s third and final crossing of Rabbs
Creeks is over a concrete dam and causeway immediately north of Structure 3/9. No cultural material
was seen on either side of the dam. In any case, no bank modification will be needed for maintenance
vehicles to cross.
Unnamed stream crossing #2
The last crossing surveyed was over a tributary stream of Wolf branch, which in turn is a tributary of
Rabbs Creek. This unnamed stream has well-defined terraces rising on either side of a narrow, wooded,
floodplain. Ground visibility between the railroad and the south terrace drop-off was excellent and no
artifacts were seen. The narrow floodplain was quickly inspected but the sediments are probably too
recent to have archeological deposits. The terrace north of the creek was surveyed between the north
terrace edge and a point midway between Structures 2/4 and 2/5. A shovel test placed in this area
encountered thin sandy soil over clay. No artifacts were recovered.
To summarize, seven stream crossings were surveyed resulting in the recording of one archeological site,
41FY561, on the north bank of Pin Oak Creek. The site contains a light scatter of stone chipping debris
and burned rock. The cultural deposits are thin and sparse and the site is not considered eligible for State
Archeological Landmark status. Maintenance operations can proceed without avoidance measures at this
site and elsewhere within the T-137 corridor. However, the survey only looked a small portion of the
transmission line corridor and unrecorded archeological sites could still be present, especially along the
minor stream crossings. Should the work crews notice any archeological features in an area being
disturbed by stream bank modification or brush clearing then work should stop at that location and
Archeology Services notified. Work can proceed in other areas of the project away from the find site.

Date of Investigation:

November 2010

The LCRA’s Transmission Services Corporation (TSC) is currently conducting routine enhancement of
their T-373 Transmission Line that runs from Schulenburg to Glidden in Colorado and Fayette Counties.
Work is currently proceeding from the east end at Glidden towards the Schulenburg Substation. On
November 11, 2010, enhancement work was temporarily halted on the east side of the westernmost
branch of West Sandy Creek southeast of Weimar because the existing vehicle crossing needed major
stream bank re-cutting. In accordance with the memo sent on June 22, 2010 regarding avoidances within
High Probability Areas for archeological sites, Archeology Services was notified about the need to
modify this particular stream bank. A field visit was made the following day, November 12, by
Archeology Services staff to determine if the bank modification would impact archeological deposits.
Other stream crossings to the west were also visited in case they would eventually require modification as
well.
At the westernmost branch of West Sandy Creek between Structures 21/1 and 21/2, no cultural material
was seen on either side of the creek in the path of the present stream crossing. It was evident that the east
bank would require major re-cutting because of the steep grade. The level area above the top of the bank
was carefully inspected and a shovel test excavated there to a depth of 50cm. A gravel seam was
encountered at about one foot below the surface but no artifacts were recovered. A shallow (one foot
deep) shovel test was placed on the west side of the crossing where little ground modification will be
needed because of the shallow slope. It too failed to recover artifacts. It does not appear that any
archeological deposits will be affected by modification of the stream banks.
The crossing of a minor tributary of Clear Creek located west of the Weimar Substation between
Structures 20/1 and 20/2 was visited next. This stream has gently sloping banks and the existing crossing
will probably need no modification. The ground surface and small cut banks near the crossing were
examined and no cultural material was seen. Re-cutting of this stream crossing, if needed, will not affect
archeological deposits.
The next crossing visited is located on a tributary of Clear Creek between Structures 18/4 and 19/1. This
crossing also has gently sloping banks although the channel has slightly incised into the surrounding
sediments so that some shallow bank modification will be needed for a crossing. No artifacts were seen
in the cutbank other than mid to late 20th century trash that was partially buried in the channel. No
evidence of an archeological site was seen on the ground surface within a hundred feet of the channel.
Stream bank modification of the existing crossing will not affect archeological deposits.
Archeological Services staff next drove by the crossing of a small tributary of Black Bayou located
southeast of Schulenburg between Structures 14/4 and 15/1. This stream has no actual channel and is
essentially a grass-covered linear depression. No modification will apparently be needed at this crossing
and Archeology Services staff did not stop to inspect the area up close.
The crossing of Black Bayou between Structures 14/2 and 14/3 was not visited by Archeology Services
staff. If bank modification is needed, Archeology Services will have to be contacted so that a field visit
can be made.
414

Archeology Services staff also visited several places where T-373 intersects streams that are too deep and
wide for vehicles to cross. These are, from east to west, Clear Creek, East Navidad River, and Middle
Creek. Obviously, if any bank modifications are needed for these streams, Archeological Services will
have to be notified and time allowed for a field visit.
To summarize, LCRA Archeology Services staff visited three existing stream crossings – those between
structures 21/1 and 21/2, 20/1 and 20/2, and 18/4 and 19/ 1 - and found no evidence of a site at any of
these locations. Modification of the stream bank crossings can be done if needed without notification of
Archeology Services. A fourth crossing between Structures 14/4 and 15/1 was viewed from a distance
and did not appear to need modification. If the crossing of Black Bayou between Structures 14/2 and
14/3 needs bank modification please notify Archeology Services at ext. 6714 so that a field visit can be
arranged. All other avoidances listed in the June 22 memo for High Probability Areas remain.

(Figure 193)
County(s):

Type of Investigation:

Field survey

Date of Investigation:

December 2010

The LCRA’s Transmission Services Corporation is planning enhancement operations on their T-267
Transmission Line between the Buchanan CTEC and the Pitsburg Substations in Llano County. Since the
line has not been surveyed for cultural resources, LCRA’s Archeology Services staff visited areas along
the transmission route where probabilities are high for archeological sites and where subsurface
disturbances could result from the enhancement activities. Areas that were investigated in the field
included small stream crossings where bank modification for maintenance vehicles and machinery could
damage any unrecorded sites. The ROWs where the line crosses the Llano River were also inspected
since these areas have a very high probability for prehistoric sites and any brush clearing activities could
damage sites.
The survey was conducted on November 24, December 1, and December 7, 2010 by Archeology Services
staff during which seven archeological sites were recorded. These are described below, including
assessment of their potential for State Archeological Landmark status and recommendations for
avoidance during the enhancement.
Site 1 is a low-density lithic scatter located adjacent to the east side of a small tributary of Sandy Creek.
The site extends eastwards from the creek to a point a few meters east of Structure 5/6, giving a total east
to west length of the site of about 100 meters. Presumably the site extends to the north and south,
covering most of the area within a bend in the creek. At the time of the survey during drought conditions,
a pool of water was standing in the creek channel at the west end of the site. This water may have been
the only resource that drew people to this location, perhaps as a brief stop during hunting forays or other
specialized activities. No evidence of cooking such as burned rocks or food remains were seen and stone
chipping debris, the only cultural material present, occurs in very low frequencies. The flakes were
mostly thick and produced by hard hammer percussion. The granite outcrops that cover much of the
western end of the site were never used as surfaces for grinding plant food. Soils in the site area appear
shallow and no attempt was made to excavate a shovel test. Because of small amount of cultural material
and lack of deep cultural deposits, the site does not appear to be eligible for SAL designation.
Site 2 is a prehistoric lithic scatter and food processing site located on the upper reaches of French John
Creek. Within the ROW, the site area lies between the creek channel on the west and Structure 4/7 on the
east. Three soft hammer thinning flakes made from high-quality chert were found in gopher backdirt,
suggesting that buried cultural deposits are present. However, two shovel tests within the ROW
recovered no subsurface cultural material. At the west end of the site adjacent to the south side of the
creek, a low granite outcrop with at least six grinding features is exposed. These have mostly eroded
away leaving rough, bowl-shaped depression with traces of the original grinding surface. In the creek
channel below the outcrop stands a pool of water, which shows that the site has water even during
drought. This site has the potential to harbor buried deposits, perhaps relating to prehistoric camping
activities, but if they exist they probably lie to the south of the T-267 ROW. Shovel testing within the
ROW failed to find any buried cultural material. The only portion of the site that should be avoided by
vehicular traffic is the granite outcrop with the grinding features, which lies 300 feet west of Structure

417

4/7. The ROW road appears to run on the opposite side of the creek, so there should be no problem
avoiding the outcrop.
Site 3 is located on the east side of Pennington Creek between Structures 7/3 and 7/4. The west edge of
the site is bordered by a small wash 200 feet east of Structure 7/4 and east edge lies 60 feet west of
Structure 7/3. The site contains both prehistoric and historic material. The prehistoric component is
classified as a lithic scatter composed of chert chipping debris and stone tools. The historic component
includes a tight grouping of rocks, mostly flattish boulders, that may have been the foundations to a
building. Historic artifacts include cast iron fragments, most being from farm machinery, wire nails, and
two whiteware sherds. Lack of bottle glass and other domestic material apart from the small amount of
whiteware suggests that the structure was a barn or other outbuilding to a house site located outside the
ROW. The 1909 USGS topographic map shows a structure in the general area of this site. Presumably,
the rock rubble is the remains of that structure or a building associated with that structure. Although in
existence in 1909, the original building date of the structure is unknown. No artifacts were seen that
definitely predate the 20th century but their presence cannot be ruled out and the site’s SAL eligibility
remains undetermined. The area is generally clear of woody vegetation so no major clearing will be need
around the site. The foundation rubble is hard to see because of the tall grass, but is located on the north
edge of the ROW 250 feet west of Structure 7/3. Since the significance of the historic component is
unknown, maintenance vehicles should avoid the possible foundation stones. The ROW truck path runs
to the south of the feature so maintenance vehicles should have no need to remove it or push it aside.
Site 4 is another food processing locale/lithic scatter situated on both sides of an unnamed intermittent
tributary that enters the Llano River 2000 feet upstream from Waters Creek. The site occupies the entire
T-267 corridor between Structures 10/3 and 10/4. Within the road cut on the west side of the creek, four
manos (grinding stones) and a metate (grinding slab) were found within 20 feet of the crossing. The
cultural material, which includes chipping debris, extends eastwards from Structure 10/4 up to the edge of
the creek bank. The roadcut profile shows that the soil close to the creek is at least one meter thick.
Cultural material appears to more extensive on the east side of the creek, continuing eastwards up to the
high ground where Structure 10/3 is located. The cultural material on this side of the creek includes a
grinding stone, stone tools, and chipping debris. Although there are granite outcrops on the east side of
the creek, they show no evidence of grinding features and apparently food processing was done on
“portable” equipment perhaps cached at the site. The density of grinding equipment in the west roadcut
suggests that such a cache existed at that spot and others could also be buried in the creek side sediments.
The road cut is about 14 feet wide, which should be sufficient for vehicles and equipment, but if any
widening is needed then Archeology Services will have to revisit the site for further investigation.
Archeology Services staff would also have to investigate the east bank before any modification is done
there as well. The sensitive area of Site 4 extends eastwards from Structure 10/4 for a distance of 300
feet. Any clearing within this area will have to done by hand or with machinery that cuts vegetation
above the ground surface.
Site 5 is a prehistoric campsite located 1100 feet east of Site 4 between Structure 10/1 and the Llano
River. The same creek that runs through Site 4 also runs through Site 5 before entering the river. The site
area is fairly elevated above the river and the incised creek channel. Most of the cultural material at this
site, which includes chipping debris, stone tools, mussel shell, and burned rock, is buried in deep sandy
sediments. Many of the artifacts were seen in animal burrow backdirt but a large granite metate was seen
on the surface. A shovel test encountered a possible stone hearth at a depth of 12 inches. Since the site
area lies east of Structure 10/1, the last tower before the line crosses the river, the only possible impacts
would come mainly from brush clearing. However, the area could be used as a turnaround for vehicles
because it is open and the corridor road runs into it. Such use of this area should be avoided if the ground
is wet since rutting could damage the buried features. The sensitive area lies from the east side of
Structure 10/1 eastwards to the river. No subsurface disturbances should occur within this area.
418

Site 6 is a buried lithic scatter located near the headwaters of the same creek on which Sites 4 and 5 are
located. The site area lies between Structure 13/2 and the creek to the west. This area is relatively open
and covered by deep sandy soil. One piece of chipping debris was found on the surface and two burned
pieces of chipping debris were found in the upper foot of soil in a shovel test. A second shovel test placed
in a brushy area east of Structure 13/2 recovered no artifacts in the thin rocky soil. The soil between the
structure and the creek could possibly contain burned prehistoric cultural material related to camping
activities since burned chipping debris was recovered in the shovel test. This area should avoided by
heavy vehicles during wet weather and all clearing done in ways that do not cause subsurface
disturbances. The brush east of Structure 13/2 can be cleared by machinery since it lies beyond the site
area. The creek crossing for the access road lies further upstream outside the T-267 ROW and can be
modified if needed without further oversight by Archeology Services since no archeological material was
found there.
Site 7 is a prehistoric mixed-use site located on the east bank of the Llano River across from Site 5. The
east edge of the site lies 15 meters east of Structure 9/8 and west edge is 60 meters west of the same
structure. The site contains evidence of use as a procurement locale for chert, freshwater mussel cooking,
and food processing. The density of flint chipping debris is higher at this site than all the all other sites
recorded during the T-267 survey. Still, there does not appear to be any buried deposits because of the
thin soil cover. The only area with possible buried deposits lies between the structure and the access road,
about 30 meters in length. A shovel test encountered very hard silty soil and was only dug to a depth of
six inches. One small flint chip was recovered near the surface. Because this area is open and covered by
firm soil, the upcoming enhancement should not affect any buried cultural deposits should they be
present.
The only stretch of T-267 with a high probability for archeological sites that was not surveyed lies
between the Llano River and Structure 14/5. No bank modification will be needed since the access road
does not cross the river, but any clearing in this area will have to be done in ways that do not cause
subsurface disturbances.
The stream crossings surveyed by Archeology Services staff , starting at the east end of the transmission
line, were those between: Structures 5/5 and 5/9 (French John Creek), 5/6 and 5/7 (unnamed creek), 5/8
and 6/2 (Sandy Creek), 6/5 and 6/7 (unnamed creeks), 7/3 and 7/5 (Pennington Creek), 7/7 and 7/8
(unnamed creek), 8/1 and 8/2 (unnamed creek), 9/1 and 9/2 (unnamed creek), 9/3 and 9/5 (three unnamed
drainages close together), and 9/8 and the Llano River (unnamed creek), the Llano River and 10/6 (three
crossings of the same unnamed creek), 13/2 and 13/3 (unnamed creek), 14/4 and the Llano River, 17/6
and 17/7 (unnamed creek), 17/8 and 17/9 (Buttery Creek), and 17/14 and 17/15 (unnamed creek).
To reiterate, seven archeological sites were recorded during the survey. All are prehistoric sites with the
exception of Site 3 which has evidence of both prehistoric and historic occupations. Sites 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6
have potentially significant archeological deposits or features within the T-267 ROW and their locations
along with special restrictions are listed below:




Site 2: Avoid grinding features in low granite outcrop located 300 feet west of STR 4/7 on south
side of French John Creek. Use existing truck path in ROW.
Site 3: Avoid stone rubble located on north edge of ROW 250 feet west of STR 7/3. Use
existing truck path that runs below center line.
Site 4: Avoid below ground disturbances from STR 10/4 eastwards for a distance of 300 feet.
Heavy vehicles should stay on existing ROW road. Use Seppi Mulcher or hand-operated
machinery to cut vegetation.

419




Site 5: Avoid subsurface disturbances in area between STR10/1 and the Llano River. Use Seppi
Mulcher or hand-operated machinery to cut vegetation. Heavy vehicles should avoid area if
ground is wet.
Site 6: Avoid subsurface disturbances from STR 13/2 westwards to the creek, a distance of about
200 feet. Avoid driving over area with heavy vehicles if ground is wet – there are no existing
roads across site. Existing access road crosses creek outside ROW at a location where there are
no archeological sites.

Project 67.10 Runge Equipment Laydown Area for T-541 Upgrade
(Figure 194)
County(s):

Karnes

Type of Investigation:

File search

Date of Investigation:

December 2010

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Cultural Resource Services staff has completed a cultural
resource assessment for the proposed Runge area equipment laydown tract for the T-541 Upgrade Project.
This proposed equipment laydown area is located about 0.77 miles south-southwest of Runge, Texas as
measured from the intersection of State Highways 72 and 81 in the downtown portion of the City (see
map attachment). The laydown area is also situated about 0.56 miles southwest of the intersection of FM
885 and State Highway 81. The laydown area is a 1.5-acre sized tract that is located immediately
southeast of FM 885.
A file search showed that there are no previously recorded archaeological sites within the equipment
laydown area, and that the area had not ever been investigated by professional archaeologists. The
laydown yard area was assessed as having a moderate probability for unrecorded historic cultural resource
sites because it is located adjacent to a road. For this reason, a cultural resource field survey of the entire
1.5-acre tract was undertaken by the LCRA Cultural Resource Services staff on December 9, 2010.
A pedestrian survey was conducted by a three-person team that walked 30 meter wide transects across the
laydown area. Ground surface visibility was very good because the tract is a recently plowed field.
Within the northeast quadrant of the tract, a number of historic period artifacts were found on ground
surface. These consisted of about 15 pieces of plain ceramic whiteware sherds, 10 pieces of solarized
(purple) glass, 10 pieces of brown glass, and 1 flat, clear glass fragment. No metal or any other artifact
classes were seen, nor were any evidences of the foundations of any former house or other type of
structure seen. Given the low artifact counts and the low probability that any prehistoric materials could
be present, no shovel tests were excavated. Elsewhere, no artifacts were found on the surface of the
plowed field.
Following the fieldwork, a copy of the 1909 Kenedy, Texas USGS map was examined to determine if the
location of the historic artifacts corresponded with the location of any mapped house structure. None was
located on that map, nor was any such house structure depicted at that location on the 1960s era Runge,
Texas 7.5’ USGS map.
Based on the lack of evidence of any former house having been located where the artifacts were found, it
appears that the artifacts represent a 20th century trash dump scatter. Recent guidance from the Texas
Historical Commission (THC) indicates that 20th century trash scatters not associated with structures do
not need to be recorded as archaeological sites. Given that fact, it does not appear that any cultural
resource sites that may be eligible for formal designation as State Archeological Landmarks are present in
the proposed Runge Equipment Laydown Area.
The proposed use of the 1.5 acre tract for the laydown and storage of equipment for the T-541 upgrade
project may proceed at this time without any further cultural resource investigations. Since the area
investigated was less than five acres in size, a report does not have to be sent to the THC at this time for a
30-day review/comment period. Instead, as per our Memorandum of Understanding with the THC, the

422

results of this investigation will be reported in the LCRA’s Annual Report of Cultural Resource
Investigations for Calendar Year 2010 next April.

(Figure 195)
County(s):

Gonzales, Karnes

Type of Investigation:

Field survey

Date of Investigation:

December 2010

LCRA TSC is in the process of upgrading the recently acquired T-541 transmission line in DeWitt and
Karnes counties, Texas. The project includes the replacement of existing structures by way of extracting
the existing poles and replacing them with new poles using the same holes. The new structures will be
somewhat larger than the existing ones, which will require slight enlargement of the existing foundations.
Although direct pole replacement is excluded from cultural resource review per LCRA’s Memorandum of
Agreement (MOA) with the Texas Historical Commission, the line crosses previously recorded
prehistoric archaeological site 41DW6, which was reported with potentially significant surface materials.
A cultural resources assessment of the portion of the mapped site crossed by the transmission line was
therefore considered prudent. Site 41DW6 is mapped just southwest of Cuero and immediately east of
US 87. This site was recorded in 1967 and was described as a surface scatter of Late Archaic and Late
Prehistoric-aged materials along with burned rock and mussel shell across a large upland bluff
overlooking the Guadalupe River. The site plotting was reported as approximate.
Cultural resource investigations were conducted by LCRA staff on December 9, 2010. Eight shovel tests
were excavated at structure locations that were not already heavily impacted by construction of a large
stock tank near the site center (STRs 507-517 – old STR numbers). These tests showed sands across the
top of the lobe and loams and clays along its flanks. Subsoils were encountered at depths of 30-60 cm.
Shovel Test 6, located in sand near the site center, had two flake fragments in the upper 20 cm. Shovel
Test 7, located outside the mapped boundary of the site in apparent redistributed clayey matrix, had two
flakes and three mussel umbos in the upper 20 cm, with small amount of mussel shell fragments at depths
to 60 cm. Six additional shovel tests were negative for cultural material. Visibility was fair to excellent
and a number of rodent burrows were present, as well as excellent exposure in the area of the stock tank.
No additional artifacts were seen. The portion of 41DW6 crossed by the transmission line is felt to be
fully investigated and shows no indication of being eligible for formal listing as a State Archeological
Landmark.
Because the project consists of direct pole replacement, no correspondence with THC is necessary at this
time. Instead, this project will be summarized and reported in LCRA’s Annual Report of Cultural
resource Investigations for 2010.

Project 70.10 T-106 Buchanan Dam to Buchanan CTEC Enhancement
(Figure 196)
County(s):

Llano

Type of Investigation:

Field survey

Date of Investigation:

December 2010

The LCRA’s Archeology Services staff has completed its assessment of the T-106 Transmission Line that
runs between the LCRA’s Buchanan Dam Substation and the Central Texas Electric Co-Op’s Buchanan
Substation. T-106 is scheduled for enhancement operations early in 2011, which can involve brush
clearing using heavy machinery and carving ramps into stream banks for vehicle crossings. A file search
by Archeology Services staff found that only one short section of the corridor between Structures 137A
and 1 /4 at the east end of the line had been previously surveyed for cultural resources. This survey was
done for a brush clearing project during which no archeological sites were located within the transmission
line ROW.
Because the rest of T-106 had not been investigated for cultural resources, Archeology Services
conducted a field survey on December 15, 2010. The survey was restricted to stream crossings since
these areas have an especially high potential for prehistoric archeological sites, which could be damaged
should stream bank modification be necessary. The survey proceeded eastwards down the T-106 corridor
starting from the Buchanan CTEC. The line mostly runs along the north side of Long Mountain, a large
ridge composed of Paleozoic sedimentary rock, crossing the summits of smaller side ridges and
descending down into the narrow valleys of the small creeks that run perpendicular to the main ridge.
The crossings that were surveyed on December 15 lie between Structures 1/6 and 1/7, 2/1 and 2/2, 2/4 and
2/5, 2/9 and 3/1, and 3/3 and 3 /4. During the survey, two new archeological sites were recorded, both
representing specialized activity areas or perhaps the outer edges of habitation sites.
Site 1 is a prehistoric scatter of flint chipping debris and stone tools located on the west side of a creek on
the toe slope of Long Mountain between Structures 2/1 and 2/2. Artifact counts are unexpectedly high for
an area with no nearby flint sources and no reliable water. Soils in the area are shallow and rocky, having
developed on material that eroded from the escarpment. A projectile point found at the site probably
belongs to the latter part of the Early Archaic period, about 4500 BC. The deposits within the ROW
appear to be confined to the surface and deep soils are not present in the immediate area. Since no
features such as hearths are present in the T-106 corridor and the cultural deposits confined to the surface,
the site does not appear to be eligible for State Archeological Landmark (SAL) status.
Site 2 is another lithic scatter also located on the toe slope of Long Mountain on the south side of a small
creek 3000 feet northeast of Site 1 between Structures 1/6 and 1/7. A utility line that intersects T-106
crosses the site as well. Little vegetation has survived over the site because of the two dirt roads that
cross over the site and because of the trampling by cattle that congregate at the spot. The site consists of
three artifacts: a side scraper, a biface with a beveled edge, and a large secondary flake. All three artifacts
are rather large and heavy. Lack of vegetation provided very good ground visibility and all surface
artifacts within the ROW were probably accounted for during the survey. Thin soil cover precludes the
presence of much buried cultural material. The access road has cut down into the deeper soil along the
creek, exposing no cultural material. This site is probably not eligible for SAL status because of the low
artifact density and lack of buried deposits.

427

To summarize, all previously unsurveyed creek crossings on the T-106 were inspected, during which two
new archeological sites were recorded. Neither site appears to meet the requirements for SAL eligibility
and therefore they do not need to be avoided during the upcoming enhancement project. No
archeological sites are present at the other stream crossings and the enhancement project can proceed
without further oversight by Archeology Services.

(Figure 197)
County(s):

Type of Investigation:

File search

Date of Investigation:

August 2010

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Archaeology Services staff has completed a cultural
resources desktop review for the proposed FY10 maintenance work on Transmission Line T-539. This
transmission line extends for a distance of 2.1 miles from the AEP Nixon Substation to the LCRA Nixon
Substation, Texas.
A file search showed that the only portion of the T-539 right-of-way (ROW) corridor that has been
previously surveyed for cultural resource sites is a small area in the north-central part of the corridor
where the line intersects with T-425. Importantly, at the intersection of these two transmission lines, a
prehistoric lithic scatter designated as 41GZ204 was recorded and assessed for the proposed rebuilding of
a portion of T-425 (Nash and Taylor 1995). Site 41GZ204 was described as a very sparse scatter of chert
and quartzite flakes that was located within a plowed field. Shovel testing indicated that no buried
artifacts were present, and the site was assessed as not eligible for formal designation as a State
Archeological Landmark. No further investigation of site 41GZ204 is recommended for the current T539 maintenance project.
Aside from 41GZ204, a review of topographic maps suggests that is one area of concern where
unrecorded archaeological sites could be impacted by maintenance work. That area extends from about
170 feet northeast of STR #188A to the location of STR #188B. Within this area ground disturbance
should be minimized. In particular, there should be no modifications to existing creek banks, and any
vegetation clearing (especially tree removal) should be done without root disturbance (i. e. no
bulldozing). If this area cannot be avoided, Archaeology Services should be contacted at ext. 6714 two
weeks prior to the proposed disturbance so that a field assessment can be conducted. If the assessment
indicates that potentially significant archaeological sites are present, then additional testing and/or
mitigation may be necessary prior to disturbance.
Aside from the special conditions relating to the one area described above, the proposed maintenance
work on the T-539 line may proceed. However, standard emergency discovery provisions are always
applicable. Should the personnel conducting the work uncover any presently unknown buried
archaeological materials during construction, then work should cease in the immediate area of the
discovery and the LCRA Archaeology Services staff should be contacted.

Part 3. Letters to THC Requesting Clearance through File Searches
In 12 cases, letters were sent to the THC. Ten of these made the statement that LCRA felt no survey was
necessary while two letters recommended monitoring of the construction in potentially sensitive areas. In
all of these instances but one (Project No. 68.10), THC agreed. For Project No. 68.10, the Gulf Coast
Irrigation District Check Structures, the THC recommended that the construction be monitored. The two
projects that the LCRA recommended for monitoring were Project No. 4.10 (the Colorado Room
demolition) and Project No. 34.10 (New Office Bldg at LCRA Service Center). The former was
monitored in calendar year 2010 and is reported in this volume (Project 73.10), while the latter will be
monitored in calendar year 2011.

Project 4.10 Colorado Room Demolition
(Figure 198)
County(s):

Travis

Type of Investigation:

File search

Date of Investigation:

January 2010

LCRA proposes to demolish an existing structure at the LCRA’s General Office Complex (GOC) located
near Tom Miller Dam in Travis County, Texas. The building is presently known as the Colorado Room
and was previously known as the Lakeview Café prior to acquisition by LCRA in about 1993. The
building is owned by LCRA and sits on land leased from the University of Texas.
The GOC grounds (excepting the Colorado Room) were previously investigated by Espey Huston and
Associates in 1986 and by LCRA archaeologists in 1991. Two archaeological sites, 41TV1588, a lithic
scatter associated with stone tool acquisition, and 41TV1599, an historic trash dump within a nearby
sinkhole were recorded during the later investigations. Neither site was felt to be eligible for formal
listing as a State Archeological Landmark, although the trash dump may have been considered significant
if it had not been in secondary context. Site 41TV1588 borders the present project area on the north, and
probably extends into the present project area, which was not surveyed because it was not under LCRA
control at the time.
Records indicate that the Colorado Room may have elements that date back to original construction in
about 1895. It is listed a domestic residence in 1921, but may have been moved sometime after 1916. In
1950 it began operating as Shorty’s Lake View Inn, before becoming the Lakeview Café in 1981. Major
additions and renovations occurred in 1981 and 1984, and probably earlier.
LCRA Archaeology Services conducted a reconnaissance of the project area on February 23, 2007, prior
to earlier-proposed remodeling activities. The majority of the project area appears to have been heavily
impacted by previous construction activities, and rests essentially on limestone bedrock. Regardless,
LCRA proposes to conduct monitoring of ground disturbing activities in order to determine if additional
information can be gained on historic or prehistoric activities in the area, especially in regards to
previously recorded site 41TV1588.
The building is not subject to provisions of the State Antiquities Code, as it is not listed on the National
Register of Historic Places, and is not subject to Section 106 review, as there is no Federal funding.
However, LCRA proposes to conduct spot monitoring of demolition activities of the Colorado Room,
since it may provide additional information regarding the historic use of the Brackenridge tract.
A similar letter to your office, in regards to the previously proposed remodeling activities and dated
February 28, 2007, received concurrence from your office on March 22 of that year.
LCRA Archaeology Services requests concurrence with these recommendations. The results of
monitoring activities will be summarized in the appropriate annual report of investigations.

Project 9.10 Gillespie Electrical Substation Power Transformer Addition
(Figure 199 through Figure 204)
County(s):

Gillespie

Type of Investigation:

File search

Date of Investigation:

February 2010

The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) and the Central Texas Electrical Cooperative (CTEC) are
proposing to install a new power transformer within the grounds of LCRA’s existing Gillespie Substation,
which is situated approximately 1.75 miles northwest of the City of Fredericksburg in Gillespie County,
Texas (Figure 199). Since the project does not include any federal funding or permitting, the cultural
resource review is being conducted only for compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas.
The new 138-26 kV 14 MVA power transformer will be placed in the southwestern part of the substation
(Figure 200 through Figure 202). The proposed project will also involve the installation of metering
packages and the erection of several new transmission poles within the same portion of the substation
property.
A file search conducted by the LCRA Archaeology Services staff showed the original Gillespie
Substation construction project was not surveyed for cultural resources because its construction predated
the enactment of the Texas State Antiquities Code. However, several subsequent cultural resource
surveys for projects located on LCRA land just outside the boundaries of the substation fence have
indicated that a diffuse, heavily disturbed superficial prehistoric lithic scatter, 41GL279, extends around
the north, west, and south sides of the substation boundary (Figure 203). These subsequent survey
projects consist of Espey, Huston and Associates’ (1994) survey for a new transmission line that tied into
the substation, and LCRA’s surveys for a drainage ditch around the east and south sides of the substation
(Hixson 2005) and a northward expansion of the substation ( Hixson 2009). In each case, these surveys
have concluded that the portions of site 41GL279 that were investigated are not eligible for formal
designation as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL).
In particular, the LCRA’s previous investigations for the drainage ditch that wrapped around the original
substation and the investigation for the northern expansion of the substation documented the fact that
ground surface was heavily modified during the original substation construction. The LCRA’s shovel
tests and field observations for these projects indicated that the shallow upland topsoil had been removed
down to limestone bedrock in some areas and down into the B and/or C horizons of the Krum soils in all
other areas in order to create a flat surface for the substation, especially around the east side of the
substation (Figure 204).
Given the degree of previous disturbances, it is doubtful that any intact parts of site 41GL279 are still
present within the substation boundaries. The LCRA Archaeology Services staff concludes that a field
survey is not needed, and that the proposed construction associated with the power transformer project
does not have the potential to affect any cultural resource sites that are eligible for formal designation as
SALs.
We request your concurrence with our assessment and recommendations with the understanding that
standard emergency discovery provisions are applicable. If you need any additional information, contact
me at 397-6714.

Project 14.10 Buchanan Dam Generator Platforms
(Figure 205 through Figure 212)
County(s):

Burnet and Llano

Type of Investigation:

File search

Date of Investigation:

March 2010

As part of an ongoing floodgate maintenance project at Buchanan Dam in Llano and Burnet Counties
(Figure 205), LCRA proposes to erect a platform that will house a backup generator and associated
controls on the downstream side of the dam. The generator is designed to allow operation of adjacent
floodgates should other power sources be lost. Buchanan Dam has three sets of gates; a seven gate
section immediately north of the primary dam, a thirteen gate section about 2500 feet to the northeast, and
lastly, a sixteen gate section about 1600 feet northeast of there, or about 1000 feet southwest of northeast
end of the dam. The new platform will be located just to the southwest of the sixteen gate section, and
will be an almost exact replica of an existing platform and generator presently located just to the
southwest of the thirteen gate section (Figure 206 through Figure 208).
The existing platform is approximately 40 feet long and 16 feet wide, and and rests flush with the upper
walkway of the dam. A series of iron supports anchor the platform to the dam structure. A handrail
encircles the platform and ties in to existing railing along the walkway (Figure 209 through Figure 212).
The proposed location for the new platform is nearly identical in appearance, although it lacks the vertical
column structure, (a cable trace/conduit system) present at the thirteen gate section, and therefore the
longer support legs would extend across the entirety of the platform, as opposed to the shorter legs seen
under the existing control room.
Although there is no federal (U. S. Army Corps of Engineers) permitting involved with this portion of the
project, Buchanan Dam has been determined eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic
Places, and previous correspondence with your office indicates that all phases of the gate maintenance
project must be submitted for review and approval. Therefore, LCRA requests your comments and
approval for this portion of the project.
If you need additional information please feel free to contact me at (512) 473-3200 Ext. 2753.

Service Center
(Figure 213 through Figure 215)
County(s):

Travis

Type of Investigation:

File search

Date of Investigation:

August 2010

The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) is proposing to construct a new set of improvements at its
existing Dalchau Service Center (DSC) complex which is located in the southeastern part of the City of
Austin, Travis County, Texas. The project is being constructed on land owned by LCRA and, therefore, a
cultural resource review for compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas is required. Since there is no
federal funding or permitting involved in this project, a federal Section 106 review under the National
Historic Preservation Act is not required.
The principal improvement will be the construction of a new office building and associated parking lot on
approximately 4.9 acres of land immediately east of Montopolis Drive and south of the LCRA’s existing
DSC Building A at the southwest corner of the DSC complex (Figure 213 and Figure 214). The western
part of this proposed construction area is vacant land while the eastern part is currently a gravel-covered
parking lot.
An associated project element will involve the construction of approximately 4,230 linear feet storm
water pipeline that will extend from the new building area eastward through an area previously disturbed
by road construction and then northward through areas previously disturbed by construction of two
detention ponds before terminating at Carson Creek which is located just south of Ben White Blvd. The
storm water pipeline will vary from 36 to 48 inches in diameter. The total depth of excavation for this
pipeline will range from 6 to 16 feet below ground surface. As a part of the storm water drainage plan,
some maintenance work and improvement of the contours of the walls of the two detention ponds will
take place in previously disturbed areas.
Additionally, a 6-inch diameter wastewater line will also be placed underground for a length of about
2,500 linear feet adjacent to a portion of the storm water pipeline that extends from the new building area
to the first detention pond. Within this area, two other shorter segments of storm water pipeline of 1,000
and 500 foot lengths will also be placed adjacent to the main wastewater line and storm water line to aid
in draining other existing portions of the DSC building complex. Last of all, a 500 foot line section of 8inch diameter pipeline will be placed below ground and extend from the area east of LCRA’s gas station
south and southeastward to the south edge of the southern detention pond.
A file search showed that there is one previously recorded cultural resource site, 41TV1951, within the
project area. Site 41TV1951 is situated on a terrace south of Carson Creek at the north
end of the project (see Figure 213 through Figure 215). The site is located immediately north and east of
a former gravel pit which has now been converted into one of the detention ponds. This site was recorded
by the LCRA Cultural Resource staff in 2001 for a previous expansion of the northeastern part of the
DSC complex.
Site 41TV1951 is a multi-component site consisting of a prehistoric campsite and a historic artifact
scatter. Both components appear to be associated with a large spring that issues from the terrace slope on
the east edge of the LCRA property line. The prehistoric component, which is outlined in blue on Figures
1 and 2, was assessed by the LCRA as potentially eligible for formal designation as a State Archeological
448

Landmark (SAL). The historic component, which covers a larger horizontal area outlined in red on
Figure 213 and Figure 214, represents an early to mid 20th century farmstead that had been severely
damaged by gravel mining prior to the LCRA’s ownership. Aerial photographs indicate that the house
and other outbuildings that once stood on the site were removed by the mining. The historic component
was assessed as not eligible for formal designation as an SAL by the LCRA. On October 4, 2001, the
Archeology Division at the Texas Historical Commission concurred with the LCRA’s assessments of the
prehistoric and historic components.
The proposed storm water pipeline will pass through the portion of site 41TV1951 where historic artifacts
displaced by gravel mining are present. The storm water pipeline will be placed about 30 meters (100
feet) west of the west edge of the potentially significant prehistoric component (Figure 215). The LCRA
Cultural Resource staff recommends that the proposed storm water pipeline construction be allowed to
proceed in the vicinity of the prehistoric component of 41TV1951 with the understanding the LCRA
Cultural Resource will monitor the excavation of the pipeline trench in that area. Also, it should be noted
that a chain link fence was previously constructed along the top edges of the detention pond adjacent to
41TV1951. That chain link fence should ensure that any maintenance work on the detention pond will
not extend into areas containing site 41TV1951’s intact prehistoric deposits.
Elsewhere, the LCRA Cultural Resource staff assesses all other proposed construction areas to have a low
probability for any unrecorded prehistoric sites. To determine the likelihood that any historic period
cultural resource sites could be present in these construction areas, the 1910 Austin, Texas 15’ USGS
map, the 1955 Montopolis, Texas 15’ USGS map, the 1988 Montopolis, Texas 7.5’ USGS map, and the
1936 and 1952 Travis County Highway maps were examined. The review showed that no historic
structures were ever present in proposed construction areas. Therefore, aside from the monitoring of
pipeline construction at site 41TV1951, the LCRA does not feel that further cultural resource
investigation of any other portions of the project area is warranted. As always, standard emergency
discovery provisions will be applicable.
The LCRA requests your concurrence with its assessments and recommendations for the project. If you
have any questions or comments, please contact me at 397-6714.

Date of Investigation:

September 2010

The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) is in the phased process of upgrading and repairing the
floodgate system of its Buchanan Dam facility located in Burnet and Llano counties (Figure 216).
Buchanan Dam was completed in 1937 and forms the Lake Buchanan reservoir on the Colorado River.
Buchanan Dam has been determined eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places.
Buchanan Dam has three primary gate systems, referred to as the 16 gate, the 14 gate, and the 7 gate
sections (Figure 217). It has been determined that these gates, although in good condition, do not meet
current engineering standards and should be upgraded. The current phase of the project involves adding
an elevated rail (monorail) to the gate sections. The monorail will manage dewatering devices, referred to
as stop logs, which can be maneuvered into position in front of each gate in order to allow more frequent
maintenance and also to provide emergency control of reservoir waters in case of a gate malfunction.
Other project elements that will affect the appearance of the dam will be the addition of dedicated hoists
to each gate. These will replace a pair of shared hoists at each section, which presently must be dollied to
individual gates. Each of the total 37 Tainter (radial arm) gates will have a one foot, non-sealed extension
added to the top. The steel bracing on each gate will also be replaced using higher quality metal, although
each piece will be replaced largely in kind.
Minor changes will include adding security cameras and inspecting and strengthening the existing hoist
bridges to accommodate the additional weight on each gate. The existing hoists will be automated and
refurbished.
Combined, these improvements will decrease the possibility of catastrophic failure by: allowing more
efficient and timely operation of floodgates; more frequent and regular maintenance of gate components;
by providing additional time to manage floodwaters through the higher gate elevations; and by providing
a means of emergency stoppage of flood water in the case of gate failure.
As part of the engineering and planning process, LCRA commissioned conceptual images of the changes
to the dam. These are attached as draft figures 4-8 and reference the 7 gate and 16 gate sections. The 14
gate section will be identical in appearance to the 16 gate section. The rail systems above each gate
section will be fourteen feet in height. The new and refurbished hoists, stop logs, and stop log dolly are
visible nested within the rails, and are all identified in Figure 219. The 7 gate downstream figure (Figure
8) also shows the Tainter gates with the one foot extension on the top of each. The changes are
highlighted in a blue or green color. The proposed color of the modifications to the dam will be closer to
the blue.
Although no federal permitting or funding is involved with the current phase of the project, this portion of
the project is being submitted for review and comment as discussed in previous correspondence with your
office (letter from Caroline Wright to LCRA archaeologist Daniel J. Prikryl dated July 23, 2009). There
is no known need for formal review under the Antiquities Code of Texas.

T. C. Ferguson Power Plant property in Llano County, Texas. A cultural resource review to meet the
requirements of LCRA’s Memorandum of Understanding with the Texas Historical Commission is
required since LCRA owns the land on which the new plant will be constructed. Additionally, because
the proposed project will need a Federal Operations Permit from the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) and is subject to a New Source Air Permit Review by EPA/Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality (TCEQ), a review to meet the Section 106 requirements of the National Historic Preservation Act
is needed.
The new power plant will replace the existing power plant that was constructed in the early 1970s. The
new power plant will be constructed in the area immediately west of the existing plant and east of the
fuel oil storage area (Figure 224 and Figure 225). The new power plant construction area is bounded on
the north by the intake structure and associated channel and on the south by the discharge channel. The
construction area will cover an area measuring about 145 meters on a north-south line by 200 meters on
an east-west line.
Other project components include two equipment laydown areas and the construction of a gas
compression building and a temporary road (see Figure 225). One of the equipment laydown areas will
be situated in and around the area of the previously mentioned fuel oil storage area immediately west of
the new plant site. Prior to the use of this area for equipment laydown, the three existing fuel oil tanks
will be dismantled and removed. Additionally, a small gas compression building will be constructed at
the north end of this laydown area. The second equipment laydown area is a triangular area that is located
further southward in the area south of the LCRA’s existing electrical substation at the Ferguson property.
In all, the two equipment laydown areas total about 29.9 acres. The temporary construction road will be
located east of the existing main power plant road and it will connect the two equipment laydown areas
(see Figure 225). It will have a length of approximately 256 meters.
A file search showed that there are no previously recorded cultural resource sites within the original and
new proposed power plant project areas. A literature review also indicated that the original Ferguson
Power Plant was constructed between 1970 and 1974, a time frame that slightly predates the era during
which LCRA first began to coordinate state and federal level cultural resource reviews for its construction
projects with the Texas Historical Commission (THC).
The file search also suggested that the immediate new power plant construction area would have
originally had a moderate probability for prehistoric sites since it is situated adjacent to the head of a
small tributary creek. Since all other affected areas consisting of the equipment laydown areas and the
temporary construction access road are located further westward away from the tributary creek, they
would have had a low probability for prehistoric sites. To assess the potential for historic period sites at
the project area, a review of old USGS topographic maps was undertaken. Maps that were examined
consist of the 1909 Burnet, Texas 30’ USGS map, the 1931 Marble Falls, Texas 15’ USGS map, and the
later-dating 1967 Marble Falls, Texas and Dunman Mountain, Texas 7.5’ USGS maps. These maps did
463

not show any evidences of former structures within the construction area, the two laydown areas, or the
temporary construction road area.
The construction of the original power plant involved massive earth moving activities over a large area.
To determine if there is any potential that intact cultural resource sites might still be present in the one
moderate probability area, the LCRA Archives photograph collection for the original power plant
construction was examined. The photograph collection consists of numerous photographs that were taken
over the entire construction period beginning in September 1970 and continuing through the completion
of the construction in June 1974. Additionally, a plan view drawing showing previous construction
within the currently proposed new power plant site was provided by LCRA Wholesale Services
Engineering staff (Figure 226).
The review of photographs and previously mentioned construction drawing showed that early in the
construction process in November 1970, a large trench called the Condenser Pit was excavated within the
southeastern part of the new power plant area. This pit was approximately 125 feet wide and was
excavated down through granite bedrock to a depth of 30 feet (Figure 227 and Figure 228). Figure 5 also
shows that beyond the edges of this Condenser Pit the land surface had also been cleared and graded. By
early December 1970, an approximately 20 foot high backdirt pile from the excavation of the Condenser
Pit existed between the south side of the pit and the north side of the future discharge channel (Figure
229). This backdirt pile must have later been used to backfill the Condenser Pit and it is probable that the
creation and removal of this backdirt pile caused further damage to the original soil deposits in the
southeast part of the currently proposed construction site.
Figure 230, which provides an aerial view looking southeastward at the original power plant construction
area dated March 3, 1971, shows that by that date construction had greatly progressed. In the proposed
power plant replacement area, the condenser pit appears to have been mostly backfilled although there are
several linear rows of raised backdirt piles of dirt and/or blocks of granite bedrock within the area of
interest. Additionally, a large dirt road appears to cut diagonally across the central and northwest portions
of the power plant replacement area.
Approximately two years later, construction had further proceeded and the proposed power plant
replacement area had been leveled for usage as an equipment laydown area (Figure 231) and as the site
for temporary buildings (Figure 232). The oil tanks in the background of these two photographs are still
present and serve as reference points indicating that the equipment laydown yard and temporary building
covered the entire new power plant area.
Overall, the sequence of photographs verify the fact that the proposed new power plant construction area
was thoroughly disturbed during the construction of the original power plant to the extent that any cultural
resource sites that would have been present were essentially destroyed. Figures 8 and 9 also show that the
currently proposed equipment laydown area where the oil tanks are located was also heavily disturbed.
An additional photograph, Figure 10, shows that that a sizeable portion of the southern equipment
laydown area was also previously disturbed. Overall, the LCRA Cultural Resource staff does not feel that
there is any potential for any cultural resource sites that may be eligible or potentially eligible for
National Register or State Archeological Landmark listing to still be present. Therefore, the LCRA
Cultural Resource staff does not feel that a cultural resource field survey is warranted.
In addition to an assessment of ground-disturbing activities, the file search included a review of maps,
aerial photographs, and relevant literature to determine if the replacement project would have any visual
impacts to any structures that are eligible or potentially eligible for listing within the National Register of
Historic Places. The review indicated that a house structure is shown on the 1909 Burnet, Texas 30’
USGS map at a location about 0.35 miles west of the project area. Otherwise, there are no other houses
464

mapped anywhere in the vicinity of the project area. However, the 1931 Marble Falls, Texas 15’ USGS
map does not show a structure at the 1909 map location, and a review of modern aerial photographs
provided no indication that this structure is still present. The only other structure anywhere in the vicinity
of the project area on the 1931 Marble Falls map is a house that is situated about 0.7 mile northwest of
the project area at an elevation that is now 15 feet under the conservation pool level of Lake LBJ.
Review of the later-dating 1967 Marble Falls, Texas and Dunman Mountain, Texas 7.5’ USGS maps
showed that the only house structures within one-half mile of the project area are four structures located
north-northwest of the project area within previously recorded archaeological sites 41LL357 and
41LL358. These structures were previously described and assessed in LCRA archaeologist Bruce
Nightengale’s report of the LCRA Baird Tract in 1994. The three structures at site 41LL357 were
determined to be the Baird ranchhouse and two cabins that had been moved into site 41LL357from other
locations. The Baird ranchhouse is a 1940s era structure that was originally located downslope near
Pecan Creek in an area now inundated by the lake. After its move, the ranchhouse was extensively
renovated. The two cabins were moved to site 41LL357 from the Wirtz Dam area where they had been
used to house engineers during the construction of the dam in 1950. Archival research determined that
the structure at site 41LL358 was the caretaker’s house on the LCRA Baird tract. It had also been moved
in to its current location from elsewhere and had undergone extensive structural modifications. Six other
bunkhouses that once stood north of the caretaker’s house at site 41LL358were also determined to have
been moved in from the Wirtz Dam area. Nightengale assessed all of these structures as not National
Register eligible, due to the combination of impacts that had altered the structural and locational integrity
of these structures. The THC concurred with those assessments on February 11, 1994.
Aerial maps from the era of the construction of the original power plant do not suggest that there are any
other structures in the vicinity of the project area. Overall, the review of maps and aerial photographs
suggests that the general area around the Ferguson Power Plant project area was isolated and sparsely
inhabited until lake houses and suburbs started to be built around the Lake LBJ shoreline in the 1970s and
1980s. Thus, it appears that the construction of the proposed power plant replacement project would not
have visual impacts on any historic structures.
Based on the results of the file search, the LCRA recommends that the proposed construction of the
replacement power plant be allowed to proceed without any further cultural resource investigations. As
always, standard emergency discovery procedures are applicable.
The LCRA requests your concurrence with our assessment and recommendations for the Ferguson Power
Plant Replacement Project. If you have any questions about the draft report, please contact me at 3976714.

(Figure 234 and Figure 235)

County(s):

Ector

Type of Investigation:

File Search

Date of Investigation:

November 2010

LCRA Transmission Services Corporation (LCRA TSC) proposes to construct a new substation
on two acres of land located under an LCRA existing transmission line (T-442) about six miles
south of Odessa in Ector County, Texas (Figures 1 and 2). The substation is required to help with
electrical load increases expected in the region.
Transmission line T-442 was surveyed by Hicks and Company and published in 2002 (Karbula
et. al 2002). The portion of the line containing the proposed substation was designated as
Segment 25 (Karbula et. al Plate 15). No archaeological sites were recorded by Hicks and
Company along this segment. The landscape in this area is notable for numerous small playa
lakes, one of which is located about one mile south of the present project area. Two shovel tests
were excavated by Hicks and Company on this feature.
The present project area is not located on or near a playa. It has been previously surveyed, in
part, and is within an extensive oil lease. All construction and future access will be along existing
oil field roads or transmission line easements, and no construction of new roads will be necessary.
In the opinion of LCRA Cultural Resources Department the potential for there to be previously
undiscovered cultural materials eligible for formal listing as a State Archeological Landmark is
extremely low. LCRA therefore feels that no field investigations are necessary for this project
and requests concurrence from your office.

(Figure 236)

Type of Investigation:

File search

Date of Investigation:

October 2010

The LCRA’s Conservation Services is planning to clear brush and small trees in portions of the
LCRA’s Shaffer Bend Recreation area located on the north shore of Lake Travis in Burnet
County. The clearing will occur in five separate areas within the park, totaling 76 acres (Figure
1).
The LCRA’s Archeology Services has been conducting intermittent inventory surveys within the
park for the past 16 years. In addition, other surveys have been done in house or contracted out
for various fence building and earlier brush clearing projects. These surveys have covered all
areas of the proposed clearing project that have a moderate to high potential for prehistoric sites.
During these surveys, four sites, 41BT68, 41BT70, 41BT177 and 41BT416, were recorded whose
areas overlap portions of the proposed project (Figure 1). All are located on the high Pleistocene
terrace and in some cases extend down onto the floodplain. Until these sites are investigated
further, all should be considered potentially eligible for State Archeological Landmark (SAL)
designation. The sites are described as follows.
41BT68. This is a prehistoric campsite located on the eastern property line of the park
immediately east of where several small drainages unite to create a single channel. This channel
enters Lake Travis 600 meters downstream and appears to flow only after heavy rains. Most of
the site area covers the floodplain adjacent to the creek channel, which has become entrenched in
the alluvium. Lithic artifacts extend upslope onto the high terrace, which is a lithic procurement
area.
41BT70. This is a prehistoric site which, like 41BT68, has both a buried portion on the
floodplain containing camp debris and an adjacent lithic procurement on the high terrace slope.
A dry creek channel borders the west side of the site. Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric points
have been recovered from the site.
41BT177. This site is located in the center the park on the high terrace overlooking the
floodplain. The more visible cultural remains belong to the c. 1900 Abe Hood Farmstead,
including a stone chimney and fireplace, cistern, and root cellar, but there is also a prehistoric
component representing lithic procurement activities buried in the upper zone of the Pleistocene
gravels that cap the terrace surface. Shovel testing on the high terrace has yielded possible Early
Triangular points.
41BT416. This is a lithic procurement site located on a portion of the high terrace that has
eroded into a prominent hill bordered on the east and west by dry creeks. Artifacts consist of
flakes, tested cobbles, and early stage bifaces scattered over the cobbly surface of the hill.

These are the only sites known to extend into the project area. Where they overlap the
proposed clearing areas (see Figure 1), the crew will clear brush by hand or will avoid
these areas entirely. Clearing outside these sites will be done using seppis, hydroaxes, or
480

tree shears, all of which cut vegetation at or above ground surface so that subsurface
deposits are not affected.
Archeology Services is confident that all archeological sites in the portions of the project area that
have a moderate to high potential for prehistoric sites have been recorded during previous
surveys. The only portions of the project area that have not been previously surveyed are located
on rocky uplands in the northern half of the park – areas which have a low probability for
prehistoric sites. Additionally, early USGS maps show no structures in these areas.
Archeology Services recommends that the brush clearing at Shaffer Bend be allowed to proceed
because all moderate to high potential areas affected by this project have been previously
surveyed and known site areas will be avoided or hand cleared. Elsewhere, clearing will take
place in areas with a low probability for sites and will be done using methods that minimize
ground disturbances. I ask for your concurrence on this assessment and recommendation.

Date of Investigation:

November 2010

LCRA proposes to construct an ADA accessible waterless toilet facility at Turkey Bend Park,
located on Lake Travis in Travis and Burnet countries, Texas (Figure 1, 2). It will be a
prefabricated structure placed over a pit that will be excavated to a depth of 8-10 feet and will be
4-6 feet in diameter. A three-car parking area will also be placed at that location, and constructed
of road base placed upon the ground surface.
LCRA Cultural Resources staff has been conducting inventory assessments of Turkey Bend Park
since at least 1996, and before that various brush control and fence projects were reviewed. More
recently, an entry station complex was reviewed by your office and approved for development.
There are presently 67 known archaeological sites, both historic and prehistoric, within the park.
An internal file search and map review of the proposed restroom location indicates there are no
archaeological sites present. Additionally, LCRA Cultural Resources staff knows the area as
within shallow sandy/gravelly soils over limestone and/or reddish clays (Tarrant soils and rock
outcrop, steep; Glen Rose formation). It is deflated and has excellent ground visibility.
Given the small scope of the project and the level of previous investigations, LCRA Cultural
Resources staff feels no additional field investigations are necessary for the project and requests
concurrence from your office. Standard emergency discovery procedures will be communicated
to project management and construction personnel.

Field survey

Date of Investigation:

December 2010

The LCRA’s Transmission Services Corporation is in the process of upgrading their T-268
Transmission Line that runs east to west through portions of Llano and Mason Counties,
involving the placement new transmission structures and lines. The T-268 corridor was surveyed
by the LCRA’s Archeology Services in 2009 for the upgrade project during which 18 sites were
recorded (Malof 2010:214). Three of these sites were assessed as eligible or potentially eligible
for SAL designation and avoidance measures were recommended. The Archeology Division
concurred with our assessments and recommendations.
Recently the line crews encountered an unrecorded stone field fence on the east side of Mason
County that crosses the T-268 corridor at a near right angle. This wall lies in an upland area that
was not included in the 2009 survey because it was considered to have a low potential for
archeological sites (Figure 239 and Figure 240). Construction crews will need to create an
opening in the wall about 15 feet wide for their machinery and vehicles pass down the corridor.
An alternative is to widen an existing gate in the wall located about 20 feet south of the south
edge of the ROW. The opening of the gate has a present width close to 11 feet, so an additional
four foot length of wall on one side will have to be removed if this alternative is used.
Archeology Services staff visited the site on December 1, 2010 to record the wall and assess its
significance. It has since been given the trinomial designation of 41MS97. The stone field fence
runs north to south across the transmission line ROW and stands to a maximum (original?) height
of four feet in some short sections (Figure 241 and Figure 242). However in most places, the
upper courses have fallen and the average height of the wall is closer to 30 inches. Its entire
length was not measured but it clearly runs for at least a hundred feet on either side of the ROW
disappearing into the brush. The wall is built of stacked granite rocks and boulders which are
unmodified except possibly for some intentional breakage. Nearly all the rocks are covered by
lichen. The wall is mostly 14” thick, about the width of some of the larger stones. Immediately
south of the ROW, a 10 foot wide breech has been made in the wall for a metal cattle gate
supported by large wood posts. A barbed wire supported by cedar and T posts runs along the
west side of the wall.
It does not appear that the wall is part of a larger complex of buildings or that there are buried
cultural deposits associated with it in or near the LCRA ROW, as demonstrated by a shovel test.
Family history by the landowner states that the wall was built by convict labor in the late 19th
century. The wall does not appear to meet any of the criteria for SAL designation, and in any
case only a small portion of the wall will need to be removed to create a passage for vehicles.
LCRA Archeology Services recommends that the upgrade crew be allowed to either make a new
opening in the wall or to widen the existing opening at the gate by four feet, and requests
concurrence from your office.

Structure Replacement Project
(Figures 243-268)
County(s):

Date of Investigation:

September 2010

The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) has requested a grant from the U. S. Bureau of
Reclamation (USBR) to retrofit 11 check gate structures within the upper portion of the eastern
canal system at the LCRA’s Gulf Coast Irrigation Division (GCID) in Wharton and Matagorda
counties, Texas (Figure 243 through Figure 246). Each of the new check gate structures will have
two aluminum slide gates with actuators and instrumentation for automatic control. These slide
gates will replace wooden boards that fit into slots to regulate water flow. Other project features
include 10 level monitoring probes, 3 spill monitoring sites, a radio based data communication
system, and a supervisory control and data acquisition system.
A literature review indicates that construction of irrigation canals in the Matagorda and Wharton
county areas began around 1900. The construction of the irrigation canals encouraged rice
production which helped diversify the local economy. Farmers in Matagorda County and other
counties on and near the Texas Gulf Coast increasingly turned to rice farming in the early 1900s
as cotton crops were being attacked by the boll weevil. By 1912, Bay City, the Matagorda
County seat, was one of the leading rice markets in the state. Although cotton production would
rebound in the 1910s, rice production continued to expand until the rice market collapsed at the
end of World War I. Rice production and agriculture in general continued to decline in these
counties during the Great Depression. Rice cultivation revived in later years so that by 1940,
16,000 acres were planted in rice in Matagorda County. In 1948, nearby Brazoria County was the
nation’s number-one rice producing area. Since the 1970s, the number of rice farms in Texas has
remained generally stable at 1,200 to 1,500 farms in production. The Handbook of Texas Online
reported in 2000 that the rice industry was expected to remain stable in Texas due to increases in
domestic consumption and the opening of international markets.
The history of the GCID begins in the early twentieth century when Victor L. LeTulle built the
Bay City Irrigation Company in 1901. His success sparked the growth of competing canal
builders. In 1927, LeTulle bought the other 12 canal companies operating in Matagorda County
and 1 in Wharton County, combining them into one of the largest individually owned canal
companies in the world. He named it the Gulf Coast Irrigation System. LeTulle sold his
company to Interstate Public Service in 1931, which renamed the irrigation system as the Gulf
Coast Water Company. In 1960, the LCRA purchased the Gulf Coast Water Company and
renamed it the GCID. The GCID is one of three irrigation districts on the lower Colorado River
drainage system that the LCRA owns and operates.
A search of the LCRA Records and Archives Department along with conversations with staff at
the GCID office in Bay City indicates that LCRA did not receive any archival data from the Gulf
Coast Water Company relating to the construction of the check structures when the LCRA
purchased the company in 1960. It is assumed that the original check structures were
constructed in the very early twentieth century and that they were made entirely of wood. Several
491

LCRA employees at the Bay City office of the GCID have hypothesized that during the 1920s
and 1930s, concrete began to be used to replace headwalls, bulkheads, and other deteriorated
parts of the check dam structures.
The LCRA Records and Archives Department does have a copy of an evaluation study of the
assets of the Gulf Coast Water Company that was conducted by Freese, Nichols and Turner in
1956 for LCRA prior to LCRA’s purchase of the company. A section of the study provides a
summary of the numbers of the various types of canal structures including the bridges, locks, and
lock and bridge combinations in the portion of the company property east of the Colorado River.
Importantly, too, the summary describes the numbers of canal structures made of treated lumber,
oak timber, concrete, and corrugated metal pipe. A map attachment with the study shows the
locations the various canal structures and the different symbols on the map legend provide data
on the construction material type of each structure. This map indicates that all 11 of the check
dam structures had concrete locks in 1956.
The 11 check gate structures proposed for retrofitting constitute about 15% of the approximately
74 total check gate structures in the eastern half GCID. Descriptions of the 11 check structures
based on current photographs are provided below.
1. Head Lock (Figure 247 and Figure 248): The headwall has vertical concrete columns and
horizontal concrete columns that serve as the surface of a wooden bridge. A metal rail
and metal grate walkway has been constructed in front of the headwall.
2. Goode Lock (Figure 249 and Figure 250): The headwall has vertical concrete columns
and concrete side walls. The structure has wooden railing and a wooden pedestrian
walkway.
3. Hootie Lock (Figure 251 and Figure 252): The headwall has vertical wooden concrete
columns. Concrete bulkheads are also visible. A wooden railing is present on the
upstream side while a metal railing is present on the downstream side. A metal grate
pedestrian walkway is present.
4. County Line Lock (Figure 253 and Figure 254): The location of this check structure is
not shown on the 1956 which may suggest that it was constructed in more recent times.
A concrete lock is mapped is shown about 0.7 miles upstream on the 1956 map. The
current headwall has vertical concrete columns that support horizontal concrete beams.
The headwall also has concrete abutments on its outer edges. Concrete abutments are also
present on the side walls and on the downstream side of the structure. The structure has a
metal grate walkway and metal railing.
5. Upper Pierce Lock (Figure 255 and Figure 256): This structure has vertical concrete
columns on its headwall including one column that appears to be damaged. There are
wood beam vertical extensions of the concrete columns. The wood rails appear to be old
and deteriorated. The structure has a concrete walkway and bulkhead.
6. Highway Lock (Figure 257 and Figure 258): Not much of this structure is visible due to
the fact that it is adjacent to a highway right-of-way. It has concrete vertical columns and
a metal grate walkway with a metal chain hand railing.
7. Lower Pierce Lock (Figure 259 and Figure 260): This structure has a headwall with
vertical concrete columns and concrete abutments on the outer edges. Vertical wood
beams extend above the concrete columns to form a wooden railing on the upstream of
the structure. Portions of concrete side walls and bulkhead are visible on the downstream
side.

columns set atop vertical concrete columns to form the foundation for a wooden
walkway. Concrete sidewalls and bulkhead are visible on the downstream photograph.
9. Hog Pen Lock (Figure 263 and Figure 264): This lock is not present on the 1956 map but
a bridge is shown on that map about 0.25miles downstream. This lock has a concrete
headwall with vertical concrete columns and concrete walls on the outside edges of the
structure. This structure has a metal walkway and railing.
10. Cobb Lock (Figure 265 and Figure 266): This structure has both a lock and bridge. It has
a concrete headwall with vertical concrete columns. Both the railing and the bridge are
made of wood.
11. Tillman Lock (Figure 267 and Figure 268): This structure has a concrete headwall with
vertical concrete columns. The downstream view indicates that both concrete and
wooden horizontal cross beams support a wooden bridge. The structure has no railing
feature.
As described above, the County Line Lock and the Hog Pen Lock are not present on the 1956
map and may represent locks that are less than 50 years in age. Both of these locks as well as the
Head, Hootie, and Highway locks include metal grate walkways and metal railings that are recent
additions/changes to these structures. Both the Upper Pierce and Live Oak Tree locks have
wooden elements that show signs of deterioration that is probably due to their greater age and
lack of repairs through time. Better examples of locks of greater age that do not show obvious
signs of deterioration and do not include metal components consist of the Goode, Lower Pierce,
Cobb, and Tillman locks. The Goode and Lower Pierce locks are check dam structures with
narrow pedestrian walkways while the Cobb and Tillman locks are locks with bridge crossings
for vehicular traffic. The LCRA requests the Texas SHPO’s comments on the National Register
eligibility status of the 11 check gate structures proposed for retrofitting.
Aside from the check gate structures, the two other project components consist of the level
monitoring probes and the spill monitoring sites. The level probes will be placed in previously
disturbed areas adjacent to the canal at the approximate mid-points between two check structures.
The spill monitoring sites are existing structures that LCRA staff will be instrumenting to monitor
overflows from the canal system and minimal disturbance is expected. A file search showed that
there are no previously recorded cultural resource sites within or near the level monitoring probe
and spill monitoring site areas. Based on the previous disturbances and the absence of any known
cultural resource sites, LCRA requests your concurrence that construction associated with the
level monitoring probes and spill monitoring sites does not have the potential to affect any
cultural resource sites that may be eligible or potentially eligible for listing on the National
Register of Historic Places.

Project 72.10 T-541 Transmission Line Upgrade Project; Replacement of Existing
Transmission Poles at the Yorktown Lutheran Cemetery
(Figure 269, Figure 270)
County(s):

DeWitt

Type of Investigation:

File search

Date of Investigation:

December 2010

The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) is proposing to upgrade its existing T-541
transmission line which extends for a length of approximately 45 miles from the Cuero Substation
to the Kenedy Substation in DeWitt and Karnes counties, Texas. Although this project will
involve the direct replacement of existing transmission poles in previously excavated holes, the
LCRA Cultural Resource staff recently became concerned about the fact that two of the existing
transmission poles are located within the boundaries of the Lutheran Cemetery in Yorktown,
Texas (Figure 269). Specifically, the staff became concerned about the possibility that if an
existing pole, STR 27/13, that is located within the northern edge of the cemetery could not be
successfully uprooted and removed, then a new hole would have to be excavated nearby for
subsurface placement of the new pole. As shown on the Figure 2 aerial map, areas south of STR
27/13 are within the cemetery while areas more than 2 feet northward are on private property that
is not part of the cemetery. Within the cemetery, this pole is situated about 4.5 meters (14.76 ft)
northwest of nearest marked grave, which is a child’s grave dating to the 1896. Along the
centerline of the transmission line where a new hole would logically be dug if needed, the closest
marked grave was 7.5 meters (24.6 ft) to the southwest of the existing pole. The second pole
within the cemetery boundaries, STR 27/12, is of much less concern since about 37 meters
southwest of any marked graves in an area reserved for future usage as grave sites.
On December, 3, 2010, I contacted Mark Denton of your staff by electronic mail for advice on
contingency planning in the event that the existing STR 27/13 could not be successfully removed
and a new hole would need to be excavated within the cemetery or nearby on adjacent private
property. From Mr. Denton, I learned that any area within 75 feet of a cemetery boundary would
require archaeological investigation for placement of a new pole. He also stated that remote
sensing rarely works in locating unmarked graves, but that shovel testing would be acceptable if
bedrock or subsoil were close to ground surface. Subsequent review of the county soil survey
indicated that the Papalote Series soils at the cemetery location typically have B horizon sandy
clay subsoil that lies beneath a 41 to 51 cm thick sandy loam A horizon topsoil. Thus, it appeared
that shovel testing was a suitable approach since the B horizon subsoil was close to ground
surface and the soil regime was such that any unmarked grave pits would exhibit a disturbed
mixture of sandy loam and sandy clay.
The cemetery area and adjacent private property to the north of the cemetery was shovel tested by
the LCRA Cultural Resource staff on December 28, 2010. Five shovel tests were excavated with
three being placed in the vicinity of STR 27/13, the main area of concern, and two in the vicinity
of STR 27/12 to further verify that no unmarked graves were ever placed in that part of the
cemetery (Figure 270).
Shovel Test #1 (ST #1) was excavated in the two foot gap between the existing STR 27/13 pole
and the cemetery’s chain link fence. A disturbed mixture of mottled clays of reddish yellow,
strong brown, and gray colors was found intermixed with brown sandy loam and reddish brown
sandy clay to depths 55 to 60 cm within the shovel test hole. Deeper to the bottom of the shovel
509

test at 80 cm below ground surface, the fill was mostly the reddish brown B horizon sandy clay,
but some patches brown sandy loam and gray sandy loam were still present suggesting soil
disturbance all the way to bottom of the shovel test. The archaeologists concluded that the soil
disturbances probably represent backdirt from the original excavation of the hole for the existing
pole along with disturbance from previous construction of one or more fences along the cemetery
boundary.
Shovel Test #2 (ST #2) was placed within the cemetery about 3.7 meters (12.1 ft) southwest of
the existing STR 27/13. The excavation of this shovel test produced a natural, undisturbed soil
profile with a 43 cm thick reddish brown sandy loam topsoil deposit sitting on a reddish yellow
sandy clay subsoil which was seen from 43 to 53 cm below ground surface, at which point the
excavation was terminated.
Shovel Test #3 (ST #3) was located on the adjacent private property in pastureland about 1.5
meters (5 feet) north of the cemetery boundary along the centerline of the transmission line. It is
also situated about 4.57 meters (15 feet) northeast of the existing STR 27/13 pole. As with ST
#2, ST #3 revealed an undisturbed soil profile with a 43 cm reddish brown sandy loam topsoil
above a reddish yellow and gray streaked sandy clay subsoil.
Thus, it appears that a replacement pole for STR 27/13 could be placed at the locations of either
ST #2 and 3 with a high degree of certainty that no unmarked graves would be disturbed. In the
event that the STR 27/13 was moved to the southwest or northeast of its existing location, then
the location of STR 27/12 might also need to be moved so that span length between the two
structures is not radically changed.
To prepare for this possibility, Shovel Tests #4 and 5 were excavated at spots 4.57 meters (15 ft)
northeast and 3.7 meters (12.1 ft) southwest of STR 27/12, respectively. ST #4 showed an
undisturbed natural reddish brown sandy loam down to the B horizon clay at the bottom of the
shovel test at 60 cm below ground surface. In ST #5, some mottled reddish yellow and strong
brown sandy clay was seen from ground surface down to a depth of 7 cm. Deeper, an
undisturbed soil profile was evident. The archaeologists concluded that the disturbed soil seen
near ground surface in ST #5 could be backdirt from the original excavation of the hole of nearby
existing STR 27/12 or the result of some past soil and/or trash dump event from construction of
nearby outbuildings related to the church building. Overall, it appeared that a replacement pole
for STR 27/12 could be placed at either the ST #4 or ST #5 location with a high level of
confidence that no unmarked graves would be disturbed.
In conclusion, LCRA intends to directly replace the existing STR 27/13 pole at its current
location which is within the extreme north boundary of the Yorktown Lutheran Cemetery. The
machinery used to uproot the pole would be placed on the adjacent private property to the north.
The machinery would be placed so that it could reach over the cemetery fence to grasp the pole
and uproot it. Should that existing pole break while it is being uprooted, it would typically break
at or just under existing ground surface. If the pole breaks at or near ground surface, LCRA
personnel can usually dig down slightly below ground surface around the pole, attach a chain or
rope to the pole and often successfully still uproot it. This type of removal would require digging
about 6 inches outward from the outside perimeter of the pole to a depth of no more than 2 feet.
However, if the removal is not successful, it will be necessary to excavate a new hole nearby to a
depth of 10 to 17 feet for placement of the new pole. In that event the first choice would be to
excavate the new hole of the private property north of the cemetery boundary at the location of
ST #3. The excavation of that shovel test indicated no previous soil disturbance such as that
typically encountered in grave pit fill. Additionally, should the new STR 27/13 pole be moved
510

4.57 meters northeastward to the location of ST #3, then the location of the new pole for STR
27/12 may need to be moved the same distance northeastward to the spot where ST #4 was
excavated with no evidences of a former grave being present. The next choice would be to
excavate the new hole at the location of ST #2 within the cemetery. This next choice might also
require the movement of STR 27/12 to the spot where ST #5 was excavated.
The LCRA requests your concurrence with our assessment and recommendations for the
transmission pole replacement plan within the Yorktown Lutheran Cemetery. If you have any
questions or need any additional information, please contact me at (512) 397-6714.

On February 8, 2010, LCRA’s Archeology Services staff investigated a possible underground cistern that
was found by a crew while clearing cedars for a T-197 access road near Mansfield Dam in western Travis
County (Figure 271). The investigators determined that the feature was an old sewer or water line
manhole based on the fact that a 10 inch diameter pipe runs horizontally across the bottom of the hole.
Similar pipe fragments were found further downslope to the southwest eroding out of the banks of a
gully. No historic period artifacts were seen around the feature that would suggest that a house was once
present. The feature’s proximity to the dam may indicate that it is related to dam construction activities in
the late 1930s or early 1940s, perhaps a water or sewer line to housing for workers and engineers.
The underground feature is bell-shaped like a cistern, but is smaller with a maximum diameter of 40
inches and a maximum depth of 45 inches (Figure 272). The circular opening is flush with the ground
surface and has a diameter of 25 inches. The manhole’s walls are constructed of commercial yellow
bricks laid in a concrete of Portland cement mixed with coarse sand. The ceramic pipe at the bottom of
the manhole is about 10 inches in diameter running horizontally in a northeast-southwest orientation. The
top of the pipe lies 24 inches below the ground surface with a hole that may once have held a valve. The
manhole cover is missing.
The manhole is located about eight feet outside the area being cleared. It appears that the opening to the
feature was covered by garbage and was first noticed when this garbage was being removed by a front
end loader prior to clearing the area. Archeology Services staff marked the trees adjacent to the feature
with flagging tape to help construction crew avoid it. The foreman stated that no further clearing would
be needed for the access road and that the trees adjacent to the manhole would remain in place.

In May, 2010, LCRA’s Archeology Services was alerted to the fact that an unrecorded cemetery was
found by LCRA work crews doing routine maintenance and clearing on the T-545 Transmission line in
Colorado County south of Columbus (Figure 273). One of the maintenance crew led a member of
Archeology Services staff to the cemetery. The cemetery lies approximately 100 feet east of the highway
ROW on the east edge of the LCRA’s T-545 Transmission line ROW. The nearest transmission tower
(structure), designated 32/2, is located approximately 50 feet to the northeast of the cemetery. The UTM
coordinates for the center of the cemetery are E746285 N3272315 (Zone 14. NAD 83).
The cemetery consists of six graves within a square-shaped area enclosed by a wire mesh fence 25 feet on
a side supported by cedar posts (Figure 274). All the graves are oriented east to west with the grave
markers on the west side facing east. The earliest burial, that of Rachel Brown (1895 to 1972) is located
in the northwest corner of the cemetery. It is covered by a concrete slab that now tilts to one side into the
ground. A home-made concrete gravestone rests at the head of the slab inscribed with her name and birth
and death date. The inscribed letters are filled with black paint. Immediately to the south of this grave is
that of Charlie Brown (1895-1978) marked by a similar home-made marker but no slab. A depression
marks the outline of this burial. On the west side on Rachel Brown’s grave along the inside of the fence
is a partially buried stone maker broken into at least two pieces. This maker was made in a factory and
apparently commemorates the military service of Charlie Brown. The intact portion reads “CHARLIE
[missing] PFC US [missing] WORLD [missing] 1898 [missing].
The other four graves lie in a row east of the two Brown graves. The three with inscribed markers all
have the last name of Axel. The earliest of these, at the north end adjacent to the fence, is that of Ellie M.
Axel (1948-1984) and immediately south of this the grave of Cleo P. Axel (1920 to 1987). Both have
home-made concrete markers very similar to those that mark the Brown graves. Next to Cleo Axel’s
grave is an unidentified grave marked only by a funeral home plaque missing the (paper?) identification
card. On the south side of this grave is the most recent grave, that of Leroy Axel (1950 to 2005). This
grave is marked only by the funeral home plaque and a mound of dirt outlining the burial. Remains of
badly weathered artificial flowers and items associated with flower arrangements are scattered over the
grave.
The cemetery has not been kept up. Several of the cedar fence posts are broken and weeds and brush
presently grow on and around the graves. A large cedar tree growing in the north end of the cemetery is
posing a threat to the transmission lines above and will have to be trimmed or cut down. The soil in the
area appears to consist of fine light-colored sand. The transmission line ROW where the cemetery is
located has been cleared of trees but contains high weeds and brush. Outside the ROW immediately east
of cemetery is a forest of live oaks and cedars.
The LCRA work crews are aware of the cemetery and will not disturb it during the current maintenance
project. The LCRA filed a Notice of Existence of the Cemetery with the County Clerk of Colorado
County in May. 2010. A trinomial (41CD141) was also obtained for the Brown/Axel cemetery so that the
site will turn up on future cultural resources file searches for the T-545 easement.

On August 4, 2010, Dan Prikryl of the LCRA Cultural Resource staff conducted construction monitoring
for a portion of the Clear Springs to Hutto Transmission Line Project in Caldwell County at the location
of previously recorded site 41CW136 (Figure 275). The monitoring involved assessing effects on site
41CW136 that might occur during the removal of a banked up soil deposit within the right-of-way of
County Road 103 so that a usable roadway could be created for entry into the private property north of the
county road.
The road construction work occurred within the right-of-way of the LCRA’s Clear Springs to Hutto
transmission line. A previous intensive cultural resource survey had determined that, 41CW136, a
potentially significant prehistoric campsite was located within the transmission line ROW at this location.
The site had, in fact, been previously bisected by the construction of the county road. Special conditions
had been established for construction personnel to follow so the intact parts of the site both to the north
and south of the road ROW would not be negatively affected (Figure 276).
During a field visit to the site in the summer of 2009 with the field construction coordinator (FCC), it was
noted that soil had accumulated to a height of about 50 cm immediately north of the asphalt county road
bed within the road ROW. The hump of dirt continued from the edge of the road northward for a distance
of 4 meters to the north edge of the road ROW. The excess soil was then spread on ground surface to the
north of the fence on the adjacent private property where the current ground surface was lower in
elevation. The FCC stated that the soil bank would have to be removed so that trucks and other machinery
could exit off the county road onto the adjacent private property.
It seemed probable that the soil bank represented soil and gravel that accumulated adjacent to the road
bed by a maintainer machine during multiple episodes of road maintenance work before the era that the
road had been paved with asphalt. However, there was some possibility that the soil bank represented the
original ground surface, and if so, then intact prehistoric deposits could be present. To ensure that no
intact site deposits would be affected, it was concluded that the soil removal should be monitored by an
archaeologist (Figure 277).
The front end loader bucket mounted on a backhoe tractor was used to remove the soil deposit in 15 cm (6
inch) increments. The archaeologist examined the backdirt pile from each bucket load as well as the new
ground surface exposed after each bucket load was removed. Samples of fill from each bucket swipe
were also screened through ¼ inch wire mesh. The maximum depth of soil removal was 40 cm (15.7
inches) while in most areas it ranged from 30 to 35 cm (11.8 to 13.77 inches). Soil removal was greatest
in the area immediately adjacent to the asphalt road. From that point the soil removal was gradually less
proceeding northward so that a gently sloping pathway was created.
Inspection of the soil bank material showed that all of it was gravelly silty loam soil with the high number
of gravel cobbles suggesting that it was originally road base material. No prehistoric artifacts were
present in this introduced fill in two areas immediately adjacent to the asphalt road where some possible
burned rocks were found on the ground surface after the final swipes by the front end loader bucket. It
appears that the desired elevation at these spots for the new roadway may be right at the very top of the
cultural component. However, the screening of several loads of soil from this elevation failed to produce
any flint flakes, additional burned rocks, or any other types of artifacts.
Following the screening of the soil, the archaeologist watched as several dump truck loads of crushed
limestone were spread over the surface of the area that had been scraped to create a stable road base for
the construction machinery that will travel from the county road ROW through the gate onto the
transmission line ROW northward.

524

In conclusion, it appears that no significant or potentially significant portions of site 41CW136 were
impacted by the removal of the soil bank in the county road ROW. The construction crew under the
supervision of the FCC later placed a line of hardwood timber mats over the portion of the site that
extends further northward into the private property. The construction machinery then drove on these mats
so that no damage occurred to any portion of the site deposits north of County Road 103. The LCRA
Cultural Resource also ensured that no construction machinery was allowed on the portion of site
41CW136 on the opposite (south) side of County Road 103.

Introduction
The Colorado Room, an LCRA-owned building located on and leased by LCRA from the University of
Texas, was acquired by LCRA in 1992 to serve as a dining facility for employees at the recently
completed General Office Complex. The facility ceased operation 2005. In 2009 LCRA determined that
the building posed too many logistical problems to be rehabilitated, and it was decided to demolish the
structure. The project was reviewed by LCRA Archaeology Services staff, who felt that the structure was
too compromised to maintain any historical integrity, and that the potential for significant associated
archaeological materials was negligible. However, due to its location on the historic Brackenridge Tract
and its association with local and LCRA history, it was decided to monitor the demolition to gather
additional information of the building. The Texas Historical Commission concurred with these
recommendations and the City Historic Preservation Officer approved the demolition permit without
comment.
Historic Background
There is little available information on the building itself, located at 3800 Lake Austin Boulevard (Figure
278, Figure 279, Figure 280). A 1993 asbestos survey stated the original building dated to about 1895,
with major renovations in 1981 and 1984, although no citations were provided (Maxim Engineers, 1993).

530

Figure 279. 2006 aerial imagery of Colorado Room.
In 1986, Espey, Huston and Associates (EHA) conducted an archaeological survey of the Brackenridge
Tract presumably prior to development in the area (Espey, Huston and Associates 1986). The report
included a paragraph on the Lake View Café, and apparently relied in part on discussions with the owner
(Gatewood) at the time. In the description, the Lake View Cafe was listed in the 1916 Austin City
Directory and was run by W. Frank Howard, although apparently at another address, because in 1921 the
location of the present café was listed as a private residence. A red, sandstone rock veneer was added in
the 1940s. Then, between 1950 and 1970 (referred to as the 1950-1970 period in the report) it was known
as Shorty’s Lakeview Inn. The internet website Geneology.com identifies the owners as Logan Edmond
Fields and Louise Breedlove Fields, who were also known as Mr. and Mrs. Shorty (Figure 281). In 1981
it was remodeled, and it became the Lakeview Café. (note: The rock facing was cleanly cut and
mortared on the east wall where it joined the addition from the 1980s. This seems inconsistent with a
1940s improvement, although it may have been retrofitted [sawed and remortared] at that time.)

Monitoring
The demolition began in February, 2010. Figure 282 through Figure 286 show the Colorado building
prior to demolition. Interior fixtures were stripped and some interior paneling that ran throughout the
building was removed. The exterior rock was removed for reuse by Habitat for Humanity. Demolition
was concluded by a trackhoe loader on February 22, 2010.
The removal of the exterior rock facing provided an opportunity to better understand the history of
structure construction and alteration. It became clear that the southern one-third of the structure was of
original construction, with the south and east walls the only remaining sections (Figure 287) -- the
original north wall had been completely removed for the large addition on that side. It originally was a
shotgun style, single gabled roof on an east/west axis. Construction was balloon-style stud framing. The
exterior was of false bevel teardrop horizontal lap wood siding with evidence of various repainting
episodes (Figure 288). Five large windows were present on the south wall (Figure 289). The central
window had been framed from underneath, with masonry reinforcement, suggesting it had been a door at
one point (see Figure 286). The interior had been refinished alternatively with cedar planks and gypsum
wallboard. Underneath was found horizontal wood shiplap siding with an exterior width of seven inches.
There was some evidence of early painting, although it clearly had once been wall papered using the
cheesecloth and tack method.
At one time, a series of awnings had been cut into the south and east walls, and presumably the north and
west as well (Figure 290). These had been done rather crudely, but obviously afforded a means of
opening the building for cross-ventilation, and was obviously not part of a domestic design. Additionally,
above the the two westernmost windows had been placed a board that was sign painted on both sides
532

saying “Lake~View Cafe.” The sign would most likely have been on the road below. The signage,
located underneath the rock veneer, reportedly added in the 1940s, clearly predates the Shorty’s Lakeview
Inn period. An aerial photograph from 1940 shows the plan of the building and what appears to be an
awning over the window just west of center (Figure 291). This indicates the rock had not yet been
installed, and demonstrates commercial use at that time.
A visit was made to the site on March 1, 2010, soon after the south half of the building had been
demolished (Figure 292) and most of the building material removed from the foundation area. All
recognizable traces of the floor or concrete slab (if any) were gone, exposing the ground beneath the
building. The base of the south wall of the building was still in place but partially covered by building
material. The ground surface where the building stood was covered with sand and gravel on the west half
and dirt on the east half with scattered pieces of splintered wood, window glass, and PVC pipe left over
from the demolition (Figure 293).
The few old historic artifacts under the building included two bases of aqua glass soda bottles and two
aqua glass body sherds. The bottle bases were blown in a post mold, which was the most common bottle
mold in the last third of the 19th century and continued in use for soda bottles until at least 1910 (Lindsey
2010). Moderate amounts of prehistoric debitage were also seen scattered over the surface. However,
most of the chert fragments under the building came from cobbles shattered by heavy machinery. The
prehistoric material most likely represents a southern extension of 41TV1588, a lithic procurement site
recorded in 1991 by LCRA archeologists in the area immediately north of the Colorado Room. This site
was also recorded as having a minor historic component of late 18th and early 20th century trash, including
cut nails and purple glass. Like the historic artifacts noted under the Colorado Room building, most of
this material predates the original Colorado Room structure, if constructed in the 1920s, and suggests the
presence of an earlier house on the site or in the vicinity.
There were no obvious early foundation structures such as corner piers or posts under the older part of the
building. Several rough limestone blocks approximately 18 inches long, 10’ wide, and six inches deep
laid end-to-end were exposed along the inside of the concrete skirt that ran along the base of the building
between the stone veneer and the wood siding (Figure 294). These stone blocks possibly lay immediately
below the building’s frame and could be the original (continuous) foundation. Fine sand was packed in
the narrow space between adjoining blocks. Another set of similar stones appeared to run at right angles
to the other stones but were too far into the structure to be the foundations of an outer wall.
Summary
In summary, the structure once present at 3800 Lake Austin Boulevard probably dated to 1921, when it
was present as a domestic residence. The Lake View Cafe, which was on the same street as the residence,
probably changed its location, perhaps due to dam construction and the widespread disturbance, moving
to the once private house. The 1895 date referred to in the asbestos report is almost certainly incorrect,
and is perhaps based on an estimate. The type of finish, both interior and exterior, dimensions of wall
studs (1.75 x 3.75 in) and city records all place original construction around 1920. The change to
commercial use occurred sometime prior to 1940. The building site is now covered by grass and no trace
of the structure is visible above ground (Figure 295).
A number of Austin City Directories were reviewed to try to clarify occupation sequences for the Lake
View (Lakeview) Inn and Cafe. As noted previously, in 1916 it was the Lake View Cafe, operated by W.
Frank Howard, and located on West 6th Street, “opposite the Austin Dam.” In the 1918, 1922, 1930 and
1940 directories there is no mention of either the “Lake View” or “Lakeview” establishments. In 1947,
the Lakeview Cafe is placed at 3801 Lake Austin Boulevard across the street from the present address)
and operated by the Fields. In 1955 it is at 3800 Lake Austin Boulevard, still operated by Fields. It

remains at this location but in 1970 and 1975 it is the Lakeview Inn, operated by a J. B. Moore. In 1985
the name is the same, and no proprietor is listed.

A stack or restaurant receipts was found amongst the rubble. They belonged to Stephanie, who would
also sign her name “Steph.” She was working October 13, 1984, a Saturday. She had five tables (F 1-5)
and ten tickets, including one that had been voided. Her first ticket closed out at 5:28 P. M. and the last at
10:03 P.M. Total receipts were $148.08, an average of about $16.50 per table, once the canceled ticket is
discounted. Tips are not shown on the receipts, but if she made a minimum of 15 percent on each table
she would have left with about $22, not counting her hourly wage, which was probably a little over a
dollar an hour. It appears most patrons were there for appetizers and drinks. A dozen oysters were $4.25,
a shrimp cocktail $4.25, a tossed salad $1.25, fried cheese $3.75 and cheese cake $2.25. Beer on tap was
$1.25, well drinks $2.25 and call drinks $2.75. Sodas and tea were $0.65. The few meals seen included
scampi for $9.95 and a pan fry with vegetables for $10.95. Drinks that were ordered included Miller and
Corona beer, VO and 7, Dewars and soda, gin and tonic, and scotch and soda. This is seemingly light
traffic for a Saturday night, and may have foreshadowed the eventual closing of the business.
