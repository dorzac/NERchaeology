ABSTRACT

A two acre property situated immediately east of the Lisbon Cemetery and
on both sides of Denley Drive in South Dallas is proposed for
development. Archival research failed to find any evidence that the study
area had been residentially occupied in the historic period and this is an
area of low prehistoric archaeological potential. A pedestrian survey that
included shovel testing failed to find any evidence of past historic or
prehistoric occupation but did show that the topsoil is thin and rested on
platy limestone bedrock. Nine trenches were excavated outside the
cemetery fence in order to determine if unmarked graves were present but
none was found. AR Consultants recommends that property development
proceed as planned.

INTRODUCTION
Two undeveloped tracts located along Denley Drive in South Dallas were studied to
determine if they contained any significant cultural resources. The tracts include a
triangle-shaped 0.3184 acre tract located on the east side of Denley Drive and including a
filled in intermittent drainage swale that runs east-west and once probably extended east
across Lancaster Road and into property that now is the site of the Dallas Veterans
Administration Hospital. The drainage swale has been filled with concrete, boards,
asphalt, and other construction fill that may have originated from buildings once located
along the west side of Lancaster. The larger tract is 1.841 acres in area and is situated on
the west side of Denley Drive. The tract is “L”-shaped with the long axis being the edge
of Denley Drive and the short axis perpendicular to it on the south side of the drainage
that crosses under Denley from the east. The “L” wraps around the full length of the east
side of Lisbon Cemetery and on the south, it extends for a distance of 178 feet but not to
the western corner of the cemetery.

Lisbon Cemetery was established on a five acre tract in 1870 in an area where the Austin
Chalk bedrock which underlies the Blackland Prairie is a short distance below the present
ground surface. This prairie upland would have supported a limited variety of animals in
its native condition (Kuchler 1964) but a wider variety of plants and animals would have
been along the floodplain of Five Mile Creek which is to the south as shown on Figure 1.
The cemetery area is mapped as being part of the Austin-Houston Black General Soil
Association (Coffee and Ressel 1980: General Soils Map), but more specifically being
Stephen-Urban land complex with 1-4 percent slopes (Coffee and Ressel 1980:Sheet 46).
The area to the south is mapped as Lewisville-Urban land complex with 4-8 percent
slopes. Stephen series soils are shallow, well drained, clayey upland soils which were
formed from soft limestones of the Austin chalk formation. The Ap horizon is 0-5” thick
and a very dark grayish brown (10YR2/2) silty clay when moist. The A1 horizon ranges
from 5 to 14” thick and is a very dark grayish brown (10YR2/2) silty clay when moist.
White platy and massive chalky limestone [C horizon] occurs below 14”. Lewisville is a
deep, well drained clayey soil. It has A horizons that extend to 15” and are very dark
grayish brown (10YR3/2) when moist. B horizons extend from 15 to 54 inches. The
B21ca is from 15 to 23 and is dark grayish brown (10YR4/2) when moist. The B22ca
ranges from 23 to 41” and when wet is a light olive brown (2.5Y5/4) silty clay. The B3
horizon extends from 41 to 54 inches below the surface and is light brownish gray
(2.5Y6/2) silty clay. The C horizon ranges from 54” to 75” and is light yellowish brown
(2.5Y6/4) silty clay.
Honey Springs is a location where water comes out from about the Austin Chalk contact
and flows south into Five Mile Creek (Brune 1981:155). The spring is reported to be one
of the largest spring flows in Dallas County as of 1976 and is located near the intersection
of Merit and Gracey Streets in South Dallas. This location is just southwest of the study
area and no doubt the drainage under Denley Drive flows through the south side of the
study area into the mapped channel that is shown on Figure 1.

LISBON HISTORY AND LANDUSE
The Lisbon area was first settled by three Sloan brothers who had originally purchased
certificates in 1836 but did not establish their residency until 1843 or 1844 and then
through the Peters Colony. Samuel Sloan built a log cabin west of Lancaster Road on
what is known today as Bartlett (Anthony 1971:8). Sloan continued to purchase
additional farm land and the ranch became well known locally. After the Civil War the
population increased and the Ann Arbor-Lancaster intersection became the focal point of
a community. Sloan had lost his two oldest sons during the war and by the end of the
1870s he had sold his land in Dallas County and moved to West Texas. In October of
1870, E.A. Gracey and Samuel Sloan donated five acres of land from their adjoining
farms for use as a cemetery, school and church sites. Gracey deeded three acres on the
south side of his farm and Sloan deeded two acres on the north side of his homestead.
The cemetery is not listed by James (2007) or Harvey (2003).The earliest date on a
marker is 1873 but it is believed that other graves had been placed there as early as 1871.
According to Anthony (1971:85) there are more than 400 graves but the cemetery did not
have a formal grave patterning, in fact, she claims that the graves were placed more or
less at random although the aerial photograph used in this report looks as if the headstone
are in north-south rows. A post office named Lisbon was opened in the 1880s, and a
blacksmith shop was established on the northwest corner of the intersection. A cotton gin
was built nearby. Lisbon was annexed by Dallas in the late 1920s and since then it has
lost its identity except that the Lisbon Elementary School is located on the northwest
corner of the Ann Arbor-Lancaster intersection.
Lisbon was a good example of a rural agricultural community situated on the fringe of a
developing major metropolitan area. Early on, water was secured from dug wells or saved
in cisterns. Sloan’s original residence was a two pen dog-trot log cabin to which a shed
room and an “L” addition were added. and the house was ultimately moved to Ledbetter
Drive.
Historic maps of the area provide little information for the period prior to 1900. There is
an undated General Land Office map in Anthony’s book and although it shows the
intersection of Ann Arbor and Lancaster, it does not map any of the structures or the
cemetery that are described in the vicinity of the intersection. The 1893 Dallas 30’ USGS
map (Figure 2) shows Lisbon at the intersection of Lancaster and probably Ann Arbor to
the east but does not show the cemetery or any structures. Sam Street’s 1900 map of
Dallas County (Figure 3) shows Lisbon but no road to the west of where the road now
known as Ann Arbor intersects with the Lancaster. The cemetery is not shown nor are
any residences shown in the area surrounding where the cemetery is. A cotton gin is
plotted west of the creek to the west of the cemetery area.
The 1920 Soil Map of Dallas (Figure 4) shows a church on the south side of Ann Arbor
opposite a road that intersects with the north side of Ann Arbor. This location is one
block west of Lancaster and corresponds to the intersection with Denley Drive. An
unlabeled cemetery is situated southwest of the church and must be Lisbon Cemetery.

Residences are shown west of the intermittent tributary that defines the western edge of
the cemetery, but no residences are shown in the immediately surrounding area to the
east, south or southwest. Residences are shown facing onto Lancaster. At this time,
Lisbon remained a distinct community from Oak Cliff or Dallas and its road system is in
sharp contrast to the well planned and cardinal direction oriented patterning of Trinity
Heights to the north which is just south of Cedar Creek.
No structures are shown on the 1928 Clinger and Lewis Dallas County Road map (Figure
5) and Denley Drive is also not shown. The Bracey Block Map dated 1937 shows that
Denley Drive extends south from Ann Arbor and jogs southwest before straightening out
again and continuing almost straight to Ledbetter. Neither map shows Lisbon Cemetery
but it appears that Denley jogs at the south end of the cemetery.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
Lisbon Cemetery is a fenced community cemetery that was established in 1871. The
present chain-link fence is outside all the marked graves but unmarked graves could be
partially inside or totally outside the fence. Gravestones inside the fence along the east
side of the cemetery have burial dates in the second half of the 20th century. A total of 30
dated headstones, but only one footstone, are along the eastern side with 24 in the
southern part of the cemetery south of the entry road and a short line of 6 near the north
end of the cemetery. The one footstone is 3 feet west of the fence and the headstones are
basically in a north-south row 11 feet west of the fence. The cemetery association was
unaware of human bones being encountered when the 30 interments occurred. An
unmarked row of graves could have been placed 3 meters from the headstones and would
be situated half inside and half outside the present fence. No bones were noted in the dirt
mounds of the two relatively recently excavated grave sites. No evidence of an older
fence is present. Two east-west oriented grave sites are near the southern side of the
fenced cemetery but otherwise, graves are not close to the inside of the fence. The
purpose of this investigation was to determine if unmarked graves are present outside the
chain-link fence and might be damaged by proposed development. Furthermore, the
purpose of survey and testing was to determine if the prehistoric archaeological potential
of this tract in the Blackland Prairie and not near a permanent spring was low as
previously predicted (Skinner et al. 1978:Figure 23). Likewise, DART line research
indicated that the potential for historic resources is also low (Jurney 1991:9-12; Skinner
et al. 1996:179-182).
The eastern side of the cemetery is 300 feet long and the south side is 246 feet long.
Along the east side, five 5 meter long backhoe trench locations were to have been
excavated but trenching confirmed the shallow depth to bedrock and longer trenches were
excavated. Three long-handled fan-shaped trenches were dug at a roughly 45 degree
angle to the south fence in order to see if unmarked graves are in this area. The fan blades
were placed adjacent to the fence and this allowed for exploration along the fence edge.
The handle part of the trenches allowed for sampling of areas where graves might have
been placed in the expected east-west orientation or in a north-south orientation
perpendicular to the fence. A CAT 460 backhoe/front end loader was used to clear brush,
dig trenches, and backfill the excavations. This required clearing some brush and opening
up a fence to get the backhoe into the forested area. Profiles were recorded of the trench
walls and record photographs were also taken. A sample of the sediment above the
bedrock and adjacent to the profiles was passed through ¼” hardware cloth screens as
was the fill from the shovel tests. Shovel tests were used to supplement the results of
trenching in determining if buried cultural materials were present. The tract was surveyed
using north-south oriented transects spaced at 20 m intervals. Photographs were taken
with several digital cameras and handheld Garman GPS 76 units were used for locating
excavation units.

RESULTS
The investigation began by conducting a comprehensive pedestrian survey on the two
tracts. Records had not noted the presence of historic standing structures on the properties
but unfortunately Dallas Sanborn maps do not cover this area and as indicated above
maps after 1920 basically showed the roads but not residences. A review of a recent
aerial photograph of the area (Figure 6) shows that numerous commercial structures and
parking lots/concrete slabs are along Lancaster and three residences are west of Denley
Drive and facing Ann Arbor just north of the study area and the cemetery. An open lot is
north of the northwest corner of the cemetery (Figure 7). A minor intermittent tributary
crosses the lot and has been channelized along the western edge of the cemetery. The
parking lot and then the church building for the True Gospel Ministries Church are
northwest of the drainage and the cemetery. The parking lot extends half way down the
western edge of the cemetery. To the southwest and south of the cemetery fence, brush
has been allowed to invade the property. An abandoned small dirt race track is west of
the southern part of the study area and a fenced shade-tree automobile mechanic shop is
further southwest. A cleared access area to the shop extends from Denley Drive to the
shop and a series of 1950s and 60s frame houses in varying states of repair are along the
west side of Denley to the south to beyond Atlas Drive (Figure 8).
The rear of a Chase Bank building and associated parking lot extend from Lancaster to
Denley on the north side of Atlas Drive. A small frame building is situated on the east
side of Denley just north of the bank property and since the aerial photograph was flown
the building has been enlarged, covered with vinyl siding and a second building has been
added to the rear. This is the location of the Olive Grove Baptist Church. No building
faces onto Denley north to Ann Arbor and an Ace Check Cashing brick building is on the
southwest corner of Ann Arbor and Lancaster. The large two part building immediately
to the south is a two-story Training Center for the Dallas Urban League. A parking lot is
just to the south and provides parking for staff and students. From there south until just
north of the Chase Bank, there is only one standing building which houses the Preston’s
Beauty Salon. Other structures once stood on the several concrete slabs that are present
but they have been demolished and removed. Two historic structures of interest in the
immediate surrounding area is the Lisbon Elementary School (Figure 9) which is to the
north of Ann Arbor and west of Lancaster and the Veterans Administration (Figure 10)
which is across Lancaster and set well back from the road and the DART rail line that
runs north-south between the north-bound and south-bound lanes of Lancaster Road.
While the Lisbon School is closer than the original VA Hospital, the southern part of the
school is the site of a series of one-story portable class rooms.

Survey began on the eastern tract (Figure 11) and the concrete footing of a possible shed
was noted on the surface in this area five feet from ST 1. Artifacts consisting of five
structural clay tile fragments, two green and one clear glass shards, a wire nail, a piece of
wire, and a small whiteware sherd were found mixed into the upper eight inches of the
fill in very dark grayish brown sandy clay. Below this to a depth of 2.46 feet the matrix is
dark grayish brown sandy clay and below this bedrock is reached. The footing (Figure
12) was eight inches wide and extended to the underlying bedrock which occurred at 19.5
inches below the surface in ST 2. No evidence of a floor was noted and no superstructure
was present. The footing was not steel reinforced and the footing was open on the south.
The structure appears to have been nine feet square in size. Artifacts in the shovel test
included two structural clay tile fragments, a section of wire, four clear and one brown
glass shards, and a Schlitz flat top beer can fragment dating to the 1960’s or 70’s. No
other structures were noted in the survey area and large pieces of concrete slabs had been
dumped on the south side of the swale that crosses the south end of the tract. All five
shovel tests on the eastern tract contained cultural materials although the few pieces
found were all mid- to late 1900s in age and were from mixed contexts and sediments.
Bedrock was not reached in ST 3, but was encountered at 29 inches in ST 4, and at 63
inches in ST 5. Artifacts from STs 3-5 were similar to those from the first two shovel
tests and came from mixed contexts.

No features were noted in the parking lot area on the east side of the cemetery, nor were
any features or artifact clusters found in the wooded area to the south. Five shovel tests

were excavated in the southern wooded area and no cultural materials were found. Fill
consisted of sandy clay or clay and bedrock was reached in each of these tests at depths
that were deeper to the south but went no deeper than 35 ½ inches below the surface.
Trenches 1-3 were excavated just outside the south fence of the cemetery. Each of the
trenches was a V-shaped [or fan-shaped] excavation where the opening of the V extended
for a distance of 10-11.5 feet along the edge of the fence and extended away from the
fence for a distance of 15 feet. Bedrock was generally encountered at depths of 14-28
inches and excavation went to depths well into the bedrock in the three trenches. The
trenches were then dug at a generally 45 degree angle from the fence for an additional
distance of 15 feet. The cleared trench was dug well into the limestone bedrock and its
walls and floor were carefully searched for evidence of excavations into the bedrock
where caskets or bodies might have been buried. The walls were profiled (Figure13) and
a sample of the fill was screened. No grave shafts were encountered and a single piece of
clear bottle glass was recovered in the upper eight inches of Trench 1 fill. No other
artifacts were found in the back dirt or in the screened fill of any of the trenches.

Trench 4 was placed outside the southeast corner of the cemetery and found no evidence
of buried deposits, grave shafts, or caskets. The trench was 11.5 feet long
Trenches 5-9 were excavated parallel to the eastern fence of Lisbon Cemetery. Trenches
5, 7, and 9 were dug as close as possible the fence and this averaged from 3 to 4 feet
away. In doing so, it was generally necessary to use the front end bucket, the wheels, and
the right side stabilizer but not the east side stabilizer (Figure 15). Bedrock was found to
be little more than one foot below the present ground surface and was excavated to
depths of two feet or more. No artifacts were found in the backdirt, the screened fill, or in
the trench walls. More importantly, no evidence of grave shaft penetrations into the
bedrock was found exposed in the walls or the floors of the trenches. Trench 5 was the
longest trench and was 133 feet long. Trench 7 was 80 feet long and Trench 9 was 37 feet
long. Trenches 6 and 8 were 16.5 and 20 feet long respectively.

In summary, no evidence of prehistoric occupation was encountered during the course of
the pedestrian survey, shovel testing, or trenching. This was expected due to the distance
to Honey Springs and to Five Mile Creek and the low biotic diversity that would have
been present in the upland prairie that characterized the prehistoric Blackland Prairie.
Year round springs near headwater drainages are uncommon in the Blackland Prairie and
the only site report in this setting is site 41COL79 which is in the upland at Stonebridge
Ranch west of McKinney (Skinner and Trask 1996). This site is close to the spring while
Lisbon Cemetery and the study area are not close to Honey Springs or its drainage.
Historic records and maps indicate that the only landuse in the immediate vicinity of the
study area is the Lisbon Cemetery. While this use began in the 1870s, most of the marked
graves were established after 1900 and none were adjacent to the east or the south fences.
No evidence of historic use or occupation was found on the surface or in trenches outside
the fenced cemetery and this is common for most cemeteries in the DFW Metroplex and
is common throughout the state (Jordan 1982). Contemporary cemeteries such as
Greenwood Cemetery in the Uptown part of downtown Dallas and the edges of
Woodlawn and Hillside Cemeteries in South Dallas have been tested and the fences
served to mark the outer edges of perpendicular caskets along Cason Alley [i.e.,
Woodlawn and Hillside Cemeteries] or there were no unmarked graves outside the fence
as at Greenwood (Skinner 2002; Skinner, van Oeveren, Trask, and Kent 2001). The
Paupers Cemetery part of Greenwood Cemetery (Skinner and Whorton 1997; Trask and
Skinner 2000) had several graves that extended beyond the existing fence but were
actually within a barbed wire fence that was along a drainage that went to the edge of
Clyde Lane. Fourteen of these graves were disinterred and relocated within Greenwood
Cemetery (Tiné, Cooper, and Wurtz 2002). While the records for Lisbon Cemetery were
apparently lost prior to 1958 when the cemetery association was established, the
association does have a good listing of individual and family graves (Anthony
1971:Appendix A). Based on the somewhat un-patterned distribution of graves, it would
appear that burial plots were not purchased but were defined and maintained by families
and whoever took an interest in the cemetery before 1958. Furthermore, fences are a
common trait found in Southern Folk and rural community cemeteries (Jordan 1982) and
there is no reason to believe that the Lisbon Cemetery extended outside the existing fence
boundary. Certainly this is the result of the excavation of Trenches 1-9 where bedrock
was found to be shallow and where the underlying bedrock was undisturbed and
contained its natural platy appearance and showed no evidence of having been mixed
with topsoil or with tougher rock from deeper below the surface. Consequently, it is
concluded that the study area does not contain unmarked graves and that no significant
occupation locations or artifact accumulations are present to be damaged by planned
construction.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the results of records review and testing of the two acres of land which are
proposed to be developed adjacent to the Lisbon Cemetery and on both sides of Denley
Drive in Dallas, AR Consultants concludes that no significant cultural resources will be
impacted by the proposed development. It is our recommendation that no further cultural
resource investigations are warranted. If cultural resources are uncovered during
construction, work should immediately cease in that area and the Texas Historical
Commission be notified.
