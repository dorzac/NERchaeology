ABSTRACT
On December 19, 2006, archeologists from Blanton & Associates, Inc. (Blanton & Associates) conducted
an intensive archeological survey on CR 142 (locally signed as CR 438) at Stinking Creek in Kent
County, Texas, prior to proposed bridge replacement and roadway improvement construction (CSJ: 090827-003). The survey was performed at the request of AIA, Inc. on behalf of the Texas Department of
Transportation’s (TxDOT) Abilene District. Field investigations found no cultural materials and curation
was unnecessary.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
PROJECT TITLE: Archeological Investigations on CR 142 at Stinking Creek, Kent County, Texas.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The project involved an archeological records review and an intensive
archeological survey with shovel testing prior to proposed roadway and bridge improvements on CR 142
(locally signed as CR 438) at Stinking Creek (CSJ: 0908-27-003). Surface and subsurface investigations
discovered no cultural resources within the project area.
The proposed bridge replacement and roadway widening would occur on state property within the
existing ROW. No additional ROW or temporary or permanent easements will be required for this
project. The existing CR 142 ROW is unpaved and approximately 35 to 40 feet wide with a roadway that
is 20 feet wide. The existing steel I-beam bridge measures 28 feet long by 18 feet wide. The proposed
pre-stressed concrete span with T-beams would measure 40 feet long by 26 feet wide and accommodate
two, 12-foot wide lanes. The 150-foot long approach roadways would be widened to match the width of
the proposed new structure. The overall Area of Potential Effect (APE) therefore, measures
approximately 340 feet in length, is 35 to 40 feet wide, and extends approximately 10 feet below the
natural ground surface.
PROJECT LOCATION: The linear project area for the proposed bridge replacement and roadway
improvements is located in the southeast corner of Kent County approximately 0.5 mile east of Harmony,
Texas on FM 70.
TOTAL ACREAGE: Approximately 0.31 acre
DATE OF WORK: December 19, 2006.
PURPOSE OF WORK: Blanton & Associates, Inc. is assisting the project sponsor in their compliance
with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (and subsequent amendments) and the
Antiquities Code of Texas.
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Brandon S. Young
TEXAS ANTIQUITIES PERMIT NUMBER: 4352
NEWLY RECORDED SITES: None.
PREVIOUSLY RECORDED SITES: None.
COMMENTS: Based on the lack of archeological deposits within the project area, Blanton &
Associates, Inc. recommends that the proposed construction be allowed to proceed as planned within the
existing CR 142 ROW without additional cultural resource investigations. As the proposed project area
has been extensively disturbed by erosion and roadway construction and maintenance, it is unlikely that
intact buried cultural resources would be discovered within the APE during construction. If the planned
construction should require additional work space outside of the existing ROW, then additional cultural
resource investigations in those areas would be necessary.

INTRODUCTION
On December 19, 2006 archeologists from Blanton & Associates, Inc. (Blanton & Associates), at the
request of AIA, Inc., and on behalf of the Texas Department of Transportation’s (TxDOT) Abilene
District, conducted an intensive archeological survey on CR 142 (locally signed as CR 438) at Stinking
Creek in Kent County, Texas, prior to proposed bridge replacement and roadway improvement
construction (CSJ: 0908-27-003). The project area is located in rural southeast Kent County (Figures 1.1
and 1.2 at end).
The proposed bridge replacement and roadway widening would occur on state property within the
existing ROW. The existing CR 142 ROW is unpaved and approximately 35 feet wide with a roadway
that is 20 feet wide (Figure 2). The existing steel I-beam bridge measures 28 feet long by 18 feet wide.
The proposed pre-stressed concrete span with T-beams would measure 40 feet long by 26 feet wide and
accommodate two, 12-foot wide lanes (Figure 3). The 150-foot long approach roadways would be
widened to match the width of the proposed new structure. The overall Area of Potential Effect (APE)
therefore, measures approximately 340 feet in length, is 35 to 40 feet wide, extends approximately 10 feet
below the natural ground surface, and encompasses 0.37 acre. No new ROW or temporary or permanent
easements would be required for this project.
As the planned construction would occur on property owned by the State of Texas and administered by
TxDOT, the project is subject to the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas, now subsumed in
Title 13, Part II of the Texas Administrative Code. This legislation defines the necessary conditions for
recognition and preservation of State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) and requires that any political
subdivision of the State of Texas, defined as a “local governmental entity created and operating under the
laws of this state, including a city, county, school district, or special district created under the Texas
Constitution, Article III, §52(b)(1) or (2), or Article XVI, §59” in 13 TAC §26.5 of the code, must
identify potential SALs through survey of public lands prior to actions that could potentially damage
those SALs.
It is assumed that funding for the proposed highway construction will come in part from the Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA) and, as such, the proposed construction project is also subject to the
provisions of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA). The intent of the
NHPA is to protect significant cultural resources that might be threatened by actions that are federally
funded or permitted, or which occur on federal property. The act, which created the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) and the Advisory Council for Historic Preservation (ACHP), states that the
ACHP must be afforded the chance to comment when any cultural resources eligible for inclusion on the
NRHP are present in an area affected by federal agency actions or actions funded or permitted by federal
agencies.
The federal regulatory process is described in detail in the ACHP regulations (36 CFR 800) and in the
regulations of the agencies and federal divisions engaged in historic preservation. Protection of cultural
resources under federal law is tied to eligibility for the NRHP that depends on site significance as defined
by National Park Service (NPS) rules 36 CFR 60. Although the ACHP is the final arbiter of the

Section 106 process, in practice, the process is typically limited to review and concurrence by the
involved agency and the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), represented in Texas by the THC.
Investigations were conducted in accordance with the First Amended Programmatic Agreement (PA)
among the FHWA, the THC, the ACHP, and TxDOT, as well as the Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) among TxDOT and THC. The survey was designed to comply with appropriate archeological
survey methods as defined in the Department of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983), the
Guidelines of the Council of Texas Archeologists (1987), and the survey standards developed by the THC
in conjunction with the Council of Texas Archeologists (THC n.d.). The primary intent of the survey was
to identify and describe all cultural resources discovered within the APE, evaluate their potential
eligibility for nomination to the NRHP or for formal SAL designation, and should significant cultural
resources be located, make recommendations for future cultural resource management options such as
avoidance, preservation, or further investigations.

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The proposed project area is located in the Rolling Plains ecological region of Texas, which is
characterized by a gently undulating to rolling plain. Elevations across the Rolling Plains range from
approximately 1,000 feet in the eastern margins of the region to 2,200 feet at the base of the Cap Rock
Escarpment on the region’s western edges (Jordan et al. 1984). Climatic conditions in Taylor County are
semi-arid with long, hot summers and mild winters. Rainfall is heaviest in the spring and fall, with
roughly 23 inches of annual rainfall. Open range surrounds the study area.
GEOLOGY
The CR 142 project area is underlain by Permian age Whitehorse Sandstone and Cloud Chief Gypsum,
undivided, which consists of interbedded sandstone, gypsum, sand, and dolomite. There is no recent
alluvium indicated for this location according the Geologic Atlas of Texas (Barnes 1967). However, field
visits by other Blanton & Associates staff indicated that CR 142 is located in cut sections on both sides of
the stream. Profiles of the road cuts suggest that alluvium is present. Given the scale of the geologic map,
it is not surprising that this project area is mapped as containing no recent alluvium. Regionally, recent
alluvium has been shown to have a high potential for containing buried cultural deposits.
SOILS
Soils mapped in the project area are identified as Quinlan soils, sloping. This soil is shallow, welldrained, and found on uplands. A typical profile exhibits approximately six inches of very fine sandy
loam overlaying calcareous sandstone at a depth of roughly 36 inches below ground surface (Richardson
and Girdner 1973). Investigations discovered however that there is a thin (a maximum of 45 centimeters
below ground surface) veneer of sandy clay loam alluvium and recent colluvium overlying caliche or
mottled shaley clay.
VEGETATION
Kent County lies in the Kansan biotic province (Blair 1950). Grass species identified in this area
consisted of rescuegrass (Bromus sp.), johnsongrass (Sorghum halepense), windmillgrass (Chloris
verticillata), and sagebrush (Artemisia sp.). Vegetation in the project area was dominated by honey
mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), though lotebush (Zizyphus obtusifolia), buttonbush (Cephalanthus
occidentalis) and yucca (Yucca sp.) were common.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
A review of records available at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) and on the THC’s
online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas was conducted to determine the presence of any previously
recorded sites or previous project areas within a 1,000-meter radius of the project area. The review
indicated that there are no previously recorded sites or project areas within the 1,000-meter search radius.

METHODS
The intensive archeological surveys on CR 142 involved surface and subsurface investigations of
sufficient intensity to determine the nature, extent, and if possible, the significance of any discovered
cultural resources. Investigations adhered to THC survey standards (n.d.), as well as the guidelines of the
Council of Texas Archeologists (1987), and the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines (NPS
1983). Moreover, the survey was designed and executed in accordance with the PA among the FHWA,
the THC, the ACHP, and TxDOT, as well as the MOU between TxDOT and the THC.
Surface investigations consisted of a 100 percent pedestrian survey of the project area by two
archeologists systematically examining the ground surface for cultural remains. Cutbank profiles were
inspected for the presence of any buried cultural materials, as were profiles on the road cut within the
APE. As there was alluvium reported at the creek, Blanton & Associates arranged backhoe services for
trenching to prospect for buried cultural deposits. However, due to an extremely narrow, eroded, and
steep ROW, the backhoe operator was unable to safely maneuver and not comfortable with blocking the
roadway, which would have been necessary given the narrowness of the ROW. Additionally, inspection
of the area indicated that only shallow alluvium was present and could be excavated by hand so
subsurface investigations consisted of systematic shovel testing and the preparation of shovel columns.
Shovel tests were 30 to 40 centimeters in width and excavated with a square-head shovel. All sediments
removed from shovel tests were screened through ¼-inch wire mesh. All appropriate shovel test data was
recorded on Blanton & Associates shovel test forms and plotted with hand-held global positioning system
(GPS) receivers. Field investigations were thoroughly documented with digital cameras. No cultural
materials were collected so curation was unnecessary.

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS
Intensive survey investigations at Stinking Creek indicated that the existing CR 142 ROW was extremely
narrow and has been extensively disturbed by erosion, and roadway construction and maintenance
activities (Figures 4 and 5). The distance between the ROW boundary fences and the edge of the roadway
was roughly eight to 10 feet, much of which was occupied by deep erosional cuts. As Figure 4 indicates,
deeply eroded ditches occupy the majority of the ROW between the fences and roadway, as well as
significant amounts of colluvium in places that has eroded downhill from the adjacent uplands and into
the ROW (Figure 6). Ground surface visibility throughout the APE was 50 percent or greater.
Surface examination of the APE revealed no prehistoric or historic cultural resources, only occasional
modern roadside debris. Subsurface investigations consisted of the excavation of four shovel tests and
four shovel columns along the face of the road cut (Figures 7 and 8; see Figure 4). Shovel Tests (ST) 1–4
contained 45 centimeters or less of semi-moist and very firm red to reddish brown sandy clay loam or
semi-moist and firm reddish brown sandy loam colluvium overlying a strata of dry and light reddishbrown clay loam with caliche over a third strata of either solid caliche or platy, mottled red and olive gray
clay with eroded sandstone inclusions (Table 1). The excavation of the shovel columns revealed similar
stratigraphy (Table 2). Excavations discovered no buried cultural materials.

Based on the results of field investigations, there are no cultural resources within the APE that would be
impacted by the proposed construction. Given the narrow and disturbed conditions throughout the APE
resulting from erosion, and highway cut-and-fill construction, it is unlikely that any intact, previously
unidentified cultural resources would be impacted during the planned roadway improvements.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Intensive survey efforts found no cultural resources within the existing CR 142 ROW at Stinking Creek.
Shovel testing revealed only a discontinuous veneer of alluvium or recent colluvium overlying ancient
caliche or mottled clay with inclusions of eroding sandstone. The existing ROW has been extensively
disturbed by erosion and highway cut-and fill-construction. Blanton & Associates recommends that, as no
prehistoric or historic cultural resources in the APE would be impacted by the proposed construction, the
project should be allowed to proceed as planned without additional cultural resource investigations.
If it is determined that TxDOT requires additional ROW for the proposed construction or for future
construction projects, then additional cultural resource investigations are recommended for those areas. In
the event that previously unidentified cultural materials are discovered during construction, work in the
immediate area would cease and the TxDOT archeological staff would be contacted to initiate accidental
discovery procedures in accordance with the aforementioned PA and MOU.
