ABSTRACT
On behalf of CP&Y and Williamson County, SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) conducted an
intensive cultural resources survey of the proposed 1.47-mile Mays Street Extension Project in southcentral Williamson County. The project area is located approximately 0.85 mile east-northeast from the
Interstate Highway (IH) 35 and Westinghouse Road intersection in Round Rock, Texas. The proposed
new roadway will be approximately 1.47 miles long, with a 100-foot right-of-way (ROW). Thus, the area
of potential effects (APE) is about 7,762 feet long and averages 100 feet wide, for a total area of 17.8
acres. The depth of impacts has not yet been determined, but road construction typically requires impacts
up to 4 feet, with deeper impacts associated with waterway crossings.
The project involves a small amount of property belonging to the City of Round Rock (at the intersection
of Terravista Parkway and Oakmont Drive), but the remainder is currently private property that will
eventually belong to the project’s sponsor, the City of Georgetown, a political subdivision of the state.
Therefore, the project is subject to the Antiquities Code of Texas, and the work was conducted under
Texas Antiquities Permit No. 6930, with Dr. Judith Cooper serving as the Principal Investigator.
The background review determined that the portion of the proposed APE along Westinghouse Road has
been previously surveyed and that no previously recorded sites are within the APE. Two sites (41WM141
and 41WM834) are recorded within a 1-mile radius of the project area, along with six previously
conducted cultural resources investigations. A review of historic maps determined that no historic-age
resources have been documented within or adjacent to the APE.
The APE is in a semi-rural setting that is quickly becoming urbanized with residential subdivisions and
commercial development. The proposed APE consists of cleared agricultural land or pasture. Recent
aerial photography reveals a parking lot and a possible pipe yard adjacent to the northern end of the APE
and a residential development near the project’s southern terminus. The APE is flanked by agricultural
fields and pasture to the east and west with a few stands of trees in the northern portion of the APE. Four
private driveways also bisect the APE.
SWCA’s investigations consisted of an intensive pedestrian survey with subsurface investigations. The
survey revealed extensive prior disturbances in the extreme northern and southern portions of the APE
from road and ditch construction and maintenance, the installation of buried and overhead utilities, and
modifications related to the installation of a culvert and drainage system. The Texas Historical
Commission’s survey standards require a minimum of 16 shovel test per 1 mile, or a total of 19 for a
project of this size. Based on the significant disturbances mentioned above, 18 shovel tests were
excavated in the APE. No cultural resources were identified during the course of field investigations. As
such, SWCA recommends no further archaeological investigations within the APE.

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the Proposed Mays Street Extension Project

Christina Nielsen and Melissa Garcia conducted
the majority of fieldwork on August 7, 2014. On
September 3, 2015, Matthew Stotts completed
survey of a single tract for which right-of-entry
was initially denied.

INTRODUCTION
On behalf of CP&Y and Williamson County,
SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA)
conducted an intensive cultural resources survey
of the proposed 1.47-mile Mays Street Extension
Project in south-central Williamson County
(Figure 1). The proposed new roadway will be
approximately 1.47 miles long with a 100-foot
right-of-way (ROW). Thus, the area of potential
effects (APE) is about 7,762 feet long and
averages 100 feet wide, for a total area of 17.8
acres. The depth of impacts has not yet been
determined, but road construction typically
requires impacts up to 4 feet, with deeper impacts
associated with waterway crossings.

PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION
The proposed APE is in a semi-rural setting that is
quickly becoming urbanized with residential
subdivisions and commercial development. The
proposed APE consists of cleared agricultural land
or pasture and begins at the intersection of
Westinghouse Road and CR 116 and continues
south-southwest, terminating at the intersection of
Terravista Parkway and Oakmont Drive. Recent
aerial photography reveals a parking lot and
possible pipe yard adjacent to the northern end of
the APE and a residential development near the
project’s southern terminus. The APE is flanked
by agricultural fields and pasture to the east and
west with a few stands of trees in the northern
portion of the APE. Four private driveways also
bisect the APE.

The project involves a small amount of property
belonging to the City of Round Rock (at the
intersection of Terravista Parkway and Oakmont
Drive), but the remainder is currently private
property that will eventually belong to the
project’s sponsor, the City of Georgetown, a
political subdivision of the state. Therefore, the
project is subject to the Antiquities Code of Texas,
and the work was conducted under Texas
Antiquities Permit No. 6930 with Dr. Judith
Cooper serving as the Principal Investigator.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The majority of the underlying geology of the
APE is mapped as Late Cretaceous-age (Gulfian)
Del Rio Clay and Georgetown Limestone deposits,
undivided (Barnes 1974). A small area in the
northeastern portion of the APE is mapped as Late
Cretaceous-age Eagle Ford Formation and Buda
Limestone deposits, undivided. Del Rio Clay
deposits are calcareous and gypsiferous, with
pyrite and some thin lenses of highly calcareous
siltstone approximately 40 to 70 feet thick (Barnes
1974). Georgetown Limestone deposits are mostly
limestone with some marl, 30 to 80 feet thick.
Eagle Ford Formation deposits are shale and
limestone on top of siltstone and very fine-grained
sandstone approximately 75 to 200 feet thick
(Barnes 1974). Buda Limestone deposits are fine
grained, marly interbeds. The formation is 45 to
100 feet thick (Barnes 1974).

As noted above, the APE is approximately 1.47
miles long, and it begins about 1,000 feet north of
the intersection of Westinghouse Road and County
Road (CR) 116 (Rabbit Hill Road), and
approximately 0.85 miles east-northeast from the
Interstate Highway (IH) 35 and Westinghouse
Road intersection (Figure 2). The southern
terminus is located at the intersection of Terravista
Parkway and Oakmont Drive. The APE also
includes about 1,000 feet along Westinghouse
Road, and would cross two unnamed tributaries of
Chandler Branch.
These investigations included a background
archival review and an intensive pedestrian survey
with subsurface investigations. The purpose of the
work was to locate and identify all prehistoric and
historic archaeological sites in the APE, establish
vertical and horizontal site boundaries as
appropriate with regard to the APE, and evaluate
the significance and eligibility of any site recorded
within the property. SWCA archaeologists

Atlas (Atlas) online database. As a part of the
review, an SWCA archaeologist reviewed the
Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT)
Historic Overlay Maps, a mapping/geographic
information system (GIS) with historic maps and
resource information covering most portions of the
state (Foster et al. 2006).

The APE soils are mapped as 25 percent Heiden
clay, eroded, 20 percent Doss silty clay, 16 percent
Houston Black Clay, 14 percent Denton silty clay,
10 percent Heiden extremely stony clay, 8 percent
Ferris-Heiden complex, severely eroded, and 6
percent Fairlie clay (Natural Resources
Conservation Service [NRCS] 2014; Figure 3).
The Doss soils are associated with hill slopes and
dissected plateaus while the rest of the soils are
found on upland slopes. The Heiden series consists
of deep soils that are well-drained and very slowly
permeable. These soils are found on nearly level to
moderately steep uplands (NRCS 2014). The Doss
series consists of well-drained, moderately slow
permeable, shallow to weakly cemented limestone,
that formed in calcareous loamy and clayey
residuum derived from marls and limestone. These
very gently to moderately sloping soils occur on
hill slopes on dissected plateaus (NRCS 2014).
The Houston Black series consists of very deep,
moderately well-drained, and very slowly
permeable soils that formed from weakly
consolidated calcareous clays and marls of
Cretaceous Age. These soils are found on nearly
level to moderately sloping uplands (NRCS 2014).
The Denton series consist of deep, well-drained,
and slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey
materials over residuum that weathered from
limestone bedrock. These nearly level or gently
sloping soils are found on uplands (NRCS 2014).
The Ferris series consists of deep, well-drained,
and very slowly permeable soils that formed from
weakly consolidated calcareous dense clays and
shales. These soils are found on sloping or
moderately steep uplands (NRCS 2014). The
Fairlie series consists of deep, moderately welldrained, and very slowly permeable soils found on
nearly level to gently sloping uplands (NRCS
2014).

In addition to identifying recorded archaeological
sites, the review included information on the
following types of cultural resources: National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) properties,
State Archaeological Landmarks (SALs), Official
Texas Historical Markers, Registered Texas
Historic Landmarks, cemeteries, and local
neighborhood surveys. The archaeologist also
examined the Natural Resources Conservation
Service (NRCS) web soil survey (NRCS 2014)
and the Geologic Atlas of Texas, Austin Sheet
(Barnes 1974).

FIELD METHODS
SWCA’s investigations consisted of an intensive
pedestrian survey of the APE with surface and
subsurface
investigations.
Archaeologists
examined the ground surface and erosion profiles
and exposures for cultural resources. Subsurface
investigations involved shovel testing in settings
with the potential to contain buried cultural
materials. For linear projects with 100-foot-wide
corridors, the THC’s survey standards require a
minimum of 16 shovel tests per 1 mile, thus
requiring a minimum of 19 shovel tests for a
project of this size, dependent on variables such as
disturbances and soils.
The shovel tests were approximately 30 cm in
diameter and excavated to culturally sterile
deposits, bedrock, or impassible basal clay,
whichever came first. The matrix from each shovel
test was screened through ¼-inch mesh, and the
location of each excavation was plotted using a
hand-held global positioning system (GPS)
receiver. Each shovel test was recorded on a
standardized form to document the excavations.

METHODS
BACKGROUND REVIEW
SWCA conducted a thorough background cultural
resources and environmental literature search of
the APE. An SWCA archaeologist reviewed the
Round Rock (3097-312), Texas, U.S. Geological
Survey
(USGS)
7.5-minute
topographic
quadrangle maps on the Texas Historical
Commission’s (THC) Texas Archeological Sites

SWCA performed a non-collection survey.
Artifacts encountered were to be tabulated,
analyzed, and documented in the field, but not
collected.

APE just west of an unnamed drainage. An
additional private road is present on the 1934
Williamson County Soils and 1951 Round Rock
USGS maps in the northern section of the current
APE (Figures 5 and 6). No structures are
illustrated immediately adjacent to the APE on
these maps; however, several structures are
located south of the APE at the end of private
roads.

RESULTS
BACKGROUND REVIEW
The background review determined that a small
portion of the APE has been previously surveyed
and that no previously recorded sites are within the
APE. Two sites are recorded within a 1-mile
radius, along with six previously conducted
cultural resources investigations (Atlas 2014). A
survey was conducted along Westinghouse Road
in 2007 by archaeologists from SWCA (Chavez
and Miller 2008). The entire section of
Westinghouse Road within the current APE was
surveyed during this investigation and no cultural
resource sites were recorded within the current
APE. The closest site to the APE is site
41WM834, located approximately 0.85 mile west
of the APE, east of Chandler Branch. Site
41WM834 is a sparse prehistoric lithic scatter
containing five Edwards Chert flakes (Atlas 2014).
No diagnostic artifacts or features were
encountered and no further work was
recommended at the site.

FIELD SURVEY
On August 7, 2014 and September 3, 2015,
SWCA archaeologists conducted an intensive
pedestrian and subsurface survey of the 1.47-mile
proposed Mays Street Extension APE (Figure 7).
Field investigations encountered generally open,
cattle pasture, with vegetation dominated by
grasses, mesquite, juniper, broomweed, and cactus
(Figure 8). Ground visibility throughout the APE
ranged from 10 to 60 percent, averaging about 35
percent.
Subsurface disturbance is prevalent within the
northern 30 percent of the APE. Surface exposures
along Westinghouse Road and CR 116 revealed
prevalent gravel fill associated with the
construction of the two roads. Overhead utilities
parallel both sides of Westinghouse Road and a
drainage ditch has been constructed along the
northern side of the road (Figure 9). A buried
pipeline has been installed along the western side
of CR 116 and two overhead utilities are present
along the eastern side of the road (Figures 10 and
11). A drainage ditch and culvert are also present
along the westernmost edge of the APE along CR
116 (Figure 12). Additionally, a small concrete
plant is located within an approximately 1-acre
section of the proposed new ROW just south of
Westinghouse Road (Figure 13).

HISTORIC MAP REVIEW
The historic overlay review of maps dating to
1893, 1918, 1928, 1934 and 1951 determined that
no historic-age resources have been documented
within or adjacent to the APE (Foster et al. 2006).
The 1893 Georgetown USGS and 1918
Georgetown US Army Corps of Engineers maps
illustrate two unnamed drainages in the APE
location, but no roads or structures. The 1928
Round Rock USGS map depicts three unnamed
roads within the current APE (Figure 4). The road
at the northern end of the APE is presumably
Westinghouse Road, based on its configuration,
and the road at the southern terminus appears to be
Terravista Parkway. A private road bisects the

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the Proposed Mays Street Extension Project

In the southern portion of the APE, SWCA
observed land modifications related to the
installation of an overhead utility along the
western edge of the ROW and the construction of
a culvert and associated drainage system bisecting
the ROW (Figure 15). The entire area has been
cleared of vegetation. Due to these disturbances,
shovel tests were excavated between the centerline
and eastern edge of the ROW. Shovel tests were
excavated to between 3 and 35 cmbs, averaging 20
cmbs. Most shovel tests encountered soils that
were dark gray to dark brown clay loams with a
high concentration of possibly imported gravel and
were terminated at degrading bedrock. The large
percentage of possibly imported gravel and
shallow bedrock suggest that the area may have
been graded and/or partially filled in for the
construction of the culvert and drainage. In
addition, shovel test 3 (ST 3) encountered modern
plastic at 10 cmbs, supporting the idea that
subsurface modification has occurred in the recent
past.

The disturbances within the northern third of the
APE have reduced the potential for encountering
intact cultural resources, as impacts have altered
the surface and subsurface. Two shovel tests (ST
13 and 14) were attempted along the eastern edge
of CR 116; however, disturbed soils exhibiting
heavy mottling were encountered (Table 1). The
remainder of the northern third of the APE was
surveyed and deemed unnecessary for shovel
testing based on the extensive prior disturbances
from road and ditch construction and maintenance,
and from the installation of buried and overhead
utilities. In addition, SWCA surveyed a 200-foot
corridor for the Westinghouse Road Expansion
Project in 2007 (Chavez and Miller 2008; see
Figure 7). Two shovel tests were excavated within
the current APE during these investigations and
encountered dark brown clay loam on top of
degrading bedrock at 30 to 35 cm below surface
(cmbs). No cultural materials were recovered.
The remaining 16 shovel tests were excavated
within the portion of the APE that will require the
acquisition of new ROW. This area is open,
upland cattle pasture exhibiting surface
disturbances from vegetation clearing and
construction of two-track roads. Shovel tests in
this area were excavated to between 10 and 40
cmbs, averaging 20 cmbs. Most shovel tests
encountered soils that were brown to dark grayish
brown clay loams and were terminated at
impenetrable clay or gravel.

THC’s survey standards for projects of this size
recommend 16 shovel tests per linear mile, or, in
this case 19 shovel tests. Thus, the survey deviated
from the standards based on the observed prior
disturbances mentioned above.

The central portion of the new ROW is bisected by
an unnamed, shallow tributary of Chandler
Branch. Shovel tests excavated on either side of
the drainage revealed shallow clayey soil and no
recent alluvium. Multiple push piles are present in
the area, indicating moderate impacts as a result of
land clearing activity. A ditch has also been
excavated along the eastern property boundary
fenceline, providing an extensive horizontal soil
profile (Figure 14).

APE, providing an extensive profile of gravelly
clay over shallow, degrading bedrock.

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the Proposed Mays Street Extension Project

During the archaeological survey, SWCA
archaeologists examined the entire 1.47 miles of
the APE. The THC’s survey standards require a
minimum of 16 shovel test per 1 mile of 100-foot
corridor, or 19 shovel tests for a project of this
size. The survey deviated from the standards,
excavating only 18 shovel tests based on the
observed prior disturbances and the results of a
previously conducted survey at this location
(Chavez and Miller 2008). All 18 shovel tests
were negative for cultural material. Portions of the
APE have been heavily impacted from the
construction and maintenance of roads and
drainages and by the installation of overhead and
underground utilities. The natural setting and
disturbances within the survey area have reduced
the potential for encountering intact cultural
resources, as impacts have altered the surface and
subsurface setting and landscape.

Figure 15. Overview of modern disturbances
including an overhead utility and culvert in the
southern portion of the APE, located north of
Terravista Parkway, facing south.

SWCA’s
intensive
archaeological
survey
determined that no cultural resources will be
affected by construction activities within the APE.
Given the negative results of the survey, SWCA
recommends that no further archaeological
investigations are warranted and the proposed
construction should be allowed to proceed as
planned.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
SWCA conducted an intensive archaeological
survey of the 1.47-mile proposed Mays Street
Extension APE located approximately 0.85 mile
east-northeast from the IH 35 and Westinghouse
Road intersection in Round Rock, Texas. The
project involves a small amount of property
belonging to the City of Round Rock (at the
intersection of Terravista Parkway and Oakmont
Drive), but the remainder is currently private
property that will eventually belong to the
project’s sponsor, the City of Georgetown, a
political subdivision of the state. Therefore, the
project is subject to the Antiquities Code of Texas,
and the work was conducted under Texas
Antiquities Permit No. 6930.
The background review determined that a small
portion of the APE has been previously surveyed
and that no previously recorded sites are within the
APE. Two sites (41WM141 and 41WM834) are
recorded within a 1-mile radius, along with six
previously
conducted
cultural
resources
investigations. A review of historic maps of the
APE determined that no historic-age resources
have been documented within or adjacent to the
APE.
