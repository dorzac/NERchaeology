INTRODUCTION
"Style" is a frequently misunderstood term.
Although
it can refer to individual idiosyncrasies of wording and
phrasing, it is also used to refer to such matters as punc­
tuation, layout, capitalization, and other mechanics of
typing or type setting.
It is the sense of the "mechanics
of style" that is addressed in this report.
The reigning authority on the mechanics of style is The
University of Chicago Press, A ManuaZ of Style, which is
often called "the Chicago Style Manual." While the Chicago
Style Manual is an excellent sourcebook for any editor, it
does not always cover topics of concern to archeology, for
example, the rendering of radiocarbon dates in print.
For
that reason editors of archeological reports must make
decisions and develop a style to serve their own special
needs.
Stylistic conventions are based on general or tradi­
tional usage; therefore, many standards are quite arbitrary.
After checking several authorities on style, one may dis­
cover that there are subtle variations and, indeed, that
there is open disagreement on some points.
This being the
case, we at TAS have, over the years, developed our own
conventions of style.
This manual has been produced primarily for TAS person­
nel; however, it may be of interest to similar organizations
performing contract archeology.
Inasmuch as archeologists
cannot agree on the proper spelling of "archeology," it is
highly doubtful that there will be common agreement on
matters of style.
But, for those who are unfamiliar with
stylistic conventions, this Bulletin may serve as a time­
saving guide.

DISPLAY LINES

2. Display Lines
Display lines are single words and short phrases which
appear as:
A. Titles
title page and first page of main text
B. Running heads
chapter and section titles displayed at the top of a
text page and repeated throughout the chapter or
section
C. Headings
internal headings for major topic divisions in the
text
D. Date lines
date of publication on title page
E. Figure captions
The rules for capitalization and punctuation which apply
for text materials do not always apply for display lines.
For example, the date line on the title page is typed out as:
April 1978
Do not separate the month and year with a comma.
3. Page Layout
For the most part we have stayed with a page layout that
is identical to a standard typed ms. page.
In printing,
layout standards vary since the typographer can choose among
a variety of type styles.
The type styles available to
those of us using a typewriter are limited, and the most
variation that we usually have is the difference between
pica and elite spacing and type.
Therefore most of our
creative work must be done within an 8~ x 11 inch page size
and with only 2 type sizes.

2

PAGE LAYOUT

Publishers strive for a pleasing balance between white
space and printed space to give a page balance. We achieve
what we consider to be a pleasing balance by using elite
type with pica spacing and leaving the following margins:
11/4 - binding edge
1 3/4 - top and bottom
I 1/8 - outside edge
We bal~nce the rather large top and bottom margins by the
placement of a neat line, running head and page number (see
sample page following).
When typing the text never leave single lines or single
words at the top or bottom of a page.
If a new paragraph
is started at the bottom of the page, type at least two
lines on the page.
Occasionally it is necessary to sacri­
fice even spacing to achieve the correct division of words
and lines of text.
4. Tables and Figures
See following sample pages.
5. Interior Spacing:
A. Review drafts - basically a complete and final draft.
Headings are simplified; we do not bother with
italicized headings.
Text is double spaced.
Illustra­
tions, photos, maps, tables are enumerated in table of
contents and inserted in their proper place if they
are finished - if they are not finished, they are
indicated by separate sheets for each item.
All the
parts are as complete as possible.
B. Limited interest reports - a publishable report which
follows TAS style but is given less production time.
For this reason we design them to be printed on one
side of the paper only.
They will have simple, cen­
tered running heads. Double space between paragraphs.
major section - new page - 12 lines from top of page.
major headings
(1) followed by 3 lines.
minor headings - preceded by 3 lines, followed by 2.

PHYSIOGRAPHIC SETTING
is a series of Pennsylvanian and Permian carbonate cuestas
similar to the Sacramento Mountains but reaches a maximum
elevation of only about 5700 feet m.s.l.
The Hueco Mountain
complex additionally differs in lacking the bajada, in having
smaller alluvial fans and in having a radial drainage.
Fig­
ure 111-7 shows that the western part of the range is made up
predominately of the Tularosa Basin J a bolson complex with an
interior closed centripetal drainage, interrupted by the
radial drainages of a few minor isolated hogback and cuesta
ridges.
Just barely within the western boundary of McGregor
Range is part of the Jarilla Mountain complex, an inlier of
igneous and carbonate rocks characterized by a radial drain­
age.
The climate of McGregor Ran~iS typical of the arid
Southwest.
Rainfall on the vall y. floor is sporadic and
occurs predominately during the I t
summer months as cloud­
bursts.
In contrast, rainfal\i~. he Sacramento Mountains is
orographic and more evenly di:~uted than that on the
vally floor.
Present meteo~OgiC data provided by the
National Weather Bureau in
Paso is summarized in Figure
111-9, which ~hows the m~a nual rainfall to be 8.32 inches.
Annual evaporation from
a y Las Cruces is 92.4 inches
(Gardner 1951).
Doughert
(1975) determined the annual evap­
oration, at a station ~ miles northwest of El Paso, to be
102.57 inches.
ThU~ a oration for this area is about an
order of magnitude re er than its precipitation.
The
Holocene geomorphoI g and present-day geoscape is a direct
consequence of these environmental factors.
SURFACE GEOLOGY AND STRATIGRAPHY OF McGREGOR RANGE
The geologic map shown in Figure 111-10 illustrates that
the bedrock of McGregor Range is as varied in lithology as it
is in age.
This geologic map was compiled using data from
Dane and Bachman (1965), Pray (1961), Hardy (1958), N.A.S.A.
space photographs, gravity lineament analysis of Decker et
al. (1975), low altitude oblique photographs taken during
this project with a Nikon F-2 5S mm. camera~ and by standard
geological field techniques.
•
The areal extent of the surface geology is indicated in
Table 111-8, compiled gravimetrically from the geologic map
which shows the outcrop to a large degree, although thin

SITE M-85
Robert F. Scott IV

(3)
INTRODUCTION
In the course of the McGregor Range archeological assessment,
two adult burials were recovered from site M-83, located in Red
House Tanks Canyon of the Hueco Mountains.
Burial 1 was found erod­
ing from the surface of M-83 into a nearby arroyo.
It was excavated
in Ausust, 1975.
Buraal 2 was located 100 meters sourh of Burial 1
in the same arroyo.
Burial 1
Erosion had destroyed all of burial I above the fourth lumbar
vetebra.
The skelton, a mature adult, was placed in a sitting,
tightly flexed position, facing south.

ITALICS

C. There are some Latin terms which are regularly used in
academic writing.
Since contract archeology was born
in academia we, too, regularly use these terms in our
technical reports.
At TAS we tried, for a short period,
to Anglicize all Latin terms.
For example: we used
"and others" in place of et al.
However, these changes
never became comfortable and always seemed to intrude
on the reader's attention.
Therefore we returned to
the use of Latin terms.
The question of which terms to italicize and which to
put in Roman was examined and it was discovered that
Webster's dictionary, as the reigning authority, has
interpreted some Latin terms as English by frequency
of usage and some are still interpreted as foreign
terms.
While Webster's interpretations seem to us to
have a high degree of ambiguity, we are not prepared
to argue the matter.
Rather, we made some arbitrary
decisions concerning which terms to italicize.
D. Set in italics:
1. Scientific names and typologies for botany, archeol­
ogy, etc.
2. Foreign names and terms.
3. Titles of published works, names of newspapers.
4. Latin abbreviations:

i.e.
aa.
et.al.
sia

af.

e. g.

5. DO NOT ITALICIZE etc. or

6. The heading and body of the abstract when it is

LITHIC MATERIALS FROM MCGREGOR RANGE:
MINERAL TYPES AND THEIR SOURCE AREAS
John D. Pigott
Alan R. Dulaney

ABSTRACT
An analysis is made of lithic artifacts based on their min­
eralogical character and an attempt is made to identify the geo­
logic source area within McGregor Range of the constituent raw
materials.
Finished lithic tools~ b h chipped stone implements
and ground stone utensils~ were gra ped into one of a dozen mineral
categories and their distribution p otted~ 1) within each site
investigated~ 2) within site types a
categorized for this re­
search~ 3) within PhYSiOgraPhi~eg· ons of the Study Area" 4) with­
in ground-stone artifact tyg" a
5) within chipped stone pro­
jectile points.
On the bas
0
these distributions it is tenta­
tively concluded that r~ma rials for artifacts tended to be
locally available to th
ites where the artifacts were found;
e~ceptions to this dist
b ion profile., suggesting trade networks
or mobility of prehif.Xr
populations., occurred most commonly in
Paleo-Indian materia,_,'

?

DISCUSSION

Stone tools manufactured and used by prehistoric populations
constitute an extremely important source of archeological informa­
tion.
The analysis of these items of material culture usually in­
volves morphologi~al description of the tools and of the ciebris
reSUlting from their manufacture.
This results in information
concerning tool use as well as tool making.
The analysis under­
taken here differs in that it represents an attempt at identifica­
tion of the provenance* of lithic materials used for the tools.
*The word provenance has essentially the same meaning as the word
provenience but the usage of these two words in this report does
indicate a substantial difference in meaning.
The standard arch­
eological usage of the word provenienc~ to indicate the physical

2. A great many government documents are published
blind, without authorships acknowledged.
In all
such cases, cite the document by the publishing
agency.
For example:
U.s. Army Corps of Engineers
U.S. Congress
Texas Water Development Board
Lower Colorado River Authority
G. Privately published works:
For documents which have been privately published, use
a standard reference citation and in place of the
publisher note:
1. published privately by the author, or
2. the name of the printer, if it is known.
H. How to determine the proper in text citation.
In text citations always consist of an author's name
and date.
If required they also contain a page number.
In making the decision concerning a citation, first
determine the author or authorship and second determine
the date.
Use this information to determine the proper
placement of the citation in the References Cited.
For example:
(Smith 1977)
(USGS 1965)
(U.S. Bureau of the Census 1880)
(Dona Ana County Records 1895a)
(Dills N.d.)
The entire coding system for the references is based on
the author's name and the date of publication.
