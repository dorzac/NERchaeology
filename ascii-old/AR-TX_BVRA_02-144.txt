ABSTRACT
Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) conducted archaeological
survey and monitoring at the Wallace Pack Unit, Grimes County, Texas in
October 2004 under Antiquities Permit 3570. This investigation examined the site
of a proposed lift station and 4498 feet of water and sewer lines within a 10 acre
tract on property owned and managed by the Texas Department of Criminal
Justice (TDCJ). The entire project area is in clay soils with no sandy topsoil.
Therefore, the methods employed by the field survey crew were designed to look
for prehistoric sites buried in the Brazos River flood plain. The site of the
proposed lift station had already been subjected to excavation and partial
construction, making examination of the undisturbed surface impossible in this
area. No evidence of a buried prehistoric site was found in any portion of the
project area, and no artifacts were collected.

INTRODUCTION
The TDCJ proposes to construct a wastewater treatment plant, lift station,
and associated water and sewer lines on the Wallace Pack Unit in southern
Grimes County, Texas (Figure 1). The Major Work Request number for this
project is 02697004, and the Texas Pollution Discharge Elimination System
(TPDES) permit number is 13743-001. Topographic coverage is provided by the
USGS 7.5’ quadrangle, Courtney, Texas (3096-141) (Figure 2).
The wastewater treatment plant will be approximately 50 x 66 feet in size
and 11 feet in depth. It will be constructed on top of 12 foot of fill. Informants
stated that this fill was taken from an area just to the south of the project area
prior to this project. It is believed that the lake shown in Figure 3 represents the
site where the fill was taken. The proposed construction will not affect the
original ground surface due to the height of the artificial surface created by the
fill. The lift station will be 14 x 16 feet in aerial extent and between 15 and 18
feet in depth. The depth of the 4498 feet of water and sewer lines will vary
between 0 and 14 feet, and they will be placed in a two-foot wide trench. The
project area is depicted in Figure 3 that is based on an engineering map provided
by Bryan Construction Company.
Significant archaeological sites have been recorded in this part of Texas,
and one prehistoric site (41GM404) is located approximately .625 miles to the
northeast of the proposed construction site. The project area is located in clay
soils in the Brazos River flood plain. Since buried sites in similar settings have
been found in nearby areas, an archaeological survey was requested by the
Texas Historical Commission (THC) in a letter dated March 21, 2004. In order to
satisfy this legal obligation, the TDCJ, through HBC Terracon, retained BVRA to
perform this service. Antiquities Permit 3570 was awarded to BVRA for this
project.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
General
4

Grimes County is located in the southeastern part of central Texas and is
approximately 800 square miles in size. Adjacent counties are Brazos to the
west, Madison to the north, Waller to the south, and Walker to the east. The
western part of the county drains into the Navasota and Brazos rivers, while the
Trinity River and Bedias Creek collect water from streams in the northeast corner
of the county. The southeastern part of the county drains toward the San Jacinto
River. Most areas in Grimes County are gently sloping to sloping, but some are
nearly level, and other areas are moderately steep and steep. Elevations in the
county range from 180 feet along the Brazos River to 460 feet northeast of the
community of Singleton. The above information was taken from the Soil Survey
of Grimes County, Texas (Greenwade 1996) and the Texas Almanac (Kingston
and Harris 1983).
Soil Descriptions
According to the Soil Legend in the Soil Survey of Grimes County, Texas
(Greenwade 1996), the soils in the county were formed mostly under post oak
trees or grasses. Those soils that formed under post oak trees are mostly light
colored, fine sandy loam and loamy fine sand. Those that formed under grasses
are mostly dark fine sandy loam, clay loam, and clay. These soils are subject to
water erosion.
The project area is located in either the Mabank-Wilson-Burleson unit
(dominantly clayey and loamy soils on uplands and terraces) or the BrazoriaNorwood unit (clayey and loamy soils on flood plains) (Greenwade 1996:Sheet
39). The majority of the project area is located within one soil type, Brazoria clay,
depressional (Bp). Minor types include Chazos loamy fine sand, 1 to 5 percent
slopes (ChC), Crockett fine sandy loam (CrC), Norwood silt loam (NoA), Robco
loamy fine sand (RoC), and Wilson clay loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes (WIA).
Brazoria clay, depressional is a very deep, nearly level soil found along
the flood plain of the Brazos River (Greenwade 1996:29). Typically, the surface
layer is dark brown clay about 20 inches thick. The subsoil, from a depth of 20 to
40 inches, is dark reddish-brown clay. The underlying material, from a depth of
40 to 65 inches, is reddish-brown clay. The soil is moderately alkaline and
calcareous throughout. This soil is somewhat poorly drained. It is ponded for
prolonged periods during rainy seasons. Permeability is very slow, and the
available water capacity is high. Water infiltrates the soil rapidly when it is dry
and has cracks, but infiltrates it very slowly when it is wet and does not have
cracks. No information for clays below 65 inches is given in the soil survey.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
According to Biesaart et al. (1985), Grimes County is located within the
Southeast Texas cultural-geographical region, and it is part of the Southeast
Texas Archeological Study Region as defined by Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993).
In 1985, this region contained 1630 sites (8.06% of the region) and was ranked
5th in the state. Grimes County was also 5th in the region with 94 recorded
archaeological sites (Biesaart et al. 1985). At the time of this survey, 414
prehistoric and historic sites had been recorded in the county (TARL files). The
vast majority of sites in the county were located and recorded by archaeologists
from Texas A&M University and the private contract firm Espey, Huston &
Associates, Inc. on property belonging to the Texas Municipal Power Agency
(TMPA) between 1975 and the closing of the mine in the 1990s. These studies
involved intensive survey, testing, and mitigation. Prehistoric sites present
ranged in age from Paleoindian times through the Late Prehistoric period of
Texas prehistory and were found on a variety of landforms such as small knolls
on floodplains, T-1 terraces, and uplands. Historic sites include Anglo-American
and African-American farmsteads and house sites, log cabins, and two 19th
century resorts (Piedmont Springs and Kellum Springs) associated with natural
sulphur waters believed to contain healing properties.
Although no formal survey involving the project area by a professional
archaeologist has been conducted, the contract firm Antiquities Planning &
Consulting carried out one study in the vicinity in 1998 (Antiquities Planning &
Consulting 1989). Five acres were examined, and one Late Prehistoric site
(41GM404) was found on a low sandy hill overlooking the first terrace of Sandy
Creek about 1 km northwest of the confluence of this stream and Grassy Creek,
two of the major tributaries in the Brazos River flood plain. No cultural features
were observed. Artifacts noted include flakes, a ceramic body sherd, and a
hammer stone. The researchers estimated that site had been disturbed through
plowing and, 50% of the site has been removed through borrowing of sand. The
depth of the cultural deposits was found to be 40 based on shovel tests. No
further investigations were recommended, as the proposed borrow pit will not
affect this site.

Site 41GM404 is typical of Late Prehistoric sites in the general area, being
located on a sandy knoll or terrace adjacent to a stream. This area probably
served as campsites where stone tool refurbishing was a major activity. Little
can be said about the daily activities except it is reasonable to assume that
houses were probably present and the economy was based on hunting and
gathering. Pottery was made from local clays, and the completed vessels were
probably used for storage of food and/or water. Stone tools used for hunting and
other domestic tasks were fashioned from cobbles often found in gravel deposits
along the larger streams. That this site has been disturbed through quarrying for
sand is not unusual. The author has observed numerous prehistoric sites in
Grimes and nearby counties that have been greatly affected by quarrying.
Another common form of disturbance is related to plowing associated with
agricultural activities in the early part of the century. In a few cases, sites have
been disturbed by collectors searching for artifacts to add to personal collections.
A detailed discussion of previous work in the county is not necessary for a
negative report. However, mention of relevant reports is made here, and the
interested reader is referred to the statistical overview by Biesaart et al. (1985),
Archeology in the Eastern Planning Region, Texas: A Planning Document
(Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993) published by the THC and several contract reports
documenting work at TMPA such as Bond (1977, 1981), Brown et al. (1987),
Davis (1981), Glander et al. (1986), and Rogers et al. (1990).

METHODS
Prior to entering the field, a search of the TARL records was conducted to
identify any previously recorded archaeological sites in or near the project area.
The forms for those sites relevant to this project were examined, and certain
contract reports were reviewed. The proposed methods were discussed with
William A. Martin, Staff Archaeologist at the THC, prior to obtaining an Antiquities
Permit from that agency. The methods to be employed for this project are
dictated by the Minimum Survey Standards for Project Areas of 200 Acres or
Less as published by the THC. Since construction had already begun, the
Principal Investigator referred to the THC for guidance. The decision was made
to monitor ongoing construction and examine all exposed profiles dug by the
heavy equipment on site. Shovel testing of the dense clays was not considered
practical. Not all of the water and sewer line will be installed quickly. Therefore,
when possible, these areas were examined through trenches excavated by a
trackhoe.
Wastewater Treatment Plant
Construction of the wastewater treatment plant will be restricted to the fill
material above the natural ground surface. Therefore, the survey crew did not
examine this site.
Lift Station
At the time of this investigation, construction of the lift station was in
progress (Figure 4), and the location of the station was on the edge of the fill.
The survey crew examined the disturbed earth for evidence of buried cultural
materials within the exposed profiles and displaced cultural materials in the
disturbed soil adjacent to the site of the proposed facility. Because of the
previous extensive disturbance, trackhoe trenching was not necessary to view
wall profiles. The area was documented through field notes and digital
photography. No attempt was made to screen the dense clays that form the
surface and subsurface soils in this area.

Water and Sewer Lines
Excavation of the trenches for the four-inch water line was underway when
the field survey crew arrived on site. Surface exposure was excellent; therefore,
this area was visually inspected for the presence of buried cultural materials.
Those areas along the route of the water and sewer lines where construction had
not taken place were examined with a trackhoe, and all trenches were excavated
to the depth of the proposed construction. Profiles were drawn in the field. In all,
six trenches were excavated with the trackhoe. Each trench was 10 meters long
and 4 meters deep. The location of the six trenches is depicted in Figure 3, and
soil profiles of each trench appear as Appendix I. The area was documented
through field notes and digital photography. No attempt was made to screen the
dense clays that form the surface and subsurface soils in this area. Figure 5
illustrates construction of the 4-inch water line.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
According to the records check at TARL, no archaeological sites have
been recorded within the boundaries of the current project area, and there is no
indication that a professional archaeologist has investigated the area. Only one
previously recorded site (41GM404) is plotted on the TARL maps within ½
kilometer of the project area (see Archaeological Background above). It is known
from previous work by archaeologist Bradley F. Bowman that buried sites are
present in the clay soils that form the Brazos River flood plain in portions of
Brazos County. There is no record of this site type on the river in Grimes
County.
The survey and monitoring activities did not locate any buried sites in the
current project area, and no terraces or knolls with sandy soils were observed in
the flat flood plain. BVRA hypothesizes that this area was not selected by
prehistoric groups for a campsite or other form of utilization because of the lack
of sandy topsoil and distance from water, or the clay soils below the surface predate human occupation in this part of Texas.

11

RECOMMENDATIONS
No archaeological sites were found within the project area. Therefore, it is
recommended that construction be allowed to proceed as planned. Should
cultural materials be encountered during construction work must cease until the
THC and BVRA evaluate the area of the find in consultation with the TDCJ.
