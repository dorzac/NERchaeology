from the Twilla Bison Kill Site,
Hall County, Texas

ABSTRACT
Three radiocarbon dates from the Twilla Site (41HL1) in Hall County, Texas
are reported and compared to previous dates from Twilla and three other bison kill
sites in the upper Red River-Pease River drainage of the Texas Panhandle. Some
inconsistencies suggest that these new dates must be used with caution. Nonetheless, the dates now available from the Red and Pease River drainage bison kill sites
suggest that dart points were used for bison kills during the Late Archaic and early
centuries of the Woodland/Neoindian (Late Prehistoric) periods in the lower Texas
Panhandle.

INTRODUCTION: PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

Since 1977 a single radiocarbon date has been available from each of the
Twilla, Collier, Bell and Strong bison kill sites in the Texas Panhandle (Hughes
1977). This report announces three more radiocarbon dates from the Twilla site. The
Twilla site (41HL1 in the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory site files; A73 in the Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum site files) is almost 5 km (3 miles)
east of Turkey, Texas, and about 1.5 km (1 mile) above the mouth of a dry arroyo
that drains into Mockingbird Draw and Cottonwood Creek, a tributary of the North
Pease River ~igure 1). The bone bed was reported by I. R. Twilla to Curtis Tunnell
who visited the site several times during 1953. Two Lange points were collected
from the surface of this site (Tunnell and Hughes 1955), and on March 29, Curtis
Tunnell and Jack T. Hughes recovered two retouched flakes and two "percussion
flaked fragments" from the surface near the 6-meter-long (20 foot) exposure of the
bone bed. From a single testpit, one large unifacial retouched flake of Ogallala chert
was recovered directly associated with the bones. Additional points were collected
from the surface on unknown dates before 1968 (Collins 1968). Samples of bone
from the 30-cm-(1 foot)-thick bone bed were collected but were not submitted for
radiocarbon dating immediately.
Test excavations were conducted at the TwiUa site between August 10 and
September 5,1968, under the supervision of Billy R. Harrison. The testing of Twilla
and several other bison sites in the rolling red-bed plains of the lower Panhandle was
supported by funds provided by the Office of the State Archeologist, which was then
part of the Texas Building Commission, to West Texas State University. At Twilla,
a grid of eight 5x5 ft. squares was laid over the western two-thirds of the site. The

overburden was removed to within one foot of the bones as an undifferentiated unit;
small hand tools were used to expose elements, and measured drawings were
maintained for all exposed bones (Hughes 1977:4). Field records indicate the
possible presence of two bone beds separated by a thin horizon of sterile silt (Hughes
1989:187).
David and Jack Hughes revisited in the site in 1977 to record the site location
accurately for the Panhandle-Plains site files, to obtain soil samples, and to examine
the geologic setting of the site in preparation for analysis and drafting of a report.
Detailed analyses of excavated remains from the Twilla (41HL1), Doc Bell
(41H~5), Strong (41CG31) and Collier (41HL64) sites together with surface
materials from Hoover (41HH12), Sitter (41DY18), Finch (41DY19), R. O. Ranch
(41DY20), and Buzzard’s Roost (41CG30) sites were the basis of an M.A. thesis on
bison kills in the lower Texas Panhandle (Hughes 1977). Except for the maintenance

of separate field maps, the bison elements and cultural materials from the possible
two layers at Twilla were not segregated by layer during the 1968 excavation or
during subsequent storage, processing, analysis, or reporting.
The excavations at Twilla yielded 1,647 partially articulated and disarticulated
identifiable bison elements. Left mandible counts indicate that these remains
represent at least 23 individuals; dentition wear indicated that the bison herd was
composed of animals ranging between 1 and 12 years of age. Postcranial elements
suggested that at least three immature/juveniles, 19 early mature and mature cows,
and one bull were represented (Hughes 1977:49). Reanalysis of the Twilla site
mandibles by Fawcett (1987:402, 417, Appendix D and F) resulted in evidence of
at least 50 individuals and, on the basis of tooth eruption and wear data, placed the
time of death in the fall of the year.
Cultural materials recovered from the excavations were 15 complete and
fragmentary projectile points, one unifacially retouched flake, six unmodified
"chips/spalls/flakes," and two "chunks"; surface materials were three cobble
fragments, one flaked cobble, two bifacially retouched cobbles, two possible flake
cores, one naturally backed tool, one utilized flake, three unifacially retouched
flakes, one bifacially retouched flake, 13 unmodified "chips/spalls/flakes," and
three "chunks" (Hughes 1977:Table 1; 1989:Table 1).
There is some variability among the projectile points, but they are dominated
by large, thin, weakly barbed, comer-notched dart points with relatively short,
straight-to-slightly-expanding stems, pointed-to-rounded barbs, and straight-tomarkedly-convex bases. Hughes (1977, 1989) recognizes three dominant varieties
of projectile points (Figures 2, 3). Variety I is a large, broad point with a sharp tip,
convex blade edges, prominent-to-weakly-barbed shoulders, broad but shallow
comer notches that leave short, straight-to-slightly-expanding stems, prominent
basal tangs, and straight-to-slightly-concave bases. Hughes (1989:188) sees a
similarity between Variety I points and the Marcos or Ellis types. Variety II points
are shorter than either Variety I or III forms, but they are nevertheless dart forms
with broad blades. The tips are usually rounded, blade edges are convex, with
prominent-to-weakly barbed shoulders that are not as pronounced as the Variety I
points, comer-to-side notches are broad but shallow, stems are slightly-to-moderately expanding, tangs are rounded, and bases are straight-to-recurve/concave.
Hughes (1989:189) suggests that these specimens resemble Palmillas or Williams
types. Variety III points are large, broad blade points with relatively straight blade
edges, prominent-to-weakly-barbed shoulders, broad but shallow comer notches,
rounded tangs, and convex bases. No comparisons to known types are suggested.
Elsewhere, although Hughes (1977) is wary of classifying these points, he does
acknowledge some similarities with the Marcos, Williams, Ellis, Ensor, Trinity, and
Palmillas types, which traditionally date between 1000 B.C. and A.D. 1000.
Locally available gravels dominate the lithic materials: Potter chert (n=36; 66
percen0, Tecovas jasper (n--4; 7 percen0, petrified wood (n=2; 4 percen0, chalcedony (n=l; 2 percen0, quartzite (n=4; 7 percen0 and unidentified cherty materials

In 1977, samples of ribs and vertebrae from Twilla, which had been stored in
paper, plastic, and waxed-paper bags for almost a decade, were submitted, together
with bone samples from other bison kill sites, to Radiocarbon, Ltd. for dating
(Hughes 1977,1989). The uncorrected results of these four samples ranged between
A.D. 20!-_110 (RL-571) at the Collier site and A.D. 970!-_ 100 ~..L-572) at the Strong
site (Table 1). The uncorrected radiocarbon date from Twilla was A.D. 830 + 100
(Hughes 1977:131, 1989:201). The radiocarbon dating of large Archaic Period dart

points to times traditionally assigned to the Woodland period suggested to Hughes
that the radiocarbon samples might have been contaminated during storage.
However, Hughes notes that the occurrence of bone beds at the bottoms of filled
gullies suggests that the kills took place at the end of a climatic episode that caused
the gully cutting and that the wetter climatic conditions of the first half of the first
millennium A.D. could account for the gully filling.
In an attempt to resolve the apparent chronological contradiction, and to
remove the factor of possible contamination of samples by the storage bags,
additional bone samples were collected from the Twilla site on September 15, 1980,
by John D. Speth and Billy R. Harrison. During this visit, however, the bison bone
bed was found to have been almost totally destroyed by vandals; fresh pick marks
and footprints were still visible. Most of the identifiable bone fragments found on
a large spoil pile were collected in plastic bags. From these unprovenienced
remains, three composite samples consisting of half a dozen articular and shaft
fragments, each weighing between 700 and 800 grams, were selected and submitted within three weeks of collection to Beta Analytic, Inc. for dating and ~3C#~
analysis. Although the results of these analyses have been available for several
years, they have been reported only in a doctoral dissertation (Fawcett 1987:370,
Appendix B).

The three additional radiocarbon dates from Twilla are based on bone collagen
and range between 20-L-_85 B.C. and A.D. 660-&-_95 (Table 1). Ratios obtained from
13CP2C analyses of the three samples showed no consistency. The values, varying
from -0.07 per mil to-8.98 per mil to -16.58 per mil, are difficult to interpret. The
variation in stable isotope ratios in bison bone is a product of their diet, which
comprises predominately grass species. These plants fix carbon from atmospheric
carbon dioxide by one of two photosynthetic pathways, which produce distinctly
different stable isotope ratios. When the plants are consumed by herbivores, the
carbon is incorporated into their bone collagen, and the amount of each type eaten
can be calculated (DeNiro and Epstein 1978). Most grasses (e.g., Stipa sp.) use the
C3 Calvin-Benson pathway, which has an average isotopic fraction of-26.5 per mil;
C4 grasses (e.g., Buchloe dactyloides, Bouteloua sp.), which use the Hatch-Slack
pathway, average -12.5 per mil (Smith and Epstein 1971). When these plants are
consumed by animals, they undergo a fractionation of approximately +5 per mil
(van der Merwe 1982). This enrichment caused by metabolic processes would give
the bones of a pure C4 plant consumer a stable isotope ratio of-7.5 per mil; a pure
Ca plant diet would produce a ratio of-21.5 per mil. The percentage of C3 and C4
species in a herbivore’s diet can be figured from a simple linear interpolation
(Chisholm, 1989). If a consistent chronometric trend was reflected in the 13C/a2C
ratio values, this might indicate that the dated materials came from separate bison
bone beds derived from kills that bridged the postulated climatic change towards
more mesic conditions during the early part of the first millennium A.D. (Hall 1982;
1989). Unfortunately, no consistent pattern emerges when the 13C/~C values are
organized chronometrically; the lowest ~3C/12C value is from the middle date. The
cause of the variability is therefore uncertain.
The Beta Analytic laboratory mentioned that the wide variability of the ~3C/a2C
values "would be indicative of possible in situ contamination" (written communication, M. Tamers to J. Speth, December 11, 1980). The source and extent of
contamination are unknown, as are the effects of the contamination on the chronometric age (cf. Stafford et al. 1987). For these reasons it is inappropriate to apply the
various correction and calibration procedures to these dates.
SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

The chronologically inconsistent pattern of the 13C/azC results from the three
new dates from the Twilla bison kill site suggests that there may have been some in
situ contamination. Therefore, these dates must be used cautiously.
The three new Twilla site dates, nevertheless, contribute to the chronology of
bison kill sites on the Southern Plains. The seven available uncorrected radiocarbon
dates from the bison kills in the Red River drainage span a period from 20-&-_85 B.C.
to A.D. 970-2-_100 (Table 1). The one-standard-deviation intervals for three of the
dates from the Twilla and Collier sites overlap the period from 90 B.C. to A.D. 120;
no dates fall between A.D. 120 and 320. Single-standard-deviation intervals span

the period from A.D. 320 to 540 and A.D. 560 to 1070, with slight one-standarddeviation overlaps at A.D. 730 to 760 and A.D. 870 and 930. Although the
diagnostic artifact assemblage consists exclusively of large Archaic-style dart
points, the radiocarbon dates tenuously suggest a transitional Late Archaic to early
Neo-Archaic/Woodland (Late Prehistoric) period affiliation. This pattern has been
recognized recently for other sites in western Oklahoma (Thurmond 1989); a
radiocarbon sample from a nonkill site, 34RM334, which contained Ensor, Marcos,
and Palmillas points, yielded a mass speclIometer radiocarbon date of A.D. 16+81
(NZA712).
Indigenous complexes (e.g., Lake Creek and Palo Duro) in theTexas Panhandle
include arrowpoints as early as A.D. 170; however, it seems probable that atlatl
technology persisted. The large points probably represent a specialized atlatlBance
weaponry, or hafted knives used for butchering bison, during the first millennium
A.D. Although subsequent Plains Village (Late Prehistoric) groups (Antelope
Creek, Custer, Washita River, etc.) perfected abow-and-arrow technology primarily
for killing solitary bison, it seems reasonable to believe that the bow would not
immediately replace the atlatl. Since considerable body motion is required for

264

launching projectiles with atlatls, they may have been used for the dispatch of bison
in small herds in situations that were topographically favorable for stampedes or
drives. In contrast, bows and arrows, which require little body movement, could
have been used contemporaneously with atlatls in the stalking of single animals,
without alarming entire herds. Similar nonstampeding hunting stratagies were used
effectively by Anglo bison hunters in the 1870-1880s, who used powerful rifles to
eliminate bison herds on the Southern Plains (Baker and Harrison 1986).
The contemporaneity of atlatl and bow hunting technologies in the Texas
Panhandle is not an isolated occurrence. Recent obsidian hydration dates on large
dart points found in high altitude sites in the Southwest indicate that they were used
by Puebloan hunters into the 1200s, even though the bow-and-arrow technology had
appeared in the Southwest nearly a millennium earlier (Bemam et al. 1989). In the
Southwest, their size and velocity may have made atlatl darts very effective in the
immediate felling of large game such as elk when they were used in meadow margin
hunting strategies from concealed forest-edge blinds (tracking of wounded animals
through thick forest underbrush increases the risk of failure). There is no inconsistency in the logic of recognizing the retention of atlatl dart hunting strategies as a
complement to bow hunting. After all, archers persist in this modem age of
ballistical hunters.
