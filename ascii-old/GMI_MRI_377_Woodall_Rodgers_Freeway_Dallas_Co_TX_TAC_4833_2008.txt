ABSTRACT

The project consists of reconnaissance survey of existing right-of-way along the Woodall
Rodgers Freeway between Pearl and Akard Streets in downtown Dallas, Texas. The Area of
Potential Effect is 1,500 feet long and 650 feet wide and is located on a terrace on the east bank
of the Trinity River which is now the urban environment of downtown Dallas. The purpose of
the cultural resources investigation in this project area is to determine the presence/absence of
archeological resources and to evaluate identified resources for their eligibility and inclusion on
the National Register of Historic Places as per section 106 of the National Historic Preservation
Act of 1966, as amended, or for designation as a State Archeological Landmark under the
Antiquities Code of Texas. This work is being performed for Carter Burgess with which GeoMarine, Inc. (GMI), is a subcontractor (GMI project # 30389.00.10). Fieldwork was conducted
on December 28, 2006.
The APE extends along the Woodall Rodgers Freeway between Pearl and Akard Streets for the
construction of an elevated deck for green space above the Woodall Rodgers Freeway (CSJ 019607-027). The entire APE has been disturbed by previous construction of the freeway, retaining
walls, bridges, buildings, and the utilities and other infrastructure needed to support a large urban
center such as Dallas, Texas. No archeological resources are likely to be impacted by the
proposed construction.

INTRODUCTION

The project consists of reconaissance survey of existing right-of-way along the Woodall Rodgers
Freeway between Pearl and Akard Streets in downtown Dallas, Texas. The Area of Potential
Effect (APE) is 1,269 feet (386 meters) long and 316 feet (96 meters) wide (the street right-ofway) and is located on a terrace on the east bank of the Trinity River which is now the urban
environment of downtown Dallas. The purpose of the cultural resources investigation in this
project area is to determine the presence/absence of archeological resources and to evaluate
identified resources for their eligibility and inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) as per section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, or for
designation as a State Archeological Landmark under the Antiquities Code of Texas. This work
is being performed for Carter Burgess with which Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI), is a subcontractor
(GMI project number 30389.00.10).
Field work consisting of a reconnaissance survey was conducted on December 28, 2006, by
Kristen J. Bastis (Archeologist) and Natalie Thomas (Architectural Historian) of GMI. Melissa
M. Green, also of GMI, served as the principal investigator for the project.
The APE extends along the Woodall Rodgers Freeway between Pearl and Akard Streets (Figures
1 and 2). The proposed project is the construction of an elevated deck for green space above the
Woodall Rodgers Freeway (CSJ 0196-07-027). The entire APE is located in the urban
environment of downtown Dallas, Texas. The entire APE has been disturbed by previous
construction of the freeway, retaining walls, bridges, buildings, and the utilities and other
infrastructure needed to support a large urban center such as Dallas, Texas.

CHAPTER 2
ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

FLORA AND FAUNA
Dallas County is part of the Texan biotic province, defined by Blair (1950) as an intermediate
zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian provinces, and the grasslands of the
Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces. Some species reach the limits of their range in
the Texan province. Almost all of Dallas County falls within the Blackland Prairie, one of
several tall grass prairies present in this northcentral part of Texas. Blackland Prairie vegetation
is dominated by uplands grasses; woodlands are restricted to stream courses and river bottoms.
Prior to the disturbances associated with the Historic period, the wooded areas would have been
covered by a water-oak/elm/hackberry forest, with occasional grassy clearings and shallow water
marshes and ponds (McMahan et al. 1984). Today, this bottomland forest can include cedar elm,
American elm, willow oak, southern red oak, white oak, black willow, cottonwood, red ash,
sycamore, pecan, bois dâarc, flowering dogwood, dewberry, and coral-berry. Among the grasses
expected to occur within the prairie setting are little bluestem, big bluestem, Indiangrass,
dallisgrass, hairgrama switchgrass, rescuegrass, bermudagrass, sideoats grama, Texas
needlegrass, Torrey silver bluestem, eastern gramagrass, Virginia wildrye, Johnsongrass, giant
ragweed, and yankeeweed (Coffee et al. 1980:50, 92). Most of this vegetation was probably
present prehistorically.
The faunal community in the region has undergone massive changes due to the expansion of the
Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. Among the wildlife that would have previously inhabited the
region would have been open land species (bobwhite, quail, pheasant, meadowlark, field sparrow,
cottontail, and red fox), woodland species (wild turkey, ruffled grouse, woodcock, thrushes,
woodpeckers, squirrel, gray fox, raccoon, and deer), wetland inhabitants (ducks, geese, heron,
shore birds, muskrat, mink, and beaver), and rangeland species (antelope, deer, sage grouse,
meadowlark, and lark bunting), along with various species of reptiles (Coffee et al. 1980:50;
Schmidly 1983).

CLIMATE
The Dallas area has a warm temperate, subtropical, and humid climate. Although the climate is
generally mild, the summers are hot and the winters are cool as a result of surges of cold air. The
average summer temperatures range between 84Â°F and 94Â°F; the highest recorded temperature of
111Â°F occurred in the summer of 1954. Winter temperature averages range between 38Â°F and
48Â°F, but the lowest recorded temperature of 7Â°F occurred in February 1971. Temperature
remains above 32Â°F approximately 240 days each year. The yearly rainfall of 36 inches is fairly
evenly distributed, but the maximum falls in April and May and the minimum in August. Much
of the rainfall occurs in the form of heavy thunderstorms, and the rapid runoff allows only partial
absorption of water by the soil. Snowfall, which is rare, averages less that 2 inches per year and
is generally present for less than one week. The prevailing winds are from the south (Coffee et al.
1980:1â2).

SOILS
The location of Dallas County in the Blackland Prairie places it geologically in the Texas Coastal
Plain. Dallas County is underlain by three geological formations: the Eagle Ford Shale in the
western part of the county, the Austin Chalk in the central section, and the Taylor Marl in the
eastern part (Coffee et al 1980:2). Pleistocene terrace deposits and Holocene alluvium are found
along major streams and their tributaries. The Blackland Prairie is characterized by a generally
level topography and soils of dark, thick, plastic clay.
The proposed project area is underlain by the Austin Chalk formation and is composed of one soil
map unit, Urban Land: Urban land consists of built-up areas where 75 percent or more of the
surface reflects extensive building and pavement construction. Soils have been so disturbed that
soil mapping is not feasible. Residential construction comprises about 10 percent of this map unit
(Coffee et al 1980:36).
The soil map indicates that before the area was developed the soils were of the Silawa-SilstidBastsil Association. Silawa-Silstid-Bastsil soils are deep nearly level to sloping, loamy, sandy
soils on stream terraces. Silawa soils are located on ridges and slopes on uplands. The Silstid
soils are nearly level to gently sloping also on uplands. The Bastsil soils are nearly level to gently
sloping on high terraces (Coffee et al 1980:36).

CHAPTER 3
CULTURAL SETTING

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS IN THE PROJECT AREA
Three major reports concerning the archeology of the upper Trinity River basinâAn Assessment
of the Cultural Resources in the Trinity River Basin: Dallas, Tarrant, and Denton Counties,
Texas (Yates and Ferring 1986), Late Holocene Prehistory of the Mountain Creek Basin (Peter
and McGregor 1988), and A Synthesis of Prehistory of the Lower Elm Fork of the Trinity River
(Prikryl 1987)âaptly summarize the history of archeological investigations within the upper
Trinity River drainage and the culture-historical framework for the area. Although the combined
efforts of professional and avocational archeologists have resulted in the recording of numerous
sites, it is apparent that much research remains to be done. As noted by Peter and McGregor
(1988:27â29), many of the excavation efforts within the upper Trinity River basin have focused
on reservoir development, especially along the Elm Fork (Crook and Harris 1957, 1958, 1961;
Skinner and Baird 1985; Skinner et al. 1982) and the East Fork (Dawson and Sullivan 1973;
Lorrain and Hoffrichter 1968; Lynott 1975; Ross 1966). Field school excavations by the
University of Texas at Arlington at the Northlake site on Grapevine Creek were also reported in
the mid-1970s (Morgan 1975). Investigations at Joe Pool Lake (Jurney, Lebo, and Green 1988;
Peter and McGregor 1988) have provided an in-depth examination of the models for both
prehistoric and historic adaptations within the upper Trinity River drainage.
Extensive archeological investigations have been undertaken as a result of the construction of
Lewisville Lake (formerly known as Lake Dallas and Garza-Little Elm Reservoir) and Lake Ray
Roberts (formerly known as Aubrey Reservoir). Lewisville Lake has been expanded several
times as the population of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex has grown; its earliest incarnation,
Lake Dallas, existed prior to 1936. Archeological investigations for Lewisville Lake began in
1948 when the River Basin Survey (RBS) investigated the proposed reservoir area. A total of 27
sites was found during this survey; 14 of these had been previously recorded by members of the
Dallas Archeological Society (DAS; Stephenson 1949, 1950). Three sites, Ledbetter (41DN5),
Lake Dallas (41DN6), and Bob Pierce (41DN12), were tested by the RBS in 1951, although the
results have never been reported (Prikryl 1987). During and after the RBS investigation,
members of the DAS continued to investigate the Lewisville Lake area (Barber 1966, 1969;
Harris 1950, 1951a, 1951b). The major result of this work was the discovery and investigation of
the Lewisville site (41DN72), a purported pre-Clovis occupation (Crook 1964; Crook and Harris
6

1956, 1957, 1958, 1961). Radiocarbon dates of 37,000 years before present (yrs B.P.) created
considerable controversy in the archeological community until 1979â1980, when lowered lake
levels allowed reinvestigation of the site by the Smithsonian Institution (Stanford 1981). Further
enlargements of Lewisville Lake prompted surveys by the Richland Archeological Society in
1973 (Nunley 1973) and North Texas State University (now the University of North Texas
[UNT]) in 1986 (Lebo and Brown 1990), and testing of selected sites (Brown and Lebo 1991;
Lebo 1995a).
Archeological investigations at Lake Ray Roberts began in the early 1970s with a reconnaissance
survey conducted by Southern Methodist University (SMU; Bousman and Verrett 1973), which
recorded 26 sites (25 prehistoric and one historic). Archeological survey of the entire lake was
undertaken by Environmental Consultants, Inc. (ECI), during 1980â1981 (Cliff et al. 1982). This
intensive survey recorded 355 sites (117 with prehistoric components and 238 with historic
components) and recommended further investigation for 172 of these sites. Additional
investigations undertaken at 60 of these sites included archeological testing, surface collecting,
and historic research (Skinner et al. 1982). Eight prehistoric and 23 historic sites were
recommended for inclusion in the NRHP as a result of these additional investigations. Mitigation
followed in 1982 through intensive excavation of 14 sites (six prehistoric and eight historic sites),
oral interviews for 17 historic sites, and architectural recording of 13 sites (Skinner and Baird
1985). Finally, in 1986 UNT began further survey, test excavations, and mitigation efforts within
the area to be impacted by construction of Lake Ray Roberts (Ferring and Yates 1997; Lebo
1995b; Prikryl and Yates 1987). Following the inundation of Lake Ray Roberts, the Aubrey site
(41DN479), a Clovis-age Paleo-Indian occupation buried 7 to 8 m below the present ground
surface, was discovered. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District, funded
excavations by UNT at this site (Ferring 1989). Additional survey was also undertaken for the
Fort Worth District as part of the Trinity River Greenbelt, a proposed development along the Elm
Fork between Lewisville Lake and Lake Ray Roberts (Hunt et al. 1996).
Several small-scale projects have been undertaken near the project area. The Archaeology
Research Program of Southern Methodist University conducted testing and mitigation
investigations in late 1987 and early 1988 at 41DL279, the site of the addition to the Dallas
County Administration Building housing the John F. Kennedy exhibit. Site 41DL279
encompassed Block 10/13 of the Dallas CBD and provided a glimpse into the lifeways of
nineteenth-century urban Dallasites of differing ethnic and socioeconomic groups (Jurney and
Andrews 1994). In 1990, GMI conducted an archeological survey and intensive archival review
of the area for the Railtran commuter line from the South Irving Transit Station to Union Station
(Peter et al. 1991). No archeological remains were identified. A small survey was conducted by
GMI in 1991 for the Dallas Utility and Reclamation District (Hunt 1991).
In conjunction with the proposed construction of the President George Bush Turnpike toll road
(SH-190) within the flood plain of the Elm Fork of the Trinity River from the Interstate Highway
35E/Trinity Mills Road interchange to the Interstate Highway-635/Valley View Road
interchange, GMI undertook cultural resources survey of the direct impact area as part of an
environmental assessment (GMI 1995; Hunt and Peter 1997), as well as more recent
investigations conducted as part of an environmental impact statement evaluating the impact on
proposed borrow areas and alternative routes (Peter et al. 2001). The most recent phase of the
project consisted of intensive pedestrian survey and geoarcheological investigations for three
borrow areas and a pedestrian survey of additional acres for alternative routes proposed for SH190 (Peter et al. 2001). The investigations resulted in the relocation of two previously recorded
7

archeological sites (41DL240 and 41DL321) as well as the discovery of one previously unknown
prehistoric site (41DL391) and several localities. Sites 41DL240 and 41DL321 (Trinity Mills
Bridge site) were each considered ineligible for inclusion in the National Register because of the
lack of significant cultural deposits and the loss of integrity. Site 41DL391 consisted of mussel
shell and burned earth found at a depth of 340 to 430 cm below surface during the
geoarcheological investigations. Although no definitive cultural materials were observed, the
deposit appeared to have good contextual integrity; consequently, test excavations were
recommended to better determine the National Register status of the site (Peter et al. 2001). The
test excavations (Peter et al. 2002) revealed an ephemeral site with significant data indicating the
cultural use of knotweed and bulbs (most likely onion) circa 1,000 yrs B.P., and a hunting and
foraging subsistence pattern focusing on deer, other large mammals (including the presence of
elk), fish, and mussel circa 700 yrs B.P. Nevertheless, the limited artifact assemblage contributed
to the recommendation that the data potential of the site had been mitigated through the test
excavations.
Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) has sponsored a large number of cultural resources
management projects (Adovasio 1992; Archaeology Research Program 1989, 1991; Dorward and
Weston 1990; Dorward et al. 1990; Dorward et al. 1991; Jurney 1987a, 1987b, 1987c, 1987d,

Associates and ArchiTexas 1987, 1988; Myra L. Frank & Associates and Burson & Cox 1987a,
1987b, 1987c, 1987d; Skinner et al. 1994; Weston and Dorward 1990; Winchell and Dorward
1991). Appendix B in Skinner et al. (1996) presents a summary of these projects. More recently,
additional investigations have included the survey and evaluation of architecture on the North
Central and Northeast corridors (Green and James 1996; Green et al. 1997; Myra L. Frank &
Associates, Inc., and ArchiTexas 1996a, 1996b) as well as at specific station locations (Wendy
Lopez & Associates, Inc. 1998a; 1998b). In addition, two literature searches conducted to assess
the archeological potential for environmental assessments and an archeological reconnaissance
have also been conducted for DART (Schreyer 2001; Wendy Lopez & Associates, Inc. 1999a,
1999b).
The previously known sites within 1 mile of the project area include two historic cemeteries, a
historic dump, a historic home site and one site of unknown type (41DL316, 41DL376, 41DL363,
41DL413, and 41DL377). Sites 41DL316, 41DL376 are historic cemeteries. Site 41DL316, The
Freedmanâs Cemetery, was in use from 1869 to 1884 and the excavation, analysis of 1,150 graves
which were then reinterred provided significant information concerning the African-American
community of Dallas. Site 41DL376, The Greenwood Cemetery, in use from 1875 to the present.
GMI conducted an excavation of 26 graves from the Potterâs Field associated with the
Greenwood Cemetery in 2002 (TinÃ© et al. 2002). In addition to these two cemeteries there are
two other GMI investigations in the area concerning burials; the Temple Emanu-El Cemetery and
a five acre tract bounded on the north by the Freedmanâs Cemetery, to the west by Calvary and
Temple Emanu-El cemeteries with Central Expressway to the east. The investigations at Temple
Emanu-El Cemetery resulted in the discovery of an estimated 1,680-1,870 interments (TinÃ©
2000). No burials were located on the five acre tract between the cemeteries and the Central
Expressway (TinÃ© 2004). Site 41DL363 is an historic dump located during a survey in
8

preparation for the construction of a rail line near Union Station. According to the site form the
site was destroyed and had no integrity (Skinner 1994). Site 41DL413 is a house lot that once
contained a shotgun style house occupied by African Americans from its construction prior to
1899 to the early 1970âs when it was razed for construction of the Woodall Rodgers Freeway
(Davidson 2002). There is no information regarding site 41DL377 on the site atlas except its
location.

PREHISTORIC CHRONOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK
Although the chronological framework for the upper Trinity River basin is not well developed,
the available data allow the delineation of a generalized chronology (Table 1). Investigations at
Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988) have provided evidence for a refinement of the
chronology for the Late Prehistoric period, but the overall regional applicability of the phases
recognized at Joe Pool Lake remains to be demonstrated. Prikryl (1987) has presented a
chronological sequence of six periods. Unfortunately, his sequence relies almost totally on
diagnostic artifacts from surface contexts and on comparisons to dated contexts distant from the
upper Trinity River basin. The generalized chronology presented here reflects the present state of
knowledge as interpreted from the Joe Pool Lake investigations. A brief summary of the
adaptations associated with these periods is presented below.

Paleo-Indian Period
The Paleo-Indian period in Northcentral Texas (ca. 9500â6500 B.C.) generally includes the
remains of human presence that can be dated to the very late Pleistocene and the immediate postPleistocene periods (for reviews of this period relevant to Northcentral Texas, see Hofman 1989a;
Johnson 1989; Prikryl 1990; and Story 1990). Unfortunately, the Paleo-Indian occupation of the
upper Trinity River basin is known primarily through diagnostic projectile points from surface
collections or from stratigraphically mixed contexts (Meltzer 1987; Meltzer and Bever 1995).
The Field Ranch site (X41CO10) along the upper Elm Fork is a prime example of typical site
contexts (Jensen 1968). Specimens of Clovis, Folsom, Plainview, and Hell Gap dart types have
been collected from the surface of the site. Excavations of the site have failed to locate any
Paleo-Indian materials in primary context (Jensen 1968).

9

Clovis and Plainview points are commonly found along both Denton and Clear creeks in the
Cross Timbers, northwest of Dallas. Until recently, the Lewisville Lake site (41DN71) was the
best known Paleo-Indian site within the region, containing large burned features interpreted as
hearths and a low density of artifacts including a Clovis point (Crook and Harris 1957, 1958,
1961). Although the original radiocarbon dates on the hearths suggested an anomalous early age
for Clovis points (ca. 37,000 yrs B.P.), more recent work by the Smithsonian Institution (Stanford
1981) appears to have resolved the controversy concerning the date of the occupation there. It
appears that the presence of naturally occurring ligniteâas either a fuel in these hearths or as an
inadvertent inclusionâcontaminated the radiocarbon samples. Consequently, the usually
accepted date of 10,000â12,000 yrs B.P. for Clovis period occupations is probably a reasonable
estimate for the first human occupation of Northcentral Texas.
A more spectacular exception to the generally limited data on Paleo-Indian sites in Northcentral
Texas is the deeply buried Clovis-age Aubrey site (41DN479), located on the Elm Fork of the
Trinity River north of Dallas (Ferring 1989). The discovery of this site, buried approximately 78 m below the top of the Elm Fork flood plain just below the Lake Ray Roberts dam, suggests
that well-preserved Paleo-Indian sites in Northcentral Texas will only be found by examining
deeply stratified Holocene alluvium in modern flood plain situations. Ferring has suggested that
Paleo-Indian sites similar to the Aubrey site may occur under 18 m of sediment in the Dallas area
(Anonymous 1990).
Based on a sample of projectile points from surface sites, Prikryl (1990) has suggested that the
most common Paleo-Indian point types in Northcentral Texas are Plainview and Dalton. Ferring
and Yates (1997) suggest that, based on cross-dating with other regions, these types date to about
9,500â10,000 years agoâan age that may correspond to the onset of early Holocene alluviation
in the Trinity River valley. Unfortunately, no sites have been investigated where these points are
associated with unmixed assemblages.
Despite the lack of extensive data relating to the early Paleo-Indian period in Northcentral Texas,
some attempts have been made to generalize regarding settlement mobility and intensity of site
occupation, drawing on what is known and on assumptions based on comparisons with other
areas. For instance, a number of researchers have seen evidence for a high degree of group
mobility in the broad distribution of Paleo-Indian artifacts over the landscape and in the variety of
presumably nonlocal lithic raw materials from which the artifacts were made (Meltzer and Smith
1986; Shafer 1977; Story 1990:177). Likewise, the well-documented exploitation of large
megafauna by Paleo-Indians in the western United States, coupled with the known presence of
similar faunal species in Northcentral Texas between 11,000 and 9,000 years ago (see Slaughter
and Hoover 1963), has resulted in the popular (and logical) conclusion that âbig game huntingâ
was part of the Paleo-Indian subsistence strategy in Northcentral Texas. Recent important
excavations at the Aubrey site have, however, indicated that subsistence efforts did not focus on
big game animals alone. Rather, the occupants of the site used the entire range of prairie and
forest species, including bison, deer, rabbits, squirrels, fish, and abundant turtle (Ferring 1989;
Ferring and Yates 1997). Interestingly, although mammoth remains are present, their exploitation
has not been substantiated (Ferring and Yates 1997). Whether this pattern of a more generalized
foraging subsistence system was characteristic of Clovis adaptations on the fringes of the Eastern
Woodlands and that the focus on now-extinct, big game species was more characteristic of a
Plains adaptation remains to be documented. Ferring and Yates (1997:5) suggest that, in general,
the Clovis people probably employed âvery flexible adaptive strategies.â

Archaic Period
The Archaic period in Northcentral Texas is tentatively dated between 6000 B.C. and A.D. 700.
As is true for many areas, a threefold division of the Archaic period, consisting of Early, Middle,
and Late subperiods, has been applied in Northcentral Texas (Prikryl 1990). Thus, the Early
Archaic has been dated from 6000 to 4000 B.C., the Middle Archaic from 4000 to 1500 B.C., and
the Late Archaic from 1500 B.C. to A.D. 700 (overviews that cover the Archaic in this portion of
Texas include Hofman 1989a; Prikryl 1990; and Story 1985, 1990). Archaic remains are usually
found in upland settings and are frequently mixed with later material. In fact, the initial treatment
of the Archaic period in Northcentral Texas (Crook and Harris 1952, 1954) that defined the
Carrollton and Elam foci was based upon materials from such mixed terrace contexts.
Consequently, these time-space constructs are no longer recognized as being acceptable for this
area of Texas (Peter and McGregor 1988; Prikryl 1990; Yates and Ferring 1986). General trends
that have been proposed as characterizing the Archaic period in Northcentral Texas suggest
increasingly complex settlement systems, increasing population size and density, gradually
decreasing mobility, and development of distinct group territories (Prikryl 1990; Story 1985:52).
During the Early Archaic (ca. 6000â4000 B.C.), in general, the occurrence of small and widely
distributed sites has been suggested to reflect high group mobility within large and poorly defined
territories, with a generalized hunting-and-gathering economy (Meltzer and Smith 1986; Story
1985:35, 39). Unfortunately, Early Archaic occupations in Northcentral Texas are poorly
documented, and no sites with isolated Early Archaic components in this area are known (Prikryl
1990). Based on surface collections, Prikryl (1990) hypothesizes a generalized hunting-andgathering economy during this period, with high group mobility, a lack of regionalization, and
âlittle in the way of recognized territorial boundariesâ (Prikryl 1990:71). Projectile point forms
that may be associated with the Early Archaic in Northcentral Texas include Early Split Stemmed
and possibly Angostura points (Prikryl 1990; Story 1990:Figure 31).
In comparison to the Early Archaic, the Middle Archaic period in Northcentral Texas (4000â1500
is even less well known. Fewer sites are known with Middle Archaic components than for
any other period, but the few surface collections available suggest the beginnings of regional
cultural differences by the end of the period (Prikryl 1990). Diagnostic dart points that may be
associated with the Middle Archaic include the Basal Notched group (which includes Calf Creek,
Bell, and Andice), Wells, Dawson, Carrollton, and Bulverde (Prikryl 1990; Story 1990: Figure
31). An intact Middle Archaic component identified at the Calvert site (41DN102) at Lake Ray
Roberts is summarized:

B.C.)

Hearths, a burial, an unmixed assemblage of artifacts and fauna provide new evidence of adaptations
to a drier Middle Holocene landscape. Artifact types are similar to those from adjacent regions (Story
1990) suggesting broad cultural interactions. The foraging economy emphasized procurement of
small game and deer. It is assumed that these people were quite mobile, as repeated occupations of
the site during the MA period are evident [Ferring and Yates 1997:305].

Population density may have reached a peak during the Late Archaic period in Northcentral
Texas (ca. 1500 B.C.âA.D. 700), as evidenced by an apparent increase in the number of sites, a
greater distribution of sites over the landscape, and evidence of decreasing mobility (Prikryl
1990). At the same time, group mobility may have become more limited and interregional
contact may have diminished. If greater spatial dispersal of sites is not a result of sampling error
due to unequal destruction or burial of earlier sites, it may reflect an economic system making
increasing use of all available floral and faunal resources. Throughout Northcentral Texas, Late
Archaic period occupation sites are relatively common in the uplands, and a relatively large
11

number of shallowly buried sites are also known from the Trinity River flood plain (Ferring
1990:51). Dart points that may be diagnostic of the Late Archaic include Castroville, Dallas,
Elam, Ellis, Edgewood, Godley, Gary, Marshall, Palmillas, Trinity, and Yarbrough (Prikryl 1990;
Story 1990: Figure 31).
Investigations at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988) and Lake Ray Roberts (Ferring and
Yates 1997) indicate that remains of the Late Archaic period are characterized by assemblages
apparently left by small bands of foraging hunters and gatherers who occupied a locality for a
limited time period and then moved to another locality. These sites were apparently reoccupied
numerous times on a seasonal basis. Faunal remains indicate that Late Archaic populations
exploited a mix of prairie, forest, and riparian species; white-tailed deer, rabbits, turtles, and
mussels were primary food resources (Ferring and Yates 1997:6). The results of investigations at
a number of Late Archaic sites at Lake Ray Roberts are summarized by Ferring and Yates
(1997:305):
The most substantial occupations of the project area took place in the later part (post-3,000 yr BP) of
the LA period. This is clearly a broad regional trend . . . although poor site exposure limits our
understanding of earlier periods. Late Archaic sites here uniformly register mobile foragers that
exploited all habitats available to them. Residential mobility . . . is implied. Repeated occupations at
multiple sites were characterized by use of rock-lined and unlined hearths. On stable surfaces these
are recorded as rock middens. In aggrading environments, discrete hearth construction events are
clear. Import and curation of chert tools is evident, and contrasts with core-biface curation in the MA
period. Chert was preferentially used for straight, expanding and corner-notched points, while local
raw materials were reduced on-site and dominate the contracting-stemmed forms. Despite quite good
resource availability, dietary stress is recorded from skeletal and dental analyses. . . .

The documentation of large pits associated with Late Archaic period sites in the Richland Creek
and Chambers Creek drainages (Bruseth and Martin 1987) also suggests that important
sociopolitical changes may have been occurring during this time period. Unfortunately, the
significance of these pits remains an enigma despite their excellent documentation. Late Archaic
period deposits along the Denton Creek drainage (Anthony and Brown 1994) seem to suggest
intensive use of fresh-water shellfish, possibly indicating decreasing availability of large
mammals, decreasing territory size, or an increase in population density over time.

Late Prehistoric Period
The beginning of what is called the Late Prehistoric period in the upper Trinity River basin (ca.
A.D. 700â1600) is marked by the initial appearance of arrow points. The A.D. 700 date for the
start of this period is based upon dated contexts for similar material in the Brazos River drainage
to the west. Both Lynott (1977) and Prikryl (1990) have proposed that the Late Prehistoric period
be divided into an early and a late phase: the early phase reflecting a continuation of the foraging
subsistence system of the preceding Late Archaic period, and the late phase reflecting Southern
Plains influences. In this view, the early phase dates between A.D. 700 and 1200 and is
characterized by sand- and grog-tempered ceramics and by Scallorn, Steiner, Catahoula, and Alba
arrow points (Lynott 1977; Prikryl 1990). The late phase dates from A.D. 1200 to 1600 and is
associated with the appearance of Nocona Plain ceramics of the Henrietta focus, various
unstemmed triangular points (e.g., Maud, Fresno, Harrell, Washita), and the Perdiz point (Lynott
1977; Prikryl 1990). Evidence of horticulture and bison procurement also appears in sites of this
period (Harris and Harris 1970; Morris and Morris 1970).
12

Recent investigations at the Cobb-Pool site (41DL148) at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor
1988) have resulted in a reformulation of the Late Prehistoric period. The Cobb-Pool site has
yielded house structures, roasting pits, Alba points, grog-tempered ceramics, and charred corn
cupules. Radiocarbon dates from several features indicate the site was occupied during the late
twelfth or early thirteenth century. Present evidence suggests that the site does not represent an
intrusive Caddoan occupation; consequently, a significant adaptive change appears to have
occurred, in at least some areas, during a middle phase of the Late Prehistoric period. It is also
likely that ceramics were not introduced to the region before this time.
In regard to the Late Prehistoric components investigated at Lake Ray Roberts, Ferring and Yates
(1997:305) summarize the results of that research:
There are no woodland-like sites in north-central Texas, suggesting that Plains Woodland
influence/contact did not characterize the transition to the Late Prehistoric period. No ceramics were
found with LPI assemblages, which have Scallorn, Alba and small Gary points. These appear to be
short-term occupations that took place under conditions of reduced precipitation compared to the Late
Archaic. Except for the replacement of darts with bow-arrow weaponry, these occupations are
essentially similar to the Late Archaic. Regional exchange of technological information, rather than
environmental change, probably is the factor behind the LA to LP shift.
Late Prehistoric II occupations are characterized by multiple, short-term use of probably logistic sites
which lack ceramics and architecture. The architectural remains at 41DN102 are the only ones in the
project area. At best, this was a small hamlet, occupied ca. 500â650 yr BP. No evidence of
horticulture was recovered, and the LPII faunas indicate a foraging strategy that emphasized deer
procurement, and occasionally bison as well. Transport and curation of chert raw materials was about
as frequent as in the LA, and long-distance raw material acquisition (e.g., Edwards, Alibates) is not
evidenced. Ceramic traditions are dominated by locally produced shell-tempered wares, which by
this time were being produced in the Southern Plains region generally. As recorded by previous
synthesis (Story 1990), little if any interaction with the Caddoan area is indicated. Thus, the Ray
Roberts prehistoric data suggest that regional traditions emerged at the end of the LP period largely
independent of the Plains or East Texas Woodlands.

In light of these results, the status of the Cobb-Pool site is even more striking. Whether the CobbPool site merely represents a local experiment or reflects a regional adaptive change separate
from that emerging to the north remains to be fully documented; however, recent analysis of a
Native American burial salvaged along Spring Creek (site 41DL373) in Dallas County also
suggests maize consumption. The individual was a female around 50 years old. Radiocarbon
dating indicates that this individual lived between A.D. 1155 and 1275; a carbon isotope ratio of
-17.7 â° suggests that, although maize was consumed, it did not form a major part of her diet
(Peter and Clow 2000). These indications of maize consumption contrast with a small grouping
of disturbed human remains recovered from the Harbor Pointe site (41DL369) in Dallas County.
This site, located on Rowlett Creek (a tributary of the East Fork of the Trinity River) yielded
remains of at least four individuals dated by radiocarbon dating of bone collagen to cal A.D. 1010
(1035) 1165. No pottery was recovered with these remains, although shell beads and a shell
gorget were present; and a carbon isotope ratio of â21.6 â° suggests that the groupâs diet was not
high in maize (Cliff et al. 1996). Given the slightly earlier date of the Harbor Pointe burials
compared to Cobb-Pool and 41DL373, it is possible that maize agriculture was introduced to the
Dallas area ca. A.D. 1200; conversely, this same evidence may indicate that divergent subsistence
patterns were practiced by groups in the Dallas area.

Protohistoric Period and Historic Native American Groups
Within Northcentral Texas, the time from A.D. 1600 to 1800 has been designated the Protohistoric
period. Prior to the founding of New Mexico in 1598, the European presence in the Southwest
and on the Southern Plains had been sporadic at bestâCoronado in 1540â1541, the RodriguezChamuscado party in 1581, Espejo in 1582â1583, among others. After 1598, however, Spanish
influence was never absent from the Southern Plains, although actual contact with Europeans
continued to be limited and there are only brief records of journeys into or through the area
(Hofman 1989b; John 1975). Despite this, it was not until the beginning of the nineteenth century
that the physical presence of Europeans on the Southern Plains became commonplaceâthe result
of increasingly peaceful relations between the Spanish in Texas and the Plains Indians to the
north, and the acquisition of Louisiana by the United States in 1803. Prior to about 1725â1750,
Apachean groups appear to have dominated the western portion of the Southern Plains, known as
the High Plains, while after this time the area was increasingly controlled by the Comanche and
Kiowa. On the eastern portion of the Southern Plains, within the area now known as the Lower
Plains and Northcentral Texas, the Wichita tribes became dominant (Bell et al. 1967; Hofman
1989b:91).
Unfortunately, since good historical documentation is very sparse for the upper Trinity River
basin during the Protohistoric period, it is not clear which specific aboriginal groups were
residing in the Dallas area at the beginning of this period. What is clear is that the Protohistoric
period in Northcentral Texas was a time of population fluctuation, movement, and amalgamation
(see Newcomb 1993). Available data suggest that many, if not all, of the aboriginal occupants of
the eastern margin of the Great Plains, which includes Northcentral Texas, were Caddoanlanguage speakers, from the Arikara in the north to the Wichita and Kichai in the south. In this
light, it is worth noting that it has also been suggested that the Socoatino, encountered by the
survivors of the de Soto expedition in the sixteenth century, were Caddoan speakers and were the
same group as the Canohatino, identified by the French in the latter part of the seventeenth
century. The group was apparently located at that time âon the Blackland Prairies between the
Guadalupe and Trinity rivers to the east of present-day San Antonio, Austin, and Wacoâ
(Newcomb 1993:24). If the prehistoric occupants of the eastern margin of the plains in Texas
were indeed Caddoan speakers, it would explain how they were absorbed very early by other
Caddoan-speaking groups (such as the Yojuane, Kichai, Tawakoni, Taovayas, Iscani, and Wichita
proper) who arrived in Northcentral Texas in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries.
Most of these groups, in turn, amalgamated to form the historic Wichita Tribe, but some were
probably absorbed by the united Caddo Tribes, and some may even have joined amalgamations of
a variety of groups, such as the Tonkawa, during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth
centuries.
The term Wichita has been used to refer to a group of linguistically related tribes that includes the
Wichita, Taovayas, Tawakoni, Yscani, Waco, and Kichai. Many of these groups apparently
entered the Southern Plains in the seventeenth century, probably from Kansas and southern
Nebraska, to escape the hostilities of the Osage (Webb and Carroll 1952:2:904). The Wichita
were true Plains Villagers, with an economy that was jointly dependent upon agriculture and
bison hunting. They occupied permanent villages of beehive-shaped, grass houses, from which
they conducted seminomadic bison hunts. In 1719 their villages were located along the Arkansas
River in northern Oklahoma (Hofman 1989b:95). By 1750, they had moved some of their
villages to southern Oklahoma, along the Red River. Others were located on the upper end of the
Sabine and Neches rivers in Texas, and subsequently on the middle Trinity and upper Brazos
14

rivers. In 1772, the year they concluded a nominal peace with the Spanish, one of their villages
was on the Salt Fork of the Brazos on the Lower Plains west of Dallas (John 1975: Map 3; Webb
and Carroll 1952:2:705). Wichita groups were included in treaties made with the Republic of
Texas in 1843 and with the United States government in 1837 and 1856 (Webb and Carroll
1952:2:709). In Texas they continued to live between the upper Brazos and Trinity rivers until
1855, when the Tawakoni and Waco were placed on the Brazos Indian Reservation, south of Fort
Belknap, in company with a number of other Native American remnant groups (Smith 1996;
Webb and Carroll 1952:1:212; 2:905). As a result of increasing animosity from white settlers, the
groups were subsequently removed to Indian Territory in 1859 (Smith 1996; Webb and Carroll
1952:1:210). The remnants of the Wichita moved to Kansas during the Civil War but returned to
Oklahoma after the war to settle permanently near present-day Anadarko (Hofman 1989b:95).
The Comanche, a Shoshonean group who originally resided along the upper Yellowstone and
Platte rivers, were nomadic Plains hunters, whose lifestyle depended upon the bison as a source
of meat and raw material for clothing and shelter, and upon the horse as a means of hunting and
transport. About the beginning of the eighteenth century, they began to migrate onto the
Southern Plains, where they drove a wedge between the Apache to the west (driving them farther
south and west) and the Pawnee and Wichita to the east. By the early nineteenth century, their
range was at its greatest extent, stretching from central Kansas to Austin, and from Oklahoma
City westward to Raton Pass in New Mexico. The most important divisions of the Comanche
consisted of the Yamparika (Root-Eaters), who ranged along the Arkansas River; the Kotsoteka
(Buffalo-Eaters), who were just to the south of the Yamparika; the Nokoni (Wanderers), who
occupied the territory along the Red River; the Quahadi (Antelope People), located on the High
Plains; and the Penateka (Honey-Eaters), who were the southernmost Comanche grouping in
Texas (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:385). The earliest known Comanche raid in Texas occurred in
1758, when they helped in the destruction of the mission of San SabÃ¡ de la Santa Cruz in presentday Menard County. For the next 117 years, they waged intermittent warfare against first the
Spanish, then the Mexicans, the Texans, and, finally, the United States (Webb and Carroll
1952:1:385). The Comanches were signatories to the 1867 Medicine Lodge Treaty with the
United States, in which they agreed to cede all of their territory except for a 5,546-square-mile
reservation in southwestern Oklahoma. Following a general uprising by the Comanche and
Kiowa in 1874, they were defeated by the United States army in 1875 and permanently confined
to their Oklahoma reservation (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:385).
Archeological remains that can be associated with these Protohistoric groups are rare compared to
the remains of earlier periods. Within the upper Trinity River basin, and in Dallas County itself,
little evidence of these historic Indian groups has been found, with the exception of a few Native
American sites with European items (Sollberger 1953). In actuality, all of these groups are better
represented in the regions that surround the upper Trinity River valley.
Groups of the Wichita Confederacy, being Plains Villagers, have left much more substantial
archeological remains. A number of villages belonging to historic Wichita groups have been
identified and investigated in Oklahoma, within Northcentral Texas, and along the boundary of
Northcentral Texas and Northeast Texas (Bell 1984; Fox 1983:41â46). On the basis of
excavations at the Pearson site in Rains County, Texas, due east of Dallas County, the NorteÃ±o
focus has been proposed for these historic Wichita components (Duffield and Jelks 1961). The
most extensive archeological work has been done at several sites along the Red River in Texas
and Oklahoma, near the present-day Texas town of Spanish Fort, northwest of Dallas County,
which is believed by some to be the site of the village attacked by Parilla in 1759 (Bell et al.
15

1967). The excavations at the Longest site (34Jfâ1) in Oklahoma documented the presence of a
fortified enclosure and circular grass-covered lodges. Artifactual material recovered from these
Wichita sites shows a mixture of artifacts of Native American manufacture and of materials
obtained in trade with the French or the Spanish. Artifacts of Native American manufacture
include triangular arrow points (i.e., Fresno, Harrell, and Washita), thick end scrapers on flakes,
diamond-shaped beveled knives, T-shaped perforators, bifacial gun flints, bison scapula hoes,
pottery elbow pipes, and Womack Engraved pottery. Trade artifacts found to be present at
Wichita sites include metal knives and knife handles; axes; splitting wedges; kettle fragments;
awls; chisels; scissors; buttons; flintlock gun parts; bullets and shot; bridle parts; metal ornaments
such as bells, finger rings, and bracelets; and numerous trade beads (Fox 1983:45).

HISTORIC CHRONOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK

Northcentral Texas Occupation
The pressure of the westward movement of Anglo-American settlers displaced numerous Native
Americans from their homelands north and east of Northcentral Texas. Delaware, Chickasaw,
Waco, Cherokee, Shawnee, Caddo, and Kichai sought refuge in Northcentral Texas. As the
Comanche and Kiowa attacked the less populated areas, skirmishes and raids were frequent in the
1830s.
The earliest Anglo-American settlers in the region were the inhabitants of Birdâs Fort in Tarrant
County, established in 1841, and John Neely Bryan, who settled in the Dallas area also in 1841.
Large-scale immigration into the region began with the Peters Colony. The first Peters Colony
contract between the Texas Emigration and Land Company and the Republic of Texas was signed
in August 1841; the second contract, signed in November 1841, included the project area (Connor
1959:36, 40; Ogle 1977:Figure 2).
Many residents of Dallas and Tarrant counties were born in the South and naturally supported the
Southern position on secession. Although no Civil War battles occurred in Northcentral Texas,
the war created several major problems for the inhabitants of the region. The war made it
difficult to import manufactured goods into the region, and the economic woes of the
Confederacy led to severe inflation, so that residents could not purchase products even when they
were available. In addition, the withdrawal of fighting men from the region contributed to the
retreat of the frontier, giving an increased potential for Native American attacks.
Northcentral Texas suffered an economic depression following the Civil War because of the
collapse of the Confederate currency. The region, however, was able to rebound. The 1872
arrival of the Houston & Texas Central railroad and the 1873 arrival of the Texas & Pacific
railroad in Dallas signaled the beginning of an economic boom for the area (Davis and Peterson
1991). Because of rail access to distant markets, the Dallas area became a major distribution
center for buffalo hides and a marketing center for cotton by the mid-1870s (Reese et al.
1986:164). Although much of Dallas County remained rural in character until after World War
II, urban expansion rapidly changed both the landscape and the way of life of local residents by
the early 1950s.

CHAPTER 4
METHODS

The Texas Site Atlas (nueces.thc.state.tx.us) was consulted prior to beginning fieldwork. Five
previously recorded archeological sites were mapped within a 1-mile radius of the project area.
The sites do not fall within the current APE and are discussed in the previous research section of
this report. There are 19 properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places within a 1mile radius of the project area, these are discussed in a separate report (Thomas 2007).
In addition to the site atlas search an examination of the Sanborn maps of the area was conducted
prior to conducting the reconnaissance survey. The project area is just outside of the 1885
Sanborn Map boundaries. The 1888 Sanborn depicts the southern end of the project area south of
St. Paul Street which was known as Masten Street at the time. There are two larger dwellings,
one with a stable. The Cumberland School is shown on the 1888 map as a small square building
at the corner of Cochran and School Streets (the east service road for Woodall Rodgers Freeway
and Akard Street). The 1892 Sanborn Map depicts the project area with Dallas Branch flowing
through the north end. Trinity Church is located just outside the project area at the corner of
Trinidad and Phelps Streets (the west service road and Olive Street). There are two fire hydrants
in the project area one on Harwood Street and one at the corner of Trinidad and Masten Streets
(West service road and St. Paul Street). The neighborhood is growing with larger lots divided
and new houses being built. The 1899 Sanborn Map shows Trinity Church has been demolished
leaving a vacant lot. The neighborhood is still growing, lots are becoming smaller and almost
every house has an associated stable. The 1905 Sanborn Map depicts even more houses;
however, fewer houses have associated stables. The fire hydrants appear in the same locations as
on the previous maps. The 1921 Sanborn Map shows the same fire hydrants, more houses and
even fewer stables. The Sanborn Maps dated 1921-1950 depict almost the entire project area
with businesses related to the automobile. There are used car lots, tires sales, automobile repair,
and auto upholstery shops. The fire hydrants are in the same location but have been altered to
triple hydrants. In addition the 1940 Dallas Zoning Map depicts the project area zoned as
commercial property. The Woodall Rodgers Freeway was completed in 1983.
The project area was surveyed traveling south along the service road which parallels the west side
of the Woodall Rodgers Freeway from Pearl Street to Akard Street. The survey continued east
along Akard Street for one block then turned north on the service road paralleling the east side of
the Woodall Rodgers Freeway and came to an end at the corner of Pearl Street and the west
17

service road. The vehicle was parked and the are was walked beginning at the corner of Pearl
Street and the east service road of the Woodall Rodgers Freeway turning south toward Akard
Street on the west side of the Woodall Rodgers Freeway, then turning left onto Akard Street
traveling east one block and turning left again onto the east service road and traveling north to
Pearl Street. Digital photographs were taken during the walk-over to document the conditions of
the APE.

CHAPTER 5
RESULTS

The entire APE is situated on a terrace on the east bank of the Trinity River, which has been
channelized. There are no natural features on the landscape in the project area and the mapped
soil for the area is Urban Land. The vegetation consists of small areas of manicured grass and
Pecan trees planted in rows along the roads paralleling the freeway (Figures 3 and 4). No natural
drainages were observed in the project area. The project area consists of Woodall Rodgers
Freeway, an excavated freeway, which has retaining walls on the east and west sides with bridges
for Pearl, Olive, Harwood, St. Paul, and Akard Streets running east/west over the freeway and
one curved, elevated, exit ramp from the freeway to St. Paul Street (Figures 5 and 6). There are
also two utility pipes that run east/west across the freeway, one on the south side of Pearl Street
and the other on the north side of Harwood Street (Figures 7 and 8). The east side of the APE is
bounded by the Dallas Museum of Art, The Nasher Sculpture Center, a parking area for the arts
district and the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center designed by I.M. Pei with the historic
Cumberland School outside the APE to the southeast (Figures 9â12). The west side is mostly
financial buildings, the Federal Reserve Bank, two Chase Bank branches, the Advancial Financial
Services Building, and the Precept Building (Figures 13â16). The space around the buildings is
parking lots or small landscaped areas of grass and trees (Figure 17). The construction of roads,
buildings, retaining walls, bridges, utilities and other infrastructure serving downtown Dallas has
disturbed the entire project area. No cultural material was observed in the APE during the
reconnaissance survey, and the likelihood of intact archeological resources is extremely low.

CHAPTER 6
RECOMMENDATIONS

The project consists of reconnaissance survey of existing right-of-way along the Woodall
Rodgers Freeway between Pearl and Akard Streets in downtown Dallas, Texas. The APE
consists of the street right-of-way and is 1,269 feet (386 meters) long and 316 feet (96 meters)
wide. Although the Sanborn Maps indicate the area was residential from the mid 1880s to the
early twentieth century and transitioned to automobile related businesses in the 1920s through the
1950s, no evidence of these resources are likely. Due to the highly developed urban environment
and the lack of natural drainages or landforms in the project area, it is highly unlikely that the
area would contain any subsurface archeological deposits with contextual integrity. The results
of the reconnaissance survey found that the entire project area has been adversely affected by
previous construction, primarily the excavation and construction of Woodall Rodgers Freeway.
No cultural materials were identified during the survey, and the likelihood of archeological
historic properties in the current survey area is extremely low. As a result of these investigations,
it is recommended that the proposed construction of a deck above the Woodall Rodgers Freeway
will not adversely affect archeological deposits or historic properties and that no further work is
required.
