Aycock Shelter. This is a smal! rock shelter (Site No. 39D4-12)
located on Kell Branch, a small tributary of the Leon River, some nine
miles north of Belton in Bell County, Texas. The shelter contained
shal!ow midden refuse and 32 human burials. It was excavated in
1935-36 and reported by Watt (1936), along with studies of the
skeletal materials by Aynesworth (1936), Lux (1936), and Turner
(1936).
Suhm (1960: 90) evaluates the Aycock Shelter as follows: "Both
later Edwards Plateau Aspect and Central Texas Aspect (Toyah Focus
only) represented. The bulk of the midden deposit, however, appears
to belong to the Edwards Plateau Aspect. Only a few of the burials
were associated with artifacts--projectile points in all cases. Some of
the points were very likely the cause of death. The cultural affiliations
of the burials are difficult to determine, but presumably represented individuals of both aspects."
The fill in the Aycock Shelter ranged from six inches at the rear
of the shelter to 32 inches near the overhang. This fill consisted mainly
of midden debris covered by an unbroken surface layer, 6 to 10 inches
thick, composed of limestone flour derived from the ceiling of the
shelter. There were no fire pits or similar features anywhere in the
shelter. The charcoal consisted of small scattered fragments co!lected
from depths of 1£ to 18 inches in Square 35-40/6-10, an area containing several burials at depths ranging from eight to £8 inches below
the surface.
In 1956 this charcoal sample was sent to the Magnolia Laboratories
in Dallas and was designated as FRL No. RC-24. It was processed in
1957 and the report of the same year states: "... it did not contain
enough carbon for a reliable date. We estimate its age to be more than
10,000 years."
Clark Site. This site (No. 39B9-25) consists of a thin midden zone
buried in Brazos River alluvium five miles upstream from the northern city limits of Waco, McLennan County, Texas. The midden layer

is approximately 35 feet above the normal low-water level of the
Brazos River, and is located on a small point of land lying between
the Brazos and a small eastern tributary. When discovered, the midden was overlain by 26 inches of sand; but the surface at this locality
had been leveled for construction purposes, so that the original thickness of the overlying sand stratum is unknown.
A rock-lined hearth lay near the base of the midden, which rested
on a sterile gray sand. This hearth contained ashes, charcoal, and eight
large bone fragments of the whitetail deer (Dama virginianus). In
1957 the charcoal (Sample FRL No. RC-23) was dated by the Magnolia Laboratories as 680 - 150 years (A.D. 1277 +-- 150).
This date throws light on the age of the Sanders Focus, for artifacts
at the hearth level included potsherds of Canton Incised and Sanders
Engraved, as well as a number of Alba type arrowpoints. Approximately 95% of the projectile points from the hearth level were of
Alba type.
The recent excavation of this site was a project of the Central Texas
Archeological Society and a detailed manuscript report is on file with
the Society in Waco.

Two Radiocarbon Dates ]rom the Galena Site o]
Southeastern Texas
The Galena site is a shell midden located near the mouth of Hunting Bayou, in Galena Park, some 10 miles east of the central downtown business district of Houston, Harris County, Texas. Excavation
in 1958-59 indicated an occupation attributable to the Galveston Bay
Focus. The stratigraphy at this site is as follows: an upper layer of
dark sandy loam, six inches thick; a middle layer of compact shell
in a matrix of dark sandy loam, !2 inches thick; and a lower layer
of red-brown sandy clay, six inches thick, resting on a bed of sterile
gray-brown clay. Two shell samples from the middle shell layer have
been assayed by the Geochemical Laboratory, Exploration Department, Humble Oil and Refining Company, Houston, Texas.
Sample 0-911. Shells of Bang& cuneata (a brackish-water clam),
were collected (May, 1959) from the top of the middle layer of compact shell. These shells were in direct contact with Goose Creek potsherds, flint dart points, and other artifacts associated with an unidentified phase of the Galveston Bay Focus. The age determination
reported (June 26, 1959) was: 1900 - 105 years ago, or A.D. 59 "+" 105.
Sample 0-912. Shells of Rangia cuneata were collected (May, !959)
from the basal part of the middle layer of compact shell, and these
were also in contact with Goose Creek potsherds, flint dart points, and
other artifacts associated with an unidentified phase of the Galveston
Bay Focus. The age determination reported (June 26, 1959) was:
3550 -- 115 years, or 1391 --115 B.C.
An evaluation of these dates appears elsewhere in this issue of the
Bulletin.

A Radiocarbon Date ]rom Central Texas
A sample of charcoal from the Crumley site, an Edwards Plateau
Aspect site of Travis County, has been dated by the Geochemical
Laboratory of the Humble Oi! and Refining Company, Houston,
Texas, This sample came from the transition zone between Stratum 1
and Stratum 2 and represents the initial phase of occupation at this
site. Stratum 1 contained no artifacts other than those in the transition
zone, and in Stratum 2 the dominant projectile point types were Bulverde, Nolan, and Travis. Pedernales points were numerous at this

330

TEXAS AIICHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

site, but were concentrated in Stratum 4.0nly three Pedernales points
occurred in Stratum 2 (Stratum 3 was sterile), but 150 Pedernales
points occurred in Stratum 4.
The age determination of this sample (0-1315) is 3275 - 125 years
or 1315 +- 125 B.c. This is the first radiocarbon date from a pure component of the Edwards Plateau culture, and it supports the contention
that certain dart point types preceded others in the Edwards Plateau
Aspect. The Crumley site is reported in this issue of the Bulletin of
the Texas Archeological Society (Vol. 31, for 1960).

A Radiocarbon Date Jrom Goebel Midden,
Austin County
Carbonized wood, including acorns, from a hearth in the lower
part of this midden has been dated by the Shell Development Company, Houston, Texas, at 4530 - 80 years, or 2569 - 80 B.C. The Shell
Development Company report, dated June 12, 1961, designates the
sample by report Number 8205, Book Number 1173.
The Goebel Midden has thus far been excavated to a depth of 120
inches below the present surface. In the midden deposit scattered potsherds and arrowpoints were found down to a depth of approximately
36 inches below the surface. From this level downward occurred artifacts assignable to the Archaic Stage, some dart point types, such as
Pedernales, indicating relationship with the Edwards Plateau Aspect
of central Texas. The carbonized wood was collected from a hearth
area containing thermally fractured sandstone situated at a depth of
106 to 108 inches. The sample provides the first radiocarbon date for
the Archaic Stage of southeastern Texas.
