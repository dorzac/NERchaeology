Lone Mountain conducted an intensive survey of every source point and every third receiver
line on University Lands only, in accordance with THC guidelines. These lines are approximately 201 m apart. University Lands is a political subdivision of the State of Texas. Consequently, this project falls within the purview of the Antiquities Code of Texas, which requires
the THC to review actions that have the potential to disturb cultural resources in the public
domain. Lone Mountain archaeologists, Jeffrey Clarke, Randolph Davis, Nicolas Hostetter,
Patrick Lagodney, Noel Pacheco, Jeremy Pittman, Casey Somerville, Steven Storer, and Zack
Whalen performed this survey between November 7 and 25, 2018. Douglas Boggess is serving as Principal Investigator. This non-collection survey was conducted under Antiquities Permit 8608, according to guidelines established in Archaeological Survey Standards for Texas,
published by the Texas Historical Commission.

awson Geophysical proposes to conduct the Tunis Creek 3-D seismic survey on
University Lands in Pecos County, Texas. The project area is a grid composed of
source lines crossed by receiver lines. Seismic exploration is non-invasive and involves placing
geophones along receiver lines by crews either walking or using ATVs. Vibroseis trucks will
travel along source lines. No drilling or grubbing is proposed. No subsurface ground-disturbing activities will occur. Reroutes for both source and receiver lines will be surveyed around
each cultural resource site encountered to insure that no site will be affected.

The project area encompasses 1,493.01 acres of University Lands within Block 18, Sections
7, 18, 19, and 30; Block 19, Sections 2, 9, 10, 11, and 12; and Block 20, Sections 1, 2, 3, 5,
6, and 7 in Pecos County, Texas and can be found on the Bootleg Canyon, TX 30102-H6
and Skyscraper Peak, TX 30102-G4 7.5' USGS Quadrangles.
Sixteen previously-recorded sites were documented within the search radius. One of these,
41PC441, was found to be offline for this project and was not revisited. Lone Mountain visited the locations of the remaining 15 sites, finding no cultural remains at 10 of these
(41PC434 through 41PC440, 41PC611, 41PC964, and 41PC765), and re-recording the
remaining five (41PC79, 41PC442, 41PC443, 41PC615, and 41PC616). Three newlyencountered sites (41PC849, 41PC851, and 41PC852) and nine isolated occurrences were
also recorded during this work. Previously-recorded sites 41PC79, 41PC442, 41PC443, and
41PC615 consist of extensive scatters of lithic artifacts, fire-cracked rock, and fire-cracked
rock features along Tunis Creek and are likely part of one large archaeological landscape
broken up by the creek and by private land. Projectile points identified at these sites range
from the Paleoindian Period (8700 B.C.) through the Late Prehistoric Period (A.D. 1750),
with most dating to the Archaic Period. Historic components made up of roadside refuse
are present on 41PC79, 41PC442, and 41PC443. A historic telephone line dating between

ii

A.D, 1930 and 1940 is present on 41PC615. 41PC616 is the "Old Lower Road," a stage
and military road dating between A.D. 1849 and A.D. 1920. Newly-encountered sites
41PC849 and 41PC852 have undated lithic artifact assemblages identified as Unknown
Aboriginal (10,500 B.C, to A.D. 1860), and 41PC851 has a large projectile point suggesting
an Archaic-period (6600 B.C. to A.D. 700) component, Of the previously recorded sites that
were not encountered, only 41PC611 may have been misplotted and is recommended to
have an undetermined eligibility for nomination to the NRHP and as a State Antiquities
Landmark (SAL). The other locations lacked cultural remains and are recommended ineligible for nomination to the NRHP and as SALs. All of the sites encountered, with the exception of 41PC852, are recommended eligible for nomination to the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) and for listing as SALs. Site 41PC852 is recommended ineligible for
nomination to the NRHP and as an SAL. The isolated occurrences have been recorded in
their entirety and no further work is recommended.
The proposed undertaking was redesigned so that all smaller sites and the portions of larger
sites that contribute to SAL or NRHP eligibility would be avoided. The undertaking will be
rerouted to existing disturbed areas, in order that seismic trucks may avoid cultural materials
by at least 30 m. The GIS shapefiles for the sites and their reroutes will be given to the project proponent so that these locations can be programmed into GPS units carried in seismic
vehicles. All project-generated documentation will be curated at TARL. The Texas Historical
Commission (THC) has recommended that all NRHP and SAL-eligible sites be monitored.
If buried cultural deposits or other unexpected discoveries are encountered during the project, work should cease immediately, and the Texas Historical Commission should be notified.

The surveyed area falls along Tunis Creek (AKA Tunas Creek), near Tunis Spring (aka Tunas Spring; formerly
known as Escondido Spring). Tunis Creek is a tributary of the Pecos River, and the spring is located alongside
the watercourse. This area falls on Comanchean limestones of the Edwards-Trinity (Plateau) aquifer. Cabeza de
Vaca may have stopped at Tunas Spring. The spring was described by Captain William Whiting of the U.S. Cavalry in 1849 as a clear, beautiful spring gushing from the limestone bluff on the north side of Tunis Creek
(Brune 1975).
The proposed project is located within the Trans-Pecos region, the northernmost portion of the Chihuahua
Desert. Elevation is between 2,900 and 3,150 ft amsl. Soils are predominantly within the Ector association,
comprised of shallow eolian sediments, with residual gravels and large rocky outcrops.
The project area falls within the Chihuahuan Desert. The average daily maximum temperature is 76 degrees
Fahrenheit and the average daily minimum temperature is 44 degrees Fahrenheit. The average annual precipitation is 7.7 inches, ranging from a low of 0.1 inches in April to a high of 1.4 inches in August (Rives 1980).

one Mountain Archaeological Services, Inc. (Lone Mountain) conducted an intensive
survey of every source point and every third receiver line.

Vegetation is sparse, and includes creosote, mesquite, four-wing saltbush, tarbrush, acacia, soaptree yucca,
prickly pear, cane cholla, Christmas tree cholla, Spanish bayonet, ocotillo, horse crippler cactus, and various
forbs and grasses. Surface visibility is between 80 percent and 90 percent.

The proposed project falls within a small sample of the Trans-Pecos region of west Texas, near enough to the
neighboring Southern Plains region to contain, at various times, cultural traits familiar to archaeologists working in the Southwest and on the Southern Plains. The current project is a reconnaissance, non-collection, no
disturbance pedestrian survey. Given the location of the survey area, it is possible that a wide range of cultural
resources representing a considerable time span may be encountered. While the survey is aimed at identifying
these cultural resources, they must be placed in an established cultural context in order for their data potential
to be fully realized.

The Paleoindian period is evidenced in the study area by isolated projectile points.

Although Paleoindian groups probably utilized small game and plant foods in addition to large game species,
a change in subsistence strategy to full reliance on these food sources marks the transition to the Archaic from
the Paleoindian period. Large-scale climatic changes and the extinction of megafauna caused people to
develop a more diverse subsistence base. Mobility was cyclical and more restricted in extent, compared to
Paleoindian strategies. Once productive resource procurement locations were established, these were often
reused on a seasonal basis.

Folsom sites date from 9000 to 8200 B.C. The Folsom complex exhibits technological distinctions from the
Clovis complex. Diagnostic projectile points include fluted Folsom and unfluted Midland points, which are similar in outline. In addition to these points, the tool assemblages include spoke shaves, end scrapers, perforators, knives, denticulates, drills, choppers, awls, and abrading stones (Cordell 1997). Plano sites are generally
thought of as forming the terminal elements of the Paleoindian big game hunting tradition. Plano is known
for a number of artifact complexes. Each complex is distinguished by a series of large lanceolate and unfluted
projectile points, including Angostura, Frederick, Firstview, and Scottsbluff.

Three distinct complexes have been identified in west Texas for the Paleoindian period: Clovis, Folsom, and
Plano (a Dalton complex is known in the east). In general archaeological sites are assigned to particular complexes of the Paleoindian period based on the presence of distinctive diagnostic projectile points. The earliest
complex, Clovis, generally dates from as early as 10,500 to 9000 B.C. The tool assemblage is characterized by
Clovis points (which are bifacially worked lanceolate projectile points with a concave base), transverse end
scrapers, side scrapers, bifacial knives, gravers, perforators, and hammerstones (Cordell 1997).

CH A P TE R

Human settlement in North America is first identified during the Paleoindian period (10,500 to 6500 B.C.).
Despite some evidence indicating a human presence in the New World earlier than 10,500 B.C., Anderson and
Faught (2000) argue that current evidence is insufficient to describe any cultural trends prior to the appearance of the Clovis complex at around 10,500 B.C., Hayden's (1976) arguments for the Malpais pre-San Dieguito/San Dieguito material notwithstanding (Heilen 2004). The Paleoindian period is characterized by a
subsistence strategy focused on hunting now-extinct Pleistocene megafauna, including Bison antiquus and
mammoth. Diagnostic stone tools associated with this period include end scrapers and large, unstemmed lanceolate projectile points, which are often fluted. It is postulated that during this period, points were attached
to thrusting spears. A reliance on big game hunting has been established, but it is unclear to what extent
these people exploited other available resources such as plants (Judge 1982). Little evidence has been found to
suggest the use of structures during this period. From negative evidence, it has been assumed that people
lived a nomadic lifestyle with the use of structures apparently uncommon.

This change in food procurement is marked by wide-ranging changes in the Archaic tool assemblage. While
Paleoindian assemblages consist mainly of projectile points and meat processing tools, a growing number of
groundstone implements suggest a greater reliance on plant foods at this time. Archaic projectile points are
shorter than those of the Paleoindian period, and larger than arrow points used during the following Ceramic
period. Points of this period are generally stemmed or corner-notched, and exhibit more extensive morphological variability and less precision in the quality of manufacture than those of the Paleoindian period.
The Archaic period is typically divided into an Early (6500 to 3500 B.C.), Middle (3500 to 1200 B.C.) and Late
Archaic (1200 B.C. to A.D. 700), with the last few four hundred years between A.D. 300 and 700 referred to
as a Transitional period, when new technologies such as pottery and the bow and arrow seem to have slowly
come into use.

The Spanish may have entered west Texas prior to A.D. 1536, when Alvar NuÃ±ez Cabeza de Vaca, surviving a
shipwreck in the Gulf of Mexico, possibly west Texas or portions of northern Mexico just to the south, crossed
into Arizona and making his way south into Mexico (Cabeza de Vaca 1983), though others argue that he was
already well to the south in northern Mexico (e.g., Weber 1992). Cabeza de Vaca's initial report concerning
the lands to the north led to a 1539 expedition by Fray Marcos de Niza. Cabeza de Vaca's and de Niza's
reports in turn prompted Francisco VÃ¡zquez de Coronado to lead the 1540 expedition in search of riches to be
found in the fabled cities of âQuiviraâ (Katz and Katz 1985). West Texas came to be used as a route by later
Spanish explorers to areas north and east. Subsequent expeditions were led by Fray Agustin RodrÃ­guez and
Captain Francisco Sanchez Chamuscado in 1581, Antonio de Espejo in 1582, Don Juan de OÃ±ate y Salazar in
1598, and Gaspar CastaÃ±o de Sosa in 1590 (Kessell 1987). Following the establishment of Spanish settlements, presidios, and missions in what had become their northern frontier region, Dominguez de Mendoza
passed near the area in 1683 and Juan de Ugalde led an expedition into the area to pacify or otherwise
impress the Apache in 1787.

The end of the late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic period is sometimes referred to as the Protohistoric period. Projectile points decrease in size, with small triangular points becoming the predominant type.
Many early Protohistoric sites appear to have been contemporary with Ochoa-phase settlements and may represent the appearance of Athabaskans in the region. The Spanish encountered Jumano (first called Teya) and
Apache (Querecho) groups in the area, and with European contact, metal projectile points appeared. The
Kiowa to the north speak a Tanoan language similar to that spoken in the Tanoan pueblos (Newcomb 1961).
Jelinek (1967) has suggested the Jornada Mogollon from the Fort Sumner area formed the ancestral core of
the Kiowa, who then ranged north and east pursuing bison, while the Jumano are possibly descended from
more southerly Jornada Mogollon (Newcomb 1961). However, establishing such pedigrees is difficult considering how poorly understood the movements of populations are at the end of the Formative period and
throughout the Protohistoric period.

CH A P TE R

The Late Prehistoric period is characterized by the adoption of the bow and arrow and the frequent use of
pottery. Any pottery found in the area may include many of the same types found in southeastern New Mexico
(e.g., brownwares and Chupadero Black-on-white, a decorated type frequently made in central New Mexico).
The earliest use of ceramics in southeastern New Mexico was initially suggested to have occurred between
A.D. 600 and 900 (Lehmer 1948, Corley 1965, Jelinek 1967). However, more recently, radiocarbon dates have
been obtained from a limited number of sites indicating that ceramics may have appeared as early as A.D. 200
(LeBlanc 1982). While the appearance of villages next to agricultural fields and reliable water sources appears
to have accompanied these new technologies in neighboring regions, current evidence suggests that life in
much of this part of the Southern Plains continued to resemble that of the preceding Archaic period, with an
increased reliance on bison toward the end of the period.

Native groups present in the area during the Spanish Colonial period were nomadic. Early Spanish records
indicate several native groups on the Llano Estacado including Apaches, Querechos, Vaqueros, and Teyas. Apachean groups extended their range to the southern portion of the state sometime in the 1500s. By about
1630, the Apache were ranging as far south along the Pecos as the Seven Rivers area. During the early 1700s,
Comanches and their allies drove the Apache from the Plains. The Apache settled in the Pecos Valley and in
the mountains of southeastern New Mexico. By the early to mid-1800s Comancheros had established trade
with the Pueblos, Comanche, and other residents of the Plains.
There were no permanent settlements in the area by Pueblo or Hispanic groups during the Spanish Colonial
period (Olmstead 1975). Traders were moving through the area on the Chihuahua Trail by 1840 Following the
Mexican-American War, the US Army established a fort at Comanche Springs, approximately 26 miles west of
the current project area, and named it Fort Stockton. Fort Stockton was established to protect the San Antonio-El Paso mail and was on the Butterfield Overland Mail route. A Peter Gallagher established a town named
St. Gall nearby to provide services for the fort in 1868. In 1871, Pecos County was established at St. Gall. By

The most significant historic site evaluated by this survey is the Old Spanish Trail, a segment of which led from
the Pecos River to Tunis Springs and beyond. Tunis Springs lies approximately 5 miles west of the project area,
alongside the creek. The spring was a favorite stopping point for the Comanche and many others, as reflected
by the dense cultural materials along the creek. Experimental camel trains stopped here in the late 1800's
(Brune 1975). Stagecoach stops along the Old Spanish Trail are present in the surrounding area.

the 1880s the fort had closed and St. Gall was renamed Fort Stockton. The Kansas City, Mexico, and Orient
Railroad was built through the county in 1913, reviving interest in land speculation and irrigation. An oil boom
in the county in 1927 and additional oil booms occurred in the early 1950s as more oil fields were discovered.

The locations of previously-recorded archaeological sites within 50 ft of the proposed seismic lines were visited
and, if relocated, updated during the current work. The locations of non-relocated sites were subject to shovel
testing to determine if any subsurface cultural materials remain intact.
When cultural remains predating 1965 were encountered, a determination was made as to whether they were
an isolated occurrence or a site (as defined below), and the materials recorded accordingly.

Isolated occurrences are cultural remains that do not qualify as sites. They generally consist of single artifacts or
artifact scatters that are of extremely low density and are widely dispersed, and are indicative of a single or
unintentional activity. Isolated occurrences are often found in redeposited context and cannot be related to
other nearby sites or isolated occurrences. In addition, isolated occurrences are generally 50 years old or older,
although Lone Mountain may record more recent materials as isolates if there is a sound reason for documenting their presence. Isolated occurrences were recorded in the field on the Lone Mountain isolated occurrence
form, a GPS reading was taken, and their locations were plotted on the USGS quadrangle.

Sites may be defined as a certain number of cultural materials greater than 50 years in age such as five or more
artifacts in a 15 sq m area, or one or more features. These are the physical locations of past human activities or
events. Cultural resource sites are extremely variable in size, and range from a cluster of several objects or
materials to structures with associated objects and features. A site may consist of secondarily deposited cultural resource remains. Features such as hearths, cairns, rock alignments, masonry concentrations, burned
adobe, fire-cracked rock concentrations, cists, corrals, and rock art are generally recorded as sites. Sites also
include definite locations of traditional cultural or religious importance to specified social or cultural groups.
Furthermore, sites are at least 50 years old, unless it can be demonstrated that a property has achieved exceptional importance within the past 50 years (Criterion Consideration G).

The survey was conducted according to guidelines established in Archaeological Survey Standards for Texas,
published by the Texas Historical Commission. Data for this project was gathered employing traditional pedestrian survey methodology. Archaeologists performed this survey in 15-m interval transects. Especially intensive
low-interval survey was conducted in areas where previously-recorded sites were expected within or near the
project area.

Between November 7 and 25, 2018, Lone Mountain archaeologists, Jeffrey Clarke, Randolph Davis, Nicolas
Hostetter, Patrick Lagodney, Noel Pacheco, Jeremy Pittman, Casey Somerville, Steven Storer, and Zack Whalen
conducted an intensive survey of every source point and every third receiver line on University Lands only, in
accordance with THC guidelines. These lines were approximately 201 m apart.

one Mountain visited the locations of 15 previously recorded sites, finding no cultural
remains at 10 of these and re-recording the remaining five. Three newly encountered
sites and nine isolated occurrences were also recorded during this work.

All observed cultural material was recorded according to Council of Texas Archaeologists (CTA) guidelines,
using a Lone Mountain Site Record or Isolated Occurrence form. Forms and paperwork used in the field are
intended to facilitate the easy entry of a site description into the TexSite system.
Site boundaries were determined by the distribution of observed cultural materials. A sketch map was drawn
of each site, and site locations were plotted on the appropriate USGS quadrangle. Lone Mountain used a GPS
to plot the site datum and as well as all features and diagnostic artifacts, took digital photographs of the site

The current work has revealed that the floodplain of Tunis Creek encompasses a series of large sites with Late
Paleoindian through Late Prehistoric remains on the surface (see descriptions below). Shovel testing took place
on all of these sites in settings that had potential for buried cultural materials.
In adherence to survey standards, shovel tests were at least 30 cm in diameter or on a side and were excavated
to the bottom of Holocene deposits, when possible. The tests were excavated in levels no thicker than 20 cm,
with sediments screened through Â¼-inch mesh unless high clay or water content required that they be troweled through.

If encountered, sites were to be further evaluated as to their NRHP eligibility status. The key criterion for most
prehistoric sites is the potential of the site to contain additional data relevant to future research (i.e., NRHP Criterion D). The potential for important additional data is often dependent on the presence or absence of buried
cultural deposits. On each site, the possibility of buried cultural deposits was assessed by a variety of means as
noted above. Observations were noted regarding the likelihood of buried cultural deposits based on several
characteristics. For example, indications of potential site depth include stratigraphic soil profiles exposed along
road cuts and arroyos or cultural materials in the back-dirt piles of rodent burrows.

Portions of the surveyed lines crossed existing networks of roads, well pads and oil-field facilities, flowlines, inuse and abandoned pipelines, and other oilfield-related installations. These disturbances either destroy or
expose otherwise buried cultural remains. Shovel testing was to take place along the corridor within areas of
prior disturbance that contained appropriate soil types and areas on which surface visibility was less than 30
percent, except on slopes greater than 20 percent. Because visibility was more than 80 percent in these disturbed areas throughout the project area, no test excavations were undertaken along disturbed portions of the
surveyed corridor or in areas that lacked appropriate soil types

Shovel testing was to take place along the survey corridor wherever potential for buried cultural deposits
seemed apparent, especially along the floodplain surrounding Tunis Creek; at archaeological sites; and at the
locations of any non-relocated site that might have fallen within 50 feet of the seismic lines. According to
guidelines, at least six shovel tests were to be excavated within each site to prospect for buried cultural deposits and locate site boundaries.

setting, any features, and any temporally diagnostic artifacts (ceramics and points). A representative sample of
artifacts from each site was recorded using Lone Mountain artifact analysis forms. Examinations of rodent burrows, road cuts, drainages, and other disturbed locations were employed to determine if subsurface cultural
deposits were present. Buried charcoal, ash, artifacts, burned rock, or buried cultural strata constitute subsurface cultural materials. Features were trowel or shovel tested, but otherwise left in place. No artifacts or samples were collected.

Partially buried late historic and recent materials observed throughout the project area indicate that eolian processes operate at a rapid pace. In many environments, when the phrase âburied cultural materialâ is used, the
term âintactâ is usually implied. However, in an active dunal environment where burial, deflation, and reburial
of cultural strata may take place over the matter of just a few years, evidence for buried cultural material is not
necessarily evidence for intact buried cultural material. This adds another layer of difficulty to the evaluation of
sites. However, even a deflated site may be considered eligible for nomination to the NRHP, especially if more
than 100 artifacts are present. In the case of historic sites, NRHP Criteria A, B, and C are more likely to be relevant. The relationship between the resources within the project area and the historical context of the project
area were taken into account when evaluating these sites.
Because the survey area is located on University Lands, sites are also assessed for eligibility for designation as
State Antiquities Landmarks (SAL), as detailed in Texas Administrative Code Title 13, Rule 26.10. Criteria to be
considered include:

7

5. there is a high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur, and the official
landmark designation is needed to ensure maximum legal protection, or alternatively, further investigations are
needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and relic collecting when the site cannot be protected. (Texas
Administrative Code Title 13, Rule 26.10)

Lone Mountain visited the locations of 15 previously recorded sites, finding no cultural remains at 10 of these
(Figures 2.1 through 2.3) and re-recording the remaining five. Three newly encountered sites and nine isolated
occurrences were also recorded. UTM Locations are described and plotted in Appendices A and B.

Lone Mountain performed a files search of the THC Archaeological Site Atlas and the NRHP on October 24,
2018 to identify all previously recorded sites and surveys within 1 mi of the survey corridor. The THC TexSite
Atlas shows seven cultural resource surveys crossing or falling very near the project area (Table 2.1 and TARL
site atlas map, attached). Previous work suggests a wide variety of site types including rock shelters, lithic procurement/activity areas, burned rock middens/mounds, and historic sites related to the Old Spanish Trail.
Of the 40 sites previously identified by the above listed projects, 17 are located on University lands within the
boundaries of the proposed project area, two of which (41PC441 and 41PC617) are offline and were not revisited during the current work. Of these sites, six have been previously determined eligible. Of these six, at least
five are large sites extending thousands of meters, and at least two other previously recorded sites falling on
University lands within the project area appear to be large enough to offer challenges to the âflag and avoidâ
strategy favored for this kind of undertaking. The larger prehistoric sites (such as 41PC79, 41PC442, 41PC443,
41PC764, 41PC765) are described as a series of âpockets of intact remainsâ or scatters and clusters of lithic
debitage, in the case of the creekside larger sites (41PC79, 41PC442, and 41PC443), the intact features are
surrounded by large quantities of fire-cracked rock that may or not may mask buried cultural remains on the
landscape.

If any obvious âbreaksâ (empty ground) are encountered between fire-cracked rock scatters on these sites,
Lone Mountain may reroute the undertaking through these empty areas, insuring that portions of the site containing features or other elements that contribute to NRHP eligibility are avoided and left intact. This is
achieved through GPS mapping of the loci (areas) within the site boundary containing archaeological remains.
Lone Mountain's usual strategy on these large âlandscape sitesâ that cannot be navigated through is to
restrict vehicle traffic to existing roads crossing these sites and previously disturbed areas within the sites (I.e.,
well pads, etc.). Seismic source points that cannot be relocated to these existing roads, disturbed areas, or outside of the sites are simply âdroppedâ from the undertaking.
Site 41PC616, the âOld Lower Road,â a road from El Paso to San Antonio, crosses the entire project area and
has been previously determined eligible for nomination to the NRHP. Unlike some historic roads and trails that
become ranch or oil field service roads, this road appears to have fallen out of use and is visible as a line of
vegetation on aerial photographs. With linear sites, Lone Mountain has found that restricting vehicle crossings

41PC435 (Figure 2.4) was originally recorded as a single isolated chert flake, one of a string of isolated artifacts
recorded as sites (41PC435 through 41PC440) by HPG (Madden 1983). HPG conducted a pedestrian survey at
that time and excavated four shovel tests at this location, finding no buried cultural deposits (Madden 1983).
Though no NRHP or SAL recommendations were made at that time, HPG archaeologists recommended additional investigations take place (Madden 1983). Turpin (2009) noted that these isolated artifacts are associated
with an extensive encampment along Tunis Creek made up of 41PC79, 41PC442, 41PC443, and 41PC615
(Turpin 2009:36-37). It is unclear whether Turpin revisited this location or based this interpretation on site
records.
The plotted location associated with this site falls near a large industrial complex to the west and a bladed road
to the north, but does not appear to have been directly affected by these developments. Surface visibility in
the location is 90 percent. Lone Mountain surveyed this location, finding no artifacts, and excavated a shovel
test, again finding no buried cultural remains. The shovel test encountered a profile consistent with the Reagan-Hodgins association, nearly level. This soil association is found in valleys with Reagan soils further upslope
than the Hodgins soils and typically have a 20-cm deep A horizon overlying an 80-cm deep B horizon (Rives
1980). The upper 15 cm was a gravelly brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay loam and became a more compact yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silty clay loam to a depth of 42 cm, ending at a compact stratum. Due to lack of any cultural remains in the vicinity of the plotted location and a negative shovel test, Lone Mountain concurs with
Turpin's (2009) classification of the previously-reported artifact as an isolated occurrence. Therefore site
41PC435 has little research value and is recommended not eligible for listing on the NRHP or as a SAL. No
additional work is recommended at this location.

41PC434 (Figure 2.4) was a 300-m by 700-meter prehistoric site originally recorded in 1983 by Heartfield,
Price, and Greene (HPG; Madden 1983) for a proposed pipeline. Turpin noted that 41PC434 is "essentially part
of 41PC443" (probably a mistype as the 41PC442 falls closest) (Turpin 2009:32). The site was described as a
lithic procurement area containing numerous pieces of flaked-stone debitage and cores, located on a slope
overlooking Tunis Creek to the south (Madden 1983). The site was reported to have no features, though scattered fire-cracked rock was found in places (Madden 1983). Lone Mountain thoroughly examined the plotted
location and found chert nodules and naturally-occurring spalls, but no clearly identifiable artifacts. It is possible that spalls and shattered chert fragments were mistaken for artifacts, or that, as Turpin (2009:32) has suggested, the site was misplotted and fell within the boundaries identified for 41PC442, 105 m to the
southwest. The plotted site location lies on chert outcrops and could not be shovel tested. This site has been
previously recommended eligible for nomination to the NRHP and for listing as an SAL. Lone Mountain can
provide no revised recommendations concerning the site's eligibility.

This site is plotted just east of 41PC435, just south of a bladed road and an overhead utility line. The immediate area appears relatively undisturbed. Surface visibility in the area of the plotted location is 90 percent. Lone
Mountain surveyed this location, finding no artifacts, and excavated a shovel test, finding no buried cultural
remains. The shovel test contained sediments consistent with the Reagan-Hodgins association, nearly level.
This soil association is found in valleys, with Reagan soils further upslope than the Hodgins soils and typically
have a 20-cm deep A horizon overlying an 80-cm deep B horizon (Rives 1980). The upper stratum contained
gravelly brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay loam to approximately 16 cm deep, and became a more compact yellowish
brown (10YR 6/4) silty clay loam to a depth of 34 cm, ending at hard pan. Based on the lack of any cultural
remains in the vicinity of the plotted location and a negative shovel test, Lone Mountain agrees with Turpin's

research value and is recommended not eligible for listing on the NRHP or as a SAL. No additional work is recommended at this location.

41PC436 (Figure 2.5) was originally recorded as an isolated artifact, one of a string of isolated artifacts

could take place (Madden 1983). Turpin has noted that the isolated artifacts HPG identified are associated

During the current investigation, Lone Mountain examined the plotted location as identified in THC records.
This location falls on a source line. Soils in the area are identified as belonging to the Lozier-Rock outcrop association, steep. This soil association is found on hills and includes stony loams that are no more than 10 cm
deep and exposed bedrock (Rives 1980). The location examined lies on exposed bedrock and no shovel testing
was possible. Lone Mountain found no clearly-identifiable artifacts in the plotted location, though broken
white chert nodules with yellow-orange cortex are present. It is possible that artifacts have washed downslope
and become buried under shallow colluvial deposits or that previous or current investigators have mistaken the
nature of the materials on the site as either artifacts or naturally occurring broken rocks. Though the area
investigated by Lone Mountain resembled the images in the 2009 report, it is also possible that the site was
misplotted and was in fact further off line and not encountered by Lone Mountain. The site has been previously determined eligible for nomination to the NHRP. Because the site may have been off-line and not
encountered by this survey, no recommendation concerning NRHP or SAL eligibility is offered at this time. The

features have likewise dispersed. It is also possible that these remains became buried in very shallow soils on
top of this landform. This site has been previously recommended ineligible for nomination to the NRHP under
any of the four criteria and for listing as an SAL. Because the site was not encountered by this survey, no
revised recommendations concerning NRHP or SAL eligibility are offered at this time. Two source lines crossed

41PC764 (Figure 2.8) was recorded in 2012 by TAS as a 130-m by 620-m open campsite consisting of a lithic
artifact scatter and four "dispersed hearths near the edge of the landform" (Turner and Turpin 2012:11). This
site is plotted in the location identified in Texas Site Atlas records as 41PC764, but is plotted and described in
TAS's report as 41PC784. The site is described as being located at the top and southern slope of a prominent
landform. The assemblage is described as consisting of 13 flaked-stone tools and cores (including an unidentifiable projectile point) and an unspecified number of flakes and pieces of fire-cracked rock (Turner and Turpin
2012:11-12). The site is listed in Texas Site Atlas records as ineligible for nomination to the NRHP or for listing

Lone Mountain examined the plotted location thoroughly and, while numerous chert nodules and spalls are
present, and the chert lithic material appears to be that found on other sites in the area, no artifacts were
observed on these slopes. Soils on the site belong to the Lozier-Rock outcrop association, steep. This soil association is found on hills and includes stony loams that are no more than 10 cm deep and exposed bedrock
(Rives 1980). The area identified as the site consists of a rocky ridgetop and slope with little topsoil, and no
shovel testing was conducted. It is possible that artifacts have washed downslope or are so mixed in with natural chert spalls that they were missed. It is also possible that these remains became buried in very shallow soils
somewhere on this landform. It is also possible that previous or current investigators have mistaken the nature
on the materials on the site as either artifacts or naturally occurring broken rocks. This site has been previously
recommended ineligible for nomination to the NRHP under any of the four criteria and for listing as an SAL.
Because the site was not encountered by this survey, no revised recommendations concerning NRHP or SAL eligibility are offered at this time. The proposed undertaking will have no effect on any NRHP- or SAL-eligible

During the current investigation, a 2-percent judgmental sample of lithic debitage and 100 percent of all other
observed artifacts were recorded. The recorded assemblage comprises 190 prehistoric lithic artifacts (all of
quartzite and chert) and approximately 250 historic artifacts, including 100 pieces of flaked-stone debitage (six
primary reduction flakes; 43 secondary reduction flakes; 45 tertiary reduction flakes and six pieces of angular
debris); one tested cobble; one bifacial core; three unidirectional cores; two bidirectional cores; 22 multidirectional cores; one utilized flake; six unifaces; 27 bifaces; 11 scrapers; four projectile points (Table 2.4); and one
piece of ornamental worked kaolinite. Projectile points resemble Baker, Hueco, a possible Livermore point, and
a Perdiz point, representing a date range between 6000 B.C. and A.D. 1700 (Turner et al. 2011:62, 116,198,

UT reported several hundred chert artifacts and projectile points that date from the Late Paleoindian to Late
Prehistoric periods, including Early Triangular, Gower, Pandale, Jora, Langtry, Ensor, Fairland, and Perdiz points
(Turpin 2009:34). Other prehistoric artifacts include a kaolinite bangle and scored rocks (Turpin 2009:33). Historic artifacts include a blue enamel cup, serving spoon bowl, solder tin cans, and a spur. These artifacts were
presumed to have come from the adjacent 41PC616, an adjacent historic road site (Turpin 2009:34), as
described below.

41PC79 (Figures 2.9 through 2.12) was first recorded by Gary Moore as a single ring midden in 1974 and was
subsequently expanded in 2009 by UT to become a dense lithic artifact and fire-cracked rock scatter with multiple thermal features and a few historic artifacts (Turpin 2009). The site is located along Tunis Creek, extending south to the foot of Big Mesa near the âOld Lower Roadâ site (41PC616), and extends out of University
lands to the west and outside of the project area to the east for several hundred meters. Lone Mountain documented that portion for the site falling on University lands within the project, finding a slightly smaller area
with visible archaeological remains covering 48.42 acres between the edge of the project area to the east and
private lands to the west. Vegetation includes mesquite, creosote, catclaw, cane cholla, Christmas tree cholla,
yucca, prickly pear cactus, and various forbs and grasses. Surface visibility is approximately 80 percent.

Feature 19 is a single-episode can dump consisting of approximately 150 artifacts, mostly hole-in-cap cans, a
few sanitary and exterior friction cans, and a small number of amethyst glass shards. This assemblage appears
to date to the early 20th century, likely no later than 1935, as described above.

Alluvial sediments are present up to 1 m in depth, as seen within the Tunis Creek bank. Buried cultural deposits
are apparent in Features 15 and 16 as visible carbon staining (trowel tested to a depth of 10 cm) and shovel
testing revealed buried charcoal at 12 cmbs outside of feature contexts. Testing at this site has suggested that
buried cultural deposits are likely present in the uppermost stratum

Fencelines, bladed roads, and two track roads traverse this site, which has also been disturbed by Historic

Six shovel tests were performed on this site outside of feature contexts, ending when bedrock or a sterile hardpan layer was encountered (Table 2.6), with the exception of Shovel Test 3, which ended upon encountering
charcoal flecking. NRCS maps show the site falling within the Reagan-Hodgins association, nearly level. This
association is found in alluvial flats, and may include not only Reagan and Hodgins soils but also Dalby, Iraan,
and Upton soils (Rives 1980). Soils encountered in shovel tests on 41PC79 resemble those described as
Hodgins but are very shallow. This soil is described as consisting of a gray to brown silty clay loam A horizon
that may be as thick as 70 cm overlying a thick B horizon (Rives 1980).

41PC79 has produced a variety of projectile points and a previously-collected radiocarbon date reflecting dates
from the Early Archaic though the Late Prehistoric period (6600 B.C. to A.D. 1700). A small historic component
at this site dates may date between A.D. 1898 and 1935. 41PC79 has been previously determined eligible for
nomination to the NRHP under Criterion D. The site is one of several extensive ring midden/resource processing sites located along Tunis Creek in Pecos County, Texas that reflect continuous use of the area for thousands
of years. Diagnostic tools, dating from the Late Paleoindian through the Late Prehistoric periods and charred
organic remains were observed during past (Turpin 2009) and present investigations. Thus, the site can be
associated with a temporal framework. While most of the shovel and trowel tests lacked cultural materials,
Shovel Test 3 and trowel tests conducted in Features 15 and 16 contained buried charcoal. In addition, artifact
concentrations and features remain sufficiently intact to argue for both horizontal and vertical integrity. The
assemblage on this site contains a sufficient number of artifacts (>30) from relevant materials (fire-cracked
rock {15,000+], lithic debitage [n=100+], cores [n=28+], and flaked-stone tools [n=27+] to be applied toward
a quantitative or statistical study. Lastly, site surveys conducted roughly a decade apart resulted in the recording of unique artifact assemblages. This likely indicates that alluvial and eolian processes are exposing some

TAS reported a prehistoric lithic scatter with no diagnostic artifacts (Turner and Turpin 2012). During the current investigation Lone Mountain recorded approximately 45 percent of observed lithic debitage and 100 percent of all other observed artifacts were recorded in Area A. The recorded assemblage comprises 780 lithic
artifacts (100 in the general scatter and 646 associated with features) including 646 pieces of flaked-stone
debitage (63 primary reduction flakes, 265 secondary reduction flakes, 227 tertiary reduction flakes, 33 thinning flakes, 22 pressure flakes and 36 pieces of angular debris); one tested cobble; one bidirectional core; two
multi-directional cores; 15 bifaces; one scraper; six utilized flakes; six projectile points (Table 2.7), and two onehand manos. Two of the projectile points resemble Palmillas points, 4000 to 1000 B.C.; three resemble Late
Archaic Hueco points; and one resembles a Baker point, 6000 to 4000 B.C. (Turner et al. 2011:62, 116, 145).

41PC442 (Figure 2.13) was originally recorded during a 1982 survey of the St. Genevieve Vineyard, but no site
record was filed at that time (Turpin 2009). The site was next documented in 2009 by UT (Turpin 2009) and in
2012 by TAS (Turner and Turpin 2012) as consisting of numerous hearths and lithic debitage extending at least
3,500 m along the north bank of Tunis Creek. The site is located on a mostly level flood plain, sloping approximately 1 degree to the south, bounded by a ridge to the north. Lone Mountain examined that portion of the
site falling within the project area. 41PC442 is estimated to extend at least another 0.25 miles to the southwest. Near the center of this site, there is a distinct break of more than 100 m in the visible surface material
across the toe of the rocky slope. The site may continue onto adjacent private land to the east. The site has
been divided into two distinct loci, Area A and Area B. These loci consist of clusters of visible artifacts and features within the site boundaries identified by UT (Turpin 2009).

Lone Mountain recorded approximately 15 percent of the observed debitage, 5 percent of the flaked stone

of 329 pieces of flaked-stone debitage (10 primary reduction flakes, 76 secondary reduction flakes, 222 tertiary reduction flakes, 12 thinning flakes and nine pieces of angular debris); two tested cobbles; five multidirectional cores (four exhausted); two utilized flakes; three unifaces; nine bifaces; one knife; one projectile point
fragment; and four indeterminate ground stone fragments. The projectile point fragment is made of tan chert
and measures 36 mm by 32 mm by 5 mm. The point fragment is the proximal end of a stemmed Archaicperiod point, likely Palmillas, which dates between 4000 and 1000 B.C. (Turner et al. 2011:145). All other lithic

bedrock, with some areas of slightly deeper sediments. Buried fire-cracked rocks are present at 20 cmbs, based
on a looter's pit apparent at least one feature. Although no clear indications of buried ash and charcoal were
found in any of the features, ring middens typically have a charcoal and ash stain buried within the center, or,
if deflated, charcoal and ash spread around the lower layers of fire-cracked rock. Shovel testing indicates that
sediments that might contain additional buried material are likely no more than 30 cm to 40 cm deep, where

Six shovel tests were conducted, ending when either bedrock or dense gravels were encountered (Table 2.11).
Gravel density increased with depth. No buried cultural deposits were found within these tests. NRCS maps
show this part of the site falling within the Reagan-Hodgins association, nearly level. This association is found
in alluvial flats, and may include not only Reagan and Hodgins soils but also Dalby, Iraan, and Upton soils (Rives

show that any buried archaeological remains on this site are likely to be surficial or within the uppermost
strata.

Several places in Area B appear to have been cleared with heavy equipment. Wind erosion, slopewash, sheetwash and arroyos are the primary causes of disturbance to this site. Looting (as evident by a pit excavated in
Feature 9), the construction of a two-track road, caliche road, pipelines, well pads, and fencelines have also
affected the integrity of the site along with rodent burrowing and livestock grazing. Area B remains an estimated 10 percent intact.
41PC442 has thus far produced temporally diagnostic artifacts indicating Early to Late Archaic (6000 B.C. to
A.D. 300) and Historic (A.D. 1898 to 1935) temporal and cultural affiliations. Given the quantity of artifacts
and features present, this resource-processing site likely represents a palimpsest of remains from a broader

County, Texas that reflect continuous use of the area for thousands of years. Diagnostic tools, dating from the
Early through Late Archaic periods and charred organic remains were observed the present investigation. Thus,
the site can be associated with a temporal framework. While all but three of the trowel tests lacked cultural
materials (93 percent), Trowel tests conducted in Features 25 through 27 of Area A contained buried charcoal.
In addition, rodent burrowing and a looter's pit in Features 8 and 9 in Area B contained buried fire-cracked
rock to depths of 10 cm + and 20 cm+, respectively. Shovel testing did not locate any buried cultural deposits
and indicates that buried cultural deposits are possible only in the upper 40 cm of the stratigraphy on this site.
Clusters of artifacts and features remain sufficiently intact to argue for both horizontal and vertical integrity.
The assemblage on this site contains a sufficient number of artifacts (>30) from relevant materials (fire-cracked

avoidance is not possible additional investigations are warranted to mitigate any adverse effects.

Vegetation in Area A (Figures 2.22 through 2.26) includes mesquite, creosote, cat claw acacia, cholla, prickly

UT reported hundreds of pieces of chert lithic debitage and several projectile points and flaked-stone tools:
possible Lerma, Martindale, Pandale, Langtry, Ensor, Frio, and a beveled end scraper, which date the site

south of Area A and accumulated over time. The hole-in-top cans have crimped seams indicating a date range
between A.D. 1898 and 1945 (Rock 1988), amethyst glass may predate 1935 (Lockhart 2006) and aqua glass
is common before 1920 and was used for jars into the early 1930s (https://sha.org/bottle/colors.htm#Aqua,

broader date range than the artifact concentrations on 41PC79 and 41PC442.

Six shovel tests in Area A were performed outside of feature contexts, ending when hardpan layer was
encountered (Table 2.14). NRCS maps show this part of the site falling within the Reagan-Hodgins association,
nearly level. This association is found in alluvial flats, and may include not only Reagan and Hodgins soils but
also Dalby, Iraan, and Upton soils (Rives 1980). Soils encountered in shovel tests in 41PC443, Area A resemble
those described as Hodgins This soil is described as consisting of a 60 cm deep silt loam A and B horizon (Rives
1980) All shovel tests contained the same strata. Although the shovel tests produced no buried cultural deposits, these tests do show that any buried archaeological remains on this site are likely to be surficial or within the

Feature 27 is a 4-m by 5-m dispersed scatter of tabular and rounded limestone boulders ranging in length
from 5 cm to 51 cm, with heights ranging from 5 to 20 cm and forming a rough rectangular shape. Some
boulders are partially burned. Associated artifacts include a hole-in-top can, one amethyst glass shard, and 11
white-glazed semiporcelain sherds. The rough shape of the âalignmentâ and the low quantity of historic artifacts suggests that this feature is a tent base associated with a temporary campsite and in no way the base of
a more formal structure. The hole-in-top cans have crimped seams suggesting a possible date range between
A.D. 1898 and 1945 (Rock 1988), while amethyst glass may date as late as the mid 1930s (Lockhart 2006).
Historic USGS maps show no structures or facilities in this location (http://historicalmaps.arcgis.com/usgs/,
accessed September 5, 2109). The artifact assemblage associated with this feature is potentially contemporary
with the early twentieth century use of the âOld Lower Roadâ (41PC616) to the south.

Eolian and alluvial sands are present from 10 to 30 cm thick, as seen within ephemeral drainage banks and
rodent burrows. A buried ash stain is present at a depth greater than 10 cm within Features 1 and 4. Shovel
testing failed to locate buried cultural deposits outside of features, but these results, coupled with results of
trowel tests in features, show that any such deposits would most likely be found in the upper 20 cm on the
site.

During the current investigation a 5 percent judgmental sample of lithic debitage and 100 percent of all other

41PC443 has temporally diagnostic artifacts and previously-collected radiocarbon dates indicating Paleoindian

investigations. Thus, the site can be associated with a temporal framework. Trowel tests encountered buried
ash and charcoal in 18 of 90 features (20 Percent) found in Areas A, B, and C and buried fire-cracked rock
alone in 13 of 90 features (14.4 percent). Twenty-four shovel tests were excavated in four areas of the site outside of feature contexts and did not locate any buried cultural deposits. These tests indicate that buried cultural deposits are possible only in the upper 20 cm to 40 cm of the stratigraphy on this site. Clusters of
artifacts and features remain sufficiently intact to argue for both horizontal and vertical integrity. The assemblage on this site contains a sufficient number of artifacts (>30) from relevant materials (fire-cracked rock
{19,000+], lithic debitage [n=15,000+], cores [n=50+], and flaked-stone tools [n=200+] to be applied toward a
quantitative or statistical study. Lastly, site surveys conducted roughly a decade apart resulted in the recording
of unique artifact assemblages. This likely indicates that alluvial and eolian processes are exposing some artifacts while burying others, which suggests that a much larger and varied artifact assemblage may exist. As a
result, 41PC443 meets the criteria required to be considered eligible for nomination to the NRHP under Criterion D. The site also qualifies as an SAL under Criteria 1,2,3,4, and 5. Areas A, B, C, and D should be avoided.
If avoidance is not possible additional investigations are warranted to mitigate any adverse effects.

they recorded on this site are part of a 1930s telephone line. According to lessee âStumpâ McKenzie, as interviewed and reported by Turpin (2009:44), these utility poles were part of a 1930s telephone line.

of the project area, between Tunis Creek and Big Mesa. Vegetation includes mesquite, cat claw, cholla, prickly
pear, and various forbs and grasses. Because vegetation has thrived in the remaining road ruts, surface visibility
on this site ranges between 26 percent and 50 percent.

Turpin reported a few artifacts along this road, including post A.D. 1905 can lid (Turpin 2009:45). Lone Mountain encountered no artifacts at this site. Historic artifacts likely dating to the early 20th century (cans, glass,

41PC615 has thus far produced evidence suggesting Early to Late Archaic (4000 to 1000 B.C.) and Historic
(A.D. 1930 to 1940) components. As with most of the ring midden/resource processing sites along Tunis
Creek, this site is likely a palimpsest of multiple occupations reflecting a broader date range. 41PC615 has
been previously determined eligible for nomination to the NRHP under Criterion D. Although Lone Mountain
did not encounter direct evidence (in the form of buried cultural deposits, charcoal and ash features, etc.) supporting this determination, the eastern extent of the site was not re-evaluated, and the site is one of a series of
similar sites along Tunis Creek that reflect much of the entire range of prehistory in Pecos County, and appear
threatened by increasing development. Clusters of artifacts and features remain sufficiently intact to argue for
both horizontal and vertical integrity. The assemblage on this site contains a sufficient number of artifacts
(>30) from relevant materials (fire-cracked rock {10,900+], lithic debitage [n=10,000+], cores [n=17+], and
flaked-stone tools [n=30+] to be applied toward a quantitative or statistical study. Lastly, site surveys conducted roughly a decade apart resulted in the recording of unique artifact assemblages. This likely indicates
that alluvial and eolian processes are exposing some artifacts while burying others, which suggests that a

Powerlines, utility lines, a two-track road, and a caliche capped road traverse the site. Wind erosion, water erosion, rodent burrowing, livestock grazing, and likely artifact collection from the nearby ranch have also
affected the site, which remains an estimated 30 percent intact.

The site consists of one feature, a historic stage/military road identified by Brune (1975) and Turpin (2009) as
the âOld Spanish Trail.â The road was identified at the Giddings Stage Station (41PC578; see also Garrison
2008) and passed through a stage stop at Escondido Springs. This portion of the trail followed the route of an
earlier Comanche trail, and later became the southern route between San Antonio and El Paso (Turpin
2009:45-46). The site form for 41PC578 describes this road as the âOld Lower Roadâ between these two cities. The âOld Lower Roadâ or âLower Emigrant Trailâ was used by â49ersâ on their way to California, accompanying a military survey expedition and is described in a journal of this trip kept by Robert Eccleston (1950)
and the route is also described in a report prepared by then Brevet Lieutenant Colonel J.E. Johnston of the
United States Army Corps of Topographical Engineers (Johnston 1850). The route became a military supply
and mail route over the next two decades and appears on the 1883 military map of the Rio Grande frontier
(Figure 2.43). It is uncertain when this route became a formal road following a single track as seen at 41PC616

41PC616 is crossed by several roads, fences, and pipelines, as well as plowed fields near the southwestern
edge of the of the project area. Wind erosion and sheetwash creating arroyos and gullies, cattle grazing, and
rodent burrowing also effect the site. 41PC616 remains an estimated 20 percent intact.
41PC616, âThe Old Lower Road,â likely follows a prehistoric and early historic Native American route, as well
as being a nineteenth century wagon road, likely dating between A.D. 1849 and 1920. At some point in the
early twentieth century, the road appears to have been replaced as the east-west route into Fort Stockton by
the Old Sheffield Highway, which had become the Old Spanish Trail by 1929. 41PC616 has been previously
determined eligible for nomination to the NRHP. The site is a historic route associated with the early development of Anglo-Euroamerican period travel across west Texas and is associated with earlier Native American
routes. The portion of site within the project area remains sufficiently intact and may contribute to our understanding of the 19th century route between San Antonio and El Paso. 41PC616 is recommended eligible for
nomination to the NRHP under Criterion A and eligible for listing as an SAL under Criteria 1,2,3,4, and 5.The
site may be avoided by using only already disturbed areas as crossing points pass through the site (see Figure
2.41).

The segment of the âOld Lower Roadâ that falls within the project area currently consists of a 20-cm to 50-cm
deep depression filled with dense brush between 10 m and 30 m in width.

The alignment 41PC616 follows is not that of an historic automobile highway identified as the âOld Spanish
Trailâ built between 1919 and 1931 that connected St. Augustine, Florida to San Diego, California (Kahl
2004). That road, identified on the 1929 USGS map was to the south of 41PC616, between Big Mesa and Little Mesa as in currently an in-use road. It is shown on the Sullivan map as the âOld Sheffield Roadâ. Sheffield,
Texas became an established settlement by A.D. 1900 (https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hls40,

(historic trails often resemble braided streams made up of parallel tracks, see Turpin 2009:45). It is also unclear
when this route fell out of use. Artifacts reported by Turpin (2009:45) and those described above at 41PC79
and 41PC443 appear to date to the early twentieth century, but this trail does not appear on the undated
(though likely early 20th century) Sullivan map of Pecos County (https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/
metapth88899/, accessed September 5, 2019) or on the 1929 Independence Draw, TX USGS map. Only the
most recent USGS map of the area shows this road (Figures 2.43 through 2.45).

Approximately 30 pieces of fire-cracked rock are scattered across the site.

Lone Mountain observed one rock alignment feature during this investigation. Feature 1 is a semi-circular rock
alignment measuring 3.3 m by 5 m. The feature is made up of tabular limestone up to 60 cm in length. The
feature has become somewhat dispersed and is estimated to be no more than 50 percent intact.
Soils in the area are identified as belonging to the Lozier-Rock outcrop association, steep. This soil association
is found on hills and consists of stoney loams that are no more than 10 cm deep and exposed bedrock (Rives
1980). The site lies on exposed limestone bedrock with minimal accumulations of eolian sands. No testing was
performed

Wind erosion, slopewash, sheetwash, rodent burrowing, and livestock grazing have left this site an estimated
25 percent intact.

41PC849 has an undated lithic artifact assemblage indicating an Unknown Aboriginal (10,500 B.C. to A.D.
1860) cultural and temporal affiliation. The site consists of undated lithic remains associated with an undated
rock alignment feature and is located on exposed bedrock with no potential for buried cultural deposits. There
are less than 30 artifacts (n=10) and the assemblage is unlikely to be useful for any quantitative or statistical
analyses. The site has horizontal integrity but no potential for vertical integrity. The site is, however, an element
of a larger archaeological landscape made up of larger sites along Tunis Creek (such as 42PC79, 42PC442,
42PC443, and 42PC615. As such, 41PC849 meets the criteria required to be considered eligible for nomination to the NRHP under Criterion D. The site also qualifies as an SAL under Criteria 1,2,3,4, and 5. Areas A, B,
C, and D should be avoided. If avoidance is not possible additional investigations are warranted to mitigate
any adverse effects.

Approximately 100 pieces of fire-cracked rock are scattered across the site.

No features were observed during this investigation. Six shovel tests were excavated, ending at bedrock (Table
2.25). NRCS maps show this area falling within the Reagan-Hodgins association, nearly level. This association is
found in alluvial flats, and may include not only Reagan and Hodgins soils but also Dalby, Iraan, and Upton
soils (Rives 1980). Sediments encountered on this site does not clearly resemble the deeper silt clay loams and
gravelly soils typically encountered in this soil association. This soil may have eroded out of this area and been
replaced by sandy eolian deposits. Although no tests produced any buried cultural deposits, these tests indicate that any buried archaeological remains on this site are likely to be surficial or very shallow.

All observed artifacts were recorded. The assemblage is comprised of 67 chert artifacts, including 55 pieces of
debitage (two primary reduction flakes, 10 secondary reduction flakes, 34 tertiary reduction flakes, three thinning flakes and six pieces of angular debris); one bidirectional core; four multidirectional cores (all exhausted);
two utilized flakes; one uniface; three bifaces; and one projectile point. This large stemmed point is damaged
along the base and one shoulder. The point is made of purple chert and measures 61 mm by 29 mm by 9 mm.
Although too incomplete to make a positive identification, the point may be a large example of one of the
Archaic expanding-stemmed types (e.g., Palmillas).

41PC851 consists of a dispersed scatter of chert flakes and tools and fire-cracked rock (Figures 2.48 and 2.49).
The site is located on a relatively flat flood plain that slopes 1 percent to the south toward Tunis Creek, with a
good view of the surrounding area. Vegetation includes mesquite, creosote, saltbush, Christmastree cholla,
crucifixion thorn, jumping cholla, and various forbs and grasses. Surface visibility is an estimated 55 percent.

Eolian sands are present up to 11 cm deep, as indicated by the shovel tests and rodent burrows. The site
appears to be exposed on a deflating surface with little potential for intact buried cultural deposits.

Wind erosion, and sheetwash are the primary causes of disturbance to this site, with rodent burrowing and
livestock grazing also present. This site is estimated to be 30 percent intact.

All observed artifacts were recorded. The assemblage is comprised of nine pieces of flaked-stone debitage
(four secondary reduction and five tertiary reduction flakes). Raw materials are chalcedony and chert. Approximately 25 pieces of fire-cracked rock are scattered across the site.

Lone Mountain observed one fire-cracked rock concentration feature (Figure 2.52). Feature 1 is a 3-m by 5-m
concentration of more than 200 fire-cracked rocks between 3 cm and 22 cm in size, with an average of 6 cm.
The feature is exposed in a two-track road and pipeline corridor and has begun to erode and become dispersed, leaving it no more than 40 percent intact. Trowel probes found no subsurface cultural materials.
Lone Mountain excavated six shovel tests (Table 2.26) outside of feature contexts, all ending at hardpan or
bedrock (from 25 cm to 38 cm). NRCS maps show this area falling within the Reagan-Hodgins association,
nearly level. This association is found in alluvial flats, and may include not only Reagan and Hodgins soils but
also Dalby, Iraan, and Upton soils (Rives 1980). This soil resembles an eroded Iraan silty clay loam, occasionally
flooded, with a grayish A horizon overlying a brown B horizon. This soil typically has a 70 cm thick A-horizon
and a 1.5 m deep B horizon with some gravels (Rives 1980). No buried cultural deposits were encountered.

The proposed undertaking was redesigned so that all smaller sites would be avoided. Those portions of larger
sites that contribute to SAL or NRHP eligibility would be avoided by rerouting the undertaking to existing disturbed areas or areas that appear to lack surface assemblages. All reroutes will ensure that seismic trucks avoid
surficial cultural materials by at least 30 m. 41PC616 (an historic road that passes through the entire project
area) would be avoided by routing vehicle traffic though crossing points (see Figure 2.41). These crossing
points consist of existing roads and disturbed areas that have been placed across 41PC616. The GIS shapefiles
for the sites and their reroutes will be given to the project proponent so that these locations can be programmed into GPS units carried in seismic vehicles. All project-generated documentation will be curated at
TARL. THC has recommended that all NRHP and SAL eligible sites be monitored. If buried cultural deposits or
other unexpected discoveries are encountered, work should cease immediately, and the THC notified.

C H AP T E R

Lone Mountain visited the locations of 15 previously recorded sites, finding no cultural remains at 10 of these
and re-recording the remaining five. Three newly encountered sites and nine isolated occurrences were also
recorded during this work (Table 2.27; see Tables 2.2 and 2.3). The isolated occurrences have been recorded in
their entirety and no further work is recommended.
