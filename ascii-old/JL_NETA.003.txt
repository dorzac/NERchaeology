AN UPDATE OF ARCHAEOWGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
AT THE TYSON SITE (41SY92)
by
Tom Middlebrook

INTRODUCTION
In recent years, much of the research concerning prehistoric and historic Caddoan

lifeways has focused on socio-political organization and community structure. Models
have been proposed to predict the character of the archaeological record based on
European observations of Caddoan life during the 17th-19th centuries. A brief review of
these models is warranted to provide the necessary background for interpreting the results
of recent archaeological work at an interesting 15th century site in Deep East Texas.
Story and Creel (1982) have developed an integrative model to describe Hasinai
Caddo "settlement patterns, socio-political organization, and intergroup interactions"
based on ethnographic and archaeological data. The smallest component within their
model was the layout of individual hamlets, with these being integrated into communities
(as exemplified by the Deshazo Site). A number of these individual settlements --along
with short-term use sites, community cemeteries, and a lesser political/ritual center (e.g.,
the residence of the caddi or village headman)-- reflected a "constituent group" in the
next level of group organization.
These constituent groups, perhaps located within a single drainage basin, were
thought to have the highest degree of social identification and interactions. Several
constituent groups along with a major center (e.g., residence of the spiritual leader, the

xinesi, and the temple) within a larger region composed an "affiliated group." This model
attempts to correlate the archaeological findings at small dispersed Caddoan farmsteads
and hamlets in East Texas with the ethnohistoric accounts of early Spanish missionaries
describing the village life and weak social hierarchy amongst Hasinai groups.

Journal of Northeast Texas Archaeology, No.3 (1994)

An example of a "constituent group" may be illustrated in Don Domingo Teran de
los Rios' 1691 map of an upper Nasoni village along the Red River. This graphic
representation of a Caddoan community has been associated with ethnohistoric data and
archaeological findings from the Hatchel-Mitchell-Moores site locality in Bowie County,
Texas (Wedel 1978; Perttula 1992; Cree11993). The map displayed the location of 23
dispersed hamlets and farmsteads containing one or two houses, ramadas, and aboveground beehive structures. On the western edge of the community was a temple atop a
mound. Two structures to the east may have represented the residence of the caddi.
Comparisons have been made between the Teran map and Cedar Grove (Schambach
1982; Trubowitz 1984) and Roitsch-Williams sites (Bruseth and Perttula 1991).
Wyckoff and Baugh (1980) carefully reviewed Spanish and French ethnographic
references to present a predictive model of material culture expected to be found
associated with Hasinai governing elites. Their research suggested, for example, that the
residence of a caddi would likely be located "near the center, of each inhabited
watershed" on "a partially isolated site of approximately 2 to 3 acres." This "residence
complex" would be composed of a large house for the caddi (perhaps 60 feet or 18
meters in diameter), a similar sized guest house for assembled canahas (subordinate
headmen or village elders), a smaller attendants' house, a plaza and ceremonial area,
arbors and middens, and a nearby cemetery. The caddi's house was predicted to be
circular in shape, have an eastern entryway and central hearth, have postholes in half of
the floor space (for interior furniture), and display evidence of burning. Pottery vessels
within the house were expected to have larger diameters than vessels used in typical
village contexts in order to contain stored nuts and grains for feasting and village
ceremonies. To date, no site in Deep East Texas has been conclusively demonstrated to
be the residence complex of a caddi, although Story and Creel (1982) speculated that
Area D of Deshazo may have been such a "lesser center" based on the presence of a
plaza. Along a similar line, Kleinschmidt (1982) re-evaluated A. T. Jackson's excavation

of the A. C. Saunders site in Anderson County and presented evidence consistent with
Wyckoff and Baugh's xinesi and caddi residence expectations.
While the hypotheses about settlement patterns and material culture described
above form the basis for my tentative interpretations of excavation findings at the Tyson
Site, practical limitations to applying these models in Deep East Texas must be kept in
mind. First, the archaeological database from controlled excavations is relatively limited
in the area between the Neches and Sabine River valleys. (The exceptions include
Washington Square Mound, Chayah, Mission Dolores, Mission San Jose, Deshazo,
Mayhew, and several McGee Bend or Lake Sam Rayburn sites.) Too few sites have been
thoroughly excavated to safely assert their degree of community relatedness. The second
limitation is the present shaky understanding of local Caddoan culture history. The
"Angelina Focus" (Jelks 1965) is often considered to be too "broadly defined" to be of
much use (Story 1990:Table 43; Perttula 1992:253). A number of sites within the area,
known primarily from surface collected artifacts and excavations at Toledo Bend
Reservoir, are said to have affiliations with Frankston, Titus (see Perttula 1993: Fig
2.6.2), and Bossier phases but the boundaries of these cultural units are unknown in the
southernmost Caddoan domain. The present uncertainty about culture history and cultural
taxonomy probably hints that there may be significant differences between groups of
Caddoan people in the past in regard to styles of community hierarchy and settlement
pattern. The third significant limitation to the models described here is in our
understanding of chronology. There is a paucity of absolute chronometric studies in East
Texas apart from the George C. Davis site (Story 1990). The application of ideas
developed from 17th-18th century historical accounts and sites may be misleading for
interpreting 15th century Caddoan communities.

OUTLINE OF TYSON SITE EXCAVATIONS
The Tyson site (41SY92) is a Caddoan habitation site located on a prominent hill
near the confluence of West Creek and Attoyac Bayou in western Shelby County, Texas.
The most striking initial impression of the Tyson site is its unusually elevated
topographic position. The hill is an erosional remnant of a high terrace rising 25 meters
above the eastern floodplain of the Attoyac. The site has a commanding view of the
surrounding terrain. Survey of the area has demonstrated the presence of at least five
other smaller Caddoan occupation areas (possibly farmsteads) primarily along the
margins of lower terraces below the site. While several springs seep from the sides of the
hill, the nearest flowing water is 400 meters southwest of the site. The soil at the Tyson
site is a moist brown sandy loam (with moderate amounts of limonitic gravel) 50 to 80
em thick overlying red and gray mottled clay of the Wilcox formation.
After the site was first identified in November 1991, test excavations were
conducted at the Tyson Site on January 25, 1992 by the East Texas Archeological Society
(ETAS) and on May 5 and 6, 1992 by students from the Episcopal School of Dallas
(under the supervision of Dr. S. Alan Skinner and members of the Dallas Archeological
Society). During the 1992 excavations, eighteen test units were opened across the site. A
total of 27 m2 was excavated in 15 em arbitrary levels; 8.5 m3 of soil were placed
through 1/4-inch screen mesh.
July 10 to 18, 1993, the East Texas Archeological Field School was sponsored by
ETAS, the Northeast Texas Archeological Society, and the United States Forest Service
(USFS), at the Tyson site under the direction of Bob D. Skiles (Archeologist with the
USFS). The focus of the 1993 work (Figure 1) was the excavation of a 6 x 6 m block
(Block 1) and a westward projecting contiguous 12 x 1 m trench (Trench 1). The goal
was to examine the area around a 1.3 m wide pit excavated in 1992. The earlier pit
(Feature 3) had contained a large amount of daub, bone, pottery, and chipped stone. It
was speculated that Feature 3 was situated inside or very near a burned Caddoan house.

The 1993 Field School plans were to look for evidence of a house and to describe
the aboriginal use of this portion of the site. Other research questions posed before
beginning the Field School involved matters of paleoenvironment, utilitarian craft
activities, subsistence, and cultural affiliation (Middlebrook 1993a). During this most
recent field work at Tyson, a total of 44 m2 was excavated in 10 em levels;
approximately 20m3 of soil were placed through an 1/8-inch water screen. An additional
1993 task was the examination of a backhoe trench through an anomalous clay feature
(Feature 1) partially excavated the year before (see Figure 1).
During excavations at the Tyson site, thirty-three soil disturbances were recorded
and examined (although four were not profiled). Of these, eight were found to be of "no
cultural significance." The remaining 25 features were designated as follows:

The Clay Feature
During an early excursion to the Tyson site, the author's ten year old son
discovered through the use of a soil probe a small area of dense red-orange clay
approximately 15 em below ground surface. Subsequent investigation of this "clay
feature" (Feature 1) revealed a 2.3 x 1.6 m subrectangular mass of relatively unmottled
clay (which contrasted with deeper "natural" clays) which is oriented roughly east-west in
its longest dimension. A profile through Feature 1 displayed a vertical and well defined
lateral margin to a depth of 80 em at the contact with the underlying clay B-horizon. No

distinct lower feature margin could be discerned. The feature was covered by a very dark
brown sandy loam (midden) plow zone. The upper surface of the clay was distinct but
very slightly undulating; no evidence of firing was noted. The clay was devoid of all
cultural artifacts but a few bits of organic material were noted in the upper few em of the
Feature 1. A possible small posthole with a vertically oriented sherd was found in the
southwest quadrant of the feature. Three additional postholes were noted just east,
southeast, and south of the clay contained within the normal sandy loam of the site.
Raymond Dolezel, a local soil scientist, examined a backhoe trench profile
through the clay feature. His conclusion was that Feature 1 could not be natural. He
found evidence of an excavated pit to a depth of approximately 80 em in which three
different deposits had been placed:
(1) The lower half of the clay was composed of material from the Wilcox
clays with inclusions of glauconitic shale from the Weches formation,
transported from some distance to the site. Mr. Dolezel commented that
this material would have been excellent for pottery making; (2) The upper
portion of the clay feature was composed of Wilcox materials but with the
addition of sodium salts. Natural saline wells are known from the Flat
Fork drainage in northern Shelby County. Striking columnar fracturing of
the upper 30 em of the clay was thought to be the result of significant
weight (or hand packing), or indicative that the clays were originally in
solution within the pit; (3) Along the outer margins of the Feature 1,
especially beside the basal portion, a fluvial sand was observed with soft
manganese-containing masses formed originally in extremely low pH
conditions. This soil was thought to be added to the pit from a stream
channel.
Three clay samples were taken from the feature but, as yet, have not been studied
by a soil geologist. Dr. Jack Keller, a consultant to the Field School, obtained 12

Journal of Northeast Texas Archaeology, No.3 (1994)

8

magnetic susceptibility samples from the clay feature which have been analyzed in Dr.
Michael Collin's lab at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL). No
culturally relevant discontinuities are evident in the column of samples, although it is
possible that magnetic susceptibilities may be higher throughout Feature 1 compared to
the surrounding soil profile. Additional comparative column samples will need to be
studied in the future to support or refute this speculation.
An archaeological interpretation of the clay feature is not obvious at this point. A

plausible explanation is that this clay-filled pit was involved in storage of material for
pottery making. Meager support for this notion was the discovery of a burnishing stone
adjacent to the feature. But one must wonder why potter's clay would need to be stored
in this fashion when clay appears to be readily abundant along the sides of the hill on
which the site is located. Was the pit used for some special treatment of the clay? Light
may be shed on this problem by comparing the clay mineralogy of the feature to the lump
of potter's clay found in Burial 2. An intriguing possibility is that the clay feature was
located within a house or other structure as suggested by the postholes nearby; additional
investigation of Feature 1 is clearly warranted.

Domestic Features in Block 1

Eighteen cultural features were noted during excavation of Block 1 and the
eastern two units of Trench 1 (Figure 2): While the clear outline of a house wall could
not be determined, there is considerable evidence supporting the association of these
features with a domicile.
A 1.15 x 0.9 m oval hearth (Feature 9) was exposed at 20 em depth when
excavating the southwestern portion of Block 1. The hearth was slightly basin-shaped
and approximately 15 em thick. The feature contained large amounts of ash from in situ
burning, nuggets of fired clay, a small amount of bone, and several burned sherds with
adherent ash. A discontinuous thin layer of bright orange clay near its bottom suggested

that the hearth had been prepared for use. Two large postholes were found in the area of
Feature 9: Feature 17 was discovered underneath the eastern end of the hearth; it was 30
em in diameter and had a smoothly rounded bottom at 75 em bs. Feature 12, just west of
the hearth, had similar proportions (diameter 27 em; depth 65 em bs).
Does Feature 9 represent the central hearth of a Caddoan house? No answer to
this question can be currently given because the outlines of a putative structure in the
Block 1 area have not been revealed to date. Early Spanish writers did note the presence
of a central frreplace in the caddi's residence, as well as a removable central post in the
construction of houses that then became the location of a frre (Wyckoff and Baugh 1980;
Newell and Krieger 1949). Fifteen references describing controlled excavations of 53
East Texas Caddoan sites were reviewed to sample information presently available
concerning the location of hearths within houses (Story 1972, 1981, 1982; Jelks 1965;
Woodall 1969; McClurkan et al. 1966; Anderson et al. 197 4; Bruseth and Perttula 1981;
Newell and Krieger 1949; Creel 1979; Kleinschmidt 1982; Jones 1968; Corbin et al.
1978, 1980; and Kenmotsu 1992). In these studies, 43 hearths (along with numerous ashfilled pits) were mentioned from 15 sites (Table 1).
All of the "central hearths" in this review were found at the George C. Davis site
under Mound A and Band in the village areas. Newell and Krieger (1949:24) noted:
Fireplaces were found in 14 of the 34 (house) outlines, always
approximately in the center.. . A large central posthole was present in
more than half the outlines, usually at about the center of the fireplace
when the latter was present. Some extended through the fireplace, but
others had definitely been cut off before the fireplace was made.
The fmdings at George C. Davis are consistent with observations at some other
Caddoan mound sites. For example, Webb (1959) excavated eight houses in two Bossier
and Belcher phase mounds at the Belcher site: seven of the eight houses had a central
hearth or ash bed; three were clay-lined and one had a central posthole beneath it.

Most of the remaining reports summarized in Table 1 did not demonstrate hearthhouse associations, due primarily to the small areal extent of excavations or other factors
that prohibited posthole detection. Where house patterns were defined, only three sites
were found to have had hearths away from the house. The Spoonbill site had a hearth
3.75 m southeast of the center of a circular house, while in the 1930s five hearths were
found in and around the possible "fire temple" at A.C. Saunders. At the Deshazo site,
three hearths were uncovered in the vicinity of overlapping structures in Unit 1. Hearth 2
was likely a small utilitarian fireplace about midway between the center post and the
exterior wall. Hearth 3 had a posthole underneath it, but it was not clearly associated with
any structure. Hearth 1, near several central posts, may not have been associated with any
of the three houses. Carolyn Good (1982) speculated that this feature may well have
represented the locale of an all-night bonfire in the "annual renewal" ceremonies
described by early Spanish writers.
In summary, archaeological evidence from East Texas Caddoan sites modestly,
but inconsistently, supports the inference that hearths tend to occur in the center of house
structures. Nevertheless, major gaps still exist in our understanding of fireplaces. Hearths
are not created equal; rather, they vary in size, shape, location, preparation, function,
duration of use, and contents. The information in Table 1 regarding Caddoan hearths and
houses, due to its skewed nature, has clear limitations when applied to the Tyson site.
Nevertheless, a working hypothesis that Feature 9 is a central hearth is appealing because
of its large size, its association with large postholes, and its proximity to other likely
interior house features. Careful analysis of the faunal, paleobotanical, and ceramic
contents of the hearths may reveal more clues about the function of Feature 9.
Located two meters northeast of Feature 9 was Feature 3, a 1.3 m round basinshaped pit 70 em in greatest depth (see Figure 2). During early phases of excavation, the
large amount of daub in the matrix was impressive; a total of 5,966 g of daub was
collected from the pit. Some of the daub showed evidence of smoothing and possible

Journal of Northeast Texas Archaeology, No.3 (1994)

14

fmger impressions (see Webb 1959:59-60). A number of fragments of daub also had leaf
impressions (oak, willow, black tupelo, and maple). Additional contents of Feature 3
included bone, charcoal, shell, lithic debitage, eight whole or broken arrowpoints, and
644 ceramic sherds. A large amount of ash and charcoal was noted in the lowest levels of
the pit and red and orange burned clay was exposed along the bottom concave surface.
Faunal material from Feature 3 was in excellent condition. This material was
analyzed by Brian Shaffer at the University of North Texas. Seventeen hundred and three
specimens were recovered, and less than one percent exhibited marked weathering.
Burning was noted on 59 percent of the faunal specimens, a relatively high proportion.
Based on the lack of extremely small spirally fractured bone and the presence of larger
spirally fractured specimens, bone recovered from the Tyson Site appears to have been
processed for marrow, but not for grease. Large spirally fractured sections and the
presence of dynamic loading impact points on five specimens indicates that the bone was
not extensively processed, but simply opened for marrow removal. Eight specimens were
identified with cut marks. Five of the specimens had cut marks located in joint areas, as
the cuts served to disarticulate the joints. One complete deer ulna bone awl was
recovered from Feature 3. Faunal taxa recovered included bowfish, catfish, perch, mud
turtle, Eastern box turtle, duck, turkey, passenger pigeon (now extinct), jay, cottontail
rabbit, swamp rabbit, squirrel, skunk, raccoon, deer, and bison.
Three radiocarbon samples were obtained from Feature 3 (Middlebrook 1993b);
two samples were composed of woody charcoal and the third was a well preserved
mussel shell. All samples were submitted to the University of Texas Radiocarbon
Laboratory. Routine dates, delta 13c corrections, and dendrochronological calibrations
were generated for each sample, and the dendrocalibrated ages are the most accurate. The
dates demonstrate remarkable agreement despite the fact that two different carbon
sources were utilized; the calibrated charcoal ages were A.D 1418 (TX-7612) and A.D.
1435 (TX-7626) while the calibrated shell age was A.D. 1422 (TX-7625). Some

caution in interpreting dates for the feature should be used since the contents from which
the samples were taken appear to be midden fill and do not represent the products of in

situ burning in the pit.
Two additional pits were noted in the area of the hearth. Feature 4 was an
irregularly shaped pit, 2.5 m southeast of Feature 9, first observed at 40 em bs, with
associated large sherds, mussel shell, and deer sacrum and antler. This pit was roughly
basin-shaped but its bottom was uneven (at 65 em bs). Careful excavation revealed that
its fill predated the placement of Feature 14 (Burial 1). Feature 6 was located 3 m
southwest of the hearth. The round feature was clearly basin-shaped and extended to 52
em bs. The matrix was similar to that of Feature 4, but was more homogeneous than the
relatively mottled fill of the burials. Charcoal, lithics, pottery, and bone were scattered
through most levels of the pit. In contrast to Feature 3, there was no evidence of burned
clay or ash in either pit; daub concentrations were also relatively low.
These three pits appear to serve essentially two different functions: cooking and
storage. Feature 3 may initially have been used for the containment of a cooking frre.
While such pits may also have been utilized in outdoor cooking areas, placing a frre in a
pit inside a house would have protected flammable indoor structures and materials.
Feature 3 closely matches Dickens' (1985) description of the "Type 5 feature- cooking
pit" in his classification of Southeastern garbage-filled pits. Intentional filling of the pit
with household refuse is more clearly evidenced in the case of Feature 3 than the other
two pits because of the more numerous large sherds and bones. The last stage of Feature
3 filling apparently occurred after the burning of a house due to the significant
accumulation of daub in the upper and mid-levels of the fill. The original use of Feature
4 and Feature 6 is more problematic. Their contents are very similar to the overlying
midden soil with the exception of lower amounts of daub. These pits may have been
filled prior to house burning. Dickens (1985) referred to such pits as "Type 1 features"
and suggested that they may have served to temporarily store hard seeds and nuts. Soil

samples collected for flotation and subsequent paleobotanical analysis may ultimately
resolve the function of these features.
Twelve postholes were found in the Block 1 area (see Figure 2). No structural
pattern was discerned after posthole mapping, but all of these features were located in the
western two thirds of the block. One posthole (Feature 7) showed evidence of burning in
place. This post also displayed a sharply tapered end, leading to the speculation that it
may have been "driven into the ground" after an initial hole had been dug for its
placement.
Feature 14 (Buriall) was a large pit containing the remains of a 3 to 4 year old
child along with eight ceramic vessels, two large and carefully placed complete paired
deer antlers, the femur and tibia of a deer, four round carved shell inlays (possible eye
representations), four other shell inlays, two carved bone "ear spools," 32 olivella shell
beads, three columnella beads (with rounded ends), two broken shell beads, a large
marine pelecypod, a turtle carapace (rattle?), a cache of six mussel shells and three
smoothed stones, two pitted stones, a cache of six deer ulna awls and two beaver teeth,
and a cache of lithic pebble cores, flakes, preforms, and "shell points."
Deer antler and antler representations are known to have ceremonial significance
in important Early Caddoan centers such as Crenshaw (Schambach 1991) and Spiro. The
antlers (perhaps a part of a head dress) in Feature 14 were placed inverted over a large
engraved carinated bowl which in tum rested on the child's cranium. The shell inlays
were primarily distributed near the head of the grave and are similar to the ones recovered
from mound centers (e.g., Belcher Mound, Burials 10, 15, 25, 26; Webb 1959) and nonmound sites (e.g., Cedar Grove; Kay 1984; and Sawmill; Jelks 1965). The columnella
beads were recovered above the chest area and apparently formed a necklace. These
beads are widely distributed in the Caddoan Area and have been recovered from
Washington Square Mound (Hart 1982), and with infants from the Walter Bell (Jelks
1965) and McLelland sites (Kelley 1993). The numerous olivella beads were scattered

Journal of Northeast Texas Archaeology, No. 3 (1994)

17

over the grave, especially in the region of the legs, suggesting they may have been
attached to an article of clothing. While the residents of the Tyson site exploited local
mussel shell, they had access to more valuable varieties of marine shell obtained through
trade. The two carved bone "ear spool"-shaped objects were clearly not worn as ear
spools as they were found close to each other but 25 to 35 em south of the right side of
the cranium. The presence of a flint knapper's kit (awls, beaver teeth, and lithics)
suggests the juvenile was male. Given the arrangement of preserved artifacts in the very
large pit, it is very likely that a significant quantity of perishable items was also buried
with this child.
Feature 15 (Burial 2) contained the skeleton of a very young, possibly female,
infant associated with two brushed/incised ceramic vessels, two columnella beads (with
squared ends), a mussel shell, and a large lump of potter's clay. The skeletal material is
currently being analyzed at the Bioarcheology Laboratory at Texas A&M University.

Houses in Block 1

Was there a house in the Block 1 area? The answer is almost certainly "yes."
However, the evidence that would best confirm this, an arc of outside wall postholes, has
not been revealed thus far. If the hearth was near the center of a house, and the radius of
the structure was greater than 5.5 m, then Block 1 would be almost entirely inside the
house.

In that case, a house wall was not found in the current investigations.

Interestingly, Feature 22 is a posthole found in Trench 1 six meters from Feature 17, the
large posthole underneath the hearth. While further excavations would be needed to
determine if Feature 22 is part of a 12m diameter round structure, evidence for a house in
the Block 1 area is summarized here:
1. The concentration of four large features (Features 3, 4, 6, 9) representing
domestic cooking and storage facilities is unlikely to be found in an outdoor area.
2. Juvenile burials have been known to be placed in Caddoan housefloors.

Journal of Northeast Texas Archaeology, No.3 (1994)

18

3. The relatively high frequency of postholes without clear pattern within Block 1
is reminiscent of the interior of houses and may represent partitions, support posts, or bed
frames.
4. Based on partial analysis, the relative frequency of ceramic artifact categories
appears to be different within and outside the hypothesized house. The most striking
difference is in the distribution of brushed sherds. Brushing is the most common
decorative ceramic treatment at Tyson. "Brushed" accounted for 7.3 percent of analyzed
sherds inside the probable house area (all Figure 2 units except for "Feature 3"), 20.4
percent of Feature 3 sherds (from the feature and the 2 x 2m unit over Feature 3), and
19.8 percent of sherds from outside the suspected house (all other Tyson site units). Two
findings are striking here. First, brushed sherds are conspicuously less frequent inside the
"house" than out. If brushed vessels represented common utilitarian jars, other ceramic
vessel types may have been utilized for storage, serving, or cooking inside the house or
different activities involving pottery were undertaken inside a house when compared to
other parts of the site. Second, the fill of Feature 3 contained a higher proportion of
brushed sherds than the rest of Block 1, and was roughly equivalent in frequency to the
site as a whole. This fmding may be expected if Feature 3 was intentionally filled with
garbage following the burning of the house.
A few speculations concerning the sequence of Block 1 cultural features can be
made as they relate to house construction, usage, and destruction. One should keep in
mind, however, that more than one superimposed house pattern may ultimately be
demonstrated in the Block 1 area (e.g., as at Deshazo [Good 1982] and other Caddoan
sites). The hypothesized sequence is:
1. The earliest event in this area may have been the construction of a large, round

house with central post.

Journal of Northeast Texas Archaeology, No. 3 (1994)

19

2. The post may have been removed and a central hearth constructed and used in
the same area. Careful excavation of Feature 9 gave no evidence that the underlying post
(Feature 17) was ever present during hearth use.
3. Pits (Feature 4 and Feature 6) were then dug into the house floor, only to later
fall into disuse and be filled by general midden soil.
4. Burial1 (Feature 14) was then placed in the floor of the house, crossing the old
outline of Feature 4. Interestingly, the Tyson infant burials do not appear to be next to
the house wall (as they were at Deshazo) but instead have prominent locations near the
presumed center of the house.

5. The house burned. This may have been intentional and related to ceremonial
activity following the death of important occupants. The house burning postdated the
filling of features 4, 6, 14, and 15 as indicated by the low density of daub in the features
(no more than might be expected by post-occupational bioturbation). Daub was most
concentrated in an area within 2-3 meters of the possible central hearth. A similar finding
was noted by Webb ( 1959) in some of the Belcher site houses.
6. Feature 3, probably a cooking pit, was then filled by debris of the burned house
and surrounding midden.

ARTIFACTS
The present paper will not give a detailed description of the Tyson site artifacts
since their analysis is ongoing. However, a brief discussion of the 222 excavation lots
inventoried to date (out of 298lots) will provide some initial data on them.
Ceramics were divided into two classes: (1) sherds larger than 1.5 em in longest
dimension, and (2) sherds smaller than 1.5 em or highly eroded; these were counted
(n=1770) but not subjected to further analysis. A summary of surface treatment of the
larger sherds is presented below:

We can make the following observations on the Tyson ceramics:

1. The majority were plain body sherds. While many may be fragments of plain
utilitarian jars, a substantial percentage of these sherds were likely from lower sections of
decorated bowls and jars. A cursory review of plain rim sherds indicated that many of
the represented vessels were plain carinated bowls 18 to 25 em in diameter. The rims
were commonly straight and direct (to slightly thinned) with flat to slightly rounded lips.
2. Brushing was the most common decoration of Tyson vessels. Rims were
commonly horizontally brushed with body sherds displaying vertical to diagonal brush
marks. This pattern was similar to Jelks' (1965) description of Broaddus Brushed vessels.
The brushed designs graded into parallel incised designs and were apparently made by
frayed ends of sticks or combs. A substantial lower portion of a coarsely brushed large
utilitarian jar was reconstructed from sherds in Feature 3. Several sherds also display
alternating panels of diagonal brushing reminiscent of the herringbone pattern of Pease
Brushed-Incised but without the typical intervening applique or row of punctations. Some

of the Block 1 sherds initially grouped as brushed are from Belcher Ridged vessels.

Journal of Northeast Texas Archaeology, No.3 (1994)

3. At Tyson, punctations were produced using the broken or cut end of small
sticks and reeds or by fingernails. They were often crudely made and haphazardly
arranged within zones on the vessel rim or in large fields on the lower body of vessels.
On punctated-incised sherds, the punctations were variously placed within rectilinear,
triangular, or curvilinear zones. These Tyson sherds are similar to Pineland Punctated-

Incised designs (Jelks 1965) although this type is far too encompassing to be of much
local value. One interesting group of sherds was from a large jar with a "triangular" zoned
punctated-incised rim with a body displaying a Sinner Linear Punctated design. A
number of incised sherds exhibit the kind of large crosshatching often seen in Maydelle

Incised.
4. Engraved ceramics represented about 7 percent of the sample and were slightly
more common "inside the house." Ten sherds were from at least two barrel-shaped
bottles with a Maddox Engraved design. Five sherds were from Poyner Engraved vessels;
scroll motifs were not uncommon.
5. Pipe bowl and stem fragments were remarkably common at the Tyson site.
Indeed, the number of pipe sherds (n=34) already inventoried exceeds the total number of
long-stem pipe fragments (n=31) from all the McGee Bend sites reported by Jelks (1965).
Pipe elements approached 1 percent of all analyzed sherds in Block 1 (excluding Feature
3). All pipe fragments appear to resemble the Haley Variety of the Red River pipe
(Hoffman 1967).
Six of the ten mortuary vessels from Burial 1 and 2 were identified with
previously described types. Interestingly, although some were small in size, none of the
whole ceramics were clearly "miniatures" or displayed evidence for immature
craftsmanship as sometimes seen in vessels accompanying juvenile burials. A partial
description of each vessel follows:

elements to each other or to a basal line; there are nine repetitions of the design and lower

The two carinated bowls in Burial1 (B1-V5 and B1-V8) have a distinctive motif
fust noted at Tyson during the 1992 excavations of Feature 3 when several sherds of two
other similar vessels were found. This design has also been identified on bottles from the
Hughes site 12 miles east of Tyson and from 41SY45 in northern Shelby county. For
convenience, the author is tentatively referring to this engraved motif as "Tyson
Engraved." They are carinated bowls, bowls, and bottles from the Shelby County area
that have engraved column/semicircles, negative S-shaped scrolls, and attached lines (see
Figure 3).
There are several vessels from Deep East Texas which have interesting
comparisons to "Tyson Engraved." The reassembled body of a four-cornered bottle
covered with "fat" negative S-shaped scrolls from the Blount site is in the T ARL
collection. Two carinated bowls from 41SY45 have stylized representations of the
"column/semicircle" motif without the other components of "Tyson Engraved." Because
41SY45 probably dates later than Tyson, one might wonder whether this represents local
stylistic change in the design.
Lithic analysis is far from complete. A resharpened Dalton point and a Gary-like
point were found in controlled excavation but may be unrelated to the Caddo occupation.
While approximately 25 arrowpoints, preforms, and other chipped stone tools have been
recovered, most are broken and some are remarkably crude. The most frequent
arrowpoint types are Perdiz, Bassett, and straight stemmed forms. Lithic debitage is

Journal of Northeast Texas Archaeology, No. 3 (1994)

25

composed primarily of small chips from pressure flaking; 85 percent of the raw material
is small "creek chert" pebbles, petrified wood fragments, and ferruginous sandstone or
hematite. A small amount of lithic material is Edwards chert and other exotic cherts.
Approximately 10 pitted stones have been recovered; the only celt from the site was
collected from the surface in the 1930s.
Two other artifact groups are noteworthy. One deer bone fragment was recovered
with an engraved arrow sign on it Two very small, clear, blue glass beads with ground
ends were also found. These beads are possibly related to a brief Historic Caddo or
immigrant Indian group occupation of the Tyson site.

CULTURAL AFFll...IATION

The straightforward association of the Tyson site material culture to a well
described or established cultural group is not currently possible. At the outset, there are
at least two problems with determining the cultural affiliation of the Tyson site. First, as
alluded to previously, there is not an adequate framework for Deep East Texas Caddoan
culture history or chronology. A new synthesis of existing data is needed to integrate
previous McGee Bend, Washington Square, and Toledo Bend research with a number of
other sites known from avocational and cultural resource management work in the region.
Developments at the Washington Square mound site from A.D. 1250 to 1350, in
particular, may have great significance with respect to defining local cultural traditions.
What is presently known from the middle Angelina River drainage suggests, broadly
speaking, that a ceramic tradition is present during Middle and Late Caddo periods that is
distinct from one seen in Frankston and Allen phases west and north of Bayou Loco
(Jelks 1965:270). Pottery decoration in the area emphasizes brushing and punctatedincised designs; often these designs are carelessly made. A few distinctive local designs
(Hart 1982), as well as interesting amalgamations and variations on recognizable ceramic
types from other areas, are seen in Deep East Texas. Reviewing a number of artifact

Journal of Northeast Texas Archaeology, No.3 (1994)

26

assemblages from the Angelina and Attoyac basins gives the impression that the material
culture is complex and bears evidence of broad influences from other areas. Groups of
Caddoan peoples may have been culturally diverse, dynamic, and highly interactive.
Nevertheless, subdivisions of cultural groups (perhaps reflective of "affiliated groups")
may one day be recognizable in individual drainages with more detailed ceramic stylistic
analyses.
A second problem in determining the cultural affiliation of Tyson pertains to
"diagnostic artifacts." Projectile points are particularly disappointing in aiding group
identification due to their scarcity and the notable crudeness of manufacture.
Furthermore, recognizable ceramic associations have no clear or predominant pattern in
the Tyson assemblage: a Ripley Engraved bottle and two Karnack Brushed-Incised
globular bowls are characteristic of the Titus phase; Poyner Engraved sherds are most
frequently seen in Frankston phase; Maydelle Incised has been associated with both the
Titus and Frankston phases; Sinner Linear Punctated, Maddox Engraved, Belcher

Ridged, and Pease Brushed-Incised -like sherds reflect Bossier, Whelan, and perhaps
early Belcher phase associations. Finally, the high status artifacts from Burial 1 are not
necessarily culturally distinctive, although comparisons with the Belcher site are
interesting.
The most obvious Tyson site comparisons must be made with the 13 "Angelina
Focus" sites at the McGee Bend Reservoir (Lake Sam Rayburn). While there is a clear
overlap in Angelina focus "traits" (see Jelks 1965: 214-215) with the Tyson site material
culture, limitations in these comparisons include the multicomponent status and limited
excavations of many of the McGee Bend sites. The most significant problem, however,
in associating the Tyson site with the Angelina focus is the broad defmition given to this
cultural unit. Jelks (1965:269) appeared to understand this difficulty:

27

Journal of Northeast Texas Archaeology, No.3 (1994)
An obvious hypothesis--and one that should be tested by additional
fieldwork--is that the Angelina Focus spans the time period encompassed
by the entire Caddoan sequence. If so, future research may result in
fragmenting the Angelina Focus, as it is defined here, into several smaller
units.

Is it possible to segregate the Angelina focus into useful (and perhaps more
temporally narrow) subdivisions? An initial attempt summarized here yields interesting
results. This study began by carefully reviewing data presented in Jelks (1965). Cultural
features, projectile point types, and previously defined "diagnostic" ceramic types did not
clearly discriminate between different groupings of Angelina Focus sites. Three factors,
however, did seem to co-vary: pipe type, percentage of brushed sherds, and the ratio of
punctated-incised to brushed sherds (Figure 4).
In order to avoid possible biases due to small sample size, only sites with at least
2500 analyzed sherds were selected for this comparison. In addition to four McGee Bend
sites which met this qualification, the Jack Walton site was included because of its
proximity to the other sites (Middlebrook 1984). An initial grouping of sites was based
upon the long-stemmed versus elbow pipe frequency. This was done as pipe form has
been demonstrated by Hoffman (1967) along the Red River to have chronological
significance (e.g., elbow pipes replaced earlier long-stemmed pipes).

Based on

predominant pipe form, the Sawmill and Blount sites were termed "early sites" while
Walter Bell, Etoile, and Jack Walton were "late sites." Then these groups were compared
along the lines of Jelks' (1965) two newly defmed ceramic decorative types; he counted
all brushed sherds under the category of Broaddus Brushed and all punctated-incised
sherds as Pineland Punctated-Incised without further distinction. To provide more
sensitive indicators of relative frequency of these two surface treatments, they are
expressed as percentage ratios of: "Pineland/Broaddus".

This comparison between "early" and " late" Angelina Focus sites suggests
consistent differences between groups in terms of major ceramic decorative techniques.
Specifically, brushed sherds are less common and punctated-incised sherds are relatively
more common in the "early" sites. While the findings from Tyson along these same
parameters are intermediate between the two groups, the trends clearly favor its
association with the so-called "early" sites (see Figure 4).
The most readily apparent criticism of this simple division of the Angelina Focus
sites into "early" and "late" groupings is with the very small number of sites involved.
Additionally, the temporal referent for the groups is somewhat presumptuous since a
detailed seriation has not been undertaken and the only absolute chronometric dates are
from Tyson; furthermore, the significance of geographical variation has not been taken
into consideration. Keeping these major problems in mind, Angelina Focus subdivisions
proposed here should provide testable hypotheses for future research in the area:

Early Angelina Sites:
• Predominance of long-stemmed pipes
• 10-15 percent of sherds display brushing
• Brushed sherds are 3 to 4 times more common than
punctated-incised sherds
• Examples: Blount, Sawmill, Tyson

Late Angelina Sites:
• Predominance of elbow pipes
• 20-25 percentof sherds display brushing
• Brushed sherds are 6 to 20 times more common than
punctated-incised sherds
• Examples: Walter Bell, Etoile, Jack Walton

Journal of Northeast Texas Archaeology, No. 3 (1994)

DISCUSSION
The interpretation of Tyson site findings is tentative and somewhat speculative at
this point. The most conservative observation is that Tyson is an early 15th century
Caddoan habitation site. But what were the aboriginal peoples doing here? How did this
occupation fit into an overall settlement pattern? Were there any special functions of
social, political, or religious life undertaken here?
A few of Wyckoff and Baugh's (1980) predictions concerning the "caddi
residence complex" are met at Tyson. Their general descriptions of size and location are
congruent with the fact that the site is roughly 2 to 3 acres in size and is located near the
center of an occupied river basin. Tyson is also adjacent to the confluence of Attoyac
Bayou and a major tributary. Access to the site would have been easy from several
different directions. Depending on what the forest vegetation would have been, any
caddi at Tyson would likely have been able to see a number of different farmsteads and

settlements from the dominating vantage point atop a hill; Tyson is atypical for Deep East
Texas Caddoan sites because it is not located on a low rise or terrace just above a
floodplain.
Currently, not enough of the site has been explored to ascertain whether a plaza,
visitor's house, attendants' house, or cemetery are present as expected at a caddi
residence. However, if Block 1 is located inside a large house, then support for a central
hearth and "numerous small, interior postmolds on one side of the structure" will have
been demonstrated.
While no other predictions made by Wyckoff and Baugh (1980) have been
confirmed at Tyson, several additional findings suggest that it is a ceremonial or other
special function site:
1. Mortuary associated artifacts in juvenile Burial 1 are numerous, elaborate, and

apparently of high status. Some of the artifacts are valuable jewelry or clothing that
would have been traded from the coast (e.g., columnella and olivella beads). Other

Journal of Northeast Texas Archaeology, No.3 (1994)

31

materials suggest that the very young child was in need of extensive (e.g., eight pottery
vessels) and non-age appropriate provisions in the afterlife (e.g., a large lithic tool making
kit). There may have been ceremonial or religious reasons for the inclusion of knapping
equipment in this burial; it is difficult to argue that a three to four year old would have
been a proficient flintknapper. Some of the artifacts appear to have had purely symbolic
meaning (e.g., deer antlers, rattle, earspool-like artifacts, and shell inlays). The only
reasonable interpretation of Burial 1 is that the individual was an offspring of a very
important person or was a high ranking person is his own right (e.g., a caddi, "heavenly
child", etc.).
2. Large amounts of daub and a charred post indicate that a burned house was
located in the area of Block 1. While houses may have burned accidentally in any
Caddoan community, intentional burning of the residence of religious figures following
their death was apparently widespread in the Caddoan Area. In this context, it may be
important to note that the house burning post-dated the interment of the children in
Burials 1 and 2; the actual amount of time between the two events is unknown, however.
3. The aboriginal clay feature (Feature 1) is unusual for known Caddoan sites,
and its origin and function remains puzzling. Until this feature is better understood, its
presence at Tyson only buttresses the conclusion that the site is not a typical farmstead or
hamlet.
4. The presence of the distinctive ceramic engraved motif at the site, herein
tentatively referred to as "Tyson Engraved," suggests that this design may have had
special meaning for the site's occupants. There is little question that whomever lived at
Tyson had some preference for the motif; it was one of the most common engraved types
in the Block 1 area and two bowls bearing the design were placed near the head of the
Burial 1 child. The position of Vessel 5 between the cranium and two antlers was
certainly not by chance. The hypothesis that this engraved style was a marker for Tyson
ceremonial beliefs might be profitably tested in the future.

5. Pipes are commonly found in Caddoan village sites (Hoffman 1967). The
striking finding from the Tyson site is that 34 pipe fragments have already been recovered
from the site. This is far out of proportion to the number of pipes found at other Deep
East Texas sites. While the possibility exists that the residents of Tyson simply enjoyed
the everyday smoking of tobacco, the high frequency of pipe fragments also suggests
that the use of pipes denotes ceremonial or "high status" activities. Wyckoff and Baugh
(1980:Tables 2 and 4) list a number of European chroniclers' references to pipes and
tobacco among the Caddo governing elite:
(a) Joutel1687; Cahinnio elders held calumet ceremony with French;
(b) Casanas 1690-91; caddi had tobacco pouch and pipe; canahas prepared peace
pipe for the caddi;
(c) Espinosa 1715; Spanish smoked feathered peace pipe with Assinais captains;
(d) Espinosa 1716; tamma delivered first ripe tobacco to Captain;
(e) Espinosa 1715-17; xinesi maintained fire temple in which he had tobacco and
peace pipe;
(f) Espinosa 1715-17; priests, captains, and old men smoked pipes in harvest

ceremony at captain's house;
(g) La Harpe 1719; Nadaco and Naouydiche chiefs smoked calumet with French;
and
(h) Aguayo 1721; Neches chief smoked peace pipe with Spanish.

Summarizing the above, a tentative interpretation of the Tyson excavations is that
the site is the residence location of an important local Caddoan political or religious
figure during the early 15th century with cultural ties to peoples occupying early
"Angelina Focus" sites. Much of the theoretical basis for this interpretation is generated
from ethnohistorical and archaeological data derived from Caddoan life 150 to 200 years
after Tyson was occupied. Dangers abound in attempting fanciful imposition of models

Journal of Northeast Texas Archaeology, No. 3 (1994)

of later settlement patterns and social organization onto meager information from a single
site in an relatively unknown drainage. The goal of this update, however, is to encourage
ongoing thinking and discussion about Deep East Texas archaeological :fmdings and how
they fit into the wider Caddoan cultural framework.

HUMAN SKELETAL REMAINS FROM THE
TYSON SITE (41SY92)
by
Helen Danzeiser Dockall

INTRODUCTION
During the 1993 field season at the Tyson site (41SY92), conducted by the East
Texas and Northeast Texas Archaeological societies, two burial features were uncovered
(Features 14 and 15). These features contained the skeletal remains of three Caddo
subadults, ranging in age from birth to one to two years. Burial1 (Feature 14) yielded the
partial skeleton of a child less than two years old, as well as elements of a second, slightly
younger, child. Burial 2 (Feature 15) produced the remains of a well-preserved infant.
This article describes the excavation and osteology protocols, a description of
taphonomic conditions, inventory of these burials, demography, size of the subadults,
their state of health, and cranial modification.

EXCAVATION PROTOCOL
When the burials were located in the field, the skeletal remains were cleared
enough to determine their extent; these elements were mapped, as were associated grave
goods. At that time, the grave goods were removed for cataloging and processing and the
decision was made to remove the burials in matrix. Two blocks of soil, one for each
feature, were removed from the ground. In order to stabilize the burials, a spray foam
sealant was applied. The burials were then transported to the Physical Anthropology
Laboratory of Texas A&M University for excavation and analysis.
Excavation procedure consisted of carefully removing the sealant covering the
burials and then excavating the skeletal remains from the matrix. The burials were
excavated using bamboo tools, small wooden dowels, and paint brushes. During the

Journal of Northeast Texas Archaeology, No.3 (1994)

38

excavation, black and white photographs were taken using Plus X Pan film, and color
slides were taken using Kodachrome. Once the remains were exposed, maps were drawn
showing the relationship of skeletal elements to each other and to associated grave goods
(see below). All soil was screened through 1/8-inch screen to recover small skeletal
elements and artifacts (such as shell beads). Soil samples were taken from the lower leg
regions of both burial features.

OSTEOLOGY PROTOCOL
Determining sex for subadults, even those as complete as Burial 2, is difficult,
primarily because the techniques employed by bioarchaeologists for determining sex are
based on secondary sexual characteristics, or those which develop after puberty (Bass
1987; Hunt and Gleiser 1955). Because of this, no method of sexing subadult remains has
been accepted as a standard. The subadults described in this analysis were not assessed as
to their sex.
Aging criteria were based on the state of bone and dental development following
criteria described in Steele and Bramblett (1988) and Ubelaker (1978). Length of
postcranial elements was also used to assess age following Fazekas and K6sa (1978) and
Marek (1990). All measurements were taken three times and then averaged to insure
accuracy of the dimensions. According to Steele and Bramblett (1988:6), the term infant
is used to describe a child ranging from birth through two years of age. However, for the
purposes of this article, the term infant is confmed to a child less than a year old, while
the term child is reserved for individuals over a year old.
After determining age, the skeletons were examined for dental, cranial, and
postcranial disorders. Areas suggestive of a disorder were assessed using a 1OX hand lens
and a dissecting microscope.

TAPHONOMY
Taphonomy describes postmortem changes in the condition of bone as it degrades
and decomposes (Haglund 1991:1). Although the two burial features at the Tyson site
were located in close proximity, the taphonomic condition of the bone differed markedly.
The subadult from Feature 15 was remarkably well-preserved, especially given the
extremely young age of the infant and the fact that infants often preserve very poorly.
Almost all bones were intact and still in articulation with each other. Very little in the
way of destructive taphonomic changes had occurred.
The skeletal remains from Feature 14, on the other hand, had undergone great
taphonomic changes and were not in a good state of preservation. Faunalturbation was
unequivocally evident in the filled tracks left by a burrowing animal, clearly seen
throughout the chest region. All the ribs and vertebrae had been driven to the left upper
area of the thorax during the burrowing process. There were also worm holes full of
processed dirt throughout the burial feature. Rodent gnawing was apparent on the left
femur and a "window" had been created on the dorsal surface where the cortex had been
completly gnawed away. The burial was badly disarticulated with the left tibia directly
beneath the right one. In addition, the os coxae were not recovered, nor were many arm
bones. The skull had been severely fragmented under the weight of a ceramic vessel. The
impression of the base of the vessel was still clearly visible in the matrix when the burial
was excavated. Root damage was essentially absent on the remains of Feature 14, as they
were for Feature 15.

BURIAL INVENTORY
Burial 1: Burial 1 consisted of the remains of two individuals (Table 1). The first

individual (B. 1a) was represented by dental, cranial, and postcranial remains. The only
portions of the face recovered include the fragmented maxillae and mandible, in addition

to six deciduous teeth (Table 2). The calvarium consisted of fragmented frontals,
temporals, parietals, and occipital. Postcranial recovery was limited to portions of the left
shoulder girdle, trunk, and right arm. The lower body was represented solely by both
femora and tibiae.
The second individual in this feature (B. 1b) was represented only by both
temporals and a portion of the left scapula, all of which were also recovered with the first
skeleton. Because these elements were recovered from the far left hand side of the
excavated pedestal, it is the author's contention that the bones representing the rest of this
child may be immediately adjacent to the excavated unit. Those elements recovered with
Burial 1a are thought to be the result of faunalturbation disturbing the remains of B. 1b
and commingling them with B. 1a.
Eight ceramic vessels, shells, and an antler rack had been placed on this burial and
were excavated in the field (see Middlebrook, this volume). In addition to these grave
goods, shell artifacts and red ocher were encountered during the lab excavation. A total of
seven columella beads were found in the grave fill, primarily around the neck region of
Burial1a. Four rectangular pieces of worked shell were also found in the fill. The lack of
holes indicate that they did not function as pendants, and their use is unknown. Red ocher
was encountered throughout the grave fill, but it does not appear worked, and may be a
naturally occurring element in the soil.

Burial 2: This burial represents the remains of one infant. The body was quite complete
(see Table 1). Facial elements include both zygomatics, maxillae, a hemimandible, and
one deciduous molar (see Table 2). Complete frontals and fragmented temporals and
parietals remained, as did a portion of the sphenoid and a complete bone of the inner ear.
Elements of both shoulder girdles, both arms, and hands were recovered. Almost all
vertebrae and ribs were recovered in situ as was the pelvic girdle. Both legs and elements
of the feet were also found. Red ocher was also found with this burial, but like Burial 1, it

Journal of Northeast Texas Archaeology, No.3 (1994)

43

was not worked and may have been a natural occurrence. A freshwater mussel shell was
placed below the baby's chin. From the shell's position and placement, it seems to have
been put there intentionally.

DEMOGRAPHY
The individual represented by the majority of skeletal remains in Burial 1 (B. la)
is believed to be one to two years old, with the most likely estimate being one and a half
years. This assessment is based on bone ossification, dental development, and the length
of the femora (Table 3). Occipital fusion usually begins by the fourth year of life; this

individual still has separate elements. In addition, the metopic suture of the frontal bone
is still open, indicating an age of less than two years. All teeth recovered from this
individual are deciduous, and their state of development indicates an age of 1 year ± four
months. The length of the femora most closely approximates an 18 month old child
(Marek 1990:64); however, a comparison to Ubelaker's (1978:48-49) data puts the
femoral length in an age range from six months to 18 months. The measurements from
Burial 1 place it at the upper end of this range. All of these age indicators support an age
between one and two years, with the best support for the age close to 18 months.
The second individual in Burial 1 (B. lb), represented only by both petrosals of
the temporals and the glenoid and acromion portions of the left scapula, is a child but an
exact age assessment is impossible. However, based on size alone, this child seems to be
of the same age, or a few months younger, than the more complete burial in this feature.
The individual representing Burial2 is a newborn infant, as determined by bone
size and bone and dental development. The occipital is still unfused and the frontal bones
have not yet joined. In addition, the mandible still consists of two unfused
hemimandibles, which usually fuse by the end of the first year. The crown for a
deciduous first upper premolar is present; its stage of development suggests an age of
birth ± two months. This assessment is supported by measurements taken on the long
bones (see Table 3), which suggest an age of 10 fetal months (Fazekas and K6sa 1978).
Measurements of both lateral portions of the occipital support this age as well.

SIZE
Measurements used to assess size are presented in Table 3. In young children such
as these, size is of more critical importance in determining age than biological affinity.
They cannot be used, however, to assess the degree of sexual dimorphism because sex is
not known. Therefore, the measures are presented here strictly as evidence of the age
suggested by the bioarchaeologist for the burials, and for comparative purposes for other

Journal of Northeast Texas Archaeology, No. 3 (1994)

45

researchers. Over a hundred measurements can potentially be evaluated on a complete
fetal skeleton (see Fazekas and K6sa 1978); the fragmentary nature of the individuals
recovered from the Tyson site limited the selected measurements. I further limited the
measured dimensions to those that are frequently cited in comparative reports, such as
length.

HEALTH

Although cranial and postcranial remains were examined for signs of medical
disorders, none were identified on these burials. In interpreting this fmding, it must be
considered that the extreme fragmentation of the primary individual in Burial1 may have
obscured existing medical disorderd, and the paucity of skeletal remains associated with
the secondary individual (B. 1b) precludes thorough examination. However,
fragmentation and a lack of skeletal remains are not issues with Burial 2. Presumably, if
lesions had been present on the bones of this individual, they would have been located
and identified. Because of the lack of skeletal indicators of health, no specific reasons for
the cause of death of any of these individuals could be identified. Apparently, their cause
for death was either such that no traces were ever left on bone, or they died before their
bone could be impacted.

CRANIAL MODIFICATION

The primary individual in Burial 1 exhibits a possible case of artificial cranial
modification. The right and left frontal bones of the child show A transverse depression
near the coronal suture. A raised area of bone lies immediately behind this depression, but
directly in front of the suture. This produces a coronal ridge which is characteristic of
some forms of cranial modification (Loveland 1980:118). Loveland (1980:118) noted that
this depression and subsequent ridge is "probably produced by means of an elongated bag
of sand (or clay) being strapped transversely across the skull near the coronal suture and

Journal of Northeast Texas Archaeology, No.3 (1994)

46

held in place by the board on top." An ethnohistoric account of one Coushatta group
living along the Trinity River approximately 25 km from Galveston Bay described the
technique for modifying the skulls of children. When the child was a week and a half old
it was:
... strapped on a board, as a cradle. A small concavity at one end of the
board served to hold a lump of wet clay in which the infant's head was
imbedded; (the infant lying on its back). Another lump of clay was
strapped on tightly bandaged over the infant's forehead, that bandage being
gradually tightened as the soft skull yielded to the pressure (Dyer 1916:3).
The impression left on the frontal bones of this Caddoan child corresponds well with
what one would expect to see given the above descriptions. However, due to the
fragmented nature of the frontal bones, the identification of cranial modification should
be viewed as equivocal.

DISCUSSION
Literature pertaining to the analysis of Caddoan human skeletal remains was
reviewed to find subadults of a comparable age to those at the Tyson site for comparison
in terms of disorders and cranial modifications. Seven sites had comparable data,
including Cedar Grove (Rose 1984), Horton (Brues 1958), Morris (Brues 1959), Nagle
(Brues 1957), Roden (Rose et al. 1981), Smullins (Elkins 1959), and Spike (Derrick and
Steele 1993). Of these sites, only Spike is located in Texas; the rest of the comparative
data come from Oklahoma (Horton, Morris, Nagle, Roden, and Smullins) and Arkansas
(Cedar Grove). However, some caveats must be given in using this comparative data.
First, many reports did not define the terms newborn and infant. For instance, Elkins
(1959) used the term infant for children ranging in age from one to three years old. It is
unclear how this term was used in other studies, as it is unclear as to how researchers
were defining a newborn. For these reasons, instead of focusing on subadults

Journal of Northeast Texas Archaeology, No.3 (1994)

47

corresponding tightly in age to those in this study, any child under the age of two years
was included in the comparative data. Second, there is no way to control for the degree of
fragmentation of individuals within these sites. Clearly, the more fragmented a sample,
the less it is to provide evidence of health disorders or cranial modifications.
Given these caveats, the seven sites produced a total of 28 children under the age
of two years to compare with the three from the Tyson site. Fourteen of the individuals
were children aged one year or older, and 14 were less than a year old. Of the infants, 10
were six months old or less, one was nine months old, and three were given the
generalized term "infant" in the original reports, with no more accurate age assessment
possible. When examining the comparative sample for health disorders, 35.7 percent of
the infants and children exhibited evidence of health problems. Of these, all showed signs
of periostitis, while one (3.6 percent) had porotic hyperostosis and cribra orbitalia, in
addition to periostitis. Sixty percent of the infants had medical disorders, while only 40
percent of the older children did.
The only other comparative data came from a survey done by Burnett (1990) of
human skeletal remains from the eastern portion of the Gulf Coastal Plain in Texas. Her
synthesis of skeletal data from the Middle Sabine drainage is based on three prehistoric
samples and one historic sample totaling 38 individuals. Comparisons here are limited to
the 30 prehistoric individuals who can be assigned to the Early, Middle, or Late Caddo
periods (Burnett 1990:406). Of these, only two individuals were subadults, and neither
had signs of infections. Burnett (1990:407) noted that Late Caddo samples from the
Middle Sabine region, and ones in the Sulphur, Cypress, and Upper Sabine regions, all
had low rates of adult and subadult infection. She further noted that:
all of these sites... are either small or have sparse occupational debris. It
appears that higher infection rates are restricted to the large mound centers
located along the Red River and the prehistoric Cooper Lake inhabitants

who resided in an area thought to be marginal to the Caddoan culture area
(Burnett 1990:407).
None of the reports mentioned cranial modifications to the subadults. Signs of
modification would not be expected in the skeletal remains of newborns, but it is possible
for even young children to show signs of this alteration. It is impossible to know whether
the lack of modification in the comparative samples is the result of fragmentation and
poor preservation, or whether these children, for cultural reasons, did not undergo cranial
modification.

CONCLUSIONS
A bioarchaeological analysis of the human skeletal remains excavated from the
Tyson site (41SY92) established that the remains from Features 14 and 15 represented a
total of three individuals, rather than the two that were expected based on field
assessments. Feature 14 contained the remains of a child between the ages of one and two
years old (B. la), although the most likely age estimate is 18 months. The frontal bones
of this child show evidence of possible cranial modification in the form of a transverse
depression, followed by a rise of bone near the coronal suture. In addition to this
individual, a second, probably younger child (B. lb) was represented in Feature 14 by
two petrosals of the temporal and a portion of a left scapula. It is likely that this child was
buried next to the first one and elements were displaced by burrowing animals. Feature
15 (Burial2) yielded the fairly complete osseous remains of an infant. Based on bone and
dental development, as well as a metric evaluation, it was determined that this child is a
neonate and was either stillborn, or died within a few days of its birth. None of the
individuals from the Tyson site showed indications of disease, although the rate noted in
the comparative samples was relatively high.
