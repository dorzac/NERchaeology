MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Owners Building Resources, L.P. (OBR), on behalf of the Manor Independent School
District (ISD), is proposing to construct the Pioneer Crossing Elementary School on a 13-acre
(ac) (5-hectare [ha]) tract located in Austin, Travis County, Texas. The proposed 13-ac (5-ha)
tract is located east of the Interstate Highway (IH) 35 corridor and north of the US Highway 290
and US Highway 183 interchange. Because Manor ISD is considered to be a subdivision of the
state, the undertaking falls under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas. OBR has
contracted with Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) to secure all applicable
environmental clearances for the undertaking. Horizon conducted the survey under Texas
Antiquities Committee (TAC) Permit No. 4672. The purpose of the survey was to determine if
any archeological/historical sites were located within the proposed development tract, and, if
any existed, to determine their eligibility for formal designation as State Archeological
Landmarks (SALs).
On 19 September 2007, a Horizon archeologist conducted an intensive pedestrian
survey of the Pioneer Crossing Tract to locate any cultural resource properties that potentially
would be impacted by the proposed development. This entailed intensive surface inspection as
well as subsurface shovel testing. To meet the Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey
Standards (TSMASS), a minimum of 1 shovel test per 2 acres is required on projects of this
size. As such, a minimum of 7 shovel tests were required within the 13-ac (5-ha) Pioneer
Crossing Tract. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS and excavated a total of 8 shovel tests within
the proposed development tract.
The intensive surface inspection and shovel testing regimen resulted in entirely negative
findings. No cultural resources of any kind, including prehistoric or historic archeological sites,
isolated occurrences of artifacts, or historic structures or objects, were identified as a result of
intensive survey activities. In general, the Pioneer Crossing Tract consists of an open grassy
field bordered virtually on all sides by burgeoning residential development. Dense clayey soils
were consistently encountered throughout the Pioneer Crossing Tract with areas of recent
construction-related disturbance identified adjacent to the bordering roads.
Based on the survey-level investigations documented in this report, it is Horizon’s
opinion that no significant cultural resources will be affected by the development of the
proposed 13-ac (5-ha) Pioneer Crossing Tract. Horizon therefore recommends that cultural

resources clearance be granted for the project. However, in the unlikely event that any human
remains or burial furniture are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or
ongoing maintenance of the property, even in previously surveyed areas, all work should cease
immediately and the Texas Historical Commission (THC) should be notified of the discovery.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

Owners Building Resources, L.P. (OBR), on behalf of the Manor Independent School
District (ISD), is proposing to construct the Pioneer Crossing Elementary School on a 13-acre
(ac) (5-hectare [ha]) tract located in Austin, Travis County, Texas (Figures 1 and 2). The
proposed 13-ac (5-ha) tract is located east of the Interstate Highway (IH) 35 corridor and north
of the US Highway 290 and US Highway 183 interchange. Because Manor ISD is considered to
be a subdivision of the state, the undertaking falls under the regulations of the Antiquities Code
of Texas. OBR has contracted with Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) to secure all
applicable environmental clearances for the undertaking. Horizon conducted the survey under
Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) Permit No. 4672. The purpose of the survey was to
determine if any archeological/historical sites were located within the proposed development
tract, and, if any existed, to determine their eligibility for formal designation as State
Archeological Landmarks (SALs).
The cultural resources investigation consisted of an archival review, an intensive
pedestrian survey of the Pioneer Crossing Tract, and the production of a report suitable for
review by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas
Historical Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and
the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management
Reports. Abigail Peyton served as Principal Investigator for the project while Jared Wiersema
(Horizon field technician) conducted the field investigation on 19 September 2007 to locate any
cultural resource properties that potentially would be impacted by the proposed development.
This entailed intensive surface inspection as well as subsurface shovel testing.
To meet the Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS), a
minimum of 1 shovel test per 2 acres is required on projects of this size. As such, a minimum of
7 shovel tests were required within the 13-ac (5-ha) Pioneer Crossing Tract. Horizon exceeded
the TSMASS and excavated a total of 8 shovel tests. The Pioneer Crossing Tract itself consists
of an overgrown agricultural field underlain by dense clayey sediments characteristic of the
Blackland Prairie. Newly constructed roads and culverts associated with nearby residential
development were identified along the periphery of the tract, indicating that portions of the tract
have been recently impacted by encroaching development. This was further evidenced by the
presence of heavily mottled clayey soils particularly along the southwestern border of the tract.

Chapter 1.0: Introduction

The intensive surface inspection and shovel testing regimen resulted in entirely negative
findings. No cultural resources of any kind, including prehistoric or historic archeological sites,
isolated occurrences of artifacts, or historic structures or objects, were identified as a result of
intensive survey activities. In general, the Pioneer Crossing Tract was found to consist of dense
Pre-Holocene clays with portions of the tract recently disturbed by construction-related activity.
As such, the probability for encountering intact cultural materials was relatively low.
Based on the survey-level investigations documented in this report, it is Horizon’s
opinion that no potentially significant cultural resources will be affected by the development of
the proposed Pioneer Crossing Tract. Horizon therefore recommends that cultural resources
clearance be granted for the project. However, in the unlikely event that any human remains or
burial furniture are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing
maintenance of the property, even in previously surveyed areas, all work should cease
immediately and the THC should be notified of the discovery.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

The Pioneer Crossing Tract is located east of the IH-35 corridor and north of the US
Highway 290 and US Highway 183 interchange in Austin, Travis County, Texas. It can be found
on the US Geological Survey 7.5-minute series Austin East, Texas, topographic quadrangle
map (USGS 1988) (see Figure 1). General photographs of the Pioneer Crossing Tract are
presented in Figures 3 to 6.

2.1

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The Pioneer Crossing Tract is located within central Travis County, Texas, at the
boundary of 3 significant physiographic provinces—the Edwards Plateau, the Blackland Prairie,
and the Gulf Coastal Plain. The Blackland Prairie is a narrow physiographic zone situated
between the Edwards Plateau to the west and the Gulf Coastal Plain to the east. It is mostly
characterized as a gently rolling prairie that extends in a narrow band along the eastern edge of
the Balcones fault zone from the Red River Valley in northeastern Texas to the southern edge
of the Edwards Plateau. This is an area of low topographic relief and poor drainage in which
water often ponds after rainstorms and streams flow at very gentle gradients. The Edwards
Plateau and Balcones Escarpment are associated with a great fault system that arcs across
Texas to form a distinct boundary between uplands composed primarily of limestone bedrock
and lower plains composed mostly of softer rocks. In places, this boundary is marked by an
abrupt scarp (the Balcones Escarpment) and in others by a more gradational ramp, but the
entire length of this transition zone is a major ecotone in terms of topography, bedrock,
hydrology, soil, vegetation, and animal life.
More specifically, the Pioneer Crossing Tract is located just east of IH 35 north of Walnut
Creek in the Colorado River basin. The Colorado River flows southeastward across the
Blackland Prairie and Gulf Coast Plain, ultimately discharging into the Gulf of Mexico a short
distance northeast of Matagorda Bay.

2.2

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

The Pioneer Crossing Tract is underlain by a thick sequence of Cretaceous-age,
sedimentary rock strata that dip at a rate of approximately 5 meters (m) (15 feet [ft]) per mile to
the southeast (Harper 2004; Werchan et al. 1974). This simple geologic structure is
complicated by the Mount Bonnell Fault, a significant north-to-northeast-trending fault.

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

Rock strata on the east side of the fault were displaced downward approximately 152 m
(500 ft) relative to the rocks on the west side during the Miocene Epoch. Displacement ceased
approximately 12 million years ago, and the fault is now seismically inactive.
On the west side of the Mount Bonnell fault, the Kainer Formation of the Edwards Group
extends from ground surface to a depth of about 61 m (200 ft) below surface. The Kainer
Formation consists of shaly, nodular limestone; calcareous mudstone; and crystalline limestone.
The 15-m- (50-foot-) thick Atco Formation crops out on the east side of the fault and consists of
chalky limestone and thin beds of clayey limestone and marl.
Soils in Travis County, Texas, formed in several types of parent material. In the central
part of the county, where the Pioneer Crossing Tract is located, soil parent material consists of
chalk, marl, limestone, and marly limestone. The Soil Survey of Travis County, Texas (Werchan
et al. 1974) indicates that there is 1 soil within the Pioneer Crossing Tract: Houston black clay, 1
to 3% slopes (HnB).

2.3

CLIMATE

Evidence for climatic change from the Pleistocene to the present is most often obtained
through studies of pollen and faunal sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins 1995).
Bryant and Holloway (1985) present a sequence of climatic change for nearby east-central
Texas from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.) through the Late Glacial
period (14,000 to 10,000 B.P.) to the Post-Glacial period (10,000 B.P. to present). Evidence
from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period suggests that the climate in east-central Texas was
considerably cooler and more humid than at present. Pollen data indicate that the region was
more heavily forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods (Bryant and Holloway
1985). The Late Glacial period was characterized by slow climatic deterioration and a slow
warming and/or drying trend (Collins 1995). In east-central Texas, the deciduous woodlands
were gradually replaced by grasslands and post oak savannas (Bryant and Holloway 1985).
During the Post-Glacial period, the east-central Texas environment appears to have been more
stable. The deciduous forests had long since been replaced by prairies and post oak savannas.
The drying and/or warming trend that began in the Late Glacial period continued into the midHolocene, at which point there appears to have been a brief amelioration to more mesic
conditions lasting from roughly 6000 to 5000 B.P. Recent studies by Bryant and Holloway
(1985) indicate that modern environmental conditions in east-central Texas were probably
achieved by 1,500 years ago.
Travis County is located within the south-central climatic division. The modern climate is
typically dry to subhumid with long, hot summers and short, mild winters. The climate is
influenced primarily by tropical Maritime air masses from the Gulf of Mexico, but it is modified by
polar air masses. Tropical Maritime air masses predominate throughout spring, summer, and
fall. Modified polar air masses are dominant in winter and provide a continental climate
characterized by considerable variations in temperature.
On average throughout the past century, precipitation and temperature in Texas
manifest regional clines, with mean annual precipitation totals declining fairly regularly from east

8

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the 13-Acre Pioneer Crossing Elementary School Tract

to west and mean annual temperature declining equally evenly from northwest to southeast
(Larkin and Bomar 1983). In Central Texas, climate has fluctuated from subtropical humid to
subtropical subhumid. Average annual precipitation totals 81 centimeters (cm) (32 inches [in])
and temperature averages 19° Celsius (°C) (67° Fahrenheit [°F]) annually, ranging from 36°C
(96°F) in August (the warmest month) to 15°C (59°F) in January (the coldest month). During
this time, however, drier periods lasting from 3 to 7 years, when total annual rainfall ranged from
30 to 64 cm (12 to 25 in), were followed by abnormally wet years with 114 to 127 cm (45 to
50 in) of rainfall.
Two annual precipitation peaks, which typically occur in May and September, are
associated with frontal storms that form when southward-moving cool air masses collide with
warm, moist air masses moving inland from the Gulf of Mexico (Bomar 1983; Carr 1967). The
topographic discontinuity along the Balcones Escarpment lies directly in the path of the Gulf
storm trace and increases the lift in convective storms to produce extreme amounts of rainfall
(Baker 1975). Lower rainfall amounts are characteristic of winter and late summer. In winter,
frontal storms pass so frequently that there is little time for moisture to increase, and prevailing
upper-level winds from west to east often dominate over meridional flow, meaning that much of
the available moisture is derived from the Pacific rather than from the Gulf of Mexico. In
summer, cool fronts rarely penetrate into the region, and rainfall occurs primarily as localized,
thermal convective storms.

2.4

BIOTA

The 13-acre Pioneer Crossing Tract is situated within the Edwards Plateau ecological
area and the Live Oak-Ashe Juniper Woods vegetational area of Texas (Gould 1975; McMahan
et al. 1984). Vegetation associated with the Live Oak-Ashe Juniper Woods includes plateau
live oak (Quercus fusiformis), Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei), Texas Oak (Quercus buckleyi),
shin oak (Quercus sinuata), cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia), evergreen sumac (Rhus virens),
escarpment cherry (Prunus serotina), saw greenbriar (Smilax bona-nox), poison ivy
(Toxicodendron radicans), twistleaf yucca (Yucca rupicola), elbowbush (Forestiera pubescens),
cedar sage (Salvia roemeriana), little bluestem (Schizacharium scoparium), Texas grama
(Bouteloua rigidiseta), meadow dropseed (Sporobolus asper var. drummondii), and Texas
wintergrass (Nassella leucotricha) (McMahan et al. 1984).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The archeological record of Central Texas spans the known cultural-historical sequence:
Paleo-Indian, 11,200 to 8000 BP; Archaic, 8000 to 1400 BP; and Late Prehistoric, 1400 to 400
BP. A brief breakdown of this general sequence is presented below.

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (CA. 11,200 TO 8000 BP)

The Paleo-Indian period is believed to be the earliest cultural occupation in the Central
Texas region. This stage is characterized typologically by the occurrence of distinctive
lanceolate projectile points and highly mobile settlement and exploitation patterns. These
populations probably practiced a foraging (i.e., hunting and gathering) type of subsistence
(Prewitt 1981; Weir 1976), although the best-known sites exhibit a focus on the exploitation of
large mammals, including Mammuthus sp. and Bison antiquus. Investigations at sites such as
the Kincaid Rockshelter, Wilson-Leonard, and Gault have shown that, during the early part of
the Paleo-Indian, the Clovis stage, subsistence included large herbivores (e.g., mammoth,
bison, and horse) as well as smaller animals such as water turtles, badgers, and raccoons. A
multitude of plants are presumed to have also been an important part of the aboriginal diet.
However, during the later part of the Paleo-Indian period, the Folsom and Plainview stages,
subsistence seems to have depended more heavily on the specialized hunting of big game,
particularly bison. This presumption is based on the fact that only camps, stone-working
locations, and kill sites, mostly in or near grassland habitats, have been documented (Collins
1995:382). This change was most likely attributable to the climate, which had become warmer
and drier than the previous Clovis stage.

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 8000 TO 1400 BP)

The Archaic period, which covers 2/3 of Central Texas prehistory (Collins 1995), is
divided into 3 subperiods: Early (8000 to 5000 BP), Middle (5000 to 3000 BP), and Late (3000
to 1200 BP) (Hester 1986). The beginning of the Archaic period in Texas represents a similar
transition found world-wide at approximately the same time, the most noted indicators being the
extinction of Pleistocene megafauna and climatic changes. In Texas, there was a gradual
decrease in moisture and humidity reflecting the intensification of warming and drying trends
first noted during the Clovis-Folsom transition. An often-quoted response to these climatic
changes was a greater and more varied use of local resources; in actuality, this was already the
case in most places. Plant-processing implements such as manos and metates and earth

HJN 070147 AR

11

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

ovens become more evident in the archeological record, while the hunting of game continued.
Although still nomadic, people of the Archaic period restricted their travel to smaller areas than
the Paleo-Indian groups.
3.2.1

Early Archaic (8000 to 5000 BP)

The Early Archaic, the least understood period, is distinguished by the switch from
PaleoIndian lanceolate-shaped points to notched-and-stemmed points. Overall, the Early
Archaic patterns in Texas are fairly similar throughout the state. Hester (1989) observed that,
prior to 5000 BP, the late Holocene hunters and foragers were essentially indistinguishable in
terms of subsistence strategies across Region 3, which includes the Central Texas Plateau
Prairie, South Texas Plains, and Lower Pecos Canyonlands. After that date, regionally
distinctive projectile points emerge. Hughes (1991) also noted similarities when he wrote that
the Early Archaic typological developments on the Texas High Plains resembled developments
in Central and Southwestern Texas as well as in other bordering regions.
Although settlement patterns for the Early Archaic are little known, it is assumed that the
population density was low and organized into small bands practicing a mobile, generalized
subsistence and settlement pattern. The wide distribution of artifacts suggests that mobility was
high and territories relatively undefined. McKinney (1981), among others, has noted that the
distribution of Early Archaic sites was apparently concentrated along the Balcones Escarpment.
This phenomenon may possibly reflect the greater availability of water resources along this
feature during an arid climatic interval (Hester 1989).
Sites containing Early Archaic components are open campsites such as Loeve, WilsonLeonard, Richard Beene, Sleeper, Landslide, Granberg II, Jetta Court, and Hall’s Cave. Lithic
materials found within these components include grinding implements, hammerstones, projectile
points, a variety of unifacial and bifacial chipped stone instruments, and Clear Fork and
Guadalupe bifaces. The Clear Fork tools, although indicative primarily of the Early Archaic,
actually appeared in the Late PaleoIndian period and, in some regions, lingered into Late
Archaic and Late Prehistoric times (Hughes 1991).
3.2.2

Middle Archaic (5000 to 3000 BP)

The Middle Archaic is marked by an increased number of sites, which may reflect an
expanding population, the development of regionally distinct cultural patterns, and changes in
settlement, technology, social systems, and territorial boundaries (Black and McGraw 1985:38).
Hester (1986) suggests that, during this period, the inhabitants of the Balcones Escarpment
region developed specialized adaptations to the hunting and gathering of abundant regional
resources, particularly acorns and white-tailed deer.
Site types include open campsites located near streams or tributaries, lithic workshops in
upland areas, and special-activity sites such as hunting camps or food-processing stations
(Black and McGraw 1985). Large burned rock features (hearths and rock ovens) of the early
part of the Middle Archaic gave way in the later Middle Archaic to burned rock middens (Collins
1995).
These latter features have been interpreted as representing several different
subsistence practices. For example, Hester (1986) proposed that they represent intensive

12

070147_arch_survey_report

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the 13-Acre Pioneer Crossing Elementary School Tract

utilization of acorns, while Johnson and Goode (1994:26) suggested that they were more
frequently being used to cook xerophytes such as sotol. This latter explanation has been
supported by a number of recent investigations where evidence of preserved camas bulbs have
been recovered within oven and midden contexts (Brownlow 2003, 2004a, 2004b; Bush 2004;
Dering 1999, 2002; Mauldin et al. 2003; Ricklis and Collins 1994). Middle Archaic projectile
points include Nolan, Travis, Langtry, and Pedernales (Black 1989), the latter of which is
considered by Hester (1986) to be diagnostic of this time period in the Balcones Escarpment
region.
3.2.3

Late Archaic (3000 to 1400 BP)

The Late Archaic is represented by a continuation, and possibly intensification, of the
subsistence patterns seen in the Middle Archaic (Hester 1986; Collins 1995). The use of
burned rock midden sites continued throughout the Middle Archaic, peaking during the latter
part of this period (Collins 1995). Large cemetery sites are first noted during the Late Archaic
and may reflect the establishment of territories and subsistence schedules (Black 1989:30;
Black and McGraw 1985; Story 1985:49). Hester (1986) suggests that the development of
wide-ranging trade contacts also may have occurred around this time. Characteristic projectile
points include triangular types such as Lange, Montell, Castroville, and Marcos, along with
smaller, expanding-stem points such as Ensor, Frio, Darl, and Fairland.
Although Hester (1986) places the Late Archaic between 3000 and 1400 BP, a later
carving of the Archaic period by Johnson and Goode (1994) attempts to push back the initiation
point of the Late Archaic to around 4300 BP. This more recent division is based on what is
seen as a strong continuity between the material culture and subsistence practices of groups
utilizing the Pedernales point style and those utilizing the later Montell point style. Primarily,
Johnson and Goode (1994) point to similarities in the blade shape of these 2 styles, as well as
similar large, billet-thinned knives utilized during the times of these point styles. They also note
the continuance of Pedernales period plant baking within existing burned rock middens by later
groups utilizing Montell points. In fact, they view this continuity as evidence of a distinct culture
or “folk” on the eastern Edwards Plateau.
In addition to attempting to push back the initiation date of the Late Archaic period,
Johnson and Goode (1994) have also attempted to further divide the Late Archaic period into 2
subperiods (Late Archaic I and Late Archaic II) based on the material cultures as well as climatic
conditions. Their Late Archaic I subperiod coincides with the Dry Edwards Interval when xeric
conditions persisted between 4300 and 2600 BP. Diagnostic projectile points of this subperiod
include the Bulverde, Pedernales, Marshall, Montell, and Castroville styles. The Lange style
may also correspond to this subperiod based on the recovery of Lange specimens in
association with both Montell and Castroville specimens at 41WM815 and dated between 2800
to 2400 BP (Brownlow 2003). Johnson and Goode (1994:34) note that burned rock middens on
the Edwards Plateau during the Late Archaic I subperiod are more frequent than in any other
period. The increase in burned rock middens during this subperiod is undoubtedly a result of
the xeric climatic conditions that effectively expanded the ranges of certain geophytes such as
sotol and yucca—foodstuffs that require extended baking periods (in stone-lined ovens) in order
to break down their starches into edible simple sugars. The xeric conditions likely resulted in

HJN 070147 AR

13

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

the spread of grasslands on the plateau, which would have in turn attracted herds of buffalo.
Plentiful geophytic plants, as well as the presence of buffalo herds, may account for an increase
in human populations in the region as well (Weir 1976; Prewitt 1985).
Johnson and Goode’s (1994) Late Archaic II subperiod spans the time period between
2600 and 1400 BP. They equate this subperiod to more mesic climatic conditions that resulted
in the active aggradation of floodplains at many localities. The Marcos, Ensor, Frio, and Darl
dart point styles are viewed as indicators of this subperiod. Observing a break in the broad
blade stylistic tradition suggested for the Pedernales and Montell styles, Johnson and Goode
(1994:37) suggest that similarities in the Marcos style dart points to styles on the Southern
Plains may indicate an influx of new occupants from the Southern Plains or perhaps a borrowing
of projectile making techniques from this region. In addition to a perceived influx of new people
or technologies, Johnson and Goode (1994) also suggest some degree of social intercourse
with groups from the eastern US. This is evidenced by the recovery of materials such as whelk
shells and atlatl weights of exotic stone from burials dating to this time period. Although not
conclusive, Johnson and Goode (1994:37) suggest that these materials may indicate a
spreading of Eastern religious cult ideas into the region. While it cannot be conclusively stated
that groups on the Edwards Plateau subscribed to the beliefs and practices of the Eastern
religions, the evidence does suggest that groups on the plateau participated in extensive trading
with Eastern groups, primarily contributing large, thin corner-tanged knives made from local
Edwards chert.

3.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 1400 TO 400 BP)

The Late Prehistoric period is separated from the preceding Archaic by the introduction
of the bow and arrow and ceramics. Two phases are recognized within this period: the Austin
(ca. 1400 to 800 BP) and Toyah (ca. 800 to 400 BP) phases. The Austin phase is characterized
by the transition from the use of the atlatl and dart to that of the bow and arrow and arrow
points, particularly the expanding-stemmed Scallorn type. This phase is also distinguished by a
decline in population and changes in settlement practices, in which there was a shift from open
to protected (rockshelter) sites (Black 1989:32; Collins 1995:385). In spite of these changes,
most archeologists agree that Late Archaic subsistence practices and settlement patterns
appear to have continued during the Austin phase (Black 1989; Collins 1995; Prewitt 1974).
The Toyah phase is characterized by relatively rapid changes in technology, notably
pottery (both local and imported from the Caddo area); large, thin bifaces; Perdiz (contractingstem) arrow points; and prismatic blades (Black 1989; Collins 1995). Limited horticulture may
also have begun during this time. The Toyah tool kit was associated with the hunting of bison,
deer, and antelope, and, although nearly all sites dating to this phase have yielded bison bones,
deer was the most significant faunal resource during this time (Black 1989:32). Evidence for
agriculture is seen in the occasional corn cob found at sites such as the Timmeron Rockshelter
in Hays County. Of course, the corn could also be attributed to the same trade network that
was bringing in the Caddoan pottery.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Archival research conducted online via the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC) Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas indicated that 9 archeological sites, 1 neighborhood survey property,
and 1 National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) property have been recorded within a 1.2mile (2.0-kilometer) radius of the Pioneer Crossing Tract (2007). Of the 9 previously recorded
sites, 2 are Archaic open camp sites (41TV134 and 41TV353), 2 are cemeteries (41TV1708 and
41TV1709), 2 are prehistoric lithic scatters (41TV2041 and 41TV2042), 1 is a historic
homestead known as the Doorknob Hilltop House (41TV1410), and 2 are sites for which no data
exists (41TV655 and 41TV664).
The neighborhood survey property is located south of the Pioneer Crossing Tract at the
intersection of Cameron Road and Sprinkle Road. It consists of the Victorian-style Barr
Jamison House and dates to the late 19th century. The NRHP property, known as the William
Braxton Barr House, is located south of the intersection of Sprinkle Road and Springdale Road
and also dates to the late 19th century.
No sites, including any listed in the NRHP or formally designated as SALs, are located
within or immediately adjacent to the current property boundaries.
According to the Atlas
maps, no formal cultural resources surveys been conducted within the boundaries of the
Pioneer Crossing Tract.

5.0 METHODOLOGY

A Horizon archeologist conducted the intensive pedestrian survey of the proposed 13-ac
(5-ha) Pioneer Crossing Tract on 19 September 2007. This survey included intensive surface
inspection as well as subsurface shovel testing. To meet the TSMASS, a minimum of 1 shovel
test per 2 acres is required for projects of this size. As such, a minimum of 7 shovel tests were
required within the 13-ac (5-ha) development tract. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS and
excavated a total of 8 shovel tests within the proposed Pioneer Crossing Tract.
All excavated matrices were screened through 6-millimeter (mm) (1/4-inch) hardware
mesh and examined for cultural materials. In general, the Pioneer Crossing Tract consists of an
open grassy field bordered virtually on all sides by burgeoning residential development. Dense
clayey soils were consistently encountered throughout the 13-ac tract with areas of recent
construction-related disturbance identified adjacent to the bordering roads.
The field crew set out to employ a non-collection policy for non-diagnostic cultural
materials, including lithic debitage, burned rock, historic glass, and metal scrap. Such materials
were to be described, sketched, and/or photo-documented in the field and replaced where they
were found. In the event that diagnostic cultural materials (e.g., projectile points, ceramics, etc.)
were encountered, they were to be collected and placed in resealable plastic bags labeled with
relevant provenience information. However, because no cultural resources were observed, this
practice was not brought into play.
Field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, landforms, cultural materials
observed, etc. Standardized shovel test forms were completed for each excavated shovel test,
and photographs with a photo log were completed when appropriate. Shovel test location data
were acquired via a handheld Global Positioning System (GPS) unit using the Universal
Transverse Mercatur (UTM) coordinate system and map datum North American Datum (NAD)
27. Shovel test locations are presented in Figure 7, and shovel test data are provided in
Appendix A.

6.0 RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1

RESULTS

The intensive surface inspection and shovel testing regimen resulted in entirely negative
findings. The Pioneer Crossing Tract is dominated by high, thick grasses underlain by dense
clayey sediments. The presence of heavily mottled clayey soils, particularly along the
southwestern border of the property, indicates that recent ground-disturbing activity associated
with the rapid residential expansion characteristic of the area has taken place along the outer
fringes of the Pioneer Crossing Tract. Additionally, this area has historically been used for
farming and ranching activities, which has likely significantly impacted the upper layers of
sediment. As such, the overall potential for intact cultural materials within the Pioneer Crossing
Tract is considered relatively low.

6.2

RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the survey-level investigation documented in this report, it is Horizon’s opinion
that no significant cultural resources will be affected by the development of the proposed 13-ac
(5-ha) Pioneer Crossing Tract. Horizon therefore recommends that cultural resources clearance
be granted for the project. However, in the unlikely event that any human remains or burial
furniture are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing
maintenance of the property, even in previously surveyed areas, all work should cease
immediately and the THC should be notified of the discovery.
