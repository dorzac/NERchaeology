ABSTRACT

Devon Energy Production Company, L.P. intends to construct the
Benbrook Master Development Plan’s well pad and associated lease roads
and pipelines in southwestern Tarrant County, Texas near the western
shore of Lake Benbrook. AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) conducted a cultural
resources inventory of the total 15.705 acres for the well pad study area on
January 12, 2010. Based on the negative results of the survey, no cultural
resources will be impacted by implementation of the Benbrook Master
Development Plan. Consequently, further cultural resource investigations
are unwarranted. If buried cultural deposits are discovered during the
development of the study area, work should immediately cease in that area
and the Bureau of Land Management should be notified.

INTRODUCTION
Devon Energy Production Company, L.P., headquartered in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma,
intends to construct the Benbrook Master Development Plan well pad with its associated
lease roads and pipelines in Tarrant County, Texas (Figure 1). 36 possible drill-hole
location are presented in the plan clustered in three discrete areas: The southeast corner,
northeast corner, and in the west-central area of the pad. Located just above the western
shore of Lake Benbrook and extending east from Stevens Drive, the study area
encompasses a cumulative 15.705 acre Area of Potential Effect (APE). The APE for the
Benbrook Master Development Plan well pad, trapezoidal in shape, is 11.74 acres.
Additionally, the APE includes 120.21’ x 20’ (0.06 acres) for Lease Road A, 120.17’ x
20’ (0.06 acres) for Lease Road B. Pipeline “A” (114.91’) and Pipeline “B” (105.42’)
parallel the northeastern side of their equivalently named lease roads. The total project
APE is 15.705 acres.
The purpose of the archaeological survey was to determine if cultural resources were
present, and, if present, makes recommendations about their significance and how they
would be impacted by construction. The survey was done for Reagan Smith Energy
Solutions, Inc. of Oklahoma City, OK.
Relevant federal legislation includes the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as
amended (PL-96-515), the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), the
Archeological and Historical Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93-291),
Executive Order No. 11593 “Protection and Enhancement of the Cultural Environment,”
and Procedures for the Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties (36CFR800),
Appendix C. The study was conducted under BLM Permit Number 219-2920-07-D, and
on January 12, 2010, an intensive pedestrian survey was conducted of the well pad study
area. The Bureau of Land Management requires that 10 acres for a well pad be surveyed
as well as a 100 foot buffer beyond the 10 acres.
This report has been written in accordance with the report guidelines prepared by the
Council of Texas Archeologists (n.d.) as well as with applicable BLM guidelines. The
following report presents a brief description of the natural environment and cultural
history of the vicinity. This is followed by a description of the research design and
methodology. The results of the investigation follow and constitute the body of the
report. The last chapter presents recommendations that arise from the study. A list of
references cited concludes the report.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
Tarrant County is located in North Central Texas. The county consists mainly of
undulating to hilly land and vegetation consists of tall grasses and various species of trees
such as mesquite, elm, oak, pecan and walnut. The waters in the Western Cross Timbers
drain into the West Fork of the Trinity River. Streams in the Fort Worth Prairie, in which
the study area lies (Dyksterhuis 1946:Figure 1), drain into the upper tributaries of the
Clear Fork of the Trinity River.
The study area is underlain by Pleistocene-age fluviatile terrace deposits, as well as the
Lower Cretaceous Goodland Limestone (Bureau of Economic Geology 1972). Soils in
the study area are primarily Purves clay with 0 to 3 percent slopes and Sanger clay with 1
to 3 percent slopes (Ressel 1981: Sheet 47, 48).
Fauna are varied and abundant with at least 49 species of mammals, 39 species of snakes,
17 species of reptiles and other species (Blair 1950:101–102). Common forms of fauna
include deer, raccoon, opossum, rabbit, lizards and turtles. Armadillos have invaded the
area within the past 50 years. Various authors, including Lynott (1979), believed that the
prairie was inhabited by now extinct bison and antelope.
Prikryl (1993:192-193) suggested that prior to 12,000 BC, the climate of north central
Texas was cooler and moister than at present. Between 12,000 and 8,000 BC, the climate
became warmer and this continued to the present, but with brief mesic periods. He adds
that the presence of high grass pollen and low arboreal pollen between 5550 to 1050 BC
indicates a drying with a return of arboreal pollen after 1050 BC The later change is
similar to today’s environment. High grass pollen also occurred at approximately AD 450
and from AD 1550 to 1650, and this also indicates drier periods. The presence of
paleosols between AD 1 and 1000 suggested an increase in moisture during this period
with a return to drier conditions after AD 1000.

CULTURAL HISTORY
Over the past several decades, cultural resources investigations in North Central Texas
have varied due to the locations and types of projects being carried out. Therefore, the
database of information to which new projects can be compared is limited. The following
culture history is derived from the monograph Lower Elm Fork Prehistory by Daniel J.
Prikryl (1990). Prikryl's framework includes the six prehistoric periods, to which the
historic Native American and European periods have been added.
Using Prikryl’s time framework, the following paragraphs present a brief description of
the culture history of the region.
Historic European
Historic Native American
Late Prehistoric II
Late Prehistoric I
Late Archaic
Middle Archaic
Early Archaic
Paleoindian

AD 1800 to Present
AD 1600 to AD 1850
AD 1300 to AD 1600
AD 700 to AD 1300
2,000 BC to AD 700
4,000 BC to 2,000 BC
6,000 BC to 4,000 BC
ca. 11,000 BC to 6,000 BC

The Paleoindian period is distinguished by distinctive projectile point styles attributed to
this period (Bever and Meltzer 2007:Table 1). Many of the points are made of exotic
cherts that are not native to North Central Texas. The Lewisville site and the Aubrey
Clovis site in Denton County are the only excavated Paleoindian sites in the region.
Surface artifacts generally come from deposits on stream terraces above the level of the
active floodplain. This was a period when large mammals became extinct, and their
extinction is attributed in part to a general environmental drying.
During the Early Archaic, the general drying continued, and sites are found on stream
terraces. There is a hint of population increase, and Lynott (1981:103) suggests that there
was increased emphasis on the use of bottomland food resources. Prikryl (1990:71) can
not confirm Lynott's suggestion, and in fact, he reports fewer bottomland sites than
during the previous period. Middle Archaic sites are predominantly found on the first
terrace above stream floodplains. As earlier, sites tend to be along the Elm Fork rather
than along the smaller tributaries. It appears that population density continued to be low.
Late Archaic sites increase in number over the previous period, and sites are located both
along the rivers and along tributaries. There appears to be a strong shift in site location to
the tributary streams and a pronounced population explosion. Local Ogallala quartzite is
being used prominently at this time, and this observation is taken by some authors as
evidence of increased territorial restrictions (Prikryl 1990).
During the Late Prehistoric I period, the bow and arrow and pottery appear in artifact
assemblages. Houses and probable evidence of agriculture first appear during this period,
although none are known in the immediate area. Site locations mirror those of the Late

Archaic, and quartzite continued as the common material used for chipped stone
projectiles and tools. The West Fork Paleosol is dated to this period, and drying
continued into the subsequent period (Peter and McGregor 1988; Ferring 1990).
The Late Prehistoric II is highlighted by the prominence of buffalo in archaeological sites
and the appearance of tools normally expected to occur at sites on the High Plains of
West Texas. It also appears that sites are once again located on sandy terraces above the
floodplains (Peter and McGregor 1988).
Beginning in the 1830s and continuing into the 1840s, according to some historical
documents, the aboriginal inhabitants of North Central Texas continued to play a role in
the history of that region. Very little archaeological evidence, however, of historic Native
American occupation has been found in the area. This is a pattern seen throughout much
of Texas, and one which has been suggested is due to the inability of the Native
Americans to adapt to the changing climate (Skinner 1988). The 1830s and 1840s were
decades of Anglo expansion into North Central Texas. Garrett (1972:24), a wellrespected Fort Worth historian, has stated that "Indian hostilities almost depopulated
North Texas [of Anglo settlers] after 1839. It dwindled to less than half". According to
tradition, many Indians of several tribes roamed the region until well into the 1860s.
The earliest Anglo settlements in Tarrant County were Bird's Fort, established around
1840, and Lonesome Dove, settled in 1845. Lonesome Dove, located near present-day
Grapevine, was the first permanent settlement in Tarrant County (Garrett 1972:55). The
county itself was organized in 1850, but it was not until 1860 that Fort Worth was
officially named the county seat, that designation having been transferred from Birdville
(Webb 1952:708). Settlers, however, had been steadily arriving in the county during
those 20 years. Many came through the auspices of Peters Colony land grants, although
only 160 families and single pioneers took advantage of the grants (Garrett 1972:57).
In 1849, Major Ripley Allan Arnold was assigned to build a military post on the upper
Trinity in the largely uninhabited geographical region of the Grand Prairie and the
Eastern Cross Timbers. This encampment was established on a high bluff overlooking the
confluence of the West and Clear Forks of the Trinity River. Within a short length of
time, there were about 12 double log cabins near the fort, and life in Fort Town definitely
had its refinements (Garrett 1972:80).
The Civil War took its toll on Tarrant County's population, as most of the able-bodied
men left to fight for the Confederacy. Fort Worth's renaissance was motivated by growth
of the cattle industry and the arrival of the railroad. By 1870, it is estimated that 300,000
head of cattle had been driven through Fort Worth. By the end of the nineteenth century,
Fort Worth had shed its "six-shooter" culture for a more refined cow town culture which
was beginning to use its past to advantage.
Oil was the next great influence on the life of Fort Worth. Fort Worth became the
gateway to the West Texas oil fields (Knight 1953:192) and both fed the population and
served as an impetus for post-World War II industrial development. The Convair plant

and Tarrant Field (later Carswell Field) had played an important role during the war, and
rather than lose their jobs the employees were retained to work on a secret project, the B36. Once again, Fort Worth became a focal point for an industry as she had for so many
decades.
Previous Investigations
According to the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (2010), no archaeological sites or
surveys are listed adjacent to or within a one-mile radius of the study area. However,
several studies have been done in the larger vicinity, three of which located cultural
resources.
Site 41TR54 is located east of the study area, just southwest of the Clear Fork. The site
was recorded during in 1948 by Stephenson during an archaeological survey for Lake
Benbrook and consisted of a house foundation, trash scatter and well pipe that dated from
the 1930s to pre 1954 (Stephenson 1948).
AR Consultants (Skinner and Kent 1998) conducted an archaeological survey of 204
acres on both sides of Dutch Branch for a golf course northeast of the survey area. Two
historic sites, 41TR165 and 41TR166, were recorded. Site 41TR165 consists of a house
foundation with a collapsed chimney. Associated with the house foundation were a root
cellar, a possible smoke house, four rock features and a trash scatter. Site 41TR166
consists of a windmill, a stone-walled water tank, a stone walled watering trough and
rectangular concrete box that once contained a float for water control. No evidence of
foundation stones, a cistern, root cellar or features were found. Both locations are shown
on Sam Street’s 1893 map of Tarrant County.
In the fall of 2007 AR Consultants, Inc.(Todd 2007) conducted an archaeological survey
of two well locations within in a pad site located 1.5 miles to the northwest. No
prehistoric or historic sites were recorded during the course of the survey. Similar results
occurred in conjunction with the Devon Cleveland-Federal well pad that is immediately
adjacent to the Courts Federal #1H well pad site (Lang 2007).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
Research Design
Two research questions are in play; they regard the potential for or existence of
prehistoric and historic sites. First, the potential for prehistoric sites within the study area
is relatively low due to the distance of the well pad from the original channel of the Clear
Fork. The only prehistoric site recorded within a reasonable distance of the project area
occurs adjacent to the drainage channel of Rock Creek, further upstream. It is in this
setting that we expect to find a higher potential for prehistoric resources. Testing within
the project area will bolster the evidence pool required to either support or modify models
of settlement patterns in the region. Though it is not expected that prehistoric sites will
be encountered at this location, there still remains a capacity for their existence. Here,
prehistoric cultural resources may be found in limited, isolated finds or as small
campsites on the ridge above drainage valleys. It is expected that sites in these upland
setting will occur at far lower densities, with a narrower range of site types.
The second question addresses historic site potential in the region. There is potential for
historic sites since the region has been occupied and utilized by European Settlers.
Previous investigations attest to this potential. Based on numerous records of historic
sites, it is expected that, in this area, they most commonly occur near old transportation
routes. Most of the historic sites recorded in the region are farmsteads, homesteads,
cemeteries, and artifact scatters located in uplands similar to the setting of this project.
Methodology
In accordance with Section 106 of the NHPA, a BLM cultural resource survey was
conducted for the Lake Benbrook well pad study area. The Area of Potential Effect
(APE) surveyed is 15.705 acres. The study area for the well pad is 11.74 acres. The
entire study area was walked by a two-person crew using parallel transects spaced 15-20
meters apart. Shovel testing was conducted following the standards recommended by the
Texas Historical Commission (n.d.). Shovel tests were excavated until the clay B horizon
was encountered. Loose soils were screened through ¼ mesh hardware screen. Clay soils
were carefully sorted by hand. If a site was encountered during shovel testing, at least six
additional shovel tests were to have been excavated to delineate the site’s horizontal
boundaries and, if possible, its vertical limits.
Notes were taken about the surface visibility, land disturbances, drainage channels, and
vegetation. Photographs were taken along the route using a Canon PowerShot SD1200 IS
10.0 mega pixel digital camera. Shovel test locations were recorded with a handheld
Garmin GPSmap 76 receiver. Non-diagnostic artifacts were to have been recorded,
sketched and photographed in the field but not collected for curation.

RESULTS
The Results section is divided into three parts. The first part describes the survey area and
the second the survey. Conclusions, the third part, end the chapter. Shovel tests are
described generally in the text and specific information is provided in Table 1.
Study Area:
The study area encompasses a large house immediately east of Stevens Drive (Figure 2).
From the side and back yards of the home the terrain slopes steeply, roughly 20 percent,
toward Lake Benbrook to the east and into small, unnamed tributaries to the north and
south. Elevation ranges from a maximum of 800 feet on the western side, to a minimum
of 752 feet on the eastern edge. The shoreline of the lake is approximately 300 meters
from the study area, while the mentioned tributaries are just over 120 meters distant. The
trapezoidal well pad occupies 11.74 acres, extending east of Stevens Road a maximum of
680 feet (Figure 3). Two lease roads (“A” and “B”) will provide access to the
constructed pad. They begin on Stevens Road, 380 and 240 feet, respectively, from the
northwest and southwest corners of the project area. From the street they trend southeast
approximately 120’ to the pad location. Pipelines “A” and “B” each parallel the north
side of their like-named lease roads for approximately 105’ to 115’. Grasses were the
dominant vegetation, spotted here and there with prickly pear and honey locust saplings.

The home was constructed on the highest point of the property. Given the surrounding
topography, it appears likely that the house plot was built up and leveled, causing
disturbance to the area immediately surrounding it. Several large push piles of brush and
limestone boulders indicate that the area had been cleared prior to the arrival of the
survey crew (Figure 4). Holes in the earth left by the removal of the vegetation and
boulders were occasionally encountered in the study area; some were as deep as 30 to 40
cm. The vegetal coverage before clearing is readily distinguished on the aerial
photograph (Figure 2).

View is to the east.

Survey:
Ground visibility in the study area was generally 10 to 20 percent, though some small
areas, especially along the property fence line, offered 90 percent clear glimpses of the
surface. The entirety of the unit property was walked by the two-person crew using 15 to
20 meter transects. No cultural resources were discovered on the ground surface or noted
in any of the aforementioned depressions left by the vegetation and boulder clearing.

A total of 22 shovel tests (1-11, 13-18, 20-24) were excavated within the well pad and
unit boundary area (Figure 5). Sediments encountered during sub-surface investigation
generally consisted of yellowish clays overlain by dark loamy clays with relatively
consistent hues. Bottom depths of these deposits ranged from 90 cm and 60 cm,
respectively. On occasion, only a thin layer of dark loamy clay covered the bedrock; this
occurred at higher elevations. Solid or decaying bedrock was encountered in every
shovel test between 5 and 90 cm below the ground surface. No cultural materials were
present in any of the shovel tests.

One shovel test was excavated in each of the proposed lease road and pipeline pairs.
Shovel test 12 was excavated to a depth of 45 cm in Lease Road/Pipeline “A.” Here,
dark grayish brown loamy clay was underlain by light yellowish brown clay, with
bedrock appearing at 45 cm. Shovel test 19 in Lease Road/Pipeline “B” contained a thin
layer of very dark grayish brown loamy clay and bedrock at only 5 cm below the surface.
No cultural materials were found in either shovel test.
The general trend appears to be one of deeper sediments further downslope, in stark
contrast to the extremely shallow bedrock near the higher elevation of the house. The
expected yellowish clay subsoil was non-existent at higher elevations. This trend is
likely the result of erosion of the steep terrain in the project area. Figure 6 demonstrates
the degree of slope east of the house. The pad site cross section (Appendix B) indicates
the greater part of construction disturbances, the result of cutting, will occur at the higher
elevations where very little topsoil is present.

Conclusions
No prehistoric or historic cultural resources were located during the pedestrian survey
and shovel testing of Devon Energy Production Company, L.P.’s proposed Benbrook
Master Development Plan. The absence of cultural material in the area can be attributed
to both environmental and historical factors. The well pads’ study area is located in the
uplands, too distant from the original channel of the Clear Fork to expect high site
density. The topographic setting of the study area makes it prone to erosion, which seems
to have removed much of the sediments that may have once contained site deposits.
Construction of the house along with clearing of the area has also contributed to overall
disturbance at the location. If sites were present they would likely have been low-density
and artifacts would have been disturbed, but would still potentially be encountered during
the extensive testing and survey.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No archaeological sites will be affected by the development of the Devon Energy
Company, L.P.’s Benbrook Master Development Plan and its associated lease roads and
pipelines based on the results of the cultural resource survey. Consequently, further
cultural resource investigations are unwarranted. ARC, therefore, requests that the
Bureau of Land Management concur with our conclusions that this project can proceed
without the need for additional cultural resource investigations. If buried cultural
resources are discovered during development, work should immediately cease in that area
and the Bureau of Land Management should be notified.
