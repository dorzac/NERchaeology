ABSTRACT
Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) conducted an archaeological
survey for a proposed waterline in northeast Anderson County and southeast
Henderson County for the Poynor Community Water Supply Corporation (WSC)
located in Poynor, Texas. Jesse Todd was the Project Archaeologist and he
performed the field survey on November 7 and 8 (Antiquities Permit 7073). The
completed waterline will parallel U.S. Highway 175 and will be placed in Texas
Department of Transportation (TxDOT) right-of-way and on private property. The
total length of new waterline will be approximately 4.67 linear miles (8.5 acres)
and 3.75 miles (6.82 acres) will be on private property. The project area was
investigated by a 100% Pedestrian Survey and shovel testing. Sixty-eight shovel
tests were excavated to depths of 16 to 45 centimeters below the ground surface
and no cultural materials were found in the tests or on the surface. Therefore, it is
recommended that construction be allowed to proceed as planned. Copies of the
report are on file at the Texas Historical Commission (THC), Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL), Texas State Library, TxDOT, various libraries and
other research facilities, Poynor Community WSC, and BVRA. The records and
other documents will be curated at TARL.

INTRODUCTION
The Poynor Community WSC in Poynor, Texas proposes to relocate
approximately 4.67 linear miles (24,670 feet) of existing distribution line in Anderson
and Henderson counties (Figure 1). The purpose of this relocation project is due to
a highway widening and reconstruction project along United States Highway 175.
Approximately 3.75 miles of waterline will be installed on private property. The new
line will be 2-6 inches in diameter and placed in a trench 12-18 inches wide and 3
feet deep. The width of the easement will be fifteen feet and the waterline will be in
the center of this easement. The APE was flagged prior to this survey. All stream
crossings and wetland areas will be crossed by directional boring in order to reduce
negative impacts to the environment. Funding will be sought through the TxDOT
State Infrastructure Bank Loan Program. Figures 2-3 depict the APE on the USGS
7.5’ topographic quadrangles La Rue (3195-212) and Poynor (3295-211).
According to the site records and maps at TARL and the maps on the Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (aka Atlas), there are no previously recorded prehistoric or
historic sites within the Area of Potential Effect (APE) and no segments of the APE
have been examined by a professional archaeologist. Historic sites can occur
anywhere on the landscape but no standing structures or cemeteries are depicted
on the topographic quadrangle as being in or near the APE.
Anderson and Henderson counties are located in a part of Texas that
contains numerous prehistoric and historic sites, many of which have been
considered to possess significant research potential. These counties are in an
area once inhabited by the prehistoric and historic Caddo Indians of Northeast
Texas. Many of these sites contain burials and pottery vessels of exceptional
quality. Vandalism of archaeological sites in this area is a serious problem and
the number of intact Caddoan sites is rapidly decreasing. The THC has
requested a cultural resources survey be performed by a professional
archaeologist prior to the relocation of the new waterline. The Poynor
Community WSC retained BVRA to conduct this investigation.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The APE is located within the West Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic
province as defined by Fenneman (1946) and the Austropriarian biotic province
as defined by Blair (1950:98-100). The reader is referred to Volume I of the
Geology of Texas by Sellards et al. (1932) for an in-depth discussion of the
geology of this area. The vast majority of the APE is in Henderson County. The
environmental conditions for the project area are basically the same in both
counties.
Data taken from the Texas Almanac for 1984-1985 (Kingston and Harris
1983) state that the area receives a average of 39-40 inches of annual rainfall.
When combined with a January minimum temperature of 35-37 degrees
Fahrenheit and a July maximum temperature of 94-95 degrees Fahrenheit, a
growing season of 264 days results.
Fauna known to be present within the project area at various times of the
year include fox and gray squirrel, armadillo, raccoon, opossum, cottontail
rabbits, white-tailed deer, coyote, beaver, and feral hogs. Many birds utilize the
site including dove, meadowlark, killdeers, various sparrows, great blue herons,
bluebirds, mockingbirds, and cardinals.
The topography is best defined as an upland setting with elevations that
vary from 270 to 700 feet above mean sea level. Within the general area are
numerous small creeks and unnamed tributaries of creeks (Figure 4). In
Segment A there is an area that has been identified as wetlands (Figure 5). It is
at least 30 meters wide. The depth is unknown because of the amount of
vegetation present and making that determination was not part of the scope of
work for this project.
The soil survey for Henderson County (Hatherly and Mays 1979:1) states
that the eastern half of the county is on the western edge of the East Texas
Timberlands Resource Area. Soils in this area formed under forest vegetation
and are dominantly light colored and sandy and loamy. Forested soils on uplands
are found in about 63% of the county. These are gently sloping to steep soils
that have a sandy or loamy surface layer and loamy or clayey underlying layers.
They are well drained or moderately well drained and are moderately permeable
to very slowly permeable. Most areas of these soils are in pasture or woodland
(Figure 6). That part of the APE in Anderson County has virtually the same soils
as described above.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
The two counties are located in the Northeast Texas Archeological Study
Region of the Eastern Planning Region (Figure 7) as defined by the Department
of Antiquities Protection in Archeology in the Eastern Planning Region, Texas: A
Planning Document (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993). According to their statistics
compiled for 1991, there were 121 sites recorded in Anderson County and 226
sites in Henderson County (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:41). Within the region,
Anderson County was 16th in terms of numbers of sites recorded and Henderson
County was 3rd. At the time of this survey there are 200 recorded sites in
Anderson County and 405 recorded sites in Henderson County.
The Archeological Bibliography for the Northeastern Region of Texas
(Martin 1990) cites 50 references for Anderson County and 77 references for
Henderson County. Although many of these investigations have been small area
surveys, often resulting in negative findings, several major reservoir projects
have been conducted. Some of the major projects in the two counties were
Palestine Reservoir (Anderson et al. 1974), Trinity River Basin (Richner and
Bagot 1978), Blackburn Crossing Reservoir (Johnson 1958, 1961), Tennessee
Colony Lake (Richner 1977, 1982; Richner and Lee 1976, 1977); Forest Grove
Lake (Richner and Lee 1974; Richner 1978). Major overviews of the area
include works by Anderson (1972); Lynott and Richner (1977), Woodall (1972),
and Story, et al. (1990).
According to the planning document by (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:44),
prehistoric occupations in the region cover all time periods from Paleoindian
through Historic Caddoan, circa 9500 B.C. - A.D. 1860. This document is a
comprehensive and well-organized document and is a major source for additional
information regarding the archaeological background for the APE and vicinity.
Numerous prehistoric sites have been recorded along Caddo Creek in
Anderson and Henderson counties and along Caney Branch in Anderson
County. Several of these sites were investigated in the 1930s under the direction
of A. M. Woolsey and A. T. Jackson of The University of Texas at Austin.
Although collections were sometimes curated, site forms and formal reports may
not exist. Most of these sites have been described as Caddoan, and some
contain burials with grave goods. According to the few site forms that are
present, the preferred location for sites appears to be terraces adjacent to
streams. Archaic hunting sites were recorded during the Lake Palestine survey
in 1960s and early 1970s (Anderson 1971). Sites found during this study were
predominantly associated with “streamside locations near relatively fertile soils”
(Anderson 1971:iii).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
There have been several surveys, large and small, conducted in the vicinity
of the current APE. Those surveys and recorded sites closest to the current APE
are discussed below.
In 1970, Keith M. Anderson recorded two prehistoric sites as part of the
Lake Palestine project for the Anthropology Research Center at Southern
Methodist University (SMU). The only information regarding the sites he recorded
is found on the site forms (no report available). The northernmost part of his survey
area appears to touch the south side of U.S. 175. Site 41AN73 is described on the
site form as a scatter of sherds and chips on a terrace overlooking Caddo Creek
about 200 yards to the south. It is plotted at 0.38 kilometers south of U.S. 175 in
Segment B of the current APE. Site 41HE192 is described on the site form as a
small scatter of pitted stones, lithic debris, and sherds on a red clay terrace that the
site forms\ refers to as a possible small camp for hunting and nut collecting. It is
plotted on the Atlas as being 0.08 kilometers south of U.S. 175 in Segment B of the
current APE. Neither site will be affected by the construction plans as described by
the client.
Keith Anderson also recorded 41AN4 as part of the SMU Lake Palestine
project (date not given). He describes it as a small site (15 m x 15 m) on the east
slope of a sand ridge about 3.5 meters high. Pegi Jodry completed a Component
Analysis Form for this site in 1983 and she describes it as an “apparent cemetery
with campsite nearby.” It is located about ½ mile north of Caddo Creek. Its cultural
affiliation is described as Caddo. A. T. Jackson is reported to have made surface
collections at the campsite while excavating the cemetery (no report available).
The exact location of this site is not known. Its centroid is plotted on the Atlas as
being 0.29 kilometers north of U.S. 175 in Segment B of the current APE. Because
of the uncertainty of its location part of this site may extend into the APE.
In 1995, a survey along U.S. 175 (name of firm not found on the Atlas)
recorded prehistoric sites 41HE337 and 41HE338 west of Poynor (Segment A). No
sites were found in Segment B. There are no site forms for these sites and no
report was found. Part of site 41HE337 is located within TxDOT right-of-way on the
south side of U.S. 175. The THC conducted a review of this site and determined
that the portion of this site in the right-of-way is not eligible for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places. Part of site 41HE387 is located within TxDOT right-ofway on the south side of U.S. 175. The THC conducted a review of this site and
determined that the eligibility of the portion of this site in the right-of-way is not
known.

10

Geo-Marine, Inc. (Peukert and Hunt 2003) conducted an impact
evaluation along U.S. 175 from Frankston to Baxter (a distance of 16 miles) in
2003. Several localities within the APE were believed to be very low probability
areas for containing archaeological deposits due to modern disturbances, steep
landforms, and soil erosion and deflation. Therefore, only 6.5 miles of the project
corridor were recommended for intensive archeological survey. In November of
that year, archaeologists from Geo-Marine, Inc. (Tiné 2003) performed an
intensive survey over approximately one-half of the recommended survey area.
The remainder of the area could not be surveyed because of lack of landowner
permission. These unpublished interim survey reports were summarized in the
TxDOT summary report for 2002-2004 (Largent et al. 2005). In November of
2014, following acquisition of the proposed right-of-way by TxDOT, Versar, Inc.
(formerly Geo-Marine, Inc.) began an intensive archeological survey within the
un-surveyed portions of the APE.

11

METHODS
Prior to entering the field the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas was checked
for previously recorded sites in or near the APE. In addition to reports written by
professional archaeologists that document work in the area, three other
documents were reviewed during the planning stages of this project. These are a
planning document by the Department of Antiquities Protection (Kenmotsu and
Perttula 1993, an archeological bibliography for the Northeastern Region of
Texas (Martin 1990), and a statistical overview of prehistoric sites in Texas
(Biesaart et al. 1985). The interested reader is referred to these latter sources
for additional information regarding the prehistory of this area. Other documents
reviewed were the soil surveys for Anderson County (Coffee 1975) and
Henderson County (Hatherly and Mays 1979). The Principal Investigator talked
with Christopher Goodmaster of Versar about his firm’s work currently underway
along U.S. 175.
William E. Moore was the Principal Investigator and Jesse Todd was the
Project Archaeologst who conducted the field survey. This investigation was
carried out on on November 7-8, 2014. Laura F. Moody, P.E. and Roger Smith
met Mr. Todd in the field and gave him a set of engineering maps to use as a
guide for working in the correct area. The APE is in an upland setting and it does
not cross any major drainages. The soils are a mixture of fine sandy loams and
clay. The entire APE was shovel tested with most tests dug at intervals of 100
meters. An archaeologist from Geo-Marine, Inc. told the Project Archaeologist
that his firm had found an early Caddo site in a setting similar to that part of
Segment B north of U.S. 175 and southeast of Elm Street. Based on this
information, the interval between shovel tests was reduced from 100 meters to
75 meters. In addition to shovel testing the entire APE was walked and areas
with good surface exposure were carefully checked for cultural materials. An
example of excellent surface visibility in Segment B is illustrated in
Figure 8.

Shovel Tests were excavated to approximately 30 centimeters below the
ground surface due to the upland setting and lack of a well-developed floodplain.
Some tests were terminated when a natural obstacle such as clay or ground
water made further digging diffcult or not necessary. The excavated soil was
screened using quarter-inch hardware cloth. Soil color was interpreted using a
Munsell Color Chart. All soils in the APE were wet (sometimes saturated) due to
recent thunderstorms in the area. Shovel test data was entered onto a shovel
test log (Appendix I) and later plotted on the topographic quadrangles La Rue
and Poynor (figures 2-3). This project was also documented through field notes
and digital photography Selected photographs of the areas surveyed can be
found in Appendix II. The number of tests excavated exceeded the number
required by the Minimum Survey Standards.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The archival research revealed that no professional investigations have
been conducted within the APE. Prehistoric and historic sites have been
recorded by professional archaeologists and non-professionals. Types of field
surveys performed by professional archaeologists have been carried out in areas
where disturbance will occur due to relatively minor projects such as water lines,
oil and gas activities, highway and bridge construction and maintenance, city
parks, improvements within existing state parks, and large areas where
reservoirs are planned. Sites documented by non-professionals include projects
by local archaeological and historical societies and individuals acting alone.
According to Carolyn Spock (personal communication), there was a dramatic
increase in the number of sites in the area recorded at TARL during the late
1970s and early 1980s. She stated that most of these are believed to represent
TARL numbers being assigned to previously recorded sites by Southern
Methodist University from the Lake Palestine and Trinity River Basin projects.
The current survey covered 100% of the APE through a surface investigation and
shovel testing. No cultural resources were observed and no sites were recorded.
No cemeteries or historic structures were observed at any point along the APE.
A thorough review of previously recorded sites in the area revealed that those
researched were recorded as having cultural deposits of 20 centimeters or less.
Since virtually all of the shovel tests dug for this project met or exceeded that
depth it is unlikely that any significant prehistoric sites were missed. The findings
of this field survey appear to be consistent with those in other nearby areas.
The majority of soils in the APE are sandy loam in various shades of
brown (7.5YR 5/3 and 7.5YR 5/4), dark brown sandy loamy clay (7.5YR 3/2),
very dark gray loamy clay (7.5YR 3/1), dark gray sandy clay (7.5YR 4/1), and
yellowish-red clay (5YR 5/6). The shovel testing encountered shallow soils with
only a few areas where tests were dug to depths greater than 30 centimeters.
Four minor drainages are present within the APE. There was clear running water
in two of the streams, the only water in another stream was ponded, and the final
drainage was dry. In the past these drainages may have been a more
dependable source of water but today they are intermittent streams at best. One
drainage has a channel that is about two meters wide and at least three meters
deep. The size of this channel suggests that it may have contained an active
stream at one time. One area in Segment A has been classified as wetlands.
The topography of the area investigated varied from rolling hills west of
Poynor (Segment A) to long stretches of generally level terrain east of town
(Segment B). The few level areas in Segment A were either fields or locations for
houses. Segment B contained the longest stretches of generally level terrain. In
fact, the area north of 175 was all generally level except possibly the last 100
meters. One portion of this level ground was viewed as a good setting for a
Caddo village, but no cultural materials were found there.

14

RECOMMENDATIONS
No archaeological sites were found during this survey. It is, therefore,
recommended that construction be allowed to proceed as planned by the Poynor
Community WSC without further consultation with the THC. Should the
construction plans change to include a greater area that can be viewed as a likely
setting for a prehistoric site, the THC must be notified in case additional survey by a
professional archaeologist is warranted. Also, if cultural materials are unearthed
during construction all work in the area of the find must stop until the situation can
be evaluated by the THC. This study conformed to the Minimum Survey Standards
as defined by the Archaeology Division of the THC.
