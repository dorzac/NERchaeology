Archeologdcal Investigations of Seven Prelfistoric Sites
along Oso Creek, Nueces County, Texas
D. Gentry Steele and E. R. Mokry, Jr.

ABSTRACT
The survey and examination of surface collections from seven prehistoric archeological sites has yielded further information concerning the Aransas and Rockport assemblages from the Corpus Christi Bay area. In addition, faunal material has provided a
more complete picture of how early inhabitants of the region surrounding Corpus Christi
Bay used a wide range of natural resources garnered from marine, riverine, and coastalprairie habitats.

INTRODUCTION
Prehistoric archeological sites around Corpus Christi Bay and smaller bays
emptying into it contain archeological assemblages previously assignable to either the Archaic Aransas focus or the Late Prehistoric Rockport focus (Campbell
1947, 1952, 1956, 1958, 1960). The purpose of this paper is to expand upon our
knowledge of man’s past exploitation of this part of the Texas coast by reporting
the results of a survey of seven prehistoric archeological sites along Oso Creek,
which empties through Oso Bay into Corpus Christi Bay (Figure 1). The emphasis of the report is on understanding prehistoric man’s adaptation to the region and
his exploitation of the available resources.
Martin (1930), the first archeologist to report on sites from the bay area,
described two shell midden sites located on a peninsula at the junction of Cayo
del Oso and Corpus Christi bays that contained material of both the Aransas and
Rockport assemblages. The larger and more exposed of these sites was remarkable in both the large number of human remains that were eroding from the site
and the large size of the shell midden. However, the artifacts were minimally
described in Martin’s report, and the only reports of the skeletal material were
those of Woodbury and Woodbury (1935), and Woodbury (1937).
The next report on sites near Corpus Christi Bay was Campbell’s (1956) description of five sites from nearby Laguna Madre. One of the five sites, the Indian Island site, was assigned to the Rockport phase; the material from the four
other sites appeared to come from both Archaic and Late Prehistoric occupations. Like Martin’s, Campbell’s report on the Laguna Madre sites provided some
documentation of the maritime orientation of the inhabitants of the area. but it
was mainly concerned with defining the cultural complexes and their spatial dis-

tributions. Corbin’s report (1963) on archeological materials from the northern
shore of Corpus Christi Bay had a similar orientation and, like Campbell’s work,
helped to clarify the manner of utilization of the bay environment by prehistoric
populations.
Story’s report (1968) on a site at Ingleside Cove, an eastward extension of
Corpus Christi Bay, is the most recent and the most extensive report on a prehistoric site from the Corpus Christi Bay area. It is particularly significant because it is the first to make a determined attempt to analyze the ecological adaptations of the inhabitants to the site. The ecological orientation of Story’s report
marks the beginning of a trend among archeologists to try to understand man’s
adaptation to coastal environments. Among Texas archeologists, for instance,
Hester and Hill (1975) stated a similar interest in this research problem for the
southern part of Texas, and Aten (1979) pursued this interest while examining

sites along the upper coast of Texas. Campbell (1960), Corbin (1974), and Hester
(1980) have summarized the archeology of other sites in the area, Hester and
Corbin (1975) have reported on burials from Ingleside Cove, and Mokry (1980)
has described shell artifacts from sites along Oso Bay and Oso Creek.
The major difficulty in furthering our understanding of man’s past utilization
of the Corpus Christi Bay environment is the incredibly rapid rate at which sites
are being destroyed. Both Campbell (1960:150) and Corbin (1963:27) have
drawn attention to this, but the history of one of the sites along Oso Bay, as reported by Martin (1930), most aptly dramatizes the tragic loss of archeological
information that is occurring in that area. On a peninsula at the junction of Oso
and Corpus Christi bays was a site estimated by Martin to be about one kilometer
(0.5 mile) in diameter, covering the entire tip of the peninsula. During the 1860s
the site was covered by brush, and no artifacts had been noticed there by John B.
Dunn, who worked the land at the time. Subsequently, the site was cleared of
brush and the soil began to erode, exposing abundant human skeletal remains.
The erosion was accelerated around 1900 by a storm that, according to Martin
Pearse, who then owned the land, exposed a large number of skeletons. Destruction of the site by erosion, construction, and removal of skeletons and artifacts
has continued intermittently to the present time. Martin described the site in
1929 as littered with cultural debris, structural features identified by him as tepee
sites, and piles of conch shells. Today, little or nothing remains on the surface.
The only reports we have concerning this important site are Martin’s preliminary
report (1930), two reports on the skeletal remains (Woodbury and Woodbury
1935; Woodbury 1937), and a brief discussion of the site by Hester (1980) in his
text on South Texas archeology.
Because of the need to report all of the information that can be salvaged
from the area surrounding Corpus Christi Bay, we present the following notes on
surface collections of seven sites along Oso Creek (Figure 1). The collections
consist of material recovered from intermittent surface surveys by Mokry and
from one survey by Steele and Mokry in July 1980. Formal type designations for
the projectile points and pottery follow Suhm and Jelks (1962) unless otherwise
specified.
SITE 41NU35
Site 41NU35 extends along the southern bank of Oso Creek just upstream
from where the creek widens into Oso Bay (Figure 1). Located on a low bluff
above the tidal fiat, the site is bounded on the north and northeast by the creek
and on the west by an extensive flood plain. The northern perimeter of the buried
site is being exposed now as intermittent wave action erodes the bluff. Because
the surface is protected from erosion by grasses and brush, the southern boundary of the site has not been determined, but, on the basis of the limited area of
exposure along the creek bank, it appears that the site is small and may have been
used only periodically.
Although no diagnostic stone artifacts were collected from the site by the
authors, flint debitage was seen eroding from the bank. A single Matamoros dart
point belonging to a local collector is the only stone artifact from the site. Faunal
remains include unidentifiable fragments of mammal bones, shells of the land
snail Rabdotus sp., and marine shells of the taxa Busycon perversum, Laevicardium robustum, Callista nimbosa, and Mercenaria campechiensis (Table 1).

*Since the sites were not sampled in a systematic fashion, the frequencies of the species are only approximate.
tAll fragments assignable to the genus Busycon, whether or not they
could be assigned specifically to B. perversum, are listed under this
species.
SITE 41NU65
Of the seven sites reported here, 41NU65 is the farthest upstream. Today the
site, near a tributary of Oso Creek, slopes gently and is cut by several shallow
gullies.
While the survey was being conducted, two areas of concentrated debris,
apparently representing different occupational events, Were exposed by deep
plowing. One area, on the western margin of the site, measured some 20 by 30
meters, with many specimens of Rabdotus sp. snail shells, marine shells, lithic
debitage, and dart points identified as Tortugas, Matamoros, Catan, and Ensor
eroding from the surface. The second area was to the east and had a smaller scatter of Rabdotus sp. snail shells, marine shells, baked clay nodules, and Perdiz,
Starr, and Fresno arrow points. Also found in the second area were two potsherds
and a conch shell pendant.
The stone artifacts recovered from 41NU65 also include an unidentified
barbed, expanding-stemmed projectile point, thick oval bifaces, laterally and

distally retouched unifaces, a marginally worked blade fragment, cores with
multiple flake scars and hinge fractures, and sandstone fragments with smoothed
surfaces.
The two small sherds recovered from the site are of hard, compact, sandy
paste with no visible temper. Both exterior and interior surfaces of the sherds are
smooth and are of a uniformly light tan color. Asphaltum adheres to one face of
each sherd. Sherd thickness is 4 to 5 mm.
Shell artifacts found at the site include adzes made from the body whorls of
Busvcon sp., fragments of awls made from the columellae of Busycon sp., a
bead made from Noetia sp., and a fragment of concho or pendant made from the
body whorl of an unidentified species of conch. The pendant apparently was circular and smoothed along the edge, with four shallow pits forming a diamondshaped motif on its inner face. The pendant was found in the area containing the
sherds.
Vertebrate remains recovered from the site include fragments of long bones
of small and medium-sized mammals (such as rodents, rabbits, dogs, and deer),
and fragments of a turtle carapace. Invertebrates include remains of Rhabdotus
sp. , Busycon perversum, Crassostrea virginica, Laevicardium robustum, Callista
nimbosa, Aequipecten irradians, Crepidula fornicata, Fasciolaria lilium, Mercenaria campechiensis, Noetia ponderosa, Rangia cuneata, and Rangia flexuosa
(Table 1).

SITE 41NUI01
Site 41NU101 is about 150 meters inland from the north bank of Oso Creek
and about 1.6 km upstream from 41NU35. Lying on an abandoned terrace, the
site is bounded on the south by the flood plain, and on the east and west by
deeply eroded gullies. The original site appears to have covered an area about 70
meters east to west by 30 meters north to south. Up until 1972 the site was subjected to extensive erosion, and in 1972 and 1973 to deep plowingand extensive
landscaping. Because of these activities little of the site is undisturbed.
Stone artifacts recovered from the site include single specimens of Refugio,
Morhiss, and Ensor dart points (Figure 2, K-M) and two undefined dart points.
One is approximately 38 mm long, 18 mm wide, and 9 mm thick, lozenge
shaped, with straight to slightly convex lateral edges and a base that contracts to
a convex point. The second undefined point is triangular with convex lateral
blade edges and a straight base. The point is 28 mm long, 15 mm wide, and
7 mm thick. Smaller arrow points recovered from the site are Perdiz (Figure 2,
A-E) and Fresno (Figure 2, F-I) points. Thirteen specimens or fragments of
Perdiz points were recovered; all were made from thin flakes characterized by
fine workmanship with unifacial chipping along the lateral edges. Both faces
were modified at distal tips, barbs, and stems. The length of the specimens
ranges between 18 and 28 mm; the width, between 14 and 22 mm; the thickness,
between 3 and 4 mm; and the stem length, between 5 and 11 mm. Eight specimens or fragments of Fresno points were recovered; these range between 7 and
20 mm in length, 13 and 17 mm in width, and 3 and 6 mm in thickness. In addition to these projectile points, the lithic assemblage includes one large bifacially
worked flake (Figure 2, Q), three smaller unifacially worked scrapers (Figure 2,
P) and one small core from which several flakes have been removed.

Pottery fragments recovered from the site include 13 sherds characterized
by hard, compact, sandy paste with burned and unburned bone temper that is
moderate to very coarse in size, with some exposed fragments measuring as
much as 5 mm in length. The sherds vary in color from grayish brown to dark
gray, and the surface finish is generally smooth. Sherd thickness varies from 5 to
8 ram. In addition to these fragments, a single small sherd with hard, compact,
sandy paste and no visible temper was recovered. The sherd is 7 mm thick; the
color varies from tan to pink, and the surfaces are smooth.
Shell artifacts are relatively common in the material recovered from the site.
Two specimens that could be projectile points or blades were recovered. Both are
triangular with straight lateral edges and slightly convex bases; they are 23 and
29 mm long, 10 and 18 mm wide, and 3 mm thick. The blades were probably
made from Callista nimbosa shells, which are of a dense calcareous material
with no observable microstructure. Also recovered were five adzes made from
body whorls of Busycon sp. Triangular to irregular in outline, three of the specimens have steep, bevelled, slightly convex edges. The fourth specimen is similar
in shape, but one edge is bifacially ground to a sharp edge. These adzes range
between 32 and 62 mm in length, between 35 and 57 mm in width, and between
4 and 9 mm in thickness. One artifact is a gouge made from the columella of a
Pleuroploca gigantea (Figure 3, G). Unlike other columella gouges found in the
area, this specimen has an obliquely ground edge on the canal side, which forms
a U-shaped bit. The specimen is 109 mm long, and the diameter of the columella
is 26 mm. Five modified Busycon sp. shells have been recovered from the site;
all are modified by having been broken, cut, or ground along the edge of the body
whorl.
Two bone artifacts recovered from the site are a bone awl (Figure 5, A)
made from the metapodial of a cervid (not Odocoileus), and the perforated canine tooth of a mammal. The tooth, possibly from Canis sp., has a hole in the
root end that was drilled from both the lingual and labial sides of the tooth.
Faunal remains recovered from the site include bones of both small and
medium-sized mammals, fragments of turtle carapace, and otoliths of Sciaenops
ocellata and Pogonia cromis. Marine shells recovered from the site include
Aequipectin irradians, Busycon perversum, Callista nimbosa, Crassostrea virginica, Laevicardium robustum. Mercenaria campechiensis, Murex pomum, and
Pleuroplocagigantea (Table 1).
SITE 41NU102
This site is a little less than 1 km (0~5 miles) downstream, on the same
(northeast) side of the creek as 41NU101, on a sloping terrace, about 40 meters
from the present stream bed. Material has been recovered from the site over an
area about 110 meters east to west by 85 meters north to south. Although no
clearly defined features could be discerned at the site, concentrations of land
snails (predominantly Rabdotus) and separate concentrations of baked clay nodules were found.
Stone artifacts recovered from the site include both large and small projectile points, bifaces, side scrapers, exhausted cores, and flint debitage. The
majority of the 54 large dart points recovered have been identified as Matamoros.
Other forms recognized include Tortugas, Catan, Ensor, and Kent, and 16 small,

thick dart points were found that do not conform to any defined types. The
smaller arrow points include Perdiz, Fresno, and Cameron (Cameron arrow
points have been described and illustrated in MacNeish 1958:74; Mallouf,
Baskin, and Killen 1977:261-262; Hester 1980: 104; and Highley 1980:64).
Shell artifacts recovered from the site include an adz formed from the body
whorl of Busycon, awls and hammers made from the columellae of Busycon
(Figure 3, A-D), and scrapers and blades made from valves of Callista nimbosa
(Figure 4, B).
Bone artifacts recovered from the site include two deer-ulna bone awls, one
cervid bone awl made from a metatarsal, and a fragmentary bone bead.
A large sample of faunal remains was recovered from this site and from site
41NU103, providing a more complete picture of the inhabitants’ utilization of
their resources (Table 2). Remains of the following mammal species have been
recovered: Didelphis virginiana, Odocoileus virginianus, Dico~les tajacu.
Lepus c.f.L. Californicus, Sylvilagus sp. indet., Neotoma c.f.N, micropus, and
Sigmodon hispidus. Remains of two species of snakes and of the following marine fishes have been recovered: Arius felis, Cynoscion arenarius, Cynoscion
nebulosus, Micropogan undulatus, Pogonias cromis, and Sciaenops ocellata.
Marine invertebrates recovered include Busycon sp., Crassostrea virgin(ca,
Laevicardium robustum, Fasciolaria lilium, Callista nimbosa, Mercinaria campechiensis, Murex pomum, and Polinices duplicatus (Table 1).
Two burials have been exposed at the site. The first burial, which was resting on its left side with the skull facing northwest, was exposed in a pasture road.
The legs were drawn up slightly toward the chest, and the arms were drawn toward the face. The individual was an adult, but the sex was undetermined. The
second burial was only partially exposed by deep plowing so the skeleton was
left in situ. From an examination of the partially exposed skeleton it appeared
that that individual also was buried in a flexed position. Sex and age of the individual were not determined.
SITE 41NUI03
Site 41NU103 is about half a kilometer (0.25 mile) downstream from site
41NU102 and is also on the northeast side of the creek. The site is about 100
meters from the present stream bed on an old terrace of the creek overlooking the
meander of a small stream that joins Oso Creek at this point. The stream is obscured by contour plowing and a stock tank. The site appeared to have covered an
area about 165 meters east to west by about 75 meters north to south.
Stone artifacts recovered from the site include specimens of large Matamoros, Catan, Ensor, and Morhiss dart points. One of the Matamoros points has
asphaltum adhering to the base. The smaller arrow points are fewer in number
and include a single Fresno point and a short oval unclassified projectile point. In
addition, the assemblage includes bifaces, side and end scrapers, and exhausted
cores.
Two potsherds have been recovered at 41NU 103 and are characterized by
hard, compact paste with bone and shell temper. Both exteriors and interiors of the
sherds are tan to gray and smooth. Sherd thicknesses are approximately 6 mm.
Bone and shell artifacts also have been recovered from the site. The bone
artifacts include fragments of awls made from the ulnae of cervids (Figure 5, B),

and a singular rectangular fragment of cortical bone with incised lines on one
face. Several artifacts of shell have been recovered and include adzes made from
the body whorls of conchs, awls made from the columellae of Busycon whelks,
valves of Callista nimbosa with flakes removed from the margins of the valves
(Figure 4, A, C, D), and a single small conch columella bead.
In addition to these artifacts, many baked clay nodules and a few burned
caliche nodules have been recovered. Two small bits of asphaltum have also been
recovered from 41NU 103.
In the course of salvaging an exposed burial site in August 1978, a l-metersquare unit and a 2-by-5-ft. unit were excavated to sterile soil. Occupational debris was recovered to a depth of 44 cm, and all excavated material was passed
through quarter-inch screen. The faunal material recovered from this limited salvage excavation, when combined with material recovered from surface surveys

Steele and Mokry--Sites along Oso Creek

of the site, provided the largest faunal sample yet recovered from the seven sites.
Mammalian remains recovered from the site include elements of Didelphis virginiana, Bison bison, Odocoileus virginianus, Dicotyles tajacu, Canis sp. indet.,
Lepus c.f.L, californicus, Sylvilagus, Geomys, Neotoma c.f.N, micropus,
Perognathus c.f.P, hispidus, and Sigmodon hispidus. The remains of other terrestrial vertebrates include birds (possibly a quail and a marsh bird), Rana sp.,
Gopherus berlandieri, Phrynosoma cornutum, and two species of snakes. Marine fishes include Arius felis, Cynoscion arenarius, Qvnoscion nebulosus, Micropogan undulatus, Pogonias cromis, and Sciaenops ocellata. Marine molluscs
recovered include Busycon perversum, Callista nimbosa, Crassostrea virginica,
Crepidula fornicata, Fasciolaria lilium, Laevicardium robustum, Mercenaria
campechiensis, Polinices duplicatus, and Rangia flexuosa (Table 1).
During investigations of the site in August 1978 by Mokry, human skeletal
elements were encountered in the west-central part of the site. Excavation and
salvage of the burial was begun after it was learned that further cultivation of the
site was to occur the following day. Two areas, a l-meter square and a 2-by-5-ft.
unit, were excavated in the vicinity of the surface remains of the skeleton. After
removal of the underlying disturbed soil, the units were excavated in 10-cm levels
until sterile deposit was reached.
The 1-meter unit revealed no human skeletal remains other than those deposited on the surface. The north wall of this unit, however, was profiled and
yielded evidence of three strata. The upper stratum (0 to 32 cm) consisted of a
light gray to gray sandy loam. Contents of this level included land snail shells,
fragments of marine shells, baked clay nodules, and occasional fragments of
nonhuman bones. The second stratum (32 to 44 cm) was a gray to dark gray
compact sandy loam, again containing cultural debris consisting of land snail
shells, fragments of marine shells, fragments of nonhuman bone, and charcoal
specks. The third stratum (below 44 cm) consisted of a culturally sterile, compact, gray-brown to gray-white mottled clay.
The human skeleton was recovered in the adjacent 2-by-5-ft. unit at the level
of 32 cm (top of the second stratum). No evidence of a burial pit was recognized
during the process of excavation. In situ skeletal elements consisted of a fragmentary left femur, fragments of a fibula and radius, and two incisors. From the
excavation it could be determined that, during deep plowing of the field, the
turnover plow had cut just above the long bones, removing the skull and mandible
and depositing these elements on the surface. The completely disarticulated
nature of the elements, together with the lack of pelvic, vertebrae, or rib elements, suggests a bundle burial, but the disturbed condition of the feature makes
it difficult to confirm this suspicion. The individual was apparently an adult, but
the sex could not be determined.
SITE 41NU104

This site is about half a kilometer (0.25 mile) downstream from 41NU103
and is on the northeast side of the creek. The site lies on an inactive clay dune,
240 meters from the present bed of Oso Creek. An extensive flood plain separates the site from the creek.
Only a few artifacts and little occupational debris have been exposed on the
surface of the site. Artifacts recovered consist of a single triangular shell pro-

jectile point or blade, a Perdiz arrow point, an adz made from the body whorl of
a Busycon shell (Figure 4, E), a small end scraper, distal fragments of projectile
points, and a biface. Other recovered material consists of baked clay nodules and
flake debitage.
Occupational debris is scattered sparsely over the site and consists of the
remains of Rabdotus, Callista nimbosa, Crassostrea virginica, Mercenaria
campechiensis, Busycon perversum, Laevicardium robustum, Noetia ponderosa,
and skeletal elements of small and medium-sized vertebrates.
SITE 41NU169
This site also is on the northeast side of Oso Creek, lying midway between
sites 41NU103 and 41NU104. The site is on the east bank of the same meander
stream that 41NU103 overlooks, and it occupies the same terrace of Oso Creek.
The site area appears to extend for about 200 meters north-south and about
150 meters east-west.
Stone artifacts from the site include large Tortugas, Matamoros, Ensor,
Morhiss, and Kent dart points, and smaller Fresno and Perdiz arrow points (Figure 6). In addition, bifaces, end and side scrapers, and exhausted cores have
been found. Included in the assemblage is one large bifacially worked knife with
an extensively ground distal edge (Figure 6, K).
Two small sherds from the site have hard, compact, sandy paste with no
visible temper. Paste color varies from gray to tan, and the exterior surfaces are
smooth. The interior surfaces of both sherds are grooved or scored by what may
have been a marine shell, and both sherds have orange to red slip on both exterior
and interior surfaces.
Shell artifacts include adzes made from the body whorls of Busycon, an
extensively smoothed columella from Busycon (Figure 3, E), and a single shell
bead from a bivalve (possibly Noetia).
Faunal remains have not been collected extensively at this site, but specimens
of the following molluscs have been recovered: Busycon perversum, Callista nimbosa, Crassostrea virginica, Fasciolaria lilium, Laevicardium robustum, Mercenaria campechiensis, Pleuroploca gigantea, and Thais haemastoma.
Human bone occurs in two areas of the site. Three small skull fragments
were collected along the terrace bank after a heavy rain, but no other skeletal
elements were recovered from the area. A fragment of a human radius was recovered near the stream meander. The recovered skeletal material was extremely
fragmentary.
DISCUSSION
All of the lithic material recovered from the seven sites (Table 3) fits the
descriptions of material assigned to the Aransas and Rockport assemblages by
previous researchers (Campbell 1960; Corbin 1974; Story 1968); therefore, detailed descriptions of the material will not be presented here. A major point the
authors wish to make, however, concerns the diversity of the recoVered lithic material. A wide variety of dart points and arrow points are contained in each site
assemblage. Unfortunately, since stratigraphic and spatial provenience of the
material is not available, we can make no inferences as to the meaning of this
diversity. Story (1968) notes a similar diversity of forms from the nearby Ingleside Cove site.

Note: Type designations follow Suhm and Jelks (1962), Hester (1980),
and Highley (1980).
Prehistoric inhabitants made extensive use of the area from the confluence
of Oso and Corpus Christi bays upstream for several kilometers. Hester (1980)
notes that the greatest concentration of burials known for South Texas, including
several sites with large cemeteries, occurs along the lower reaches of Oso Creek.
Most of these sites appear to represent small, temporary occupations, but at least
one site at the confluence of Oso and Corpus Christi bays was quite extensive and
appeared to be a favored site, which was reoccupied through the centuries. Two
factors can probably account for the high concentration of sites along Oso Creek
and Oso Bay. Along this part of the Texas coastline, fresh water is a limited resource, and the creek and its tributaries are a major source of fresh water. Although under the cooler, moister conditions of the past, fresh water may have
been more abundant, even then the creek would have been one of the most constant sources of fresh water. This reason alone may account for the concentration
of sites along the waterway. Additionally, the area provided riverine and marine
resources that were extensively exploited by the inhabitants.
From the limited material recovered from surface scatters alone, it can be
seen that marine invertebrates, particularly molluscs, were collected both for
food and as a source of materials for tools and ornaments. The soft tissue of all
the molluscs found in the sites could have been eaten. The presence of relatively
large numbers of the southern quahog Mercenaria campechiensis and the eastern
oyster Crassostrea virginica clearly indicate that these two species were taken
primarily for food, since few if any of these shells were modified as tools. The
lightning whelk Busycon perversum and the sunray Venus Callista nimbosa were
probably taken as food resources as well, but since most of these shells evidenced
human modification, their value as food resources is not as unequivocally
documented.

In addition to gathering invertebrates from the bays and creek, the inhabitants also harvested a variety of fish. The sea catfish, sand seatrout, spotted seatrout, Atlantic croaker, black drum, and red drum were all recovered from sites
41NU102 and 41NU103. since systematic collecting has not been done on the
sites, the frequencies of the species recovered can only be taken as a rough approximation of the importance of the species to the inhabitants, but it appears
that black drum and spotted seatrout were the two most commonly utilized of the
species recovered. Smaller species of fish may also have been commonly eaten,
but, because of the small size of their skeletal remains, they may have been
missed during collecting.
Analysis of the faunal remains from these seven sites also indicates a broad
spectrum of terrestrial food resources. If the remains from sites 41NU102 and
41NU103 are typical of sites along the creek and Oso Bay, food resources included all classes and sizes of vertebrates, and there is no.evidence that any one
food resource was favored to the exclusion of others.
Two taxa whose remains were recovered warrant comment. One is Rabdotus, the land snail. Rabdotus shells were plentiful in all sites examined, and, in
fact, the areal extent of’ the sites could be fairly accurately determined on the
presence of Rabdotus shells alone. In the past there has been a question as to
whether the shells were food refuse of the inhabitants, or whether the snails were
attracted to the rich organic remains of the soils that resulted from human habitation of the area (Clark 1973, 1976; Hester and Hill 1975). The authors’ impression is that the shells represent food refuse.
Another taxon whose presence is particularly noteworthy is the collared
peccary, or javelina. Lundelius (1974), in discussing faunal changes in North
America, notes that collared peccary, armadillo, rock squirrel, and ringtail have
not been recovered from sites dating from the late Pleistocene and early Holocene. Since all of these species are adapted to warm or xeric conditions, their
absence from faunal collections is evidence that the warm, dry conditions of the
Southwest are a relatively recent climatic trend. This climatic interpretation is
also supported by the occurrence of remains of many cold- and cool-summeradapted species in southwestern sites that are no longer suitable habitats for such
species. The presence of the remains of collared peccary in the faunal collections
from 41NU102 and 41NU103 then may be of significance. An early presence of
the species in the region has been suggested by remains recovered from 41MC222
(Hall et al. 1982) and from remains identified by Steele from Site 41LK201.
Consequently, the peccary could have been present as early as 2,000 years ago
and may have been one of the first xeric-adapted immigrants to the area.
Another observation that became apparent during examination of.the assemblages from the seven sites was the extensive use the inhabitants made of
marine shell for making tools and ornaments. Adzes, awls, gouges, scrapers,
blades, beads, hammers, and possibly net weights all were made from marine
shell (Table 4). Additionally, it is probable that bivalves such as the giant Atlantic
cockle (Laevicardium robustum) were used as containers, although there was no
direct evidence of this in the form of wear patterns on recovered specimens. It is
also apparent that the inhabitants were selecting specific kinds of shells for specific tools. Sunray Venus shells were commonly found to have had flakes removed, much as flakes are removed from chert blanks in the manufacture of

projectile points. In some instances the umbo of the Venus shell was left intact so
the back part of the tool was smooth. In other examples the valve had been
reduced to fragments, and these fragments in turn were flaked on all sides
to produce blades or points. A Florida horse conch (Pleuroploca gigantea)
columella was made into what appeared to be a small adz. Shell beads made from
valves of the ark (Noetia sp. indet.) were recovered from two sites. The lightning
whelk (Busycon) provided material for the manufacture of a variety of tools and
ornaments. Fragments removed from body whorls of this species were commonly fashioned into adzes (Mokry 1980). The columellae were frequently made
into drills, and the columellae with the spires attached were commonly used as
hammers.
The use of shell as material for tools is typical of prehistoric inhabitants
along the entire Gulf of Mexico, where there are few ready sources of rock, so in
this respect the shell artifacts from Oso Creek sites are what one would expect to
find in most Gulf Coast sites. What does seem noteworthy is that there are more
tools than ornaments among these artifacts. For example, only one bead and a
fragment of a concho or pendant were recovered from 41NU65, and only one
bead (possibly from a specimen of Noetia sp.) was recovered from 41NU169.
Compared to sites of the Brownsville complex to the south, which are noted for
their shell industry (Collins, Hester, and Weir 1969; Hester 1969, 1980), and
sites such as Morhiss (41VT1) of Victoria County to the east, the material assemblages from the Oso Bay region are remarkably limited in the variety and
frequency of shell ornaments. In this way the shell industry strongly corroborates
historic descriptions of the meager material possessions of the Coahuiltecans and
Karankawans, who were local inhabitants at the time of Spanish contact.

The presence of skeletal remains in three of the seven sites raises questions
about burial customs in the region. In discussing the distribution of burials along
Oso Creek, Hester (1980) has already mentioned that the clay dunes over!ooking
the bay and the creek were preferred areas for both habitation and cemeteries,
with the cemeteries at the edge of, or separate from, habitation sites. Along Oso
Creek, however, occupation sites are common and very close together. When a
burial is encountered, it is difficult to confirm the individual’s association with a
particular habitation site or outlying cemetery. For this reason, the presence of
burials in these habitation sites cannot easily be used to infer patterns of burial
location.
Another problem that needs addressing pertains to the size of the prehistoric
populations in the Oso Bay and Oso Creek area, but this is one of the more difficult questions to address archeologically, for estimates of population size or density must invariably draw upon a wide range of evidence. The Oso Creek sites all
appeared to be relatively small in area, and without large masses of accumulated
shell or cultural debris. In fact, along Oso Creek and Oso Bay only one really
large accumulation of shell and cultura! debris has been reported: the previously
discussed site at the junction of the Oso and Corpus Christi bays (Martin 1930).
The majority of the sites along the creek and surrounding bay shore appear to
have been encampments occupied by small numbers of people for short per.iods
of time. If this is true, these sites reflect the same tifeways and settlement
patterns that were described in the early historical accounts for both the Coahuiltecans and the Karankawans--groups consisting of nomadic family units or
small bands moving from place to place with the seasons as different food resources became available (Newcomb 1961).
Such a life-style has now been well documented for the majority of hunters
and gatherers studied during historic times, but what has been less well established are the environmental and cultural factors that have allowed such populations to vary in size and density. To attempt to review and relate all of the literature on the population density of hunters and gatherers to the Texas coastal
populations would not be appropriate here, but a few ideas should be noted.
There is probably more ethnographic information available about the hunters and
gatherers that have existed in Australia during historic times than there is about
any others, and Birdsell (1953), in examining their population structures, found
a significant correlation between size of tribal area and amount of annual rainfall
in their territories, the large tribal areas occurring in areas of lesser rainfall.
Birdsell felt that the number of individuals within tribes was relatively constant,
so population density was also inversely correlated with rainfall. He noted exceptions to this generalization that are pertinent to our discussion of populations
of Indians along the Texas coast. One exception was that Australian tribes along
a permanent water source had the smallest tribal areas and highest population
densities, densities Birdsell felt could be maintained because of the riverine food
resouces available to these tribes. The other exception concerned coastal tribes,
for whom Birdsell proposed (1953:t89) that the availability of marine resources
made smaller tribal areas and higher population densities possible.
Three environmental factors could affect human population densities if
Birdsell’s Australian model is applicable to Texas hunters and gatherers. The first
is the Gulf of Mexico; the second is a rainfall gradient that decreases from south-

306

east to northwest; and the third is the gradual decrease in the number of creeks
and rivers from east to west. Following Birdsell’s model, all three of these suggest
that the highest population densities for hunters and gatherers in Texas would be
in the southeastern part of the state (that number would decrease to the north and
west), and the highest population densities would be expected along the coast.
These trends certainly are apparent when we examine today’s population distribution in Texas (Arbingast et al. 1976:60-61), but the difficulty is in finding
archeological evidence to support such hypotheses about past population densities and distributions. We have no evidence from the seven sites along Oso Creek
to help us answer this question, but we can emphasize that only through the study
of rapidly disappearing sites will we find an answer.
The authors could end with the observation that far more questions have
been raised than answered. Questions of particular concern are those of adaptations to, and manners of exploitation of, the Coastal Bend of Texas by these early
inhabitants. Were the band sizes always as smal! as the ethnographic sources indicate? Werd most sites occupied only for short periods of time, and, if so, were
they occupied only on a seasonal basis’? Were there seasonal periods when available food or other resources permitted greater concentrations of people, and can
we find archeological evidence of this? Were there differences in exploitation of
resources between the peoples of the Aransas complex and the Rockport focus,
and will we be able to find evidence of this difference in the archeological
record? It is more than likely that these issues will be clarified only through
problem-oriented excavations of selected sites, but what must be kept in mind is
that undisturbed sites of the kind that are needed are not plentiful, and they
should be excavated only when conditions allow excavators enough time to work
with extremely great care.
