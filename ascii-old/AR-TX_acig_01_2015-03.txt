Abstract
On May 12, 2015, aci consulting staff archeologists conducted an intensive archeological
survey adjacent to the northeast corner of the Smeltertown Cemetery in El Paso, Texas as
part of a transportation project. The overall transportation project consists of the
construction of the Loop 375 Border Highway, West Extension, a 14.5-km- (9-mi-) long
linear construction project (highway), of which approximately 11.4 km (~7.1 mi) is to be a
controlled-access facility (toll way). The proposed highway right-of-way will be adjacent
to the cemetery. This investigation is pursuant to the Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC
26) as well as Texas Health and Safety Code (Chapter 711). The overall investigation
included mechanical scraping, shovel testing, photography, detailed soil profiling, data
analysis, and report preparation in accordance with Texas Historical Commission (THC)
and Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) standards.
Due to safety constraints and previously disturbed areas, the mechanical scraping was
limited to a 0.02 acre (0.008 hectare) area on the east side of the project area. Excavations
reached about 1.2 m (4 ft) into sterile gravel and no unmarked burials were encountered.
Two hand excavated shovel tests were placed on the north side of the fence where
mechanical testing was unable to be performed and no evidence of burials were observed.
Based on these results, no further archeological work is recommended. However, if human
remains are discovered during the course of construction near the Smeltertown Cemetery,
especially during the removal of the wooden utility poles and guy lines for utility
relocation purposes, the developer will stop activities within 50 feet of the discovery,
secure the area, and alert the appropriate authorities.
Records from this investigation will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory. Ann M. Scott served as Principal Investigator and Julie Shipp served as Project
Archeologist and Geoarcheologist on this project.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
On May 12, 2015, archeologists from aci consulting conducted an intensive archeological
survey adjacent to the northeast corner of the Smeltertown Cemetery in El Paso, Texas as
part of a transportation project. The overall transportation project consists of the
construction of the Loop 375 Border Highway, West Extension, a 14.5-km- (9-mi-) long
linear construction project (highway), of which approximately 11.4 km (~7.1 mi) is to be
a controlled-access facility (toll way). The project is intended to provide an alternative
route to Interstate Highway 10 (IH 10) and is designed to address needed improvements
to system capacity and reliability as well as regional system linkage for the City of El
Paso, Texas. The project will encompass an area of approximately 200 acres (81
hectares) and is to comprise 4 lanes (two in each direction), within a 36.6-m- (120-ft-)
wide right-of-way (ROW), divided by a concrete traffic barrier. It will also provide
multiple controlled access points to and from other state and local roadways. The
highway will be constructed adjacent to the Smeltertown Cemetery at the northeast
corner and will pass slightly offset diagonal to the cemetery approximately 7.6 m (25 ft)
from the northeast corner of the fence.
The archeological work primarily consisted of mechanical scraping adjacent to the
cemetery fence line. The Area of Potential Effects (APE) for the project was to consist of
a 7.6-m-by-15.2-m (25-ft-by-50-ft) area extending 7.6 m (25 ft) east from of the existing
fence line for approximately 15.2 m (50 ft) south of the corner of the cemetery as well as
a small area to the north and west of the top corner of the cemetery fence for about 6.1 m
(20 ft) north and west (Figures 1 and 2). This equals approximately .05 acre (0.02
hectares) overall. However, because of previous disturbance from an existing 48 inch
waterline, wooden utility poles and associated guy lines as well as safety issues with the
heavy machinery near the poles and lines, the mechanical scraping was limited to a 0.02
acre (0.008 hectares) area on the east side of the APE. The overall investigation includes
pedestrian survey, shovel testing, mechanical scraping, photography, detailed soil
profiling, data analysis, and report preparation in accordance with THC and Council of
Texas Archeologists (CTA) standards. This investigation is pursuant to the Texas
Administrative Code (13 TAC 26) as well as Texas Health and Safety Code (Chapter
711).

Proposed Project Area

2.0 ENIVRONEMTNAL SETTING
2.1
Physiography
The project area is located in the Basin and Range region of west Texas. The topography
is hilly with some peaks as high as 8,000 ft. The hills slope west toward the Rio Grande
valley at the toe slopes of the Franklin Mountains, which is where the current project is
located. It is a semi-arid region, with vegetation ranging from grassland in the basins to
an oak-pine-juniper mix in the mountains (Wermund 1996).
2.2
Soils and Geology
The surface geology at the project location is mapped as intrusive igneous rocks (Barnes
1974). The soil is mapped as Delnorte-Canutio association, hilly. Delnorte-Canutio soil
forms within the igneous gravels of hilly upland and fan piedmonts. A typical profile of
Delnorte gravelly loam is A-Bkk-Bkkm-BCk, with the unconsolidated bedrock at
approximately 20 to 80 in below ground surface. Canutio series soils are similar, with a
shallower BCk1 horizon at approximately 11 in (NRCS 2015). The ground surface
outside of the fence line of the cemetery has been disturbed from the construction of IH
10, a transmission line (utility poles), wastewater line, and other activities associated with
the urbanization of El Paso, but there is the possibility of intact soil within the APE.
2.3
Brief Historic Context of Smeltertown Cemetery
Smeltertown is the name given to the industrial area surrounding the American Smelting
and Refining Company (ASARCO) copper and lead smelter in El Paso, Texas.
Smeltertown began to develop in the 1880s as smelter employees, most of them from
Mexico, began building homes near their workplace. In 1891 a church was built, and a
school followed later. The 1938 population was estimated at 2,500 people, virtually all of
whom lived in poverty in hand-built adobe dwellings with dirt floors. The town was
evacuated in the early 1970s due to high levels of lead contamination in the soil. Many
members of the community were found to have lead poisoning, yet they fought to remain
in the homes their families had occupied for generations (Kohout 2010).
The Smeltertown cemetery gates proclaim the cemeteryâs use between 1882 and 1970.
The cemetery boundaries were expanded in 1901, 1912, 1917, 1931, and 1969 at which
time the land related to the cemetery was deeded to the Catholic Diocese of El Paso and a
fenced boundary was established (Malcolm Pirnie, Inc. 2013). In 2013 the fence was
realigned to match the property boundary (Malcolm Pirnie, Inc. 2013). The cemetery,
also known as La Calavera (âthe skullâ), is the resting place of many smelter workers
and their family members. The cemetery is open for visitation by surviving family
members. The cemetery stands as a monument to the largely Hispanic community of
smelter workers that defined this portion of El Paso for almost a century.

3.0 PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
A review of the THC Sites Atlas shows that seven archeological investigations have been
conducted within 1 km (3,281 ft) of the proposed ROW, although only one of the
investigations resulted in the recording of a new archeological site near the cemetery
(Figure 4). In 2004 a survey was conducted northeast of the cemetery for the Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ); no Texas Antiquities Code (TAC)
permit is associated with this investigation. In 2006 TRC conducted a survey under
Permit #3971 on behalf of El Paso Water Utilities (Perez and Flowers 2006). This survey
covered three areas within 1 km (3,281 ft) of the proposed ROW. The section nearest the
cemetery crosses approximately 115 m (377 ft) east of the northeastern corner of the
cemetery. A 2009 survey by William Self Associates for the International Boundary and
Water Commission (IBWC) crossed approximately 0.5 km (1,640 ft) to the west of the
cemetery (Stinchcomb et al. 2009). No TAC permit is associated with this investigation.
Later in 2012 and in 2013 under Permit #6245, Arcadis conducted archeological
investigations for USACE and El Paso Water Utility Public Service. This survey also
crossed almost immediately adjacent to the northeast corner of the cemetery and then
traveled southwest. The Arcadis survey resulted in the recording of site 41EP7014, which
is approximately 540 m (1,772 ft) southwest of the cemetery at its closest point. This site
represents a portion of the American Canal and was recommended as eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP.
In early 2012, Ecosystem Management conducted survey and testing of a small polygonal
area immediately northeast of the cemetery under TAC Permit #6116 for TxDOT to
detect any unmarked burials (Hayden et al. 2012). In December of 2012, survey and
backhoe trenching were conducted by Malcolm Pirnie, Inc. for the Texas Custodial Trust
and TxDOT (Malcon Pirnie, Inc. 2013). This investigation covered buffers around the
northeast and southwest corners of the cemetery with the purpose of identifying any
possible graves or associated materials outside the marked cemetery fence line. No TAC
permit is associated with this project. None of previous investigations adjacent to
Smeltertown Cemetery encountered cultural materials or human remains (Malcom Pirnie
et al. 2013).
Based on discussions with the THC, it was determined that more mechanical scraping
near the northeast corner of the cemetery fence line that had not been adequately covered
in the previous work would be necessary to decrease the potential for encountering
unmarked burials during the construction of the Loop 375 Border Highway, West
Extension.

4.0 METHOD OF INVESTIGATION
4.1
Subsurface Investigation
The marked boundaries of historic-age cemeteries are often inaccurate due to
abandonment, the removal of headstones, or the construction of roadways, structures, or
other developments. Since the ROW of the new highway was going to include the area
adjacent to the northeast corner of the Smeltertown Cemetery fence line, it was proposed
to mechanically scrape a .053-acre (.02-hectare) area around the northeast corner of
Smeltertown Cemetery in an attempt to locate any unmarked burials outside of the fence
line.
It was anticipated that existing utility poles within the APE may limit the amount of area
that could be scraped. It was originally proposed that an approximate 215-sq-m (2313.8Â­
sq-ft) area would be scraped, 7.6 m (25 ft) out from the fence line to the east and about
15.2 m (50 ft) south from the corner along with a small area at the north side of the fence
corner (Figure 5). It was determined in the field that a portion of proposed area would not
be able to be scraped for safety reasons, as most of the ground surface on the northeast
corner was in between the utility poles and the sets of guy line cables on either side of the
poles. Two deep shovel tests were excavated adjacent to the northern fence line in lieu of
trenching. The accessible area that could be mechanically scraped was approximately
0.02 acre (0.008 hectares) or 80 square meters (95 square yards). The depth of the
investigation was approximately 1.2 m (4 ft).
The mechanical scraping was conducted using the larger flat edge bucket on the backhoe.
Two archeologists monitored the scraping. The floors were cleaned and observed for
anomalies approximately every 10 centimeters (4 in). In addition to monitoring for
human remains, aci consulting archeologists were also looking for the presence of grave
shafts and artifacts associated with a burial such as clothing, personal items, and funerary
materials.
4.2
Data Collection
The scraped area was photographed and the boundaries of the scraped area and the
locations of the shovel tests recorded with a Trimble GeoXH. The wall of the scraped
area adjacent to the cemetery was profiled in detail. The associated paperwork for the
project includes the wall profile, a shovel test log, a photograph log, and a daily journal.

4.3
Unanticipated Discoveries Plan
Although the plan was not utilized, aci consulting had an Unanticipated Discoveries Plan
in the event that human remains or associated funerary objects were encountered during
the mechanical scraping. Excavation activities would have been immediately halted. The
excavated area would be protected while archeologists consulted with an osteologist, if
necessary, to determine whether the remains are human. If it was confirmed that a burial
had been encountered, aci consulting would have notified ASARCO, City of El Paso
authorities, the THC, and the Joint Venture (developer) of the discovery. aci consulting

and the Texas Penal Code (Title 7, Chapter 31; Title 9, Chapter 42, Section 42.08). The
site would remain protected until all parties involved had agreed to an appropriate plan of
action, which may have involved reburial and avoidance or removal and relocation.
These actions would be performed in conjunction with guidance from THC. The
principles of this plan continue to be in place for the discovery of any future human
remains for the entire construction project.

5.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATION
Mechanical scraping and pedestrian survey was conducted adjacent to the northeast
corner of Smeltertown Cemetery on May 12, 2015. Prior to initiating the investigation the
entire APE was walked over and pin flags were placed to indicate the APE on the ground
and for the safety foreman to understand the area of investigation (Figure 6). As
previously mentioned some of the APE contained utility poles and guy line cables and the
safety foreman deemed it unsafe to put the backhoe under the guy lines. The angle of
approach was changed to make safer to excavate and the scraping was done
perpendicular to the fence instead of paralleling the fence.

Figure 6. Proposed area of excavation marked by pin flags, utility poles and guy
lines in the background, facing north.
The fully scraped area was approximately 0.02 acre (0.008 hectares) or 80 square meters
(95 square yards) (Figures 7). In addition to the scraped area two shovel tests were placed
on the north side of the fence adjacent to the cemetery that were excavated approximately
1 meter (3.2 feet) below surface. Figures 8, 9, and 10 show the work that was conducted
at the site.

encountered at 50 centimeters (19 inches) below surface and continued to a depth of 120
centimeters (47 inches) below surface, where the excavation was terminated (Table 1)
(Figure 11). No cultural material was located during the excavation; therefore, no burials
were located adjacent to the cemetery fence line in the areas that were safe to excavate.

6.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
In advance of construction of the Loop 375 Border Highway, West Extension in El Paso,
Texas, archeologists from aci consulting conducted mechanical scarping adjacent to the
northeast corner of the Smeltertown Cemetery where the transportation ROW will be
nearest the fence line. This work was conducted in compliance with Texas Administrative
Code (13 TAC 26) as well as Texas Health and Safety Code (Chapter 711). No unmarked
burials were located during the course of the investigation.
Based on these results, no further archeological work is recommended. It must be noted
that no level of survey intensity can be guaranteed to locate all cultural features within a
project area. Therefore, if human remains are discovered during the course of
construction near the Smeltertown Cemetery, especially during the removal of the
wooden utility poles and guy line cables for relocation purposes, the Abrahms-Keiwit
Joint Venture will stop activities within 50 feet of the discovery, secure the area, and alert
the appropriate authorities as described in the Unanticipated Discoveries Plan.
