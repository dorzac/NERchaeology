Wh e’s Mound (41BU17):
A Study in the Pretfistory of Burleson County, Texas
Bradley F. Bowman

ABSTRACT
Winnie’s Mound (41BU17) is a relict levee of the Brazos River constituting a slightly raised landform in the broad flood plain. Test excavations
conducted in 1983 combined with extensive surface collecting indicate a
long period of prehistoric use for this locality, from Paleo-Indian to Late
Prehistoric times. The excavations revealed the existence of a small, spatiallyconfined, prehistoric cemetery containing burials from two different time
periods. Evidence for prehistoric structures was also found. Diagnostic
lithic artifacts in the sample show a mixing of central and eastern Texas
styles suggesting that the Brazos River may have been a traditional boundary
between two geographically-distinct populations.

INTRODUCTION
The Winnie’s Mound Site (41BU17) has been heavily surface hunted by
local collectors for many years. Its archeological importance was evident by the
diverse point types and human remains collected on the surface over a very large
area showing signs of cultural debris. The possibility of site destruction dictated
a need to excavate a test unit to see if any cultural material could be found intact.
At a depth of 40 cm, a flexed burial (6, Figure 7), was located. At that time, the
author contacted Dr. Harry Shafer of Texas A&M University who offered his assistance and encouragement to continue excavations during the summer and fall
of 1983.
A small, prehistoric cemetery containing flexed and secondary interments
in a deep midden deposit was discovered in the following months. The excavated
portion of the site was disturbed by many years of cultivation and by a road construction project during World War II when a large amount of earth was removed
from the cemetery for use as fill (David Wilson, personal communication). The
destruction of the uppermost layers of the cemetery would explain the complete
lack of Toyah Phase and historic materials found in most other areas of the site.
Winnie’s Mound is located on an ancient river terrace in the river flood plain

approximately two km west of the present day Brazos River in Burleson County,
Texas, and is the highest point for three km in any direction. The site appears to
have been occupied at least seasonally from Paleo-Indian through Late Prehistoric times. At present it is a corn field with an elevation of 73 meters
(240 feet) above mean sea level.

NATURAL SETTING
The site is situated on an elevated ancient river terrace in close proximity to
a relict river channel of the Brazos River. Cultural debris is scattered over an area
of approximately 120,000 square meters. A broad flood plain extends southwest
from the site for 5.3 km to a high valley wall, which rises rapidly up to an elevation of over 91 meters (300 feet), and to the northeast two km to the present day
Brazos River, which is the easternmost border of Burleson County. Sloughs and
bayous still exist in the general area, evidence of the ancient river’s course. The
majority of the flood plain is under cultivation and the uplands are heavily
wooded. Thirty-six inches of rain fall on the area annually. Major fauna includes
whitetail deer (Odocoileus virginianus), bobcat (Lynx rufus), jackrabbit (Lepus
californicus), opossum ( Didelphis marsupialis), and raccoon ( Procyon lotor).
Flora in the uplands consists of a post oak (Quercus stellata) canopy with an
understory of yaupon (flex vomitoria), hawthorn (Crataegus sp.), willow (Salix
nigra), sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), and green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), which are the dominant species along the creeks and rivers.

EXCAVATION PROCEDURE
The numerous human remains scattered on the surface were a positive factor in locating the cemetery. At the onset, it appeared to be a large, dark, sandy
circle surrounded by red clay but this later proved to be an ancient slough or
depression, which had filled in by an accumulating midden deposit.
Once a datum point had been established, units were laid out in 2 by 2 meter
squares. The total excavated area encompassed 13 units or 46 square meters (Figure 7). Work proceeded in arbitrary 10 cm levels until sterile clay was encountered. Due to limited time and labor force, all soil was troweled, locating all artifacts and features in situ, then discarded, with the exception of three units.
These three units were troweled and screened through I/4 inch hardware cloth. All
cultural materials were collected and stored in individual bags which correlated
to each level.
Stratigraphy was not visually apparent as the deposits appeared to be a homogeneous mass. Due to the large amount of rodent activity which had taken

Bowman-- Winnie’s Mound

41

place, erosional episodes that occurred between occupational periods further
confused the issue. Stratigraphy was later detected during analysis and a simple
mathematical formula was applied to each unit. This proved to be successful in
relating all units to each other regardless of their nonconforming depths and irregular predepositional surfaces, thus producing four distinct cultural levels with
nearly sterile strata between occupied levels.
Each unit’s actual depth was divided by 15. The resulting figure was then
divided into an artifact’s elevation above sterile clay, producing any one of 15
mathematical levels. Example: Unit C-4 has an actual depth of 170 cm from surface to sterile clay; V~sth of 170 cm = 11.33 cm. Each 11.33 cm for the purpose
of discussion will be considered as one level. An artifact encountered at 140 cm
above sterile clay would be treated as 140 cm + 11.33 cm = 12.36 cm, placing it
in the 12th of 15 mathematical levels.
Unit C-3 has an actual depth of 110 cm; %sth of 110 cm = 7.33 cm. An
artifact encountered 90 cm above sterile clay would be treated as 90 cm + 7.33
cm = 12.28 cm, placing it in the 12th of 15 mathematical levels. When this procedure was applied to each artifact or feature encountered, they consistently lined
up on four levels with sterile zones in between. In two cases, there were two
mathematical levels which contained the same cultural debris and were consolidated to become one stratum, thus producing 11 recognized strata (See Table 5).

LITHIC TECHNOLOGY
Debitage from three units was analyzed by 10 cm levels with the hope of
producing information on the kind and quantity of artifacts produced at the site.
Comparison of raw materials to finished artifacts should determine if the artifacts described in this paper were manufactured at the site or elsewhere and also
the methodology of manufacture emp!oyed. Strategies from Shafer (1973) were
used exclusively as a guideline for all analysis of debitage.
A search for chert procurement sites was conducted and was successful in
locating deposits of chert in the form of nodules, which were deposited by the
Brazos River in the present day channel and in other areas of the valley. These
nodules generally exhibit a rich brown cortex with interiors ranging in color from
light tan to gray with an occasional occurrence of mottled olive and black. Local
chert is defined as any material readily obtained in the general area and is based
on the knowledge gained from inspection of the procurement sites. Nonlocal
cherts included material known to be obtained in the San Gabriel River basin and
types totally unknown to the author. The distinction of local versus nonlocal is
purely subjective on the author’s part and is based on the aforementioned research. While it is possible for some small amounts of nonlocal chert to be transported to the local area by rivers, my research shows that a size and quantity
large enough to produce finished lithics is highly improbable.

Terminology

The following terms are used in this paper:
Cobbles - are defined as water-tumbled nodules of chert.
Cores - Cobble that has been partly reduced by flake removals.
Primary Flakes - Retains all of the cortex on dorsal side; these were flakes removed from the outside of a cobble.
Secondary Flakes - Retains only a small amount of cortex, usually on only one
facet.
Tertiary Flakes - Retains none of the original cortex.
Hard Hammer Percussion - A method of flake removal using materials as hard or
harder than the material being reduced, producing thick flakes with fractured or beveled points of impact. (Shafer 1973: 67-69)
Soft Hammer Percussion - A method of reduction using a material softer than the
material being worked to remove flakes and usually producing thin, curved
flakes exhibiting a lip at the point of impact. (ibid.: 116-118)

Discussion
Due to the scarcity of river cobbles located at the site, it is assumed that
cores were produced elsewhere and transported to the site. Nonlocal cherts show
up only late in the manufacturing process, which could imply reworking of artifacts already in the possession of the aborigines. One very large blue chert blank
identical to chert observed west of Georgetown, Texas, was discovered as a surface find at the site. This find suggests the possibility of a trade network with
other areas. However, at present, there is not enough information available to
support this theory, due to the very small percentage of nonlocal cherts to local
cherts and the lack of nonlocal cores.
Methodology of chert reduction changes with each stage of manufacture
(see Tables 1, 2, and 3.) Primary flakes in the sample were removed far more
frequently by hard hammer techniques than by soft hammer percussion and the
existence of nonlocal material in this category is rare; none were encountered in
Unit C-5 (Table 2), with the largest percentage (1.59%) discovered in Unit E-6
(Table 3).
Secondary flakes were produced mainly by hard hammer reduction methods
but the use of the soft hammer technique begins to increase while the local to
nonlocal chert ratio remains about the same.
The last stage of production studied was tertiary flakes. The use of hard
hammer drops dramatically and the use of soft hammer becomes the most consistently used method of reduction. This category also provided the largest percentage of nonlocal cherts ranging from (2.01%), Unit C-3 (Table 1), to a (4.74%),
Unit E-6 (Table 3).

THE ARTIFACTS
A total of 189 lithic artifacts was recovered from the site. Table 4 records all
information regarding measurements and chert types, while Table 5 records
provenience for each artifact. In most cases, typo!ogy was dictated by Turner
and Hester (1985). Any deviation from this text will be stated in the following
descriptions.
By comparing material types found in the artifact assemblage (Table 4) to
debitage recovered (Tables 1-3), it becomes apparent that the nonlocal artifacts
were not produced at the site, but were probably reworked; nonlocal debitage is
most prevalent in the form of tertiary flakes, the last stage in chert reduction.
Crude tool forms are made almost exclusively of local chert while the projectile
point assemblage includes (15%) nonlocal cherts.
The disturbed nature of the strata produces a possibility that at least some
artifacts were displaced, although it appears that diagnostic point types occur in
their expected sequence (see Table 5).

Artifact Descriptions
Arrow Points
Scallorn (N=3; Figure 1,A,B) Triangular serrated blades with straight to
convex bases. All examples show strongly barbed shoulders, nice workmanship,
and are made of local tan and brown chert.
Dart Points
Bell (N= 1; Figure 1 ,C) One example was recovered. It is extremely well
made of a nonlocal blue chert. This specimen has been reworked as one barb is
missing, but retouched, and has a short concave blade, due to reworking.
Darl (N=I; Figure 1,D) The long, serrated blade with a slightly ground,
concave base is a typical example of this dart point form. It exhibits average
workmanship and is of a local gray chert.
Edgewood (N=3; Figure I,E, F) Three examples of this type were recovered. All are made of local cherts. They have concave bases, showing signs of
grinding, with short triangular blades. Two of the three have broken distal ends.
Ensor (N=2; Figure 1 ,G) No complete examples were recovered. Both have
broken distal ends. One example appears to have been aborted in manufacture.
Both are made of local tan chert having straight to slightly convex bases with
deep notches and prominent shoulders. Both have slightly convex, long, triangular blades.
Frio (N=2; Figure 1 ,H) These have almost straight triangular blades, wide
notches, and prominent shoulders. Bases are straight with a deep U-shaped notch
exhibiting some grinding. One is rather crude with a beveled blade made of local
tan chert. The other is of nonlocal banded chert of good workmanship.

J)

These two types have been combined for

the purpose of this paper, as the points recovered do not fit either definition exactly, but fall nicely between the two. Of the six examples, four are contracting
stemmed with two having nearly parallel stems. Bases are mixed, from straight
to convex, with one example having a slightly concave base. All have triangular
straight blades, one being finely serrated. All are made from !ocal gray and tan
chert.
Hoxie (N= 1; Figure 1 ,K) This basal-ground, nearly parallel-stemmed point
exhibits a deeply concave base with a nearly straight, beveled, serrated blade and
is manufactured of local gray chert.
Lange (N=2; Figure 1 ,L,M) Large, triangular blades with prominent shoulders and expanding stems are the dominant features of this type. Bases on both
are nearly straight. All examples are of local gray chert of fair workmanship.
One example is lacking its distal end.
Marcos (N=5; Figure 2,A,B) All five specimens are made of local chert.
Two seem to have been broken in manufacture, while two lack distal ends. All
exhibit wide, convex, triangular blades and broad, convex bases with deep corner notches producing long barbs. Two show excellent workmanship, while one
is quite crude.
Plainview-like(N = 1 ; Figure 2-C) This projectile point, made of local tan
chert, is lanceolate in shape with a concave base. It is basal-ground and exhibits
edge grinding on approximately 40 percent of its total length.
San Patrice (N= 1; Figure 2,D) One example of this type was recovered. It
is of local chert and of exceptional workmanship. The fluted base is deeply concave with basal grinding. The blade is leaf-shaped and constitutes over 80 percent of the total length.
Yarbrough (N=3; Figure 2,F) All are produced from local chert, one having
a triangular-shaped blade, the others having leaf-shaped blades. All three have
slightly concave bases--two having expanding ground stems and one a nearly
parallel stem. Workmanship could be considered crude.
Unclassified Dart Points
Form 1 (N= 1; Figure 2,E) This example exhibits a triangular blade with
asymmetrical barbs; one long and curved and the other very short. The stem has
nearly parallel edges and a straight base. This artifact is made of local gray chert
of average workmanship.
Form 2 (N=5; Figure 2,G, H) This form like Forms 4 and 9 is common to
the lower strata; Dr. Thomas Hester (personal communication) suggests they are
all variations of the same type. He terms them "Early Corner Notched." This
loosely-defined group could be classified as Gower or Uvalde. The wide variation
of typological traits in the sample, and the wish to avoid controversy, has
prompted the author to describe them as three separate forms. Form 2 has a
strongly expanding stem with a deep, U-shaped notch. Only one example lacks
heavy basal grinding. Blade shape varies greatly, some are very broad and triangular with long barbs, others are beveled and convex with sharp prominent

shoulders. Three examples are of local tan chert, while two are of nonlocal blue
and black. Workmanship is good.
Form 3 (N=4; Figure 2, I, J) This side-notched type exhibits a leaf-shaped
blade, slight angular shoulders, and a slightly concave, almost straight base. Two
examples are of local tan chert, one is of nonlocal blue, and the other is of an
orange translucent material of unknown origin. Workmanship is good.
Form 4 (N=2; Figure 2, K, L) These small points are more Gower-like than
Form 2 or 9 and may be a variation of that type. Both examples exhibit a short

thick triangular blade, beveled in one example, and nearly absent shoulders.
Ground stems are almost rectangular with pronounced U-shaped notches in the
base. Both examples are of local tan and gray chert.
Form 5 (N=2; Figure 3,A,B,) Long, narrow leaf-shaped blades with weak
shoulders and a thinned, flared base, concave in one example and slightly convex
in the other, describes these examples. Both are of local chert, one tan and one
gray, with crude workmanship.
Form 6 (N = 1 ; Figure 3,C) This basal-ground example appears to have been
abandoned in manufacture, then exposed to extreme heat. It is diamond-shaped
in cross section with very weak shoulders and a slightly expanding stem. It is
made of a !ocal gray chert.

Form 7 (N= 1; Figure 3,D) This specimen is of crude workmanship and of
loca! gray chert, tt has a leaf-shaped blade and side notches located about onefifth of the way from this point’s concave base.
Form 8 (N = 1; Figure 3,E) One example having a heavy, serrated, triangular
blade and a strongly expanding stem culminating in a straight base was recovered
at the site. It is made of a light-gray local chert and is poorly made.
Form 9 (N=5; Figure 3, F, G) This type is the last described variant of
Hester’s "Early Corner Notched" series, showing traits of Hoxie, Uvalde, and
Gower. Of the five examples recovered, three are missing distal ends. The two
complete examples have triangular blades with nearly straight to slightly convex
edges. Shoulders vary from slight to prominent. Stems are strongly expanding
and flare outward in all examples. Thinned bases have deep U-shaped notches.
Stems and bases are smoothed in four of the five examples. Three are of local
chert and show fair craftsmanship but are thick in appearance, while two are nonlocal--one blue chert and one unknown material, showing better workmanship.
Bifaee Failures (N=72)
A total of 72 bifaces broken in manufacture were found representing all occupied strata. Without exception, these are of local tan and gray chert.
Awl (N = 1; Figure 3,H)
This specimen is of local tan chert with a thinned, flaring base and a long,
needle-like blade culminating in a sharp tip. It exhibits good craftsmanship.
Corner Tanged Biface (N = 1; Figure 3,I)
This knife was manufactured from local tan chert. It is beveled from right to
left on the ventral surface and shows considerable wear. A small amount of cortex
is visible on the "tang" portion of this artifact. It is of excellent workmanship.
Drills (N=2; Figure 3, J,K)
One incomplete specimen is triangular in cross section with nearly parallel
edges. It is of local tan chert. The other, unifacial in design, was produced from a
secondary local tan chert flake. The thin, short bit was formed by pressure
flaking.
Ovate Bifaces (N=8; Figure 4, A)
Eight specimens were recovered which vary in quality of workmanship,
size, and material. Seven examples are made of local tan, gray, and brown chert.
One, the largest showing the best workmanship, is of a chocolate brown material
of unknown origin.
Bifaces, Group I
Group I represents seven tools which are conducive to woodworking and
were probably hafted. To demonstrate this, the author produced reproductions of
these tools and, with little difficulty, used these to carve a wood atlatl. Each example’s bit is angled at about 45° from the center plane of the tool.
IA (N=4; Figure 4, B) Included in this group are three specimens of local
tan chert and one a black chert of unknown origin. They show a striking resemblance in bit design to tools termed Guadalupe bifaces described by Turner and
Hester (1985: 216-218). They are nearly triangular in cross section and have

48

a radically concave bit produced by the removal of many short flakes from the
dorsal side.
IB (N=2; Figure 4, C) Two examples of this tool were recovered and are
similar in design to IA except that the bit was formed by the removal of long,
straight flakes from the ventral surface and a number of shorter flakes from the
dorsal, producing a thinner, slightly concave cutting edge. This could be interpreted as a chisel version of IA.

much of the original cortex on its ventral surface. This example was produced
from a local chert cortical flake that was bifacially worked only around the
bit area.
Bifaces, Group H
Six hand-held carving or chopping tools are represented in this group. These
possibly could serve the same function as Group I bifaces.
IIA (N=2; Figure 5, A) These two crude examples were manufactured from
medium-sized local tan river cobbles. They retain most of the original cortex and

are bifacially worked to produce a concave bit in one instance and a nearly
straight bit in the other.
liB (N=4; Figure 5, B) All specimens are manufactured from local river
cobbles by hard hammer reduction. One end has been bifacially reduced at approximately 30° to produce a sharp edge. Bit design varies from nearly straight
to convex and angular.
Unifacial Artifacts
Unifacial Group I Six distinct types of artifacts, which could be classed as
scrapers, are present in this collection. All are manufactured from local tan and
gray chert with one exception of silicified wood.
IA (N= 11; Figure 5, C) Each example of this class exhibits one worked
convex side. Seven examples are thick and retain much of the original cortex
while four are secondary hard hammer flakes showing no cortex.
IB (N=6; Figure 5, D) Six implements have one worked end. Four are large
hard hammer flakes retaining much of the cortex while two are secondary flakes
showing no cortex.
IC (N= 1 ; Figure 5, E) This tool consists of a hard hammer primary flake
with two worked parallel convex edges. It is of a local gray chert.
ID (N=2; Figure 6, A) Both examples exhibit three worked edges; one is a
small secondary flake showing good workmanship, the other a primary flake
crudely formed.
IE (N=3; Figure 6, B) A concave scraping edge is the distinguishing feature
of this group. Two examples are of local chert and retain much of the original
cortex while one is of poor quality silicified wood.
IF (N=2; Figure 6, C) Two tools are included in this group. One example
retains some cortex while the other is completely void of this trait.
Battered Stone
Hammerstone (N=2; Figure 6, D) These small cobbles of local river chert
are heavily battered on one side showing multiple step fractures on approximately 40 percent of total surface area. Each retains much of the original cortex.
Smoothed Stone
Mano (N=2; Figure 6, E,F) One example is of soft sandstone exhibiting a
convex, smoothed ventral surface and an altered dorsal surface which shows
signs of pecking. The other is a small quartzite cobble showing signs of wear on
both ventral and dorsal surfaces and a battered lateral edge.
Ceramics
Potsherds (N=5) All specimens are classed as "sandy paste" with very fine
grain sand as a temper. Colors range from almost black to dark gray with brown
mottled exteriors. By measuring the curvature of one large rim sherd, an estimated outside diameter of 36 cm was obtained for this vessel.
Fired Clay
A total of 1,958 pieces of fired clay was recovered from the three screened
units. These vary in size and shape from almost marblelike to irregular with
eroded exteriors. Colors range from black to mottled reds and tans. A small sam-

Bowman--Winnie’s Mound

pling was sliced and the interiors examined. There were no tempers in use and, in
most cases, they were thoroughly fired. There appeared to be three distinctly different explanations for the many clay fragments. They shall be treated as such in
the following text.
Type I (N=38; Figure 6, G,H) These irregularly-shaped burned clay pieces
have one concave surface and a convex opposite side. The diameter of the concave surface varies from 1 mm to 5 cm (See Table 6.) These are accidentally fired
daub coating used in the wattle and daub construction. Due to the nature of the

soil, no post hole molds or other evidence of a permanent structure was revealed
during excavation. Fired daub was noted throughout the occupations at Winnie’s
Mound (see Table 6).
Type H (N=42, Figure 6, I,J) These were used to transfer thermal energy in
food preparation by being heated and then placed in a container of food. The use
of fired clay seems to be an East Texas and Louisiana custom, especially in areas
devoid of natural rock that could be used in cooking (Patterson 1975). In Late
Prehistoric times, fired clay nodules have been documented at Poverty Point,

Louisiana (Webb 1968) and in southeast Texas (Shafer 1968; Aten 1967). At
Winnie’s Mound, where an undisturbed hearth was located, it contained large
quantities of these fired clay balls. They vary in size and distribution (see Table 6).
Type III (N=42) These large burned clay balls were without exception
found in association with hearths. They appear to have been heaped around the
fire as mud balls, then fired as the hearth was used. On close examination, they
are fired on the side closest to the fire and almost unfired on their opposite surface. They range in size from 5 cm to 10 cm in diameter (see Table 6).
Faunal Remains
Large amounts of poorly preserved or fragmented bone were recovered from
the excavation and, in most cases, it was impossible to separate erosionally displaced human bone fragments from animal bone. Of the 15 identifiable specimens recovered, 11 were whitetail deer (Odocoileus virginianus), three were redeared turtle (Chrysemys scripta elegans), and one example of a beaver tooth
(Castor canadensis) was recovered in Stratum 7. Fresh water bivalve shell and
bird bone fragments were recovered from all occupied strata, but identification of
species was impossible due to poor condition.
Burials
The cemetery contained 12 identifiable burials and many displaced human
teeth and bone fragments that could not be assigned to any known burials. Although charred human molars and other bone were encountered, there is not
enough evidence to prove or disprove the existence of cremations at this site. The
homogeneous character of the soil made it impossible to discern burial pits and
no artifacts discovered could be interpreted as grave goods. When burials were
complete enough to warrant the effort, they were removed in blocks of matrix,
wrapped in plaster casts, then transported. In instances when only a few fragments of bone were encountered, this procedure was not employed. They were
individually collected, marked, and bagged.
Figure 7 shows the horizontal distribution of burials and the excavated area.
Figures 8 and 9 demonstrate the vertical distribution of burials in tour units. Due
to the fact that an unknown quantity of soil was removed for construction purposes from the surface of the midden, al! measurements will be given from sterile clay up.
Burial 1 (Figure 10) This young adult was interred in a bundle fashion. The
skul! was facing 255° W-SW and lying on its right side. There was an elevation of
45 cm fi’om sterile clay to the underside of this burial and 65 cm to the uppermost
point placing this individual in Stratum 3. Skeletal material recovered was only
partially complete and composed of skull, long bone shafts, rib fragments, and a
pelvic fragment. Teeth are well worn but lack dental caries or evidence of abscess. Sex is undeterminable.
Burial 2 (Figure 1 I) This individual is an adult of undeterminable sex in a
tightly flexed supine position. Alignment of this burial is only slightly off a N-S
plane, with the skull in the southernmost direction. From sterile clay to the
uppermost portion of this individual is a distance of 140 cm, the lowest 130 cm,

placing it in Stratum 8. The skull has been severely damaged by a chisel plow.
Mandibles and maxilla were never recovered but enough skull fragments were
recovered to re-assemble a nearly complete, elongated cranium exhibiting a
gracile brow. All skeletal material was normal and showed no signs of osteological abnormality except the right ulna, which had a well-healed fracture approximately 8 cm from the olecranon. A small, tan chert ovate biface and two
biface fragments were recovered from the fill soil.

Burial 3 Ten cm directly beneath the cranium of Burial 2 was a robust adult
male skull in an inverted position facing 30° N-NE. The mandible was partially
articulated and a small amount of foreign bone was located in the vicinity of the
foramen magnum. Although the material could not be positively identified, the
author suggests it is the remaining fragments of the first cervical vertebra. All
third molars had erupted and were fully developed. Dental caries were absent but
teeth are heavily worn. There is no evidence present to suggest that Burial 2 intruded upon a complete burial. In this case, it seems this skull was interred
alone.

facing 330° N-NW and is located in Stratum 3. Recovered bone consists of a
crushed skull, a mandible, long bone shafts, and a few pelvic fragments. Facial
features are gracile in appearance. Teeth seem to be free of dental caries and are
heavily worn. All third molars have erupted.
Burial 5 This individual was located in Stratum 3 with an elevation of 40 cm
above sterile clay. Due to poor preservation and its disarticulated condition, very
little could be ascertained from this burial. Recovered bone consists of a few long
bone shafts, three skull fragments, and one well-worn molar.

Burial 6 Stratum 8 yielded the least preserved individual encountered. The
only skeletal material recovered was five molars and one premolar in occlusion
lacking all mandible and maxillary material. A light discoloration in the soil
marked the outline of the cranium, ulnas, radii, and femur. It appeared to be
flexed, lying on its left side facing approximately 30° N-NE.
Burial 7 (Figure 13) This secondary interment or bundle was the second and
last encountered. This adult consists of a crushed skull, disarticulated mandible,
and teeth showing a few small dental caries. Other skeletal material includes long
bone shafts and a few rib fragments.
Burial 8 Stratum 8 provides an individual lying 60 cm - 75 cm above sterile
clay which has been devastated by the chisel plow. Establishing orientation, sex,
or interment style is impossible due to condition, but the examination of surviving teeth suggests the probability of adult status.
Burial 9 A hearth intruded upon Buria! 9 producing burned skull fragments
and a generally disturbed interment. It appears to be flexed but original orientation and age could not be established. This individual rests in Stratum 3 and has

an elevation of 30 cm at its lowest point and 40 cm. at its highest point above
sterile clay.
Burial 10 An erosionally displaced burial was encountered in Stratum 4.
This severely disarticulated individual was strewn over a four square meter area
with only long bone shafts and a few skull fragments recovered. Original orientation and statistical information was impossible to determine.
Burial 11 A small child approximately four or five years of age was recovered associated with Burial 12. In this instance, bone preservation was very
poor, but a partially complete crushed skull and a few long bone shafts were recovered. Orientation of this individual was on a NW-SE plane with the head
being placed to the southeast.
Burial 12 This flexed adult was positioned on its left side facing 90° east
and was buried in Stratum 3 with child burial 11. No teeth, mandible, pelvis, or
maxillary bones were recovered, so age and sex could not be determined. This
interment seems to have been disturbed either by aboriginal excavations at the
site or erosion, as only a few skull fragments and an incomplete count of long
bone shafts were encountered.

DISCUSSION
Twelve burials were recorded at 41BU17 in 1983 and at first it was assumed
that all were from the same time period. However, during analysis, while charting artifacts and burials on a vertical graph (Figures 8 and 9), it became evident
that there were two groups of burials from different time periods. Group One,
consisting of Burials 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, and 12 were interred during a much
earlier occupation than the Group Two burials (2, 3, and 8).
Since the original surfaces from which the burials were introduced was not
evident by visual inspection, it was necessary to conduct an experiment to try
and estimate which strata would have been the most likely level from which each
group of burials was introduced.
A pit was dug using only a bovine scapula and a sharp stick--tools that
were available to the aboriginal groups. It soon became apparent that to excavate
a hole of great depth in this manner was impractical. This experience seemed to
suggest that the graves were rather shallow. Most interments were flexed and on
their sides and since the human body in this position would require a minimum
depth of 50 cm from the surface to the bottom of the pit, an estimated average
figure of 70 cm was adopted for the purpose at hand. Hall (1981: 78) noted that at
Allen’s Creek burials were interred in a deposit only after an accumulation of
40-90 cm of sand. This observation reinforces the hypothesized figure of 70 cm.
When this figure is applied vertically to the deposits, which Group One burials
were enveloped in, it places a possible original surface at Stratum 7, which

62

Texas Archeological Society

yielded Lange dart points, or in the Late Archaic context 2250-2600 BP (Prewitt
1981: 13).
When the same theory is applied to Group Two, they would be placed in an
unknown zone that was destroyed by the removal of earth for fill; possibly the
missing Toyah Phase noted in other parts of the site (see my comments in the
Introduction).
At present, this time frame is purely speculative and the hope exists that a
similar cemetery in the general area with better soil conditions will be excavated to
either prove or disprove this estimated chronology for the interments at 41BU17.
In four cases out of the 12 burials, little or no information was gained to
shed light on Winnie’s Mound mortuary practices due to three major disruptive
forces.
Burial 10 was severely scattered by an apparent erosional episode that obliterated any traces of this individual’s original resting place. Interments 5 and 9
were displaced by aboriginal excavations with Burial 9 being further disturbed
by an intrusive hearth in the vicinity of this individual’s skull, producing charred
cranial fragments and other burned bone. The third and most disruptive force
occurred in historic times when the cultivator’s chisel plow virtually destroyed
Burial 8 and removed all traces of mandibular and maxillary materials from
Burial 2.
Group One burials were reduced in number from nine to six by the aforementioned disruptive forces. Of the remaining six, two are secondary interments
or bundle burials. This mortuary practice to date has not been documented in
Burleson County or, in fact, in any of the surrounding counties, with the nearest
examples coming from Austin County to the south at Allen’s Creek (Hall 1982).
There appear to be three logical explanations for the existence of bundle
burials at the site. One, an individual would die at the site and the remains would
be consigned to a scaffold or tree until decomposition freed the bones of flesh. At
that time the bones would be collected and interred in the cemetery. The second
possibility is that an individual would die elsewhere. After decomposition had
taken place, the remains would be collected and transported to the cemetery for
interment. Either case would require more effort expended for the deceased than
the use of a simple interment. Thirdly, a burial could have been accidentally disturbed by aboriginal excavations, the remains collected and reinterred in the
cemetery. Any of these possibilities seem to imply that this particular parcel
of land held meaning, either religious or territorial, to the populations being
discussed.
The remaining individuals of this group were all buried in a flexed position.
Numbers 6 and 12 were interred on their left sides, 6 facing north and 12 facing
east. Burial 4 was on its right side, facing N-NW.
It is interesting to note that at 41BU17 there is almost no consistency in
grave orientation while at 41BU16 (Roemer 1985), a few km to the north, some
consistency is evident in the five burials discovered. Orientation in one case is
impossible to discern because of its disturbed nature, but all the others recovered

Bowman-- Winnie’s Mound

63

face in either a northern or. a southern direction. 41BU16 also includes a single
group interment consisting of an adult female and a five-year-old child nestled
between her stomach and flexed legs (Steele 1985).
At 41BU17 a flexed adult lying on its left side (12), was located with a small
child (11), approximately the same age as the one at 41BU16. In this instance,
the child’s orientation appears to be on a NW-SE plane or aligned with the spine
of the flexed adult. Steele (1985) notes, "the possibility of a catastrophic situation taking the lives of two individuals within a few days of each other." Unfortunately, at Winnie’s Mound, as well as 41BU16, there is no evidence to suggest the
cause of death.
The Group Two burials consist of three individuals, one of which was destroyed by a plow. The surviving burials are those of a flexed individual in a
supine position (2), and an inverted skull (3), lying directly below the skull of
Burial 2. The association between these two burials is unclear. While the possibility of Burial 2 intruding on the remains of Burial 3 exists, there is no evidence
to suggest that this was the case. With the exception of the skull and articulated
mandible, there was no skeletal material in or around those burials that could be
assigned to individual 3.
The author is unaware of any documented case in Central Texas where an
individual was interred in an inverted position or, for that matter, a severed head
being interred with another individual as a trophy.
The people of Winnie’s Mound made use of a geographically-confined area
for a cemetery. This practice has been documented in other areas of Texas. The
Loeve-Fox site (Prewitt 1981: 62) has a large number of burials within a three
meter diameter circular area and at Allen’s Creek, Hall (1981: 76) notes, "The
earliest occupation took place within and about an irregularly-shaped basin or
depression at the edge of a bluff." Hall (ibid.) further states that occupying such
a place would provide "a well-protected pocket" for aborigina! occupation.
The first group of interments at Allen’s Creek, as well as at Winnie’s Mound,
was not introduced until this depression had filled up with sand to a level great
enough for this purpose -- 40 - 90 cm (Hall 1981:78). This scenario seems to fit
perfectly with the series of events at Winnie’s Mound and the parallels between
the two sites should not be underestimated.

SUMMARY

Winnie’s Mound was occupied by small bands of hunter gatherers, perhaps
in some instances semipermanently, as suggested by the wattle and daub structures (see Figure 6). The occupation extended from Late Paleo-Indian times,
documented by San Patrice and Plainview-like dart points in Stratum 1, to a Late
Prehistoric Austin Phase in Strata 10 and 11, as characterized by Scallorn arrow
points and sandy paste pottery.

By comparing debitage to finished artifacts, it seems the artifacts made of
nonlocal material were not produced at the site but were manufactured elsewhere. This suggests that these people traveled or traded far into Central Texas
during certain times of the year, bringing back points made of nonlocal materials
and would explain the complete lack of crude tools made of those materials.
There is little evidence to support the theory that a structured trade network
existed, but the possibility exists and should in the future be researched.
The area of aboriginal occupation at Winnie’s Mound encompasses many
acres of a high ancient river terrace. The cemetery is located in a slight depression on the side of the terrace. Debris from the occupations began to fill in the
depression creating a sandy midden deposit, which in time allowed the easy interment of the first group of burials. Although no material suitable for radiocarbon dating was recovered, and all inference to time is based on diagnostic
point type associations, this group seems to be derived of individuals of Late
Archaic times or a date approximating 2400-2600 B.R
A period of time elapsed during which the cemetery area was used for other
purposes, probably by other groups. Eventually the second group of burials was
introduced in the still-accumulating deposits, probably associated with Toyah
Phase people or a possible date of A.D. 1200. After examining the existing
skeletal material, it appears that these people were free of bone disease and dental problems, with the exception of heavy tooth wear, and were gracile in facial
appearance.
The artifact assemblage represents a blend of eastern and Central Texas
types. The many untyped points are probably loca! variations of these artifacts
and suggest to the author that the Brazos River could be a boundary used by both
groups throughout the site’s occupation.
In the author’s opinion, this project has created questions that when answered will fill in many gaps in Texas prehistory and demonstrates the need
for more controlled excavations in the area between the Little River and the
Navasota’s respective confluences with the Brazos River.
