ABSTRACT
This report documents the substantive findings and management recommendations of a cultural
resource inventory conducted on two separate tracts of land totaling 1,070 acres at Lake Wright
Patman, East Texas. Work was conducted at the request of the Piney Woods Project Office of
the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District (USACE). The USACE has
proposed timber harvesting within the selected tracts at Lake Wright Patman and, in compliance
with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, the inventories were completed to
ensure that any cultural resource sites located on the parcels would be considered in planning and
conducting the undertaking.
Archeological fieldwork was conducted between November 28 and December 8, 2006.
Fieldwork included a 100% pedestrian survey accompanied by manual excavation of 833 shovel
tests. Recovered artifacts included historic ceramics, metal, and glass. All subsurface artifacts
were recovered and will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL).
Archival research was also conducted on one historic site.
One previously recorded site and one newly discovered archeological site were documented
within the project areas. Neither site is considered eligible for the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP) and no further work is warranted.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

THE UNDERTAKING

The United States Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District (USACE) is responsible for
managing certain federally owned lands in East Texas in association with lakes, reservoirs and
navigable waterways. These management responsibilities include 45,063 acres at Lake Wright
Patman (acreages are outside conservation pools).
While planning and conducting undertakings that have the potential to affect historic properties,
the USACE must take such resources into account. Therefore, in compliance with Section 106 of
the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 as amended through 1992 (P.L. 89-665 et
seq.), the current investigation was authorized by the USACE to identify any archeological sites,
buildings, structures, or other resources that may be eligible for inclusion on the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The work was conducted on and all sites are located on
lands owned by the Federal Government and managed by the USACE.
Much of the USACE managed acreage at Lakes Wright Patman is forested by mature pine and
pine-hardwood stands. In conjunction with the existing management plans for the reservoirs and
in accordance with accepted silviculture methodologies, the USACE has planned certain
management areas for selective timber thinning at this lake. Commercial thinning removes
marketable trees in uneven-aged stands (not clear-cut) through single tree selection. Removal of
crop trees often disturbs the ground surface, but extensive subsurface disturbance is not common.
1.2

LOCATION

The project area consists of two separate parcels totaling 1,070 acres at Lake Wright Patman in
Cass County (Table 1-1, Figure 1-1). Lake Wright Patman is on the Sulphur River 18 km
southwest of Texarkana in Bowie and Cass Counties (Figure 1-1). The far upstream portions of
the reservoir extend into Morris, Titus, and Red River Counties. Initially known as Texarkana
Reservoir, the lake was renamed in the late 1970s in honor of the East Texas congressman
(Breeding 2005). The dam was built between 1948 and 1957 for flood-control, conservation and
recreational purposes. Elevation of the conservation pool typically varies seasonally; normal
elevations are 220.6 ft above mean sea level (AMSL) in winter and 227.5 ft. AMSL in summer.
Flood storage capacity is 259.5 ft. AMSL. During the summer, the lake can cover 33,750
acres; the normal winter conservation pool is 20,300 acres. Two parcels totaling 1,070 acres
are currently planned for timber thinning.

The Sawmill Hill North area
totals 550 acres. It is located in
Cass County on the east side of
Lake Wright Patman, about 8
km south of Texarkana and 15
km north of Atlanta (Figure 12). This parcel measures about
2.7 km from east to west by 3.2
km from north to south and is
located on the Wright Patman
Lake USGS 7.5â topographic
quadrangle. Elevation varies
between 225 ft AMSL nearest
the lake to about 275 ft AMSL
in the southern portion of the
parcel where two hills are
located.
1.2.2

Sawmill Hill South

The Sawmill Hill South area
totals 520 acres and is in Cass
County. It is located adjacent
to and immediately south and
west of the Sawmill Hill North
parcel (Figure 1-2).
The
irregularly
shaped
parcel
measures roughly 3.7 km from
east to west by about 3.5 km
from north to south. Elevation
varies between 225 ft AMSL at
the shoreline to 280 ft in the
southern portion of the parcel.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT

The project is located in the Oak-Hickory-Pine Forest vegetation region of east Texas as defined
by Gould (1969). Forested areas in the project areas included secondary growth and mature pine
and pine-hardwood stands (Figures 1-3). Pine stands observed during the field inventory were
typically comprised of loblolly (Pinus taeda), shortleaf (Pinus echinata), and longleaf (Pinus
palustris) pines. Hardwood trees noted during the survey included southern red oak (Quercus
falcate), white oak (Quercus alba) and American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis). Other
representative hardwoods present in the area include sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), bald

(Elecanus erythrorhynchos), common loons (Gavia immer), herons, and egrets.
1.4

BEDROCK GEOLOGY AND SOILS

The bedrock geology encountered within all four project areas at Lake Wright Patman is
predominantly comprised of mostly silt and sandy clay deposits of Wilcox Group undivided
(Ewi) sediments that formed approximately 40-45 million years ago during the Middle Eocene
(Texas Commission on Environmental Quality [TCEQ] 2004; Sellards et al. 1932:530). During
this time the project area would have been located within a shallow-water reef of the Kincaid
Sea, which covered large areas of the North American Southeast. Wilcox Group formations
extend approximately 200 m in depth and rest on upon an upper base of Midway Group deposits
which date to the Early Eocene (Sellards et al. 1932). Late Pleistocene aged gravel, sand, silt,
and clay fluvial terrace deposits (Qt) are mapped within the northern half of the Sawmill Hill
South parcel (TCEQ 2004).
Within central Bowie County, a Miocene to Pliocene aged gravel formation called âBowie
Gravelsâ can sometimes be seen resting upon a base of Wilcox Group geologic deposits in

Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,070 Acres at Lake Wright Patman, Cass County, Texas

upland areas along the headwaters of Elliot Creek (Peter and Cliff 1990). The fact that Bowie
Gravels occur over Wilcox formations suggests the gravels are possibly contemporaneous to
Uvalde Gravels, which were deposited during the Miocene and Pliocene epoch of the Tertiary
(ca. 23.8 â 1.8 million years ago). These gravels offered a readily available source of chert to the
Native American populations of the area.
The two inventory parcels at Lake Wright Patman contain soil types which formed over Wilcox
Group (Ewi) and Pleistocene fluvial terrace (Qt) deposits (USDA-SCS 2006). Cultural deposits
in these soils are generally shallowly buried and are adequately investigated by manual shovel
testing.
The two Sawmill Hill inventory areas have a complex soil mapping but are dominated by Latex
soils, with significant amounts of Eastwood and Bowie soils and with minor pockets of Metcalf,
Briley, Lilbert, Bibb, Cuthbert, Kirven, and Wrightsville soils (Table 1-2). In general, most soil
profiles in these inventory areas show thin veneers of sandy or silt loam over Pleistocene clays.
Soil descriptions and profiles are from USDA-SCS (2006).

The earliest archeological investigations in Northeast Texas were conducted in 1911 by the
Philadelphia Academy of Natural Science (Moore 1912). This early expedition recorded and
partially excavated several mound and habitation sites along the Red and Sulphur Rivers. Before
the impoundment of the Sulphur River, excavations were conducted in Cass and Bowie Counties
in the 1930s by the University of Texas, notably by Jackson (1932), Pearce (1932), and
Dickinson (1941). The first systematic archeological surveys of the area began in the late 1940s
along the Sulphur River of the Texarkana Reservoir (later renamed Lake Wright Patman) by the
Smithsonian Institution River Basin Surveys (RBS) (Stephenson 1950). This study recorded 50
sites. These early investigations were followed by the excavations by Jelks (1961) at the Snipes,
Knights Bluff, and Sherwin sites (41CS8, 41CS14, 41CS26).
Following impoundment, a shoreline survey of Lake Wright Patman was conducted in 1969 by
Briggs and Malone (1970) who recorded or revisited a total of 140 sites on or near government
fee lands at Lake Wright Patman. Because the methodology of this inventory was selective, the
total acreage surveyed is not known.
Since 1995, numerous surveys have been conducted at Lake Wright Patman by Geo-Marine, Inc.
(see White et al. 1995; Cliff et al. 1996; Hunt and Cliff 1998a, 1998b; Cliff and Hunt 1998;
Burson and Cliff 2000; Hunt and Borrego 2002; Hunt et al. 2002), by LL Consultants (see
Linder-Linsley and Lindsay 1997, 1998), by Deep East Texas Archeological Consultants and by
the USACE (see Austin 2002, 2003a, 2003b, 2005). These surveys totaled more than 11,300
acres and resulted in the documentation of 133 archeological sites. More recently, Ecological
Communications Corporation (EComm) has conducted a series of large scale inventories for the
USACE in advance of timber thinning undertakings (Trierweiler et al 2002; Trierweiler and
Bonine 2004; Trierweiler 2004; Bonine et al. 2004; Trierweiler and Jones 2005; Jones and
Trierweiler 2006a, 2006b). Including the current survey, EComm has inventoried 4,870 acres at
Lake Wright Patman and has documented 41 sites.
A small number of sites at Lake Wright Patman have been tested and/or subject to excavations.
The precise number of sites so investigated prior to and during the construction of the lake is
unknown due to incomplete and missing records. Some of the early excavations include work at
41CS1 (Bryonsâ Mill Mound) in 1932 (Goldschmidt 1932), at 41CS10 and 41CS14 (Knightâs
Bluff) in the early 1950s (Jelks 1961), and at 41CS35 by avocational archeologists in 1963
(Harris et al. 1980). Nearly all of the systematic excavations were by the Texas Archeological
Salvage Project (TASP) starting in 1958 under the direction of Edward Jelks. The TASP was
directed through the University of Texas at Austin with primary funding provided by the
National Park Service. Site 41CS14 was also tested by TARL in 1968. Finally, five sites were
tested in 1998 to assess NRHP eligibility and were determined not eligible (Owens and Hunt
1999).

PREVIOUSLY RECORDED SITES

2.2.1

Sites within the Inventory Parcels

A map and records search was conducted at the archives of the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL), the Texas Historical Commission (THC), and the THC Atlas online database
on November 8, 2006. These searches determined that one previously recorded archeological
site (41CS19) is located within the Sawmill Hill South parcel. The reader is referred to Chapter
4.0 Results for a complete background and description of 41CS19.
Historical USGS topographic maps were also consulted to determine whether or not historic sites
may be present. At Lake Wright Patman, both Sawmill Hill parcels appear on the 1909 edition
of the Texarkana, Texas quadrangle (1;62,500 scale), which was drawn from 1904-1906 survey
data. Within the Sawmill Hill South parcel, one structure symbol appears on the 1909 Texarkana
Quadrangle (Figure 2-1). The symbol is located on a terrace overlooking a drainage to the west
and is plotted approximately 750 meters away from two rural roads. This distance makes
accessing the symbol as an actual homestead problematic since most homesteads on the map
appear to be adjacent to roads.
2.2.2 Sites within One Mile of the
Inventory Parcels
Twenty archeological sites have been
previously recorded within one mile
(1,600 m) of the inventory area,
including seven prehistoric lithic
scatters and thirteen prehistoric
campsites that contain Caddo ceramics
(Table 2-1). Eighteen of the sites were
recorded in 1970 by Alton Briggs and
James Malone while conducting a
survey along the lakes shoreline. In
2004, EComm conducted an inventory
of the USACE Mill Creek North parcel
recording two new prehistoric sites
(41CS297, 41CS298) and revisiting
two previously recorded sites (41CS88,
41CS89).
During this inventory,
EComm investigated the recorded
location, but could not confirm the
presence, of six previously recorded
sites (41CS81, CS83, CS84, CS86,
CS87, CS90) within the parcel despite
shovel testing at the documented
locations on record (Bonine et al.
2004).

CULTURAL HISTORICAL FRAMEWORK

The prehistoric cultural framework in the East Texas region includes the Paleo-Indian, Archaic
and Woodland periods, and periods of Caddo horticultural adaptation and has been recorded by
many archeological investigations. This cultural framework, discussed further below, has been
adapted from Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993) and Perttula (1993a, 1993b, 1995, 2004).
2.3.1

Paleo-Indian Period

Generally, there is a lack of data relating to the Paleo-Indian Period (ca. 9500 to 7000 B.C.) in
East Texas. While many projectile points such as Clovis, Plainview, Dalton, Scottsbluff, and
San Patrice have been recovered, most were isolated, mixed, or surface finds or found in
excavations of later contexts (Perttula 2004). The distribution of artifacts suggests that most
sites occur within the valleys of major stream basins and resource-rich areas.

Ecological Communications Corporation

11

Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,070 Acres at Lake Wright Patman, Cass County, Texas

Regardless of the paucity of evidence, generalizations have been made regarding settlement
mobility and subsistence patterns during the Paleo-Indian period in East Texas. Evidence
suggests that groups occupied small camps and used a generalized toolkit, and that they were
more likely to be highly mobile hunters and gatherers rather than specialized large-game hunters
(Perttula 2004).
2.3.2

Archaic Period

The Archaic period (ca. 7000-200 B.C.) is subdivided into the Early (ca. 7000-4000 B.C.),
Middle (ca. 4000-2000 B.C.), and Late Archaic (ca. 2000-200 B.C.), although in the East region
of Texas, reliable dating is not yet available to unequivocally substantiate these different periods.
During the Early Archaic, sites are much smaller and more widely distributed, suggesting high
group mobility within large territories. Archeological data also suggest a generalized hunting
and gathering subsistence strategy focused on the exploitation of a wide variety of resources.
Although most Early Archaic sites are only briefly used, they are apt to be concentrated in the
larger drainage areas in the region (Perttula 2004).
The Middle Archaic is characterized by considerably larger sites within major basins in the
region, a more diverse hunting toolkit, the use of ground and polished stone tools, and the
increased use of plant foods as indicated by grinding implements and burned rock features.
Possible hearths, ovens and burned rock concentrations in the region suggest processing and
cooking of plant resources was important (Perttula 2004).
Throughout East Texas, Late Archaic period sites are relatively common along major streams
and springs in the uplands and on tributary drainages. During the Late Archaic population
density may have peaked, as evidenced by the apparent increase in the number of sites and
greater distribution of sites over the landscape. The large number and widespread distribution of
sites also suggests limited group mobility, the possible use of more defined territories, and
regular exploitation of localized food resources (Perttula 2004).
2.3.3

Woodland/Early Ceramic Period

The Woodland Period (ca. 200 B.C. â A.D. 800) is not well defined but is largely identified by
plainware ceramics, tempered with clay/grog or bone, and Gary projectile points. At sites near
the Red River, artifact assemblages are largely made up of ceramics, while at other sites in
Northeast Texas, such as near the Sulphur and Sabine rivers, ceramics are not as common. One
explanation for this difference may be possible regional differences in food processing and diet
during this time period, all of which may have an effect on the degree of sedentism between
regions (Perttula 2004).
To date, archeological evidence suggests Woodland populations were hunters and gatherers who
lived in larger groups and settled for longer periods of time in certain locations than they had in
the Archaic period. In some cases, such as at the Ray site, small settlements with structures and
middens suggest a more concentrated occupation, but these sites are not as permanent as those
seen at later Caddo period sites in the region (Perttula 2004). With the exception of the Sulphur
and Neches-Angelina River Basins, Woodland sites are not very common throughout much of
12

Ecological Communications Corporation

Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,070 Acres at Lake Wright Patman, Cass County, Texas

Northeast Texas, but when they occur, are represented by villages and hamlets in the floodplains
or terraces of larger streams, and by smaller components in the uplands. No Woodland period
burial mounds have been documented in the region.
2.3.4

Formative Caddoan Period and Early Caddoan Period

Sites dating to the Formative Caddoan Period (ca. A.D. 800-1000) and Early Caddoan Period
(ca. A.D. 1000-1200) are located primarily in the uplands just adjacent to major streams and
smaller tributaries and springs. Settlement locations with fertile soils and good drainage were
primarily chosen for habitation and cultivation of maize, squash and native plants. Permanent
settlements including structures, middens, pits, cemeteries, and artifacts such as tools and
ceramics were widespread. Common settlements in the region include hamlets and farmsteads
with rectangular and circular structures, many with associated cemeteries. In addition to small
farmsteads, larger communities such as the George C. Davis site on the Neches River are also
encountered. These large villages are more common during the Early Caddoan Period and
continue through the Middle Caddoan period, and include large groups of many structures,
mound centers, and elite burial pits. Distinctive artifacts such as celts, ceramic pipes and
earspools, and diversely decorated ceramic bowls and jars are commonly recovered from
Formative and Early Caddoan sites (Perttula 2004).
2.3.5

Middle Caddoan Period

Most archeological sites in Northeast Texas date to the Middle Caddoan Period (ca. A.D. 12001400). These sites continue the trend of diverse ceramic artifacts and larger settlements with
multiple mounds seen at the end of the Early Caddoan Period. One example of such a site is the
Oak Hill Village (41RK214), a large village with mounds, middens, and public structures.
Cultivation of maize and squash continued, but there is no evidence of dependence on maize and
other crops until after A.D. 1300 (Perttula 2004).
2.3.6

Late Caddoan Period

Archeological sites that date to the Late Caddoan Period (ca. AD 1400-1680) are abundant in
Northeast Texas. Late Caddoan sites are predominantly found in river basins such as the Red,
Cypress Creek, and Neches River basins. Smaller groups of sites are present in the Angelina,
Attoyac, middle and upper Sabine, and lower Cypress Bayou basins. Most Late Caddoan Period
archeological sites are either large permanent communities, or smaller farmsteads, both with
associated cemeteries. Late Caddoan period earthen mounds were constructed and primarily
used between A.D. 1400-1540, except in the Red River, where mound construction and mound
shaft burials continued until 1650 or 1700 (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993). Stable isotope and
bioarcheological evidence from the region indicate that at this time Caddo peoples were heavily
dependent on maize as their main dietary staple.
The Late Caddoan Titus Phase (ca. A.D. 1430-1680) refers to the archeological remains of
Caddoan peoples living in the northeastern Texas pineywoods between the Sulphur and Sabine
rivers. These Caddos lived in a hierarchical and elite-controlled society. They constructed both
small settlements with family cemeteries and large settlements with status-ranked community

cemeteries, and made culturally distinct and diverse ceramics. Titus phase sites usually are
found on valley terraces and upland slopes, projections, and basins, and permanent settlements
are usually located near freshwater springs (Perttula 2004).
The period after which European contact occurred (ca. A.D. 1540) is commonly referred to as
the Protohistoric period. In 1542, the De Soto-Moscoso entrada entered the region from the
Mississippi river valley and a number of different Caddoan groups were probably encountered
by Spanish explorers. Within 100 to 150 years after the entrada, the area occupied by the Titus
phase Caddo was mostly abandoned (Perttula 2004). While the archeological evidence of
Caddoan-Spanish contact is sparse in Northeast Texas, intermittent contact probably had
considerable effects on Caddoan groups, including exposure to a variety of infectious diseases
like smallpox to which they had no immunity (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993).
2.3.7

Historic Period

The Historic Caddoan period (ca. AD 1680-1860) is defined as the sustained European presence
in and occupation of the Caddoan area by Europeans in the region. It is during this time period
that the Caddo and all other Native American groups except the Alabama and Coushatta were
eventually moved from Texas to the Indian Territory. Most Historic Caddoan settlements in the
region were small farmsteads and hamlets with associated household cemeteries. Communities
were composed of many of these farmsteads spread out over large territories. Artifacts
recovered from these sites include a wide variety of Caddoan ceramics, basketry, ornaments, and
bone, stone, and wooden tools. European goods are commonly found on Historic Caddoan sites
after ca. A.D. 1740 and include guns and gun parts, glass beads, and metal items such as kettles,
hatchets, knives, hoes, lead balls, and silver, brass, and copper ornaments (Kenmotsu and
Perttula, 1993).
The first likely European expedition into the area around Lake Wright Patman was led by Luis
de Moscoso Alvarado in 1542. Moscoso was a member of the Hernando de Soto expedition into
the southeastern U.S. and took over after he died. Looking for an overland route back to New
Spain, Moscoso crossed into the territory that became Bowie County and used existing trails
established by the Caddo to move further into the interior of Texas before turning around and
traveling back to the coast (Bruseth and Kenmotsu 1993). French visitors to the area included
Henri Jountel, who was part of the LaSalle expedition, and Henri de Tonti, who went to the area
to look for survivors from Fort St. Louis (Harper 2005b). Permanent European presence began
in 1719, when Le Poste des Cadodaquious was established by the French at a location just to the
northwest of Texarkana. Although a fort in name, the establishment served more as a trading
station and supply base for further expeditions. The fort was abandoned a few years after the
Louisiana cession to Spain in 1762. The fort was reestablished in 1770 by the Spanish, under the
name San Luiz de los Cadodachos, but the Nasoni tribes with whom they were trying to foster a
relationship left the area soon after (Britton 2005). Finally, the Americans explored the area in
1806 when the Red River Expedition, launched by Thomas Jefferson, traveled up the Red River
to Spanish Bluff where they were forced to turn back by Spanish soldiers.
Immigration and settlement of the areas that would become Bowie and Cass Counties began in
the 1820s and 1830s. Both Anglo-Americans and members of the Shawnee, Delaware, and

14

Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,070 Acres at Lake Wright Patman, Cass County, Texas

Kickapoo Indians settled there, but the Native American tribes moved on within ten years. By
1846, the establishment of separate counties had been made and county lines had been resolved.
The white settlers were primarily from the South and set up slave-operated cotton plantations in
addition to raising corn, hogs, and some cattle. Just before the Civil War, the slave population
outnumbered the white population in Bowie County and numbered just under half in Cass
County (Harper 2005a; Harper 2005b). As was expected, the white population strongly
supported the secession movement and the Confederate war effort. Although no battle took
place in the area, federal troops occupied Bowie County in 1867 on behalf of the Freedmenâs
Bureau to assist black residents in obtaining their legal and political equality. This enflamed
white residents, who had lost much of their capital once the slaves were freed, and they secretly
supported anti-black movements such as Cullen Bakerâs gang and the Ku Klux Klan.
By the 1870s, the Texas and Pacific Railway was being built and several towns sprouted up in
the area. Texarkana was founded in 1873, at the site of an abandoned Caddo village, where two
major railroads would soon meet (Chandler and Howe 1939). It immediately became the largest
trading and manufacturing center in the area. Maud was formed in 1870. Atlanta was founded
in 1871, and it, along with Douglassville, was an economic center for the surrounding rural
community (Hazlewood 2005; Harper 2005c).
In 1902 the Northeast Texas Railroad Company was chartered as a common carrier. Previously it
had been operated as a private logging railroad known as the Munz Railroad. The line crossed
the Sulphur River and extended 18.6 miles (30 km) from Redwater in Bowie County to Munz in
Cass County, about 4 miles (6.4 km) northeast of Marietta (Harper 2006; Reed 1941:462). The
region remained primarily rural with an agricultural and timbering economy, but small
manufacturing firms also employed some of the local population. The Depression had a
devastating effect on the area, but World War II brought the establishment of the Red River
Army Depot and the Lone Star Army Ammunition Plant, which increasingly employed many of
the local residents from that point forward (Harper 2005a). Changes in the economic market
drew many people away from farming and into manufacturing and trade; however, populations
grew slowly, if at all, and the inhabitants remained relatively poor. Lake Wright Patman was
completed in 1957 and provided recreation facilities as well as flood control measures.

METHODS

The archeological field inventory was conducted over a period of 10 workdays between
November 28 and December 8, 2006. A total of 40 person-days were spent in the field.
Methods and density of shovel testing complied with, or exceeded, the minimum requirements
for field tactics stipulated by the USACE for archeological inventories in east Texas (USACE
2002:10-44).
3.1

SURVEY TACTICS

For each parcel, a logistical plan was prepared in advance with transect lines indicated at 20 m
intervals on aerial photographs. Each field archeologist was given a copy of the aerial and was
assigned a transect line and a targeted number of shovel tests. Transect lines were designated
with an alpha prefix and individual shovel tests along each transect line were numbered, so that
shovel test G-5 identified the fifth test along the seventh transect (Transect G). In general, each
crewmember followed his/her own transect, walking in parallel with the other crewmembers.
Occasionally, for logistical reasons, two crewmembers doubled up with one person digging the
shovel tests and another screening and recording the field forms, or two crew members would
âleapfrogâ along one transect, each digging alternating shovel tests. While approximately even
coverage was attempted, surveyors deviated from transect alignments in order to test high
probability locations. Tests were selectively placed on landforms shown by previous research to
be preferred site locations, such as ridgelines, knolls, and promontories. Areas of obvious deep
disturbance, such as bulldozing, were noted on the field maps and were excluded from shovel
testing. Similarly, areas that were completely inundated were excluded from transect coverage,
including low swampy areas, ponds, and all areas underneath current lake levels.
Special effort was made to relocate the previously recorded sites. The field crew used multiple
lines of evidence to ascertain the location (or suspected location) of each site. The crew referred
to the siteâs plot on the USGS topographic maps at TARL, to the original site sketch map (when
on file at TARL), and to the UTM (or latitude/longitude) coordinates of the site. Allowances
were made for possible conversion errors in coordinate systems, for possible map plotting errors,
and for the vagueness of early site descriptions. At each suspected location(s), the crew
conducted a pedestrian inspection of the vicinity. If no surface evidence of the site was seen, the
crew shovel tested the most probable location(s) based on the above lines of evidence.
Recent debris, such as aluminum beer bottles and plastic detritus, was commonly observed. No
further attention was paid to such items clearly less than 50 years old.
At all positive shovel tests and at selected other tests, GPS readings were taken to verify transect
and shovel test locations. All shovel tests were 30 to 35 cm in diameter. All tests were dug to
the bottom of the Holocene deposits as indicated by clay, or to 80 cm below ground surface if no
clay was present. Tests were individually recorded with regard to depth, soil type and color, and
cultural material present. Tests were dug in natural stratigraphic levels not exceeding 20 cm in
thickness and all excavated material was screened through Â¼-inch (6.4 mm) mesh.

All cultural material within shovel tests was collected with the exception of recent objects such
as bottle glass shards, nails, and aluminum pop-tabs. These were assumed to indicate recent
disturbance and were not collected. At the remaining sites, only diagnostic material and sample
collections were recovered due to high artifact quantities of the surface artifacts. All shovel tests
were backfilled.
Each positive shovel test was further investigated by excavating additional shovel tests in the
immediate vicinity at 5 to 15 m distances for up to six tests in an area. If more than one of these
tests were positive or if more than two artifacts were found in any single test, then the location
was designated as a site. Otherwise, the positive test was designated as an isolated occurrence.
The coordinates of isolates were plotted and the artifacts were collected, but these were not
further recorded. The recorded locations of previously recorded sites were similarly investigated
using multiple shovel tests. On each site a permanent site datum was established using a 12-inch
iron re-bar fixed with an aluminum survey cap. Caps were stamped with âECOM 2006â and with a
temporary site number for newly recorded sites and existing trinomials for prerecorded sites.
Site boundaries were delineated by excavating multiple shovel tests in the area to identify zones
of zero or low artifact presence. Generally, these were in cardinal directions from the initial
positive test, unless topography suggested an alternative tactic. Site boundaries were defined on
the basis of subsurface artifact distribution, complemented by surface artifacts and features
(where present), topography, soil exposures, and other relevant criteria. Additionally, sites along
the shoreline were visually inspected for artifact distribution, and site size was determined by the
extent of the surface artifacts. Based on the distribution of negative shovel tests or absence of
surface artifacts, site boundaries were prominently marked with fluorescent pink flagging tape.
Sites were photographed, sketched and mapped, and all site data were recorded onto State of
Texas site data forms. Artifacts, notes and records will be curated at TARL.
Appendix A presents aerial photographs of each survey parcel showing the locations of all
transects and shovel tests. Appendix B is a database of all shovel test information. Data are
given for each excavated level, including survey parcel, transect, and shovel test identifiers,
depth in centimeters below surface, Munsell color, sediment texture, and cultural material if any.
3.2

DENSITY OF SHOVEL TESTING

The contractual scope of work issued by the USACE specified that at a minimum one shovel test
was to be excavated per three acres (0.33 tests per acre). Using this rate of coverage, a minimum
of 353 shovel tests was required to inventory the 1,070 acres. In sum, 833 shovel tests were dug,
or 480 more than the required minimum. Intensity of shovel testing varied from parcel to parcel
depending on ground visibility,
vegetation
and
topography.

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Archival research was conducted on sites whose archeological evidence dated to the historic
period. The purpose of the archival research was to identify historically notable persons possibly
associated with each site. Initial archival research was carried out by examining the primary
sources in the deed, land title, and probate records. This research was conducted in Linden,
Texas for Cass County. The landowners, their heirs, assigns, and grantees were identified and
their presence in the area during the period of interest was verified through United States Census
data.
The identified persons were then further researched for historic significance. Individuals of
historic significance were defined as those who have merited an individual listing in The
Handbook of Texas Online published by the Texas State Historical Association and the General
Libraries of the University of Texas at Austin. If a person of historical significance was in any
way associated with the properties, capsule biography information was compiled and the nature
of the personâs relationship with the area and the tracts was further researched to determine the
level of the personâs involvement. Persons residing on a piece of property and/or actively
participating in its development were determined to be significantly associated with the property.
Persons owning a piece of property but not residing there nor actively participating in its
development (e.g., absentee owners) were determined to be not significantly associated with the

SAWMILL HILL NORTH

The Sawmill Hill North inventory area (Figure 4-1) totaled 550 acres and was inventoried using
425 shovel tests for a density of 0.77 shovel tests per acre. All shovel tests were negative and no
cultural resource sites are present within the parcel. An aerial photograph showing the locations
of all shovel tests excavated within the inventory area is provided in Appendix A.
4.2

SAWMILL HILL SOUTH

The Sawmill Hill South area totaled 520 acres and was inventoried using 408 shovel tests for a
density of 0.79 shovel tests per acre. One previously recorded prehistoric site was revisited and
one historic site was
discovered
within
the
project area. As previously
stated in Chapter 2, a
structural symbol appeared
within the Sawmill Hill
South parcel on the 1909
Texarkana Quadrangle (see
Figure 2-1). During the
survey the area in which the
symbol is located was
noted to have been cleared
of vegetation within the
past 10-15 years and
numerous deep 1m wide
logging tractor revetments
were noted on the surface.

Site 41CS19
Prehistoric site 41CS19 (Figures 42 and 4-3) was initially recorded by
archeologist R. L. Stephenson in
1949
prior
to
the
lakes
impoundment.
41CS19
is
described as an âopen occupation
areaâ located on a cultivated ridge
that sloped westward into slough
bottom lands (Texas Archeological
Data Site Form on file at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory
[TADSF-TARL]).
At
41CS19, Stephenson collected an
undetermined number of nonspecified ceramic sherds and
projectile points (TADSF-TARL).
Maps maintained at TARL depict
41CS19 as measuring 370 by 200
m and located on the western edge
of a peninsula that extends
northward into Lake Wright
Patman. 41CS19 is plotted along
the shoreline of Lake Wright
Patman with approximately 50%
on an elevated terrace and 50% on
shore or underwater. Vegetation on
the terrace consisted of mixed
hardwoods and pine.
Surface
visibility was 100% on the beach
and 10% on the terrace. Soils fell
within the Eastwood series. The
typical pedon for this soil type is
presented in Chapter 1.

Figure 4-2. Site Map, 41CS19.

No artifacts were observed on the
surface. A total of 17 shovel tests
were excavated in the site area but
no artifacts were present. Shovel
testing on the eastern terrace
suggests the landform has been

Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,070 Acres at Lake Wright Patman, Cass County, Texas

severely impacted by erosion with sterile Pleistocene clays generally occurring 5-10 cmbs. Cut
banks along the terrace edge were inspected with no artifacts encountered.
Site 41CS334
Site 41CS334 (ECOMM 70) is the newly discovered location of an early to mid twentieth century
homestead. The site is situated on an elevated terrace and measures 80 by 60 m (Figure 4-4).
This location is not indicated on the 1909 USGS topographic map by a structure symbol (see
Figure 2-1). Vegetation noted within the site included mixed hardwood and pine. Surface
visibility was approximately 10 percent. Soils fell within the Eastwood series; the typical pedon
for this soil type is presented in Chapter 1. The structure was evidently razed after the USACE
acquired the land in the mid twentieth century.
This tract, registered as Tract B-208, 55.70 acres of the Avis Johnson Headright Survey, first
appears in Cass County records on February 16, 1881, being conveyed by F.G. Wooten and his
wife, Ruth M. Wooten, to Cicero Smith. The deed mentions that Ruth Wooten acquired the tract
as her portion of the Ruben Moores estate. Ruth appears to be Rubenâs widow but Cass County
land records do not mention Ruben
Moores or Ruth Moores Wooten as
far back as 1835, nor do any
probates or affidavits of heirship.
It is possible that the earlier records
were lost or destroyed in one of
several courthouse fires.
On
October 7, 1893, Cicero Smith sold
159 acres containing this tract to
Frank Oliver for 24 bales of cotton.
The next record in the Cass County
title records is dated March 11,
1951 and conveys 55.7 acres from
Nancy Williams Pollard to the U.S.
Government.
Nancy Williams
Pollard was married twice, in 1900
to Peter Williams, who died during
the influenza epidemic in 1918, and
later to Will Pollard in 1927. The
gap in title between Frank Oliver
and Nancy Williams Pollard is
more problematic. No deed for this
tract from Oliver was located, nor
was the deed into Nancy Williams
Pollard located. She may have
inherited it directly from Frank
Oliver or she may have inherited it
from one of her husbands whom in
Figure 4-4. Site Map, 41CS334

Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,070 Acres at Lake Wright Patman, Cass County, Texas

turn had inherited it from a relative.
Alternatively she may simply have
not recorded the deed or it may
simply have been destroyed in one
of the courthouse fires. None of the
above persons is listed in the
Handbook of Texas Online.
One feature was observed on the
surface of the site during the
pedestrian survey. A 3 m diameter
depression (possibly a collapsed
well) was recorded in the western
portion of the site (Figure 4-5).
The circular depression was located
10 m west of a terrace and
appeared to be 1.5 m deep.

Figure 4-5. Circular Depression, 41CS334; facing
southwest.

A surface artifact inventory was
conducted in order to document the sites surface artifact assemblage and to help establish
boundaries. A total of 14 artifacts were observed on the surface including seven milk jugs, five
mason jars, two metal chamber pots and soda bottles (Table 4-2; Figure 4-6). Thirteen of the
surface artifacts had diagnostic makers marks (Table 4-3).
After analyzing the date of manufacture ranges for all diagnostic artifacts, the site appears to
have been occupied sometime within a 34 year time span between 1919 and 1953. The dates
correlate with the earliest possible manufacture date of a mason jar (1919) and the earliest
terminal date of manufacture on a half gallon milk jar (1953) (Table 4-3). In addition, the
presence of a Mission Beverages soda bottle manufactured in 1944 suggests the site was
occupied during mid twentieth century (Toulouse 1971; BLM 2007).

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

This cultural resources inventory investigated two parcels at Lake Wright Patman in Cass
County. The two parcels ranged in size from 520 acres (Sawmill Hill South) to 550 acres
(Sawmill Hill North), and the total area inventoried was 1,070 acres. Field methods included a
pedestrian inventory at 20 m intervals accompanied by excavation of 833 shovel tests. Shovel
tests were approximately 30 cm in diameter and were dug to either the clay horizon or to 80 cm
below the surface. Overall testing density for the project was 0.78 tests per acre (or, 1.3 acres
per test).
The inventory documented one new and one previously recorded archeological site. No intact
historic building or structure greater than 50 years old was present in any of the inventory areas.
Both sites are considered not eligible for the NRHP, and no further work is warranted (Table 51).

Site 41CS19 is a previously recorded prehistoric site. Seventeen shovel tests were excavated but
no cultural material encountered. No cultural material was encountered on the surface of
the site. Based on the overall lack of cultural resources and low site integrity, it is
unlikely that the site contains any potential to answer significant questions regarding
regional or local archeology. As a result, the site is evaluated as not eligible for inclusion
on the NRHP and no further work is warranted.
Site 41CS327 is the location of a razed mid twentieth century homestead. One feature was
observed on the surface during the pedestrian survey (possible collapsed well). Thirteen
shovel tests were excavated and cultural material was present in seven of the thirteen
(54% ubiquity), with fourteen artifacts (including two prehistoric flakes) recovered
between the surface and 80 cmbs. Due to the fact that historic artifacts were recovered at
the same depth (and below) as the two prehistoric flakes encountered during shovel
testing, the prehistoric component of the site has in all likelihood been impacted by either
historic era activities or when the site was razed by the USACE.
After analyzing the date of manufacture ranges for all diagnostic artifacts, the site appears to
have been occupied sometime within a 34 year time span (1919 - 1953). However, the presence
of a Mission Beverages soda bottle manufactured in 1944 strongly suggests the site was occupied

during mid twentieth century. Archival research indicated the site was not resided on and/or
owned by any historically significant individual that would warrant NRHP eligibility under
criterion (a). Based on the overall low integrity of deposits and the results attained from archival
research, the site is accessed as not eligible for nomination to the NRHP, and no further work is
warranted.
