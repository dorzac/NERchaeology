PROJECT DESCRIPTION

THE UNDERTAKING

The United States Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District (USACE) is responsible
for managing certain Federally owned lands in East Texas in association with lakes,
reservoirs and navigable waterways. These management responsibilities include 45,063
acres at Lake Wright Patman (acreages are outside conservation pools).
While planning and conducting undertakings that have the potential to affect historic
properties, the USACE must take such resources into account. Therefore, in compliance
with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 as amended
through 1992 (P.L. 89-665 et seq.), the current investigation was authorized by the
USACE to identify any archeological sites, buildings, structures, or other resources that
may be eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The
work was conducted on and all sites are located on lands owned by the Federal
Government and managed by the USACE.
Much of the USACE managed acreage at Lakes Wright Patman is forested by mature
pine and pine-hardwood stands. In conjunction with the existing management plans for
the reservoirs and in accordance with accepted silviculture methodologies, the USACE
has planned certain management areas for selective timber thinning at this lake.
Commercial thinning removes marketable trees in uneven-aged stands (not clear-cut)
through single tree selection. Removal of crop trees often disturbs the ground surface,
but extensive subsurface disturbance is not common.
1.2

LOCATION

The project area consists of two separate parcels totaling 166 acres at Lake Wright
Patman in Bowie County (Table 1-1). Lake Wright Patman is on the Sulphur River 18
km southwest of Texarkana in Bowie and Cass Counties (Figure 1-1). The far upstream
portions of the reservoir extend into Morris, Titus, and Red River Counties. Initially
known as Texarkana Reservoir, the lake was renamed in the late 1970s in honor of the
East Texas congressional representative (Breeding 2005). The dam was built between
1948 and 1957 for flood-control, conservation, and recreational purposes. Elevation of
the conservation pool typically varies seasonally; normal elevations are 220.6 ft above
mean sea level (AMSL) in winter and 227.5 ft. AMSL in summer. Flood storage capacity
is 259.5 ft. AMSL. During the summer, the lake can cover 33,750 acres; the normal
winter conservation pool is 20,300 acres.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT

The project is located in the Oak-Hickory-Pine Forest vegetation region of East Texas as
defined by Gould (1969). Forested areas in the project areas included secondary growth
and mature pine and pine-hardwood stands (Figures 1-3). Pine stands observed during
the field inventory were typically comprised of loblolly (Pinus taeda), shortleaf (Pinus
echinata), and longleaf (Pinus palustris) pines. Hardwood trees noted during the survey
included southern red oak (Quercus falcate), white oak (Quercus alba) and American
sycamore (Platanus occidentalis). Other representative hardwoods present in the area
include sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), bald cypress (Taxodium spp.), black
walnut (Juglans nigra L.), osage orange (Maclura pomifera), and Dahoon holly (Ilex
cassine).

The project is located within the Austroriparian biotic province as defined by Blair
(1950). Wildlife common to the area includes whitetail deer (Odocoileus virginianus),
red fox (Vulpes vulpes), bobcat (Felis rufus), grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), coyote
(Canis latrans), raccoon (Procyon lotor), opossum (Didelphus virginiana), wild hog (Sus
scrofa), nutria (Myocastor coypus), river otter (Lutra canadensis), and mink (Mustela
vison). Lake habitats support a variety of turtles, frogs and snakes, as well as largemouth

bass (Micropterus salmoides salmoides), flathead (Pylodictis olivaris) and channel
(Ictalurus punctatus) catfish, white (Pomoxis annularis) and black (Pomoxis nigromaculatus) crappie, white bass (Morone chrysops), bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), and
other sunfish. Bird species include the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides
borealis), as well as bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), osprey (Pandion haliaetus),
bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), mourning doves (Zenaida macroura), white pelicans
(Elecanus erythrorhynchos), common loons (Gavia immer), herons, and egrets.

BEDROCK GEOLOGY AND SOILS

The bedrock geology encountered within both project areas at Lake Wright Patman is
predominantly comprised of mostly silt and sandy clay deposits of Wilcox Group
undivided (Ewi) sediments that formed approximately 40-45 million years ago during the
Middle Eocene (Texas Commission on Environmental Quality [TCEQ] 2004; Sellards et
al. 1932:530). During this time period, the project area would have been located within a
shallow-water reef of the Kincaid Sea, which covered large areas of the North American
Southeast. Wilcox Group formations extend approximately 200 m in depth and rest on
upon an upper base of Midway Group deposits that date to the Early Eocene (Sellards et
al. 1932).
Within central Bowie County, a Miocene to Pliocene aged gravel formation called
âBowie Gravelsâ can sometimes be seen resting upon a base of Wilcox Group geologic
deposits in upland areas along the headwaters of Elliot Creek (Peter and Cliff 1990). The
fact that Bowie Gravels occur over Wilcox formations suggests the gravels are possibly
contemporaneous to Uvalde Gravels, which were deposited during the Miocene and
Pliocene epoch of the Tertiary (ca. 23.8 â 1.8 million years ago). These gravels offered a
readily available source of chert to the Native American populations of the area.
The two inventory parcels at Lake Wright Patman contain soil types that formed over
Wilcox Group (Ewi) deposits (USDA-SCS 2008). Cultural deposits in these soils are
generally shallowly buried and are adequately investigated by manual shovel testing. The
two Sawmill Hill inventory are dominated by Sawyer soils, with minor pockets of
Blevins, Woodtell, and Wrightsville-Rodessa soils (Table 1-2).

CULTURAL CONTEXT

PREVIOUS RESEARCH

The earliest archeological investigations in Northeast Texas were conducted in 1911 by
the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Science (Moore 1912). This early expedition
recorded and partially excavated several mound and habitation sites along the Red and
Sulphur Rivers. Before the impoundment of the Sulphur River, excavations were
conducted in Cass and Bowie Counties in the 1930s by the University of Texas, notably
by Jackson (1932), Pearce (1932), and Dickinson (1941). The first systematic
archeological surveys of the area began in the late 1940s along the Sulphur River of the
Texarkana Reservoir (later renamed Lake Wright Patman) by the Smithsonian Institution
River Basin Surveys (RBS) (Stephenson 1950). This study recorded 50 sites. These
early investigations were followed by the excavations by Jelks (1961) at the Snipes,
Knights Bluff, and Sherwin sites (41CS8, 41CS14, 41CS26).
Following impoundment, a shoreline survey of Lake Wright Patman was conducted in
1969 by Briggs and Malone (1970) who recorded or revisited some 140 sites on or near
government fee lands at Lake Wright Patman. Because the methodology of this
inventory was selective, the total acreage surveyed is not known.
Since 1995, numerous surveys have been conducted at Lake Wright Patman by GeoMarine, Inc. (see White et al. 1995; Cliff et al. 1996; Hunt and Cliff 1998a, 1998b; Cliff
and Hunt 1998; Burson and Cliff 2000; Hunt and Borrego 2002; Hunt et al. 2002), by LL
Consultants (see Linder-Linsley and Lindsay 1997, 1998), by Deep East Texas
Archeological Consultants and by the USACE (see Austin 2002, 2003a, 2003b, 2005).
These surveys totaled more than 11,300 acres and resulted in the documentation of 133
archeological sites. More recently, Ecological Communications Corporation (EComm)
has conducted a series of large scale inventories for the USACE in advance of timber
thinning undertakings (Trierweiler et al 2002; Trierweiler and Bonine 2004; Trierweiler
2004; Bonine and Trierweiler 2004; Trierweiler and Jones 2005; Jones and Trierweiler
2006a, 2006b, 2007). Including the current survey, EComm has inventoried 5,036 acres
at Lake Wright Patman and has documented 42 sites.
A small number of sites at Lake Wright Patman have been tested and/or subject to
excavations. The precise number of sites so investigated prior to and during the
construction of the lake is unknown due to incomplete and missing records. Some of the
early excavations include work at 41CS1 (Bryonsâ Mill Mound) in 1932 (Goldschmidt
1932), at 41CS8, 41CS10, and 41CS14 in the early 1950s (Jelks 1961), and at 41CS35 by
avocational archeologists in 1963 (Harris et al. 1980). Nearly all of the systematic
excavations were by the Texas Archeological Salvage Project (TASP) starting in 1958
under the direction of Edward Jelks. The TASP was directed through the University of
Texas at Austin with primary funding provided by the National Park Service. Site
41CS14 was also tested in 1997 and determined to be NRHP eligible (Perttula, et

Ecological Communications Corporation

al.1998). Finally, five sites were tested in 1998 to assess NRHP eligibility and were
determined not eligible (Owens and Hunt 1999).
2.2

PREVIOUSLY RECORDED SITES

EComm conducted a map and records search at the archives of the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL), the Texas Historical Commission (THC), and the THC
Atlas online database on March 18, 2008. These searches determined that neither of the
two current parcels contain any previously recorded archeological sites.
However, within one mile (1,600 m) of the inventory areas, 19 archeological sites have
been previously recorded. These include an historic homestead, an historic dump, eight
prehistoric lithic scatters, seven prehistoric campsites and two sites (41BW646,
41BW647) with both a historic and prehistoric component. Five of the prehistoric sites
contain Caddo ceramics (Table 2-1). Four of these sites were recorded by in 1949 during
the Smithsonian Institution River Basin Survey of the Texarkana Reservoir (later named
Lake Wright Patman) and 15 of the sites were recorded during surveys conducted by
Geo-Marine in 1994 and 1998. In addition, sites 41BW7 and 41BW28 were revisited by
Geo-Marine during the 1994 survey (Table 2-1).
2.3

CULTURAL HISTORICAL FRAMEWORK

The prehistoric cultural framework in the East Texas region includes the Paleo-Indian,
Archaic and Woodland periods, and periods of Caddo horticultural adaptation and has
been examined by numerous archeological investigations. The cultural framework
discussed further below has been adapted from Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993) and
Perttula (1993a, 1993b, 1995, 2004).
2.3.1

Paleo-Indian Period

Generally, there is a lack of data relating to the Paleo-Indian Period (ca. 9500 to 7000
B.C.) in East Texas. While many projectile points such as Clovis, Plainview, Dalton,
Scottsbluff, and San Patrice have been recovered, most were isolated, mixed, or surface
finds or found in excavations of later contexts (Perttula 2004). The distribution of
artifacts suggests that most sites occur within the valleys of major stream basins and
resource-rich areas.
Regardless of the paucity of evidence, generalizations have been made regarding
settlement mobility and subsistence patterns during the Paleo-Indian period in East
Texas. Evidence suggests that groups occupied small camps and used a generalized
toolkit, and that they were more likely to be highly mobile hunters and gatherers rather
than specialized large-game hunters (Perttula 2004).

Archaic Period

The Archaic period (ca. 7000-200 B.C.) is subdivided into the Early (ca. 7000-4000
B.C.), Middle (ca. 4000-2000 B.C.), and Late Archaic (ca. 2000-200 B.C.), although in
the East region of Texas, reliable dating is not yet available to unequivocally substantiate
these different periods. During the Early Archaic, sites are much smaller and more
widely distributed, suggesting high group mobility within large territories. Archeological
data also suggest a generalized hunting and gathering subsistence strategy focused on the
exploitation of a wide variety of resources. Although most Early Archaic sites are only
briefly used, they are apt to be concentrated in the larger drainage areas in the region
(Perttula 2004).
The Middle Archaic is characterized by considerably larger sites within major basins in
the region, a more diverse hunting toolkit, the use of ground and polished stone tools, and

the increased use of plant foods as indicated by grinding implements and burned rock
features. Possible hearths, ovens and burned rock concentrations in the region suggest
processing and cooking of plant resources was important (Perttula 2004).
Throughout East Texas, Late Archaic period sites are relatively common along major
streams and springs in the uplands and on tributary drainages. During the Late Archaic
population density may have peaked, as evidenced by the apparent increase in the number
of sites and greater distribution of sites over the landscape. The large number and
widespread distribution of sites also suggests limited group mobility, the possible use of
more defined territories, and regular exploitation of localized food resources (Perttula
2004).
2.3.3

Woodland/Early Ceramic Period

The Woodland Period (ca. 200 B.C. â A.D. 800) is not well defined but is largely
identified by plainware ceramics, tempered with clay/grog or bone, and Gary projectile
points. At sites near the Red River, artifact assemblages are largely made up of ceramics,
while at other sites in Northeast Texas, such as near the Sulphur and Sabine rivers,
ceramics are not as common. One explanation for this difference may be possible
regional differences in food processing and diet during this time period, all of which may
have an effect on the degree of sedentism between regions (Perttula 2004).
To date, archeological evidence suggests Woodland populations were hunters and
gatherers who lived in larger groups and settled for longer periods of time in certain
locations than they had in the Archaic period. In some cases, such as at the Ray site,
small settlements with structures and middens suggest a more concentrated occupation,
but these sites are not as permanent as those seen at later Caddo period sites in the region
(Perttula 2004). With the exception of the Sulphur and Neches-Angelina River Basins,
Woodland sites are not very common throughout much of Northeast Texas, but when
they occur, are represented by villages and hamlets in the floodplains or terraces of larger
streams, and by smaller components in the uplands. No Woodland period burial mounds
have been documented in the region.
2.3.4

Formative Caddoan Period and Early Caddoan Period

Sites dating to the Formative Caddoan Period (ca. A.D. 800-1000) and Early Caddoan
Period (ca. A.D. 1000-1200) are located primarily in the uplands just adjacent to major
streams and smaller tributaries and springs. Settlement locations with fertile soils and
good drainage were primarily chosen for habitation and cultivation of maize, squash and
native plants. Permanent settlements including structures, middens, pits, cemeteries, and
artifacts such as tools and ceramics were widespread. Common settlements in the region
include hamlets and farmsteads with rectangular and circular structures, many with
associated cemeteries. In addition to small farmsteads, larger communities such as the
George C. Davis site on the Neches River are also encountered. These large villages are
more common during the Early Caddoan Period and continue through the Middle
Caddoan period, and include large groups of many structures, mound centers, and elite

10

burial pits. Distinctive artifacts such as celts, ceramic pipes and earspools, and diversely
decorated ceramic bowls and jars are commonly recovered from Formative and Early
Caddoan sites (Perttula 2004).
2.3.5

Middle Caddoan Period

Most archeological sites in Northeast Texas date to the Middle Caddoan Period (ca. A.D.
1200-1400). These sites continue the trend of diverse ceramic artifacts and larger
settlements with multiple mounds seen at the end of the Early Caddoan Period. One
example of such a site is the Oak Hill Village (41RK214), a large village with mounds,
middens, and public structures. Cultivation of maize and squash continued, but there is no
evidence of dependence on maize and other crops until after A.D. 1300 (Perttula 2004).
2.3.6

Late Caddoan Period

Archeological sites that date to the Late Caddoan Period (ca. AD 1400-1680) are
abundant in Northeast Texas. Late Caddoan sites are predominantly found in river basins
such as the Red, Cypress Creek, and Neches River basins. Smaller groups of sites are
present in the Angelina, Attoyac, middle and upper Sabine, and lower Cypress Bayou
basins. Most Late Caddoan Period archeological sites are either large permanent
communities, or smaller farmsteads, both with associated cemeteries. Late Caddoan
period earthen mounds were constructed and primarily used between A.D. 1400-1540,
except in the Red River, where mound construction and mound shaft burials continued
until 1650 or 1700 (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993). Stable isotope and bioarcheological
evidence from the region indicate that at this time Caddo peoples were heavily dependent
on maize as their main dietary staple.
The Late Caddoan Titus Phase (ca. A.D. 1430-1680) refers to the archeological remains
of Caddoan peoples living in the northeastern Texas pineywoods between the Sulphur
and Sabine rivers. These Caddos lived in a hierarchical and elite-controlled society.
They constructed both small settlements with family cemeteries and large settlements
with status-ranked community cemeteries, and made culturally distinct and diverse
ceramics. Titus phase sites usually are found on valley terraces and upland slopes,
projections, and basins, and permanent settlements are usually located near freshwater
springs (Perttula 2004).
The period after which European contact occurred (ca. A.D. 1540) is commonly referred
to as the Protohistoric period. In 1542, the De Soto-Moscoso entrada entered the region
from the Mississippi river valley and a number of different Caddoan groups were
probably encountered by Spanish explorers. Within 100 to 150 years after the entrada,
the area occupied by the Titus phase Caddo was mostly abandoned (Perttula 2004).
While the archeological evidence of Caddoan-Spanish contact is sparse in Northeast
Texas, intermittent contact probably had considerable effects on Caddoan groups,
including exposure to a variety of infectious diseases like smallpox to which they had no
immunity (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993).

2.3.7

Historic Period

The Historic Caddoan period (ca. AD 1680-1860) is defined as the sustained European
presence in and occupation of the Caddoan area by Europeans in the region. It is during
this time period that the Caddo and all other Native American groups except the Alabama
and Coushatta were eventually moved from Texas to the Indian Territory. Most Historic
Caddoan settlements in the region were small farmsteads and hamlets with associated
household cemeteries. Communities were composed of many of these farmsteads spread
out over large territories. Artifacts recovered from these sites include a wide variety of
Caddoan ceramics, basketry, ornaments, and bone, stone, and wooden tools. European
goods are commonly found on Historic Caddoan sites after ca. A.D. 1740 and include
guns and gun parts, glass beads, and metal items such as kettles, hatchets, knives, hoes,
lead balls, and silver, brass, and copper ornaments (Kenmotsu and Perttula, 1993).
The first likely European expedition into the area around Lake Wright Patman was led by
Luis de Moscoso Alvarado in 1542. Moscoso was a member of the Hernando de Soto
expedition into the southeastern U.S. and took over after he died. Looking for an
overland route back to New Spain, Moscoso crossed into the territory that became Bowie
County and used existing trails established by the Caddo to move further into the interior
of Texas before turning around and traveling back to the coast (Bruseth and Kenmotsu
1993). French visitors to the area included Henri Jountel, who was part of the LaSalle
expedition, and Henri de Tonti, who went to the area to look for survivors from Fort St.
Louis (Harper 2005b). Permanent European presence began in 1719, when Le Poste des
Cadodaquious was established by the French at a location just to the northwest of
Texarkana. Although a fort in name, the establishment served more as a trading station
and supply base for further expeditions. The fort was abandoned a few years after the
Louisiana cession to Spain in 1762. The fort was reestablished in 1770 by the Spanish,
under the name San Luiz de los Cadodachos, but the Nasoni tribes with whom they were
trying to foster a relationship left the area soon after (Britton 2005). Finally, the
Americans explored the area in 1806 when the Red River Expedition, launched by
Thomas Jefferson, traveled up the Red River to Spanish Bluff where they were forced to
turn back by Spanish soldiers.
Immigration and settlement of the areas that would become Bowie and Cass Counties
began in the 1820s and 1830s. Both Anglo-Americans and members of the Shawnee,
Delaware, and Kickapoo Indians settled there, but the Native American tribes moved on
within ten years. By 1846, the establishment of separate counties had been made and
county lines had been resolved. The white settlers were primarily from the South and set
up slave-operated cotton plantations in addition to raising corn, hogs, and some cattle.
Just before the Civil War, the slave population outnumbered the white population in
Bowie County and numbered just under half in Cass County (Harper 2005a; Harper
2005b). As was expected, the white population strongly supported the secession
movement and the Confederate war effort. Although no battle took place in the area,
federal troops occupied Bowie County in 1867 on behalf of the Freedmenâs Bureau to
assist black residents in obtaining their legal and political equality. This enflamed white

residents, who had lost much of their capital once the slaves were freed, and they secretly
supported anti-black movements such as Cullen Bakerâs gang and the Ku Klux Klan.
By the 1870s, the Texas and Pacific Railway was being built and several towns sprouted
up in the area. Texarkana was founded in 1873, at the site of an abandoned Caddo
village, where two major railroads would soon meet (Chandler and Howe 1939). It
immediately became the largest trading and manufacturing center in the area. Maud was
formed in 1870. Atlanta was founded in 1871, and it, along with Douglassville, was an
economic center for the surrounding rural community (Hazlewood 2005; Harper 2005c).
In 1902 the Northeast Texas Railroad Company was chartered as a common carrier.
Previously it had been operated as a private logging railroad known as the Munz
Railroad. The line crossed the Sulphur River and extended 18.6 miles (30 km) from
Redwater in Bowie County to Munz in Cass County, about 4 miles (6.4 km) northeast of
Marietta (Reed 1941:462). The region remained primarily rural with an agricultural and
timbering economy, but small manufacturing firms also employed some of the local
population. The Depression had a devastating effect on the area, but World War II
brought the establishment of the Red River Army Depot and the Lone Star Army
Ammunition Plant, which increasingly employed many of the local residents from that
point forward (Harper 2005a). Changes in the economic market drew many people away
from farming and into manufacturing and trade; however, populations grew slowly, if at
all, and the inhabitants remained relatively poor. Lake Wright Patman was completed in
1957 and provided recreation facilities as well as flood control measures.

METHODS

The archeological field inventory was conducted over a period of four workdays between
April 1-4, 2008, with a total of 12 person-days being spent in the field. Methods and
density of shovel testing complied with, or exceeded, the minimum requirements for field
tactics stipulated by the USACE for archeological inventories in east Texas (USACE
2007:39-51).
3.1

SURVEY TACTICS

For each parcel, a logistical plan was prepared in advance with transect lines indicated at
20 m intervals on aerial photographs. Each field archeologist was given a copy of the
aerial and was assigned a transect line and a targeted number of shovel tests. Transect
lines were designated with an alpha prefix and individual shovel tests along each transect
line were numbered, so that shovel test G-5 identified the fifth test along the seventh
transect (Transect G). In general, each crewmember followed his/her own transect,
walking in parallel with the other crewmembers. Occasionally, for logistical reasons, two
crewmembers doubled up with one person digging the shovel tests and another screening
and recording the field forms, or two crew members would âleapfrogâ along one transect,
each digging alternating shovel tests. While approximately even coverage was
attempted, surveyors deviated from transect alignments in order to test high probability
locations. Tests were selectively placed on landforms shown by previous research to be
preferred site locations, such as ridgelines, knolls, and promontories. Areas of obvious
deep disturbance, such as bulldozing, were noted on the field maps and were excluded
from shovel testing. Similarly, areas that were completely inundated were excluded from
transect coverage, including low swampy areas, ponds, and all areas underneath current
lake levels.
Recent debris, such as aluminum beer cans and plastic detritus, was commonly observed.
No further attention was paid to such items clearly less than 50 years old.
At all positive shovel tests and at selected other tests, GPS readings were taken to verify
transect and shovel test locations. All shovel tests were 30 to 35 cm in diameter. All
tests were dug to the bottom of the Holocene deposits as indicated by clay, or to 80 cm
below ground surface if no clay or the water table was present. Tests were individually
recorded with regard to depth, soil type and color, and cultural material present. Tests
were dug in natural stratigraphic levels not exceeding 20 cm in thickness and all
excavated material was screened through Â¼-inch (6.4 mm) mesh.
All cultural material within shovel tests was collected with the exception of recent objects
such as bottle glass shards, nails, and aluminum pop-tabs. These were assumed to
indicate recent disturbance and were not collected. At the remaining sites, only
diagnostic material and sample collections were recovered due to high artifact quantities
of the surface artifacts. All shovel tests were backfilled.

Each positive shovel test was further investigated by excavating additional shovel tests in
the immediate vicinity at 5 to 15 m distances for up to six tests in an area. If more than
one of these tests were positive or if more than two artifacts were found in any single test,
then the location was designated as a site. Otherwise, the positive test was designated as
an isolated occurrence. The coordinates of isolates were plotted and the artifacts were
collected, but these were not further recorded. The recorded locations of previously
recorded sites were similarly investigated using multiple shovel tests. On each site a
permanent site datum was established using a 12-inch iron re-bar fixed with an aluminum
survey tag. Tags were stamped with âECOMM 2008â and with a temporary site number for
newly recorded sites.
Site boundaries were delineated by excavating multiple shovel tests in the area to identify
zones of zero or low artifact presence. Generally, these were in cardinal directions from
the initial positive test, unless topography suggested an alternative tactic. Site boundaries
were defined on the basis of subsurface artifact distribution, complemented by surface
artifacts and features (where present), topography, soil exposures, and other relevant
criteria. Based on the distribution of negative shovel tests or absence of surface artifacts,
site boundaries were prominently marked with fluorescent pink flagging tape. Sites were
photographed, sketched and mapped, and all site data were recorded onto State of Texas
site data forms. Artifacts, notes and records will be curated at TARL.
Appendix A presents USGS topographic maps of each survey parcel showing the
locations of all transects and shovel tests.
3.2

DENSITY OF SHOVEL TESTING

The contractual scope of work issued by the USACE specified that at a minimum one
shovel test per acre was to be excavated. Using this rate of coverage, a minimum of 166
shovel tests was required to inventory the two parcels. In sum, 214 shovel tests were
dug, or 48 more than the required minimum. Shovel testing density was 1.9 tests per acre
at the Experimental Forest parcel and 1.10 tests per acre at the Thompson Creek parcel.
For the project as a whole, final coverage was 1.3 tests per acre (Table 3-1).

RESULTS

One-hundred and sixty-six acres were inventoried within the two parcels. In the
Experimental Forest parcel, no archeological sites were found and in the Thompson
Creek parcel, one archeological site was recorded. Locations of transects and shovel tests
are depicted in Appendix A. Site locations are shown on USGS topographic quadrangles
in Appendix B and completed State of Texas site forms are presented in Appendix C.
4.1

EXPERIMENTAL FOREST

The Experimental Forest inventory area totaled 38 acres and was inventoried using 73
shovel tests for a net density of 1.9 shovel tests per acre. Locations of shovel tests are
plotted on USGS topographic maps in Appendix A. Twelve shovel tests were excavated
above the 280 ft contour (2.3 tests per acre); 52 tests were excavated between the 270 and
280 ft contours (1.8 per acre); nine tests were excavated below the 270 ft contour (2.3 per
acre). All shovel tests were negative and no cultural resource sites are present within the
parcel. Approximately 60 percent (23 acres) of the parcel was comprised of linear stands
of loblolly pine that were planted by the Texas Forest Service between 1986-87 (M.
Seavey, personal communication, 2008) (Figure 4-1). The remainder of the project area
was comprised of mixed (non-planted) stands of loblolly and pine.

THOMPSON CREEK

The Thompson Creek area totaled 128 acres and was inventoried using 141 shovel tests
for a density of 1.1 shovel tests per acre. Locations of shovel tests are plotted on a USGS
topographic map in Appendix A. Nine shovel tests were excavated above the 280 ft
contour (1.5 tests per acre); 34 tests were excavated between the 270 and 280 ft contours
(1.1 per acre); 36 tests were excavated between the 260 and 270 ft contours (1.1 per
acre); 62 tests were excavated below the 260 ft contour (1.0 tests/acre).
One prehistoric site was discovered within the project area.
Site 41BW753
Site 41BW753 is the newly discovered location of a prehistoric campsite that contains a
ceramic component that dates to the Caddoan period. Vegetation noted within the site
included mixed hardwood and pine (Figure 4-2) and surface visibility was approximately
10 percent. The site is situated on an elevated terrace located east and adjacent to the
Thompson Creek drainage and measures 120 by 98 m (Figure 4-3). Soils fell within the
Woodtell series; the typical pedon for this soil type is described above in Chapter 1.

The site was discovered at the location of shovel test 12c-2, when a secondary flake was
returned from 40-60 cmbs. Twelve additional shovel tests were excavated for a total of
13 tests (Table 4-1). Artifacts were recovered from six of the 13 tests for a net artifact
ubiquity measure of 46 percent. The total assemblage consists of eight items. These
were three lithic flakes, three core fragments, and two prehistoric ceramic sherds.
Most of the artifacts were returned from the upper 20 cm, but material was present to 60
cmbs. The site appears to be a single depositional component. All lithic material was
manufactured from brown and red chert. No bone, or groundstone items were present
and no evidence of features was observed. Sterile clay and/or the water table was
encountered at depths between 20-60 cmbs.
Examination of the two sherds from 41BW753 found that the temper and vessel thickness
were indicative of Caddo utility wares. Both sherds are approximately 20 mm in size
with grog temper. The sherd from ST 2 (40-60 cmbs) is 8 mm thick, has a smoothed
exterior, and has a completely reduced cross-section. The sherd from ST 3 (0-20 cmbs)
is eroded and is missing the interior surface. The cross-section has a reduced exterior and
an oxidized core. The grog inclusions are roughly 0.5 mm in size. On the exterior are
two shallow, parallel, incised lines spaced 7 mm apart.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

This cultural resources inventory investigated two parcels totaling 166 acres at Lake
Wright Patman in Bowie County, Texas. Field methods included a pedestrian inventory
at 20 m intervals accompanied by excavation of 214 shovel tests. Shovel tests were
approximately 30 cm in diameter and were dug to either the clay horizon/water table or to
80 cm below the surface. Overall testing density for the project was 1.3 tests per acre.
No intact historic building or structure greater than 50 years old was present in any of the
inventory areas, but one newly discovered archeological site was recorded. Site
41BW753 is a newly recorded prehistoric campsite situated on an elevated terrace located
east and adjacent to the Thompson Creek drainage in the southwestern portion of the
Thompson Creek parcel. The overall site size is estimated as 120 m by 98 m. Thirteen
shovel tests were excavated and artifacts were recovered from six of the 13 tests.
Vertical distribution of artifacts suggests one intact component between 0-60 cmbs.
Eight artifacts were recovered including three lithic flakes, three core fragments, and two
Caddo utility ware sherds. The presence of Caddo ceramics is suggestive of a habitation
but based on the limited shovel testing tactics employed during the surface inventory, the
overall character of the site and its research potential remains uncertain. Consequently,
the NRHP eligibility of the site is therefore also uncertain. EComm recommends that the
site be avoided until additional investigations can test the research potential and NRHP
eligibility of the site.
