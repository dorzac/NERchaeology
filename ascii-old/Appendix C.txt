INTRODUCTION

This document presents recommendations for treatment of archeological and
historical resources in connection with the HemisFair Internal Streets (East Nueva and
Water Streets) Improvements project (Figure 1). The work was done by Prewitt and
Associates, Inc., for Adams Environmental, Inc., and the City of San Antonio under WO
44-2014-08-18. Archeological fieldwork that will be done on the project in the future will
be accomplished under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 6846. The recommendations
presented here are based on review of the design plans dated September 2014, prepared
for the City of San Antonio, Department of Transportation and Capital Improvements.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The project will consist of construction of East Nueva Street along the old
alignment of Goliad Street for a distance of 785 ft southeast of South Alamo Street and
Water Street along its old alignment northeast of East Cesar Chavez Boulevard for a
distance of 569 ft. The East Nueva Street right of way will be 50 ft wide in the middle of
the project and wider at the northwest and southeast ends. The Water Street right of
way will be 40 ft wide for most of its length, increasing where it meets Cesar Chavez
Boulevard. These streets are being designed and constructed as an initial phase of the
HemisFair redevelopment project to provide access and a gateway to the development.
The roads are designed as low-speed park roads for multipurpose use by vehicles,
pedestrians, and bicyclists. The concrete and paver roadways will be 20 ft wide and lined
with a series of bollards adjacent to flush curbs. Concrete pavers will be installed along
the roads to allow space for pedestrians and some vehicular parking. Sidewalk widths
will vary from 6 to 12 ft. Also included in the project will be construction of a temporary
emergency service drive (ca. 180 ft long and 10–16 ft wide) off of South Alamo Street
south of East Nueva Street and the east part of a fire access lane (ca. 100 ft long and 20
ft wide within a 40-ft right of way; the western 120 ft of the fire access lane will be built
as part of the Yanaguana Garden project) off of Water Street. With the exception of
moving the West Berlin Bear sculpture, no improvements are proposed for historic
properties in the project area, which will be protected with fencing during construction.
Existing trees will be preserved and supplemented with additional trees and storm
water planters. In addition to the street construction, an underground storm drainage
system will be installed with the storm water planter system. Existing and proposed
utility work will include underground domestic water, sanitary sewer, natural gas,
electric services, and communications services. The total horizontal area of potential
effects will be 2.05 acres.
The project will involve removal of a variety of nonhistoric features: concrete
curbs, paving (brick, concrete, and asphalt), sidewalks, bollards at four locations,
entrance
archways
on
South
Alamo
Street,
benches,
bike
racks,
lamps/wiring/foundations, statuary, a fountain with apron and piping, landscaping, a

1

clock tower, trees, signs, and parking lot gates. Most disturbance should extend no
deeper than 1–2 ft, but deeper disturbance could be associated with removal of larger
features, such as the entrance archways, fountain, and clock tower. This deeper
disturbance likely would impact only deposits already disturbed during original
construction of these features. The Solis house, moved to its current location at the East
Nueva-Water Streets intersection in 1967, will be removed. As noted below, the Solis
house was recently delisted from the National Register of Historic Places and as a State
Antiquities Landmark.
In general, roadway and sidewalk construction and placement of associated
landscaping are expected to disturb only the upper 1–2 ft. Activities such as installation
of signage, lighting, and bollards could result in deeper impacts in places, but these
impacts would be localized and of limited extent. The most intrusive impacts will occur
during installation of numerous buried utilities.
A 24-inch storm drain will be beneath almost the full length (673 ft) of East
Nueva Street, at a depth of 12–14 ft. It will have six shallow trench drains (216 linear ft)
feeding 8-inch outfall lines that lead to six 5x5-ft junction boxes at depths of 2–3 ft. A 36inch storm drain, transitioning to a 48-inch drain at its southwest end, will be beneath
the full length of Water Street at a depth of 17 ft. Three 24–36-inch laterals (ca. 115
linear ft) running along existing drain lines will join it from the northwest. Seven storm
water planter boxes (178 linear ft) with associated shallow trench drains will feed into
two of four 6x6- and 5x5-ft junction boxes at depths of 7–8 ft.
The San Antonio Water System (SAWS) plans to install 883 ft of 12-inch water
line and 19 ft of 8-inch water line at a minimum depth of 4 ft along East Nueva Street
from South Alamo Street to Water Street and to remove an existing water line over
approximately the same distance. In addition, 10 smaller service lines totaling ca. 264
linear ft will be added. SAWS plans to install 200 ft of 8–12-inch sanitary sewer line and
185 ft of 2–6-inch sewer laterals at a depth of about 7 ft along East Nueva Street at and
west of Water Street.
CPS Energy (CPS) plans to install ducts for multiple electric lines at depths of
10–14 ft along the full length of both East Nueva and Water Streets and for ca. 140 ft
along the east side of South Alamo Street south of East Nueva Street (5–10 ft deep). In
addition, about 400 ft of laterals will be added at depths of 4–11 ft. CPS also will install
a new 4–8-inch gas line and associated laterals at depths of 3.5–12.5 ft along the full
length of East Nueva Street and on Water Street north of East Nueva Street. In concert
with the CPS electric ducts, the San Antonio Information Technology Service
Department (ITSD), AT&T, and Time Warner Cable (TWC) will install ducts for
communications lines. The ITSD and TWC ducts will extend the full length of East
Nueva Street at a depth of 6–10 ft, with the TWC duct continuing along Water Street
south of East Nueva Street (5 ft deep); there will be about 120 ft of TWC laterals as well.
The AT&T duct will run the full lengths of both East Nueva and Water Streets (4–9 ft
depth), with about 170 ft of laterals.

EXISTING IMPACTS

Both of the proposed streets replicate street locations that were extant before
HemisFair ’68 was developed. East Nueva Street will be on the route of old Goliad
Street, which was established early in the eighteenth century to connect San Antonio
with Presidio La Bahia at Goliad, Texas. Reconstructed Water Street will be on its
original location; period maps indicate it was established by the 1850s or 1860s near the
southeast edge of San Antonio. Since they align with old roads, both corridors have
experienced the kinds of impacts typically associated with road construction and
maintenance, first as unpaved roads and later as paved ones. In general, these impacts
should not have extended far below the original ground surface, except perhaps where a
bridge (or maybe multiple consecutive bridges) on Goliad Street spanned the Acequia
Madre. Construction associated with HemisFair ’68 and subsequent demolition of
temporary HemisFair ’68 buildings and features likely caused more extensive and
deeper impacts (see Figures 2–4). It is hard to quantify these impacts, but boreholes and
archeological trenching in areas adjacent to the proposed streets indicate they are
blanketed with 1.5–3.0 ft of fill and construction debris; similar quantities of fill are
expected in the current project area.
Additional impacts are associated with placement of buried utilities, particularly
along East Nueva Street, which is a utilities corridor (Figure 5). The project plans
provide the following approximate inventory within the proposed right of way along East
Nueva Street: 1 gas line with 1 lateral crossing the street (4–6 ft deep); 1 main
communications line with at least 9 laterals and a secondary line for a short distance at
the extreme north edge (1–5 ft deep); 3 main electric lines with at least 8 laterals (1–4 ft
deep); 4 main water lines with at least 22 laterals (4–8 ft deep); 4 storm drains crossing
the road (5–15 ft deep); and 1 main sanitary sewer line with 6 laterals (5–8 ft deep).
Buried utilities in the proposed right of way on Water Street are: 2 main storm drains
with 4 laterals (6–14 ft deep); 3 electric lines (4–5 ft deep); 3 water lines (5–8 ft deep); 1
sanitary sewer line (6 ft deep); and 1 communications line (5 ft deep). The proposed
temporary emergency service drive (2 electric lines) and fire access lane (1 storm drain; 2
telephone lines; 1 electric line; and 6 water lines) have fewer buried utilities.
ARCHEOLOGICAL RESOURCES RECOMMENDATIONS

There are four recorded archeological sites partly or wholly within the right of
way of the internal streets project: 41BX8 (Acequia Madre), the documented portion of
which is immediately south of the East Nueva Street corridor; 41BX589 (the Smith
house) at the southwest corner of the intersection of East Nueva and Water Streets;
41BX590 (the Solis house) relocated in 1967 to where Water Street meets East Nueva
Street; and 41BX1299, which is a remnant of the foundation of an 1860s house found in
1997 during trenching associated with expansion of the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention
Center (Figure 6). Site 41BX589 is a designated State Antiquities Landmark, and
41BX590 was recently de-designated. Only 41BX8 (eligible) and 41BX1299 (ineligible)
have eligibility determinations in the Texas Historical Commission’s Archeological Sites
3

Atlas. Site 41BX8 is also a Recorded Texas Historical Landmark and a National Historic
Civil Engineering Landmark. The proposed project could impact three of these sites, but
one (41BX1299) is an ineligible site that likely was destroyed during previous
construction. Another (41BX590, the Solis house) formerly had a designation that
referred only to the relocated building and not to any associated archeological deposit;
hence, it does not warrant further archeological attention. The third site that could be
impacted is 41BX8 (Acequia Madre); it is discussed in more detail below.
The right of way for this project bisects 41BX589 (the Smith house). This small
house probably was built after Samuel Smith purchased the property in 1857 (Fox and
Cox 1990:25). Limited archeological work was done there in 1989, when a backhoe
trench was excavated ca. 20 ft from the building’s east side and two test pits were placed
adjacent to its south wall. These excavations showed that the 1989 ground surface
immediately around the house approximated the premodern surface (suggesting that
cultural features could be preserved), but they did not expose any features and yielded
few artifacts. Project plans indicate that the footprint of the house will not be impacted.
Areas adjacent to the east side of the house and its northeast corner will be impacted,
however, by removal of existing paving and placement of new concrete pavers, 3
planters, 2 light poles, 14 bollards, the CPS Energy electric duct, the AT&T duct, and the
TWC duct. Any near-surface archeological features associated with 41BX589 in this area
probably have been disturbed by previous construction, but it is possible that deeper
features could remain intact. Thus, archeological monitoring is recommended for the
more-intrusive construction activities close to the building.
The East Nueva Street corridor crosses the route of the Acequia Madre (41BX8)
at approximately Station 17+55, just northwest of the Amaya house. The acequia
supplied water to irrigate agricultural fields associated with Mission San Antonio de
Valero from the 1720s until 1793, when the surrounding land was subdivided for
settlement (Fox and Cox 1990:1). The area was subdivided again into building lots in the
latter half of the 1800s and was used mostly for residential and some commercial
purposes until the late 1960s when HemisFair ’68 altered the landscape. The acequia
originally was an unlined ditch, but probably in the mid 1800s, contemporaneous with
increased development of this part of San Antonio, it was improved with a limestone
block lining. No longer necessary as a water distribution system, the acequia was
intentionally filled in the early twentieth century.
Site 41BX8 has been investigated archeologically on four occasions. In 1966,
Schuetz (1970) exposed and removed the fill from a 95-ft-long, partially preserved, rocklined segment so that it could be integrated into one of the HemisFair ’68 pavilions; the
north end of this segment was about 50 ft southwest of the right of way for the internal
streets project. This excavation determined that the rock walls of the acequia extended
5.2 ft below the ground surface and that the ditch was 6.3 ft wide. The limestone block
walls were 10–14 inches thick. The bottom of the acequia was not lined with rocks. In
1983–1984, Fox (1985) dug two trenches in a search for the acequia south of the segment
documented by Schuetz; one of these trenches identified the intact east wall of the
acequia beneath introduced fill, and the other trench did not encounter acequia remains.
In 1989, Fox and Cox (1990) expanded on Fox’s earlier work by excavating six trenches

4

to look for the portion of the acequia south of the segment documented by Schuetz. All
six trenches exposed the filled acequia beneath introduced fill, and five of them
contained remains of the east wall of the ditch. The four trenches closest to Schuetz’s
excavations were used, along with the results of the 1966 work, to reconstruct the
segment of the acequia that is there today. Finally, in August 2014 as part of the
Yanaguana Garden project, Prewitt and Associates, Inc., excavated four trenches to look
for buried remnants of the acequia between the existing reconstructed segment and
Cesar Chavez Boulevard (Fields 2014a). Two of these trenches found the preserved lower
east wall below about 3 ft of disturbed fill, and a third one exposed what appeared to be
the bottom of the acequia ditch, but no rock walls, below 4.6 ft of disturbed fill.
Whether the internal streets project will impact 41BX8 depends on if any parts of
this feature survived disturbance from construction and maintenance of Goliad Street,
construction during HemisFair ’68 and demolition after it, subsequent construction in
HemisFair Park, and placement of buried utilities. It is improbable that any nearsurface parts of it remain, but some lower wall sections and areas of trash-filled ditch
may be still present. The construction activity most likely to impact such deeper remains
is placement of new utility lines. Project plans indicate that the following new utilities
will be within the East Nueva Street right of way in the vicinity of Station 17+55: (1) a
24-inch storm drain at a maximum depth of 14 ft below the current ground surface; (2)
a 12-inch water line at a depth of 6 ft; (3) a 12-inch sanitary sewer line at a depth of 5 ft;
(4) ducts for electric and communications (ITSD, AT&T, and TWC) lines at 9–10 ft below
the surface; and (5) an 8-inch gas line at 5 ft below the surface. Ideally, archeological
trenching would be done here (after removal of existing paving) to investigate the
possibility of preserved acequia remnants, but the presence of so many existing buried
utilities makes such trenching impractical (Figure 7). Thus, archeological monitoring is
recommended instead.
Ten other recorded sites, in addition to 41BX589 discussed above, are adjacent to
the project area (see Figure 6): 41BX575 (the Schultze store), 41BX576 (the SweeneyTynan house), 41BX577 (the Schultze house), and 41BX578 (the Halff house) are on the
north side of the East Nueva Street corridor along its western half; 41BX585 (the AcostaHalff house) and 41BX586 (the Kampmann-Halff house) are on the south side of East
Nueva Street; 41BX579 (the Kusch house) is on the northeast corner of the intersection
of East Nueva and Water Streets; and 41BX592 (the Koehler house), 41BX593 (the
Espinoza house), and 41BX982 (the Heubaum house foundation) are on the west side of
Water Street just north of Cesar Chavez Boulevard. All of these date to the nineteenth
century; 8 are houses, 1 is a house foundation, and 1 is a commercial building. All but
41BX982 are State Antiquities Landmarks; none have eligibility determinations in the
Texas Historical Commission’s Archeological Sites Atlas. All of these resources are
evident on the 1896 and 1912 Sanborn Fire Insurance Company maps, and all but
41BX982 are outside the internal streets project right of way. No archeological
investigations associated with the 9 extant buildings are recommended. Project plans
indicate that one corner of 41BX982, just north of where Water Street will intersect
Cesar Chavez Boulevard, could be impacted by placement of concrete pavers, although
this activity is likely to have only shallow impacts. Nonetheless, archeological
monitoring of construction activities in this area is recommended.

5

The 1896 and 1912 Sanborn maps indicate several locations within the proposed
right of way that could contain unrecorded historic archeological sites (Figure 8). Two
houses are present flanking 41BX1299 on the 1912 map at the northwest corner of East
Nueva and Water Streets, but monitoring during construction trenching here in 1997
yielded no archeological evidence of these houses (Tennis and Cox 1998). Further, the
eastern house coincides partly with the location of a large fountain, the construction of
which in 1988 probably caused substantial subsurface disturbance. Nonetheless,
archeological monitoring of construction activities in this area is recommended.
A corner of another house on both Sanborn maps is at the north edge of the right
of way not far west of the acequia crossing, which now is a paved area near the clock
tower. This very small area probably is too disturbed to contain any intact remains of the
house, since it is adjacent to part of the convention center and a now-demolished
HemisFair ’68 temporary building was in this location. No archeological investigation is
recommended.
The Sanborn maps show several buildings fronting on South Alamo Street and
associated outbuildings at the west edge of the East Nueva Street corridor and a house
facing Goliad Street just east of there. This area currently is the main entrance to
HemisFair Park. Given the history of HemisFair- and post-HemisFair-related
construction along South Alamo Street, including erection and demolition of a large
HemisFair ’68 temporary building that covered much of this area, the area likely has
been disturbed extensively. This is supported by the fact that two recent boreholes
nearby both found ca. 3 ft disturbed fill. Nonetheless, archeological monitoring of
construction activities in this area is recommended.
Extending east from South Alamo Street at the south edge of this area is the
temporary emergency service drive. The Sanborn maps indicate that it skirts a house
that faced South Alamo Street before transecting an outbuilding location and then a
house that faced Goliad Street. Intact remains of these buildings may not be preserved,
however, for the same reasons presented above. Further, archeological trenching in
advance of construction of the emergency service drive that this temporary one will
connect to found 2–5 ft of disturbed fill and no evidence of the house facing Goliad Street
(Fields 2014b). Nonetheless, archeological monitoring of construction activities in this
area is recommended.
The final area with the potential for an unrecorded historic archeological site is in
the Water Street fire access lane. Both Sanborn maps indicate that a house was very
close to Water Street here. Construction of the existing parking lot disturbed the area, as
did construction and demolition of a HemisFair ’68 temporary building that covered the
front half of the house and placement of various buried utilities (see Figure 5), but it is
possible that intact features related to this house could be present. Archeological
monitoring is recommended.
In sum, most of the Internal Streets Improvements project area does not warrant
further archeological attention for the following reasons: (1) all or almost all of the area

6

has been thoroughly disturbed to a depth of 2–5 ft or more, particularly within the East
Nueva Street corridor, making it highly improbable that intact near-surface
archeological remains are present; (2) there is a very low likelihood of buried Native
American archeological sites, given that it is a geologically ancient setting; and (3) most
of the area has a low likelihood of historic archeological sites, given that the main
components of the project are within old street alignments where historic features
should be absent.
The only places considered to be sensitive archeologically are where the East
Nueva Street corridor crosses the route of the Acequia Madre and six locations where the
project area impinges on improvements evident on the 1896 or 1912 Sanborn Fire
Insurance Company maps (Figure 9). Because all of these are already disturbed to some
degree and the impacts will be shallow in many places, however, the likelihood of the
project encountering intact, important archeological remains is considered low overall.
The single exception may be the new buried utility lines beneath East Nueva Street at
the Acequia Madre, although this area has many existing buried utilities that have
caused much disturbance. Despite the disturbance, archeological monitoring of
construction in these seven areas is considered prudent and thus is recommended.
HISTORICAL RESOURCES RECOMMENDATIONS

Historic properties in the immediate vicinity of the project area are Beethoven
Hall, Schultze Store, Federal Exhibit Hall, West Berlin Bear sculpture, Acequia Madre,
and the Sweeney-Tynan, Schultze, Halff, Acosta-Halff, Kampmann-Halff, Amaya, Smith,
Koehler, Espinoza, and Kusch houses (Figure 10). Each of these resources is a
contributing component in the National Register–eligible HemisFair ’68 historic district,
and several are designated as State Antiquities Landmarks. The National Register and
State Antiquities Landmark status of the Solis house, another historical resource moved
to its current location in 1967, was reversed earlier this year. Altered historic-age and
nonhistoric resources in the vicinity are the ca. 1988 Arch Plaza with entrance arch and
planter; the 1988 Clock Tower Plaza with clock and fountain and 2001 Francisco Madero
statue; the 1968/1988 orchestra gazebo; and the 1968/2003 Mexican Pavilion/Instituto
Cultural de Mexico and several sculptures that surround the building.
The project area’s landscape was substantially altered in the last quarter of the
twentieth century. The first transformation took place between 1973 and 1986 when the
temporary HemisFair buildings and structures flanked by the Mexican Pavilion and the
Halff house were demolished. The buildings housed the national displays of Korea,
Thailand, Venezuela, France, Japan, China, Portugal, and Canada. Two concession
complexes (numbers two and three), the skyride and one of its stations, and the monorail
and one of its stations were removed. Just north of the project area, the press and
protocol center and Arkansas display were demolished to make room for the expanded
convention center.
In preparation for the HemisFair ’68 twentieth anniversary, a number of changes

7

had taken place by 1988. A large temporary building with fair offices and the
Switzerland display, just north of Beethoven Hall and noted as the United Services
Organizations building on a 1988 map, were demolished. The gazebo was shifted from its
original location near the gate to the north wide of Hemisfair Plaza Way; the gazebo was
subsequently moved farther north of the street, closer to the Schultze house. The nearby
concession complex (number one) was demolished. Most temporary buildings with
national displays—Bolivia, Germany, Spain, Panama, Italy, Central America, Belgium,
and Columbia—and the People and Paper building were removed. A fountain near the
Spanish and Italian exhibits was dismantled, and the C. W. Park Carousel took its place.
Other new construction included Arch and Clock Tower Plazas and a kiosk near the
South Alamo Street entrance at Arch Plaza. Parking was allowed around the perimeter
of the several historical buildings. By 1988, a large parking area between the federal
complex was developed. A parking area on its east side serviced Beethoven Hall. A water
wall and fountain were proposed between the kiosk and Beethoven Hall but apparently
not built. The addition of a 2001 statue and 2003 renovations to the Mexican Pavilion
reflect more recent changes in the project area.
The proposed improvements take historic properties into consideration and cause
no adverse impacts to them. No improvements are proposed for historic properties in the
project area. The West Berlin Bear will be removed, stored during construction, and
installed with a new base approximately 160 ft west of its current location on the north
side of East Nueva Street. The sculpture will be protected during this entire process.
Other historic properties will be protected with construction fencing. The removal of
asphalt, brick pavers, concrete curb, miscellaneous concrete, archway, benches, and
lighting, and the installation of new trash receptacles, bollards, lighting, benches, seat
walls, seat blocks, pavers, and planters will not directly impact the historic properties in
the project area. The addition of vegetation and trees will promote a more neighborhoodlike setting, reminiscent of an older residential area. The placement of both East Nueva
and Water Streets will be along existing routes, generally following the locations of these
nineteenth-century streets and retaining routes that were present during HemisFair ’68.
Overall, the proposed improvements will enhance the integrity of the district, promote
continued use and viability, and be in keeping with its historic functions as both
neighborhood and fair ground. Visual and indirect impacts are minimal and sympathetic
in terms of size, scale, and materials. As a result, the proposed improvements will have
no adverse impact on historic properties.
