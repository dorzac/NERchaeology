Abstract
In February of 2018, AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra) conducted a cultural resources
investigation in support of the Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Twelvemile
Substation Project in Crockett County, Texas. The proposed 345-kV substation will encompass
an area of approximately 15 acres. Additionally, LCRA has identified approximately 10.5 miles
(16.9-km) of existing rural access roads that will be upgraded in selected areas to improve
access to the proposed new substation. Investigators surveyed a total of 15 acres within the
proposed footprint of the substation and an additional 7.6 miles (12.2-km) of existing access
road within an 80–100-foot wide corridor. The proposed project area was assessed through a
100% pedestrian archaeological survey supplemented with judgementally placed shovel tests.
AmaTerra conducted the archeological survey under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8333.
The pedestrian survey targeted areas along the access roads such as topographical features (i.e.
mesa tops and accompanying benches) that are more conducive to containing intact cultural
deposits. Ten shovel tests were excavated within the proposed substation footprint. During the
survey, AmaTerra documented 26 Isolated Occurrences (IO’s) and relocated one previously
recorded site (41CX36). Investigators concluded that that the western portions of 41CX36
within the proposed project area have potential to contain significant intact deposits that may
make it eligible for listing as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL). The portions of the site
within the access road have been completely disturbed and the small remaining portion of the
site east of the road that has been significantly disturbed has no potential for intact deposits;
these portions of the site retain no archaeological potential. For this reason, travel along the
access road will have no adverse effect. However, the portion of the site west of the road retains
the potential for intact deposits and AmaTerra recommends avoidance of the portion of the
site west of the access road. No other significant cultural material or archeological sites were
encountered during the survey.
No artifacts were collected during the survey. All project-related records will be curated at the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, University of Texas-Austin.

Introduction
In February 2018, archeologists from AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra), at the
request of the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA), conducted a cultural resources survey
of LCRA’s proposed Twelvemile Substation Project in Crockett County, Texas (Figure  1
and 2). LCRA has identified improvements for increasing service reliability to transmission
customers at various locations. One of these service reliability improvements is the Twelvemile
Substation Project. The project has been undertaken by LCRA to provide transmission service
to a generator by installing a new 345-kV substation to interconnect the new wind generating
facility. The substation will be designed as a three-breaker ring bus equipped with relaying
controls and real time monitoring. LCRA will also add transformers and metering potential
at the Twelvemile Substation for metering of the Big Sampson Windfarm (LCRA 2018). The
proposed substation will encompass an area of approximately fifteen acres. Additionally,
LCRA has identified approximately 10.5-miles (16.9-km) of existing rural access roads that
will be upgraded in selected areas to improve access to the proposed new substation.
Total acreage surveyed within the proposed Twelvemile substation footprint was approximately
15 acres. An additional 7.6-miles of existing rural access roads were pedestrian surveyed along
high probability areas identified on topographical maps. Currently, all road improvements will
take place entirely along existing access roads.
As the planned construction would occur on property owned by a political subdivision of the
State of Texas (LCRA), the proposed project is subject to the provisions of the Antiquities
Code of Texas (ACT). The ACT, now subsumed in Title 13, Part II of the Texas Administrative
Code, defines the necessary conditions for recognition and preservation State Archeological
Landmarks (SALs) and requires that any political subdivision of the State of Texas, defined
as a “local governmental entity created and operating under the laws of this state, including
a city, county, school district, or special district created under the Texas Constitution, Article
III, §52(b)(1) or (2), or Article XVI, §59” in 13 TAC §26.5 of the code, must identify potential
SALs through survey of public lands prior to actions that could potentially damage those SALs.
Field investigations were conducted on February 19 and 20, 2018 under Texas Antiquities
Permit No. 8333. W. Nicholas Trierweiler served as the project’s Principal Investigator and
James J. Hill acted as the project archaeologist, while Steven Schooler assisted with field
investigations. Archeologists encountered no difficulties in completing the investigations.
The survey resulted in the documentation of 26 Isolated Occurrences (IO’s) in addition to
relocating and reassessing previously recorded Site 41CX36. Originally recorded in the 1960’s,
41CX36 is a large prehistoric burned rock midden site associated with a laterally extensive
lithic scatter. All 26 IO’s are isolated surficial prehistoric occurrences.

Due to the presence of intact features as well as the potential for intact stratified cultural
deposits, diagnostic artifacts, dateable materials, organic remains coupled with minimal
adverse impacts from modern disturbances, 41CX36 may retain significant research potential
that would make it eligible for designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL). Hence,
avoidance or archeological testing of 41CX36 is recommended.
Field investigations were designed to comply with appropriate archeological field methods as
defined in the Department of the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983), the Guidelines
of the Council of Texas Archeologists (1987), and the survey standards developed by the Texas
Historical Commission (THC) in conjunction with the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA
n.d.). The primary intent of the survey was to identify and describe all archeological resources
discovered within the study area, evaluate their eligibility for inclusion to the NRHP or for
formal SAL designation and, should archeological historic properties or sites be located, make
recommendations for future management options such as avoidance and preservation or further
investigations.
No artifacts were collected, but all project related materials, such as field forms and photographs,
will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), University of
Texas-Austin.
This report is divided into six chapters. The environmental setting and cultural overview
are discussed in Chapters 2 and 3 respectively. Chapter 4 includes the field methodology
implemented during the project. The results of field investigations are presented in Chapter 5.
Chapter 6 contains a summary and management recommendations.

Environmental Setting
The proposed Twelvemile Substation project area is located at the intersection of three
subregions within two separate ecoregions of Texas (Figure 3). Sections of the access roads
(approximately 3.75-miles), the substation itself, the previously recorded and SAL eligible
41CX36, and all IOs occur within the Semiarid Edwards Plateau subregion within the Edwards
Plateau ecoregion. The Edwards Plateau region is characterized by largely a dissected limestone
plateau with undulating hills to the south and east where it is easily distinguished from bordering
ecological regions by a sharp fault line (Griffith et al. 2007). This environment is an uplifted
and elevated region originally formed from marine deposits of sandstone, limestone, dolomites,
and shales approximately 100 million years ago during the Cretaceous Period when this region
was predominantly covered by an ocean. The western portion demonstrates a relatively flat
elevated plateau. The eastern portion, known as the Texas Hill Country, is largely eroded.
Most of the previously identified access roads (approximately 6.75-miles) within the proposed
project area are located in the Stockton Plateau, a subregion of the Chihuahuan Desert
ecoregion. This region is part of what is often referred to as the Trans-Pecos area within
the Mountain and Basin Ecological Area of Texas as described by Gould (1962). Although
considered a transitional zone, it compares more favorably with the topography and vegetation
of the Trans-Pecos area of West Texas. Typical Trans-Pecos landforms include mesa tops, talus
slopes, valley flats, and canyon washes which were routinely observed throughout the APE.
Similarly, the vegetation and soils are more comparable with the Stockton Plateau subregion
of the Chihuahuan Desert as described by Griffith et al. (2007).
The West Texas region can be quite diverse and contains several north to south oriented
mountain ranges separated by internal drainage basins. It is characterized by a semiarid climate
with a dominance of stunted xerophytic vegetation. It is commonly considered a northern
extension of the Chihuahuan Desert Province (Blair 1950:105). The western extent of Crockett
County is characterized by terrain consisting of high tabletop mesas and wide-open prairies.
Tributaries associated with the nearby Pecos River have created numerous canyon washes
and erosional drainages surrounding the proposed Twelvemile project area, such as Simpson
Canyon to the east. This vast landscape comprises an ecological transition zone at the junction
of the high and rolling plains in the north, the Edwards Plateau in the east, the scrub-brush
country in the south, and the Chihuahuan Desert’s mountain basins in the west.

Geology and Soils
Geologically, the area is a continuation of the Cretaceous-age Edwards limestone that forms
the core of the karst terrain associated with the Edwards Plateau (Griffith et al. 2007:16). Soils
overlying limestone include Ector-Upton, Noelke-Ector, Pandale-Upton, Reagan-Hodgins and
Sanderson-Upton Associations (Figure 4). Regionally, most soils are aeolian and colluvial
silty clay and sandy clay loams (USDA-NRCS 2018).

Vegetation, Hydrology, and Climate
Vegetation observed during this survey included cedar, juniper, Spanish dagger aloerita, catclaw,
persimmon, sotol, yucca, prickly pear cactus, tasajillo, and numerous desert shrubs (Figure 5).
The Pecos River flows only a short distance (0.25 mile) west of the extreme southern end of the
APE. Most precipitation in this area occurs in the summer months during brief thunderstorms.
The average annual rainfall is thirteen inches. Temperatures range from an average low of 31
°F in January to an average high of 96 °F in July.

Regional Cultural
Background and Previous Investigations
The project area is situated at the crossroads of four archeological regions as defined by Perttula
(2004) (Figure 6). It resides almost at the border of the Trans-Pecos, Lower Pecos, Southern
High Plains, and Central Texas regions (Perttula 2004). It is characterized by its numerous
natural rock shelters formed in limestone canyons and cliffs, as well as its ubiquitous raw lithic
outcrops and isolated micro-environments near artesian springs. Offering protection from
the elements, rockshelter localities were consistently attractive to hunter-gatherers, and from
an archeological standpoint, they create ideal conditions for the preservation of burned rock
middens, organic materials, burials, and petroglyphic and pictographic rock art.
Typically, cultural chronology in Texas is divided into four major periods of time: Pre-Clovis
and Paleoindian (16,000–8800 years before the present [BP]), Archaic (8800–1200/1300 BP),
Late Prehistoric (1200/1300–250 BP), and Historic (250 BP–present) (Prewitt 1981). While
the Prehistoric Periods are principally defined by the presence of diagnostic projectile points
and other technologies, they are intended to order cultural change and are thus somewhat
arbitrary; cultural change proceeded at somewhat different rates over the vast area of Texas.
A regional chronology of the Paleoindian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric and Historic periods are
detailed in the following sections. Once a culture chronology for this region of Texas has been
summarized, a brief overview of archeological work in proximity to the project area will be
provided.

Pre-Clovis and Paleoindian (ca. 16,000–8800 BP)
The arrival of humans in the New World may have occurred as early as 16,000 years ago
(Jennings and Waters 2014). Some evidence suggests the presence of Pre-Clovis occupations
in Texas at the Debra L. Friedkin Site located along Buttermilk Creek in Bell County (Waters et
al. 2011). Artifacts found at this site include bifaces, a discoidal core, edge-modified flake tools,
blade fragments, bladelets, a polished piece of hematite, and macrodebitage. Additionally, PreClovis components have been reported from the Gault Site, situated upstream from the Debra
L. Friedkin Site.
The Paleoindian Period dates from approximately 11,500–8800 BP and is often subdivided
into the Early and Late Paleoindian subperiods (Collins 2004). The Paleoindian period
was characterized by cooler and wetter climatic conditions than today. Paleoindian peoples
practiced unique subsistence patterns that consisted of hunting now extinct megafauna and
foraging from local plant resources (Black 1989; Mauldin et al. 2003).

Chapter 3

As the Pleistocene ended, diagnostic Paleoindian materials in the form of Clovis, Folsom,
and Plainview projectile points began to enter the archeological record. These points were
lanceolate-shaped and fluted for hafting to wooden spears. Using the launching momentum
from atlatls (spear-throwers), large game such as mammoth, mastodons, bison, camel, and
horse were frequently taken (Black 1989). In addition to megafauna, Paleoindian groups likely
harvested less daunting prey including antelope, turtle, frogs, etc. Stylistic changes in projectile
point technology occurred during this later portion of the period, eventually shifting to Dalton,
Scottsbluff, and Golondrina traditions. Environmental studies suggest that Late Pleistocene
Epoch climates were wetter and cooler (Mauldin and Nickels 2001; Toomey et al. 1993) during
most of the Paleoindian Period with a gradual shift to drier and warmer conditions at the onset
of the Early Holocene Epoch (Bousman 1998). The end of the Pleistocene was likely arid to
semiarid, and prickly pear and agave populations were high (Bousman et al. 1990:94, 98). As
megafauna gradually died off during the shift to a warmer climate, subsistence patterns shifted
toward smaller game and plant foraging. Intact Paleoindian occupations in the Trans-Pecos
region are somewhat rare and consist mostly of kill sites found near rockshelters (Turpin 1995),
or isolated projectile points within multicomponent scatters (Seebach 2001). This cultural
change is visible in the archaeological record and marks the onset of the Archaic Period.

Archaic Period (ca. 8800–1200/1300 BP)
The Archaic Period, which lasted approximately 7500 years, is divided into the Early, Middle,
and Late Archaic subperiods (Collins 2004). The Archaic Period exhibited a shift from more
mobile hunting strategies to a heavier reliance on a broader spectrum of local plants and
animals (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004) and broadly dates to 8800–1200/1300 BP. Rockshelters
were more intensively utilized during the Archaic, thus leading to an increase in rock art. This
period signifies a shift away from megafauna to smaller animals, a more intensive reliance on
plant resources, an increased use in ground stones for food processing, a decrease in residential
mobility, the systematic burial of the dead, the use of stone cooking technology, and an increase
in woodworking tools (Yelacic and Lohse 2011). The Late Archaic in the Trans-Pecos is the
best understood sequence and suggests that a population increase took place with a heavier
reliance on specialized food processing earth ovens (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). Common
site types of this period include large-scale burned rock middens that are exposed on mesa tops
overlooking canyons and water sources.
Mallouf (1985: Figure 14) has summarized chronologies unique to the Trans-Pecos, and it
was refined further into ten prehistoric periods and a phase by Turpin (1995). Some overlap
in projectile point technologies is shared between the Trans Pecos and Central Texas. Hester
places the Early Archaic in neighboring Central Texas between 7950 and 4450 BP based on
Early Corner Notched and Early Basal Notched projectile points (1995:436–438). Collins’
dating of the Early Archaic period to 8800–6000 BP is founded on unstemmed point types
(1995:383). Middle Archaic materials date from about 6000 to 4000 BP (Collins 1995:383).
The last subperiod of the Archaic falls between 4000 and 1200/1300 BP (Collins 1995:384).

Late Prehistoric Period (ca. 1200/1300–250 BP)
The commonly held date for the beginning of this interval is 1200/1300 BP with a hallmark
transition to the bow and arrow (Hester 1981). This technology enabled prehistoric hunters to
harvest prey from greater distances with a lesser need for brushless, wide open spaces required
for atlatl maneuverability. The use of arrows is indicated by smaller-sized, triangular projectile
points. Another turning point in the Late Prehistoric period is the first substantial presence
of pottery. Trans-Pecos sites dating to the Late Prehistoric suggest a continued reliance on
rockshelters, but also show up in the form of tipi rings, cairn burials, and pit houses built along
water source terraces. Perdiz arrow points, groundstone implements, beveled bifacial knives,
end-notched sinker stones, and ornamental beads add more diversity to the archeological
record during this interval.

Historic Period (250 BP–Present)
Beginning in the late AD 1500s, Europeans entered what is now Texas only sporadically. The
first exposure to European contact comes with the arrival of Alva Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca
and the remaining survivors of the Narvaez expedition in 1528. In Crockett County, the first
Spaniards to pass through the area were part of the Gaspar Castaño de Sosa mining expedition
in 1590 (Smith 2016). Between 1528 and the late 1600s, Spanish excursions into the Texas
territory were limited, but Spanish records described a number of Native American tribes like
the Coahuiltecans. They were described as family units of hunter gatherers that resided near
streams and springs, whose camps were revisited on a seasonal basis (Campbell 1983:349–351).
By the mid-1700s, the Comanche had begun entering the region from the north, following the
buffalo migrations. Efficiency on horseback allowed them to displace numerous native groups
and control trade and prime hunting grounds. In 1821, Spain lost control of most of its North
American territories when it recognized the independence of Mexico. Anglo settlement in
Texas soon followed in the 1830s when Stephen F. Austin’s colonists were allotted impresario
contracts by the newly formed Mexican government. After the fight for Texas Independence,
independent Republic of Texas prospered for ten years, eventually joining the United States
in 1845. The threat of Indian hostility was still present, especially in the vicinity of the Pecos
River. To safeguard travelers from Indian attack and to protect the San Antonio-El Paso Mail
route, the United States Army established Fort Lancaster in 1855 (Smith 2016). Named after
David Crockett, one of the heroes of the infamous Alamo, the county was established on January
12, 1875, but was not formally organized until July 7, 1891 when an election established
Ozona as the county seat. As for much of West Texas, ranching dominated the local economy
for decades. Although having not experienced the oil boom observed in other neighboring
counties due largely in part because of a lack of a railway through Crockett County, petroleum
and natural gas production nonetheless created a major uptick in the local economy leading up
to and after the Great Depression. Today, Crockett County is still largely rural, but ranching
coupled with petroleum and natural gas development has supported a stable economy.

Previous Cultural Resource Investigations
An archeological background review was conducted in February 2018. The Texas Archeological
Sites Atlas (Atlas) was consulted to identify previous surveys and recorded cultural resources.
This review focused on the identification of previously recorded archaeological sites, Registered
Texas Historic Landmarks (RTHLs), sites listed as SALs, sites listed on the National Register
of Historic Places (NRHP), cemeteries, and archaeological surveys within one kilometer (0.62
mile) of the project area (Figure 7).
According to the Atlas, two previous archeological surveys overlap the proposed project area.
In 1999, S. Turpin surveyed approximately 13 square miles immediately north of the project
area. This survey resulted in the recording of 41CX904 located approximately 800 m north
of the Twelvemile Substation project area. According to the online site form, 41CX904 is a
small burned rock midden containing fire-cracked rock, lithic flakes, and a sandstone mano.
The site was recommended for no further investigations but was determined eligible for the
NRHP in 2001. A second survey was conducted by Cox & McLain Environmental Consulting,
Inc. in 2015 on behalf of the city of Iraan. Three sites, 41PC769, 41PC811 and 41PC812 were
recorded or revisited during the survey. These three sites are located outside the proposed
Twelvemile Substation project area (Atlas 2018).
A total of seventeen previously recorded sites occur within a 1-km radius of the project area.
The sites (41CX10, 41CX11, 41CX23, 41CX31, 41CX36, 41CX37, 41CX51, 41CX52,
41CX53, 41CX65, 41CX904, 41CX1323 and 41CX1324; 41PC769, 41CX811 and 41CX812),
as well as the Memory Garden Cemetery, were identified within the 1-km buffer of the project
area (see Figure 7). However, only 41CX36 is located directly within the proposed footprint
of the proposed project area and was subject to this investigation. Little information was
available on the Atlas for 41CX36 apart from being recorded in the 1960s and its site type.
Site 41CX36 was recorded as the “Dry Well Road Midden; Riggs’ Site K” and is described as
a “Mound Midden.” The remaining sixteen sites, as well as the Memory Garden Cemetery, are
all recorded outside of the proposed Twelvemile project area and will not be impacted by the
proposed project.
Review of historic aerial photography and maps show that historically the area has been rural,
with no indication of residential or commercial development. Much of the area is characterized
by existing and derelict oil and gas wells and accompanying infrastructure. Aerial photography
from 1954 shows some development in the area, with the presence of access roads and
structures associated with nearby ranches located in and around the proposed project area
(Figure 8–9). Examination of more recent USGS topographic maps indicate the area is still
largely undeveloped except for features associated with the oil and gas industry as indicated on
a series of 1970 USGS 7.5 quadrangle maps south of Iraan, Texas (Figure 10). Recent aerial
photographs show a significant increase in the development of oil and gas infrastructure in the
area.

Methods
Prior to field investigations, archaeologists conducted archival research to assess the potential
for historic-period archaeological materials. This research involved examining historical maps
and aerial photographs. In addition, archaeologists consulted the Atlas (2018) to assess the
potential for previously recorded archaeological sites within the project area, as well as a
review of literature on archaeological sites within the region. This allowed investigators to
identify previously recorded archaeological sites adjacent to or within the project area, and
provided insight into site types, site settings, artifact assemblages, and average depth of cultural
materials below the ground surface. Lastly, the proposed project area limits were overlaid on
aerial based gridded maps and loaded onto hand-held GPS units to aid in navigation.
Field investigation of the proposed LCRA’s Twelvemile Substation project area was conducted
according to standard survey methods and under appropriate guidelines. Review of USGS
topographic maps in combination with field investigations revealed that the majority of the
proposed project area crosses denuded upland terrain containing shallow soils and laterally
extensive bedrock exposures. The survey was conducted from February 19–20, 2018 and
conformed to survey standards set forth by the Council of Texas Archaeologists (CTA). Field
investigations consisted of a 100 percent pedestrian survey augmented by judgementally placed
shovel tests. Survey transects ranged from fifteen to thirty meters apart. Shovel tests typically
measured 30 cm in diameter and extend to a maximum depth of 50 cm below surface (cmbs).
The shovel tests were excavated in 10-cm increments and all removed soil was screened
through ¼ inch hardware mesh to ensure artifact recovery. Appropriate shovel test data was
recorded on an AmaTerra shovel test forms, and all shovel test locations were plotted with a
hand-held global positioning system (GPS) receiver.
During pedestrian survey, the ground was thoroughly inspected for cultural materials which
were identified as FCR, debitage, bifacial lithic tools in varying stages of lithic reduction,
projectile points, ground stone implements, or historic materials over 50 years in age. Based on
density and diversity of artifacts, as well as the lateral extension of these materials, they were
recorded as an archeological site or an IO.
For the purposes of this survey, an archeological site had to contain a certain number of cultural
materials or features older than 50 years within a given area. The criteria for recording an
archeological site employed during the survey was: 1) five or more surface artifacts within a
15-m radius, or 2) a single cultural feature, such as a hearth or rock art, observed on the surface.
Specific information on all IOs and Site 41CX36 was recorded in the field through field notes,
hand-drawn maps, digital photographs, and GPS points. This information was later recorded
on standardized forms and submitted to TARL for inclusion in their archives. Any artifacts
found either on the surface or in shovel tests were catalogued and photographed in the field and
returned to their original locations. No artifacts were collected during the survey.

Results
A total of 7.6-miles (12.2-km) of existing rural access roads in addition to a proposed 15-acre
substation footprint were surveyed as part of LCRA’s proposed Twelvemile Substation Project.
A total of 10 shovel tests were excavated during the survey. Typical shovel tests measured
approximately 30 centimeters (cm) in diameter and extended no deeper than 50 cm below
surface (cmbs). Shovel testing was undertaken only at the proposed substation location due
to its position along the apex of a mesa and its potential to contain subsurface deposits. No
cultural material was encountered in any subsurface test. Relevant information for all shovel
tests was recorded on a standardized form and will be curated at TARL along with all other
documentation associated with the project after the final report is submitted to LCRA.
Field efforts relocated one previously recorded site (41CX36) and documented 26 IO’s (Figure
11). Specific site information for 41CX36 was recorded on standardized forms and submitted
to TARL for inclusion in their archives. All artifacts were field catalogued and returned to their
original locations as per LCRA requirement that no artifacts were to be collected during the
survey.

Site Description
Site 41CX36
During the survey, one previously recorded Site 41CX36 was revisited (Figure 12). Site 41CX36
was recorded in 1968 by Aaron Riggs as part of the Parker Ranch Survey (Figure 13). Based
on the limited data available for 41CX36, it is characterized as the Dry Well Road Midden and
Mr. Riggs describes it as a “Mound Midden” and refers to it as “Site K” (Figure 14). During
field investigations, AmaTerra archeologists relocated the site approximately 50 m southeast of
the location as recorded in the THC Site Atlas. Since limited information is available for Site
41CX36, AmaTerra archaeologists investigated the site as if previously unrecorded.
Site 41CX36 is recorded as a prehistoric burned rock midden site located on an east to west
sloping toe slope. The site was identified on the surface during visual inspection of the access
roads along the slope. The site measures approximately 180 meters north-south by 75 meters
east-west, encompassing approximately 2.5 acres. Site 41CX36 is partially defined by a large
circular burned rock midden, 12 meters in diameter by 1 to 1.5 meters in height, as well as a
secondary cluster of burned rocks exposed within the access road and a moderately dense lithic
scatter that surrounds the burned rock features (Figures 15–17).
Although no temporally diagnostic artifacts were noted on the surface, an estimated 200 pieces
of lithic debitage at various stages of reduction were noted within the site boundary. Apart
from the rural access road which bisects the site, the western portion of 41CX36 appears to be
almost completely intact.

Figure 17. Sample of artifacts observed at 41CX36.

Common vegetation observed at the site included Juniper, Cedar, creosote. Mesquite, yucca,
and Prickly Pear cactus. Ground surface visibility was consistently 100 percent throughout
the site boundary. Soils were shallow, and laterally extensive areas of exposed bedrock were
observed throughout the site.
Overall the diversity of artifacts observed across the surface of the site, including burned
rock features, reveal a variety of materials suggesting long-term use of the site. Based on
field investigations, it is AmaTerra’s opinion that there is potential for the western portions
of 41CX36 to contain significant intact buried archeological deposits. The portions of the
site within and east of the access road have been completely disturbed and have no potential
for intact deposits. For this reason, travel along the access road will have no adverse effect.
However, the portion of the site west of the road retains the potential for intact deposits and
AmaTerra recommends avoidance of the portion of the site west of the access road (see Figure
12).

Isolated Occurrences (IO’s)
During field investigations, 26 IOs were identified within the proposed project area (Table 1).
All 26 IOs were prehistoric and are summarized in the following table.

Summary and Management
Recommendations
AmaTerra surveyed a total of 7.6-miles (12.2-km) of existing rural access roads in addition
to a 15-acre substation location for the proposed Twelvemile Substation Project in Crockett
County, Texas. Access was available to the entire proposed project area and archeologists
did not encounter any conditions that inhibited the survey. AmaTerra conducted the cultural
resource survey under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8333 and work conformed to the guidelines
for implementation of these regulations under 13 TAC Chapter 26.
During the survey, archeologists excavated 10 shovel tests, all of which were located within
the footprint of the proposed 15-acre substation location. All shovel tests revealed silty clay
loams and sandy loams overlying shallow bedrock or upland gravels. No cultural material was
encountered in any shovel test. Survey crews re-located and reassessed previously recorded
Site 41CX36, in addition to documenting 26 IOs.
None of the IOs meet the criteria as an archeological site, hence they do not need to be avoided.
Site 41CX36 is a prehistoric burned rock midden site consisting of a moderately dense
lithic scatter of debitage with occasional bifaces and lithic tools. No temporally diagnostic
artifacts were observed. The site contains two burned rock midden features. One of which
is approximately 12 m in diameter on the west side of the access road and is almost entirely
intact. The second feature is on the eastern side of the road and is also exposed within the road
bed and is nearly completely destroyed. The site was evaluated using criteria outlined under
13 TAC 26. Although 41CX36 had shallow soils, an abundance of surficial artifacts, consisting
mostly of lithic debitage, was noted.
The portions of the site within the access road have been completely disturbed and the small
remaining portion of the site east of the road has been significantly disturbed and has no
potential for intact deposits; these portions of the site retain no archaeological potential. For
this reason, travel along the access road will have no adverse effect. However, the portion of
the site west of the road retains the potential for intact deposits and AmaTerra recommends
avoidance of the portion of the site west of the access road.
Field investigations in the remaining portions of the proposed project area and access roads
did not identify any significant cultural materials or sites. Based on the results of the survey,
AmaTerra recommends no further cultural resources investigations in these areas outside of
the western portion of 41CX36 of the proposed project. If it is determined that the proposed
project requires additional acreage or new access roads not included in the current study, then
additional cultural resources investigations may be necessary in those areas. In the event that
previously unidentified cultural materials are discovered during construction, work in the
immediate area of discovery would cease and the THC will be contacted.
